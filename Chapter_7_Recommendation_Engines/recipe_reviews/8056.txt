I just wanted to comment on the other reviews...If you use all-purpose flour, instead of self rising, they WILL be flat and tasteless.  Follow the directions.  If you don't have self rising flour, add baking powder.  Look online for conversions.

This recipe has a good base, but even a flat cake need levening of sorts. after trying one as is(plus cinnamon), I added 1/2 tablespoon baking powder and 1/2 tablespoon sugar to the mix. The rest of the batch was much better. Next time I'll skip the oil, add honey for sweetness, and add the baking powder to the dry ingredients mixed beforehand.

Grabbed this recipe and 30 mins later we sat down to a giant stack of pancakes. I made two batches separately and the only thing I added was 2 tsp of vanilla extract. 
I was consistent with every measurement except the flour which I eyeballed for consistency. I put in enough to make the batter quite thick (even a little lumpy) and whipped it with a fork.
In the pan (teflon with butter) the batter stayed together very well and did not easily run away. Only the edges had air bubbles by the time I flipped them, then I watched them rise before my eyes. I used less oil in the first batch and I thought that the first ones weren't as fluffy.
My flatmates claimed they had never eaten fluffier pancakes, and I thought they were pretty darn good too, although I may tinker with some seasoning.
N.B. make sure you're using self-raising flour, plain/all-purpose will leave you with flat, rubbery crepes. Do a tester first to see if the batter works, if not you still have time to tinker.

I noticed this recipe was rated either very good or very bad, so I had to try it. It seemed a little thin, so I added a little extra flour (maybe less than 1/4 cup)and 2 tsp. vanilla. I don't see any reason to add sugar if you plan to eat them smothered in syrup! Those who rated it badly, may have used all purpose flour.  Pancake batter, like brownies, should be left slightly lumpy.  I poured them onto a non-stick griddle which I greased lightly with a paper towel dipped in vegetable oil.  Turn after the edges look dry and the bubbles on top begin to pop.  They will rise beautifully after you turn them.  And they tasted great!

I'm not quite sure why I tried this recipe so many times--I think I was worried I was screwing it up!  I tried several variations of flours, baking spices, honey, oil, even chocolate chips.  All yielded variaties of flat, rubbery pancake.  I appreciate that it requires few ingredients, but that doesn't compensate for the lack of flavor.

Absolutely horrible!  Total waste of ingredients and time!  Wish I could give it 0 stars.  They were as thin as paper and had a nasty taste.

They may be quick. easy and cheap but then again sometimes you get what you pay for. I don't think you can even call these things pancakes. They are flat (not the fluffy melt in your mouth pancakes) and my kids who will eat ANYTHING hated them. My advice is travel to another page and try a different recipe such as the canadian kind or blow the $2.50 and get some pancake mix.

These pancakes turn out pretty well, just be sure to use self-rising flour (which I never have, so used 1 cup flour + 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder + 1/2 teaspoon salt).

These were the absolute best basic pancake I've ever made, including the packaged kind.  Really light and fluffy.  I didn't have self rising flour so I just mixed in 1.5 tsp baking powder and .5 tsp salt.  Delish!!

Made these this morning and they were very good! I used all purpose flower with 1 tbsp of baking powder. Also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 tsp of cinnamon. I used a blender to blend the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients, and it worked out well! They are nice, fluffy and so easy to make! Would make them again.

I know my way around the kitchen, and I know the difference in flour, I used all purpose and added baking powder, salt and a little sugar and vanilla for flavour. They were flat and  rubbery. I will not try this again.

The ingredients were similar to what I use for making paper mache crafts.  I'm so sorry for the negative review, however, these were just too flat and bland.  If adding this and that makes the recipe better, well, then it's not the recipe listed that deserves the stars.  Sorry Jan.

i found this recipe by searching for 3 of the last things i had in my pantry: eggs, oil, and flour. normally i hate pancakes, but i had these ingredients so i figured i should feed myself. they turned out great! i used all-purpose flour, and i think that's why i liked them so much. normally i hate the spongy texture of pancakes, but these came out denser, like thick crepes. i added 1t vanilla and 0.25 cups powdered sugar. i probably could have gone with less powdered sugar. but they're great!

These are just like the pancakes my mum used to make!  I hate the fluffy kind, and these are fantastic!  More like a crepe, really.  My favourite way to serve these is with lemon juice and sugar - a "Britishism" I think.  My fella just loves these kind, too, as he is also not a fan of the "flapjack" type.

This was the first time making panckaes that were totally homemade.  We were so suprized at how light and fluffy they were.  We did add vanilla( we always do) and we will use this recipe again.  I will , howver, add a bit of sugar to the mix the next time.  It was missing something, but I can't quite tell what that something is.  Very good and impressive recipe though.  Thank you so much

Thanks for bailing me out!  Ants somehow got into our Betty Crocker pancake mix and I was pressed for time.  I got on the net, got your recipe and had finished all the pancakes all in about 30 minutes!  They are really easy to make and I won't be buying mixes anymore!  They're great!

I found if I smooth out the batter immediately that they turn out nice and flat (The english version) make sure the pan is nearly as hot as it can be. My husband loves these with fresh squeezed lemon juice mixed with sugar. Pour it on and roll them up. Try it with raspberry jam too!

This was so easy. I hate to cook and my daughter was fussing that she wanted pancakes. No mix so I gave this a whirl. Mine were fluffy and very tasty. I added a bit of vanilla and they were great.

add one tsp of vanilla, and adjust the batter so it is alittle thicker- having done that, I think they're great. The right amount for two adults.

These weren't the best or the "fanciest" pancakes I've ever had, but they were the easiest & I had everything on hand when my grandson asked me if I could make him pancakes.  I ended up doubling the batch & doing as someone else suggested - added a little vanilla.  Really pretty good tasting, basic pancake.

These were so good. I was looking for an easy recipe and this is it.  My 1 year old is allergic to dairy and soy so he can't have pretty much anything out of a box.  I substituted milk with vanilla coconut milk. Awesome! This will be my go to recipe. Thanks

Found this recipe after doing a search for recipes using self-rising flour.  After adding 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 Tbsp sugar, these pancakes turned out as good as (maybe even better!) than our favorite pancake recipe from the box of a popular baking mix.

This is a very good recipe! However I did read some of the reviews and added some ingredients. I added 1/2 T of Baking Powder and Sugar, 2 tsp Vanilla and Salt. I also didn't sift my flour and it came out just fine. The pancakes came out nice and fluffy! I will definitely make these again it's very simple and all the ingredients are already in your pantry =)

My family & I got up wanting pancakes, didn't have any pancake mix (I usually cheat due to the ease).  I knew what I needed to put together to make pancakes, but wanted to check - I pulled this recipe up & after reading the reviews decided to write one myself.  This recipe is so easy to do that a 5 yr old could do it.  I doubled the recipe and the only thing I added was a tsp of vanilla.  Anyone who gives this recipe a bad review OBVIOUSLY did something wrong with the recipe ie: all purpose flour.  These pancakes were light & airy and delicious!  Better than box... will definitely make again and again!!!!!  Thanks :)

WOW!  I always hated making pancakes from scratch because I never could find one that tasted as good as our local diner.  But look out - these are light, fluffy, and melt in your mouth.  I did add some vanilla because I don't use syrup, but these are good just as the recipe is written.  I will NEVER use a box mix again!!

Pretty good! I only had all purpose flour so I added 1/2 tbs of baking powder and 1/2 tbs of sugar to the flour and mixed it together. Then I added 2 tbs of vanilla extract to the milk, and egg and used about a 3 second spray of canola oil. These turned out as good as the Aunt Jemima pancakes that I served beside them! They were light and fluffy!

If you are looking for a nice, fluffy pancake recipe- here it is!!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is a little bland. I used different variations 1 teaspoon REAL vanilla extract, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 cup blueberries or 1 tsp REAL vanilla extract and 1/2 cup oc chocolate chips. Yum!

Please note, if you are using all purpose flour (instead of self-rising) you MUST add 1.5 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp. salt to the flour!  i also added about a tsp. of vanilla extract, 1 tsp. cinnamon and a sliced banana - these were fantastic.

We usually get bugs in our pancake mixes before we use it all up so I was looking for a recipe that had everthing I always have on hand.  I've made this several times and have never had the problems of some people with them being flat.  I think the key is to have fresh self rizing flour or baking powder and let them sit for a little bit before you use the batter to let the baking powder activiate.  We love this recipe, infact I usually end up doubling it and having left overs for the next morning.

Is a wonderful recipe but agree that if you do Not have Self-Rising Flour will Not turn out.  When I don't I have a note on this for my self to make All-Purpose flour into Self-Rising:

For Self-Rising Flour:
1 c. flour
1 1/2 tsp Baking Powder
1/2 tsp Salt

Make light, fluffy pancakes in the lower alt. area that I live in.

I think these were some of the best pancakes I've ever had, once I changed it up a bit.  I used 2 eggs, added 1/2 Tbsp of baking powder, and about 2 Tbsp of Organic Cane sugar.  I also waited to put the flour in until last.  I didn't measure out the flour, but I probably used about 1 1/2 cups.  I just kept adding until the batter was thick but still able to be poured.  If you do these few adjustments, you will always make these pancakes.  I put chocolate chips in when I was cooking them, but they would be great without anything added too.  They come out very fluffy, so make sure you have a glass of milk available.  Give these pancakes a try, and you won't be disappointed.

If using all purpose flour you MUST add 1.5 tsp of BAKING POWDER and .5 tsp of salt. Just made these using Vanilla Silk and they turned out fantastic. Don't be worried about the bad reviews you just need to use self rising or add the bp and salt.

I read the reviews before making and added the baking powder since I didn't have the self-rising flour.  They were fantastic, tasted like the one's Mom used to make when I was a kid.  Super super easy to make, no more store box mixes for me.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe  I just made them again and again they were perfect.  Not reading the recipe means a bad cook, not a bad recipe.

Not a huge fan of these pancakes.  I didn't have self rising flour, but I added baking powder and that did make for a fluffier pancake.  However, I felt that the pancakes lacked flavor.  I don't think I'll be making these again.

flavor wise was kinda plain but its awsome for fruit sauces. the selfrising flour is a must, if your getting flat cakes your flour may have gone bad, i made 3inch cakes and each one was more then a 1/4 inch thick, almost too fluffy. also make sure you sift the flour but don't over beat the batter you want small clumps or it can also flatten the cake out, i got best results from a medium medium high heat with quick shot of non stick spray.

These were yummy! I used ap flour with proper additions and they were mouthwatering! I ate 3 with butter only! A real pancake! These taste almost exactly like the pancakes I ate growing up, although im still hoping to find a special addition my mom must have used.. But when done properly these turn out light and fluffy.. Will try them with self rising flour to see the difference (if any)..if substituting All purpose flour for the self rising: use 1 and 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp salt added to enough flour to make 1 cup (that's my personal way). Without the rising agent you will obviously get flat pancakes..

Easy pancakes and easily modified (add blueberries...ect.)  If you are  not using selfrising flour, make your own.  For every 1 cup flour add 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt voila...self-rising flour.  Have fun creating.

This was super easy!! I woke up and had a hankering for pancakes, so I looked up a recipe and thought this sounded easy and they were! I used wheat flour instead of white, applesauce instead of the oil and egg substitute and they were delicious. No need to ever spend the money on a box of mix. Thanks!!

I give this 2 stars. I thought it was a very bland tasteless pancake, but if you need pancakes on the fly it would work. But for a saturday morning, family breakfast, this was not a hit at my house.

Just to reiterate what others were saying.  Make sure you add 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt to the all purpose flour.  Now you've got self-rising flour.  I left out the vegetable oil and added a teaspoon of vanilla.  Easy, quick, and good.

This recipe is fantastic. It's a quick, easily adaptable stock recipe. Keep in mind that self rising flour is what makes this -- if you have all purpose, add 1 1/2t baking powder and 1/2t salt per cup of flour. I also add 1t of cinnamon and 1/4t nutmeg to the flour mix and 1t vanilla to the milk mixture. Use these to make your own sausage egg and cheese griddle sammiches too. :)

I didn't have much luck with this one. The 'cakes were flat and not very tasty -- not bad, just not...anything.

This recipe was excellent and so easy!  The only thing needed was a little sugar.  I also added an additional 1/4 cup flour and 1/2 cup milk.  My family really enjoyed them!

Best pancakes I've ever made.  I will never return to a mix.  Both my kids ate them, even the one who usually hates pancakes.  I did not have self-rising flour, so I found this conversion on the net.  To make 1 cup of self-raising flour, measure 1 cup of all-purpose flour less 2 tsps.  Add 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt.  These were the fluffiest pancakes I've ever eaten.  We even added some blueberries to some of the pancakes.

I had no self-rising flour so I used all-purpose and added 1.5tsp baking powder plus 0.5tsp salt. I also added 2tsp vanilla for flavor. They were delicious, light, and fluffy!

These a great!  My kids and husband beg for them on Saturday morning's.  My only alteration to the recipes is instead of 1 cup of milk use 3/4 cup for a thicker batter.

For me, this was a great, easy pancake recipe. I  didn't have self-rising flour, so followed one of the other tips and made by own by adding 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and a pinch of salt.  I made a single recipe and added mini chocolate chipes (since that's how my 5 year old likes them!) and I thought they were great - as good as the boxed mix and much more healthy!

Good pancakes, just do not use the oil, you do not need it! I top my hot pancakes with milk chocolate chips, butter and sometimes just a bit of real maple syrup.

I've made these pancakes several times. They always turn out great. Sometimes I do add 1/2 tsp. vanilla to the eggs,oil and milk. Then I add 1 Tbsp of sugar to the flour just for a sweeter pancake. Both ways are very good.

Can I just say the best and fluffiest pancakes I've eve had!! If you follow the recipe...you will have great pancakes. I had a craving at 10 pm but no bisquick so I thought well I'll try & If they are bad I'll use em as target practice later. I actually sifted flour ( self rising) and boom. These were nearly 3/4 in thick and rose as you flipped em. I slathered the butter and Yankee syrup... I'm so full I may pop! Please try this as written... You won't be sorry!!

This is actually a great and simple recipe that can be altered to your own tastes i.e. add bananas and walnuts or blueberries, etc. It's a shame there are so many negative reviews! I think many people used regular flour - not self-rising which already has baking powder in it - and got the flat tasteless pancakes. IF you use regular flour, you must add baking powder or you'll have flat egg-y pancakes that resemble really bad crepes. This one is definitely a staple to have in ones recipe book.

Made as written it is definitely flavorless.  I added baking soda as suggested and the pancakes work technically but aren't flavorful at all. We've just tried adding a bit of salt and a bit of vanilla. I wouldn't make this recipe again

These were so simple and absolutely amazing. I am super picky about my pancakes, in particular I don't like pancakes that absorb all the syrup and still taste dry, but these were thin as I like them and delicious. I'm guessing the use of self-rising vs. general purpose flour does make a difference, as another reviewer stated.

I was a little hesitant about this recipe since the reviews seemed to be mixed... BUT tried it anyway cause ingreds on hand were limited and needed a quick lunch for the kiddos.  I doubled the batch and added a tsp of vanilla.  Yes, I did use self-rising flour and they turned out perfect!!! Fluffed really nice and had a great flavor.  This will definitely be my go-to recipe in the future.  I'll probably experiment with some add-ins :)

I LOVE pancakes and am always on the look out for a GREAT pancake recipe.. sadly to say this is not it. They werent BAD but they werent good. The batter was clumpy and watery which is ok.. but then when I put them on the griddle they didnt make perfect circles and the taste was not sweet. They were not fluffy and the texture in your mouth was rubbery even with tons of syrup. They are quick but box pancakes are too and if I had to choose.. the box pancakes would be better than this one. If I had the time I maybe could have tweaked it but I was in a rush..

This is your basic pancake base. I added 1/2 c. flour to thicken the batter. 2 tbs of melted butter instead of oil cause I was out. used lactose free milk in place of the regular milk. Added in 3/4 tsp of Makers Mark bourbon and then about 2 tbs of cinnamon to the batter. I also fried these is Crisco butter shortening, not the spray but the actual butter shortening until they were lightly golden and puffed up beautifully.  Served smothered in butter, pecan maple syrup and a tall glass of milk!

After reading the other reviews, I made a few modifications.  I doubled the recipe, substituting Vanilla Hemp milk for the regular milk and cinnamon applesauce for the oil.  I also added 2 tsps of vanilla and a bit more flour (about 1/4 cup).  Just sweet enough and super fluffy!  As others have said, be sure to use self-rising flour.

These pancakes tasted okay, but didn't rise very much. I suggest putting in 1/2 tsp of baking soda. I won't make these again.

I honestly didn't like them. I used what it said and cooked them like they said and they tasted like cooked dough though i did have to add a little flour to make them thick enough to not fill the pan with one big pancake. thanks

Best and easiest recipe ever! I used melted butter instead of oil for a buttery taste.

Lacks flavor, but there are many thing you can do to spruce them up.  Add some vanilla and cinnamon for example.  People that didn't like this recipe must have not followed it correctly, like using self-rising flour or sifting the flour.  These pancakes were fluffy, and for the lack of ingredients, not that bad.  Enjoyed it!

Some  people on this site don't know the difference between self-rising and plain flour.  This is a good recipe.  I added 1 tsp of vanilla/butter/nut extract and we loved the pancakes.

I had to make self rising flour and it did work, however, the pancakes were missing something.  They were a little bland.  I even added vanilla like one person suggested. Maybe they would've been better if I didn't have to make the self rising flour?  I will try it again though.

These pancakes are super easy and really good! I think the reason some people are having trouble is that these take SELF RISING FLOUR! Please, please make sure you are using the correct thing or I assume they will not turn out.

This is such a great starter recipe! I was running low on Bisquick mix when I was making pancakes this morning. I was able to use the Bisquick mix I had and add in 1/2 cup of the self rising flour. They turned out great!

I love this recipe!! Mostly because I don't have to purchase boxed pancake mix all the time. They taste amazing and you know exactly what your eating!! I make waffles with this batter every Sunday and it is such a hit with everyone.  Thank you for the amazing recipe!

This recipe was great, simple and handy! To make it it more healthy, I used a mixture of flour... spelt flour and wheat flour!! In addition, I added a dash of nutmeg and a teaspoon of cinnamon to the flour and stirred well. I didn't have self-rising flour at home, so I made my own. To make your own self-rising flour - for each cup of flour - you just need to add 1/4 to 1/2 tsp salt, and 1, 1/2 tsp baking soda and sift together - voila! And to make it even more healthy - and flavorful, I used reduced sugar applesauce instead of syrup, and garnished with half of a small apple and half of a small banana in slices mmm - hubby cleaned the plate!  (Look for a picture - I added to my review) Yum! Thanks for sharing your recipe - I've already shared with my friends. :-) Will definitely make it again!

my kids loooove these pancakes.  I don't use the self rising flour, but use the all purpose flour and just add baking powder, let the batter sit for awhile and I can't seem to make enough.

This recipe was bland.  I was really hesitant to try a pancake recipe that didn't call for baking soda or milk in the ingredients.  I should have listened.  There was no amount of butter and syrup that could take away the dry, bland taste.

I haven't tried this recipe, but I think the problem everyone keeps having is there is a LOT of liquid for the amount of flour. Even if you want a batter that pours, you should only use about 3/4 cup liquid for the cup of self-rising flour. I would suggest adding a little more flour or a little less liquid. I hope this helps!

This recipe was a success for me. I was hesitant in using this recipe when i read some of the reviews but because it was so simple, i decided to give it a shot. It turned out well. I guess just try to aerate the flour and incorporate more air into the batter when mixing. That's my take and my pancakes turned out fine! Worth a try! & i added only 1 tbsp of oil and abit of sugar.

I honestly don't know why this recipe would get any bad reviews because these were excellent! Super fast to put together and cook in no time! My boyfriend even said they were better than the pancakes at a restaurant and he should know because he orders pancakes whenever we go out for breakfast!   I didn't have self-rising flour so I used 1 cup of all-purpose and added 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder! Can't go wrong! Thank you for the recipe! Next time might try them with some blueberries or chocolate chips!

Easy recipe, readily available ingredients, great flavor.  A keeper!  I added blackberries to some of the pancakes for my husband which he loved.  Sifting the flour really helped the batter from being too lumpy & didn't require so much mixing which can result in tough cakes.  Using a gravy ladle, this made 8 six inch cakes.  Thanks for sharing!

These pancakes were wonderful!  I did have to add more flour for consistancy, but they puffed right up and were light and delicious. My whole family agrees they are the best pancakes we've ever had.

This is a very good base, an you MUST use self-rising flour.  It only makes enough for half a dozen pancakes so I doubled it, only added 3 TBS oil and I and a sprinkle of cinnimon and added vanilla to my mix.  The kids loved them so I will be using this recipe again!

I followed the self-rising flour recipe on this site (1 cup flour, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 1/2 tsp baking powder) to make these and the batter was very thin. I would add less milk. Tasted alright though.

I just made these, with a/p flour, added baking soda and salt, and they came out fine.  I was eating them when I realized that I forgot the egg, and they came out perfectly anyway.  These could easily be made vegan, without the egg and with soy or rice milk instead of cow's milk.  ETA: I made these this afternoon, with egg this time, and they weren't nearly as good.

Good recipe with a few minor additions...follow the details exactly, then add some sea salt, sugar, and a dab of sour cream....they came out perfectly. Cook right at medium and watch carefully because they cook quickly...then flip and a few seconds later it's done.  My picky kids actually wanted more....amazing.

These were flat and tasteless, I had to add wwwaaayyy more sugar to the batter. And even after that they were bad. The batter was too thick and the pancakes were lifeless.

i would definitely give it 5 stars as it was reallyy easyy..and the cakes were fluffyyy i dont know why ppl are not liking it mayb bcoz of the self rising flour confusion. u can make self rising flour easily (for every cup of all purpose flour add 1 1/2 tsps of baking powder and 1/2tsp of salt) and voila!!!

This pancake recipe was great!!!!! Turned out perfect..did not alter anything, just added blueberries, the key is your heat: If the heat is too low, the pancakes will cook slightly uneven and never brown. If you cook too high, they will burn. If you cook them on medium to medium high-they turn out perfect. I find that butter burns to easily. I use a tinge of extra virgin olive oil before I put it on each pancake. Make double this recipe & have it for two days. If you want to add fruit or chocolate chips, dont add them to the whole batter or you can't save it. Add a SMALL handful to each individual batter..Thank for this recipe, its much better than store bought

Recipe is good. Option if you don't have self-rising flour or don't want to buy it. use cup of all purpose flour and a couple tsps of baking powder and you'll get the same effect. Also can try a tsp of flavoring and maybe some sugar if you like sweet or flavored pancakes. Great quick recipe though.

I don't eat pancakes, but I've made these twice for my kids and both times they've loved them. I did add an extra 1/4 cup of flour and 1/2 tsp of baking powder. All in all, not bad.

So easy and healthy!  I can use however much sugar I like, and for a university student I can save on the ingredients I use.  I used bread flour and a tablespoon of baking powder and the rising worked out very well.  I also added poppyseed and cinnamon, and I plan to use apples or almonds next time.

All of my ingredients were still good, but my pancakes turned out GREEN. I followed the recipe exactly, and my ingredients were fine. I would give this recipe zero stars if possible.

This is a good base recipe as some of the other cooks have said. To the people that have left horrible reviews: I think that's a bit harsh...even a bigginer can play around with this recipe & make it their own. I doubled the recipe, added 2 tblsp of sugar, some cinnamon extract & ground cinnamon & my children including my picky 8 yr old loved them. I will be making these again & I might even play with the ingredients again.
Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I chose this recipe after looking for pancakes similar to how they were made at a resort in the Cook Islands. Simple ingredients, they told me. Self-rising flour, egg, milk, maybe some sugar. This recipe doesn't replicate their pancakes (I don't know if our ingredients here are just too different), but boy did I find a great recipe anyway! Nice fluffy pancakes that couldn't be easier to make! Thanks so much!

I think this should be called crepés and not pancakes. I would rather have the Bisquick kind, at least they are fluffy.

This is the basic recipe behind the pancakes I've always made. However, I add baking powder and use melted butter for the shortening. You can substitute whole wheat flour or cornmeal for part of the flour. I like to use 1/3 c. cornmeal and 2/3 c. white flour. Make sure to let the pancake batter sit for a few minutes before frying in butter or bacon grease.

These were very good.  I do agree with those that said they tasted more like a "biscuit" type pancake.  Reminded me of pancakes made with Bisquick which is not a bad thing at all.  I would definitely make these again, but will only give four stars because they don't have that melt-in-your-mouth homemade taste.

I’ve made this recipe a few times now. I added a capful of vanilla flavoring and let the dough rest for a few minutes after mixing. They aren’t SUPER fluffy but they are really good pancakes and perfect for a meal in a pinch. Love them.

Really good and fluffy pancakes. I didn’t have butter or white vinegar on hand, so I used apple cider vinegar and vegetable oil. Regardless of the substitution my pancakes came out great! My two year old gobbled her pancakes up, and she is a picky eater

I needed a quick, easy pancake recipe that I could easily triple because I was cooking for three adults and seven children. This recipe was very helpful for giving a reference for the ratio of self-rising flour to milk. When I made it I used 4 cups of flour, 2 3/4 cups of milk, 1/2 cup of sugar, 4 eggs, and 1/4 cup of butter and it turned out awesome!!! Would definitely recommend this recipe to others. We ate them with applesauce on top.
Update: Our family has grown and so has the recipe! I’ve  put the notes here so I can easily find them again!!
6 1/4  cups self rising flour 
4 cups milk
6 eggs 
1/2cup butter
3/4 cup sugar

All the times I've made them they have been good. If they turn out rubbery, your only suppose to flip once, if they turn out greasy, add less butter or whatever you use to make it not stick. And I have even made it without the oil and it turned out well. So try it with or without the oil. At the same time you need to add a little more flour to make them thicker.

I used regular flour, but added 1.5 tsp baking powder and .5 tsp salt for every cup of flour.  Instead of oil, I used applesauce, and for fun I added a little cinnamon and vanilla.  While frying, I added a few 6 - 7 chocolate chips -- the family favorite.  They hit the spot! yum!

A frugal recipe for a rainy day!I always have all-purpose flour on hand so I had to add 1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon salt for fluff & for flare I add 2 teaspoons of Vanilla Extract, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. My kids loved it!

This was the first time I ever made any kind of pancakes in my life. With no first-hand experience, I used this recipe, and they came out nicely. I don't know if people are using the wrong kind of flour or what, but this recipe gets a thumbs up from me.

Very quick and easy!  I didn't have self rising flour so I just used all-purpose flour and added 1 1/4tsp baking powder, and 1/2tsp salt!!!  I added blueberries (I put sugar over them so they would be sweeter and have some juice to them) but I also like to add walnuts and bananas or strawberries.  Just make sure to let the berries sit in some sugar.  They will taste better in the pancakes!

this is fast, easy and I didn't get laughed at by my family! And Amber is correct, if you add 1 cup of regular flour, add 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking soda and a pinch of salt. mine were perfect!!

this recepie was great! super easy and great taste. I did use the suggestion of another review and added 1/4 cup more of flour (it is important to use self rising flour in this recepie) and I used low fat milk, annd the pankacas turned out light and right textured!

If you don't use self rising flour they can not turn out fluffy!!!!

Don't rate this recipe if you don't use the required ingredients!!!!

This is an easy and fast working recipe. I never have self rising flour, can't get that over here so I use all purpose flour and a 1 1/4 teaspoon baking powder and 1/8 teaspoon of salt. This makes a great substitute for self rising flour, it's basically the same.

I make those all the time, it only takes a few minutes to mix and I usually let it sit for just a few minutes until I'm done with my morning routines, by the time I'm done I just stir it one more time and start cooking. Everyone loves these pancakes with pear sirup or just plain maple and a little butter :)

I dont know what I did wrong. They felt and looked like play dough! I like light fluffy pancakes. They were thick and pretty much tasteless (and I added vin.) I gave it two stars instead of one because with enough maple syrup we ate them. I will probley try them again with adding bakeing powder and maybe some other things.

These were ok.  Like other reviewers have stated they don't have much flavor on their own but I always top mine with butter and syrup so that made up for it.  Flat pancakes are easier for me to cook as I always end up with raw centers with thicker pancakes.  Making pancakes is one of many things I just can not perfect, these were fully done so that was nice!

I had to make my own self-rising flour according to the recipe I found online.  With that said, the pancakes turned out just OK.  They were fairly dry, even with syrup.  Their saving grace was that I added blueberries, which added moisture.  I don't think I will make this recipe again, but I learned how to make self-rising flour in case I ever need to again.

I used all purpose flour, but added in some baking powder and salt to compensate.  While they weren't fluffy, sometimes I like my pancakes flat and the kids loved them.  I doubled the recipe and they were gone within 10 minutes!

This recipe was mediocre.  The pancakes weren't horrible but I am not left thinking I'll make it again either.  I thought the pancakes were pretty bland and I even added vanilla.  They also didn't rise as much as I would have liked.  Will probably look for a buttermilk pancake recipe next time.

This is a very good basic recipe. If you don't have any self-rising flour, just add a teaspoon each of baking powder and baking soda. Also 1 Tablespoon of sugar will help them brown nicely!

Easy and Great Recipe!  I only had all purpose flour so I added 1/2 tsp. salt, 1 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, and 2 tbsp. sugar. Also I only used 1 tbsp of oil. It was enough for 10 pancakes.  My son say's "yummy"!

I made some changes to this recipe and my pancakes turned out GREAT! They were so good that I ate them without any syrup added. The changes are the following: 1 cup all-purpose flour instead of self-rising flour; 2 full tbsp vanilla flavored baking powder; 1 full tsp white sugar; I used extra virgin home-made olive oil, maybe that's what made them taste so great!

Decent recipe. Just made it this morning. Written as is....consistancy of the pancake resembles more of a crepe/thin pancake.  Still good....but it is a thinner pancake.  If wanted thicker...decrease milk/add flour...or just use another recipe.  But as is....ok..just thin.

Pretty good recipe, I made some changes though as per other reviewer's suggestions.  Added 1 tsp of vanilla extract to the batter, as well as a little white sugar...between 1-2 tbsp or so.  Didn't have self-rising flour, so instead used all purpose flour, and added 1/4 tsp salt and 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder.  These made REALLY light and super-fluffy pancakes, so much so that I considered thinning the batter out a little, but seeing as nobody else was bothered by the thickness of the pancake I left it alone.  Good recipe!

I love these pancakes!! I usually add a little sugar and a little vanilla to make them more flavorful but they really don't need it. I have also incorporated whole wheat flour into the mix for a healthier version and my kids and husband still eat them up!!

Very Easy, as long as you use Self Rising Flour.. I also cook them on a med hot griddle with extra oil. Fries the edges of the pancake and makes them very crispy.

I don't know why so many people are saying that these pancakes are flat and greasy. These were the greatest pancakes and my 9 yr old daughter made them. We doubled the recipe since we have a rather large family. We used the self rising flour and 1/2 tbsp of baking powder but I am not sure the baking powder was even needed. They were fluffy and delicious!

Use the self rising flour and not all purpose; the difference is the difference between an actual pancake and crepes.  I used all purpose and ended up with crepes instead.  They still tasted yummy but were definitely NOT what I was wanting or expecting.

This is a great recipe if you want thick fluffy pancakes. It needs sugar and vanilla like the others posted.  For the reviewers who got flat, rubbery pancakes my guess would be that they did not use self-rising flour.  This is a kid pleaser!

I'm giving this three stars because I made my own 'self-rising' flour.  As far as taste and rise, they were only 1 star. The pancakes were flat. No rise at all. I ended up having to add about 1 1/2 tsp. more baking powder to get a decent lift.

Thank you for this simple recipe! My Mom gave me this recipe when I got married and I must have lost it. They're perfectly fluffy and so good you could almost eat them without syrup.  I too added about a teaspoon of vanilla and use the self-rising flour!  WONDERFUL

I will never make pancakes out of the box again. This recipie was so simple and the pancakes turned out great. I added a splash of vanilla extract and a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg. My kids devoured them, my one year old is still chowing down!

Oh my gosh! This is to die for. I threw in 3 tsp of sugar and some chocolate chips and we didn't even need syrup. My toddler LOVED these pancakes. I used the recipe for self rising flour (found on this site) and will never go back to buying the boxed stuff again. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would. Light, fluffy,and just plain old good!

These pancakes were delicious. We added 1 1/2 t of cinnamon and 1 D vanilla. We used pure plain flour so put in 1/2 t salt and 1 1/2 tsp baking powder. very tasty and just as easy as from the packet. After all, if you look on the ingredients in a pancake mix, it's usually just flour, baking powder, salt and occasionally powdered egg and flavouring.

Great quick recipe.  Using self rising flour is the key.  I may use a little sweetner next time for my personal taste.

I'd like to preface this review with the fact that I did use self-rising flour.  The only change I made was that I used buttermilk instead of regular. They tasted pretty bad--too salty and didn't have the spongy/fluffy texture regular pancakes do. To the last few, I added a bit of sugar and that seemed to improve the taste a bit, but overall, they weren't very good, browned too quickly, and stuck too easily to the pan.  Sorry, I'll stick to regular pancakes.

We've tried a couple of pancakes recipes but this one so far has been the best and not to mention the quickest.  We used the self rising flour but didn't have a sifter so we used a whisk to break it up.  I put in 1 small pack of Splenda. (My hubby always adds Cinnamon to his).  This was good, I'll definitely use it again. *Second time I made this I used all purpose flour and had to add 2.5 tsp of baking soda, 1/2 salt to make it rise.  I also added a cap full of Vanilla, and half cap of Maple.  I also added a packet of splenda and topped with honey!  great!

These were perfect!  Just good, plain pancakes - nothing fancy. I read some of the other reviews first and decided to add my milk a bit at a time until the batter was the right consistency.  1 cup would have been too much - I ended up using only about 2/3 cup (skim milk).  They turned out great!  Would have given 5 stars if the recipe had not needed altering...but that was no big deal. Thanks.

Wonderful with a few changes. I wanted to make my health pancakes and had no buttermilk. So I made a double batch of these pancakes. 2c flour, 1 T baking powder, 1 t salt, 2 eggs, 2 T oil, 2c milk, 2eggs, 2T sugar and 1 t vanilla. Made them on a griddle and they made PERFECT circles and were ready to flip very quickly. The taste was awesome! These will be a staple for school mornings when Im short on time!

If you are looking for fluffy, tasty pancakes this recipe isn't it.  At least not as written.  I did follow the directions as written including using self-rising flour.  I ended up with pancakes that were only slightly fluffier than a thin crepe.  For the second bunch in the pan we added sugar and vanilla and still didn't improve the flavor.  If you are going to make this, you may want to read the reviews and try the suggestions made in them.

This was super easy and delicious, I added 1 tsp of sugar and
 1 tsp of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon. Using a 1/4 c, it made 8 pancakes that my 2 yr old and I devoured!!
 Will definitely use this recipe again.

Horrible! Unleavened with a terrible texture. Even with baking soda added, they are far from fluffy. This one needs some work. Sorry.

they had an okay taste but were pretty plain; I added about 1/2 tablespoon of sugar. They also turned out really flat. I added a half teaspoon of baking powder to the mix after I made the first two pancakes.

I did as one person remarked.  I substitued the honey for th e oil and added baking powder and my youngest daughter told me they tasted just like normal.  So it worked for me.  Thanks for sharing.

I used the suggestions to substitute honey for the oil and to add baking powder.  Great flavor.  The kids cleaned their plates, which didn't often happen with store bought mix.

The flattest, blandest pancakes I’ve ever had.  I noticed right away something Was wrong so I added sugar and baking powder. It helped but I definitely won’t be using this recipe again.

The batter was thin and very lumpy. I tried to smooth it out but it was still lumpy. The pancakes were more like crepes instead of pancakes. Will not make them again. I did add a 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder with little results.

The base is a great start had a larger crowd 5 kids so I doubled the flour 2cups and milk 2 cups used 2-3 tbsp of plain sugar 1tsp of vanilla and banana extract for a different flavor profile and 2tsp of baking powder. Instead of oil, I used 4tbsp of margarine and they came out great kids loved them. I definitely recommend adding at least the sugar and vanilla as they otherwise taste very doughy in my opinion. But as I said base is great takes add-ins well.

I am an experienced cook and I was skeptical going into this recipe because it seemed like a lot of liquid for the amount of flour—and it was.  BUT, I didn’t have time for my traditional homemade buttermilk pancakes and needed a quick, easy alternative.  The batter (made as listed) was WAY too runny to cook.  I added more flour, then more, until the extra I added probably totaled an additional 1/2 cup.  Still pretty runny, but I went with it because (at this point) my pancake batter was already getting over-mixed and that in itself makes for flat pancakes.  These turned out okay—not great, but my kids liked them pretty well and that’s what mattered.  Not too flat, but definitely not big and fluffy either.  If you’re using this recipe, save your batter from over-mixing and just go ahead and add the extra 1/2 cup of flour from the get-go.  I may use this again in a pinch if I need something quick and easy (like this morning), but that would be the only reason.

I made a couple changes to jazz them up a little. I added a table spoon of sugar and a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. They taste fantastic every time. And they’re super simple and fast to make.

With a couple of changes, i will never go back to buying pancake mix again!  Not sure if my changes made difference in fluffiness or not— i used soft winter wheat SR flour (what i keep on hand for biscuit making), added T sugar, and used buttermilk.  This turned out the best, fluffiest pancakes I have ever made!  Why have I been wasting $ and pantry space on mix??  This will be my recipe from now on!

Subsituted flour with all purpose flour added in some baking powder used evaporated milk instead of regular milk and followed recipe otherwise and ended up with some the best pancakes ever. The pancakes sure did rise up and get fluffy as I was hoping to accomplish as well. I’ll never buy pancake mix from the store again. I doubled the recipe also and was 3 tbsp of baking powder which I know was probably a little excessive on the baking powder but that’s the way I like it.

These were very heavy & flat. not sure what they needed, maybe baking soda or baking powder. definitely could've used salt & sugar. It seemed almost like eating really thick crepes.

OK, so I thought all purpose flour had the same capacity as self-rising flour and I was wrong. This pancake was flat and greasy. It had no taste to it at all and I even added sugar & cinnamon to it. It just taste like solidified flour. Next time I won't be so lazy and just make the other buttermilk version instead.

I had to add 1/2 cup more flour. I think 1 to 1 flour to milk is too runny. Turned out well with more flour.

turned out great! they're a little runny but still rose just fine. added a little more flour to my next batch though. If you don't like this recipe maybe you're not using self rising flour like called for in the ingredients?

So easy and good! Followed the recipe, except added 1 tsp vanilla. Let batter sit about 5 minutes, while the griddle was heating. Doubled the recipe and used 1/4 c scoop, it made 12-14. Lost count due to taste testing!

Had to mention this recipe is for self rising flour.
I had some on hand and it turns out great.
I did not add anything just to verify outcome.
Quick and easy results great light pancakes.

I have made these pancakes for years. I add a little extra milk to thin them out a little (my hubby likes thin pancakes) and I add a 1/2 cup of unsweetened apple sauce but I also double the recipe. The apple sauce adds a little sweetness to the pancakes. Sometimes I add some vanilla also.

I added a little vanilla.   They were good!   Like others have said, I think the one star voters who say they were flat and rubbery used regular flour.   They worked fine for me.

This is a great recipe for pancakes if you don't have All-Purpose Flour which my family doesn't use that much. I didn't use a griddle since we don't have one, but instead did it on a frying pan with Canola Oil. It turned out pretty good, then I decked it out with Maple Syrup and a small piece of Butter. I give it 5 Stars.

This recipe is terrible. Pancakes turn out flat and a bit greasy, mostly tasting like flour. I don’t recommend.

Used all purpose flour instead with 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoons of salt. Turned out great!

Tried this as it was a quick, simple recipe and I had all the ingredients on-hand. I did add @3 drops of real vanilla extract (may need more of the fake stuff). These came out pretty good. Next time I may try adding the 1/2 tablespoon baking powder mentioned in another review.

Fat, fluffy pancakes by tweaking given recipe: I made my own self-rising flour, added 2tsp of sugar. Instead of 1C of milk, I whisked the egg and vanilla  extract and then added enough milk to make all three ingredients =1C of liquid.  I think I've finally found my pancake recipe

I made them using self rise flour. They were a little flat but they were good. I wasn't able to sift flour as I don't have a sifter. I will be purchasing one as I understand the need now. I will keep this recipe in my favorites.

I thought that this was an excellent recipe for my first  scratch pancake. The batter was thicker than I expected and I couldn't get it to cook all the way through. I think that next time I will add a bit more milk .

these are very bland and very floury tasting.  I have made many homemade pancake recipes before all super wonderful, and even with butter and heavy syrup poured all over the entire plate they still tasted disgusting. I dusted some cocoa powder on them and made them tolerable, but not a good recipe If you just want plain pancakes and syrup

This is PHENOMENAL. If I could give it 6 stars I would. It was perfect just the way it was written without deviating from the recipe. If you want to add a little tang, I do recommend adding a little bit of lemon juice and lemon zest.

I made these(exactly to the recipe)(and yes-with self rising flour) once using regular milk-were pretty bland, not very fluffy. So we replaced with buttermilk and tried again- those were very fluffy- but disgusting. Like eating straight buttermilk. This isn't a good recipe.  We had to add a lot to make it work.

SELF-RISING FLOUR.  All these bad reviews make me suspicious.   Did you use self-rising flour or just regular flour? Was your self-rising flour old? I followed this simple recipe except adding butter instead of oil & a tiny pinch of salt. My first one didn't rise that much but did a little. Then *ting* duh, my flour is like two years old! I then added (seriously) 1/16 of a tsp of baking powder. Boom! Beautiful pancakes. I did post a picture. If you want to see the height.Blue plate fork sticking out of the top one.

These turned out pretty good and it's a simple recipe. I was out of oil so I substituted an equal amount of unsweetened apple sauce. I also threw in a handful of chocolate chips 
Make sure you use self rising flour!!

Ignore the negative reviews, if you follow the recipe you will get fluffy, moist pancakes every time. The reviews that complain about flat greasy pancakes are the same reviews that say they used all-purpose flour. What do you expect if you don't use any leavening agent? That's why the recipe states use "Self-Rising Flour". This is my new go to pancake recipe! 5 Star!! Try adding a Tbs of sugar to sweeten them a touch.

I read all the comments so I had to try it. These pancakes were liked by my whole family. They were fluffy. The key is to use SELF RISING  flour not all purpose. It  found the flour at a whole food store as I had trouble finding it at regular grocery stores. I added a little vanilla and cinnamon.

They were ok pancakes and good to do quickly. They were not sweet, and they probably wouldn't be good without syrup or chocolate chips. I would recommend adding more flour because they were very liquid.

A great starting recipe to build a pancake with all your favorite ingredients. I like to add flax meal, bran, honey and cinnamon. Sometimes I like to add peanut powder or fresh fruit.

Pancakes tasted great. I made mini pancakes because there isn't very much mix. It made 9 mini pancakes. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla essence. Delicious. Will make again.

Fast and easy! I followed the directions exactly and folded in blueberries and cinnamon. Since these pancakes aren't sweet, they'd be great for spinach pancakes, too, if you're into that sort of thing.

I used all-purpose flour and eggnog instead of milk. Added a tad more oil due to the eggnog thickness. And voila! A delicious crepe type!

I just made these for the first time, following the recommendations of stopsz and LadyOfMarine to make my own self-rising flour (1c. flour + 1.5tsp. baking powder + .5tsp. salt), and they came out great! I may have had a rounded measurement of flour, however that was in keeping with what a few reviewers stated they intentionally did for thickness, so I didn't mind too much.  They were not too thin, the batter stayed in place in the pan, and I think they have a good simple pancake flavor.  Very similar to pancakes I had as a kid when we ran out of name brand box mix.  Thanks for the recipe!

The recipe is nice because it only has a few ingredients and doesn't take long to make.  Because of this though if you don't add a couple of things to add flavor (I used vanilla and cinnamon) it is kind of bland.  They did rise but don't expect a very tall, fluffy pancake - if that's what you're looking for you will probably need to search for a different recipe.

I followed the directions almost exactly except I added an additional 1/8-1/4 cup flour for a thicker batter. They turned out wonderful and fluffy. I think maybe some aren't using self-rising flour. Very good recipe.

I use regular flour and it works perfect. I've replace the milk with almond milk with the same fluffy results. My daughter can't have wheat, she uses the gluten free flour and they're delicious. This recipe is the best pancake recipe I've ever used.

Nice and fluffy! Make sure to use *self rising flour* and DON'T over mix. My first few  puffed up while bubbles formed before I flipped. I mixed the batter before pouring each pancake, though, and the last few were dense and rubbery. For people who were sure they used self rising flour but still ended up with flat pancakes, I think you over mixed the batter!  It should be thick and a bit lumpy. The little lumps are fine! You won't have balls of dry flour in your pancakes. If your batter is loose and smooth, add in some more self rising flour to thicken it up. Hint: I added 2-3 tbs of sugar, apple pie spice and a dash of vanilla extract for a great basic pancake.

These are awesome, the people saying they're tasteless and flat obviously didn't use SELF-RISING flour so had no leavening.
Like others, I added a little vanilla, and they're great.  My kids asked for a second batch, and they're super finicky.  Going in with my family recipes to be handed down to my children. :)

my husband and I doubled this recipe (four GENEROUS helpings) we used lt cream instead of milk, put in one-quarter of the oil and added a tbl of sugar with the liquid ingredients; it was SO SO good!!  We like thinner pancakes as well as fluffier ones, and weren't worried about the amount of "fluff/flatness" however, the self rising flour has leavening in it an the pancakes were a kinda medium rise and not too dense.

I added about a half cup more flour to the batter because I like thicker pancakes. They were perfect!

Just made it. My 1 yr old nephew didn't like strawberries and so I needed a way to get him to eat it. I made this for dinner. I added some sugar, about a tablespoon and 2 tsp of vanilla extract and I mixed in the chopped strawberries that were mixed with a little sugar and it came out perfect. My nephew ate everything on his plate. I used self-rising flour which I normally don't have but it came out perfectly. Didn't have to add flour or milk. Fluffy and good. I'm passing this on to my daughter.

Fantastic recipe! I was hesitant to use one that called for vinegar so I opted to try this. I followed what another commentor mentioned, and used 1/2 tablespoon of baking powder, as I do not have self rising flower. I also added 1 tbs of cinnamon, 2tbs of sugar, and a tiny shot (didn't measure) of vanilla. It was a bit thin so I dropped in 2 heaping spoons of flower and it was prefect. Added fresh raspberries and chocolate chips.  So. Delicious. 

Will be my go-to recipe for pancakes now, thank you!

These were very good.  Soft, moderately fluffy,  and certainly not greasy.

Just a heads up for heating. So u don't get any burnt cakes. Start at medium and once it's warm reduce to medium low while cooking. Mind u everyone has different stoves so take that into consideration

I mixed up the ingredients and the batter was pretty thin.  So, I added about 1/4 cp. more flour.  I also added a little sugar and vanilla extract.  The pancakes turned out wonderful!  They were tender, fluffy and delicious.  Overall good basic recipe but does need tweaking.

I only had all purpose flour, so I added 1 1/4 teaspoons of baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon of salt 
Turned out great---fluffy and yummy. Might try playing with different flavors since this is such a good base!

Windkitten's adjustment below was perfect for me.  I made the recipe as written the first time and added baking powder and sugar the next time.  It's an easy and really good recipe for pancakes.

Just made these, they were great! I think people saying it was flat or greasy definitely didn't use self rising flour. I added a bit of cinnamon, sugar and banana slices to mine. I also used vanilla flavored coconut milk (So Delicious brand) because my son is allergic to dairy. I think they would've been great even without the modifications I made so I'm giving it 5 stars! Yummy

Great recipe when all you have is self-rising flour.  If your pancakes came out too thin, you either used all-purpose flour or over-mixed the batter.

Man look…… I love this recipe.  So did my family.  My only alteration was to use butter on the griddle. Im not sure why anyone is messing this up but it may be because you are not using a griddle. This recipe was perfect just the way it is and not time consuming at all. You have to make sure you sift the flour and mix the other ingredients together then add to the flour. I used some honey walnuts bananas, blue berries and strawberries to top it. Man Awwwwsome. Thank you for sharing because I always did it the long way.

This was a nice base recipe. It was ridiculously thin at first, and had no taste. I added 2 tsp. of Vanilla extract, 2 tsp. of cinnamon, and about 3/4 cup more of the rising flour. Quite good, after all that.

Couldn't find my favorite family recipe, so I turned to Allrecipes. Found this one. I just happened to have self-rising flour I had bought for another recipe. I substituted melted butter for the oil and took the advice of others and added a couple of tablespoons of sugar and vanilla. Cooked them on my new griddle along with bacon and eggs and served my husband a great breakfast. The pancakes were great - and SO easy. A definite keeper!

Yummy!  I was looking for an easy pancake recipe that used self-rising flour and these filled the bill.  On the griddle in 5 minutes. Very easy and delicious. Might try adding some vanilla next time.  :)

Tried this recipe this morning. Added about 2 tsp. of sugar and 1 tablespoon of lemon extract. Also, added an extra 1/4 cup of self-rising flour..(I like my pancakes a little thicker). Topped the pancakes with blueberries while batter was in pan. The pancakes came out perfect! 
In regards to others comments on here about flat...rubbery pancakes. Make sure your flour isn't old if using self-rising flour. Leavening agents can lose potency. If you are using all-purpose flour you need to add baking powder otherwise your pancakes will be flat everytime.

My family was wanting pancakes for supper so I make these. I followed as the recipe shows, then added a tsp of baking powder and some vanilla powder for some flavor. The batter was incredibly thick and impossible to ladle out to put on the griddle so I added more milk to thin it out. These pancakes did not change color at all while cooking, they were a bland white color.  We bit into them, and they weren't cooked all the way through so I threw them back on the griddle and they wouldn't cook anymore. They're very doughy and rubbery. Not a good pancake!

I use this recipe all the time.  First time I tried it though they were flat and greasy even though I used self-rising flour. So, I tried 1 tsp. baking soda in mix along with cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. of vanilla.  Yum. Now I make a double batch and freeze them by threes.  Defrost the night before, spread them out on a plate then microwave them 30 seconds or less on each side for a quick treat for the kids.
 PS I only use 1/2 of the oil recommended

This worked great. I didn't have anything but selfrising flour and found this. My tester pancake turned out a bit thin BUT to remedy it, I just added another about 1/4 - 1/2 of flour to thicken it up and it got to be very fluffy and delicious.

The seemed a bit bland to me, because I'm used to having a sweet cake like pancake (so I added a dash of salt and sugar). But this is a great base for pancakes. You can add anything to it and make it your own.

Great! Sprinkled them with frozen whole cranberries and dark chocolate chip before turning them for an extra treat, ya' know just in case having pancakes wasn't enough! MUST use self rising flour or doctor up the AP variety tho!! Noticed some folks said it was thin so I skipped the sifting and left the measuring cup slightly rounded. Tall and fluffy and gone! Will make again.

Fantastic recipe! I had never made pancakes from scratch before and so was looking for a simple recipe when I stumbled upon this one. I did, however, use 1 cup of sweetened vanilla almond milk instead of regular milk and olive oil instead of vegetable oil, as that is what I had on-hand. Fluffiest pancakes I've ever had! And the almond milk sweetened them up just enough and added a bit of vanilla flavor. But overall, I love this recipe! This is definitely a keeper!

Although I didn't care too much for it, my 7 year-old really liked it. It was definitely not fluffy, just flat but soft. I prefer fluffy pancakes so if your preference is flat pancakes, you might like it.

This recipe was awful. Gagging while eating them. I may as well have ate rubber for breakfast. I also would give this 0 stars.

Good, fast and EASY, but a little on the thin side for me.  I like that there are only 4 ingredients!  I've got all those things, all the time.  Yay!  I used skim milk, because that's what I had, but next time I will use a bit less liquid.

Loved it and super easy! I used self rising flour, and sifted it, as the directions stated. I didn't use a griddle, but used a regular skillet (but waited until the water splattered loudly, per the directions). These came out great. Only modification: used about 1-1/2 tbsp. vegetable oil instead of 2, and added some vanilla, sugar and cinnamon to the batter.

This is a quick basic recipe. I don't normally have self rising flour so I add baking powder to the flour so the pancakes are not flat. (You add 1tsp per 1 cup of flour, or more if you want thicker pancakes).  Then I add some sugar and vanilla extract. My whole family loves them and it is still a pretty basic recipe. I add a bit more flour to all of it to compensate for the extra liquids and keep it thick.

Made the pancakes for breakfast for my little grandchildren.  I did not have self-rising flour so I looked up a substitute recipe for it.  Mixed all the ingredients together and left some lumps in the batter. I let the batter rest for about 5 minutes.  The pancakes were not real fluffy but the flavor was simply delicious.  Who needs a boxed pancake mix when you can make them from scratch.

Guys, this recipe calls for SELF-RISING flour, which has rising agents already in. If you use ordinary all-purpose flour, then of course the result will be thin as paper. We used self-rising flour for this recipe and the results were delicious - easy to stack, not too cake-y, and tasty. Will make these again.

I tried this recipe and they came out beautifully! The picture given does not look anyting like mine! They were fluffy, and tasted great! I did add about 1/4 c. more flour, more or less. I only mixed until small lumps remained. Mixed by hand, so as not to over mix. Also, I put flour in bowl, added milk, added unbeaten egg, oil, then mixed. I poured mixture into oiled iron skillet on medium high heat. Waited till bubbles appeared and edges looked brown then turned. I adjusted heat as needed. My husband kept saying how good they tasted. He ate all of his and what I had left!

Its an okay base. I agree there is too much oil. Made a tonne of changes and ended up with something completely different. Great to get started with a DIY mix.

Thank God for this quick and easy recipe! My 3 year old just loves pancakes and she woke up this morning asking for them. I was out of pancake mix so, wanting to avoid a breakfast tantrum, I started looking for a recipe. These pancakes are delicious and so easy to make. I don't think I will even bother buying pancake mix again. I'll just use this recipe from now on. I did not have self-rising flour, so I added a teaspoon of baking powder. Delicious! And my 3 year old agrees!

This is the exact recipe my grandma gave me to make pancakes when I was little. I've always loved them! However, my family and I usually add a bit of vanilla extract and some blueberries to the mix, just for some flavor. I've never had a problem with how they turn out, so I'm not sure what's going on with some of the other recipes people have tried.

This is a great recipe and I don't even like pancakes!  I changed a few things - substituted milk for dairy substitute (hazelnut milk), omitted the oil, added 1 TBS sugar and two splashes of vanilla.  Perfection!  Big, fluffy, delicious.  My husband is now in a pancakecoma.

As it is, it's not a "great" recipe. You just have to make some additions. Yes, if you use all purpose flour, add  baking soda. I also added sugar, vanilla and some lemon juice. They will be yum!

I'm not sure how some of the others were getting flat, rubbery pancakes, but these turned out wonderful for me.  The only thing I did different was add some vanilla extract and some sugar.  Otherwise I followed it as is, and we had nice fluffy pancakes!

These pancakes came out really flat, even after I added pre-made pancake mix to the recipe.  They were also not very sweet.  I had to add a ton of syrup, powdered sugar, and chocolate chips to make up for the taste.

I made these this morning after realizing I didn't buy another box of mix. They came out great. I, like others, added a capful of vanilla extract. They rose fine and were better than the ones from the mix. I won't be buying the mix anymore. DO NOT use straight all purpose flour- that will lead to the non-rising issue. Thanks for the recipe.

I like this recipe b/c it is simple and quick to make.  I have tried a variety of add-ins for flavor, including pecans, cocoa and peanut butter.

I was looking for a simple recipe for pancakes and this one turned out great!!!! Although I used condensed milk instead of regular non-fat milk and they turned out sooooooo goooood, I highly recommend this. Thanks for putting out the tip on using self-rising flour, that is pretty important! Anyway, try it with the condensed milk, it superb!

I followed the recipe except I added 2 t. vanilla, 1 t. cinnamon, and about 1/8 c. more flour.  They were flat, not fluffy.  A little "tough".  I used my brand new griddle set at 400 degrees.  I didnt't think they would ever turn brown.  Next time I guess I will just use Bisquick.

I love this recipe, it's fast and does great for me. I add just a tad less milk then what it calls for and for personal taste a tsp of vanilla, but they rise wonderfully and the kids love them! Thanks for the recipe!

I was pleasantly surprised by the way these pancakes turned out. I substituted soy milk, and added a teaspoon of vanilla, as well as some chopped pecans. Would make this recipe again.

These ARE really good pancakes!  I never had pancakes this fluffy before.  I did use 1 1/2 eggs,  but with a dash of vanilla and maybe a tsp sugar next time,  they will be more perfect.  And sooo easy! Some of the reviewers probably forgot to SIFT the flour...this would result in much flatter pancakes.  This is a great starting point for your own creativity :)
Thanks for sharing!

Make sure you use self-rising flour!  These were very tasty and light.  This replaces my box mix unless the kids are cooking!

It was OK. It was kind of boring, try adding things like vanilla or cinnimon (not to much or else it tastes like toothpate) enjoy

I definitely recommend adding the sugar, honey, and baking powder, and leaving out the vegetable oil. It is definitely not a fluffy pancake recipe, but it's great to be able to make pancakes with things I have up in the cupboards. My picky 19 month old daughter ate 2 pancakes and I had a couple myself. They weren't bad, just not great. It will do til I go out and buy a box of pancake mix.

I accidentally added the oil without reading the reviews. But adding vanilla and baking powder in addition to the oil was good. I put more flour to make the pancakes thicker but they were a bit too thick.

Definitely recommend adding chocolate chips & topping with cool whip & strawberries! Delicious!

A very quick and easy recipe that made fluffy golden pancakes, but, of course I used it mostly as a base.  I only used 3/4 c. milk (as I ran out), scooped in roughly 2 tbsp. of sour cream and quickly added 1/4 c. sugar, and did not use the oil in the batter.  I let the batter sit for a just few minutes and then made big and small, perfect pancakes.

Good basic recipe, a little bland but my 3 year old loved them and he wanted pancakes this morning and I had all of these ingredients on hand. It helped me out in a pinch.

These really came through for me in a pinch this morning. Fast, uncomplicated, and the kids liked them well enough. They are a little bland, but syrup fixes that right up.

These are good.  I omitted the oil, and added a few drops of honey,as other reviewers said. I added more baking powder than others, 1/2 tablespoon.  These were quick and easy.  I made 2 separate batches, so you may want to double it for 3 maybe 4 pancakes per per person.  Thanks for the quick fix for a fast full!
