Very delicious, tastes almost like a cinnamon roll. I replaced the stevia with a stevia and erythritol blend.

A tasty drink for a cool autumn night. Very easy to make and quick to prepare.  The only change I would make (and this is a personal preference) is to greatly decrease the sweetener as 1 tbsp is a lot.  You could also just add all the ingredients at once before heating.  Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!
