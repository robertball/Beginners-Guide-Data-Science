I am always kind of amused by the reviews that say, "this recipe was great!  I made it just like it says, except I changed t five of the main ingredients..."   So when I say, "this recipe was great!  Except I changed..." I am laughing at myself as well.     I changed the spaghetti to bow tie pasta, and since I didn't have any pesto handy, I substituted a tomato and basil bruschetta instead.  And it was stlil delicious!  Perhaps that is the mark of a great basic recipe--it can stand up to tinkering.

I cut the recipe in half as it was just me for lunch, I too used whole wheat spaghetti but I used a piece of leftover grilled salmon instead of canned. I did use pesto (Simple Garlic and Basil Pesto from this site) & it added such freshness & flavor....next tiem I will double the pesto. I minced my onions up real small because while I wanted the flavor, I didn't want chunks. After it was done & plated, I squeezed some lemon juice on it & sprinkled it w/ some black pepper & I liked that so well that I hit it w/ some lemon pepper. What a healthy, flavorful & easy way to stretch  leftover salmon!

Verry yummy!!! I added waaay more pesto, spinach, and green bell pepper. Because I am watching my weight, we did not add the cheese and it was still very delish! We ate with penne pasta. This was also very quick to make which is great for me!

I could not get my family to eat salmon until this recipe...with a few adjustments. First, I use a fresh salmon steak, marinate it in Garlic Parmesan salad dressing for about an hour, then broil it about 10 minutes each side. Then flake it into the pasta. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe! A definite staple in this house now.

This dish was great! I used whole wheat pasta and instead of canned salmon I used thawed frozen fillets. I put them in a baking dish with some water and S & P in the oven for 15 minutes. Then cut it up and added it to the pasta when it was time. I also added some feash garlic. I would make this again, it was terrific.

I used the Simple Garlic and Basil Pesto recipe, as one reviewer suggested. Using the canned salmon made the recipe taste a little too fishy, not to mention time-consuming since I had to pick out fat, skin and bones from the meat before adding it in.  I would use fresh grilled salmon in the future. Still, the recipe was a big hit and reheated well. Very onion-ey, but I liked it that way. Using all that cheese made it especially yummy.

Great base recipe, and of course changed it a bit to our liking.  I added a bit more pesto, as well as a shake or two of Italian seasoning that seemed to give it just what it needed.  Also added a few drops of Sriracha chilli sauce (idea from Teena's Spicy Pesto Chicken on this site) when serving, and it was amazing!!  I'm not a huge fish fan, so this was a great way to get some fish in our diet w/out being able to to taste it too much.

So easy, and satisfying, the only little changes I made was to use fresh salmon and penne pasta as these were what I had on hand. Plus I added a few tablespoons of sliced black olives from a jar and cut back on the olive oil as the pesto already contains a large amount of it.

This was SO good. I didn't think it would be, but was trying it for the simplicity and health value, and I am amazed! I wanted to eat the whole thing! I used whole wheat spaghetti, the salmon in a pouch, and otherwise followed the recipe exactly. YUM! I can't wait to make it again.

This recipe is SO GOOD! I have to say it sounded gross at first (cheese & salmon, really?!), but coupled with the pesto sauce and noodles...mmmmm. Well worth making.

This is surprisingly delicious and easy. A great week night diner,but good enough for weekend company. The only change I made was to add some chicken stock to the sauce to moisten it up a bit. And of course a little garlic never hurt anything.....

This pasta was amazing!!  I used whole-wheat spaghetti (as we're trying to eat more whole-grains) which gave it a really full flavour.  I also used smoked salmon pieces as that's what I had on hand and it was de-licious!  This recipe is printed and stuck to my fridge cause we make it so often, yummmmmmmy!!!

I used baked salmon and skipped the onions because I didn't have any. I used more pesto than called for as well. This was pretty good! A different way to eat salmon, but I liked it.

Made exactly as recipe called, we all felt it was to dry.  Makes me rethink how I made it.  Will try to find a way to get it moister next time.

I absolutely loved this...but I will first say that I did not used canned salmon, I used 12 oz. of grilled salmon that we had left over.  I substituted Ronzoni Bow Tie pasta for spaghetti but everythng else I followed exactly and it was a wonderful meal.  The flavor is just splendid.  Thank you!

Kids raved about this one!  I did not have canned salmon so used frozen salmon instead & cooked it with the onion and pesto.  I added a grated zucchini 2 minutes before serving for a bit more nutrition, might try with grated carrot next time as well.  Thanks for this very quick recipe!

This turned out great as a cold salad.  I had leftover spaghetti noodles and salmon filet so just added the rest of the ingredients (except for the sweet onions) and added two fresh mushrooms I had (halved and sliced) and it turned out great.  Would definitely make again.

As is, this recipe is okay. I just could not get over the canned salmon.  I tried, I really did; but as I was picking through the canned salmon, I was grossed out.  So, I threw it out, and tried with frozen salmon.  Much better! Then I realized I really don't prefer pesto with salmon. However, this recipe as a base is pretty good.  It's easy to switch things out for personal preferance. I never thought to put salmon and parmesean cheese together, and that I DO like! Thanks for the idea :)

This recipe was great!  I cut the recipe in half and made a few changes:  1) I used sundried tomato pesto that I had in the fridge leftover from something else. 2) I had a frozen salmon filet in the freezer, so I just sprinkled that with lemon pepper, garlic powder, and salt, and baked it for 15 minutes instead of using the canned salmon. 3) I used penne instead of spaghetti.  The hubby declared it a Tier 1 dinner which means I can make it as often as I like! Delicious :o)

Even with leftover grilled salmon this dish was very dry and not really flavorful. I doubled the pesto, too! maybe a cream sauce base would be better.

This was a pretty bad recipe. I had my reservations, but the reviews were positive so I took a chance. My main issue was that it was really dry! I even doubled the pesto and it didn't help much.I wasn't sure what to add to give it more of a creamy consistency. Maybe Alfredo or a cheese sauce would be helpful?

This was good.  Not rock star good, but good.  We used fresh salmon steaks instead of canned.

Great for an easy, fast meal. Added 1/2 cup of pasta water, few handfuls of baby spinach, red pepper, 1 extra tablespoon pesto, 1 tsp garlic. Satisfying comfort food.

I made my own pesto sauce based upon a recipe I found on this site, which I used Kale instead of Spinach and 1% milk for half the oil. But other than that (which is just preference) this recipe was a great motivator! I used 3 cans salmon, and it gave such a rich and creamy flavor. Mmmm! I would recommend including a pesto recipe instead of just saying to use it, because you really need a good 2 cups of it per box of pasta, to make this dish moist and delicious. Thanks.

If you're still willing to give this recipe a go, I'd suggest adding quite a bit of pasta cooking water (at least 1 cup up to 3 cups) to the sauce because the other recipe reviewers are spot on: it is VERY dry. I tinkered and tinkered and ended up with something _somewhat_ edible. Will not make this again. Sorry.

If your pesto is not oily, you need to add more olive oil than called for to make sure this isn't dry. Try making your own pesto sauce instead of using premade. 

This was SO good. I used the pesto that I made myself and frozen earlier (I used the Pesto Sauce recipe by Sue Jurak. I added tomatoes just to make it look more zippy. WOW good!

SUPER EASY AND YUMMY.  I made this with thin spaghetti and used pouch salmon. (way better than canned).  I also added peas and a slash of white wine. Came out delicious! Good use of left over pesto and pasta I had laying around.

My family of four LOVED this dish. My 9 year old gave it 9.75 out of 10, and my 6 year old gave it a "100" out of 10. ;-).  I marinated defrosted salmon in Kinder's Garlic marinade for about 15 minutes (it's really strong, and it permeates the fish quickly). Then I broiled it. I had all ingredients on hand except the pesto. I "cheated" and bought Trader Joes basil pesto. I added tomatoes, as some reviewers had suggested. I had some cheese in the freezer that I had already shredded, but I don't know if it was asiago or parm? It worked whatever it was. The other tweak is that the only pasta I had on hand was angel hair and it worked fine (Barilla Plus for some extra protein). I definitely will make this again!

This is a very easy and quite good recipe. Everyone in the family liked it. I followed the recipe exactly. The only problem I had was that when I tried to mix the pasta with the "sauce" the salmon wanted to collect at the bottom of the bowl. We will be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.

So very easy and so very delicious. I used chopped onions and minced garlic and a 14.4 oz can of pink salmon and it turn out great! I also used linguini instead of spaghetti cause I thought a more sturdy pasta shape would be better.Add a green salad for a quick week night meal.

I have made this recipe several times now and it's always a winner!  Easy and as you can't really go wrong it's always tasty.  Occasionally I saute some mushrooms with the onion and add them in - mmmm!

I really liked this. It's a great way to get both fish and vegetables (boyfriend doesn't like fish, I don't like veggies besides onions and tomatoes) and it's quick to make, too. Our parmesan had gone bad, but even without the cheese this was good! Next time I think I'll try it with cheese - it's definitely something I will be making more of. It's very affordable on a student budget, too.

Pretty tasty. I changed it though.


I used my food chopper for everything. I minced 2 cloves of garlic and the onions, sauteed in a tablespoon of butter, then added olive oil. Added a whole container of pesto, then the salmon. I also minced a fresh tomato and added them to the noodles. I then added sour cream to my pesto/salmon mixture, and tossed it all together.

BEST SALMON EVER!!! The pesto must be good for this to be good.  Avoid store bought pesto.
We loved this recipe and have made it several times.  I used the Simple Garlic & Basil Pesto recipe found on this site.
I did add a half of a tomatoe - diced. Using shredded parmesan cheese instead of the stuff in a can enhances the flavor as well.  Great stuff!
This is great with chicken as well.  If you make it with chicken, add the chicken to the pan first with some olive oil and cook for 10 minutes before adding the onion and basil pesto.  If you add the onion and basil pesto first, it gets dry and looses flavor by the time the chicken has cooked.

Made this tonight.   Followed recipe as written.   I am not a novice cook but on busy nights I do look for easy to prepare recipes.  I honestly did not like this recipe at all.  Love salmon and love pesto but did not like the combo.  The recipe is easy to follow and uses items most people have on hand.  If you enjoy this mix of flavors then you will love this recipe.

I made this with pouch salmon and added several dollops of sour cream for smoothness.  Many have commented on how dry it is - definitely omit the parmesan cheese at the end, that's what's making the dish so dry.  Also, I think this would be better served with bow tie pasta.

I am always searching for a new salmon recipe for my husband. I asked him how he liked this one and he said "good"....but I think after watching him refill his plate three times, it's better than good! I used vidalia onions and left out the green onions, only because I forgot to pick them up at the store. I also used whole wheat pasta, and salmon fillets in place of the canned salmon and Smart Balance Omega oil. Another keeper for my recipe box!

This is very good, and a nice change from the tuna casserole.  However, I thought the flavors were really pungent, and would benefit from adding additional veggies.  Maybe zucchini, broccoli? I'll try it next time, but it's definitely a delicious starting point.

Flavor wasn't bad, I doubled the olive oil and pesto as recommended by other reviewers, I also added garlic and tomato, but the texture of the sauce was horrid!  It was like sticky lumpy cheese with onions sticking out of it.  And the tinned salmon was disgusting to go through.  I will not be making this again.

Incredibly easy and delicious. Used whole wheat spaghetti, but I think shells might be better next time. I also Minced red onion instead of sweet, added a tablespoon of roasted garlic, and  added some chopped asparagus. Amazing.

This recipe is FABULOUS. I used medium shells instead of spaghetti, simply because it's easier to eat. And I was about to reheat some leftovers of it but after one quick cold bite realized ITS GREAT REFRIGERATED TOO! This is the perfect dish!

A absolute hit with husband and teenage son. Didn't even attempt canned salmon and used extra olive oil and pesto as well as lots of extra parmesan. Will definately make again.

Excellent dish! I'm a college student living on my own, so whenever I can make an easy, tasty meal and love it, I'm happy.

I forgot to buy the basil pesto so I just randomly used oregano and butter when cooking the salmon. It came out fantastic!

In the aftermath of the holidays we're trying to eat lighter meals. This was not only light, but delicious, too. My husband and daughter devoured it, and can't wait for me to make it again.

Very simple, quick, easy, and healthy.  All the requirements for a weeknight meal.  Need to do some meal planning and get to the grocery store, so I was struggling to come up with dinner tonight!  Googled "what to do with canned salmon" because 3 cans of salmon were in the pantry.  I added garlic as well as some broccoli to make a complete meal.  I also used lentil and chickpea pasta.  Very good.

Was too dry as others said.  I  ended up making a quick béchamel sauce and added parm and garlic powder.Mixed that in and saved the dish.  Also threw in some frozen peas for more veg.  In Canada we have Ocean's brand canned sockeye which has no skin or bones.  Heads up ladies who need more calcium for their bones like I do, eat those chalky round little bones as they are pure available calcium.

I made this recipe and DH and I loved it. A great basic recipe that stands up very well to  changes, I did have to use mozzarella as I was out of Parmesan cheese. Can see adding other things like peppers etc,  Great idea using the pesto this way. Thank you for this yummy dish.

An excellent way to use leftover salmon! I followed the directions exactly, except that I used my leftover salmon, penne pasta, and added fresh chopped spinach to the mix. Very yummy! Thank you VLuv! I may try using leftover chicken next time.

Very good recipe I used baked salmon instead of canned but kept everything else the same.  Family loved it.

I didn't have pesto, but used a tomato and basil mixture...overall it was decent.  My kids liked it and I liked it, but it won't become a weekly favorite.

A very nice recipe, although I did add fresh garlic and chilli to the pesto when cooking with the onions. Also a squeeze of fresh lemon just before serving just finshed it off perfectly. Will definitely be making this recipe again. yum!

I wasn't very impressed by this recipe- I thought the sauce was bland & boring- just "OK", I guess.

This was a bit dry to me and my husband. It was okay, and we will definitely try it again. Maybe we could add a little more pesto or some butter to make it a little more creamy and flavorful.

My husband and I really liked this.  My only complaint was that the pasta wasn't really coated with anything, a bit more "sauce" would have been nice.  A very healthy and new way to eat salmon!

good, but use fresh/frozen salmon - those little bits of gristle in the canned stuff is gross.

Nice & different way to get in your salmon.  Made it with Barilla Plus thin spaghetti for extra nutrition.  Husband loved it...will be making regularly!
