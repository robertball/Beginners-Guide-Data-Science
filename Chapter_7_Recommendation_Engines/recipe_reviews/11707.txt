Even though I was super stuffy with a cold and couldn't really taste anything, this was really good!  The two year old liked it, too.  Be sure to season the zucchini with salt and pepper while cooking it, and watch out with the oil.  The onions sweat enough to create enough juice, so you don't really need so much oil.  To cut the fat, reduce the oil in half and spray the pan with cooking spray before adding oil.

My family and I liked this recipe quite a bit.  My kids didn't want Zucchini in anything until they tried it.  I noticed a discrepancy in the recipe; it calls for 2 TBLS. of Parmesan Cheese twice in the recipe ingredients yet in the directions it says to add 1/2 cup of cheese.  I guessed and went by the directions, using the 1/2 cup of cheese and sprinkling 2 TBLS. of cheese over the top which worked out well.  Besides that minor confusion the recipe was easy to make and I'll definitely be making it again.

Made it as a side dish for a small dinner
party with grilled chicken and steak.
Worked out great since one guest was a 
vegetarian and everyone was able to 
enjoy the meal.
Would definitely make it again.

Everyone loved this (including my 17 month old granddaughter!)  Followed the recipe with the exception of adding yellow and orange peppers with the zucchini. This worked out very well and I will do the same when I prepare this again (and that will be soon!)  We have found a new favorite recipe to use up all the zucchini from the garden. Thanks for sharing!

Love this recipe as a start, as I have changed it over the months. I hate when others change a recipe, then rate it, so I am rating it on the original, which was good, but I wanted to get more veggies into this one, so I now add broccoli, sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms & kalamata olives and of course a bit more parmesan cheese. I only use 1/2 of a large onion, more garlic and cut the zucchini larger as we like our veggies tender crisp. Thank you Dave for the recipe, this is a regular in my home now.

Pasta with some vegetables added is always a winner.  Adding Parmesan is only a plus.  I've prepared and enjoyed pasta like this all my life, but adding cream is not something I typically do.  It often seems the case that some of the best stuff coming out of my kitchen happens when I need to make use of things in the fridge (in this case zucchini and a partial carton of cream)  before I travel from one place to the next.  My take on this - I used fusilli rather than farfalle, added a shallot because I had it to use, and used freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.

This is a great easy sauce. You can leave out the veggie and add shrimp. I added a little more garlic for more flavor. I make it all the time with other noodles and different veggies. Very versatile.

Made this tonight and it was fantastic, everyone loved it.  My daughter said we have to have this at least twice a month or more.  I started with sauteeing carrots in the olive oil with some dried basil, then added red bell pepper, zucchini & yellow summer squash and ended with some mushrooms.  Made everything else the same but did have to add more heavy cream and I added fresh grated parmesan right into the cream sauce.  Didn't add the salt, the cheese was enough.  Will definitely make this one over and over again.

What a delicious way to use up zucchini!  I made this for company, and everyone raved over it.  I doubled the recipe because I was feeding seven, and there was tons left over.  I didn't really change anything, with the exception of using a little more cheese.  The only thing I would do differently next time, would be to dice the zucchini, because frankly, slicing them into a julienne was really time consuming.

I added mushrooms in with the zucchini and then removed the zucchini before I added the cream. To the sauce I also added about 1/2 cup chicken broth and a splash of white wine. Served with chicken and it was a great meal!

This was delicious! Fast and easy.  I added salad shrimp to this dish and it was fantastic.  The recipe made quite a lot too.  My boyfriend and I both had large dinner servings and had more than enough for both of us to have lunch the following day.  I will definitely use the sauce recipe and add variations of veggies and meats for future dishes.  YUM!

I've NEVER cooked alone in my life...
and last night my boyfriend came over and I was feeling daring I made us dinner.  He thought it was great!  So creamy and rich and simple to prepare...foolproof recipe, no doubt. Julienning the zuchinni was kindof a pain, but it paid off well.

This recipe was very difficult to scale, so I had to wing it in terms of amounts of ingredients.   I deviated from the recipe by adding some leftover yellow and orange bell pepper that needed to be used, and I used half & half instead of heavy cream.  This was just so-so for us.  Edible, certainly, but rather bland and not something we’d repeat.

Good and very simple recipe. I wanted some extra veggies, so I added a squash and a can of diced tomatoes. I omitted the cream to cut on fat and added extra fresh grated parmesan cheese. Served over whole wheat fusilli because that's what I had on hand.

I wanted to give 4.5 stars on this one.  Yes, it is a bit on the bland side but that is easily remedied with the addition of salt in whatever form you prefer.  My dinner guests couldn't stop eating this dish.  I used a large electric skillet to pull all this together since it makes a lot.  I used yellow squash in addition to the zucchini.  Fresh parmesan cheese is the key to this dish.  Fabulous!

This is yummy! we also like the squash tender-crisp, so I chopped them up & added 1 yellow squash because there are so many in the garden! Just used 1 onion but everything else was the same. Paired it with the grilled chicken with herbs from this site. Excellent dish, even as leftovers.

easy and delicious. i followed the recipe. at the end, i added lots of salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste. i also added grape tomatoes because i was trying to use them up. tomatoes were fine, but not necessary.

This was good. A nice change to regular pasta w/ alfredo sauce but it didn't WOW us.

The recipe as written is a good starting point, but I felt like it needed more flavor. A few sprinkles of red pepper flakes livened it up for me. I also added chicken- big help! - and mushrooms. Next time I may incorporate some white wine or lemon and a few other types of vegetables, just to give it something more.

It was good. Needs more spice for my palate. I added salt and freshly ground black pepper. Paired nicely with a Tilapia Filet in Scampi and a nice, fresh, crunchy Italian Bread with homemade roasted garlic and rosemary butter and a glass of Pilot Grigio. This recipe is a great base to expand on though.

I have made this several times.  My husband and three children love it and of course so do I!   I have to agree with the other review that a little less oil would be better.

I was a bit disappointed in this recipe. There is not much flavor in the sauce so make sure you add enough salt and pepper.  Maybe some basil or Italian seasoning would help.  My leftovers have sat in the fridge so I don't think I will be making this again for my family.

Very good!  Found a way to use my neighbor's zucchini.  Very easy too.
