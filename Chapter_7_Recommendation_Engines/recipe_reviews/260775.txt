This recipe was a huge hit with my kids. I did not make any changes to the recipe but  would add a little more BBQ sauce next time I make it.  Definitely a keeper!

I sautéed the raw onions in butter first. Other than that, I made no changes. Great and quick to put together. Yum!

These were very good and such a hit with my kids. I did remove the onions because I’m the only one in the family who eat them. I added a side of green beans with them. This will be my go to quick meal.

Very good and easy to make.  The kids loved them.  It might've been the bread rolls that I was using, but leaving in the oven for 15 mins made the rolls hard on top and a bit crunchy.  I will reduce oven time to 10 mins on the next one.  I added bell pepper and onions, on a few of them, for me and my wife.

I made this on Thursday night and it came out real good. Instead of halved dinner rolls, I used store-bought slider rolls. And instead of melted butter, since I couldn't find it, I used canola oil to spray on top of the roll.  Delicious! I have plenty for leftovers.

Pretty good sandwiches. Instead of using the measurements in the recipe, I estimated. I added salt and pepper to chicken tenderloins and cut them to fit mini-buns. I served these alongside potato rounds (on this site).

Family liked this.  Next time, I would increase the chicken a bit.  Probably cut down on the parmesan cheese/garlic topping.  Also, needs more bbq sauce.  But overall, a good dish.
