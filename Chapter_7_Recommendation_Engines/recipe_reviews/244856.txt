This is a definite repeat recipe for us--we loved these burgers! They had so much flavor. I blended the beans, tomatoes and onions in a food processor so that there wouldn't be any chunks. (I did this to hide them from my son. He had no idea beans were in them!) I used a whole egg and added about 1/3 cup of bread crumbs. Also, I used 1 T dried parsley. I made them on the George Foreman Grill, and they held together and stayed moist. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Delicious!!!! My 5yo, picky eater, ate the whole thing! Just like another cook, I also pureed all the veggies. I probably doubled the amount of beans...I put in a little over 1/2 can.  I also added the yolk with my egg & used about 1/4 cup of coconut flour (gluten free). It held together awesome! 

I served it with a side of baked sweet potato fries - yum!!!

Instead of adding tomato, onion, parsley individually I just used pico de gallo and it added a nice flavor. I also incorporated bread crumbs to the mix the placed them in the freezer for about an hour to hold. I loved this recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I've made these burgers twice now and both times were great. First time I used a food processor to blend ingredients and had a problem with burgers staying together, even after flash freezing. Today I followed recipe and chopped and blended burgers by hand. Also added 1/4c of bread crumbs. They held together and we delicious.

My 5 y/o picky eater loved it. 
It took some planning because I used dried black beans (goya). 
Beans pressure cooked in my crock pot pressure cooker to save tons of time then I was able to add the following ingredients:

white onion, celery, garlic sautéed until translucent then added to beans 
tomatoes sliced and diced
fresh lemon juice
green pepper
cilantro
jalapeno (or just buy a nice chunky salsa)
cumin 
vegetable broth
the goya seasoning that comes inside the bag 

Toppings (or thrown in what ever you want):
green onion
cilantro
lemon
sour cream
once finished cooking I had an amazing bean soup! 

I then took some of the beans drained the juice and added it to some ground turkey, with one egg white, and some panko bread crumbs (the meat was really moist). I cooked it in a coconut oil in my cast iron skillet topped with gouda cheese. They held together and had tons of flavor!

I pair these with Pillsbury's sweet Hawaiian biscuits. They are delicious.

The added moisture from the tomatoes extended the frying time, but it’s well worth it.

We don’t eat red meat or regular burgers so we tend to eat a lot of turkey burgers. I was getting bored of my normal version and tried this. This was fantastic and a very different one than most turkey burgers out there. For those who say turkey burgers are bland, this is one to try. Lots of flavor. I did cook the onions and garlic a bit just because I don’t like semi cooked onion and also added Italian breadcrumbs because the mix was so wet I was concerned it would just fall apart. Delicious!

I didn't have any cumin so maybe that's why I couldn't give it a five star.  Also, I added some bread crumbs, maybe 1/4 cup at most and slice of American cheese.   But very good and will make again.

Very yummy!   Made them for dinner tonight and they are a hit.  I made them just as the recipe said.  I did however follow a suggestion made by another rater and put them in the freezer for two hours before I cooked them.   Will be making them again.
