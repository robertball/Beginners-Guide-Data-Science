I chose to make this cake for a small group of women where one lady was dairy intolerant.  This was the PERFECT dessert for her, I didn't use the lemon glaze, choosing instead to make dairy free Chocolate peanut butter fudge frosting (1/2 cup shortening, 1/2 cup peanut butter, 1/2 cup water, 1 cup sifted cocoa powder, 4 cups of confectioner sugar) -which really gave it a chocolate lovers appeal.  Great cake recipe...thanks for sharing!

Make sure you don't use all 2 oz. of the lemon juice, it makes the frosting way too runny.  Use about  1 oz. and then add a tiny bit more mixing as you go to get the desired consistency.  I followed the recipe to a T and ended up with a drooped center and really runny icing that didn't cover my cake very well. Otherwise, it tastes really good.

I used Special Dark Cocoa as I am rather partial to dark chocolate taste and it turned out great.   I like that it only makes one layer...doesn't leave you with too much to add to your waistline!   Thanks...I will be making this again.

My mother made this same recipe for me back in the 50s. I continue to make it for my own birthday every year!

I love this recipe!  I tried it because I was low on ingredients and desperately wanted chocolate cake, but it has become a favorite.  I have not made it with the lemon icing, though; I always use chocolate.  I actually get more than one layer out of it.  This recipe yields two 8" layers, or one 8" layer and 6 cupcakes!  So good and very moist.

I love this cake! It is so moist and the lemon icing goes surprisingly well with it. I actually changed the recipe a little bit by making it 2 layers and put half of the icing in between. Everyone loves it! To make again on Halloween or anytime!

The only good thing about this cake was that is was very chocolatey....  It was okay but it was a bit dry and stuck to your throat as you swallowed.  Definately went down better with icing.

I made this for a little party with some friends. Alot of people ate it but none of them finished this pieces. I liked it, but didn't seem to be much of a crowd pleaser.
