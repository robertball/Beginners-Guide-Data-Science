I love this recipe and make it all the time.  But I alter it a little by adding more processed cheese and cream cheese.  Otherwise it is a little too buttery.

This is simply the best cheese spread ever. I have found it to be the best when you allow it to soften to a creamy consistency

This was ok.  A little too buttery.  Also tastes better heated.

This recipe rendered a thinner version of processed cheese from a jar.  I don't think it was worth the extra fat.  Needs more flavor to make it presentable as an appetizer.
