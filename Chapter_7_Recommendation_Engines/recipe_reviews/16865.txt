I have been making this dip for several years now. A few variations from Kevin's though. I use 1lb spicy bulk sausage, 3-8 oz cream cheese & 2 cans rotel. My husband & I love spicy foods, but I like how you can adjust the taste by buying mild saugage and regular rotel. Every time I make it, I get rave reviews!

I loved it.  I used suggestions by others and did the following:  one roll of hot sausuage, one roll of mild sausage, 2 cans of rotel, and three bricks of cream cheese.  I browned the meat, put it all in the crock pot on low, and ta dah! perfect.

I made this one night w/ regular cream cheese.  It was a huge hit!  Thought I'd try to make it a little more healthy and switched to light cream cheese.  Bad idea.

I made this once the way the recipe said & it was extremely tasty - I like my dips a little bit creamier, so I added 2 tbsp of evap milk & 1 cup of monterray jack cheese - yes, I know I changed the recipe, but the one above is a wonderful base for which to build!!!

This dip is very easy and very delicious! I took this to a social and the crowd went crazy! I did use three 8 oz boxes of cream cheese instead of one and it is still very thick! Let me tell you this is one of those dips where the men just sat by the bowl and dipped all night! There were 15 people there at the most and the dip was gone by the end of the night! I will make this again and again!! Thanks for the great recipe!

I'm rating 4 stars because I don't do it exactly this way... but same idea/base...

I make what to me is a 'double batch' -- 

I get 1lb. of regular sausage, 1lb. of hot sausage.  Cook it in a frying pan, (use a potato masher to stir/break it up, works great,) drain off all the grease.  Throw that in a crock pot with 2-8oz. Bricks of 1/3 less fat Neufchatel/Cream Cheese (To those of you that said Lite - BAD idea, it works absolutely perfectly, I never use full fat cream cheese anymore, even in cheesecakes it comes out great - the non-fat is a different story)

And 2 cans of Rotel/Diced Tomatoes with Chilis... throw it in the crock on High til it bubbles, turn it to low and leave out for the party!

I've been making this dip for years, but we call it football dip as that is usually when we like to serve it.  I use 2 packages of 8 oz cream cheese and I can of rotel with 1 lb of bulk sausage (either or regular or spicy depending on the crowd).  It's wonderful with authentic corn tortilla chips or my favorite - Fritos scoops!  Not the most  appealing look, but absolutely delicious tasting.

Good but with changes. I made the recipe and thought it was a little blah.  I did not use the spicy sausage because the couple I was going to share it with cannot eat real spicy stuff but did use the Rotel tomatoes.  I put in 2 - 8 ounce packages of cream cheese, a little garlic and still thought it was missing something besides the spice from the sausage.  I added a cup of the four cheese blend Mexican style cheese and some fresh style salsa from the deli.  Perfection.  Our friends couldn't say enough good about it, they are still talking about it weeks later.  They wanted the recipe saying it was the best ever, one to take out on the boat.  Definately a keeper, a great base recipe that could easily be changed to your personal taste.

I happened to have all the ingredients and needed something quick to take to the neighbors' house one night.  This dip was a real hit and everyone asked for the recipe.

This dip is delicious! Every time I take it to a party people rave about it. I use two 16 oz. packages of cream cheese, two cans of rotel (I drain only drain one can) , and two tubes of breakfast sausage. Yummy!

I was looking to add the sausage dip recipe I always make, and I came across this one.. looks like it was already taken! The only thing I do differently is I use sour cream instead of cream cheese. I also like to use pork sausage with sage, but any pork sausage will work really. It's great with Tostito Tortilla chips, but it's also really good with Fritos Corn Chip Scoops! I get a request for this every time we have a pot luck at work or the family gets together!

This stuff is just plain good! I've had this recipe in my box for 3 years and have made similar recipes, but never this one. The only thing I changed was that I used 1 pound of spicy pork sausage and no regular ground pork because that's what I had in my freezer. Soooo good with tostitos or Ruffles; a perfect dip for football Sunday! Thanks :)

I made this recipe last night with my family. I found the taste to be a little bland and the dip was a little watery. Could be that I didn't serve it right away. I would definitely make it again, but I would add some cheddar cheese & some sauteed peppers & onions, I think this would add a lot to the flavour. This is a good basic recipe, a few modifications & it could be great!

Awesome dip.  Made with 1 lb hot/spicy pork sausage, 1 can RoTel tomatoes w/green chilies and 8ozs Velveeta loaf cheese for a superbowl party.  Our guests were filling up their entire plates until it was gone.  They couldn't get enough.  Next time we'll try it with the cream cheese.

I've made this dip on several occastions.  My entire family loves it.  Sometimes I like it less chunky so I'll mix the the meat and rotel in my blender just a little.  Also I'll add some red pepper flades to give it a little more heat.  My family really likes it HOT!

This is an excellent recipe.  One of my favs and a hit at all my holiday parties.  I have one slight variation, I pour the mixture into a casserole dish and bake at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes.

This recipe was served at a potluck I attended, and it was well received by those in attendance.  I myself, enjoyed it as well, although I must say that the flavors weren't spectacular enough to earn it a 5.  However, the simplicity of the ingredients allows more room for experimentation, and therein lies the ingenuity!

This was a good dip!!  We halved the recipe and it was the perfect size for our mini dipper crockpot.  Next time I might add some spices to give it a little more zip.  Was a good first time use of our crockpot.

I used 3 blocks of cream cheese, 3 cans of Rotel with the green chilies, 2 packages of sausage (one hot and one regular), and a package of shredded mexican four cheese mix. I also add a good amount of Worcestershire to the mix.   I think I also threw in some onion and garlic salt to taste. Browned the sausage the day before, then threw it all in the crockpot the next morning and it was awesome! Scoops chips worked great! I also used the liner for the crock pot for very easy clean up! Highly recommend!

I've made it twice now with some adjustments. 1 pound of mild and 1 pound of spicy sausage was used. 2 packages of cream cheese and 2 cans of Rotel. 1st time I made it, it was little runny so I drained 1 can of Rotel on my 2nd try and it was perfect. I added shredded cheddar cheese right before servicing.  It's so easy. Both times it disappeared in no time and everyone asked for the recipe.

As is, this recipe is waaaaay too meaty for our preferences in a dip.  It is not even dip-able when made according to the recipe.  I like the flavor of using cream cheese in place of the usual velveeta, but for our preferences the amount of cream cheese needs to be increased substantially if using 1-1/2 lbs of meat.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Kevin Rodgers.

I've made this appetizer several times in the last year. I always bake the sausage/tomato&chili/cream cheese mixture for 25 minutes at 350 degrees. Baking evens out the consistency of the dip.

Someone at work recommended a similar recipe for a bookclub gathering.  I have to say, when everything first mixed together I thought the color was off and that this probably would be a flop.  Ok, and I was a bit snobby thinking it was kind of low brow with the ingredients.  WRONG.  This makes an amazing dip.  I can't believe I haven't had this before after all the parties I've been to.  Try it, you'll love it.  BTW I only used 1/2 pound sausage and that's the ratio for me.

I've had this twice but I use all spicy sausage (no regular). Like it a bit spicer. This made with cream cheese runs circles around the kind made with Velveeta. Making it for work next month for our carry in. My sister made it for my daughter-in-laws baby shower last month and it was the 1st to go. Should have doubled it.

I got this same recipe from Ro-tels website years ago.  Good stuff.  It is kinda thick, so I add some sour cream to give it more of a "dip"consistency.  It's very good and goes quick at parties!!  Perfect tailgate food.

Pretty tasty, but it sure needed another dose of tomatoes. Guests thought it was okay for poker night; had some leftovers but we didn't eat them.

I have been making this for years.  It is always a hit.  If I don't make it I am in trouble and everyone is asking for it.  So I have learned Party=sausage dip.

My husband's cousin gave us this recipe, but we call it "The Man Dip". We use regular breakfast sausage, two pkgs of cream cheese and two cans of rotel. Delicious!

This is a great recipe and so easy to make!  If you add 1 cup of monterey jack and about 1/2 cup of salsa it's even better!  Thanks for sharing!

So simple and so delicious. This made a lot of dip so make sure you have a crowd. It would be perfect for a football party or a family party.

I love this dip.  Use whatever sausage you want and add more cream cheese (2 for me).  I don't use a slow cooker, I cook the sausage  until done, drain  most of the grease and add the rotel with about 1/2 of the liquid into the sausage.  Cook it down a bit then add the cheese to melt it.  Depending on whose going to eat it I add some hot sauce before putting it in the bowl.  It's even better the second day, but it usually doesn't make it that far.

This was the most favorite dish at a birthday party I recently cooked for. As soon as people taste it, they cannot get enough of it.

First of all I'm a vegetarian so I did NOT eat this, BUT we had a party and my husband Loves sausage and pretty much everyone else I know does.  Everyone at the party wanted the recipe and said it was delicious! They were still talking about it the next day. I used Premio sweet Italian sausage ( about 1.25 lb) and pulled the casings off and then cooked it. I added it to the crock pot over 3 blocks of Philly cream cheese ( 1 is NOT enough), then I added a can of diced tomatoes with mild green chiles , juice and all.  It was gone by the end of the night.  This recipe is highly modifiable.  Right before serving sprinkling the top with shredded provolone or cheddar cheese would add extra flavor Ofcourse that also means even more fat! Enjoy!

Good but definitly double the cream cheese and possibly add something else more liquidy since this is basically all sausage otherwise.  Good just not really a dip consistancy.

Whipped this up for dinner one night because I was low on energy and had everything it called for... I followed it exactly and found that was pretty good, even my picky little one liked it.  I made it in a skillet on the stove top and it turned out just fine. Will make this again!

This was the best! I go to a superbowl party at the same place every year, (over a hundred people )people are always wondering what I am going to bring. I try to come up with something new every year,they loved this. I doubled it and it did not last very long.Thank you for the great recipes.
