I followed this recipe step by step. The recipe is terrible as well as the end result. I would not recommend cooking this again unless someone else tries it and make some serious changes.

There needs to be 1 3/4 cup flour. I can almost guarantee the batter came out on the liquidy side. Most cake and sweet type bread recipes call for that amount. So try doing 1 3/4 cup of flour instead of only 1 and there'll be a huge difference. Other than that this recipe looks on point and should come out great. :)

I felt bad for this one, I took the other review to heart and added a block of cream cheese, lemon extract & the zest of a lemon. This cake was Dense and not in a good way. 9x13 pan, Really?? No, it would have been way too thin. I used a 3qt casserole dish. Not sure why this recipe doesn't work. Sorry.
