This was really awesome. I made this for thanksgiving as the main dish. I cooked it in a bundt  pan and did alternating layers of tofu loaf and vegetarian stuffing. It turned out really well. The bundt pan made it look really good as well. Also I made a portobello mushroom gravy to go on top which made it even better.

This was a fantastic recipe.  I followed it exactly with no problem.  This recipe has unlimited possibilities as far as adding additional ingredients.  Thank you to the chef!  As a side note, doesn't everyone know the difference between vegan and vegetarian in the use of eggs (re: poemmommy1 review).

I have tried this recipe several times and it is delicious - it also serves as a great base to experiment with when adding more ingredients. If you are gluten intolerant use brown rice instead of the breadcrumbs and check the label on the soup mix. I also added carrots & broccoli  & some cashew nuts. Experiment & have fun with this recipe!

THIS IS DELICIOUS!  I will make again and again and again. :-)
Thanks for an absolutely great recipe.  I “veganized” it by using Chia Gel instead of eggs.   Otherwise, I followed the recipe ingredient list.  As I noticed the loaf achieving the coloring that appealed to me after 30 minutes, I relocated it from the top oven rack to the lower rack and cooked for another 10 minutes.  Since I had not added egg, there really was not anything to undercook. Forty minutes seemed quiet sufficient.

I've made this numerous times for different groups of people, vegetarian and non-vegetarian alike and every single person raved about it. However, I find that I always need to cook it at least an hour, sometimes longer, than what is stated in the recipe.

I liked the recipe a lot. It's perfect fit my mom who just became a vegetarian and I who still eat meat can enjoy it as well. I didn't follow the directions thou. I added sweet peppers to the mix. Meatloaf isn't meatloaf without a glaze so I made one from a different recipe. It was 1/4 cup of ketchup,  1/4 cup sweet & spicy mustard 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar  And a ginger garlic spice. Turned out flavorful. Next time I'll chop up the mushrooms finer thou. I didn't like how big slices would fall out.

I love this recipe. I do substitute chia seeds for the eggs to make it vegan. Serve with mushroom gravy.  Even our non vegan family members love it.

My family did not care for it at all, it was bland and kind of an odd texture.

This was an okay recipe. The texture was nice and similar to meatloaf, but I found the taste a bit off putting. I think it was the onion soup mix that I didn't like. I will try to figure out something else to add instead of that.

Delicious! My husband couldn’t tell it was all vegetarian! I’m making again but leaving out the sage. Great recipe, even the gals at work loved it!

I used pecans instead of walnuts (did not have walnuts handy) and it turned out good.
