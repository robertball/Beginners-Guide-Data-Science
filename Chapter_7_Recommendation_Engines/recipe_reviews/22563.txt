Awesome cake! Turned out very fluffy and light. Perfect for cupcakes, except they raise quite a bit, so I couldn't get flat tops. Totally fine, though. I will slightly decrease the salt next time, because I could taste it just the tiniest bit and I didn't like that. All around, perfect consistancy. Thank you.

I know this has already received enough reviews but it really is a perfect chocolate cake.  It was moist and chocolatey without being too sickly sweet or heavy.   i was short 100g of cocoa so i had to do without and just crossed my fingers.  Luckily it didn´t make any difference the cake turned out.  We don´t have hersheys cocoa so I used a normal brand cocoa and it was perfect.  It needed more cooking time than was stated in the recipe as a result of the missing cocoa and i cooked it all in one cake pan instead of dividing it into two.  Try a chocolate ganache as an icing for special occasions.  when i worked as a chef, the only thing we would ice our chocolate cakes with was ganache.  after you taste ganache you will understand why.  there is a recipe for it on this website under chocolate ganache.

I have used this cake recipe for 20 years and it is the absolute best! I used to bake cakes to sell, for birthday parties, functions, etc...this cake made my reputation!

Sometimes I like to add 1tsp of almond extract instead of the vanilla or use hot coffee instead of the hot water. It gives it a wonderful flavor. Also, I change the frostings, sometimes I add cappucino powder to the frosting recipe and sometimes I frost it with peanut butter-cream cheese frosting.

This cake recipe will never let you down!

This is the best tasting chocolate cake! I never make chocolate cake from a box anymore, this cake is worth all the extra time and preparation. I brought this to church meals quite a few times and everyone loves it.

You guys are going to love this one.  After reading the reviews, I had to make this.  Indeed it was delicious.  I only had enough powdered sugar to make 1 batch of the buttercream frosting (I usually like to double my frosting on chocolate cakes...goes to show how much of a sweet tooth I have). Anyway, out of desperation for extra frosting, I made a batch of No Bake Cookies with about half the amount of oatmeal called for.  I added this to my buttercream frosting while it was still warm.  I poked lots of holes in the top of my cake and poured the frosting over.  I don't recommend you do this unless you plan on going into a sugar coma, but I definitely got my sugar fix.  Needless to say it turned out delicious.

I only have one thing to say about this cake!  PERFECT!
Oh my!  This was my very first attempt at making a cake from scratch and it was so easy to do and so good to eat!  I didn't change anything.  I made it both ways in the 9 inch pan and in a sheet cake pan and they both turned out great!

This cake has been standard birthday cake in my family for as long as I can remember.  It is certainly deep, dark, and chocolate!  Once I was at a birthday party and everyone was commenting how moist the (box-mix) cake was.  But since I was used to this cake, I thought that cake was dry!  It is delightful with a variety of chocolate frostings, fillings, etc.  It can be made as cupcakes, too; just bake for a shorter time.

I know there are already a lot of reviews, but I'll add mine :)  This cake and frosting recipe is the absolute BEST!!!!  I have never had luck with frosting- past recipes have  come out grainy or the sugar overpowers the flavor. This frosting turned out so delicious~!  I didn't have any problem it being runny- I just added a little bit of milk at a time assuming that I might not need it all. I did end up using all the milk and my frosting had a "whipped" effect. It wasn't the least bit runny.  I don't think I can ever eat a cake mix or canned frosting again without thinking of this recipe!

A really basic cake that is easy to make.  I iced it with Hershey's chocolate mousse which made it very rich.

BEST chocolate cake ever! I was told it was better than a bakery's. I used Nestle Toll House chocolate lover's frosting. I put the leftovers in the fridge and it tasted even better chilled!

THis is a nice recipes to try.  I made it with free Promise margerine and skim milk and eggbeaters.  I decreased the sugar to 1 and 2/3 cups but it still tasted kind of sugary...(I kind taste a hint of the grainy sugar in my mouth) not to say that it wasn't delicious.  This is definitely sweeter than the Chocolate Cavity Maker Cake on this website - but I like that recipe more b/c it's more rich and chocolate like :)

It was a great cake! Instead of puting the coco in the dry ingredients, I added it to the hot water and then followed the recipe accordingly. It was super moist!!

Oh yeah! Awesome! I made this for a baby shower I hosted and it was beautiful as well as delicious. This was actually my FIRST TIME ever making a cake from scratch! It was easy! I used a Bundt pan and, just as a warning, it was a little too much for my pan (I believe it was 12 cup?). Next time I would reserve maybe a half a cup of batter b/c as it rose some overflowed and burned onto the bottom of the oven. Another thing to take note of, the batter is VERY thin after pouring in the boiling water...I thought perhaps I had done something wrong, but it bakes up just right. Just wanted to warn you. I just made a glaze so it wouldn't compete with the cake and I think that it was great. I can't comment on the frosting in the recipe since I didn't attempt it. For my first "from scratch" cake attempt I think I picked a winning recipe! I will make this again and again.

GREAT CUPCAKES!  I got about 30 cupcakes out of the batter and had left over frosting.  Paper baking cups worked better than just greasing the tins. Hershey's ® 'Perfectly Chocolate' Chocolate Cake has the same cake recipe and includes instructions for cupcakes and other pan sizes.

This recipe is the best ever. I double the recipe and made a three layer cake and a sheet cake for a family party and it was the talk of the party. Sever with ice cream or whipped cream and it was great.

Made this cake for my husbands birthday,it is absolutely wonderful, very moist!
After adding the water I wondered if it was going to turn out, as the batter was very thin, not to worry it does certainly does.

I used half boiling water, half strong coffee.  Doubling the recipe yielded 48 cupcakes, which I baked for 14 mins & then frosted with Caroline's Chocolate Fudge Frosting.  The cupcakes were UNBELIEVABLE - so moist, absolutely perfect.  Remember: it continues cooking after you take it out of the oven, so if it looks done in the oven, it'll be overcooked once it cools (and chocolate recipes are best undercooked anyway)

This cake was really moist and delicious. I used two round pans and I found there was not enough frosting so I had to make a second batch.  It tasted even better the second day as the frosting set in. I'll be making this again!

We didn't love this cake.  I made it for a friend's birthday, and it turned out okay enough for us to eat, but it certainly wasn't one of my show-stoppers.  I was disappointed in the flavor.  I wanted something with true chocolate flavor, but the chocolate flavor wasn't as good as I had hoped.  And it wasn't nice and moist like I wanted.  I will use my great aunt's mayonnaise cake instead.

This was a delicious cake.  It really was. Very moist and so chocolatey.  The icing also was very good.  I hate to ice cakes (because I'm so bad at it), but this icing spread so easily.  I will make this again.

I have been making this cake for years.  The recipe has been on the Hershey's Cocoa can since I can remember.  I suggest you don't change a thing, follow the recipe. It's the best!

A cake mix cake could not have been any easier!!  This was fast, simple, and DELICIOUS!!  I frosted mine with cream cheese frosting, using 8 ounces of soft cream cheese, 1/4 cup of soft butter, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, 1 tablespoon of water, and 4 cups +/- of powdered sugar.  It was so good!!  I'm making another tomorrow for my in-laws birthdays!!
THANKS!

so moist! Instead of cow's milk I used coconut/almond milk blend (blue diamond makes it) and I used coconut oil instead of butter. I used the same measurements and it worked perfectly. So this recipe can be a dairy-free one as well. So good! (I also used coconut sugar, and no, they don't taste coco-nutty at all.)

This is indeed the BEST!I have been using this recipe for over 20 years.  However, I have made one change.  I reudce the water from 1 C to 1/2 C.  This gives a more cake-like texture, otherwise it tends to get a bit sticky.

This makes a beautiful and downright naughty chocolate cake.  My only changes were the addition of about 1 Tbsp of instant coffee and the use of Ghiradelli chocolate cocoa. I followed the directions exactly but split the cake in two when attempting to remove it from the pan (par for the course for me, so probably my fault).  My husband and I ended up making Valentine's Day trifles in wine glasses with layers of this cake, whipped cream, hot fudge sauce and fresh raspberries--needless to say I wasn't disappointed about splitting the cake.  My search for a good chocolate cake recipe is now over, I just need to figure out how to get them out of the pan!

This was a delicious and moist cake, we all loved it. I halved the recipe and made a single layer round cake instead of a double and substituted yogurt for oil. Yumm, Yumm!

i used this recipe for the base of my friends' birthday party and followed this recipe to a 'T'. i tripled it to make 3 separate square cakes to form a one layer rectangular-shaped cake. i recommend to just use 1 teaspoon of b/soda to limit the bitter after-taste of the cake, and add 1 full cup of cocoa powder instead of just 3/4 to get a more chocolatey cake.  I substituted the white sugar to icing sugar and added a tablespoon of milk one at a time to get the right, smooth consistency. hence, i'm giving this a 4-star. But yes, the cake is really dark and moist! It was gone as the party ended! I managed to save a a big piece and i ate it a day after, and it tasted much better as the cake has blended with the frosting.

With finals, I didn't think I'd have the patience to make this cake -- but it was definitely worth it!  I poured half the mixture into cupcake liners (~22 minutes) and the other half as a single cake layer, and both turned out great!

Also, to shave off a little fat, I substituted the 1/2 c. oil with 1/2 c applesauce + 2 tbsp vegetable oil, and no one could tell the difference!  The frosting was a little sweet -- I should have cut down the sugar, as another reviewer suggeted.  Thanks!

This cake is so moist and delicious, it doesn't even need frosting.  But when I do frost it, I use the Fluffy White Frosting recipe posted on this site because it is light and not excessively sweet.  This is the only chocolate cake recipe I use.

I found this recipe years ago and make it especially at Christmastime. My kids always looked forward to this cake and a cup of hot cocoa on Christmas Eve (although I frosted mine with Buttercream Frosting as I didn't want to overdo it with chocolate). Even tho my kids are grown and on their own they still ask for this every Christmas Eve when they are home. Very rich, very moist, and very delicious!

Two words: WOW!

This cake was a snap to make; I put all of the ingredients in my stand-up mixer and let it go. It was thin, as the recipe states, but baked up perfectly dense and rich and wonderful! I increased the amount of frosting by an additional 50% to be sure I had enough for the sides, too. A REAL winner of a recipe -- 100% delicious!

Oh my goodness!  I will never have to buy a chocolate cake mix again.  This is the best cake I've ever made or tasted.  One thing I do is sift all of the dry ingredients.  I've found this helps make the cake not as dense.  I also don't use as much milk in the frosting as it calls for.  Mine seemed a bit runny when I used the full amount.

This cake is soooooo good! I made 30 cupcakes from this recipe. They are so moist and fluffy, I would recommend this recipe to anyone I know. The icing was a bit thin for my taste, but still very good. Overall, this recipe will be a hit no matter where you go. Anyone making their first cake from scratch, try this one. It's amazing! Thanks!

Excellent cake. I used chocolate cream cheese frosting instead as others have suggested and it was a great compliment to the rich cake. The cake batter was indeed very thin and it took 45 or more minutes to bake a 9 x 13 pan. My husband didn't compliment the cake when we tried it for a midnight snack (I made it at night to satisfy my sweet tooth)but I thought he was going to lick his plate after he ate a huge piece. This recipe is a keeper.

Oh my GOODNESS this is the BEST chocolate cake I have ever had! I have never baked a cake from scratch and was worried. I was baking this for my birthday, people were coming for cake and coffee. I had nothing to worry about though. I followed the recipe and this cake was soooo GOOD! Will be baking this one for many years to come!

My mother-in-law actually told me this was the best chocolate cake she'd ever tasted!  It was suggested to me after tasting this that I quit my graduate school career and make cakes for a living instead.

I used coffee instead of water.  It was absolutely fantastic!

The cake tasted very rich and I was very disappointed that the cake fell considerably after I took it out of the oven.  I made this for New Years Eve and had friends over.  One friend said it was awesome but everyone else didn't care for it at all.  Even the children didn't finish their pieces.  I think I will go back to box cakes.  The frosting was great though.  Very easy to make.

This has been my family's absolute favorite chocolate cake for years now. Incredibly deep and dark and moist. And so easy to make. I easily whip up a sheet cake for a terrific after-school snack. And an added bonus is that it's lower-calorie, lower-cholesterol, and and lower-fat than many other chocolate cake recipes -- yet it tastes just as decadently rich as the others! I can't believe I used to bother with butter-based cakes that turned out dry or crumbly. Do try this one if you haven't already!

Wow!  My mom made this for Christmas, and I made it for New years eve.  Everyone devoured it both times!  Like eating a fluffy chocolate bar.
Don't make the icing too early or you will need to add more milk to make it spread.

I followed the recipe to a T and can't say I was that impressed. I made cupcakes, and I'm giving them four stars because they were very moist. However, I have definitely made deeper, darker, chocolatey-ier cake before. I probably won't be making this again.

This cake is amazing.  It is so chocolatey and moist.  I put chocolate mousse in between the layers and used chocolate buttercream frosting.  I'll be making it many more times!

This recipe is not for those who are at altitude!  This cake never baked all the way through, even after adjusting temperature and time.  I don't think there are any ways to alter the recipe for altitude as it is supposed to be very thin batter.

Great taste and texture on this cake!  I was a little concerned since the batter was so thin but it baked up really beautifully.  To give it a little kick, I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of chile pepper.

I subbed out the hot water for strong coffee, and it made this cake extra rich and amazingly delicious.

This was a pretty good cake but the first time I made it it wasnt moist enough for me. So the second time I made this cake I used 1/2 of butter flavored crisco and only 2 tbs of the oil, the crisco is one of my secrets of making my cakes moist! And I used soy milk instead of regular milk for a little flavor in the frosting and I mixed in 2 cups of coconut in the frosting. Really great cake.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday last Saturday, everybody loved it! It was very moist and the recipe was easy to follow. I made the buttercream frosting too which was pretty good. I will be making this cake again for sure! My husband said it was most excellent.

Excellent chocolate cake. The best. Directions clear. Make this cake for son's birthday every year by request and other chocolate lovers too. I cut into 4 layers and use raspberry jam and pastry cream filling on layers. Also use strong coffee instead of water and some coffee in icing also.  A great cake for special occasions!!!

Warning: DO NOT attempt this cake in 2 cake-pans, as the recipe suggests.  I did, and it overflowed everywhere, made a mess in the oven, burnt and stank up my kitchen.  If you want a round cake, I'd suggest dividing this batter between 3 pans.  
I left the cake to cool 10 minutes, as the recipe says, but when I turned it out it all fell apart.  :-(  
Plus, I don't think it tastes that good either (yes, I did put in a whole cup of cocoa powder) - rather tasteless, although the texture is good.
Over all, pretty disappointing.

The texture and moistness of this cake are excellent, but I didn't find it very chocolatey.  This cake would benefit from the addition of melted chocolate squares or bars.

My mom had me look this recipe up because she used to make the best chocolate cupcakes and she couldn't find her recipe. When she saw it she said this was it! She recognized it because of the boiling water in the batter. Now she's happy making (her) famous cupcakes again!

I was hesitant on this one since so many reviewers said this was the first "from scratch" cake they'd ever made and that's the only way I bake. But, this was fabulous! I baked it at 325 for 38 minutes. I've never tasted a softer, more chocolatey cake. I did shy away and make my own chocolate frosting, but the cake was the best! Hubby says I should have added chocolate shavings, but now he's just getting spoiled! I did add rainbow sprinkles on the kids' pieces.

first time baking cake. i think i used way less frosting than required and decorated with walnuts and almonds. impressed the adults but didn't like the frosting. think most of the people too. the cake was delicious though, not too sweet as i reduced the sugar and very moist. maybe baking this again but will be using another frosting if i do. i greased and floured the pan but some of it kinda stuck to the cake, any suggestions?

Sorry but not inpressed with this cake,had a very plain flavor. My daughter liked it but there again she doesn't like chocolate. I think by far the best cake recipe is " Grandmother's Pound Cake", have made this many times and always comes out great.

I usually make the "perfectly chocolate" chocolate cake, the other chocolate cake recipe submitted by the Hersheys' company. I've made that one over and over again. But this one I like even better. I've got a new favorite, and my mother agrees! Also, the frosting is a new favorite! I made this for my sons' class at school for his birthday, and it went over big. I will make this one from now on!

The cake itself was delicious and very moist, but almost too moist. I had to cook it longer because the toothpick was still coming out gooey. When it was done it took longer than usual to cool down and when it did and I transfered it from the pan it started to split, which I covered with frosting though. Luckily I used parchment paper cicles at the bottom of my pans, which I ususally do anyway, but with it being almost too moist I can see why so many might have had a prob. with it sticking to the pans. The frosting was way too sweet and chocolatey, which I didn't think there was such a thing cuz I like chocolate. Sorry, but I just won't be making this again.

I substituted the sugar with Splenda and used Egg beaters in this recipe.  It was good that I checked them at 25 minutes because they were very dark and almost overdone (!)
The cake tasted good.  It was more dense than I prefer in a chocolate cake, however.  I don't know if that was because of the substitutions, next time I will use sugar and eggs to compare.  The icing was really good.

I don't normally like cake, and I ate a lot of this one.  Very moist and yummy!  But, when they say the batter will be thin, they mean really thin.  It looked like chocolate broth going into the baking pan.

Great cake!  Not to sweet, just the right amount of chocolate.  I made it with chocolate cream cheese frosting instead of the buttercream, and used cherry filling.  It was great!

I usually prefer yellow or white cakes, but this is the best chocolate cake I've ever tasted. Very moist and chocolately. The frosting is richly delicious. If you find it too rich for your tastes, try spreading it on a little thinly. Even my daughter who dislikes chocolate cakes loved this one. Even more helpful is the fact that you'll likely have all the ingredients on hand.

I've been making this recepie for YEARS! It's our favorite and I can't make any other kind or my husband would be mad. I got it out of my Hershey's Chocolate Lover's cookbook and I make it all the time. The frosting is to die for and I could just eat that but it's definatly a match w/ this cake!

This is my favorite chocolate cake to make for bake sale for my kids school. Everyone just loves it. As one person had suggested, using coffee instead of just boiling water; I tried it once and it still tasted excellent. I'm making one tonight as I'm posting my rating. It's very moist and chocolatey. YUMMY!!!!!

SO GOOOOOOD!! I gave away half of the cake (since I thought it would be too much cake for me and my husband) to a friend of mine before tasting the cake. I should have kept all of it.

one word "DELICIOUS" I made this cake twice in 1 week, my family loved it. My husband thought it was the "BEST" cake I ever made. This recipe was very simple, just follow EXACTLY what it says, it should come out great. The icing was great. I don't have 2 round pans I only have a 13x9 square pan. So it definitely makes a lot of icing. I just halfed the icing recipe.
This cake was very moist and delicious. I will definitely be using this recipe for my chocolate cakes. Thank you for the recipe, Enjoy.. :)  !

It was pretty easy to prepare, and came out super moist. The frosting was a little bit drippy, but overall it came out great. My mother who normally doesn't like chocolate cake gave this recipe two thumbs up. I myself don't like chocolate too much and have found myself addicted. I will be definitely baking this in the future, though perhaps with a different frosting.

I was looking for a cake recipe that didn't call for cake flour.  I didn't want to have to run to the grocery store.  Other recipes I've tried in the past that use all-purpose flour tasted so terrible.  You could actually TASTE the flour, this cake, on the other hand, received RAVE reviews.

This is a great, moist chocolate cake recipe!  And the frosting is terrific!!  The possibilities are endless for different kinds of frosting...homemade peanut butter, raspberry, vanilla, caramel...this is a great versatile cake and it's beautiful if made into a layer cake!

I was looking for a "scratch" recipe cake. I think I have found it. I love chocolate cake so much! I had a little trouble with the icing though. I believe it is because of my "less than Kitchenaid" mixer. It doesn't have all of the deluxe attachments, therefore, alot of my ingredients had to be mixed by hand also. I am definitely going to make the cake again, but this time I will try to perfect the icing. I added too much milk and ended up with something close to melted ice cream.

This was an excellant cake. The only thing i did was change 3/4 cup of cocoa. i cut that to 1/2 cup & 1/4 cup of black cocoa that i had. I did the same with the frosting too. Half and half for the cocoas. It was perfect!! My son wanted a black cake with a black fudge frosting, by goodness he got it. :) thanks for the recipe.

This cake was delicious! No one would ever know it was made from scratch. Turned out very moist!
I followed one of the reviews and added 1/4 cup less of sugar as 2 cups sounded like a little too much. Will definetly make again.
Thanks for sharing.

This is a perfect recipe!  It turns out wonderfully moist and flavorful, and the frosting is delicious.  I did use coffee instead of the water, and I think that did make a difference, for the better.  The recipe is so easy to make, after being used to cake recipes that require creaming, and adding ingredients slowly.  This was a breeze, in the oven in just a few minutes, and a big hit with the family! Thanks!

WONDERFUL!  With all of the rave reviews, I wasn't even go to enter a review, but I had to get my 2 cents worth in!  My husband and 6 year old love it!  To quote Truvy (Dolly Parton) from "Steel Magnolias"  ' I served it with ice cream to cut down on the sweetness...'!

My first ever from scratch Chocolate Cake. I'll never buy those cake mixes again. Please forgive me but I've eaten half the cake on my own! So moist and soft and goes heavenly with Carol's Chocolate Cream Cheese Topping. My only problem was I got quite a mound on both my cakes which I had to cut off before icing the cake. But being amatuerish, It slanted a bit so the top cake kept sliding sideways......luckily it was worth it   :)

This was super easy to make and it turned out great.  I made two 9x13 cakes and layered them for a birthday cake to feed a larger group.  I used a different frosting recipe, Whipped Cream Frosting by Tom Parker (which combines whipped cream and cream cheese) and it was excellent.  The cake is even better the next day!

Followed this recipe to the letter, using the 2 9inch round pans.  Unfortunately it makes too much mix for these pans and when in the oven, the batter cooks up over the pan and burns on the bottom of the oven.  Not very happy with this.

This cake was EXCELLENT, but I'd make some changes. 1) There wasn't enough frosting, so I'd double it. 2)Better than doubling the frosting, I think I'll experiement with a different center... perhaps whipped topping with finely chopped pistachio nuts mixed in it? Or perhaps something with a cherry taste? It's unbelievably rare that I think a dessert is too rich, but this one came close. A fresh, crisp center with a contrasting taste might be perfect. This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

I have used this recipe for many years, it is very moist.
I mix a box of chocolate pudding by the instructions adding 1/2 cup of icing sugar.
When cake is cooled a little, drill holes with end of a wooden spoon then pour the pudding over. With it going into the holes as well as icing the cake.
This is my families favorite.

the *best* dark chocolate cake I've ever had -- be sure to use dutch process cocoa. Add semi-sweet chips to the batter after 10 minutes of baking time for an amazing dessert (if you add the chips, top with a raspberry coulis or plain fresh fruit -- the icing is way too rich)

A very moist and rich chocolate cake. I used a bundt cake pan and everything turned out great. I will definitely make this cake again!

This is an impressively moist chocolate cake with a deep dark color!  It baked beautifully at altitude with the standard high altitude adjustments (less baking powder and baking soda depending on how high you live, slightly less oil and sugar) even though the very thin batter had me unnecessarily worried.  I will make this again.

Yummy! This is the first time that I made a chocolate cake from scratch successfully. Very easy and yummy recipe. I did use hot coffee instead of water because it brings out the chocolate flavor more. I also used Rich Chocolate Frosting (found on AR) instead of the frosting in the recipe. Then I spread some Red Raspberry preserves on top. Very good cake.

I have made this cake for many years. It has NEVER failed me (first time I saw the recipe it was in a magazine). I was nervous when I saw how thin the batter was the first time, but it always comes out perfect. Chocolaty and moist and sooooo yummy. I have always frosted it with the frosting recipe it came with, my 4 sons all love this cake. I cannot imagine ever using another chocolate cake recipe. It makes a beautiful double layer cake and so simple as sheet cake.

This came out good, but not the best I have ever had. I made it as a sheet cake, maybe I will try again as a two layer cake and add hot coffee instead of water. UPDATE:::::: Okay, made this again as I said as a two layer cake with hot coffee instead of hot water and it was fabulous! I split the layers in half and filled them with Heavenly Chocolate Mousse from this site and then covered the whole thing with a chocolate glaze and it was the best cake I ever made!

Seriously one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever had or made... I'm not a "cake person" but this one could change my mind. I made it in a 9x13 pan and followed the instructions exactly, and it came out perfectly. The only thing I think could be improved on is the frosting - it was a little one-note sweet up against the richness of the cake. Next time I might experiment with a chocolate cream cheese frosting, or even just adding espresso powder to the buttercream recipe. All in all - this one's pretty foolproof, a real winner.

This is my "go-to" chocolate cake! It is great and so easy to make! It is very chocolaty and extremely versatile - as I have made it in bundt pans, circle pans, 9x13 and even as cupcakes. The frosting is really good too - sometimes I use oil instead of butter as I am concerned whether the cake would need refrigeration after frosting.

Did exactly as written in my Hershey book except two 8" pans instead of the two 9" so that may have resulted in it coming out overly moist and rich and not airy enough. Will not make again, The Hershey's Collector's Chocolate Cake is my preference not sooo sticky moist. I am really sick to my stomach after trying it.

This cake came out moist and delicious. I'm not a fan of chocolate cake, but I made this for a friend and they polished it off in no time! I did frost it with buttercream instead of chocolate frosting, though. This is definitely a keeper!

This is good but not the best chocolate cake I have every had, it is easy to make so in a rush it will be my go to, but I will continue to look for the ultimate cake.  If you make this no one will dislike it, but I am into chocolate.

I just used the cake portion of this recipe to make cupcakes and it was divine! This has to be some of the most moist cake I have ever had. I halved the recipe to make 12 cupcakes and they were done in 20 min. I can only imagine what this would be like as a layer cake...next time I will try that.

I gave the cake 4 stars because one layer broke apart in 3 pieces and the other in 2.  I can't figure out why as I followed the recipe to a tee and greased and floured the pans.  The cake seemed sticky.  Other than that it had an excellent taste.  Was very moist.  The icing was so creamy and yummy.   I recommend doubling the icing recipe for the 2 layer cake.  I actually had to anyway in order to "paste" the cake together.  I will make again and hopefully the layers will stay in one piece next time.

The cake was awesome!!!  Didn't care much for the frosting.  To much cocoa.  I tasted the frosting in the bowl before I put it on the cake and I kept adding more and more powdered sugar trying to even out the taste.  It just didn't work for me.  I ended up making some cream cheese frosting.  that turned out great.

The cake gets 5 stars.  Wonderfully moist and foolproof.  The frosting is good but not fantastic 3-4 stars.  I will be on a hunt for a new frosting recipe, but the cake recipe is a keeper.

This wasn't what I expected but it was delicious.  The consistency was almost like a brownie, very dense and moist.  The sweetness was just right and it was good and chocolatey.  I didn't make the frosting but instead poured chocolate icing (One Minute Chocolate Icing) over the top.

This recipe comes off the Heshey's Cocoa box, and is delicioous.  I used 2 9" round nonstick pans, and had no problems with it rising over.  I only had to cook about 28 mins. and it was perfection.  I used the caramel frosting v from this site and was delicous. (I also put the crushed heath bits on top, mmm).  My husbands birthday cake, and he is a pain to cook for as he is quite plain on the palette and wanted a white frosting, but loved this cake...A winner.

This has to be the best chocolate cake I've ever made and by far one of the best I've ever tasted!  Trust me, if you're looking to make a chocolate cake, look no further.  I made this for a friend's birthday party and it disappeared ridiculously quickly between the 6 of us.

I ended up making this in a 9" round double-high cake pan (you know, one of those with a removable bottom) because that's what I had, but it turned out just fine.  It rose a little bit over the top, but nothing to really worry about since it was cooked enough by that time.  Naturally I had to increase the cooking time though, but it was no problem.  I just cooked it until a toothpick came out clean from the center. As it's probably been said before 100 times (and it says in the recipe as well), the batter is THIN to a surprising degree - you will be surprised, but there's no need to worry - it's what gives it the amazing moist quality when it comes out. I used a different frosting recipe though. 
There's really nothing more to be said aside from "you have to try this cake".  So, you have to try this cake.

Yum.  Made it for sis's bday and she loved it.  It was pretty sticky, so grease well.  I added kahlua to the batterand it came out great.  I also made used a mocha whipped cream instead of the one here.  Stayed moist in fridge.

This is the first time I've made a cake from scratch and I have to say it was amazing!! I used the chocolate ganache recipe from this site instead of the buttercream frosting. The cake was great the first day but after a night in the fridge it was even more moist and yummy!

I have been in search for a rich, moist cake recipe forever! And I've finally found it! This cake was a hit with everyone that tried it and this is what I'm going to make my friends wedding cake with... although, i can't comment on the icing as I didn't try it. Instead I used a ganache... 1 part thick cream to 2 parts choc, heat together in microwave till melted, let cool, whip till fluffy then chill till no longer a runny consistency... YUMMY!

The cake was excellent. In fact, if it got bad reviews its because people don't know how to make it properly. I found the icing too sweet though.

Very easy and delicious cake.  The cake came right out of the pans and was moist and delicious.  I made this cake for my 10 year old's birthday party and everyone loved it!! The icing recipe definitely needs to be doubled to adequately frost a layer cake though.  There is no excuse to use a cake mix with a chocolate cake recipe this easy and delicious!!

I was disappointed in this recipe.  It was good, but nothing like I'd hoped after reading all the rave reviews.  It tasted like a brownie.  We honestly thought the mixes out of a box turn out better.  Really liked the frosting tho.  :/

This cake is absolutely delicious.  It's the kind of cake you'd find in a good restaurant at 5 bucks a slice, in my opinion.  The cake is not overly sweet and the icing compliments it perfectly.

VERY FLAVORFUL!!!  Yummy!!  I used White Mountain Frosting from Betty Crocker.  The frosting was more like marshmallow, but it still turned out ok.  Will definitely make again whenever I have a chocolate crave!

This was a great chocolate cake!  I made it for my mom's birthday but didn't use the recipe for frosting included but a regular buttercream frosting and she loved it!  I especially liked it because it wasn't too dense...nice and light! I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a good dark chocolate cake!

I halved this recipe as I just wanted to test it to see if it would be suitable for a Mother's Day cake. IT MOST CERTAINLY IS! This cake is delicious, with much less fat than cake mixes! 
Now will test out frosting recipes...

This chocolate cake is to die for.  I made it for my cousins birthday and her and the whole family thought it was amazing.  I used a chocolate ganache to frost it (which is just 16 ounces semi-sweet chocolate and 1 cup heavy cream, recipe on this website)It was a hit, Thanks for the great recipe!

This is an AWESOME cake!  I love chocolate cake!  Even so, I find that the frosting is a bit sweet with the cake.  I've been make this for years, but next time I'm going to try a nice cream cheese frosting on the cake (I LOVE cream cheese frosting too!)

Well, it didnt look too pretty but it sure did taste good, I liked the flavor. I dont know what I did wrong but I had the WORST tme trying to frost this cake, it kept tearing.  I used "creamy chocolate frosting" from this site. I think the frosting I used was really made the difference. Then used some chocolate sprinkles. If you dont like a spongy cake, keep looking! Thanx

Moist.  We used the Cinnamon Coffee Frosting from this site instead of the one given.  We made coffe flavored Granny's Ice Cream, also from site, to serve with the cake.  This cake is similar to Crazy Cake.

This was my first time to make a cake entirely from scratch and now I would have to be desperate to go back to a boxed cake mix.  This was for my husband's birthday and he loved it.  It turned out perfect and so did the icing.  I doubled the icing recipe since we are chocoholics and love extra icing.  My husband, said that the cake was sooo good that it didn't even need icing.  The icing is just what it should be -- "icing".  We are two happy chocoholics with this rich and super moist recipe.  For those of you who had thin icing, add the milk  a little at a time until you reach the desired spreading consistency.

Excellent Chocolate Cake recipe.  My husband came across this recipe one day when he was in the mood for something sweet and chocolate.  I've lost track of the number of times we've made this.  We double the recipe for both the cake and icing and bake the cake in 2-9x13 pans, it makes a very impressive layered cake.  That way when company leaves there is still some left over for us to enjoy again.

This was really good, but you need to stir the frosting quite a bit to get it to form.

This was the best homemade cake I have ever eaten much less made.  I usually prefer box mixes because they tend to be more moist.  I did use coffee instead of boiling water,yum.  I highly recommend this cake.  It is easy enough for beginners too.

I read all the reviews and decided what the heck let me try this cake.  Well I was delighted to find that this is the best homemade chocolate cake in the WORLD!!! it was just like stated moist and dark chocolate.  I would however cut down on the sugar next time.  I made it with chocolate chips melted down with in heavy cream in the middle and then I topped it all off with chocolate whipped cream.  it was sooooooooo good thank you for this great cake recipie

The cake was very moist and delicious but I didn't care much for the icing. Tastes great with a sour cream frosting though and maybe next time I will try a chocolate cream cheese frosting. I will definitely make this again!

This was such a good cake.  I even messed up the frosting a little (I spread the frosting over the cake and then realized that I had forgotten to put in the other half of the sugar and cocoa, hee hee hee), but no one even noticed!  It tasted wonderful!

I made this cake for the first time this weekend, for a very tough, hard to please crowd of 22 (risky) and everyone loved it. This is the first homemade chocolate cake that has totally impressed me with it's flavor and moistness. It's already earned it's place as THE chocolate cake in my house. I will make it many, many times.

After reading the reviews I decided to try this recipe. It is fantastic! I was concerned about how thin the batter was when adding the water. I was happily pleased with the final results. This one is a keeper for sure!! This is the best one to try first. It is better than Applebee's chocolate cake - and you will have some left over.

Everyone loves this cake.  It's easy enough for a beginner to make.  You can substitute applesauce for the oil, use skim milk, and the cake is practically fat free, and everyone still raves about how good it is!

This is a fabulous cake! I made in a 9x13, but intend on making a layer cake this weekend. I highly recommend this recipe. Out of this world. One note-make a double batch of frosting-one is not enough!!!!!!!!

I love this chocolate cake. Since I first made this cake a few years ago, it's the only chocolate cake I even think of making.  It's very moist and easy to make.  The guys I work with love it.  I get asked to make it at least once a week, but I alternate between chocolate, peanutbutter, and mint frostings.

Big hit at a party.  I put white and dark chocolate shavings on top of the icing and it looked very nice.  I also accidently forgot the salt and thankfully it didn't seem to alter anything horribly.

I've been making this chocolate cake recipe for at least 20 years, when I first saw it printed in a magazine.  I used it over  and over again for all  six of my children's birthday parties. Teachers even asked me for the recipe.  Delicious, moist and super easy.
