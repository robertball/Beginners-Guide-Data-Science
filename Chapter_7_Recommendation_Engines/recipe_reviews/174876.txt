Do not make this recipe unless you plan on eating the whole pan. Otherwise you will anyway. I make this without the nuts. These brownies don't hang around long.

These were good, the gooeyness I enjoy most about brownies comes only from the chocolate chips.  If it weren't for that, these brownies would be too cakey for me.

These brownies were a huge hit with my husband and kids! I thought they were too sweet, all I could do was a eat a little bite. But I only had a half cup of peanuts instead of a full cup. I think if I would have had the full amount of nuts they would have cut the sweetness of the brownies better. I will definently make these again for my family!

My mom made these when I was growing up. Everyone loves them when they are taken somewhere.
I serve them warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and drizzle with caramel sauce. To die for!

We've been making this recipe at our house for years using German chocolate cake mix.  People always love these rich brownies.

These are so good!  My son requested brownies for his birthday school treat, and these were a hit.  I asked him yesterday what he wanted to bring for the school holiday party, and he asked for these again.  So easy and so good!

Took these to work and they soon disappeared. They're soft, chewy and wonderfully sweet (ie, not too much, not too little). Will definitely try again and try different variations. This time I left off the nuts, just because the boyfriend doesn't like them. But honestly, they weren't really missed!

I absolutely love this recipe, although the one I make calls for 50 caramels. Which I LOVE. Everyone always wants this recipe and it is not possible to eat just one.

A friend gave me this recipe long ago, minus the nuts. In our version you cut the squares small and coat each one in powdered sugar, which helps as the squares are very sticky.

These are almost like a candy.
