Crispy on the outside, softer on the inside, everyone loved them.  You have to let them cool for them to get crispy.  I would definitely make these again.

I made these tonight because I needed something to do. The snow is falling fast keeping me indoors and t.v. is always lame.   I thought the spices needed bumping up so I doubled all the spices and then some.  I added some ground fresh black pepper (About 1/8th teaspoon) and freshly ground seal salt too (I ground the sea salt over the cookies before popping them in the oven). I like sharp flavours! I didn't have canola oil so I used 1/2 cup salted butter.  I added 1 1/2 cups whole frozen cranberries for some tartness and probably doubled the raisins.  I had no egg substitute so used 3 large eggs. Bake for 15 minutes.  Remove from oven and loosen from cookie sheet.  Let cool and transfer to container.  AWESOME!!! Very light and full of flavour!!! If you don't like strong spices don't follow my alterations!!!!!
