Delicious exactly as directed.  I topped it with fresh mango,pineapple and red onion salsa. Flavors went great together.

This is very easy to make, and tastes excellent!!  My husband said it's the best fish I've ever made.  :)  I did have to substitute some things, like balsamic vinagrette (instead of balsamic vinegar) and a ginger salad dressing (instead of grated fresh ginger).  It still turned out great, so it'd probably be even better if I made it with the correct ingredients!

Excellent.  I had never made mahi mahi before so I was a bit worried but this recipe turned out excellent!
