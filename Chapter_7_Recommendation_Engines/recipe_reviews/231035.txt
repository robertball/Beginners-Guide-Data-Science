I will definitely make this many more times as a side, especially to fried catfish!  YUMMY!  This was the first time I have made turnip greens!  I altered the recipe by omitting the olive oil and using just the bacon grease to fry the onions & garlic.  I used Hormel Natural Choice Bacon b/c it does not use hormone added pork or nitrites/nitrates.  Also, I omitted the red pepper flakes as the black pepper was enough kick for us.  My teenage boys gobbled this up!  My mom, who doesn't like turnip greens, like them now! A definite keeper for my family for such a healthy side of greens, onions & garlic.  Thank you for sharing, Chef Scott! I'm looking forward to mixing the greens as the recipe calls for.

First time ever to cook greens. I never thought it being my first time  to cook  greens, my  family and friends tell me that they were the best greens they have ever eaten. I am asked to cook this anytime we get together for any occasion and always get the same response, BEST GREENS EVER

Delicious!  I used kale to replace the turnip greens because thatâ€™s what I had. Otherwise I stayed with the recipe. I will definitely make again. However, I will use only half the amount of onion, and half the bacon.

I always follow a recipe exactly as written when I make it for the first time.  That being said, this dish was absolutely delicious and everyone enjoyed the dish.   The family was asking for more, but I did not make enough.  This dish will definitely be in the family meals rotation in the future.

Added to my favorites!  Great recipe!   Didn't have any of the greens listed, so I used Swiss Chard out off the garden.
