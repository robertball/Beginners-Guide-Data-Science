Add a good tablespoon of Cajun seasonings to the flour and be certain to cook the pepper and onion till they nearly melt, remove from the pan and THEN brown the chops and return all the vegetables after. It was de-li-cious

This was easy to prepare and SO good!  I too added some cajun seasoning to it.  I served it over garden vegetable flavored rice, and I am enjoying leftovers as I type.  This is definitely a keeper that I would make again/serve to company.

Followed some suggestions re: creole seasoning, made a huge difference.  Less simmering for the thinner chops I used, and had an opportunity to use some leftover yellow and red bell peppers.  Threw in a can of tomato sauce for a little extra to spoon on mashed potatoes. Family raved.

Creole Pork Chops' Haiku: "So disappointed. Smell was indescribable. But taste was lacking." Only change that I made to the recipe was to add 1 TB of cajun seasoning to the flour b4 browning the chops, otherwise, I followed as instructed, and my mouth was salivating in divine anticipation of biting into these. But e-gads! This tasted like a whole lot of nothing; bland and yawn-inducing, so I added a hefty squirt of Sriracha sauce, but even that didn't make my tastebuds jig.

Great recipe! We ended up cutting the pork chops into bite size pieces and added some spices to both the flour and the sauce. They were so tender and juicy. Everyone gave it a 5 or more and said they want it again soon.

Pork chops were very tender and great tasting. I added a little creole seasoning to them also and on the peppers and onions I sweated them out first before adding to the chops. Would make again.

YUM!  I did as the submitter suggested and made this in my slow cooker. It was so tender it fell off the bone.  Only a fork was needed, no knife.  My only change was to use a bottle of "Swamp Sauce", that I had brought back from a favorite restaurant in Florida (Rum Bay on Palm Island), in place of the tomatoes.  This disappeared so quickly that I never got a photo.  Next time!  Thank you for sharing, EMMI331!

I used fire roasted diced tomatoes, added creole seasoning, left out the Worcestershire, and added some tomato sauce so I would have extra sauce to dip bread in, slow cooked for 5 hours then shredded the pork and served over rice. I ended up with no leftovers and nothing but compliments! Great recipe!!

1/30/2012: Added about a tbsp of creole seasoning to the flour just to make it a little spicy.  Otherwise, I followed the directions as is and it was delicious! UPDATE 3/3/2017: Not sure why I rated 5 stars because without additional seasoning, this recipe is bland for us. In 2012, I used 1 tbsp Tony Chachere's Original Creole seasoning (loads of salt and MSG in it). This time, I used 1 tbsp Creole Seasoning Blend (from this site) and felt more seasoning was needed...about 1/2 tbsp more of this particular blend for three 1.5" chops. Without addition of any creole or cajun seasoning, the recipe gets 2 stars; with the additional seasoning I'd give it 5 stars (replace the seasoning salt with a creole/cajun blend).

Though good they still seemed to be lacking something even with the following changes that I made. I cooked the vegetables in the oil prior to browning the chops and added 3 or 4 cloves of minced garlic.  I also omitted the salt and used Creole seasoning and a dash of cayenne pepper in the flour to liven up the chops.  Added an additional 1 Tbsp. of Creole seasoning and a few dashes of cayenne pepper to the tomato mixture.  I think next time I make it I'll go with my gut instinct and add a couple of stalks of celery to my onions and pepper and see if that's what was missing.

Pretty good all things considered. I browned them in a skillet then put them in a 9x13 dish and covered them with the sauce then covered with foil and baked at 350 for 45 minutes. Didn't have any creole seasoning so I used some garlic powder and cayenne pepper. My husband loved it!

Ever since living in New Orleans, I have made this recipe.  I do tend to like things a bit spicier, so I added one fresh jalapeno (with seeds) and 3 large coarsely chopped cloves of fresh garlic, along with 2 TBSP of the Cajun seasoning.  I, too, saute` the veggies first, in olive oil, and add to the tomatoes and sprinkle liberally with dried basil...THEN I saute` the pork chops in the remaining olive olive and sear both sides and then add to the "stew"....served over rice with crusty French bread on the side is how my family likes it.  Nice to see this recipe posted!

This is a great recipe. The pork chops do come out literally fork-tender but thoroughly cooked. I blended some cajun seasoning into the flour. I'm not always fond of pork, but this is just a great- tasting recipe. I never really thought about pork and tomatoes going together well until now.

Excellent!  I used shallots since I ran out of onions.  I made the recipe with 6 bonless pork chops vs. the 4 in the recipe, and doubled the tomato mixture.  Plain white rice would be quite good with the juices.

Made this tonight, and it got two thumbs up from all my ladies.. I added a pinch of creole seasoning to it. Everything else was by the recipe. Turned out great. Served with seasoned rice.

I made this using 1 TB. of MCCormack Grill Mates Pork Rub, in place of the Creole Seasoning. The sauce was excellent and the pork chops just ok. They were the thick cut boneless ones from Sam's and seemed too dry to me. Next time I'll probably use bone in for this recipe. Today I'm going to try useing this sauce recipe with thin sliced round steak cut into strips. I really enjoyed the sauce and think it would go well with chicken and beef. Not sure whether we'll have noodles or mashed potatoes with it yet.

Recipe was GREAT! I did tweek it a bit. I had creole seasoning that I added to the flour before searing the chops and added about 1 cup of chicken broth after adding the kitchen cut roma tomatoes. Then I sprinkled a little more creole on top of the mixture before covering it, be careful though it can heat up the taste of the dish real quick...had my neighbors over for the taste test....and they loved it. I served it over brown rice...FABULOUS!!! However next time I will use center cut chops with bone., I used boneless, not as tender.

This recipe makes very tender, tasty chops with a great sauce. Best of all, the house smelled wonderful while they were cooking! This is very homey comfort food.  I served it over rice, which soaked up the flavorful sauce.  As my husband said, this needs to become a "regular"!

I added some shrimp at the end to put a twist on it, but it was great without! Also made my own creole seasoning with only a little bit of cayenne so my kids would actually eat this. My dad and my boyfriend scarfed it down, but the kids didn't seem to care for it as much as they liked the Creole Tuna on this site.

As someone else said this recipe is bland & it's truly lacking something.  We did not like it well enough to make again in order to tweak it.  Sorry, was hoping this was a keeper but not.

Thanks for a great recipe.  Totally easy.  The only thing I did different was to add minced garlic and creole spice.  Served it with rice.  Can't wait for lunch to  have the leftovers.
