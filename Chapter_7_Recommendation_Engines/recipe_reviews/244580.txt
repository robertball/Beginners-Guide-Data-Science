First time trying Swanson Seafood Stock and I can't wait to cook more fish with it! It adds lots of flavor and kept the salmon juicy. I will be making this again and again!

The only change I made is that I used green onion in place of the shallot and then I grilled the salmon because that is what we prefer. I had never tried the seafood stock and I absolutely loved it. I did however have a hard time with the sauce not getting thick and my cream separated. I am gravy challenged though so it might have been a user error and no fault of the recipe? The flavor was great and I will definitely be buying the seafood stock again!
