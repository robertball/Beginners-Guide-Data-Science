I love green beans on the crisp side, so i knew i was gonna love this right away! In addition to the lemon juice i added the zest as well..(i tend to do that with anything now that calls for lemon juice)I chopped my garlic into rough smaller chunks and used a sprinkle of Greek seasoning. I didn't find there was a need to marinate these in a bag..i just tossed them around in a bowl, and placed them on my sheet,let them sit like that before popping into the oven. Next time i may broil at a higher temp just to get some more brown edges. Thanks for the nice refreshing way to cook green beans!

I was intrigued by broiling green beans because I had never prepared them that way and it seemed so easy!   The end result for my family was that they were just ok.  The light lemon & garlic flavor was good, but, I think the broiling dried them out a little bit.  I will prepare them with this fresh marinade again, but, think I would prefer them sauteed instead.

I would actually give this 4.5 stars, which is the current average rating.  Nice, light flavour and really easy.  (Skip the bag and just toss beans with the other ingredients in the pan before broiling.)  I did find it took at least 10 minutes of broiling (stirring occasionally) until they were cooked to our liking, and they were still crunchy.

It was just ok. I was really hoping this was going to have a nice fresh taste with the lemon but it wasn't very strong (I doubled the seasoning). They were definitely crispy  but not in a steamed and crispy way that I had wanted.

I followed the recipe, but left out the parm. cheese.  The next evening I reheated them by warming them up in a hot non-stick skillet.  They were still crisp and even better the next day!

I love crisp beans and these are delicious! I was serving them with a cheesy main dish, so I didn't add the pamesan. I cut the beans into bite sized pieces.  Also, I didn't use a bag to marinate, I just combined in in a bowl, let it set, and stirred it around a few times. I will defiantly make these again!

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out delicious. I love crisp green beans, though. If you like them softer, then this is not the recipe for you.

Yum! A nice way to make green beans more interesting.  This has a nice texture too, not limp and not semi-cooked crisp. The lemon adds a great zip, and the parmesan contrasts with the flavours nicely.  I'd make this again for sure.

Although these were just 4 stars in my opinion, my family loved them, even my husband who is suspiciously "allergic to vegetables" ate them all up. Simple, I marinated them while cooking the rest of dinner. I popped them in the oven at 400 for 7 minutes, and they came out still a bit crunchy but good. Thanks!

These were quick and very tasty. Will definitely make again. I left out the parmesan, but added some of Missing Ingredient's Well Seasoned Greek Seasoning.

I made these on the barbeque with the ribs and potatoes I was making for dinner. I omitted the salt as I sprinkled with feta, they were very delicious and the lemon makes them very fresh tasting.

I forgot to add the Parmesan cheese, but it was still good without it.
I did enjoy the recipe, but I have a 'go-to' that I prefer a little more.  However, my husband complimented me on the green beans today, so I consider that a win!  I like a lot of seasoning, so I might add a bit more next time.  Thanks for a tasty recipe!

Perfect just as it's written. I forgot the parm but it still tasted great. Even the hub that thinks lemon doesn't belong in food like it.

My husband, two boys and parents all loved this recipe. Meat was tender, flavor of the burgers was great and they all loved the gravy.

Excellent and easy recipe.  I made as described (tho with a little less salt, maybe a third of a teaspoon) and wouldn't change a thing.

Flavor was good and used feta instead of Parmesan, per the recipe submitter's suggestion. Did not necessarily care for the broil method.

I made a slightly altered version of this recipe, using Greek Seasoning from the AllRecipes AllStars Canada Missing Ingredient box in the place of the garlic, salt and pepper.
I really enjoyed the crispiness that broiling brought to the beans (and asparagus!) and the Greek seasoning sure kicked things up!
Super delicious with the Parmesan and would also have been great with crumbled feta, as suggested.
