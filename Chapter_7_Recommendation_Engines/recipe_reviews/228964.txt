This was a really tasty pasta dish even my 2 year old enjoyed it. I used a Sprializer for my Zucchini and didn't bother with the Salt step. I sauteed my mushrooms and zucchini on high in a wok for about 3 minutes and then set. I also used my own Alfredo recipe( with roasted garlic) in place of a jar sauce and Of course salt and peppered to taste.
