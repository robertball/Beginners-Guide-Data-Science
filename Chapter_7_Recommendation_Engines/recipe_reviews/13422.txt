My husband, who is italian, loves this soup!  It's super easy and healthy.  The only thing I changed is I pinched little sections of Jennie-O turkey italian sausage out of the casing and formed into little meatballs. Browned them in a separate pan and added them to the onions & garlic after sweating them. The meatballs really made it into a meal. It tasted awesome. I also think the adobo spice is a must!  This recipe is a keeper!

I love this soup. I have always made it with cannelini (white) beans & also add a box of frozen cheese pierogi. The kids pick out the parts they like.

This is a very easy, tasty rendition of an old Italian favorite. I like to add homemade, tiny meatballs to the soup while it is cooking.  Yummy!

I didn't have Adobo seasoning so that may be why the flavors just felt flat to me as is (although the recipe says it's optional).  It felt like it needed some sort of acid, so I squeezed a half a lemon into the soup, and it turned into a spectacular dish.

It is hard to find good looking escarole where I live so I just substituted spinach.  It was still wonderful and perfect for my husband who is a diabetic.  All that fiber and protein, yum.  Thanks for sharing.

I pinched the sausage into small pieces before baking them, which takes some of the fat out of frying them before adding them to the soup.  I also would suggest adding raw egg during the last few minutes of cooking.  Don't stir, but allow the egg to cook in large clumps.  This is how my Italian Grandmother served it, with grated or shredded parm on top!

My husband and I love this soup...however, we like it with more broth so I use one large 48 oz. can and 1 small 14.5 oz. can of chicken broth.  I also made it the first time with navy beans, then tried cannellini beans because the store was out of the navy beans..we seem to like the cannellini beans a bit more.  Also, I use one head of escarole that I wash, then rip..no measuring or chopping (it just makes this recipe easier than it already is).  I then simmer to perfection for 30 minutes covered..YUM!

This soup is delicious, much more flavorful than I expected it to be.  I made it exactly to the recipe except I used white northern beans instead of navy and left out the adobo seasoning.  I have no idea how allrecipes.com calculates this at 226 calories per serving.  Chicken broth is 10 cal/serving and beans are 80 cal/serving.  Add onions, garlic, and escarole - nothing else - so where do all the other calories come from?  I'm calling this a 120-calorie bowl of soup, max.  That makes it taste even better! :)

this was so incredibly good i can hardly find words for it!  i only changed it slightly, and used vegetable stock (i'm vegetarian), and only used 3 cups (i like stuff like this thick and stodgy)---it was delicious, and filling;  this will be a once-a-week dish for me!!!  thank you so much!

This soup was super fast and delicious! My 2 and 5 year-olds couldn't get enough!  Husband really liked it, too.  Unfortunately, my 8 year old was turned off by the escarole.  Like another reviewer, I also added some turkey sausage balls (Shady Brook Farms spicy Italian sausage links that I removed the casing from and pinched into little balls) that I cooked separately, and replaced the navy beans with the larger cannelini beans.  The Adobo seasoning added the perfect spice.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it was a bit too salty, but that could be the combination of the Adobo, Italian sausage and regular chicken broth.  Next time I'll use reduced sodium chicken broth.  Served it with a fresh baguette for a light dinner.  Really easy and good.

Very simple and satisfying soup. I added some Mrs.Dash seasoning in place of the adobo seasoning. I will be eating this for lunch this week, I think I will be satisfied!

Awesome soup. I only used 1 can of beans and added about 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and cut up chicken apple sausage. I also added little more broth as I wanted little more broth.

I was pleasantly surprised at how much my husband really enjoyed this soup.  Of course, he really likes bean soup and he had to put hot sauce on it, but he ate a healthy soup.  What can I say?  WOW!

Perhaps it would have been better with the adobe, which we opted not to use because of my dad's low-sodium dietary restriction. I ended up having to add several herbs to make it palatable because it seemed bland.

I just made this soup and it is delicious. Next time I will add tiny meatballs, not that it needs anything but just because it sounds so good.  This couldn't be easier. It's a rainy, cold night here in NY, and this was perfect with grated parm cheese on top and toasted garlic bread. YUM! Thanks for sharing. Wil continue to make this all winter.

One of the best soups I've ever made, my husband had it for lunch and dinner! I couldn't find canned navy beans so I used a similar white bean : great northern. I read the reviews beforehand and took some tips. The low sodium broth is a must and I actually used a quart plus an additional can. I also had Luganica  sausage in the freezer and from the casing, squeezed out little balls and sautéed them first. Also added about 1/2 cup each of finely chopped carrots and celery and I sautéed them first with the sweet onion.  Served the soup with fresh warm French bread. Fabulous meal! Not just soup...

I too added Jennie O turkey sausage (cooked in separate pan). I substituted Seasoned Salt for ADOBE because I do not like monosodium glutamate. Also finely chopped two stalks celery and one large carrot to make 'trinity' with the onion.  This soup recipe is awesome! Hubby LOVES it! :)

Needs Parmesan cheese.   Top off a bowl of soup with the Parmesan cheese to reall set it off.   Otherwise good soup but needs the extra zing.

Great Soup! Left out the adobo and beans. Added 3 cups kale,3  sliced carrots,3 sliced celery stalks, 8oz. sliced mushrooms and a tsp. of dry parsley.Simmered for 10 min., then added escarole, kale and mushrooms for additional 5 min. Greens were still a little crisp. The mushrooms added a unique flavor.

My friends loved this when I served it to them. It tastes even better the second day.

The only thing I would change about this recipe is to decrease the cooking time to 15-20 minutes. I cooked it the whole 35 minutes, and the escarole was a bit overcooked.

I also used cannellini beans instead of navy and added a bit of chard and rosemary to the recipe.
 
Definitely a winner.

Very tasty & easy! I used cannellini beans and also added a package of crumbled chourico and a box of potato/cheese pierogi (another reviewer's suggestion) ..pierogi were kind of big- next time may use tortellini or gnocchi.  Everyone loved it!

Great tasting soup.  I was raised on this. Although it tastes very close to my mothers'it dosen't quite compare totally, but it is close enough. I enjoyed it very much.

I love this soup. It gets better the next day. I serve it in shallow bowls with toasted baguette in the middle and topped with parmesan. Yummy winter soup!

Great taste, easy to prepare.  Crumbled italian sausage and tiny pasta would be nice additions (similar to the Pasta with Greens N Beans recipe, but in a soup form).  Leftovers were even better.

I substituted frozen chopped spinach for the escarole. Very nutritious. Soup was a bit bland (even after adding some extra adobo seasoning).

Absolutely delicious...I've made this a few times and no need to change a thing. I had tiny meatballs sometimes but that's it.

Loved this!  I doubled the broth and beans, but kept the rest of the measurements and added pan-cooked chopped pork sausage.  Was so good and so easy!

I left out the adobo seasoning and substituted 1/4lb chopped Pancetta(italian bacon, is rolled up if on deli) chopped up which I found packaged in my deli case.  It's smoky like a cross between ham and bacon, yummy for any greens recipe.  Used more soup too because this recipe came a bit thick for the head of escarole I was using.  Nice Italian recipe if used without the adobo seasoning.  Can flavor with ham hocks also if done as Italians do too.  My grandpa was straight from Italy so I know this recipe can be made these ways, if you're looking for the Italian version, LOL.

Homemade soup can't get any easier than this! Delicious, even without the adobo, which I could not find.
