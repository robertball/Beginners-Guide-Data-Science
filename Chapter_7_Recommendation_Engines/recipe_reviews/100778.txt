While Hubs is a Classic Martini kind of guy and I like My Favorite Chocolate Martini, we have fun trying mini versions of new drinks from time to time.  I wasn’t sure I’d like this one, thinking it would be too sweet for both of us.  But we’re in Naples now, and I thought the name was kind of catchy.  While I was taking photos of the drinks, Hubs was already into the leftovers and remarked, “Hey, this isn’t bad!”  We offered each other our traditional toasts, took a good sip and declared it a sleeper hit.  Too bad we didn’t make more!  Now… we didn’t have mango vodka, so we used regular vodka, and admittedly about half as much as directed.  But the rest we followed just as the submitter intended.  It is a wonderful blend of the ingredients that come together to form a taste all its own – no one flavor is easily discernible.  It’s light, refreshing, not too sweet at all, and really does have a tropical flavor.  We enjoyed this very much! I love it when I'm the first reviewer of a recipe and I can rate it so highly and enthusiastically!
