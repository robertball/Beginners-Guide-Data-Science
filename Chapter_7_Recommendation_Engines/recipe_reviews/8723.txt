If you're looking for a baked barbecue chicken recipe, then this recipe is probably not for you. The sauce you make here is less complex, a little sweeter and fuller than barbecue sauce. Seeing the ingredient list, the lack of traditional barbecue sauce items was obvious from the beginning, si I prepared this the recipe with that in mind. And this baked chicken dish is just outstanding! It was very simple and fast to put together, the thighs stayed wonderfully moist and tender, and the sauce added a lovely yet gentle sweet-tomato flavor to the overall dish. As always, I initially make a recipe as written, and this one was treated that way. When I make it again (and I will make it many more times!), I will make three slight changes. I'll make a couple slits in the skin of each thigh (avoiding cutting into the meat) to allow the rendered fat to drain better, I will place the thighs on a rack in the baking pan so they don't sit in the rendered fat during cooking, and I will turn the pieces each 15 minutes during the cooking, turning them over each time. This will probably provide for a crisper skin as well as better caramelizing of the sauce. We just loved it!

This is one of those recipes that I can count on to work every time!  The ingredients are usually in my pantry, and the ease of throwing this together can't be beat!  From experience I can tell you that the best cut of meat to use with this is boneless skinless thighs. I find the regular thighs with the skin on are just too fatty, and the skin doesn't get crispy.  Another variation I use is pork chops.

This was an easy and good recipe.  I did use boneless and skinless chicken thighs, added more garlic, and cooked for 30 min.

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe! Changes I made: I added more garlic powder (we loooove garlic in this house) and a couple dashes of ground ginger also. I seasoned the chicken before putting the glaze on with a little salt, pepper, and onion powder. I used golden corn syrup, dark soy and regular ol' Heinz ketchup! I made DOUBLE the sauce because I wanted to serve it over hot buttered white rice. It was delicious! Definitely in the books for keeps.

Wonderful alternative to cooking on the grill. My husband loved the soy sauce flavor. I used honey instead of the corn syrup like other reviewers suggested.

Fantastic!!! I never review a recipe if I have changed it, since it doesn't seem fair. But I did this time due to lack of ingredients (surprising I know with such a short list of ingredients). I didn't have enough corn syrup so I added honey until I had enough. I was also short on ketchup, so I added chili sauce until I had enough. WOW!!! I did add a little onion powder and black pepper for some kick, but it would've been fine without them I'm sure. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, but we all agree that the sauce would ROCK on anything pork!!! Just be sure to thicken the sauce if you want to spoon any over the meat. My sauce was a tad runny but it may have been my fault. What a great, inexpensive recipe!! Keep em coming!!!

My whole family enjoyed this dish as is, my kids like it so I'm happy.  Tonight I am making it again and will probably tweak it a touch to give it a little more kick.  I nstead of basting I turn the chicken every twenty minutes or so to get a good, all over glaze.

My two year old twins love this recipe...which makes it worth five stars in my book. It helps that my husband and I also enjoy it.  I use honey instead of corn syrup and substitute Carolina Treat BBQ sauce for half of the ketchup.  I also use freshly chopped garlic.

I enjoyed this recipe. My 4 year old son that does not like eating meat could not get enough of it. I used crushed garlic instead of the garlic powder. Taking in to consideration the other reviews that stated that the chicken was bland, I spiced the chicken on both sides with some chicken spice before brushing on the sauce.  I will be making this recipe again.

Oh wow...this was GOOOOOD!  It was quick, easy, and delicious!  PERFECT for a busy mom such as myself.  I didn't make too many changes...I used honey because I didn't have any corn syrup and I added a little more garlic and a dash of liquid smoke (hickory).  My kids LOVED this.  I will definitely make again.  Thanks!

My kids are gobbling this up right this minute!

This was a last minute "! What's for dinner?!" recipe search - I had honey but no corn syrup, and I like the flavor alot. Not ketchup-y, but less sassypants than barbeque. Might try this with molasses the next time I have some in the house, and up the garlic powder just a bit. Since I decided to leave the skin on my bone-in thighs (tuck some sauce under the skin!), I baked this on a rack over the baking pan to allow the fat to drip off. This increased the baking time a bit, so plan accordingly. As with any sweet sauce, the stuff on the bottom of the pan is basically charcoal, so definitely line your pan with parchment - I'm very glad I did! I turned and basted every 15 minutes, added some fresh ground pepper to each side on the last turn and zapped them under the broiler for a minute at the end to just set the sauce a tiny bit more. With a brown & wild rice mixture, my kids (me too!) are very satisfied customers right now!

I made this as written the first time. While we enjoyed it a lot, the sauce didn't seem to have much depth. So this time, I added fresh chopped garlic and ginger, and a couple tablespoons of Hoisin sauce. It was perfect that way. Also sprinkling on sesame seeds and chopped green onion after it's done really makes a nice presentation. Thanks!

This is Really easy, all of the ingredients I had on hand.  The changes I made were using half honey half agave nectar in place of corn syrup as we don't have corn syrup, and like other reviewers.  I added about 1 teaspoon garlic powder, and about 1 teaspoon sriracha chile sauce, and some fresh ground black pepper.  It wasn't hot or spicy but was very good.  but next time I will add just a bit more of the chile sauce.  and save some of the sauce for dipping (for the hubs) it has great flavor and is again very easy to make. Will be making this again. Thank you

Delicious! Substituted the corn syrup for honey, and added a splash of hot sauce, a touch of Cajun seasoning and a bit of paprika to the sauce; broiled for the last five minutes to get a crispy skin... perfect with baked potatoes (which you can make at the same time)!

Fast, simple, delicious.  I used honey in place of the corn syrup. Sinless, boneless thighs - cooked uncovered for 45 minutes at 350. Yummy.

This was very yummy. I used honey instead of corn syrup and cooked on a broiling pan and reserved some sauce to dip the chicken in. I also added cayanne for a kick and fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder. It was very easy and most ingredients you already have in the kitchen.  The sauce that I reserved I split it before adding the minced garlic and added garlic powder. Garlic just isnt good not cooked!

This is a fantastic recipe and SO easy with a great taste! I added a PINCH of cayenne pepper and a little ginger as I was worried it would be too sweet and it was still great. Also a few under the broiler made it extra crispy - a definite winner!

It was ok. I would have rather used a plain old BBQ sauce - but the whole family ate it without complaint!

Good quick recipe.  I soaked the chicken in water and salt first.  I used honey instead of corn syrup and crushed garlic instead of powder.  I didn't baste because I didn't read ahead. I put a little bit of sauce in a casserole dish, salt and pepper on the chicken, and poured the rest of the sauce on top of the chicken.  I put it under the broiler for about 10 minutes to get the skin crispy and then baked it in the oven.

Good recipe.  I used the exact ingredients for the sauce.  I removed the skins, and poured the sauce over the bone-in thighs.  I'm a girl with ADD, I refuse to turn and baste things every 15 minutes.  I put the dish in the oven, uncovered, and baked for 55 minutes, it turned out just right.  The flavor kind of reminded me of the bourbon chicken at the mall food court, and was much easier than the bourbon chicken recipe I use periodically.

This is a good and easy weeknight recipe.  I used skinless thighs, 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 bbq sauce, and substituted honey for the corn syrup.  Also used a big zipper bag to marinate the chicken in the sauce for a little while before baking.  This is also a quick way to get the sauce distributed all over the chicken.  While baking, make sure to drain the fat each time you baste - the sauce sticks to the chicken much better without all that fat.  My family really enjoyed this.  For next time, they requested a buffalo-style version of this recipe.  I'll have to experiment with adding Frank's RedHot sauce...

My husband loves this recipe, and always says, "I smell delicious chicken!" when walking in the door on the days I make this. I probably use about 3/4 of the corn syrup and more garlic powder. I usually make this with skinless chicken, and it works fine.

I'm giving this a 2 because of the  the inconvenience.  This baking/basting business is for the birds.  If you follow the instructions and use skin on, bone in thighs, you lose all the sauce when you take off the skin.  You baste and baste and then you take off the flavor.  The chicken was juicy and had decent flavor (it tasted like chicken), but most of the sauce was lost either when removing the skin or burned to the bottom of the glass pan.  It felt like it took FOREVER because I was just sitting next to the oven waiting to baste again in 15 min.

I used thighs and legs and we thought it had a really good flavor.  I did not have syrup, so I used honey instead and it was great.  A little messy to eat.

This was really good and easy, My kids both said "MMmmmm". I used boneless skinless because it was what I had and used Honey instead of corn syrup. I can not wait to try them on the grill this summer. Normally we are not fan's of thigh meat but because of this recipe I think I will be using it more over the summer. Thanks!

Great recipe! It worked out perfect for the taste buds I have to work with. I like ketchup, DH likes BBQ, and it tasted like both!

Easy and tasty recipe.  I made it exactly as listed except I used light corn syrup and added some grated ginger.  I basted every 15 minutes for a total of 45 minutes at 350.  I took another reviewers suggestion and drained the grease each time I went to baste.  I then ran them under the broiler for approximately 5 minutes.  For a slightly healthier version, I used boneless/skinless thighs.

Really tasty! I had a whole chicken, and did this in the crockpot (an almost 6lb chicken, cooked all day coated in this sauce). I doubled all the ingedients except the corn syrup, and added 2 Tbsp of worschestershire sauce.

I doubled the sauce and used real garlic instead of powdered. I also halved the ketchup, only because my picky toddler doesn't like it. Everyone loved this. Even my picky brother in law said that that is the best way to cook chicken thighs. The sauce coating caramelized on top and it was heavenly. I baked the chicken on a rack in the pan and kept flipping the it every fifteen minutes for an hour. It really came out crispy and all the fat dripped off into the pan. I'll be making this often.

I served this to 5 children for lunch, ranging in ages from 13 months to 3 years old and they all gobbled it up!  I used boneless skinless thighs, turned the chicken over after 15 minutes and turned the heat up to 400 and baked for another 15 minutes to carmelize the sauce a bit better.  I then chopped up the chicken, added some corn and pan juices and served over buttered brown rice.  This has become our new favorite!

4 stars for good base for quick dinner with things that are always in the pantry. Needs to be jazzed up a bit to compensate for sweetness. I added extra garlic, sesame oil, basalmic vinegar, pepper. i also sprinkled toasted sesame seeds in final basting. Still missing something though, to make it 5 star- next time I'm adding a little chinese allspice and definitely some asian hot chili paste for some kick.

I made this recipe using boneless/skinless chicken thighs and it was wonderful.  Very moist and oh so tasty!  Even my 4 year old who normally turns her nose up at all meat dishes loved it.  The whole family agreed that they would like me to make this recipe again.

An easy-to-prepare recipe, that is made with ingredients I had on hand. I made the recipe as indicated, only using fresh garlic (2 cloves) and I added onion powder and pepper as another reviewer suggested. This is a keeper for nights when quick and easy are the criteria.

I added a dash of cayenne, extra garlic, and accidentally doubled the honey (which was used in place of corn syrup) and we loved it.  Baked for an hour on a broiler pan to let the grease drain, then finished under the broiler for a few minutes to crispy it up.

When my 4 year old ask for seconds I know the recipe is good. When my 2 year old asks for seconds, this recipe goes straight into constant rotation. I did follow others suggested mods, as I only use boneless skinless chicken and I never have corn syrup in my house (I substituted honey, per other reviews). Very pleased with this change up to the standard bbq or teriyaki chicken.

Just found this recipe and made it tonight.  I followed another persons suggestion and doubled the sauce and used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 bbq sauce - added a little honey and upped the garlic by alot! (all personal preferences).  I tossed it under the broiler for a few minutes at the end to attempt to crisp the skin a bit (it didn't work - LOL) and used some Adobe, salt, pepper, and onion powder before basting.  It was EXCELLENT - even my very picky son in law loved it and asked me to make it again soon!  Thanks so much!

This is great for an easy, low ingredient meal. It utilizes ingredients I almost always have. That being said the taste is just okay. My kids liked it, and my husband and I thought it was okay, not great but still good.

This was very good. Like some of the other reviewers, I added more garlic and onion powder to the sauce to counteract the sweetness, and a pinch of chipotle powder, too. Very tasty and easy to whip up!

Very good, the kids were arguing over the last piece!  Changes I made:

Used maple syrup rather than corn syrup and I used a Turkish seasoning mix (garlic, oregano, rosemary, cumin, pepper, salt) to the chicken as a dry rub before adding the sauce.

I served the chicken with rice cooked in chicken broth with some soy sauce.

My son loves this chicken.  It is simple to prepare and it results in tender chicken with a sweet flavorful sauce.  I have prepared it with cut up chicken parts with skin and boneless skinless breasts.

This was a nice change to try for dinner tonight.  The chicken was very moist and the sauce was sweet but not overly sweet.  I actually missed some of the tang you get with other BBQ sauce recipes.  If I tried this recipe again, I might add a couple dashes of Franks Red Hot to give the sauce a bit of kick.

Great flavor! I used skinless/boneless thighs and that cut of meat is too fatty for my taste so I'm going to try w/ chicken breasts instead. I added about 1tsp of Siracha sauce and a dash of black pepper to mine to give it some kick.

Next time I will try boneless skinless chicken breasts.  The skin on and the dark meat were just a little too much fat for us.  Otherwise the flavoring was great.

WOW! Even my husband liked this one and couldn't believe it was chicken thighs. The only change I made was to use boneless skinless thighs. Yummy!

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  The sauce was very good and was so easy.  I used boneless, skinless thighs and served with baby spinach salad with grapes, nuts, raisins, parmesan cheese and a lite raspberry dressing.  I will make this again and again and even try the sauce on the grill in the summertime.

We loved this. I had 4 lbs. of chicken thighs, so I upped the other ingredients just a bit. 4 Tbsp. soy, almost 1 c. ketchup and 3/4 c. corn syrup. I used fresh garlic, just a preference. Also, I don't do 'skin', so I removed it. The outside of the chicken created a good crispy  texture. Served with the Fried Cabbage with Bacon, Onion and Garlic recipe from MrsMDSmith, and Mac n' Cheese.

This recipe was a good start. It just needs something else. Like other commenters, I used honey instead of corn syrup and about 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder. Next time I am planning on reducing the ketchup by half and adding a couple of tablespoons of orange juice.

I made this into an OAMC dump recipe. I made exactly as written except I put everything in a freezer bag. On the day of cooking I thawed in the fridge. I cooked mine 45 minutes covered and 15 minutes uncovered. Everyone enjoyed it. Tasty chicken.

Not very flavourful, on its own not very tasty. Will try with the tweaks suggested, but on the merits of its own design 3/5 is pretty fair.

I was worried about this because the sauce wasn't tasty before it was cooked. After adding heat, though, it came together and smelled and tasted good. Easy for week night cooking. I used boneless skinless thighs, and cooked for about half an hour.

My family loves this chicken! I make it with honey instead of corn syrup. I even cooked it for my boyfriend and his brother and they wanted more! My boyfriend even dipped his bread in the sauce to use up every last drop! A favorite in my home :)

This was yummy!  I used about a pound of boneless skinless chicken thighs and only had to bake about 40 minutes, turning them twice.   They were tender enough to cut with a fork!  For the sauce, I used honey instead of corn syrup because that's what I had, and added a tablespoon of Frank's Red Hot Sauce because I didn't have any garlic powder.  The sauce was quite delicious and in my opinion, very much like barbecue sauce (possibly because of the hot sauce which made it a bit spicier and less sweet).  The sauce would be delicious as a dipping sauce for chicken nuggets, too.  Will make this again!

It was OK for me...DH gives it a 5
I added an extra squeeze of Corn Syrup
to thicken up the sauce and to get rid of the ketchup-y flavor. I'd make it again..thanks for sharing =0

Quick and wonderful.  The ingredients are always on hand and it's very tasty.  I just put the thighs in a roaster, poured over all the sauce and let it bake covered for 50 minutes at 350.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a good quick meal. I used boneless, skinless thighs, used honey instead of corn syrup (slightly less to reduce the sweetness) and a pressed clove of garlic instead of a "pinch". It tasted quite similar to the bottled Diana sauce that I would normally use when I need something fast, but much less expensive.

I was looking for a quick and simple recipe to cook some chicken legs, thighs and wings before they spoiled - this was it!! This is the simplest, easiest and an absolutely delicious way to accomplish just that!! The pieces cook up a little soggy from the rendered fat but that was nicely overcome by crisping up under the broiler for five minutes or so. Very simple and quick but very nice flavor. IMO, the flavor and look would make one think considerably more time was spent on the dish. I did score the meat, went skin on and bone in. Approximately one hour in the oven and five to seven minutes under a 475° boiler. Excellent!! Thank you for sharing!

Awesome recipe! I substituted honey after reading other reviews and upped the temp to broil for the last few minutes, this made it an amazing chicken to serve with rice. My family loved it! Will definitely make again.

This was very simple and more importantly my 8 year old loved it.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I tend to like chicken a little spicy or like BBQ but the kids ate multiple pieces of it and asked for more!  I think they would rate it 5.

Changed syrup for honey.  Added toasted sesame oil--don't think I could pick it out.  It is better a finishing oil.  Next time I will add it just before serving.  Added a few pepper flakes.  Next time more.  Also--line the pan with foil for easy clean up.

Excellent! I was out of shake and bake for my chicken drumsticks, and needed another recipe that would allow for my bare cupboards. This had simple, staple ingredients and was very delish! Kids loved it, and the taste was awesome. This ones a definite keeper!

My family LOVES this chicken! I make this chicken meal most of the time. This recipe is great as is and I get that sticky sweet texture and taste that leaves you wanting more as a midnight snack! I do sometimes change it a bit. I like to add grape jelly. It tends to make it a bit sweeter and stickier than normal wick the kids love! I use this sauce on all kinds of meats. Also, I can't stress this enough...bake uncovered! It still comes out moist. If you don't you could wind up with"wet" sauce instead of sticky!

Tested this recipe tonight. Super easy and the flavor was great. After reading other reviews, I added a couple of dashes of red pepper and a dash of garlic pepper. I really don't think it was necessary! The recipe made as written is great! Hubby is not a big chicken fan but he loved this!

Family loved this. Skipped the corn syrup, added more garlic and a little ground ginger, plus spiced up the meat before basting with a sesame ginger spice mix. Easy and yummy!

I thought this was really good. I cooked this on the grill and marinated as I grilled. I thought it was really good and will use again! Next time I will marinate in the sauce for a little while first so hopefully the flavor will be a little stronger. Thanks!!

Super easy, very tasty dish. I agree that replacing the corn syrup with honey is the way to go. If you want a kick, add a couple splashes of hot sauce to the mix, then baste.

This recipe was delicious! I had 3lbs of chicken thighs (7 in total-with skin and bone). I doubled all of the ingredients. My son which doesn't like ketchup ate two pieces of chicken. Ate it with yellow rice and lima beans! Yum!

I found this recipe trying to use what I had on hand - it was very good!  I won't be making it again, though, b/c of the corn syrup ... just don't want to add that to my family menu.

This is a very nice sauce for chicken. I used chicken breasts as well as adding sliced peppers and carrots. I baked it for 30 minutes then finished it under the broiler for about another 5 minutes. Served with rice it makes a very lovely meal. Hubby Approved Recipe!

Very tasty chicken dish. I thought the sauce was really goodwith the  substitution of honey for the corn syrup. Worked just as well. A suggestion to those that didnt like the fat content of the dark meat thighs- Substitute chicken breasts, and cook for about 20 minutes. Basting every 15 minutes is key to this recipe.  Also, before each basting, pour off the fat that accumilates in the pan while cooking. This will help your chcken to not be swimming in fat. I served this with rice and a salad.

This is a great, simple recipe.  I had to make a one tweak, just considering the sugar in this thing!  Instead of the corn syrup, I used 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then added two packs of stevia sweetener.  It turned out awesome-my 5-year old couldn't get enough of it.  And we improved it nutritionally by leaps and bounds!

Definitely a good solid chicken recipe, great alternative to grilling/barbecuing. I modified it by using a cooking rack as someone else mentioned to keep it up out of the fat, but it was still pretty fatty. I may forgo the skin next time. All of my kids liked it, as did I. The sauce was good, but generic. Next time I think I'll modify it some to give it a more unique taste. But overall, a definite repeat recipe.

Very good!!  I didn't have chicken thighs, so I just used drumsticks.  Instead of basting every 15 minutes, I dipped the drumsticks in the sauce then put it in the oven for 45 minutes.  I basted the chicken once, then put it in the broiler for a couple of minutes to darken the tops a little.

I think I'll make this again and try removing the skin first.  I did take another reviewers hint to pierce the skin, but not much flavor got to the meat.  I don't eat the skin, so I found it a little lacking in flavor. Don't get me wrong...the sauce is great, I just need to change the way I cook this.

Made as written, using chicken thighs with legs attached. Wings would be another option for me.  I love the fact that I have these ingredients on hand at all times. Next time I would use minced garlic, instead of the garlic powder, and maybe add hot pepper flakes for a little zip.  Toasted sesame seeds would also work quite well.  A nice change from BBQ sauce.  Thanks for the recipe, Charlene!

Good and easy to make - I substituted honey for corn syrup and was generous with the garlic powder.  Even with only 1.5 lbs of boneless, skinless thigh, I baked it for 1 hour and liked that the resulting texture was like tandoori chicken.  Glaze tastes very similar to char-siu (Chinese bbq pork) sauce.  The amount of sauce recommended was just right.  A little more sauce can be made for dipping, as chicken is dry in the middle.

Easy to make and pretty tasty.  As one other reviewer did, I also used boneless skinless thighs and cooked it for about a half hour.  Worked just great.

Not bad. I added some brown sugar to sweeten up a bit.  I also added sesame seeds after it was baked.  I baked it covered for the first 45 min, and then uncovered the last 15 min.  I also baked mine on 375, instead of 350.  I will make again.  Very easy and tasty.

This was an easy crowd-pleasing recipe.  I removed the skin from the chicken thighs and cooked it on a broiler pan (less fatty that way).  I also cooked it at a higher temp - 425° for a shorter time - about 40 min.  Turned the chicken half way and basted the other side.  Pretty easy and everyone liked it!

This sauce is a great base to tinker with. Just as is is pretty good, but to make it EXTRA good I add: Worcestershire sauce (1 tbs) fresh garlic (2 cloves) lemon juice (1 tsp) and red chili flakes (1/4 tsp) Happy broiling!

This recipe was good, however I modified it by seasoning the chicken first with garlic salt and pepper.  I would make this recipe again for my family.

I used boneless thighs.  The fat cooked off and the meat was quite tasty.  For the sauce I used a clove of fresh garlic vs garlic pwdr. and additional soy sauce.  Good recipe for ingredients one usually has on hand.

I though this recipe was ok.  It was definitely really quick and easy to make, so that was a plus.  But as for taste, it was not anything that jumped out at me or my boyfriend.  I probably won't be making this any time soon, but I will have this on hand just in case I don't have anything else to make.

This recipe was ok. I used bone in chicken breasts instead of thighs. I found the ketchup was a little over bearing. I don't think I will make this again. If I do I will use less ketchup, maybe more garlic powder.

We liked this ok, but the sauce won't replace our favorite bottled bbq.  Chicken was tender - I used boneless thighs and cooked them for 40  min.  Good quick meal and kid friendly.

This was just *average*. Nothing that jumped out as us. The flavor was a little *off* to me. I do admit that the chicken turned out moist. I don't think I'll make this again, though.

Very easy, but I have to say that the reviews are more hyped up then the recipe deserves.  Was mediocre at best.  Probably won't make again since the toughest critics (the kids) didn't like it.

Beautiful color! Everyone ate this but I didn't get any specific comments from the children. I do think it is kid friendly, however. My husband loved this and it used up my leftover chicken thighs that I didn't know what to do with.

I used a dozen boneless skinless thighs for this recipe and had lots of sauce for basting.  I used honey instead of corn syrup.  My daughter usually refuses to eat anything with a tomato flavor but she loved this.  A quick recipe with readily available ingredients.  I'll make this again.

I tweaked it a little I seasoned the chicken with Lawrys seasoning salt, black pepper and garlic powder and I added black pepper in the mix that was used to bake the chicken. I also had the oven at 450 degrees , covered it with foil let it cook for 1 hr, took foil off flipped the pieces and based them covered and let cook for another 30 mins and then took the foil off basted again and let each side get crispy total cooking time 2hrs.

I followed the recipe and used chicken thighs.  I liked that the sauce was not overwhelmingly soy sauce, but rather a nice sweet, sour, salty blend.  I really liked that the sauce was thick and sticky instead of just running off the meat. and did not need twenty or thirty ingredients.  Will make again.

This sauce is very simple and very good. I got a good deal on 8lbs of chicken wing. The recipe as written made enough sauce for all and I had a little extra left. Thank you for a good basic recipe, proportionally correct!

The next time I make this I will add a good tablespoon of concentrated tomato paste and I will salt and pepper the near before adding the sauce.

I followed the recipe with minor changes. I cut off excess fat from the thighs and cut two 2-inch slits in the skin of each. I substituted clover honey for the corn syrup and added 1/4 tsp seasoned salt to the honey-ketchup mixture. Every 15 minutes I poured off the fat before basting the chicken. I may put it under the broiler for a few minutes at the end next time to make it crisper. Great easy recipe!

Easy to make, my son liked it (7). Too bland for me though. I prefer some kick to bbq chicken.

Have made this many, many times and it's one of the most delicious dishes I've ever found on this site.  Simple is best and I mostly make it as is or occassionslly add some hot sauce to make it spicier.   Try it, everyone loves it!

I think this was a good starting out recipe but next time I think I will add some seasoning to the chicken, even crushed garlic would be a nice touch. I definitely suggest lining your pan with aluminum foil to keep clean up a breeze.

This turned out really well.  I used 2 lbs of boneless, skinless thighs and followed everything else exactly as stated.  Throughout dinner, my husband mentioned several times that the chicken was very good.  Would definitely do again.

Our family LOVED this!  I used Honey instead of the corn syrup and it was fantastic!  The thighs stayed moist and the skin carmalized with the sauce. My kids don't like bbq sauce so I told them it was honey (they love honey) when they finished and asked for seconds I told them what was in it.  They asked me to make this again!

Easy-peasey.  I usually have these ingredients on hand and it is different enough from BBQ chicken to feel like a new meal.  Chicken thighs are a great cut of meat - flavorful and cheap!  I would highly recommend scoring and seasoning the chicken with salt & pepper prior to adding the sauce.

I kept with the recipe but used skinless, boneless chicken thighs.  This is probably only the third time I've cooked chicken thighs but this recipe is definitely a keeper.  I had doubts when I read the ingredients for the glaze but it struck a balance and was not too sweet.  Thanks Charlene for a great recipe!!

Awsome recipe!!! After reading many of the reviews, I, not only, added extra garlic powder; I added minced garlic,paprika,cayanne,and cajun spices. I only had 3 boneless/skinless chicken thighs and 3 chicken tenders. I still used the same amount of ingredients for the 3 pounds of chicken thigh recipe. A definate keeper!

I really did like it.  I had to use chicken strips more by accident.  My husband thawed the wrong chicken from the freezer.  Any way I did 10 min on each side and the broiled on high 10 min.  It was really good.  My 17 month old a bit and like it.  (She had already had dinner.

The chicken turned out VERY moist, so that was a plus.  However, the sauce stayed really saucy and never browned or got crispy in the least.  Also, I followed the recipe exactly, and the ketchup flavor was too strong, and there wasn't enough oriental flavor.  I would make it again, just because of how moist the chicken was, but I would definitely change the sauce up a bit.

I customized this recipe a bit. i used bonless and skinnless chicken, minced garlic instead of garic powder, and i didnt have corn syrup so i used honey, it made the chicken a little sweet and that actually made it taste very nice. Also i broiled it which gave it a nice grilled taste.. i would give this recipe 3 stars on taste because even though it was good, it wasnt something i would CRAVE, but something i would just occassionally eat.. On the other hand, my husband said he would rate this chicken with 5 stars and told me i better make it again, and with this being so simple to make- i most definitley will make it again.

I wouldn't use this again, however my husband really liked it.  I grilled chicken strips with this sauce.  I liked the sweet flavor with a hint of the soy sauce, but the ketchup flavor was too strong.  Next time I will not use as much ketchup.  I'll try again on this weekends camping trip, going to skewer them on a hotdog stick, dip in the sauce and cook over an open flame.  We'll see how that goes.

What a great recipe!  So quick and easy but so tasteful!  I didn't have any corn syrup, so I took the suggestion of other reviewers and substituted the corn syrup for honey, and I think I'll keep it that way.  I also used boneless skinless chicken thighs, and to be honest, even with the grease that ended up coming out with that, I couldn't imagine doing with skin-on chicken.  BIG hit with the family.  This is definitely a recipe that will be asked for again and again!  Thanks!  :o)

I used flour instead of cornstarch because I was out and served with noodles instead of rice. The sauce was really tasty but only flavoured the chicken skin, not the rest of the meat. I think I'll try it with a different kind of chicken next time.

This was so yummy! Made it for my husband and I last night and it was perfect. Instead of corn syrup we used honey as other suggested. I also put a little fresh ground pepper on the chicken thighs before pouring the sauce over. This is one to save for the future. Thank you!

Great base recipe for some sticky bbq chicken! I trimmed the fat from my chicken thighs and baked it for about 45 minutes. I added a few things because I was looking for a spicy teriyaki style sauce... red pepper flakes, minced garlic instead of powder, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, lime juice, and some chipotle hot sauce. I also replaced half of the corn syrup with honey. I hate reviewing recipes if I made so many changes to them, but I wanted to give credit where it is due!

Easy to make and not bad to eat, but I think I would put them on a rack next time, and maybe add a little hot sauce to the glaze.

Made with 3 chicken thighs in an 8X8 corningware pan. Substituted honey for corn syrup. For the first hour I cover it with foil, the next 1/2 hour I took the foil off. Checked it a few times to baste. Easy meal, taste is fine but not enough to ask others for the recipe.

Alright recipe. Easy when you don't have a lot on hand. The sauce goes well with pork also. I used it on chicken and pork, as I didn't have quite enough of either.  Tastes kind of like a take and bake mix, or a simple hot wing sauce.  Good though, nice flavor. I'll add more garlic and some hoisin sauce next time.

Considering my family isn't fond of dark meat, and they gobbled this up, I'd say this was really good. Only problem was that I didn't remove the skin before cooking and since these thighs were really fatty, we pulled off the skin before we ate it, so we lost a bit of flavor. We wound up using the sauce left in the pan as a dipping sauce. I followed the recipe exactly, except I made a double portion of the sauce. Although next time I may try honey as other reviewers have done. I also will probably use boneless breasts too. Leftovers made really good chicken salad. Thanks!

This was just Ok, I suppose if you add some fresh minced garlic, onion powder and sesame seeds you might come up with a more flavorful sauce. Maybe a touch of sesame oil. It was missing something. Don't forget to skin the chicken first or pan sear it first.

A very good, simple recipe.  I had all the ingredients in my pantry, which made it a perfect solution to dinner when I failed to plan ahead!  Next time I will use chicken breast instead of chicken thighs, we don't eat the skin, so a lot of the flavor was lost in removing the skin.

My family loved it.  I was unable to follow the recipe exactly, I was out of corn syrup and soy sauce.  So I used 1/8 c. of pecan maple syrup and 1/8 cup honey for the corn syrup and worstashire sauce w/a splash of water for the soy sauce.  I also broiled it on low and basted it every 10-15 min.  Suprisingly it was fantastic!  Thanks for the inspiration.

I did use chicken breasts as I'm not a big fan of chicken thighs. I don't know if it was just us, but there wasn't enough sauce to make it really flavorful. The only good part was the outside if the chicken. Needed something more.

I was looking for something new and different to do with chicken.  Boy, did I luck up with this recipe.  It is outstanding.  I used garlic powder and quite a bit of it, since we all like garlic.  My husband, who is somewhat picky, loved it.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

the sauce was delicious- i added a dash of worcestershire sauce and doubled the recipe because we love sauce in this house!  my husband is not a dark-meat fan so next time we'll try this recipe on white meat or pork, but we all loved the sauce.

This was a great recipe. I opted to remove the skin from the thighs and I'm very glad I did. I made two batches of the sauce mix, both with minced garlic instead of powder. One batch to coat the raw chicken and the other for basting. I removed 75% of the liquid for the last 15 minutes of cooking. This is a keeper.

This is quickly becoming a favorite in our house. I've made it several times and the kids love it. It's not overly sweet or tangy - right in the middle. Great for a speedy dinner.

I wasn't sure if my family would like it because of the sauce but we loved it.  I did flip the chicken at the end.  It was a very good recipe, I will make it for my family again!!

very very good.  My 19 month old son loved it.  The chicken was very flavorful and tender.  I think next time I will cook it on a rack, instead of directly in the pan.   Thank goodness for this website and everyone who participates.  Without allrecipes our meals would be blah.

Recipe was easy but very much so lacking in flavor. Not one I'd fix again.

Very easy and my kids loved it. I happened to have a fresh pineapple so I cut that up and added it to the dish before baking and it was a hit.

The sauce is great!  Next time I make this I will use skinless chicken or even pork chops.  I will also double the sauce.

I made this for a dorm full of girls.  It went over really well.  I thought the chicken was a bit dry, but I also cooked it over night in a crockpot rather than frying which may have made the difference.  I'll be making it for them again in the future.

Doubled sauce. Added small amount (about 1/8 tsp.) garlic salt & 1 tbsp. of brown sugar half way through baking. Served with Jasmine rice, steamed broccoli, & steamed buttered asparagus. Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this with both boneless skinless thighs and boneless skinless breasts and I have to agree with other reviewers that the thighs are the best meat for this recipe.  Like others, I also used more soy sauce and garlic powder as the ketchup flavor is slightly overwhelming.  Other than that it was delicious!

I made this dish last night for dinner.  I thought it was very good!  My husband liked it but said it was a bit too sweet for him so I'll have to tweak the recipe a bit next time I make this.  I used boneless, skinless thighs and they were done within 50 minutes.  Mahalo for the recipe!

Simple and easy to make. The whole family enjoyed it. We added some of frank's hot sauce (we like things a little spicy) and it added a nice, extra zip. I definitely will make again.

I liked this recipe a lot! The chicken was moist, and the sauce was yummy. I used honey instead of corn syrup because I didn't have any. I also cut down on the amount of ketchup because I don't like things to taste to much like ketchup. But it turned out nicely.
