I made this for my husband for Father's Day, and used a chocolate frosting recipe I found on this site that used cream cheese and baker's chocolate and put candied mint-leaves on top. I think it's really really good! The cake is very rich and moist! I've got the leftover cake in the refrigerator and if you put a slice in the microwave for 20 seconds, and top with ice cream, it's delicious. The frosting microwaves well because of the cream cheese.

This was a great recipe. I didn't have bakers chocolate, SO instead I used hersheys natural cocoa powder mixed with the amount of water recipe indicates and a tablespoon extra of butter. This cake is not super chocolaty as I thought, it is sutble. perfect with some white whipped frosting and sliced strawberrys. It was a major hit , I am definatly making this cake again. btw i chose to use all natural and organic ingredients. although that doesnt change the calorie intake it is gratifying knowing I am not eating hydrogenated dye filled food. Kudos to this recipe..

Used a 13x9 pan, and baked for 50 min total. Delicious, and everyone enjoyed it :). Because some said it was dry, and I'm in deserty Colorado, added 2 egg yolks and 1/2 cup yogurt and 1 cup chocolate chips. Made icing with butter, cocoa, p. sugar and Bailey's Irish Cream.

I made this into cupcakes, and they turned out really well. For me, at least, the batter turned out really thick, almost like chocolate mousse (and was really yummy!) I baked the cupcakes at 350 for about 15 minutes. They were not overly sweet, which worked well with the super-sweet frosting we put on top. We'll make them again.

Wow, what a great chocolate cake!  I used 2 squares semi-sweet and 1 square unsweetened chocolate based on the reviews.  This fluffy chocolate cake was STILL moist after 8 days in the fridge.  Definitely a keeper recipe, thanks!

This is a really yummy cake for all the family...not very chocolatey actually, but it was moist and delicious. The day after making it, we sliced it down the middle, put some pieces of high quality chocolate in the centre, put it in the microwave for 30 seconds until the chocolate pieces melted and then we ate it like a sandwich. The taste was incredibly decadent and delicious.

This cake was awesome I made it for my Grandma's 71st birthday and it was a big hit. But it was just a tad dry no one noticed but I did. I put some chocolate frosting on it and it was perfect.

I used all brown sugar, and added 1/4 c cocoa (i like dark choc) with a 1/4 tsp cinnamon and these were awesome!  I frosted them with my grandma's cooked choc icing recipe and they were yummy!  My mini cupcakes only needed about 14 min.

This was the first cake I've ever made and it turned out great!  i used semi-sweet chocolate since one review said it wasn't chocolately enough.  it could have been a bit more moist (maybe add some oil next time?) according to my husband, but everyone else thought it was perfect.

Something went terribly wrong. We were so excited to make this recipe, but it came out not to my liking It looked beautiful while in the oven, but sank as soon as we pulled it out. It also looked and felt really moist, but was extremely dry and crumbly. I have NO idea what went wrong. We did use cocoa and oil as a substitution for the unsweetened baking squares, but I don't think that would've ruined the recipe this much. Also, there were CHUNKS! It was like we had put peanuts in the batter or something. We were very disappointed :(

The cake was ok but too dry. The flavor was fine but the texture ruined it for me. I served this at my son's birthday party and I was not pleased. I doubled the recipe but I doubt that would have affected the outcome... ps - I put chocolate chips between the layers and that was a nice touch.

This cake was too dry.  I followed the recipe exactly.
