This sticky buns were so easy!  I forgot to make them the night before so I let them raise in the oven for 1 hour on warm and they turned out just fine.  I took them to my family reunion and everyone loved them.

I'm in the minority here, but these were just awful! I followed the recipe to a "T" and had nothing but hard, grainy, unedible rolls. the topping stayed in the bottom of the pan, the sugar scorched, and the flavor just wasn't worth the effort. The idea to use frozen bread dough is fabulous, so I'll give two stars for that, but this recipe just isn't "it" for me. Sorry! I'll try it again next weekend and (hopefully) upgrade my review!!

This recipe is great. I used walnuts and pecans and  cooked sliced apples in the recipe. I also double the recipe sticky part and added to the top of the rolls. Yummy! Yummy!

I'm not rating this because I didn't make the "sticky part" I did use the bread dough and the filling. Then I whipped up a frosting using 4 oz cream cheese, 2 T butter, 1 t vanilla and added powdered sugar til it was spreadable. I spread it over the top and they turned out great. Oh and my mom was a little dissapointed at the idea of the "frozen dough" as opposed to home made but she said that tasted great:)

Took this to work yesterday.  The pan was given back to me wiped clean with 3 requests for the recipe.  Easy to make with wonderful results.

These are ooey-gooey wonderful. I used more brown sugar and cinnamon than called for and added a pinch of nutmeg which is personal preference. I also sprinkled chopped pecans with the sugar/cinnamon before rolling. I'm afraid I'm eating my supper a little late tonight because I just couldn't resist having not 1 but 2 as soon as they were cool enough to handle. Remember, hot sugar gives a nasty burn.
