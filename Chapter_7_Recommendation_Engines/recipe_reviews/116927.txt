Great dish! Not your average manicotti. I was a little weary of the salsa but it turned out amazingly well.

I follow the recipe with just a few slight changes.  I used V8 vegetable juice instead of tomato juice, used dried chopped onions instead of powder, and used crushed croutons for breadcrumbs.  I also doubled the sauce (don't double the V8 juice).  

TIP- To fill manicotti easily, fill up a freezer bag with filling and cut a small hole in the corner and squeeze in shells.  Much easier than trying the other way.

I froze half the recipe I hope it freezes well. I'll comment later.

This is totally awesome!  I made this for dinner tonight.  I didn't make any changes.  I did have leftover ricotta mixture, so I just spread it over the top before baking.  I filled the manicotti shells with a pastry press. It was a two person job, but was easy that way.  My family isn't really into meatless meals, but we didn't even notice there wasn't any!  Definitely a make again thing!!! Yummy!

This is my families favorite dish I make.  I bring it over on the Holidays.  However, I do make a few changes, I omit the salsa and Juice and just use my homemade spaghetti sauce w/ diced tomatoes.  I also add Cream Cheese and Artichokes to the mixture.

This was wonderful! Basically followed recipe as printed with the exception of fresh spinach (that it what I had on hand), cottage cheese instead of ricotta (more flavor and cheaper), no sour cream (my husband dislikes it so much it ruins the taste for him), and added parmesan to the cheese mixture. Otherwise, followed directions precisely and was fantastic. Loved the salsa & wouldn't change that for anything. Such a good veggie recipe my family didn't realize there was no meat until I told them. Thank you!

Wonderful recipe, easy to make... had it for dinner last night. I was wary of the salsa at first but it gave the recipe a wonderful flavor. Will likely be having it again soon.

Good, easy recipe! Instead of salsa, I used a jar pasta sauce I had in the pantry, and it did the trick. Next time I'll try using a pastry bag to fill the manicotti to cut down on prep time. Also, be warned that you will have PLENTY of extra ricotta/spinach mixture. Probably enough to fill another 7-10 shells or another 1/2 box of manicotti. I'm planning on adding some sundried tomatoes to my leftover mix and using it to stuff chicken breasts. YUM!

Although I modified the recipe, I am glad I did. I kept to the recipe as far as the filling mixture goes. That's the part that was lacking, big time. It did not have much flavor. I had some Italian sausage and some homemade sauce in the freezer that I used instead of the salsa... and that gave it the flavor it needed. I would recommend adding a lot more or different seasoning to the filling...unless you prefer bland. I will search out another recipe.

This recipe was very easy to make and not having to work the cooked manicotti made it so much easier to stuff.  The filling was a bit dry and I really think it would have been better with a marinara instead of salsa.  I will try it again that way and see if I like it better.

Pretty good, although I have to admit I made a few changes- some due to necessity, some due to taste preferences. I didn't have Italian Seasoning, so I omitted that, and I had to use garlic salt instead of garlic powder. Also, I wasn't feeling adventurous enough to try the salsa-based sauce, and I had some marinara sauce in the fridge (Jackie's Best Marinara Sauce Yet, featured on this site) so I used that instead. Turned out pretty good! I'd make it again.

Have made this many times!  Love it!  Great flavor and easy since the noodles don't need to be cooked ahead of time.  My 10 year old daughter has made it for me, too!  The sauce really makes this recipe.

This recipe was a hit!  Very easy, first time ever making manicotti!  Used my own homemade spaghetti sauce, no salsa.  I put a little parm cheese and cottage cheese (low-fat) in my filling! Will make this again!

Pretty good, although I felt the pasta was slightly overdone. The prep time is way too short, I would say. It took me much longer to do the mixing and the stuffing than 15 minutes, and I am a pretty fast cook. Thanks for the recipe!

I love salsa but I really couldn't get past the taste of it in this dish. It was really good but strange. The cheese mixture was delicious and stuffing the uncooked shells was a breeze. I think next time I will omit the salsa or try a different kind. I would be interested to hear what brand and type of salsa people use in this dish.

LOVED THIS! Its easy and good! I put it in the over for 55 minutes at 350 and DIDN'T need to put it in for the last 15. It was perfect!  NOTE: make one bowl of the spinach stuffings and one bowl of the tomato ingredients.

I think this is better without the salsa, next time I will just make some spaghetti sauce, but a very nice and quick recipe thank you for sharing.

This was a very good recipe, but I did make one change. Instead of the salsa I used alfredo sauce and it was absolutely delicious! My fiance wasn't too fond of it having no meat, so next time I think I will try adding some italian sausage or something. Thank you very much Mary!

Delicious - in the middle of a bite, my husband said "this will be a perfect dish when we have company over."  I followed the recipe exactly and the salsa was perfect.  I followed another reviewers suggestion and just poured the remainder of the filling over the manicotti before adding the sauce to the top - it was perfect and not runny at all!  Thanks!

My family took a vote and agreed on four stars. They liked it, ate it, and will want me to make it again. Personally, I loved it and would have given it five stars with a few adjustments. I also added feta cheese, cooked the manicotti prior to stuffing and added home made spaghetti sauce (from this site). All in all a very good recipe that we enjoyed and will enjoy again. Thanks for sharing.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  I wasn't too sure about the salsa, but it added a nice flavor to the dish.  It was easy to make because you don't have to cook the manicotti.  It also goes well with grilled Italian sausage on the side.

Made this one night for some friends and everyone seemed to enjoy it. Didnt have to make changes to the recipe. The only down side is it is hard to stuff the manicottis. Dont be afraid of the salsa, only makes it better.

This was very good.  I added artichokes to it.  I filled the shells from a corner cut off of a ziplock back like another reviewer suggested.  It works much better if the mixture is room temperature.  It is harder to fill the shells when the mixture is cold.

I really enjoyed this dish. I especially like what the salsa did for it. It added just a bit of a twist. Great meatless dish.

I followed the recipe exactly and this was excellent!  At first, I was a little skeptical about adding salsa, but it gave the dish a nice little kick.  I will definitely make this again!
