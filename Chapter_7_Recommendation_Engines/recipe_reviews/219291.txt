easy to prepare and looks pretty - until I dumped it out after 20 min....it was not completely cooked.  My fault for not sticking a toothpick in it.  Now it's ugly but hopefully will taste ok

My son made this recipe.  We sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on it.  It would be more delicious with cinnamon, sugar and pecans sprinkled across the cake before going into the oven.

I prepared this recipe and unfortunately after 20 min. it was not done so when I went to flip it over, it fell apart. It still tasted good but I was unable to bring it to my ladies night.

I followed the recipe exactly but found I had to bake it longer than 20 minutes to have it cooked through.  My husband and I LOVED this simple cake and we couldn't stop eating it!  We finished it off for breakfast with coffee.  Perfect!  Next time I will try to cut down on the amount of butter to see if it turns out well with less fat.

Great recipe. Easy and always works. I love it with apples and plums and cinnamon!
