My family really liked this dish though we all thought it was a little bland.  Made it a second time and sauteed the chicken with fresh garlic in Italian dressing - also added some red pepper flakes and capers.  We topped it all with fresh grated Parmesan cheese.  These little adaptations gave it that extra edge that we thought it needed (though next time I will use more capers!)

I sauted the chicken with some garlic, green onion, and fresh mushrooms mostly because I had them on hand and was looking for a way to use them. I also threw in 1/4 of white wine that I needed to use up, and it was fabulous and not nearly as bland as others had said.

I thought this recipe was great! The only change I made was adding additional lemon juice, and will substitute shrimp next time instead! Very delicious and quick.

Considering how easy this was to make, I am giving this recipe 5 stars. It was tasty! Both my husband and sister-in-law enjoyed it a lot. I baked my chicken breasts with garlic salt and pepper, and I also used whole wheat angel hair pasta. I served it with broiled tomatoes and garlic bread. Next time I think I will add some sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms, and perhaps a little bit more lemon and a splash of white wine to give it a little more flavor, but the flavor was good and light as is. Will definetely make again!

This recipe was great. I added some chickpeas, italian dressing, olive oil, parmesan cheese, and tripled the lemon juice.  My older daughter thinks this recipe is the best recipe ever.

This was very simple comfort-type food that was quick to make.  The family seemed to love it.  The only thing I changed is that I cooked a box of angel hair pasta instead of using the recommended pasta (cheaper) and I marinated cut-up chicken breasts in mojo sauce and stir fried them in a skillet.

This was really tasty, especially for one of those 'quick, throw something together!' nights. I did use tofu instead of chkn (I boiled firm, drained, tofu in veggie broth) then added the tofu, a splash of the broth, and about 1 c steamed broccoli to the mix at the end. It turned out very well and both the 9 yr old & 1 1/2 yr old liked it, which works for me!

I made this with only one change. I substituted some steamed broccoli in place of the chicken, as I made breaded pork chops for the meat.

Easy enough, but a little bland. I think next time I make this, I might play around with the spices and see if I can't bump up the flavor.

very good base, but i would reccomend using 1-2 cloves fresh garlic (instead of powder, and in addition to the lemon juice, the zest of one lemon. basil is a nice sub for marjoram too :) happy eating :)

This is a good base recipe, but I also added fresh garlic, fresh mushrooms, onions, lemon zest, and about a half a cup of white wine to the cut up chicken that we had leftover from grilling.  All that brought it up to delicious.  My husband loved it!  We had this tonight along with fresh asparagus and fresh strawberries and cream for dessert.  It was a quick meal to prepare and very good.

This isn't a very good recipe.  I think it has inflated ratings because it's a good idea but it needs a lot of tinkering, and most of the reviewers made changes.  I followed the recipe pretty closely except that I used a different kind of pasta and increased the seasonings and it was way too bland.  My husband and I ate it, but we both made changes.  I personally dumped way more lemon juice on mine and that made it decent.  I think this recipe could be developed into something good, but it's mediocre as written.

This was good but I recommend following other reviewers suggestions to saute the chicken with garlic, pepper, and other italian spices you like. I added fresh basil and used 3 Tb. lemon and 3 Tb. butter for the sauce. Topped with parm cheese. It was fine with regular spaghetti noodles.

This was delicious. To make it a little healthier I used whole grain pasta and margarine. I also used fresh garlic instead of powder.

Very good and easy to make. I add capers and parmesan. Shrimp is a great substitute for chicken, too.

I have made this dish a few times.  I think it is a good choice for quick weeknight dinner, that tastes delicious.  I always double the amount of sauce, pre cook my chicken in the morning, substitute basil for marjoram, and add sliced fresh mushrooms.  Toss this with 1 lb of cooked angel hair pasta.

This is a great recipe!!! It is so simple and fast! I have a 5 yr old and a 15 mnth old and this recipe saved me. It was late and a school night and I had this cooked and ready to eat in 15 min! It always takes me longer to prepare than it says the 1st time I try a recipe. I Used the juice from 1 1/2 lemons,cooked the chicken with a little oil and fresh garlic I also used a little salt and fresh ground pepper makes the world of difference! I tried to use a little less butter but it was a no go you really need it all. I would still add the garlic powder. I also took the advice and added about 2 tblsp of capers it was wonderful! Added a green salad for a side and topped the pasta with packaged italian cheese blend. Definately making this again. It was so good my 5 yr old ate the leftovers for lunch the next day!

This was a very good recipe...once you spruce it up.  Like the others mentioned, it's bland.  However I added parmesean cheese, red pepper flakes, more lemon juice, salt, and pepper.  After that, yummy!  I also used left over grilled chicken breast instead.

This is a good recipe. I am giving this 5 stars even though I did switch the chicken for shrimp and used 3 cloves of garlic minced as another reviewer suggested. I will make this again with chicken or shrimp.

My wife loved this recipe and my 2 year old actually ate it...that says a lot!!  I added 2 cloves of garlic when sauteing the chicken and a little bit of italian dressing.  I also added a little bit more of the lemon juice.  Big hit!!

My whole family enjoyed the recipe, included my picky youngest. I added chives and some olive oil. I think next time I am going to use lemon zest also and maybe fresh garlic for added flavor. My whole family agreed that the recipe was a keeper with a little jazzing up.

This was good,but it could be better,like the other reviewer,Angel said,if you change the spices,it would add a different and maybe a little better taste. I can also see this done with shrimp.

A few liked it, few didn't. I'm giving it a '4' for a good starting point. I like the lemon, marjoram was too strong for DH. With the left overs I'm going to add some chopped cucumbers, tomatoes, cheddar cheese and maybe add some Zesty Italian dressing.

My kids and I love this!  I also add a little more garlic and lemon juice.  Super quick and easy.  Cheap too.

Very easy and very yummy! I'm a college student who just started cooking for herself, and this was a great way to start. I might add more lemon next time.

I made this last night and my family thought it was good, although needed a little more spice. I loved how easy and quick it was to make, too! The little ones gobbled up the pasta. (I didn't use the one in this recipe...didn't have it on hand. Instead, I used some bow tie pasta.) This recipe is a keeper, though, and I will make it again! Thanks!

Fast and easy recipe. Made some changes as others recommended. I used a box of angel hair pasta instead of the refrigerated kind, seasoned the chicken as I cooked it, and doubled the sauce because I made the entire box of pasta. The best addition was tossing Parmesan cheese with the pasta and served with garlic bread.

I thought this was good. I sautéed my chicken and added some broccoli for veggie and color. I loved the twang of the lemon. Next time I'll add some cherry tomatoes.

I never made this recipe until tonight. I read some of the reviews and decided to add a few tablespoons of Italian dressing to the meat as it cooked. I also added 3 tablespoons of lemon juice instead of 2. It came out so flavorful and tasty! I'll be making this again. :)

My picky 5 y/o old this dish! I thought it could use a little more flavor. Next time I might try to saute garlic in the butter first and add a little more lemon juice.

The chicken obsorbed all the flavor and the noodles tasted blah.  I recommend mixing a green veggie (I did green beans).

This recipe is a great start but I added a few more spices to give it a little more flavor and changed the parsley to cilantro.

As rated by my daughter's 7, 5 and 2 - it was sweet and tasty.  Used a box of angel hair pasta, canned chicken and dried parsley.  Turned out great!  Next time will add a bit more lemon juice and maybe a bit more of the parsley.  It was fast and easy.  The longest time was in cooking the pasta.
