I am an Allstar and this was a task from the program to create a recipe. To the person thinking it needed cheese I believe you likely have never had an actual bouillabaisse. Traditional bouillabaisse doesn't have cheese in it. Please don't rate down a recipe based on changes you made. That's a reflection of your cooking not the recipe.

Great recipe! Thank you. I topped the soup with a little more salt and some ground peppercorn which added a nice spice to it. The amount called for in the recipe is a good start though so that it is not overly salty.

Winner!!!! Wow! Such an amazing soup! We enjoyed every flavor of this soup. I cannot say enough about the delicious welcoming flavor of this soup. I love herbs so I was really intrigued when I saw the variety and how well they would blend with each other. I used cod for the fish and made it exactly as indicated. I must say it was very easy and a quick meal to cook if you prep everything beforehand. This will be a favorite for my family for a long time! Thank you so much for sharing this gem!

I'll make it again as it was good. I used a spicy tomato sauce base and added celery and cooked potatoes. It was a bit of a Roman Remains dish to be honest but tasted really good. 
The blend of herbs and spice gave it an unique flavour. 
As the chef says 'don't try to make it without saffron'. The saffron is well worth it!

This is fantastic! I made it as is, with the exception of the broth. I couldn't find seafood broth at my store so I subbed vegetable broth. Yummy!

Delicious! The final product as written lacked fullness in my taste, so I added some sharp cheese and it was perfect!

I made this exactly as the recipe called for.  The flavour is so rich and the saffron makes it so special.  My husband loved it and he is an old-fashioned meat and potato guy.  He wished we had guests to share it with.

This is very good, and reasonable calories. Could not find seafood stock, but it's very easy to make from the shrimp shells ahead of time.

When I saw the finished product, I thought it looked "meh", but it tasted great!!!  I made as written except, in lieu of the cod, I used one filet of sea bass and one filet of salmon because that was what I had on hand.  Everyone in my family hates fish (especially salmon), but even the kids liked this!   Next time I will use even more salmon (gotta get those fatty acids!) and something green to give it more visual appeal.

Used shrimp & crabmeat instead of fish...  Clam juice 2/3 & chicken stock 1/3 and used creativity of the spices, but fresh basil whirred with canned diced tomatoes made it VERY delicious & I added a 1/2 chopped red bell pepper to the onion.  Wonderful hot fish stew, in essence.
