I will NEVER purchase beef lo mien from any restaurant ever again. This recipe is delicious.  I was worried about using flank steak but it is perfect for this recipe. I doubled the sauce, and cooked the veges in half of it as another reviewer suggested.  I BBQ 'd the steak before slicing it up and tossed it in at the end.  I used gluten free spaghetti for a more authentic rice noodle taste without breaking the bank.  As far as vegetables go, snopeas, shredded carrots, sliced onion and button mushroom were used.  This recipe is a home run in my book.  I will be making it often.

I did not want to overcook the veggies, so I removed them from the skillet before I browned the beef.  This has nice flavor, but the one criticism that I have is that it was a tad on the dry side.  The spaghetti really soaked up the sauce, so the next time I would increase that by at least half and, perhaps, even double it.   I used sliced bell peppers, sliced baby bok choy, julienned carrots, vertically-sliced red onion, and snow pea pods for the vegetable blend, and it worked out well.  This is a lot of pasta for 4 servings, and depending on what else you serve with it, it may be 6 servings.  We enjoyed and will make again.

I tried this using the oils and spices in the recipe but used hot sesame oil which gives more schecuan kick. Essential veggies to use are bok choy, black mushrooms, and water chestnuts...and diced scallions added just a minute or two before finishing the dish. I also always use fresh lo mein noodles from an Asian grocery - spaghetti has the wrong texture for this dish.

Super recipe! A little too much oyster sauce for me, but overall, it was fantastic! Also, I used shirataki noodles to save calories.

This was wonderful. I did double the sauce as recommended by others, and I didn't have any peanut oil so I used olive oil to saute the veggies. I also used left over flank steak from the night before and put it in with the noodles right at the end. Turned out great, the only complaint was that maybe I could make it a little less spicy, but that is each to their own...Thanks for sharing!

This is a simply amazing recipe to make! I absolutely loved it and so did the rest of my family. Something I think really improves the dish is to marinate and cook your meat ahead of time that way when you actually cook you can just throw everything in the pan nice and quick. Overall I would totally recommend this recipe to anyone especially if you like pasta and stirfry. ??

This was really good.  I didn't do the noodles.  I made it for the kids & my son prefers rice, so I made it as a stir fry and served it over rice.  I used a bag of stir fry veggies from the store.  It was probably closer to 2 cups than 4.  I also used chicken tenders rather than steak.  So this is a very forgiving recipe.  It was really good!  The sauce is awesome.  I don't know what "asian chile paste with garlic" is so I used sirracha (about 1/2 Tbsp) and cut back on the oyster sauce (1/2 - 3/4 Tbsp) - since it was for the kids.  The sauce is really good.  Very flavorful.  It was a hit!  I'll definitely be making this again (and probably I'll end up making it on a regular basis).  Look forward to trying it with noodles - but I'd certainly double the sauce if I do.

Oh my, this is sooooo good! We love Asian food in our house but have never tried making lo mein. This was very close to restaurant style (bf said he thought it was better). The sauce gets nice and thick and coats the noodles perfectly. We used Japanese noodles instead of spaghetti. We chose pea pods, carrots, water chestnuts, and green onion for the veggies. Everything worked so well together. Has a nice heat - I love sriracha but found I didn't even need to add any. Will definitely make again!!

This was a hit! My guys loved it. After reading reviews, I made 1 1/2 times the sauce, and just a bit less of the oyster and chili garlic paste. Stir fried the meat in the oil and garlic before adding veges. I also used rice noodles.  Thanks for a wonderful delicious Beef Lo Mein recipe, definitely a keeper.

Wow!  Was this good!  My hubby absolutely loved this recipe and asked me to put into regular rotation.  I used chinese noodles and pork tenderloin, but essentially the remainder of the recipe was used as is including the asian chile sauce with garlic, which gave it a nice heat.  I did add about a tsp of rice vinegar to the sauce.

Update:  I made this again using beef.  Based on other reviews I doubled sauce...I would not do this again.  It made the lo mein too salty.  I think the key is to stick to the amounts indicated in the recipe.  The sauce for the ingredients list is perfect.  You may depending on your preference for heat, increase the chili paste.  I definitely recommend using Asian style noodles for a more authentic dish.

I am not a Chinese food connoisseur but we really liked this! I used broccoli, red bell pepper, julienned carrots, and green onions. I did mix up the order of things though. I boiled my pasta and at the last 5 minutes threw in the broccoli so it would get done the way we like it. But I stir-fried the meat first so it would get a nice brown on it. ( I used a top round steak thinly sliced). Then I took it out of the pan and stir-fried the garlic, ginger, and veggies. I like my veggies more done than 3 minutes would have given me so I threw in a little pasta water and put the lid on so the veggies would cook and garlic wouldn't burn. When they were almost done the way I like I put the meat back in until it was hot again. I stirred only half of the sauce into the pasta and broccoli before putting in the pan. I stirred it all up well then stirred in the last of the sauce. It seems like it made it easier to distribute instead of the pasta soaking it all up. Will use this again with different veggies. The combinations are endless.

I liked this. I pretty much followed the recipe, but I did double the sauce. I seasoned my skirt steak with fajita seasonings and cooked it out on the grill for about six minutes a side.  I used snow peas, carrots, red onion, and bits of broccoli tossing in some green onions and cilantro at the end.  Served with egg rolls  and it was a hit.

WOW!! Outstanding.  I used green & red bell peppers, green beans (zapped first for 75 sec in the microwave), mini carrots (split lengthwise), red onion, celery, bok choy and mushrooms.  Double the sauce - as others have recommended.  I also used rice noodles, which I thought elevated it to WOW, but 1/2 package is probably enough.  Like some other reviewers, I sautéed the steak first, then beans &  carrots, then onions & celery, finally mushrooms, peppers & bok choy.  I like some crispness to my vegs and different vegs need different cooking times.  The flavor & texture was amazing!

This is not bad, IMHO, but it's kinda wrong to cook the beef with the veggies unless you're an extremely skilled Asian cook, with some serious gas going and a very well-seasoned wok.  

Here's how to make GOOD asian-style beef (imho) ... freeze flank steak (top round is okay too) for 1.5 hours (this helps you cut it thin), then cut directly AGAINST grain, as thin as possible.  Pound both sides of steak slices with your meat tenderizing hammer until very thin and tender.  

Then throw beef slices into a plastic bag with about 2 teaspoon of cornstarch and 2 tsp full-sodium soy sauce per 1/4 lb of meat.  Add a little fresh cracked black pepper, and shake/knead the bag to mix.  Let marinade 1-3 hours in fridge.  This is called 'velveting' the meat.

Then fire up your wok, get it very hot, then add a good splash of high-smoke-point oil (less if it's non-stick but I recommend a REAL wok),  swirl oil around sides well, and then toss the meat strips onto the hot wok surfaces, sides and all.  Let sear for a good minute, then scrape it off the sides into the middle, and begin tossing, either by tossing the whole wok, or with a spatula.  

Continue cooking over high heat for 2-4 minutes, trying to get a good sear and even getting a touch of burning on the outside of the meat.   A little Wok-Hei, as they say.  Then set aside and cover to keep warm.  

THEN make everything else in same wok, w/o cleaning it out.  

At the point you're doing your final put-together, adding the sauce (and no

I made this recipe exactly as shown except for doubling the sauce (just 'cause we like sauce!) and it was delicious!  My picky husband even loved it and said it was better than the one he always gets at our favorite Chinese place!  I used pre-packaged Stir Fry veggies and added sliced mushrooms and water chestnuts!

Like everyone else says, you need to double the sauce.  But the meat also should be marinated, it had NO flavor, and was tough.  Also, it was crazy to add the raw meat to 4 cups of cooked vegetables.  I did that, but the meat sat cold on top of the veggies, and the Wok cooled down so much that the meat could not cook.  I finally scooped out all the veggies so that the Wok would get hot again and cook the meat.  THEN I added the veggies back to the wok to let them heat up again with the meat, and then with the spaghetti.  I like the flavors of the sauce, just wished I had used half to flavor the meat with it.

Excellent flavor and a quick dinner. I hit the grocery store right after they had marked down the pre packaged cut up vegetables and that lowered meal prep down to about 15 mins.

Great recipe full of flavour!  I took others advice and marinated the beef in the sauce first then added a second batch of sauce as directed. I used carrots, broccoli, onions, red peppers, mushrooms, bean sprouts and then added pineapple and tomato once cooked.  The substitutions I made was using stir fry oil instead of peanut oil (due to allergies), used lo mein noodles and I didn’t have Asian Chili paste so I added hot sauce instead.  Thanks for the recipe!

This dish is amazing!!!  Thank you for the recipe.  I used fresh vegetables (snow peas, julienned carrots, baby bok choy, and red peppers).  I also used some stir fry sauce I had on hand to supplement the sauce, and I topped mine with some cilantro and sririacha sauce.  The whole family gives this a big thumbs up.

Will definitely make again. I doubled the sauce as suggested elsewhere and it was the perfect amount. Veggies I used were red and green bell peppers, cremini mushrooms, carrots, snap peas and onion. I used Gluten free spaghtetti noodles and really like the texture.

Great recipe base, and 5 star as is. I doubled the veggies & sauce, used 12 oz. of chinese noodles I had on hand, and used the original meat amount. It fed 5 teenagers and two adults. It disappeared completely. Usually they don't eat that much, so this is now part of our meal rotation.

Thought the spaghetti noodles would be weird but it wasn't at all. This dish is amazing!  I used sirloin steak, carrots, onion, cabbage, mushrooms,  and peapods.  I also doubled the sauce as others suggested. A keeper for sure! Also made the wonton soup recipe from this sight. A really wonderful meal!

I didn't have oyster sauce but it turned out great without it. Just added more soy sauce and sesame oil. Used: Red Bell Pepper, Yellow onion, Water Chestnuts, Baby Corn, Mushrooms, Broccoli, Green onion and sesame seeds. Tasted wonderful and when I had an egg roll on the side. That made it the perfect meal.

This was really good.  I browned the meat with the garlic and ginger before adding the veggies, and I used Sriracha for the chili paste.

This is a really easy and tasty recipe. I did double the sauce as others suggested and it was the perfect amount. For veggies I used snap peas, red pepper, bok choy, and shredded carrots. I will for sure make this again. Very good recipe.

I was VERY happy with this recipe! Great flavor to it. I did double the sauce and it was a little salty since I used regular soy sauce, my bad lol! It is a little spicy using the tablespoon of chili garlic sauce so tone that down if you don't like heat. Will definitely make this again.

Wow!  Simply amazing.....this was so easy to make and was a huge hit in my house!  I doubled the sauce recipe, cooked the meat prior to cooking the vegetables, added snow peas, mushrooms, broccoli slaw and onions.  The vegetable variations are endless.  Next time I will add, perhaps, a cup or 2 more vegetables.
Definitely going to be making this dish again.
**Does anyone have any suggestions on how to easily get the Oyster Sauce out of the jar? It was a battle!

This is a great base recipe. I used shiitake mushrooms, snowpeas, asparagus and onions. i doubled the sauce recipe based on other reviews, which was fine but probably not necessary. My husband, who doesn't care for Asian food much except for take-out chow mein, had two helpings, so I will make this again.

Such a good recipe! Thank you for sharing it. I threw in some pineapple chunks while preparing the beef, then removed the chunks when I put it all together. It added another layer to an excellent recipe.

Just made this tonight and my family loved it!  I only had to make one substitution:  did not have the Asian chile paste, so I used Siracha chile sauce with a little garlic powder.  And based on the other reviews, I only made about 4-6 oz. of the pasta, but did make an extra side of buckwheat soba noodles, b/c I love those.  I also grilled a 2lb. flank steak only b/c I want to make a steak salad tomorrow with the extra. My 8 yr. old and 11 yr. old went back for seconds and thirds!  I always have leftovers when we make stir fry, but not this time!  This is a very versatile recipe that would adapt well to using chicken, shrimp or vegetarian. Will definitely be making this again!

I was skeptical at first but after trying it, the family just loved it!  I made a few modifications but I am sure the original would have tasted just as amazing.  I substituted the vegetables with a bag of steam-able stir fry vegetables.  I also used lo mien noodles instead of spaghetti.  I used to order Beef Lo Mien once a week for $9 and it tasted great but with making this recipe I am able to save $2/ plate and have something that tastes just as good as well as having a great time cooking with my wife.

I love making stir fry dishes. My 35 year old wok is seasoned to perfection! I often don't even use a recipe anymore, but this was absolutely delicious. The only thing I changed was I cut the Asian Chili garlic Paste to 2 tsp and added 2 tsp of Asian sweet chili sauce. Vegetables I used were baby bok choy, snow peas, red sweet banana pepper, onion, carrots and broccoli.

Fabulous.  I did marinate the beef with a bit of soy sauce and cornstarch (I didn't measure, sorry) for a couple of hours.  I sauteed the garlic and ginger (I used ginger paste because that was what I had) and added the beef to that.  I did use broccoli slaw and snow peas; adding about 1/3 cup of water when I added the vegetables.  I also used udon noodles rather than spaghetti noodles. The oyster sauce and chili paste were not overpowering at all.  I will make again!

This recipe was awesome. I used skirt steak because I didn't have flank. I seasoned the meat with little salt & pepper. Next time, I might use sirloin instead (tenderness). I doubled the entire recipe so I could have plenty of leftovers for next day's lunches. I used 2 additional garlic cloves.  When I tasted the final product, I ended up adding another tablespoon of soy sauce and another tablespoon of the chili paste. I cooked the meat first and then added the vegetables because I didn't want them to overcook. I also realized that accidentally I used tablespoons instead of teaspoons for the sesame oil (which made me glad because it added extra flavor). This was a hit in my home.  I didn't give it 5 stars because without the adjustments I made, my family wouldn't have enjoyed it as much. Definitely making this again!

A bug hit! My husband was skeptical when he saw what I made, but after a taste test was thrilled. He even took it with him to work for lunch today. I used lo mein noodles I had on hand, and since it was a last minute dinner plan I used stew beef I had in the freezer. I quadrupled the amount of sauce and still found it could have used more. Next time I'll make a bigger batch of the sauce since the noodles really soak it up. This would be great with any meat or seafood.

My kids, who are both fuzzy eaters, will no longer eat Beef Lo Mein at a restaurant. they prefer mine. They usually hate my food (I am a great cook, my kids are boring eaters). One thing I do differently is I put a couple slices of fresh ginger in it instead of mincing it. This makes the ginger flavour more palatable for my unadventurous  kids. Love using Kappa cabbage, water chestnuts, snow peas and baby carrots.

I made this with a few modifications.  I used frozen/defrosted Mukimame Soybeans &  fresh cut veggies I had on hand: Thai red chili pepper, colored bell peppers, carrots, yellow & red onion, yellow summer squash, mushrooms, asparagus - cut uniformly. I had leftover cooked rib eye steak from another meal, cut into thin strips.  The sauce was great and balanced, however I substituted Fish Sauce for the Oyster Sauce, and added 1Tbsp Rice Wine Vinegar and 1Tbsp corn starch (made a slurry with cold water) to thicken the sauce.  We served this over either leftover egg noodles & fresh steamed Jasmine Rice topped with chopped green onions and cilantro.  I would make this again because it is so versatile and a great way to clean out the veggie crisper & use up leftovers.

Great recipe! I doubled the sauce, and added a 1 TBSP corn starch slurry to thicken it. I recommend cooking your beef or other protein separately and adding it at the end.

Delicious! My very picky husband took THREE helpings and my daughter is looking forward to having the leftovers cold for breakfast! Guess I'm going to have to buy me a wok now, as I know I'll be making this more often.

Me and the boys loved it (they range from 12 - 17) The bf on the other hand, not so much, but veggies are not his thing. I probably doubled the sauce, skipped the peanut oil, just used olive. For the veggies I bought fresh snow peas, pods, and carrots. Am making again this weekend ( but will be making something else for the veggie hater in the family. ;-) OHHH and I also made it with strips of chicken fillets.

Made it without substitutions, used a bag of mixed Asian vegetables, needed more sauce so increased amounts of sauce ingredients, and added green onion.  I found it pretty bland and while it wasn't bad, I probably wouldn't make it again.

I made this with leftover rib eye steak.  It was really good! The veggies I used were primarily peppers (3 colors) and onion.  And I used Penne Pasta instead.  I would definitely make this again.  The sauce was great and made the dish I didn't have oyster sauce, and it was still great..

I made as written, but did double the sauce.  I let the beef marinate in the sauce an hour before cooking.  Excellent!  My family loved it!

All I can say is my picky children LOVED it and asked me to make it again.  Winner in my book!  It was very tasty and easy to make.  I don't like ginger so I didn't use it and couldn't find the Asian paste.  The little bit that was leftover my kids asked for the next day.  I also used spaghetti and lo mien noodles, they ate it up.  Will make again.

I managed to find yakisoba (pre-cooked) noodles so I used that instead of spaghetti as the Korean lady at my korean shop recommended. I also used carrots, red pepper, mushrooms, baby corn, and a little bit of green onions for the veg. I substituted red pepper flakes and some extra garlic for the chili garlic sauce. My husband said it tasted just like our favorite takeout place although the meat I sliced wasn't as thin, next time I will have the butcher do it. I thought all that garlic and ginger would be way too much but it wasn't at all. Overall, it cost me 1/2 to 1/3 the normal price to make my own it so I definitely willing be doing it again and probably pay for the chili garlic sauce too!

I sliced sirloin steak and marinated with the Teriyaki Marinade from this site for about 8 hours. Used a bag of frozen Asparagus stir-fry veggies. Instead of the sauce in the recipe, I added a spoonful of Hoisin sauce and mixed the leftover Marinade with a couple of tablespoons of cornstarch. When the meat was cooked, I added leftover spaghetti noodles to the pan and poured the sauce over. Served with Trader Joe's steamed dumplings. It was a hit - yum!!

I followed others suggestion to stir-fry the meat first and double the sauce part. I used sorba noodles in place of the spaghetti.

It was expensive to buy all the sauce ingredients, but now that I have them I will make this recipes again. My hubby said it tasted great.  So it is a keeper!

Really enjoyed this recipe - and I'm my own worst critic! I didn't change much of anything except that I marinaded the beef to tenderize it. Used the gluten free spaghetti like others suggested which worked great. Grabbed a bag of "stir fry salad" shredded veggies of Brussels sprouts, broccoli, carrots, and snap peas and chopped it all up which worked great. Am def adding this into the rotation!

The sesame oil with the noodles and the garlic and ginger are fragrant . I used Costco frozen Asian veggies and Thai chili paste because that's what I had on hand. My family enjoyed it and I will make it again.

I used some med flank steak we had leftover from the steak fajitas we had last night.  I made some changes of course; I stirred 1/4 cp of peanut sauce into the hot spaghetti. 

I mixed up the soy sauce, 1 Tbls brown sugar and 1 tsp of red pepper flakes and added it to the skillet with the vegetables when I added the flank steak slices.  I covered it and cooked it a couple of minutes more.  

I mixed in the spaghetti and topped it with chopped peanuts.  It had a light peanut flavor and just a tiny bit of heat.  It was a big, big hit!!!

This was great! I used about 3/4 lb London broil because it was what I had. I used a bag of stir fry veggies and substituted rice noodles for spaghetti. I cooked my meat before adding the vegetables to the pan because I like crispy veggies and like to make sure my meat is cooked. This came together fast and easily. I may have added more ginger than what was called for since we could really taste it, but we didn't mind.

Son and daughter love Lo Mein so I thought heck, I can make it.  I, too, made three times the sauce. Glad I did.  I also used a bit more oil (peanut oil) and red pepper flakes too. Made enough for lunch the next day.

Don't forget the chili garlic sauce!  I got distracted when cooking, and it was not good without it! Thankfully, it was easy to add in with the leftovers.
The meat overtook the dish for me.  Next time, more veggies!

I made this for lunch today, and absolutely loved it!  I plan to make it again, very soon.  

In fact, this may become our "comfort food" go to recipe, when we crave something yummy, that's not too difficult to make at home.

I made it  with a chuck roast cutting off the fat because it was expensive using recommended piece of meat, but honestly slicing it thin i dont think youd know the difference. Served it with rice and Loved it! Also this would serve way more than four i think. We used to be a family of six but people are away at college and i dont think i would have had to double this add my two boys back in.  Definitely could feed six in my opinion

This was fantastic and quickly became a family favorite. It is even better reheated the next day! I made extra sauce and used it to marinate the beef ahead of time, along with a little apple cider vinegar to make it extra tender. It would also be great as a stir fry served over rice.

I think the sauce part could be doubled, but a great recipe!

I made it exactly as written. The flavour was weak and the beef was tough.

Greatest recipe ever! I double the sauce because it's so yummy! My guys all love spicey food and this dish really delivers. They like pasta a lot, so sometimes I just make the sauce & noodles. I find myself making this recipe very often. It's awesome!!

4 stars because it needed adjustments. I doubled the sauce and let the sliced steak marinate for about an hour in half the sauce along with extra grated ginger and minced garlic. I also added a half tbs of corn starch to the other half of the marinade before tossing it with the spaghetti and adding it to the steak mixture. This was awesome and even my picky 11 year old loved it. Will definitely make again and again!!

This was a little bland and strange that it used pasta- not very Asian. I used noodles instead and pork in place of steak but not all that flavoursome.

Probably won't bother making this again:  it was pretty bland, despite doubling the sauce ingredients and garlic / ginger.

Great taste, my husband and kids ate it up!  I only used a half pound of pasta and it was still wonderful.  For my mixed veggies I chopped up bok choy & carrots, used mushrooms & bean sprouts.  Great dish that was easy to prepare.
