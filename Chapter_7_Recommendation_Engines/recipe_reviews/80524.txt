This recipe was too strong on blue cheese flavor for my family.  Perhaps I will try other reviewers idea of using less blue cheese next time.

It was too cheesy. I know that its a cheese dip, but it was way too cheesy for my family.

great recipe! I did substitute garlic for the olives and only put in 1 oz blue cheese. Texture and taste is awesome with pecans.

This was a good recipe.  I will be making this again.  Because we love olives, a little heat and some crunch, I also added some chopped green olives that happened to be stuffed with jalapeno (the heat) and about a 1/4 cup of finely diced seet red peppers (for crunch and a bit of color). A pound of cream cheese makes 2 large cheese balls, I would probably cut the recipe in half unless you entertain alot or are having a crowd over.

So yummy! I substituted 1/2 c. Diced red peppers for the olives and we love blue cheese so I used a 5oz. container.  Everyone loved it.  It does make a lot, so you may want to make half a recipe, but we ate the whole thing!
