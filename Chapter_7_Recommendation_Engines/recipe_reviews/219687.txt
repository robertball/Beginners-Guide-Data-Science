I made this for my husband and myself a couple of weeks ago.  I took a photo and uploaded it but forgot to post a review.  I used a frozen bag of mixed vegetables, added some minced fresh garlic, and used the optional cream of mushroom soup.  I thought it was good but just felt like it was lacking something.  My husband didn't like it at all. He said it was very bland. I think it was because of the brown gravy mix. Next time I'll try it with beefy onion soup mix and water instead of the beef broth and gravy mix.  I'll also thaw the frozen vegetables and add them at the end so they don't get mushy and washed out looking.

This is a great recipe. I added more onions (but I *always* add more onions!) and I also didn't throw my frozen veggies in until the very end. The beef was so very tender. This recipe is very easy to personalize to your family's tastes. I prefer it with an onion gravy mix as well. Give it a try! :D

Followed the recipe.  Stew was boring.  No flavor.  Didn't even create a nice aroma when cooking.  Used premium ingredients.  Yuck!  Good for hog slops.

Really good stew! I modified it a bit by only adding potatoes, mushrooms, onion, and carrots. Also freezes well.

I made this on a cold winter afternoon because we had thawed steak in the fridge. I used steak because it was thawed and waiting to be cooked. The meat was so tender I could chew it, just days after i had atooth extracted! The veggies were firm, but not too crunchy. Didn't have gravy mix, used onion soup mix instead. Corn and peas are a nice surprise for a stew.

Added green peppers and used red potatoes. In regular rotation now - no photo this time (gone before I could get a pic).

I used a small mixed vegetable bag and a lot of salt and pepper. I only had small onions so I used three and it worked fine. This is a good stew, highly recommended.

A very satisfying stew. I never thought of using the brown gravy mix before, but it works well leaving the finished product with a hearty and thick sauce. This was easy to make. I used a London broil and the meat was nice and tender. This certainly is a good base stew recipe that is open for variations in ingredients.

It had good flavor but was too runny and I had added mushroom soup.  And not enough meat for my taste.  Next time I will one less can of broth and add another pound of meat.  I made it with stew meat instead of round steak.

Have made this several x and each time it was great. For larger amounts, I have use a large cast iron pot and put it inside the bbq to cook all day. I had only 1 side burner on low and placed the pot on the other side of the grill and closed the bbq. The stew needed stirring about every 45-60 minutes and the pot would also be rotated 1/2 turn. I would let it cook for 6-8 hrs. Without a lid on the pot, it got a slight bbq taste added to it. I like this way the best out of all the times that I have made this stew.

This stew was decent enough. I felt like the gravy was missing a little something. If I make it again I'll put my own touch to it.

I made this dish and it was fantastic; however, you need to let it slow cook for six hours.
