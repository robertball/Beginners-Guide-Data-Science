Seriously awesome recipe! So simple, which is amazing for 2 reasons: 1. super quick 2. customizable to your tastes or mood! If I feel like jazzin it up, I'll add oregano or herb de provence & paprika, also really great served on top of pasta, such as spaghetti or egg noodles. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Good stuff. I used Italian style Panko bread crumbs and instead of putting sauce in the baking pan I just put it on the chicken . I think it would be too saucey the other way. Just my opinion. Served it with spaghetti and garlic bread and everyone was happy.

This is a very good and easy recipe.  I also added oregano and paprika seasonings to the bread crumbs, and I added a small can of stems and pieces mushrooms (drained) to the sauce.  I served the entree on vermicelli.

Excellent recipe! Thank you. I added basil and garlic powder to the crumbs (I used japanese crumbs) and more mozerella (for the kids!). It was a huge hit and now on the favorites list!
