YUM  really good.. different cookie taste than the usual.  My only sub  was the root beer extract. concentrate. I went to three stores looking for it,.. no where to be found. I know I have seen it before, but not this time.  I grabbed a cheap bottle of root beer, , poured 2 cups into a pot and cooked it down to a syrup.  It worked great and its a lot cheaper than a bottle of extract. .. if you even able to find the stuff.  These went over really well at church.. made the root beer fans very happy

These have turned into some of our favorite cookies. They are delicious and easy. I love that they aren't your run of the mill cookie. I turn to this recipe when I have to take cookies to an event.

Very good! The only thing I changed was the addition of one teaspoon of salt and I browned the butter. A big hit at our house!

The Root Beer flavor is very light, I would suggest not using the vanilla pudding, or using 1 Tablespoon of the Root Beer Concentrate
