I loved this rice!!  I used 1c. jasmine rice and decreased the oj to 1c and added 3/4c ch. broth w/ the zest.  Covered and simmered 15 min.  Folded in the manderins then sprinkled toasted slivered almonds and sliced green onions on top.  Fantastic.  Thank you so much!!

Great sidedish.  We modified it slightly.  Being ever health-minded, we used brown rice.  This did not affect the outcome at all in my opinion.  We doubled the reciped first, put it all in a rice cooker.  Checking it every 10 minutes, we had to add more Orange Juice everytime so I would say we put about 1 cup more than the recipe called for ( doubling anyway ) so put 1/2 cup more for a single serving.  Took roughly 30 minutes to cook and went great with the Gingered Chicken Breast recipe on this site. Enjoy!

What a great and easy recipe. I used the liquid from the mandarin oranges to make up some of the liquid. And I added a little dried parsley for color before serving. Very nice dish. Thanks. I served it with Rosemary Chicken with Orange Maple Glaze from this site.

I loved the taste and the ease of this recipe.  I used it with the Orange Rosemary Chicken recipe I found at this sight.  I also added sauted onion and celery.  I have always gotten compliments when I served this rice dish.  I love the mandarin orange pieces in it.  That makes it visually appealing as well.

This was very tasty and easy to make.  I did not have any orange zest so I left it out, but it still tasted great!  It took a little longer than 5 minutes for the liquid to absorb and the rice to finish cooking, but I just left it on a few extra minutes and it was fine.  Thanks!

Unfortunately this rice will not be a keeper. Infact, this was last time using instant rice. The long grain enriched kind just taste *so* much better! The mandarins were tasty but the rice was awful.

I can only rate this 3 stars because I altered the recipe. I didnt have OJ so I doubled the orange zest and used milk. The rice was creamy and a suble flavor. I think if I made this again I would try with OJ and I would double the servings and still use milk in place of one of the servings of OJ.

This is a great recipe for kids.  Mine couldn't get enough rice because they love mandarin oranges.  The citrus flavor still wasn't as strong as I would like.  Next time I will substitute orange juice for the pineapple juice and add lemon zest in addition to the orange zest.

My family and I LOVED this rice. I was making shishkabobs with pineapple and cherries and could not think of anything to have with it. I came across this recipe, and was a little leery, just because it sounded weird...but it was GREAT!
I do not like minute rice, so I used long grain organic rice, and I put it in my rice cooker. I put the Orange Juice, Orange Zest (and a teaspoon lemon zest), and melted butter in the rice cooker, mixed it up real good, then put the rice in and let it do its thing. When the rice was almost done I noticed it needed a little more liquid so I added some Mandarin and Pineapple juice to it. Once it was done, I let the rice cool a bit, and then added the Mandarins to the mixture (more then what was called for, but my son LOVES them). 
Everyone had 2 helpings, and I couldnt believe it. Rice is not a big deal in my house, but this rice was!! Thank you!! It was SO SO GOOD!!

The ingredients of this recipe sounded so good, I had to try it. Unfortunately, both my husband and I have problems with orange juice souring on our stomachs. This did, too. It was very tasty, and I love mandarins. It's just that darn old orange juice! I might try it without the orange juice, and just adding the mandarins and some almonds. For those of you that can handle the juice, go for it!

For quick, Iâ€™m sure this worked well!  My neighborhood Trader...always has mandarins and oranges ripe and juicy, so I substituted all the instant ingredients for real and feel there was much more flavor!  BZ

Great recipe.  BUT the cooking time DID NOT work for me.  I have been cursed with making rice though so maybe it was just me.  I don't like hard rice so I let it simmer for the typical 20 minutes.  I did add a chopped fresh jalapeÃ±o because I love spicy food and since I needed more liquid to allow the simmer time, I added vegetable broth because I wanted a little bit of saltiness to compliment the sweet, citrus flavor.

I adapted this to non-instant long-grain rice like so: fried the orange zest in butter with half an onion and a garlic clove, then cooked one cup of rice in one cup of orange juice and one cup of water (plus salt to taste). Didn't add any mandarin segments. The rice had a pale yellow colour and obvious citrusy taste, but was still savoury. Very nice!

We enjoyed this recipe very much!  I used brown rice instead of instant and added some salt.  Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing although I would cut the oranges in 3rds next time so they're not so chunky.  Thank you for a great recipe!

A little too tangy and sweet but with some adjustments this could be a hit... I made it according to the recipe except for substituting regular brown rice and omitting the butter.  Next time I will reduce the OJ to 3/4C and add some garlic and chives to make it more savory.  I will also omit mixing in the mandarins and just top the rice with 1/3 of the mandarins.  Best served with something simple like grilled chicken so there's not a lot of sauce or clash in flavors with the rice.

This recipe had a nice orange flavor, but I thought it was just a little bland.  (I didn't have any orange zest so I left it out -- if I'd included it, it probably would have had a more pronounced flavor.) Since I was serving it with chicken, I added some powdered chicken bouillon, and that helped. I think if I make this again, I'll try adding an herb that goes well with citrus.
