I put half the amount of ginger root in because I was concerned that it would overpower the rest of the ingredients, otherwise, I followed the recipe.  Still, my husband said "...all I can taste is ginger." and he didn't even finish his. Don't know, maybe I just had a large piece of ginger root?  It might be better to specify the amount a little better, say like 1/2 tsp or whatever.  The icy consistency was just about perfect for me, but there was also a grainy texture which I have to think came from the ginger root.  Loved the idea of fresh orange, carrots, and grapes for a smoothie, but this one just didn't work for us.  Actually, I might just try it again because I like this breaks out nutritionally and completely leave out the ginger.  Sorry for the less than favorable review.

This "Oranginger Smoothie" is a wonderful combination of flavors! I have to admit though I cheated and put it through my Champion juicer so I actually made a juice instead of a smoothie.  Thank you Linda (LMT) for sharing your recipe!

I initially did not add any ginger. The base is fibrous and pulpy. It was reminiscent of baby food, difficult to choke down. Even after adding dried ginger to spice it up, it was by far the worst smoothie I've had. Really there is nothing "smooth" about it!
