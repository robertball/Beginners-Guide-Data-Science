These were wonderful!  Would be great for Thanksgiving time especially.  I made two modifications to cut down on the fat:  used only 2 Tbl. butter and used skim milk.  I thought there was too much nutmeg flavor, so next time I will reduce to 1/4 tsp.  I added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. vanilla, and will definitely do that again.  Note that 3/4 lb. potatoes is the same as 2 1/2 cups cut up (in case you don't have a scale).  I peeled and cut the potato into chunks before boiling, so I omitted the skin removal and mashing steps (they mashed very easily when blending with a mixer with the other ingredients).  I mixed all wet ingredients with the potatoes in one bowl, then mixed all the dry ingredients in another bowl, putting them together at the end.  I did have to add more milk (almost 1/2 cup) to make them more spreadable.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I decided to try altering this recipe and it was great (adults and kids alike!).  Instead of the 1-1/2 cups flour - I used 1 cup flour and 1/2 cups rolled oats.  (seemed to really hold well and have a fluffy pancake - tasted great too!)  I also added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp pure vanilla extract.  We served it w/cinnamon sugar butter and all loved them!

This was awesome! Add chopped pecans to the batter or sprinkle them on top for a real Louisiana flavor. We froze half the batter for later use, and it was even tastier than the first day. I think the key is to let it sit for a while to really bring out the taste of the potatoes.

I made the recipe as written.  These pancakes were awesome.  I wasn't sure what 3/4lb of sweet potatoes comes out to so I used one cup mashed sweet potatoes and that was perfect.  This recipes is a keeper for my family!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I omitted the butter, used whole wheat flour, used 1/2 cup oats in place of 1/2 cup flour, and added about a 1/2 tsp each of  cinnamon and vanilla.  I put the batter in the fridge over night and added  a little extra milk in the morning.  The first batch I made tasted doughy in the middle so the next batch I took the back of a spoon and spread out the batter. Very good!

I made this with canned sweet potatoes in syrup. I also added ginger and cinnamon to the batter. I used self rising flour and omitted the salt and levening. These turned out excellent! I am going to try it with canned pumpkin next.

This was soooo great.  My mom grew some really giant sweet potatos and I didn't know what to do with them all.  This recipe was wonderful!  I even made them, placed them on a cookie sheet and froze them, then put them in ziploc bags, sonow when we want one or two (or for dinner) they are already made, I just have to nuke them for a moment or so.

These were so good!  As other reviewers mentioned, I added 1 TB sugar, 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  I also mixed all the wet ingrediants in a food processor, it was so quick and easy.

Delicious num numms!!! Made this with my kids. it ended up as brunch b/c it took so long but it was delicious. i added vanilla and extra cinnamon per advice. they were tender and yummy. i was a bit worried about eye-ing 3/4 of a lb. of sweet potato so i did one large and one half of a meduim and that worked fine. i pricked and nuked my potatoes in the microwave for 15 minutes, that made them just right. then i just opened them and scooped the insides out so i skipped the cold water thing.it was fine. i had my 2 yr old add the milk and vanilla too cool the potatoes b4 adding the egg. worked out great. If you find that your pancakes are rubbery its b/c you mixed them too much. mix it until just combined well then leave it. oh, i also let the batter rest about 30 min. per other reviews. We ate it with homwmade applesauce so minus the syrup. I wouldnt make it again for a normal breakfast b/c of the time it took but i can see doing this (minus the kiddies)  for a bring-a-dish affair

After making this recipe so many times that I have memorized it I felt I had to put in a positive review.  Recently was a "guest chef" at the Ronald McDonald house and recieved rave reviews.  They are also super delicious with chocolate chips.

My modifications:
3/4 lb sweet potatos = 2 1/2 cups
1 t cinnamon
1/4t nutmeg
1/2 t vanilla

Also, I found that microwaving the sweet potato is a timesaver and there is no issue with too much moisture.

This recipe is a keeper. Amazingly light and fluffy. I can't figure out what the people who said how dense they were and how they didn't cook did. The 3/4 pound of potatoes WAS confusing to me. I used a cup of mashed sweet potatoes (nothing added to them). I also used 1 cup regular flour, and 1/2 cup oats, and added 1/2 t cinnamon and vanilla (as was suggested in reviews). I also used 1/2 c buttermilk and 1 cup milk. For fun, I added chopped nuts and dried fruit (but will add dried apples next time if I have on hand). Seriously, they smelled so good when cooking, and were SO light and fluffy! I think maybe using less sweet potatoes helped, other reviewers seemed to use a lot more, making them much more heavy and dense. I'll post a pic of what I made. Am VERY happy with this recipe!

I THINK THE RECIPE SUBMITTER INTENDED FOR PEOPLE TO USE 3/4 LB. OF SWEET POTATO WEIGHED AFTER COOKING THEM, but she didn't write that, and I went by the recipe as written.  I couldn't get these to cook through. The only thing I changed was to add a bit more spice.  I cooked them for twice as long as I usually cook pancakes, and on a hotter griddle, but they came out gooey and inedible. Next time, I'll add a T. of sugar to the wet ingredients.  And I'll separate the eggs and beat the whites until they make peaks. I'll use less milk to make them less wet.

Wow, these pancackes are delicious. I use about 1 heaping cup of sweet potatoes for this and it's perfect.  I also add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and omit the nutmeg since it's too overpowering.  Great recipe.

How do you cook these all the way through?  I cooked these twice for so long and it was still gooey in the middle both times. I'm disappointed that I wasted two sweet potatoes. I would love to know why they didn't cook through. I'm trying another recipe.

These are great!!! I made them this morning and my husband and 5 year old absolutely loved them.  I added a teaspoon each of cinnamon and vanilla.  I weighed out the mashed sweet potatoes and it came to exactly 1 1/4 cups.  I will be making these again soon!

It makes me mad to take my time and ingredients and work at making something to end up empty handed and hungry.  I followed the directions perfectly, except for halving the recipe, which I double checked.  The batter was obviously too thick, so I thinned it down with more milk.  Even so, no matter how long I cooked them, these pancakes were gooey in the center.  Since the recipe has egg in it, I wasn't going to serve these undercooked.  I don't know how anyone had a decent result with this recipe, and now we're eating peanut butter sandwiches for dinner, mad.

What a great idea!!  I can't believe I haven't made these before!  I made a few alterations and probably will again the next time I make them.  I used sweet potato puree from Trader Joe's (saved a TON of time) and used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of regular.  The batter was very thick and didn't "lay" on the hot pan so I increased the milk to at least 2 cups if I wanted any movement on the pan.  I also subbed in cinnamon for the nutmeg and added about 2 tsp vanilla (yum!).  I also cut the salt in half (I can always taste it in pancakes).  But one word of advice: note that the finished pancakes are EXTREMELY moist due to the milk and s/p.  So I ended up burning several of mine thinking they weren't done yet :P  They were, but the pancake does not develop the firmness of a traditional pancake.  When done, it even "gives" when you press on it.  And it will not "bubble" nearly as much as a regular pancake, too, so check it sooner than later to flip.  Since there is no sugar in the batter, you have a bit more freedom to have fun with the toppings.  But I just topped it with some organic whole milk french vanilla yogurt.  My kids loved it!  It looked like icing! :) I may put in a 1/4 cup sugar next time and just top with butter (they are super tasty and don't need much!).  But overall, I will definitely be making these again...way healthier than regular pancakes and a fun treat for the fall!

Delicious! I mixed the wet ingredients in my food processor and left them in the fridge overnight; in the morning I added the dry and cooked up these pancakes in bacon grease. Loved it, didn't change a thing! Thanks for a cool recipe.

I made a couple changes, just for my tastes. I made the milk sour,
using a tablespoon of vinegar per cup. This was not a good addition.
If I made them again, I would stick with just plain whole milk. I
used canned sweet potatoes, with the juice drained off, about half
of a 28 oz. can. I also used about a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice
and added a half cup of brown sugar. It wasn't sweet enough for my
tastes, so I might add in the couple of tablespoons that the recipe
calls for. I also will add pecans next time. I didn't this time 
because I didn't have any. I also made this batter the night before
and didn't overmix. The pancake batter was incredibly fluffy. This
batter is also moist, which required a little more cooking time
than your usual pancake batter. The kids loved them, and I liked the 
change from the usual weekend pancake recipe.

Wonderful! Followed the recipe as reads EXCEPT I put in 1/4 lb butter instead of 1/4 cup because I have never seen 1/4 CUP designation for butter. If I did it incorrectly it didn't affect the taste and two eight year olds gobbled it up....even made it with whole wheat flour. Yummy!

This was Great! Instead of nutmeg, I used cinnamon, brown sugar, and pure vanilla extract to taste. Awesome! Thanks for this idea, I never thought of mixing sweet potato with pancakes...

excellent! Easy enough to make and my whole family (toddlers too) loved them. Made me feel good that they were getting something more than just syrup! (I did reduce the amount of nutmeg by half and added cinnamon and vanilla).

I always like to taste the batter just a little before I cook recipes. Well when I tasted this one it was too salty and had no flavor.   I like a pancake that can stand alone without syrup and this one didn't taste like it could do that. So I added a little Allspice, a little more Nutmeg and a hint of Cinnamon. I also added a little Vanilla Extract. This improved the flavor, however once I finally got that under control, the batter was too thick. I didn't add enough spices to affect the thickness so something else was wrong with this. I cooked them on a griddle and the insides weren't done. I was very disappointed with this recipe and won't make it again unfortunately.

Thank you Swizzlesticks for a delicious recipe.  We altered just slightly for our tastes and it came out fluffy and delicious.  We already had a jumbo sweet potato that was roasted the night before, so we pureed that and it weighed a little over 15 oz, so almost two cups.  We added 1 T of brown sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla extract to the wet ingredients.  We used a combination of whole wheat flour and white flour (1 cup of ww and 1/2 cup of white).  We substituted  1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and 1/4 tsp cinnamon for the nutmeg.  Delicious and the kids loved it.

I make these all the time for my grandchildren.  I use all whole wheat flour and add 1 t cinnamon.   They take a little time so I make a batch and put in little freezer bags and take them out as needed.

Great flavor! The batter did not cook right.  The measurement of sweet potatoes is hard to judge.

I made this recipe as stated 2010/10/14.  This is a good jumping off point.  Boiling the sweet potato didn't produce an intense flavor so there was only a hint of it in the pancakes.  The nutmeg was very strong and helped overshadow the flavor of the sweet potatoes.

This is my new favorite pancake recipe.  They were very light.  I used half a can of sweet potatoes in syrup drained and cinnamon, and they were just great!!!  Even my three year old who doesn't eat anything if he thinks it contains a fruit or vegetable said they were "delicious!"

Delicious! I started to mash the potatoes, but they were still a little too firm for me, so I added the milk to the potatoes and put it in the food processor. That worked really well. I also couldn't find my nutmeg, so I used cinnamon  and added 1 tsp pure vanilla. They were sweet and fluffy. My brother added syrup to his but I tried mine first and loved them without! I'm thinking about making more sweet potato/ milk mixture and freezing it so the next time I want these pancakes it will go much faster.

Very good! I was looking for a potato pancake recipe to use with some leftover sweet potato mashers I had and I thought this would be perfect. I didn't add the melted butter because my leftovers already had butter in them, and a bit of sour cream. I used raw coconut oil to cook them and they were delicious. Thanks!

I added more milk and they still were too thick.... They did not cook all the way through unless I almost burnt them... At least the dog liked them, when I turned around the entire plate was eaten off of the counter.... wont make again!

Made this to re-purpose a sweet potato casserole..This was totally easy to make. I ended up using about 3/4 cup of casserole to accomendate 3/4 lbs of actual sweet potatoes. I liked it very much but added a little more nutmeg and a tsp of cinnamon. While everyone else said  they were fine....the rest of the clan went for the fluffy pancakes and the strawberry chip pancakes over these...I loved them. I really loved the flavor and so did my middle child. Paired it with Cinnamon Syrup and like I said...I loved them but they got passed up....I guess my company wasn't soo adventurous as myself. I'd recommend them to others easily.

I made these this morning and they turned out great. The only thing I did different was that I peeled the potatoes before boiling them.  Just a matter of personal preference, no biggie.  Will make again and again!

These are fantastic, another way to enjoy sweet potatoes without the gushiness and butter. I topped them with a simple drizzle of confectioner sugar+milk and they were to die for. I wish my wife liked sweet potato, as I'd make these monthly!  A fantastic recipe and a keeper for sure!

I went super decedent with these by adding some candied pecans on top.  The only modification was I used cloves in place of the nutmeg (I find the flavor to usually be overpowering). I was in the mood for some soul food, and these hit the spot.  

I'd be interested in serving these as a savory dish sometime.  Has anyone tried it?  Perhaps with some sage butter or something of the like, I could see them working with a protein... just a thought :)

I will be making these again!

I thought these were good. I used 1 c. mashed sweet potatoes. It is hard to tell how much it will be as some sweet potatoes are large, some are small- so 1 cup already mashed was good for us. I added 1 tsp. vanilla, cut back nutmeg and added cinnamon and a little pumpkin pie spice also. Tastes great with 1 TBSP brown sugar added, as well as some pecans. **You must thin this batter (all pancake batter) to a pourable consistency or you will have trouble. A pancake batter should bubble so that you know when to flip. After I flip them, I had to flatten these some with the spatula to be sure they were cooking all the way through. I did get them a little golden as they tasted better then and the smell was heavenly.

This was really good! I added a tablespoon of sugar to the batter since I didn't think the sweet potatoes were sweet enough.  Also, i was out of regular milk so I used soy milk, but i'm sure regular milk would've just as good!

Pretty darn good.  I found they tasted better with a bit of vanilla and cinnamon, and the flavors really came together after the batter had been refrigerated overnight.

What can I say!  Last night I made Bea's Whipped Sweet Potato Casserole that I found on this site, so my sweet potatoes had brown sugar, orange juice, cinnamon, nuts, and a few marshmallows in them. (It was a good casserole)  Well, I found this recipe and decided to make the pancakes to eat later...  Anyhow, my 2 yr old and 5 yr old were watching me... we started snacking... then moved on to make it an early lunch. I stopped my 2 yr old at 5 pancakes and my 3 yr old at 3 pancakes!  The recipe made 25, so I guess my size was right on.  They were awesome!  The kids ate them plain, I added butter and syrup.  I HIGHLY recommend these. Thanks, Wendy, for the recipe!

Great recipe recently made them for my wife and she really enjoyed them. I did make a few changes. I used all of the listed ingredients but I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract, a tablespoon of brown sugar, and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. However, for the consistency in which i prefer my batter I used more milk than listed. Just add slowly. I wasn't sure of the weight of my sweet potatoes so i mashed about four and added it to the other wet ingredients until batter firmed up (so to speak). Also I made pecan topping for the pancake. Simply melt a tablespoon of butter in a skillet on medium/high heat add pecans, 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon and brown sugar, and a pinch of salt. Keep the pecans moving so they don't stick or burn for about 3 minutes.

I made these as written, they are a good way to use up sweet potatoes and a change of pancake type. They were dense but did cook all the way through (read other reviews.) I cooked them slowly to make sure they cooked through. Can taste the nutmeg pretty strongly. Couldn't actually taste much sweet potato though. Next time I would find a way to make them fluffier- buttermilk or separate eggs and whip the whites. And, cut the nutmeg and add cinnamon. But, a good way to add some extra fiber and health to pancakes!

Changed the flour out to 1 cup AP flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. Also added 2 tbl. wheat germ and 1/4 cup sugar since we'll be eating these plain. Only 1/4 tsp nutmeg, too. Ended up adding 1.25 cups mashed sweet potato, maybe could do more? Yummy.

Absolutely fabulous! Like others though I used canned sweet potatoes in syrup (when little ones wake up at 6am it's just easier on me) added 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ground ginger and 1/4 tsp freshly ground nutmeg. I've cooked these quite a few times both with pumpkin and with the sweet potatoes and my family LOVES them!! In half the pancakes I like to add slivered almonds or pecans too. Thanks so much for sharing this!!

They were just OK. My main problem with these is that although they were well browned on the outside, the inside was soggy. Maybe you have to make them real small. The other thing is you really don't taste the sweet potato too much. It's a shame because I thought these would be tastier and healthier than regular pancakes.

These were fantastic.  I don't regularly mash potatoes so I did have a little trouble.  After 15 minutes the potatoes seemed tender, but when I began to cut them up and mash them I found the middles were still very hard.  I put the half-mash into the microwave for about 30 seconds which helped some.  Still, my mash ended up awfully chunky.  Made for an interesting texture though and everyone still loved them!  The whole house thought I was baking cookies from the scents wafting through the air.

What a GREAT use of potatoes.  I used yams instead of sweet potatoes (because that's what I had).  My children are DEMANDING "more pancakes mommy!"  I will definitely make these again.

I was so looking forward to these pancakes as they sounded so good.  I found them tasteless and not worth the time it took to make them.  Even tried them without syrup and could not taste the sweet potato!

So good!  Next time I'll add a little sugar to the batter to sweeten them up a bit.

Words can't explain how great these are! Since I like my sweet potatoes with brown sugar and cinnamon, I cut back on the nutmeg and added the brown sugar to the potato mixture and cinnamon to the flour. My three year old asks for them almost daily! I always keep some in the freezer.

I really enjoyed this recipe! (In reality I'd give it a 4.5 - I need to tinker with it just a bit to make it perfect for my taste.) I did add some vanilla (a liitle less than a teaspoon), and replaced half of the flour with whole wheat pastry flour.  They were no harder to make than any other pancake but were of course much more flavorful.

-Just a quick note to the naysayers:  If your pancakes came out doughy, you probably made them too big.  A couple of tablespoons is all it takes.  If they came out too dense, your batter was probably too thick.  Check the consistency and add more milk if necessary.  You will have small pancakes but they  will  be fluffy and delicious!

I cheated a bit on this recipe and used leftover sweet potatoes that I had already made up from the previous night's sweet potato side dish from dinner. They still turned out nicely! I wrecked the first few by making them too large. Follow the recipe when it says, "spoon heaping tablespoonsfuls onto the heated griddle"!! A yummy way to use up leftovers.

Hearty change from my favorite old fashion regular pancake.  Used canned sweet potato (about 1 1/2 cup mashed), added vanilla and cinnamon as suggested in earlier posts.  Reduced flour 1/4 cup and added 1/3 quinoa flakes to increase protein and iron a bit.
Makes about 32 silver dollar size pancakes.   Four pancakes are an adequate portion  so will freeze the leftovers for later use.

I think these would have been very good if they had cooked through! I made them as the recipe states and was not able to cook them enough so that the centers weren't doughy. I turned the heat down to low and squished a few really flat and was able to get something edible, however they were more like sweet potato flat cakes at that point...

I will be looking for other recipes and seeing if I can get a sweet potato pancake to turn out.

I absolutely loved this recipe except I couldn't get the pancakes to cook all the way through no matter all long I kept them on the griddle. I tried spooning smaller portions but the center was still doughy. Any ideas on why this could have happened?

These were delicious and much like pumpkin pancakes. I made a few alterations, as previous posters recommended. I cut the nutmeg in half, added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 cup crushed walnuts and used applesauce instead of butter. I recommend smoothing these out so they are thin, as my four were a little too thick and gooey in the middle. I also microwaved the sweet potatoes for 10 minutes to cut down on prep time. Yummy! Will definitely make again!

I loved these!  They have just the right amount of spice and are a great way to use up leftover sweet potato.  Thanks for sharing this recipe- I will be making them again as soon as I have some sweet potato around. Yum!

Taste was fantastic. I added a teaspoon of Pumpkin Pie spice. I ended up having to add more milk to thin it out a tad because the first one was too thick and burned. Over all very good, nice way to use sweet potatoes.

Great recipe.  I peeled the sweet potatoes before boiling, just because that seem easier IMO.  Also, to suit our tastes, I decreased the nutmeg to 1/4 t, and added in a 1/4 t of cinammon.  This recipe made 13 pancakes for me--I guess I must make them a little big.

This was fantastic! I did some modifications, but couldn't have done it without the initial recipe. Since I have to eat low fat, I replaced the butter with plain greek yogurt (nonfat), and used 1/2 cup oats for 1/2 cup of the flour. I also added 1 tbs pumpkin pie spice instead of the nutmeg. 

When cooking, if the batter is thick just spread it out with the back of a spoon or ladle.

I thought I'd try this once because my son and husband love sweet potatoes, but I loved it myself! I'm not a big pancake person, but this fixes everything wrong with pancakes. They're fluffy without tasting like flour. I did make a couple of changes though.

I used 2T butter, an extra splash of milk, and added 1/2 t. cinnamon. I'd probably cut back just a little on the nutmeg next time. I also cooked my sweet potato in the microwave, we have a potato button that has never failed me.

Delicious! I predict this becoming a family favorite for years to come!

The first time I made these I dyslexed the recipe and put in 1.5 lbs of sweet potatoes, but they came out great!   This time I followed the instructions and they came out light and soft and pancakey. Fantastic!  I like them with a slab of butter and some white sugar.

I really enjoyed these pancakes. They didn't come out as sweet as I had hoped, so I compensated with a dollop of whipped cream. That did the trick!

Use one up mashed sweet potatoes (canned or fresh would work fine). I used only a dash of nutmeg and added some cinnamon. Vanilla would also be a good addition. Very tasty and fluffy pancakes. Delicious fall treat!

YUM! Cut nutmeg in half bc I don't like it as much, added cinnamon and a couple tbsp sugar, as recommended by others. Left the batter in the fridge over night (def tasted better the next day). Before cooking, added milk to thin it out until it was spreadable, prob 1/2 a cup more. The batter tasted salty, but the pancakes did not. So don't dismiss salty batter! Cooked smallish, thin pancakes on low heat, didn't have any burning or mush issues, but they do take some time. Also - left little lumps of sweet potato (not well mashed) and I was glad I did, it added a nice texture! Served with Blueberry Breakfast Sauce from this site. Next time we'll eat them with cream cheese and honey.

Pretty good.  They don't take long to cook once the mix is made.  They seem firmer and easier to flip than a traditional pancake.  Nice change of pace for a pancake.  Will repeat.

A great recipe!  WE LOVE IT!  Kids said it tasted like pumpkin pie pancakes!  The only thing I changed was to add a big teaspoon of cinnamon to the mix.  We are big fans of butter so we didn't even cut it back.

Made these for a Thanksgiving dinner side dish, hoping my kids would eat some "vegetables".  What a hit!  I used canned yams, drained, whipped them up in the food processor, then added each ingredient and blended well.  Easy to and fun make, and the whole family loved it!  Had leftover batter and made for breakfast the next morning.  Will DEFINITELY make again!

Our new favorite pancakes - melt-in-your-mouth amazing!  Even my sister, who hates sweet potatoes, loves and even craves these pancakes now (especially with Cinnamon Cream Syrup)!

I really liked these!  They do come out a little cakey, but I like them like that.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and added vanilla, cinnamon, and 1 packet of artificial sweetener.  The nutmeg was a little overwhelming and I couldn't taste the sweet potatoes, so I think next time I'll cut back on the nutmeg.

I made these with modifications: 
started with 1 cup leftover mashed sweet potato, 
subbed 1 and 1/4 cup whole wheat flour for the flour, 
added 1/2 cup of milk for the consistency, 
subbed vegetable oil for butter because I realized I forgot it after I started cooking the pancakes, 
added 1 heaping tablespoon of sugar, added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, 
and added 1/4 cup of flaxseed meal to add some hidden fiber.  They smelled awesome and tasted great...although I didn't really taste the potato very strongly.

If Fall could have a flavor, this would be it! I added 1/4 c. brown sugar, which was plenty, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. vanilla, and then 1 T. ground flaxseed (just because flaxseed is supposed to be so healthy for you and you can add it to recipes and not even tell it's in there)Make sure when they're cooking that you flatten out the batter (it's rather thick) so that the middle of the pancake gets cooked.  Very, very good-thanks for sharing!

I agree with previous reviewers who said that they recipe needed more sugar. I also added some cinnamon, and think vanilla extract would have been good.  It tasted kind of like an incredibly dense, heavy, and thick pancake.

These were very good, but extremely salty! I'm going to halve or quarter the salt next time. I also added some cinnamon, but maybe I'll add some allspice next time too. Good recipe.

I would give this 3 1/2 stars if I could. I felt it was a bit too much nutmeg-maybe just 1/4 tsp. next time and add cinnamon. I also felt the baking powder  taste was too strong (maybe cut back 1 tsp next time). I used white whole wheat flour and just microwaved the potatoes. Also added some vanilla. Great for trying to get a toddler to eat vegetables. Especially since there is no sugar in them. I will definitely try again with some more modifications!

These were good.  As per other reviews I peeled, chopped, then boiled the sweet potato.  I weighed it, ended up using 1 medium sweet potato, and my batter was a great consistency.  I also spiced it up: pinch ginger, 1/2 ts nutmeg, 1 ts cinnamon.  I subbed 2tb canola oil for the butter, and it worked wonderfully.  My 5 year old said he could tell he was eating his veggies (after I told him what the orange was), but the addition of a few frozen blueberries made them perfect for him.

I used previous reviewers suggestions and added a little vanilla and cinnamon to the batter, doubled the recipe and make a whole stack of these for a party.  They were a big, big hit. Everyone wanted the recipe.  One gentle replied - oh, it's probably one of those secret family recipes!

Recipe is OK as written, but I found they needed more spice than just a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg (and I used fresh).  I tossed in a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and a pinch of ginger to what was left in the batch - very complex and satisfying!

I was tired of squash and bought a big yam and used this recipe. Normally, potato pancakes are my "thing" but I tried this recipe anyway. WOW. If yams are in season, this is my new recipe. I did everything according to the directions, but did cut back on the nutmeg by about 10%. Extreemly good. You'll like it.

I replaced the milk with buttermilk, and since I was making these for three teenage boys I added....
1 tablespoons cinnamon
1.5 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoons vanilla extract

They came back for seconds and thirds, so they were a hit!

This is such a good recipe i did however add cinnamon and brown sugar to the mix because i like to eat them plain. Adding the sugar makes it sweet enough to eat without syrup or anything.

I really liked these. We all thought they were the best pancakes I ever made. I partially subbed whole wheat flour and added spices and sugars. I used two leftover baked sweet potatoes I had already. I did not have a problem with a doughy consistency. I used another reviewer's suggestion of spreading out the batter in the pan with the back of a spoon. I had more success making them smaller rather than larger.

I followed this recipe to a T. The end result: there is waaaay too much baking powder in this recipe. Even after I put honey AND maple syrup on it, all I could taste was the baking powder, more so than the sweet potato. 
I like the idea of a sweet potato pancake, and I'm going to continue looking for a recipe.

I loved these! They were actually the best, most mouth-watering pancakes I've ever eaten! I halved the recipe, I didn't have any nutmeg so I didn't add that and I added 1/4 tsp of Allspice, 1 tsp of cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract. Also, I used canned sweet potatoes (not the kind that come pre-seasoned) and they still tasted amazing! The batter is very thick so I smoothed them onto the griddle with the back of a measuring cup. And I topped them with homemade streusel topping! I will DEFINITELY be making these again!

These were delicious. They weren't great the first time I made them but that was my fault; I added too much sweet potato. Follow the measurements and you should be fine. I made a few variations my second time: I added cinnamon, vanilla extract, and pecans. The pecans add an amazing touch. Even better when topped with honey!

We had leftover baked sweet potatoes, I'm so glad I found this recipe so I could use them up!  I shredded them instead of mashing.  Then we had some light coconut milk to use up, about 3/4 cup.  So I substituted some of that for regular milk.  Then added cinnamon and vanilla as other reviewers suggested, and cut back on the butter.  Heavenly!  Who needs syrup, these are great plain.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I did alter a little because my batter was super thick.  Added another 1/4 milk, 1/2t vanilla and some cinnamon.  Thanks for  sharing!

Wow! My new go-to pancake recipe! Used my mixer for the wet ingredients. Then added dry to that. So moist and flavorful. Off to go enjoy mine now that kids are filled up! thanks!

It is tuff to beat our homemade buttermilk pancake recipe, but these come really close!! My family loved them.  I substituted buttermilk for the milk (had to add a bit more), which made them a great alternative, especially in the fall & winter months!

I made this recipe as it was presented. It was really good! However, next time I think I'll add a little something extra to it because I felt like something was missing. Thanks, Swizzlesticks! Your recipe came on time when I was looking for something different. :-D

I was a little disappointed in these.  It got good reviews and I love sweet potatoes but they were pretty much flavorless.  After we added maple syrup they were a little better but not worth the work.  I'm undecided on whether or not I'll give them another try but most likely I'll just make regular pancakes and add some spices to the batter.

Absolutely phenomenal. I made it just as directed except half the butter and they were perfect. Drizzled a little honey on top and it was about the best pancake I've ever had (granted I'm a big sweet potato fan).

I overdosed on these they were so good. Except I already had sweet potato puree on hand so I didn't have to boil the potatoes. I cut the amount of nutmeg in half and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Also, I had to put the stove heat at 4 (medium low) at medium high they would have burnt to a crisp. Ate the pancakes with butter and powdered sugar on top - YUM!

I had Sweet Potato Pancakes recently at a Bed & Breakfast and wanted to try making them on my own. Mine didn't come out as fluffy as those we had before, but I think it's because my sweet potatoes didn't cook soft enough (which I discovered all too late for compensating). I had better luck with using the microwave for about 9 minutes than I did with boiling the sweet potatoes for 15-20 minutes.  I had hoped to make several batches of this recipe so I could use up the 2.5 lbs of sweet potatoes I had, but one batch turned out to be so many pancakes that I didn't keep going. Since we do Weight Watchers, I needed to know how many pieces would be in 1 serving... I measured them onto the griddle using a Tablespoon and ended up with 41 small pancakes! So each serving is basically about 5 pancakes if there are 8 servings according to the recipe. I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and subbed 1/2 c. Oat Bran in for 1/2 c. of the flour.  It took way more than 25 min for me to make these though... more like 2 hrs from start (boiling water) to finish. I usually have a steep learning curve with recipes though, so hopefully next time will be quicker. I plan to freeze the remainder of my batch.

anything my picky 4 yr old will eat gets 5 stars. I had pureed sweet potatoe in the freezer, which I'm not sure how much, about a cup, I cut the recipe in half and added vanilla and apple pie spice since I had no nutmeg. These were super moist and so yummy! I will make these again, maybe trying pumpkin next time

AWESOME!! The kids ate them and they love regular buttermilk pancakes.  The only thing I would change is to add more milk, I thinned the batter so they cooked all the way through. (my husband hates mushey pancakes)

Very good. These have a deep nutty flavor and aren't very sweet. If eating for breakfast pancakes, you may want to add a tablespoon of brown sugar to the batter, but we liked them the way they are. We plan to have some for lunch toasted with butter and parmesan.

Tastey.  What a good use for leftover Thanksgiving sweet potatoes!  I added more milk as necessary.  Tried with and without a little added vanilla extract.  It was good either way.  We served with a little powdered sugar and maple syrup.  I also added some sliced bananas to my plate.

These were pretty good.  Will probably make again.  The only modifications I'd make: this time I used nonfat milk.  Next time I'd use at least 2%.  That was my own fault.  They were a little dull with the nonfat.  As for changing the original recipe, I think next time I'll add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the mix!

These pancakes were a big hit with my 14 month old! I did use 1/2 c oats in place of some of the flour, a little less butter, and added cinnamon and vanilla, as others had suggested. Delicious, tasty and healthy!

My kids have been eating two to four 1/4 c. sized pancakes for breakfast for the past 2 months, about 5 times a week.  I like that they start the day with some veggies.  They take a long time to cook, but I transfer them to a cooling rack when they come off the griddle so they stay a little crispy, then I freeze them and they pull out what they want to toast in the morning.

SO delicious!  Made half recipe ahead of time about 15 minutes in order to allow wet and dry to combine properly.  This yielded the most wonderful, fluffy creamy orange pancakes I've ever tasted, with just a hint of sweet potato flavor.  A great way to get kids to eat their veggies and ask for more.  I also took advice of another reviewer and added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  May add another 1/4 c flour to make 1 c next time, as I prefer cakier pancakes.  To die for!

Made these without telling the picky 8 year old visiting our house what was "in" them.  Plate returned to the kitchen wiped clean, with the exclamation, "These are the best pancakes I ever had!" 'Nuff said.

My husband and I LOVE THESE!  We had sweet potato pancakes at a restaraunt on a roadtrip once, and I've been searching for a recipe like it.  This is even better.  We top ours with cinnamon and agave! Beats all other pancakes!

I think these are fantastic!  I used 2 cups mashed sweet potatoes and they were the perfect consistency.  You have to cook them longer at a low temp or they don't seem done in the middle.

I didn't really follow the recipe exactly.  However, I got the idea to add sweet potato to pancakes from this recipe and it was fabulous!  I just added about 2 1/2 cups of cooked/mashed sweet potato to 3 cups Krusteaz Buttermilk Pancake Mix, and 2 1/4 cups water.  I also added about 1 cup of water to the sweet potato so that is it more of a creamy consistency.  Then I just cooked them on my griddle at about 350*.  They were so good!  My husband went back for seconds, which he never does when I make pancakes! And my 3 year old cleaned his plate of the 2 large pancakes that I served for him!  We will definately be eating these again!

These are awesome made with leftover sweet potatoes from Thanksgiving.  Fabulous topped with leftover cranberries.  I'll have to make another batch, because husband and son ate each one as it came hot off the griddle - just as they were.  

My son said they taste like pumpkin donuts (I always add brown sugar, Marshmallows and Cinnamon to my Thanksgiving Sweet Potatoes).  

Just weigh out the leftover sweet potatoes and follow the recipe.  Try topping The resulting fluffy and delicious pancakes with cranberries, a dollop of vanilla yogurt or sour cream and roasted pecans.

Im giving this 5 stars for the taste and 4 stars for the effort/time. Between cooking the sweet potatoes (15 min in the microwave) and then cooking MANY batches of the dollar sized pancakes which took MUCH longer than a regular pancake to cook all the way through, THANK GOD the end result was worth it. Lots of healthy pancakes I can freeze and pop in the toaster for my toddler. 
I made the following changes: 
1 cup flour and 1/2 cup oats
1/2 tsp vanilla
1-2 TBS maple syrup for some sweetness
1/4 tsp nutmeg
1/2 tsp cinnamon
only 2 TBS butter
Will make again, just when I have lots more time :)

I had leftover mashed sweet potatoes from dinner the night before and found this recipe to use them up. From now on, I will be making extra sweet potatoes just to make these pancakes. They are so yummy! My kids all loved them and I felt good giving them an extra nutritional boost before school!

Yammy pancakes, Is what were calling them.  Added 1.4 cup brown sugar to sweeten them up a bit, and used pumpkin spice blend in place of all the spices.  Added 1 more cup of milk for consistancy, and found that we had to cook them extra slow and long on LOW LOW heat, keeping them from burning.  We also had 1/2 and 1/2 of sweet potatoes, and new red potatoes.  It was a sweet blend.  My 3 year old has eaten the whole plate of left overs today!

My whole family liked these sweet potato pancakes. I served them for dinner. I baked yams instead of boiling, it seemed to bring out their sweeter taste. I wonder if it called for too much flour in the recipe though. It seemed like I could definitely taste the flour. I will try to add less next time but will definitely make them again.

I loved this recipe.  I did however make my own modifications.  I read the other reviews and reduced the nutmeg to 1/4 tsp, added a 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla.  I also put in a dash of ground cloves.  Also, I used Egg Nog instead of the Milk.  Well, technically, I used Soy Nog, but I know thats not everyones cup of milk.  Also, I had to add more Nog when I mixed the wet batter into the dry batter because it was more like a dough than a batter.  Other than that it was unbelievable.

Wow, these were amazing.  I prepared the batter the day before Thanksgiving, then on Thanksgiving morning I made them for my family that was visiting.  Everyone loved them so much!  I know some reviewers already mentioned this but just remember not to try to make them too big and to spread the batter out some, otherwise the insides will be gooey!

Very bland and lumpy. I do want to try these one more time, but I think I will use the brown sugar in another's comments for more sweetness and will cook my potato ALOT longer to get the smoother consistency.UPDATE: my 3 yr old son ate quite a bit, but I added vanilla and sugar as the other reviews suggested. I think next time I will try more sweet potatoes and cook them longer so they are not so lumpy.

These are very good.  All of my children ate these.  Even the picky, picky ones.  On several of these I put down some chopped pecans, then some brown sugar, and then the  batter.  That made it so yummy.  I did put some sugar in my batter.  Next time I will put some cinnamon in my pancakes.  It is good with   just the nutmeg though.   My husband kept saying how moist these were.

I loved these pancakes, but unfortuanatly, my 2 yr old didn't.  The only complaint I have is that they didn't seem to cook in the middle, no matter how long I kept them on the griddle, but that could be due to a mistake by me.  Thanks for this healthy creative twist on pancakes!

Delicious! I added 2 Tbsp of sugar to the dry ingredients and it was just right to eat the pancakes alone, no syrup necessary! Great for freezing as well, for a quick breakfast just microwave them!

This was ok.  Even after spicing up the recipe quite a bit it was still just ok.  I didn't mash the sweet potatoes up enough (my error not the recipe).  Hubby loved them especially the ones I added pecans to.  I'm a tough rater so for me to give it a four is pretty decent.  A five is only for recipes that I deem incredible!  They were tasty enough.  I'll probably try them again when I have cinnamon.

Pancakes were ok but I will not make again. I had to microwave the potatoe after boiling it as it was not soft enough. Must use mixer, otherwise lumpy if handmixed.

Very tasty. I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose. Also used 1/4 t. of nutmeg and 1/4 t. of cinnamon and added a little vanilla. Added a little more milk part way though as well because batter was getting too thick. Very similar to pumpkin pancakes we like.

What did I do wrong?  I really liked the taste of these but they were very doughy and not light and fluffy.  I used canned sweet potatoes that I mashed and weighed out - perhaps I used too much?  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, I'd like to make these again.

My 18 mon. old grandson and I LOVED these pancakes!  I only had one sweet potato so I cut every thing in half but we ate them for lunch the first day and breakfast the second day.  I will make them often, thanks.

These were wonderful!  We aren't big sweet potato eaters but I am always looking for ways to sneak in vegetables. The sweet potato flavor wasn't overpowering and our 12 and 5 year olds liked them!  I did add a splash of vanilla. I doubled the recipe but that was WAY too much even for the four of us!  Thank you!

I specifically didn't want an overly "sweet" result, so I added garlic powder, smoked paprika, chives, black pepper and cayenne. I omitted the nutmeg and used cinnamon instead. I decreased the flour and milk to 1 cup of each and the butter to 2 TBSP. I agree with the person who said it was hard to cook these all the way through without the middle being gooey (while the outside overcooked). I resolved this by taking them off the griddle sooner but placing in a 250 degree oven while I continued frying patches. The additional cooking time in the oven seemed to help. I served with butter and habanero-strawberry pepper jelly. I liked the result quite a lot, my housemate said it was just OK. I think he didn't care for one of the spices I put in but he was unable to identify the culprit. I also used one cup of mashed sweet potatoes, like another cook on here said, which I already had left over and which worked with these proportions, adjusted as I noted. (I think it would have had even less sweet potato taste if I had used the full amount of flour, milk and butter. It was fairly subtle anyway.) The main reason I looked up recipes - to use up leftover mashed sweet potato. I don't think I would bother to do this from scratch though.

Delicious, fluffy and not difficult.  I microwaved my sweet potatoes and scooped out the hot innards with a spoon, mashed them by hand with a potato masher, added the milk and mashed them more to cool down before adding the eggs.  Sifted dry ingredients onto wax paper and mixed them into the bowl.  I agreed with the other comments about cinnamon and ginger and vanilla rather than nutmeg, but that is personal preference.  I absolutely WILL make these again!

They are absolutely delicious and easy to make. I cooked the sweet potatoes the night before to make it easier in the morning. Also I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg because I didnt have any. My toddler loved them as well. Yum!

Tasty, and cuts down on the sugar. I do enjoy these pancakes, however they are VERY time consuming. I must have spent 2 hours on these, boiling the sweet potatoes, melting the butter, mixing everything, and on top of all that cook time. These are really delicous, but they're not a fast and easy breakfast.

I used pumpkin pie spice instead of nutmeg and doubled the amount of spice. Good tasting. Not especially fluffy but not doughy either. Tasty with butter and maple syrup. Will make again I'm sure.

Real tasty.   I added more nutmeg.   My inexpensive waffle  iron didn't like the thickness of the batter.   So I used the griddle. 

I like the sweet potato  pancakes. Better than regular pancakes.

These are so good! I used almond milk, and ended up stirring in at least an extra 1/2 cup to get a consistency I liked. I also added vanilla and used pumpkin pie spice instead of just nutmeg. I topped the pancakes with walnuts before turning and served with butter and a sprinkle of brown sugar (was out of syrup!).  These will def be going into regular rotation at our house!

Uber delicious. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added a bit more milk to the batter so it spread more easily. The consistency was similar to biscuit dough at first but once it hit the griddle, all was fine. Definitely going to make these again.

These were very good but I used fresh grated nutmeg and 1/2 t was too much.  I will reduce it to 1/4 t next time and add 1/4 t cinnamon.  I used almond milk instead of milk and 1 large left over baked sweet potato (which simplified the process a lot) Plus I think baked are sweeter than boiled.  The taste was sweet enough I don't think the recipe needs any added sugar.

I've made a lot of pancakes, I would not make these again. 
IF I were to try I would probably halve the sweet potato. I used 1 cup (as many others noted) and the inside never cooked past mashed potato consistency.

I didn't like this recipe much. Like another reviewer no matter what I did the middles were always a little gooey.  I did add some sugar, cinnamon,  vanilla, and less nutmeg. But after tasting the first one I had to add more sugar , vanilla, and cinnamon because the flavor was not good.

I made this recipe for Chanukkah and they were delicious and less greasy than the typical potato latkes. I made changes that others recommended: eliminated the nutmeg and replaced with cinnamon. I added a tsp of vanilla and a tsp of brown sugar. I decreased the butter to 2 TBS and decreased the salt to half a tsp. I microwaved one large and one medium sweet potato for 12 minutes then scooped out the potato from the skin. I let the batter sit for 2 hours in the fridge. Dropping the batter onto the griddle was tricky as it was very sticky. When it was time to flip the pancake, I flipped and then flattened them out with the spatula so they cooked evenly and there was no gooey middles. My husband and I gobbled them up and I froze leftover pancakes to eat for breakfast.

Agree with other reviewers that it is hard to cook without the middle being gooey. I think the taste is good. The nutmeg goes well with the sweet potato, though. I bet pumpkin spice would be a good spice to add as well.

This is a good base for a great recipe. I add SO MUCH to make it better (thus the 4 stars). I make this like my sweet potato pie, adding spices to taste. I probably add about 1/2-1 tsp of: cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, cardamom, pumpkin pie spice, all spice. I also add about 1/4 cup brown sugar, sometimes a little white. Sometimes I’ll throw a tsp if vanilla in. Pecans are excellent as are chocolate chips. I know it’s terrible to be so open with a recipe, but like I said, it’s a good base and one should adjust to taste.

Delicious, thank you! I boiled the whole sweet potato the night before, removed skins and mashed then left in fridge til the morning. I also added dash of vanilla extract and cinnamon to the batter. Served with ghee, maple syrup, banana, and whip cream :)

We absolutely love this recipe.  I use half whole wheat flour and sometimes substitute part of the butter with coconut oil.  The nutmeg adds a subtle flair.  Thanks so much!

As the recipe stands, these make pancakes that are like mush in the middle. Also, the sweet potatoes honesty need 25-30 minutes to boil as they were still hard in the middle when I took them out, so I sliced them up and baked them in aluminum foil to make them softer. The Test pancake I made was gooey and you could barely taste the sweet potato.

I ended up adding 1 additional cup of flour, an extra 3 teaspoons of baking powder, 1 extra teaspoon of nutmeg and added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and  2 tablespoons of sugar. 
The extra flour and baking soda made thick, fluffy pancakes whereas originally they were too chewy on the outside. The spices added a yummy holiday taste. Adding all these extras saved the pancakes, but I compromised the flavor of "sweet potato" for  the sake of turning out decent.
I'll be looking elsewhere for a good Sweet Potato Pancake recipe.

Never cooked in the middle. Altered the recipe a dozen times before we got edible pancakes. Added milk to thin it out thinking that it would cook (literally had it less than 1/8 inch thick) then added a ton of flour and baking powder until the pancakes were edible. Not sure why it was so bad!

Made twice now. A complete waste of time and ingredients! Will not cook through...Even low and slow in the pan burns the outside before the center even begins cooking. Tried spreading them thin and baking them and they baked for over a half hour...Black on the edges and gooey in the center. So disappointed.

It was difficult to cook, even if spread thin. It remained gummy.  I only made it to use up sweet potatoes.  I did add 3/4 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I kept the nutmeg same, and it was not overpowering for our taste.   
Likely will not make again

I did not make any alterations to the recipe-as one reviewer suggested I used 1 cup mashed sweet potatoes  since I didn't have a scale.  They turned out  nice-I used fresh white sweet potatoes and the flavor was subtle but there.  They were more moist than traditional pancakes, so don't stack them too high before serving or the lower ones will be flat.  
These paired really well with some butter cream syrup.

Can't  give it a five as is....but my tweaks make it a 5star. I read other reviews and then..... I used whole wheat pastry flour, half n half plus extra splash milk to thin batter as it sat and thickened. Added 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. Measured out batter in 1/4 cup scoops and spread it out on hot griddle....cooked up nice.   Came out yummy. Leftovers to be frozen for a quick breakfast.

These pancakes were really quite tasty -- I didn't have quite the amount of sweet potatoes the recipe called for, but they were still good.  Next time, I will make sure I have enough sweets on hand.  Just load these babies up with warm maple syrup or honey...and that's good eatin'.

Made these this morning for breakfast and topped them with chopped roasted pecans and real maple syrup. They ere light, fluffy and delicious. We had quite a bit of extra batter so I'm looking to having them again after reading one of the other reviews that said they tasted even better and more like sweet potato the next day. The only thing I might do differently next time would be to add a little pumpkin pie spice with the nutmeg.

I used Korean sweet potatoes, which are not as sweet as sweet potatoes in the US and yellow instead of orange, and it turned out great! I used cinnamon and ginger instead of nutmeg, because I didn't have any nutmeg. I also added vanilla and oats. So good!

This was great. I boiled the potatos peeled and cut up. Then drained them and mixed them with the butter to melt the butter. I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon in addition to the nutmeg. Makes a great

I reduced recipe to 4 servings (1 egg) and it was good for 2 as the main brunch/breakfast. I added 2 T brown sugar, and likely used closer to 8 oz of sweet potato than 6 oz. I substituted allspice for nutmeg, and would put roasted, chopped pecans in the warmed maple syrup, or caramelized pecans sprinkled over the pancakes.

Me and my husband both loved them! I didn't have nutmeg and used cinnamon instead and they kind of tasted like French toast. I would definitely make them again.

I loved making this with a few minor adjustments. You ca definitely make this vegan and it still tastes great!! I used egg re placers for the eggs and I used vegan butter and cashew or almond milk. I also added more nutmeg, cinnamon, almond essence and vanilla extract  and a TBLSpoon of raw sugar came out tasting like a pie!!! Also use a blender instead of mashing it creates a smoother texture and no sweet potato lumps.

I too could not get these pancakes to cook through. I even pressed a couple small ones as thin as possible and cooked each side for 5 minutes and the inside was still completely gooey. I'm not an experienced cook by any means, this is one of the first from scratch recipes I've tried, so I'm not sure how to fix it. The batter smelled great and the edges were wonderful. But most of the pancake was just goo. Disappointing for sure.

There were a hit in my house.  I used unsweetened almond milk instead of milk.  I sub'd 1/2 cup of flour with oat bran, and the other cup was whole wheat pastry flour.  I added some vanilla powder (vanilla extract will also work).  And I tossed in a handful of chopped toasted pecans.  

They are delicious topped with almond butter and a little drizzle of maple syrup.

I am going to try the oats, vanilla & cinnamon suggestions. I was surprised the vanilla and cinnamon weren't already in the recipe so it makes sense. These turned out wonderful. I supposed the people who had issues with the texture coming out right might have used too much sweet potato. I didn't feel like measuring 3/4 lbs so I just use one sweet potato each time. I peel it first, then slice into large cubes and steam until tender. Then, I just throw everything into a blender. I save it up in a glass jar and have enough for ~3 breakfasts for the week (1 adult and one small child/~5-6 servings). I do small 2in pancakes for my son and regular sized for my husband.

Great recipe! I gave it four stars only because I added three little ingredients, 1 1/2 tbsp sugar, 1 TSP cinnamon, 2tsp vanilla. Super yum!!! Oh and p.s. I used a rounded cup of sweet potatoes.

The dough was a little thicker than typical for pancakes, but I kept that in mind when I cooked them, and they were delicious. I didn't measure the exact amount of sweet potato; I just used a nice sized sweet potato. I also added about tablespoon of sugar, though the recipe didn't ask for it. I loved them.

First timer, followed the recipe mostly with minor changes. Subbed 1/2  cup of the flour for 1/2 cup quick oats; subbed 1 cup of the milk for almond milk (so 1 cup almond, 1/2 cup 2%); added about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, no nutmeg and a dash of sugar and vanilla extract. Next time, ill use less salt, more vanilla extract, more cinnamon, puree the potatoes and sub butter for coconut oil for flavor. They were pretty good...very dense but delish!

Following the comments I made changes plus I am very calorie contentious.  I used 1 cup ww flour & 1/2 cup oats, cinnamon instead of nutmeg, plus I used a 1/4 cup egg whites instead of butter.  There was also a recommendation to let sit overnight so I mixed all but the egg whites (including the whites from the 2 eggs) and let sit in fridge overnight.  In the morning I beat whites to peaks and folded in right before cooking.  Very yummy. Not overly sweet which I thought they might be.

Delicious! I used about 2 1/2 cups mashed sweet potato  (2-3 sweet potatoes). Decreased butter to 2 Tbls. Decreased nutmeg to 1/4 tsp. Added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla. Everyone loved it with maple applesauce on top!

Followed this recipe exactly and the batter was too thick and pancakes came out raw on the inside...so added more milk to thin the batter, and again the pancakes came out raw..... Was unable to get these pancakes to rise and be fluffy pancakes.   This recipe needed too  much tweeting and I was never able to have edible pancakes.  Also, tasted too strongly of baking soda. This recipe is bad and I wasted  two good sweet potatoes...

Maybe this recipe didn't turn out so well for me because I didn't blend the sweet potato/milk/egg/butter mixture into the dry mixture, but rather mixed it in with a spoon... and because I wasn't sure how to measure out 3/4 lbs of sweet potatoes....My batter felt super heavy and the pancakes burnt easily at even medium heat, so I had to spread the batter out and turn the heat down. I will most likely not use this recipe again.

These were ok but would need modifications to make them great. The batter suffered from not being sweet; it required more syrup than I usually like which drowned out the sweet potato flavor. Also it was tricky to cook long enough without burning.  I don't think there will be a next time but if this is your first time I'd recommend another egg and a couple tablespoons of brown sugar.

It was way too thick, but I tried frying some up anyway.  the pancakes were raw inside and it took twice as long to get the outsides hard enough to flip. I turned down the heat and let the next one cook a little longer (low and slow) with a top on the frying pan, and they were still raw and the outsides were starting to burn. 
I added more milk to make the batter pourable, 1/4 cup at a time.  I probably added intotal 1 full cup extra until it resembled regular pancake batter in look and viscosity: still raw pancakes. I added some baking soda. The pancakes now seemed to rise and exhibited the air bubble popping to denote doneness: still raw. So instead of wasting more pancake batter, I added flour and honey to the batter and tried to make mini muffins with it. After 30 minutes at 350 degrees, they were still raw. Not sure what happened with this batter but I'm going to try a different recipe next time.

Added a bit of vanilla to the wet ingredients (1/2 teaspoon). Added steamed kale to sweet potatoes. Found it way too salty. Next time I'll use 1/2 teaspoon salt. The batter was really thin. Maybe a bit more flour.

I had leftover sweet potatoes so I decided to make these pancakes.  The only thing I changed was the amount of milk.  I added a little more because my sweet potatoes were rather dry.  Other reviewers stated that their pancakes were soggy in the middle.  Mine were fine.  I spread the batter out a little and lowered the fire.  I will definitely make these pancakes again.  Next time I will add some chopped pecans.

Next time I will make this using 1 1/4 cups milk and only 2 tbs. butter. also, I only used one small sweet potato, so it needs more. the batter IMO was too thin, I prefer a thicker pancake batter which produces a thicker pancake. My son liked it more than me but didn't rave. so if we do this again will make it using those changes (less milk, less butter, more SP). also, we added sugar. we used a brown sugar butter syrup that I made with it- PERFECT. (brown sugar- water- melted butter-vanilla cooked on stove).

These pancakes weren't as fluffy as I normally like (hence the 4-star rating instead of 5), but my picky 2-year-old loved them, so I'll definitely be making them again! I do recommend adding a little more spice--maybe a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice (or blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, etc.) for a half recipe. I did use a jar of sweet potato baby food that my son outgrew before eating. This worked for a half recipe, but fresh potatoes would probably give a more intense flavor.

I made this recipe for dinner tonight mostly to use up some leftover baked sweet potatoes. The pancakes were wonderful! I misread the recipe and thought it called for 3/4 CUP of mashed sweet potatoes instead of 3/4 lb. So that's what I was planning to use, but didn't have enough sweet potatoes leftover to fill 3/4 cup. I added a little chunky homemade applesauce to round out the 3/4 cup and it worked perfectly. I also added cinnamon mostly because my toddler loves cinnamon and she was skeptical of sweet potatoes in her pancakes. She nearly ate as many as me! I loved that there was no added sugar. A little pure maple syrup for her to dip made a great addition.

Delicious and filling - great for a weekend breakfast, especially if your plans for the day involve a nap! My only issue is the timing - after 20 minutes in boiling water, my sweet potatoes still hadn't cooked all the way through enough to be mash-able. I wound up having to finish the cut up chunks in the microwave and then "mash" them with my immersion blender. But the flavor was great, so adjust the cooking time and try these!

This is the second time making these and I'm still in love,  I added a bit of heavy cream to mine to make the batter a little more rich and smooth.  This is the perfect addition to a steak and eggs breakfast.  I don't think I'll ever go back to regular pancakes, again.

Very, very wet pancakes...could be because I sift my flour, but I ended up adding more than the recipe called for, and the pancakes were still gooey in the center of many of them.  Could be because I also oven-cooked my sweet potatoes and not in the microwave, so they had more moisture?

New favorite! I substituted 1 cup while wheat flour and 1/2 cup rolled oats. They never did fully cook in the middle but they didn't taste raw. I didn't mind it at all. I also baked the sweet potatoes instead of boiling. Top it with creme fraichethat has a bit of maple syrup and cinnamon mixed in.

YUM!  First I used a non-stick pan with oil.  They really stuck to the pan.  So switched to a Revere Ware pan and used spray oil.  And flattened the pancakes a bit.  This worked like a charm.  They were so good!  Will definitely make these again.  Thanks for such a great and easy recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly and mine turned out mushy -- like eating mashed sweet potatoes with syrup on top. Not bad if you're expecting mashed sweet potatoes, but we were expecting pancakes. I won't use this recipe again.

I love making these. I do follow other's advice about cutting back the butter and nutmeg and adding vanilla and cinnamon. I also use whole wheat flour for about 1/2 to 3/4 of what the recipe calls for. Great way to sneak in veggies for the little one too (2 yr old daughter).

Yummy! I did alter it a bit - it was breakfast time and I was missing ingredients. I did the whole wheat & oatmeal combo suggested elsewhere (1 c. & 1/2 c. respectively). And then I didn't have enough milk so I used Greek yogurt mixed with milk - about 50/50. It was thick so I added more milk.  Also I had started the potatoes in the microwave (another recipe) so I finished cooking them that way. It was easy to just scoop and one less step and pan to wash. Did all the wet stuff in my mixer and then added the blended dry stuff. They did turn out very wet/dense but we thought it was a good texture.  So I don't know how it should have tasted but it was yum.

Excellent! For those that thought they didn't cook through, follow the directions. These are NOT regular pancakes! You have to use only 1/8 cup batter on med-low heat, or they will be gooey and raw. And 1.5 pounds of sw. potatoes was perfect! That's about 3 med. sized sw. potatoes. I mixed up the batter the night before and it was so easy in the morning. Delicious with pecans.

This is one of our favorite kid-friendly dinners.  We found using all whole wheat flour still tastes just as good.  Guests can't believe how good these taste with no added sugar and no white flour.

I was so excited to find this recipe. Other than peeling and cutting the sweet potatoes before boiling them, I followed the recipe as written. I loved the texture and flavor (I thought about adding cinnamon, but in the end, I'm glad I didn't; I think it would have covered the sweet potato too much). I cooked the entire batch and froze the leftovers to enjoy as a quick breakfast on weekday mornings.

I thought these were pretty good.  It wasn't a planned meal, we just had a random sweet potato on hand that I didn't have a use for.  I loved adding in a vegetable to pancakes.  I did add cinnamon & vanilla, and a little extra sugar.

These were great!  My 4 yo DD, who habitually turns up her nose at new food, loved the "Orange Halloween Pancakes", even after being told they had sweet potatoes.  DS and DH said they tasted like pumpkin pie pancakes, lol.  I added cinnamon, a little sugar, and vanilla to the mix, like so many other posters.

Had some leftover cooked sweet potatoes that I needed to use so this was super easy to put together.  I subbed whole wheat flour and forgot to put in the butter (oops!), but they still rose up and I thought they were yummy and so did the hubby.  My 11 year old was so-so on it.  Good topped with baked apples (which I also had leftover).

I also microwaved the sweet potatoes, added 1 teaspoon cinnamon instead of nutmeg, and 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  Everyone raved.  I served them with a Pecan Praline Syrup.  Everyone loved them and had several requests for the recipe. My sons even requested them for Christmas breakfast this year!

These were great! I wouldn't do the boiling thing again tho. I just throw them in the microwave. It's alot easier. Plus I used cinnamon too.

These were very dense and filling. I added a little vanilla and brown sugar. I think next time I'll use yams (for the orange color) and add chopped pecans or walnuts. We didn't have maple syrup, so my boyfriend put a little whipped cream cheese and rasberry jam on top. Yum!

I used three smallish sweet potatoes and that seemed to be about right.  I followed the recipe exactly and tast tested.  After that I added almost 1/3 cup sugar, couple dashes cinnamon and some chocolate chips to the batter.  My kids loved them. Oddly enough, they tasted a bit like french toast.  Very good and a little healthier than regular pancakes.

These were great start. I made a few modifications, by adding flax seed to the mix. They have become our standard breakfast.

A new favorite in my house! Easy to make and a different dish than regular pancakes.  To cut time I make the potato's the night before as they are the longest part of the recipe.  Yum!

These are awesome, but with a few modifications: I use 1 cup mashed sweet potatoes, add 1/4 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla. I also use the batter to make waffles instead of pancakes and they turn out great, esp. after freezing and toasting.

I wish I had read the reviews first, but I printed the recipe a while back and followed it later.  It called for no sugar and tasted like it.  The batter cooked up mushy with little taste.  It is great after doctoring up with sugar and cinnamon.

I've made this recipe 5 times now.  I always double the recipe so I could freeze extra.  They were awesome and I vowed to never make regular pancakes again.  However, the last 2 times I made them I haven't been able to get them to cook through.  I've lowered the heat on my frying pan and added extra milk to make the batter thinner.  Nothing seemed to work.  I'm  very frusterated.

Mmmm good!  I used a 14oz can of pure pureed pumpkin (about 2 cups) instead of bothering with the sweet potatoes and it turned out great!  I also added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, a little vanilla, a tbsp of sugar and 1/4 cup of wheat germ (for added nutrition) and my 14 month old and I loved it!

Unfortunately...I did not have sweet potatoes on-hand. I substituted russet potatoes. We were very impressed with the fluffiness of the pancakes and the flavor. Will try these again using sweet potatoes...but will definitely come back to regular potatoe pancakes as well. Perfect for someone looking for a low-sugar pancake recipe!

I tried this recipe in an attempt to use up the sweet potato bounty from the garden.  I followed some of the tips given by other reviewers and the pancakes came out perfect. My daughter and I loved them, hubby didn't care for them. We liked them best with a sour cream topping. Popped the leftovers in the toaster for breakfast the next morning, yummy!

This recipe provided a very easy, tasty, and healthy alternative to the boring sweet potatoes with sour cream we usually have.  I suggest cooking the potatoes in the microwave since after 20 minutes of boiling (more than the recipe requested) the middle was still very hard - I had to cook them in the microwave for an extra 15 minutes before they could be mashed.  I replaced the butter with margarine, which worked just as well and is much healthier.  Next time I'll try it with less margarine, and I'll double the recipe since we're a very hungry family of four and those pancakes disappeared very fast!  All in all, this was a great recipe.  It took me more time than I expected but next time I make it, it will probably be much faster!

I made these pancakes this morning and I did not think they were special.  I did add cinnamon, vanilla, brown sugar, and pecans.  I could not even taste the sweet potatoes.  I think I'd prefer to make regular pancakes next time.

It was a big hit for my children but my husband is used to real potato pancakes and he didn't like the sweet potato taste.  I probably would make it again if I had lots of sweet potatoes left over like I did for thanksgiving.

These weren't as hard as some of the reviews made them sound. Making them with two tablespoons full of dough was the way to go. Any bigger and they were doughy in the middle at the end. My only complaint was that they weren't sweet potato tasting enough for me. Maybe I just needed sweeter potatoes? I will definitely make these again though.

I made these for dinner at school for all the students at our Bible college in Lima, Peru. They turned out really well. I also used about 1/2 whole wheat flour.

Not what I hoped for.  The batter makes a rubbery pancake instead of a fluffy pancake.

I found these delicious but my wife and son did not like them as well.  I still give it 5 stars.

Awesome! Very light. The only change I did was to use the food processor for the wet ingredients - I found mashing a somewhat firm sweet potato cumbersome (even after boiling for 20 min).

I suppose this is a matter of personal taste. My family ate them but weren't really thrilled.

This was a good recipe. They do taste very good along with the cranberry sauce--good idea!

Best pancakes I have ever had.  I occasionally serve them for dinner with fresh cranberry sauce or for breakfast with sausage.  Very tasty.
