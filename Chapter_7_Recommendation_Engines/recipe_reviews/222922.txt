Very good starting point for Fried Green Tomatoes. I like my breading to have a bit more seasoning. But I really did enjoy this recipe, I made it just as the recipe directed. The end result was good.

This is the first time this Northern girl even tried Fried Green Tomatoes.  I found this recipe and I must say "Yum!"  I used flour instead of cornmeal as I was out and dipped the tomato slices in milk before I dipped them in my flour mixture.  I am impressed with the simplicity of this recipe.  I will definitely make again.

I realized after cooking the first few if you let the tomatoes set in the cornmeal for a few minutes and then recoat it looks like the picture!! I used creole seasoning instead of salt and pepper this recipe is great and can be seasoned many ways.

Giving this 5 stars because, it is easy to make, minimal ingredients and still tasty. A perfect start recipe for those who have never made fried green tomatoes before. Leaves tons of room for making this recipe your own! As a southern lady I have made many batches of fried green tomatoes, and this is certainly one of the best basic/start ones I have come across. Grandma would be proud.
