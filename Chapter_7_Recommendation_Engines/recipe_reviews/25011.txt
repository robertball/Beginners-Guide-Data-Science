These were good and easy to make. After reading what everyone else said about the batter being dry, I melted the butter instead of using it softened. That helped a lot.

My hubby came home quite late last night and says he needed a batch of brownies for a bake sale in the morning. Needless to say I freaked. All my brownie recipes call for 4 or more eggs. Thankfully, I found this recipe. And to think you make it out of a cake mix. Even better. I thru them together in no time. I of course had to try them before I just gave them to my hubby. Well, I only wrapped up 16, kept the other 8 for myself. He sure wasn't getting the whole batch. Not after I tasted them. Thanks a whole bunch for this time saving recipe. Definately will be making this again, plus will be passing it on to my daughter. She just loves easy brownie and cookie recipes. And this one is right up her alley.

These were pretty good in a pinch. I used regular chocolate cake mix because that all I had and wanted to bake. An old trick  my Mom taught me is to add 1 Tablespoon corn syrup to the mix. It makes a chewy brownie. I used oil as someone suggested. My brownies were a bit flatter than than usual. But they were moist. I cut back on the baking time, too.

Easy to fix and tasty.  I took the advice of another reviewer and used oil instead of butter.  The brownies were moist and great with Blue Bell ice cream!!

These are pretty good and very easy to make. The only problem I had was I found them to be a little on the dry side. If I make them again I think I will substitute oil for butter or find a cake mix that requires butter, not oil like the one I used. But please don't be discouraged from trying these are are pretty good and so easy it's worth a try!

Too dry. If I'm going to make brownies with a mix, I'd get better results with an actual brownie mix.

Daughter had a sleepover and wanted to make brownies (spur of the moment).  All I had was a yellow cake mix and chocolate chips.  We made this without nuts and increased the butter just a tad.  They were yummy!  We called them Golden Brownies.

These brownies were too dry for my liking.  I prefer something fudgier and moist.

Good recipe!  I added a little more liquid to keep them from being dry.

i started by following the posted recipe but added 3 Tbl of applesauce because i dont like useing oil but wanted to follow other comments stating that the brownies were dry. i did find that while i was mixing the batter was very thick but i put it in the oven anyways.  during the cooking process they did puff up quite a bit. i used white choloate cuse thats what i had. so they taste reat, more fluffy than a normal brownies but still awsome!!!!

VERY dry...good idea, but as is needs modifications to increase moistness.  Extra oil helps.  I also iced with German chocolate icing, so with those additions, everyone enjoyed, although still a bit dry.  This recipe needs adjustment.

Easy, and moist with a few adjustments. Used chocolate cake mix, one stick of butter, 1/4 c milk/cream, 1 egg and chips. Press into pan, top with colored sprinkles. Bake about 22 min for chewy brownie.

surprised at bedtime with news of a class party the next morning, all i had in the pantry was a chocolate cake mix and some chocolate chips.  Thank goodness i found this recipe online.  It was a real life-saver.
The results were flawless.  Thanks Michele!

I make these all of the time, in fact, we just had them at a party tonight. The mix is very dry, but the brownies turn out exellent and they are so easy. Try them topped with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. Yum!

Try adding a touch of olive oil. I'm not sure how much I used but it couldn't have been more than a tablespoon.
