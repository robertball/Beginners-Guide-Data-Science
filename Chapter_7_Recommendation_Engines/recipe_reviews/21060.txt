Yummy!  I used all of these ingredients, but assembled and baked it differently.  I sliced the loaf (1/2 loaf of Italian Herb Bread I from this site) in half lengthwise, like splitting a roll.  I spread the butter mixture on both sides, then put them together and baked, at 350 in foil for 20 minutes.  Then I added the cheese and baked the bread open-faced until the cheese melted.  Served with Chicken Milano from this site.  I used fresh oregano.  Very good- I usually make my own garlic bread but this recipe is great.  I love the olive oil addition- I had never thought of that before!

This recipe was just what I was looking for - THanks!  The only advice I have for future garlic bread makers is DON"T try to broil it on a flat pan or stone!  It works best in a deep dish, that way the oils don't drip out.

Using the finest bread from an old Italian bakery in Milwaukee certainly doesn't hurt, but this was just simply out of this world good! And attractive too!  I loved the combination of both olive oil and butter. I used a little less oregano than called for but it, too, was a nice addition. I also added some finely chopped parsley which gave it some freshness and color. Still, I think I must stress that this will only be as good as the quality of the bread you use.

This has to be one of the best garlic bread recipes on this site!  Instead of cutting it into individual slices I just cut the loaf in half and spread the mixture onto the bread.  I sprinkled some parmesan cheese instead of mozzarella and baked it at 425 for 10-12 minutes.  It was delicious!

This was very good!  I used jarred crushed garlic, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I didn't cut as indicated but cut in half and made garlic loafs.  I made a whole loaf of Italian Bread to go along with Greek Penne and Chicken, and almost the whole loaf went with our small family.  Next time I might try adding a little parmesan cheese to the bread over the garlic butter, just family preference but it is definitely not needed.  Thank you for sharing, this is definitely a keeper!!

Excellent!  I kinda thought that it would be weird to add the oil, but it really made a big difference.  I forgot that the butter was in the microwave on "warm" and it melted, but this still came out good, I just brushed it on.  I also added paprika before the cheese.  Thanks Clair!

Surely not the best I've ever had, but a solid, solid choice for a better than average garlic bread.  This taste excellent with or without the cheese.  A word to the wise; as is, you will not have enough spread to brush a full Italian loaf of bread.  If you wish to brush the entire loaf, better double the spread.  I had nice compliments on this.  The broil times advised in the recipe were accurate, though my rack is several notches away from the broiler element, which I think worked well.

Decent garlic bread. I can't place my finger on what it is exactly that I don't like but it is better than some of the store-bought brands.  However, I've found other recipes I prefer over this.  Still, it is good and went well with our steak dinner.

So delicious and easy to make - I'll never buy prepackaged frozen garlic bread!  This is so much tastier, and cheaper as well.  For special occastions, roasted garlic also goes well with this if you know how to roast your garlic in the oven - the flavor is slightly sweeter but it's great.  You'd still use the three cloves like the recipe specifies.  To learn hwo to roast garlic, go to http://appetizer.allrecipes.com/az/roastedgarlic.asp .  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was excellent.  I halved the recipe and thought it would have been better with alittle more butter ingredient but it was still wonderful.

OMG... THIS WAS AWSOME!!! I used 4 large cloves of garlic instead of 3 b/c we all love garlic, everything else I followed exactly. This was super easy to make and was cheaper and tastes so much better than the store bought or frozen ones!! The broiler doesn't work in my oven so I was happy to read the review that said cut it in half, add spread, put it back together and wrap it in foil and bake it at 350 for 20 mins. After 20 mins take it out of the foil, sprinkle the cheese on it and bake it again till the cheese melts. (about 5 mins) That worked out PERFECTLY! Everyone loved it and my son said, "You've GOT to make this more often!" UPDATE: We make this at least once a week now.. you can make it with or without the chesse, both are great! THANKS

Yummy!!! Had this with lasagna the other night, made exactly as written and couldn't have been happier. Always remember to keep your oven door cracked while broiling - or you'll instantlly char your food!

Yum, I did change it up a bit. I followed another reviewer and cut the bread in half lengthwise.  spread with the butter mix and wrapped in foil, baked 20 minutes at 350 then topped with cheese and baked for about 5 minutes until the cheese melted.  I also used whipped butter and italian seasoning.  Would be a 5 star if I had not changed the recipe so much!  Thank you

This is by far the best garlic bread recipe I've ever done at home. Restaurant quality, and yet prepared in a minute. My guests loved it, I had to make a second batch, and couldn't get it out of the oven fast enough.
Thank you Clair

I mixed about ¼ cup of softened butter with a little olive oil, then stirred in a handful of fresh chopped garlic, basil, parsley and a little oregano. I also sprinkled in some Hawaiian sea salt and fresh ground black pepper. I sliced the Italian loaf into 2 inch thick slices and spread the butter mixture generously on both sides. I shredded some fresh mozzarella cheese which I sprinkled on top right before placing the bread into the oven. I baked the bread for about 6 to 8 minutes, checking it often, until the cheese was nicely melted and I could smell the garlic. The addition of melted mozzarella was delicious and cheese-y! The flavor was seasoned just right and went perfectly with our meals tonight. I served this with, “Jenn's Out Of This World Spaghetti and Meatballs,” also from this website.

I make these every time I make homemade spaghetti sauce.  We have done them with and without the cheese on top, the difference with having the cheese on top is that it tempers any bites with a strong garlic flavor.  My 3-year-old daughter doesn't really like it without the cheese for that reason.

As a matter of fact, we LOVE this recipe just to have butter with a little zip in our fridge.  Using this butter to make grilled cheese sandwiches is to die for in our home!  However, I have also used it to make delicious scrambled eggs too.  The possibilities are really fun to discover!  Thanks so much for such a great little twist on butter!

Cut bread, brush on the spread, wrap loaf in foil, bake for about 30-40 minutes on 350. Soft and buttery on the inside, crisp on the outside.

OMG this was absolutley amazing! Way better than the frozen garlic breads I've bought in the past!! I doubled the garlic (which next time I will leave alone a little too much, but that was my fault) And I added parsley & a few shakes of Italian seasoning instead of the oregano! I Baked at 425 for 10 minutes & it was to die for!!!!!

Quick, easy garlic bread recipe that is very good for the amount of work involved! I used Parmesan in place of the mozzarella, and added a little parsley for more color. Yummy!

Okay, I read the reviews before making this bread and I found, like some of you, that it's better even without the cheese. My children love cheese sticks,so, I cut some of the bread and sprinkled cheese on top and WALA! They loved it!!!

YEEHA! I'm the bread queen in the family, followed by my girls and even though hubby could take or leave any kind of bread, he loved it too. I sliced the bread in half length wise instead of individual pieces. Delicious Clair!!!!

I didnt use the cheese and it turned out great, I made the butter and I spread it inmediately on a french bread slices. I toasted the bread three hours later and it gave the bread a great consistency; soft and moist in the middle and toasted on the edges. If refrigerated this makes a delicious garlic butter.

I don't slice my loaf, instead I tear it open.  Holding the loaf up to you start tearing down lengthwise until it opens up and is still connected.  Brown your bread, mix all your ingred. together (except cheese) brush on bread, sprinkle cheese on top and broil until cheese melts.  I'm salivating as I write this!  Tearing is a little more work but you'll never go back to cutting again.  Enjoy!

I sliced the French loaf  in half lengthwise. I spread the butter mixture on both sides, then put them together and baked, at 350 in foil for 20 minutes. Then I added the cheese and baked the bread open-faced until the cheese melted. Thanks for the recipe Clair !!! and thanks for helpful review What A Dish !

We really enjoyed this! I made it with World's Best Lasagna from this site and it went great with it! I added some grated parmesan cheese to the butter mixture and added some seasoning salt and white pepper instead of regular S&P. Excellent, thank you for sharing!

Delicious and easy - I follow this recipe as written except I do not top with mozzarella cheese.  This is my go-to recipe for making garlic bread.

I used regular white bread slices and Blue Bonnet margarine because that's all I had, but it still came out very good. I also had a jar of minced garlic and used about 3 tsp. of that instead of garlic cloves. Very good bread, the whole family liked this.

Delicious! Instead of cutting it into individual slices, I halved the loaf lengthwise & cut each half into quarters, for a total of 8 pieces... a bit easier than a bunch of smaller rounds.I followed ingredients, but not exact measurements (eyeballed most & added all to taste). The olive oil, however, does not add a lot, so I barely added any of it. The butter already has enough oil in it, & even though 2 tsp. is not a whole lot of olive oil, I just didn't feel it was necessary- & the bread still came out very tasty! For the garlic, I added a bit of minced garlic out of a jar w/ a bit of the liquid & also a pinch of garlic powder. I had no mozzarella on hand, so I substituted grated parmesan & sprinkled that on before broiling, so I didn't have to remove the bread to add cheese & place it back in another 2-3 minutes to finish; an easy one-time broil keeping an eye on it & took it out as the top & sides began to turn golden-brown. The flavor of all the ingredients combined turned out delicious... Fresh out of the over was the perfect compliment to our spaghetti dinner! Will definitely make this again, but next time I'll use the fresh, grated mozzarella instead of the parmesan. Thanks for the quick, easy & flavorful recipe! SO much better than store-bought!!!

Don't change a thing, except the time for broiling.  Mine was done in half the time... and the edges were burnt anyway!!  But the butter mixture was divine (even though we used Smart Balance)!

This was simple and delicious! We made several rounds of these and just a few changes: we ate it with rye bread which was amazingly sweet and salty at the same time, also we used normal cooking oil instead of olive and it worked just fine - we also switched the oregano for italian herbs. Would make it again!

I am never buying pre-made garlic bread again!  This was super easy and tasted awesome!  Like some of the other reviewers, I doubled the ingredients for the spread.  I also grated parmesan and asiago cheese on top for an extra kick.

Amazing!  This is so good!  I didn't use a loaf of Italian bread.  I just used two regular hero-sized rolls, which worked just as well.  Also, I didn't really measure out the mozzarella cheese.  Just sprinkled a good amount.  And, they were only under the broiler for 2 minutes before they were slightly brown.  I added the cheese and put it in for another minute.  Bravo!

Yum! I make this to go with homemade pizza and it's fantastic. If I ever have leftover garlic butter, sometime I melt it and toss it with cubed old bread which I then toast to make delicious croutons. Great recipe and good with or without the cheese.

Best garlic bread ever! I will not buy store bought again. I loved the herb taste in addition to the garlic. It was a wonderful combination. Note: 2nd time through, I reduced the oregano to 3/4 tsp and we enjoyed this much more. Thanks for the recipe!

Oregano is a very strong spice, so I used Italian Seasoning instead. I also added 2 TBS olive oil, instead of teaspoons, for a silkier texture and better melting. With these changes, it was excellent.

Three stars seems to few; four, too many.  I didn't not like it, but it didn't wow me either.  I subbed parmesan, lightly foilwrapped & baked for 20 at 350.  It was good, but not as good as I was hoping.

Very good.  I cut my loaf in half, spread the mixture on the inside, then wrapped it in foil and put it on the grill for about 15 minutes.  I omitted the cheese due to allergies.

Really good bread! I had a loaf of french bread on hand and a blend of Italian spices, instead of oregano alone, and it was awesome!!

This was great! The flavors blended nicely together to create a very delicious taste.  The left over bread was still delicious the next day!  The only thing I will change next time is the thickness of the bread slices.  I feel that 1 inch or 3/4 of an inch slices would allow for more taste.

This was delicious garlic bread.  The only thing I changed was leaving off the mozzarella cheese (thought the rest of the meal had plenty of cheese).  I also used minced garlic from a jar, which worked well.  As somebody else had done, I left the butter in the microwave for a little longer than I had planned, so part of it had melted and the rest was just soft.  The consistency to spread it was easy, though.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was awesome, thanks! I made this for a quick side dish with my salad . I just used minced garlic from the jar and even used fresh wheat sub rolls because I didn't have the french bread on hand and I turned out excellent. I think I am going to make some more right now!

This is really good!  I omitted the oregano, as I prefer plain g. bread.  I think the olive oil works well in this for flavor and it also helps the spread sink into the bread more making it more rich tasting.  If I serve it to company then I would set out a little bowl of oregano so people can sprinkle it on their own bread if they would like.  Great recipe - thanks!

So easy and flavorful! I added Italian Seasoning and adjust the garlic to your own liking. It's wonderfully cheesy and garlicky. Just like how garlic bread's supposed to be.

Easy, excellent recipe!  Instead of preparing individual pieces of bread, I just slice the entire loaf once through the middle & prepare as instructed. We especially like it topped with mozzarella.

I had half of a loaf of day old sour dough and quickly looked up a garlic bread recipe while our pasta was cooking. I am very impressed  with this recipe and likely won't buy store bought frozen garlic bread again because this is too easy.

This was delicious !! I used all the ingredients and broiled one horizontal half of Italian bread  on low for about ten minutes then I added some shredded mozzarella and parsley flakes and broiled for another 2-3 minutes. It came out toasty and the butter and cheese gave it a nice yellow cheesy inside. Yummmm ! Wish I made more :)

Very tasty as written, however, I like the way I prepare it better.  To eliminate a somewhat soggy or soft bottom, I place plain slices of French bread (no butter mixture yet) under the broiler for about a minute - just long enough so top is no longer soft. I then turn the bread over and follow the recipe as stated.  Sometimes I substitute Parmesan cheese and sprinkle parsley on top for color. Thanks for sharing your butter mixture recipe - excellent with or without the oregano.

I've tried several garlic bread spread recipes, but I like this one the best!  The only change I made was to add some red pepper flakes just because we like everything with a little kick.  Other than that, it was delicious!  I thought of putting the spread on the whole loaf but I'm glad I didn't.  Cutting it into slices first allowed the goodness to soak into the smaller pieces.

This recipe has become a standard in our family for ourselves and guests.  We use homemade saltless butter, the garlic from our garden and many different kinds of cheese but usually parmesan. Hugh

I also cut the entire loaf into 2 halves like many other reviewers. Very good. I left out the salt for health reasons and didn't miss it.

The bread was good.  I sliced loaf in half and then into sections.  I tried some with the mozzarella on top and some with just the garlic spread.  I preferred the spread only.

I make the same kind of garlic bread, but use only fresh virgin olive oil and no butter. I first tried this knowing I had a guest that was lactose intolerance but find I now, that I prefer it with only the olive oil.  You just need to use a brush to spread the mixture instead of a knife.  Also very yummy!

Followed recipe with two exceptions. 1) I used bread I made from a recipe on here called Amish White Bread. 2) I used more garlic then called for- probably double the amount- I LOVE garlic! Wonderful recipe. Thank you.

Loved this recipe. I cut the loaf in half and followed the recipe but I did not have mozzarella cheese so I used Sargento 4 Cheese Mexican. Also sprinkled a small amount of parmesan cheese on the bread before adding the 4 Cheese Mexican. Will be making my own garlic bread from now on, no more store bought.

This was pretty good, but I prefer the Garlic Bread Fantastique recipe from this site.  I think it has to do with the type of bread and cheese that is used on that one.  But hubby prefers this one so we'll probably alternate between the two.

I thought this tasted alright. I scaled it down to 2 servings, what I needed. I used butter with canola oil, to replace the butter and oil in the recipe. I didn't think the mozzarella cheese on top went though. It kind of didn't want to stick to the top of the bread. Maybe, there is a trick to that. Make sure to only broil the bread on low, as the recipe does not indicate, or it will burn.

I used cibatta bread instead of italian and it was just as good.  I was only able to butter about 6 slices of the bread but I was pretty generous with slathering each piece.  I would definitely make this again.  Also, even without the cheese it's a solide recipe.

tastes great but the first time I just set the timer for 5 mins and it was so burnt the dog wouldn't eat it.  2 minutes is as long as it takes in my oven on broil.

I love bread too much, so I used foccacia.  It was absolutely delicious!   I made a big salad with  peppers, olives, fresh tomatoes, lettuce, red onion,  olive oil, vinegar, salt/pepper & fresh herb dressing, topped with your favorite grated Italian cheese. YUM

Quick, easy, and really good! I had used the garlic butter as a base for our french bread pizza. It was a last minute decision because we were out of heavy cream to make alfredo sauce. Although we love oregano, we left it out because we added sweet italian sausages (had lots of herbs already in it) and bacon. Yuum!

The recipe as posted makes a very tasty standard garlic bread.  As other reviewers have stated, the quality of the bread one uses has a huge impact on the final product--though I have used the mixture on plain hot dog buns in a pinch and they still are tasty; just not exceptional.  Definitely superior to any frozen or store-bought garlic bread I have ever tried and so easy it has become a staple in our kitchen. :)

I proceeded with this recipe thinking, just another garlic bread. Who would have thought that these few simple ingredients could produce so much flavor?  It was terrific.

Very good.  Since I'm vegan I used soy butter and omitted the cheese.  Will definately make again.

I like the bread to be soft with just a bit of a crunch, so I bake it at 300 degrees for 2-3 minutes, and then broil it for 2-3 minutes. I jump at the chance to make this with any soup or stew – it's so delicious!

This is an awesome recipe.  I did follow "what a dish's" recommendation-put back together halves as a loaf, wrapped in foil, baked at 350 for 20 minutes, then open up, put cheese on, and bake until cheese bubbly.  One other idea-try provel cheese slices on top vs. mozarella.  This is provel, not provolone.  Provel is awesome on garlic bread.

This was a great homemade garlic bread.  I followed "What a Dish!"'s baking instructions, and sliced the bread lengthwise then spread on the butter mixture and baked in foil for 20 minutes before opening up and adding the cheese.  Next time I will omit the cheese on top as my husband and I both agreed it wasn't necessary.

The softened butter really holds the ingredients together and blending with EVOO adds flavor.  I used Parmesan instead of Mozzarella which made it a little dryer than it would otherwise have been.  You can't have enough garlic or oregano in this recipe.  :-)

This tasted very much like the boxed slices of garlic bread that you can buy in the frozen foods aisle at the grocery store.  It smelled great while baking, too!

Delicious garlic bread! We all really enjoyed this. Followed the recipe as written, but added more mozzarella to the top, just because we love extra cheese. I only broiled the toast 3 minutes before adding the cheese because it started to get too dark. I will use this recipe very often, thanks for sharing :)

Good - not the best ever.  I am not sure if it needs the olive oil?  But the oregano was nice.  I feel like it is missing something.

So yummy! I found this as my tofu parmigiana was finishing baking... I only had some Cottage Bread (yep, a white loaf of bread from the grocery store...not what I normally buy, so I'm trying to use it up!) and it worked out WONDERFULLY! The flavors were wonderful and my dinner guest agreed. The bottom didn't toast quite as well as I would normally like, but I'm sure it's because the bread I used is just so soft. I am sure I will use this recipe again and again (with a better bread, of course!) So much better than frozens loaf many people use...

I made this tonight to go with my lasagna and it turned out delish!!! I did not change a thing with the ingredients though I did think that it would not be enough. But it turned out great. I will not be going back to store bought garlic bread. I also baked mine in the oven as one reviewer stated for 10 minutes at 375 degrees.

This recipe is quite good but, as someone crazy about garlic, I found the garlic flavor to be slightly lacking when prepared as directed. I doubled the garlic and omitted the mozzerella cheese. Other than that, its quite easy to prepare and very tasty. I made it using Mama D's Italian bread, also from this site - the combination was delicious!

I really really liked this bread. I made it with beef stew.  I loved the garlic flavor. I smashed garlic reall fine to blend in with softened butter.  MMMMM i also baked at 375 for about 10 mins because I dont like broiling bread because it just gives a cruncy top, not bottom. But it was nice and soft inside. Loved it, thanks!

Incredibly good.  Popped it in the microwave for about 8 seconds to slightly soften the mixture and make it really easy to spread.   The cheese melted better for me in a 350 degree oven for a few extra minutes.

This was the fastest, easiest garlic bread I have ever made. It was delicious! Butter was out all afternoon so it was good and soft. Garlic cloves were a bit bigger than average, three were more like using four, but my group really like the strong side. I mixed after each addition with only a butter knife. Consistency of a very easy spread icing. Broiling times will depend on your broiler. I watched it like a hawk otherwise I would have burned it. I used a baking tray with sides as someone mentioned but I got lucky and did not have the oil seep out as someone mentioned earlier.

Tasty with or without cheese! I use Promise to make it healthier, and also add basil and parsley. Also add extra garlic. Sometimes we just spread this straight on wheat toast so the garlic is raw! But we really love garlic. Delicious!

This is excellent.  I left out the oregeno, but SO good!  Be sure not to melt the butter...it keeps a thicker consistency that way.

Very tasty bread indeed. Nice garlic flavor and I liked the taste the oregano gave this. I only used about a half cup cheese sprinkled lightly over. This made plenty of butter spread, I had some left over.

OUTSTANDING! I left out the oregano and added parmesan. I spread this on sub rolls and broiled on hi for 2 minutes, then I made the best meatball subs ever. I will never buy garlic bread from the store again!

Very easy to make and good.  I used french bread and had more than enough spread for half of the loaf, probably would have fit the entire loaf.  I broiled for about 2 minutes, but could try baking next time so that it gets crisp all of the way through rather than soft in the middle.

This came out great! I left out the cheese though, and put the garlic through one of those garlic presses, and baked it at 350 for about 10 minutes till it started to get nice and toasted and brown.this one's definately a keeper!

Good, but tonight I'll use a lot more oregano, butter/oil.  Putting oregano on makes it better than plain garlic bread.  Updated:  Had again & changed the rating to a 4.  We doubled the marg, garlic, oregano & cheese, but left the bread portion the same.

Excellent.  Very easy as well.  I used a little less butter and a little more olive oil...  Just my preference.  SO TASTY!!!  We tried it again without the mozzarella cheese and agreed that it's better with the cheese.

This garlic bread is amazing.  It's now the only recipe I use and it's so easy.  Occassionally I add a little dried basil, or Italian  Seasoning, or even some fresh chopped parsley to the butter mixture.

Really nice, if you're not a garlic fan then cut down on the amount of garlic or use smaller cloves. But went well with pasta. Yum

This was fantastic!  I will stop searching for the perfect garlic bread.  We made this and put cheese on half the pieces.  Everyone enjoyed both.  I personally loved the slices covered in cheese.

Good idea, but not very impressive overall.  If I make this again, I will toast in the oven... NOT the broiler.  I chopped up the few slices we didn't eat and used as croutons... liked it much better that way.

Perfect recipe! The EVOO added flavor and made it easy to blend and spread. Made the butter mixture ahead of time to let the flavors meld and will do so from now on. Also tossed in a tsp of dried parsley for a little extra color/flavor.

I used pita bread ( I opened it up and put the spread on the inside and layed it out on a baking sheet) and didn't have the cheese.  It was perfect!  For something thin like pita bread 5 minutes is way too long- try more like 2-3 minutes and it will be nice and crispy.

Needed garlic bread for a side, and didn't have the olive oil this recipe called for - added a little extra butter, and it turned out great anyway. Will definitely make sure to have the olive oil next time though.

I had to whip this together very quickly so I didn't use crushed garlic but garlic powder. :-(  I will use the right ingredients as I'm making this again today!  I like the addition of the mozzarella at the end.

uhhh YUM!  I used french bread because that is what I had.  I cut the loaf in half long way.  Upped the garlic to about 5 cloves, decreased the oregano to 1/2 teaspoon and used parmesan instead of mozzarella but no where near a cup...just sprinkled it on until there was a thin layer.  I cooked it at 425 for about 10 minutes.  Delish!

Be very careful as timing is everything, I accidentally burnt mine but my family including picky eaters all had seconds and fought over who had the last slice which we had to split in two for the kids. I used margarine instead of butter because that's what we had and plain sliced bread. It was great to have with Lasagna and Caesar salad. Thank you for sharing!

Pretty good! The combo of oil and butter added a unique taste. My guests were not disappointed, but I think next time I'll stick to my own garlic spread. Another reviewer stated it's all about the quality of bread you use, and I agree. I think that's the secret to any amazing garlic bread! :)

I forgot the salt n pepper, didn't do the garlic, put some paprika and it was still delish. I used an garlic parmesan Italian loaf from walmart, cut in half down middle and broiled open faced. But be careful of burning it.

Not bad. I was expecting a more bold garlic taste, but that's nothing an extra clove can't do for next time.

This was sooooooo good. I've never made garlic bread from scratch before but this was absolutely delicious. Instead of mozzarella I used shaved Parmesan, Romano and asiago cheeses... SO GOOD. The only thing this recipe didn't make clear was which broil setting to use. I started out with High and found out that was too intense so I would recommend a low broil. I may have added too much salt or something, or measured it wrong because they were a tad salty but it didn't ruin it for me. Best garlic bread I've ever had.

Just fed the JV/Varsity swim team (20 teenage boys after swim practice)and they LOVED it!  They went through 5 1/2 loaves and would have eaten more if I had it.  I cut the loaves lengthwise to toast (no cheese) and then sliced them.  Couldn't toast them fast enough!

This was so simple, but so so good. I did not set the butter out to soften early enough, so I ended up just melting the butter and olive oil together, adding oregano and garlic salt, and brushing the whole thing on a loaf of whole wheat French bread, split lengthwise. I sprinkled grated Parmesan cheese on the whole thing and threw it under the broiler. It was so good. I will definitely make my garlic bread like this from now on.

The perfect garlic bread, I think the mix of oil and butter is key. I added grated parmesean to the spread to make a paste, then put it onto the bread and topped with mozzarella. So if cheese is your thing that's the way to go, but the spread of this recipe is the only garlic bread base you'll ever need. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is perfect- not too buttery, not too garlicky, just right. I think adding the olive oil really makes a difference. The flavor is outstanding and it isn't greasy. The addition of mozzarella cheese was very tasty! 
*I also cut an entire loaf of bread in half and use the spread along the length of it.

I added 2 tablespoons of fresh parsley and doubled the garlic.  I also omitted the cheese.  There was enough of the mixture to cover three quarters of a french bread loaf.

Will never buy garlic bread again!!  Very simple recipe.  I used a whole loaf and sliced it in half.  Used italian seasoning instead of just oregano.  And I baked this bread at 450 for 10 min or until the cheese is melted.  Very yummy!

I am so sorry I tried this recipe.  I made it for a family bbq yesterday, I dreamt about it last night and woke up this morning wanting to eat it again.  Simply outstanding. I used a french stick for the bread, melted the butter in a frying pan, added the rest of the ingredients to the same pan(except we didn't want oregano on it) and then I dipped one side of each slice of french bread in the butter mixture.  Yummm, I am going to get fat on this one!

I keep frozen garlic bread in the freezer for short notice. This is the best, and if I froze this it would be gone when I wanted it. I do make mine a little "butterier". I never have to deal with left overs. Cut the bread horizontaly follow the recipe and you will have the best pizza bread around. Thanks for sharing

I used cheap french bread baguettes that I bought off the clearance rack. The butter mixture called for in this recipe was just enough for a thin coating on four "sandwich" sized baguettes, both sides. This was quick to assemble and the boys really liked it.

Naturally I had to madify this just a little, but OMG it was freakin' GOOD! I only had half a loaf of french bread (leftover) so I cut it in half lengthwise----easier to spread the butter mixture. I added a few dashes of thyme, used jarred minced garlic, and added some garlic powder. Then I baked it for 12 minutes at 425 degrees. Between me, my husband, and my 6 year old step-daughter, it disappeared real quick!

Awesome garlic bread.  I used already sliced french bread and did not use the oil.  This recipe takes minutes to make, and minutes to cook, and tastes amazing.  I served this as a side to potato soup, and everyone wanted more bread to mop up the soup in their bowls.  Definitely a keeper!

This was great.  I did not top with cheese because I put it on the Tangy buttermilk cheesebread (found on this site).  I did not use fresh garlic I always use the minced garlic that you purchase in the jar.  My family loved this garlic bread.

Probably the best garlic bread I've EVER made! I only had "jarred" garlic, but it still worked. There's just something about the olive oil, garlic, and all the spices that just.."meld" together. Delicious!! I'd give this recipe ten stars if I could!

It was ok, but a little bit bland tasting.  I and my guests were disappointed.  I made it exactly as written and expected it to be better based on the high rating.  I will probably use a different garlic bread recipe next time.

Great garlic toast - I love the addition of olive oil to the butter mixture.  I just baked mine for about 20 minutes or so wrapped in foil, then opened it for a couple of minutes under the broiler.  I don't like all that grated cheese on my garlic toast so I put a sprinkle of parmesan in with the butter and just skipped the mozzarella.  It was great!

This garlic spread is divine.  I'll never go back to frozen or the foil bag variety again.  Love the olive oil/ butter combo.  Also I was a little apprehensive about adding salt and pepper, but after an initial taste test, decided it was needed.  Fresh parsley would be a nice additon as well as adding some extra colour.

Really yummy! The olive oil gives the bread an added dimension of flavor. It tastes much more "authentic" than using garlic powder or salt, but is just as easy!

Really liked the taste of this recipe, although I did make a few changes.  I didn't have italian bread so used a smaller french loaf.  Next time I would make sure to use the larger loaf so that it doesn't taste as dried out.  I split the bread lengthwise and put the butter mixture on the inside of both slices then sandwiched it back together, wrapped it in tin foil and baked in the oven at 350 degrees for 20 min.  Will definitely make again and will keep the change of baking the bread instead of broiling it.

Very good...easily as tasty as any Italian restaurant.  5 minutes was too long for the first stint...they burned around the edges even before I could add the cheese.

I've made this many times.  When I'm in a hurry, I just cut the loaf open and spread the mixture on top.  Once you try it with the cheese, you won't want to make it without.

I usually omit the cheese and increase everything by about a half in order to cover a whole loaf. Also I always add more garlic cause there's never too much garlic.

This is a very quick and very tasty garlic bread.  I did not change anything and thought the garlic and oregano amounts were perfect.  My family really enjoyed this and there wasn't any left over.  I will make this again.

I tweaked this a bit. Instead of french bread, I used Texas Style bread and I also roasted garlic. Since my pasta already had minced garlic, I figured why not use it differently in the bread. It was a big hit. The sweetness of the roasted garlic gives it added flavor along with the cheese. 

It was simple and didn't take much time at all.

My husband cooked a pot of spaghetti and soon realized that we were out of garlic bread. I pulled up this recipe, spread it on the large part of 4 hot dog buns, and broiled for 5 minutes. We both agreed that this was the best garlic bread ever. Thanks for the quick fix1

Great mixture. What would make this a 5-star recipe is the following: brush mixture on BOTH sides of the garlic bread, then cook on STOVETOP (med ht). Place one side down, smash with something (I use a potato masher), then flip over and smash again. When both sides are golden, then put cheese on one side and broil fr a few minutes. The smashing makes the mixture go all the way through and it's a thin, but flavorful garlic toast. Not one dry spot on this toast!

This is almost exactly how I make garlic bread, with just a few tweaks.  I heat the oil and butter and lightly saute chopped garlic & about a half teaspoon of anchovy paste (for depth of flavor, it is NOT fishy, I swear) and a shake of red pepper flakes, then simply dip one side of each bread slice briefly into the butter before cooking.

I used this spread on my bread tonight and it was great.  I only used 1 1/2 cloves of garlic because they were so big and it was the perfect amount.  I think I am going to make some of this up to keep in a countainer in the frig so I always have it on hand.  I usually bake my garlic bread but I wanted to follow the recipe as closely as I could, so broiled it.  The bottom of the bread was too soft for me so I will go back to baking it.

I think the oregano gave it that freezer burn like taste. Maybe it was the garlic? I don't know but I'm going to use less of each next time and see if that helps.

**UPDATE** Above was my review from the first time I made it. I made it the next day with my left over pasta, and I didn't put any oregeno on it and it was AWESOME! It didn't have that freezer burn taste (like if u buy texas toast and it gets freezer burned). It was great! This recipe was my first one ever to use my broiler, I'm so glad I finally tried it out! Oh the possiblities :)

This garlic bread was really great. I made some with cheese and some without, and both were delicious. Just be careful to watch it in the broiler, because mine almost started to burn after just 2.5 minutes.

I had some leftover french bread so I looked on the site for a quick garlic toast recipe.  This recipe is exactly what I was looking for:  easy, fast, and tasty!   I didn't use the cheese this time, but I will definitely try it in the future!

Pretty good.  I did go for the healthier option and used marge instead of butter and my husband complained the bread wasn't dripping with butter.  Overall pretty yummy.  Will make again.

Good garlic bread and really easy to make.  I didn't have any Oregano, so I used Italian Seasoning instead.  Also, didn't need nearly 5 minutes under the broiler, but it's possible mine just cook really hot.

Quick, easy, and the kids loved it. Excellent recipe. I didn't have any mozzarella on hand so I just used cheddar. It still turned out great. Next time I will make sure to have some mozza. Thanks for sharing.

Best garlic bread I have ever had.  Used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic and still turned out wonderful.  Next time I will follow the recipe with fresh garlic.

This is the best cheese bread I've ever had.  The only thing I did differently is I added the parmesan in with the butter and other ingredients, spread that on the bread, and then topped it with a bunch of mozzarella.  YUMMY!  This is way better than the kinds that use mayonnaise.

Excellent recipe.  I've made it twice--first as written and the second time w/o the mozz cheese and with less oregano (about 1/2 tsp).  We preferred it the second way.  Both times I used a full loaf cut in half lengthwise instead of slicing.

Quick and tasty! I followed another reviewer's suggestion and baked the loaf in tinfoil for 20 minutes.  I also added more garlic to suit my preferences.

I love this recipe!  I don't bother with the cheese, preferring instead to savor the garlic flavor that comes through so wonderfully after it's baked into the bread.  One note: watch the broiler - five minutes is too long in my oven.  3.5 is about right.

Awesome garlic bread.  I also bake it at 350 for about 10 minutes and it seems to work very well (my broiler is a pain).  Thanks for such an easy and tasty recipe!

Delicious toppping! I used garlic infused oil from another recipe and added 1/2 teaspoon crushed rosemary instead of oregano. Brushed it on sliced San Francisco Sourdough from this site. The mixture of olive oil & butter is wonderful. Bread is crunchy, garlicky and addictive!

Excellent recipe. I added red pepper flakes and a tiny bit of salt! Like other reviewers have said this is much better than storebought! I'm going to try making a very large batch of the spread and freezing it!

So very, very good!!  Family loves it almost more than whatever main course I happen to be serving it with.  I did happen to have a little left over butter mixture once and used it to make grilled cheese sandwiches (used cheddar and french bread) which was also very, very good and great with soup too.

Super easy and delicious!  Used toast and skipped the mozzarella cheese and it still came out perfect!  My oven doesn't have a broiler but baking was just as easy - 10 mins.  Much better than frozen garlic bread and simple and quick to make.

Nothing exceptional but a very good garlic bread recipe. Perfect for your everyday Italian dish! I agree with someone else who said this doesn't make enought garlic mixture to brush a whole loaf of Italian bread.

This is goooood stuff!! I don't think I'll ever make garlic bread any other way again. I did use 1/2 cup of butter just because I was too lazy to put the leftover butter in a different dish, all other proportions remained the same...and the cheese just makes this wonderful. Thank you for this great recipe.

This recipe was EXTREMELY easy and VERY delicious. I used plain French bread slices b/c I didn't have a loaf of Italian bread on hand. I diced my garlic, and then mashed it with a fork. Lastly, I didn't have any mozzerella on hand, so I used Parmesean. I'm sure the bread would have been MUCH better with the mozzerella, so I'll be sure to have some handy next time. This is a great recipe to make because the garlic taste is not overwhelming. It's flavorful enough to be noticed, but not not so much so that the garlic is the only thing you can taste. Very good. We ate it with spaghetti and meatballs, and it completed the meal. Thanks for sharing this one! Can't wait to make it again!

wow. this was a REALLY good recipe.  it goes great with any italian recipe.  next time i make it, i will double the recipe though, because there wasn't enough to cover a whole loaf of bread.... there just wasn't enough for my whole family to have all they wanted.  i will definitley make this again and again!!

I've made this bread a dozen times, but without the mozzarella. I toast half a loaf and put the other half in the freezer for the next week. Excellent!

Delicious!  I added a couple extra cloves of garlic based on other reviews and left off the mozzarella cheese to save calories - although I know I'd love the cheese on it.  I'll never buy the garlic bread in the freezer case again!

I use 6 tbs butter, and crush the garlic coarsely by smashing with the blade of a knife and then chopping it up.  Adding the cheese really makes it even better!  i will never use another garlic bread recipe!

A real 5-star recipe. I made it on French baguettes instead of Italian bread. The cheese adds a lot, but it's also delicious without it.

Very tasty! I have always just used softened butter but never combined the butter with olive oil. This went great with some pasta dishes I made last night. Didn't add the mozzerella but next time I will for variety.

The combination of butter and extra-virgin olive oil make this my new favorite garlic bread. I usually just made mine with butter but I'll always make it this way now. I made it to go with a pasta dish that turned out badly (not from this site) and the bread actually helped make it palatable. Saved my meal. :-) Thanks Clair.

Delicious! Loved the butter/olive oil combo and the fresh garlic. Next time, I might add just a touch of garlic powder to give it a little extra garlic flavor. I topped my bread with Italian blend cheese (mozzarella, provolone, etc) and it was great. Watch carefully when you broil so you don't burn it. Will definitely make this again.

Very good!  I served this with the spinach and artichoke dip restaurant style (on this website) and it was so tasty.  The melted cheese on top was just right and the sauce was just garlicy enough.

This recipe makes the BEST garlic bread ever!  Many people use a French baguette when making garlic bread, but an Italian loaf is really so much better because of it's dense texture and hearty crust.  Aside from the bread, the use of both butter and olive oil is what makes this recipe better than the rest.  This combination makes a very smooth and flavorful topping for your bread.  I skip adding the mozzarella because it tends to harden when the bread starts to cool off.  I will make this all the time...this bread is just too good!

Like all the other reviews said: this is wonderful! I made it as the recipe stated (I doubled the recipe, though, so it would cover the entire loaf), and it was great! I used fresh garlic, which I think is better than the processed kind in a jar. I'll never, ever buy store-bought garlic bread again. This is it! YUM!

I eliminated the olive oil and added some extra butter, then mixed in some worcestershire sauce and a bit of garlic powder with the rest of the ingredients.  I also added a bit of cheddar and sprinkled grated romano cheese over the mozzarella before broiling it.  A huge hit, and now I make it often!!

Excellent!! I just made this last night and everyone loved it.  I added some diced tomatoes and put the mozzarella on top to make more of a Bruschetta kind of thing.  They went so fast, I only got one piece!  I'll definitely need to make more next time.  Thanks!!

This would have been better.  I got carried away with the garlic cloves.  Instead of three as recipe called for, I added five.  I also added a bit too much mozzerella cheese.   Will definitely make again and follow the recipe this time.

Yum!  This is so good and super easy.  I had leftover rolls that I used to make this garlic bread.  I only had them in the broiler for about 2 minutes because my broiler cooks really fast.  I didn't use the cheese and the bread still tasted great.  My husband was very impressed and said it was the best garlic bread he'd ever had.  If only he knew how easy it was!!!

Not bad... even after making healthy adjustments like using reduced-fat butter substitute and omitting the cheese. However, be sure to follow instruction #4 carefully. I got distracted and only pulled the bread out when the timer went off at 5 minutes, and had to throw half of it away.  3 min., 20 seconds in my oven produced perfect results the second go-round.

This recipe is delicious!  I didn't have any oregano, so I used Italian Seasonings instead.  It's very simple and quick to make.  The crust gets very crispy and the center is soft still...perfect!

Excellent! The addition of olive oil really takes it over the top. We had this with Carol’s ziti casserole from the site and it was one of our favorite meals. Will use again and again!

Topped the toast with pecorino-romano grated cheese and broiled both sides to make the bottoms of the slices crunchy as well.  Came out delicious! Will make it again!

This was ok for a garlic bread. I scaled down the recipe to what I needed to make for me using a gluten free ciabatta bread/roll I wanted to use up and followed the package directions for baking it. Appreciated the use of fresh garlic instead of garlic powder in this recipe, but something just seemed to be missing flavor wise...maybe more butter and roasting the garlic first would have worked...not sure. I also used parmesan cheese as that's what I had on hand and followed Bookie's recommendation on this recipe to lightly cover with foil. Decent recipe, but again, something was just off/missing to me.

I made this with regular bread off the shelf and everyone enjoyed it, so I am sure with fresh high-quality bread it would be absolutely fantastic.  Very simple and flavorful.

Everyone here liked the garlic spread, but no one was a fan of the mozzarella on top. My broiler burned these at 2 minutes, so I remade them and pulled at 30-40 seconds; added mozzarella and broiled about 30 seconds more. Minus star because we thought the cheese detracted from the savory taste.

I didn’t use any pepper, spread it on “half baked bread” from Trader Joe’s (which I sliced in abt 1-2in width), & let it cook in the oven for 8min & it was perfecttt. The flavors sunk into the bread as it cooked.

This was easy and great.  I did have to watch mine in the broiler.  Only about 2 to 3 mintues tops for browning.  Used cheddar cheese instead.

I didn't have Italian bread available, but this still worked great with some rolls that I had on hand. I added a little fresh dried parsley to the mixture, topped with parmesan cheese and baked open-faced at 425degF for 10 min. Came out excellent! UPDATE 3/7/19:  To make this even quicker, I sliced a large roll in half, spread each side with butter and spritzed with garlic olive oil, topped with pieces of minced garlic, dried oregano, parsley and grated romano cheese. It came out SO good and had nice crunch. Just have to make sure you don't keep in oven too long or you may burn the garlic.

Really easy & tasty. Just like the prebuttered one you can buy in the store, minus all the chemical preservatives. 

I cut the loaf in half lengthwise, applied spread, wrapped foil & baked as directed. 

Then unwrapped from foil & placed under broiler for few minutes to crisp it up. Watched it carefully under broiler to make sure it didn't burn. Delicious side for our pasta main dish.

This was so quick to make and very good!  The bread had a strong garlic flavor which we loved.  Next time I would leave off the mozzarella and eat as is.

Rather than cutting the loaf into slices to start. it is much easier to halve the bread and prepare...then cut into servings.

This was great! I modified the recipe a bit by adding 3 tablespoons of oil and leaving out the cheese. Since it was accompanying lasagna, I didn't want too much cheese. They came out delicious and the whole party loved it! I will definitely make this again.

I was not happy with the results for this. I had nowhere near enough mix to cover the bread, so it was spread so thinly that there was no flavour. I ended up just cutting it up and using it has croutons in my Caesar salad so it didn't go to waste.

This is amazing. We all loved the butter sauce and the cheese topping. My husband ate more of this than the main dish. He said wherever you got this recipe keep it. This is sooo good!  The only change I made was the bread. We had naan bread that I had to use and it was really tasty. I will def be making this as our go to garlic bread from now on vs store bought. Thank you!!

Really enjoyed this recipe. It even works on sliced sandwich bread (I was trying to use up the loaf before it went stale). I refrigerated the leftovers (must be cooled completely before putting in fridge to keep moisture out) warmed them up in the oven the next day and it was still good.

We like to buy the fresh  Italian loaf of bread from the grocery store. After a couple days the bread hardens.  We usually make croutons but I tried this instead. Great way  to use up the Italian bread.  I made it  exactly as the recipe reads and I tried a different version with garlic salt instead of garlic power and salt. It was acceptable but not as good as the original.

This was wonderful! I didn't have any cheese on hand so made it without. Even my kids who don't like the store bought garlic bread had seconds of this. I ran out of the first batch & had to make more. I only used a few pieces of thickly cut bread & put the extra butter in the fridge for more another time. Watch while broiling, though. My first batch scorched after 1 1/2 minutes when it was on high. I lowered the broiler temp for the second batch & that one was about 5 minutes.

I made this with Ciabatta and it really knocked out socks off! At first I was just going to use 2 roasted cloves of garlic but then I saw this recipe and added one raw, chopped clove. Also some leftover garlic/Rosemary/salt rub from the steaks we grilled for dinner. Skipped the mozzarella and oregano. We grilled this on the BBQ open because we ran out of foil. Let me tell you BEST GARLIC BREAD EVER!

Made it twice this week. The first time on thick bread spread on a cookie sheet. Baked for a few minutes, then added shredded parmesan and broiled for a couple minutes. Tonight i used a french loaf sliced end to end and wrapped in foil, baked it at 450 for 20 minutes. Perfection both times. I also made the butter mixture during the day with jarred minced garlic so the flavors melded. And this morning i made my scrambled eggs with the garlic butter. Yum!

Roasted a whole garlic head (not cloves) in the oven 350 for about 20 min.  Just chopped the top off a little so can see the garlic cloves and drizzled with small amount of olive oil.  Once done, peeled off the garlic skin, minced and mixed with the rest of the ingredients. Right before putting in the oven, also lightly drizzled some more olive oil on the bread-covered with foil and baked in the oven for about 10 minutes at 350 degrees.  Checked mid way just in case so it didn't burn.  The bread came out nicely crisp on the outside and edges, but still chewy and moist on the inside.  Family LOVED it and it was not overpowering.  Will absolutely  make again with this same prep.

Unfortunately, I was not too impressed with this garlic bread, the oregano took over the rest of the ingredients and the amount of garlic was quite overpowering. I would recommend putting only 1 clove of garlic in the mixture and less oregano.

This recipe is very good! Easy to make and can turn old bread into nice and toasty fresh bread! I used some "french bread loaf" I had in the refrigerator and honestly this transformed the bread into a tasty toasted garlic flavored piece...will make it again....since I had a small piece of bread I have left overs for spreading on other breads and toasting. My only suggestion would be always keep an eye on the broiler...it can be tricky as it can burn anything quite quickly!

Love this recipe!  Changed it up a bit though. Instead of using French bread, I had used sour dough bread and omitted the mozzarella cheese. My husband said it was the best garlic bread he has ever had yet!

I tried this recipe. I didn't have any Italian bread because it was a last minute idea, so I decided to use whatever bread I had available which was 15 grain wheat bread from Pepperidge farm. Delicious! I cut the ends of the bread off because they were a little burnt but if that's how you like it then its all gooooodd! Would definitely try this with Italian bread!

This is good. Had to cut out the butter because it made it a tad bit too oily when I made it the first time. But has since made it twice and will make again.

This is not bad recipe.  But I personally prefer some ground parmesen cheese instead of mazerella cheese.  I made some Italian bread from this site and used this garlic bread recipe.  The cheese flavor was very mild.  I think I'll stick with the garlic butter from this site to make garlic bread with.

Well my husband said it was one of the best garlic breads he had ever had, so success!  Even the kids ate it. I brushed both sides with the mix. Just watch the bread under the broiler, doesn't need much time!

What a wonderful recipe! I followed the instructions with the exception of using an "Italian seasoning mix" rather than just Oregano. This was a great new way of making garlic bread and it will probably be the only way I'll make it from now on :) It also tasted 100% better than the store bought version. The men of the house gave it 5 Stars as well - which means pretty much anyone will love this delicious bread!

This is not your typical store-bought garlic bread but is absolutely INCREDIBLE!  This tastes a lot more "fresh" than store-bought.

Thank you for the recipe!

Wonderful recipe! Be sure to get the freshest bread with a softer crust. If you start with a very crunchy bread, the broiling will make it even crunchier. Also, substituting Parmesan instead of mozzarella is just as yummy. This recipe is so simple, it's really hard to get wrong.

made this for the first time as a midnight snack...i'm glad i'm able to make it myself now...because i've seen some sold in the supermarkets and did not want to buy it because of the unhealthy trans fat it contained.....now making it with the cheese is surely different and delcious
...i chose mostly all organic and healthy ingredients...

10 stars! ok you can't pick that but this was amazing.  All I had was Minced garlic instead of cloves and I may have burnt the edges a bit but just chizzled that off and BOOM! Awesome!  Thank you, I will never ever ever ever buy the store bought  again.

Thought this was pretty good, but for our tastes I think it needed garlic powder (for a stronger garlic flavor) and maybe a little grated parmesan sprinkled under the mozzarella before the final broil. It toasted up beautifully, it just didn't have quite as much flavor as we like! :)

We love garlic bread! This was great. I added some dried parsley for more colour, and used regular toast bread s we had that on hand. Definitely use a baguette or another bread like it if you want a good "crunch" from your garlic bread, but toast bread works in a pinch too.

I made this on homemade french bread, and the only difference was I only put in half the amount of oregano and I added some parsley. It was absolutely delicious.Yum! I definitely liked this recipe! I am sure I will use this one again.

With a blink of an eye they were gone. I had my doubts when I looked at the picture, but these were amazing. I used regular olive oil instead of extra virgin because that was what I had. I also used garlic powder instead of crushed cloves because it was all I had and it's easier. The mozzarella cheese was the icing on the cake, a perfect touch!

The oil adds a nice consistency.  We used garlic powder (I'm intolerant to the meat of a garlic or onion) and at the standard conversion it wasn't very garlicky.  Will add more next time.  We also used parmesan instead of mozza (none in the house) and it worked well.  Would like to try the mozza next time.

I made great garlic bread with this recipe. But, because it was for a barbecue, I made the spread beforehand and applied it to the bread right before putting it on the grill.   I love a strong garlic taste so I used 12 cloves of garlic for 2 sticks of butter. Mixed it with oregano and paprika and left out the cheese. This was enough for a large loaf of French bread, a baguette, and then some. Yummy!

Even though this was better than average, it still didn't "Wow" me like what I was hoping for.

This was good, but didn't have the WOW factor I was looking for.  I'm not quite sure why because everything about this recipe sounded like something we'd really like.  Maybe I'll give it another try to see if we draw the same  conclusion.

This recipe is worth the 5 minute prep and 5 minute cook time.  I used a little less butter than called for.  Spread on with a brush to make it even on each piece.  Came out light and flavorful.  Skipped the cheese.

I thought this bread had a great garlic flavor and really enjoyed it. I did burn it so I will make sure to watch it more carefully next time. I think I would prefer it without the cheese but it was really good. Will definitely make again.

This was very good!  I doubled the recipe because I wanted to make sure that I always had some on hand when I wanted to make garlic bread.  I did add a teaspoon of garlic powder because I like a good garlic taste.  For an extra treat, I like to thinly slice tomatoes and lay on top of bread and bake (no the bread does not get soggy, least mine doesn't), then put the cheese on top under the broiler, to die for.  I think I may try this with out the cheese next time or use parmesan

Wasn't stunned.  Good, but not the garlic bread taste I was going for.  Actually turned out a little bland.  Maybe I didn't do it quite right.

SO good! My fav garlic bread I have ever made...used all the ingredients, but I mixed the garlic,butter,and oil together and slathered on the bread...then sprinkled the spices separately on top. I LOVE garlic so I also sprinkled some additional garlic powder as well! Just be sure and keep an eye on them cuz they can go from toasted to burnt in the blink of an eye! This is my new go too garlic bread :)

I used a soft French bread loaf because I had one in the freezer. Absolutely delicious. Came out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Thanks to Clair for this recipe.

I've made this recipe last minute before, with just a couple pieces of white bread and no mozzarella cheese. It still turns out wonderful - and is a great alternative to store-bought garlic bread.

Ok, don't think I will be making again in any hurry. Not sure I liked the mix of olive oil and butter.  If I was to make again, I would lightly toast the underside of the bread first and just use olive oil.

These were delicious.  I must have had it in the oven too long, however - the edges were VERY crisp.  It worked out well, though, as we used them for croutons in our Caesar salad!

Fantastic!  This is the best garlic bread.  I used the method of baking the bread in foil for 20 minutes and then topping with cheese and broiling for the last 3-4 minutes or so.  Yummy!

Tasty. I only used 1/4 of a loaf of Italian bread. Served with "Hamburger Vegetable Soup" and romaine lettuce/spinach salad using "Batman's Best Caesar Dressing."

Very easy. Instead of using fresh crushed garlic, I sprinkled a little dried minced garlic because that's all I had. My only suggestion is to not make the pieces any thicker than an inch because then there isn't enough of the spread to soak through and only the tops are tasty.

EXCELLENT garlic bread! I cut the recipe in half for my boyfrield and I and followed it exactly. We both thought this was a very tasty addition to our cheesy meaty tortellini. I highly recommend this one!

Mmmm!  Used French bread.  Doubled the recipe, but tripled the garlic!  I let this sit in fridge for the day, then made it soft again for spreading. Mine almost burned at 3 min cooking so keep your eye on it!  All gone in one dinner. Wish I had made more!

Wonderful!  This is quick and easy and a real treat.  My family and neighbors loved it last night with dinner.  I did use an extra clove of garlic because we LOVE garlic and I used a good loaf of rustic french.  I cooked it on a foil covered sheet pan with the edges of the foil up to catch any drippings that others described.  This is restaurant quality.  Thank you Clair.

Fantastic and so easy.  I used french bread, increased the butter to a full stick, and four large cloves of garlic.  Halved the loaf and spread it over, and baked with our lasagna for the last few minutes. I won't have to buy garlic bread ever again.

This is excellent!  I spread out the ingredients onto a loaf of Italian bread and put it in the oven for 15 minutes at 350 degrees.  Then I broiled it for about a minunte to crispen it up before taking it out of the oven.  My boyfriend loved the olive oil!

This was great.  I scaled it to 4 and the garlic butter mix was just enough to spread 4 pieces of bread.  Next time I think it needs a bit more garlic (I did one larger clove and one smaller one...I'll do 2 good sized cloves next time for this scaling).  I also will add more salt next time, as I didn't add enough this time (my fault).  I also omitted the oregano because I am not a fan, but next time I will add something...either oregano or parsley or something.  Definitely a delicious recipe though!  YUM!  P.S. Broiler on low instead of high...or bake on 375 for 10 minutes for a crispy top AND bottom and use a pan with sides!

This was good, but after following the directions the first time, I did it differently the next.  I cooked it on the "toast" setting of my toaster oven, rather than the "broil" setting, without the use of a pan - just set it right on the rack. That way the underside of the bread got crisp too. After putting the cheese on, I broiled it.

I cooked this just as the recipe states.  Adding the oil gives it such a wonderful flavor change.  We did 1/2 with Mozzarella & 1/2 with Parmesan.  I'd give it 5 stars with Parmesan instead!!

Very tasty!  I used a loaf of Italian bread from our local bakery, but since there are only three of us, followed the spread recipe generally (ie. about 1 tbsp. butter, glug of oil, etc).  It broiled up nicely in our counter toaster, and does taste like restaurant bread.  Will use again.

fantastic recipe. I used hoagie rolls because I had some left over that needed to be eaten. I added a little fresh grated parmesan but otherwise made as stated.

This garlic bread is perfect.  Too often we think the only way to enjoy garlic bread is to have it served at an Italian restaurant or buy it frozen at a grocery store.  This recipe exceeded both.  In my case, I did not have mozzarella cheese.  Using a grater, I applied a light coat of Parmesan cheese.  This worked well.

It is easy to make, easy to memorize, easy to add to or change flavors based on the dinner your serving with! As for the different varieties tried by me: 


on one, I used parmasean instead of mozzarella; on a second, I subbed italian seasoning for dried oregano; on a third, I added a small amount of honey to the mixture (I'm guessing about a tablespoon); on a fourth, I put in garlic powder instead of oregano and added white pepper to taste(for a spicier bread); on even still another I added a tiny bit of lime juice....


Thank you Clair! This is awesome! I have used this countless times since the first... and always manage to make something delicious!

This is the best bread ever! I did mine a little differently however. I cut the bread in half instead of in slices and doubled the recipe. I also sprinkled garlic salt on top prior to placing in the oven.

I actually just made this on slices from a regular loaf of bread, and it turned out great, so I'm sure it would be amazing on a loaf of Italian bread... I put parmesan on top and it made it even better. super easy!!

I've made this twice now and it's now the only Garlic Bread recipe I use.  I've varied it slightly both times.  Both times I've used fresh oregon & basil from my garden.  The 2nd time I had some leftover roasted garlic that I used instead of the fresh minced garlic.  My family loves this recipe.  I really think the Olive Oil is the secret.

This bread was soooooooo good! I do not like the garlic bread in the freezer section of the grocery store, or the stuff in the silver bag. Our family was actually fighting over the bread & hoping someone would not like it so we could eat their piece!

I used margarine instead of butter, and bottled crushed garlic instead of fresh, and it was easy to spread and tasted great! I made it without cheese, but either way would be delicious, I'm sure.

I made this as a side to go with chicken on the grill last night, it was great! I made it as written with the mozz. cheese.  No more store-bought garlic toast in this house!

This was very strong garlic flavor, soooo good. The only thing I did different was broil both sides of the italian bread, and not add the cheese. Will definately use this recipe again.

I really, really liked this, and I made a few "personal preference" changes.  I used half olive oil and half Smart Balance spread for the fat mix, and next time I think I'll use a higher proportion of olive oil.  It worked great, and it's much better for you than straight butter!  I also used a little more garlic, and omitted the cheese.  Looking forward to making it again!

Phenomenal treat to complement your meal. Breeze to prepare. Quick to serve. Try on whole wheat long rolls with Smart Balance butter spread and low-fat mozzarella for a lower calorie dish- still delicious with half the guilt.

Very tasty - but probably left them under the broiler a little too long. Very nice with the Mozarella..
Would do again.

This was good, however, I am more apt to stick with the frozen variety.  There are so many good ones and they are easy and inexpensive.

This was a meal in itself! I used a mix of parmesan and mozzarella. Think the olive oil really adds something to it. I will no longer buy the store bought garlic bread.

The flavor of the bread was great, but I'm only giving it three stars because the proportions seem to be way off.  Maybe my family just likes strong flavors, but I used the suggested amounts of topping ingredients and cheese on just eight slices of bread!

Sooooo good!  If you like garlic I would suggest adding a little more to this recipe.  I softened the butter in the microwave before mixing in other ingredients.  Be sure to watch the broiler closely as things burn in a hurry.

A little too much orengeno for my liking. Other than that it was pretty good. Watch broil time! I didn't add the cheese either.

I love the melted mozarella on top of garlic bread at restaurants. For some strange reason, my bread bacame soggy. Maybe I did something wrong.

EXCELLENT garlic bread.  Made one batch w/o mozzarella and one with.  Both were wonderful.  Watch the broiler time! Mine were done pretty fast.

Great recipe. Only thing different I did was that I used kalamata olive bread instead of italian. I've made this several times but will stick w/the olive bread.

As good, if not better, than any you can buy. As a suggestion, you might want to set your timer for about 3 1/2 minutes then add the cheese for another minute. Goes great with pasta.

I have always bought the frozen kind before because mine was never good. I sure don't have to do that anymore. This is way,way better than any store bought. Heck, it's even better than the loaves I get at the Italian restaurant, and they are 8 dollars! Thank you Clair for this great recipe : )

I didn't have any mozzarella, so I added 2 tbls. of parmasan.  I only cut up the garlic and it was a little crunchy, so I won't do that again.
Quick and good!

Loved it! My husband likes it with cheese; I prefer it without, so I do half and half. I believe the salt and pepper to taste should be mandatory. I really think a little of both really enhances the taste.

This recipe is really good - it smells just like restaurant garlic bread, although I have really bad breath now.  I made this the night before and then toasted it again the next day for lunch.  Came out great.

The recipe was perfect, it does taste alot like a certain pizza chain's garlic bread to me, and now that I  know how easy it is for me to make at home I can't believe I've been giving away my money to them for this long, I will never buy frozen or restaurant garlic bread again.

YUMM, This was very good, but It needs more garlic. It didn't have enough garlic on it for us to consider this garlic bread. We add garlic to everything so to us this was a cheesy bread with a little garlic. I probably will make again with some garlic powder in addition. Thanks!!

Been making this for years with a variety of bread and sometimes vary the cheese. In a pinch I will use garlic salt and/or garlic granules instead of crushed garlic. Sometimes I sprinkle dried parsley on for interest.

Very good.  I took the easy way out and spread butter on the bread, topped with garlic, oregano, and mozz cheese and then I put it in the oven..fast and delicious!

Very tasty garlic bread! The combination of butter and olive oil and along with the garlic,spices & cheese is very yummy! I served it along with linguini w/ clam sauce and it was the perfect addition.  I will definitely be making this again!

So I had to improvise since I ran out of garlic and oregano. I used dried minced garlic and spicy spaghetti seasoning. Still came out great! I can't wait to try it again with the right ingredients.

The bread got a little burned from the broiling.  Very tasty, but nothing extraordinary.  The garlic butter was very good.  Next time, I think I would slice the bread a little thicker.

Excellent recipe!  I made it without the cheese because we were having it with lasagna and I thought the additional cheese would be overkill.  This would be a great spread for making croutons, too, because that's what the taste reminds me of.  Thanks, Clair, for such a fast, easy and delicious recipe!

This recipe was a big disappointment. I followed the directions and had about 10 people over for a luncheon. I made plenty of items from this site and they all got compliments except for this one. Garlic bread is, in my opinion, one of those things you look forward to when you see it served and this one was not something to look forward to.

This is excellent.  I loved this bread.  I did not use the mozarella cheese, but next time I might add a tiny bit of parmesan just for something different.  Really flavorful.  Thank you!

Very good recipe.  Both good and easy!  I was out of mozzarella, so I used swiss and it was great.  I also chose to use sliced cheese because I thought it would be a little easier to keep from getting it on the pan.  Worked great.

This was pretty good garlic bread that goes well with the chicken parmigiana recipe from this site.  I let people add their own garlic salt to their bread as tastes varied in that department.

The best - with or without the cheese - I also substitute parmesean cheese at times - since it stays well in the frige, when I make it I will make a lot and we have garlic bread all week - not good for the waistline but it brings smiles to the table to see the bread!!!  Matter of fact, I just finished making a batch of it again.  We are having Chili II tonite submitted by Cathie (on this website-delicious!!!).

Absolutely delicious!! A great alternative to plain garlic bread. Didn't have garlic salt. Substituted Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb spice blend.

This was so much better than store-bought.  I had to watch the bread very carefully under the broiler as it browns quickly.  Really delicious.

Awesome!!!! Both husband and daughter (as well as myself) thoroughly enjoyed this!  I added a bit more garlic (we love garlic) and didn't have any mozzerella cheese, but it was great without it!  I'll definitely add the cheese next time - thanks for a great recipe!

I made this as a last minute item for our dinner party, and it was loved by everyone!  I used mozzarella cheese and that is definitely a must but I skipped the oregano.  I'll be making this again because it's so quick & easy.  Thanks Clair!

This is SO good! I make it at least once a week. I have made it for friends and family and everyone has asked for the recipe!
