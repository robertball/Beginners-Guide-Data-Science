Hubs made this for us tonite and it was simple and excellent. One pound of crabmeat certainly isn't necessary for two people, however, and almost seemed like a misprint, so use only as much as what appeals to you. He used very small filets, about 4 oz. each, wrapped them in bacon and seasoned them with Worcerstershire sauce and Montreal Steak Seasoning. He used the meat from Alaskan King Crab legs, tossing them with plenty of hot, clarified butter. If you like your steak cooked medium to medium-well as I do, you'll want to cook them a few minutes longer than the recipe directs. After Hubs was done with these?...five star good.

Really great idea, and a great starting point that you can build on!  I used imitation crab meath, and I've also tried it with imitation lobster meat.  It's delicious either way!  I also like to saute the crab meeat with the butter and a splash of champaign. Yummy!

The crabmeat was a total miss for me.  It was way too much crab for the amount of steak and too little butter to flavor the crab.  I made a sauce for the asparagus I served with it from this site's recipe Lemon Butter Seasoned Vegetables, and the sauce drizzled over the crabmeat did add some flavor.  Maybe I'll take some of this extra crabmeat and make a salad.

It was really good. I added a garlic powder mixture to the steak seasoning and that turned out really well. However you do not need 16 oz of crab. 8 oz would have been much better.

Made this for valentine's day and it was a huge success! It looks very fancy but is quite easy to make. I was able to get frozen King crab legs at the grocery store. I also mixed in a little garlic powder into the melted butter. The quality of the protein makes this meal quite expensive, but well worth it for special occasions.

A little more butter melted, fresh clove garlic minced, and Old Bay seasoning with real KING crab meat, oh so good!!  I like the MR warm through the center steak in the oven!
