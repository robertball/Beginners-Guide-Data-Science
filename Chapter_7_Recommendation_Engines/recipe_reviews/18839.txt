I've been coming to AllRecipes.com for a couple years now, and while so many recipes are wonderful this is the FIRST time I felt so inclined to return to write a review.  The flavor and kick was just what I was looking for in a jambalya receipe.  The family can't shovel it in fast enough.  Mmmmmm good!!!!

Very good recipe, though I did make some alterations. I use 2 cans of tomatoes and green chilis (I like my jambalaya with a kick to it)instead of the stewed tomatoes, I use either smoked sausage or kielbasa instead of the sausage links, and I increase the rice to 2 cups with 4 cups of broths (I have a big family). Though I do reduce the hot sauce to 1 teaspoon if it is good quality hot sauce, but if you use generic or "not-so-hot" hot sauce then you can use the full 1 Tablespoon. I also add 1/4 teaspoon cajun seasoning and 1/4 teaspoon thyme if I have it on hand. Chicken breast is optional, good either with or without it.

I used chorizo sausage with this recipe which I cut into one inch pieces and browned in my cast iron dutch oven. I removed the sausage and quickly sauteed my shrimp which I had already seasoned with Emerils essence. I removed the shrimp just before it was completely done and added my onions, plus scallions and two chopped green bell peppers and cooked until soft. I then added the tomatoes, sausage and rice and simmered until cooked thru. The shrimp went in during the last five minutes of cooking. Delicious and thanks for a great start.

Very yummy!  I didn't use onions because I'm the only one in my family who will eat them.  I also used chicken sausage and added bacon (the meats I had around) but otherwise stayed true to the recipe.  This dish was even better the second day!

Great recipe, made a few small changes.  I made it on the stovetop.  Used 2 cans chick broth instead of 3 cups.  I also put in 3 stalks diced celery.  Instead of already cooked chicken I added about 1lb raw chicken tenders cut in chunks.  Ended up cooking it at a simmer for around an hour until the rice was tender.  I added cooked shrimp at the end just before serving so it just warmed through.  Will definitely add it to my list of regularly made recipes.

Update: 3-18-2009 I halved the recipe since there are only two of us. I used 2 cups leftover chopped up turkey for the the chicken. I sauteed the onion and then added 3 links of hot Italian turkey sausage raw and cooked until almost done. Then I followed the recipe adding the other elements and actually using real rice this time. I added a little more garlic powder and tabasco than it says for half a recipe and I used frozen already peeled/cooked shrimp. When there were about 8 min. left I put the still frozen shrimp into the pot. They were medium sized so I would use less time or more depending on the size. It was much less watery and the leftovers were delicious (instead of tolerable). So easy and I still don't have an electric skillet but it was still very little clean up.    2-15 2007 I had no electric skillet and I didn't want to make as much as this said so my methods were a bit different. I took one large onion and sauteed in the oil. I used 2 boil in bag instant rice and boiled this and set aside. With the remaining water i dumped most and then added 1 can of chicken broth to about half a cup of the starchy water. I didn't have leftover chicken breast so I boiled that in the chicken breast and shredded it in th pan.   While the chicken was boiling I took the entire pound of hot turkey sausage and browned it with the onion (crumbled) and one clove of garlic plus garlic powder. Once this was done I used one can of stewed tomatoes drained and added it to the sausage. Onc

As the famous "RR" would say, YUM-MO!  Came out very hearty, we loved it!  What we also love is sopping the juices up with bread, so I may skip draining the tomatoes and/or adding more broth next time.  This would be great for a party. Will make this again & again.  Thanks!

Outstanding and simple dish.  Cooks perfectly in an electic fry pan.  To use brown rice be sure to cook at least 30 minutes and keep an eye on the liquid, you may have to add more.  Also don't add the shrimp till the last 5 minutes.

This was really good.  I added a chopped bell pepper and minced fresh garlic with the onion and didn't drain the tomatoes for extra sauce. Good leftover too.

WOW!  This was good!  I made this with Trader Joe's cajun chicken sausage and it worked well.  When finished, this easily filled a 9 x 13 serving dish and fed 8-10 people.

This is the first time I have commented on a recipie, although I have used allrecipies for 5 yrs! It's wonderful with a few modifications. I omitted the chicken, used pork sausage, and of course, any cajun will tell you: used the 'holy trinity' Instead of just onions, I added 3 stalks celery, 3 cloves fresh garlic, & 1 bell pepper, and to the skillet,as well, and cooked till soft. Added 1 tsp. italian seasoning, 1 tsp.thyme,and 1 Tlb.cajun seasoning. Wonderful, wonderful flavor, truly cajun food!!!

This was really, really good.  I used Spicey Italian sausages  I also dribbled over with the 2 teasps of Hot sauce, there was really no need for that so next time I will use the amount recommended.   I didn't have any Chicken broth so boiled the chicken and used the broth made by the chicken with some dried chives and parsley added.  I also served limes wedges with the meal and sprinkled this over which gave an excellent flavour, I only had the really small limes so next time will use larger ones or lemon wedges.  Thanks so much Jenny will use this again and again.   Irene

WOW! I just finished cooking, and eating this, and it was amazing!  I had to log on right away to do this review.  Hubby made "yummy" noices all throughout eating his, and gave it 2 thumbs up, 10 stars, he can't wait to have more tomorrow! The only changes I made were to cook this in a wok, used sweet italian sausage instead of turkey and didn't drain the tomatoes. Thank you Jenny, I will be making this one often.

I'm giving this a three for ingredients. I have always loved jambalaya so has my bf.  I ended up adding about a tbls of cajun seasoning and would have added more but I ran out.  I reccoment using tomatoes with chilis or adding your own.  I added 1 tbls of Franks hot sauce.  None of this was enough.  I ended up adding a good shake of red pepper flakes, garlic powder and about 1 to 2 tbls of hot sauce I bought in Costa Rica called Chillero.  All of this was delicious but flavour was definitly lacking in this recipe

I make this about once a month because my family loves it so much.
I double the stewed tomatoes, Texas Pete hot sauce, and the rice (cos it’s cheap to make it last!) I never use turkey sausage—only local smoked pork sausage made in Conecuh County, Alabama. I usually use boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts. I make my own chicken broth, and it makes a big difference. I also add a pound of frozen okra. I know peeling shrimp is a pain, but it’s worth it!

This recipe is a simple and delicious. This was my first time making Jambalaya and it was very easy and my husband and I both loved the taste. I will definitely make this again. I did not use an electric skillet, just cooked it stovetop. I kept all of the original ingredients and just added extra spice.

This was very good.  The only change we made was that we used Hot Italian Sausage instead of the Turkey sausage links.  It added a bit of heat to the dish.  Just what it needed!  :)  We will definitely be making this again.

What a great recipe to "rekindle" my love for Jambalaya! I had to do some adjustments to use my dutch oven instead of the electric skillet. For my own taste, it needed a little more of a kick so I used some "old bay seasoning" and little extra cayenne pepper. Instead of the garlic powder I used fresh garlic cloves instead

This was great. I did do a couple of things different some on purpose and some were and accident but it turned out very spicy and very good! First, I added chorizo on purpose but I used a can of chili tomatoes and a can of stewed (accident) It was so good. I used a bay leaf too for a little something extra in flavor. My hubby hates tomatoes and he loved this and asked me to make some and put it in the freezer so he can heat it up when our baby arrives in June. I left ouot the seafood though. Would love to try that but my hubby is allergic. Thanks again for a great recipe!

I was not able to use an electric skillet as the recipe called for, instead I used the stove-top equivalent.  That was the only adjustment I made in this recipe.  This recipe gets three stars (instead of one or two) from me because it turned out and was edible.  I've been looking for a great jambalaya recipe and will definitely keep looking.  It just wasn't anything special or even all that great.    Additionally, there is absolutely no reason to cook shrimp for 20-25 minutes.  In a heated covered pot, shrimp will cook in just a few minutes.  I can't imagine a scenario when over 10 minutes would be necessary.  The 20-25 minutes made the texture of the shrimp quite unfortunate.

This is fantastic!  I make this dish when I have company over and get many compliments on it.  Very easy too.  We leave out the shrimp and it is still delicious!

This tastes really good. I added a can of diced tomatoes towards the end of cooking. Next time I will serve the sauce and rice separately so the rice doesn't get mushy.

fantastic!!! I used Mild Italian Sausage instead of turkey, for that extra kick, and omitted the prawns.  I cooked the sausage & chicken first in the same pan, then added the rest.  (Easy, one pot meal) Since I used  brown rice (which needs extra cooking time), I didn't drain the tomatoe sauce, and it was delicious!!! My husband LOVED it, and it will now be an easy dinner for company or potlucks - it's that good!

My family enjoyed it even though it came out very soggy. I even mistakenly put half the amount of chicken broth and it was still soggy, but tasty. Will try again, but use only 1/3 of chicken broth needed. And maybe hold off on the shrimp.

This is delicious! We actually made it two nights in a row! We omitted tomatoes since we didn't have any the first night...Double the recipe though, this jambalaya goes FAST!

Used turkey kielbasa and omitted the shrimp (seafood allergy). Doubled the hot sauce (Frank's RedHot). Husband gave it rave reviews and asked me to add this to our usual rotation.

Superb! This is so hearty and filling, and if there are left-overs, they taste even better the next day!  We like to use wild rice, and sometimes we add a can of clams.

Oh my goodness this was awesome! I halved the recipe, and didn't add shrimp (too expensive for me right now)I also added some garlic cloves and some green onions but pretty much everything was the same. My husband had two bowls, and we had a friend over who was VERY impressed with my cooking and kept calling Betty Crocker or Susie Homemaker the rest of the night. It was a HIT I WILL make this often!

My boyfriend gave this 5 stars, I gave it 4. I prefer a saucier Jambalaya, but this was really good, too. We added jalapenos for extra spice, and used hot italian sausage. We call this Couples Jambalaya because we made it together (awww, how cute).

This was just ok for me. I made it exactly according to instructions and it turned out fine but there wasn't anything unique about it to separate it from the usual Jambalaya recipe.

Delicious!  It's quite mild, which is nice.  Everyone can add extra hot sauce to their servings, allowing for customized heat! :-)

I made this in a slowcooker, adding the shrimp in the last half hour before serving.  Low setting for 4 hours, then add rice and turn to high until rice is tender, set back to low and add shrimp.  About 6 hours total in a pot that runs quite hot on low. "Your mileage may vary."

Yum! My husband really loved this. But I used a can of tomatoes with green chiles, and that made it too hot for our 2 and 4 year olds.  My 2-year-old loved the shrimp. He kept asking for "more hot dog."  (one expensive hot dog, huh?) :)

Did we have the same recipe?  I usually cook great jambalaya's, but nobody in the family liked this as much as my other ones. In fact, they didn't like it at all! This is the first bad review I've ever given!

We found this very tasty;  I found it very easy to make.  I was looking for something to cook that would incorporate chicken and sausage.  I cooked an onion and 2 garlic cloves in olive oil in a dutch oven on the stove, then added a diced pepper then removed to a plate; I then cooked the chicken and sausage through.  Added the onion, garlic and pepper back, along with 2 cans tomatoes, the rice (brown)and chx broth salt, pepper, several shakes of Franks, chili powder, cayenne, brought to a boil then simmered for approx 40 minutes.  Will be making again.  Quite filling and yummy with a salad.  Thanks!

Stupid recipe. Now I can never truly enjoy jambalaya from a box again... ;)

This was delicious! I sort of ignored the portion amounts and just put in the meat I had available and diced instead of cubed tomatoes. I do not have an electric skillet, so I cooked everything on my skillet and then transferred it into a pot, added the rice and broth, brought it to boiling and let it simmer for 25 minutes. This was delicious! This is definitely a good guideline for a great recipe. Thank you!

Very good! If you are cooking for just 2 you can easily cut the recipe in half as the shrimp doesn't keep very long. Great flavor and it's easy to make and control the spice level. Will definitely make again!

I made this last night after doing a quick search for something I could make with the random items I had on hand. It was DELICIOUS and will definitely become a part of my repertoire. I don't think you could really mess this up, but here's what I used since I didn't have all of the exact ingredients: diced tomatoes instead of stewed, Pete's hot sauce, leftover rotisserie chicken, frozen pre-cooked shrimp, full-sized turkey sausage, 1/2 an onion, water w/ chicken boullion cube instead of chicken stock, white rice, and extra garlic - always! I also used a regular chef's pan with a lid because I don't have an electric skillet, and it was fine. I might add a dash of cajun seasoning or Old Bay next time, just to add some more depth to the flavor, but overall it was GREAT! Thanks Jenny!

This was a super-delicious dish!  The combination of juicy sausage, tender chicken and succulent shrimp really made it a complete meal.  Instead of removing the casings from the sausage, I just cooked them and then chopped them into one inch slices.  I also substituted real garlic for the garlic powder to give it a little more bite.

Give this recipe a try!  It was fast and easy to prepare, and tastes great.  We substituted a different type of smoked sausage(really wanted to try andouille in it, but couldn't find any), and left out the onions, but basically we stuck to the plan.  It didn't take all night to prepare & the taste really hits the spot. I'll make it again for sure.

Really good.  It tasted more like a chicken bog made in the south than a jambalaya.  Used beef smoked sausage.  Also cooked the chicken in the chicken broth prior to pouring it all together for the final simmer.

I thought this was easy to make and had some great flavors. The only reason it doesn't have 5 stars is because it is lacking spice. I added Cajun and Creol seasoning plus twice the amount of hot sauce. My family loved it.

This was great.  I think its one of those recipes that you can use as a guide and then use what ever you have on had.  I happened to have organic chorizo sausages, so I cooked them on high then added the chicken chunks.  When that was done I took the meat out and then added the onion to the pan.  Followed the rest, just used rotel because thats all I had on hand and we like it spicy.  I made it on ths stove top instead of an electric pan.

Made a few minor changes. Didn't use an electric skillet, just used a regular one on the stove. Also, left the juice in the tomatoes, and a couple more drops of hotsauce. Yummy!

Excellent recipe. Easy to fix. Tastes genuine. I added okra to make it a bit different. Recall that the okra will thicken to sauce too. Try it.

Great basic recipe, but needs to be jazzed up a bit. I used fresh garlic, added a chopped green pepper, and cut back on the chicken broth so it wouldnt be too soupy. I made it on the stove top, and simmered the chicken in the sauce, it gave it more flavor than adding it cooked. I added the shrimp during the last 5 minutes or so, and cooked the rice seperately. Added some cajun seasoning as well. Great recipe to build on....

Absolutely delicious. I followed the advice of others and added a little chicken broth but otherwise I followed it to the letter. This one's going into the rotation:)

Very tasty dish. Everyone had a second serving. I omitted the chicken, just used chicken sausage and shrimp. Added 3 small red bell peppers and 2 garlic cloves. Also used brown basmati rice instead of plain white rice. Yum!

Too much food and there was something not right about it - it was missing something - there was too much tomato and using the hot sauce to make it hot tasted fake.  I won't try this recipe again.

Awesome!!!  What a great base for a jambalaya!  I made some changes-added a red bell pepper- didn't use chicken at all- threw in some ham- used turkey smoked sausage - shrimp and basically cut the recipe in 1/2.  This is some of the best jambalaya I've ever made! Such a good and easy recipe to personalize!

I LOVE this recipe! I made this for a party & everyone commented on how much they liked it. I sometimes substitute minute rice for the long grained rice & I added some fresh minced garlic. EXCELLENT! Thanks for the great recipe! One of my FAVORITES!

This was fantastic! My first time making Jambalaya. My step mom who is the most picky eater, had seconds or thirds!. . .I've made this several times now. I added one diced green pepper, a few cloves of garlic, and doubled the rice, tomatoes, broth, and spices because otherwise it is just too meat dense (as much as I love meat).

Made this exactly but with our chicken sausage (ungrilled) and shrimp. It was easy, and good, but could use more tobasco sauce. I liked it, and it was good and easy. We burned the bottom of the pan though (badly) and ended up wasting a lot of rice.

My friend and I loved this Jambalaya! I actually cooked the rice first because I was afraid sausage and chicken would be over cooked, it turned out great.  I substituted salt with powder chick stock, it brought out a lot more flavor rather than just salty. It was very tasty! thanks for the recipe!

This was great - it was perfectly spicy but not too hot.  I did not have an electric skillet, so I just used a normal one.  I also left out the shrimp.

This recipe was marginal at best.  I used fresh garlic, and home canned tomatoes, but other than that followed the recipe.  We found this very bland.

This was great! I ALWAYS mess up Jambalaya when I make it, but this was excellent! I used what I had. I used a chopped green pepper, celery and chopped garlic(4 cloves, we love it!)with the onion. I used pieces of chicken,(drumsticks and thighs), and I only drained 1 can of the stewed tomatoes. I used andulluie sausage, shrimp,  and brown rice. So, the brown rice took a little longer to cook. At the end it wasn't to dry and it had a little gravy which was sopped up with corn bread. This was the best Jambalaya ever! Next time maybe I'll add some Okra? Thanks for the wonderful meal.

The guys loved this meal...it was each to make with out much work. I did change the recipe up a little. Instead of long grain rice I used brown rice, I did not have hot sauce, so I dispursed 2 tablespoons of red pepper flakes instead; which did just the trick and made it spicy, but still edible.n Instead of shredded chicken, I pre-cooked cubed chicken breast in a skillet. It came out great with tons of left overs....The boys loved it!

This turned out to be a great meal that everyone enjoyed. Made a few minor changes, first I used 3 cloves of fresh garlic and sauteed it with the onion. I used chorizo, but would have used andouille if I had found it, and used chickent thighs instead of breast for more flavor. I also added the liquid with the stewed tomatoes and just cut down on the chicken broth. Also, since shrimp cooks so quickly, I added it in the last five minutes of cooking. Next time I might try what one reviewer did with sauteeing the shrimp in the cajun seasoning and adding a bay leaf. Definitely a keeper.

Recipe is delicious as is.  I changed a few things to our preferences.  I changed the servings to 4.  I doubled rice and chix broth and added a can of green chilis instead of the hot sauce and added a little chopped celery for a veggie. I cooked on stovetop. Browned the sausage, took out of pan and cooked onion and celery in sausage oil rather than using olive oil. After onion/cel mix was soft, added tomato, meat, chilis, spices, rice and broth....cooked on simmer till rice was cooked then added shrimp at the last 5 min.

Delicious! It's kind of a by-gosh-and-by-golly recipe...  Taste as you go. I used celery, bell pepper and garlic along with the onion.  I used leftover rotisserie chicken and made the stock from the carcass and drippings first. I sliced and browned andouille sausage before adding to the rice mixture. For hot sauce, I used packets from Popeyes and Cajun seasoning from a hamburger joint that uses it on their fries. I used jasmine rice, because it's what I had. And like others, I added the shrimp a few minutes before the end, because I like my shrimp tender rather than chewy. The wining thing about this recipe is there is more meat and shrimp than rice and plenty of aromatics, making it hearty and flavorful.

This is a great, easy recipe!  I didn't have the precooked meat, so I cooked it with the onions at the beginning. I used Italian sausage and cut my chicken breasts in small chunks.  (Only b/c I was too lazy to shred). The amount of heat is just right for me, but I tend to like milder flavors, so if you want to add slightly more hot sauce it will work if that's your taste.  I will make this again and again, great recipe!

Not a lot of flavor - I would increase the hot sauce and add red-pepper flakes next time.  It was pretty bland.  This recipe makes quite a bit.  I'm hopefully it will taste better the next day.  I didn't have an electric skillet so I just used a regular one and simmered it on low with a lid - per the directions on the rice.

Awesome! Has become a family favorite. I used smoked turkey kielbasa instead of sausage and kept juice in the tomatoes. Yum!

Great recipe. I doubled the shrimp and used  the liquid from the tomatoes and a little more chicken broth. Also, cooked it on low in a dutch oven on top of the stove and it came out great. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! My 8yr and 11yr old daughters helped me make this and the whole family loved it! We cooked it on the stove top, I don't have an electric skillet. I also seasoned the chicken with Old Bay seasoning and baked it in a 375 oven for 2o minutes. Then shredded the chicken. Thanks for the great recipe! The girls want to fix it regularly, and that is saying something!

Fabulous!!  I used baby scallops instead of shrimp and I didn't drain the tomatoes.  I followed someone else's suggestion and used 4 cups of broth as well as 2 cups of rice...I was cooking for 4 adults and 3 children.  It was almost not enough!!

I'd never eaten nor made jambalaya before this recipe, but I am very glad that I did!  I used polish sausage, no chicken, and canned diced tomatoes.  Very yummy.  My husband and guests loved it!  Will make it at least every month for my family.  Thanks!

I loved this version of Jambalaya because I had most of the ingredients in the house already.  I added some giardinara when cooking the chicken and sausage to spice the dish up even more.  My husband loved it!

This was so easy and delicious!  I used kielbasa in place of the sausage because that is what I had on hand, that tasted great.  I also threw in some diced red and green bell peppers for a bit extra color and flavor.

I made this tonight, looking for something different. I followed the directions, except I used kielbalsa rather than turkey sausage, because that's what I had.  I'm sorry, but I gave it 2 stars because my hubby liked it.  The kids and I had grilled cheese for dinner.

This is a very good and easy recipe! I added 2 table spoons of Cajun spice and a teaspoon of fresh Basil. This gave it a more authentic New Orleans taste. Also, I added half of the shrimp closer to the nd of the cooking time. This made the shrimp more tasty but still melded the flavors with the dish. Excellent!!

This recipe is great!  I've made it twice now, and the 2nd time, it came out even better.  I tone down the spiciness, so my kid's will eat it, and they like it too! This would be a great meal for camping and cooking in a dutch oven.  I am going to try it sometime by prechopping the ingredients and putting them into Tupperware containers.  We have small fridge in our camper to keep things in.  Thanks for such a yummy recipe!!!

Wow this was very good!!!!! I will make this again for sure.  It was worth the high price of shrimp in Iowa!!!!  I had a hard time finding the right sausage I ended up going with a chicken apple sausage.  I am sure it would have been better if would have found something more "cajun" but you make due with what you can get. the best lower fat recipe I have found so far.

This recipe is great and it is simple.  I double the recipe and bring it to the pot lucks at work.  Only thing I changed was add more different types of meat.  5 stars for this one.

I followed the recipe except that I used hot italian sausages and large prawns in place of the shrimp.When I made this I was running out of time and had to get to work so I put it all in the slow cooker and set it to low and cooked it for 9 hours.The end result was a gelatinous mass,quite unappealing.The next time I cook jambalaya I'll use the recipe I found on here called Colleen's Slow Cooker Jambalaya,much better than this.

This was a great recipe.  My husband and daughter loved it, even though they were reluctant to try it at first. I used smoked turkey sausage in mine. Thanks for the recipe.

my husband really liked this. I added extra tabasco as we prefer spicy foods.
