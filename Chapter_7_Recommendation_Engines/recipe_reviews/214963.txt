I have made this recipe for 2 times now and this was delcious and tender. For the second time I added more yogurt and less milk and this consistency I liked more. Be sure to use spices in this recipe.

This was great for a smoothie that doesn't contain ice. That being said, if the banana had been frozen or a little bit of ice was added while blending it would have been much more refreshing. I'd never thought of using spices in a smoothie; they definitely give this smoothie some character! We will make this again and try it with those changes. Thank you for sharing!

I loved this recipe.  The cinnamon was really delicious. I halved the recipe and used the frozen banana chunks.  I also didnt have vanilla yogurt so I used peach yogurt.  Very filling and delicious!

I made this recipe for the first time a couple months ago for a Brinner Night. I doubled this recipe, used two frozen bananas, nonfat milk, and Stacy's organic nonfat vanilla yogurt. It was REALLY good and we all liked it. I remember thinking that this would make a really great summer smoothie ice pop, too!

Liked this and would make again.  Had several ripe pears I was trying to find a way to use.  Used 2 cut up pears without skins cut up, amended milk to non-fat (1/2 cup), amended yogurt to 1 cup plain non-fat (all I had) but added vanilla.  Thought of adding OJ but thought that might water it down.  Next time will substitute milk with OJ and see how that works.

Very tasty and refreshing. The only difference my boyfriend and I made was that we used frozen bananas and soy milk instead of regular. Overall a definite make again.

I LUV this. I usually always use bananas & some variety of berries in my smoothies so they all turn out to be almost the same.  I usually also use whatever fruit juice (always 100% juice) I have on hand which doesn't change things up that much.  I didn't think this smoothie sounded BAD but I didn't really think it sounded all that good either.
First off the changes I made:  I used soy milk (plain, 8th Continent brand) instead of cow's milk as a personal preference only.  Second, I left out the yogurt only because I didn't have any.

I thought it was fantastic and different.  Really loved it!  I have yogurt now so I will use it tomorrow as a filler and for the nutritional value.  I don't expect it to change the flavor that drastically, though.

I was gifted some Harry & David pears, and they are perfectly ripe.  I used a frozen banana and added a few ice cubes for our preferred consistency, but this was creamy and simply delicious.

I halved the recipe, used non-fat milk and yogurt, and frozen banana slices.  I liked this smoothie!  Every flavor came through...the pear, the banana, and the cinnamon.  Nothing was out of balance!

I added a handful of spinach to get a dose of greens. This was a great way to use a pear that was too ripe for eating. I am allergic to bananas, so used extra yogurt and oatmeal to thicken it up.

I really liked this smoothie. I never had a pear smoothie before. I used a red d'anjou pear. The only changes I made was making a 1/2 recipe to cut the calories and 1% milk. I also used a banana that was frozen, as I just prefer colder smoothies, and plain Greek non-fat yogurt with half the amount suggested as I find yogurt really dominant in smoothies. Thank you, I will make this again.

I have to admit to a certain ambivalence about smoothies, but this one is quite delicious and one I will make again if I have the right combination of fruits on hand.  Thank you Sarah-May!

A great way to start the morning.  I used frozen bananas and some very ripe pears with skin removed.  Loved it!!  Thanks for sharing, Sarah May.

Oooooooooo!  Had to make minor adjustments as all I had was rock hard country Asian pears.  Simmered about 30 minutes to soften...added vinalla extract instead of vanilla yogurt (used fat free yogurt) and multiplied recipe to make a gallon.  Will serve at the Retirement Home tomorrow...hubby already gave the recipe an enthusiastic 5 stars...me too!  Many kudos!!!  WOW!!!

I am seriously drinking this right now and i LOVE it!  I listened to the other reviewers and froze the banana overnight.  I used vanilla greek yogurt, soy milk, and fresh fruit.  The more tasty the fruit - especially the pears - the better the smoothie!  Mmm...this is sooo good! I will make again.

I didn't have pears so I improvised and used 4 strawberries and 1/2 cup blueberries.  Came out pretty good.  Freezing the banana is a good idea, next time.  I have to buy pears so I can make it with them next time.

I am not use to making smoothies but this was super easy and the blending was fast. The smoothie tasted really good and the consistency was nice and thick but not too thick. The only ingredient i didn't have was nutmeg but the smoothie did fine without it. I will definitely be making this again!

Loved it! I added ice because I like my smoothies cold. Kept all the other ingredients. And then because I'm bad, I added a tbsp of honey (maybe two). I just needed more sweetness. Maybe my pears weren't sweet enough! Overall a great recipe with the cinnamon and nutmeg!

I needed to make a few small changes, otherwise I would have given it a 5.

Like a previous reviewer, I used plain yogurt then added a little vanilla to make up for not having used vanilla yogurt. I found the recipe to be too sweet when using sweetened vanilla yogurt.

I find it to be more like Yop or other yogurt drinks in texture (i.e. thinner) as opposed to a smoothie, which I think of as a thicker drink. To thicken it a little I now replace 1/2 cup of the milk with an extra 1/2 cup of yogurt.

The spices really make the drink. 

This works great for our purposes, and my kids love it.

I halved this recipe and used frozen banana chunks. The smoothie was very light with a nice balance of flavors. Pear and cinnamon really do go together very well. I think I would have liked this smoothie a little bit better if it had been a bit thicker - maybe adding a little more yogurt would be nice.

I replace the banana and yoghurt with an avocado and use unsweetened almond or coconut milk (adding Splenda® or other sweetener, a tiny pinch of ground ginger, too. I'm diabetic), more healthy fats, potassium (avocados have more than bananas), less sugar. I only had Anjou pears.

This was really good! The combination of the pear and cinnamon really worked together. My only caution for others would be go easy on the milk - I eyeballed the amount I put in and it muffled the sweet pear flavor a lot - next time I'll try leaning more heavily on the yogurt and maybe try some non-dairy milk like soy or almond.

Yummo-licious!  This is so simple and easy, and is absolutely scrumptious!  The sweet pear flavor shines through.  Unless you LOVE nutmeg, go easy on it.

This is really good, I didn't have vanilla yogurt, so I subbed with some vanilla ice cream for a little sweeter drink. I also added a little extra banana for a thicker texture, but it was delicious.
