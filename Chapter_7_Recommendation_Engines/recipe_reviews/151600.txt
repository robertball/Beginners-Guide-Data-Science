I've been eating these my whole life! We do add brown sugar to this recipe.  My kids like to eat theirs with ripple potato chips in the sandwich, which adds salt and crunch.  It's good, I've tried it!

This is absolutely my husband's favorite sloppy joe recipe. He always asks for it. Sometimes I add dijon mustard if I have it on hand, but regular mustard suits him just fine. I also sometimes add chopped onions if I'm in the mood to chop them. We love this with potato chips and dill pickles.

I have been using this recipe for quite a few years but do not use the mustard.  Instead try it with sweet pickle relish (add to taste) or if you have picky eaters like I do just use the juice from a jar of sweet pickles or even (my wife likes this) dill pickles.

I thought this recipe was quite bland.  There wasn't much flavor to it and I ended up adding worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper and some sugar to add some flavor.

I made this because my daughter hates onions and peppers. My whole family ended up liking it. The taste and consistency was just right. The only thing  I did different was I added brown mustard to give it a little more spice. We also only eat wheat so we ate it on wheat buns. Thanks for posting.

Its 5 stars after I made some changes. This was a good foundation for sloppy joe but did not cut it for my family. These are the following modifications that I made: 1) added 1/2 orange pepper 2) 1/2 green pepper 3) 1/2 can of dice tomatoes (14 oz.) 4) minced garlic 5) 1/8 red cayenne pepper 6) sea salt and 7) worcestershire sauce. The cayenne pepper gives it a little kick. I cooked all the veggies in the soup until veggies where soft. The rest of the seasonings I tasted and then added.

Not very tasty.  Definitely needed more flavor.  Maybe sprinkle some onion powder.  I wasn't impressed.

fine - I had all ingredients on hand so I tried it.  Good but soupy.  Next time I will add more beef.  But the taste was good.
