Loved the water chestnuts instead of using celery.  The taste was wonderful and crunchy with the addition of the nuts.  Makes a beautiful presentation-I added avocado slices and egg white slices instead of whole egg and a light touch of paprika. Very pretty.

Delicious! Only gave it 4 stars because I added some grapes to it and chopped up the eggs and mixed it all up so I didn't make it as is.  Keeper in our family. Thanks for sharing.
