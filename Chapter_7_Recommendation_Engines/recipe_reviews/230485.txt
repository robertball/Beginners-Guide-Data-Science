I loved the sound of everything about this sandwich, but I was most excited about adding the sausage and marinara into the meatballs.  It took a lot of time to make all the different parts, but the result was a very tasty meatball sub.  Unfortunately the meatballs just weren't as interesting as I was hoping and they just didn't stand out against all the other ingredients.  Perhaps just a case of too much going on.

This was way too labor intensive. Anyone who make this must love to spend a lot of time in the kitchen.

My goodness, this was really good. The garlic basil sauce put this sandwich over the top.

Excellent! I didn't make the garlic basil spread. I just topped the sandwich with fresh basil. Very delicious! I also used vermouth (longer shelf life) instead of the Marsala wine. Will definitely make again! The family loved it!
