I followed the directions exact. I did use two cans of evaporated milk (the reason why I did this is because canned milk has always turned out a better outcome in the crockpot over "fresh" milk--I didn't want to worry about scorched milk and Healthy Choice cream of mushroom soup. Though we ate it, we all thought that the cream of mushroom soup flavor in this soup was off-putting and really didn't seem to belong. I think that ruined this recipe. I'm not much for low ratings as it breaks my heart to do so, but really......for us it wasn't good. I think if it was omitted, it would have a much better outcome. I'm very sorry.

I loved it!  I can't wait to used this recipe and and lots of different items.  Carrots, celery, etc...  Thanks for the recipe!

Oh and by the way.  I made it exactly as written.  I think it's wrong to change a recipe and then rate it.  :(  How is that a fair rating?????

My husband and I loved this chowder.  I did make a few changes.  I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of chiles, 1 can regular corn instead of frozen, 1 tablespoon hot sauce and a little more that 1/2 teaspoon of chili powder.  I also added about 1.5 cups of chedar cheese.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  I also served the chowder in bread bowls.  It was YUMMY!!

I have made corn chowder many times over the years but 
this recipe is THE BEST!  I wasn't sure my family would like
all the ingredients but I followed the recipe exactly and we
all gave this delicious, hearty chowder an A+!!  My husband
and my son said "put it in the rotation!" (a high honor in our house)  I already can't wait to make it again - served with hot crusty rolls - no better meal on a cold winter evening.
Thank you, Michelle, for sharing with us!

Wow!! Great recipe! I used one can cream of chicken and one of mushroom because i had those on hand. I used 2 cans of evaporated milk because i didn't want to use fresh milk. I used cumin instead of chili powder and omitted the hot sauce. I added diced carrots and 3 slices of pepper jack cheese. I did use only one can of regular corn instead of frozen because i was out of frozen. Very yummy.

I admit I made a couple changes, but this recipe turned out awesome! I only used 1 can green chili's, used 1- 12 oz can evaporated milk and water to make up the rest of the liquid, after reading other reviews,  I omitted the hot sauce since my man doesn't like super spicy and I used 5 real potatoes diced up. If I would have had more time I would cook it on low for probably 8 hours since I used regular potatoes but I did it on high for 4 and low for 2 and it tastes awesome!  I did add a little velvetta I had in the fridge too. I'm so glad I found this recipe! Lunch this week is going to be tasty! Thanks Michelle!

I changed a few items. Omitted green chiles because family doesn't like them. Used crm of mushroom and crm of chicken soup because it was what I had on hand. Cooked on high for 4-5 hrs. Onion was still a bit crunchy. Next time I will saute the onion in the butter before mixing and possibly add bacon for additional flavor. Also, I will cook on low for 4-6 hrs so the potatoes don't overcook. The flavor was very good!  -  lsragan

I took it to a church function and it was all the rave!  I added a jar of chopped up roasted bell peppers and used cream of chicken and cream of celery soup instead of the cream of mushroom since I don't like mushrooms.

I made this recipe many times , I have made changes to it though, 1) I used 2 cans cream of celery soup. cream of mushroom soup just doesn't go with all the other ingredients. 2) I used 2 cups cream & 1 cup milk. 3 cups milk is way to watery. cream is also sweeter and adds a nice thickness to the chowder. 3) no chile's were added , I'm from new England and chile's are original to the way chowder should be . 4) 2 cans of corn used instead of frozen. 5) 2 large russet potatoes used diced small. 5) 1/2 Vidalia onion used diced. 

I find these changes make for an excellent chowder that's closer to the original from New England.

It is so rare that you get a recipe that says it is spicy and it is actually spicy.  This one delivers the spice in spades.  I was prepared to be disappointed because so many recipes out there are bland, but I had some Honeybaked Ham left over from Thanksgiving and I thought I would give this a try.  It delivered.  Even my husband ate it all up.  We like spice, so we liked it, but I would have to cut the spice if I were to give it to anyone else.  Using the flavored ham from Honeybaked probably saved us from some of the blandness others mentioned.  I followed the recipe exactly, cooking it on high for just under four hours.  I didn't give it five stars because it took a bit longer to prepare than 15 minutes and the heat was even more than I really wanted. I also would probably use less onion next time (half instead of a whole).  All told, I will be making this again.  And again.

This was yummy!  I did alter it some to use ingredients to suit our tastes and lessen the spice. I used 3 medium peeled and diced potatoes, only one can of chilies, no hot sauce, and subbed in imitation crab for the ham. I also added old bay seasoning instead of the red pepper and diced a stalk of celery.  It completely filled my crock pot, so it makes a huge batch.  We topped each serving with diced crisp bacon. Cheddar cheese would also be a good addition!

This chowder was very good on flavor, however, next time I would cut the heat in half. It makes your lips burn..! I used Tabasco habanero hot so that could have been the issue. Otherwise, it was quick and easy! Would add some celery next time and think that bacon would be better than the ham. Love allrecipes.com

Super easy and super tasty.  I added the bacon crumbles toward the end as suggested, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  No need to alter it.  Big hit with everyone in the family.  It makes quite a bit so lots of great leftover for more meals.

Super easy to make and makes great leftovers! The only thing I would do different next time I make this is chunks of potato instead of shredded.

This was awesome. There is only 2 of us so I halved the recipe. I saw the reviews on the mushroom soup so I used a can of cream of mushroom/chicken soup combo I found at Redners. I added a sprinkle of cheddar cheese toward the end....who doesn’t like cheese!! We loved it...thank you!!

Absolutely loved it. I made a couple changes. I only put 1.5 Tablespoons of hot sauce. I used 3 cups of heavy whipping cream instead of milk. I didn’t have chili powder so I made my own (google it). Used 4 slices of cooked bacon.

We really enjoyed this, the only thing I changed was I left out the spices and added garlic powder, as we don't like the spices.
I also cut up 4 slices of bacon and tossed it in at at the beginning, and it turned out good, cooked for 4 hours on high.

Well, couldn't find the slow cooker so ended up making it in a Dutch oven on the stove. Also made a few changes so I'm not sure you will care about my review. I think cream of mushroom soup doesn't go with corn chowder, so substituted cream of celery. And used the Heart Healthy version, which saved some on calories. Used 2% milk which saved even more on calories. I left out the butter, which saved even more on the calories. Otherwise I followed the recipe, and enjoyed it very much! Only took about 1 1/2 hours, and that included simmering it for more than an hour. I recommend this if, like me, you like corn chowder enough to eat multiple servings!

Instead of hot sauce try chopped, roasted Annaheim chilis - just enough heat.  Like the others, I cut out the cream of mushroom soup  and used diced red potatoes.  You can never have too many onions.  I even replaced 1 cup of milk with heavy cream which made a very thick sauce  + 1 can of evaporated milk along with 1 cup of 1% milk.

I made this. I didn’t do it slow cooker but stove top. I substituted the ham for bacon. Cooked it first and tossed it in. I used all the other ingredients besides I used fresh already cooked corn rather than frozen. I made this for kids that love chowders so I cut the hot sauce in half and didn’t use the chilies. It was amazing!!

my whole family loved this. I made only the changes I had to due to what I had on hand. I used 2 cups cream and 1 cup milk instead of 3 cups milk.  I didn't have an onion so I used onion powder instead. I used 2 packages of already cubed ham because I didn't have any leftovers. Next time I make a ham I will make this again with those leftovers. I added shaved parmesan cheese to the individual servings. I also didn't have hot sauce so I used cayenne instead. cooked on low about 5 hours. so delicious!

This recipe made a large pot of soup.  The only ingredient I did not add was the hot sauce.  My adult son & I liked it very much.  Hubby did not.

Yum, so good on a cool day!  I did half milk and half cream. Sautéed onions and shallots and the hash browns(cubes) before putting them into the pot!  I only had 1 can of creamed corn, so added an extra cup of frozen corn. Used chives instead of parsley. I think this would work with just about any combo you wanted to use. Baby girl wants to try it with chicken instead of ham... hmmm

I added a block of cream cheese and used regular milk. It is so awesome -  my 3 teens rarely all agree on 5 stars! Served with a salad and bread. My husband (from MD) loved the (previous reviewer) idea of lump crab instead of ham. With Old Bay!

I’ve made this fabulous chowder many times. I have used evaporated milk every time, cream soups- I’ve used only mushroom, or a combo of whatever was in the cabinet- works either way. I have not used any potatoes at all, yummy. I have used fresh diced potatoes. Also yummy. I prefer smoked or country ham for flavor over sweeter ham, but they’re all good. The heat really does depend on which hot sauce you choose, and I’ve liked it every time. This is a big hit at potlucks, and a big hit at home. Thanks for posting this easy, versatile chowder!!!

I was running a little low on milk, so I used a cup of heavy cream that was leftover from another meal.  I also substituted smoked chipolte peppers which gave the chowder a nice, slightly smoky undertone.

This soup is good. We put some sour cream in ours once it came out and that made it better. I served it with croissant rolls and they were really good to dip in it.

I did really enjoy this and easy to throw together. I'm not sure that I was crazy about the frozen hash browns in it. Perhaps next time I would dice up some regular potatoes and throw them in for the last hour. It was very good though.

Fabulous!   I hate when people say they followed the recipe exactly except for this , for that, I substituted something else!    I,  however, did follow the recipe "exactly" except for the following (I am guilty too).   I only used half of the hot sauce and at the end I added a block of cream cheese too cool it down for my family.  Oh and I also added some bacon!   Delicious!!!

This was the first time I made corn chowder, and loved it! I didn't use the ham to make it vegetarian, adding more potatoes instead. 

I also didn't add the butter, hot sauce or chili powder. Otherwise, followed recipe as listed and used a sweet onion for the onion.  I'll definitely make this again!

I made some adjustments I used cream of celery because my household doesn't like mushrooms only used one can of green chilis and no hot sauce because I have a toddler. I didn't have parsley so I skipped that added garlic powder and used lactose free milk. Turned out delicious!

I made some changes based on what I had on hand and needed to use up.  It was delicious!   I had leftover Christmas ham and used 3 cups.  Substituted heavy whipping cream for milk.  I also did not have cream of mushroom so I added 2 cups of chicken broth.  (Probably would not have used cream of mushroom but cream of celery instead if I had it).   Also added 3 carrots, 3 celery stalks and 5 cloves fresh minces garlic.   No frozen corn on hand so used 3 cans yellow/white kernels and one can of creamed corn.  Also, had a 2 lb bag of frozen potatoes already cubed.   Added 1/2 cup of sherry and increased and added  seasonings with celery salt,  Tony's,  Zoe's Kitchen Spice of Life and 3 bay leaves.    Cooked on low for 6 hours.   At the end I thickened it up with 3 tablespoons of corn starch mixed in 3/4 cup chicken broth.   I normally don't make this many changes to a recipe and then review BUT I wanted to use up what I had on hand and not make a store run.   Only sharing because this is how you can take a good base recipe and improvise with what you have.  I am sure it was just as good as written.   This will be a post Christmas keeper when we always have a ham and other things we need to use up.  Thanks for sharing!

We make this at least once a year.  It's one of our favorite (and easy) soup recipes.  We do usually swap the ham out with bacon, but other than that, just use the recipe as is.

I made this exact except I forgot the ham. Other than that everything was the same. I LOVED this and so did my husband and his parents. I see some people didn't like it and I'm totally confused by that. I make recipes from this website quite a bit now and this one has the best reviews by my family thus far.

I used condensed milk instead of fresh.  Other than that, followed the recipe as written.  The chilis and hot sauce used will make a big difference in the heat.  I used one can of mild Hatch chilis and one can of hot.  I used Chohula hot sauce.  There was just a bit of heat which was nice with the sweetness of the corn.  Fresh jalapeno and Tobasco would be much hotter.   Very good!

Easy and delicious. Be sure to cook the onions first. I cooked them in the butter till soft. I was afraid of the milk curdling in the crock pot so I used 1 can evaporated milk plus enough water to the thickness I liked.

I made this with a few tweaks based on what I had on hand, but none that should have affected the flavor/my rating.  I used "fresh" frozen corn in place of creamed corn and homemade cream of soup.  I used one can of evaporated milk and 1 1/2 C 2 % milk.  Since I'll be sharing leftovers with my gram, I only used one can of chills and halved the chili powder (which led to a nice subtle heat; the full amounts would be great if you like spicy!)  My hash browned potatoes had garlic and white pepper already in the mix.  I used seasoned salt and white pepper to season.  While I love the ease of this, I found it a bit on the bland side.  My potatoes were overcooked (MY fault as it cooked on low for close to 12 hours, as an FYI).  If I made this again, I'd definitely use real potatoes.  I did toss in a cup or so of cheddar cheese (and additional seasoned salt) at the end of cooking after tasting to add some flavor.  THANKS for the recipe!

I've made this several times now and it has become one of our favorites. My wife hates mushrooms so we don't use the mushroom soup. Otherwise, we don't change a thing.

I tell you what, this is the best slow cooker dish I've made in a quite a while.  I halved it because I am by myself this weekend and it fit perfectly in my two quart slow cooker.  I omitted all the hot sauce, intending to add some to my bowl to taste.  But I had used hot diced chili peppers.  I also used a little chipotle chili powder because I was low on regular chili powder.  It had just the right amount of heat without hot sauce.

I added some shredded cheddar when serving, and made a skillet of buttermilk cornbread to go with it.

I will make this on a regular basis.  I think my 14 year old will love it as well.

I thought this was a wonderful soup, truly thick enough to be called a chowder. I used two 12 ounce cans of evaporated milk, as another reviewer suggested, and it did indeed make the chowder very thick. But my husband did not like it - said it was too sweet (perhaps because of the creamed corn).

Loved it. Made minor changes; substituted 4 cans of crab instead of ham 1 hour before finishing. Also added about 1/3 cup pre-cooked bacon and used 2 cans evaporated milk versus fresh. Simple and easy. Thanks!

This was soooooooooo good!!! I didn't have any green chiles and only used 1 can cream of mushroom. I added chopped bell peppers and did everything else exactly as written. We loved it! will definitely keep this one handy!

Fantastic!  

I doubled the potatoes just because I had some left in the bag so might as well throw it in.  And I threw in some velveeta because I also had just a little might as well throw it in.  Otherwise followed exactly and this chowder is amazing.
