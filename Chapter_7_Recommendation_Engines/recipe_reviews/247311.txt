Too much work for mediocre results. The boxed helper mix is just as good, sorry.

Easy and really easy to adjust if needed. Instantly becomes a favorite. I used 1.5 Lbs chicken and two packets of rice to have leftovers.

This was delicious! I used a mixture of Season All seasoned salt and chili powder for the seasoning blend. The only change I really made to the recipe was cooking the rice in chicken broth instead of water and cooking all the tomatoes instead of leaving half raw. Also, because I used seasoned salt, I left out the additional salt. I was surprised by how good this was. Don't skip the cilantro and tortilla strips. They added a great flavor and texture to it. (But it would still be yummy without those!)

Easy and quick!!! Exactly what we need for late night weeknight dinners! Full of flavor, and just enough vegetables to make it feel healthy as well.
