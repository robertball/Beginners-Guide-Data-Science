Okay I followed the advice of other reviews and added two tablespoons more honey, 3 Tbs vital wheat gluten, and substituted 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour for part of the bread flour.  And the result was a hearty healthy wonderful bread.  Next time I make it I will take it out before it bakes and bake it in my oven because I like the regular loaf pans better then my bread maker pan.  Thanks for the recipe.  This will deffinatly be something I save and use.   

I just made it again and didn't put any molassas in it just used honey instead and it was amazing,   Loved it!!

I tried this because I'm on Weight Watcher's.  It's a heavy, hearty bread that came out perfectly in my bread machine.  It might be too "hearty" for kids though.  My husband and I make it a couple of time a week.

This bread is REALLY yummy.  Lots of wholesome goodness.  I did change a couple of things.  I used 1/2 Cup whole wheat pastry flour for some of the bread flour.  I added 3 TBS of gluten to help with the rise and also had my bread machine knead the bread twice.  These changes resulted in a high, light loaf of wheat bread.  A real keeper!

This was great! Very wholesome and filling. I substituted wheat bran for the all-bran cereal, with good results. The bread over-rose on my machine's wheat cycle, so next time I will use the regular white cycle. Highly recommended!

I love this bread. I have a thick slice of it for breakfast every day.  I have made it a bunch. All my houseguests have enjoyed it as well.  I make a couple of changes - use half wheat and half white flour (1 3/4 c each), 1 3/4 c water, 3 tbs oil and 3 tsp yeast.  I also add 3 tbs gluten as I don't have bread flour, just all purpose.

I didn't notice this was for a 2 lb loaf and made it in a 1 and one-half loaf bread machine. But, still both my husband and I really loved it. It turned out great; moist and heavy, a man's (and this woman's) kind of hearty bread.

This recipe makes a moist, dense, high rise bread. The flavor is delicious and it has good crumb. Wonderful toasting bread and makes good sandwiches. I let the bread machine do the work, then shaped the loaf and baked in the oven at 375 degrees for 33 minutes in a 9X5 loaf pan. Thanks Jennifer. Great Bread!

Great texture, good taste. It rose up nicely, wasn't too heavy. Lacking a few ingredients, I made some substitutions. I used non-hygrogenated margarine instead of oil, skim milk instead of water and milk powder, and used All Bran for the cereal. Next time I'll maybe add a bit more molasses for a sweeter taste, and perhaps some ground flaxseed for extra fibre. Closer to 3 weight watcher points than 2, and that's not a very big piece, but still pretty good for bread. I'll definitely be making this one regularly. 

Tip for bread machine users - mix your flours and other dry ingredients ahead of time and store in airtight containers. When you want to make bread, just put in your liquid, dump in the container of dry ingredients and add the yeast. I generally have half a dozen batches made up in advance, saves time.

This is a very good, filling bread. I made it with honey only (no molasses) and put 1,5 tsp of yeast, as I was afraid the dough would rise beyond my bread machine capacity. It didn't with that amount of yeast. The next time, I'll use all the yeast called for in the recipe.

Thought it was a little heavy. perhaps another  TB of honey to add to the sweetness would also help. Fortunately it's only 2 points on weight watches.

I've finally found the perfect whole wheat bread. I added an egg the recipe and used the dough setting on my bread mixer. I shaped the dough into two round loaves and placed each on a greased cookie sheet and baked at 375 for about 33 minutes.I found this to be the most moist of all the grain breads I've tried and I will definitely be making it again.

This recipe was very good, however, it lacks sweetness and had a minor bitter taste.  I made modifications such as substituting granola for the bran cereal, powdered buttermilk for the powdered milk, and added 1 large egg which perhaps caused these taste.  The texture was fabulous and next time I will add a little more honey.  The powdered buttermilk is new to me, however, I have read that it adds great things to bread.  By all means, you should try this hearty bread.  Very filling.  A sure repeat.

Great Bread! I don't have a bread machine so I made it with the kitchenaide mixer and oven. It rose wonderfully and had a nice rounded top. Made this bread with 1 1/2 C milk instead of the water and powdered milk.  Also added 1 1/2 tsp Gluten for each cup flour and baked at 350 for 30-35 min. and brushed top with butter. Made one with the bran and molasas and another with only honey and no bran.  Both turned out very good.

Love this bread!  I followed it exactly except I didn't have any bran anything so I used one cup of "Honey Bunches of Oats" cereal.  Came out great!  It rose well, has nice coloring, great taste.  Even my four and three year old kids fight over any piece of this!  I made this while my husband was away on business and chances are there won't be any for him when he gets back, he'll just have to listen to us talk about how wonderful it was!

This bread uses healthy ingredients;  it is moist and has a nice texture and flavor.  You  can use different oat bran cereals as an ingredient, to vary the taste.  I baked this bread in the oven on a baking stone.

Nice bread with a great hearty texture and wholesome taste. I don't like things too sweet so I used only 1 tablespoon each of molasses and honey and then used only 1 teaspoon of salt. Use a good tasting bran cereal, one that you like, as this will make a difference in the taste of your bread. I crushed the bran flakes to a course consistency for better distribution and always use fresh ingredients for success. This bread made for great sandwiches and toast in the morning. In my opinion I thought it baked up to bakery quality and will be a recipe I use often.

I wasn't too crazy about this bread right out of the oven but I love it toasted. It's definitely the best whole wheat breat I've ever made. I have a 1 1/2lb bread machine and made the dough in that and then finished it off in the oven. I made two round loaves, let them rise 20 minutes and then baked at 375 degrees for 33 minutes.

This bread is the BEST!  I make it once a week.  I put it in the bread maker on the dough setting then bake for 33 min at 350F.  I often will add 1/4C Flax seed for additional texture.  This bread is dense and moist, everyone raves about it.

Just took two loaves of this recipe out of the oven and the verdict: delicious! I made the recipe as listed except that I made it by hand instead of the machine, used 1 cup water and 1/2 cup milk instead of the dry milk powder, and baked the two 1 lb. loaves at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes. I'll be making this again for sure. Thanks to Jennifer for the recipe!

Really good bread!  I used wheat bran instead of whole bran cereal, and should have put it in my machine right after the liquids.  I used the dough setting as I wanted to shape and bake my own loaf.  (After removing the dough from the machine, I let it rise for 45-50 min, then baked it for 30 min. in a 350 oven.)  This recipe could easily make 2 loaves.  I made one HUGE loaf and hubby and I both agreed that it's the best whole wheat/bran bread to come out of the breadmaker!

I followed the recipe exactly and the bread came out great. I used All-Bran cereal. Nice dark color and very nice texture. I'm sure I'll make this again.

I made this as is, only substituted butter for the oil.  I would perhaps add a touch more honey next time around to sweeten the bread just a bit more.  Very hearty.  Even hubby liked it.  Heck, even I liked it and I don't really care for very many breads.

Yummy Bread, with lots of flavor.  I highly recommend it!  I made it in the bread machine and then baked it in the oven.  Next time I will make two loaves instead of one.  It is very dense, but good.

This is both the highest whole wheat content bread we've every made and the best tasting bread maker bread.  It REALLY is high rise.  Very hearty.  More of a munching bread than a sandwich loaf.  Modified it by using a sourdough sponge and reducing the yeast.

A very good basic bread.  Only changes - cut the honey/molasses in half (diabetic) and used my dough cycle (don't like the shape loaf the machine bakes) and baked in the oven.  Have made this a number of times - it has never failed, and have added it to my "keepers".

Great bread! Very hearty, has the density of a batter bread, like banana bread. I am very happy with how moist it turned out. Hubby likes it with PB & J! I used Fiber 1 original and you can see chunks of that throughout the bread, looks cool. My 4 y.o. called this treat bread, now that's pretty awesome!

I love love love this bread, I hand make my breads so I bake it at 375 or 400 for 40 minutes. My ingredient subs are soy milk powder so it is not a dairy bread and agave instead of molasses. I also always have to add more flour to make it the right consistency, everything else is as is.

I've made this bread twice and it is delicious.  I didn't have molasses so I used brown sugar instead and it was yummy.  I used Kellogs All Bran for the cereal.  This will be a mainstay in our household!

I slipped a bit with the molasses (about 1 Tbsp extra) and ended up with a golden loaf fragrant with molasses. I think I'll 'slip' again next time! I love that I can give my family a bread that's not only delicious, but chock full of wholesome goodness too. My kids don't like All Bran, but it disappears into the bread so they don't even know they're eating it!

Great recipe! I substituted skim milk for the milk powder and water and used different types of grains instead of the bran cereal. Very versatile recipe, but more for adults than kids (the taste was too hearty for my two) Thanks

I gave this recipe two stars.  I followed the recipe as suggested and it didn't turn out very well.  It was very heavy, did not rise to a 2 pound size.
The taste was good, but I wont be making it again.

Wonderful bread with great flavor and texture. Mine sunk down in the center a little but maybe I put the ingredients in the wrong order. Will check my machine book.  

I added 1/4 cup 7 grain mix for crunch (I get this at the bulk food store near me). You could also use raw sunflower seeds.

Thank you for providing me with a delicious bread recipe that I will use over and over!

I used whole wheat pastry flour, added a couple of tablespoons of wheat gluten and baked it in the oven at 375 for about 40 minutes. I also added a little more yeast, maybe 1/2 teaspoon because as I looked at the recipe it didn't seem to have enough yeast. I think it would have risen fine without the extra yeast though. I used a bread machine to prepare it and used the whole wheat setting.

This is just what I was looking for - a dense, healthier bread that would be great with honey, for pre-workout and pre-run carbs.  I made just a couple of substitutions:  nonfat milk in place of water, since I don't have dry milk, and coconut oil for vegetable oil.  I used  a combination of All-Bran, wheat bran meal and 10-grain cereal.  I also used the dough setting on the bread machine, and baked it in the oven (350 for about 25-30 minutes).

I thought this bread was wonderful and made the most delicious French Toast!  My mother-in-law tried it and now I have to make her a loaf.  I think I will try the suggestion of adding an additional 2 Tbsp of Honey - sounds even yummier!

This is an incredible bread. It is a 2 lb bread and looks beautiful I followed the directions except I did not have dried milk so I just substituted a few tablespoons of the water with milk. This is our favorite wheat bread. Thanks Jennifer

Made this bread with the following changes.  
- Added 3 T gluten.  Made the bread q bit too chewy.  I'll try 1 - 2 T next time.  
- Added 2 T white sugar because someone said it needed to be sweeter.  It is a bit too sweet now, omit next time.  
- used less whole wheat and more white as suggested.  Will stick with that.  
- Added 2 T flax seed, ground it with the bran flakes in a magic bullet.  Liked that, gave the loaf a nutty flavor.  
- Made by hand using 1 ceramic bread pan.  Took about 45 minutes to bake at 375.

Just made this for the first time; I used a lemon flavored olive oil for the vegetable oil, and I like to add millet, flaxseeds, and sometimes other seeds to the bread recipe, and I did that with this one, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I thought it came out very good. I have put it into my favorites file, and will make it again!

This is WONDERFUL bread. I threw in some ground flax, and used wheat bran instead of bran cereal, but otherwise followed the recipe as stated. I used the dough cycle and then baked the bread in the oven. Fantastic! I got 2 medium sized loaves out of this recipe.
