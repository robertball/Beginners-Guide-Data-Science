Made this to take camping and it was a very classic version of trail mix.  Divided into snack size baggies to grab and go.

This is a very simple yet good combination. I had all the ingredients but the cashews and decided to make it. I have my own recipe for something similar, but wanted to try an Allrecipe's recipe. The added almonds were great. I doubled the recipe, but kept the amount of raisins the same. I also subbed half the raisins for dried cherries and just used about a 4oz bag of M&M's or one of the $1 packs. Thank You

Exactly what I was looking for, the ratios are perfect!  I used roasted & salted cashews & almonds and dry roasted peanuts.  I had a big bag of M&Ms so I just measured a heaping 1/4 cup of candy, which was a little more than the 1.69 ounces, but I won't complain about a little extra chocolate!  I doubled the batch and can't stop munching on it!  If you just want to make up a small batch of this, I recommend buying the nuts in bulk (much cheaper in the long run) and then freezing them.  Each time you make up a batch, measure the frozen nuts and then mix in fresh raisins & M&Ms... the nuts will keep fresh for a long time this way!  UPDATE 9/13/12:  Made this recipe again today only switched the measurements for cashews and peanuts - I used 1/2 cup dry-roasted peanuts and 1/4 cup of cashews... a little more economical that way!  And I used fall-colored M&Ms  and put the mix in a jar - now it's not only a great snack, it's a pretty fall decoration on my countertop!

I replaced the peanuts with sunflower seeds, otherwise it's all the same and delicious.

I taught this recipe to my group of cub scouts and they all loved it. I replaced the almonds with chex mix and pretzels. Great, versatile recipe for a hiking and camping snack!

This was great. I didn't have some of the ingredients, so I improvised. It all worked. I subbed pecans for cashews. Used peanuts and almonds. I did add more peanuts, due to my preference. I also added a bit more salt, since the nuts were unsalted. It came out well. Loved it. This is a keeper. Pretty good ratios.

very traditional trail mix.  Good ratio of ingredients, but a little bland.

Great Mix, I also put in 1/2 cup of other mixed nuts that I had in the house and filled up the empty 16oz empty peanut jar perfectly!

I have been buying this same exact Trail Mix from Costco for years. One of my favorite trail mixes of all time. I did make it once, but nuts are so ridiculously expensive in the U.S. it became clear to me quite fast that it is more economically sensible to continue purchasing from Costco.

I can't believe I never made my own trail mix before this!  I made a couple of substitutions per my own tastes: pecans instead of almonds and 1/4 cup golden raisins in place of the M&Ms.   Perfect!  I'm looking forward to trying more alternative ingredients/combinations now!! :-)
