This was very good! The dressing is tart and fresh and went very well with all the ingredients. I used jalapeno stuffed green olives and I added a roasted red pepper. I also used fresh herbs in the dressing and a cut up tomato from my garden.  Thanks for a nice lunch, Lela! :)

PERFECTO!   I made this exactly as written and it was a perfect balance.   I was worried that my missus wouldn't like the olives or lemon juice, but they were just the right amount for her that she actually commented about it.   And I have more of a sour/salty taste than my missus, but it was just enough for me too!   We did have fresh from the garden tomatoes, so that helped and I had to use two pita halves to make wholes.   It's all my store had.   We WILL make this again and I might try to incorporate some capers with it, just to try.    Thank you Lela for another great recipe!

The flavours were great. The only change I made was to substitute an Italian cheese blend for he mozzarella to add more flavour. There was, however, way too much oil in this recipe, in my opinion. In the future, I would cut the oil by half at least, perhaps even more. Thanks for a delicious and quick dinner idea!

Great meatless meal. As others did , I cut the olive oil to 4 tblspns. Used 3 pitas so we had enough. Used fresh garden basil and spinach along with minced garlic. I think you can add anything u want to this. Since my wife liked I will definitely make again. Feta cheese does not melt so don't be concerned. I cooked for ten mins on a pizza stone at 375.

Excellent base, though I made a few minor changes. First of all, no garlic powder. I finely minced three fresh garlic cloves instead. The pungent flavor is irreplaceable. Second, I added a small amount of chopped pepperoni, more for a flavor enhancer than to make it a "meat pizza." Lastly, I used black olives since they are my personal preference. Yum!

Used fresh minced garlic, 4 tbsp. olive oil, Foldit flatbread to save calories, and Greek kalamata olives because I love the flavor. Delicious.

I love an easy recipe that's healthy too. Good flavor, but I cut back on the olive oil to 4 Tablespoons, which was plenty. Thanks for sharing! I will make again.

These personal pitas have such nice depth of flavour.  My daughter asked for the recipe so she could make them for herself when she goes back to University.  I left off the olives do to personal preference but I can see that they would add even more salty tang to the pizzas. These cooked up nicely in my toaster oven, I just watched them after about 8 minutes and once the cheese was melted the way we like they were ready and perfectly yummy.  Thanks Lela!

This is an excellent recipe. I made this with my child and our whole family loved it. I was concerned that there wasn't any pizza sauce involved but it's no necessary at all. Everything tastes fresh and bright. We made another round with pepperoni on top and it was just as good. A very easy and tasty dinner!

My wife and I loved these pizzas.  I made several changes and additions to my recipe.  I used kalamata olives and fresh garlic.  I also used pesto as the base layer on the pitas.  I included toasted pine nuts and artichokes.   It turned out great.

Burst of good flavor! Nice crispy crunch on crust too.  I didnâ€™t have feta so I substituted 1 tbsp Parmesan.  Also, I added some thinly sliced cooked chicken breast that was in the frig.  Delicious!

I made this for my son as a quick lunch. For the base I used a few tbsps of pizza sauce I had left over, olive oil, minced garlic and Greek seasoning. For the toppings, red onion, green pepper, mushrooms, black olives, Feta cheese, and mozzarella cheese. I broiled the pizza for a minute on the end just to brown.

This was excellent.  I used garlic naan bread, and it came out great.  Like others said, just cut back on the oil a bit and it's perfect.  Quick and easy meal for Mediterranean diet.

I didn't use all of the oil mixture and used less spinach.  Also replaced green olives with kalmata olives.  I didn't really like it and won't be making it again.

Made this for supper tonight and we loved it. I made 8 pitas and adjusted all ingredients  fairly accordingly except for the olive oil, only used 8 tablespoons and found it sufficient. Not a fan of  green olives so left those out but otherwise followed the recipe. This one definitely goes into the menu rotation!!

This was delicious! I made it exactly as written except I had added fresh garlic. The lemon juice mixture is light and a perfect contrast to the saltiness of the olives and feta. I  will definitely make this again!

It tastes great so long as you like olives, because they really dominate the flavour. I'll do less olives next time.

I didn't have pita bread but had everything else, so I made this with a regular personal pizza crust.  SO GOOD!  I used fresh oregano and basil cause I had it growing in my garden.  YUM!

This was GREAT!  My daughter and I made these together, very easy.  We added onion and tomato and kalamata olives!  We wanted more :)
