The cheese was extremely clumpy and had a bland taste.

for what this is- quick comfort food- i thought it was excellent. i will be packaging up the ingredients in premeasured baggies  to send to school with my two college students, and am also considering this as a new lab for my senior strategies class- where we teach our kids how to survive the first year away from home.  my daughter suggested the substitution of pepper jack cheese, i used monterrey jack and the parmesan. good, fast food, all natural, no scary packet of orange powder.

This is a good and easy recipe. This is not a typical man n cheese, its more like a spiced up butter macaroni. Not a cheese sauce. Really easy though and tasty for a quick meal. Thanks!

I didn't have mozza cheese so I used old cheddar - I also omitted the meat because I had none of that too. But I followed the recipe exactly for everything else and MMMM MMMM MMMMM, I love mac and cheese and this is one of the best I've had! Great comfort food ;)

This mac and cheese would certainly work for a child's lunch, which seemed to be the submitter's purpose. My children would have enjoyed it better with a slice of pasteurized American cheese, but cheeses are easy enough to exchange. I did have to add a little more milk to make it creamy, and I used crumbled bacon since I didn't have any sausages.  Quick and easy to make using pantry/frig ingredients.
