waaaaay TOO cream cheesy........not REAL italian alfredo.
That can NOT be the olive garden recipe.  I know for a fact they use real garlic and parmesan.
  
Try this- it's MUCH closer..... 
1 pint heavy cream, (1/2 and 1/2 is good too) 1/2 cup real butter, 2 tblsp. cream cheese, 3/4 cup of shredded parmesan, 1 large or 2 small cloves garlic chopped.  Simmer all ing. (except parmesan) on LOW for atleast 20 minutes (stir occasionally) - add parmesan last, melt completely, then season to taste with salt and pepper.

uhm~??~ regarding the last comment posted... this must be Fazzoli's recipe. My Husband is a Director of Operations for the O.G. restaurants and I can assure you although this is a good recipe.. this is not there's. It's missing a few very important ingredients like for starters  PARMESAN CHEESE and the OG's would be hard to 'exactly' duplicate as they have a few secret ingredients (sorry) .. and no cream cheese @ all... I was looking for a lighter sauce that is not as heavy .. and this was good but I did add Parmesan and no garlic 'salt'.. just a lot of fresh garlic and it was good. .. and quick.. thnks!

Disgusting! I have no idea how so many people rated this so highly! I decreased the cream cheese to 1/2 cup and used heavy cream instead of half and half but it still tasted SWEET and overpoweringly of cream cheese! When I think of Alfredo sauce, I think garlicy, not sweet! I couldn't eat this and add to add A LOT of spices and crushed red pepper just to make it somewhat edible for my husband. My husband said that the "restaurant" this recipe came from must have gone out of business if the rest of the food was this bad.

I use this recipe and found very fast and easy.  I did add a few of my own touches such as sauted garlic and onions; parmesan cheese and real lemon zest and fresh ground pepper and touch of white wine.  The next time I will try fresh ground nutmeg.  I will never by store bought again.  This also works with 2% Milk just added a little more butter and cream cheese.

This is very rich sauce. I would recommend that you only use 1/2 cup of cream cheese. Consistantly stir this sauce, I found it to get lumpy.  It also needs more flavor.I will try another sauce next time.

I thought this sauce was very authentic and yummy!  It seemed a little rich, so I added a little more half & half, then it was perfect sauce.  Will use it again!

This was a good start.  I added 1 cup of parmesean cheese and upped the half and half to a cup and cut the cream cheese to 1/2 cup.  A little fresh garlic and this was delicious!

This is wonderful!  Tastes just like real alfredo sauce and is nice and creamy.  I made extra and put it in the freezer--was easy to thaw and toss with pasta.

Great sauce! I made the recipe for 6 (still only 12 oz pasta). I whipped the sauce together in my Kitchen Aid mixer first.

Next time I plan to melt the butter (I used margarine) and then cream it with the cream cheese (I used Fat Free, turned out GREAT!) before adding the half and half and the spices. 

I used an 8 oz block of cream cheese and 1.25 cups of half and half.

For the other people that said the flavor was too mild, they just need to add more seasonings. I just kept adding more lemon pepper and garlic until it was tangy and yummy.

After cooking the sauce and the pasta, I mixed it all together and left it for a few minutes to soak up the flavor. YUMMY!

Will definitely make this recipe again. Thanks!

This was absolutely wonderful!!  My super picky 4 yr old loved it, and so it's a keeper.  I made sure to use the double broiler, and was able to melt the cream cheese all the way - that was the key to keep it from getting lumpy.  I used milk insead of half and half, and the consistancy was good.  To get the flavor, you need to add the galric and lemon pepper to YOUR taste.  Just keep adding a dash until the flavor suits you. I  also added 3 TBS of fresh grated parmesan cheese, and my DH and I thought it added a lot.  This will be someting we make consistantly!

A very simple, tasty recipe. I did omit the garlic salt and added 4 cloves minced garlic and 1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese. It was a hit with those changes.

This really was a good recipe.  We changed a few things though. We used 1/2 cup of cream cheese, 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese, 3/4 cup of 2% milk instead of cream, 1 Tablespoon flour, 1 tsp fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt, salt and pepper to taste instead of lemon pepper.
It turned out very good! Thanks for the recipe!

I have been searching for a good alfredo sauce recipe (for my boyfriend who loves fettuccine alfredo) and I have definitely found a winner with this one.  The flavor was excellent!  The only reservation my incredibly picky boyfriend had was that the cream cheese stayed slightly lumpy (I didn't even really notice!).  I think next time I will use a double boiler to melt it down slower.  I paired this meal with some homemade focaccia bread and a bottle of red wine.  Overall, this recipe is nothing short of outstanding - not to mention so quick and easy!

Wonderful!  I only gave it 4 stars as I think it would have lacked something as written, but I took other reviewers' advice and added 4 cloves minced garlic and about 1/2 cup fresh parmesan. I also added about 1/2 cup chopped sundried tomatoes, and with these changes it was incredibly creamy, even though I used 2% milk instead of half and half.  Awesome recipe that received RAVE reviews!

Very good alfredo sauce.  I gave it 4-stars as I added a little Parmesan Cheese to thicken it up.  I had some leftover pasta noodles and served the sauce over the pasta rather than stirring it in.
Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Not bad considering how simple it is. I guess the real stuff calls for more ingredients. This suited me because I am not a good cook and have litle patience. No time for fancy shmancy. I will try the other reviewers recipe when I get the time.

I think it is a decent recipe; I like the flavor the cream cheese adds, but I would also decrease it and maybe add some other cheeses. Thanks for the recipe!

This was alright. I'm not a huge fan of alfredo, but it was the only thing I had all of the ingredients on hand for and I couldn't eat meat (Friday during lent), so I decided to give it a try. It was a little too cream cheesy for my taste. I love cream cheese, but in a hot pasta dish, not so much.

I don't really know what I think of this recipe. At first, when I was eating it, I thought it was good, but it was SOOO cream cheesy, by the end it was just too much. My boyfriend liked it though. I used only 1/4 cup of butter, and low fat cream cheese, and I thinned out the cream with a little milk just because it was alot of fat! I would suggest maybe adding a little white wine, that might cut some of the over powering cream cheese taste. I think this recipe has the potential to be really good, but it's just not quite there yet. Maybe 1/2 of cream cheese, and 1 cup of cream would have been more appropriate. I'm not really sure...

This recipe rocks!! I made some slight modifications by adding sauteed onions and chopped garlic to enhance the flavor and it turned out wonderfully!!  My family loves pasta and they loved this sauce!!  Thanks so much for posting this recipe... I'll definitely be making this again.

This is very similar to my alfredo. I do not use lemon pepper and I add a 1/4 cup of Parmesan Cheese. Also I use minced garlic or garlic powder rather than garlic salt. Regardless, this is a fab sauce!

I tweaked this recipe a little.  I upped the half and half and cut back on the cream cheese.  I also added some garlic salt.  Next time I will cut back the butter a little.  My kids loved this, I will make again.

The sauce wouldnt mix well. It had to much butter and tasted to much like the cream cheese.

I run an after shool program and our kids cook one day a week. We made this last night and it was a hit! The kids wanted to go back for seconds and thirds!!! We only altered the recipe in that we added less cream cheese and used heavy cream instead of half and half. Also, we used smaller noodles. It was delicious!!!! Thank you!

I thougth this was a little greasy and heavy.  The ingredients were right, but I changed it to make it more figure friendly.  The first batch I made according to the recipe, it was greasy and kept separating.  The second batch was much better, and lower fat and calories too!  For the second batch I used half the butter and a light cream cheese.  I melted them in a sauce pan and then added flour to make a roux.  I allowed that to cook for a few minutes to eliminate the floury taste.  Then, I added skim, yes skim!, milk and parmesan and garlic.  Seriously, this version went over better with the fam than the first!  (And I'll feel better serving them this alfredo more often!)

Sorry but nobody in my family enjoyed this.  Way to "cream cheesy".  I even took others advice and used fresh garlic and 1/2 cup parmesan.

This was very good with a few changes. Add 3 cloves fresh garlic instead of garlic salt, 1/2 C. of fresh grated Parmesan, and 1 T. of dried basil. I also used 6 T. of butter instead of 8, still was great.

I thought this was way too sweet tasting.  I put less than half of the cream cheese.  Used whipping cream.  Added fresh garlic and onions.  Added parsley.  I did not have any parm to put in it, so that might have helped.  Now, after all of the negativity, my kids loved it.  Go figure.

My husband acutally made this recipe and it turned out great.  Easy to follow instructions.  We acutally made just the sauce to use in another recipe.  I tasted it before we used it in the other recipe and it was some of the best alfredo I have ever had.  YUMMUY!!!

This was ok. Not exactly like Olive Garden though.  I ended up using Romano and Parmesan cheese and put in several cloves of garlic and it tasted better. I think it is a good basic recipe but you need to spice it up a bit. It also barely makes enough for 4 people using just a moderate amount of sauce. Double the recipe if you have hungry people eating!

This was a really great sauce. My husband is very picky and he loved it!! I've made this twice so far and the second time I didn't use as much cream cheese and it was even better.

I loved it!  I couldn't believe how fast it was to make and I didn't have to chop up garlic or add a ton of parmesean!  I trimmed some of the fat by cutting the quantities in half and diluting the half and half with milk. The concept was there and the cream cheese tasted great in my opinion.

I made this for dinner last night...we LOVED it!  Even my pickiest eaters wanted seconds.  I made mine with 1% milk, since that was what I had, and it still turned out great.  I cooked it in a double boiler.  It takes a little longer to cook this way, but I think it made it creamier.  I just started the sauce before I started the pasta and they were both done at the same time.  Great recipe!!!

I did not use garlic salt. I sauteed a little fresh minced garlic and a little fresh minced yellow onion before adding the rest of the ingredients. I did need a little more milk than what was called for because the sauce was a little too thick. The family all liked it.

This turned out very well.  I often use condensed milk in lieu of half and half, for I always have it on hand. It worked fine, here.  Almost all alfredo recipes include parmesan cheese, so I added about 3 tbsp.  That, too, served well.  Having been a scientist, I wanted to run a "control", so I bought a jar of Classico alfredo with sundried tomato, to compare (at almost $3.00).  I gave the edge to the Classico, but mainly because of the tomato: otherwise, mine was just as good, and much more economical.  Very useful recipe.

My family loved this sauce! I had to make a few changes because I was lacking a few ingredients. I used 1 Tbsp lemon-infused oil and white pepper instead of the lemon pepper, 1 can evaperated milk instead of half-and-half. I also used 8oz cream cheese. After this experiment with the evaperated milk, I'll never use half-and-half or cream to thicken again. The texture and taste were amazing, and no saturated or trans fats! Thank you so much for this recipe! Easy, fast and soooooo good!

I only gave this four stars because if I hadn't added my own adjustments this would have tasted somewhat bland to me.  Here is what I changed and added. I cut the cream cheese to 1/2 cup and added 1/4 cup fresh grated parmesan.  I added much more garlic salt than a pinch (but I love garlic salt) and I added salt and pepper to taste as well. With my adjustments I just loved this recipe and it's extremely easy to make which means I will make it again and again.

This had entirely too much cream cheese and that is all I could taste in it. There is no way this OG recipe, don't know if that's the one indicated as the popular chain but there is not way it could be. OG has garlic and nutmeg in it, the nutmeg is that nice hint of flavor at the end.  Thanks for the recipe but we didn't like it.

Very good flavor.  Only problem (may have been the cook) but the cream cheese was lumpy.  I bought a generic kind because the reg kind was over $2.  Maybe next time I will get the kind I usually use???

I made this recipe as is and it was excellent.  The only thing wrong was something I did...I put the sauce on the pasta too far ahead of serving it and it sort of all got absorbed into the pasta.  It would be best to pour the sauce on immediately before serving.

We didn't think this had enough flavor. Or sauce. Will need to double the recipe. We do want to try this again with a twist somehow. We didn't have any cream cheese so we used grated cheese instead. Served it with grilled chicken and garlic bread.

Easy to make.  Kind of bland though.  My kids liked it when I topped it with shrimp scampi.  Very hard to find things they will eat, so that was a plus.  Very cream cheesy.

I have to agree with one of the reviewers that this recipe came in with too much cream cheese coming through in the flavor. I did try some different amounts of the spices. It will need some time to sit in order to thicken properly.

I love this creamy version of the alfredo sauce. Very creamy the flavors are great but would have loved a little more garlic flavor. Just add minced garlic and it's even better.

If you leave out the lemon pepper it's not bad. You will need to use more liquid to thin the sauce, otherwise it's tooo thick.

After a few bites the sauce was sickly sweet. Adding parm cheese cuts the sweetness down and would turn this into a 5 star success. The cream cheese gives a nice thick texture and richness. Add more cream if it becomes too thick for your personal preference. When reheating some milk or cream really re-smoothes the sauce evenly over the pasta. This recipe is a keeper for a rich sauce without the flour texture of roux based recipes.

Whew! WAY too cream cheesy. If I had this sauce in a resteraunt I would probably send it back. It IS quick and easy, I'll give it that, but if you're looking for authentic alfredo you won't like this recipe.

wow!! This was outstanding. I used the sauce for another recipe I found on allrecipes, Lasagne Spirals. That recipe called for spag. sauce but I thought alfredo would be better, so I made both. My husband is an Italian food freak and loves spag. sauce. Well he tried the alfredo one and he couldn't believe how great it was. He put the spag. sauce one back and ate only the alfredo one. It made this recipe taste just like it came from a restaurant!! It is rich though. I think I will try alittle less cream cheese next time. I could only eat a small portion, very filling. All 4 of my kids loved it!

LOVED IT!! I never knew you could make alfredo sauce with cream cheese! It was wonderful and very easy to make...I did add a little parmesean cheese as well, just to give it a little bit of the parmesean taste but this will definately be the alfredo sauce I make from now on.

Good lord is this good. Consistency was right on, not lumpy and not too thick (as long as all the cream cheese was melted and stirred). When completed I added thawed broccoli florets directly into the sauce for 5-8 minutes stirring occasionally and the flavor sure showed. Sprinkled fresh pepper on at the end and it was DELISH!

I thought this sauce was too "cream cheesy" tasting, so I added a whole, raw clove of garlic into it for a few minutes and it turned out wonderfully!  It added a great garlic flavor and cut down on the cream cheese taste.  Next time I make this I will add roasted garlic and sundried tomatoes.  Did I mention, that I fished out the garlic before I served the pasta?

If you want a super simple alfredo sauce this will do in a pinch this recipe is great. I had to add parmesean cheese and I wouldn't say it compares to Olive Gardens' but a lot better than the jar sauces and just as easy. Perfect for a quick & easy meal. I'll keep looking for OG's recipe though.

This recipe was delicious!  It didn't turn out lumpy for me at all.  I used a glass bowl and put it over a boiling pot of water to melt the butter and cream cheese together.  I wisked in milk instead of half and half and I also added  3 TBLS of parmeson cheese.  It was very smooth and very creamy.  I also added the spices to my own taste.  It turned out wonderful!!

I didn't find this recipe very good.  It was very chunky and tasted very strongly of cream cheese. I added some parmisan cheese and lots of seasoning to kinda help it out.

Tasted very good. Hubby liked it. But I thought that it was a bit lumpy. I'm not sure if this is the same restaurant chain recipe that I thought it was.

You would need to triple this, at the very least, for a pound of pasta.

I did not like how much this tasted like cream cheese so while I was cooking I added a little of this and a little of that. (I’ve never been able to follow a recipes well...) In the end it was sooooo yummy!  A lot more half and half,   sautéed onions, broccoli-baked in the oven first, vegetable broth, a bit of vanilla almond milk (that’s all I had), a lot of salt and pepper, parsley, and parmesan cheese. Plus I used penne noodles instead of fettuccine.

I made this, exactly the way the recipe called for it and it's nowhere NEAR what Carino's tastes like. It simply tastes like seasoned melted cream cheese.  The second it started cooling, it went from a creamy consistency to a clumpy, nasty consistency.  I would definitely recommend finding another recipe!!!

I love this recipe! I have made it several times and decided to give it the credit it deserves. I like the idea of using cream cheese, #1 because I usually always have it on hand, #2, I love the flavor it brings, and #3, because neufchatel works well and is lower in fat. Very easy, and super tasty. I added about a 1/4 cup of parmesan and I didn't use garlic salt (yuck!). I used 2 cloves of minced garlic instead with sea salt.

This is not the Earls recipe which has whey powder and other ingredients in there and no cream cheese. The cream cheese in this recipe thickens it which the whey powder in the Earls recipe did instead.

I liked the recipe a lot, but I added a few changes. I added half as much cream cheese and a cup of parmesan cheese. but besides that..... I liked it very much.

good base, I added Creole seasoning, and used a different type of cream cheese(not in the US, so I don't know what exactly it was), so I could see how some people thought it was tasted too much like cream cheese. Mine turned out fine.

I use cream cheese in creamy sauces all the time and have never had it taste sweet.  I don't know what kind of cream cheese was used that made a reviewers sauce taste sweet but I have never had a sweet plain cream cheese.  I prefer more garlic and seasonings and use chicken broth and white wine instead of milk and skip the butter except for sauteing vegetables to add to the sauce.

I reduced the cream cheese by half and increased the half and half to a cup along with the parmesean cheese. I sautéed a large shallot and clove of garlic as well. Added a little prosciutto. Net I liked the texture but could still taste a bit of cream cheese so not for me. My family loved it though so I will continue to tweak it. Was very easy to make.

Great recipe! I am a garlic lover, so when I added the butter I also added 3 cloves of fresh garlic and sautéed for a couple minutes then followed the recipe exactly. My 8 year boy said mom, you need to use this sauce every time!!! Thanks for sharing :)

This was horrible. I took the advice of several reviewers and reduced the cream cheese, but that flavour still dominated, without any other interesting flavours to mitigate it. Plus it was a calorie bomb, and it's such a drag to eat something that's not just unappetizing but bad for you.

This sauce was so good! My kids loved it. It was pretty rich, so next time I might use only 1/2 cup of cream cheese. But, we will be making this a lot!
