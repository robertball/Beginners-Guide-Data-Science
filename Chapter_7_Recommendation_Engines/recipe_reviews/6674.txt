This could almost be classified as another recipe. The first time I went to make this bread I didn't have all the ingredients. I omitted the potato flakes and lemon extract. Instead of 4 tablespoons of margarine, I used oil and I used 1 TSP of salt instead of 3/4 TSP. I made the bread in my bread machine, any crust setting works. Just a different variation.

The Hawaiian Bread had a wonderful smell and a lovely texture.  It tasted great with or without butter.  I made two batches in one day.  One I gave to my mother who had never even heard of it before.  She couldn't get enough.

Not as sweet at the name suggest. The lemon extract seems to add an overpowering taste.

I just couldn't bring myself to pay $4 for a loaf in the store anymore and I think this came really close to store bought. I used a bit more sugar than called for. I don't have a bread machine so I sprinkled the yeast on top and let it set until bubbly, then dissolved the sugar, butter and salt in the water. Then I mixed in the other ingredients adding the flour last. Well people, the stickiness depends on the humidity level. ADD MORE FLOUR if it is too sticky! Geeez! Yummy good stuff!

I let the dough rise twice. You can form them into rolls (about 12) on the second rise. 350 25 minutes

Instead of 1 cup of water, I used 1 cup of pineapple juice.  I baked it in a 10" round pan and it turned out perfect.  I put spinach dip in the Hawaiian bread and everyone enjoyed it.

This is a very easy bread to make. It wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be but quite tender and a really good flavor. The lemon extract is a good addition. I think the next time I make it (and I will make it again) I will increase the sugar - maybe double it and experiment with orange or pineapple extract in place of the lemon.

I love this bread!! It is sweet and moist and delicious! I serve it with honey butter. I make the dough in my bread machine and then bake in the oven.

Very good! I used coconut extract instead of lemon which was good.  I wasn't home to get the dough out of the bread machine right away, and then let it rise again and it turned out great. Very easy!

This is an excellent bread.  My 10-year old and his dad both loved it.  It is not too sweet, just right for kids.  I substituted organge extract for lemon and added a little more flour and some wheat bran to make it work in my bread machine.

I needed Kings Hawaiian bread. I needed it badly enough to do physical damage to anyone who stood in my way.  Somehow, though,  I turned kind of hippy and hate the thought of all those added 'ingredients' in commercial bread. So I bought myself some organic flour and settled in with this recipe. Holy sh#t. So easy and so amazing. I don't have a bread machine,  so I did what others did: dissolved the (doubled because I NEEDED SWEET BREAD) sugar, salt and oil (because it seemed easier) in the water then let the yeast hang out in the mess and get frothy.  Added everything else (plus an extra 1/4c flour on recommendation of everyone and swapped the lemon out for extra vanilla, because I want sweet bread, dagnabbit) and let it hang out an hour.  I didn't have any issues with it exploding everywhere like other people did. Baked it 33 minutes and it is everything I ever hoped it would be, albeit a slightly crumblier version, but nothing unmanageable. The kids said it was too sweet, but I've had my suspicions about them for some time now and I'm pretty sure they're not mine. Probably not even human, if I had to guess.  It's ok, though, because now I only have to fight my husband for the rest of the loaf. I'm certain he'll underestimate me in this battle.

I did make some changes:  I doubled the sugar, slightly increased the vanilla and left out the lemon extract.  I noticed it needed more flour while it was mixing in the bread machine so I added several tablespoons.  I made a separate mixture of margarine, milk, & sugar and painted this on the bread just before baking it in the oven. I put a pan of water in the oven while baking the bread to help it keep its moisture.
It turned out moist, pleasantly sweet and wonderfully delicious!  This would be great with strawberries over it.

Wonderful! Hubby like it better than store bought. I sprayed my 10 in springform pan with cooking spray and let it rise until doubled like the recipe stated. Then I baked until golden on top, about 20-25 min. Perfect! Very sticky dough and lots of air bubbles so I poured straight from bread machine pan without touching then poked with fork before last rise.

Like others, I found this was pretty sticky and therefore added a half cup more flour.  Also this made enough dough for two loaves. Not quite as sweet as my hubby hoped for but still very good.

I love this bread!! I didn't have any lemon flavoring so I tried orange flavoring once and almond flavoring on a different loaf.  I love it with almond.

This tastes NOTHING like any Hawaiian Sweet Bread that I have ever eaten before! As a general bread it turned out well and tasted good (although I personally didn't like the lemon taste). Don't make this recipe expecting Hawaiian Sweet Bread.

I made 9 of these loaves in 3 days.  poof!  I did change the recipe slightly - omitted lemon extract and increased the vanilla to 1/2 tsp.  People loved the bread.  BUT, if you're looking for King's Hawaiian, this isn't it - King's Hawaiian is much sweeter.  Like I said tho, people loved this and one of the comments I heard the most about why they did was because it wasn't too sweet.  fwiw.  Will try adding a tiny bit of orange oil next time.  Just curious.

This bread turned out delicious and fluffy, and was not hard to make.

At one point I was sure I did something terribly wrong, because the dough that came out of my bread machine was so sticky and almost runny, but it baked just fine, and all my guests enjoyed it.

I decided to make this to use up some pineapple juice I had.had exactly 1 cup of it so used it in place of the water as several other reviewers mentioned. Had to add extra flour like many mentioned also since the batter was way to thin. I did not want overflow as others had mentioned when baking so put the dough on a pizza pan, making it into a round loaf so there was plenty of leeway if it grew too much. added 2 extra T. of sugar since lack of sweetness was mentioned. Came out pretty good, but like many reviewers stated previously:was bland. My family and I all though it was "so so." Because I had to adjust and since we did not really like it super well I merely gave it a two.

I love this recipe.  It is so sweet and yummy.  It makes great toast.  I wish there was a way to make it slightly less crumbly.

I thought this was good. It was very light but not quite sweet enough. Due to other reviews I added all vanilla and omitted the lemon. It did go well with the ham I made and we will make it again.

I used to have a different variation of this recipe that used lemon peel instead of lemon extract and was much sweeter (that recipe was better).  But that recipe and this one always seems to rise more than what it says...I always end up with enough dough for 2 loaves.  I like to put the dough into 2 round cake pans, but even when I use the loaf pan, it still takes 2 of them.  The first time I made this recipe, I ended up with a mess because the dough expanded too much.  I rate this recipe as just okay.

I made this bread for a Christmas Dinner in a round easter bread loaf style.... It worked out wonderful! I took some time riseing, however it took and rose nice after awhile. I did add some flour making it a little heavier though. Overall Great Recipe!

I love the flavor of this bread! Though I don't know if it was the weather conditions here or I slipped up with the measuring somehow but I found I needed to add close to another cup of flour. Within 5 minutes of the machine starting I decided to check it and boy I'm glad I did, it was like a thick soup! Other than that hiccup it turned out amazing :)

I must have done something wrong. I put mine in the pan, put it in the oven to let it rise, after awhile opened the door and found it spilling over the edge of the pan as it expanded. The only thing I changed was pineapple juice for the water, which I read others had done on a different recipe.Tastes ok but I think I'll try Ruthie Banks recipe again in a reduced size. At least it acted like bread dough.

This had a great flavor.  I don't have a bread machine so I wasn't sure how to adapt this recipe.  The dough was more "fluid" than I had expected.  It did raise, but it flowed over my pan and made a mess.  It made a bigger mess in the oven.  Aside from the mess, it tasted good and I served it with a spinach dip.  I exchanged the lemon flavoring for coconut.

i made this recipe and i read other peoples reviews,
so i did some of my own,
i used 3 1/2 cups of flour
8 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons of brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 packet fast rising yeast
i sprayed my bread machine with cooking spray,
and during the mixing cycle i cleaned the edges back into mix
it really turned out fantastic

Easy to prepare and quick as bread goes.  Good texture and taste though not as sweet as other sweet breads.

Very easy to make in bread machine. I did make a few substitutions, I added one cup of pineapple juice instead of water and I used coconut extract instead of lemon extract. It was so good!!! My family wants a loaf everyday!!!!

I had a difficult time getting th loaf out of the pan and much of it stuck to the bottom. It was delicious though and used it for French toast. I plan to use sprayed springform pan next time as ritejane suggests in her review.

I halved the lemon like some others had suggested. This bread turned out great! Next time I want to try pineapple juice in stead of water, and see how that tastes.

Pretty easy to make though I added about another quarter cup of flour because the dough was so wet. The dough still came out VERY sticky and rose like crazy. I let it rise only half an hour in the loaf pan -- if I'd let it double in bulk, it would have spilled way over the top of the pan! Baked for 25 minutes and it was done -- coarse crumb but very tasty.
