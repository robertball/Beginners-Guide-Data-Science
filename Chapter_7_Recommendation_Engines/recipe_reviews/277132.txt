Really delicious!  And pretty simple too.  It helped to have the cream, eggs, pepper  and cheese all mixed together first.  Then, as soon as the pasta is done, you can stir everything together in a flash.  I did add about a cup of defrosted frozen peas -- I can't help myself adding veggies whenever possible -- but they were a very nice addition.  Sauteed mushrooms would also be terrific in this dish.  Definitely a keeper!

This was delicious! We enjoyed it immensely, used regular bacon because already had it in the fridge. We chose thin spaghetti and added a touch more Parmesan. We saved a bit for our son to try and he gave it a thumbs up as well. I wouldn't make this every day or week but for a special dinner or company, it is a winner.

I loved this recipe.  It was fast, easy, and had a bunch of flavor.  I've made spaghetti carbonara recipes before, but this is by far my favorite. I'll be making this again.
