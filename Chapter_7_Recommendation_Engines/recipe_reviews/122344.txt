I want to give it less, but the taste is great.  I just think that calling them squares is misleading.  My husband said, "this is the best pecan goo".  I even cooked it for 50 min. using convection to ensure everything came out evenly cooked.  The top definitely formed an almost creme brulee crispy top, but once I tried to cut into it (after cooling for about an hour) it just fell apart.  I am taking the outside pieces to a pot luck tonight, but I am afraid the inside cuts just aren't "squares". UPDATE:  after 24 hours the top seemed to firm up considerably - I think next time I will put the dish in the frig for about an hour to see if this solves the "goo" problem I am having.

Quick and easy with what you have lying around.  I used chocolate cake mix.  Next time, though I would probably increase the cream cheese to two packs and drop the sugar to two cups.  I was looking for more of a cheesecake flavor, but it wasn't too noticeable as is.

I made this because my husband needed something last-minute for a potluck and I happened to have all the ingredients on hand.  It was delicious!  It was eaten up quickly.  I left it in the oven closer to 50 minutes....at 45 minutes it was golden brown on top but very gooey in the middle.  YUM!

We are having a bake sale at work today and someone brought these in. They used Butter Pecan cake mix instead of yellow and they are out of this world!

I've been making this for years and the only thing I add is 1 tsp of Vanilla to the top cream cheese part.  This is actually a spin on the gooey butter cake which originated in St. Louis, Missouri in the 1930's and many people claim to have invented it.

These are super easy and really good!  I substituted the yellow cake for a lemon cake mix (didn't have the yellow on hand) and they were still super yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are delicious- I would follow what others said about putting them in the fridge and then trying to cut them, as they are quite messy otherwise.  I followed the recipe as is and they were delicious!

Seriously - I wanted to like this recipe. I put a generous 2 cups of pecans in and it did not have much of a pecan flavor. Baked it in a 9x13 pan and the cream cheese portion of it was a thin, almost nonexistent layer - nothing gooey about it. I think it would have been much better if the crust was half as thick and the cream cheese part much thicker. The only variations I made from the original recipe was adding a little vanilla in the cream cheese mixture and not adding quite as much confectioners sugar - it was still plenty sweet.

Loved this!!!  I did, however, modifiy the cream cheese mixture.  I melted 1/2 bag of butterscotch chips in the microwave and added it to the cream cheese mixture at the end.  It was delicious.  Next time I am going to add caramel ice cream topping or melted caramels instead.  I thought I might mix in melted chocolate chips by swirling them in the mixture after pouring it into pan.  Also, I did use 2 pkgs of cream cheese, giving it more of a topping than if you only used one.  The best!! Shared it at work and got raves!!  Will make over and over. YUMMY!!!!
