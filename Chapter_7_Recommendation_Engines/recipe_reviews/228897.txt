Followed the recipe to the letter with one slight change. I add 1 1/2 Oz of Vodka or Gin. What a way to start the day, by the way I leave the vodka/gin out of the kids drinks.

This is actually very good!  I roasted my beets before I found this recipe, but that ended up working just fine.  I do not have a juicer, so I ran this through my food processor to get it pretty fine, and then through my blender on the "liquify" setting to turn it into juice.  I assume a juicer is much more effective at making juice, as I found I had to add some liquid to this in order to get it to the desired consistency.  I have some fresh apple cider from going apple picking recently, so I added a little of that to get this nice and liquidy.  I realize that added some sugar, which is probably not the goal of a recipe like this, but it wasn't much, and it made it just sweet enough that my daughter actually likes it quite a bit.  What a yummy and great way to get some extra fruits and veggies in our diets- fresh and healthy :)  Thanks for sharing the recipe Raina!

I make this drink with ginger almost everyday.  Beets clenses liver and lowers colesterol among other many benefits. It is a very good thing for your health.  Adding ginger is a must for me. I might try adding cinnamon by lunap007 suggested. Thanks.

Wonderful.  Only had one lemon, so added two oranges, some water and ice to thin a bit and a handful each of kale and spinach.

Delicious mix. I also added some ginger and cinnamon and it added a nice kick to the flavor.

Very healthy way to start the day - I can feel the vitamins revitalising my system with each sip! One word of warning: if you only have a small blender (as I do) be careful, it doesn't turn it into juice unless you add water or another kind of liquid (I mixed some orange juice and water together), and be careful the liquid doesn't come seeping out as you whizz away. Time for me to buy a juicer...

I love this juice. I didn't have any lemons, so I added one orange and it was delicious. I hate beets, but this juice is a great remix on getting the nutrients beet provide in an enjoyable way.

I only had 1 beet, but that's my only change and it turned out fine without a 2nd. No sugar added, ran it through the juicer, laughed at my purpley-pink fingers while sipping on this great breakfast zinger.

Delicious! My favorite juice to make in the juicer so far. Only thing I did different was leave the skin on my lemon, it keeps more of the lemon flavor that I love.

I love this recipie, but find making as posted results in a juce that is a bit too strong - between the two lemons & raw beets.

Adding 2 carrots and one apple to the mix sweetens it perfectly

Not bad. I think next time I'll add some ginger to counter the earthy beat flavor a little. But it's good and will definitely make again.

Wonderful! This juice gives me xtra energy in the morning and it's great for nutrients when you have to be on the go all day like I do. I even ran out of lemons one day and used limes instead and it was still great. Thanx a bunch for posting!

I really like the "zing" the lemons provide. I added some of the beet greens. Amazing over ice in a wine glass. Great way to fancy things up. :-)

The only changes I made were 1/2 a lemon and an orange and a little ginger. I was really surprised by how good it is! I'll definitely make it again.

I'm giving 4 stars only because I used my blender, and it came out way too thick. I added a cup of water and still wasn't just right, so I needed to drain it so I had just the juice. Had I had a juicer I'm sure it would have come out better. I also had to add a dash of sugar. 2 lemons was a bit too sour. All in all, I will be trying this again once I have a real juicer. And probably add some ginger root and cinnamon as recommended by other users. Thanks for this recipe! I definitely felt replenished afterwards :)

Really fresh and tart.  It's our first fresh juice, made at home with our new juicer.  Might add a half lemon less and one more apple or carrot just to ease tartness slightly. Delicious aroma so fresh too.  We loved it!

Pretty good - I thought two lemons made it a little too sour, so I will try one lemon next time.
