I LOVE (I cannot stress this enough!) this recipe! I did, however, find that if I added just enough water to the mixture BEFORE blending, it came out thin enough so that I could use a flavor injector.  I injected the steak all over, and then let it sit in the fridge overnight.  This allowed the flavor to really give the meat a workover. Yummy yummy! The perfect balance of spicy and sweet!

Very flavorful!  I used one can of chipotle and it was very spicy.  Great flavor, though.  Saved the leftovers for burrito bowls.

Very nice.  It being January on the 44th parallel, we pan-seared instead of grilling, and with some Spanish rice and garlicky chard on the side we almost forgot how cold it was outside!

I made the mistake of making this indoors - because it was winter time. The fumes from the chipotles was horrible! The flavor was ok, but not very deep or rich.

Not for the faint in heart indeed! HOT HOT HOT! I recommend using one can of chipotles to the 2 pounds of beef. Still super spicy but manageable. I like hot but as written this is just too much.

I've made this many times and my whole family loves it.  I do redue chiptles to just one can, and that's perfectly spicy. We slice it thin and make burritos out of it.

Five stars from both of us for this one. Perfect amount of heat for us. We used a can of chipotle peppers in adobe sauce. Strongly recommend cooking this outside though. We used the indoor grill, and the smoke gave us coughing fits.
