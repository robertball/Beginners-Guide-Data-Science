I couldn't ask for any better! I used a 9x13 pan and baked it for 40 minutes. I just made this for the 2nd time and this time I upped the cocoa to 1 cup... I'm REALLY glad I did! The cake is great with the amount called for, but after trying more to see the difference, I definitely think 1 cup is the magic amount. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would. I used the "Buttercream Icing" recipe (pictured) from Sharon on this website. Incredible together!

My original review was 4 stars because I tried the cake only a few hours after baking.  The cake alone was OK but had a strong baking soda taste.  I used a can of dunkin hines vanilla frosting and with this the cake was good.  However, after mellowing in the fridge for a day or two this cake was insanely good!  As good as any store bought or boxed mix.  Bottom line:  Make the cake a day in advance and let it mellow in the fridge overnight.  I see no need to buy another boxed mix again.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Oh, and yes, after the water step it will be very soupy but it will turn out perfect :D

My grandma must've found this recipe a couple years ago, because that's when she gave it to my family. We love it! However, this recipe doesn't have absolutely PREFECT chocolate frosting that came with the one my grandma gave us, so I thought I'd help out a bit:
Â½ C Butter/ 
2/3 C Cocoa/ 
1 Tsp. Vanilla/ 
3 C Powdered Sugar/ 
1/3 C Milk - 
Melt butter, stir in cocoa. Alternately add sugar and milk, beating to spreading consistency. If necessary, thin with additional milk. Add vanilla. - There we go! I use this frosting recipe every time, and it's perfect for this cake. Hope I helped!!!

This cake will be printed out as my new basic chocolate cake. Everything about it was nice, I did add a teaspoon of instant coffee to the boiling water and the batter was thin. Baked up perfect - I did line the tin and use oil spray. Tastes better than some expensive box mixes. Wasn't overly moist either, just not dry at all. Thanks.
UPDATE: Up the amount of cocoa to 1 cup and make sure it's the best quality. I use a European brand. You can use melted butter if you run out of oil. You can use whipped cream, cocoa powder and icing sugar for a great icing.

I have joyfully been trying many different cake/frosting recipes from this site and I must say this is about the most moist and delicious I have found! I used this to make cupcakes and what a perfect batter for the task! It's so "runny" you just pour it into the liners. Halve the recipe and you get 12 cupcakes. Fill the liners 3/4 way full. They come out fluffy and very moist- PERFECT! I used the "Rich Chocolate Frosting" from this site and it too was superb. (I wrote a review on it as well.)

With just slight variations, this recipe is much like "Black Magic Cake," which I found I prefer. It is not quite as dense or as fudgy as this one. This is a deep, dark chocolate cake, but it was almost  TOO moist,TOO dense. Don't know what really accounts for the difference since the recipes are so similar, and maybe it's just a matter of personal preference, but while this was a very good cake, I'll stick with the other.

One of the best cake recipes your ever going to find. Been cooking cakes for over ten years this recipe is easy, moist,texture and elasticity is perfect for chocolate cake. The type of cocoa is crucial. I've cooked it twice, first time used a dark cocoa it was good but the dark chocolate enhanced the salt so it tasted a tad salty. So next time if using a dark cocoa will omit the salt.  Second time, used good quality standard cocoa and came out great. Also used a diluted espresso instead of plain water. Also glad the writer noted the runniness of the mix abit worrying at first. Excellent recipe.

This is the exact recipe that is on the back of the Hershey Cocoa can.  I have been using this same recipe for years! So much better than a box mix!

Absolutely delicious and so EASY to make!  We made this for a birthday party just last weekend and made another one last night for ourselves.  Perfect with some whipped topping, we added a 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips to make it even more chocolatey!  If you do this, make sure to sprinkle it on top of the batter AFTER you have poured it into the baking pan, let them just sit on the top.  Since the batter is thin, mixing them in will cause them to sink to the bottom and stick to the pan as you try to get the cake out.

OH MY GOD! This is hands down the BEST, EASIEST and MOISTEST chocolate cake EVER!
I was very skeptical about this recipe, after all I tried cake mixes before and they were heavenly but oh my was I impressed!
As others suggested I used 1 cup of cocoa but other than that I did nbot change a thing.
I checked the cake at about 25 mins and the toothpick came out clean so I took it out.
So you should keep an eye on that, some ovens might not take that long to cook the cake.
I greased the tin and cut out a circle of stickproof baking paper and the cake came out very easily. Even though it is so  moist, you can still lift it and it won't break, of course you have to be careful with that.
I iced and filled it with some ready made chocolate icing and it was divine! I also left it out all night and it taste just as moist and delicious as the day I made it.
Thank you SO much for this recipe, it is definitely a keeper and will make it many many times!
Btw, for the people who pointed out that this recipe is from the Hershey cocoa package, does it really matter? They don't sell that cocoa here and I would have never known about this recipe if the user did not post it here. Baking is about sharing good things and that was definitely done.

This is not a good cake to make a layer cake with.  It is delicious, but it is more of a pudding cake, or a spoon type cake.  It would NOT come out of the pans, even though the pans were well greased before hand.  This cake came out in chunks...the kids had a great time eating the scraps, but we had to start over for my daughter's birthday cake.

I googled to find a chocolate cake recipe for a baking contest, and picked this one for it's simplicity due to my busy schedule.  I won!  I won with a perfect score!!

The greatest thing about this cake is how moist it is.... not just fresh-baked, but even a couple of days later.  I am adding this recipe to my recipe box!

HINT: I use the shorter baking time with all recipes, subtract 5 minutes, and check the cake by touching with a finger to see if it springs back.  What you want is for the cake to spring back but still sound "wet" inside.... Turn off your oven, close the door and let the cake finish its last 5 minutes of bake time.  This will allow the cake to set without drying out.  Try it!

This recipe is awesome but remember it will only come out as great as the ingredients you use.  I used Hershey's cocoa powder because that's what I had on hand but I would recommend using the highest quality cocoa you can afford!  The batter IS really thin, I am SO glad that the recipe included that warning because I woulld have thought I did something wrong.  Don't worry!

this recipe is very good.  but i used the batter to make cupcakes and they were delicious! i was surprised at how moist they were. everybody loved them. i suggest that when you put in the cocoa powder, it's good to sift it then there are no lumps and the batter is smooth. also i did not put the full cup of water, i think it made the batter too thin. the next time i'm going to try it in the cake form.

This cake is absolutely fabulous! A treat for all chocolate lovers! And oh soooo easy! This recipe is very forgiving, it is quite difficult to go wrong with this one if you keep a few tips in mind. First of all, make sure you use LARGE eggs, otherwise you will end up with brownies instead of a luscious cake. Do not cut back on the soda or the baking powder, as they are the key to the cake structure. I also upped the cocoa to one cup and the result was any chocolate lover's fantasy. The cake was very moist, almost creamy yet with the firmness of a cake. I topped it with toblerone ganache and it worked perfectly with the bittersweet taste of the cake. Make sure you line the pan with parchment. The cake is so fudgy that IT WILL stick to the pan.

I found this recipe a little under a year ago, and I can't count how many times I've made it.  I will never, I repeat, NEVER make another chocolate cake again!  I get asked for the recipe constantly, and friends and family beg me to make it.  Tip: I make mine with 100% whole wheat flour and you can't tell the difference AT ALL!  If you're looking for the best, most moist and flavorful chocolate cake you've ever had, YOU FOUND IT!

This was an extremely easy and low mess cake recipe.  I needed something fast, that was homemade, for my son's birthday.  I made this recipe into 24 cupcakes (instead of a cake) for a group of preschoolers.  I frosted it with chocolate frosting and they tasted delicious.  The cake was moist and yummy.  I would make it again.

The taste of this cake is 5 stars, but the texture is a 3, so I averaged them out, making the overall rating 4 stars.  I may have done something wrong, but I did follow the directions exactly and my cake stuck to the pan (even though I did grease and flour it).  Also, the cake was very crumbly and almost too moist, and almost overflowed out of my 2 9 in. pans. Next time i may try reducing the amount of water, or add none at all, because the taste was absolutely devine! I will definitly make this again with minor changes. Thanks for the recipe!  
UPDATE: I made this recipe again as cupcakes and they are sooo good!  They are very rich and extremely moist.  They are light and wonderfull!  IMPORTANT:Just be sure if you make cupcakes you only fill the tins HALF FULL or else they will overflow (like mine did the first batch).  I baked them for 25 minutes per batch and I was able to yield 30 cupcakes from this recipe.  Also, they are divine with peanut butter frosting form this sight :)

This is an easy and tasty cake.  I always make it in a 9 x 13 pan but it still bakes for about 35 minutes.  Interestingly, the last time I made it, I forgot to add the oil.  All of it.  And my family still loved it.  So there's a good very low-fat option, too!

Absolutely fantastic!  I tried this recipe out for my cousin's birthday and it was devoured!!

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out GREAT!  As stated by another reviewer, don't be afraid to use the amount of oil and boiling (not hot!) water needed-it makes all the difference.

Oh, and be sure to wait those 10min (or more!) before removing from the pan... it makes removal MUCH easier.

This is a definite keeper. =)

Made this one exactly by the book as far as ingredients go. However, I used a 9x13 instead of two circulars as I don't have those, so I upped the bake time to ~38 mins. It seems very runny when you first pour it into the pan, which can be disconcerting. Don't worry about that though' it turns out fine. Very moist and delicious. I paired it with "Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting" from this site.

this is the BEST chocolate cake i have EVER had. i managed to mess it up by using a bad springform pan and it was the ugliest cake you will ever see, but the best taste. i made it with chocolate ganache made with milkas triolade, a mix of milk, semibitter and white chocolate. it is the best cake i have eaten and my family agreed. next time i will make it with a good pan, be sure to grease it well if you have old pans like me.. (im buying new ones) great recipe! thanks to the person who submitted it.. i literally made the batter in 15 minutes (inluding measuring) i used 1 cup of cocoa but i think sticking to the recipe would work fine. dont stop trying this if you only have 3/4 cup cocoa

"Now THIS is chocolate cake!" That's what my dad said as he ate this cake. I completely agree. I made this for my niece's birthday and it came out fantastic. The thing I love about it is that it's almost as easy as a box mix, but tastes even better. Plus, it's made with ingredients I usually have in my pantry. It's dark and moist and goes perfectly with "Caroline's Chocolate Fudge Frosting" on this site. My hubby requested I make another cake just for us, so I relented, but only made 1/2 cake. It's one of the best chocolate cakes from scratch I've ever made!

This was such a moist dense brownie like cake- it was delicious! - I made a vanilla buttercream icing that went amazing with it- I only gave it 4 stars because it dipped in the middle- not great when you are making a layer cake- I did some reading on why cakes dip and one reason is too much baking powder- soda- which this recipe has a ton of-

I made this in a bundt pan, glazed it with the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" from this site and sifted powdered sugar over the top of it.  Gorgeous cake and it tasted pretty darn good too.  Like some of the other reviews recommended, I replaced the water with strong coffee...made the flavor really pop!

I used Gihaderlli (?) cocoa and I believe that intensified the flavor of the cake. The cake was very moist and rich...and a tad bit too sweet even though I lowered the sugar from 2 cups to 1 3/4. Next time I will use 1 1/2. Overall it was a good easy cake, its one of those fun cakes. I was a little concerned when I stirred in the boiling water because the batter smelled...burnt? but the cake tasted fine.

So easy to make and perfectly moist and delicious. I used a standard Bundt tube pan (baked for 35 minutes) and frosted it with a dark chocolate ganache. Excellent!

Easy, easy!  I keep the dry ingredients bagged in my freezer and use this recipe as my go-to cake mix.  Turns out perfect EVERYTIME!  I read the negative reviews and from what I read, the results were bad because of a recipe modification or overfilling the pans. Yes - this cake rises, even though the batter seems really runny.  Definitely worth a try!

This was perfect!!! I did as others suggested and increased the cocoa powder to 1 cup. I baked this in a 9x13 baking pan for 40 minutes. This cake is delicious in every way...moist, rich, dense, but not too much of each! The perfect balance of all! I topped mine with a peanut butter chocolate ganache...heavenly!!!

I am a very good baker, but this cake didn't turn out at all. I was worried even though the recipe said that the batter will be thin, even though I followed the recipe exactly. I didn't know why it said to dust the pan with butter AND flour, but I did it anyway. When I took the cake out of the pan, the top of the cake had flour spots all over it, so I had to wipe it off because nobody wants chunks of flour on top of their cake. Also, the middle sunk in and the edges were tough because I had to bake it longer because the middle was undercooked. What a disaster! I will certainly not make this cake again.

So DISSAPOINTED! I actually had to make this recipe 2 times. My son and I were making a birthday cake for me together. I made it once and it ran all over my oven. After hiding this finished product from my son so he was not upset that the cake was ruined I tried again. I followed the recipe exactly and it almost ran all over the oven this time it stuck to the pan and was not cooked in the middle even after 40 minutes. I am now sitting here smelling the burnt cake self clean off the oven and is soooo not happy!

AWESOME! I followed the exact recipe for one of a three layer cake for my boyfriend's graduation party. It was extremely easy and way better than any box mix. The scraps got eaten before I iced it :D.

Wow, this was so good, I am having it with coffee for my breakfast this morning (shame on me).  I used Ghirardelli cocoa powder, just under a cup.  I frosted with the butter cream frosting from the Red Velvet Cake I recipe on this site.  Took the advice of another rater and bought an oven thermometer - made a huge difference, as my oven temp was 10 degrees high, allowing me to adjust to the correct temp.  I removed it at 28 minutes and it was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe and comments for a great cake!

This cake was delicious, and not really any more work than a cake mix.  I followed the recipe as written, it yielded two 8-inch cakes...I will save this to use as my go-to chocolate cake recipe, thanks!

This cake came out really good. I did change it up a bit to make it healthier. Instead of oil I used applesauce and instead eggs I used egg substitute. I also used one cup of cocoa powder and added a cup of brewed coffee. The result was a delicious and somewhat healthy chocolate cake.

OMG... my daughter needed cupcakes last minute for school.  I had no boxed mix and it was to late to go to the store, so I came on here.  I had all the ingredients on hand so decided to give this a try.  This has to be the moistest cake I have ever had, almost to moist to remove from the cup cake papers, but well worth it. I won't be going back to box cake mixes again!  Thank you for the recipe!

WARNING>  do not use this recipe for cupcakes! H.O.L.Y  C.O.W.  what a disaster!  in 25+ years of baking i've never made such a mess!  i followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using 1 cup of hot coffee rather than hot water.  my mistake?  because i was wanting big fluffy tops on my cupcakes i followed the advice of one of the other reviewers and filled my liners 3/4 of the way full.  BAD IDEA! bad, bad, BAD!  everything ended up overflowing and i had to throw the entire batch (12 cupcakes) out!  and i'll have lots of pan (& oven scrubbing!) to do.  next, i tried to fill them 1/2 full (as i usually do with other recipes) and i just checked and even those are overflowing!  what the heck?!?  if i ever make this recipe again i will NOT make it for cupcakes.  i have to admit that the taste (of what i could scrape off of my cupcake pan) was very good though. too bad it didn't work out for me. :(

I upped the cocoa powder to 1 cup as suggested by other reviewers and that's the only change I made--delicious! Yum, yum, yum! This was perfect! Not too sweet, moist, and super easy! I will definitely make this over and over again. Thank you!

This was my first cake  from scratch.  Very simple, had all ingredients on hand. Took the advice of other reviewers and THOROUGHLY greased the pan.  Also used 9X13 pan  instead of two 9 inch rounds and cooked for 40 mins.  Came out perfect and moist and yummy.  Oh yeah, and I also used hot coffee instead of hot water.

this was sooooo moist and delicious!!!  i used 1 1/2 cups spelt flour instead of the 1 3/4 cups of all purpose flour.  i also used applesauce instead of oil and just 1 cup of sugar.  i find that if you are going to be using a sweet icing/frosting/glaze on top, then you really don't need to add so much sugar to the cake it self.  yum!!

I've used this recipe many times before. I replace the water with a cup of coffee and I think it makes it so much better. I've also substituted the milk with soy milk on a few occasions and it turns out just fine. I always use this cake recipe as a layer cake and never have any problems getting it out of the pan.

I've been using this forever as my go-to chocolate cake, with a couple tweaks.  I am very into cake decorating and I found that this cake just didn't stack well or have a sturdy enough texture as is.  I add one pack of Jello instant chocolate pudding, and another egg.  After this the texture and flavor is wonderful.  Next time I'll try adding some more cocoa as others have suggested, and the instant espresso is a great add if the cake is for adults.

An update, lately (instead of adding the jello pudding above) I still add the extra egg (total 3 eggs), but I also up the flour to 2 1/4c, increase baking powder to 1 3/4 tsp, and use 1/2 c milk and 1/2 c buttermilk instead of all milk.  This seemed to get rid of the center of the cake sinking problem that I was having before.

I cut this recipe in half, made 18 cupcakes and baked for 15 minutes. It was fast, easy and delicious.

Turned out good. Could use a little more chocolate flavor to it. Would increase the cocoa to 1 cup next time

This is my go-to recipe for chocolate cake!  It's super easy to make and the cake always comes out delicious and moist.  I followed others' reviews and used 1 cup of cocoa powder.  I've tried the recipe with water + 1tsp coffee and also with just water...either way the cake is great!  I wouldn't recommend this recipe to use for cake pops...it's too moist, it won't hold the ball shape at all.

I have to give this recipe 5 stars. I accidentally didn't make it as written, but it still turned out great, though not as much like a cake. I accidentally left out the cup of milk, so the end result was more like brownies. It tasted great, just a lot more dense. My daughter wanted a "dirt cake" for her birthday, so I topped it with Cool-whip with chocolate pudding mix stirred into it, then crumbled Oreo cookies all over the top. Everyone at the party loved it and there was none left.  Great recipe, even with my mistake!

A truly scrumptious cake. I made this for a fete at church. I took the advise of other reviewers and added 1 cup cocoa powder as against the recommended 3/4 cup. Also, instead of adding the ingredients in the order mentioned in the recipe, I beat the oil, and sugar till fluffy, then added the eggs and beat well. I sifted all the dry ingredients and added that alternatively with the milk. After the flour and milk was added I added the extract. And finally as was mentioned in the recipe I added the boiling water. I baked this in two 9x9 square pans for 30 mins. Once they had cooled down completely, I used nutella to spread between the layers and around the cake! Thank you Shirleyo for the recipe, 400luv for recommending it to me, and KSAZA for the nutella idea!! :)

This is why I love this site.  Here is an EASY recipe to follow.  The user comments were right on.  Per their advice I used the following...

1 cup of cocoa powder (Still Hershey's since that is what I had)
1/2 tbsp instant coffee to the boiling water before mixing.

The cake is moist, delicious, and a little dense compared to regular sheet cake.

I'm not normally a big chocolate cake eater but this super simple and delicious recipe has changed that!   As per other reviewers I made the following tweaks to the recipe. 1) Increased the cocoa to 1 cup 2) Used 1 cup of coffee to bring out the cocoa flavor 3) Used room temperature ingredients. It took 40 mins in a 9x13 pan.  I always get rave reviews when I bring this to potlucks and am asked constantly if I actually baked it myself!   Important note - find the willpower to not eat this immediately! Leave the cake OVERNIGHT in the fridge! It's worth the wait! Makes a huge difference to the taste! Moist, full of chocolate flavor, almost fudge-like (which I prefer!). Nice!

Update! I have made this about a million times and it is always so good and so moist and absolutely perfect. Tonight I made cupcakes from this recipe and they are AWESOME! 1/4C batter per cupcake - I will never use another recipe. Thank you!! /SO good!  I can't believe how easy this was - and so so good!  Too make it even easier and even better, when I pulled it out of the oven I sprinkled a bag of chocolate chips over the top and then smoothed them once they had melted.  Then I sprinkled chopped pecans on top.  Way easier than making frosting, and a big hit at our work potluck.  Thanks!

I gave this recipe 4 stars only because it stuck to my pan so bad we just frosted it in the 2 round pans and ate it out of the pan. I also greased and floured the pans like I do every time I make a layer cake and I've never had a cake stick so bad, homemade or boxed. Taste wise, it was really good!The texture was great! It was really pretty too. Too bad it stuck so horribly =(

Absolutely scrumptious.  I am glad I read others' advice before making, otherwise would have worried about how runny it is at first. When it was baking, it really puffed up over the pan which was worrisome too, but settled down nicely as soon as it was removed.  I iced this with "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" and it was a huge hit.  Would definitely make again.

Absolutely wonderful cake!
My entire family enjoys it.
The only change I make is to sometimes
substitute the water for coffee.
Thanks for sharing!

Amazing! I NEVER make cakes from scratch but decided to be really crazy and try one out for my daughters b-day, I was nervous about this cake but it was sooo good! Easy, moist, and really delicious. I will be making this again and again, thanks for the recipe even if it is the one from the Hershey's box, I would have never seen it there!

This was the easiest cake I have ever made! Even easier than a boxed cake!!! With recipes out there like this, NOBODY should ever make a boxed cake again. I only wanted to make a small cake, so I cut the recipe in half with no problems. The batter was made and in the oven within 10 minutes. I used "Chocolate Frosting I" also from this website and that was easy too. A+ recipe!

This is very yummy and very moist! Stayed moist for days. I rated it 4 stars though because it took a lot longer to cook than noted and didn't hold up well to being frosted - wayto delicate & crumby. I made cupcakes and I had a hard time taking them out of the pan without squishing them. If all you care about is taste and just want to serve this to your family - this is an excellent recipe but use good cocoa. I don't recommend if you want to have a "professional finish" product.

I was so afraid of making cake from scratch, I've tried before and it ended up with the cake in the trash.  I paired it with "fluffy peanut butter frosting" from this site, and my husband  immediately turned to me and said i better get started on the next one b/c this one would be gone in no time!  It wasn't overly chocolatey, and paired with the pb frosting it was perfect! Oh! and soooo easy!

This cake is AMAZING!  It is so easy and turned out just as moist, if not even more moist than a boxed cake, and tasted a lot better!  I've been searching for a moist, chocolatey cake and this one is it!  I highly recommend it!  Paired it with chocolate cream cheese frosting and also with fluffy white frosting drizzled with chocolate glaze.  Thank you for the AWESOME recipe!

I can't really comment fully on this cake because I'm still in shock!  HOW MOIST IT WAS, and easy wasn't the word!  All I can say is if you doubt, try it out for yourself and you will doubt no more!!!  Call me doubting Thomas!  I was really in doubt when I saw how soupy the batter was (even though I read the warnings).  Like I said, I'm still in shock!  Great cake!  A definine "must make again"!  No more boxed  for me, ever!

Tried this recipe tonight and all my family was super excited for some yummy chocolate cake. I followed the recipe EXACTLY, however, it turned out to be highly disgusting. I am not exactly sure why. I am an experienced baker. Baked it at the right temperature and right time. Used all the ingredients. Highly disappointed in this recipe. It tasted very bland. Not going to use this recipe again.WHAT A WASTE OF INGREDIENTS .. My experience.

This is the exact recipe that is on the back of Hershy's Cocoa. So no wonder it's good. I realized this when I got the cocoa out of the cabinet and started making this recipe, then looked at the back of the cocoa. It's written exactly.

This cake was SO sweet my family couldn't even swallow it. I think the 2 cups of sugar needs to be 2 tbsp. It looked like caramelized sugar.

This works pretty well and comes out easily.  I did the brewed coffee thing the second time I made it and the flavour was better.  Still not amazing but very simple for beginners.

This cake is fantastic, however I see it on here a lot as just a chocolate cake recipe, but it is actually a trademarked Hershey recipe that is on the back of every hershey's cocoa container. Either way, I've been making it as my standard chocolate cake for years and have never had a better cake.

I used coffee in place of the hot water and cut the sugar by 1/4-1/2.  I frosted it with Rich Chocolate Icing.  It's quick, easy and everyone I've made it for loves it!

Amazing. I hate when i make things that have instant mixes and turn out pretty much the same as instant, BUT this however is totally worth making homemade instead of instant. I will use this for all my chocolate cakes and won't need instant chocolate mix again. I love how dense this cake is. I made cupcakes because its for a finger food event and i needed it to be easy for people to eat. I am looking for a icing recipe now and i soo do not want to mess up these cupcakes. And yea the recipe is on the back of hersheys cocoa but i wouldnt have noticed the recipe til i found this one. Thanks.

Too sweet.  Too soupy.  I even used Hershey's Hot Fudge Topping like other people had recommended.

The consistency was good BEFORE I added the hot fudge.  That was a mistake.

Excellent. I was a bit concerned we wouldn't like it as much as my usual go-to chocolate cake (I didn't have all the ingredients called for in that one, or I would have made it) but it was really good, thoroughly enjoyed by all! I made the layers and froze them for two days, then frosted and left in the fridge another day and it was very moist when it came time to eat it. Just the right amount of density too. I frosted with Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting from this site and filled it with Cinnamon Coffee Frosting also from this site. I used 8 inch pans and it worked wonderfully (I actually found the layers to be a bit thin, despite my using smaller pans). Edit: I've made this a bunch more times now, and paired with peanut butter frosting, it is amazing. A.MA.ZING. I made cookies n cream frosting with it too once and that was good as well.

Wow! Dont change a thing. If you are looking for a moist,perfectly dense chocolate cake,this is truely perfect. It couldnt be easier with everything in one bowl. I was a tiny bit sceptical because the batter was very thin, but it actually did come out better than any other chocolate recipe Ive tried.
Thanks for an easy, wonderful cake recipe.

Very good!  Especially the next day.  I used a whole cup of cocoa powder per other reviewers suggestions, and I'm very happy with the results.  Yum.  Update!!  I halved the recipe (used 1/2 c cocoa powder) and made 12 cupcakes with it, then frosted and filled them with Fluffy White Frosting from AR.  Run to your kitchen and make these - they will not disappoint!!  I baked at 350 for 16 min and they were so moist and yummy.  We ate them in literally two hours.  Almost like homemade Hostess Cupcakes but totally better!

I made this cake for my daughter's birthday. Everyone loved it but it was too moist for me. I found that it taste even better and less moist after refrigerating overnight. I also used 1 cup of coca powder and all butter. I used Buttercream icing by Sharon.

I actually got this recipe off of the hershey's unsweetened cocoa container and make it any time I need to make a chocolate cake. Its moist, rich, and very chocolatey. I've made it as a layer cake and cupcakes and have frozen them with good results.

Ok i have to give this three stars even though i completly messed it up. I forgot it needed veggie oil so it had to sit in the fridge. After that i saw that i put a little to much of it in :( so it ended up better than i thought it would. Also one more thing i made it into a sheet pan. I paired it with a nice cream cheese frosting. I think i might have to make this again an re-review it. If you are thinking of making this dont be dicouraged by this review!

Great recipe.  I used it to make cupcakes.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was my batter bubbled up a little  over my pans in the oven.  I was able to cut off the extra when they were done though, so, no problems.  Great texture and flavor.  Perfect for decorating.  I did use 1 whole cup cocoa as other reviewers suggested, and I used half dark/half regular.  I will make again whenever I make chocolate cake.  It was very easy.  Thanks for the recipe shirleyo!

I absolutely love this recipe. Sometimes I sub the boiling water for hot coffee and use a bit more cocoa powder. I have changed this recipe to serve 72 using the calculating tool and it works just as well.  Always and I mean always a crowd pleaser.

Very easy basic chocolate cake recipe.  I did have a little trouble getting this out of the pan, also the cooking time was a little out.  I had to cook for an additional 20 minutes, as it will still uncooked in the middle.  I finished it off with Chocolate Ganache (This was excellent).  Not a bad cake, but the taste was not quite there for me. To be honest, I don't think I will be using the recipe again.

This is the best chocolate cake!! The only thing I change is to use Hershey's Special Dark cocoa instead of regular cocoa. I always frost the cake with "chocolate frosting 1 by Tianne" from this site and everyone loves it!

The cake is awesome.  It's easier than making a box cake and it turns out rich, moist, and delicious every time.  I bake mine in two medium spingform pans for about 45 minutes. You can substitute strong, HOT coffee for the boiling water for a richer flavor.  I've also made cupcakes in two 12-cupcake pans and bake them for 25 minutes.  Next time I'm going to try and add 1 cup cocoa.  :)

A very nice cake, I have to say. Super easy, satisfying taste. Nothing too gourmet or difficult, and it turned out perfectly (which doesn't always happen for me!). As per other reviewers, I reduced the amount of boiling water added by a hair (maybe from one cup to 4/5 of a cup). Oh yes, and I cooked it for way longer than called for, but that could just be my oven. I just waited and waited 'til a toothpick came out clean, and when I finally took it out, it was perfect.

This recipe was easy to follow and quick to prepare. My cake rose perfectly; I baked it in a 9x13 pan, for about 40 minutes, and it could maybe have used a bit more.  The end result was light and airy- if you are looking for a heavy, dense cake, this is not it! What you would expect chocolate cake to be - not overly chocolate-y, and it is not an amazing, unique taste, but it is very moist, and great topped with a nice fudge icing or even alone(I like plain cake for some reason!) Be sure to have with a glass of milk! :)

I was pleasantly suprised!!  This cake had me a little scared because the batter was going to be thin so I almost skipped over it.  Then I saw the reviews and they were all very good, so I thought what the heck, I'll try it.  Excellent!!! Even better than the chocolate cake recipes I have in my HERSHEY dessert recipe book!!!!  Very easy to make and quick. VERY MOIST!!!  She wasn't lying when she said the batter would be thin!!  WOW!  But I don't care!  The cake turns out wonderful!  I finally found a great chocolate cake that is easy and better(not to mention healthier) than the boxed cakes.  I will be making again very soon as cupcakes for my daughter's birthday party!!

This is the same recipe that is on the back of the Hershey's Cocoa tin. I love this recipe! I do use a cup of HOT, STRONG coffee instead of boiling water though, it really enhances the chocolate. So delicious and moist!

Wonderful as a cake or cupcakes!  If making cupcakes, reduce the baking time to 20 minutes (took me a batch or two to figure that out!) Fill the cupcake tins to not quite 3/4 full or they will overflow onto the pan and make it difficult to remove.  Frosted with the Rich Chocolate Frosting recipe, sprinkled with a little decorative sugar, placed in individual cupcake boxes and now had a wonderful little holiday gift for family and friends!

I was looking for a simple chocolate cake recipe for a spur of the moment dessert for the fam. The cake was moist and very chocolaty. My 5 year old, a huge chocolate fan, loved it. It is very dense, so if you prefer a lighter cake, this might not be your recipe. I baked it in 2 round pans and frosted/filled it with chocolate whipped cream(heavy whipping cream, cocoa powder, and confectioners sugar). It turned out great, and was just what I was looking for.

I subsited for almond milk, coconut oil, hot coffee instead of boiling water.  mmmmm good oh boy this is good.  This was soupy, but I followed measured amounts and came out great.  You can tell when it's done when the kids come out of room asking what that smell is :). foolproof.

This cake is one of the best.  It was delicious and moist.  I followed the recipe to the T and it came out perfectly.  I lined my pans with wax paper to avoid the pans sticking.

This is my go-to chocolate cake recipe. Way better than a mix. It doesn't have that artificially light texture cake mixes tend to have. I use 1 cup of hot coffee instead of the water.

This was very good!  I got nervous after I took it out of the oven it did fall a bit.  I cooled it off, frosted it and put it in the fridge overnight.  It was heaven!  Will definitely make again....

This cake is perfect!  I used chocolate milk instead of plain milk and strong coffee instead of boiling water and the result was better than I had hoped for.  I did not have a problem with the cake sticking to the pan.  I greased the pans and sprinkled cocoa on the bottom.  I will make again and again!

This was an amazing cake! Even my picky daughter has been eating it, and she NEVER eats cake.

After reading a couple of the reviews, I increased the cocoa powder to 1c, and I used butter instead of oil (since I can taste oil in cake).

This cake was great. I followed the other reviewers advice of upping cocoa to 1 cup, lining cake pan with parchment after butter/flouring sides, turning off oven five minutes before time was up and refrigerating overnight once cooled. Cake did not stick to the pan, was perfectly moist even after staying unfrosted for 24 hours, and had a good texture and taste. I filled with seedless raspberry preserves, covered with semi-sweet ganache and decorated with chocolate whipped cream.

Okay, I was initially going to review this with 4 stars, but trust the reviews that say it's better the next day! It is easy to make and it tasted alright when I first made it. I iced and decorated for my daughter's school party the following day and when I got there to serve the cake, it tasted out of this world! I can't comprehend how it did that, but it really did! It's very moist and even sticky (clean up isn't too much fun, make sure to use parchment paper!) Yum! Thanks!

Made this for my hubbys birthday! This cake is delicious! Very moist! My hubby has requested that I not go back to cake mixes...now I just need a yellow cake to impress him with! I made this as a 9x13 baked 40 minutes. It came out beautiful and not flat like most cakes are nowadays!

I made this recipe into cupcakes- they came out really good! The only negative thing is that they were a little chewy. Also, they overflowed, and that was after I halfed the recipe and made 15 cupcakes. Maybe it is just my new oven. Overall, I would say that it is really good and extremely easy!

Made in a bundt pan (43 min at 350) and I could not have asked for better!  Dense, moist and wonderfully chocolatey!  Tasted even better the next day! Love this recipe!

Delicious!  Like another reviewer, I halved the recipe and it made 12 cupcakes.  The batter was really liquidy, so I used a liquid measuring cup to pour it into the cupcake liners.

I frosted them with my Grandma's cocoa frosting.  Homemade frosting is much more important than homemade cake!

**Melt together 5 tbsp butter or margarine with 5 tbsp cocoa add 1 lb powdered sugar and a little milk to mix. ** I used a hand mixer to smooth out the frosting, and piped them on to the cupcakes.

I love that the recipe can be made with "staple" ingredients.  This one is going in the family recipe book.

They were awesome, and I am my kids' hero :)

For a non-baker like myself, this was a GREAT recipe!  I had *most* ingredients on hand (missing the cocoa), and it was so easy to follow the directions.  I made this cake into cupcakes - cooked for 17 minutes (in semi-high altitude) and they turned out perfect!  Even peeled away from the wrappers perfectly (can't say that happens with cake mixes).

Thank you for sharing this review - I became a baking superstar mom in my house!

Man oh man! This recipe saved my tail this weekend! I had mini cupcakes to make for a wedding, and 3 hours before I was supposed to deliver them, my original recipe failed...probably bad leaveners. In any case, I was out of most of my ingredients and didn't have time to run to the store. I frantically searched for a quick, EASY chocolate cake recipe that didn't require too many ingredients and came across this one. Tried it....LOVED IT! It was SO easy and SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO very tasty- this will be my standard from now on!

I made this today for my son's 8th birthday. We halved the recipe to make 12 cupcakes. They are so yummy. We couldn't wait to let them cool and ate 1 already. Now daddy needs to hurry and get home so we can enjoy the rest.

My 5yo wanted to make a cake so I chose this recipe based on it's fabulous reviews.  It was surprisingly easy to make.  In fact, my little girl made it with very little help from me.

When I added the cup of boiling water to the batter I was sure I screwed something up as I had never seen cake batter that thin.  I reread the directions and went ahead and poured it into 2 8" cake pans and still had  little left over so I poured the remaining batter in an additional 8" pan and it was about 1/2 full.  The cake came out beautifully!  Very moist!  We frosted ours and added various sprinkles for decoration and served it immediately.  (she couldn't wait)  Delish!

This is a really good cake recipe. However, the first time I made it it stuck to the bottom of the pan and was a huge mess. (No idea why you would flour the bottom of the pans.) I started over using parchment paper to line the bottom of the pans. It worked out beautifully! The cake was very moist and not too sweet. I did up the chocolate to a cup but aside from those minor changes the recipe is wonderful!

What a fantastic recipe! This was easy to make and tasted light, but rich. Do not be afraid of the thin consistency of the final batter! I was very scared at how thin it was (almost like water), but after baking it, I was SUPER happy with the final texture and taste! Highly recommended .

I substituted "no sugar added" apple sauce for the oil, and it turned out great! I also added a bag of chocolate chips for extra chocolatey deliciousness (but don't forget to coat them in flour first, or they'll all sink to the bottom, especially since this batter is really thin)! YUM!

I think this is probably the BEST chocolate cake I have ever made and eaten!!!...I did up the cocoa to 1 cup per other reviewers suggestions. Also, ran out of regular cocoa so the frosting had 1/2 reg cocoa and 1/2 Hershey's special dark cocoa...AMAZING!!!   This is exactly the same recipe on the Hershey Cocoa box

Wonderful cake.  I made it in  9X13 pan and it took about 50 minutes to cook.  For those of you worried about what type of cocoa powder to use - I used Hersheys and it turned out fine.  In my mind that *is* a quality ingredient!  Like others I used coffee instead of water - couldn't taste the coffee but the cake was amazing.

Hmmmmmm...I made these into cupcakes and they sorta looked like brownies:/ I wanted to fill them, but they were too flat to be filled. Still good, though!

A friend, who is also a reviewer on this site, pointed me in the direction of this recipe. It reminds me of one I had years ago, but the  recipe was lost. It is easy to prepare, very moist, doesn't need icing and is a great "unexpected company" recipe. I was glad to be reminded of the one bowl chocolate cake.

Made this last night and everyone loved it.  I ended up doing a half recipe (didn't realize I was short on sugar) but I did add more cocoa then half.  It calls for 3/4 of a cup but I added a half cup of cocoa due to others saying it made a difference.  It was so moist and had such a rich flavor.  I also wanted to mention how EASY it is.  It's really hard to mess this one up, and that's why I like it too.

Made this for my dad's birthday, but no one really liked the texture or the taste. This cake does not have a fine crumb and IS dense, but mine came out a bit rubbery!  I skipped the baking soda, and used sunflower oil instead of vegetable.

So so easy and delicious. It's nice and moist. Don't get discouraged when you add the water, it does look weird but it will turn out ok. I used the Texas chocolate frosting with this and it was fantastic. Soooo decadent.

The main problem for me was the texture and lack of substance to the cake.  It's hard to explain, but it didn't taste like a homemade recipe.  It was too light in texture, too crumbly, and light on flavor.  Yes, it was very easy, and moist...  but I was disappointed in the finished product.  It had a slightly bitter taste, probably because of the Hershey's cocoa.  I'll try a different recipe next time.

Want to make this a healthier cake? This is the only chocolate cake that I bake and eat. I use only whole wheat flour with just under a 1/2 cup oil and I use olive, yes, olive oil. I use a a cup and a half sugar. I use a half teaspoon of salt,  3/4 teaspoon baking soda, and no sodium baking powder all which lower the sodium content. At times, I use no salt at all. You really don't need salt when using baking soda and powder. The whole family loves how moist it turns out and is healthy to boot. I use no frosting as it needs none but may try to frost it just for a change.

a friend gave me this recipe about 12 yrs ago.it is the very best in chocolate cakes in my opinion.u can't do any thing wrong with it.i've made it when i was low on cocoa, another time with only 1 1/2cups sugar,and another time only had 1 egg.it turned out every time.this is a magical recipe.wouldn't try any other. u can't improve on perfection.if some of u haven't tried this i suggest u do, u won't be sorry. i us it to make chocolate trifle, zuccotto, layer it with buttercream, ganache it,or just have it plain, or w/yogurt.thanks shirleyo for sharing .now others can enjoy it as much as i do.5 stars +

This is a very good recipe.  For a quick chocolate fix this is my go to recipe.  I changed the servings to 6 and then baked 2 little cakes using my onion soup bowls (the ones with a handle) and they were awesome!  I had to bake these for 27 minutes and they came out perfect.

My husband liked this as it was extremely moist.  I liked it, but thought it came out a little too soft, like it hadn't baked long enough.  But I've made it twice, cooked it a bit longer and used a bundt and everyone seems to like it.  It definitely is moister than any other receipe I've tried.  Will keep this on my favorite list!

This is a very good, simple, and easy to make recipe. I upped the amount of cocoa to 1 cup as suggested by others and found that the cake does taste better after letting it sit for about one day. I frosted it with 'Satiny Chocolate Glaze' and it was a nice treat. I did however have problems with the cake not coming out of the pan even after greasing it and flouring it - perhaps next time I will try a new method.

The cake was good but when using Hershey's Cocoa i found the same recipe on the back of the Hershey's cocoa Box, so that's why i rate it 3 stars, wonder who copied who's! but it was a good tasting cake.

If I could rate this any higher I would. This is one of the best chcolate cakes I've had and I am a pastry chef so that says a lot! My students all love this cake. It's so rich that none of my students could eat seconds. We frosted it with a simple fudge icing.  The fudge icing is as follows: Sift twice 3 c powdered sugar with 2/3 cup dark cocoa powder. Then stir in 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted, 1/3 cup milk, and 1 tsp vanilla.

This is a great cake. Normally I can't bake to save my life, but I really wanted a chocolate cake. I had all the ingredients, and the only change I made was I used 1 cup of hot coffee rather than boiling water. It actually cooked in 25 minutes for me. Delicious and moist!

This cake didn't rise and it ran all over my oven.  It was so moist that it stuck to the pans.  The flavor was fantastic, but it's just not made for two round pans.  Probably would be just fine in a bundt or 9x13 pan.

For my husband's birthday, he requested a cake made from scratch.    I used this cake mix to make a double layer 13x9 cake with chocolate icing in between the layers and a topping of chocolate ganche....DEATH BY CHOCOLATE.  This mix produced a moist cake that has a rich, chocolatey taste without being overly sweet (even with the 2 cups of sugar) and was easy to manipulate into layers.  It is also easy to mix all the dry ingredients into a ziploc bag to keep onhand for future reference.  The only changes I made were using half all purpose flour and half cake flour.  To make a 13x9 sheet cake, you will need to bake at 350 for approx 45 minutes.  One note....do not be distressed by the thinness of the batter....it will bake up correctly. I recommend a tall glass of milk to go with this as the perfect compliment.

SUPER DELICIOUS!! I used buttermilk in place of the milk.  I ended up with 3- 8" layers.  I used the "Rich Chocolate Frosting" on here and it came out wonderfully.  The cake was so moist and chocolately!!  Can't wait to make this cake again soon!!  

UPDATE 8/11/08-
I made cupcakes with this recipe- I ended up with (24), I filled the muffin cups 2/3-3/4 full and they came out perfectly.  I tried sprinkling choc chips on top just before baking, however, I don't think I'll do that again, I personally like the recipe better with that addition.  I didn't use buttermilk this time, I definately noticed a difference, the buttermilk is a MUST and makes the cake much more moist!

I made this cake last week for my daughter's birthday party.  I doubled it to make a double layer 13X9 cake and it turned out beautifully.  The cake was VERY simple... I usually have the ingredients on hand... and it stayed moist and yummy for the three days it took for us to eat it all up.  I also took leftovers to work, and my boss had seconds he liked it so much.  The batter is very thin... don't let that scare you.  It comes out just right.  This was literally easier than a boxed mix, and soooo much tastier!

The best chocolate cake I have ever made! I added one ripe banana into the batter and the texture was perfectly moist.  The slight banana flavor combined nicely with the rich chocolate.

This recipe was only ok for me.  I'm glad that people said the batter was thin, because I would have thought I really messed up!  It was pretty good the first time, but I made this cake a second time and I actually found that it tasted pretty bland.  It was't very sweet or chocolatey.  Maybe next time I will add the coffee instead of water like other people had suggested.

Wow - this is definately a cake that will become a part of my permanent collection! What a fantastic recipe! It is so easy to make. I must admit that I was skeptical when I stirred in the hot water and the batter was so runny. But despite my concerns, it rose perfectly and turned out wonderfully! Such a great texture, moist and chocolately. I used a yummy chocolate frosting and sprinkles on top. Took this to work for a colleagues birthday and I had the whole marketing department around my desk eating chocolate and commmenting that it was one of the best they'd ever had! One person mentioned it that it was "just like grandma used to make". VERY glad I've discovered this recipe!

Great texture and flavor--JUST like a chocolate cake out of a box.  I love that there was no butter in it.  I made cupcakes and they rose so much in the oven it made a huge mess and had to run the self-cleaning cycle when I was done.  I also had to trim them before icing them but I got to eat the scraps so it wasn't a total loss (hee hee).  I wouldn't change the amount of baking soda because I really enjoyed the texture of it but beware: if you make cupcakes with this, only fill them half full.

This is the first chocolate cake from scratch that i've found to be excellent.  i used soy-milk to make it non-dairy with no problem.  i frosted it with a non-dairy whipped topping that i mixed together with crushed chocolate sandwich cookies.

Wow... this cake is so moist and delicious and so simple to make. I added 1T instant coffee to the boiled water to enhance the chocolate and I used very good cocoa. I also iced it with Cream Cheese Frosting II (also added cocoa to make it more chocolatey... as if it needed it) and it was perfect. YUM!

5 stars for this! Used Ghirardhelli cocoa and it was great! Put a Cool Whip kind of frosting on it so it wasn't too sweet. I baked it in a 13x9 pan and everyone in the family loved it. Thanks.

I made an icecream cake out of this scrumptious moist cake.  I cooked the cake in a 9x13 baking pan, let the cake cool, cut the cake in half (lenghtwise), spread softened vanilla icecream on top of the bottom layer, put the top layer of cake on top of the layer of icecream and froze it.  When it was frozen, I cut it into squares, drizzled it with whipped cream and chocolate syrup.  Yummy, yummy, yummy icecream cake.

This cake was moist and flavorful.  I would make it again.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The chocolate flavor was great. I used a 9 x 13 glass pan and it worked great.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This was perfect. It's the first cake I've made from scratch. I made it for my husband for Valentines Day, and we both loved it. It was very easy (and my electric mixers are broke, so mixing by hand is fine also) This will be my chocolate cake recipe from now on, thank you!!!

Loved this recipe.  I was looking for something fast, easy for my son's birthday.  I had all the ingredients on hand and it took only a few minutes to prepare.  Everyone loved it and my husband said it was the best cake he ever had!!! I frosted it with a cream cheese vanilla frosting.

Tried it with a bit more of RitterSport chocolate and it was fabulous. Added some whipped cream and a strawberry as garnish. It was heavenly! However I left it in the fridge overnight and it became a bit too sticky... any remedies for that or am I doing something wrong?

Great recipe. Used what I had in the house: subbed light brown sugar for white, buttermilk for milk, and cake flour for regular. Still turned out wonderful, chocolaty and moist. As recommended, iced with butter cream; like to try peanut butter icing next time. 
 It's a fool-proof recipe. THANX!!!

Awesome cake! Sooo easy and fast, but so moist and everyone loved it. Halved it for a 9 inch circle cake. I used mostly dutch process cocoa and 2tbsp hershey's cocoa. Also used half half-and-half and half 2% milk for the milk :)

Make sure your baking powder is not expired.  We often have a can in the cupboard, that is not used much, and expires.  If it is expired it will negatively affect your recipe.

My 14 year old son wanted to make a cake for the first time. I found this recipe, liked it's simplicity. It was delicious! He did it all himself, and only had to start over when he confused tablespoons for teaspoons. :) The texture is amazing, and it wasn't overly sweet. Excellent recipe we will use again.

this is my staple, I make it in 3 round pans for a layered cake, I make it as 24 cupcakes or in a large rectangle pan, it is fail proof, moist, easy and quick. I have made this recipe more than 60 times, never a flop. We love it. Forgiving and versatile

Just got done eating this cake and it was very good. I followed directions exactly except for adding the full cup of cocoa. The cake was very moist,actually that is an understatement. To me the cake almost had more of a brownie like consistency than that of a cake. Since it was so moist it was nearly impossible to cut or get out in one piece even though I carefully lined pan with parchment paper. 
Flavor was pretty good and I'm sure it would've been better if I had used better cocoa so that's on me. I would probably make this cake again but not if it was for something special where it needed to look nice. It's just way to moist and doesn't hold together well enough for me to want to decorate.

Combine with "One Minute Chocolate Icing" for a pretty quick-and-easy, but impressive, dessert. The batter always seems wrong because it's so thin, but it turns out perfectly airy and moist every time. I agree with other reviewers that the cake seems to be better after a day in the fridge, not sure why, but it's an excellent make ahead cake.

This chocolate cake literally takes all other chocolate cakes I've ever made!! It's rich and creamy. It's not too sweet, too anything! ITS P-E-R-F-E-C-T!! I made absolutely no changes to this recipe. I follow the directions to a T!! I skimmed through some bad reviews and am perplexed as to how it could have gone wrong! Oh.. I did use ghiradelli unsweetened cocoa; if that means anything to anyone. This is the winner :D

This is my go-to chocolate cake recipe. I saw where somebody says it doesn't layer well, but it does! Every time I have made this I have layered it and have never had any issue. One thing to note though is that this cake is much, much better the second or third day.

I doubled the recipe because I made (2) 9x13 cakes and increased the cooking time to 40-45 minutes. The cakes were moist and tasted excellent. My daughter who doesn't normally eat cake had a piece of this every night until it was gone. Will definitely make this again.

When I added the boiling water, it turned the batter to a watery liquid.  It didn't regain its consistency in the oven.  I was using spring form pans, and it leaked all over my oven too.  Since the recipe is otherwise very straightforward, I can't imagine trying it again.

Love this recipe! I have used it many times and it always works wonderfully! I tend to add more cocoa because I love lots of chocolate but it isn't necessary. I have tried it with a variety of flours from regular all-purpose to rice flour and have had no difficulties even with those changes. Definitely a good go-to cake recipe, very easy and quick!

This is a GREAT receipe and has been since the 60's. This was first published by Peg Bracken in the "I hate to cook, book". Its well worth a read, there are other great quick clever ideas.

First of all, this is absolutely the best chocolate cake I've ever had in my life. My husband who is a chocolate cake hater, licked his desert plate clean when I served him this one. 

I altered the recipe a bit by reducing the sugar to 1.5 cup and mix white and brown sugar (was out of white sugar at that time) and I forgot to include the vanilla extract. 

I frost it with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this website and double the vanilla extract called for to complement the lack of it from the cake (and reduced the sugar required). 

Result: A Chocolate Cake to Die For. Thank you for this amazingly easy and delicious recipe.

Phenominal!   Made only 1 change, upped the cocoa powder to 1 cup as other suggested.  The flavor is spot on and the cake is soft and moist-not dense AT ALL!!  Will def. use this again and again.
PS-who cares if it came from a cocoa can and someone posted it-I never would have found it otherwise!

Wonderful recipe! It was so easy (I even thought I messed up somehow because of how easy it was). When it finished it tasted like heaven! It was chocolate, moist, and airy.

Love this recipe. I have made it so many times I have it memorized. I make mine in a bundt pan and bake for 50 min. I frost it while it's still pretty warm and it looks great. I get requests for this cake often for people's birthdays.

I've made this recipe twice but both times were rather far apart so I didn't alter the recipe the second time. I followed it as written both times. The second time I did use a different pan, and it boiled over on one side (regular cheap bakeware). It also fell in the middle, making it pretty ugly until I turned it out upside down. Granted, I live at a high altitude (about 1 mile) but the amount it fell seemed worse than other things I've tried. As such I think I'll be looking for a different easy cake recipe that uses less baking powder/soda that works better where I live. However, the taste of this cake is very delicious and chocolately. It IS too thin of a batter for much like sprinkling in chocolate chips or anything though.

Amazing!  If you're looking for an easy, delicious chocolate cake recipe, you found it!  I made it just as it said, and the cake turned out as promised.  It was very rich and chocolately....almost like a dark chocolate, and very moist.  Make sure you mix well, as it says to avoid lumps.  I didn't have a mixer, so I had a few lumps, but that was totally my fault and the cake was still delicious!

I tried it when it was a little warm, too gooey, but I let it cool and it was much better.  It is not what I think what a cake should be, it's between a brownie, fudge and cake.  I will try with a half cup of water instead of a full cup.  I love the easiness, just a little moist for me.  Different, but I liked it.  I used a chocolate butter cream icing.

This cake fell into 3 different pieces per layer after I let it set. Putting it together and frosting it couldn't even save it. It crumbed worse than any cake I have ever made. It was dry, too. I followed the ingredients and method to the letter. I used King Arthur's Flour products. This was an expensive disaster.

Excellent cake recipe. I'm not a great baker, and this was simple and fun enough for me to attempt with my four-year-old. I found that two 9-inch cake pans needed less than 30 minutes, but my oven's a bit fast. Combined with a chocolate cream cheese frosting and it was terrific. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this cake for my mom's birthday last week.  I used a simple vanilla buttercream frosting on the outside and my entire family loved it.  My mom was amazed this was home-made and not from the store, it was quite a hit! Great recipe. :)

We had an after dinner chocolate craving and needed an easy recipe using cocoa. We chose this recipe because of the reviews and simple ingredients. This cake is AWESOME! We followed the recipe EXACTLY, no changes. However, we did use a 9X13 glass dish and baked for 38 minutes at 350 degrees. The batter was a little thin, but we expected that from the reviews. I used Nestle's Tollhouse Cocoa. YUM! And we iced the cake with a rich homemade chocolate chip icing. We found that recipe on www.cooks.com (NEVER FAIL CHOCOLATE CHIP FROSTING)..... This cake is so moist!

Honestly, the worst chocolate recipe ever. It was messy and caused a lot of effort for something totally not worth it. I was expecting a delicious, moist, lovely cake, but instead I got a horrible liquid of some sort. It didn't even taste eatable... not impressed at all. VERY disappointed.

Followed it word for word and ended up with a liquid mass inside an inch of crust. Neither tasted particularly appetizing. Disappointed.

Delicious and simple.  This cake disappeared quickly.

Made twice - once as listed for a double layer birthday cake.   Made again today as cupcakes for a Halloween party.   Made 24 cupcakes - baked for 20 - 22 minutes.   Because the recipe is so thin you might want to put the batter into something you can pour to keep from making a mess when pouring out the cupcakes.

This is now my go to recipe for chocolate cake. Since using it for my mother's birthday cake I have used the recipe about 3 times in 3 weeks. Very moist. I made it into a bundt cake (bake for an hour) and drizzled it with the allrecipe recipe for satiny glaze.

I know this will sound strange, but this cake has the fluffiness and the moisture that usually only comes from a box cake mix.  It is really really good.  If you don't want the complexity of Sandy's chocolate cake (my very favorite recipe here), this is a good choice, throw it all in one bowl and mix it up.  I followed someone's suggestion and put it in a 9X13 pan for 40 minutes.  Perfect.  Canned frosting and you are good to go.  It doesn't get easier than that.

I was looking for a quick and easy chocolate cake and I found it! Super easy and I didn't even use an electric mixer. All of the ingredients came together great. I was skeptical of the runny batter, but it made for a wonderfully moist outcome. I did a single 9x13 and baked it for 35 minutes. It's the perfect balance of sweet and chocolate without making your teeth hurt!

Admittedly, I have not made any other cake from scratch. This was my first attempt, and even though I forgot the vanilla extract, it turned out FAB-U-LOUS. I could not be happier with it.  I just ate a piece without frosting and it was just so good. It is so moist! I did take the advice of a few other reviewers and upped the cocoa to 1 cup.  It turned out great! And yes, I am also thankful that the recipe warned about the thin batter. That would have really thrown me off! :)

This cake is delicious, moist and chocolatey. It was also really easy to make. I ran into problems in the baking and it still came out ok! I just made one cake instead of two, and poured it into a springform pan. I realised all too late that the pan had leaked all over the inside of my oven! Luckily it had only been in the oven for one minute so I poured it into a non-springform pan and turned the oven off so I could clean it. The batter sat there for at least 30 mins, which probably wasn't good for it, until I scraped off most of the batter inside the oven and pre-heated the oven again. I ended up baking the cake for about 40 mins all up and it turned out quite well, especially considering what it had been through. It is a bit crumbly so I had problems transferring it to a wire rack and then to a serving plate...had a few bits of cake break off the bottom. I made this cake for my family so presentation doesn't really matter. I covered it in chocolate frosting and put sprinkles on top. Will be making this again, hoepfully without the mishaps!

I made cupcakes with this recipe and they were very good. I frosted them with creamy chocolate frosting and froze the excess- they were great even after a few weeks  in the freezer and I can't wait to make them again!

This is the same recipe off of a famous label cocoa powder box.  But is absolutely delicious!  There is also a recipe for Perfect chocolatey frosting on the same cocoa label, and it is the perfect frosting for this cake.  YUM!

Great recipe. It is very moist and tasty but not overly sweet. To me this is the perfect replacement for boxed cake mix. My first attempt at this recipe (and baking a cake from scratch in general) was a success. If you are new to cake baking, try this recipe- it is easy and yields tasty results.

This saved me today as my son told me last minute about having to bring a dozen cupcakes to scouts tonight. I didn't have a cake mix handy, and had all the ingredients to make this. So glad I tried this!! Perfect just the way it's written and quick to throw together too!! YUMMY and moist!

Just made this cake with my daughter and it didn't turn out well at all. Was dry and tough and I baked it for 30 minutes (the lower end of the time range the recipe suggests) - so I didn't overcook it based on the recipe. Maybe the time needs to be shortened. Very disappointed!

This cake does turn out moist and delicious each time. It is especially good for chocolate lovers. Works well for cakes and cupcakes as well.  I have been using it for years - it is exactly the same recipe that is on the Hershey's Cocoa container.

I made this cake for my husband's b-day. It was a huge hit! Super moist, fudgy, and very rich! I used 1 cup of cocoa and put chocolate ganache(I found recipe on this site) on top. Excellent!

This was so easy that I considered making up double the dry ingredients and keeping half in a zip-loc as homemade cake mix for the next time I need dessert in a hurry.  Very moist, very chocolatey, and made entirely from "pantry ingredients" in 10 minutes flat.  Made as cupcakes, baking 18 minutes at 350.

This is a delicious and easy cake.  My daughter made it for her teacher's birthday, and to share with the class.  I got distracted while it was baking, and it got overcooked.  Still, it got rave reviews and I'll definitely make it again.  I used a vanilla buttercream frosting because I ran out of cocoa.  Next time the frosting will be chocolate too.

I loved this recipe. I think the 3/4 cup cocoa powder is the perfect amount of chocolate flavor, and the runny batter worked wonderful for the cupcakes I made with this. Not overly moist and dense as some of the recipes using a mix and box of pudding: it's the regular smooth light texture of perfect cake. Will make again and again, thanks so much for sharing :)

I baked this for my brother's birthday and it was quite a hit, very rich and chocolatey. Of course I did use an extra 1/4 cup of cocoa and butter instead of oil...

I am rating this three stars since it stuck very badly to the pan even though I greased and floured it.  If I tried to make this again, I would probably line my pan with parchment paper.

This is the original Hershey's Perfectly Chocolate chocolate cake recipe my mom was making 40 years ago.....simply the best chocolate cake out there.  Definitely give this recipe a go and don't get put off with the watery mix after the boiling water goes in, it bakes up perfectly.  I use it for cupcakes and it works fine, also doubles and makes a large sheet cake for larger crowds.  You can't go wrong!

Very light cake, simple to make. Not too sweet, perfect chocolate taste. Surprisingly the batter is very watery, as planned, but bakes up fine. I didn't have any baking soda, still came out great. Baked in a 9x13 pan. No frosting included in the recipe.

You WILL wonder about the runny batter.  The first time I made it I only jotted down the ingredients and baking info but didn't look at reviews.  I was shocked at how thin it was, even before adding the boiling water.  But I was assured when I ran back to the laptop to check the reviews.  It really is runny, but I've made cupcakes with this recipe several times now and they are to die for!  So moist!  I only had half the necessary cocoa powder last time and it was still delicious.    As I virtually always do, I used whole wheat pastry flour and it turned out fantastic.  Next time I'll sub applesauce for half the oil and I have no doubt it will still be great.

It made the entire house smell wonderful through the night after I removed it from the oven.  I haven't tried it yet, but it looks amazing!  I used dark chocolate frosting, and decorated it with crumbled Oreo cookies and gummi worms.  I hope my boyfriend likes it!  :)

Super easy and very good.  It is the same recipe from the can of Hershey's cocoa powder.  I made an 8" square and 12 cupcakes.  The batter is very thin and soupy, but it bakes up wonderfully.

I made this recipe as 2 dozen cupcakes for a friend's birthday last week, and the cupcakes turned out beautifully.  As has been said by many, don't let the extremely runny batter scare you.  But DO be careful not to overfill your pans.  I used a lipped measuring cup to pour the batter into my cupcake liners and had no problems.  Great recipe.  I did not give it 5 stars simply because I wanted something a bit richer.  Overall, though, it's a keeper.

We all really liked this cake.  I did use 1 cup of cocoa (instead of 3/4c) and used both regular cocoa and the special dark cocoa (about 1/4 dark to 3/4 regular).  Very tasty cake!  Used a chocolate butter creme frosting recipe from this site.

I make this cake exactly as written and it's always perfect. It's good as soon as it cools, but even better after being stored in the refrigerator. It really improves with age, if it lasts that long. : ) I frost it with an icing made of butter, whipping cream, cocoa, vanilla, and powdered sugar. SO GOOD!

Very good! Moist and delicious! Followed recipe exactly (except used 1 cup of cocoa) and frosted with "Rich Chocolate Frosting" from this site. I made 2 layers, and in between them I put a filling made with 1/4 cup sugar, 12 oz frozen raspberries, and 8 oz cream cheese. It was very good!

Couldn't get it to come out of the pan, it was kind of mushy.  I followed the recipe exactly and waited 10+ minutes to try and remove from the pan.  It tasted ok, but isn't anything that I would serve.  I was really hoping this receip would turn out for me.  Now i need to bake a different birthday cake.

You will never use a box cake again.  Seriously.  This is just as easy, you already have the ingredients, and it is delicious!  Tender and dark.  It has a perfect texture for a cake, and a nice rich chocolately flavour.  (for the topping, I mix one can of sweetened condensed milk with two bars of unsweetened chocolate in the microwave.  Chop the chocolate so it melts easily- so easy, so rich and thick)    This cake is a chocolate lover's dream.

I didn't get to taste it--made cupcakes for a cupcake walk--but my children who did raved about it, and keep asking me to make more.  The batter flavor and consistency reminds me of my favorite chocolate sheet cake recipe.  I used it with the Chocolate Cookie Buttercream Frosting from Allrecipes--minus the cocoa--and I can vouch that the frosting was delicious!  :-)

This is probably the best chocolate cake I have ever eaten. The only thing is that it's almost too moist. I adde more flour, and had it in the oven for another 10 minutes, I don't know if it was because I halfed the recipe. 5 starts anyway, if someone can give me some advide about frostings/fillings to this cake..I would be glad to know.

This is the exact recipe for "Perfectly Chocolate Chocolate Cake" from the back of the Hershey's Unsweetened Cocoa can. I've been making it for years. It really is the best chocolate cake ever. Frost it with the "Perfectly Chocolate Chocolate Frosting" recipe also on the back of the same cocoa can.

Very easy to make, though the boiling water step threw me off. It definitely does have a strong baking soda taste, and I didn't find it that flavorful. (Topped with Pilsbury Vanilla frosting, but it almost completely overpowers the cake's flavor.) Will keep on the lookout for other cake recipes.

This cake was very good! I made it the night before, added 1 cup of cocoa and it was delicious! Did a double layer cake with chocolate frosting and crunchie bar candy pieces in between the layers and on top! yum!

I followed the recipe exactly. It's a great chocolate cake recipe! This was easy to make, very moist and chocolatey, and was gobbled up quickly by our kids. It will be my new go-to recipe for chocolate cake. Thanks for sharing the reicpe, shirleyo.

This turned out perfectly and was very simple to make. My only complaint is that it tasted too much like cake from a mix.

Although I cut the sugar by 1/2 cup, the cake turned out perfectly sweet and moist, dense but still fluffy. Great recipe to have around for a quick crowd pleaser.

EXCELLENT!  Absolutely excellent!  This cake is very moist.  I am not the best cake baker in the world, so I have to work extra hard looking for "no fail" recipes. This is it! I used a 13 x 9 pan and baked about 40 minutes, then frosted with a chocolate cream cheese frosting.  No more box mixes for me!

I'm not a big chocolate cake fan, but made these for a friend's birthday. I'm a chocolate cake fan now! WOW! This is the first time I've made cake from scratch, not a box. I actually made cupcakes. I halved the recipe and made 12 cupcakes, and they cooked 25 minutes on 350. If you make cupcakes, make sure to fill cups only half full because they rise a lot. Don't be freaked out by the boiled water. It seemed way too soupy to me, but turned out great.

Love this recipe! Super moist, with much better flavor then a box mix. So easy! I'll never make another chocolate cake recipe again! Don't use less water...you get crispy edges.

This is a great cake, and it was pretty easy, too. It tastes just like the chocolate cakes my mom made when I was a child. I replaced the oil with unsweetened applesauce and there was no difference in taste (the family didn't know! and couldn't tell!) plus I saved 109 grams of fat and 920 calories. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great chocolate cake.  I didn't have any butter, that's why I picked this one.  It was easy to make and tasted great, very chocolatey.  After you add the boiling water it's very thin and runny, but that's okay it still works.  It wsn't fluffy like a store bought cake, but it was very moist.  My husband had a cake like this growing up and he thought this recipe was very good.  I made 1/2 the recipe and baked it in an 8-inch square pan, it worked fine.

YUMMY! This is such a wonderfully moist and delicious chocolate cake. Next time, though, I plan to use parchment paper to line the pans - I had some trouble getting the cakes out of the pans even though I greased and floured them. Great recipe!!

This is a very easy recipe to make; it's fast and really does require only one bowl to make. The batter will be runny but it fluffs up to a nice consistency. I did as some other reviewers suggested and added 1 cup of cocoa instead of what the recipe suggested since I am a chocolate fanatic. I made this cake for a friend's birthday and he loved it so. I will definitely make it again.

this was REALLY easy abd REALLY good! I am a terrible baker, but i couldn't mess this up! I used diluted coffe in place of water and a full cup of cocoa powder....yum! 1 hour in a bundt pan.

Chocolate glaze: mix cocoa, powdered sugar and a little milk until desired consistency. drizzle over cooled cake!

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful! When I put the boiled water in, I was afraid it was too thin, but it turned out with great texture. I baked it in a ten inch bundt pan and had to change the time of course. 50 minutes and it turned out perfectly! =)

This cake is astonishingly good and is even more amazing for how simple the recipe is.  This is the best recipe for a chocolate cake that I have ever found, and I have been baking chocolate cakes for 10 years.  I've made this recipe to the 't', and also increasing the cocoa powder to a full cup.  My preference is the little extra cocoa :)

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out fabulous! Very moist and good. I use cocoa powder instead of flour to "flour" the pans (so it doesn't leave white spots in the cake). Frosted with Rick's Buttercream Frosting. Topped with peanut butter chips and toasted pecans.

This is a great chocolate cake recipe.  You can find the exact recipe on the back of the Hershey's cocoa tin, and I've been making it for years--always with excellent results.  Not sure how someone could pass this off as their own recipe...  However, if you add one teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter and substitute hot coffee for the boiling water, the cake is absolutely divine!  I'd suggest using the frosting recipe that's also on the back of the Hershey's tin, as it goes perfectly with this cake.

Delicious and so simple!  Same exact recipe is on back of Hershey's unsweetened cocoa.  No reason to spend lots of time on other recipes.  This one is great.  Nice rich chocolate flavor.  I also frosted with Rich Chocolate Frosting (1/2 recipe).

I followed the directions to a T and it was great.  used for a black forest cake- poured liqueur on each layer, then filled with whipped cream and canned black cherries.  Finished by icing with whipped cream.  All my coworkers loved it! I will be using this recipe often.

AMAZING. I'm 14 and I made this for my friend's birthday 2 days ago. The SMELL of it was sooo chocolate-y (although maybe that's because I added some Ganache) that she took it out to share during lunchtime at school. All my friends loved it and now I need to bake 2 more for 2 people's birthdays... both next month! Oh, and I just want to say that after adding the water, the batter is REALLY runny but I found that adding any more flour to it makes it too heavy. And I added 3 tablespoons more of cocoa. Sifted, of course. Perfection!

This cake is nicely moist, and very good. It's also extremely easy to make. I made it for my daughter's birthday, and it was enjoyed by the whole family. It does make a very thin batter, but it bakes up beautifully into a very tasty cake. Make sure you grease and flour your cake pans well though, as it has a tendency to try and stick. I did increase the cocoa to one cup, but otherwise followed the directions, and it came out very well. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

This was a great recipe! Very moist cake and I thought it was also very chocolatey. The only thing I did different was used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. I will definitely be making this recipe again and again! :)

Wow.. this one is a keeper. No mess at all, easy to pour to the muffin pans (I made cupcakes). I baked 24 cupcakes, 350 degrees, for 25 mnts.

Absolutely lovely chocolate cake recipe!  I substituted hot coffee for the boiling water and it turned out perfectly.  Also added about 5 minutes to the cooking time.

Very easy to make and the result is a delicious and moist chocolate cake. I tried both in a cupcake and cake form, and both produce excellent results. Best to leave it for few hours to savour the chocolatey top! 

Definitely a keeper....

Super easy and pretty darn good. Not the most amazing cake I've ever eaten, but I would make it again. I had all the ingredients on hand and the cake was moist and good! I did use coffee instead of water.

I gave up chocolate for lent so I made this cake for Easter.  I used the 'Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting' for the filling and frosted with the 'Special Buttercream Frosting'.  The cake itself was so easy and came out great!  I took others advise and made it the night before so it could sit in the fridge.  I found that it was even better the third day so I can't wait to have another piece tonight!  Will make again and again since it doesn't really take any added work compared to a box cake, but it's nice to say it's from scratch!

I followed the recipe from the back of the Hershey's cocoa bag.
I used Droste cocoa and baked the cake in 2 9" round pans.  I split the layers and filled them with dark chocolate pudding and frosted the now 4 layer cake with milk chocolate butter cream.  This is a fantastic, moist cake.  My dh isn't a chocolate cake fan at all, but after one bite he couldn't stay out of this cake.  I kept it in the fridge because of the filling, I just let the sliced sit for 10 minutes before serving.  Don't use hot water-make sure it's boiling!  The boiling water brings out the chocolatey-ness of the cocoa.

Made this for a friend's birthday--was super moist and had just the right amount of chocolate! I already had all the ingredients in my pantry. This will definitely be an "old reliable" recipe in my collection.

A very nice and moist cake. I frosted this cake with Vanilla - Chocolate Powdered Sugar Frosting and I thought they complimented each other nicely.
A nice cake overall.

Warning: If you are looking for a rich dense chocolatey cake, this is NOT for you. The cake was very light, fluffy and moist but the taste was nothing special fresh from the oven (It tasted like cake from those boxed cake mixes). I am a huge chocolate fan and this cake just didn't have enough chocolate flavour for me. BUT I left it overnight in the fridge and it was SOOOO MUCH BETTER the next day. Much more dense and rich. Perfect with ice-cream!

Excellent chocolate cake. Moist and delicious. Used a 9x13 pan instead of a layer cake. Frosted with my favorite buttercream icing and served it to my family for Valentine's Day. A huge hit.

As a person who grew in the south and a strong southern cooker, dessert is very important especially after meals.This was a wonderful recipe. It reminded me a lt of my mother's wonderful triple layer cakes during holidays. It was very easy and super moist. I will use this again. But i cheated a little, i used ready made frosting

Couldn't be simpler!  I made it for my father-in-law's birthday last night, and it received rave reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly, then frosted it with cream cheese frosting.  The batter is extremely runny after you add the cup of boiling water, but don't let that concern you.  It is a fantastic cake, and I doubt I will even make a chocolate cake from a box again.

This chocolate cake was so easy, and absolutely scrumptious!
Me and my 7yr old neice made it last night.The only thing that we different~ My neice LOVES CHOCOLATE, so she suggested wanting pudding on her cake. So the only change we made was we spread chololate pudding between the two round cakes. YUMM-O
We also used the cream cheese chocolate frosing on this site submitted by Carol.
Will definately use again. Thank you

Good basic recipe!  It was nice and moist, but a little bit crumbly.  It didn't want to come out of the pan, so make sure to grease well.  The taste is very strong, so using a good cocoa powder is key.  I thought it tasted a bit more like a brownie than a cake, but the texture was perfect.

This cake is AMAZING!!! The first time I made it I had to remember the batter is suppose to be thin from the cup of boiling water. It stays moist from the first cut to the last (which was about two days in my house)!! I have already made this cake three times and it is the only chocolate cake I would ever make.

Unfortunatly I only got to lick the knife that I used to level the cake, but even that was good. I used a Mickey Mouse shaped pan, coated it well with Wilton's cake release and had no problems with the cake sticking to the pan or falling apart. I was a little nervous at how thin the batter was, but in the end it was a perfectly moist chocolate cake. I plan to make this again soon so I can try some.

Oh my goodness! This was better than a boxed mix by far! My cakes always seemed to come out tasting flat, but this is rich, moist and chocolaty. My compliments to the recipe submitter. This is now in my personal recipe box and my days of buying boxed mixes are over.

Wonderful recipe--moist and rich chocolate taste.  I sifted confectioners' sugar on the finished cake instead of frosting.  Delicious.  One thing I would note is that I used 8" pans and had to bake for about 50 minutes.

This is truly the most delicious chocolate cake I've ever eaten! AND it's sooo fast and easy to make, that it's almost embarrassing when everyone comes to you to say how great it is.  Equally great as cupcakes, too.  I went exactly by the recipe, by the way...and it is frighteningly thin looking...but only the first time.  Have no fear! :)

This is the only chocolate cake recipe I will be using from now on.  I made it the first time exactly according to the recipe and was so impressed with the results that I made it again with 100% whole wheat flour.  I honestly couldn't tell the difference; I ate almost the whole cake telling myself that I was just getting my whole grains...hehe.  It was very light and moist and was sufficient without frosting.  Good choice, and so easy!  ***UPDATE; I have started to add a little less liquid (maybe 1/4 cup less) with a little more cocoa (1-2 Tablespoons more), and it's fantastic.  For parties, I always frost this with a slightly modified version of Rich Chocolate Frosting on this site (more cocoa there too), and when I served it at my son's birthday party, my whole family said that it was the best chocolate cake they had ever had.  I've never heard so many compliments about a cake.  Sometimes I sub coffee for the water, too; this is a real winner.

This cake is rich, moist and INTENSELY chocolate. I spent a little more money to get a good quality cocoa and it was absolutely worth it! For those who may find the information helpful - this cake can be made with rice milk instead of regular milk. I don't know whether or not it changes the taste, but it comes out tasting fantastic, so if you're lactose intollerant, it's worth making the switch.

Somewhere on this website, I found a recipe for a mocha-rum icing.  I made it with chocolate liqeuer instead of rum. It worked very nicely with the cake.

The recipe is very good   I made cupcakes by decreasing the temp to 325.  I thought they would be too runny but they turned out terrific.  I will use again.

I felt this was good but something was missing. The cake was moist. But the consistency of the cake was almost like eating sponge cake.

This cake was delicious! I cut the recipe in half to make one layer.  I made the other layer out of Recees Peanut Butter ice cream that I scooped into the other 9" baking pan. (Line pan with wax paper first.  Then I put crumbled Oreo Cookies on top.  Freeze.  Take ice cream layer out of pan and put on plate with cookie side up.  Put chocolate cake layer on top of ice cream layer.  Spread with store bought vanilla frosting. Freeze until ready to eat. Delicious!  Kid's loved it.

Fluffy! Will make again. I used a mixture of cake flour and all purpose. Next time I will use ALL cake flour. I also used a total of 1c of cocoa, splenda baking mixture for sugar. Great basic chocolate cake recipe- super fast and easy.  Also, definitely use the creamy chocolate frosting recipe on this website- it's super easy and goes perfect with this cake.

SO moist. Delicious. Added a bit of instant coffee to the boiling water. Cake held together well when I sculpted it into a 3D race car. ATTENTION: Do not half this recipe. The cake will not turn out.

I made this recipe following it exactly, except I substituted corn flour (masa) for the white flour, to make it gluten free!  and I baked the whole thing in a 9x13 pan.  It turned out great, I actually think the corn flour added more flavor!  I did not even frost it, but I did sprinkle some white chocolate chips on top.  I will definatly be making this recipe again

This cake is delicious and moist. I did not account for altitude when I made this cake so it was a little sunken, and Iâm sure that accounted for some of the added density, which was nobodyâs fault but my own. As suggested by someone elseâs review I used 1 cup of cocoa powder and it made it just that much richer.

YUMMY.  Very much like the cake my Grandmother made.  I did a couple of changes.  1 cup of cold coffee for the 1 cup of water and 1/2 of my canned applesauce made with love and no sugar instead of the oil.  And I changed the baking time to 35 minutes since I live in a higher altitude.  It brought back wonderful memories.

I've made this cake more than 20 times now. I vary the flavour by adding either 2 tbsp of orange rind, or 2 tsp of ginger and a 1/4 cup of chopped candied ginger. It's a very thin batter, so it sinks to the bottom of the cake while baking, but adds a kind of interesting and flavourful bottom to it. 

I know a few people have commented that the cake either didn't rise or fell in the middle.  Definitely check that your baking soda and baking powder are still active. As to falling in the middle, I've noticed this cake  really needs a consistent oven temperature, so opening the door too often can definitely make it fall. Also, I have had to consistently add another 10 minutes to the bake time, because my oven is a little slow. 

While it's probably not my favourite chocolate cake recipe, it's the quickest and easiest I've encountered, and I like the crumb and the moistness. 

I ice it with a sugar glaze - 1 cup of powdered sugar, 1 tbsp of lemon juice, and some chopped nuts or candied ginger.

I have made this recipe many times for years now, and it has always worked out perfectly. Keep in mind, though that this recipe makes a like a fluffy cake, not a heavy and rich one, so if you prefer that, then this recipe might not be for you. I really recommend that if you have one, use a hand mixer or a stand mixer it makes this cake so much easier to make, and so much faster. Lastly, I want to remind you to be careful when adding the boiling water in because it is hot, and if you are using a mixer, make sure you put it on the speed "stir," or " 2. "

No changes to cake recipe! I wanted to make a special cake for our 45th wedding anniversary, this did it! I am not a chocolate lover but I loved this cake! I frosted it with chocolate butter cream frosting which I added strong coffee to. On top of the choclate frosting filling I added a layer of raspberry preserves. The family raved about how delicious this cake is! I will definitely bake it again.

One cake pan turned out a bit overcooked at the surface, but the smell was AMAZING and it tasted delicious! Might make it again. One thing though... It wouldn't really come out of the pan and when I tried to cut it off it broke into two pieces! How disappointing, considering it was meant to be my dad's birthday cake :( TIP: Fill the pan with the batter about a little less than half, and it will rise to a good size.

This cake recipe was great! I did not make 2 cake rounds, just dumped all the batter into one and baked for about 45 minutes. Donât be afraid to add the full cup of water; it makes the batter look soupy at first but itâll be light and fluffy when it comes out. If the middle is not completely baked, reduce the temperature to about 300 and bake until a toothpick comes out clean (reducing the temp wonât allow the outside of the cake to burn). Cool COMLETELY before frosting, and cover the cake with a large inverted bowl or some plastic wrap (if you havenât frosted yet) so that it stays moist! Njoy!!

Only recently started baking. First attempt at chocolate cake. Used this recipe to make about 10 cup cakes.  I used less than 1/2 of the sugar and sprinkled 3-4 semi sweet chocolate chips on top while cooling for icing. Turned out perfect. My wife who bakes fairly often loved them. Really good recipe. Bake time was about 38 minutes.

I made this exactly as the directions said to make it.  The cake is so moist and good.  It was very easy to make and we loved it.   I made the 2 layers but being that there are only 2 of us I froze one of the layers and frosted the one we ate with vanilla butter frosting.  It was like eating a Suzi Q!  Delicious!  Thanks for the good recipe.

I made the cake as directed and it came out absolutely perfect.  It was so moist and as I said to my husband it is the most perfect looking cake I have ever made.  I had no trouble getting it out of a layer pan that was well greased and floured and also had those sliders that allows for loosening up the bottom. I frosted it with Creamy Chocolate frosting, a recipe from Allrecipes as well and it was a hit with my big family and I will be making it again.

This has been my "go-to" recipe now for many years!  It never disappoints.  I originally found it while looking for a dairy free cake recipe (I use either cashew milk, almond milk or even coconut milk!) and I'm so glad I did.  I use it constantly!  Make it Gluten Free by using "Pamela's all purpose flour" and it comes out just as perfectly or make it with flax eggs... I've done it all! This is "food preference"/ "allergy" friendly.  Thank you!

This is an interesting recipe. I followed it , let the cake cool, frosted it and then tried a piece the same day. I thought the cocoa taste was overwhelming. I placed the cake in the refrigerator and tried another piece about 24 hours later and thought it was delicious. The cake keeps pretty well in the refrigerator. I will definitely make this again.

This cake is so moist and delicious.  The only change I made was to change vegetable oil to Corn oil.  I just prefer the taste of the corn oil.  The cate was eaten in one setting.

This is a wonderful moist cake! I upped the cocoa to 1 cup, and used coffee instead of water. It doesn't even need frosting.

This is my all time FAVORITE cake ever!  It is very moist and rich. I make these and sell them to people for parties and events, and they love them! If you want to make them cupcakes, fill the cups only halfway, as they will overflow. Bake them for 12-18 minutes and ice them after they cool down! I hope you love this recipe as much as I do!

I've made this cake numerous times after I first found it on the back of a Hershey cocoa can. It always comes out moist and yummy! It's now my go to recipe for chocolate cake and I usually frost it with either a chocolate or orange  cream cheese frosting!

Have made this many times. This is the exact recipe on the back of the Hershey's Cocoa package called Hershey's "Perfectly Chocolate" Chocolate Cake. Top with "Perfectly Chocolate" Chocolate Frosting, also on package.

I made mine gluten free by substituting GF flour and it was amazing!  A week later it's still super moist and that's unheard of with gluten free.

FYI, If you are going to post someone else's recipe at least have the courtesy to mention the source. This is not your recipe, but a copyright violation of Hershey's "Perfectly Chocolate" Chocolate Cake. You reported their original recipe as yours.

This cake was terrible!  It didn't bake much at all, and ruined my pans.  I don't normally comment or rate, but I had to warn people-do not attempt this one!

Over Flowed over the pans. and it took a lot longer to cook.

I watched the video and followed the instructions exactly... triple checked.

It tasted good but it is to wet to frost.

And YES... I did the tooth pick and it came out completely dry

OMG....BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE!!!!  I have been baking and cooking since I was 4 and of all the things I have made I have never made a cake from scratch.  Well, i will never buy another box of cake mix again.  My daughter and I had the best time making this cake and eating it for breakfast....and she is picky when it comes to cakes.  The only change I made was I put half coffee and half hot water.   Next week I am making this cake for my own birthday party...lolol  Thank you!!!!!

Loved this cake! Made one mistake, that I have never done before this, I  read the reviews, and listened! so many said  use 1C coco powder, it doesn't need it! Make this cake the way it is, and its outstanding! even better day 2.  
topped it with chocolate buttercream frosting, in a 9x13 pan.
This is a Hershey recipe from the 70's.
If someone is going to make a zillion changes, please just post it as a new recipe.

This cake recipe was perfect! Easy to make, bake and frost, and tasted so delicious and moist when done! Frosted the middle layer with fluffy-peanutbutter frosting and finished frosting the rest with both the peanut butter and a chocolate frosting. Was decadent! This will definitely be my go-to chocolate cake recipe.

very moist and chocolaty cake.  tricky getting the top layer out of the pan onto the bottom layer because it is so moist.  I would make it in a 9 x13 next time. it would be wonderful with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of choc sauce. hmmm....

I made this recipe for my daughter's birthday party and it was a hit. I made both cake and cupcakes from the recipe and though it will end up runny when you mix all the ingredients together, it will work. I am a rookie baker, so I made the fatal flaw of greasing and flour the pan, and the cake almost got ruined. I managed to save the cake in the end, so I highly recommend not to flour the pan.

This was my first attempt in a long time to bake my son a birthday cake. I typically would go and buy the store mix but this time I wanted it to be special. 

The cake was very runny but, as the other reviewers testified, there was nothing to fear. I used a glass 9x13 pan lines with parchment paper; no cooking spray or butter/margarine used at all. I baked it on the convection bake setting at 325F and I cooked it for 45 minutes. As suggested on the site, I used a full cup of Fry's Cocoa.  It turned out great. I made it the night before and it was still so light but moist the next day. I'd like to try the hot coffee next time as a substitute for the boiling water. 

As suggested by another reviewer, I used the buttercream frosting in the Red Velvet Cake I recipe on this site. I found that I needed to thicken it up further with 4-5 tablespoons of powdered sugar. Perfect pairing! The guests loved it!!

I followed the instruction exactly, and it came out delicious. I bake a lot, but this was my first time making a layered cake. I was intimidated because I thought it would fall apart. It didn't. It was absolutely perfect. 

The cake was very moist and fudgy, and came out of the pan perfectly after 10 min. I let cool down on cooling racks. I slices fresh strawberries and made a whip cream filling for the center. I frosted the entire cake with a homemade whip cream frosting. I topped it off with fresh strawberries, and I drizzled chocolate all over the top. TOO DIE FOR! 

I will definatley make this again!

This is a Hershey's recipe and it's fabulous and easy. I make it in a 9 x 13 pan and frost it with chocolate buttercream icing. Always a huge hit . I no longer buy boxed mixes since this one is so easy. Not a huge chocolate cake fan myself but the family and friends love it.

Only  change I made was I substituted 1 cup (boiling) coffee for the 1 cup boiling water. This was amazing. I do not think I will ever make a boxed chocolate cake again. Moist and delicious. I used Hershey's cocoa.

I used light coconut milk (can) since we're lactose intolerant.  I also used brown sugar instead of white.  The cake was really moist.  I topped it with chocolate panache.  I'll be making the again.  It is now one of my go to recipes.

This is seriously the most delicious chocolate cake I've ever had. I used the highest quality cocoa I could find and a raw sugar, followed everything else exactly. Moist, fudgy and utterly delicious. Since it is so rich, I skipped a butter cream option and frosted it instead with a sour cream, whipped topping recipe from another website. It complimented the cake beautifully without adding anything overpowering. I'm not a big cake person, but was looking for something for my daughter's birthday. I think I just found my favorite cake recipe.

I have tried 1000s of recipes it seemed like, and this is the only one that I LOVE. I made it exactly like the recipe says, and I have also made it using 1 cup cocoa and 1 cup freshly brewed coffe and an extra 1/4 cup flour. Both are amazing.

I'm giving this only 3 stars because it lacks flavor.  Even with 1C cocoa and some chocolate chips sprinkled on top this lacked chocolate flavor.  It was very easy and quick (no butter needed softening, no chocolate needed melting) and it was moist, so it could be a useful recipe when you are in a hurry.  If you have the right icing or some ice cream to go with it, it is ok.

It was an okay recipe, but it definitely could be improved upon. The cake was super moist. Although edible, fell apart. The chocolate also tasted a bit washed out.

Exceptionally moist, rich cake! Like others suggested, I upped the cocoa to 1 cup, baked it as a snack cake in a 9 x 13 inch pan lined with parchment paper for 35 minutes, and it was so easy to cut and serve. I've been "snacking" on it since it cooled enough to do that! Hubby loved it and I'm pretty sure our grandson will give it his seal of approval. 
One bowl, no creaming butter, it was as easy as dumping everything in, then adding the cup of water I boiled in a Pyrex container in the microwave!
I won't be looking for another chocolate cake recipe!
Oh....and for anyone who needs the kind of cake-pop recipe that involves mixing baked cake with frosting, this is it!
Thank you!

Perfect.. but make sure you have a very good non-stick surface, I just used what I had. Also, as mentioned in other reviews... I used 1 cup of cocoa, and almost 1 tsp of baking soda (original recipe uses too much). I also added the boiling water 1/4 at a time and ended up using only 3/4 which was more than enough... I think others might have used all of the water... which might be why they ended up with a far too moist result. I ended up with a total of eight 4" cakes (but then again... I filled the pans too much lol)

This is a great Super Bowl cake. I made this cake last minute, not knowing a bunch of people were coming. It was just perfect. Nice and moist and fluffy. This receipt was easy to make, and I am 11 years old. I suggest this cake! :)

Super easy and absolutely delicious. Everyone always loves this. This is the exact same recipe on the Hershey's coco box, I believe. I did increase the coco powder to one full cup though. This recipe halves easily. Would recommend using spring-form pans for presentation purposes as this cake is very soft and crumbles/breaks easily when transferring. Oddly, it gets better after sitting in the fridge for a while! I suggest letting it cool in the fridge a full night before serving.

Delicious and moist. It is crumbly though, so it didn't stick together well as a layer cake. We ate it with a spoon instead of a fork. ;-) One thing to note: Make sure you put the boiling water in last. I goofed up and forgot to put in the flour, so I added it after the boiling water. I ended up with flour lumps that I suspect the boiling water would have dissolved. Highly recommend this recipe!

I tried this cake as an "I'm-Bored-With-Box-Cakes" attempt.  It came out so wonderfully delicious!  Even my mom, who is not at all a chocolate cake eater, LOVED IT!  She still swears, to this day, I bought this out somewhere.  I did up the Cocoa powder to 1 cup, and even got a little creative with the icing and added candy bars to the actual cake mix after it had cooked for about 5 mins.  It's still fabulous!!!

Made this as a double layer cake with fudge frosting, almond slices to sides and top then added drained Maraschino cherries around the top to border. Husband LOVED it!!! Even three days later in a cake box out of the fridge tasted perfect and moist. Will be doing this again over the weekend!

I was delightfully surprised for the gorgeous cake I got in the very first go! Though the centre sank in slightly,it looked perfectly fine after icing. The cake is amazingly moist and dense and reeeeally rich.My husband absolutely loved it.The only thing I didnt like it was a slight after taste of baking soda so m gonna reduce the quantity slightly n try again.Also,the runny consistency will scare u,but dont be... and also it rises quite a bit,so fill your pans much lesser than half.

I'm stuck indoors during a typhoon and I'm craving chocolate cake. Found this recipe and gave it a try. I'm glad there was an option for splitting the recipe in half and exact measurements cause I only had a cup of sugar left. I substituted the boiling water with some fresh hot coffee and the cake was DELISH!! Totally saving this recipe for future cravings.

Really good and easy to follow cake recipe. I doubled the cocoa powder to make the chocolate flavor more intense. The cake Ended up being very moist and fluffy with good flavor.

This is the best recipe I've come across. I substituted Hershey's Special Dark cocoa and used espresso instead of water. I baked it in a bundt pan and finished it with a light dusting of confectioner's sugar. I think the cake is moist enough to not need any icing.  This is my new go to chocolate cake.

To die for. I made the mistake of starting this mix in cake pans with a removable bottom. It leaked out a bit when it started baking. However, once baked and topped with chocolate frosting ... best chocolate cake ever though it only lasted a day and a half.

This cake is delicious!  I did as suggested by other reviewers and upped the cocoa powder to 1 cup.  I also used an espresso and then boiling water for the rest of the one cup boiling water in the instructions.  I used gharadelli cocoa powder.  I was a little thrown by how runny the batter was but wasn't nervous about it because all the other reviews said that was how it was supposed to be.  I baked it in a bundt pan for 45 minutes and when it was cooled I sprinkled confectionary sugar on top.  So good it didn't even need frosting!  It was the perfect end to dinner with a nice espresso.  Definitely staying in my recipe rotation for when I am having a chocolate craving!  Thank you!!

Such a great recipe! I made one heart shaped cake with peanut butter frosting and used the remaining batter for a small bundt cake. I added frozen raspberries to the small bundt cake after 20 minutes of baking and it turned out so tasty!!! I covered that with a chocolate ganache. I also used substitute sugar and only used water (no milk). Perfect, moist, and so rich! Thank you!

My family really liked this recipe. They were all surprised when I told them that it wasn't a cake box recipe. It was very easy to do and it took little time to make

Whenever I try a recipe from this site the first time, I customarily follow it to the letter. But for this cake, I decided to add a tablespoon of instant coffee just because I always  do with chocolate cakes to enhance the flavor. And lucky thing, too because I forgot to add the vanilla. This is the best, moist, flavorful chocolate cake I ever tasted and the kids, who are my harshest critics, agree as well. For frosting, I decided to make try the fluffy, white frosting from this site as well, for nostalgia, as it was the frosting that my Mom also used when I was a kid myself. It was a perfect combination with the cake. It tasted like marshmallow with just the right sweetness. I'm happy that I finally found the perfect recipe for my chocolate cake. Thanks for sharing!!

Best chocolate cake recipe I have ever tried. Simple. Moist. Rich. And the quick easy clean up is a plus. This is my go to recipe for birthdays or other special events that I am bringing a dessert to.

Making this cake for the second time now. It's fantastic, very tasty and moist. I baked in a 9x13 pan as I wasn't wanting a layer cake but a larger cake to cut into squares. The first one was a little tricky to get out the tin but I didn't leave it to cool for 10 minutes before trying it! My fault. This cake keeps really well. I had it well wrapped on the counter for 2 days and then there was a couple of pieces still left so I froze them and got them out when needed. It still tasted just as good!

I have been using this recipe for decades! since my grandma and always turns Perfectly very moist, delicious and lot of chocolate flavor.  Secret: A good cocoa powder such as Hershey's gives an extraordinay flavor against other cocoa powders.As I live in front of the beach,  Humidity is an extra so I cut off a little water as les than 1/4 of cup and turns the same.

I had a hankerin' for chocolate cake made easy & simple so I tried this recipe. Super easy & super delish!!! Wow!!! It's fluffy, moist & didn't take more than 10 minutes to stir everything up (I was too lazy to use my hand held mixer) & baked the batter in a deep casserole glass dish. It took approximately 50 minutes at 350 degrees to bake & made a chocolate cream cheese frosting. It's the most perfect chocolate cake recipe & I highly recommend it..

Moist and delicious! Bumped cocoa powder up to 1 full cup per some previous reviews and baked in 9 X 13 pan, other than that made exactly as recipe states.  Frosted with a chocolate buttercream and it made the perfect 80th birthday cake for my mother.

It was incredibly rich! Be careful not to pair it with a strong icing/frosting--it will drown the taste of this AWESOME cake! Everyone loved it, even my crazy picky friends.

This chocolate cake is so easy and great for cakes or cupcakes. I suggest baking cupcakes for around 18-20 minutes, same temperature. Also to use an ice cream scoop for the perfect amount of cake in the baking cup. This is wonderful and I usually top it with powdered sugar or a simple vanilla glaze from this site (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/vanilla-glaze/detail.aspx) which is a glorious touch.

Oh mercy this cake was perfect.  I haven't baked a cake from scratch for awhile and it was a breeze - was a little nervous about the boiling water but was very happy and surprised that it came out so moist and better than any cake I think I've ever had or made.  Yum.

Thank you for the great cake recipe!  I made this yesterday--my first ever cake not made from a box mix!  It could not have been easier.  It was definitely helpful to read the negative reviews before making this, to be forewarned about just how thin the batter is.  I might have thought I'd messed up, otherwise, because it was quite thin.  Baked evenly and was ready in exactly 32 minutes.  Since it seems like some people have issues getting it cooked perfectly, it must vary from oven to oven in terms of when it's ready.

I agree with what someone else said, at first didn't taste quite right but after sitting in the fridge for a few hours it's awesome, even my picky husband loves it! I will use 1 cup cocoa next time though. I'm glad for the note that the batter is runny, I would have thought I screwed up. It looked like hot chocolate not cake batter. I used two Christmas tree shaped pie pans. They were not big enough, lol. I think I over filled them because they spilled over. Also someone pointed out how difficult the cakes are to get out of the pans. I assumed it was because I used the tree pans, but yes it was very tough. So moist and dense that were you set the cake leaves a layer of cake. I had it all over my hands.

I made this substituting whole plain yogurt for the milk and 1/4 cup applesauce and a 1/4 cup oil for the 1/2 cup oil and it turned out delicious!!! I'm sure it is wonderful the original way too. This is definitely my go to recipe now! Wishing I would have found this recipe years ago!!! - Was also glad that I read the water makes it runny. I thought the batter looked the right consistency before the water and then after I added it I was a bit worried, but as stated by numerous reviewers before me, it turned out perfect!

This was the easiest and best cake I ever made! I did made a couple changes. I used Coconut oil for the vegetable oil and used some black cocoa powder in with the regular cocoa. My oven is extra hot so it was done in 25 mins. Frosted it with a vanilla buttercream icing... And it was epic :)

Yummy in the tummy! Made these for my cousin's work party and they were gone in seconds!!  I used coffee instead of water (always love the coffe/chocolate combo) and buttermilk instead of milk (had some leftover and wanted to use it up).  I filled them with a little chocolate pudding and topped them with a cream cheese frosting! DELISHHHH!!

I made this cake for my son's birthday I have tried similar recipes so I took a risk and invited my in-laws, My mother in-law is very picky with food, and today she asked me for the recipe for this cake, she even had a second piece! (if you know her your mouth would drop), even my father in-law was surprised that she repeated on cake! we all loved it! if you tried it and didn't turn out good, you are doing something wrong, I always try the first time just as the recipe is asking for.  I followed the directions exactly and viola! deliciousness! for the amount of work is well worth it! My in-laws already asked me to make it again for their friend's birthday. I made a Dark Chocolate ganache to go with it, that made it even better! Not a German chocolate cake but so much easy and still good! what else can I say? I liked it,

This cake is one of the best chocolate cake recipes I have ever used. It is so moist and yummy. I love to cook and try new recipes all the time. I am hooked on this one though. Can't wait for an excuse to make it again.

I agree with review from naples34102, black magic cake is more moist. I use peanut butter icing not chocolate. I also use cold black brewed coffee instead of  water. This cake is better the second day. I did use the bake time for layer cake, my receipe is for a 9 x 13 cake pan.

I made this as a sheet cake, since I read a review that described this as a moist, pudding like cake. But I didn't find that it turned out that way and it actually comes out of the pan pretty clean so I think it would make layers just fine. I do find that I think it tastes better the next day, but it tasted great the day I made it, too. I used Hersheys dark chocolate cocoa and found a simple chocolate frosting recipe on this website so I completely got my chocolate groove on!

Rich, moist, and fluffy :) i altered it a bit because I can't leave anything well enough alone (yes, It's a disease). I substituted buttermilk instead of milk for extra moistness and hot espresso for the water. You can't taste the coffee in the final product, it just gives the chocolate some extra oomph. Very tasty.

Baked this cake for b'day party yesterday. I reduced the sugar level by a quarter of a cup, baking soda and baking powder(by just a little bit) and less salt. Garnished it with fresh strawberries. What a cake it was! I added frosting too.My husband and teen soon can't seem to get enough of it. The guests loved it as well. Would make it again and again and again. So simple and took 15 minutes only. A good gift to take as well!

This cake is amazing! It's my go to recipe now for almost all occasions. This cake is so moist it doesn't even need frosting. A little advice though this cake is way to soft and moist to layer and go really heavy on buttering and flouring your pan

this is my "go to cake" for the past two years!  BUT, I always use 3 round pans because the first time I only used 2 pans  and had an overflow mess!  It makes a wonderful 3 layer cake, always moist and delicious.

AMAZING!!! I was a little scared because the mixture was very watery before placing in the oven, but it turned out super moist and tasty! I used a chocolate fudge icing and it tastes just like a dessert from a restaurant. Terrific!

bland, needs tons of frosting to make it sweet enough. I even added a tbsp of rum extract, but it didn't give it a richer flavor obviously.

I tried to make this recipe many times and everyone gets such awesome reviews. I followed it exactly as the recipe says, but it always turns out flat, rubbery and hard.... I have no idea what I am doing wrong and I know it should turn out. I really want to get this recipe right because everyone is raving about it. This is my first "one bowl" cake and I can never get it to work... can anyone tell me what could happen? Maybe I need to add more baking powder or.. I added too much water???

Fabulous cake, very moist! I did not make it as a two layer cake though, instead I just made one large cake and added about 10 minutes to the cooking time.

I made this recipe to spec with the exception of vanilla extract and I halved the portion to make a smaller cake.  It was my moms birthday and I was hoping to surprise her with it when she got home from having lunch with a friend.  The only thing I surprised her with was the horrific smell of burnt cake in the house, even though what came out of the oven hardly resembled anything close to a cake.  I poured the batter into small, greased and flowered glass dishes, preheated the oven to the appropriate temperature, and took notice of the fact that as the recipe said, the batter is indeed very runny.  I checked on it about every 5 - 10 minutes and after an hour, never came CLOSE to looking like anything other than soup with a thin layer of something that curdled and eventually burnt to a crisp floating on top... I'm like... 80% sure cake isn't supposed to curdle...  I've botched recipes before by accident but not very often, and usually for being inattentive, but this is just insane, and it boggles the mind to look over the recipe trying to figure out where I went wrong and what kind of sorcery was being used by all the cooks who gave this 5 stars and experienced no difficulties.  Any insights would be tremendously appreciated >.

I really like that this cake looked almost black as it came out of the oven, but was really springy and light. I made cupcakes: baked at 350 for 23 minutes, and mini cupcakes at 350 for 17 minutes. Perfect results. I paired this with the Rich Chocolate Frosting and together the cake tasted reminiscent of Wegman's chocolate cake, (which is the best on the planet). Next time, I want to try using buttermilk. Great recipe---thanks!

Loved it...especially the next day. Cake turned out moist & not too sweet. I was glad for the warning that batter would be thin/runny. Baked 2-9" round cakes. My only "fail" was baking too long - I baked for 25 minutes but I think it was probably done at 20-22. I frosted with "Caroline's Chocolate Fudge Frosting" found here and OMG - it was delicious! Used the entire batch to frost cake. Great reviews from all who tried it. Thanks for sharing!

I made this cake for a baby shower and had rave reviews about how yummy it was. I did however up the cocoa to a cup as suggested and it was perfect. The only downer was that the corners were a bit over done using a 1/2 sheet pan and dident rise much, but made it easy for not having to trim any off the top. I will definitely make this again in a smaller pan. Tip on over cooked sides: make a thin sugar water mixture and use a pastry brush to brush on and then let sit a hour before icing. Works great to bring back the moisture! :-)

Delicious! Very good and easy to make.  I did with a bundt cake mold and worked well.  Also, I didn't even use a mixer, just hand stirred with spoon.  Try topping with a chocolate genache for that extra chocolatey experience.

OK... I am pretty darn good at baking, but what went wrong with this recipie?? The cake turned out super moist- not as chocolatey flavored as I would like... But holy cripes did it stick to my pans, and fell completly apart upon removal from the pans!!! I cooked it about 3 or 4 min. less than directed. I greased the rounds with crisco, and I dont know why it fell apart so easily... but I will definitly be trying a different recipie for choc. cake next time! But I do have to give the cake props for it's moist-ness. I pieced it together, let it cool- frosted it, and fed it to all the guys around the shop. Not pretty, but it did the job!It reminded me of a store cake- that you find in the coolers.  TY!

This is so amazing.  Incredibly easy to make, and so moist and delicious to eat!  I went ahead and upped the cocoa to 1 cup, and it was perfect.  I read a few reviews saying this was not good for layer cakes, but I didn't have a problem at all.  I was, however, very careful.  I cut out parchment paper circles for the cake pans, buttered/floured the sides of the pans well, and the layers popped right out.  I also wrapped both layers in foil and froze them overnight for easy frosting the next day .  The cake turned out perfectly, and with a simple vanilla buttercream frosting, it was the best birthday cake I've ever eaten.  Seriously, my extended family gobbled it up.  And did I mention that the batter is incredibly easy to make??  This recipe is a keeper for sure.  Next up: Chocolate cupcakes for my son's third birthday party.  Enjoy, all, and thanks!

BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE EVER!
It gives the right amount of moistness and yum.
Few tips:
If you can not have milk, believe it or not, grape juice is just the thing! I mean it!!!!
Also, using 1 full cup of cocoa improves the taste.

I always use this recipe, it is the best!

This was really good. Not exactly moist but definitely not dry. I used a frosting recipe that was very thin and poured it over the cake. This worked perfectly to make it moist. I'm saving this as my go-to chocolate cake recipe.

This.... is the best chocolate cake EVER. Moist, chocolatey and simple to make. I always receive lots of compliments when I make this cake. Tastes great with a simple chocolate or oreo whipped cream frosting. I line the pans with wax paper, it's simpler than greasing, and the cake always comes out of the pan perfectly. It takes about 45-50 minutes to bake in my oven, but all ovens are different. Also, I only add about 3/4 cup of water. My go-to chocolate cake recipe, I recommend anyone else to try it! :)

Turned out great. Loved how easy it was to put everything in one bowl. I took a tip to up the cocoa to 1 cup and it tastes great. Did mine in 9x13 pan for 35-40 min. and about 10 cupcakes for 15-20 min. It also fills an 10X15 pan nicely. Also made one with cocoa as called for, 1 cup of the flour was whole wheat, and substituted apple sauce for oil. This healthier version was also tasty; a little different but tasty nonetheless.

Absolutely use melted butter instead of oil.

This is such an easy delicious moist chocolate cake. A perfect birthday cake!!!! It worked well in a bundt pan, and looked very celebratory with just the right of vanilla ice cream on the top.
I prefer to use brown sugar and buttermilk in my recipes and this one is definitely a keeper!!!!

I made cupcakes from this recipe and it's super chocolatey. If you don't enjoy chocolate or really rich flavor don't make it. It's amazing. I suggest adding more sugar than it says. I made a homemade caramel buttercream frosting that definitely made it so much better!

This cake was very easy to make. The lack of fuss is a big bonus in my tiny kitchen! But even better was the taste: rich, chocolate-y and incredibly moist (which it stayed!) I've always had terrible luck with cakes, but this came out perfect. So glad I found this recipe. Thank you!

Very moist and rich! It was very easy to make. The only changes I made was reducing the vanilla to 1 1/2tsp and 1/2 tsp of salt. I baked it in a 13x9 in pan for about 37 minutes. I iced it with a mint buttercream icing I made. It was fabulous!

I made cupcakes using this recipe (except I substituted organic unsweetened applesauce for the vegetable oil) and they came out so rich and moist! I highly recommend this recipe and will definitely be using it again.  If you've never tried baking with applesauce in lieu of vegetable oil, I highly recommend it!!

I've been looking for a cake/cupcake that screams yummy and fudgy - and this is it! I look forward to trying all the toppings that will go with it! The only change I made was using Dutch cocoa instead of regular, yummy! Thanks Shirleyo!

Excellent cake.  I made it in a 9x13 pan.  This cake is SO moist, such a perfect texture, not too heavy, and not so light that it seems like a bought cake or a (aaagghhh) box mix, even three days after making it.  It freezes very well.  Will be making this again.

I was incredibly skeptical of this cake. I knew that the batter would be thin, but after adding the cup of boiling water my batter was thinner than expected. I decided to trust the recipe and put it on the oven. My cake needed a little extra time to cook through, thanks to the runny batter. Removing the cake from the pan proved to be a challenge, as the cake was moist to the point where it did not want to stay together. When it came time to frost, I had to be incredibly careful not to pull apart the cake. It was a brilliant mess and the whole time I was cursing this demon cake. HOWEVER, when I finally served it, this cake got rave reviews. Everyone loved it, came back for seconds and thirds and requested the recipe. I even got a baking job offer! So, as much as this cake scared me, I'll definitely be making it again. It was worth it in the end!

I'm not a huge fan of chocolate cake, but I had a craving. This cake is very moist and not overly sweet. I topped it with a chocolate buttercream frosting, which made it sickeningly sweet... just the way I like it!

This cake was fantastic! The first few times I made this cake, it stuck to the bottom of the pan because it was so moist. Put a piece of wax paper on the bottom of the pan and it comes out just fine. Be careful though, the batter gets really runny after adding the water, but it turns out wonderful.

The family raves over this cake. It looks and tastes like an expensive bakery cake. I frost the center with chocolate buttercream frosting and spread a  layer of warm chocolate ganache over that (ganache purchased at Whole Foods), then frost the whole cake with the choc buttercream frosting and pour warm choc ganache over the top until it drips down the sides then refrigerate it.  It ALWAYS turns out - even the first time when I didn't follow the directions correctly -- I am not a seasoned baker whatsoever!!  This cake is requested for family birthday cakes! It is so easy and beautiful and most of all it tastes fabulous.

This is a GREAT chocolate cake recipe.  I use a whole cup of cocoa.  I have used it to make cupcakes, sheet cake, layer cake.  Goes great with Peanut butter frosting and chocolate ganache.

This is my go-to chocolate cake recipe.  It's a classic cake that everyone loves - just the right combination of moist and delicate.  I use a chocolate or vanilla icing (the recipe on the back of the confectioner's sugar bag, lol) and it's always a hit.  And there's only one bowl to clean!  :)

hmmm..this is the best cake i ever had..!!!!! they are so good and moist like the bakery cake but, i feel that are somewhere much better than market cake mixes..1st time i tried, it turned out perfect..the batter actually becomes very thin when u add hot water, but just dont worry and go ahead with the exact measurements given in the recipe, they ill turn out the best..usually my huuby is not a fan of cakes but, this time he loved it soooo much..!!! I followed the same measurements, except the amnt of cocoa powder, i added half cup..next time am gona try with hot coffee just like others have mentioned in the reviews..This is the first time am writing a review, because i wanted to tell that this recipe is awesome..Thanks

YUMMY!  I did use 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder and paired this with the chocolate fudge buttercream frosting.  SO good!

The flavor of this cake is delicious but mine turned out a little of the gooey side.  I'd probably bake a little longer next time.

Whenever I make chocolate cake, it's always this recipe because it comes out perfect every single time! People always love it and I get tons of compliments. It's so moist and has the perfect amount of chocolate flavor. It's also very easy and I don't think it's much more time consuming than a boxed cake mix. Do be careful though, I did not realize how much it would rise the first time and had overfilled cupcakes, so it's better to err on the side of caution when filling pans.

This tasted excellent and had a light texture. I didn't change a thing and I topped it with chocolate powder sugar icing. My 7 year old daughter has already requested that I make the same cake for her birthday. So I will be using this recipe again!

OMG!!!  Absolutely the best 'from scratch' chocolate cake recipe I have found in years!! No jell-o pudding mix, no boxed mixes included (drives me nuts when looking for scratch recipes!) - just fantastic texture/taste/chocolate density - everything!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  And it's a 'one bowl' too!  Couldn't ask for more :o)

THIS IS THE BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE I'VE EVER MADE!!! Moist, decadent, truly delicious. I made a quarter slab although only used half the cake as I was making a small cube. The rest of the cake, I didn't even bother icing it, it was so good! I made it exactly as the recipe described, thanks for posting!!

I love this cake recipe. I make one small change, just for my taste. I use boiling coffee instead of the water. Gives a subtle richness. Though, I'd rate it 5 stars based on the original recipe, no changes made. It's perfect either way. It's the only chocolate cake recipe I use.

I made this cake today for my father-in-law's birthday and he gave it great reviews!  I vegetarian so I used almond milk and I also used unbleached flour.  It came out great!  Easy to make, but it stuck to my pan.  It may have been the pan, so I just had two separate cakes.  It goes further that way.  :)

Great recipe! I halved it and made mini-cupcakes for the kids. Even used almond milk instead of cow's milk because I didn't have any. Very good flavor, moist.

SO MOIST AND PERFECTLY CHOCOLATEY! Changes made thanks to other reviewers: Up cocoa to 1 cup, 1/4 cup melted butter and 1/4 cup oil, and added 1 1/2 tsp instant coffee to boiling water before mixing in, baked in a 9x13 pan. Was looking to fill a late-night chocolate craving. This and the Rich Chocolate Frosting (8 servings) were perfect. 
UPDATE: currently making cupcakes for my niece's 2nd birthday (no coffee this time), and for all the cupcake decorators out there, filled to 3/4 you end up with a heftily domed cupcake - more of a muffin shape. Will fill to 1/2 next time.

Absolutely delicious!!! I actually made this cake in a fluted 10" cake pan, baked for 40 min.. When it cooled I inverted cake onto a cake plate and cut into two equal layers. Then I spread my homemade cannoli filling (recipe included) on bottom layer and placed remaining layer on top. Drizzled with chocolate glaze. Refrigerate after making! This was amazingly delicious!!! I will definitely make again! 

Homemade chocolate chip cannoli filling:
15 oz.container of ricotta cheese (drained), 2/3 cup powdered sugar (mix these 2 ingredients on med. till well-blended) add 1/4 tsp. vanilla, 1/4 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. amaretto. In seperate bowl whip 2/3 cup heavy whipping cream until thickened and soft peaks form, then fold into mixture. Fold in 4-5 Tbsp mini-choc. chips. Refrigerate for 1-2hrs.

My family went nuts for this chocolate cake.  Frosted with chocolate ganache which put it over the top.  I made the cake on a Thursday night for a Saturday party.  I was super moist even after a day and a half. I think you need to be a true chocolate lover, though.  I am not that big of a fan so this was just too rich for me, but everyone else loved it!

I made this in a 9 by 12 sheet pan. I used 1 cup of cake flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour, and added a tsp of espresso powder to the boiling water. I frosted with chocolate whipped cream frosting. It was a huge hit!

This was just a so so recipe honestly. I liked that it was pretty chocolatey but it wasn't very sweet or aromatic. The flavor was a bit saltier than I thought it should be. Like I said, I liked it but it was just ok.

Heavenly!  I made this with a cream cheese frosting, and had everyone at my son's birthday party thinking I was an amazing baker - gotta love that :)  This cake was moist and luscious as promised.  I don't normally love chocolate cake, but this one may have won me over.

I give it 5 stars, but only if you let it set for a day. The first night I made it is smelled soooo much like the baking soda, it gave it an almost fishy smell. The next day however, it was AMAZING!

This is a quick and easy recipe...I used the suggestion of 1/4 cup additional cocoa powder and when looking for something a little richer even added 1 cup of freshly brewed coffee in lieu of the water...  YUMMY!

Amazing chocolate flavor, moist and rich.  I ended up baking the whole batch in a single, glass 9 x 13 inch baking pan in a convection oven.  It turned out fine although the center sunk a bit.  I frosted the cake w/ an Allreceipes butter based frosting using Hersey's Special Dark Cocoa, which was wonderful but definitely rich so I don't recommend eating without a nearby glass of old milk.

I followed the recipe except I used a half cup of sugar less than the recipe called for because I didn't have unsweetened cocoa. I also baked it in a 9 by 13 glass pan for 32 minutes. It was delicious and my family loved it!

I've made this cake twice and it's been a hit. The first one was exactly as written and it was great. The second time, I took another reviewers suggestion and increased the cocoa to 1 cup. I also added one cup of chocolate chips. I made it in a bundt pan. It took 40 minutes to bake. Thanks for the recipe! It's a keeper.

I made this cake yesterday, and it was great. Dense and very moist. I changed it a little. I didn't have milk so I used half and half. I only had olive oil, so I used 1/2 cup of mayo instead. I swapped out the boiling water for freshly made hot coffee. Also I listened to other reviews and used 1 cup of cocoa. I made a buttercream frosting. Everyone loved it. I will make it again, and I will use all the changes I made.

I think I've modified this recipe about as much as I can without doing anything illegal.  This is what I've added:  1/4 tsp finely ground black pepper (really jazzes up the chocolate flavor!), a little cinnamon and cloves, 1/2 apple, finely chopped; handful of raisins, cocoanut, chopped walnuts.  I also replaced the white sugar with brown sugar, and replaced some of the oil with 1 Tbsp of butter, and added extra cocoa.  I let it bake a little longer because of the added fruit.  Wonderful stuff.

I will NEVER buy another cake mix again!  This was the most moist and delicious chocolate cake I have ever tasted and it was soooo easy!  I even used freshly milled sprouted flour, raw sugar and raw cacao powder and NO ONE noticed!!  It was devoured!  I used a cream cheese frosting recipe and it went perfectly!  The kids even tried to scrape the crumbs from the bottom of the 9x13.  I'm glad there was a warning about the batter being very thin.  If there hadn't been, I would have thought I had done something very wrong.  It was extremely thin, but baked beautifully!  Thanks for a great recipe!

As a veteran cake baker, it's hard for me to fathom how anything so simple made with all-purpose (not cake) flour could come out so tender, moist, and chocolate-y without the benefit of the science of the cake mix. I will make this recipe again and again. It is sooooo good. I made it exactly as written, though I might try that added 1/4 c of cocoa sometime. Highly recommend this recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly (except I did up the cocoa powder to 1 cup, as per recommendations) and the cake turned out amazing! I took it to work for a colleague's birthday, and it was a huge hit. All my colleagues, who are Russians (I live in Moscow) were pleasantly surprised by my "American" chocolate cake and said it's the first time they've enjoyed cake in a long time. This was the first time I have baked a cake, and I will definitely go back to this recipe. It was easy and delicious!

Nothing added and nothing omitted and nothing substituted for a really good basic chocolate cake recipe.  I look forward to using this to make my cherry chocolate, my orange chocolate, and etc. cakes.  Thank you.

This was a really good cake.  To be perfectly honest though, it wasn't all that much better than a box mix.  I used boiling coffee instead of water, and it didn't have a strong coffee flavor, which was good.

Love this recipe. One of my old bosses was a fan of whiskey so I used half cup of water and a half a cup of whiskey. It was a huge success, more adult like cake. If you want a little extra kick add a small amount of whiskey to the chocolate icing. 
Idea #2: make the chocolate cake, then make a white chocolate pudding and whipped cream topping. I added some mint to the whipped topping for the christmas holiday.

Very tasty! Had made them so many times and made some alternatives as well. Don't give me wrong, the original recipes is great as is. Instead of boiled water, I've added in 4 tsp. postom to the boiling water to enhance the chocolate flavor (I know some of you do it with coffee but I don't drink coffee so). I've also used same amount of mashed bananas in place of oil. Worked perfectly!! Sooooooo gooooood with chocolate frosting. Will definately make these again and again!

if you like a dense, moist chocolate cake, this is the one for you. I use a full cup of cocoa powder and also add 1-2 tsp. instant espresso to the boiling water. I love vanilla but 2 tsp. may be a little too much (but i use mexican vanilla which tends to be pretty strong, so maybe that's the problem) :-)

I made this for my son's birthday cake. FANTASTIC! I used the recipe as written and the cake was extremely moist and rich. I got so many compliments (it was incredibly tasty with white buttercream icing). This is now my go-to chocolate cake recipe!

For cupcakes, 20 minutes is sufficient in the oven. They turn out wonderfully too!

I made this cake for my son's birthday and it got RAVE reviews. It is now definately my go to cake recipe. For frosting I used the Rich Chocolate Frosting recipe. Fantastic!!! I let both sit over night as others suggested. You should know that it comes out rather small (I used a 9x13 inch pan) so if you have a lot of people coming, you should make two of these and then use frosting to frost them together.

Good, quick, simple rock solid basic recipe.  I had no problem with sinking - nice, dense, and moist.  I did use coffee extract and a coffee/water mixture for added flavor.  Ran out of powdered sugar and had to resort to canned stuff which was WAY too sweet (tip:  do NOT use jarred cream cheese frosting - yeck).  Next time will probably use a simple glaze.

Delicoius! I made 24 cupcakes from this recipe and they tasted like devil's food from cake mix! The only change I made was using a full cup of cocoa powder. For cupcakes, bake at 400 degrees for 5 minutes, then turn the oven down to 350 degrees. This will help make domed tops (this recipe makes the batter spreads out instead of rise because the batter is so thin)

You know, I'm torn about reviewing this only because it got so many great reviews. I'll just give you mine and let you do with it what you will. I'm a pretty experienced baker and cook, and yet, my cake fell. I've never had a cake fall on me, ever. I didn't open the door, nothing mysteriously fell off the table on to the floor, Nothing - and these cakes fell. Ok, so moving forward... These cakes were almost like brownies. Nothing cake-like about them, really. The flavor was good, if you're looking for a cake brownie type flavor (which I was not) and the consistency is definitely not spongey like cake but thick and crumbly like brownie. To be honest, I wasn't all that impressed with this. I didn't make it because it was easy, I made it based on the reviews... and either I made a different cake than everyone else, or they just haven't had really great chocolate cake...lol. I gave three stars, reluctantly.

Great cake. If you are looking for a simple chocolate cake that is moist and YUMM, then this is good. It is kind of generic, but whatever, it is YUMM. I didn't have frosting, but the thick paste that you mix together here before you pour in the boiling water was a lot like frosting (I NOM-NOMed many globs of it), so I put some aside before adding the water. Mixed it with some 100% pure peanut butter and used that as frosting for the cake. So good.

This, indeed, is a fantastic cake.  It is really THE perfect cake, since it is easy, one-bowl and delicious. However, as another recent reviewer said, it is the Hershey's cocoa recipe that is on the can, and has been used for generations!  My mother, who would be 102 yrs old by now, made this when I was a child! Try it with white icing for a delicious change; that's the way she always made it.

I used a little bit more cocoa as other reviews suggested. I baked it in an small electric oven, but I opened the door when the cake was rising and the final result was more like a brownie, still good but not that fluffy.

This is just the easiest recipe and it is so moist and good.  Second time I have made it and I don't feel the need to ever try another chocolate cake recipe.  I did do a full cup of cocoa powder the second time and just as good.  Now just to find a great chocolate frosting to top it.

Oh my chocolatey goodness!  Moist, fluffy, rich, and chocolatey.  Just about peftect, you just need to pair with a great frosting (but not canned, this is too good!).  I had a bit of a hard time getting it out of the pans without it breaking, so next time I'll definitely use parchment.

This was the first cake I've ever made from scratch, and it turned out PERFECT!! I went exactly by the recipe and didn't change a thing. It was absolutely amazing! Soooo very moist! I made this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day, and used 2 heart shaped pans. He couldn't get enough of it!

This cake is amazing!!  The only changes I made to this recipe were: increasing the cocoa to 1 cup and refrigerating the cake overnight.  I have also used buttermilk in the place of the milk and I have replaced up to half of the oil with applesauce.  This cake is amazing with a chocolate cream cheese icing.  Enjoy!!

this has become my standard chocolate cake recipe.  my whole family loves it, as well as all the guests who've shared it.
i've done it iced, glazed, or just topped in powdered sugar.

i do agree, it tastes better with coffee in lieu of water, and the better the cocoa, the better the flavor!
love, love, love this cake!

Excellent cake. I thought I would try a trick I saw on TV and use cocoa in the greased pan instead of flour but it stuck a little. Next time I'll use flour. This will be my go-to chocolate cake recipe.

Delish! Always requested by co-workers. Like others, I used 1 cup of cocoa and added 1 teaspoon instant coffee powder to the batter. Baked in a 9 x 13 for 40 minutes. 

I iced with the recipe below. Can't find the original source, it could have been from another reviewer. The icing also gets rave reviews when I served with the One Bowl Chocolate Cake III.
ICING:
1/2 cup butter or margarine 
1/4 cup milk 
3 tablespoons baking cocoa 
3 3/4 cups confectioners' sugar 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
Melt margarine, mix all others and pour over warm (not hot) cake.

Made this for my 11 yr olds birthday. It was perfect. Made as is, no tweaks. I was skeptical about the thin batter, but perfect for a good solid chocolate cake recipe. We don't like our cakes super sweet, but this was moist, and excellent! Thank you for sharing.

This is a VERY easy, VERY chocolaty cake.  It's the best recipe I've come across so far for a basic chocolate cake.  It's moist and yummy.  I was really worried because it cooked over the sides of my pans (used the 9" as stated), but I trimmed the layers up and it frosted beautifully.  I made a chocolate buttercream frosting with a white chocolate filling.  Too chocolatly for me, but my daughter requested it for her birthday.

there cannot be a simpler cake to make! and t is super delicious. as many others noted, the thin batter is a bit alarming, but it bakes up incredibly. i did mine in a 9x13 and it was so perfect. i literally had no time to make a cake, and this one was about 7 mins to mix up. 35 mins in the oven. no time to frost, so i cut a stencil of a pine tree, and dusted a generous amount of powdered sugar over the cake. it was a huge hit.  ****** i used a full cup of cocoa, a tad more oil, and of course an extra teaspoon of vanilla!******** I will not buy a cake mix again. i already memorized this recipe, and loooove it!

This was fantastic!  It was so rich that next time I'm going to make chocolate whipped cream and frost with that to let the cake texture and flavor shine through!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is really good cake.... I did alter the recipe though.  1-1/2 sugar.  1 cup of good cocoa powder.  1-1/4 tsp of baking powder.  1-1/4 baking soda. 1/2 tsp of salt.  After reading alot of the views of being salty and other stuff wrong with it---mine came out JUST GREAT----I love it.  I put homemade chocolate frosting on it tooo.... Yes I will make this again.... Thank you all recipes

My family and I loved this cake!  It was the first cake I had ever attempted to make from scratch and it was delicious!  It was very moist and had just the right amount of chocolate.  They asked me to never make another chocolate cake from a box again, from now on use this recipe!

Absolutely the best made-from-scratch chocolate cake I've ever had.  I followed the recipe exactly and the cake came out so flavorful and so moist!  I baked mine in a bundt cake pan for about 50 minutes and it was perfect.

This was just delicious!  I baked it in a bundt pan and dropped in about a half cup of choc chips before baking. They sunk to the bottom and made a nice frosting replacement.  I also dusted the cake with a little cinnamon sugar and powdered sugar.  I used whole wheat pastry flour and my family couldn't even tell.  I can't wait to try this recipe and make an upside down german choc cake.

This is seriously the best chocolate cake recipe! It's super, super easy to make. It's quick. It's moist! At first you might freak out at how runny the batter is, but it comes out perfectly. I used this recipe for my friend's wedding cake and everyone LOVED IT! great job!

Fantastic!! So light and fluffy, and sweet but not overpowering. I topped it off with a rich Coconut Pecan frosting, and it was excellent. Will never reach for another boxed mix again. Thanks so much for this recipe!

i used this for cupcakes and i don't recommend it.  they rose, but were kind of gummy around the edges and stuck to my muffin pan.  the cake is very soft,moist in the middle but dry on the outside.     it was very hard to pour it into the cupcake wells because the batter was so watery.  it would probably be ok for the 2 9" round pans as long you have a really yummy frosting!

oh my goodness.  this is the best chocolate cake i have ever made!!!!  i did modify one thing, i upped the amount of cocoa to one cup as a few reviewers suggested because i simply LOVE chocolate.  I think this still would have tasted great w/out the increase and still would have deserved 5 stars tho. thus my rating of 5 stars.  I do highly reccommend increasing the cocoa, as i did, for any chocoholics out there cause it sent me into chocolate heaven.  hands down best chocolate cake ever

Awesome!! My husband isn't a fan of chocolate cake, but he sure liked digging into this one.  However, I did increase the cocoa amount to 1 cup, but all I had was the No Name Brand, and it was wonderful.

Amazingly delicious and super easy.  I sprinkled chocolate chips on top as another reviewer suggested.  Tastes great the same day, tastes even better the next day after being refrigerated.  Add a scoop of ice cream and you have a perfect dessert.  My family could not get enough.

Extremely moist cake!  Love the simplicity of only using one bowl to make this cake.  Don't be afraid that the batter is really thin.

Best chocolate cake (well, I made cupcakes) I've ever made.  I did substitute a box of chocolate instant pudding for some of the sugar, since some people said they used more cocoa powder.  Not sure if that made any difference or not.  I also realized too late that I was out of vanilla, so I didn't use extract.  I haven't made any frosting yet, I froze them for a bridal shower this weekend.

I was kind of nervous ot make this cake, but I am glad I did. I followed the directions to an exact. The cake turned out perfect. Mosit and not too chocolatey. The cake batter after you add the water is very thin. I thought I had messed up. But it turned out perfect. For something so easy it is great!

Wonderful cake! I am dreadful at making cakes but got rave reviews using this recipe. I topped with vanilla cream cheese icing and decorated with strawberries which was delicious. The texture continues to improve in the fridge over night and even the day after that. Thank you!!!

Beware of altitude.  I am in Colorado and my first attempt fell.  So I used 1/4c less sugar and only 1t of baking powder.  I also added an extra spash of milk.  Then it turned out and it was wonderful.

I cut this recipe in 1/2 to make sure it was GOOD first (& We have a small family).  It is EXCELLENT.  I mean: not okay, not good, not yummy - it's excellent!  Yes it is a thin batter when you add the water, but it is so airy & fluffy and moist, it is a true KEEPER!  Believe the reviews!  :)

This is the cake everyone asks for for their birthday.  Friends, family, their friends, their families!  I can make this cake while helping with homework and making dinner at the same time because its easy doesn't leave me a huge mess to clean up.  I have used chocolate milk, instead of regular.  And I always throw in 2 grated squares of semi-sweet baking chocolate to any chocolate cake I make.  Have to make sure the migraine I'll get from eating this is totally worth it :)

the flavor in this cake was very good, and it was very moist. super moist, almost too moist, like many of the other people on this site have pointed out.   i added a spoon of blueberry jam which was nice too, and at the time i only had chocolate milk on hand. and yes the batter was veeeery thin! is that why the cake kinda... caved in? it didnt poof up. instead it spilled over the edge of the pan and made a huge mess...

This is the recipe you find on the back of Nestle Cocoa powder. It was a bit disappointing to find an unoriginal recipe on here, but I guess it does work to make a pretty good chocolate cake

This is the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted. I put it all in an angel-food pan and baked it for 12-15 min longer, then made peanut-butter icing!

This is a ridiculously moist cake....almost too moist (if there is such a thing).  Very easy to make, and tastes rich and delicious.  I did increase the cocoa to one cup, as others have done.  I also added some mint extract to the mix and frosted with a vanilla icing that I added several drops of green food coloring to (turned out a nice, minty pastel green color).  Took this to a dinner party and it was a huge hit.  This recipe is very versatile; I'm sure I'll use it again.  Might bake a tad bit longer next time, though.

I was looking for a good chocolate cake mix to make cupcakes and this nailed it.  Not too dense, not too light, not too sweet or chocolaty.  Just right!  I topped this with a wonderful and equally easy vanilla buttercream frosting (3 cups powdered sugar, 1 cup butter - mix for 3 minutes, add 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1 tablespoon whipping cream - mix an additional minute). I will definitely be making this again.

Delicious. I upped the chocolate, like many reviews said to do, and add 1 tsp. peppermint extract for one of the tsp. of vanilla. Perfect mint chocolate cake. I also made these into cupcakes. Bake for 18 min.

This is THE BEST from scratch cake I have ever tasted.  I have tried a TON from this site and love them all for the most part but this one takes the cake!  Pun intended.  I made exactly as written and it was SO simple.  I was SHOCKED at how moist and chocolatey this cake turned out.  I WILL keep this one as my chocolate cake recipe from now on.  Box mixes won't be around much longer with this easy recipe!!  LOVE IT THANK YOU!

I have not yet tried this recipe, however, when I do, I will most likely...substitute buttermilk or lite sour cream for the milk (or 1/2 and 1/2 of both); add some Bailey's, and either semi-sweet or mint chocolate chips...wanted to write to answer some of the requests. It does appear to need other flavors.

I have no idea how anyone can gripe about this cake. It is without a doubt the best chocolate cake I've ever made. I did the recommended substitutions (applesauce for oil, 1 cup cocoa, less sugar) and I made a sourcream frosting to go on top and it was divine. People at the party I brought it to raved and raved about it. I can't wait for another occasion to make it again.

Really good, simple and fast! An easy recipe to alter, as well. Good consistency with basic pliable ingredients. Can easily be made into a "gourmet" cake with a few tweaks.  I opted for replacing half the milk with yogurt, it adds moisture. Used 1 1/2 cps flour instead and only 1/4 cp hot water. I also added 2 tbs. of port. Lastly, used melted margarine instead of oil. I only had a bundt pan and it worked fine!  The result had the rich tang of dark chocolate and it was VERY moist! A new family favorite!  I will make again at the drop of a hat!

Super moist. Super chocolaty. Super yummy. Super WOW! I made these as cupcakes for my son's birthday and they were a hit.  I cut the time in half at 17 minutes. Wonderful wonderful wonderful. I filled them w/bavarian cream and topped them off with buttercream frosting. A must keep recipe.

This cake was delicious! I made it for my nephews 5th birthday party and it was a huge hit. Everyone thought it tasted great. The cake came out very moist and had great flavor. I took the advice of other reviewers and upped the cocoa to 1 cup and let it settle in the fridge for a day. I will definitely make this again.

This cake was great!  The only thing I did differently was add & dissolve 1 tsp instant coffee crystals to vanilla before putting in bowl.  Don't think it made any difference (but have heard adding coffee crystals can bring out more of a chocolate flavor--per food network).  Otherwise I made this recipe as stated, with two 9" pans.  Baked 30 min, was enough for my oven.  I added Duncan Heinz chocolate buttercream frosting to it--it was moist, tasty, and chocolaty--what more could a chocoholic ask for!  Will recommend this recipe.  Looks like Hershey had a great recipe.  Thanks for sharing!   Oh, I was going to add chocolate curls to top of cake but realized I was out.  I added crushed chocolate graham crackers, which sounds odd but worked for presentation purposes.

I cut this recipe in half, and made 12 cupcakes.  The only modifications I made were using half whole wheat flour, olive oil, and skim milk.  These cupcakes were AMAZING!  Moist, light, and you couldn't taste the whole wheat at all, so it was a nice way to make them a bit healthier.

This is a very delicious cake.  My family has been enjoying the very same recipe for more than 30 years.  It's the one printed on the back of the Hershey's Cocoa can.  "Perfectly Chocolate Chocolate Cake."  The frosting recipe, also printed on the can, is equally amazing.

Awesome chocolate cake! The only changes I made was I used boiling coffee instead of water and I used a 9X13 pan. Instead of greasing and flouring the pan, I greased and sugered the pan. Gives it a nice sweet outside.

Delicious! I didn't change a thing and though I was initially concerned about the thinness of the batter, it baked beautifully. My visiting friend ate four of these (I made them into cupcakes) in under two minutes. I will definitely be making this again.

UPDATE 2: MY FRIEND LOVED THIS!!! UPDATE: AS B POWELL SUGGESTED (GREAT IDEA!), I MADE UP A BATCH OF DRY CAKE INGREDIENTS - BUT NOT FOR MYSELF! I SENT IT (WRAPPED WITH RAFFIA IN A HOLIDAY GOODIE BAG) W/ DIRECTIONS (PRINTED ON HOLIDAY LETTERHEAD) AND A BASIC VANILLA FROSTING RECIPE, A BOTTLE OF MADAGASCAR VANILLA (FROM MY LOCAL SPICE SHOP) AND A JAR OF PEPPERMINT SNOW (FROM WILLIAMS-SONOMA). MY FRIEND LOVED IT!!! :-) Yummy cake! It's my fiance's Bday today. His favorite cake is chocolate with vanilla frosting, so I decided to give this recipe a try, frosting with Vanilla - Chocolate Powdered Sugar Frosting (also on this site). I've never made a cake from scratch before (not that I can't, I just don't have the time to... lol!) - this recipe proved to be INSANELY easy, quick and economical (most well-stocked pantries will have all of the ingredients on hand). It's SUPER moist, layers well (I made a two-layer cake) and has just the right amount of chocolatiness (IMHO). Although nothing can beat the convenience of a boxed mix, this is a great substitute. B. Powell's suggestion to whip up a second batch of ingredients in a Zip-lock bag for later is genius (thanks!). Next time, I think I will use a full cup of cocoa and possibly substitute 1 c. coffe for the water. I would have never guessed that this was a Hershey's recipe (and I even used Hershey's cocoa!). Great recipe, shirleyo! :-)

Excellent, excellent, excellent.  Didn't change any ingredients.  So moist and flavourful!  I doubled this receipe and made a large triple-layer chocolate cake for an equally large birthday gathering.  It went over extremely well.

Really moist, and not too sweet... but if u r looking for CHOCOLATELY, this is not ur cake... another suggestion: use less milk and just 1 tsp of bakins soda, 'cause it left a little bitter flavor at the end.

easy and delicious but trust me when I say it needs more cocoa I added a whole cup the second time because the first time it was so moist and delicious but needed more cocoa flavor. Maybe it's the brand I add but ADD MORE COCOA!

Incredibly fast and simple to make, perfectly moist and delicious.  The recipe is resilient, too -- I added an extra tablespoon of cocoa, subtracted 1/4 cup of sugar, and substituted half whole-wheat flour, and it worked out great.  Excellent with 7-minute frosting.

This is THE BEST chocolate cake recipe.  Everyone raves about it, and it's SO simple!  I made cupcakes with it, and baked them @325 for 15 minutes.  I will not use another chocolate cake recipe, this one is "it" for me.

This is the best chocolate cake ever! I was a little nervous because I had to make it dairy-free (with a soy-butter chocolate frosting) and it turned out fabulous! It's the kind of cake that would be wonderful even without the frosting.  And super easy to make. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was an awesome recipe! My fiancÃ© said it was the best chocolate cake he had ever tasted. I made this for my birthday because I needed something to whip up quickly since company was coming in less than 2 hours.  I did not even frost it, just ate it with whipped cream served on the side. Delicious!

Very tasty.  Easy to prepare.  Came together very nicely.  Followed directions exactly.  Maybe next time I will alter it a little.  I have some hazelnut oil I've been wanting to use up.  Sounds yummy either way.  Thanks for posting this delicious recipe.

Easy, quick, and on the "healthier" side of typical chocolately desserts!  I made two dozen cupcakes, and the batter amount was just about right (maybe slightly more than I needed).  I decreased the amount of sugar to 1 1/4 cup with no issues.  If you have instant espresso or instant coffee on hand, add 1-2 tablespoons of it to the mixed batter (or you can add to the hot water, I assume.. but I hadn't thought of it at that moment yet).. it does wonders for enhancing the chocolate taste!  I also made sure to sift all of the dry ingredients for a lighter cake texture.  The one bowl aspect of this recipe is a major winner, but you also get fantastic results - so it's not like you're sacrificing quality for quantity at all!  I baked my cupcakes for 22 minutes (my oven runs a bit hotter than the dial states - so the toothpick test is essential at the 20 minute mark), and they were good.  I could have gone a little bit less, too.  I frosted with a little bit of pink buttercream frosting (tinged with almond extract), and it gave it great depth of flavor.  And I just love that dark brown/pink color combo. :)  I've posted a picture!  One more thing: I ate one right after frosting them, and they were slightly dry.  Put them in the fridge, in an air-tight container overnight.. and the next day, they become totally moist - especially at room temp!  So, this only gets better with time. :)  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I fully agree with mom2hhh; the cake came out rather "normal" or bland in taste as it tasted just like any ordinary chocolate cakes! I followed recipe closely, only decrease baking soda to 1 tsp instead of 1 Â½ tsp as I do not want my cake to taste like too "chemicalâ " and added 2 tsp of instant coffee into the cup of boiling water just to bring out the chocolaty taste better as advised by others (even double check with Hersheyâs site in advance just to ensure I did right). I was disappointed that the cake came out dry externally as it lacks the moist like "Too Much Chocolate Cake" from this site. This is out of our recipe box and I'll revert to "Too Much Chocolate Cake" from now on. A 3-star for cake taste and 5-star for its simplicity as you can whip out this cake in no time.

This didn't work for me. It came out flat.... I mean really flat! It  was only about 1" thick (didn't rise at all).  I had wanted a "dense" type cake - but this came out more dense than even  brownies. All I can figure is I must have done something wrong - but in going over it several times, I just can find my mistake. Glad it works for most everyone else. Wont be re-trying this one. I'll go back to the recipes that include sour cream and pudding.

As others have said, this is the Hersey's recipe for chocolate cake.  That being said, this is a good one!  The cake comes out really moist and flavorful - I even left out the vanilla by accident, which I can't believe considering I'm a vanilla fuh-reak!  Great, great cake - and I'm not even that big on chocolate cake.  No more boxed cake mixes for me!

This was fantastic. I, like many other people, was a little scared after adding the water. But the cake was great! I actually made cupcakes, and it made 24 overflowing cupcakes. They tasted so good. Rich and fluffy all at the same time. I frosted them with my favorite chocolate frosting recipe and everyone in my family loved them. Next time I want to pipe cream into the middle of them!

This cake is very good and really easy to make. I've made it twice now and both times it's been kind of fragile (falling apart easily while cutting), but sitting overnight after being frosted seemed to help the rest of the cake stay together. The second time, I increased the cocoa to 1 cup. The extra chocolate flavor was d'lish! :> Definitely keeping this recipe around.

Excellent cake, the only problem is it is so rich you need to make sure you take a small piece or you won't be able to finish it!

This is fairly tasty, would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.  I made it as the recipe says, but used Splenda as I didn't have sugar on hand.  It didn't seem as watery as I would have thought by other reviews.  In fact, prior to adding the water, it was so thick that it "crawled" up to the belly of my mixer, almost more like a brownie consistency, but even thicker.  Alone, it tastes kind of bitter, which could possibly be the Splenda.  It was a rather dense cake, but definitely moist.  I iced it with about 1/2 container store bought milk chocolate icing mixed with a small container of regular cream cheese.  That combination was very good with the cake.  Overall, quite tasty but not sure I would make again due to the bitterness.

After trying the too much chocolate cake recipe from this site and a recipe from a well known chef, this recipe came out the best in that it's springy, moist and fluffy. Although I'm a chocoholic I might not be a big fan of chocolate cakes making it very difficult for me to find a chocolate cake recipe that strikes me as out of this world. This recipe will become my current staple until I find another recipe that's more chocolatey and distinct.

I made cupcakes instead of a cake and baked the cupcakes for about 15-20 minutes. It turned out really good! I followed other reviewers and added more cocoa powder. I also substitute one cup of fresh brew coffee for one cup of water to add more flavor (personal preference). If you like dark chocolate, this is a way to go!

This is the PERFECT chocolate cake. I made in two 10"pans and cooked for 30 minutes. Make sure you grease and flour pretty liberally, as sticking was a little bit of an issue.   I followed this recipe exactly, pairing it with the "Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting." It was to die for -- I had several people tell me it was the best chocolate cake they had ever eaten. Likewise, non cake-eaters were even scarfing it down.   As suggested by some, I made this the night before and let the cake sit overnight; I took it out 20 minutes before serving and it was just perfect.   Thanks for a great recipe :)

This cake is amazing!  I have used it soo many times!  I have also altered it to make an almond cake and a lemon cake.  I substituted the cocoa for cake flour (which gave it a very spongy texture) and added lemon juice and grated lemon peel in place of the vanilla.  I also used the cake flour and almond extract for the almond cake....AMAZING!!!

This cake was very rich and chocolately!!! I made this for a birthday party and everyone had a nice big slice!  I covered it in chocolate icing... Mmmmm  I used 1 cup of hot espresso instead of hot water - thats the only thing I changed :)

I bake.  I bake a lot.  I followed the recipe exactly and I was a little concerned at how thin the batter was.  I made this into cupcakes.  It made 27 cupcakes. 27 cupcakes that I only filled 2/3 full but they still overflowed and ran flat onto the top of my muffin tins and then stuck there.  I had to tear the tops off which makes for pretty fugly cupcakes.  They taste alright, but the edges of the tops were a little chewy where they overflowed. I usually make "Barb's Chocolate Cake" off this site and that one rocks, so I don't know why I deviated.  Oh well.  I made some kick butt white chocolate mint frosting though! I'm going to post that recipe.  It's deee-lish on chocolate cupcakes.

UPDATE:  This recipe is the exact same one from a Hersheys cookbook. *** Made this exactly as stated. They weren't kidding when it says the batter will be runny after adding the boiling water. I'm glad I saw that or I would have been worried. I put a mug of water in the microwave for 2 minutes for the boiling water. Whether or not it boiled I have no idea as I didn't watch it but it was hot enough. This cake was amazing. Very spongy and airy and light. Definitely make sure to grease the pan(s) enough. I used a bundt pan and it worked perfectly. Also make sure to let it cool for the 10 minutes- otherwise it may not come out of the pan completely. I will never again buy cake mix (thank goodness!) from a box again! Very quick and easy to make! Thanks ever so much!

This recipe is amazing. It turned out perfect! Separated from the pan with ease and was really moist and dense. I'll definitely be making this one again. It goes GREAT with the Taste of Home frosting recipe on this site: "Rich Chocolate Frosting" submitted by Amy Via.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I've made this cake several times, and each time it came out delicious! I followed recommendations to make it 1 cup of cocoa and used Ghiradelli cocoa powder and it is fantastic. It's very moist and chocolatey. The first few times I used duncan hines frostings but I've also used a buttercream frosting and it tastes amazing. I also made this cake with a strawberry filling and covered it with chocolate ganache and it turned out absolutely gorgeous and delicious!The most recent time I made them, I made mini cupcakes and baked them for 13 minutes at 350. Half the batter is enough to make a little over 36 of them but make sure to fill it up ONLY 3/4 of the way because they rise a lot! Thanks for this recipe! Absolutely amazing!! :)

This cake was definitely as easy as it claimed to be.  I made this for the bottom tier of a three tier wedding cake.  I used different liquors in each cake, and in this one, instead of vanilla, I used a little more then a tablespoon of Kahlua.  It was very moist, and sturdy, as well.  Thanks for the recipe!

this cake was incredibly easy, so it scores mega points for me - my two and a half year old did all of the measuring and stirring, if that says anything.  i thought it tasted good, not great. it has a similar texture and flavor to a boxed mix.  not that that is a bad thing, i just think that a cake from scratch should be a bit richer than what you would buy in a box.  i frosted it with a butterscotch frosting and i loved the combination.

I have to say this is amazing! Fast and delicious! Others mention changing the amount of cocoa powder. Here's the scoop: if you are using high quality cocoa, you can definitely reduce it. If you are using regular hershey's cocoa, you can increase it up to 1 cup. But remember, it's still personal preference as to how rich you like your cake and what you plan to top it with. I recently served it frosting free with vanilla ice cream topped with strawberries and bananas and it was fantastic!

Very good, very easy. Very moist and tasty. Inscreased the cocoa a little bit. I could eat this without frosting, but if I were going to frost it again, it would be with a vanilla frosting instead of chocolate.

I upped the coco to 1 c., used 1 c. stong brewed coffee in place of the water and baked it in a 9x13 pan at 350 for 40 mins. I made it into a "Better Than Sex Cake" it was a huge hit at work. I made the recipe again, with the modifications above, into cupcakes baked at 350 for 20 mins and these were my favorite. I iced them with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site.

This was a fabulously moist, chocolatey cake.  I added a squirt of Hershey's syrup to the batter, and also used strong coffee in place of the water.  I was a little worried because the batter was SO thin, but it turned out just right!

This recipe is pretty good, and very easy to make.  I did make a couple small alterations.  Instead of adding 1 cup boiling water, I added 1 cup stong brewed coffee.  Coffee really brings out the flavor of the cocoa powder.  I also added about 1 Tbsp. of cinnamon to the dry ingredients.

My first chocolate cake from scratch, and it was a huge hit. This recipe has it all - it has only a few easily available ingredients, it's moist, and it's has a deep chocolate flavor. I used very good cocoa powder, and it made all the difference. Make sure to butter and flour the pans because the cake tends to stick. Also, do NOT fill the pans to the brim, or the mixture will expand and fall over the sides. If you don't put a baking sheet under the cake pan (as I did once), the mixture will smoke and burn on the bottom of the oven. Oops. Anyway, about 2/3 from the top will do it. You can make a couple cupcakes from the left over batter, if you have any. I poured 'Hard Chocolate Glaze' (from another allrecipe member) in between the two layers and all over the top. It was too much! Everyone was in heaven :)

Wow, what a cake. I have made many variations of a chocolate cake and this by far was the best! Yes, the batter did appear very "soupy" but once it came out of the oven it was just perfect. I made this for a birthday and got rave reviews, there was barely any left over! I will definitely make this again.

This is a great chocolate cake recipe. I made a 13x9 cake and topped it with homemade chocolate buttercream icing. The cake was tender, very moist and rich in flavor. It was easy to make and really good. I will make this again and again and will never buy a mix - this is too easy and so much better.

I didn't really like this recipe, the batter was very thin, almost like water.  The cupcakes I made did rise very nicely though.  And my hubby and 2 yr old liked them.

All I need to say is WOW. This is the ONLY chocolate cake recipe you need! I know it said that the batter would be thin/runny after adding the water, but it still looked TOO runny... I thought, "What the hey, I'll bake it anyway." It is SO moist and DELICIOUS! This only reinforces my decision to quit cake mixes - I've never looked back! :)  I'm not a chocoholic, so I went with a vanilla frosting... it is a recipe I got from my grandma, who got it from a friend befoe my mom was born.  2T and 2t flour 1 cup milk 1 cup butter (2 sticks) softened 1 cup sugar 1 1/2 t vanilla.  Mix all of the flour with a little milk until it is smooth. Mix in the rest of the milk and heat on the stove over medium heat *WHISKING CONSTANTLY* until it is thick and smooth. Let cool. In a mixer (or w/ a hand mixer) cream the butter and sugar. While mixer is still going, add th cooled milk mixture a little at a time. Beat until fluffy. Add vanilla and beat until incorporated.  This is the PERFECT frosting - not so sweet your mouth hurts, just creamy and perfect!  Give it a try! (But give Mrs. Holly all the credit for her fabulous recipe!)  ^_^

Very good recipe for basic chocolate cake. Had a pleasant flavor and I made it as written. Great because the ingredients are always things I have around the house. Better than boxed chocolate cake!

the best chocolate cake ever. my husband made this for a cub scout dinner and it was a winner. it's very moist, i suggest putting parchment circles on the bottoms of the cake pans, as it may stick. make this recipe and you'll never make another!

I was for something quick and easy to do with my 4yr old daughter. This is just the ticket! Very moist and fluffy. However I would have aenjoyed a little more of a chocolate flavor. Always room for improvement maybe some choclate chips or syrup. Still a keeper as is.

Wow. Fantastic. Easy. Don't change anything on the original recipe. I used two round cake pans (reduced cooking time by 5 minutes). Also, used icing recipe from back of Herseys Cocoa can. Moist. Delicious.

I halved the recipe and made 18 beautiful cupcakes.Didn't change a thing, except I added 1/2 teaspoon of peppermint extract (for fun only).I didn't read all the reviews before I made this, but I checked it out just after. To start with, this recipe is totally working!!! Everything - ingredients, amounts - is right! I'm glad I gave it a shot! Thank for submitting!

This cake is quick, easy and yummy! I hate dry cakes, and I was delighted that this was so moist. I put whipped cream and sour cherries between layers and on top, and sprinkled with chocolate flakes. I made it for my fiance's birthday, and he INHALED it!

I followed the recipe exactly (but used a blender as I didn't have a mixer).
For filling I used strawberry jam and on the top I melted some chocolate and mixed it with chocolate wafer cookies. 
Everybody absolutely loved it.

Amazing. Great taste! Do use 1 cup of cocoa. I made this, but I only had 2 8 inch pans.. that worked fine. It is not too dry or too moist. I could actually grab the cake with my hands with out it breaking on me. I frosted the cake with a fluffy frosting I made with instant pudding and whipped topping. It was easy to make and delicious! I couldn't take a photo because it was gone before i could haha.

This cake was SO good - I used cake flour, but other than that, made the recipe as it was written. I made two layers, made a simple chocolate frosting to put on top/in between the layers, and the cake was a hit. Served it at a friend's birthday and everyone loved it! It was moist, chocolatey and really, really good.

This is by far the easiest chocolate cake I've ever made, and sooooo moist and delicious - YUM! I followed suggestions of other reviewers and increased cocoa to a cup, and also added 2 tsps instant coffee to the hot water. It was just perfect! Thanks for such a wonderful recipe.

This was extremely easy to make, and even though I increased the cocoa powder to one cup, I didn't think it was a "wow" cake.  But it's a great cake to make as a standby because I think most people would have all the ingredients on hand.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really light and moist. Only change I made was to use 1 cup cocoa powder as almost everybody suggested. I also used applesauce for all the oil. Appearance and texture wise, it was great. Taste wise, not nearly sweet enough for my taste, but it was still superb. I had doubts about the method, but surprisingly, it baked to perfection right on the 30 min mark. I never had that happen before! Definite keeper and will make again. And again.

Great simple choc. cake. I am known for my elaborate baking endeavors, which are usually delectable...but I had to make a birthday cake and was in a major hurry the day before so I used this cake recipe, the chocolate ganache recipe from this site, and spread seedless raspberry jam in between loaves for a raspberry chocolate ganache cake. I was skeptical venturing out into the unknown for someone's birthday, but I got RAVE reviews!!! Next time I will make more ganache as there was not enough for this cake, but the cake itself was very simple to prepare and quite tasty. Not too rich either, as it uses cocoa instead of chocolate. Good choc. cake recipe when time is short! I rated 4 stars as I did not make with frosting as directed.

Finding this recipe here at AllRecipes.com just made my life a whole lot easier. Thanks for posting it, shirleyo. This cake got way more than 5 stars from my chronic chocoholic husband. I'm sure I'll make it a gazillion times now, and LOVE the ease of this delicate, moist cake recipe.

I, too, baked it in a 9x13 pan for 40 minutes at 350. Came out just perfect!

This cake is bloody amazingly easy to cook, and came out wonderfully. It had a gently chewy crust, and was very moist and fluffy. The batter was less thick than pancake batter, but came out beautifully. (I had believed the recipe was ruined but wanted to try it anyway- don't be fooled by the thin mixture- it turns out delicious!)

Wow! I wasn't sure if I'd be able to do a "from scratch" chocolate cake, but this recipe worked fantastically! The cake is absolutely delicious. I even made "healthy" substitutions and it still turned out fantastic. I used part Splenda, part white sugar, increased the cocoa to 1 cup, substituted strong coffee for water and used 1/2 cup applesauce instead of oil. It baked perfectly and tastes delish topped with chocolate frosting.

Not a very good recipe. Flavor is good but the cake is very crumbly. I followed the exact recipe as this is my son's birthday cake and I wanted it to be perfect. Not my idea of a geat cake. I think the texture needs improving. I will try another recipe from this site next time tho.

I made cupcakes using this recipe and they turned out great - rich and chocolatey without being too sweet.  I halved the recipe and made 12 large cupcakes. I added a simple milk chocolate icing and chopped walnuts on top of the cupcakes and they tasted even yummier.

This turned out light not dense for me. Perhaps it is because I sifted the flour and cocoa powder. It taste just like a box mix... which I didn't mind at all.

This was the best chocolate cake from scratch I have ever had. Usually scratch cakes I find are dry but this was moist and not ridiculously sweet. I did not change a thing and would never. I used a cream cheese frosting recipe and unfortunatly can not stop eating this cake!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. It was very airy and light (not dense), which is exactly what I wanted. I added choc chips after I poured the batter and they sank to the bottom. Next time, I will add them after the batter has thickened a little.

I just made this cake for my sister and laws reception.  It was delicious!  And easy.  Only problem was that it boiled over the pan while cooking (even after we only filled the pans half way).  Totally worth it.

This cake is amazing. I actually forgot to get the vanilla extract and was worried it wouldn't come out good but it was still EXCELLENT. It was sooo easy to make. It did take about 15 minutes more to make than expected but it was worth the wait. I was worried because when I checked on it in the oven, it seemed so light and it fell a little in the middle but it came out great! Love it.

This is the best chocolate cake recipe available, especially if you are looking for a light, airy, very chocolatey cake.  I used the recipe to make cupcakes, and it made about 30 cupcakes with perfect domed tops and a very moist crumb.  I used 1 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown sugar, added an extra 1/4 c. cocoa, and doubled the vanilla. Perfect!

Great recipe! Very easy to make and it came out tasting great! The batter is thin, almost watery like, and that scared me at first but I remembered other reviewers warnings and went with it - glad I did. Very moist. I upped the cocoa to 1 cup and used a 9 x 13 pan, baked for 35 minutes and it was perfect. This was actually my first attempt at homemade cake and everyone was impressed! Thanks so much!

I made this last night, and I used the 1 cup cocoa, and one larger pan, for 40 min.  It was divine.  I have to make it again tonight, because the family went nuts over it.  We all agree that it's a wonderful recipe.

The taste was fantastic, but heads up to others, this makes more mix than a standard cake mix (i.e. more than 24 cupcakes in my case) so be prepared for that.

Very quick & easy cake! I used 1 cup of cocoa powder, reduced the sugar to 1 & 1/2 cups and added 2 teaspoons of instant coffee to the boiling water. Took about 55mins to bake rather than 35mins but I was using a funny shaped pan. A lovely light chocolate cake that I will be making again!!!

I will never buy a pre-made cake mix again. Turned out lovely. :o) So wonderful that everyone raved that it was better than my sister-in-law (who is a professional cake maker).  The caked popped outa the pan perfectly (I coated it with butter and powdered cocoa) and it was moist and yummy. I did use the boiling coffee per one persons comment earlier.Not very chocolate tasting, though, but if you are craving something sweet, this is it!

I made this on a spur of the moment.  My son wanted to take chocolate cupcakes to preschool for his birthday and I didn't have a cake mix on hand.  My hopes weren't high because I can't even make a boxed cake mix come out right.  Boy was I suprised.  This recipe is WONDERFUL!  It was super easy to make and very moist.  My husband didn't believe me when I told him it was homeade. Thank you so much for the recipe, it's a keeper for sure!

Moist and very chocolatey!  Great cake and it's a cinch to make.  I never thought you could add wet to dry ingredients but it worked fine.  
FYI- If you get the idea of using a cream cheese frosting on this cake, it's probably not a good idea to use Cream Cheese Frosting II on this site.  Made as instructed it's far too runny to be suitable for a cake.  (I found this out the hard way)

I tried making this cake twice.  The first time it didn't cook evenly and fell apart when I tried to take it out of the pan.  The second time it was dry.  Both times the cakes fell in the center.  I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong but I'm going to keep searching for a cake recipe.

This cake is awesome!  Moist, chocolatey, easy to make and not too sweet, so it pairs perfectly with a buttercream frosting.  I followed the directions exactly except I added about 1/2 cup chopped semi-sweet chocolate chips -thinking it would be similar to choc. chip muffins- but I put them in before adding the boiling water so of course they melted. And also I split the batter between 2 heart shaped pans lined with parchment.  The texture was great- after cooling they removed from the pan and held together perfectly.   One was dusted with confectioners sugar only- simple and elegant- and served a day after baking. Hubby preferred that one.  The other was frosted with a buttercream frosting from this site (sorry, can't remember which one right now) as a birthday cake which the family just loved.  Will definitely make this again.

A great cake for being sooo easy. I added hot instant coffee in place of the boiling water which made the cake extremely dark and rich tasting. Then I topped it with the Brown Sugar Cream Cheese Frosting from this site. Delicious.

I made this for my husbands birthday, my parents came over and we serious considered opening a bakery because of this cake! Everyone loved this cake, it was so mosit and full of the chocolate flavor we were craving! 
I followed the recipe exactly, using nestle cocoa powder and I melted 1 bar of the Ghirardelli baking chocolate to add to the chocolate infusion.
I made a simpe icing for the cake and poured it on hot, it was perfect.
I have made this cake numerous times now, and each time it comes out perfecly!

I made this cake yesterday  for my hubby (Valentine's Day).  He's not much for making comments, but did like it.  I loved it!  I think  it's the best chocolate cake I've ever made.  It was so moist and tasty, not too sweet-just right!

The only changes I made were to use whole wheat flour, as I always do, ( used a little less-1/14 cup) and less salt-1/2 tsp. is plenty. For icing, I whipped one pint of cream, and added about 1 Tbsp. each of sugar and cocoa powder.  A perfect topping for this cake!

For cupcakes, I noticed if you google Hershey Chocolate cake,  you will get instructions on them and other types of pans.  I couldn't find my heart pan, so used an oblong one, approx. 10 x 14".

I have made this cake for company, showers, & just for myself and my husband. He will eat it for breakfast if he can :) Thanks for a great recipe, I don't think it is really necessary to top with icing since the cake is so moist. Just sprinkle with some dark & white chocolate chips while cake is still warm.

Runny yes, bland no. Wow, what a wonderful, moist chocolatey delight! First time making it. I will look no further for this type of cake. Thanks for the recipe.

When I first made this, it tasted a little off, but when I tried it again the next day it was great. Very mysterious. Anyway, it had a good texture and not-overly-strong chocolate flavor, but I disagree with the person who said it was easier than a boxed mix. no way jose!

I made this cake for my son's birthday, and after reading all the great reviews, was very disappointed. The taste wasn't great, even using 1 cup of cocoa, the cake was heavy. Not a favorite at all.

I was looking for a simple but moist chocolate birthday cake and came across this recipe.  this is a gorgeous cake which i have made for my three childrens' birthdays, they love it and so do all their friends.  a perfect recipe, but i do put a bit less water in it than suggested, so the batter is not too runny.

I've been making this cake for years and its awesome! However, my recipe calls for 2 cups of flour and only 1 tsp each of baking powder and baking soda. I also use 1 cup of cold, strong coffee in stead of the milk. Enjoy! It's amazing!!

I made  this cake for my coworker's birthday and it was a hit! I baked it in a 9X14 pyrex dish. It is quite sticky at the bottom but the flavor was great. I also used strong coffee instead of the boiling water to add more taste. I frosted the cake with a chocolate/sour cream frosting...delicious...

This will probably end up being my staple chocolate cake. It turned out fantastic. Don't worry about the batter being so thin before you bake it, it will turn out perfectly. I covered mine with two layers of chocolate ganache and topped it with some fresh strawberries, and I had a hard time not drooling all over it...

Very easy to make, all in one bowl (which I loved), and the flavor was rich and chocolatey. This was very very moist. This is a keeper, thanks Shirley.

I made this recipe for Fourth of July cupcakes. I halved the recipe for 12 cupcakes and followed the recipe exactly. I used some fancy cocoa fron Holland I found at the store for my husband who is picky about his chocolate. I also used the brown sugar cream cheese frosting recipe on this website. Topped with raspberries and blueberries, it looked very festive. And it tasted GREAT. We ended up eating cupcakes for dinner one night. It looks thin but that works perfectly for cupcakes- scooping it into the cups is easy. And they come out so moist and wonderfully delicious!

Seriously the best chocolate cake I have ever had...and my whole family agrees. Very chocolate-y, and SO easy! I've made it 4 times and I've found you really have to thoroughly grease the pan(s) as it does have a tendency to stick a little bit. But overall SO yummy!!

Good fluffy and easy cake, I think it lacked a little flavor, next time I am going to add some coffee to it, or maybe some chocolate chips as I like a real chocolaty tasting cake.

followed it EXACTLY with the exception of a little variation with the oven time, which is different for each oven. However, all i had to do is check the center with a toothpick. Ok, so it was a big hit, especially when i filled it with a layer of raspberry jam and thawed out raspberries, and a second layer of chocolate fudge. Then iced it with no other than chocolate icing (only a thin layer) then used chocolate shavings to decorate plus fresh strawberries on top (i was out of fresh raspberries). I was doubtful at first because the batter was runny. I'll try it again and again with different flavours (maybe some coffee, less cocoa poweder,...etc). Thank You

Maybe I did something wrong but I found it to be quite bland and the consistency was odd. Almost like it was boiled instead of baked in the middle but with a crunchy exterior. The only real positive was that it made the house smell like hot chocolate.

Used buttermilk instead of milk, Topped it with satiny shocolate glaze from this site. Came out so delicious and chocolatey. Most people loved it, but some said it was a bit too dense, or heavy. But really very tasty and beautiful dark chocolate color. Very moist and delish as is without glaze even!

Family loved the cake, husband said it was just like he had as a kid.  The second time I tried adding some chocolate chips for the boys however, this was not so good.  They all settled because it was thin batter, whick I figured would happen, still great though.  Rises awesome

THIS RECIPE IS DELICIOUS, BUT FOUND IT TO BE AN EXACT REPLICA OF THE HERSHEY'S PERFECTLY CHOCOLATE CAKE RECIPE, FOUND ON HERSHEY'S WEBSITE. IT IS MADE WITH THE EXACT SAME INGREDIENTS AND COOKED EXACTLY THE SAME WAY.

Apart from just putting 3/4 of the amount of sugar stated in the recipe, I followed everything  else to the letter. The cake looked great. Dark brown and moist. But the taste wasn't gud at all. I juat didn't like it. I always use the same cocoa on another chocolate recipe and it tastes great. But this cakes beautiful look, it wasn't delicious at all

This was the moistest cake I've ever had, almost too fudgy the night I made it.  I used a ganache as the frosting, which made it truly decadent.  It tasted a lot better the next day, and even better the day after.  I will definitely make this again, but I will make it a couple of days ahead next time.

The best and easiest chocolate cake ever...once you've tasted it, you'll never eat chocolate cake from a boxed mix again!  The best part is that it is  simple to make and very, very moist.

This cake was so easy to make and everyone loved it!  It is very moist and goes well with the Chocolate Mousse Cake IV recipe (used this for the frosting).  Will definitely make this again.

I halved the water, but it still came out pretty good.  I overdid the chocolate though (the cocoa powder), but that was my fault.  The mix didn't look dark enough to me at first. lol

This was my first scratch cake and turned out better than any boxed cake ever has.  The cake is moist and fluffy.  I made this cake as the base for a decadant layer cake but seriously, the syrup I used to sweeten, moisten, and flavor the cake was not needed.

My family loves this cake!  I make it often, and I follow the recipe exactly as it is.  I do, though, bake it in a Bundt pan (like others have said - takes 40 min.), and we cover individual slices with hot fudge sauce (from a jar) and have ice cream on the side.  That is just Heaven on a plate!  Also, we take individual slices and wrap them up and keep them in the freezer.  When we take out a slice, we pop it in the microwave with hot fudge poured on it, heat it up, and it tastes just as fresh as the day it was baked.  Even seems to be a little more moist.  This is my hubby's favorite cake!  Thanks for the recipe!

Really enjoyed this cake. Very easy to make and several days later is still very moist. 

I didn't have the two 9-inch pans, though, so I just poured the mixture into a bundt pan and baked for 40 minutes and it came out perfectly.

I was craving for some chocolate cake, so I decided to make this.  It was my first time making cake from scratch and this was very easy.  It was very moist.  I baked it in a bundt pan for 40 minutes and topped it with chocolate ganache (found in this site).

Great with cream cheese frosting!!! 
8 oz. cream cheese, 1 cube margarine, 1 t. vanilla, 2 t. milk, 1 pound powdered sugar

Also good with this pudding frosting...1 package (4 serving size) Instant Pudding, 1/4 C powdered sugar,
1 C cold milk, 8 oz Whip topping

You can do the cream cheese in the middle with the pudding frosting outside or vice versa.  So yummy.

This cake was DELICIOUS!  I made it for a birthday cake.  It was moist and MUCH better than a boxed mix.  I frosted with Hershey's "Perfectly Chocolate" chocolate frosting (on the back of the cocoa box).  

Update: I was out of vanilla, so I used peppermint extract in exact amounts for the cake and frosting.  It was really good!

I made this cake for a group of people who were helping us remodel our house!  I wanted the cake to be scrumptious!!! This cake was definitely that!  It was very decadent and moist with wonderful flavor and not to sweet! It got rave reviews and I will never buy another chocolate cake mix again!  I did use 1 cup of cocoa powder and when the batter was in the pan I sprinkled 3/4 cup of choc chips on top, which could be omitted as the cake was plenty chocolatey:) For the frosting I used 1 14oz. can of sweetened condensed milk 1 1/4 cup semi sweet choc. chips and 1 T vanilla extract, melted in the microwave and spread on cake.  DELICIOUS!!!! Thanks for a great recipe!  Tamara

I made this for my son's birthday, and it was good, but I think all the reviews set me up for a "WOW" experience, and instead, I got a very good, but not fireworks-inducing, chocolate cake.  It was insanely easy to make.  Mine fell a smidge in the middle (could be because I was dancing while making the frosting to entertain my 4-month-old).  I baked for 35 minutes, and it was done.  Everyone said they liked it (and every plate was clean except my six-year-old birthday boy's), but I thought it was maybe even too rich, but not chocolatey enough for the richness of it.  I filled it with fresh strawberries and strawberry gel and frosted it with Butter Cream Frosting II from this site.  Overall a good cake, and I would probably make it again, but it didn't knock my socks off.

I'm sure I followed the recipe exactly but the batter never cooked completely.  I left it in the oven for over an hour.  It did make great brownies though!  Frosted with chocolate butter cream frosting.

I was searching for a good chocolate cake recipe to make for my friend's shower and made 3 test cakes before I found this recipe which worked amazing because it was so light and moist.  I actually made a big slab cake with this recipe.  I frosted with a chocolate buttercream icing (in the middle too) and then chocolate ganache over the whole thing.  When it set, I decorated with hearts using melted milk chocolate.  Everyone craves this cake.  I think I have even out done my mother in law.  Thanks.

Easy & delicious!  No need to buy boxed mixes again.   Like another reviewer, I baked this in a 9 x 13 pan for 43 minutes. Yum! My entire family loved it.

What can I say..this cake recipe is the best!  This was so easy, with NO MESS!!  Not to mention MOIST as ever!  This cake is great...I was doubtful about how thin the batter was...but was I wrong!  Another key thing is that I ran out of sugar, I only had one and a half cups of sugar left in my pantry.  The cake came out perfect!  This was a home run.  Thanks for the recipe.

I used this recipe to make cupcakes, and they were sooooo good. I loathe dry cupcakes, but these were so moist that they didn't even need icing! Only thing I can suggest though, is that when you fill your muffin tins, don't over fill them (2/3 full is good) because they rise a lot (I had a little spill). And I recomend, to watch for the airbubbles -- if you they are done (kinda like you test for pancakes), so that they don't over cook. I took mine out when they looked really glossy almost gooey, but they sprung back when I touched them and the toothpck cake clean.Highly recomended!

I kid you not, this is the best chocolate cake ever! It is the moistest cake I have ever had! So chocolaty too! I bake mine in a 9x13 pan for about 40-45 minutes. Super easy and VERY tasty!!! I usually top mine with buttercream icing (by Sharon Gerstman). Now, I need to go get me another piece!! :o)

I made this as a prop for my daughter's final in Public Speaking class, everyone loved it. I baked it in a half sheet pan and frosted with a "real" butter cream{butter, pwd sugar, cream and a splash of vanilla}She got an A{on her speech, of course}and she brought home no leftovers. I gave it 5 stars.

This recipe was great.  I used apple sauce instead of oil, still turned out fluffy.  And it was really easy to make.

A beautiful cake!  It did not stick at all, rose perfectly and was so moist and fluffy.  I opted to make it more interesting by adding sliced almonds, coconut, dried cherries and ground ginger - mmm.  Also, I substituted maple sugar for the white sugar and you could not tell the difference (you must add 1/4 of baking soda for every 1 cup of maple though).  Will definitely make this gem again!!!

I decided on this recipe because of the simple ingrediants and excellent reviews. It turned out to be a great choice, because the birthday girl dubbed it "the best cake chocolate cake she ever had". It was easy to make and came out perfect. Just make sure you bake it long enough. Goes well with chocolate ganache.

This was the first homemade cake I have ever made and it was wonderingful. I used a square pan, and it was the first time I've ever had a cake come out flat with no bump in the middle. I keep thinking this isn't going to work, but it did. It tastes great with choclate fudge frosting. As another review said it would taste even beeter with better quality cocoa powder.

I found this cake to be the most moist cake ever.Cleaning out my recipe folder at home,I found that I had this same recipe clipped out of a Family Circle magazine advertising Hersheys cocoa powder.It was in a Feb.1999 issue.I apparently never made it because I would have remembered making such a delicious cake.Thanks.

Sooooo delicious!!!  Very easy to make I used a 9 x 13 baking dish baked it for 45 min. I didn't  have milk so I added water to heavy whipping cream. My friend said she was going to make this for her BF so of course It made me want to make one. I just wanted one piece so made it my husband and I had a piece and I took the rest to work. It was a big hit everyone loved it.

I just made this today as a 2 layer cake.  Tops were nice and even, cake came out of the pans with no issues.  However, it was really tender and when I started frosting it chunks started falling apart.  Maybe missed my water or flour measurements.

Taste was great, but it overflowed. Use 3 pans or 2 large. It also stuck even though it was generously greased. Use parchment too.

I changed the regular flour to Gluten Free Flour as we are a family of Celiacs, so was not sure how it would turn out.  It was fabulous, and all enjoyed it.
Topped it with white Buttercream icing.

I really had my doubts about this once I added the hot water and it was so runny.  However, this is one of the best and easiest chocolate cakes I have made to date.  After reading other reviews I went with a full cup of cocoa and I will stick to that going forward. Used a 9x13 pan and baked for 38 mins.

This is one of the best cake mixes I've used in awhile. Except for 2 things I followed the recipe exactly. I used 1/2 cup of water & half a cup of coffee &  I baked it in a 9X13 baking dish for 40 minutes. The only thing is, let it sit for a few hours before removing from a pan or frosting it or trying to cut it. The longer it sits the better it is!  I was concerned with how thin the batter was, but that is a non issue!  The cake is very moist & spongy. The taste reminds me of devils food. I will most certainly make this cake again & the recipe will be a go to from here on out!

OMG! This is the BEST chocolate cake I have ever eaten in my life, it is moist and chocolatey. I followed othersâ suggestions and upped the cocoa powder to 1 cup and added a 1/2 tbsp espresso powder to the boiling water. I did not have any issues getting my cakes out of the pans (2 rounds) but they were very well greased. I will save this as my go-to chocolate cake recipe

I also upped the cocoa amount to 1 cup, because chocolate, and it was delicious. I made it in 2 9-in round pans & made it a layer cake with no problem. Half it it was gone by the end of the night, so - success!

Unless you bake a lot, I don't recommend this recipe. It has far too much liquid. Fortunately, I'm a chef and knew to add more flour and little more baking powder. The flavor is good but its got chocolate so hard to mess that up.
I think there are better recipes for choc cake.

The cake is easy to make and delicious. I made this for my daughter's birthday.  Her husband requested I make it for his birthday.    Almost a week later the cake still tasted fresh and moist. 

I'll be making this again.

Excellent cake, Large enough to serve lots of people. I've made it twice this month. I sandwiched with a chocolate coconut spread ('Umium' made in Jamaica, Caribbean) and covered with chocolate frosting- delicious! Everyone enjoyed it.

Not too sweet. All the things cake should be. Nothing terribly exciting. 
I substituted Soy Milk and it was fine. 
Frosted with whipped buttercream.
Good base for adding flavors to cake. Goes well with fruit  layer.

Used one cup of cocoa. Didn't want to set up while cooking. Baking time and temp I think are off. After 43 minutes I took it out and it still didn't seem done. After cooling the edges were a little hard (still soft but not perfectly uniform with the rest of the cake) and the rest seemed cooked perfectly. Definitely too much batter for your average 9 in round baking pans. I had enough for 10 cup cakes and 2 pans. Over all it was ok and with adjustments I would probably use it. Not what I expected though. Definitely not a light fluffy cake.

Made the cake exactly as suggested and it turned out great.  Mine did take about 10 minutes longer to cook so that the toothpick came out clean.  At 30 minutes the center was still batter like.

I have never found a cake recipe that tasted like a box mix.....until now. I swear I used a box of devil food cake mix, it is that good. I only made half a recipe and one layer since it is just me. This is going into my "must make always" file!

I made this in 2 8â pans and layered it. I was a bit worried but it turned out AMAZING!! I got nothing but rave reviews from everyone at work. I have never made a scratch so I was worried. This was amazing. The center was just a bit fudgy on removal from the oven but it cooled great and it was so moist and delicious. I buttered and floured the pans and let it cool for maybe 20 minutes before I removed it and it came out beautifully

First time making this recipe.  My bake time was only 25 minutes and even then there was a "crust" on the sides and bottom.  Very moist with a rich chocolate taste.  Next time I will add more cocoa.  This cake is delicious on its own but fantastic with a chocolate buttercream.  I highly recommend this recipe to anyone that doesn't bake that often but craves a scratch cake!

this was an interesting recipe... you have to eat this cake with a glass of water because of how much freaking cocoa is in this cake. also i'm still confused why there is a cup of boiling water.  it made it moist but it made the middle of the cake bubble and then it fell out. it smelt like something was burning when it was baking. the water made it bubble a lot and had no point into the recipe. the top where it was bubbly tasted very burnt and it was so thin that it ruined the top of the cake. you definitely need a good amount of frosting because of the amount of cocoa. you need to let it sit over night (or for a couple of hours because of how chocolaty it is) I don't know if you should add less cocoa but that's up to you. overall this was a pretty good cake but probably only for very rich chocolate lovers.

This turned out very well! Chocolatey and moist. I doubled the recipe and made two 9â rounds and a 9 x 13. I cooked the 9â rounds as directed and the  9 x 13  for 40 minutes. I substituted coconut oil for vegetable oil and it didnât affect flavor.

I have been craving chocolate cake with vanilla buttercream frosting, found this recipe and so happy that I did.  I made it in a 9 X 13 stoneware pan, baked for 40 minutes. I increased the cocoa to 1 cup and used 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup milk. Turned out delicious, will definitely make again.

This is my all- time favorite chocolate cake! It stays moist, and just melts in your mouth. Making it can be messy because of how liquidy it is, but I alway grease, flour and line my 9-in cake pans with parchment paper and they come out fine. I always make with a whipped chocolate ganache frosting and powdered sugar...raspberries are good to add for some flavor variation as well. Be careful when checking that your cakes are done - I usually check after about 32 minutes, but if still slightly wobbly leave in for 3 minutes or so. If youâre too rough when checking this, cakes can deflate (but they still taste amazing).

Before  making this cake I didn't check to see if I had any eggs, spoiler alert I didn't.  So I used apple sauce which ultimately made it better. Would make this cake again, and I do advise using apples sauce instead of eggs.

After reading the reviews I decided to try this easy chocolate cake.  TENS ACROSS THE  BOARD! This was my first time making  a chocolate cake and it turned out amazing. I substituted the vegetable oil for peanut oil be cause that was all I had and I think I'm going to stick to that going forward. I was a little concerned after adding the water (it's very soupy) but I trusted the recipe. It was also really easy to make. I used a bundt pan and baked it for 40 min since it was deep. It turned out perfect.  I topped it with powdered sugar so I could really enjoy the cake. This recipe will be added to my list of cakes to bake for sure.

I did not flour my pans because I was using non stick from well known cookware maker. This was a big mistake. This cake is fragile. It still was delicious but I had a super hard time getting out of my pans. I will make it again.

Itâs a good cake and a go to cake if  you want something easy and if you crave cake. I will make it again however itâs not at the top of my list for chocolate cake. My go to chocolate cake is the one I use for Baileys  Irish Cream Chocolate cake.

We used ghee instead of vegetable oil and my 2 year old granddaughter chose a pyrex ring dish instead of the two cake pans. It came out moist, rich and so very tasty. She painted ghee allover the inside of the dish instead of using flour and oil.  Slipped right out.

Its easy to make but not easy to bake. Fallowed the recipe except I used 3 six inch cake pans and they were not dome in 35 min. They were still completly liquid after the 35 min. An hour later and its still soup......plus it spilled over the top of my pans, all over my pan wraps and the bottom of the stove making a big mess. I'm not happy with this mix and will not be using it again. Maybe half the qater or something or even a 1/4 of the water. Not good.

I have made this cake twice and it turns out consistently good.  The second time I made it, I upped the cocoa to a full cup, and substituted strong brew coffee for the boiling water. 
My parents are diabetic and since I primarily make this cake for them I cut the sugar by half and add Ideal brand xylitol sweetener for baking.  It doesn't change the flavor or consistency and I feel better about the cake they were going to eat anyway, and it's better than them making a cake from a mix where there's no control over the sugar content.

I am not a baker from scratch person but this caught my eye. I read the reviews and added the full cup of cocoa powder instead of the 3 /4 that the recipe called for. I also made it dairy free using plant based milk. It came out wonderfully moist and delicious. Not overly sweet at all. I am saving this recipe for later use.

Great cake, I've made it twice changing up the recipe just a little. I cut down the baking soda & baking powder to one tsp, added a box of chocolate pudding mix, used one cup of cocoa powder and substituted the water for boiled coffee and now it's perfect. The best cake that my family has ever eaten.

This cake is so so so good! It's been my go-to chocolate cake recipe and it's always delicious! It's moist, chocolatey, and it goes well with just about any type of frosting. It's also incredibly easy to make. I highly recommend!

I added the whole cup of cocoa as some recommended.  This cake was moist and amazing. No problem at all making it in to a layer cake. Used parchment to avoid sticking, since I often have that issue with cakes. Thanks for sharing!

Honestly, this cake turned out to be the best cake I have EVER baked! I made it 2 days ago and today at 9am I am already baking another. My kids and husband loved it! Don't be scared of the soupy look of the batter when you add the hot water at the end..... Stick it in the oven and 35 minutes later, you will have a moist and delicious cake!

I'm very happy with this recipe! I was looking for a easy chocolate cake recipe because I didn't want to get any box cake. I did add a couple extra teaspoons of vanilla to mine. I put them in 9in pans and left them in the oven for 30 minutes. They came out perfectly cooked and moist on the inside. I made some peanut butter icing for it. It was delicious !

I made this cake for my son's birthday. The only substitution I made was a combination of coconut/olive oil for the vegetable oil because that's what I had. Turned out so delicious! Very rich, fudgy and moist.

It was sooooo good.i didn't have any vanilla extract so i used almond extract instead. One thing to know about almond extract is that if you don't have any vanilla used half of what it calls for. For example: one teaspoon vanilla extract. Use half a teaspoon of almond extract. It has a way stronger flavor.

I literally was having a hankering for cake and this whole recipe took me about 10 minutes to whip together. I just took everything I needed out  and threw it all in the bowl while I had my kettle going with the one cup of boiling water pre measured for the very end. I increased the cocoa to 1 full cup bc I like a darker colored cake. I didnât get a chalky undertaste some people get with cheaper cocoa. I purchased that cocoa at Aldi so who knows? 

This cake is for the books you guys! The boiling water tempers the entire batter so it cooks evenly and quickly. 
The cake comes out so moist itâs seems impossible. 
So because all ovens are different and mine sucks, I use a oven thermometer but like a genius I didnât put it in until I needed to put in the freshly poured pans. 
So I set the timer for 30 minutes in 2-9â round pans. 

30 minutes sufficed for my oven that said it was cooking a little hotter at 375. Cheap oven! 
I Discovered I can cool a cake quickly by placing the cake pan on top of a cast iron pot that has been turned upside down on the counter. The metal draws heat away from the cake pan relatively fast. 

This also helps to release the cake from the cake pan. It did stick the tiniest little bit if itâs not totally cool, most cakes will anyway. 

But anyway. This cake is one for the books. Itâs the most delicious chocolate cake over ever made and it only took two hours from ingredients to in my mouth as a two layer cake with white chocolate frosting. 

I wish I was

It tastes delicious,very moist, and goes really well with milk chocolate ganache, but very hard to get even and not good for layering.

Great classic chocolate cake, I upped the chocolate powder to a cup to make it a little more rich and paired it with a vanilla buttercream. It stayed moist even days after baking and I will definitely make it again. The batter will be thin but rises a lot when baking. I made it in 4 6in tins instead of 2 9in. Will make again when I'm craving chocolate cake,  may try pairing with a peanut butter buttercream next!

I made this today. I was concerned about the amount of liquid and leavening, but tried making it anyway. I followed the directions perfectly. It turned out pretty nasty. It was definitely moist, but there was way too much baking soda taste. I allowed the cake to cool completely, but when removing it from the pan, it totally fell apart. It lacked taste and the texture was too dense/gritty.

.

I followed the recipe exactly as it said and put it in perfectly prepared pans (2 9x9's, exactly as it says). I put it in the oven and 10 minutes later, the pans were overflowing! Apart from that, it's impossible to frost and if you try to, the cake falls apart. Also, the texture is just like dried out pudding! Literally the only good thing is the taste. It tastes passable, a little better than a store bought- cake. Over all, it's a 1.5 out of 10.

This is the exact recipe for Hershey's Perfectly Chocolate Cake. In which case, yes, this is the best chocolate cake I've ever had - I've been making it for years. It's wonderful with the Hershey's Perfectly Chocolate Frosting, served with vanilla ice cream.

This is the chocolate cake my Mother used to make when I was a child. She could whip it up in a few minutes. Many times my brother and I had a piece right out of the oven----no frosting. She always added the soda to the boiling water

Because this cake uses oil and boiling water is the most moist thing in the world. Sometimes after I make it my family and I will just eat the scraps, and we can never stop! It is so delicious and moist I 100% recommend it.

10/10 would make it again.  I replaced the vegetable oil with butter and half of the milk with heavy cream.   Turned out amazing.  Rich, good chocolate flavour, really moist.  Topped it with some coffee buttercream icing. Wow!

I made this cake exactly as the recipe said and it turned out amazing. Itâs moist and chocolatey but not to sweet. I did use store bought whipped frosting. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

I just made this cake and is very disappointed, the middle of the cake fell in. I would like to think it is my oven or baking powder was 2 months over date. I'm sure the mix will taste good but this was for a birthday cake so I cannot put icing on it as planned.

I've made this several times and it is truly the best chocolate cake ever!  I can't understand the complainers...seriously, how wrong did they have to get the recipe for it to not turn out?  It's so simple.  I just pulled it out of the oven and am trying to decide if I need frosting.  It's so moist, frosting isn't necessary!  (I made it in a 13x9.)
Thanks Hershey's, for this recipe!

I made it as it is. It's kind of like the density of a mud cake but not so sweet which was perfect for us. And yes u did make it again, 2 days after I made it the first time haha I liked this recipe because the ingredients are easy to find and it doesn't use coffee.

delicious cake! It is very moist and a cup of coffee instead of hot water makes it even better. very rich chocolate cake, almost like dark chocolate. very good, easy to make, and is exactly what it says it is.

I reduced the amount of sugar by 1/4. I used half applesauce and oil. I used flaxseed instead of eggs. I tasted delicious. Even my husband who is not vegan raved about it.

This recipe is great. The cake is rich and moist. I was looking for a chocolate cake recipe without coffee and buttermilk as ingredients and came across this recipe. I never leave reviews but this cake was too good not to share! I made a rich chocolate cream filling and a pour over chocolate ganache. Seriously delicious. I will not go back to my old recipe! One bowl, a hand mixer, super easy!!!!

This cake did not turnout like the pictured cake.  The texture is like more like a pudding cake.  The cake tastes pretty good but the texture just doesn't compliment the cake.

Just discovered this last night to make as a treat for work.  I'll agree with some others that its better the next day.  I used a 9x13.  I do want to try it using espresso powder and a higher quality cocoa than the standard Hershey's I originally used.  But overall this is going to become my go-to cake recipe.

This is the same recipe that's on the Hershey Cocoa can for Perfectly Chocolate Chocolate Cake.  It's my favorite cake recipe with these changes..I use melted butter instead of the oil and use fresh, piping hot coffee instead of boiling water.  Have eggs and milk at room temp and follow the mixing instructions to a Tee.  I line the bottom of my prepared cake pan with a parchment paper circle for easier removal from the pan.   The cake will be light and fluffy and perfectly moist. If you can make it a day ahead, it's even better!

Made it several times, always great, but mixing the boiled water in can be difficult & result in uneven batter. I will try pulling the batter to one side, pour the water in the bottom, push batter back on top & mixing the water from the bottom up, should avoid too much thinness on top &  too much thick on the bottom when you fill the dish. Well, it's worth a try! Remember, cooking is an art, not a science.

By FAR this is the most delicious chocolate cake I have ever tasted.  I believe this is the first chocolate cake Iâve made from scratch.  It was the perfect consistency and absolutely scrumptious!!! I used a bigger flat pan and baked it for 40 minutes (since I had no round pans).  This will not disappoint!!!

Excellent! My healthified changes are that I reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups, increased cocoa powder to 1 cup, used 1 Tbsp of canola oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. I also mixed 1 tsp expresso powder into the water at the end, and sprinkled chocolate chips on top of the batter (per request of my son) and had no issues with them burning on the pan. It turned out perfect! I baked in a 11 x 13 glass pan for about 25-30 min. Will DEFINITELY make again and this was so easy I now have no need for a cake mix!!

My husband and I donât eat carbs and sugar due to the way it affects me but I LOVE sweets! So, I altered this recipe to be 0 carb 0 sugar by replacing the following: flour with coconut flour, sugar with Splenda and milk with heavy cream. It was so delicious! This is perfect too for anyone who wants to eat something Keto friendly. I think it would be better with almond flour. Also, my oven baked it in 30 minutes. 
I look forward to having another slice tomorrow!

A close friend and I tried this recipe, and I was honestly really worried we would fail at it. We donât have any 9â round pans, so we used one bundt cake pan for around 40 minutes and it turned out great. Boiling water is optional, without water the cake turns out dense. Boiling water makes the cake fluffy. Anyways, I would recommend this recipe to anyone who needs a chocolate cake.

It was delicious and so easy to make! I cant wait to make it again!  I made it all in 1 pan and came out great it just took a little longer to cook. I was afraid it was too liquidy but it came out perfect!

This is so simple and becomes even better the next day. I increased the cocoa to a cup and added espresso powder.

This is an awesome recipe. If you want maximum chocolate flavor, this is it! I ended up frosting it with the Hershey frosting recipe on the cocoa label.

Awesome! These cakes are moist, delicious, and easy to make. They do dome up quite a quite a bit while baking, but they settle down nicely. I would definitely make this again!

We made a gluten free / dairy free version so we changed a few things.  King  Arthur measure for Measure flour.  Coconut milk  (can)
Bakewell Cream replaced the baking powder - this isn't necessary but does make things better for GF recipes.
Came out great!

this is the best chocolate cake recipe I ever made and ever tasted. I added in Hershey's cocoa. and some instant espresso. just a spoon full. someone here gave me recipe for a chocolate glaze on top. I used a vanilla bean in that with dark chocolate bark broken in pieces,  in and chocolate chip morsels minus butter cause I had none. I cant get over how delicious it is...all recipes.com,  got this recipe perfected plus the simple white cake...I made both and will never buy another cake again...simply marvelous. I am so thrilled at how great. do not put chocolate chips in the cake as they will sink to the bottom. maybe melt it with butter and then add it in? this cake is so moist...not as a layer cake, as a sheet cake with a glaze...looks made  like from a fancy shop.

Loved it! Found my chocolate frosting on this site too which Iâll add to the bottom of this review. Made 24 cupcakes and baked for 15-17 min at 350 degrees. Had some batter left over which I refrigerated and made 6 more. If you need a frosting recipe to pair this is what I used. 6tbsp butter creamed. Then mix 2 3/4 cups powdered sugar with 6 tbsp of unsweetened cocoa powder in separate bowl. Slowly add powdered sugar mix along with 5 tbsp of evaporated milk to creamed butter in a mixer. Last add and mix 1tsp of vanilla. Best easy combo of cake and chocolate frosting!

I made this cake with my daughter for a bake sale at school & it sold out in seconds! we did get to try some of the sponge that we'd shaved of & who new that adding hot water & milk would make such a huge amazing difference to the texture! so so moist & chocolaty.. we melted some marshmallows for the filling & drizzled melted chocolate over the top which would harden into a chocolate 'crust'

I love this cake! It is super moist and delicious. Once, I used it to make a chocolate strawberry cake and it collapsed so the one thing is to be careful that it is sturdy. I also made it as a bundt cake and really enjoyed it. It was great with some vanilla buttercream.

Hello! So i made this recipe into cupcakes and it was amazing. At first I was nervous about adding all of that boiled water, but when I tasted them I was in cupcake heaven. When they came out of the oven I thought j had over baked them- they were chocolate so it was hard to tell, but the surface layer had this slight crunch. But that was nothing to worry about. I recommended this to all of my friends at game night.

Oh my goodness, this is an AMAZING recipe. I made this cake for Father's Day for my husband, and  he says this is now his favorite cake. Everyone at our get together raved about it! It's so easy, and comes out so moist and chocolatey. I did add a scant cup of cocoa instead of 3/4, and it was a perfect amount, so delicious!! EXCELLENT!!!!

My wife & I made this today.  It was the best chocolate cake we have ever made.   We made the basic chocolate buttercream icing with it & it was WONDERFUL..  Rich, moist with a deep chocolate flavor.  We will make it again.

Fabulous! Moist and wonderfully chocolate, tho I will admit to increasing the cocoa to one cup. Made German chocolate frosting with a recipe also from Allrecipes...my husband's birthday -- and it was a total hit. Some friends couldn't believe I made it!  Definitely a keeper!

It tasted alright... not sure if I did something wrong but it took forever to bake and when I took it out it kinda fell apart. Iâve never added boiling water to cake mix so I wonder if that was the problem.

I had to substitute pancake syrup for vanilla extract because I was out. However my cake is very moist and delicious. All of my ingredients were off-brand.

Very light and fluffy cake, isn't super rich tasting. Easy to make and clean up, as everything is in one bowl. I baked it for 35 minutes and that turned out fine. This is not a very chocolatey cake, but it is tasty.

I made this with my 9 y.o. We added a full cup of cocoa powder and sifted the dry ingredients (our cocoa was really clumpy). We did use a hand held mixer and was a little worried but the cakes turned out AWESOME. I am super impressed. I am not a baker (I have trouble following recipes) but this is a keeper for sure.  The cakes were moist, fluffy and not so over the top sweet - which makes them a great vehicle for a frosting, topping or ice cream (or all of the above because, you know - why not?)  Will be pointing friends to this recipe for sure.

This is literally the most moist chocolate cake Iâve ever made and Iâm an amateur home baker and I bake all the time!! I made 2 minor adjustments - I used 1 cup of cocoa powder instead of 3/4 cup and I had some leftover dark chocolate chips, maybe a cups worth, and I tossed those in just because and boy, did this cake turn out delicious!! It didnât even need frosting! This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

So easy! Followed the directions exactly and baked as a 9x13 cake for 27 minutes. Perfect chocolate cake! Fluffy and moist. Be sure to mix for 2 full minutes and then add the boiling water as it says. It looks like chocolate soup but comes out just right.

Wonderful! The only thing I did was sifted all my dry ingredients & used 2 egg WHITES instead of the whole eggs bc it makes the cake super moist and sponge like.

I've been using this recipe for years now and everyone always gives me compliments. Some tricks I've tried are using coffee instead of boiling water, it doesn't taste like coffee at all (I'm not a fan of coffee myself so trust me) And the cake is plenty moist but if you sprinkle on some simple syrup it makes it extra moist and delicious in my opinion.

Made recipe for cupcakes as is, which provided just a little too much batter for 24. Added orange rind from a whole orange. Delicious and moist.

This was good as is, but I was expecting a cake with a little more intense flavor so it did not quite knock my socks off. The texture was spongy so that was nice. When I made it again, I added more cocoa (1/4 cup) and 1 cup hot coffee instead of the water and I thought that was an improvement. Overall, a solid basic recipe and I loved how few dirty dishes I had at the end.

Excellent recipe. Cake is moist and delicious. Donât know why some people have noted that it was a pudding cake, not good as a layered cake and that it wonât come out of the pan. I used the normal prepping technique, greased and floured, for my cake pans and even have used this recipe to make mini-cupcakes without liners and have never had an issue. Iâve made over 30 cakes using this recipe and they have come out perfect every time. Iâve even doubled this recipe for a 6 layer wedding cake that the guests thought was professionally done.

Fantastic chocolate cake. It is similar to store-bought cake in texture and moisture, but tastes incredible. My roommates LOVED it and were so impressed that they all asked for the recipe that I used! 

SPECIFICS FROM PREP, BAKING, AND FROSTING:

> I used store-bought chocolate and vanilla frosting. Chocolate for in between and on top of the cake. I used vanilla on the sides which complemented the chocolate flavors very nicely!
> I SUGGEST heating up your frosting. The cake is very moist and will mix in with the frosting easily, so frost lightly. 
> I heated up the chocolate frosting in the microwave for about 10 seconds and stirred it before pouring and spreading it on the top of my first layer (which was NOT flat because of the sticking).
> I tried to do thick petal frosting with the vanilla around the cake but ended up pulling on the cake (store-bought frosting is so thick and dense) so I improvised and continued the 'speckled effect' for the rest of it.
> I heated up the chocolate frosting again for the top of the cake. Poured starting from the center and spiraling out so that just a bit spilled onto the sides of the cake. 

> I used crisco to coat the rounds. The flour stuck to the inner rim, where I coated heavily with crisco (since that is where i usually have problems of sticking). That ended up not being a problem this time. There was still some flour around the rim of the cake after taking it out of the pan.
> NEXT TIME, I will coat the base of the pan more heavily

This was a refreshing change from the typical wet and dry method and IT IS a soft crumb, so after greasing it thoroughly I added parchment circles on the bottom, then added a cocoa and flour layer over the bottom and sides. Glad I did!! The sides wanted to stick even with the grease and flour, but I was able to run a knife along the edge. Still was a bit crumbly but came out easy with the parchment bottom. I do think it would have been a disaster sans this step, so baker beware! That being said this was quite a tasty cake! Thank you!

While this recipe has good reviews, the result I received was not what I expected. Eventhough I accidentally put 1 additional cup of cocoa powder, the cake was excessively moist. Too wet for my liking. It stuck to your mouth roof while chewing, like a dough. I baked for 45 minutes in 8 inch round pans and did the toothpick test. It was too sweet, so you might have to cut the sugar a little bit. And also it tasted like brownie (probably bcs of the extra 1 cup cocoa) which I don't mind, but certainly not a recipe for my chocolate cake.

I am very impressed by this recipe and have made it twice in the past week!  I used 2 tablespoons coconut milk powder mixed with one cup water to substitute for milk,   1/2 cup coconut oil, 1 cup raw cacao powder (and the rest of the listed ingredients) @ 350 degrees for 20 mins in small cake pans, everyone LOVED them! The second batch I greased my cake pans with a fair amount of coconut oil and the cakes didnât stick at all.

I just made this cake. I used buttermilk instead of milk. I frosted it with a chocolate peanut butter frosting. Wow was that great. The person I made it for said it was better than what his mother would make him. If I could give this 10 stars I would.

I made this for my brothers birthday party, they all said it was really good. Its really easy to make. It dident come out of the pan super easy, I would suggest greasing the pan with butter and lots of flour. But beside that it was really good.

We made the cake and will never make box cake again!!! We loved the dense rich flavor, and the simple instructions.  Also made cupcakes, at around 18 minutes and makes 32 instead of standard 24 box cupcakes.

I love this recipe. We sprinkled marshmallows on top while it was still warm. Then dumped a tub of chocolate frosting on top. 

I'm making it again right now for my daughter's birthday. This time i mixed marshmallows into the batter.

I made the chocolate cake all in one bowl, and it was one of the best cakes I've ever made or tasted, because it was so moist! I made it because I had a craving for chocolate, and didn't want to make a whole cake with frosting or go to the trouble of making brownies, so I cut  the recipe in half. I sprinkled confectioner's sugar on top, and, I have never made a cake that called for boiling water or water at all, but I truly believe it was the water that made this cake soooo moist! I gave a piece to my neighbor, and she thought it was delicious also. I'll use that recipe from now on.

OK, friends!  Let's address the obvious question in the room.  What would happen if you were to substitute 1 cup of strong brewed coffee for the boiling water?  A little slice of Heaven is what would happen!  I made the cake last night making that substitution and everyone kept raving about how good a cake it was.

As many an internet chef has observed, the coffee flavor really have a boast to the chocolate flavor.

I have already had three requests for copies of this recipe.

I only used 1 cup of sugar this time and it was still amazing! Next time I will try 3/4 cup. The icing I made was sweet enough.
*** If you want to make it dairy and egg free, substitute the milk for almond milk and the egg for Flax egg (1T Flaxseed meal + 2 1/2 T water. let it sit for 5 min to thicken) 
AMAZING!!!

I made this recipe exactly as written and my family loved it.  It was delicious, wasn't too dense, and wasn't crumbly.  I did add all of the boiling hot water as stated in the recipe.  It was runny but I didn't have any difficulties when filling my 2 - 9" round cake pans.  I thoroughly buttered and floured my cake pans and cooked the cakes for 30 minutes.  They came out fully cooked, with a butter knife coming out completely clean when poked in the center of the cakes.  The tops of the cakes did not sink in and remained slightly puffed on the top after sitting in the cake pan for 30 minutes to cool.  (I forgot to check on them after 10 minutes.)  The cakes came out of the pans easily.  After allowing them to cool on the racks, I put them in the fridge for 30 minutes, like I always do before frosting.  I didn't even need a crumb coat before spreading the frosting on each layer and there wasn't a single cake crumb on my knife while frosting.  I will be using this recipe again.  I used the Creamy Chocolate Frosting recipe by Tracy Larsen and left a review for it as well.

This is an really tasty cake. However, I made a few modifications. I used butter instead of vegetable oil, and I replaced the cocoa powder with 1 cup of chocolate chips. These changes added around 15 minutes longer to the bake time but it turned out very well! Iâll try this again with the original recipe!

This cake is perfect! My first chocolate cake from scratch and I loved how easy it was. To make the chocolate a little richer I used a cup of coffee in place of just boiling water, and followed the advice of others by using 1 cup of cocoa. I'll definitely use this as my go-to chocolate cake recipe!

I substituted the juice of 4 oranges and a can of coconut cream for the milk and oil. Plus I added 1/4 cup instant coffee! SPECTACULAR!

This cake tastes fantastic. It was moist with a nice texture. I would definitely make it again because it only uses one bowl which is easier both during cooking and clean up.

Best chocolate cake I have ever made plus it was so easy to make.  I have 8" cake pans so I cooked it for 30 min.  I made a chocolate ganache for the icing and added 1/4 teas of instant espresso to the icing, let it cool so it was spreadable and viola the best cake ever!  Thank you shileyo!!

This was a fantastic cake! It was perfectly moist, spongey, flavorful and had all you would expect from a chocolate cake!
 I recommend you use a 1/4 teaspoon of salt instead of a whole teaspoon.  I read other comments that said the cake stuck to the bottom so I used parchment paper and it turned out fine. I was also impressed that it took about 33 minutes to bake, only 3 minutes more than the recipe suggests. And making the cake was very fast too! Although it is a one bowl cake, I would recommend mixing the dry ingredients together first, so you don't get lumps of flour, and then adding the wet ingredients, and pre-mixing the eggs in another bowl before adding them too. Also, note that this cake rises to about more than double the amount of batter put in.
Overall this was an incredible recipe I want to make again and would recommend to anyone!

This is my familyâs favourite cake. I add 3-4 eggs, 3/4 cup salted butter to make it extra soft and do not add salt. I also keep 1 1/2 cups sugar to match our tastebud. 
There was a dessert submission in my neighboring child care centre and it was a hit!
Thanks to the creator!!

I made it exactly as per the recipe, except for using a nine inch bundt pan instead of two round ones. It came out amazing!! Not too sweet, and texture was better than store bought. I didn't get time to make the frosting, it disappeared so fast:-) will definitely be making again.

Delicious, moist, creates a very sharp cut (not crumbly like when you slice cake from store bought mixes), and popped right out of the cake pan to flip onto a plate without any hasle/breaking. I had to make half a batch, due to being short on flour. I also substituted light brown sugar for half the sugar, added a little extra cocoa (not much, but tried to match what other reviewers recommended) and poured it all into an 8" pan to cook for the minimum recommended time.

Great cake! Easy to make, moist and an all time favorite with my grandkids.  I like to put all the dry ingredients together in a zip plastic bag and have it on hand to bake in a flash. It is especially tasty with frosting made with Nutella. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it!

It's delicious, but I had the same issue as others with the cake sticking to the pan. This isn't a good choice for a layer cake if you want it to look pretty.

Following the suggestions of other reviews I used coffee instead of water, and used 1 cup of cocoa.  As a personal preference I used butter instead of oil.  I will admit, I am not a baker, and this is probably the first successful scratch cake I've ever made, so I would say this recipe is fail proof.  This cake is absolutely perfect.     It was just as easy as a cake mix, but tastes a million times better.  It's dark, rich and moist.  I frosted it with store bought frosting,  but it would have been amazing with no frosting at all.  This will be my go-to cake recipe from now on.

This is my go to chocolate cake. Itâs really chocolatey and moist. I use a whole cup of cocoa powder but thatâs the only adjustment I make and I live at a higher altitude (~6000ft.). Delicious!

Best chocolate cake I ever made!!!! The recipe was very easy to follow and I can mix the dry ingredients ahead of time if necessary. The cake was moist and soft and very delicious. I am making another one right now. No more store bought mix for me. I finally found my perfect chocolate cake recipe.

This cake is absolutely amazing. Iâve made it twice for my kids birthdays. I use real butter cream icing (the tedious kind made from egg yolks and butter) and I received so many compliments. It is my go to recipe!

I made as a sheet cake.  I also used dark chocolate cocoa.  THIS CAKE WAS YUMMY!!   One of the reviews was correct- it's even better after being overnight in the fridge.  This was my first cake made from scratch and it turned out great!

Moist and delicious! My only change was increasing to 1 cup of Cocoa Powder.  Also, this cake definitely tastes better the next day. I was actually disappointed the first day but on the second day we thought it was amazing!

Very disappointed with this recipe since it  ticks all the boxes in terms of ingredients. While it certainly is true that it is dark and moist, sadly the chocolate flavor is almost non-existent. Here's the test: If you close your eyes and eat this cake un-frosted  you'll have a very hard time deciding what the flavor actually is. The frosting is everything here, with the sponge a very unequal and unsatisfactory partner. That's not at all how a good cake should be.

I'm extremely disappointed with this cake. I followed recipe exactly as it told me to but when I baked it, I left it in the oven at least 40 min and the inside was pure liquid, not even the slightest bit baked. I needed it for the next morning, so I just improvised with what I had. Very unhappy.

Mine turned out really well!! Baked in two 9-inch round pans for about 20 minutes (my oven cooks things faster, but it was still at 350 degrees). It was moist and a great flavor that I think the salt brought out. :) pleasantly surprised.

This recipe is really awesome and simple to make. I usually make it while I'm cooking dinner as I really love a chocolate cake dessert after a delicious meal. Admittedly, the water makes it very light but also a bit tasteless so the 2nd time I made it, I used a cup of room temp butter instead of water and boy was it ever rich and creamy and delicious. 
I also use a full cup of chocolate so it has more of a fudge/pudding consistency when you do that. 
I plan on using this same recipe soon but changing it so it's a Black Forest instead. I'll report back.

This was the first time I made a cake from scratch. I didnât realize I didnât have any baking soda so I added more cocoa. The taste of this cake is better than any box cake mix.

I bake a lot and have made lots of chocolate cakes...this is one of the best and easiest cake I have ever made!! And quick too! I actually only baked it for 25 mins tho but it was still done all the way thru! I also used buttermilk just because I only have almond milk and didn't know how that would work...but super delicious!! Saving this recipe for sure!! Thanks!!

The directions were easy to follow; the cake was moist and delicious, but the recipe made more than I wanted. I had to bake it a little longer. Overall it was one of the best cakes I've ever made.

It's pretty good! I think adding a bit more cocoa powder did help the recipe a lot in my opinion. However, I think it was just missing something that could really make this recipe perfect. I don't know what, it was moist and dense but not too heavy. It was just missing something in terms of flavor, like it was mainly just a simple cocoa taste and that's it. It's a good cake, it really is! I just think it needs some more tweaking here and there.

I have made this recipe several times and I absolutely love it! It is by far the easiest chocolate cake I have ever made and I have never been disappointed. Although it is delicious with the listed 3/4 cups of cocoa, I really wanted more so I added another 1/4 cups to the ingredients. For me, it just gave this recipe a chocolate lovers' touch. This has been my go-to for a few years now. I didn't have any problems layering the cake. I just chilled, crumb coated, chilled and iced. I used a store bought Duncan Hines or Betty Crocker chocolate icing and it was a favorite with my family and friends!

It wasn't sweet enough for my kids but I loved it's dark chocolate flavor. I cooked it in a 9x13 pan for 40 minutes and served it from the pan. This is my new go-to chocolate cake recipe.

It completely failed and I followed the recipe exactly (not including cooking time because it took almost 2 hours to bake).This is the worst cake recipe I've ever followed.Do not recommend

Made just as directed - super easy. Wonderful light textured chocolate cake. I think I might add a bit more cocoa the next time around. Makes 2 6-inch cakes plus 14 cupcakes.

I would totally make it again. It got 5 stars from the pickiest of eaters to the most well travelled eaters who I made it for. Was gone within 24 hours of me frosting the cake. I put parchment on the bottom of my pans and heavily greased both, and had no problem getting the cake out of the pans.

I made it today and had a piece as soon as the icing was added.  I found it just a smidge dry but my roommates loved it.  But then again I am Super picky when it comes to my baking, and a new oven to play with doesn't help either.  I love my cakes to be Super moist and so i think the next time i will add a Dr Oetker's pudding package.  Or something like that.  I used all Organic ingredients so at least the cake is Healthy! ;)
I used the Best Chocolate Frosting--and it was really nice and easy to make--in 1 bowl also!!  :)

my family gathers every weekend. I, my brothers and my little cousins make this cake every other week. my family and I love this recipe, it is delicious but to make it better just a little better add like 1/4 cup of milk. I think you should really try this at home, it is easy and delicious.

Made the recipe as cupcakes with That's the Best Frosting I've Ever Had from the Tasty Kitchen blog.  I've made it this way multiple times to rave reviews.  My family loves putting the frosted cupcakes in the fridge and eating them cold.  So delicious!

Ok this cake is delish..I made a 2 layer cake with a cherry filling  and cream cheese frosting and it was awesome.  I made a couple of changes..added 1 1/2 teaspoons of instant coffee used 1  cup almond milk and about half cup or so of sour cream.  The cake is very moist..I may try again and add  1/4 cup of flour for a tad more structure because it is VERY fudgy  but it turned out delish.

The absolute best chocolate cake recipe you'll ever find! It's so moist and bakes beautifully in a bundt pan. I use the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe also found on allrecipes.com to glaze it while it's cooling and the combination is perfection!

This is the best homemade chocolate cake recipe I have *ever* had. But it sticks to the pan badly. It isnât the recipe though!! It is actually due to the butter that it suggests using. My grandpa has been a cake maker for years. He uses crisco and flour. It works wonders. Only change I would make next time!

My go-to chocolate cake that is always a hit! I haven't tried any chocolate cake recipes after trying this because I loved it and I got a lot of praises for it. Me and my friends thought it was moist and soft. I use it with all my fondant cakes but I try to put it in the fridge for at least 6 hours before icing it. I also used 1/4 tsp of salt instead because I want it sweet (I make icing that's not too sweet though).

Amazing recipe! Everyone thought this was store bought, it was too good! Adjustments : reduced to only one tsp of baking SODA, switched out boiling water for a cup of brewed coffee, switched out milk for buttermilk! Cut back slightly on the sugar as well. :) made a chocolate ganache out of terryâs chocolate orange and heavy cream, then blended it into a basic buttercream recipe. Wowza it was good!

I've made this cake about 10 times now.  Everyone loves it and looks forward to me bringing it to events.  Just one question, how do you prevent it from going down.  It looks awesome when I take it out of the oven but then it shrinks.  Would love to know how to prevent it.

First review:  This cake is so delicious!  A very easy and basic recipe.  I used a cake pan with the hole in the middle and it took 45 minutes....Excellent!

This cake is absolutely amazing! I have made it many times and each time I get many compliments on it. If you want to make it even moister, remove it from the oven and let it sit for about 5 to 10 minutes. Turn it out on two plates (if you are using 2 rounds) and put them both in the freezer. Freeze solid, then ice with your favorite icing. This also makes the cake very easy to ice... No little cake crumbs to mess it up. When you're ready to eat the cake, take it out of the freezer about half an hour before. As the cake thaws the moisture stays inside makes for a terrifically moist cake.

100% The most delicious cake I've ever had. 
Extremely moist and tender and fluffy. 
However I had a problem with it structurally trying to make a layered cake. The cakes seemed to stick to the already greased and floured pans and fell apart really easily. I will try this recipe again and reccomend it. How ever I will make cupcakes nextime.

This cake is delicious.  I never changed a thing.  I have been making a 'one bowl' chocolate cake for years but this one is very moist...the one cup boiling water certainly made the difference.  I will certainly make it again.

I made this as a last minute cake for my 6 year olds birthday( she had already had a grand birthday party earlier). And it was such a great success! Very moist, melt in your mouth chocolate cake. Much better than the boxed kind and great for amateur bakers like me! Very easy to put together and cleanup was a breeze and only one bowl was dirty. Would pin this as my go- to chocolate cake recipe.

I make this cake all the time and my family loves it! They request it any time they get the chance to. Also, on top of that it is so easy to prepare and cook! The recipe is delicious, the cake is rich in flavor and also very moist. My number one choice of cake so far.

I am not a huge fan of cake in general, but this cake is amazing! It is my go-to chocolate cake recipe. I use this as is and itâs great, but also have altered it. No matter what way you use this recipe it turns out very yummy! The only thing Iâd consider is if you are looking for a fluffy cake mix for cupcakes or a high rise cake this isnât it. It is a dense cake (which is why I love it). This is a keeper in my book. Thanks!

DELICIOUS! I did one mistake, I forgot to boil the water! Lol Didnât seem to matter though! It was not super runny and that must be why. I also used a bunt pan and increased the time to 45 min. This recipe is a keeper 4-sure!

Love this recipe!  The batter was thinner than expected (as mentioned in the recipe) but the cake is so moist, almost brownie like texture!  I added a few more minutes baking time.  Will definitely make it again soon!

I substituted buttermilk for the milk, and used very strong French roast coffee instead of plain water. The thinness of the batter scared me a little, but the cake came out moist, delicious and with an excellent crumb.
I left it unfrosted, and at serving time put a small puddle of homemade salted caramel sauce on the plate. Then the cake, slightly off center, then a drizzle of dark chocolate ganache, and finally a dollop of freshly whipped cream at the outer edge (I've seen too many people scrape whipped cream off a dessert wedge to put it directly on top anymore). The whole thing got rave reviews at the party. I had another cake so froze that, then brought it and leftover caramel and ganache to another party 4 days later. Wowed another small crowd. 
Yes, I'll be making this again.

this is my GO TO chocolate recipe.. 
the only thing i would change is to reduce sugar and increase the vanilla essence. i would add dried cranberries too.
i would like to ask if anyone has baked this recipe in a BUNDT pan. i tried tonight, grease it very well with shortening like Nordic ware recommend, but the bottom is still stuck.
share if you had success and how you prepare your bundt pan. :-)

This recipe was really good. I cooked it for my birthday. You can also find the recipe and frosting recipe on a Hersheyâs Unsweetened Cocoa Powder box. The cake was sweet, yummy and moist. Love it! ??

I was almost out of cocoa (oops) I had a quarter  cup of baking cocoa so I substituted an additional 1/2 cup of hot cocoa mix for the rest and reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups. The cake was good and moist but next time I might add a touch more sugar. Since we didn't have cocoa I made peanut butter frosting and added some chocolate chips between the two layers.  So good.

Deceptively Delicious. I didn't have enough coco so I melted chocolate chips down to make up the difference. needles to say it needed to be topped with something just as good so I made a chocolate ganache.

Took another reviewers advice and increased the chocolate to a full cup and never looked back.

Very easy to make, I have no idea why I have been using box mixes.  I am not going back to that.

Took 40 minutes to cook, so be a little patient.  I also let this cool almost all day before trying to remove from pan.

Iâve made this at least twenty times. Always perfect and delicious. I follow the recipe exactly and I use the stand mixer. After I add the hot water, I mix on low for 10 seconds then remove bowl and paddle and I use the paddle by hand to scrape the bowl and incorporate the batter/water throughly. I line the bottom of layer pans w parchment and spray grease the sides. After they come out of oven, I wait 10 minutes then turn the cakes over on cooling rack and cakes always come out of pans great. Ive worked in commercial kitchens for years and this is the best chocolate cake recipe Iâve used when u need a fast, good chocolate cake

Delicious cake recipe, I ate it all myself! I didn't have any cocoa powder so I used garlic powder and it gave it a funny taste but still good. I might have forgotten one of the ingredients because it came out a lot flatter than I expected. I added canned frosting and a strawberry which I recommend.

I did not like this recipe. I was way to moist, yes a moist cake is good but it was so moist is was almost soggy. In addition it would not come out of the pans even though they were well greased. And over all it just didn't taste good.

I am 10 years old and I love baking. I just made a few changes: I put only 3/4 cup of water (because it was chewy if I put 1 cup), and I put less sugar. It was fine with only 1 1/2 cups. But other than those things, this recipe was awesome!!

This cake is very very easy to make compared to others I have made. I did add one ingredient though, Professor Whizz's Chocolate bumpies to the wet mixture. YUM! The taste of the caramel and chocolate is to die for! 
As it's written, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
 Perfect.

I usually use recipes for more of a framework than actual directions, that being said I was feeling tired last night so I just followed the recipe exactly. Wow! That simple recipe had no business being that good!! Moist, fluffy, and chocolatey! Ask the things a cake should be!

This is not a good cake for show. It did taste very good, and it was very easy to make but it was wayyyyyy to crumbly and I was not able to frost it very well. And when I tried to pick it up it almost fell apart. The cake ended up looking like a pile of crumbs and was not the round shape I was going for. So I recommend this only if you do not care about the end product looking crumbly.

perfect, easy to make! I used a full cup of cocoa, and replaced the cup of milk with another cup of boiled water to keep it dairy-free and it was moist and delicious.

So tasty and easy to make! There are other reviews that say the cake doesn't come out of pan easily... This was not the case for me. Easiest recipe and by following the simple instructions everything went smoothly. Delicious and moist! Definitely my new chocolate cake favorite!

This cake was off the wall fanfreakingtastic! It was perfectly moist, so flavorful and the crumb was spot on! The only changes I made was added 1 c baking cocoa and my eggs were medium, so I had 3 eggs instead of 2. And I only ended up baking it for 27 minutes in my 9 inch pans. After having this cake I will NEVER buy boxed cake mix again. Thank you so so much for this delicious recipe. This will be my go to cake forever! (I frosted it with my buttercream frosting, which was 12 T Imperial margarine, 2 1/4 cup powdered sugar, 1/2 c baking cocoa, 1 T vanilla extract and 1/4 c milk.  I threw it all in a bowl, beat it with an electric mixer, and it filled my layers in between nicely and frosted it all around on top and the sides very generously). Oh I cannot stop raving about this cake, and my 2 girls and hubby love it too!

Made this recipe three times, twice as a layer cake with chocolate buttercream and once as cupcakes with vanilla buttercream.  It was such a hit! My kids loved it and I got so many compliments when I brought it to a party. Iâm a fairly good baker and this recipe is one I will continue to make. Super moist and so easy. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and as I said it was delicious. The second and third time I added 2 tablespoons of instant espresso powder to the boiling water, it gave the cake a bit more richness. Although it doesnât need it I will continue to add it whenever I make this recipe bc it makes it just a bit better.

This is the most moist , and easy chocolate cake Iâve ever made from scratch. I listened to the reviews and used 1 cup of cocoa and I substituted the milk for Silk Original Almond milk. It came out perfect! We were so excited to dig in we didnât even use frosting!

This is definitely a favorite for birthday cakes.  I make it the day before.  After it has cooled, I wrap each layer twice in plastic wrap and place each layer in a freezer bag.  Then I freeze it overnight before frosting it.  The cake is very moist.  By freezing it, it becomes very easy to frost without many crumbs.  I do create a crumb frosting layer before the final frosting.  A chocolate or a peanut butter frosting compliments the cake nicley.

Made this for my husband who is the chocolate cake lover in the house.  He said âitâs incredible!â  Made it as written except increased cocoa powder to 1 cup.  Thanks so much for the recipe!  Will make again!

This was a good cake, but make sure it is the type of cake you're looking for. I followed the recipe except that I upped to cocoa to 1 cup per reviews. The cake is dense and has a brownie taste. It is not light, fluffy, or crumbly.. if you're looking for traditional cake texture, keep on going! I would make this again.

wonderfully moist. only change i made after reading the reviews was to use  coffee instead of just water.

the mixture is very runny and getting it out of the pan was challenging. will double to the butter and flour i use to lining next time and take it out of the pan sooner.

By far the best chocolate cake I've ever had. Beats box cake hands down and it only takes a few minutes longer to make. I followed the suggestion to add 1 cup cocoa, cut the sugar down by 1/4 cup an added 1 tsp instant coffee to the hot water. Highly recommended!!

The texture of this chocolate cake is nothing short of heavenly, and I don't say this lightly. I have tried dozens of cake recipes over the years and have not come close to this fine of a crumb. It was not too light that it felt unsatisfying. It was velvety smooth in the mouth and was a true delight to eat.

That being said, I would have preferred for this to be richer in chocolate-yness. I did bloom the cocoa in the boiling water as suggested by some other reviewers. I might try using a richer milk next time, perhaps buttermilk. Or melted butter in place of vegetable oil.

This chocolate cake is not overpowering and has the right amount of sweetness. It only lacks depth of flavour and richness.

I have made many chocolate cake recipes in my life and this is by far the best I've made. The only changes I made were to follow other reviewers who added an extra 1/4 cup cocoa and kicking horse coffee rather than boiling water. This is my new go to cake recipe.

Very dense, rich chocolate cake. I went with some of the comments to up the cocoa to 1 cup but IMO, 3/4 cup should be sufficient unless youâre looking for a death by chocolate type cake.

Mine came out kind of dense and a little chewy. It was pretty rich. It wasnât my favorite cake recipe but it certainly was easy and called for ingredients I readily have on hand usually so I really appreciate that.

Best Chocolate Cake EVER!  I've been making this for many years and I get the best compliments every time. This cake is moist and almost fudgy and so rich in chocolate!  I make a white buttercream icing for it and it compliments the chocolate nicely.

I used 6 TBSP of Peanut butter because my son's allergic to  eggs. Came out great. If you use 1 TBSP you wont taste peanut butter at all which is great if you just want an egg substitute without  the taste!

I had my doubts when I added the boiling water, but this is the lightest, moist chocolate cake ever.  The chocolate taste is great but not overpowering.   This is my go-to chocolate cake recipe from now on.

It really was easy and very moist.   I'll definitely make again.  The only thing to be aware of for people in high altitudes, at least CHECK the cake after 20 minutes instead of the suggested 30 - 35 minutes.  I almost burnt mine but caughtit in time.

Delicious and simple!  I substituted one cup of hot espresso for the boiling water. Perfectly chocolatey and moist. Baked in the oven for 45 minutes as I made 9x13 cake. Next time I may try increasing cocoa to one cup as others have. Favorite!

This has been my go-to chocolate cake recipe for 3 years now. I have NEVER been disappointed and always receive so many compliments on it. It tastes best after the second day, after the flavour has really soaked in! It is so easy to put together and ice after. Hands down - awesome. I also make cupcakes with this recipe. I get 27-28 usually out of a full recipe size.

This cake is so light and fluffy! It is now my families go to chocolate cake/cupcake recipe. I have made it at least 4-5 times and every time it is so good. I use almond milk most of the time and there is no difference between that and regular milk ( I have used regular milk too). If you make cupcakes bake 20 minutes if you have in one pan. For two pans it's about 22-25 if not on the same rack. I noticed with 2 pans the texture was a little bit different when it was on different racks even when switching them midway.

I will definitely make this again! I'm 39 weeks pregnant and I was absolutely CRAVING chocolate cake tonight.  I had just enough cocoa powder and eggs to make this cake.  I put a scoop of ice cream over it while it was still warm and this cake did not disappoint! I didn't make any changes to the recipe. It's perfect.

This cake is wonderful! I am now using the recipe on the back of the Hershey's cocoa powder box, which is the EXACT SAME RECIPE. Use the icing recipe on the back of the cocoa box, too. It's the best EVER.  Everyone tells me how good the cake is. I wonder, can it be used for cupcakes?

This cake was easy and super quick to make, and turned out absolutely delicious. I substituted the one cup of boiling water with 1 cup of coffee and it came out rich, chocolatey, delicious. They puffed up a lot while baking and I definitely recommend letting them cool COMPLETELY before trying to take them out of the pan, as well and greasing and flouring the pans VERY thoroughly. They're pretty sturdy but still moist. I will definitely be making this again.

Okay so I made this cake and it was DELICIOUS, however I did make a few mistakes along the way. First off, I had two 8in pans instead of 9in which is what the recipe calls for, and I baked it for 30 mins. When I checked it the toothpick cane out clean but the middle was sunken in, so I ended up baking it for another 8 mins for a total of 38 mins but I didnât want it to burn so I took it out. I used a cake slicer to take the top off and even it out and the middle of each cake was a wee bit undercooked as I suspected. However I just frosted it with the chocolate icing recipe on here and it turned out really well. Upped the cocoa to 1 cup as others mentioned. Iâm still dreaming about this cake today. So good.

5 stars for this cake, based on its utter simplicity and the amazing results. And it's not greasy at all!
So, as someone else already wrote, this could be your basic chocolate cake recipe hands down: moist, dense, chocolaty, sinful and no chocolate and no butter in it. Water, and do not be afraid: it gives moistness and... it's just water!
I followed the recipe to a T, and it was great; should you be timid with the oil, you might blend it with a little yogurt/buttermilk I think (no need actually, I used strong olive oil and nobody even sniffed its flavour, but still...).
You might add chocolate chunks, or pecans, or dried cranberries or whatever takes your fancy. But keep this one!

Only tweek I did was 1 full cup of cocoa and it was very moist.  Used a 9x9 square silicone pan and it flipped out easily.  Everyone loved it.

Easy and quick recipe! The taste is also good. Just I could not find the baking soda, so it was a bit dense after baking. I don't know how to balance the baking soda with baking powder, if there is way, would be good to have it in the recipe.

Amazing...easy, moist and decadent. As others suggested I used a fill cup of cocoa powder. I hadn't realized I was out of vanilla extract so looked up substitutes and the "brandy" option sounded the best to me....it was so good!

This cake was dense and moist.  I used boiling coffee instead of water.  Otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter. I used milk chocolate frosting with chocolate jimmies on the top and sides.  This cake is great straight out of the fridge and stayed fresh for days.  Couldn't ask for a better chocolate cake.

This is very similar to the Black Magic Cake recipe.  Nonetheless, it is DIVINE!!!!!!  I did follow other instructions to increase the cocoa to 1 cup and I also used a cup of caramel coffee in place of the milk to bring out the chocolate flavor.   I cannot express enough, how delicious and rich the flavor is. I used a bundt pan and increased the cook time by 15 min.  Made a caramel sauce to drizzle on top and served with vanilla bean ice cream.   I will be making it again for a co-workers birthday next week.

Delicious , made with extra cocoa not the full cup somewhere between 3/4 and 1 cup and baked in 9x13 for 40m. Anyone having issues with it sticking to pan should spray pan with pam and dust with flour (use a cpl tbsp all purpose flour and move it all around bottom and sides of pan until completely covered. Tap on counter for help dump excess out)

Amazing.  Made it twice now and it turns out to perfection.  I use LIGHT colored 9â round pans and itâs TDF.   So many compliments I canât document them all.

I've been using this cake recipe since 2013 and for every one of my birthdays. Plan on using it for my sister's wedding soon as a four-layer. 
I use a home-measured buttercream frosting with cocoa powder for the frosting. It comes out not too sweet with the frosting under sugared as the cake makes up for it.
Love it.

Amazing  ... the recipe makes both amazing cake and muffins.  For muffins I baked for 20 minutes.   Love how moist the cake remains the following day.  I used 1 and 3/4 cups of sugar as I prefer my desert not too sweet.

I loved this cake made in a 9 x 13 pan, baked for 40 min.  With ingredients that I always have on hand in the pantry, it's so easy to whip up in minutes.  No need for nasty box mixes.

I followed followed recipe exactly and it turned out to be the most moist cake I've ever made myself. I don't think anything needs changed unless you're someone who doesn't enjoy perfect moist cake. I would definitely make this again! At first I was reluctant because of the super thin batter, but its  totally trustworthy.

This is the BEST chocolate cake i have ever had!  I made it for my neighbors birthday and everyone raved about it.  The one change I did make was adding 2 teaspoons of espresso powder to boiling water.  Gave the flavor more depth.

Great, super easy cake. The recipe is great as is, but I prefer my own tweaks: double the cocoa powder, decrease the sugar to 1.5 cups, and sub half the vanilla with peppermint. Then, as another reviewer suggested, i add small dark chocolate chips on top of the batter before putting in the oven. Turns out chocolately, not overly sweet, with a slight mint essence. I sprinkle with icing sugar to serve. Looks and tastes amazing, I've had lots of compliments.

Awesome and easy.  I've made it twice, once as an iced cake and the next time with ice cream and fudge sauce.  It was great both times!  I also upped the cocoa to 1 cup as per Ionnarafic's suggestion.

As written, I only made one change.  I added about 2 tsp cinnamon to the batter to please a client.  Then I had a huge surprise.  I live in Guatemala and often have problems finding ingredients for typical American recipes.  Yesterday, I found a box of cocoa powder that was less expensive than imported brands, made here in Central America.  Quality seems to be equal.  But on the container was this exact recipe, except calling for 1 cup of cocoa!!  Made me happy to see this.  Now I will find out if my client is as happy with this as I am.  Oh, by the way, yes, the batter is very thin.  The cake is not!!  I was worried about having chocolate soup, but the cake is dense, moist and delicious.

this was a very easy cake to make. I followed the recipe with the exception of adding more cocoa powder 1 cup instead of 3/4 cup. I added a custard filling and frosting. it was a big hit at my house and the neighbors.

This makes an absolutely perfect cake (and cupcakes)!  It's extremely versatile and can be used for kids cake or change up the frosting for something more sophisticated.  I have layered this cake and I think it layers well.  I make this for pretty much every occasion where anyone wants a chocolate cake.  Moist, fluffy, and absolutely delicious.

This was an amazing cake! I would give it 4.5 stars if I could. The only problem I had was that the cake had a little bit too much cocoa powder. A little bitter. But otherwise, the cake is amazing!

I made this as a birthday cake for a family gathering with crab cheese frosting.  It was so quick and simple to make. It turned out perfectly most and delicious.

I don't bake cakes very often and this cake was easy to make  and turned out just right.  The only change I made was to increase the cocoa to one cup as mentioned in other reviews, and used one 10x13 pan and increased the baking time to approximately 45 minutes.  It turned out perfectly moist and delicious!

I made this cake to make a layered chocolate cake with cream cheese frosting and cherries for Valentine's Day. I was in a hurry and it was very quick and easy to put together. Others had problems with the cakes coming out of the pans -- use vegetable shortening to grease the pans and then coat with flour. They came out perfectly and the cake was so moist and great flavor. Will definitely be using as a staple chocolate cake recipe.

So quick and easy to do with my small kids! It worked well having them throw in all the ingredients in one bowl. We all enjoyed it!

We had no trouble getting it out of the pans. We used Hershey chocolate icing. It was very rich, I might try less sugar next time.

I made this just now and it was amazing!!!! I loved this recipe! But when I put the cake on the wire rack, and then going back to it the cake stuck and the top came off. But this is my first time making cake in general so it is not your fault. But still, I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!

We loved this! Used 1 cup Dutch cocoa and topped with homemade chocolate buttercream frosting. The next day we divided it up into 2-person portions and froze them (so we wouldn't eat it all in one sitting!) It is deeply rich, decadent, and moist. OH my gosh. I'll be making this regularly.

Very moist, delicious cake. Really really yummy! I added 1 cup of cocoa powder as another user suggested. I used coconut milk as a substitute as I canât have cows milk. Worked great!

None of it survives long enough to take a decent photo. But seriously this is one of the best and simplest recipe Iâve tried. I also upped to one cup of cocoa powder and also added a tablespoon of instant coffee. Great flavor.

Made this for my daughter's birthday last month, and I am making it for my son's birthday today.  I made a layered cake for my daughter, and for my son I am making cupcakes.  This is the best cake!! It was absolutely delicious.  I increased the  cocoa to one cup and  subbed the veg oil for coconut oil; the only changes I made.  I think today I may sub it with melted butter instead of veg oil.

This cake is the best!  upped the cocoa to 1 cup as suggested in other reviews...turned out perfect.  Seen some that had difficulty removing the cake from the pan.  I used Crisco  and flour to coat and if you let it cool enough they come out easily after running a knife around the edge turn it upside down and gently tap it to loosen.  I also used to make cupcakes .  Makes 18 (depending on their size) and I filled to the brim. 350 for 20 mins or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.
Great recipe...will make it again!

I made this exactly as recipe says except for upping the cocoa to 1 cup as many reviews suggested. However, the cake stuck horribly to the pans. Getting it out prevented the cake to hold its shape, so the taste was good but presentation was horrible if that.  I prepared the cake pans correctly. I read some other reviews that had a similar experience but Im not sure what the reasoning is for it.  It was easy to make but I dont think I will give it a second go. Iâd rather spend a little extra time and have a better outcome. Next I will try the Black Magic cake as some reviewers suggested.

So easy to make and incredibly moist, even two days later. I followed the recommendation to use a full cup of cocoa, and I'm glad I did. This is my new go-to chocolate cake recipe. I'm done with box mixes! Also, it was delicious with homemade frosting, which I recommend.

I followed the recipe exactly as is.  I didn't change anything.   I used a bundt pan and followed the directions for using the bundt pan.  I greased and floured my pan, preheated the oven.  I found the outer layer of the cake a little crisp, but the taste was good.  The inside was tasty and not dry.  I'm not giving up on the recipe,  maybe I'll try a 9x13 next time.

Great cake as is. some folks had trouble with the cake sinking but I had no issues. I did lower the temperature to 325 because I was using dark metal pans. Other than that I made the recipe exactly as is.

Halved the recipe to make cupcakes. Also added a teaspoon of instant coffee to the boiling water. The consistency is great. I used 100% cacao powder from ghirardelli. I would use a tad bit more sugar next time.

I have been making this recipe for years! It is by far, hands down the BEST chocolate cake EVER! However, it is too moist (is that possible!) to carve, so if you need a chocolate cake for carving/decorating, this is not it.

I followed the recipe almost exactly except for I upped the cocoa powder slightly like others. The flavor of the cake is wonderful but it's almost TOO moist and would not come out of the pan in one piece.  I will definitely try this again but maybe only use half of the water and bake it in cupcake form instead.

I followed the recipe exactly and the batter was very runny. It spilled over the pan while it was cooking and afterwards wouldnât come out of the pan. It was crumbly was way too wet. Very disappointed.

I've been making this chocolate cake for over 10 years. I got it off the back of the Hershey cocoa powder can. I'm surprised to see it here being claimed as someone's own recipe. I didn't know you let people plagiarize recipes, Allrecipes. Smh

this is a great and easy recipe. I also added a whole cup of cocoa powder and put instant coffee in the boiling water. i had no issue taking the cakes out of the pans. I waited until they were completely cooled and then took a knife around the edge of the cake,  and flipped it over using a plate.

Very moist cake. Made it into a Minecraft birthday cake. It was a little hard to frost because of it being so moist, but that was probably my fault.  So much better than a store-bought cake.

Quite easy, good cake. I used a 9x13 pan, and put it in for 40 minutes and when the timer went off and I looked at it, it had the look of a cake with too much baking powder. The toothpick didn't come out clean so I left it in longer, but even then the toothpick didn't come out clean. I took it out of the oven anyway, and it seemed to be done. I don't think the toothpick test works very well for this cake. I whipped up some powdered sugar icing, it was very nice. I have no idea how you'd make a layer cake of this, I can't imagine it coming out of the pan in one piece, let alone being frosted and stacked up. Anyway, the family liked it and I'll almost certainly make it again.

This is my go-to chocolate cake recipe. I actually got it out of a Better Homes & Garden cookbook from the Sixties!!  Not too sweet and very moist.  I always add a little more chocolate than the recipe calls for.  Great with chocolate or peanut butter-chocolate frosting, or simply topped with sweetened whipped cream.

It was very moist but not a favorite with my family.  For the amount of Hershey chocolate in the cake and the icing (I used the recipe on the Hershey Unsweetened Chocolate can.), the cake didn't have much of a chocolate flavor.  We are eating it, but I don't think I will make it again.

Have been making this for years. It is on the back of the Hershey's Cocoa tin.  I do make sure it  not over baked.

I have been baking this cake for years and it is definitely my favorite chocolate cake.  I make a vanilla buttercream icing instead of chocolate icing only because I prefer it.

I have been making this cake for a few years now. I have replaced the cup of hot water with a cup of hot coffee (1 cup water and 1tsp coffee). The coffee brings out the chocolate. Makes the chocolate pop. The best chocolate cake you will ever make.

I did not make any changes, but after reading another review I may up my cocoa to 1 cup as well.  This  is the best chocolate cake I have ever made, the entire family loves it.  I have made it probably 7 to 10 times now.

Absolutely delicious! I did a pudding cream middle and a powdered sugar cocoa powder with almonds topping(tasted like an almond Joy!).  It's so moist putting frosting on it seems taboo to me.  I added just a smidge  extra cocoa powder. It can be sticky so use parchment if you care about a little pulling. Thank you so much!!

I made this cake for my family and they loved it.  I didn't cook it as a layer cake though - used a 9x13 pan and it comes out about an inch thick.  It is very very moist.  I added a cup of cocoa rather than 3/4 cup and it is super chocolaty.  My family said it's the best one I've made.

Great recipe, turned out chocolatey and EXTREMELY moist. I was a little concerned after adding the boiling water since the batter seemed kind of thin, but it turned out fantastic. Easy and I will definitely make again.

I am a busy working Mom. Came home, relied on this recipe to make my daughter's birthday cake (day of).  Total mess- stuck to the pan big time. I followed the recipe. Taste isn't all that special either. Had to lump it together- big bummer.
Save yourself the mess and the aggravation.  Follow the recipe on the back of the baking cocoa bin for Hershey's perfectly chocolate chocolate cake. It has never let me down like this did.

love this recipe. read a lot of reviews before I made it the first time. I have now made this 6 or 7 times, and it always turns out. my whole family loves it. it's not for cupcakes, it's not for springform pan or really any other pans. the only way I make it, is in a bunt pan. greased and floured. I did up the cocoa to 1 cup, reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup and used sweetened vanilla almond milk instead of milk because of lactose issues and upping the cooking time to 50 min. it always turns out. if you like heavy,  dense, moist chocolate cake, this recipe is awesome. with icing  or not. my favourite variation is  adding sour cherries to the middle of the batter,  splashing with Kirsch after baking and topping with LF whipped cream.  sort of a black forest cake.

My new "go to" chocolate cake recipe . I substituted strong, hot coffee for the boiling water, a trick I learned working in a bakery. It really brings out the richness of the chocolate. I also recommend lining the pan bottoms with parchment paper and chill well before frosting.

This cake was cute.  It was easy to make It came out perfectly.  The only problem is that I greased the pan really well, and it still stuck, and broke, but once I frosted it, nobody  noticed.

An all time family favorite..As soon as the last piece of this cake is  gone,  everyone is already asking me when I am going  to make another one ....My fiancÃ© said that he loves how dense this cake is and that it would taste just as delicious even without frosting....I usually make a peanut butter frosting for this cake......it is our favorite with the chocolate cake....I was wondering if I can use a bundt pan for this recipe? If so what temp. do I bake it at  how long do I bake it for.?

Good recipe! If you're a lazy college kid like me, you don't need both baking powder and soda. I just used soda and it was acceptable

I followed this recipe except that I substituted  1 cup of hot coffee for the 1 cup of hot water as one reviewer suggested. I am also glad that the recipe pointed out that the batter would be thin, otherwise I would have thought I had done something wrong when making it.  I got so many compliments on this cake that I will definitely make it again.

Good cake and very easy to make, but didn't love it for the following reasons: 
1) Couldn't get it out of the pan without it falling apart somewhat. The pan was well-greased and floured, and the cake had cooled. 
2) It has a strong baking soda taste. 
3) By itself, without any frosting, it was just an OK cake--nothing to write home about. Texture and taste reminds me of a cake made from a box.  With homemade chocolate buttercream frosting, it's a 3 star cake.

It was soooo simple to make. I used an oblong pan as a one layer cake. This cake was yummy!!!!! It did not need frosting. Delicious. I made it the night before my birthday party. I prefer less salt than recepie called for.

I found this cake recipe to be the best one I've found in a very long time, I did make some adjustments, I added three eggs instead of two and I also put twice the amount of cocoa powder in it, turned out perfect. Also I made my own frosting that really complimented the cake, I  used powered sugar, country crock butter, vanilla, cocoa, and cream cheese, it was awesome this frosting was just made for this cake recipe!also, I've noticed other people were searching for a good frosting recipe, iam herestelling you, this was perfect! If your going to bgo to the trouble of making a cake from scratch, don't use a canned frosting mix, make a nice homemade one, I experimented with just the homemade cocoa frosting and the cocoa cream cheese frosting, and the cream cheese in it was a perfect match! here's how I made the frosting, forgive me, I don't measure, so bear with me, I used 2 cups powered sugar, 1 cup cocoa powder, then I added about 3\4 cup butter, not real butter, then about 1\2 cup cream cheese and 1\2 tsp vanilla, blend till smooth,bit will be right consistently when blebded thoroughly

This is an excellent chocolate cake. I live in the AZ desert so I adjusted the cook time down 5 minutes because of the lower altitude. My cake was super moist & wonderfully chocolatey. One of the simplest and best chocolate cake recipes I've used.

I followed one of the reviews and used 1 cup of cocoa powder as I made a 9x13 sheet cake. It's wonderfully moist and rich. But it's so moist, that I had a hard time removing it from the pan. I think next time, I will only use 1/2 cup of boiling water instead of the full cup it calls for.

I have made this cake several times and i love it. I add coffee to the boiling water which brings out the flavor of the chocolate. i love that the chocolate flavor is subtle but still rich and genuine. Its very fluffy and moist. My family loves it so much that my brother had the audacity to eat the last piece when i made this cake for my own birthday, but....ya know... thats neither here nor there(obviously im still mad). I love to eat it with milk, its so rich.

O. M. G. Crazy delicious! I made exactly as written and would give five more stars if I could. So easy to make, though not quite as easy as a store box as one reviewer said but very well worth the smidge of extra effort. The advice I did follow was to make a day in advance -- even better several days later. Next time I'll try upping the cocoa to a full cup as some reviewers suggested to see if that makes a difference. And 28 minutes was the perfect cook time for my oven. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

This was so easy to make, and came out beautifully! I used one cup of cocoa, and about 3/4 cup of boiling water not the whole cup. Parchment paper in the bottom of the tins meant no problem getting the cakes out. A moist and delicious cake that I'll be making again.

I have made this cake according to the original recipe, and I have also made it replacing the vegetable oil  with 1/2 cup +2tbsp of melted butter and  I also sub the cup of hot water for a cup of freshly brewed coffee! This is a great recipe that I will continue to use!

Going with the suggestion of many others, I used a full cup of cocoa instead of 3/4 cup.  The batter is about the consistency of soup, but don't worry because it firms up fine.  This recipe makes about 5-1/2 cups of batter, in case you need to know.  I doubled the recipe and it was the perfect amount for an 11" x 15" sheet cake. Took about 45-50 minutes to bake.   Defintely use parchment paper - I didn't on the bottom layer, and half of the cake stayed in the pan.  Used parchment for the top layer and it came out fine.  Great flavor, very moist.  Almost too moist actually - I had a really hard time frosting this because the corners and edges kept crumbling away.

This is my go to birthday cake.  It is honestly the best chocolate cake ever!  No exaggeration.  If you want people to ask for the recipe....let on it is a family recipe that you cant share.  Have you ever seen that Arthur episode where his teacher is inviting himself over because he heard they were having cake?  That is what will happen when you serve this.  So rich and delicious.  Heavenly! For icing I use the Creamy Chocolate Frosting recipe on allrecipes that was submitted by Tracy Laren.  Together, pure sintastic delight for a chocoholic. People comment that they cant get it out of the pan.  I use 2 9 inch rounds that have a built in bar that runs around the pan to release it.  I also greased and flour the pans well.  The cake is soooo moist and delicious.  The people saying it was dry and crumbly and cracked don't know how to bake.  There is NO way this cake is dry or crumbly.  I use light spelt flour and grapeseed oil.  All my ingredients are organic. Also use a quality cocoa like Camino not the cheap run of the mill .   It is to die for.  It does make too much batter for the 2 9 inch pans so don't use it all or it will overflow.  I just end up eating the remaining batter (and loving it).

FABULOUS! I followed the recipe just as written. This turned out so moist, chocolatey and delicious! I frosted it with a single batch of 'Creamy Chocolate Frosting' on AllRecipes and they paired wonderfully together to create a little chocolate heaven for me! I frosted the cake while just a tad warm to melt the frosting between the layers for some extra moistness! This will be my go-to chocolate cake recipe now!

I made this as cupcakes and it worked well. I added a well rounded tsp  of cherry pie filling in each cupcake before I baked it. Then topped with whipped cream and shaved dark chocolate sprinkles on top. The husband says they are like a Black Forest cupcake.

The taste was amazing, but do not use this recipe to make cupcakes, the middles will sink down to the bottom, I don't know how it turns out as a cake, but it didn't work well for cupcakes

Easy to make and oh do delicious. the cake is moist but not so much that it's mushy. Considering how wet the batter is I was amazed at how well it came out. This will be my new go to chocolate cake.

Review
One Bowl Chocolate Cake III
Lindsay King
 One Bowl Chocolate Cake III from AllRecipies.com is a light, chocolatey cake that is almost as simple as a box mix, and just as good, if not better.
	I first made this cake awhile ago for a friendâs birthday and have made it for every birthday and holiday since. It feeds only around twelve to fifteen people, because everyone wants second servings! Iâve made it at least five times.
	The cake has the perfect amount of chocolate, and itâs not dense at all, despite what the batter looks like. Itâs also not too dry or moist, either. As Brenda G put it: âThe greatest thing about this cake is how moist it isâ¦ not just fresh-baked, but even a few days later.â  I found out it rises and comes out of the pan perfectly, and has an excellent chocolatey flavor,  probably because it uses Â¾ cup of cocoa powder. Lots of people said to add 1 cup of cocoa powder and some espresso powder or instant coffee, so Iâll have to give that a shot the next time I make it. I sift the cocoa powder to get out any lumps, otherwise Iâll get a huge lump of cocoa right in the middle of an otherwise sensational cake. The consistency and color of the batter reminds me of rainy days when I was younger, making mud cakes in dog bowls with my baby brother, except this one comes out as a fluffy, delicate cake as opposed to the round bricks we would get after a hot, dry day. The batter is super runny! I am glad they included it at the top of the page, otherwise I probabl

At first I thought the boiling water was a weird ingredient, then the batter was a little liquidity. But it turned out to be an amazing, moist, and fluffy cake! And the water didn't effect the taste one bit! My family loved it, I loved it, this recipe is a keeper! You will love it!

Moist, chocolatey and absolutely delicious!!!! I wish there was an equally good frosting recipe to go with it.
To those that had trouble getting the cake out of the pan, I used a generous amount of baking spray and they did not stick at all.

This was a yummy cake, and it worked as a layer cake.  It sagged slightly in the middle, but tasted wonderfully moist.  I followed the recipe exactly, and served it with whipped cream frosting and sliced strawberries.  My two guys both had second helpings.  Will definitely make it again.

This is and has been my "go to" cake for years, it is so easy to whip up on quick notice and is deliciously moist, all this cake needs is a sprinkling of powdered sugar, but if I'm expecting guests, I will warm up 1/2 can chocolate fudge frosting and pour over the top, then I melt 1/2 can of vanilla frosting and drizzle over the chocolate frosting, first one in a diagonal pattern then do the same in the opposite direction to make a diamond pattern. This cake is excellent as is, but one change I do make is instead of 1 cup of boiling water, I use one cup of boiling coffee, it seems to enhance the chocolate powder in the cake and gives a delicious moist flavor, but you really cannot taster the coffee in it, just a rich, moist, chocolaty and delicious cake. I would give this cake 10 stars if I could!!

There's no need to buy a cake mix when you can find an easy and tasty recipe like this.  I added a little espresso powder to the boiled water to enhance the chocolate flavor.

If you love chocolate, this is the recipe for you! Be sure to mix everything well, especially after adding the bouling water. I used a spatula to make sure the batter at the bottom of the bowl was blended well with the rest. Made a big difference in the consistency and wasn't nearly as runny as some reviewers suggested. It's very important to let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes after baking! I made  this cake the day before my daughter's birthday and topped it with chocolate frosting, strawberries and blueberries. My grandson already requested it for his birthday next month!

Great recipe - eve though I had to make several substitutions (turbinado sugar for  white sugar, hot chocolate powder for unsweetened cocoa powder and triple quantity baking powder for baking soda) and ended up making half the amount in mini muffin cups, it still turned out wonderfully and came out of the pan moist but not crumbly

Made this for my brother's confirmation, I used two 8x8 square pans instead of two 9in circular ones, but they cooked perfectly and there was no problem. I was able to start cooking at a quarter after nine and leave the house at 10:10, with both cakes done and baked. 
Texture was spongy and not dry, and also cooked pretty flat

This is my favorite chocolate cake recipe. I follow it exactly, except for upping the cocoa to 1 cup & using hot coffee instead of plain boiling water. It tastes so good, with deep flavors, very rich & moist.

I have made this cake quite a few times for my kids' birthday's. Everyone loves it! This is my go to birthday cake. I upped the cocoa a tad and brought down the sugar a little and I didn't notice any difference in taste.

Best chocolate cake recipe I've ever found. 
Insanely good.
I used coffee instead of water, and made cupcakes  (makes almost 2 dozen!) which I baked for about 20 minutes. 
Will seem watery once all the milk and water (or coffee) goes in, but trust it the way it is, it will turn out fantastic.

Delicious moist chocolate cake.  I used what the recipe called for in cocoa powder and I found it was perfect that way.  I was just a little short of milk so I added 1 oz of coconut milk and it turned out just fine.  As everyone states it is a very runny batter.

The cocoa powder used is very important- crack open a fresh packet and add in 1 cup instead of 3/4! Also, add some coffee powder into the mixture (about 2-3 sachets) for an added kick to enhance the flavour of the chocolate in the recipe!

I consider this to be the perfect chocolate cake.  Not too dense nor too light, and perfectly moist.  I used 1 cup of hot coffee instead of the boiling water and was very pleased with the result- you don't taste the coffee at all, but it gives it a beautiful saturated dark color and rich chocolate flavor. I used regular cocoa powder in the cake, and a dark cocoa powder in the frosting, creating a deep fudgy color.  I did not split the layers as suggested, I just frosted then stacked them and then frosted the whole cake, which left me with some frosting left over (which my husband and daughter were happy to finish off).  Bakes up 2 thick layers- next time I may try using 3 round pans to make a triple layer cake and use up all the frosting.  I will bake this cake again.  Very happy with the delicious results.

I usually make a chocolate cake that requires sour cream or buttermilk for the recipe, but I didn't have any on hand so I tried this one instead. I thought it was VERY good! It was super easy and very moist. I used Baker's Joy to spray the pans and had no trouble with the layers coming out intact. My cakes were done at 6 minutes less than the recipe called for, so it is probably a good idea to check them early.  Also, the only thing I changed was adding  one cup of coffee (I placed it after brewing in a sauce pan and heated to just boiling) instead of the boiling water. I read somewhere it complements the chocolate, as well as balances the sweetness a bit. After cooling, I frosted the cake with super easy 7-minute frosting. The darkness of the cake and the shiny white of the frosting made it a very pretty cake. I will definitely make this recipe again and share it with my mom.

I have made this cake at least a half dozen times and it has always turned out great.  It rises a lot and the density is just right.  I usually use only half the amount of sugar, but everything else is followed as written.  I will never buy a boxed chocolate cake mix again!  I may try to do this without the cocoa sometime to make a "white" cake and see if that turns out okay.

Super easy cake to make . Stays moist. I cut the hot water to 3/4 cup and upped the cocoa to a cup. When finished I melted a can of frosting and poured it over the top. Made this the day before and it was so moist and had tons of compliments. People wanted to know where I bought the mix. I will never buy another boxed cake.

WOW!!! So much better than the box mixes I usually get, and I can make it whenever I want with ingredients I usually have on hand :) I followed the recipe pretty much to the tee, with the exception of how much sugar and cocoa powder I used - I only had 1 3/4 cups of brown sugar left, and I upped the cocoa powder to 1 cup. I also used 1 cup of black coffee instead of plain water. It came out perfectly moist, and it held up really nicely; I've found that with box mixes, when you eat it the same night you bake it, it's really soft and crumbly.  Not with this recipe! I used a canned frosting, but will try it with a homemade cream cheese frosting next time. Thanks so much for posting this recipe! It will be my go-to cake recipe from now on!

I have made this - from the Hershey's website! It is the recipe on the back of the Hershey's cocoa powder can. It is delicious. It is easy. It is Hershey's tried and true. Every time I make it, people rave. It is a VERY chocolatey-tasting cake. I find it a little overwhelming to make more than every once in a while.  https://www.hersheys.com/kitchens/en_us/recipes/hersheys-perfectly-chocolate-chocolate-cake.html

Very light, moist, and chocolaty!  I love how quick the recipe was to put together.  My only complaint was that, even though I properly greased and floured the pan, it didn't come out properly.  I'm glad I used a springform pan, so I just ran a knife around the sides and let the cake sit on the pan bottom.  I halved the recipe for a single-layer 9-inch round cake, since I was only making it for 4 people.

Seriously easy cake to make!  I did a 9 x 13 pan and baked for 40 minutes. I also used one cup of cocoa. My kids love this with just a scoop of ice cream or whip cream. It's in the oven in 10 minutes with easy on hand ingredients. Thanks.

I made this twice. Followed exact directions. Both times the middle sank and while pan was prepped, stuck to the sides. 1st time was almost like a brownie, 2nd time did not hold together well, fell apart when trying to take out of pan. The flavor was good both times and I made a scratch peanut butter frosting. Not sure if higher altitude has much to do with it but even with soda, powder and salt, did not create good form.

This recipe it quite good. I used it for cupcakes and they came out moist and flavorful, baked for 20 mins on 350. I've made them twice, the second time using strong coffee in place of the boiling water . The coffee makes the recipe outstanding although it's good both ways.

This cake was very easy to make,  but like many others I had a real problem getting it out of the pans. Even though I waited the suggested 10 minutes and had greased &  floured the pans, the cake still fell apart. This wasn't good since I was trying to make it for a birthday! Next time I think I'll make it in a 9x13 pan and not try to remove it before frosting & serving.  The taste however was very good.

I baked this as a 2 layer cake. The middle of the cake would not rise. I even used fresh ingredients, flour, baking powder, baking soda, etc.  I ended up baking it for 45 minutes instead of the 35 minutes. Had difficulty taking it out of the pans. I salvaged what I could, told my husband to put ice cream on it and eat! I would not recommend this recipe at all.

Made this cake perfectly according to recipe and it was horrible. It looked like tar after 40 minutes of baking, was still wet and it tasted terrible. Worst thing ever baked.

I have a gluten sensitivity so I can't eat regular cake mix. I made this with unbleached flour and it turned out really good. Gluten free flour is awful to bake with, but unbleached doesn't bother me like regular flour does. So I can eat with with no worries. Tastes great!

This is by far the most moist cake you will ever make. I changed mine a bit by adding on cup of boiled cherry jam i made last summer. The jam is way to runny to be jam and i need to use it up. It was so so so good as an addition.  I too used a 9x13.

This cake was very easy. I followed others' advice and changed two things. (1) I increased the cocoa powder from 3/4 to 1 cup, and (2) I used 1 cup hot coffee (decaf) instead of boiling water. The texture of the cake was great, but the flavor was a little heavy & not very sweet. I'm sure that's because of the coffee. If I make it again, I will either try it with water, or mix some extra sugar in with the coffee before adding it. I ended up making peanut butter frosting to help sweeten it, and the combo was delicious.

I don't write many reviews but this came was amazing!! Batter will be thin but that's how chocolate cake is. I made 1 1/2 this recipe to fill 4 6in pans. Delicious day one and still delicious after being in the fridge covered for a couple days. Very moist. I upped the cocoa a little bit. Also was nearly out of vegetable oil so I used about 1/4 vegetable oil and 3/4 melted butter

Nice, easy, quick cake. Very moist. My only complaint is that I'd like it to be more chocolaty, but everyone else in my family thought it was perfect.

I LOVED this cake, as did my company, who eat through most of it immediately after frosting it.    The only change I made was using Hershey's special dark cocoa powder (what I had on hand.)   I frosted it with an intriguing 2 ingredient chocolate frosting (2 cups ch. chips and a pound of butter, melted, refrigerated until firm and whipped with a mixer), so good.  However, I think the cake is great on it's own, moist and not real dense so next time I think it would be  fantastic with just whipped cream and berries.   

Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

Made this in two 9" rounds. It was a little weird that the batter was as runny as it was but I expected that since it was mentioned in the recipe. The BEST chocolate cake I think I have ever made!!! Moist, not too dense, absolute perfection! Frosted it with the Creamy Chocolate Frosting recipe I also found on this site, which I doubled, I think they were made for each other! I sliced off a quarter and left it in the in-laws kitchen as a surprise, got a call later that night and my father in law almost ate himself sick on it but he didn't want to stop eating cause it was so good. I think my hubby demolished another whole quarter by himself. Once again, the BEST chocolate cake recipe I have came across in awhile. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Awesome moist chocolate cake! I took the advice of many others and replace the 1 cup of boiling water with 1 cup of boiling coffee (i just put aside a cup from my morning brew).  I always use condensed milk instead of "milk" because I don't drink milk and keep condensed milk on hand for baking.  Cake is delicious. I don't find it as liquidity as everyone reports and it's cooked perfectly every time.

Absolutely amazing.  The ONLY modification I made based on other reviews was increased the Cocoa to 1 cup.   Moist, chocolatey, not too sweet, and did I say moist?  Very simple recipe, definitely a keeper!

I followed the recipe except I used 1 cup of cocoa and a tsp of instant coffee granules in the boiling water before pouring into the rest of the batter. I also used a 9x13 and baked for about 45-48 minutes. It was the most flavorful, moist chocolate cake I have EVER had!! I made sure to spray the pan well with olive oil cooking spray and I used a glass pan. Every homemade chocolate cake I have had has never had enough chocolate flavor, but this recipe and the small changes made this cake so incredible!! We enjoyed it without any frosting. (The edges are slightly less moist but the rest is perfection)

I didnt change a thing in this recipe. It is so moist and easy. Putting it all in one bowl made me skeptical for sure. I was really skeptical when i saw the runny batter. But as it baked i could see it baking normally. I used a 9x13 pan.  It came it of the pan so easily. I dont know why another baker said it came out in chunks. I used the old method of greasing and flouring the pan and each piece came out beautifully. My husband loved it. Birthdays will have a new cake. It almost has a fudge flavor. Yum.

This is the BEST chocolate cake recipe ever! My mother is a pastry chef and she loves it. Super easy compared to other recipes. Whips up in no time. Up cocoa to 1 cup for a better flavor. Super moist. Batter is very liquidy but puffs up nicely. If making for layering, it's good to make a day or two ahead and keep it in the fridge to stiffen a little as it is very moist. Don't worry though, it is is still very moist and flavor actually gets better. Whenever my husband has any work birthdays or events, everybody asks if making this cake. 10 stars!!

This is easy to make and tastes pretty good. It's a little on the chewy side, so maybe it would be better with cake flour. I also would have liked it to be more chocolatey. It was so simple, though, that I'm sure I'll make this again.

Needed a marble cake for a Quinceanera, so I poured this chocolate recipe over my butter recipe swirled and baked at 350* for 45 minutes. Looks amazing! (I made 2x 14"rounds)  Had a little batter left over so I made a small cake, tastes as good as it looks!

This was very easy to make and moist (but not as moist as expected after reading the reviews). This is the first cake my 9-year old and I made together and it was so fun. I made as is, no changes.  The only thing I forgot to do was prep the pans properly to ensure that the cake came out easily.   We made as a birthday cake and it was a hit.

Fantastic! I wanted to make a chocolate cake for my kid. I wanted unbleached flour and unrefined sugar. This turned out perfectly, tastes better than the boxed stuff.

I love this recipe! It was delicious and easy. My friends couldn't stop raving. I used a 9x13 pan and baked for 35 / 40 minutes. I sprayed the pan and put a liner in. I used 1 C of cocoa powder and I used instant coffee in the hot water that is added in the very end right before pouring it into the pan. I am definitely using this for all future birthday cakes!

This cake has 2225 4.5 star reviews so how could it go wrong? 
It did though.  I made the cake in a 9 X 11 pan and when I took it out of the oven it looked like cake around the edges and a funky hybrid in the center--like certain ingredients settled in the middle during baking.  I did cook it long enough (40 minutes, plus an extra 5 mins to compensate for the stoneware)).  The only thing I can think of that went wrong is using the mixer to incorporate the hot water at the end instead of my spatula.  I can't help but think if this recipe wasn't so soupy anyway the cake would have been more stable.

Quick, easy, moist, and delicious! So far, I've just tasted the  crumbs and my mouth is so very happy! 

I baked this in a tube pan for 50 minutes. It came out perfectly, with one tiny spot of cake stuck in the pan after cooling about 30 minutes. I'm so glad, because I got to taste the cake right away. I wouldn't change a thing!

Update: I've now made this cake a half dozen times. Excellent layer cake (no doming), and great in a tube pan for 45 minutes. Still no need to change anything!

I followed the directions exactly and found that at 30 mins the cake wasn't done closer to 38 mins in my  oven. It came out very dry might try it again, disappointed with the results. Robin

I made for my sons birthday. Rather than a delicious light chocolate cake I was expecting, I ended up with a heavy brownie like "cake". It tasked okay but it was far to heavy. Absolutely wouldn't make this cake again. It was terrible.

It may have been easy to make, but I have several complaints: 

-The bake time took much longer than stated
-The cake was extremely crumbly/messy to work with while removing from the pans and frosting, final product didn't look great. 
-Even though I'm a chocolate lover, it was just too fudgy for my taste and others didn't seem to like it either. It didn't seem like a real cake, somehow.

I followed all directions exactly as stated and I am not a novice baker (not an expert either though). 
It may be easy to make but there are much better recipes on this site.

It was super tasty! I made three cakes instead of two so I I made 1 1/2 of this recipe and still was great. However, I don't know how big the mixer you use is because mine was a bit too small for three cakes. I ended up with some spills but it was totally worth it

It was a delicious cake, very moist. I would definitely make it again. I spread a thin layer of the allrecipes chocolate buttercream in between the layers and all around the cake and it was perfect. I baked for just a few minutes less than the recipe says, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

Made this cake to night for my son's birthday. It was pretty good. The only change I made was up the cocoa to 1 cup vs 3/4 as in the recipe. In the future, I may dial back the sugar. It's not a big deal but I am slightly "sugar sensitive" than most probably.

Incredibly moist, fluffy and rich. Tastes amazing. I upped the cocoa to 1 cup as per some reviewers and it turned out great. I used dutch processed (dark) cocoa, and it was a lot richer in flavour. Definitely one of my favourites.

I made this cake with two changes:  Used 1  cup of (sifted) cocoa as suggested by several reviewers and used 1/2 cup hot water and 1/2 cup black coffee (instead of the 1 cup of hot water).  I then frosted with a cream cheese frosting.  It is a solid, deeply-flavored cake.  Yum!

This is such an easy cake to make. I have limited mobility at times and sometimes baking just isn't possible. Especially with clean up. This makes it so easy since it's all in one bowl. I did add instant coffee to the boiling water. I used about 2 heaping coffee spoons and another half. It makes the cake taste so good. Really brings out the chocolate flavor. Making this for Christmas tomorrow.

This cake was awesome! My family just couldn't get enough. This will definitely be my go to recipe for Christmas dessert. The only thing I did differently was increase the cocoa powder to 1 cup plus 2 Tbs...chocolatey goodness.

This is the exact chocolate cake recipe I was looking for... Finally I found one I love! I think the type of cocoa powder being used might make a difference. I used the Ghirardelli unsweetened cocoa powder and my cake was amazing! I followed the recipe as written, and my cake turned out great!

Have made this recipe many times and usually sub decaf coffee for the water as this brings out the chocolate flavor.BTW you can not taste the coffee. And yes this is the recipe on the back of the Hershey's Cocoa box. But who cares. Not me.

Tasted Great! But not sturdy. I really struggled with it. I made it 3 different ways. The first just as chocolate muffins with choc chips was the best! Its now my go to choc muffin recipe. But as a cake not so well. In a square pan it just sticks and breaks up. The only way I managed to get it to mostly get it to keep its shape was being super careful and gentle while using a round springform pan. Just too finicky and difficult. And it sinks in the middle. Save yourself the hassle and dont bother trying this as a cake but do get all the joy of this recipe by making them as muffins with a few choc chips sprinkled on top. Yum

This cake turned out great.  I used the 1 cup cocoa, and I used 1/2 stick butter instead of oil.  (softened)  I will make this cake again.  I didn't used the frosting recipe, I used the one that another person included in their comment, similar to one I have.  This was a 2 layer cake, no problems.  So I made this a second time and made cupcakes, and used the oil.  big mistake , they all fell.  Guess I will be making some cake balls.  :)

I've made this cake twice now and both times I've used a 13x9 pan and I've been out of vanilla extract so I used a pancake syrup substitute and I loved it! I love love love this cake! I plan on making it many many more times! I pair it with this  frosting recipe and it's excellent!

Delicious!! Such a quick, easy and yummy chocolate cake recipe. Even the hubby, the non-chocolate fan, was having seconds. Made the quick frosting recipe featured in one of the comments, it was sooooo good and easy. This is definitely my new go to chocolate cake and frosting recipe. Thank you!!

Made it. Loved it! Easy and better than boxed. Rave reviews over Thanksgiving. Did not get the pudding effect. However, it layered, but was uneven - the batter was not level in the pans, unfortunately.  Note: I used brewed coffee; HOWEVER, as the cake will continue to settle into a luscious chocolatey taste over the following day, it is best not to use too much coffee. The brew will come through and remind you of a rum cake aftertaste. Not what I was going for, but it gave me ideas for other cakes! OH - cut out a circle of parchment for the cake pan bottoms & lightly oil and dust the sides. Will come right out, with the paper peeling off by sliding a plastic knife between the paper and cake -  after cooling for 10-15 minutes.

This is what most people want when they are craving chocolate cake. This recipe also appeared in a Pillsbury "Bake Sale" cookbook about 15-20 years ago, and I make it all the time.  To make it even better, use very strong brewed coffee, or add a tablespoon of instant coffee to the hot water. Adds that nice slightly bitter edge to the chocolate.

We have made this cake several times as written.  This is the most moist cake ever!  The flavor is phenomenal!  It is so easy to make that my nine year old daughter makes it by here's with adult supervision only.  She just made one for Thanksgiving.  We do make a 9x13 and bake in glass pan at 325 for 45 minutes.  No other changes. Perfect as written!

I made this as my first homemade cake, it was really good. The whole family loved it. I was worried at the beginning that the batter was way to thin after adding the cup of boiling water but when it was done it was cooked perfectly. It was moist and delicious!

Great recipe. Choc fudge cake style sponge. Daughter said it was the best cake she has tasted. Thank you   Saved for the future. So quick and easy to make. I just googled butter cream filling but I think in future I'll use Nutella / choc spread like some others have said.

Simply delicious cake! Made this in a round cake pan and it turned out superb for my husbands birthday. I topped it with a plain buttercream frosting and it was an absolute hit at the birthday party. It was nice and moist and complimented the frosting well. I did need to cook it longer than 35 minutes but that's okay!

I love this cake! This has been my go to recipe for chocolate cake for years! I have it in the oven right now even for my sister in laws birthday today! Instead if adding boiling water, though, I now substitute it with a cup of fresh hot coffee. I have a kurig and so I can play with the flavors a little! This time I used a vanilla cream puff coffee and the batter tastes amazing! I can't wait for the cake to come out of the oven!

The Best Chocolate Cake recipe ever! I upped the cocoa to 1 cup as I read from the reviews. And I also add 1 cup fresh brewed coffee instead of boiling water. For the frosting I made vanilla cream cheese frosting. I baked after dinner last night and this evening already gone! My husband and daughters really love this cake. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very easy cake to make; even this "non baker" made an amazingly moist, tasty cake!  I followed the recipe to the letter, with the exception that I used just one pan (a 10" springform), which meant I had to up the bake time to about 40 - 45 minutes.  The batter is very runny, as other reviewers have noted.  Do not be alarmed!  It will still turn out just fine.  I did need to put a cookie sheet on the rack below the cake, as my springform pan allowed some of the runny batter to seep through and start to burn in the oven.
To finish the cake, I took frozen, thawed raspberries, which I smashed and spread along the top of the cake, then frosted with chocolate ganache. To make the ganache, I heat a small saucepan full of heavy cream, about one cup's worth.  I then pour the heated cream over about 1/2 bag of semi-sweet Ghirardelli chocolate chips.  You stir the cream into the chips as they melt.  Once it is glossy and melty, you pour the chocolate ganache mixture onto the cake and carefully frost.

Great and easy recipe! Everyone loves it. The cake was baked for around 40 minutes and I had also decreased the amount of sugar.

I took one star off because there is an important detail that is described differently in the video compared to the written recipe. The written recipe says to simply stir the boiling water into the cake batter, while the video tells you to mix (with a beater)  boiling water slowly into the batter till it thickens. I did this cake twice and if you go by the written version, you will get really irritated by how many times you test the cake till it smells like it may be burning. If you're doing this cake for the first time, or relearning it GO WITH THE VIDEO!!

Easy to make and delicious. Adding cocoa powder and cut sugar qty are good decision though.  I make chocolate birthday cake for my niece and she's enjoyed it verry much. Thank u for the recipe. The best chocolate cake recipe ever.

Great recipe. I have made this several times. It's great warm out of the oven and cool and frosted. I usually follow the recipe exactly and it's great. Most recently I followed the advice of some other reviews and used 1 cup of cocoa powder and 1/2 a cup boiling water and 1/2 a cup boiling coffee and it was really good too. I let tha cake cool completely and it held up nicely to being frosted and decorated with fondant.  Will be using this recipe whenever I need a chocolate cake.

I made this cake and believe it is more suited to a chocolate pudding style - it doesn't stack well for a sponge style and needs to be a bit firmer! As I place cherries in between the layers the chocolate icing I made was from 1 x 250 cream cheese, 1tsp vanilla essence, 60grm softened butter, couple of tablespoons of cherry juice and icing sugar!!!

I have made this twice. It is beyond simple and the result is moist and not too sweet. I have gotten rave reviews from anyone who has tried it. I baked it 40 minutes and have followed the directions exactly as written.

Hint,  If you want to bake this as a layer cake, let the cake cool completely  on wire racks.  Wrap in plastic wrap and freeze for a few hours.  Frost while layers are still frozen.  Totally delicious.

I made this recipe with my 7 year old. Great easy recipe for kids. Loved that it used common ingredients always in my cupboard. I halved the recipe to make a single layer cake. Took 1 hour to cook in my oven before the skewer came out clean, but I think that's just my oven. Was delicious, moist & not too sweet. I increased the cocoa as suggested in another review.
I tried this the second time in my magimix.

YUM! Made this cake for my father-in-law's birthday and everyone raved about it. So moist and rich - WAY better than a box mix! I made it with the "creamy chocolate frosting" recipe on this site. This will definitely be my go-to chocolate cake recipe!

It was really easy and fun to make and best of all it was delicious!! I wouldn't really change anything about the recipe, except maybe if they could give us a frosting recipe to go with the cake. But overall it was a great experience making this cake. I've made it around 4-5 times and I'm in love with it!

This is my NEW GO TO recipe for chocolate cake!!!  Literally the only thing I changed was added 1/4c more of cocoa. I made this twice. The first time I made changes based on other recipes I have changed and it was a no go. Last night I made it with only my minor change and it was the most light, airy, rich flavored chocolate cake I've ever made!!!   Like other bakers I was glad people stated the batter would be runny because I was shaking my head like man I gotta go back to my old recipe. Give it a try you won't be disappointed!!

This cake tastes good, and it is moist (maybe even more so the next day!). However, I didn't think it was anything special, and I agree with SunnySmile--it does not come out of the cake very well! If you plan to remove it from the pan and have it look good, at least use parchment paper, though you'd probably be better off with another recipe.

Nice fluffy rich cake!  I used half plain yogurt and half water instead of  milk.  It was nice and moist, but the middle sagged.

I have made this cake many many times. It is utterly delicious, however  i find that it always collapses. i have done everything to prevent this--not mixing as much, mixing by hand, using a rubber spatula instead of a whisk, adding liquids all at once, adding liquids in increments...but 60% of the time i have to make it twice because the first time it collapses into itself.  
To those struggling with sticking, this recipe basically requires you use a parchment circle in the bottom of your pan. I've tried butter and just using a spray, and even flouring the pan isn't enough. 
This is not to deter anyone from making it!! This is a great recipe! It can just be a pain sometimes.

My family loved this cake so much that we made one for a special birthday, ate it, and made another the next day!  It's easy, moist, fast, and utterly delicious!  I love recipes that are quick but have a big flavor pay-off, and this one  won't create a mess of your kitchen; this one met all of my requirements!

I made it in two rounds and halfway through cooking smelled burning. Both started overflowing. I had to turn the oven off in fear of starting a fire and couldn't even finish baking what was left! So disappointed. Followed original recipe exactly.

Wonderful moist chocolatey cake. Made as directions stated with no changes. Not sure how it could get better, but will do some of the substitutions reviewers suggested and see what happens. If you have a mixer and these ingredients, honestly it's so much better than a box mix. It is very thin and runny, but will come out great!  Baked in 9 X 13 greased pan for 35 minutes. Was a little rough getting out of the pan when serving. Next time I'll grease AND flour pan and see. Now I have to work on a great frosting. One I used on this site didn't much care for. Cake definitely better the next day!

Made cake per recipe. Except I used 8" cake pans and a circle of parchment paper on the bottoms of pans. And yup-- the batter is runny. And the cake did fall a bit in the middle. Now!!! The taste was fantabulous! Very moist and somewhat dense. Perfect for my grandson's 9th birthday celebration.

This my first chocolate cake from scratch ever, And this is amazing! I searched on the Internet for an hour for a simple chocolate cake recipe and this one seemed the easiest & I had all of the ingredients on hand. I did as another reviewer said, I used a 13x9 inch pan and baked for 40 minutes. It came out moist, chocolatey and rich. I also upped the cocoa powder to 1 cup. Definitely sweet enough. Yummy chocolatey goodness. I topped it off with homemade chocolate frosting (also a recipe from the site) and it was so great. I dusted a little powdered sugar on top and done! My boyfriend is a big chocolate cake fan so we will see how he likes it.. Hehe.

Made half the quantity in a 6x9 pan...it was amazingly moist and airy!! I felt that the vanilla was a little intense and would probably half the quantity next time, but thats a personal preference. Bottom line: I found my favourite go-to chocolate cake recipe for all time!

With five minutes left, I smelled something burning. I opened the oven to find chocolate soup running over the pan and all over my oven.  I tasted it to see if it might be worth trying to bake in smaller pans, but it was not.

This cake is 100% top notch perfect amazing. The positive adjectives aren't enough. YOU NEED TO EAT THIS! I switched the cocoa powder for DARK cocoa powder and OMG! If you like the richness of dark chocolate, you will LOVE the substitute. This cake is so moist and perfect. I dont like cake that much, so I get really excited about it. 

Protip - make this with a nutella filling and it's even better!

Best chocolate cake recipe I've found.  Would definatly make again.  I went with 1c cocoa powder instead of the suggested 3/4c.  Make sure you grease and flour your pan well.  Mine wasn't and it busted on me when I took it out.

Perfection!!  Made as directed and put it in a 9x13 pan, baked for 40 minutes and it was so good!  The second time I made it, I increased the cocoa to 1 c. as others has suggested and it was absolute perfection.  Incredibly moist and delicious.  Hubby couldn't stop raving about it.  I've made it once with a fudge frosting and once with buttercream and both are amazing.  You can't go wrong with this cake...it's so easy there is no reason to buy a box mix again.

This was ok and a nice quick recipe using stuff I usually have on hand so works well in a pinch, but I've had better chocolate cakes. This cake came out lovely in the centre, but the edges were dry and crumbly. It also had a slightly off taste - possibly from too much rising agents? Will keep looking for a better chocolate cake recipe since there are plenty out there. UPDATE: I've played around with this recipe a bit because I don't like leaving poor reviews. I recommend minimum changes - omit the baking soda, change the oil to butter melted down with real chocolate (roughly 100g). These minor changes would make a 4 star cake that takes away the off taste I mentioned in my original review and also changes the texture to something more akin to a mudcake.  Several other changes could be made to make this a 4.5 or even 5 star cake, but by the time you do this you end up with an entirely different cake. I think I'm done fiddling with this recipe - but hey, at least I tried.

THIS IT TERRIFIC! NOW MY STANDARD CHOCOLATE CAKE RECIPE I followed other reviewers advice and used a whole cup of baking cocoa.  That is the reason for the 4 stars.  I think the cake needs that extra cocoa, though I have never tried it the other way.  I also put in water instead of milk.

Followed the recipe to a T, but the cake is still liquidy after 55 mins baking at 350.   I poured  the remainder  into cupcake tins which came out pretty much finished at 35 mins ( a few uncooked spots)...  taste was good, but needs much more baking time!

This cake was great! I didn't make any changes (other than using a vanilla buttercream recipe.) The birthday girl loves the cake. It was very moist and very chocolately. I will definitely be making this again.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. It is a very sweet, chocolatey, and moist cake. The first time I made this, I was a little sceptical when putting it in the oven because of how thin and liquidy the batter was. Boy was I wrong! It solidified and puffed up a lot. This is super easy to make and my all my family and friends love it. I've been asked several times by different people to make this for birthdays and celebrations.

Conclusion: If you make this cake, you will NOT regret it.

*Side Note: Cleanup and removing  the cakes from the pan is a lot easier if you line the inside of the pan with parchment paper.*

This recipe is amazing! I've used it multiple times, and it never fails me. Most recently, I made a trifle using layers of this cake, chocolate meringue spirals, and chocolate mousse for my mom's birthday. It tasted fabulous!  And I was worried about the thin batter, but it turns out just great! Plus, I increased the amount of cocoa to 1 cup, because someone else suggested it, and it really worked for more chocolate flavor .Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I made this cake for my Mom's birthday and the whole family loved it! It is so easy to make too. I always make it a day before and then I use a mocha buttercream frosting which makes the cake taste even better.

"Batter will be very thin" is code for " DO NOT cheat and use spring form pans."  I had quite a mess everywhere.  I also used cake flour by mistake. That combined with the leaks made my cakes flat in the middle.  I'll try this again with all purpose flour & traditional cake pans.

This cake was great!! I thought that that extra thing of water was going to ruin the cake, but instead, it made the cake WONDERFUL!!!!! I didn't add the baking powder, I only added the baking soda. Even that much made it poofy. I would just make one more suggestment, put less sugar next time. Other that than that, I would say the cake was Thumbs up all thy way, I will be making this cake again!!!

Made this for Father's Day. Everyone loved it, including my little brother who hates chocolate cake. Upon reading everyone else's reviews I decided to reduce the cup of water to 2/3 and I added a 1/2 teaspoon of instant coffee. I made a delicious mocha icing to go with it. It came out fantastic! The texture and the taste of  this cake was superb!

Really perfect! Its light, spongey, light, and moist! Its not to sweet even when I added chocolate frosting! The only thing I don't know what went wrong with my cake is that the bottom is kind of weird looking in the inside. Like its wet and spongey looking, but its cooked all the way. But it still taste good!

I am making this cake right now for the third time. It is the easiest recipe I have come across that makes a really really good cake. I highly recommended to anyone. Also - after adding the water, the batter is very thin. Don't panic it's supposed to be. It turns out perfect.

This was the first time I had ever made any sort of food from scratch and it was a success! The cake is Easy to make and absolutely delicious. Easy to layer the cake, even with the frosting in the middle. I made it for my girlfriend and her family asked if it was store bought because they couldn't believe i had made a cake that good on my first try. Definitely making it again

It worked like a charm. It was plenty sweet and moist. Good base recipe. I used real butter and cut out half a cup of sugar and it was still splendid. I can not handle too much sweet and we don't usually bake with oil or crisco. So it was butter. yummy

I tried to made it twice for my mother in law birthday, I wanted to shine, (she hates me). But it didn't went well. While I was baking it , it started to look nice and big but suddenly it deflated and ended horrible I couldn't do anything with it, although it was absolutely delicious. I followed every single step and ingredient,  I didn't opened the oven. I really don't know what went wrong.

I'm not much of a baker, and I found this dead easy to make. It's tasty, moist and not too sweet. I had to leave it a few extra minutes, but I think that's an issue with my oven, not the recipe. This is my 2nd time making it, because my son requested it for his birthday because he enjoyed the last one so much! This one is a keeper.

I added 1 cup of cocoa powder instead of 3/4 of a cup. The last thing I changed to give the chocolate a bit of a more outstanding flavor is that I added 1 teaspoon of instant expresso coffee powder to the boiling water and the cake smelled and tasted so good ! Definitely recommend it but you should try to double up the recipe because if you divide the batter by 2 9- inch cake pans it turns out a bit small but other than that it's perfect! I was also very surprised that this recipe did not contain any butter!

This is my go to recipe.  I've made it as it states and dairy free using almond milk and coconut oil.  Either way it's delicious.  I always get compliments when I use this chocolate cake as my base.

Lol this isn't even a review y'all I just want to make sure that everyone is totally aware that the most popular cake recipe on google isn't even a recipe from a person it's just the exact thing off the back of a Hersheys coco powder box. Hersheys knows their  I guess. Laughed really hard when I got it out to make the recipe and noticed. :] On a side note add a bit more of said product to get prime consistency, almost a full cup. I layered cake between layers of brownie and then iced. Scrumdidlyumptious. Also I think the site is editing out the word -- maybe. Well whatever, you scrotums.

I'm not much of a dessert/sweet baker so I was surprised to see this recipe worked for me perfectly. I made 12 cupcakes and a small cake in an 8" x8" glass pan. Very nice and chocolatey and moist. I mean... wow. Far better than any mix in a box or even better than any chocolate cake I've ever had. Seriously. I made a frosting with butter, powdered sugar, vanilla, milk and a bit of vanilla pudding powder. HOLY CAKE Batman. Amazing. Thank you.

It's really good but not as rich so I used 1 cup of coco powder and instead of water I use coffee and I melt a half bag of mini chips with the hot coffee then add it. If you want to make this cake more dense for stacking add an extra egg. I love this recipe because you can change things and have it still turn out delicious

I was looking for a recipe without coffee for a child's birthday cake. I made it just as the recipe instructed. The cake was very good and didn't seem like a pudding cake as another reviewer stated. I used parchment in my circular pans for a layer cake and had no problem getting the cakes out. I put it in the refrigerator over night to frost the next day with buttercream frosting. The cake was a big hit with everyone.

Absolutely the best 8 inch round two layer cake that is light and fluffy and works with gluten-free or regular flour.  It's the tastiest with the allrecipes.com satiny chocolate glaze put on top and a few hazelnuts around the edge .

Soooo good! My only issue is that is was really tough to get out of the pan, even though I greased & floured the pans. Next time I may use parchment paper. 
I also changed out a couple ingredients. instead of Veg oil (because I am not a fan of the stuff) I did 1/4c coconut oil & 1/4c butter. Also added extra cocoa powder & chocolate chips because I wanted it extra chocolately! Delish!

I upped the cocoa powder to 1 cup as suggested in a review, and it was great. I also used the frosting recipe in another review. Overall, it was better than a cake from the grocery store, and as good as, if not better than the box mix. I put the tea kettle on to boil water first, and it was ready by the end. I also made sure to beat for the full 2 mins. I used fresh, room temperature duck eggs too. Oh, and make sure you grease AND flour the baking pan to get it to release nicely. Spread the grease/oil around, and put the flour on top. Pretend it's like spreading glitter and tilt the pan all around until you have a nice coating. The end product was a light, fluffy, moist 2 layer birthday cake for my husband. I'll be making it again, possibly with fruit flavors instead of chocolate.

This recipe is a slam dunk! I had been searching for a reliable and easy to make chocolate cake recipe and I'm happy to say I've found it with this one. I did have to bake it a little longer than specified but other than that, I followed it to a T. It came out moist and spongy and super delicious! I will definitely be making it again!

Excellent cake. It's very moist. I took a couple of pointers from other reviews and added more cocoa powder, a little more vegetable oil and I added instant espresso to the boiling water. I halved the recipe and made a single layer 8x8. Baked it for 25-30 minutes and it was perfect. A good simple recipe with ingredients you have in your pantry.

At 8,000 ft elevation, this was a poor choice even though I made fairly standard altitude adjustments (adding flour and liquid, cutting back on oil). The cupcakes were severely sunken. But it tasted just fine with a homemade butter-cream cheese frosting.  The frosting filled the cupcake crater tops, and served upside down, the single layer cake didn't look too bad.  The inside of the oven cleaned up after scraping the drippings up with a spatula.  Would make it again using a carefully calculated high altitude adjustment and planning on cupcakes plus two layers, because the batter was so easy to mix together.

If you want a super moist, fudgey cake, this is it. The only changes I made were to add more cocoa like some reviewers suggested, I did a heaping 3/4 cup, and replaced the eggs with applesauce and extra oil for an allergic family member. I made a melted butter chocolate frosting and together it was fantastic.

Okay so having celiacs disease I am left with not being able to eat most of my favorite dishes. I tried a new gluten free flour with this recipe and it came out super moist , non dense and boasted flavor. Love the recipe and plan to make it again next month for my sons first birthday!

Amazing, simple chocolate cake!  If you make chocolate cake primarily as a way to add more chocolate to your diet (I do!), then this is the recipe for you.  As others have said, this is not a fancy layer cake - it's more of a spoon cake, but that's not a bad thing.

I increased the cocoa to 1 cup, as suggested by multiple reviewers, and I also used brown sugar instead of white (because I discovered I was out of white sugar).  Baking only took 25 minutes for me, so be sure to keep a close eye on this because I expect it could dry out quickly.

For frosting, I followed the recipe in Eponine's review.  That makes a nice chocolate sauce that's easy to spread on the cake, but I'd probably use a cream cheese icing if I wanted to dress it up a little more.

Just perfect. This became a favourite family recipe.
But after doing it for few times now, i had to make few modifications though. ditch the all purpose flour and use cake flour instead. make it with a full 1 cup of unsweetened powder instead of 3/4. Reduce the sugar to your taste, 2 cups of sugar results a very sweet cake.  And for the sugar I used super fine grain sugar for  desserts,  not the powdered sugar. Sift the dry ingredients together twice to remove any clumbs. Sometimes I use full fat cream instead of milk.

I made a few changes to this recipe, added coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and butter... This came out to be an AMAZING brownie recipe.  Will make again with just butter next time so it's more cakey  :-)

Made this for Krys's 35th birthday with peanut butter frosting (and a layer of full Reese's cups in the middle layer...and mini cups on top...OMG). It came out so well. I had problems frosting the sides because the cake kept crumbling off, but it still tasted amazing. This is the kind of thing that weirdly gets better with age after spending a day or two in the fridge!

Omg this cake was a total hit.  My husband LOVES German Chocolate Cake and I surprised him with his favorite dinner and a German Chocolate Cake today. I made it and with in an hour the whole thing was gone!!! I made it exactly as the recipe said, which is rare I love to doctor recipes. I did put a bit more vanilla but I always do. Finished with German Chocolate Cake frosting.  I am not usually a huge chocolate cake fan but it was so moist, flavorful, and rich enough, yet not too rich. Highly recommend and so easy to make!!!!!

I was looking for a super easy chocolate cake that my son and I could make together. I rarely ever bake... and this cake came out perfectly!! I was truly shocked at how easy this was to make and how delicious it was. My son and I will definitely be making this recipe again. Thank you!  :)

Fantastic, easy-to-follow recipe! You can't go wrong. Fudgy and satisfyingly chocolaty.  I made this cake twice in a week: first time, followed recipe exactly; second time, with soy milk instead of milk (ran out of milk and was too lazy to go grocery shopping at night), with half the sugar (I love chocolate but sugar, not so much), and with semi-sweet chocolate chip liberally sprinkled on top of the dough right before putting the pans into the oven.  The cake that resulted was exactly my dream chocolate cake the second time, although it was amazing the first time too.   The cake gets tastier the day after you make it, although it's hard to leave it for that long!

This recipe turned out so well. I replaced the flour with rice flour, so it was gluten free, and no one could tell the difference!

This was a really good cake. Like others, I am comparing it to boxed...there is no comparison! Just as easy to make and geez does it taste ever so much better. I was worried because it seemed to liquid-y, but it was perfect. I didn't even get a picture, it went so fast. Thank you for a keeper!

Wow what a fantastically easy cake!  Good taste too. I live at high altitude and decreased the baking soda and powder Both by about 1/2 tsp. I also added a couple more tablespoons of flour (approximately). I baked it at 375 for approximately 45-50 minutes in a 9x13 pan. This first time I pulled the cake out to test at 30 minutes like the recipe said, and it was still batter on the inside. So I put it back in for 20 more minutes. Because I did that, it "fell".  But it still tastes wonderful!!  Next time I'm baking it for 45-50 minutes without testing. And I'm also going to try making this recipe with hot coffee instead of boiling water yum yum.

The best recipe for a 1st time baker like me. I baked this for a bake sale fundraiser and it was a hit..I baked again for friends and they love it. I can't thank enough the original person who made this recipe. You rock. Everyone is asking abo it the recipe..They said the cake was very moist. They love it :)

This was my first attempt at a "homemade" cake. It's super moist! I saw a review that said to bump up the cocoa to 1 cup so I did. Great chocolatey flavor! I added 1/2 cup of ground flaxseed for fiber! Total perfection! I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe, though I'm not sure why it's on here twice.  The cake is the same as the Extreme Chocolate Cake by RACH56. EXACTY the same.  But Extreme Chocolate Cake also provides a frosting recipe. Regardless...I made no changes.  I never thought I'd be able to replace a box mix, but this recipe is great! It's my go-to recipe.

The only small change I made was using almond instead of vanilla (I make this change with almost everything) and it really is the best homemade chocolate cake I have ever had. It is so moist and delicious. It really is perfect. mmmm

Awesome cake, so moist and chocolatey...   I topped it with a small box of white chocolate pudding, so it's not too sweet, and we just love it.  I also added more cocoa, because we like it to be really chocolatey.  I've made it several times now and it rarely lasts more than a couple of days, lol.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Great recipe.  I intended to make it just as written, but wanted to halve the recipe.   I forgot to halve the cocoa and it was wonderful.  Rich chocolatey flavor and very moist.  I am scratching my head over some of the reviews.  I do understand many of the review reflect personal taste, though.  This is will be my go to.  It was simple and easy.  I love the fact that it calls for powder rather than bricks.  The powder has a longer shelf life and is always on hand.   
I am wondering if those who had problems with overflow neglected to beat the batter well enough after adding the boiling water.

I'm a serious chocoholic. But the one thing I never liked was chocolate cake.  It's nearly always dry and bland. Well, this cake is giving my serious doubts about my "no chocolate cake" rule. It's moist and fudgy, and with some chocolate frosting would be incredible. We used the batter for cupcakes. They rose  well, but not uniformly - some of them look rather strange. But the kids we're making them for won't mind.

The first time I made this I was sure I'd measured wrong because the batter was so runny, but put it in oven anyway and it came out perfectly. This is the most amazing light and sumptuosly moist chocolate cake. No need to fiddle with it. And it's fast and easy. It works great as well if you want to do a fast, reasonably good facsimile of a black forest cake (a can of cherry pie filling with much of the syrup drained off and thick whipped cream instead of frosting works).

This is the second time I have made this cake. First time with 2x 9 inch pans and the second 9 x 13 inch pan. Both times it came out beautiful! It was so good that the first cake was gone that same night!

For 12 chocolate cupcakes, I halve the recipe and throw in a handful of semi sweet chocolate chips before I pop it in the oven for 15 mins. They are fluffy and perfect with a chocolate glaze. Quick and easy recipe.

Amazing flavor!  I accidentally filled the cake pans too much.  Which caused the batter to overflow.  Also, if you want to layer the cake you should probably put the cake in the fridge before stacking.  Or the cake will fall apart.  I added more coco powder to give it a more intense  chocolate flavor.  All in all a great cake recipe.

I made the cake according to the recipe but instead of 1 cup of boiling water, I used a half cup of boiling coffee and a half cup of boiling water.  I've made it a couple of times and it comes out great each time.  Family and friends have loved the cake!

I also have made the 'creamy chocolate frosting' recipe on this site.  In stead of 5 T of evaporated milk,  I've switched 2 of those tablespoons with coffee. The frosting is great with this cake as well.

Loved it! The cake is delicious. It tastes very light and fluffy. I would recommend putting parchment paper on the bottom of the pan and maybe cook it for a little more than 30 minutes.  I am definitely making this cake again. Yum!

Delicious. I halved the recipe to make 12 cupcakes. Used half and half because that's what I had on hand, upped the cocoa to half a cup, and oh my...so rich and moist. Frost them if you like, but they don't need it.

It is the best scratch chocolate cake I've made.  It's simple, one bowl.  I've even made it with all water, no milk.  Every time I asked what can I bring (to a get together) they would always request this cake!  I got tired of  making it! :)

I forgot the water altogether but it still turned out pretty good. The next time I make it (and I will be making it again) I'll add the water, but really, this is a good recipe.

I made this tonight and it was awesome.  I did not have vegetable oil so I used Coconut Oil instead and it worked out fine. I was a little nervous at how thin the batter was when I added the cup of boiling water, but it came out so nice and moist.  I also made it in a 9 x 13 pan, so I adjusted the baking time to 325 for 40 minutes.   I used a Buttercream Frosting.  This is definitely a cake that I will be making again.

I have made thousands of recipes from this site, and I am an avid baker. Nothing bothers me more than clicking on a recipe just to discover that it starts with a box batter...this cake is not that. It is a simple, fast from scratch chocolate that reminds me of every birthday party and picnic I have been to as a child. I have made it three times this week bcs I am working on a boiled icing to compliment it. I have changed nothing, the oil content is high but it holds the moisture so if you aren't counting calories...then don't modify!! Indulge. This recipe will be serving my family well for many years to come, and everyone is raving about how amazing and rich it is!!

I just made this cake and it was the best chocolate homemade cake I've ever made. I was making it for a friend and he was so pleased with it! It was so moist and delicious that I'm sticking with this one forever. I didn't have milk so I used 1/2 cup of evaporated milk and 1/2 cup of water. I made this cake twice. Once exactly like the recipe shown and once without the vanilla and 1 whole cup of cocoa and both were delicious. After reading the comments I made sure to both line my cake pans with wax paper and to use a cooking nonstick spray and it turned out fantastic. Thank you so much for this recipe!!!!!

This is now my go to for chocolate cake. I added a 1/2 tsp mint extract for the chocolate mint lovers in my life and we finish it with Andes mint crumbles between layers. 
I did find that it requires a good layer of oil and flour in the cake pans. As for icing the cake, refrigerating for an hour helps, or I pipe the icing in a zigzag and then spread, instead of trying to spread it in broad, sweeping strokes.

I'm new to making cake and frosting from scratch. This recipe is delicious, but my cake stuck to the frosting as I smoothed it on. Still need practice, I guess! Next time, I'll frost as soon as I make the frosting. Waiting a bit gave it time to harden.

My family really liked this recipe but I also made a number of changes to the original recipe.  
- I used all-purpose gluten-free flour
- I substituted applesauce in place of eggs
- I was out of vanilla extract and almond milk, so I substituted a dairy-free French Vanilla "creamer" which worked out very well. 
- I eyeballed a lot of the measurements in the ingredient list rather than using exact measurements.  

I baked these in muffin tins at 350 for 30-35 minutes.  This recipe made a little over 2 dozen muffins.

This by far is the best chocolate cake recipe I have ever made. Moist with a great flavor. I followed other suggestions to use cocoa powder vs flour to dust the pan before baking. It worked perfectly. This is my new "go to" chocolate cake recipe.

Awesome cake.  I topped it with Betty Crocker Sour Cream chocolate frosting.  Received lots of complements.

This is really a good and easy chocolate cake recipe. I did alter some ingredients to make it healthier. I used coconut oil.  I had to micro it a minute and let it cool. I added it to the dry ingredients and mixed first before the other liquids. I also used coconut milk (Silk Vanilla). I used one cup Stevia in the Raw and one cup sugar. I also took a suggestions from another reviewer and added a cup of Cocoa powder instead of 3/4. My husband said it was the best chocolate cupcakes ever. (baked 13-15 min) I also used (after altering that recipe) a chocolate frosting II, that I got here as well. Amazing! I think the coconut oil made it much more moist and upscale in taste. The Stevia and sugar combo did not disappoint. I froze a dozen to take to my SIL for Super Bowl Sunday. They love when I bake or cook dinner.    PS if you are going to use this in a cake pan you must grease AND flour the pan.

I made the cake recipe (not the frosting) with a few variations. I used the self rising flour that I had, so I didn't add the baking soda, powder, or salt. I used almond/coconut milk instead of dairy milk and substituted the hot coffee for the water as suggested by some others. This cake was unbelievably delicious  and doesn't need frosting. It's perfect as is.

I made some changes to the recipe. Replace half the water with pureed strawberries and added some cinnamon. End result was a very moist and rich chocolate cake for my wife's birthday.

I also made a strawberry filling and chocolate cream cheese icing. I think both thos i found on this site as well.

Easy, moist and delicious!  When I make it, it comes out to a consistency between a cake and brownie.  My sister simply looooved it.  The second time I  made it I substituted the hot water for hot strong brewed coffee, both ways it came out yummy.

Mad this with only a few modifications:  I upped the cocoa powder to a full cup; cut the sugar down to 1.5 cups; replaced oil with applesauce, only because I didn't have any oil to use.  Honestly, I don't think it would have made a difference whether I used anything or not for the oil, as this cake is plenty moist.  VERY IMPORTANT:  Make sure the cake is completely cool before you try moving it out of the pan, otherwise it will stick.  I used parchment paper, as another reviewer recommended, which worked well, but it still even stuck to the parchment paper when it was hot.  Once it was cool, the rest of the cake peeled off without issue.  I used the Creamy Chocolate Frosting recipe on this site for the frosting.  This will be my go-to recipe forever.

Very moist! I made the layer cake version with wax paper cut to fit the bottom of the circular pans and it came out absolutely perfect. I used dark choc cocoa powder, coconut oil instead of veg, vanilla almond milk instead of cow's and dark chocolate ganache. It's freakin'  yummy. A recipe I'll use again and again.

Used this recipe for cupcakes- best chocolate cupcakes everrrrrr! Since I was taking it on a trial run for an upcoming birthday party, I only prepared a 1/2 batch-- I added a touch more coco powder that "exactly 1/2" what the recipe called for. They turned out SO moist and delicious, I'm definitely using this for my future chocolate cupcake needsâ¦ and let's be honest, when does one NOT need a chocolate cupcake?!

I made this with the suggestion 1 cup of cocoa.  I also added about 2 tsp of vinegar in with the milk.  I baked as regular size muffins in parchment liners at 400F for about 18-20 (tested with a stick for doneness).  They came out super tasty and moist.  I will have to try with icing sometime but these were good without.

I made this cake for my husbands birthday and it was an awesome cake! I added three fourths of a cup of cocoa instead and it made it rich but we love chocolate in this house, so we loved it! If you don't like super rich chocolate cake then just follow the recipe exactly and it will be just fine! I made a raspberry filling for this cake as well and it was just the best cake ever. I would highly recommend this cake to everyone who loves chocolate cake :)

MAKES PERFECT CUPCAKES!  I poured the batter into 24 standard cupcakes in paper cups and baked 16 minutes at 350F.  I used a little less salt after reading other reviews, about 3/4 tsp instead of 1 tsp, and I sifted the flour with the baking soda, baking powder, salt and cocoa (nothing worse than getting a lump of baking soda in your baked goods).  The batter was very thin but fluffed up beautifully while baking.  I iced half with "Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting" and the other half with Irish Cream frosting from "Chocolate Beer Cupcakes with Whisky Filling and Irish Cream Icing" - and I piped the frosting on rather than spreading for a more fancy look.  They were a hit!

I have never baked a cake that wasn't from a box mix,   but today, I decided to make a cake from scratch for my husband's 63rd birthday. Half-way into the process, I discovered I had only 1/2 cup of the unsweetened cocoa powder, and had only a 1/2 tsp of vanilla left, so I grated up some unsweetened baker's chocolate and added more than I thought I actually needed (based on some reviewers' suggestions to increase the cocoa amount) and then I substituted Kahlua for the Vanilla. I did not have any round pans so I used a 9x13 pan and baked it exactly 40 minutes. at 350. The cake came out PERFECTLY and tasted WAY BETTER than any box mix chocolate cake that I had ever made. And its consistency was perfect.  My husband would not wait for it to fully cool, so we ate along the cooler edges first and it was fabulous. I read in a review that it will taste even better the second day.  I WILL NEVER BAKE A CHOCOLATE CAKE FROM A BOX AGAIN!  (Just an FYI, it turns out that this recipe online here is exactly the same as that on the back of the Hershey's Unsweetened Cocoa Powder container). What a great and simple and delicious recipe  this is.

The cake has a brownie consistency. It is very moist and gooey.  I would do it again and add chocolate chips to it. It yields a very big cake so make sure to have a big container to bake in. I also used parchment paper as per a review that another member left here, and it was super easy to remove and I didn't have a mess to clean up. The flavor didn't kill me though. Maybe I will change the cocoa powder next time and see if I like it better. Good cake.

Followed instructions. Super easy. Excellent flavor, just the right amount of sweetness. Not too sweet. Moist, light, fluffy and delicious.  Rotated and swapped pan positions half way through the cooking time. Wonderful recipe.

Excellent, made per recipe exactly!  Very moist and tasty. We made as 9 X 13 and cooked for 35 min at 350 deg in convection oven.  I can understand comments of others regarding texture compared to traditional cake, but we liked it very much as a simple, tasty treat.

It was great 
But a the cocoa was a bit too much maybe its because i used one cup of sugar instead on two?.    
Ill try it again with 1/3 cup of cocoa, cause i don't like too much sugar

I increased flour from 1 3/4 cups to 2 cups to get a more firm batter (actually I got the idea from another recipe that was identical to this one, except the flour was 2 cups in the other recipe).  I did this because I did not want a pudding type cake as some reviewers described this one.  It came out beautifully with the increase in flour.

The cake is very moist, and chocolaty! One of my favourites as its really simple. Although when I make it, I cut the sugar in half ( frosting is already sweet), and add some instant coffee to the boiling water to bring out the chocolate flavour!

I think this is the cake recipe on the Hersey Cocoa Powder box because I believe I've made it before. Regardless -- it's delicious. I upped the cocoa to one cup like reviewer Ionnarific suggested. Love it!

This was wonderful and so moist! I used a little butter and oil and spread it  all over the pans evenly so the cake would not stick. I then waited for them to cool before trying to remove them. It was a beautiful cake and gone in less than one day! I'm making another one today. I LOVE this recipe

Pretty good, a little dry.  As I chewed this I realised that it needed something else.  Went well with "Chocolate Icing" made by Chas.  It was a good treat, but needed something else. I would give this 3 and a half stars but I can only get 3 or 4

Its a 5 star!..........    I just dont like when recipes start with "a cake mix" ... plah.... I do layer this cake with frosting in the middle.   Buttercream Chocolate Icing makes it a over the top!

I have made this cake over 3 times, and it always turns out great! It's not to heavy, and not too thin, and tastes great with either chocolate or vanilla icing! It is the only cake I ever make now, and is a family birthday cake tradition!!!! Thanks so much!

I wasn't too happy with this recipe, like others I could barely get it to come out of the baking pans, so it was definitely more of a spoon cake. The extra moisture also meant it took longer to cook all the way through, and by the time it had, the top was overcooked. I would probably leave out most if not all of the boiling water if I made this again.

This cake is the best chocolate cake I've ever had. It is super rich and doesn't start to go dry or stale for days. It is best with dutch cocoa. If you use regular American made cocoa powder, it is kind of a disappointment (at least after trying it with dutch cocoa powder). I tried it recently with Vanilla Almond milk instead of regular milk because one of my guests had a dairy allergy. It tasted even better than it normally does! This is my go-to cake recipe now, since every person who has tried it has said it is the best cake they ever had.

Made cake pops on a whim didn't need to add any moisturizer like icing to form the balls this cake was super moist and in ball form seem to get even more moist. Use plenty pan grease or spray because it is so moist may not lift from pan as easy as some.

This cake was delicious! I made it dairy free and replaced the milk for soy milk and it still tastes great! Just a tip, I would use disposable tins when making this cake because no matter how much I greased the pans they still stuck. When you use a disposable tin you can just fold down the sides and it comes right out.

Cake does not come out of the pan despite flouring the pan. 
Delicious.
Cup cake is a good idea with this recipe too!
Makes a LOT!
Tastes better the next day and the days after.

First homemade chocolate cake. It was good but  it is chocolate overload. Didn't release from the pan very well. More of a pudding type cake. Not the texture I was looking for.

This review is from my husband since I'm not a huge chocolate cake fan . It stays incredibly moist .
have made this cake about a dozen times
Each time I make I change something lol
Instead of veg oil I use coconut oil . The taste of coconut really adds a nice flavor . 
Also sometimes I'll add walnuts 
Or coconut to it .
Makes a nice change

I make it in a 9x13 instead of 2 spring forms

Have been making this cake for over 7 years now and never reviewed it! It is my husbands all time favorite cake and his request for his birthday every year! I make my own buttercream frosting, and my family swears it's the recipe they used for hostess cupcakes. The longer it sits the better it gets. I made exactly as posted but learned a trick from food network of adding Tbs of instant coffee or espresso to really bring out the chocolate flavor. It is the best, most moist chocolate cake ever!! Also great with ganache, and batter works well for cupcakes too!

Quick, easy, moist, delicious. Can't get any better. Baked 2 8" pans for 30 min. Will try adding a couple of minutes to test the consistency. Thanks for sharing.

This is the best chocolate cake recipe! I have made it as both a layer cake and a sheet cake. It is easy, moist and absolutely delicious. I use Hershey's special dark cocoa powder (one full cup) and substitute the boiling water with one cup of boiling coffee. This makes a rich, dark chocolate cake and people will ask for the recipe. I icing with peanut butter frosting and if you are really ambitious, chop up Reeses peanut butter cups and sprinkle on top. Love it!

First time making a cake from scratch. I love chocolate so I had to try it. I made it the day before simply because I was going to be pressed for time. Best decision ever! It was so moist, everyone loved it!..........The second time I made it though it didn't come out of the pans so easily, i think you really should let it set a good amount of time. Probably has to do with it being so fudgy :)

I've made this cake a handful of times now and it's awesome! An easy alternative to boxed cake recipes without being complicated and over worked. One tip is that you'll really have to let it cool before icing or decorating as its so moist. If you do it too soon, you'll end up losing some of the cake in crumbles. I've paired it with peanut butter frosting, layered it with chocolate mousse or topped it with chocolate ganache and fresh raspberries and its outstanding every time!

I have made this recipe twice as cupcakes which turned out moist and delicious.  I'm now going to make it as a birthday cake.  I used almond milk instead of milk because of a milk sensitivity.  Simple easy and delicious!

I made this for my husband for his birthday. He absolutely loved it. So did the kids.  They said it tasted like a brownie and moist chocolate cake in one.  He loved it so much he took shared it with his co-workers who also said it was delicious.  The only change in the recipe i made was using  1 full cup of cocoa powder.  I will definitely make this again.

Made this into cupcakes for a bake sale. They never made it to the bake sale.  Hell they never even made it to the frosting stage, they were moist chocolaty and perfect. I used Ghiradelli powder and vanilla bean paste, and Bustello instant coffee in my boiling water. Chocolate heaven, Amen and Amen!! :-)

Rich and moist. I thought it wasn't going to bake right because it was SO thin and watery looking, but it was perfect. I actually substituted the milk for buttermilk too :) A double batch of this recipe made exactly one dozen regular sized muffins, 6 large muffins, and a large loaf pan.

as stated, batter was super thin and mine did rise over the top - not spilled, but baked onto the lip of the pan so i had to take a knife to it. gave me a chance to taste it and although i thought with 2 cups of sugar it would be super sweet, it wasn't and it was yummy. mine did not stick to the pan, although i sprayed and floured it generously.  off to find an icing now...enjoy

This is a nice easy recipe for a moist, rich chocolate cake. 
I do not bother making the icing. I have made this recipe a couple of times as a single cake and I have found the cake sticks to the pan, however this is probably due to not greasing it well enough.

I now use this recipe to make cupcakes. I greased the pans well and they came out easily. They taste great and it is so quick and easy.

Oh my, if you need a sure-proof cake recipe that produces great texture and packs some wonderful chocolate flavor, bake this one. I was a little hesitant to try this even with all the glowing reviews because the negative ones really slammed it. But, having used a similar recipe from the King Arthur Flour website - with consistently good results, I thought this would be a nice variation. Ah-mazing. I did use a combination of Hershey dark and regular cocoa and upped the amount  per others' suggestions. Didn't make a cup of coffee to use in place of the boiling water although I usually do that with my other cake recipe and can vouch that it is a wonderful option just not necessary. I always add a dash of vanilla to all my baked goodies, it seems to add a nice smoothness to all the recipe flavors so I did that here, too. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly with the cake batter coming together very easily. I think it measured around five cups total - which I divided evenly between my two nine inch round pans. I had greased the bottoms and sides of the pans and put parchment rounds in each. (Removing the cakes from the pans after ten minutes of cooling was not a problem.) I baked the layers for thirty two minutes and got moist, evenly cooked cakes. I am still puzzled by all the negative comments because I think this recipe produces a rich tasting cake that oddly has a lightness to it. Even the smell is heavenly. I topped it with a milk chocolate frosting and served with s

This cake was lovely .It was soft , moist and delicious just like a boxed mix .I recommend like most of the other reviewers did to increase the cocoa powder to 1 cup and sift the dry ingredients together into the bowl.after using this recipe I will never use a boxed mix again!!!!

If you want a cake that tastes like a mix cake, then this recipe is ok, since it's really no more work than a boxed mix.  But if you want something really, deeply chocolatey, this is not the cake for you.  It was moist and rose nicely, but the taste was rather bland.  I will keep looking for a fudgey chocolate cake.

I made this with the Better Batter gluten-free flour mix, and it was amazing! My husband said it was the best chocolate cake he had ever tasted--and since he's 47 and loves cake? That is a pretty amazing feat!

This is one of the best chocolate cake recipes I've made. I had to bake it 40 min. instead of the 35. Yet what came out of my oven was beyond my expectations.  Thanks so much. 
Will tell friends.

This recipe takes the cake. It has become my go-to for cake batter. It's simple to make, the texture is lovely and the cake is nice and moist.

I agree with SunnySmile. It is more like fudge cake.  I didn't have eggs, so I substituted chia seed "gel." I had only a little milk left, so I used yogurt instead. It still came out like described: dense, rich, and moist. I also lined the bottom of my non-stick bundt pan with parchment paper. Made a HUGE difference in being able to remove the cake in one piece.

Just made it for the second time. It's a wonderful recipe. I did have to bake longer than 30 minutes, I just kept testing it until it came out clean. I made a giant cupcake the first time and a two layer round cake the second. It was devoured! I changed to 1 cup cocoa and added a teaspoon of instant coffee to boiling water. Its very liquidy, super easy to pour, very moist cake but not too dense. Very very good! Rave reviews from everyone:)

The very first time I made this cake was a total disaster...evidently I missed something along the way and it VOLCANOED all over my oven. It smelled so good while it was making that mess I refused to let it defeat me.  I waited about a month and tried again...HOLY MOLY!!! Since then my boss requests I make it every few weeks!

I love this recipe.  Super easy and moist.  It's even easier if you use a kitchen scale for the dry ingredients.  8.1 ounces of sugar, 8.9 ounces of flour, 2.5 ounces of cocoa powder.

The end product tasted pretty good. But, it was super sticky and rose a lot more than accounted for. It didn't look like the picture at all. Cleanup was a nightmare. Would not use again. ps: frosting was awful

Very easy and a great base recipie. I used 9x13 and it only needed to cook for 30 mins. I have also substituted half the oil with applesauce and I couldn't tell the difference. Still moist and not too sweet. I also put a little less than the recommended sugar, less sweet and allows the cocoa to really come through.

I've made this as a cake and as cupcakes  Cupcakes take about 18 minutes. It comes out really light and moist. The only thing I changed was the order in which I mixed the ingredients. A lot of cake recipes say to cream together eggs, oil/butter and sugar. I do those 3 firsy, then the rest. Not sure if it makes a difference since the boiling water will take out the grainyness of the sugar.

Very moist and excellent flavor, I was surprised at how thin the batter was but it baked perfectly in 30 minutes.  So moist it was hard to get out of the pan but I dont have a cake server either.

This is a GREAT recipe that I have made many times. I went way outside the box this time and added 1/2 cup sour cream, 2 T extra sugar, 2T extra cocoa and 1 C. .strong coffee. I think I've got something here .It's a very interesting texture, like baked pudding. Not too springy either.  Next time going to do the same with Red wine instead of coffee. :-)

Delicious. Perfect every time. I like to make little cupcakes out of this because who wants to deal with the hassle of a whole cake and cleaning out pans? I sure don't. I prefer it plain - no topping of any kind. This batter is that good. Everyone has to hold back from eating more than they can chew haha.

Made this last night and it was an absolute hit!! So easy, comes together fast, and tastes fantastic. Very moist but still held its shape well! No issues depanning. Made a beautiful choclate layer cake. Will make again! Added a hint of instant expresso powder to really bring out the chocolate flavour. Much easier than many cake recipes.

This cake is very, very liquidy. I've done everything according to the directions. I put one star "couldn't eat it" because I had to literally scoop out the liquidy part to eat it. I even added 5 minute intervals to bake it, but the inside and middle were still like the slop-ish mix in the bowl. All in all, the cake tastes deliciious, but like sunnysmile said, it is more of a pudding cake.

This is an amazing chocolate cake! The best Ive ever eaten. It is my standby and all my friends beg me for the recipe. I would suggest to put in the wet ingredients first to give the cake more spongy better slicing surface. Also put in one cup of cocoa if you have enough. Cut circles of paper towel and put on the bottom of the greased pan. DO NOT flour the pan. This is the best recipe for cake I have ever eaten and I now HATE vanilla cake. :D

My family and I LOVE this recipe!! The only change I made is, instead of a cup of boiling water, I added a cup of hot coffee. I also scaled back the baking soda th 1 tsp. Yum!

This is a great recipe. I made it twice, and not even the crumbs were left. I made it in a in a single cake tin, and I used butter icing to top it off. It was a hit.

Very similar to boxed cake. Lacking the density and deep chocolate flavor that I prefer.

The best chocolate cake I've ever made! As a previous reviewer suggested, I added a spoonful of instant coffee. Also, because I didnt have veg oil at hand, I used butter. Baked in a 9Ã13" pan. So moist and fluffy!

The taste was wonderful ... Nice and moist. But I can't serve a cake that doesn't come out of the pan! I made a lot of mini-cakes and almost all of them stuck in the pan. I ran a spatula around the edges to help, but then they just came out in pieces of cake. I'm going to have to start all over! At least my family will enjoy eating the "mistakes."

Best homemade chocolate cake recipe I've found it's so good. Like quite a few people that have rated this recipe on here I upped the cocoa to 1 cup and it's amazing it doesn't even need frosting it's great with some confectioners sugar sifted over it.

My mom went "mmmMmmmM!" And my dad said "I think this is the best cake I've ever had" and he's (almost) 40! And at first I thought it looked to dark but it turned out outstanding! I also made a frosting for it!

I made cupcakes. Instead of rising they overflowed, spread out and were flat. They appeared done and sprung back when touched but were wet looking on top. I added a little more baking time but it didn't help. They were moist as promised but that didn't keep them from crumbling and sticking to your fingers. Flavor was not sweet enough to please kids.

I don't like chocolate cake, but seeing as it's my sister's birthday and she doesn't like vanilla, I thought I'd give this a try.   It's super moist and so much better than a box cake! And with only needing one bowl, making it is a breeze (cleaning up too).  I even liked this cake - it's yummy. :)

This is  a fabulous chocolate cake recipe. Easy and delicious. Cake was very moist and clean up was a breeze. I have made a lot of cakes (even a few in the last few days) and I really love this one. We have food allergies and often need a safe cake or cupcake for school/community events on short notice-this will be my go to!

Best chocolate cake recipe ever. Even after a few days, it was still good and not old and bad texture like most cakes get. We will definitely make this one again. We have tried several chocolate cake recipes and love this one the most.

This is an excellent chocolate cake. By far the best I've made. I only changed a couple things. As instead of reg cocoa I used Hershey's special dark for that extra kick, and used a whole cup??. And I used 3 tsp vanilla instead of 2. But WOW what a fantastic cake! I have found the perfect recipe and will not use another! Not too moist just right. Hope this helps!??

This was my first attempt at chocolate cake and it was a hit. The only change I made was to use one cup of chocolate. Word to the wise separate this and bake it in two pans. It will rise more that you think also do not use a spring form pan it will leak through.

Halved all the ingredients to make one 9" round cake. Except for the cocoa powder, used 1/2 cup instead. Totally worth it. Tasted delicious.

DO NOT even think of making any other cake, every again! This cake is amazingly delicious and I make it for every occasion. I always have the ingredients on hand, and it takes literally 10 minutes to throw all of the ingredients together. Besides not using the oil, instead substituting flavoured apple sauce (it flavours the cake nicely!), I have not changed a thing in this recipe. Bake it once, and ENJOY!!

Amazing recipe! My husband said it was the best cake he has ever had in his life and asked me to make again the next week! Moist and fluffy and very rich! The second time I made it I halved the recipe to make a mini cake and it came out just as delicious!!!

Super moist cake and YUMMY delicious. The only thing holding it back from five stars is that I was looking to make a layer cake and this is too moist to stand up to layers. Otherwise, I will definitely make again in a loaf-style cake. I did make a couple of substitutions: I traded out butter for oil - I just like the taste better - and added chocolate chips into the batter. Mini chips work better as they don't sink to the bottom. So chocolately, I may have to find a different frosting other than chocolate. YUM!

This is so easy, ingredients I already have, and delicious.  I have made it numerous times and follow the instructions as written and it's perfect every time.  Once I added mini chocolate chips to the pan after pouring in the batter (otherwise if stirred into the mix it sits on the bottom) for a surprise for my chocolate lover and made it a round layer cake. I pair it with the Creamy Chocolate Frosting recipe and it's always a hit.  Double the frosting recipe to layer between the round cakes and frost the entire cake (top and sides).  This is a go to recipe for me!

This is my go-to recipe every Thanksgiving holiday.  I have made this cake numerous times without fail.  Never an issue with baking time or coming out of the pans.  I always make it double layer.  It's a hit every time.  Pair with an awesome chocolate butter cream frosting (homemade), you can't lose.

I tried it the very first time.. Absolutely delicious.. Not too moist or dry.. Beats many boxed chocolate cakes. How can I modify the recipe to make a  vanilla cake or similar, that is not having to use cocoa... Thanks ever so much for the recipe..

Hi,
This is the best chocolate cake recipe ever. I made it for my darling's B'day and it's was a hit. I made this chocolate cake with the Authentic French Meringue from allrecipes with chopped chocolate for the topping. I call it Chocolate Meringue Cake. Only thing I did different was I cut the recipe in half and added 1tsp of pure Almond extract and I cut down the sugar of 1 cup to 3/4 cup for the cake and for the Meringue  the recipe calls for 2 and 1/4 cup of sugar for 4 egg whites for which I added only 3/4 cup of sugar. They are still yummy and sweet enough for my family's taste. I recommend this recipe and also watch the videos for tips and tricks. Also read the reviews for tips from fellow bakers. Happy Baking..

Perfect chocolate cake that you can take into different directions!  Rather than bake a layered cake or cupcakes, I opted for a bundt cake version and it came out delicious.  Took a some other users advice and used 1 cup of cocoa, (grocery store brand) and it came out moist, fluffy, and perfectly sweet.  Not salty at all or mushy like other reviews.  I have a wolf range which runs hot, but I still baked it for 30 mins and let it cool for about 30 minutes and it popped right out of the bundt cake pan.  Used a chocolate glaze recipe that I found on allrecipes for a very simple, yet decadent dessert.  This will be my go-to homemade chocolate cake recipe from now on!

As soon as I saw that a cup of boiling water was needing, I was a bit skeptic. However, it turned out incredibly well and the whole house loved it! It was moist and was pretty good; certainly better than I thought it would be!

I liked it the first time I made it. Since then I've adjusted it slightly by replacing the oil with a stick of melted unsalted butter, and replacing the cup of milk with a cup of water. Now I love it! Ya can't go wrong with butter...

Thank you shirleyo for sharing this recipe!  Such a beautifully moist cake!  The only change I made was to increase the cocoa to 1 cup and I sift it so there won't be any clumps.  I've made this and poked holes in it and poured a raspberry syrup over it once it cooled.  Friends and family love this recipe!!  Thanks again.

This is my go-to chocolate cake...really is a one bowl cake! As the recipe states, the batter is quite runny before baking but don't worry - it turns out fantastic. Everyone comments that my cakes are the most moist cakes they've had!

This is an excellent recipe. I prefer baking it in a 9 x 13 for 40 minutes. However this is the exact same recipe as the chocolate cake recipe on the back of the Hershey Co. Cocoa container. It also includes the 1 cup of boiling water.

Just made this last night. Wow!!! Just stop here folks and bake this cake! I altered the cocoa powder to dutch process cocoa at one full cup and used coconut oil. The consistency of the batter prebake is very loose. Fear not!!! This recipe will bake up into the most perfectly moist, rich cake ever! Hope my friend loves her birthday surprise!

This cake is so good. I baked mine an extra 10 minutes. It was fine. I greased the pans and placed parchment paper in them instead of greasing and flouring them. This cake had the exact flavor I was going for: nice chocolate, but not dry.

What a mess !!!!!  Baked exactly per instructions in 2 round 9 inch cake pans.  Ran over tops of pans while in oven and made huge mess in oven and burned onto oven.   Disaster   !!!  After baking;  Cake in the pan was very irregular and uneven on top.  It literally had hills and valleys instead of being level. 

HIGH ALTITUDE ALERT   !!!!!!!  We live at  5300 feet so that is only thing I can think of was the problem.  Tasted it and it had good flavor.

Made these (with a simple buttercream icing) for my sister's bridal shower.  Everyone loved them (including me).  Several people asked for the recipe.  I just couldn't stop eating them.  Followed the recipe exactly, except made them cupcakes and baked for 18 minutes.

My 3 boys made this cake all by themselves!  Not only was it incredibly easy (one bowl) but in was super moist and delicious!  This is your "go-to" chocolate cake recipe!

The best recipe for a relatively effortless cake. I was very impressed by the cake I baked for my husband's birthday. I followed the recipe word to word. I felt it needed more cocoa. So added more. The taste is divine. The cake is very light and keeps well in the fridge too. Love it love it love it.

This is the best chocolate cake recipe I have found. Once it has cooled completely, it doesn't even need frosting- so rich and moist.

This was so moist and kinda dense but so good!  I was leery when it said add boiling water to the mixture with the raw egg, I immediately thought ahhhhh! Scrambled eggs! But this was perfect. I read the comments and upped the cocoa powder to 1 cup and it was great. Its very rich so I think next time I'll do a cream cheese icing to break up the sweetness.

What a great and easy recipe.  I replaced the vegetable oil and milk with the same amounts of Plain Whole Yogurt (Sugar River Dairy out of Albany, WI), using the same amounts....

I also halved the sugar, added 3/4c. of Burgundy Chocolate pieces and to give it a Mexican spin, I added 1 1/2tsp. of Pampered Chef's Cinnamon blend and 1 tsp Cayenne pepper...my friends were raving at the decadent outcome! :)

...Also topped with Sugar River Dairy's Vanilla Yogurt

I have made this recipe many times. If ever I'm making a chocolate cake, this is the recipe I use. It is delicious as written, however I am making this for a wedding next week and tried substituting brewed coffee for the boiling water and it was even better! A couple of people who tasted it are not 'cake people' and decided it's not that they don't like cake, it's that they like good cake. They said this cake is delicious! My husband, who is not a cake person, said it was the best cake he's ever tasted.

This cake is a hit everytime I bake it! The only change I make is, instead of boiling water, I use brewed coffee. Yummy!

I love this recipe! The best chocolate cake I have ever had. I didn't have regular cake pans so I used a Bundt pan instead. And I topped it off with chocolate chips! The whole family loves this cake.

Very easy recipe to follow. Everyone loved it! Very moist and flavorful. Added the whipped creme cheese frosting with shaved chocolate as a garnish. This cake will satisfy anyone's craving for chocolate. Loved the fact that you only use one bowl to mix everything. I was a little nervous about the boiling water, but the layers were nice and fluffy. I used 2 - 9 inch round cake pans lined with wax paper. I sprayed the pans first with Pam and then inserted the wax paper. The batter was very thin. Once the layers were cool, removed the wax paper to continue to cool. Allow layers to cool completely before frosting. Made cake a day ahead and stored in refrigerator. Excellent!

Very good cake, and definitely making it again. I usually change the white sugar for brown one, but this time I only had half portion of the brown sugar so had to add the rest of white one. Came equally good and sweet for my husband and myself. Next time will try with just brown sugar and substitute oil for yogurt.

it is moist , rich , and delicious .. the cake is quite dense & fudgy. This is a deep, dark chocolate cake, but while this was a very good cake, I'll stick with the other because i think not suitable for every time.

I made this cake last night, my kids were very reluctant to eat it because I don't know how to bake. To my great surprise not only did the cake turn out great, but my kids ate it all in one night. Thank you for such a great recipe.

Taste like chocolate cake with chocolate pudding, but without the pudding!  Really good cake, will make again.  Made recipe as is, but with 1 cup of cocoa like one other review!  I have made this cake so many times, becoming my go to recipe.  3/19/17 I just made this cake with 2 standard cake round pans.  I did my best to be equal, but one cake spilled over slightly.  Not too big a deal, and it was fine layering with frosting later.   I did cook longer than 35 mins.  I also did this 2 round cake pan before, but I made a cupcake in addition...this helps with the spilling as 2 cake rounds are too small unless you have larger round cake pans.  3/22/17. I just made a 9x13 cake and cooked it for 45 mins.  It was a dark insulated cake pan...baked up nicely.  
I usually keep my cake in the fridge and frost them with buttercream frosting....super delicious!  Best homemade cake ever.  Itâs the only cake I make now for all the birthdays in my family.  I usually do a 9x13 insulated pan. Want to try cupcakes in the future.

Super easy to make! My cakes did not rise in the middle so I just ran a wire across to level for stacking. I let cakes cool 10 minutes before removing them and had no problems. I did as others suggested and increased cocoa to 1 cup. It tastes like a chocolate wafer and is so dense and moist! I have the cakes chilling in the fridge and am going to top with vanilla butter cream frosting. I would make this cake again!

Perfection!  I was worried after reading some of the reviews, but the cake came out of the pans easily and was not too soft.  I baked them in the evening.  I put them in plastic wrap and frosted them in the morning.  I prefer to frost cake when the layers are cold since it makes it so easy.  

I made a beautiful two layer cake with this cake.  Yum!  My go to recipe.

To be honest, I personally thought that the mix was too watery the minute I added the boiling water. Surprisingly, It came out great! It was a nice moist cake. Delicious! It was so good my family had no trouble at all licking the bowl! This is by far the best chocolate cake recipe there is!

This is a really great basic chocolate cake recipe. I've made it as cupcakes and as a layer cake and it worked well both ways. It's soft and moist, not dense or dry like some homemade cakes tend to be.

I increased the cocoa to 1 cup and used coconut oil in place of vegetable oil. I also have hungry teenagers so waiting 30 minutes wad too long. We make mini individual "cup" cakes by greasing a large ceramic cup or bowl and microwaving it for 1-1 1/2 minutes. A little powdered sugar on top....makes a nice snack cake.

It was amazing. So moist and fudgy. I was making this for a birthday party for the fisrt time. Im not afraid to take risks and everyone loved it. I like that it does not use that much flour and does not use any butter so that i can leave that for the frosting. Its also easy to make and very quick. This is the best cake i have ever tried. Wish i could give it 100,000 stars

I made this recipe for my Dad's 80th birthday and he loved it. I had no vegetable oil, so I just melted a stick of margarine and that worked fine! My family is already petitioning for me to make another cake!

This recipe isn't the greatest. The cake is dry and spongy- not the greatest flavor either. It DOES NOT come out of the pan.

This is my favourite chocolate cake recipe ever!! I've never used cake mixes, I admit, but I've tried lots of different chocolate cake's such as butter chocolate cake's and other things like that, and they were never fully up to my satisfaction. They were often dry and they hardened up in the fridge which made them even drier. When I tried this recipe I was doubtful, BUT!!!! it came out amazing!! It was gone in a few hours. This is my go to recipe for chocolate cake. Since it's oil based, it stay's moist and is so delicious. I will never go to another recipe for chocolate cake.

This is a very good, very chocolatey cake! I've made it 4 times now and it has been perfect every time! For those of you who are on a gluten free diet ... I needed a gluten free dessert to take to a dinner, this worked great! I substituted the regular flour with King Arthur Gluten Free flour and added slightly more than 1 1/2 teaspoons of xanthan gum powder (for better texture)and it came out great! I couldn't tell a difference. (The xanthan gum will make the batter thicker & not as thin as the regular batter. I also prepared the cake pan with the gluten free flour.)
Yes it is the same recipe on the Hershey's Cocoa can & I used the frosting recipe on the cocoa can, it was delicious also! I don't currently have a coffee maker so I put some instant coffee granules in the cup of boiling water. This will be my "go to" chocolate cake recipe from now on!

My family loves this cake and have been asking me to make it again for a while now. I have found that this tastes great with a peanut butter frosting layer in between the two layers of cake with chocolate frosting on the outside. Heaven on earth.

This right here!  This recipe right here!  It is the best hands down basic chocolate cake recipe, you do not need to look any further.  Easy to make, and bakes up very nicely as a 13x9 cake.  Frost it up, scoop out your portion and sit down for a relaxing evening dessert!  You will not be disappointed!

After an hour and five minutes in the oven, I was able to feel confident that this was a cake and not soup.  Still a little too moist in the middle but I was able to invert onto a large plate without any mess or crumbling.  The cake was very spongy looking.  I left it be for about ten minutes to cool and came back to a huge crack down the middle.  I started to ice the cake but it was still too warm so I let it cool in front of our AC for about ten minutes.  I cut off two pieces for my husband and myself to try.  I iced the pieces individually with homemade peanut butter frosting.  The cake itself didn't taste like much of anything and seemed under done everywhere but the very edges witch were crunch.  I do not plan on making this cake again.

My whole family loves this cake! I found it and made it for my sons first birthday and just made it for his 3rd birthday! It works great as a layer cake with peanut butter frosting and chocolate shavings in the middle and buttercream frosting on the outside! I'm making it again today for my daughters first birthday with cream cheese frosting! So easy and comes out perfect every time!

I thought this cake was great.  I was worried about the soup it turned into before putting it in the oven, but wow.  I did up the cocoa just because I am a chocoholic and always do.  Also, we are very big on nutritious foods, so even "junk" food gets a healthy upgrade here.  I used coconut oil in place of oil, and it did not give it a coconut taste as an FYI. I used coconut milk in place of regular milk, and 1/4 c egg whites instead of an egg.  I made my own butter frosting, which I did tweak to make healthier than a standard.  That came out good, but I am not 100 % happy with it, so I won't share until I have it right.

Made as a cake first and was delicious...moist and great flavor. I did use hald the recommended vanilla and sub 1/4 tsp. almost extract for the other half. My kids loved it so much they ate it before I even had time to frost. I tried to make the second batch as cupcakes...that didn't work so well. Taste was off and they were a little flat. Otherwise so delicious!

I used this recipe to make cupcakes! The best cupcakes I've ever made. I didn't have any vanilla though but it didn't bother the taste. So dense and moist! My new favorite. No more boxed cake in this house.

The cake itself was amazing!!!!! You need to keep the cake in the pan for the entire 10 minutes or else it is still hot and mine crumbled. When making the batter, after including the hot water, it looks like a pudding almost and is VERY moist. I used the chocolate cake with buttercream frosting and it was fantastic. I would highly suggest this to a friend!!!!

Awesome recipe!  Turns out perfect with the right shiny texture on top...the first couple of times I halved th portion and tried it.this time around I made it in two pans...turned out great and junior who is my official taster loved it. I watched the video and found it useful.I used hersheys cocoa and had to bake abt 45 min. This is definitely my go-to chocolate cake recipe now,quick and fool proof.I haven't tried icing it yet.

I got a hankering for some chocolate cake the other night. I have always always been a box lady. Well last night the urge didn't stop. I knew I had Caco and I said, I'm going to make a chocolate cake. Got to mixing then realized I didn't have any milk. i wanted this so bad I went and bought the milk came home an dmade this cake.   All I can say is * I WILL ALWAYS MAKE THIS CHOCOLATE CAKE*, it came out PERFECT. My first time not getting a hard crust.  not not overly sickening sweet chocolate. Just absolute perfect.  Love the quickness and it's so good.

This is by far the best chocolate cake ever! I read the reviews and added the additional cocoa to total 1 cup.  Also due to allergy's I used coconut milk. I couldn't wait for it to cool down!!  I will never make another recipe!

I think it was fantastic. I halved the sugar, upped eggs cacao to one cup as suggested and then two tea spoons of instant espresso into the boiling water. I also substituted a tea spoon of vanilla for orange oil extract. Tasted just like Terry's orange dark chocolate balls. Fabulous basic recipe!

When I use the Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa, I don't up the cocoa to a cup.  The Dark Cocoa is much richer. And instead of 1 cup water, I add 1 cup coffee.  This truly enhances the chocolate flavor.

Great cake recipe.  This will be my new go to recipe.
I used it for Brown Derby Cake and it was perfect!  I substituted butter for oil.  I will bump up cocoa to 1 cup next time.

Oh my goodness, this cake is perfect!! I was quite leary of the thinness of the batter, but it baked up so light and fluffy, and despite it's whopping two cups of sugar, is not actually too sweet! So often home-made, from-scratch chocolate cakes are dense, flavorless doorstops. Not this cake! It tastes chocolatey and airy, like a boxed cake mix without all the preservatives, not to mention it is incredibly easy and fast to make. Two thumbs up!

Made this for my twins 2 yr old birthday party (along with a yellow cake receipe). This cake was hands down fabulous (moist and tasty) and better than the yellow cake one I made off wiltons' website. Followed the receipe exactly. the only downside was the outside of cake was sticky (because it was moist) so a bit hard to ice.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday and everyone loved it.  I usually don't care much for chocolate cake but this was the best I have ever tasted.  It was really moist and chocolaty and very easy to make.  I baked it for 35 minutes and frosted it with chocolate cream cheese icing.

I just baked my first cake from scratch yesterday and I used this recipe.  I must say, it was amazing!!!!!  The cake was moist and flavorful.  I baked a chocolate cake for my wife for mothers day and she absolutely loved it.  She was shocked I made something this good. :)  It came out perfect and the recipe is written to where any one can follow it and produce superior results every time!

This is by far the most delicious cake I have ever made. I was a bit hesitant to make a cake from scratch, but I decided to give it a try, and I am glad I did! It was delicious and moist with a very chocolatey flavour. I used a chocolate buttercream icing, and it was great! Everyone loved it! Best cake I have ever tasted, I would give it 10 stars if I could!!!

Delicious! Halved the recipe to make 12 cupcakes (~30min baking time). Also, I used 1/2 a cup of cocoa powder (instead of 1/4 cup and 2 teaspoons). Thank you!

Absolutely fabulous chocolate cake recipe...and pair it with the fluffy bp frosting and they're just aren't words to describe the yumminess that occurs!!  After reading reviews I did use strong coffee instead of plain boiling water.  I will never use another chocolate cake recipe again!

Made cupcakes as directed. Amazing! I topped these with a popular chocolate frosting from this site and even stuffed some with frozen cookie dough. I made these for my sons first birthday, everyone was talking about them. My husband took leftovers to work and I think everyone fell in love with me.

This is my go to chocolate cake! It is so moist and delicious, and pretty sturdy for icing. I usually make it with a simple powdered sugar vanilla icing and it stays fresh for days. It is so easy to make but good enough for a special occasion like a birthday - I made it for my husband's birthday and he said it was the best cake I had ever made.

This is by far one of the best homemade cake recipes I've ever tested. The cake came out perfect, and was nice and moist. I didn't change anything. My daughter hates homemade cakes, she prefers box cakes. Today she asked me to make this cake for her b-day next year!  I used chocolate ganache as my filling and chocolate buttercream for my frosting.

I used this to make come chocolate cupcake a while back. I was a little worried at first when the batter got so thin after adding the water but they came out beautifully. This is just as easy as using a box mix but your result is SO MUCH BETTER! Thanks shirleyo!!

I wanted a simple cake recipe that I could make without a major shopping trip. I saw this recipe and thought, why not??? I found the recipe very easy and had all the ingredients in my pantry. After reading the reviews I opted to increase the cocoa to 1 cup. The only complaint I have is that it would not come out of my pan... I used a bundt pan and baked it for 30 minutes and left it in the oven an additional 10 minutes after shutting the oven off. I let it cool almost 20 minutes before trying to get it out of the pan and the top still stuck, I prepped the pan like I do any other cake pan. After I frosted it though you couldn't even tell it broke. My husband ate 1/3 in the first sitting. This is a very rich, dense cake and the flavor was spectacular. I didn't use anything fancy, I even used a generic cocoa powder. Very simple and easy... I will defiantly make this cake again!

I give this recipe a 6! I am not a chocolate cake lover, but I fell in love with this recipe. I used a regular easy icing to cover the whole cake and a a chocolate mascoponi chocolate frosting between  the layers and for fancy decorating. Decorated with strawberries as well . It was Devine! Followed the recipe exactly! It turned out better than a shop bought cake. The best part was how easy and fuss free it was, and  the taste was superb. 
 This is definitely a keeper and the type of recipe that will be handed down to family and friends.
Thanks so much for sharing.

Followed the original recipe with no amendments. Very simple to bake and can be done within 10 min. The texture of the cake is moist, however I find it a little dense. It went well with peanut butter frosting.

Just baked it! Turned out spongy and yummy! I used a silicon mould and a non stick one, didn't greese and was easy to remove both cakes. I didn't have milk, so I used 3 tbsp of powdered milk with a cup of water. Definitely you have to let it cool for hours b4 eating. It's a bit dry, so I'm thinking about a soft frost. :)

I was shocked at how easy it was to make. I've only made a cake out of a box before this. I did this as a surprise for my wife's birthday. We both loved it. Very moist cake but not overly rich. If you like more chocolate flavor add more cocoa powder. I did add a little orange zest to the batter because I like that flavor with chocolate. I will do this one again!

I tried this and added about half a cup extra of cocoa. It turned out pretty awesome! I made some homemade icing to go with it.  3 cups powdered sugar, 3/4 cup cocoa, a stick of softened butter, 1 tsp of vanilla extract, and 1/4 cup of milk. I cook a lot but never tried baking anything so this was my first baking experience. I must say I was very pleased with myself and how it turned out!!

Couldn't be easier or more delicious!  Followed recipe exactly as written.  I used mini bundt pans and baked for 20 minutes.  Very moist and chocolatey.  Someone mentioned that is even better the second day and I would agree.

My first cake from scratch, and I LOVE this recipe! Someone else mentioned it's not great for layer cakes. That is correct - it's spongy, moist and wonderfully squishy, so perhaps a recipe with more flour or butter instead of oil is advisable for a sturdier cake that doesn't become a squishy mess when you try to cut it. I however, love my cake that way! :)

Delicious!!! The only alteration I did was instead of 1 cup of boiling water I did 1/2 cup of boiling water and 1/2 cup of freshly brewed coffee.

This cake was delicious! So tasty and soft and super easy to make. I used melted butter instead of oil and took the recommendations from other reviews to up the cocoa. Also, I used a hand whisk as I do not have an electric mixer and the batter was just fine. I was able to layer the two cakes with vanilla frosting with no issues.

Absolutely fabulous My family loves dessert - especially chocolate cake. I seriously doubt this 9" cake could serve 24 people! I doubled the recipe and got 28 servings from an 11x17" pan. I used 5 cups of flour, and used hot coffee instead of hot water. I also added 1 tbsp of cinnamon,3/4 cup brown sugar, coffee creamer instead of milk, and added 1/4 cup orange zest. I greased and floured an 11"x17" and baked the cake at 355 degrees for 55 minutes. This is an awesome cake, especially when frosted with peanut butter/chocolate frosting (a family favorite)! For my version of this recipe check my recipe box!

This was not a good cake to make a layer cake out of. It was extremely difficult to get out of the cake pan. | made the cake twice thinking I may have made an error in the recipe but it came out just as bad the second time.

Without a doubt the best chocolate cake I've ever made. The recipe is as simple as a box mix, very quick and easy. Don't be afraid of how water-y it is when you put it in the oven. Because of the deep pans I use (6x3in) I use a lower baking heat (325) and longer baking time, about 40-45 minutes. Came out moist and dense. It is a bit crumbly when it initially comes out but like all cakes, I out mine in plastic wrap, then the freezer for a few hours.

Amazing! This recipe was so easy to assemble! I added melted white chocolate on top after the cake cooled which was absolutely delicious. The cake baked nicely and tastes absolutely amazing! Cheers to the moist cake, you can't go wrong with this recipe!

INCREDIBLE! This cake was delicious! Moist, rich, and hits the spot. For chocolate lovers only. The frosting was to die for. I made this on Saturday and my husband has already asked when I will be making another and it's only Monday! :)

This recipe is great! I searched the comments to see if anyone had made it with almond milk no luck :( 
I decided to try it anyway and it turned out great!! 
If your going to layer it be sure that you let it cool completely so it does not fall apart when you pick it up.

I've made 'one bowl' chocolate cakes before and they turned out pretty good but for some reason this one had a bizarre aftertaste. Not sure if it was the cocoa - I used Tollhouse cocoa, brand new/fresh. I followed the recipe exactly. I'm a bit confused what kind of cocoa was implied here though - I believe the one I used was regular cocoa, not Dutch-processed, but with regular cocoa you use baking SODA to neutralize the acid and with Dutch-processed you use baking POWDER, yet this recipe uses BOTH. Why? Not sure. In any event, the cake had a decent texture but the aftertaste ruined it. Sad as I made it as a birthday cake.

The best and easiest chocolate cake I have ever made, and all in one bowl!!! I followed the recipe exactly , EXCEPT followed the suggestion of reviewers and upped the cocoa to one cup. Delicious and moist and keeps well, not sure why others had such trouble with it and over flowing .

I tried this recipe for cupcakes. They were very moist however they fell when cooling. It could have been my baking powder was too old, didn't think so, they other issue could have been oven temp but just had the oven repaired and temp has been perfect. I can try again as a cake but definitely a no for cupcakes!

I've been looking for a perfect chocolate cake recipe and has yet to find one until this! One thing I changed was, I mixed the boiling water with 1.5 teaspoon instant coffee. Now, my search is over!

It is a good recipe, and it should be because it is from the back of Hershey's cocoa powder.

I have made this cake SO MANY TIMES! It has never failed. It's moist and so chocolatey! My favorite thing about this cake, though, is how well it holds together. It never falls apart when I take it out of the pan. I can pick it up with my hands and it stays together. It's great for making tiered or specially shaped cakes. My favorite way to make it though is with cream cheese frosting and a raspberry filling. I never alter the recipe and it always cooks perfectly!

I went with the added advice of a full cup of cocoa and instant coffee to the boiling water.  I've NEVER made such perfect - moist - delicious cake!  I also did the 9x13 pan for 40 minutes.  Even with the store bought frosting that I had on hand - the cake was memorable. My future son-in-law had 3 very large pieces!

I do a lot of baking and this is by far the best chocolate cake recipe I have come across. It's very easy to make- not much harder than using a mix from a box (but oh so much better)! I would give this more than 5 stars if I could.

As other reviewers have said, do not be turned off by the thin batter. It's SUPPOSED to be that way. The water is what makes this cake so incredibly moist.

For a frosting recipe, I took the advice of another reviewer who provided her grandmother's chocolate frosting recipe to go with this cake. It's review #13 on this page. I give the frosting 5 stars as well!

Ok, not really special.  Made according to recipe.  Turned out dry and not extremely chocolaty as I expected.  It was easy to put together but won't go out of my way to make again.

It is a rich and dense cake, and like other reviewers, I found it a bit tricky to stack as a layer cake because it was just so moist and heavy, but I was able to keep it together in the end. I used 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 tsp of almond extract, and I used half almond milk and half dairy milk. It gave it a darker, more exotic flavor. By far the best tasting chocolate cake I've made.

This was a great cupcake project for my 7 year old daughter.  She made the batter practically by herself.  The runny batter made it a little messy when filling the cupcake liners but still a success.  After baking we cut the tops to make them level with the liners.  She frosted and decorated on her own.  It was very easy and quite an accomplishment for her!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was wonderful! The best chocolate cake I have ever made. I made it in a 9x13 pan and frosted it while it was still a little warm (with store-bought frosting!) and the frosting just melted and made a very rich, fudgy cake.  I kept it in the fridge and was just as delicious for the next couple of days until it was gone!

Whipped this cake up as an impromptu dessert this past weekend and was pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was.  This recipe produced a decadent, moist cake that my family and I greatly enjoyed.  As per other reviewers, I did have a bit of a problem with one of them sticking to the pan despite being properly greased.  In the future I will line with parchment for easier removal.  Awesome cake! Highly recommend!

To be honest I was expecting completely a different cake... I made it twice, thinking that maybe I did something wrong the first time, but no. It is just not my type of cake. It comes out too spongey, like it is made of rubber or missing baking powder... The taste is not that great ether... It lacks chocolate in my opinion. Thank god my boyfriend would eat anything...

Great recipe!  Instead of cake form however, I halved the ingredients and made 12 deliciously moist and fluffy cupcakes.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to get unsweetened cocoa powder so I used hot chocolate mix and it turned out great (you can lessen the sugar if you use hot chocolate mix).  Do not worry about the watery consistency, it'll turn out great in the end!

I'll never make a boxed chocolate cake again! This was my first attempt at a cake from scratch and I'm so thankful it was with this recipe and I wouldn't change a thing about it, it was perfect, moist and even better the next day. Thanks so much!!!

This recipe is great! If you use self rising flour vs all purpose (which is what I done) cut out the salt & baking soda. I also added 8oz of cream cheese! Frosted with a chocolate cream cheese frosting. Devine! The cream cheese cuts down the sweetness just enough for those who fuss things are too sweet, but not too much for the sweet lovers! It's a win win!

I made this in a bundt pan with a chocolate glaze. Very pretty and tasty.  Glad the recipe mentioned that the batter is thin or I would have been worried. I cooked it for about 50 minutes to ensure it was done.

Perfect, easy and quick! I even substituted some ingredients to make a healthier virgin. Whole wheat flour for white flour. Instead of 2 cups sugar, one and a half cup honey. I didn't even have baking soda so I added an extra half spoon baking powder and didn't fill the one cup oil to th brim, cause honey had a lot of liquid. And like other reviewers said I put 1 cup cocoa and it was perfect.

This was so delicious.  After adding the boiling water the batter was so thin I thought for sure it wouldn't turn out but it wound up being fantastic.  I used a 13 x 9 cake pan, greased but not floured and baked it for about 35 minutes.  I was nervous after reading the negative reviews but the taste and texture were perfect.  My husband and I both agreed that it came out way better than a boxed mix.

this is the recipe on the hershey cocoa can. i use buttermilk instead of milk, coffee instead of hot water and sprinkle cocoa powder instead of flour in the pans.  it's so easy and delicious, people are always asking me to bring this cake to gatherings. if you're making cupcakes, make sure you barely fill with the batter, it does rise alot and will overflow your cupcake tins.

I have been baking this cake recipe for years. I buy the Special dark cocoa. My company praise the cake every time.   I suggest making your frosting from the recipe on the container instead of premade store boughten frosting.  Much better

I had to make a cake at the last minute and this recipe was perfect. It took me no time to prepare using basically one bowl.  I thought I may have ruined the recipe because I added the boiling water before I mixed all the other ingredients first, but it still turned our just beautiful.  I frosted and filled the cake with a whipped cream chocolate icing.  My guests loved it!

I stick the cake in the freezer straight from the oven. It turns out extremely moist. I also make a chocolate ganache to spread over the top once it's cooled. Best chocolate cake ever.

This is the BEST cake chocolate cake recipe I have ever used!! Though Iwas kind of bummed when it crumbled out of the pan.. However, I don't blame the recipe.. it is just me. Anytime I bake a chocolate cake it never comes out of the pan in one piece [[this is only when I bake chocolate cake from scratch]] but I used this same recipes for cupcakes and they came out perfect!! No I have delicious cup cakes and cake crumbles for the beginnings of cake balls ;)

Great cake! Took advice, upped cocoa to one cup, added 1 tsp of coffee to boiling water. My cake was a bit overdone at 30 minutes, but my oven is hot. I generally need to reduce the cooking time. I halved the recipe, no problem. It needs a frosting, I used a Ree Drummond chocolate, pecan frosting made warn on stove and poured over the cake. I only had Hershey's cocoa on hand, but would use a higher quality cocoa next time., this recipe was on the back label. It would definitely be richer in taste using a higher end cocoa. Also loved that I had all ingredients in my pantry, no shopping required for this last minute cake for company. Served it with fresh raspberries, was a success.

I'm an accomplished cook and baker and this chocolate cake is absolutely fantastic. I bumped up the cocoa to 1 cup as other viewers recommended and it was delicious. I omitted all coffee since the people that were eating it don't care for coffee. Instead of a chocolate frosting I made a banana butter cream. Yum. Excellent recipe.

I was craving a good chocolate cake and saw this recipe.  I loved that it took one bowl.  I followed the directions exactly since I'd never made it before; however, I could't get it out of the pans in one piece.  Forturnately I got enough out to try to layer it and since it was just for me, I didn't mind.  I taste very delicious and was moist.  I will probably try it again if I can figure out how to get it out of the pan in one piece.

Wonderful, moist and rich cake.  I moved to South Africa and this cake can be made successfully with the ingredients available here in an oven that is sketchy compared to my American oven.  Love it and I am so glad to be able to make a great cake again!!!

I made the recipe double!
I poured some caramel in the holes when it was baked.
My icing was whipped cream with chunks of Skors.
The best cake ever!

Very moist cake and delicious, it's good by itself, which is not very likely for a chocolate cake , I made in in 9*13 inches pan, bake for 40 min because it's I used pyrex and didn't preheat, I usually like cakes hot but not this one, after it gets cold put it in the fridge and then try to test it you won't regret!

I think this cake is just wonderful. I made it as is and it turned out perfect. I baked it in a 9 x 13 Pan for 40 minutes. This is my new quick chocolate cake. Thanks Shirleyo.

Second Time Around we were lucky with this Cake. Lots of taste and good texture; Next time we will add some more flour, though, as we want it a bit less wet.

Our recommendation: Use the following Icing:

This is my favorite chocolate cake recipe I have ever made. It was moist and delicious! I have baked it for alot of parties and people always beg for more! I always make my own butter cream icing to frost it. Its the cherry on top.

I have made this cake twice. The first time everything came out great. This time, I made cupcakes and they were very dense and dry. I don't know if there was something I did wrong with the recipe or maybe this just doesn't work for cupcakes.

Great cake recipe. Easy to make.

In whose world does this make 24 servings? The nutritional information should be adjusted to use 12 servings.

My two-year old made this cake and it turned out great. We altered the recipe in the following ways: 1) one heaping tablespoon of dry ingredients were removed from the mixing bowl, dumped on the counter, then scraped off the counter and returned to the bowl. 2) the vanilla was forgotten 3) the boiling water was added the the other ingredients before mixing, so that some of the eggs cooked onto the side of the mixer bowl. My husband swore it was ruined and it was still great! Talk about foolproof.

This recipe is super easy to make and it is very delicious. The cake turned out very moist and soft. I will not be using a cake mix ever again... the first time I made it, we eat it hot with ice cream and my family loved it. I was a little worried because I could taste the baking soda in it but the next day the taste was gone. Thanks  
Shirley for the recipe!!!

After baking this cake, I will never need, nor would I ever want to buy a cake from a box again (or bakery for that matter).  We tried this cake without any frosting at all that might disguise or enhance its flavor and it was everything a chocolate cake should be.  Rich, moist, substantial, yet with a tender, spongy crumb.  We increased the chocolate by 1/4 cup and used plain old water (no coffee on hand).  Enjoy this recipe!

Amazing cake! I have now made this a few times, and it is always the most moist, flavourful cake I have ever had. It gets rave reviews from the other people eating it too. It looks like it's going to be too watery, but it's turns out perfect. I find it great for a tiered cake as it is firm enough to hold up to some extra weight but still delicious!

I love this recipe it is so easy anyone can make it!! And it only takes one bowl too! So no mess. It is a very moist cake so you can leave it in too long but not too short either! Or else it falls apart! But I love this recipe it has become my main cake recipe

I love this recipe! I used it to make cupcakes for a church picnic, and they were gone fast! The cake was delicious and moist, and the peanut butter buttercream I made to go on top was, well the icing on the (already fantastic) cake...haha! And who cares if this is the recipe from the Hershey's Cocoa Can as others have pointed out, I wouldn't have found it there anyway since my cocoa isn't Hershey's... Thanks for sharing!!

Had to rush to make a cake for my son's birthday after realizing that a cake mix I had bought had sulphites in it which we are allergic to. This absolutely saved the day. I had all ingredients on hand and was whipped up in no time. I did use 1 cup of cocoa thanks to some suggestions of the reviewers. This will be my new go to recipe for birthday cakes since everyone wants chocolate on their birthdays. I topped it with the no boil chocolate fudge icing recipe from the Betty Crocker cookbook. Everyone loved it. It also tastes just as good the next day.

Awesome, easy recipe that yields a delicious, light crumb cake with a beautiful dark color. The strategy that worked best for me was to make it and frost it two days before I wanted to serve it-- this gave it time to mature and become very moist. I have served it sooner but the cake seems drier and denser. I put it in a 9x13 pan but did need to bake it about 8 minutes longer than indicated in the recipe.

This is an excellent cake. I baked it in one 9'' tall pan and created 4 layers using a cake saw. I layered it with caramel pudding and minced nuts. I also moistened it with cocoa liquor for more flavour. Then I frosted it with whipped cream. In order to create a beautiful layered cake at home, the cake itself must be cold so that it does not melt the pudding inside. Really great base cake for layering.

Almost perfection! I would have given 4.5 stars but that is not an option. The only reason I didn't rate this recipe 5 stars is because I would like it to be a tiny bit more moist. Other than that it was fantastic, this will be my chocolate cake recipe. And I loved the tip about adding a whole cup of cocoa, it was super chocolatey just like I like it.

This cake is amazing!!! I bake it with wheat flour or replace it with gluten free flour. Every time comes out great!!
I use german chocolate cake filling with it.... or just add some almond essence.

Substituted 9 ounces melted chocolate (57% cocoa) for the cocoa, reduced sugar to 1.5 cups, and made into cupcakes. Scrumptious.

I made cupcakes from this recipe, and I have got to say that this is the best recipe for chocolate cake EVER. I baked them for 20 minutes and they turned out amazing! They were soft and moist and simply delicious. My family couldn't get enough!

Definitely will not be making this again. I added 2 tablesspoons of flaxseed soaked in 2 tablespoons of water and  I subbed applesauce for the oil...which I have done a million times and can never tell the difference.  And subbed 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour for the white flour...which could have made it so dense. It was VERY dense and had very little chocolate flavor...the frosting I put on it over powered any chocolate flavor in the cake and I was very generous with the cocoa powder and short on the sugar because we don't like things over sweet.

I made this for my son's BDay party and everyone LOVED it. I even had one person say that they had not had cake that good since they were a kid. I made the recipe as is, no adjustments. I made it twice, the first with a store brand cocoa and the second with a higher quality brand. Both were good but the the second was definitively better. This will be my go-to chocolate cake recipe, no more box cakes for sure!

This cake is amazing! Its definitely a family favourite! My sister doesn't like cake, and she likes this one. Probably because it's not super sweet. But it's sweet enough for the rest of us! 

-We follow the recipe exactly (except changing the boiling water with juice, coffee, etc. sometimes), except we use two round pans with at least two cupcakes, so it doesn't overflow, which it does easily. 
-If you make cupcakes out of these, don't expect a big round dome top. 
-Be careful when stirring after adding the boiling water, stir s l o w l y ! 
-This cake is very yummy and moist, and is even better the second or third day, so don't be afraid to make it ahead of time! 
-Although I agree with other reviewers, not the easiest to get out of the pan, even when you spray a lot. 
-I really like that it's in one bowl, and a lot of the same measuring cup, less clean up!

When I make this cake, the middle seems to fall in. When it is in the oven it rises nicely, as soon as I get it out, it falls. What am I doing wrong? However it is very tasty!

LOVE this recipe! Use boiling coffee instead of boiling water for extra chocolate flavor. If making cupcakes, bake 15 min at 350 F for regular cupcakes and 11 minutes at 325 F for mini cupcakes.  I've also used for a layer cake and it works well.  Just cut off the top so it is flat.

This cake turned out so delicious. Just the right moisture and density. It was easy to follow. I used the icing recipe from "Extreme Chocolate Cake", by Rach56. And after making this I will never return to frosting out of a can. Yum!!!

This cake is SO moist and delicious. This is what REAL chocolate cake should taste like.  You just can't go back to using boxed cake mix after making it. It's also really nice to only have to use one bowl. Everytime I make it, people always rave about how yummy it is. I usually frost it with a cream cheese icing.

By the way, yes you can make a 2-layer cake. I made 2 circular cakes, layered chocolate icing on the bottom one, and plopped the 2nd cake on top of it, and then coated the chocolate icing on the top one. Stuck it in the fridge... So delicious. You'll love it. Don't forget to put a nice coating of crisco while baking, it'll come out just fine.

but the easiest! 
all the ingredients are kitchen staples & its very minimal cleanup.
i cut back to 1.5 cups sugar (just to be healthy) but alas, this was a BAD idea.... (my hubby's comment: "hmmm..sugarless cake?"
i also used non-fancy nestle cocoa powder & i brewed a tiny amount of kona coffee for my boiling water.
the batter before adding the water was really clumpy &  after i added the water, it was not super runny.
not dry, not sticky sweet, but if youre craving chocolate & you want it fresh,here ya go!
i'll make this again (w/ the 2 cups sugar..screw my health)

I just made this recipe for my dad's birthday - he turned 58 and chocolate cake is his favorite!  It turned out GREAT!  I used two 8" pans instead of 9" because that's all I had. They worked perfectly, didn't even have to cook it very much longer.  I stuck to the recipe as listed and I couldn't have been happier!

Just made this. It's perfect. I replaced 1/2 of the flour with barley flour and did 1.5 c sugar and it was perfect. I could take the sugar down to 1 cup or even 3/4 cup and it would be plenty sweet for us.

so so so so so very easy to put together. A relative newbie to cakes like me could put it together in a jiffy. The cake turned out moist and fluffy like other reviewers pointed out. I made absolutely no changes to the recipe except for using canola oil instead of vegetable oil as I did not have the same. I used a spring foam cake pan and it was very easy to pull out the cake. No trouble at all! I made is as a Christmas treat to my staff and it was gone in a flash! I personally felt it could be a bit sweeter but hey, lesser calories is good right? Thank you Shirleyo, I loved this recipe and its a keeper! Planning to try it with chocolate sauce and ice-cream. yum!  :)

I used evaporated milk, a little bit less sugar, a little bit  more cocoa powder, and I didn't have vanilla extract so I didn't use it. I made cupcakes out of it, and it was okay.

I took the suggestion of a few others and upped the cocoa powder to 1 cup.  I followed everything else exactly as the recipe states. I don't own any round pans, so I did a 9x13 for 40 minutes and it turned out great!  Very moist and super chocolatey!  One thing to note though, is that it makes a much thicker cake than boxed cake mix does.  I was able to get half of mine out of the pan in one piece and froze it to have another time!

This cake was really simple to make and tasted delicious! Good chocolate taste and really moist. I followed the recipe exactly. I read other reviews that said the cake stuck to the pan and fell out in chunks, but I had no issue with this. I greased the pans well and let cool for about 15 minutes before removing them. Definitely will make again!

This was AMAZING.  

I'll never make a boxed cake again.  I should add that I used 1/2 cup of melted butter rather than the oil as well as 1 cup heavy cream rather than the milk.  It's so moist and fabulous!!!

I am actually not sure if I have reviewed this before, but even if I did it is worth doing again :]  This is absolutely the BEST cake I have ever had.  I have read some reviews that state husbands who don't like cake but love this, and my husband is no different-not a cake fan, but loves this one.  I am not sure what some reviewers mean by too moist, this cake is so moist I had a hard time getting it out of the pans sometimes, even buttered and floured first, but that is what makes it good, we hate dry cakes!!  I will never buy another ready made or box mix ever again, this is my only cake!!!

So good!! My parents loved this and asked me to make it again. The only thing that went wrong is I think I took it out of the pan to soon cause it broke in half. Next time i'll wait longer and hopefully it won't happen again. Other wise it tasted like real chocolate cake and was so moist! Thanks!

I have made this several times. Great and quick as is.
I have tweaked it a bit and added 1/2 cup cocoa instead of 1/4 cup. also make sure you DO NOT overbake ..25 minutes is perfect as it still cooks in the pan!!

This recipe was easy to follow. I substituted the all-purpose flour with cake flour (simply because I had 3 boxes of it in my pantry). This was the first time I've ever made a cake from scratch. The cake came out moist & was DELICIOUS!

I just baked this cake for my step - daughter's birthday.  She, like the rest of the family, is a chocolate lover and I know she will love it because I scraped the cake from the bottom & sides of tube pan & it's moist, chocolatey & delicious.I followed another reviewer's advice and used a full cup of cocoa powder.  I used the tube pan and it was a challenge getting it out of the pan because it is so moist.  Out of sheer desperation, I folded parchment paper, four pieces thick, cut a hole in the middle, put it over tube ( had manged to get the rim part off without too much damage)said a prayer and gently flipped it over.  It worked. I set it on cake saver plate and frosted with chocolate ganache, then trimmed off the messy paper around the edges.  Had already thrown out the leftover coffee from breakfast & didn't want to make a pot so I made a cup of "International Delight" vanilla latte instant.  I also added an extra teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of cinnamon. Voila! Will definitely make this one again.

I needed a last minute cake to make for a friend who LOVES chocolate... made it in not time at all and added bournville coco powder really chocolatiy flavour.  Tried a bit of the side and tasted so moist.  Added a dark ganache and had to like the spoon, yum yum, shame to waste it.  Hopefully my friend will love this all to himself as his wife does not like chocolate cake.  How could anyone NOT like chocolate cake ? Thankyou to whoever put this fabulouse receipe will never make another type of chocolate cake again, so easy

This was delicious!!! I made the recipe as stated (24 serves) in one huge tray and it was great.  I think for the family I will halve the quantity (possibly increase cocoa and cut sugar back a bit - 55g and 175 g respectively), but make it otherwise as stated

This cake is a nice cake for someone not wanting anything too rich. The only thing I did different to this recipe was that instead of mixing the dry ingredients and wet ingredients seperate then adding them together, I just put it all in and mixed it at once because it makes for a moister cake. Just make sure to add the boiling water last no matter how you mix the rest of the ingredients. The cake sticks to the pans pretty good even with shortening and flour so I'll use wax paper to line my pans next time. Darn good cake!

This chocolate cake is divine. It was a big hit & even the not so crazy about chocolate cake people enjoyed it. It's super most & pairs well with Rich Chocolate Frosting.

I made this for my wife for her birthday. I doubled the recipe, and also made cupcakes for our girls to eat. Let me say.. this is THE moistest cake I have EVER eaten. It stayed moist for a few days just sitting on the counter, and was super rich and chocolatey! LOVE IT!

Made this one day on a whim, and it turned out so amazing. All of my roommates were shocked it was from scratch. Note that it will be extremely watery when it goes into the oven (I really thought I had messed up somehow), and that the tip to butter and flour the pans works really well- This cake is super moist, so it's much easier to get out of the pan that way.

I was very optimistic about this recipe as it has a good rating by a large number of people.  The cake did not turn out well.  It sunk in the middle and did not taste very good.  It must be me since everyone else loves it.....

This is my go-to recipe for birthdays and special occasions.  I love this recipe!  The cake is so moist and rich.  I usually end up baking cupcakes with it instead of actually baking a cake, and it is super easy to convert!  My friends and family beg me for this recipe!

I made cupcakes and this recipe is TOO moist. The cupcakes really tasted underbaked, and I made a point to overbake them. Maybe as a cake it works better.

YES!! This cake recipe is fantastic: perfect flavor, perfect moisture and so, so easy! I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I mixed it manually as I don't have a mixer. I made it one day in advance, as I read a review that advised so for the best flavor, and I used Ghirardelly unsweetened cocoa. This cake was so good that my quest for the perfect chocolate cake is officially over!!!!

Wow, delicious!!  Made cupcakes instead of the cake, baked 18 mins, made 24 regular size and 10 mini's.  Tried lots of chocolate recipes and this is by far the best.  Batter is quite thin when pouring, but this is normal.  Have to fill cupcakes about 2/3 to 3/4 full as they do not rise a lot.  Paired with the Rich Chocolate Frosting recipe from this site as well, what a treat!!!!

I picked this recipe because it had such great reviews. I used this recipe for cupcakes and they turned out awful. First they didn't rise, the middle of each cupcake was caved in, the ousides ran onto my cupcake pan and were crispy. The cupcakes stuck to the liner and the cupcake fell apart. I am so glad I tested one before taking these cupcakes to my sons school. What a disaster that would be for kindergarteners. I am on my way to buy a box cake to bake. Next time I will make a practice run when trying a new recipe. I will NOT be trying this one again.

I didn't bother sifting anything and it still turned out great. The batter was enough for 2 9-inch round cakes abot 1.5-2 inches each in height.  This cake is super moist and it tastes even better when it's cold fom the fridge.

Very easy to make and better than any box mix.  When I need to make something quickly but want to make it from scratch (which is 99% of the time), this is my fall-back recipe.  Just make sure you grease the pan well because the cake can sometimes stick.

I use a cup of cocoa in the cake and bake in 9 x 13 pan for 35 min on 325. I add more milk to the frosting.

First off...make it the day before...it is sooo good after its sat...second...I doubled the recipe because I made a 13x3" cake round...I used double the eggs and half in half instead of the milk...and just a little less water, and I used a whole cup of cocoa...It was amazing! I was able to remove it from the pan and position it on my cake decorating plate without any problems...it was sturdy, gooey, chocolatey, Amazing goodness!!! I have been searching for an amazing chocolate cake recipe...This is it!!! It rocks the socks off my grandma's recipe for sure!!!

This is very easy to make and taste delicious! I like how moist this cake is. And like said in the recipe, the final mix is in fact very liquid, but turns into something great!

Great basic chocolate cake!  We made it a bit healthier by substituting the oil and vanilla for vanilla Greek yogurt Anne took another reviewer's advice to use coffee instead of water.  In this case we used hazelnut decaf...all in all, it was a fabulous basic cake that allowed us to carve it into different shapes, layer it and decorate it, and have a grater family dessert night!

Absolutely superb, just as the recipe said. Be careful about thoroughly greasing and flouring the pans, though; this is so moist it's very sticky! But scrumptious even right away -- can't wait to try it tomorrow.

This recipe is absolutely awesome! The cake was moist and very flavorful, my family loved it!  I was really surprised by how easy the cake was to prepare.  I used cake flour in place of the all purpose flour and made a raspberry sauce to drizzle over the cake once it was complete.  I will definitely make this cake again.

Perfect Chocolate cake!! Made this for Thanksgiving.  I am now making it for my Office Christmas Bake Off competition.  It is definitely delicious and moist.  Cake did sag a little in the middle, but once it was iced, it was unnoticeable.  Thank you!

I agree that it would be better with more cocoa in it (but I ran out of cocoa right before I could test it!). It's really quick -- 15 minutes to put together and it only took 25 minutes to bake in my admittedly weird oven. You really need to make sure you grease the pans well, or it'll come out messily (easily covered with frosting). It took the same amount of time to bake in cupcakes as it took to bake in two 9" pans, which is weird; it's also great with a couple of dashes of cardamom and a bit of cinnamon.

I used 3/4 C whole wheat flour and 1 C white. Also substituted espresso for water, and folded my egg whites into the batter after whipping them till fluffy. Turned out A-mazing! My new standard chocolate cake! Thank you for this perfect recipe!

AWESOME!  Just made it tonight.  I DID increase the cocoa to 1 cup as recommended.  I didn't have milk, so I used buttermilk instead.  This was so easy and everyone loves it!  We used the buttercream iscing that is with the Cherry Amish Friendship Bread recipe.  Left it vanilla, but you could add cocoa and make it chocolate.  You will NOT be disappointed!

Extremely easy to make, delicious and not too sweet. I had to bake mine for longer than the suggested time, about 7 minutes more. Very moist cake, I frosted with chocolate cream cheese icing from this website. Will make again!

Do not attempt cupcakes with this recipe! It was an utter failure! I filled each cup about half way and they still exploded out the top. They also stuck to the cupcake liners pretty bad. I can't say anything about making a cake with this recipe, but bakers beware...don't make cupcakes!

Delicious and moist chocolate cake.  The only thing I changed was reducing the amount of water to 1/2 cup... I like a slightly denser cake.  Anyway, it came out really yummy with a great texture!

I used this recipe to make an ice cream cake for my husband's birthday. He doesn't like dark chocolate or anything coffee-flavored, so that eliminated a lot of chocolate cake recipes out there. This one was a perfect basic chocolate cake to showcase my homemade mint ice cream I used as "frosting". The cake froze well and tasted great.

Wonderful recipe.  I followed the recipe and made 24 cupcakes.  They came out so soft and moist.  I would give 5 stars if there's more chocolate taste in it.

I joined allrecipes.com JUST to comment on this cake.  I made them as cupcakes for my sons birthday and just like Pringles I could not stop at just one!  I thought initially there was too much sugar, but OMG, yum!  They are just moist enough and not dense.  I ate about 4 before the party and had to stop myself before we didn't have enough!  Will definitely make these again!

What a wonderful recipe! This was the first cake I had ever baked and let me tell you it was delicious!!! I made it for my mother's birthday and she couldn't stop complimenting my baking skills! The cake was just so moist and delicious it was absolutely amazing thankyou! I was a little skeptical about the whole "one cup of boiling water" part but it all worked out.
Thanks!!!!!! Will definitely use again!

Little bit messy to work with, but worthed it! I baked it in a 11 inch round pan, for 1 hour! (175C - interesting). And the sugar was observable, little crunchy =)

If you don't want your filling/cream to be soaked in between the layers and on the top of the cake, put some jelly/jam on it first (apricot's a good choice, because it has a soft flavor)

I made this recipe, and I thought it was a bit bland and dry, but then again I made it in a giant cupcake pan, so that might be why it was dry, since I cooked it a bit longer thinking the middle wouldn't be done. However, I am not a chocolate cake fan, so I decided to spruce it up a bit on my next try. I added two of the approximately 4 ounce butterscotch pudding snack containers into the batter, and oh my!!! It transformed it into the most moist, soft, wonderful chocolate cake ever, and I don't even like chocolate cake. I reduced the water by 1/3 cup when I added the pudding. I don't know how much time to add to baking, since I made it in a giant cupcake pan again, so just start checking it around the time it says and take it out when the toothpick comes out clean.

An absolutely wonderful cake that I adjusted by toppin with a chocolate Glaze instead of a frosting and I used my own chocolate custard recipe instead of a fudge middle. It turned out to be an enjoyably delicious, light, and fluffy cake.

I used this recipe in little bunny shaped muffin tins, and they worked perfectly. They were nice and moist, but I had a little trouble getting them out of the pan. I covered them with a chocolate ganache and some chopped almonds to finish them off. Super yummy. =^.^=

It is moist and rich, but has a bit of baking soda after taste.  I think I will try another recipe which does not require as much baking soda.

I would give this cake (taste wise) a five star.  I have one problem with the baking of it.  I baked it in a 9 by 13" pan and it cooked all the way through, but sinks down in the middle.  It's cooked all the way through, but the presentation without frosting is not appealing to the eye.  Any suggestions as to why this is happening??  Some of the other reviews I have read indicated that they also used a 9 by 13" pan instead of two 9" round pans.  Would love to hear from anyone else that has encountered this problem.

Wow! This cake is easy, delicious, moist, and...DELICIOUS (yes, it's that good--I had to say it twice)!!! I baked two "First & Ten" football cakes to make rocket ship cakes for my boys' birthday party. That made it take longer than 35 minutes because it was one recipe per cake, so it was pretty deep. I am really glad my 2-year-old said he wanted chocolate cake and that I found this recipe! Amazing! I saw one review that said they would never buy a boxed mix again and I have to agree! It really is too easy and scrumptious to not make every time you need a chocolate cake!

Excellent and easy!  Just made this for my son's birthday--it made a moist, dense, and chocolaty two layer cake....I'll be making it for a friend's birthday tomorrow and will try the 9 x 13 pan as one of the reviewers did.

This cake was excellent - made it for my husband's birthday. I used a little more cocoa as recommended by other cooks & it cooked for 20 minutes longer than the instructions say. It sat covered overnight then I iced it the next day with basic chocolate buttercream. It was perfect. I won't use a mix for chocolate cake ever again. Another bonus is that you can prep & mix all the dry ingreds together then put it away till you have time to mix in the wet ingreds & bake it. DO use parchment in your pan & DO use the very best cocoa you can find.

i will say, i messsed up  a lot! but, i dont think thats the reason why i didnt rate this cake 4 stars. i tought it tasted kinda bland, like it was missing something. but maybe itwas because i used a 8x1 round pan, and it over flowed, causing a smoky kitchen and i had to open a door but left it open till about 9:25 pm and my dog started barking at something out side! (cyotees live in my area, a lot of them) but maybe it was the frosting i used, i used that nasty pilsberry vannila frosting with green food coloring and added a veriaty of choco. sprikles. when it finished cooling thhough, the bottem was very moist and it stuck to the bottem of the pan, i did greese it! it was kinda crumby and to put on the iceing was really hard without messing up the cake. i dont know what i did wrong, but i dont think i will make this again.

I just made this cake and it is SO GOOD!  I used 3/4 cup of cocoa, but do think I will use a full cup next time!!  It was a very easy cake to make and defiantly will be a go to cake recipe!  I also had that baking soady taste, but am hoping it will fade as another member said.  Question, when I up the cocoa to 1 cup do I change the amount of sugar also??

This is the best from scratch chocolate cake recipe I've ever tasted.  So much better than boxed cakes.  I make decorative cakes as a hobby/side job and this is perfect.  It is moist and easy to stack and shape.  I also increased the cocoa to 1 full cup and used the best quality cocoa I found at the store.  Everyone begs for my recipe.  This is a rich, moist, delicious cake!

I  have made this cake twice. I used 1 cup cocoa the second time and WOW (from now on I will be using 1 cup cocoa)! This cake is amazing, moist, and tastes great even after it's been sitting in the fridge a few days. I frosted the whole thing with the Brownie Frosting from this site, then topped with Chocolate Ganache (hence why I was keeping the cake in the refrigerator)! My mom is always requesting me to make this cake for get togethers, it's a real favorite!

This recipe is fantastic. The only chocolate cake recipe i will ever use again! The only change i made was to use 1 cup cocoa powder. Per other reviews. I also used Chocolate Cookie Buttercream Frosting on the site. I just used 4x the amount of frosting for a 2 layer cake.
Thanks for sharing!!!

Great recipe and the best part is it's butter free! An overall pretty healthy and amazing cake. I baked mine using Godiva chocolate and i baked in a 10 x 2 pan. It took a bit longer, about 45 minutes but ti came out perfect. I put semi sweet chips in the mix too which added some surprise to the cake. Once it cooled I covered it with the Chocolate Ganache recipe (heavy cream, bittersweet choc). It was perfect! very rich but great with vanilla ice cream and coffee! Will make this again I am sure! plus its super easy!

I made this as written.  It was yummy and everyone really enjoyed it.  I have never had much luck with layering cake so I made it as a standard sheet cake and it worked out great.

My favorite Chocolate Cake recipe. If you are looking for a dark, moist, fudge-y like cake, this is it! Simple and beats any box mix cake.

Loved this cake and I'm not a big fan of chocolate.  :)  I followed the directions exactly and after cooling, I frosted with chocolate frosting on top and in the center.  I also filled the center with a homemade plum jam.  Delicious! I have to agree with others though, it is much better when it sits in the fridge overnight.  Very moist and not overly sweet like some cakes tend to be.  This one stays in the recipe book!

This is our new cake that we make for all birthdays and special occasions.  It's fabulous!!  Easy, quick and really easy to frost.  I use a frosting from allrecipes.com called "Rich chocolate frosting".  It's perfect everytime.  My family of seven will eat the entire cake in one setting because they can't stop themselves, it's that good!

This turned out great.I used the Chocolate Cream Cheese Icing from this site,but the cake was so moist I had to add a 5th Tbsp.of milk to the icing so I could spread it without tearing the cake.

Just tried this recipe after reading the good reviews on it and it turned out great!  The recipe was very easy to mix.  I used the recipe to make cupcakes and they were so good!  This recipe tastes a lot like devils food cake - so moist and chocolate.  I will definitely be using this recipe from now on!

First try was amazing right from the starting gate. Easy to make, easy to follow, took so little effort and the cake came out amazing! The kids loved it. Moist, chocolaty and delicious. Also, I looked up a home made frosting in ALLRECIPES, it turned out great. THANK YOU!

Yummy! I love this cake...  May I make a suggestion for frosting :)  Kathleen's Peanut Butter Icing:  1 cup confectioners' sugar  1 cup creamy peanut butter  5 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature  3/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract  1/4 teaspoon kosher salt  1/3 cup heavy cream   Also I love chocolate and I would also suggest upping it to one cup cocoa powder and adding 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips to the mix once it has been poured into the pan.  Its sooo good especially if your a fan of reese's peanut butter cups

Absolutely fabulous! I followed a recommendation and upped the cocoa to 1 cup. I also baked it in a bundt pan for 40 min and it turned out moist and delicious. I made a ganache and poured it on top of the cake which complemented superbly! I will be using this as a my go to chocolate cake!

good recipe, if you are a fan of fugde like chocolate cake, but I am not. i like those fluffy, moist chocolate cake but not dense ones. anyways but this recipe is good, very easy to make easier than any cake i have made. But the only problem, it stucks to the pan often, so use wax paper or parchement to  line the bottom of the pan.

Just finished making a 'test batch' before having to make a birthday cake this weekend and cant believe how good this came out. I'm not a fan of chocolate cake but this one will be the exception. Super moist and fudgy, and it almost seems to taste better after being in the fridge. I followed the recipe almost exactly with the exception of melted butter for the veg oil. I also used ruddy red cocoa which I've never seen before and I was a little worried that the cake would turn out red LOL (it didnt)...I also omitted the salt since I'm not a fan. I think for the next batch I'll follow the other reviews and up the cocoa to 1 cup other than that I wont change a thing!

This cake is to die for! I've been looking for an easy chocolate cake recipe that's moist and doesn't dry up when you refrigerate it. This cake is exactly that, and more! I followed the advice of some reviewers and upped the cocoa to 1 cup. Also, I substituted buttermilk instead of regular milk, hoping to get a better rise. But I think I overdid it and my cake fell as it was cooling. My bad! Even with my mess up, this cake turned out delicious! It's the kind of recipe where you can't go wrong. In fact, after leaving overnight in the fridge, the cake actually got even more moist, and the taste incredible!  The only thing I'd do differently next time is line the baking pan with parchment paper instead of just greasing and flouring.  I can't stop raving about this cake. This is going to be my standard chocolate cake recipe from now on. I can't wait to bake it again!

This has become my standard chocolate cake recipe.  It is easy to make, always bakes up perfectly, and has a nice texture and wonderful taste!  We love it with peanut butter frosting.

A word to the high altitude cooks, this cake will only fall if you don't make adjustments. I live in Colorado Springs, CO so I am at about 5500 ft. I used 1 3/4 c sugar instead of two, 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda instead of 1 1/2 tsp each, and increased the water to 1 1/4 c water. I used a 9x13 cake pan and baked it at 325 for 50 minutes and it turned out just perfect. I also used the buttercream frosting by Sharon and they are amazing together. I think it tastes much better than boxed cake mixes.

Increased the cocoa to 1 cup. Added 1/4 cup applesauce. Batter was very thin, but I went ahead! I made 2 x 8 inch rounds and 10 cupcakes with 1/4 cup batter each. It was perfect - this does rise up a lot, so leave space in your pans. I baked for 20 minutes until a toothpick came out clean. PERFECT! It has a soft light very moist texture and I needed a change from my usual dense chocolate cake. I added Kahlua Ganache for the fill, covered it in Chocolate buttercream, piped on some pink buttercream roses and it looked amazing - and tasted just as good! It did seem 'sticky' when I took it out, so do make sure you wait a little to take out of the pan and make sure you grease and flour your pans well.

Rave reviews. Very easy, rich dark chocolate flavor. Moist! The only thing I changed was to add hot coffee instead of boiling water at the end. I frosted with Rich Chocolate Frosting (recipe on this site).

The best dark chocolate cake I've ever made from scratch.  Absolutely delicious!  I divided the layers and poured the Texas Sheet Cake icing in between the layers to make an old fashioned Fudge Cake.  Oh my goodness!  It was so good!

Great, easy recipe.  I made this for a two year old's birthday party so admittedly I did not use the most quality chocolate money can buy.  I used Trader Joe's cocoa and it still turned out great.  I did increase the cocoa to one cup like a lot of other reviews suggested and I am glad I did.

Soooo good! I made a half recipe in an 8x8, cut in half and frosted with a whipped ganache. This will definitely cure a chocolate craving. Very rich and delicious!

I absolutely loved this cake, my husband did too! Hint though, don't use two 8in pans and guess how full they should be! My pans overflowed and my oven caught on fire... the cake still turned out amazing! Maybe if I get bigger pans, I will make it for my husband's birthday next year!  I did add a full cup of chocolate, and I am glad I did

What a wonderful recipe.  The cake was beautiful to look at and glorious to eat.  It was so moist and flavorful.  I increased the cocoa to 1 cup as suggested by others and used applesauce in replace of the oil for personal preference.  This is going to be a permanent go to recipe for me from now on.

Easy to make even if you are having an off day. Yesterday I burned everything I touched, but this cake still turned out good. I was worried it was going to be bad because it was so runny at first but it baked up nicely.

Great cake, and SO FAST AND EASY to make! Modified a bit by adding extra cocoa, cinnamon, coffee, nutmeg and cloves. I could hardly believe I made it, it tasted so good. Never using a chocolate cake mix ever again :)

My step-son wanted a chocolate cake for his birthday, so I made this for him. It was absolutely delicious. Everyone loved it and there wasn't even one piece left at the end of the day. Only thing different I did was used unsweetened applesauce in the place of the oil. Now his dad wants me to bake another one to take to his boss who just gave birth to a baby boy this morning.

AWESOME recipe. As a lot of other reviewers commented, the cake gets better the longer you let it sit. I substituted a cup of coffee for the water and it was perfect. Used a little more cocoa powder also for rich chocolate taste. No fail recipe, just follow it exactly.

I made this into a birthday cake for my husband and used 'Sturdy whipped cream frosting' on top (it was a ski-slope cake!). It was super easy and tasted fantastic. The frosting also got the thumbs up from young and old alike.

rather than decreasing the sugar amount, i followed the recipe as it is; however i was doughtful of how it would come out of the oven as the batter was runny. this cake turned out to be so tasty and moist. i will do it again and again. i love it. thanks

I just had to add my review to the growing number because this cake really should be tried. TRY this recipe! I'm very glad I did. This cake was super easy, delicious, and moist. I really didn't think cake could be good at all unless it came from a box and had "pudding in the mix" but this cake is fantastic. I didn't beat the batter for 2 minutes before adding the boiling water, it really isn't nessesary at all and you run the risk of over beating.

Absolutely perfect! I used 4 stars because I did agree that 1 full cup of cocoa was the right amount. I also replaced the water with adagio.com Birthday Cake tea. Friends of mine have replaced the water with Dr. Pepper and coffee, so I suppose the possibilities are endless. I frosted it with peanut butter frosting from the Peanut Butter Cake recipe on this website. YUM YUM YUM!

Perfect chocolate cake.....using 2 cups of flour. Have made this recipe (from HersheyÂ´s can label) for years with success. This is my go-to recipe whenever I need chocolate cake to dress up with any topping and/or frosting of choice. The recipe yields two 9" round cakes.

The only problem was it was slightly overcooked in our convection oven.  Probably 25 - 28 minutes next time.  I substituted whole wheat flour for half of the flour.

This is a fantastic recipe!  It is basically devil's food cake, made simple!  I made some changes because I didn't have unsweetened cocoa in the house... I used 2 cups of chocolate drink mix and 1 cup of brown sugar (instead of 2 cups of sugar and 1 of cocoa), it worked great.  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this cake the next day after baking it; it wasn't that great....however, after day 2 in the refrigerator, something spectacular happened.  The texture of it changed and it was fabulous!  So, bake this a couple days in advance and refrigerate it--wonderful!

This is an amazing chocolate cake. I followed the advice of previous reviewers and increased the cocoa powder to 1 cup. And to quote another reviewer, this cake is even more delicious the day after. I didn't even refrigerate it--just covered it. I made it with thick buttercream frosting so that may have retained its moisture. In any case, I don't review recipes often but this was amazing. A definite keeper. Thanks for it!!!

My husband thinks this is the best chocolate cake ever! I think it's pretty good- but a little heavy and moist for my taste. Really, it's all in finding a good icing! One great thing about this recipe is that I almost always have the ingredients on hand!

This cake is delicious - wonderful chocolate flavor and a nice, moist consistency. It makes a beautiful, heavy, rich cake. I topped it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site, and they were a great combo. I made it for my niece's birthday since she's a big chocolate lover, and she loved it. I bake a lot, and this will be my go to recipe for chocolate cakes from now on.

Nothing fancy, just a good chocolate cake! Following original recipe, I made 6-7 dozen mini cupcakes and finished them with a cream cheese icing. Be sure to bake the batter immediately since the boiling water activates the leavening.  Can't go wrong with this one!

So very good!  I read through a lot of the reviews and was a bit skeptical that this cake could taste that delicious without a bunch of ingreadients.  But I tried it and followed the directions exactly and it turned out to be one of the best tasting cakes I've ever done.  It doesn't require a lot of fancy ingredients, which I am grateful for.  The batter was a little thin, which made me a little worried.  I baked it for 35 minutes, and when I put a knife in the middle it came out clean and I was so suprised!  Definitely a keeper, and I will make it again soon!  I made some frosting that I found from the website and they went great together.  Very good.

I'm really torn on this, because I thought it was REALLY delicious, but it was sort of a disaster to make.  In my first attempt, using 9 inch pans as instructed, the pans completely overflowed. There was just a stream of batter running over the sides.  What was left in the pan eventually fell into a flat cake.  I tried again using half the batter in a 10 inch springform.  The cake didn't overflow, but half if it did collapse when I gave it a toothpick test at 30 minutes.  I ended up keeping it in the oven for 45 minutes.  It was lopsided, but delicious.  I will probably make it again, but will bake it in a larger pan for a longer time and will not disturb it at all!

This cake was amazing!  So easy and quick to make.  I baked mine in a 13x9x2 for about 30 minutes, then frosted with "Cinnamon Coffee Frosting" on this site.  To die for!  Thanks for the recipe!

After reading the other reviews, I did add more chocolate to the recipe. I was not really impressed with the taste of the cake but my husband (I was making it for him) really liked it. I just thought that the cake still lacked flavor..missing something. Since it got rave reviews from my husband (and was simple to make)...I will most likely make it again.

This cake is soft, moist, rich (following the advice of other reviewers and using 1 cup of cocoa) and it rose beautifully! This is my new go to chocolate cake recipe (with a little less cocoa next time). Don't be alarmed by the thin consistency. Yum!

YUM! At first I thought that there was absolutly no way that a batter this thin could cook. But when it came out, in exactly 34 minutes, it was perfect! I used one 9x12 pan instead and everybody loved it. Very easy too! I'm twelve and not the best cook but made this cake with like, NO effort.

YUMMMM....this was very moist and chocolatey. I ran out of white flour and used half whole wheat flour which might have made it richer. I also didn't have milf so I used about 1/4 cup heavy cream with 3/4 cup milk. no vegetable oil but olive oil with an added 1/4 applesauce to keep it moist. My version had some added health and was still realy delicious!

I gave this 4 stars because this chocolate cake recipe is the same as the Hershey's cocoa powder recipe.  I'm just glad I read the reviews that told me it was the Hershey's recipe, because I have already made that one and was looking for something different and unique to try...  Since I was looking for something other than the Hershey's recipe, I modified this one a bit.  I used a full cup of cocoa powder like other reviewers suggested, I used half and half instead of milk, and I used half butter and half oil instead of all oil.  I didn't want to use all butter because the oil does give it the moistness.  I will make the recipe again, but I will modify it even more.  Next time I plan to add another form of chocolate in addition to the cocoa, maybe bittersweet or dark chocolate.  I like the cocoa, but it seems like it is still missing some chocolate flavor that the cocoa cannot give.

This recipe made a great tasting cake but I used it to make cupcakes and it was kinda a mess. I filled the cups up 3/4 of the way and it completely spilled over. They are not pretty looking cupcakes but quiet tasty with cream cheese frosting. Next time, and there will be a next time, I think I will use a 9x13 pan. So it just lost one star for not being a flexible cake batter.

This is the one and only chocolate cake reciepe I will be using from now on. I've been searching for ages for a chocolate cake reciepe and this one just reminded me of the ones i used to eat as a child. I followed some of the users suggestion of adding 1 cup of cocoa instead of 3/4 and it just tuirned out perfect!

I made this cake as directed, and was very happy with it.  I ended up splitting the layers and giving the cut sides a wash with simple syrup, but the cake would have been moist enough without it.  I would recommend waiting at least a day to eat the cake after baking.  The day after it was baked the cake was good, two days later it was fantastic.  I will definitely use this recipe again, thanks!

Moist, chocolaty, very easy. Fabulous with my mom's caramel frosting. Don't be scared off by how thin the batter is after the boiling water. Wouldn't change a thing; will definitely make again.

I was looking for a quick and easy dessert and this was it!  I made the cake in a bundt pan and my family was very pleased with the results.  It was moist and delicious.  I was almost disappointed that I didn't have company to serve it to!  I did use 1c of cocoa as I had read in another review, it was good but I'm not convinced it was necessary.

My kids made this cake yesterday...it turned out awesome! We did substitute coffee for the water. We baked in a bundt pan, and topped with German Chocolate Cake Frosting II (off this site). I'm normally not a chocolate cake person, but this cake is so moist and full of flavor, I'm having a hard time staying away from it :) Thanks for sharing!***Made again, this time I added a cream cheese filling of crm chz, vanilla, powdered sugar & chocolate chips. I also added 1 TBSP instant coffee. I iced the cake with chocolate icing and topped with cherry pie filling...MMM GOOD!

So moist, delicious and EASY.  I followed the recipe exactly, except baked in a tube cake pan for about 35 minutes.  This is a keeper for nights when you need a bit of chocolate in a hurry!

I made this recipe as cupcakes and they turned out great! I used 1 full cup of unsweetened cocoa instead of 3/4 cup to bring out the chocolate flavor. I also added 2 Tablespoons of old coffee (leftover from this morning) to the boiling water to bring out the chocolate flavor even more. I made sure to sift all dry ingredients. I think this is key to making this an extremely light and fluffy cupcake. These are really delicious, even without frosting! I'll be making this recipe again!

Some changes: 1 cup of Dutch cacao instead of 3/4 cup. No water, but instead more milk, in total 1,5 cup. Instead of 1/2 cup of oil, I used a mixture of butter and oil and some more of it too: 1/2 cup of melted butter and 1/4 cup of oil. Last but not least: chipped pieces of chocolate mixed in the batter. Cooking time about 1 hour. Delicious!

Taste great! I read the reviews that the cake was too watery so I did not add the water. I had to substitute two of the items. Instead of cocoa powder I used Godiva's hot cocoa mix and instead of Vanilla extract I used Coconut extract. I sprinkled chocolate chips between the layers after the cake came out of the oven. I frosted it with wiped cream and coconut. This came out great and tasted like a german chocolate cake w/o the tooth ache.

I am only giving this 4 stars because it is the exact same recipe on the back of the Hershey Cocoa can as someone else said.  It has a rich fudge flavor and I agree the day after it was better, a bit too rich for me though.  I used the chocolate frosting recipe found on the back of the Hershey can as well and let's just say you will need milk!  I noticed the cake was so moist that when I frosted it, it started to fall apart.  I'm glad I was making it for my household so I didn't care much about it but would have been embarrassed otherwise.

I tweaked this recipe just a bit and thought the result was sensational; probably better than any other cake I've made.  I upped the cocoa to 1 cup and the vanilla to 1 Tbs.  Made as cupcakes and added a tsp of mini choc chips to each cupcake.  The real test of a good cake is if it tastes good without frosting.  This one does!  To add to the flavor perfection, it's all done in one bowl.  What could be better?

Wonderful recipe! Love the boiling water effect. I use this recipe to make Cake Balls, also on this website, and I cut the recipe in half and it makes about 30 Cake Balls. I upped the unsweetened cocoa powder to 1 full cup and it came out so great. Really rich and moist! Thanks!

Made this for my son's birthday, frosted with Rich Chocolate Frosting, the cake was a big hit. I used 2 tsps baking powder as I had Dutch cocoa, omitted the baking soda and salt, used coffee for hot water. Baked in 9x13 pan for 35 minutes and it was perfect.

I made this cake along with the Buttercream Icing recipe on this site.  My husband told me it's one of the best cakes he has ever eaten and he LOVES cake!  I followed another reviewer's advice and upped the cocoa powder to 1 cup.  I used a 9X13 pan and baked it for 30 minutes.  Thank you for this amazing recipe!

This cake was good, but not the best.  It was not moist enough for my liking.  Next time I think I will take it out of the oven a few minutes sooner and see if that changes anything.

I've been using this recipe for years - it's the same as the one in my Hersheys cookbook.  However, I add a box of instant chocolate pudding mix (dry) and I use a cup of boiling coffee instead of water.  ALWAYS gets great reviews, very rich and dense!!  I top it with chocolate cream cheese icing.

While the batter is surprisingly thin, this cake comes out moist and light - and is very versatile.  Tastes like a boxed mix, and just as simple to prepare.  For those who thought the cake was too bland, try adding 2 teaspoons of instant coffee to the boiling water before adding it to the batter.  I also used one cup of cocoa like others have suggested.  Perfect!

Fantastic cake, and will be my #1 cake from now on. Made it for my daughter's first birthday, and although she didn't eat very much of the cake since I had so much frosting on it to distract her, I have been eating her leftovers and it's amazing! It's been sitting in the fridge for two days and it's only getting richer and better, so no worries about making it in advance for an occasion.  I actually forgot to add the water in my first batch, and I think it turned out better that way--thicker batter, thicker, richer cake.

This is a WONDERFUL basic chocolate cake recipe. Just made it for the first time, followed the directions, and the cake was moist, flavorful and delicious. I made a 9x13 and then cut it in half and made a layer cake. Can anyone recommend a good frosting recipe to go with this?

This recipe is identical to the other one on Allrecipes called Extreme Chocolate Cake. The only difference is that the Extreme Chocolate Cake recipe also has a recipe for frosting. I didn't want that frosting, so I just printed out this recipe. I'm glad I did. I reduced the sugar by about 1/4 to 1/2 a cup and it still tasted heavenly. The batter is so easy to put together, the directions are easy, and nothing was confusing. I baked for 33 minutes, but the bottoms of my cake layers were still a bit gooey. I suggest the entire 35 minutes. I used a bit of cream cheese for the frosting, due to what was available in the fridge. I noted that I wanted more frosting while eating the cake. A good two to three cups of frosting would make this cake a masterpiece complete.

Simple, delicious, forgiving, reliable.  I am always shocked by how watery it looks and worry that it's going to be a complete train-wreck, but it rises and bakes up perfectly every time.

I could not believe how moist this cake was. I doubled the recipe and made it in a sheet pan for a work birthday party and the entire thing was gone in 30 minutes.  I covered it in "Rich Chocolate frosting" from this site and everyone loved it.  The only change I made was using buttermilk in place of the milk, which I think made the cake even richer and more delicious. I will definitely be trying this one again.

This cake was easy to make, smelled amazing, and tasted great too! I did make a couple of changes. I substituted the vegetable oil for butter. Since I didn't have unsweetened cocoa power I used Swiss Miss No Sugar Added (6 packets to be exact). And finally, I added one bar (about 1 teaspoon) of shredded unsweetened chocolate pieces. The cake turned out to be very moist, sticky, and chocolatey.

Wow, I am not the biggest chocolate cake fan, but my friend is, so I looked for a recipe that would be tasty -- an hopefully better than a box mix.  This recipe was IT!   I thought it had wonderful flavor and was very moist with a nice, rich dark color.  I used regular Hershay's cocoa, and everyone said "Oh, you must have used expensive, fancy chocolate".   Will definitely make again.  I used "Rich Chocolate Frosting" from this site and it went great together (I made 1/2 the recipe because I made a raspberry filling to put between the layers), and it was plenty to frost and pipe a couple of rows of shells.  ENJOY!

WOW! What a delicious moist cake--and it was sooo simple too!  (No more boxed cake mixes needed.)  As suggested by others, I increased the cocoa to 1 cup & added a little instant coffee to the water.  Also, replaced half the oil w/ applesauce.  Excellent & definitely a keeper!

So easy to make and also very forgiving. I wasn't paying attention to the amount of water and added 2 cups of water by mistake. I decided to bake it anyways and see what happened. Poured it into a bundt pan and it turned out perfect! I will make this again, but be sure to double check ingredient amounts:)

So nice to have the moisture of the boxed cake without the list of 50 ingredients. :)  Very moist and yummy and so great that it's just in one bowl!

this cake blew my mind.  i'm always thinking the more 'sophisticated' recipe will yield the most delectable result but i can fold in all the egg whites i want, when it comes to the perfect cake, this is it.  so springy, so moist, everything about it screams sensation.  it's my 'go to' cake from now on.  making it tomorrow as a last minute request because it comes together so quickly it's worth the effort to be able to say, 'o, yeah.  i made that from scratch.'

This recipe came out amazing.  I made it for my Dad's birthday and my entire family has been raving about it since.  I made a chocolate cream cheese frosting to go with it.  Definitely will be making again!

I made this twice within two days. Once for cupcakes and again as a cake for a party.  I wasn't impressed with the recipe after tasting the cupcakes.  The cupcakes didn't seem to have much flavor, even a day later. I made the cake on Thursday, tasted some on Saturday for the party and still thought it was very bland. Now it's Sunday and I tried a few bites and thought it was improved. How weird is that? It seemed to take a couple of days for the flavor to take hold but I don't know why. Maybe with a more expensive brand of chocolate it would be better?  So all in all I'd have to give this recipe three stars for ease of preparation but I can't rate it higher because I didn't feel like it had enough flavor overall.

It throws together in a jiff!  I think I had this mixed up and in the oven in less than 10 minutes.  I was a little disappointed with the flavor, I thought it could have been a little more chocolatly.  Then again my husband thought it was great as is, and I am a self confessed chocoholic, so there is always room for more chocolate me!!

This cake is amazing! It's so easy and tastes so much better than a mix. I put raspberry jam in the middle and it was the perfect mix of flavors. I will definitely be making this again!

I've only just started cooking/baking more seriously about 3 months ago although I did dabble here and there before that.  I would definitely rate myself a beginner and this cake was the first recipe I tried on the baking side.  Everything turned out FABULOUS!  I thought perhaps it was just beginners luck but I'm currently baking this for the third time in so many months and it comes out incredible every time.  Everyone loves it and it's been a birthday request from several coworkers/friends.  Thanks so much!

Absolutely delicious...a success every time and you really cannot mess it up!!! Rich and moist and the only modification I have made is to increase the cocoa powder to 1 cup and use 1/2 cup boiling water and 1/2 cup coffee instead of the full cup boiling water

I made this cake back in the summer for a Friday night "family night". My 5 boys loved it, and devoured it! They loved it so much my 6 year old requested it for his birthday. I made a homemade frosting off the back of the Hershey's cocoa can & it made the cake even richer. It's very good with glass of ice cold milk. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  I added a shot of espresso and enough water to make 1 cup, but I might do two shots next time, I didnt really get the flavor.  Still, the cake is very good.  The batter is super thin though, I was worried.  turned out fine.

this cake is really good! My brother can't get enough of it! it tastes even better after it cools down though. The only reason why i'm not giving it 5 stars is that i ran out of vanilla, so i didn't use it. I bet that it would taste even better with the vanilla. I'll review this recipe again after i make it again, with the vanilla.

I love making cakes from scratch and this was simple and VERY delicious cake. I did not have milk so I substituted half and half! And it was fantastic! I actually made a bundt with th entire batter..just baked a bit longer for that but again a VERY delicious and VERY yummy and moist cake!

This is by far the best chocolate cake I have ever had. It was super easy to make, it was moist, wasn't too sweet and it tasted great. I followed the directions exactly and didn't feel that I needed to change a thing. I was really glad they added the warning about the batter being thin or I would have thought I'd done something wrong. This is for sure my go to chocolate cake recipe.

Excellent Cake- very simple to make. Based on the reviews, I did increase the cocoa to 1 cup; and instead of water, I used a cup of coffee.  I baked it in 9x13 for 40 minutes.

Has anyone tried substituting 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for the oil? Looking for a way to reduce the fat content, and I know this works in other recipes.

I made this cake for my father in law when he got home from the hospital.  I got so many raves about it.  My mother had even mentioned that is was better than anything she has ever had out.  My father in law, in fact has asked me to make him another cake tonite!  Great job on coming up with the recipe....this cake is super moist.

This is easy and so good!  I've tried other recipes and this is by far my favorite.  It's moist and dense just like I think a chocolate cake should be.    Just be warned, the batter is very thin, don't panic, that's how it should be.  But be careful not to overfill your pan(s) or you will have a mess in your oven!  To this day I still have that issue when making cupcakes.

I loved this cake! I've made it two times already and I'm making it a third time today. It's so deliiciously moist and chocolaty! Although this is the exact same recipe as the one on the back of the box of Hershey's cocoa powder. Anyhow, it's a wonderful recipe and tastes great with a chocolate ganache recipe on this website.

this cake was the best cake ive ever made! it could easily even be the best home-made cake ive ever had! thanks SHIRLEYO!!! =) if it helps.. i had to make a few changes because of some ingredient shortages. i used butter instead of oil. didnt have enough cocoa so put in a bit of cadbury chocolate powder. and since the cocoa wasnt unsweetened, i put in 50g less sugar (which was caster by the way.)even with the changes.. it came out perfect! didnt even need frosting.. moist and rich!! =)

I am a novice baker, but I had no trouble at all mixing up this cake.  I followed the recipe exactly, and the cake turned out wonderfullly.  Most of the other cakes I have made from scratch have turned out quite heavy, but this cake was light and fluffy, and definitely delicious!

I love this recipe and use it all the time, so does my husband. Everyone always compliments and it has converted a few of my friends who use box mixes to start making cakes from scratch. Super tasty and moist! We love it with chocolate whipped cream for the frosting.

This is by far the best (most moist) chocolate cake you will ever make.  I started making this cake when it was 5/5 stars and only 53 people had rated it.  It is so easy and the taste is wonderful.  I do however use a cream cheese frosting and usually mix in some coconut or chocolate chips (in the frosting). It takes 40 minutes in a 9x13, & 51 minutes in a bundt pan.

This recipe is fantastic!  I've made it several times, and it has always been a success and met rave reviews.  I've added a little extra sugar and it seems to be great. My only problem is that I always struggle to get the cake out of the pan-no matter how much I grease and flour it, the cake always sticks.

The taste of this cake was great.  It was just moist enough.  I did have some difficulty removing the cakes from the pans, however.  I ended up with a mess in the bottom of the pan and not-so easy to frost cakes.  Admittedly, this could have been an error on my part. As this was a rushed birthday cake, perhaps I didn't grease / flour the pan quite thoroughly enough.  I topped the cake with the mousse recipe from Chocolate Mousse Cake IV and layered it with fresh strawberries.  It really was a delicious combination.

I don't generally like cake.  And i always think that chocolate cake doesn't taste like chocolate...until now.  This is wonderful.  We can't stop making it and eating it.    Normally, i will bake a cake, and my husband will take it to work to share with his buddies.  Usually, he will come home with half the cake left.  This time, he made the mistake of taking it to work, and he almost didn't get a piece at all.    This recipe is easy, moist, yummy, and serious crowd-pleaser.

This is awesome!  I used half Splenda and half sugar as well as egg substitute instead of real eggs.  Next time I will use at least half whole wheat flour and applesauce as well.  I topped it with a great frosting substitute: 1 1.4 oz package chocolate sugar free pudding added to 1 1/4 cup skim milk.  Add one 8 oz container sugar free cool whip and fold in with pudding.  Spread on cake and sprinkle chocolate chips over it. the cake ended up being a very light and airy dessert!  It was perfect!

This cake is awesome!!  It is the fourth recipe I have tried in two weeks, and the only one that has come out perfect.  This cake was rich, moist, chocolatey, and so easy to make.  This will definitely be my go-to cake recipe for now on!  I frosted it with a vanilla buttercream, and it was incredible.

I thought the chocolate flavor was really good in this cake, and you can't beat how easy it is to put it together, but I felt like mine turned out a bit dry.

Delicious Cake!! I cook light, so I made some alterations for a healther cake.  I used 1/2 parts whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose.  I only used half the oil called for and the other half unsweetened applesauce (if you use all applesauce it would be a VERY dense cake).  I also used egg-beaters in place of real eggs and splenda in place of sugar.  I used a whole cup of cocoa powder as suggested by other reviewers.  The cake was light, fluffy, and tasted great.  Next time I think I'll add some chocolate chips as well!!

Oh my, what an amazing cake!! I used the Rich Chocolate Frosting with this cake, and a bunch of college students had no problem devouring it for a friend's birthday. My only suggestion would be to be sure you flour and grease the pans enough. I don't believe I did, and, probably because the batter is so runny, I had a terrible time getting it out of the pans. Nevertheless, the flavor surely wasn't altered. I will definately be making this again for fellow chocolate lovers!

Moist and delicious, although a little denser than boxed cake.  Used apple sauce instead of oil, cake flour, and baked in 9x13" pan for 38 minutes.  Thank goodness for the "watery" note.  Pulled away from butter/floured pan beautifully.

Delicious cake!  I was afraid it wouldn't be chocolately enough, but it turned out perfect!  I oiled and floured my pans with flour/cocoa powder and they turned out fine (no sticking)As mentioned in other reviews, the batter is very runny, and I was nervous, but it baked up nicely.  I made this in 3 layers (doubled recipe) for my mother in laws bday cake, frosted with whipped chocolate ganache and finished with a poured choc ganache....PERFECT!  My new go to choc. cake recipe!

This cake was quite good, I did up the cocoa to 1 cup and let it sit for a day as some others recommended. However, it still isn't the "perfect" recipe that I've been looking for, I've had better chocolate cakes. But it is very good and pretty moist.

This is my go to cake. I have made it several dozen times. My friends request it for their birthday parties, etc. I usually freeze it before I put frosting on it. It is super moist and difficult to frost if it is at room temperature. Seriously. Best chocolate cake ever!

My eight year old daughter wanted to make a cake from scratch for her birthday. This was the perfect cake. It was very easy to make, and we had all the ingredients on hand. As I was making it, I was a little worried when I added the boiling water because the batter became so thin. But I shouldn't have worried; It was dense, moist and delicious!

I made this for a friends birthday. I cut the recipe in half for a one-layer cake, added some chocolate chips, a dollop of mayonnaise, and used home-made chocolate frosting. everyone loved it!! my one complaint is that it stuck to the pan, which is most likely due to the chocolate chips I used. I'm cooking it again right now, and I'm going to try adding the chocolate chips after a few minutes of baking since the batter is so thin. anyway, this will definitely be the recipe I use for chocolate cake going forward. love it!!

Love, love, love this.  Only 4 stars because I altered it.  1 C. coco powder, butter instead of oil and 1 T. instant coffee.  So YUM!

OMG..... We loved this cake, my friend from Germany came in so I made it for her. And we devoured it. And my husband said this is the only cake he will eat from now on! I did use a cup of cocoa and sifted all my dry ingredients. The buttercream icing goes great with this....

This cake was very good and very moist!  Make sure to spray cake pans very well to keep the cake from sticking!  Went great with buttercream frosting.

WONDERFUL!  This is going to be the only chocolate cake that I make from now on.  I would suggest using one cup of coco powder instead of three-fourths though.

When I first made this cake my family loved it, but it seemed way too oily for me. However, like a previous reviewer mentioned if you let it sit a day or two it gets much better. This is a great cake if you are looking for something easy and fast to make, but I recommend it more if you can let it sit a day. Makes really good cupcakes too.

While the flavor is wonderful the cakes performance in terms of presentation is just not consistent.  Sometimes it will turn out beautifully and sometimes it will look less than desirable.  I've used it for both cakes and cupcakes and have had mixed results with both. Again wonderful flavor but it won't be my go to recipe for birthday cakes or cupcakes, just not consistent enough.

The only change I made was making this cake with specialty dark chocolate and 1 1/2 cups of milk and 1/2 cup of boiling water. It is so delicious....my family loves this recipe! Mmmmmmmmm.... I make it all the time.

I made this for a birthday party one day before.  It was very moist the next day and was the first cake to be devoured. I did add the mini choc. chips to the top and it was perfect...a keeper. I will make this again...soon.

I was just reminded of this Hershey's recipe when searching the site for a quick dessert.  I have it in my own recipe file but hadn't made it in a long time.  I made a couple of changes this time: used buttermilk (because I had it on hand) and baked in a 13X9 pan for about 40 minutes.  Wonderful, no frosting required.  Served with sliced berries and vanilla ice cream.  Guests enjoyed it and had no clue how easy it was.  This is a keeper.

Instead of cake, I made cupcakes!  The recipe was easy and made tasty cupcakes, but they were too moist/wet.  I would make this again, but just add less boiling water.  Also, I followed the advice of another reviewer and increased the cocoa a bit.

I used 1 cup of cocoa powder, as suggested by other reviewers. The cake was very rich.. maybe a little too rich. Otherwises, it was very good. A little too soft and crumbly.

Delicious and moist! I used a 9 x 13 pan and baked it for 40 minutes. A few alterations I made: used brewed coffee in place of the water, and substituted 3 tablespoons of black cocoa powder for 3 of the tablespoons of regular cocoa powder (gives chocolate flavor more depth). Amazing with caramel frosting!

This was a delicious and moist cake.  I had just ran out of vanilla and so I used orange oil instead.  It was perfect.  I would definitely use this recipe again.

I was hoping to make this my "go-to-recipe" like many others.  It definately was NOT aweful, but wasn't outstanding.  I hope to reattempt it with possibly a better outcome.   My issue was that my cake was extremely fudgy, too dense, almost more brownie-like than cake-like.  I was prepared for the extreme wateriness prior to baking but mine wasn't as 'wet' as I expected.   I believed that I followed the recipe as written, but like I said, I hope to try it again with better results.  Still, it's worth a try, !

This cake is AWESOME!  I've had trouble in the past making a cake from scratch, because it often comes out dense.  Not this cake, it was light and chocolately ... it was SO good.  I was so proud of this cake & my husband (his birthday) LOVED it  :)  I will be using this recipe anytime I need a chocolate cake - Goodbye boxed cake!

This cake was very easy to make and has simple ingredients that one would usually have on hand.  I scaled the recipe down to 12 servings and it came out great and super moist.  It is not sweet so maybe next time I will add a little more sugar. But overall a great recipe that I will definitely be making again.

Very tasty!! Only took a few minutes to put together and completely satisfied my chocolate craving. Even better the next day. I topped with Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site and it turned out great. I will be making this again.

Ok, this was the fastest and easiest cake I have ever made.  It was better the next day after it cooled.  It seemed fluffy when it was hot but when it cooled, it became this dense, moist, delicious mouthwatering cake.  I didn't even put icing on it.  I made it in a bundt cake pan (cooked for 55 mins) and sprinkled a little bit of powdered sugar on top just for decoration.  It took me about 10 minutes from start to get it in the oven. I  made it exactly as specified - no variations at all.  It didn't need anything else.  I was expecting it  to just be ok.  But it was EXCELLENT! Update 10/18/09 - Ok, since my last review I've made this cake at  least a dozen times. I keep all of the ingredients incase I hear that someone is coming, and it's a huge hit  with guests. I have had some failure getting a nice bundt cake with  this recipe because it's so extremely moist that the top sometimes  falls off in the pan, but it's never bothered anyone. Today I made it in a 9x9 pan and it's nice and thick. It was wonderful according to this recipe, but for variation I've added a tsp of cinnamon and a big pinch of red chili powder. Makes a unique and wonderful flavor. The longer it sits the more moist it gets. Soooooo good.

Excellent results - it had the moistness and even consistency of a box cake, but with 100x more flavor.    I added some dark chocolate chips for some added richness.

This was amazing!  I have always been the only one in my family that loves chocolate cake, and this recipe wowed even the pickiest of eaters.  My fiance's brother in law is a chef and he asked me to make this cake for his birthday.  Not one person had a bad thing to say about this cake.  This will ALWAYS be my new chocolate cake recipe!  Thank you for sharing :)

This cake was awesome! I too increased the cocoa to 1 cup. I made cupcakes with it and they turned out great. Cook them for 15-20 min.(really depends on your oven and pan you use). This is my new 'go to' cake!!! Thanks!

This was my first time making a cake not using a boxed cake mix. It was so easy and turned out really moist. I did up the cocoa to 1 cup as recommended by other reviews and I used the  Satiny Chocolate Glaze (doubled the recipe) from this website as well. Thanks for such a good easy recipe I will be making this one again.

Moist, delicious, tender and dark.  Filled two 9-inch round pans perfectly.  Do use 1 cup cocoa.  A keeper.

So moist and delicious! Tasted like it could be from a bakery. Loved the texture.  I upped the cocoa a bit per others suggestions and frosted with the Rich Chocolate frosing also on this site.

This was my first cake that I made from scratch and it was super easy and tasty!  I made it for my 3 year old's birthday party and I was asked where I had bought it at!

OK, this is my go-to chocolate cake recipe, and now thanks to you,my entire family's go-to. To give you an idea of how moist this cake is the youngest boy in the family said for his birthday he wanted "that mushy chocolate cake" (he didnt know the word was moist). Now my mom and aunt have been making it almost every week and topping it with 7 minute frosting. YUM! Thanks for an easy recipe with staple pantry ingredients you can make any time.

This was very good. (Well, that's what I was told.  I don't like cake.)  I used the recommendations and added 1 cup cocoa, 1/2 cup boiling water, left it in the fridge overnight and frosted it the next day.  I made it for a birthday party.  Even the people that don't normally like chocolate cake liked this cake.

Great for cupcakes.  I halved the recipe and made 12 perfect cupcakes.  There was also no residue oil/grease underneath the cupcakes papers when they were removed from the tin.  Good taste and texture too.

Delicious cake. I made only one layer (half the recipe) so there would not be too much left over. Frosted with one bowl buttercream icing for a lovely Sunday night dessert. Thanks!

Always turns out perfectly!  I made cupcakes once from this recipe; just bake them for about 20 minutes.  Sometimes I add a full cup of cocoa powder, sometimes just the prescribed 3/4 cup... it doesn't seem to matter too much either way.  I use only whole wheat flour in my recipes and this recipe works well with the flour substitution.

I just made these as cupcakes and was very pleased!  It's moist and tastes great, I can't wait to make it as a cake next time!  I used a full cup of cocoa (Ghiradeli) and sifted the cocoa as well.

SO delicious and easy! I wanted a chocolate cake and had no mixes at home. I decided to give this a try and I think I wont be going back to box cakes. It was so moist and most of all easy to make! I was always afraid of scratch cakes, not anymore! I made it with the Chocolate Frosting I here on this site, delicious!!  The only change I made was adding instant coffee to boiling water! Thanks, and who cares where it comes from, it is the best chocolate cake recipe!

Hmm...very yummy! very moist and very chocolaty! One of the best chocolate cakes I've ever made! I followed some reviewer's advice and increased the cocoa but that's not necessary. Do exactly what the recipe says, and you'll get a very, very good chocolate cake!

This is the best cake recipe I've ever made!  Absolutely fantastic - I'll never use another box mix for chocolate cake again!  I used it to make cupcakes, and added chocolate chips in once I had spooned the batter into the muffin cups.  They all sunk to the bottom but were delish anyway!

Thought this was excellent. Up'ed the cocoa and used a little less water. Turned out pretty well. I made cupcakes - the ones in the silicone trays were a pain to remove...I'm still learning.

I just made this cake today and it was a success.  I didn't have the milk so substituted plain yogurt and with about a 1/2 cup (organic) sugar later, it was great.  The only reason I gave it a 4-star is because it is actually almost too moist!  I made jumbo cupcakes (without papers) and couldn't get them out of the pan very well.  I'll use cupcake papers next time.  Oh, I also baked for about 5 minutes longer.  Very good and the fam loved, too.

Great chocolate cake recipe. I halved it and used it to make cupcakes, made a dozen perfectly. It was very moist, and not super sweet, but still tasted great. No changes to the recipe, works great as is.

i followed the recipe word by word but the center didnt cook at all.though i baked all the batter in a springform pan. tastes very good with a great chocolatey taste but the center was very gooey ,didnt cook at all even after 45 min.it rose well. the top was hard.so i had to cut the cake leaving the center.iam giving this 4 stars since the the kids loved it and the cake didnt get wasted. i will still try this for its chocolatey taste next time and post my views again.

Wow - what a great & simple recipe! I used my kitchenaid mixer & it took only seconds. I split the recipe in half and made 12 cupcakes. I baked them at 350 for about 18 mins (give or take). The batter is REALLY thin, but do not worry - it works! I loved the end results.. I ended up eating 3 after taking them out of the oven.... FANTASTIC! :) [Update] this is totally the recipe on the back of the Hershey's Cocoa can - BUT the better quality chocolate you have, Ghiradelli or Blommers makes this cake incredible! Yum!

Indeed, this is a delicious cake!  I made it for my son's birthday for a German chocolate cake and it came out perfect. I increased the cocoa to an exact 1 cup measurement. Moist and fluffy, not dry at all. This recipe has already been saved as my standard chocolate cake recipe.  Thanks a bunch!

Yum! I have made this recipe twice and both times have not been disappointed. I find the cake stays moist for days and it's really flavorful even after a few days. I make this recipe with the chocolate ganache recipe on this site. DELISH!

This is my new, go-to chocolate cake recipe.  I halved the recipe and made 12 large cupcakes, which I baked for ~24 minutes at 350.  Frosted with chocolate cream cheese frosting and peanut butter frosting.

very easy and and fast, with a tastey chocolately result. I have made this cake more than a dozen times. Used chocolate gangache as filling and to cover the cake then decorated with strawberries. Another option I did which everyone loved was to fill it with hazelnut cream (tasted like ferrerro rocher) then covered the cake with chocolate ganache. On top of that I put this: make crepes, very sweet crepes, making sure to make them very very thin and cook them till crispy. Then break them up to make some sort of flakes and decorate the cake with them. I think something like that can be found in speciallized shops but I don't know what they are called.
Enjoy watching the cake disapear piece by piece:)

Really great recipe, simple. 
I increased cocoa (per recommendations to 1 cup). I also decreased sugar by 1/3 and would probably reduce it a bit more. I like the flavor of cocoa over the sugar. Was curious about sea salt, which I used instead of table salt (prefer it in all my cooking) and it didn't affect the flavor noticeably.
This is a keeper.

I made this cake for my family.  My husband doesn't like homemade chocolate cakes - he says he prefers the box ones.  However, he said this was a really good cake...and it was!  I made it in a rectagular pan instead of round ones.  I iced it with a peanut butter icing (it was actually fudge that didn't set up!) and it was fabulous!!!  Even if this was found on the cocoa box, thanks for sharing!

I did not make any changes to the recipe.  The cake is moist and delicious!
I made it with the "Heavenly Chocolate Mousse" from this website.

Oh my goodness!  This was my first time baking a cake from scratch, as I'm not much of a baker.  The cake turned out fantastic - chocolatey, moist and perfect consistency.  I had to cook for 35 minutes in my 9x13" pan for the cake to be done.  The cake was moister and tastier the day after it was baked and continued to be tasty for the week after. Yum! Try it today!

I needed a quick birthday cake and this was it. It was wonderful with a rich chocolate tasgte. I used a filling of white chocolate (box of white chocolate pudding, 3/4 cup milk, 1/4 cup 10 X sugar. Mix together and add an 8 ounce container of cool whip. It makes a wonder filling or frosting. I than topped the cake with a chocolate ganacho. If you are a chocolate lover this is heaven on earth.

Best chocolate cake recipe from scratch.  I have tried many with poor results.  This is absolutely delicious and the texture is wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Will never make a boxed chocolate cake again or try another chocolate cake recipe.

Thank you "shirleyo" for this great recipe.  My kids loved this cake.  I live in France and am always happy to make my kids food from my childhood from scratch, frosting, for example, doesn't even exist here so I always make it from scratch.

I made this recipe for cupcakes when I then piped chocoalte ganash inside then topped with cream cheese frosting.  I received high praises, but I would have preferred a fudgier cake next time.  This one seemed oily and the holes were too large, I prefer a denser cake.

Yes, it's the same recipe as on the back of the Hershey container, but it's also a very good cake! If I hadn't found it on here first, I wouldn't have ever noticed it on the container, so thanks for posting it!

I doubled up this recipe and baked it in mini loaf pans for my son's birthday...I made him a train cake.  Coupled with white wedding cake frosting, it was delicious.  Despite sifting it a lot, it was quite dense, which is why I am rating it only four stars.

I signed up to bring in a baked item for a work dessert contest. I made this cake with 1 cup cocoa. Layered cakes with raspberry preserves in btwn the layers & made sure preserves oozed from btwn layers, iced (top only) with milk choc. (store)icing, put stripes of raspberry preserves (heated up in the jar first) on top and swirled it in icing; then sprinkled with mini choc. chips.  I won third place - YUM!

This was the best cake recipe I've ever made.  I was surprised at how easy it was too.  No more time consuming than boxed and WAY better.  I'll never buy another boxed chocolate cake. 
ADDED 06-29-10 just wanted to say I'm still making this same cake and have passed the recipe along several times.  It is a keeper!

Excellent cake.  We used Lonna Brown and Roweena's suggestions and it turned out perfectly.  The frosting I used was Chocolate Cream Frosting, and I took chellebelle's suggestion to make it have a nice chocolate whipped cream texture.

I cut the sugar by half  and used a cup of cocoa and it was lovely and rich! So moist and delicious, and easy. By far the easiest cake recipe, almost as easy as a boxed cake mix.

I made these as cupcakes, so reduced cooking to 25minutes.

I increased the cocoa to one cup and decreased the water to 3/4 cup. Otherwise, left everything else the same.  It tasted a bit odd the first day, but by day 2, it was pretty good.  I used Peanut Butter frosting with it, and everyone seemed to like it.

This recipe makes a nice, moist and dark chocolate cake.  Very easy to make and great results.  I've used it for two birthday cakes recently, using the fudge icing from the Buttermilk Chocolate Cake on this site.  Great combination and no actual chocolate used, just cocoa powder.  Enjoy!

Chocolate goodness! This was VERY moist and tasted more like a brownie than a cake. I made it for a birthday party and covered it with a fondant and it held up well. Everyone loved the cake and I LOVE that it only messes up one bowl!

I used 1 cup of cocoa, and only about 3/4 cup of boiling water, into which I mixed in a teaspoon of instant coffee.  For me this cake was just okay.  Right after baking, it had a bit of a "tinny" taste, but the taste did improve after a day.  I would like a chocolate cake that is a little more dense, rich, and chocolatey (using something other than water for moisture).  If you like a lighter chocolate cake, this recipe might be good for you.

Soooo good! Super moist, and just the right amount of chocolate flavor. The only change I made was to use buttermilk. BTW, the batter is REALLY thin when you stick it in the oven. Best chocolate cake I've ever had. Will definitely make it again!

Love It!  So simple to make- but taste so very good.  Made it for a birthday everyone licked their plates clean.  My new stand by.  Frosted with the rich chocolate frosting from this site.  My family pours unwhipped whipping cream on our chocolate cake, this was absolutely delectable!!!

I made this cake for my sisters birthday and i must tell you that it is fantastic! I dont even like cake and i found myself reaching for more helpings. So rich and moist, it got rave reviews. I topped it with an icing sugar and cream cheese frosting. I doubled the recipe which perfectly fit in 2 9x13 pans for a double layer cake. Next time i will try filling the middle with something.  I also lined the pans with aluminum foil sprayed with cooking spray to prevnent sticking. That way you  can just pull the cake out without them breaking and sticking to the pan. They never stick to the foil. I also liked how easy and fast this recipe was to put together..barely takes longer than a box mix. This will be my chocolate cake recipe from now on.

This cake was delicious and moist but I didn't use a big enough baking tin and it bubbled and overflowed out of the oven and all over the floor. The mixture is very runny so use a large tin and not a flexible rubber pan like I did.

It helps a lot to dissolve the cocoa in the boiling water, and then add it to the rest of the mixed up cake batter. 

mmmm.... can't wait for it to come out of the oven!

OMG!! So delish & moist. I can't believe how easy this was to make. My family loved this. I was pretty proud of myself since my last attempt at from "scratch" choc. cake took so long to make and was a disaster. The only change I made was adding mini choc. chips. It is so chocolatey it doesn't need frosting just a big glass of milk to wash it down. Will definetly make again & again!

Very good indeed, just used half of the ingredients, cause I didn't want to make a very big cake. It turned out really nice anyway. My boyfriend loved it even though he likes 'healthier' cakes!!! Thanks for great recipe. =)

this recipe is THE BEST. I made it for my cousin's 21st birthday and it was just awesome. I also cut the cake lengthwise into two pieces and then i made some strawberry cream and put it in the middle and top. In addition, I made some spun sugar for decoration. :) I highly highly highly recommend this recipe.

I made this cake after many failed attempts at producing a luscious, moist, chocolaty, cake. Homemade cakes have alsways been too dry for my taste. I actually preferred boxed cake mix- until I found this recipe! So easy to make, and wonderfully scrumptious! I've already put it in my recipe box to be made again and again.

This was a very good chocolate cake recipe! I took the advice of others and sifted the dry ingredients. I added about half of the water that the recipe called for and the batter was still thin. I made cupcakes...they turned out great.

This was great!  I've avoided making cake from scratch for a long time because every time it turns out dry or blah, but this was perfect, just like it came from a box!  I iced it with chocolate buttercream icing.  I also used coconut milk because my son is lactose intolerant.

This cake is SO delicious! It was my first attempt at a cake not from a box, and I will never go back - especially because I can control the ingredients - no hydrogenated oils or weird preservatives! I baked it in a 9x13 pan for 35 minutes and it turned out great!

Really yummy and moist. I made a 9x13 cake and baked for about 40 minutes. I frosted it with "Vanilla - Chocolate Powdered Sugar Frosting" from this site. They paired really well. Thanks for the great recipe! :)

OMG, this is awesome and so easy. I even lowered the fat by using 1/4 cup applesause and 1/4 cup oil instead of 1/2 cup oil. Also this is so sweet and moist you don't even need frosting, I just baked mine in a bundt pan for 35 min and dusted with powdered sugar. Tasted and looked great.

Everything about this cake is a 5, except for the assembly of it. That was my only concern. I always make absolutely sure not to over mix my batters, but when this one said to just dump everything in one bowl i was nervous about how "light" it would turn out. While it was dense and moist, it was a little too "compact" for my taste. However I will definately make again, but next time I will start with a creaming method and sift the dry ingredients. (I filled mine with a choc. pudding layer, then frosted...soooo good!)

Oh my goodness this cake was sooo moist! For some reason, it seems to taste even better the next day. Maybe it picks up some of the moisture from the frosting. I've made this more than once and have halved the recipe without a problem. Fantastic!

This is a great recipe for chocolate cake from scratch. I made this and the "Rich Chocolate Frosting" recipe here on allrecipe.com, but using the two together was a little over the top.

Love it!  I like to scatter chocolate chips over the top before baking, and ice with a cooled ganache (cream and chocolate).  This cake is definitely better the next day or after freezing and defrosting.

I was really surprised to have to add the boiling water at the end, because it made the batter very thin. However, it also made it really moist and delicious! I used the Chocolate Cheese Frosting from this website and they worked great together. Also, I used two cake tins, when they cakes were completely cooled, I cut the cakes in half and added the icing, so it had 3 extra layers of frosting! Won't be using a box anymore, thanks for a great recipe!

Awesome!  My fiance was craving a chocolate cake and I found this recipe.  What a hit!  Used safflower oil (the one healthy item in the whole mix) and I didn't use a mixer...just mixed by hand.  Topped with chocolate ganache from this site.  We each had a two slices and I kept a couple slices for my son and my Mom...the rest my fiance took to work and it was devoured.

This was a fabulous recipe. I cut it in half, but used 1/2 cup of cocoa and made cupcakes. i was also worried about how thin it was but they turned out perfect, I will definitely use this recipe again. Easy and very yummy! Thanks for posting.

Excellent Recipe!! I, based on other reviews, increased the cocoa to one cup and added a teaspoon of espresso powder to the water to bring out the taste of the chocolate a little more. I also only had a choice between skim milk and heavy whipping cream in my fridge and of course opted for the cream and the results were WONDERFUL!!!! I made cupcakes and they came out light and fluffy- this is a great recipe for a light, fluffy cake- if you are looking for a denser cake this isnt for you! Thanks for sharing!

I reduced the water by 1/4 cup in exchange for Kahlua and added 1 tsp cinnamon for a Mexican twist.  I upped the cocoa to 3/4 cup and added chocolate chips to the top.  This cake got rave reviews.

Thank you so much for this recipe! These were such a hit! I made cupcakes with no problem, didn't change a thing, they came out so moist and it was so easy to make! My health-nut of a boyfriend had 3-one after the other! This is a keeper...no more box mix!

I've used this recipe frequently. Once when a planned dessert failed I was able to whip this cake together at the last minute. I have used left over coffee in place of water with great results. When combined with cream cheese frosting the cake had an "Oreo" cookie flavor. Thanks for the recipe.

This really is the most wonderful chocolate cake, not to mention the fact that most bakers will have all the ingredients on hand anyway. I made these as cupcakes with buttercream icing...but what I did was half regular buttercream, and the other half, I made with ORANGE buttercream. Instead of adding milk and vanilla to the icing, added the same amount of orange juice and a little orange zest...c'mon....what a combination. Anyway, while I find a lot of chocolate cakes end up looking fantastic and tasting ordinary (especially store bought), this one is superior because it looks and tastes so intensely chocolaty. Enjoy!

THIS IS A PERFECT CHOCOLATE CAKE RECIPE.I MADE THE "RICH CHOCOLATE FROSTING" AND IT WAS DELICIOUS AS WELL.FOR THE FILLING I USED THE "FLUFFY WHITE FILLING" BUT I DIDN'T LIKE IT.IT HAS NO FLAVOUR.

I had made a chocolate cake with hot fudge sauce for my family's Easter dessert, but the cake was a disaster.  I made this one at the last minute as an attempt to save Easter dessert, and it was fantastic.  Very easy to make and resulted in a nice, rich, moist chocolate cake.  Definitely a keeper.

I have made this three times now, and every time has been fast, easy-peasy, and with perfect results. A moist and springy rich-flavoured cake. I LOVE it.
I halve the recipe and make one small cake in one 9" tin.

I liked this because I already had everything I needed to make this cake. It wasn't my favorite but it was good and my friends ate it all. It was also very easy and very moist. I frosted with the chocolate marshmallow frosting which I highly recommend.

Wow, this was excellent.  My husband and I are not chocolate cake fans but I needed a recipe for a birthday cake.  Tried this for the first time and we both thought it was a great recipe.  I did not do anything different.  It came out very moist.  This one is a keeper.

I made chocolate cupcakes with this recipe. I added about 8 ounces of chocolate (Bakers Semi sweet chocolate squares) for 24 serving. I found that even though I added chocolate to the recipe, it wasnât as sweet as I thought it was going to be. I would hate to think how bland the cupcakes would have been if I did not add chocolate. Not a bad basic chocolate cake recipe but I would recommend adding a bar of chocolate if you are looking for a strong chocolate flavour.

Great recipe! I have made many chocolate cakes before this one and...this is it. It has more flavor than others and doesn't taste like water. I used chocolate frosting 1 on this site as a topping and it went very well.Thanks for the recipe!

I would give this TEN stars if I could.  It's awesome!~

I made it with coffee instead of water.  It is moist and tasty!

I finished my cake with a buttercream frosting with raspberry filling.  pretty awesome!

I used one recipe for a 10" x 3" pan, and it baked for 50 minutes.  I used a heating core in the center.

This recipe is identical to the one that I've been using for years.  It's a family favorite, and the only chocolate cake recipe I've used in the last twenty years.  It's reliable and always moist.  I have yet to taste a chocolate cake recipe that I prefer.

It's only flaw is that it tends to fall--but I live in Colorado at 6,000 feet, so just about everything falls.  I add a little extra flour and reduce the sugar and leavening by about an eighth to make up for the high altitude.

Congratulations Shirley on a really quick, easy, tasty, moist and fool-proof recipe !

Thank you, also, Lonna Brown, for giving the 9x13 pan timing ... it was exactly what I wanted to make last week.

I had promised to make a Scooby Doo Mystery Mansion birthday cake for one of my grandchildren, so needed a non-sickly cake that didn't mind being cut into awkward shapes and stuck back together again !

This cake is not only light and moist, but it cuts a treat.

They say children are the world's severest critics ... well, I hope you'll be pleased to know that eighteen 5-6 year old Irish kiddies tucked in with a will and came back for seconds !

I'll definitely be making this one again and I might - if I'm lucky - manage to get a proper slice, rather than a few mouthfuls from the leftover trimmings.

Many thanks, Anonany

I made this cake again and the only change I made was using melted butter instead of oil.  I did notice the difference between a home made chocolate cake vs boxed, but I don't know if it's worth the effort.  Everyone thought it was just average.

I give this five stars because it's super easy to make, very moist and it made a great birthday cake for my 4 year old. I might add more cocoa next time, as I really, really love rich chocolate but as a cake with icing and decorations it's sweetness is absolutely perfect for everyone. I used Rick's buttercream frosting with amendments according to suggestions made and it was great. The batter easily made two 8*8 pans (you could squeeze out a little more into a loaf pan if necessary.) Thanks for the recipe and letting us know that the batter is runny.

Great cake and sooo easy!  I frosted each layer with store bought non dairy whipped topping and cherry pie filling and the sides with more whipped topping.  It would make a great valentine cake.

Wow!  So easy and moist!!! Everyone who I make this for says its the best they have had. For icing I whip a container of cream and then add a container of store bought icing for the perfect light and creamy whipped topping that is just the right amount of sweetness.

This cake was great and really moist. I needed something quick and easy for my boyfriend's birthday, and this only took about 15 minutes to mix up. I used store-bought chocolate frosting because I was low on time and then decorated the cake with M&Ms. It made an ultra cute birthday cake!

I've never attempted a chocolate cake before, and but this was one of the easiest cakes I've ever baked, and it is definitely the best tasting chocolate cake I've ever had. I chose this recipe for a casual dinner party, and it was completely devoured. 

A few notes about the recipe:
-The batter is incredibly thin. And it terrified me the first time, but it creates a moist, delicious cake. 
-I added in semi-sweet mini chocolate chips. Even with the thin batter, there were little chocolatey morsels throughout the cake.
-I prefer a bundt pan, it's easier than the two layer cake
-instead of frosting, I lightly dusted with powdered sugar

Again, it was an absolute hit (people were asking for seconds!) and the next day I was craving another piece but since it was all gone...I just made another cake!

Tastes really good. Giving 3 stars because the cake was kinda crumbly and hard to get out of the cake pans.

This was a really good basic chocolate cake. It was light and fluffy. Tasted kind of bland to me. I prefer a denser, fudgier cake. This was good, just not quite what I was looking for.

So so so good! I used the Chocolate Buttercream frosting to frost this cake and it turned out simply delicious! First cake I have made in quite a while that the whole cake disappeared in 2 days! Thanks for sharing!

I was looking for a cake to make for my sons bday so I made this as cupcakes for a trial run.  They turned out so moist and yummy.  I even used whole wheat pastry flour because we don't use white and it still was delicious, light, and fluffy. Goes great with Rich chocolate frosting also from this website.

This was a fantastic easy basic chocolate cake and is a great foil for whatever frosting you want on it.  Loved it and will now be my go to cake.  Did follow recommendation of other reviewer and increased cocoa to 1 cup total and was perfect amount of chocolate taste.  Thanks for this great recipe.

I had all the ingredients for this cake in my kitchen - the receipe is nice and simple. I divided the amounts in half to make a single layer and ate it without any icing. Even cooked for 35 minutes it was slightly underdone. This is a very rich cake - I can see why the receipe is supposed to serve 24 - a very small slice is sufficent! It is something you would want to eat as a special treat. Congratulations on concocting such a succulent cake receipe from such simple ingredients!

WOW! Amazing. The only thing with this recipe I didnt understand was the added boiling water. The batter looked reeeeally watery, so I just used 3/4 cup instead of the whole cup. It turned out amazing! Good job. I will be using this recipe again!

I think this is very much like the recepie on the hershey cocoa box. I make this recipe for cupcakes and birthday cakes all the time. It always turns out to be moist and delicious and gets rave reviews. It works to make a moist bundt cake or as the base for Death by Chocolate.

Absolutely fabulous cake!! Very moist, perfect texture, and amazing chocolate taste.  Followed recipe strictly, and results were perfect.  Make sure to grease and flour pans well to prevent sticking.  Better than anything you could buy.

THIS CAKE WAS SO MOIST AND HAD A VERY GOOD FLAVOR. I BELIEVE I FORGOT THE WATER. MY SON WAS "HELPING" ME AT THE TIME. IT SUNK IN THE MIDDLE (I AM SURE BECAUSE I LEFT THE WATER OUT WHICH WOULD MAKE IT MORE DENSE). WILL TRY AGAIN SOON.

This is a great recipe.  I've been using it for years.  It is the "Perfectly Chocolate" Chocolate Cake by Hersheys. It's been on the cocoa box for many many years.  (So it's ironic that one review mentions using a better cocoa than Hersheys).  Hersheys also provides a great chocolate icing that goes with it.  (Note: a great variation on this recipe is to use dark cocoa for a very rich dark chocolate cake)

Very good cake- easy to make- the whole family liked it!  I made it with half splenda/half sugar, baked in a 9 x 13 pan, and served unfrosted with whipped cream.  Delicious!  Thanks!

This is a great cake for layer cakes.  For people who are having trouble with the cake sticking and coming out in pieces, you absolutely HAVE to use parchment paper on the bottom of the pan.  Grease and flour the sides, but use parchment paper on the bottom.  The cake will come out perfectly.  It is a favorite with everyone every time I make this cake.    This cake does get better the next day.  I usually make this a day in advance.

This was really good. Mine sunk in the middle though. I am thinking that I need to make mine with High Altitude measurements.  Other than that, it turns out just like a store bought mix and is YUMMY!!  Thanks for the new recipe!!!

This is a delicious recipe. I made it yesterday and by night it was over. My family just loved it. I plan to make it again this weekend for potluck.

Just a note: just to avoid the cake sticking to the bottom of the pan I lined it with butter paper and the cake just sild out of the pan when I turned it.

YUM! Even my mother-in-law asked for the recipe. I made this for my husband's birthday and it turned out lovely and moist, baked 50 minutes in a large round tin - definitely a keeper! (By the way, this is a BIG cake, 10 decent slices is only half the cake - have encouraged my husband to take the rest to his office to stop me eating it)

This is the best chocolate cake I ever made. I made it for a family friend's birthday and the mother asked me which kind of bix I used - she was floored it was from scratch. I made my own ganache with dark chocolate, milk chocolate, cream and a little icing sugar and served it warm on the cake. People were fighting for the last piece, it was devoured in 5 minutes!

The only problem I had was that it suck to the pan (bundt pan) and didn't come out perfectly...maybe 20 mins cooling wasn't long enough.

I'm making it again for more company tomorrow night, lets see if I can stay out of it that long!

Wow! This cake was incredibly simple to prepare and so moist. Delicious cake that I will be making for all future birthdays! I used the frosting recipe on the back of the cocoa container, as suggested by another reviewer-that was great, too.

This was a good cake.  It was really rich, which I liked.  But it was kind of spongey.  I am not sure how to combat that.  But it was good.

Oh My! I've used recipes from this site for 4 years, and have never felt moved enough to review any!!  This cake was the best chocolate cake I've ever made, BY FAR!  Very moist, very flavorful, regardless of the brand of cocoa. I used the "fluffy peanut butter frosting", from this site, and it was such a compliment to a delicious cake.

I have already made this cake twice after just finding it about two weeks ago.  Nice and easy, very, very moist.  I did it in a bundt pan and just put a little powdered sugar on top.

This cake was wonderful. I actually started off wanting a raspberry filled cake. So I used this cake recipe, along with the frosting and raspberry filling recipes for 'Deep Chocolate Raspberry Cake'. The combination of the two made for a wonderful birthday cake!

Happy to be the 100th reviewer on this FABULOUS cake !! It couldn't be easier to make, and I made a fudge frosting and the combination was divine. Thanks for this awesome recipe, Shirley, my Thanksgiving guests were in heaven!
   Just one thing..the recipe says it yields 24 servings. I would like to propose that the cake is so good that the real estimation, at least in my house, was about 8 servings, lol.

This is it--the perfect recipe for chocolate cake.  My teenaged son actually embraced baking after tasting this cake and has made it numerous times.  We like it best with vanilla frosting, for contrast, but I imagine that any flavor of frosting--or even no frosting--would work equally well.  Enjoy!

This was incredible!!I made it for my son's birthday and the whole family wanted me to make this for there children's birthday's. I think that the "Perfectly Chocolate" Chocolate frosting that is on the back of the Hershey's Cocoa can is also what made this cake a hit. The frosting taste's like fudge.

I REALLY like the simplicity of this recipe thats why i tried it.
I substituted coffee for the boiled water and used buttermilk instead of milk.
It turned out moist and delicious. Even without the frosting this cake would stand on its own!!!

This is an excellent cake recipe.  I didn't have enough cocoa on hand, so I melted 2 2oz. bars of unsweetened chocolate and added it to my 1/4 cup of cocoa.  Turned out perfect.  I won't be using a box mix anymore!!

Very moist, but kind of sticky.  Cream cheese frosting was an excellent addition.

this was a really good chocolate cake.  the consistency was on the denser side which i liked.  it almost tasted like a red velvet cake.  the cake was so easy to prepare.  i chose to frost the cake with the fluffy peanut butter frosting off this site and topped with crushed peanut butter cups.  it was tasty!!!

If you love chocolate you will love this cake.  I myself am not a chocolate lover but my kids loved this.  This taste a lot like dark chocolate.  But this bakes beautifully.

I found this cake it awfully sticky. If I made it again I would dust the pans with powdered sugar instead of flour so that I can be more liberal.

I am no chef by far, but this was an easy to make cake.   I took it to my mom's birthday party, and hearing horror stories about me in the kitchen, several relatives were hesistant to eat it.  However, once they started, I didn't think they would stop.  Several people went back for seconds and everyone gave it rave reviews.  Coincidentally, it was the same recipe that was on the back of my Hersehey's Cocoa powder container.

Absolutely delicious, but not a good cake batter for cupcakes.  I had to clean up the edges, but the taste was unbelievable!

Very good, moist, and easy cake.  I made this as one of the cakes for my 2 son's combined birthday party.  This one was a hit!  Was gone long before the yellow cake.  Thanks!

My mom has a recipe that is almost exactly the same only it calls for half a teaspoon less of both baking soda and baking powder.  It also has a cup of strong coffee instead of boiling water.  This cake always turns out perfect and it tastes so good!!!!  Very easy!

I followed the recipe exactly. For some reason the middle did not cook. I had to increase the baking time to an hour, but the middle was still uncooked! Tasted good though.
