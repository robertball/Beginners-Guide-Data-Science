I have used this with my Foods classes and the kids loved it!  It is very easy and simple to make.

Good spinich dip to have with raw veggies.  It is a little on the salty side, but not so much that I wouldn't make it again.  I will just use a little less garlic salt next time.  Also would add a little more hot sauce.

I'm not a huge fan of celery and apparently that is what Beau Monde seasoning tastes like.  (Never used it before.) I would make this again, but substitute something for the Beau Monde seasoning, only because of my own preferences.   Significant other enjoyed.

Instead of he beau monde seasoning,  I used celery seed and seasoning salt. I also had to use more of  all the spices than what was listed. It is really a taste as you go thing.

I tried this for a party and it was a huge flop.  Maybe without the yogurt it would be okay, but it was too sweet.
