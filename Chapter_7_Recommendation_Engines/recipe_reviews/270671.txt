Very easy and delicious. I was looking last-minute for a non-marinated salmon recipe without too much sugar. I pan fried it since bread was rising in the oven. The pan got very black, but I transferred the salmon to another pan, added another Tsp of marsala wine, and put a lid on so the top of the fish would cook. Next time I will cook it in the oven, but it still turned out very good!

This was absolutely delicious!  The skin on the fish was crispy and amazing!  Loved by kids and adults.
