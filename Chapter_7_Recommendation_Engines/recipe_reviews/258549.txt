I really didn't think that the cabbage picked up the flavors the way I hoped they would.  I don't think I will be making this again.

I made this to use up a partial head of napa cabbage that I had leftover from making pot stickers. I used regular white mushrooms. This is okay, but it's missing something in my opinion. Salt? Some Sriracha maybe . . . I don't know. I'm going to doctor it up with some pork tenderloin tomorrow night and turn it into a main dish instead of a side dish. It does have potential though. Just needs some tweaking!

This is quick and very tasty. I used white  mushrooms. And it works as a leftover too.
