This Chicken Teriyaki Recipe was so great!!! I also used it as a marinade. I made the sauce the night before to save time when making it for dinner. I let the chicken sit in the sauce overnight and I think that helped a lot!!! The pineapple maybe should be saved to put in only 10 minutes before time to eat. My pineapple was a bit too soggy from being in the sauce baking for nearly 30 minutes.

Loved this recipe but I did change the proportions/ingredients slightly.  Instead of the chicken pieces, I used 3 boneless chicken breasts.  Only 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/2 cup white sugar, dried chopped onion instead of fresh, and for the pineapple I used a 20 ounce can of pineapple slices, used all of the juice in the teriyaki sauce, and then cut the slices into chunks.  I added the pineapple chunks to the sauce after thickening it before adding to the chicken.  And I poured the sauce over the chicken all at one time and then basted while baking.  The sauce was SO good over rice!

I only used 1 cup of the soy sauce and 1/2 cup of sugar and all of the pineapple juice that was in the can. The sauce by itself tasted really good, not too saucy and not too sweet. I didn't have any fresh ginger though, so I added about a teaspoon of powdered ginger. I was running out of time to wait for everything to thicken, so I threw it all into the same pan and cooked it all together so I'd have a bit of a sauce to put with the rice I was making! Delish!

I think if I try this again I will use a low sodium soy, the sauce was so salty I could barely stand it... The sugar was barely noticeable over the salt. I am hoping that with that change it will taste more like Teriyaki because in tonight's dinner it really didn't. It wasn't horrible, but I was expecting better.

Just made this tonight and it was so very good!! I just cook for two so I just made it with the drumsticks and cut everything else down by a third. I also did not have cornstarch, pineapple chunks, onion, or fresh ginger -- I substituted a tropical mixed fruit cup, onion powder and ground ginger. I added a pinch of flour instead of cornstarch to see if it would compare -- not really. But the flavor was delicious!! I cooked it longer than it said b/c it just didn't look done and I also cut the oven up to 425 at that point. I think next time I'll cook it at 400 or so anyway for the time directed. :) Great recipe, thanks for sharing!!

I just made this for dinner and it was very good. I didn't have cornstarch or ginger. I used a stir fry sauce with garlic and ginger in it and it turned out very good. I also grated the garlic and onion instead of chopping it, which I think made a difference. I added some red pepper flakes for some spice and I think some green onion would be in the sauce as well. I would highly recommend using low sodium soy sauce. It was a little saltier than I prefer.

The recipe is easy to follow, I changed it a little because I thought the sauce was too salty for my taste. I used 1 cup of soy sauce, 1.2 cup of sugar, 1/3 cup of honey, and dried ginger instead of fresh. The honey at the end cut the saltiness. I also did not use salt on the chicken pieces in the pan, I found the soy was enough.  I had a lot of sauce for the 7 pieces of chicken I used.  Overall a good, quick, recipe, I will use it again.

This was really GOOD! I changed it up a bit as always... I cubed a yellow bellpepper, used less sugar and more pineapple juice, less soy sauce and put some whorstichire (Sp?) sauce in its place, a dash of red pepper flakes, added some of the pineapple into the sauce that was crushed a bit, put some rosemary on the chicken breast instead of salt and pepper (Enough of that in the sauce) Used chicken breasts instead of what was on the list. I made extra sauce and put it over white jasmine rice. AMAZING!!! MMMMmmmMMMmmmm

This is a good recipe, but a little sweet... Next time I will cut down on the sugar maybe 1/2 cup.  I used boneless, skinless breasts (4) and halved the sauce.  Thanks for sharing!

I really wasn't impressed. I made exactly as directed and it was way too salty.  Tasted more like soy sauce than teriyaki. If I make this again I will for sure change it up by cutting the soy sauce in half and using brown sugar rather than white sugar for a richer sweet taste and to help it thicken a little better as my sauce never really thickened as much as I would have liked.

I did have to modify based on what I had in the house and considering the recommendations from previous review, but overall SOOOO GOOD!!  I used only a cup of soy sauce.  Due to lack of ingredients, used 2 tablespoons of all purpose flour instead of cornstarch, 1/2 tsp nutmeg mixed with 1/2 tsp of paparika instead of fresh ginger, and only a 8 oz can of sliced pineapples (cut into chunks) and 14 drumsticks.  I did used a little season salt on the chicken before covering with sauce.  Definitely making this again!!! And definitely recommend it.

Let me start by saying I don't even like Teriyaki, I tried this because the hubby and son love it. I have made this like 10 times already and its fantastic. I use brown sugar instead of white, I also use low sodium soy sauce, and use all of the pineapple juice. The sauce is flavorful enough that I don't salt the chicken. The first time I made this my 2 yr old ate 8 drumsticks, poor daddy only got 2. Even my nephew who just flat out hates eating likes this. The only con is that I end up eating too much. Oh and sometimes I don't have real ginger so I use ground ginger and the soy sauce bottle only contains about 15 oz so I use that instead of the 18 required. Thanks.

This was a nice easy recipe for weekday meals that I'll use again.  My husband, who is pretty picky, loved this recipe.  As other reviewers have commented, the original recipe is on the salty side.  I used low sodium soy sauce and omitted the rest of the salt from the recipe.  This recipe works well for bone-in chicken breasts too.  During the last 10 mins of cooking I threw half of a green pepper and half of a red pepper cubed into the pan. This made it a complete meal when served with rice.

This is a keeper! I took the advise of the others and also cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup and used a low sodium soy sauce. I also threw in a bit of crushed red pepper and used all the pineapple juice. No fresh ginger on hand so 1 teaspoon of ground. I have 6 children so 6 chicken breasts went into the oven and I did not alter the sauce and had PLENTY!!  Will definitely make this again!

When I saw over 2 cups of soy sauce in this recipe, I thought it may be too much. So I reduced it to 3/4 cup. It was still incredibly salty (and I like salt). I must have put in over a cup of sugar plus some brown sugar to cut the salt and it was still too salty. I couldn't eat it. My husband, being the gentleman he is, ate two drumsticks, but it was only the 2nd time in 5 years that he didn't compliment my meal.  Warning: If the soy sauce measurement is not a typo, then do not use this recipe as is.

The Best teriyaki sauce I have ever had! My husband is basically obsessed with it! I will never buy bottled sauce again. It's so easy and takes no time at all to make. I made a bunch of sauce one time so I can have it on hand. Works great for summer grilling. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this for dinner tonight. I used a little less sugar and all the juice from pineapple. It was delicious!! For side dishes, I had stir fry veggies and brown rice. I also had chicken thighs instead of pieces.

It was more soy sauce than teriyaki flavor.  I ended up adding ingredients... more sugar, teriyaki sauce.  By the time I finished doctoring it, it was good.  I will be looking for a new recipe.

This is very good and flavorful.  The marinade is excellent!  I had to allow way more time for the chicken to cook, as the pieces were not boneless.  It took almost two hours if you include the time to take out of the oven every 10 minutes to brush on the sauce again.  I believe that the next time I make it, I will marinate overnight and perhaps use boneless chicken.

Tried this tonight with cut up chicken breasts and it was delicious! Without the adjustments though I feel like it would've been too salty. There's definitely too much soy sauce. I did 1/2c sugar, a little bit over 1/4c of soy sauce, and all of the juice from the can, this was definitely enough for 3 chicken breasts and about 1/2 cup extra. Sautée some onions, broccoli, and zucchini and add some of the sauce when they're almost done cooking and you have the perfect veggie side.

It was great but too salty.  As others have said, low sodium soy sauce would probably solve that problem.
