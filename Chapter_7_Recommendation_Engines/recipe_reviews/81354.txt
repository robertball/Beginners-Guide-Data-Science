Excellent, You need Ghee, But I found this on how to make it 
How to make Ghee At Home
Pure unsalted Butter (not margarine)

   1. Heat butter in a saucepan in high-medium heat until it boils or bubbles.
   2. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook uncovered until butter turns to a clear golden color. (Butter usually begins to boils with lots of bubbles. When it is done, it will have foams on top of it indicating that ghee is nearly done.)
   3. Cool it and store it in dry container. Use ghee in you regular cooking.
 I added I can of rinsed chickpeas/garbanzo beans and served it with whole wheat naan, this is how a local indian restaurant we go to has served it. Also its took me no more the 30 minutes from start to finish with clean up. Be careful the yellow colored sauce tends to stain things.

Great base curry, but it needs a bit of tweaking to make it perfect.  Double all spices, add one chopped onion to saute pan, add one bunch chopped cilantro at the end, use either greek yogurt or coconut milk in place of regular yogurt, add a lot more peas (use petite ones for sweetest flavor), and most important: fry the cubed potatoes on high in a bit of oil BEFORE adding them to the pan (don't let them cook all the way through), and they will keep that crispy outside but creamy, flavorful inside.

Dead on for the cooking time. Ended up mild (but that was no surprise, since that’s what it is supposed to be!) so it wasn’t my favorite, next time I will probably add more peas and double the spices- and probably add some either ground or rough cut onions when the potatoes go in. Overall really nice texture. I would serve this with Naan and not Rice, however, the potatoes and rice made too much of a similar texture and I didn’t like it at all. Also be aware that it will thicken a bit as it sets out- so make it a little thinner than you would like- just add more water as you need. Really simple base recipe you could take a lot of places! I think this is especially a good recipe if you are trying to get someone into the world of curries. A good ‘beginner’ dish, if you will, because of the mildness. Thanks for the recipe!

Yum Yum Yum. I like my food spicy, so I doubled all of the spices and also added garlic and onion. My whole family enjoyed this!

Wonderful!  I added about 2 full cups of peas to the recipe because I love peas.  I like to avoid butter of any kind so instead of ghee, I used 1 tbs of butter and 1-2 tbs of olive oil.  The flavor was not lacking and I will continue to make it this way.

After reading all the reviews, this is what I did - I used ghee, probably doubled all the spices - I did big heaping tsps and then tasted as it was cooking and added more along with garlic powder (fresh garlic would've been better, but I was lazy) - I did the water and a cup of coconut milk and also added a can of garbonzo beans and instead of peas I used chopped baby spinach.  It's really good!!  Spicy and comforting - way better than my generic curry powder.

I omitted the yogurt completely and this dish was delicious. I doubled the spices and the potatoes had a nice bite to them.

i used a full tsp of cayanne and thought it spiced it up really well.  i added chopped onion, 1 clove garlic, Fat Free yougart and a little leftover califlower i had in the fridge.  next time (there will be many next times) i will cut the onion thicker, use more garlic and a lot more califlower.  tasted very authentic indian. 5 STARS!

Wwhen I told my husband that the recipie was unrated he said, "Give it 5 stars." He likes things spicy and I like things bland. This recipie was flavorful enough for him with not too much of a bite for me. I did have trouble making the ghee.

I make this all the time. It's delicious. I double all spices, skip the peas and add chicken. I also throw in a diced onion. You don't need ghee. Ghee is clarified butter and has a munch longer shelf life than regular butter, which is why Indians use it. Any other fat works well here. So why not skip all that saturated fat and use a healthy vegetable oil. Sometimes I use soybean, olive or canola oil. Makes no difference.

I doubled the spices and added 2 cups of peas, as well as an onion  and a clove of garlic.  The flavor was terrific, but my husband and I both thought the yogurt overwhelmed the dish.  We like things spicy, and I think the yogurt diluted the spices a bit, and made everything a little too creamy/tangy for our taste.  But still, a beautiful recipe, that I'll be making variations of for a long time!  Thanks!

Very delicious.  I added cut up chicken at the same time that I added the potatoes.  The chicken was very tender, and the dish was very filling.  I added more salt than the recipe called for because the potatoes really soak it up.  Also, I purchased clarified butter in the Indian food section of my local grociery store.

This was soooo delicious!  I grew up in SE Asia and this totally hit the spot for me.  I doubled (or maybe even tripled) the spices, especially the spicy ones, and also added a can of chick peas because that's how I remember it as a kid.  I also added minced garlic at the beginning.  Even my all American burger-lovin' hubby gobbled this down and said I can make it again.  I served it with homemade naan.  Wonderful!

This is a family favorite. You do NOT need ghee. I use real butter and it's fantastic! I DO, however, almost double the spices. :)

This recipe is most certainly a keeper. Its simple, and very flavorful. Just like it says, it is very mild. I adjusted the recipe for 2 servings, then doubled the spices, making the spices a bit more intense. I didn't have Ghee, So I used butter instead. Nor did I have yogurt, so the next best thing was Sour Cream, Which worked remarkably fine by the way. I enjoyed this recipe, and I will be making it again soon! Highly recommended! Thanks :)

It was really good, I did what others said and doubled the spices, and it was a bit too spicy, although I didnt have any turmeric or ginger to substitute... I think next time I would cook the potatoes in chicken stock instead of water, just because I feel like it was missing something and I think chicken might help, so I'd suggest perhaps using chicken bouillon instead of salt... I also added more peas, and would consider adding chickpeas and perhaps coconut milk.

Really tasty recipe.  And fairly quick and easy to make.  I substituted milk for half the cream to bring the calorie/fat content down a little bit.  Reheated well the second day too.

Like others I made a few modifications. Sauteed onions and garlic with the other spices to start. Added some carrots. Swapped sweet potatoes for the regular- less carbs! Also threw some cilantro on top. Overall great!

Easy and tasty. Instead of ghee I used two tablespoons of olive oil and one tablespoon of butter. I also added chickpeas for some additional protein/fiber. Turned out great!

Good.  Spicy with my changes.  I doubled the cumin seed and coriander.  Did not use mustard seed.  Added 3/4 of an onion (chopped up) and 1 clove of garlic (minced) and a can of garbanzo beans.  Used 3 T olive oil instead of ghee.  Increased the peas to 2 cups.  I used 3/4 cup yogurt (that is what is in a single serve yogurt container.  Next time I would increase the amount of yogurt to 2 containers.

This is quite good as is, but I make it healthier by using 2 T olive oil instead of the ghee, fat free yogurt, and serve over brown rice.  A heart-healthy meal that my kids will eat.

Wow!  This tasted just like the fare from an Indian Restaurant, with a few changes. I subbed black pepper for cayenne as it's all I had on hand, added the written amount of turmeric, but doubled all of the other spices and salt.  I also added a grated onion and 2 cloves of garlic while the potatoes were cooking.  The cooking times were spot-on, and this is best over basmati rice. Yum!

I used olive oil instead of ghee and sauteed garlic in it before adding the potatoes and spices. I also uses 1/4 of an onion when adding the potatoes. Greek yogurt works best for the yogurt part, so try that if you haven't.

I usually don't rate if I don't follow the recipe correctly but this spice base was so good I just have to. I only had 1 potato so I added 1 onion, a can of chickpeas and some frozen peas & other veg mixture. I did add a tiny bit of Penseys sweet curry and a sprinkle of dried cilantro (coriander leaves) as I had no fresh for garnish. I added some chicken bouillon to the water. This is really tasty! Thanks, next time I will use this and make sure I have more potatoes!

Good recipe, simple instructions tasted really yummy. I made some chapati breads to serve along with the curry. Mine was a bit more liquids then the picture next time I wont use all 2 cups of water.

very mild turned into very bland for me.. i doubled the spices and was still left unsatisfied with the dish.. added equal amounts of chopped baby carrots, corn, and onion to make this heartier.. also added crushed garlic but even that didn't really save it.. nothing to write home about.. sorry

I wanted something mild so the kids could eat it too. This was a little too hot for us, but we made some changes. 1st we changed the serving to 6 so we could get more sauce. 2nd we used frozen diced breakfast potatoes to cut prep time. 3rd we added 1 zucchini, 1 cup chopped broccoli 1 onion coarse chopped and some garlic powder. we used the Greek yogurt but didn't have enough so we used some heavy cream we had in the fridge. The changed servings said to use 3/4 tsp of cayenne but we decided to use only 1/2 tsp and we found it to be still a bit too hot. My husband loved it! but me and the kids would have liked it a little milder. Very tasty though! We served it over basmati rice and naan on the side

Delicious! I make this recipe at least once a month now. This curry is easy and makes a great side dish for spicy tomato curries. If you are sensitive to spicy foods, use a little less cayenne than the recipe calls for. To my taste buds, this recipe isn't spicy at all, but I had a friend over for dinner who thought it was too much.

I had higher expectations for this dish! It turned out to be very bland, even after doubling the seasonings. And it had a funky aftertaste, too! I don't think I'll try this one again, but it was worth a shot.

This dish was okay, it had tons of seasoning but still came off as bland.  This looked very similar to a favorite dish of mine except the dish I've had used tomatoes in the sauce.  I added some diced tomatoes and garbanzo beans and it helped, but I think this dish still needs some tweaking.

It is very delicious!  My husband loves this dish now.  I do not put in the peas (I'm not a pea fan) but I threw in some frozen spinach and it was just as delicious!    I found it to me a little too mild, so I kicked up the spices by double and added a little fennel seed into the recipe.  It turned out superb!    We had this with basmati rice and garlic nan.

Good Curry flavor. I did double the spices as others recommended. We both enjoyed this recipe and will make it again! Im giving 5 stars for the base recipe as I know everyones tastes are different and me doubling up on the spices is my choice as I like things a bit spicy!

I think this is a good recipe with great potential but mine turned out a bit bland so I would make the following changes.  I definitely recommend doubling the spices.  I also used one 14oz can coconut milk instead of yogurt which I really liked, but next time will use half of the can instead of a whole one (i felt it kind of diluted the spices).  I think everything is better with onion and garlic so I also sauteed 1/2 onion and 2 cloves minced garlic in the ghee, then continued with the recipe.  I'll definitely try it again.

I loved this, even though the consistency was a little thin, I will add less water next time. I used red potatoes because i think waxy potatoes hold up with rice (basmati) and starchy ones turn too mushy. I also added one clove of garlic, half an onion and a small zucchini. This was my first time making curry but I was impressed, it came out better than what I have had at restaurants.

This is a wonderful mild curry! Very creamy and filling. Added some chicken when I put in the peas and it turned out great. Can't wait to make it again. Also, I didn't know how to make ghee, so I just used butter -- didn't have any adverse effects that I'm aware of.

I made this curry for myself, my boyfriend and a friend and we all really liked it.  I like how inexpensive and easy (though a bit time consuming) it is to make.  The changes I made were to double all the spices (actually quadrupled the cayenne and it still didn't seem spicy, I think I might have mislabeled paprika!), add more salt, use olive oil and I also had to add about a cup and a half more water because so much cooked off.  This is a great curry and I look forward to making it again.

AWESOME. That's it. It has been in heavy rotation in our house for years (since 2006! Am editing this in 2012), I make it with 3 potatoes and a can of chickpeas. My 8 month old daughter LOVES this curry. I mash it and water it down a little, and add a bit of organic rice cereal for her :)

I wasn't a huge fan particularly because of the flavor. I think anyone who enjoys an Indian style curry will enjoy this recipe, I would recommend doubling the spices like some of the previous reviews have suggested and adding red-pepper or something spicy to up the heat if you like things hotter, it is a very mild curry.

In agreement with previous reviews, double the curry spices or this is pretty bland.  Also, I substututed olve oil for ghee and omitted frozen peas (yes Indian festaurants use them but they're still, well, frozen peas) and added a couple cups of carefully washed fresh spinach just before the yogurt, it doesn't take long to cook and adds to the nutrition.  And as in all potato recipes, I didn't peel them.  All this worked out fine.

Very easy to make, and was very mild. I like hot curry, but I still liked this one. The first time I made it I stuck to the recipe, the second time I added an extra 50% of all of the spices...so if it called for 1 tsp I added 1 1/2 tsp. It came out superb, and had a little more kick. This pleased the people that don't like hot curry perfectly. 5 Stars!!!

I was looking for a very mild curry, but despite what other reviews said this curry had some kick to it.

Love this recipe.  I have made this several times.  I too use coconut milk instead of yogurt.

AWESOME! after trying to fake basmati, peas & carrots curry (no sauce) to no avail & not liking pre-packaged fare much either, this is the 1st real curry i've cooked & it's DELICIOUS! it's a good "mild & basic" curry with a subtle heat aftertaste.    i was hoping for more of a the coriander sweetness or cilantro "freshness" etc. i've tasted in restauraunts, but just like the 1st time i tasted indian food, this dish grew on me and is a total keeper! it's the curry equivilent of "comfort food".    i made a "1/2 batch" & subbed olive oil for ghee as mentioned, added extra yoghurt for creaminess. 1 tsp of generic curry powder for "sweetness" & used 1 can of peas & it's juice and loved it so much i joined this site to give it five stars.    a nice subtle recipe with all of it's flavors in harmony that doesn't bury the mild flavor of the peas. this curry will sit alongside other spicier (& expensive ingredient) curries when i find some other good looking recipes.    it's a perfect starter curry for those afraid of spicy foods and curries can get HOT & but is actually SPICIER than the bland watered down stuff you get in oregon restaunts! if you hate bland foods, DON'T move to oregon!     it's ironic that a state whose name is one letter shy of the name of a SPICE is home to kung po chicken that tastes like candy & indian foods that taste like veggie soup.    MANY THANKS for awakening my tastebuds to something TASTY besides homemade hotwings & chilli.

To really make this work, I suggest you change the milk/water to coconut milk (2 cans), double the spices and peas, and add an onion. But then it really is a nice dish!

Fantastic!  It does help to add some garlic and onion and to use a bit less yogurt, though.

I wasn't able to get ghee, so I substituted olive oil, which may have affected the taste.  I found it was spicy, but didn't have a lot of flavour.

I doubled the spices except for turmeric and cayenne as suggested by earlier reviews. The curry turned out delicious! It took about 20min for the potatoes to be fully cooked. I think next time I will add some grated onion and some minced garlic as others have suggested, although the curry was still great without those ingredients.

Absolutely delicious and a very flexible recipe. I'm not a vegetarian so we had this as an accompanying vegetable dish to go with some fat homemade sausages. Really delicious. Empty plates all round.

Very delicious, *mild* curry. Perfect base recipe - easy to spice it up a little or a lot. I do agree with previous reviewers that have found the sauce a little thin - next time I'll use less water.

Excellent, did not have ghee so I used margarine.I know it would've been better w/ghee. I did not have cumin seeds so I just used powder. I did not have cayenne pepper so I just used chili powder. I needed to use up some milk so I used half 2% milk & half water. I only had vanilla yogurt on hand & it turned out wonderful. Instead of frozen peas I used frozen mixed vegetables & I increased the amount to 1 & 1/2 cups at least. I must not of cut my potatoes small enough though b/c I did have to cook them longer. I thought about adding more seasonings but there are different types of curry & decided to try this one just as it was. I would definatly make again, maybe next time w/more spices. Thank-you!

This was good and very easy to make. I doubled the spices and subbed coconut oil for ghee. I cooked it a bit differently: I covered the pan while sauteing the potatoes in the first step, then I used only a cup of water and covered the pan to simmer; they were ready in 20 min. I used a can of coconut milk instead of yogurt, and the consistency was just right. If I make this again, I'll add cauliflower.

If you use fresh spices, this will be more than enough spicy!  After reading the other reviews here's what I did: I used 3 instead of 6 potatoes, but still used the same amount of ghee and spices.  I used just a little extra cayenne and so so so so flavorful and spicy it was!!!!  I also used half of the yogurt called for and was not lacking for sauce and had not issue with overpowering yogurt flavor.  Would have been great with naan if I had any, instead I made falafels, which I know is greek, but it was very tasty together.  Will absolutely make again!

This was seriously good.  I did as some other reviewers suggested, and added an onion & two minced cloves of garlic.  I also substituted butter for the ghee, and used fresh cracked pepper instead of coriander.  Oh, and I also doubled the spices- it was slightly too spicey for me, so next time I will try it with the spices as-is.  The sauce was a little thinner than expected, but it still had great flavor, and thickened up the next day for leftovers.

I doubled the spices in this recipe and, thanks to my favorite Indian restaurant, still thought it came out bland. If you are accustomed to rich flavors that you will get at the restaurant, then definitely triple or quadruple the amount of spices added in. Also, it tasted better the day after making it rather than the night of. I will be making it again just because it was simple, filling, and the idea is right, but my tastes require stronger spices.

This was very mild and even with curry powder added it was still too plain.  If you want something that's a little indian but not a lot, this is it.

Way too spicy--I'd cut the cayenne in half. Very time-consuming, too. It's okay with a salad.

Used 1 T. & 2 tsp. butter & 2 tsp. olive oil instead of ghee (for approximately 2 servings). Added a smidge more of the dry ingredients than called for. First used mustard ground but then discovered I actually did have the seeds. Added a small amount of dried minced garlic about ¼ tsp. Could maybe cut down on the amount of water added next time, seemed to be just a tad too watery at the end. Made with Jerra fried rice (from this site) & Murg Makhani.

This recipe was amazing.  I brought it with me to a friends "summerfest" and it was a huge hit.  Her mother is from Britain and she said that she couldn't believe how similar it was to what she would have had back home.  Talk about a compliment!

Great recipe... I added mixed veggies like someone else had mentioned and served over brown rice. Next time I think i'll omit the cayenne pepper b/c it over powered the curry flavor. I'll probably add onion and cardamom next time.
