I personally liked the recipe.  My husband ate it, but he wasn't thrilled with it.  I guess he thought it was bland, so he put Tobasco on it.  I made it exactly, but didn't have an onion.  I'm also confused by the butter to breadcrumps ratio because I used 4 T of butter and it didn't come close to blending with all the bread crumbs, therefore leaving a dry layer on top of casserole after baking, which I just basically scooped off.  Maybe I was supposed to use real bread instead of the canned bread crumbs??

My family LOVED this recipe. I thought it was a little salty, so I might try using unsalted butter next time, or just leaving out the butter when I make the rice. I definitely won't cut the soy sauce because it adds a great flavor.
I was looking for something a little different to use up leftover turkey, and this was perfect. Delicious!

I used scallions instead of white onion. It was fantastic and I will definitely make it again.

Made a mixture of wild rice, brown rice and quinoa and cooked until almost done then proceeded with recipe as written. Chop up the sliced water chestnuts to spread crunchiness throughout. That and the soy sauce gives it a slightly chinese food taste. Was luscious!

This was a good base recipe. I used leeks instead of onion, added broccoli, sliced mushrooms, and 3 cloves chopped garlic, and saut√©ed the fresh veggies just a little to meld their favors before combining with the rest of the ingredients. I also had to use crushed crackers for the top since that was what I had around. The soy sauce really enhances the flavor, I would suggest to those who thought it bland to add a dash more of that and see if it pops. Thanks for the recipe!

Added poultry seasoning and garlic powder to help perk up the flavor. After baking for 30 minutes, the celery was still uncooked. It has the potential to make for a good meal.
