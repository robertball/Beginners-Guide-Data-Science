I liked the flavor of the sauce and the beans. The greens were a bit bitter for me but that is I think personal preference. I had thought I grabbed a can of white beans at the market, but I grabbed pink.. so I used those. I might make this again, but with spinach which for me is a milder flavor. Updated - I had some leftovers of this for dinner tonight  and the bitterness has toned down considerably. If you are new to greens, like me, I'd recommend making these a day before you plan to eat them.. it really improved it!

Delicious as is or withe the addition of chicken, fish or even peppered bacon.  I usually make this in a similar manner with a swig of white wine instead of viengar and add a protein, pasta and aditional olive oil with or without cheese (shreds of parm are my favorite) as a meal.  Crusty bread is great for dipping/

Great taste.  I used this recipe with a mix of turnip and mustard greens and the flavor was fantastic!

I had never eaten mustard greens before, so I made this recipe to give them a try. I liked the greens, but I wish there were more of the added seasonings for a stronger flavor. I'll double the seasonings next time I try this recipe - but I will definitely make it again!

How could I NOT try a recipe from a gal whose nickname is "fishnets."
Actually it was quite good. The previous recipe I had didn't use the vinegar, sugar and dry mustard, which livend it up.

Ok, I would have given this a 4 1/2 but ...obviously I couldn't.  This was my absolute FIRST time eating much less MAKING mustard green.  Never had em, never ate em.  I had TONS growing in the garden(tried something new) I really liked this. Didn't have nutmeg so I was nervous about the bitterness, but it wasn't at all.  Did it exactly as directed except 2 things- used apple cider vinegar and I used double the amount of garlic SCAPES rather than cloves...its what I had.  DELISH. Other reviewers say that its better the next day- can't wait to try!

These were great. I sautéed 6 slices of good smokey bacon in the olive oil and then proceeded with the rest of the recipe.  I also doubled the liquid as we like our greens in a little broth.  I will definitely make these again.

So good.  I doubled the garlic and did a full teaspoon of mustard and a full teaspoon of red pepper flakes (we like a little heat).  Forgot to add salt or pepper, still loved it.

This is pretty good.  I have never eaten mustard greens until this recipe, and they stuck me as a little odd tasting, but the flavors of the seasonings were very good which saved the dish, in my opinion.  I added pork sausage to make it more hearty, which I sauteed with the onions, drained the grease, then added the garlic, and after a minute or two proceeded with the rest of the recipe.

Been making beans n greens for many a year, usually with black-eyed peas,ham, and Franks RedHot.  tried  this, and wow. Yummy.
Still good with some ham added.
For a quick kid-friendly way to serve it once it's leftovers, roll some up in a Mu Shu wrapper, with 1/3 oz of cheddar and nuke.

I loved this recipe.  Not being very familiar with cooking greens, I found this easy, quick and very tasty.  I added a little nutmeg in case the greens were bitter, but it probably didn't need it.  My family loved it too!

This is my new favorite lunch. If you have leftover bacon fat, add that to it. The red pepper adds just enough zip. An excellent recipe.

Wasn't the biggest fan of mustard greens as they can be a bit "chewy".  But I didn't want to let that affect my rating as it is a personal preference.  This is a great option for a healthy side dish.  We added some crumbled feta cheese on top.  Went great with fish.

Fantastic recipe! I had never eaten mustard greens but now living in the south I felt we needed to get on board with this green. I added some fat back (new for me, too) and a splash of white wine. We loved this!

This is delicious! I made it exactly as is only I threw in some bacon pieces and cooked before adding onion and the garlic. It would be perfect without it too. Simple and yummy!

Didn’t realize my review would post as soon as I hit enter! I guess no new paragraphs, then. LOL! I had no mustard greens, but I had a mish mosh of different greens from my weekly veggie box that needed to be cooked up. Beet greens, chard, baby bok choy, spinach, and a few others. I used apple cider vinegar because I wanted the flavor to be a little softer. Instead of regular onion and garlic, I used a spring onion and some garlic scapes. And I used a can of butter beans (rinsed and drained) instead of cannellini beans. Oh, and I used only a tablespoon of oil. It came out very tasty, and I took it as a side dish for a small potluck dinner last night. We didn’t eat all of it (only four of us there), so I brought home the leftovers. Just had a serving with eggs for breakfast, yum. One of the folks at the potluck remarked on the spiciness - I think she may have gotten a bigger piece of the red pepper flakes. She didn’t dislike it, just was taken by surprise a bit, so if you make it, be aware of the preferences of the folks who’ll be partaking and adjust as needed. I will definitely make this again!

Nice vegetarian version of a southern classic. I like it best with ground sausage, but I can't feed that to our vegetarian friends and this recipe is a fine alternative. Try it with pepper vinegar as a condiment!
