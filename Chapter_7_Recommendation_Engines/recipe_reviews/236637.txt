The flavors where ok. Would have been better as either a traditional lasagna or using other noodles like a rotini pasta. Made per recipe it was slop like.

I absolutely love pastitsio, but I hate how long it takes to make it. This is a fabulous and much lower fat substitute. The Greek yogurt gives it just the right creaminess. I followed the recipe except for only using half of the balsamic vinegar. I used gluten free lasagna noodles, so I had to cook it a little bit longer. Also, I like mine extra thick, so I added cornstarch at the very end. Definitely a keeper.

I was actually looking for a stovetop lasagna recipe to use up some ricotta cheese and decided to give this a try. I used ricotta instead of yogurt and feta, and it was delicious!

Absolutely outstanding! The mix of Greek spices with traditional lasagna is absolutely amazing. Served it with garlic bread...or could use more traditional Greek bread. Going directly into our cookbook of tried and true recipes!
