This recipe looked great as is, but after reading other reviews, I decided to take some of their suggestions. I coated the chicken with lightly seasoned flour prior to browning them. After the breasts were cooked, I removed them from the pan and sautéed 2 minced cloves of garlic, ½ of an onion, chopped, and 1 cup of sliced mushrooms until the onion was soft and the mushrooms were mostly cooked. Then I added the cream, mustard and tarragon with the garlic, onions, and mushrooms. I also tripled the cream-mustard-tarragon “gravy” as we like extra. I served this wonderful chicken with mashed potatoes and asparagus. We will definitely make this again!  UPDATE: I have made this dish again, and this time I made a few more changes that previous reviewers had mentioned. I rubbed a light coating of Dijon mustard on the chicken breasts a few hours before cooking and let them sit. I still coated the breasts in seasoned flour before browning. Once the chicken was cooked and I removed it from the pan, I added a splash of white wine (slightly less than a quarter cup) to deglaze the pan prior to sautéing the onions, garlic and mushrooms. My husband said it was the best! This time I served it with Stove-Top chicken dressing and a salad.

This recipe was very good.  I added a few things that rounded out the flavors.  Changes I made:
1. I coated the chicken with seasoned flour before sauteing in butter/oil mixture.
2. Once the chicken was done, I added 2 minced garlic cloves and 1 minced shallot to the drippings and cooked until soft.  
3. I deglazed the pan with a glug of white wine before adding the cream.

The garlic, shallots and wine deepened the flavors and gave the dish a better finish.  This will definately be one of our favorites from now on!

I'm a personal chef who uses allrecipes ALL of the time. Put this together and it was an incredible hit, had two guests that were from New York City and the other from Philadelphia, both cities incredible hot spots for the worlds best restaurants, they couldn't believe they found a dish comperable if not better here in the Montana mountains that parallel the big cities best. Thank you and allrecipes for all my great recipes

As is, I would say this was an okay recipe, but with a few modifications, it is excellent. I coated the chicken in dijon mustard about 3 hours before cooking. Then I dipped in flour and sauteed in oil & butter. I made the sauce as directed, but increased the cream so there would be more sauce. Yummy! The chicken was incredibly tender and moist. My husband raved about it.

I too made some adjustments on this recipe.  I took the advice of others and dusted the chicken with flour and I doubled the sauce recipe.  PLUS, after removing the chicken I deglazed the pan with dry white wine, after it reduced by half I added finely chopped shallots.  After the shallots cooked for a few minutes I then added the cream.  Instead of tarragon in the sauce I added Herbes de Provence, stirred then added back the chicken.  I garnished the chicken with fresh chopped tarragon.  We used the sauce for the asparagus on the side.  My kids (10 & 12) loved the sauce and the chicken.  They actually used the sauce to disguise the taste of the asparagus.  This is a keeper recipe and I've shared it with friends.  Nice and easy but definitely a show stopper.

Tasty, easy recipe. My husband loved it and I didn't let on just how easy it was. I changed it some based on the reviews and on our dietary needs: Marinate the chicken breasts for a few hours in white wine and lemon juice. Convection bake at 325 for 20 minutes while making sauce. (These two pre-steps tenderize the chicken.) In a sauce pan, melt 1 TBS unsalted butter and add about 1/4 cup diced red onions, cooking a few minutes. Add about 1/3 cup sliced portabello mushrooms and saute until mushrooms are cooked. Pour into bowl and set aside. Pour 1/2 cup of fat-free half & half to heated saute pan and heat on medium until hot. Whisk into cream 2 TBS Dijon mustard. Stir in 2 TBS chopped fresh Tarragon. Add in onion-mushroom mixture and lower heat to a low simmer. Place baked breasts on a lightly greased heated grill pan and grill 3 minutes each side or until chicken is cooked through. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place on plates and ladle sauce on top. Voila! A gourmet meal awaits.

Excellent recipes and good company fare. The only changes I made is to deglaze the pan with white wine (next time I will try brandy), added some chopped garlic and used unsalted butter.  Always find that unsalted butter (or sweet butter) gives a much better flavor and does not burn as quickly

I used to make this recipe all the time when I still ate meat. Now that I'm a vegetarian, I still eat this but with mock-chicken instead. It's a delicious and quick recipe that has impressed every single person I know who tried it!

This recipe is so delicious and everyone I've served it to raves; I always double the sauce and it is just right.   Yum Yum.  Ya gotta try this one.  A super easy, elegant company meal, too.  It is also an "Adkins diet" low carb recipe, that is until you add the sauteeing in flour as some have done.

At first I didnt understand. Ive never made something with high ratings that went so bad.  I read over the other reviews and I see a lot of people have not made this recipe as is. People have made their changes and then rated the recipe 4-5 stars, so I really think this 5 star rating is way off.  Way too strong of a mustard taste for me.  I tried again with less mustard and garlic and served it over chicken stuffed with prosciutto and smoked gouda.  It went better with it but I still dont think its that great.  Wont be making it again.

This was delicious, quick, and easy! I will definetly be making this again.  May opt for the light cream to save on calories next time.  UPDATED - 2nd time making this - made some changes and it was FABULOUS!!! After I removed chicken from the pan I sauteed about a half an onion, a can of artichoke hearts and 2-3 cloves of garlic, then added the LIGHT cream, mustard, and tarragon.  Also added 3/4 chicken broth to extend the sauce without adding calories. Thickened it with flour. Served it with white rice and a salad. It was DELICIOUS!!

So this is one of those annoying reviews where it is a 5 star rating because of my changes. However, I would feel like a fraud if I claimed this recipe as my own given many of the similarities to this one!

I first covered the chicken with dijon mustard and let sit for an hour.

I then sauteed one onion and three minced garlic cloves in oil and butter. 

I lightly floured the chicken and browned on each side for 5 minutes per side.

I deglazed the pan with 1/2 cup white wine and let reduce.  I added a 1/4 cup of chicken broth, covered and simmered for 20 minutes.

I combined the cream with the mustard and tarragon, removed thre chicken from the pan and kept warm.  I added the mustard mix to the browned bits in the pan to create the sauce.  I returned the chicken to the pan.

Outstanding!  I literally ran my finger across the pan and liked more sauce before washing the pan!

Whenever I first try a recipe, I change it to suit my own tastes. That's what a recipe is... a guide. And like Linda says, I was also brought up never to waste food, so what would be the point of preparing something if you know you're not going to like it as much without a little extra this or that? So, DELTAQUEEN50, this was a great start. I added a couple cloves of garlic, a shallot,  chives, a bit of fresh basil, about a quarter cup of Pinot Grigio and used just a squirt of honey dijon mustard. The barest hint of parm at the end, and served with a salad, oven roasted potatoes and fresh,  crusty Italian bread. My husband really enjoyed this last night, and I thank you!

Priceless! I used chicken tenderloins. Followed others by flouring them. Also sauteed an onion and mushrooms. Doubled cream as the others did and used a spicy mustard. Also used dried tarragon. I've made this recipe 3 times and used different wines each time to deglaze the pan. Fast and delicious meal in under 30 minutes. We love it!

This recipe is divine! I did make several adjustments though, but regardless the recipe is great. I actually did this with 2 halibut fillets instead of 4 chicken breasts. I used only 1 T of smart balance olive oil spread. I kept the proportions for the sauce the same. I deglazed with about 1/4 C of white wine and added 2 gloves of garlic, minced. Once the wine had reduced I added the cream (I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2) and tarragon. Then followed the rest of the recipe as described. I served with "Fast and Easy Spinach with Shallots" from A/R and a butternut squash puree. I was in heaven, soooo good!

I really like how this recipe turned out.  I followed it exactly.  Hubby isn't a huge mustard fan but he said that this was ok - hence the 4 star rating.  I think this is definately something I will continue to make for myself when hubby isn't home.  Thanks for the post.

Absolutely wonderful.  Don't change a thing! Why on earth go to all the extra trouble with flouring, marinating, etc. when just following the recipe is a gourmet meal.  I was short on the cream and topped it up with milk. Also discovered my fresh tarragon was thoroughly dried so rubbed the leaves in my hands to crumble and it was amazing. Thank you Deltaqueen50. It was and is wonderful!

Definitely add dijon to the chicken; let it marinate for a few hours. Didn't bother with coating the chicken in flour as I was cooking this in my Dutch oven. I also added 0.5 cup of white wine to my Dutch oven, let it reduce, then added the cream/mustard/tarragon mixture, then the chicken, and let it cook for an hour at 325. OH...I also cut the chicken into strips. Very, very good. Got rave reviews.

Add a little grated onion and pressed garlic to the sauce, and definately double the sauce...great on buttered noodles or rice.

i went between trying to figure out whether to rate this a 3 or 4. it had an "interesting" taste but that's most likely due to personal preference.
i added garlic and onion powder to the chicken as well and then also floured it like others suggested. i added onions and mushrooms to the sauce too and  doubled the sauce (which is a good idea, there wasn't even much left with doing that).
i've noticed a couple of people have said they've used dried tarragon (as did i) and they just add more..which is a little confusing because if you are substituting dried for fresh you are supposed to use *less*. i can't imagine using more than what's called for but then again, i wasn't the biggest fan of the tarragon flavor. we went back and forth from liking this dish to thinking it was just ok. i think that next time i will add a different herb and then it will be really good.

I just made this for a 10-person dinner party and it was a HUGE HIT! The sauce was luscious (I used dried Tarragon, as I could not find fresh, and it worked fine), and it was so easy to make. I will certainly make this recipe again. Thank you so much!

Great recipe!  I followed others' suggestions and coated the chicken in dijon mustard a few hours before cooking, and then dipped in flour immediately before putting in the pan.  I also used half & half instead of cream as I didn't have cream on hand.  It was still delicious!  I served it with red potatoes (chopped into cubes, coated in salt, pepper, dijon mustard, and a little mayo and baked until done), and the sauce was great on the potatoes too!  I will be making this again.  Thanks!

yum.  I had trouble finding enough fresh tarragon, so I used what little I had plus I added in some dried basil.  I think you coulld substitute fresh basil or cilantro and have good results.  I can find those herbs easier.  I will try that in the future.  I did double the sauce and had way more than enough.  I might make some more chicken because the sauce is so good that I don't want to waste it.    I used a splash of white wine to deglaze the pan.  The flavor of the sauce did not really come out until I added enough salt....so don't try and skimp on the salt.

I used to have a similar recipe that came with the fresh tarragon I bought (printed on the package), but lost it.  It's easy to make without a recipe, once you've done it a couple times - still, I was delighted to see this!  One difference I recall is that chicken stock was used to simmer the chicken (covered) and then add the mustard and cream.  I think adding this step would stretch the sauce (I never had to make more than the recipe called for) and manage the fat level without sacrificing flavor at all.  I can't imagine anyone not loving this recipe, unless you dislike tarragon.  The recipe is foolproof otherwise!

Very easy and very good.  I used margarine instead of olive oil and the butter when sauteing the chicken.  That's the only change and probably didn't effect anything.  I wish I had made more sauce though and will do so next time.  My boyfriend wanted more on his angel hair pasta.  Otherwise a very enjoyable dish.

I prepared this pretty much as directed, except I did what previous reviewers suggested and substituted 2% evaporated milk for the cream, and doubled the sauce. I thought it turned out great.

Also, I refrigerated the leftovers and the next day, I cut up the chicken, added some mayo, onion, celery, dried cranberries, and a little extra tarragon and it made a phenomenal chicken salad.

This was so delicious! The chicken came out very moist. Per the suggestion of previous reviewers, I coated the pieces with seasoned flour before sauteeing it. Also, I used McCormick Garlic Herb seasoning on the breasts while they were cooking. The cream sauce was exquisite. I added chopped green onions to it and it came out perfect. Thank you for a great recipe!

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I made this with several changes suggested  from other reviewers.  Never had tarragon before and it smelled like licorice so just to be sure everyone liked it I used half the amount( I will add more next time).  I dredged the chicken in seasoned flour and then browned.  Then sauted chopped onions and sliced mushrooms, then made the sauce.  I did make extra sauce as suggested and I'm glad I did.  My husband and 10 year old son loved it.  I will definitely be making this again.

Delicious!  Doubled the sauce recipe, using both whole-grain and regular dijon mustard and 1 teaspoon of dried tarragon.  Yummy results for something that is so quick and easy to prepare!  Served it with jasmine rice and picky eaters (husband and teenage daughter) cleaned their plates.

Excellent!  I used it on pork chops instead of chicken and found I was out of tarragon so I used marjoram and a little mint.  This is so good with these substitutions that I can't wait to make it with the proper herbs on chicken!  The sauce is also great with pork.

Great recipe. How nice that this doesn't call for a can of cream soup like so many on this site. I use a different mustard, as we don't like Dijon, but it still turns out great. Also, I only use olive oil and not butter as I only cook with olive oil. A person can tailor this to their personal preference by using another herb or combination, adding white wine, using all butter. That's the great thing about cooking. It's versatile to your tastes.

This is an excellent recipe.  I think my girlfriends requests it almost every week.  I use half and half instead of heavy cream to cut back on the fat a little and it really does not seem to make that big of a difference in the flavor or texture.  I would definitely recomend doubling the sauce, because it is amazing.

Very nice. My version used thin chicken cutlets, dredged in seasoned flour.  When the chicken was cooked thru, I prepared a triple serving of the sauce by first tossing in a medium chopped shallot and two pressed garlic cloves into the pan. When I could smell the garlic, I added 1/2 C white wine to deglaze.  The wine cooked until it began to thicken just a bit.  At that point I added the cream, mustard, some salt an pepper, and let it thicken up.  Just before the final thickness was reached I added the tarragon.  Nice.

I'm going to go out on a limb here and disagree with this 5 star rating, I'm sorry.  This tasted so odd that after dinner I went back and studied the recipe to make sure I didn't get any of the amounts wrong.  I made it as directed, aside from using less tarragon, because I used dried instead of fresh. (Couldn't find it fresh, and paid almost $5 for a small jar of dried) Anyway, my daughter said it tasted like the sauce from potato salad, and frankly I agreed with her.  Until the middle of eating it and then I realized it tasted exactly like deviled eggs.  We all got a laugh out of that comparison, but truly, that's what it tasted like.  I couldn't eat the rest.  My hubby said it was good, though it did taste like deviled eggs.  Sorry, don't plan to ever make this again.  One of the weirdest tasting dishes I've ever made.

This is a super simple, yummy recipe!  I used Fat Free half and half instead of heavy cream to reduce calories.  It was still great.  If you use the fat free stuff, keep the heat low so you don't cause it to seperate.

Our new favorite creamy chicken recipe. I make this at least twice a month. Couple of changes I make: Flour the chicken before browning. Add sauteed mushrooms and onions to sauce. Make at least double the sauce and serve with noodles. YUMMY!

This is the first recipe we've tried off this site and now we're hooked.  This is some of the best chicked we have ever had!  I customized the recipe for three and after we were finished I wished I had done it for more so we could have had leftovers.  One tip I do have is double up the sauce.  I made asparagus with holandaise and mint rice pilaf to go with it and my husband said the sauce would have been really good on the asparagus...Rachel

This was great!  Kind of tastes like a Bernaise sauce.  Very easy however we are a mushroom family so I added about 10 sliced mushrooms to the chicken while it was browning and it really tasted great - not too much mushroom flavor.  Also trippled the amount of cream, mustard and tarragon since we like alot of sauce over the chicken and rice!  Will definetly make again.  My kids even ate it up!

If you cut the chicken into 1 inch cubes it speeds up the cooking time. Also after I took the chicken out of the pan I sauted mushrooms and garlic in the same pan until tender before adding half & half and mustard.  I used dried tarragon and it came out awesome. A perfect dijion sauce!

I'm always looking for new ways to use tarragon because it takes over my herb garden.  I love this recipe, but be careful with this herb.  It is very sweet and can overpower a recipe, so resist the impulse to throw a bit more in just because you have it.  (I hope I don't have to say to use only fresh, and only French tarragon).  The mustard balances the tarragon beautifully.  Next time I'll change the proportions and use just a bit more of it.  There is almost never a reason to use heavy cream in any recipe.  Light cream will do.  And sour cream would be equally as good.  Definitely double the sauce.  I try to watch my weight, but it's hard with this one, especially when served over my favorite wide egg noodles.  I want seconds and thirds and keep sneaking just another spoonful of the sauce before refrigerating leftovers.  Leftovers??

My boyfriend and I loved this! We both had second helpings (albeit small ones), and he took the last of it to work the next day for lunch. I didn't use the tarragon because I sincerely hate the taste of licorice and was afraid that it would ruin the dish for me, but I think this recipe would work well with whatever herbs you happen to have around. I had a whole chicken on hand, which I cut up and skinned, removing the backbone from the thighs and breasts. I dredged the seasoned chicken pieces in flour prior to browning them, sauteed some garlic and onions in the drippings from the chicken and then deglazed the pan with 1/2 cup of white wine. I also added 1/2 cup of chicken stock, doubled the cream (but left the amount of mustard the same), used herbs de provence instead of the tarragon, and added a bay leaf. I added the chicken back with the sauce and let everything slowly simmer together to thicken. Served it over soft polenta, and it was incredible.

Tarragon is an herb that not everybody likes, so when I doubled the sauce, I did not double the amount of tarragon (I used 1/2 tsp of dried tarragon, because I didn't have fresh). I coated the chicken breasts with a flour & bread crumbs mixture for frying, and deglazed the frying pan with a little white wine before adding the cream to the pan. Instead of heavy cream ("Whipping Cream" in Canada), I used Half-and-Half ("Coffee Cream" in Canada), to cut down on the dairy fat, and found this worked fine. I liked this recipe, but am only giving it 4 stars because two others in my family, more picky than me, only gave it an "it was okay" approval rating.

Good recipe. I doubled the sauce, could even have been tripled. I used half and half instead. I did not have tarragon on hand so I used italian seasonings and red pepper flakes.

My husband and I just LOVE this recipe. It's so simple to make and the taste is unbelieveable! This is something that I make when we have company due to the simplicity of the recipe but also because it comes out looking and tasting like something I slaved over for hours! 5 big, bright shining stars for this one!

Superb. I marinated my chicken in a little Itallian dressing and white wine prior to preparing. Err on the low end of the cooking time. Even though it's chicken and you want to be careful, the chicken will cook more while it is setting on the side and will become tought and chewy if it's over done.

Well, I changed up a recipe to suit my family's tastes because I swapped out the tarragon for chives. I don't know about anyone else, but I was brought up to never waste food which is why I opted for an herb that all four of us would like. Oh yes, and I also took other reviewers advice and added some garlic and a splash of wine. "Deltaqueen", this dish was so very good, not to mention, company worthy and easy too! Thanks so much for a true palate pleaser!

Gourmet dinner quick and easy. A hit with my family.  Served with steamed brocolli with lemon pepper. I doubled the sauce to have more dip!

very good! I used fat free half and half to cut out some of the fat. I also added mushrooms while cooking the chicken. Next time I will use a little more mustard because I couldn't taste it much. Great recipe! Thanks

This was great!  I followed other people's suggestions and rubbed the chicken with dijon mustard and a splash of lemon juice and let it marinate for an hour or so.  Melted a half stick of butter and some olive oil and sauteed some fresh garlic and minced onion (just the spice), then covered the chicken pieces with seasoned flour (w/pepper and seasoned salt) and added the chicken to the skillet with the butter/olive oil/garlic/minced onion and browned on both sides.  I then added just about half a cup of chicken broth and covered the skillet and let the chicken cook for about 15 minutes.  I removed the chicken and set aside, added about 1/4 cup of Chardonnay, 2 TBS of dijon mustard and 2 TBS of tarragon (I too only had the dry spice), and a cup of half-n-half, simmer and stirred until thickened and added the chicken back into the skillet with the sauce.  It was AMAZING and made a ton of sauce!  (Note: I think it would have been just as wonderful skipping the flour step - all that seemed to do was make the sauce a little thicker because it really didn't stick to my chicken pieces.)  Thank you for a great recipe and thank all of you for your comments and suggestions!

Easy and delicious! I used 2% milk to make it lower fat and it was still delicious. I would probably double the sauce if using 2% milk again because it did cook down quite a bit.

This was really good.  It reminded me of the chicken my Mother use to make.  I didn't have any tarragon so I subbed it with Thyme.  Used half and half instead of heavy cream and added about a 1/4 cup of chicken stock for more flavor.  My fiance asked me to add it to the save list for the future which really surprised me as he doesn't usually ask me to repeat a recipe without asking me to add chillies to it next time.. LOL... It must be a winner

My husband, who usually doesn't like mustard sauces, absolutely loved this!  I had to substitute dried tarragon for the fresh, and I really don't think it made that much of a difference.  It's a little heavy in the fats values, but is a wonderful treat every once in awhile.

This was delicious!! I took some suggestions and sauted mushrooms, onion, and garlic before mixing the sauce; we also doubled the sauce and used 1 tsp dried tarragon (crushed) in place of the fresh.  Served over mashed potatoes and with a side of fresh steamed broccoli - yum!!  I think next time I will use fat free half-and-half in place of the cream to cut out some fat and calories.

I coated the chicken in seasoned flour and used oregano instead of tarragon because I couldn't find it. I know it totally changes the flavor of the dish and I will make again with tarragon eventually. Good!

I followed the advice of a few other reviewers by adding garlic and onions and deglazing the pan.  I also used FF evaporated milk in place of the cream doubling the sauce and served over egg noodles... FANTASTIC and oh so simple!

As a consensus of 4 (including myself), we felt this recipe should get about 4 stars out of 5 stars.  This was my first time making this recipe.  For mustard lovers, this would be a hit.  For semi-mustard lovers, caution on the measurements of mustard used.  

For Dijon mustard, I used Trader Joe’s Dijon Mustard brand and lacked fresh tarragon leaves so I converted to about 1/3rd of a teaspoon of dry tarragon herbs to be equal to 2 teaspoons of fresh tarragon leaves.  I may have converted the measurements incorrectly because I could not taste any hints of tarragon.  
I also accidentally omitted the olive oil.  As a result, everyone liked it but did not love it.  I felt that it was too mustardy in taste, but the creaminess was just right.  I used Great Value brand’s heavy whipping cream.  The end result was a creamy mustard sauce over chicken.  To us, it was nothing special, but satisfying.  I served it with creamed spinach and corn bread (I would have preferred rice pilaf, but someone insisted corn bread).  The pairing was nice because the spinach was creamy and provided a salty taste and the cornbread was slightly sweet so there was a variety of tastes there.

This is one of the best dishes I have ever had.  It has become a once-a-week dinner in our family - we can't get tired of it.  The sauce is just so amazing..I always make extra so we can pour it over the rice and veggies.  Yum!

Out of this world.  I made it exactly as written, except using half and half instead of heavy cream and only three chicken breasts; the chicken was moist and delicious, the sauce was perfect.  I used a really robust dijon, which I'd absolutely reccommend.  My sauce only needed to reduce for a minute or two before thickening.  The part that really amazes me is how easy this recipe is!  Really fabulous, thank you so much.

I've made this several times, exactly as written, and it's delicious! I might try adding shallots or garlic sometime, like others have done, but I think the sauce is delicious as is. UPDATE: I will say, though, that the sauce is so delicious, I usually want more of it. So I've taken to doubling it and I use light cream to try and cut down on the fat. As far as I can tell, it hasn't affected the flavor or creaminess at all. I've also tried it with garlic, shallots, and a bit of white wine to deglaze the  pan (as mentioned in other reviews), and I'm not convinced it added that much, so I'll probably stick with just the regular cream/dijon/tarragon sauce.

This is a 5 star recipe but with changes.  Like several other reviews I dredged the chicken in flour. Deglazed pan with white wine, added chopped shallot and crushed garlic.  It was delicious, simple, quick and you couldn't get better in a restaurant.

I made Emrils version , his uses wine. But I made quite a few substitions because I used what was on hand. It was delicious.  I used sake instead of white wine, basil , sage and spike (a combination spice ) and half and half instead of heavy cream. also mixed olive oil and buter.....it was fabulous !

Did what other reviews said with onions and mushrooms... didn't use wine. Used Fresh tarragon! WOW! YUMMY! I also, split the chicken breast in half - to make them thin... left mustard on them for 4 hours before dinner... then coated in seasoned flour (season salt and garlic powder). Ready in less then 30 min... Served with mash and mixed veggies. YUMMO!!!!!!!

I was hesitant about this dish because of the dijon mustard. Neither my boyfriend or I are big mustard fans except for honey mustard. I used a very grainy-looking dijon mustard and it had a very strong smell when first added into the pan but the taste was excellent! I was very suprised. I did use half & half instead of cream and doubled the amount of tarragon. One of my new favorite chicken dishes!

When ever I first try a recipe, I do it just the way it's listed.  Then, if I feel it needs changing, I will make changes the second time around, but my reviews are always based on the original recipe.  I'm amazed how many people totally change a recipe, then make comments on it.  They should rename it, and submit it to All Recipes.
With that said, I loved this recipe.  Quick and easy, with just the right amount of flavor from the mustard and tarraon.  The only change I might make, would be to add more tarragon, but just the way it is was delightful.  Another keeper.  I will try it out on my very picky grand daughter the next time she visits.  That's the true test!

I guess I have to join the minority on this one, because I thought the sauce was really bad.   Althoug this was a quick and simple meal to prepare, this recipe will not find its way into my recipe box.

We just did not like this...must be a matter of personal taste.  I used a name brand dijon mustard and used a dried tarragon ($4 for the bottle - yikes!)and used only 1 tsp, but the flavor of the sauce was odd.  Sorry to disagree with what is so obviously a winner to others.  But - that is what is so nice about this site!  We all get a say in our ratings.  Thanks anyways.

This was a good, simple recipe, that I would give 4 and 1/2 stars. The tarragon and dijon defintely give it a bit of a "French" taste. I doubled the cream and mustard, as well as used about a third more tarragon than called for. Without this, I don't think there really would have been a good amount of sauce for each peice of chicken. This was a moist, fast chicken dish which I will certainly make again!

Pretty good recipe. The sauce was very mustard-ey even with the cream, and it didn't really cook into the chicken so it left the inner meat kind of bland. But I cooked some asparagus with the dish and put that into the pan to simmer a bit with the chicken and sauce and that was the best part of the meal. The sauce tasted really really good on the asparagus.

Excellent!! Tastes very authentic. I would suggest pounding the chicken breasts beforehand for more surface area and doubling the sauce.

Very flavorable for such a quick dinner. I used the prescribed sauce mixture for 2 ckn breasts instead of 4 and doubled the tarragon b/c I used dried instead of fresh.

After pulling up this recipe to make 'again', I realized I had never reviewed it...  shame on me.  This recipe has gone through various transitions thru the years, but still never fails to impress me.  Though it tastes wonderful as written it is also the perfect recipe for customizing to your family's individual likes and dislikes.  I lightly saute the chicken with a dusting of flour, salt, white pepper, garlic and onion powder  and remove when done, then in the same pan, saute 3 cloves of minced garlic, 1/2 cup minced shallots, and package of Bella baby mushrooms to give the sauce a more earthy taste.  When the mushrooms have cooked down, add your tarragon, 1.5 tbsp mustard and the cream back to the pot and let simmer for 5 minutes to thicken; make sure to scrap up the fabulous drippings in the pan, as they really help flavor it.  Add the chicken back to the pan, coat with sauce and serve.  Wonderful Deltaqueen50, simply wonderful!  Thank you for sharing.

Absolutely delicious! Before stirring in the cream, I deglazed the pan with a bit of white wine (about ? cup), boiling it until it became a glaze, then added the cream, mustard and tarragon. Served with Basmati rice + quinoa. YUM!!!

all 3 of us really liked this one. Changes were minor: dredged in flour before browning, added a little garlic powder, and after baking browned it for 30 min in the oven because the veggie dish I was cooking needed to be baked at 350 x 30 min.....came out at the same time that way.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I gave this one to my daughter. Her husband has a wheat allergy, so this works perfect.  I grow French Tarragon in my garden.  Use fresh Tarragon only, dried- in jar is not the same.  This recipe is GREAT,... just double the sauce.

Quick, easy and delicious. This dish comes out seeming like a lot more effort goes into it than actually does.  I did marinate the chicken in dijon and coat with flour first. This recipe is a keeper and one I will make again for sure.

I was not sure if I would like this recipe or not.  First of all, the Dijon mustard seemed strange paired with heavy cream, and the tarragon smelled funny to me, but after I plated it up and added some sauteed mushrooms, I ate every single bite!  It was delicious!  I will make this one again and again, and I loved the French flavor!  Made me feel like a French Chef!

My boyfriend and I just made this (I'd made it once before) and we had to make a triple batch (mom's day). We customized it a bit - took other's advice on the mushrooms, onions ... but - BEST addition was artichoke hearts!! We added the ones in water (not marinated), and went ahead and added the water too ... gave extra liquid and flavor. Loved it! Make sure to add some good sea salt and plenty of cracked pepper. Also - we browned the chicken after coating in flour, but did not cook all the way through. We let it all get happy together with the sauce as the chicken finishes cooking. Big pot required.  Will definitely make it again.  YUMMY!

Oh.my.gosh. I've made this before, and we loved it! I had some fish (tilapia) on hand tonight, and was wondering what to do with it. I rememberd this sauce, and thought I'd give it a try. It was awesome! I wouldn't change a thing, except to maybe make more sauce if you plan on serving it over a grain. Thanks for sharing!

It was very good, I took the suggestion of deglazing the pan with white wine, and followed the rest of the recipe exactly, although my boyfriend and I felt it was a little bland...I think next time I'd saute some garlic and onions with it.  I will make again though, great base and very simple.

We really enjoyed this.  I had 6 breasts so I used the full pint (?) of heavy cream and tripled the fresh tarragon and used honey dijon mustard.  Next time I will probably dredge the breasts in flour first but even without they were quite tender.  Served with buttered egg noodles and roasted asparagus which was great with a little of the sauce spooned over top!

I couldnt give 5 stars, because too much was modified.  As suggested by others, I rubbed the chicken with Herbs de Provence, salt and pepper, and coated with ~3 tblsp honey mustard.  After a couple hours of marinading, i applied a lite coat of flour and browned on medium high heat, followed by ~15 mins covered at medium-low heat.  I then deglazed the pan with a slightly sweet white wine, added 1 tsp crushed garlic, and 1.5 cups of mushrooms. After ~5 mins sautee, i added the tarragon and heavy cream.  Will definitely make again!

So, how bad can heavy cream, mustard and tarragon be!  Super.  I sliced the chicken for a more fancy presentation then poured the "gravy" over it with mashed potatoes.   Great recipe -  thanks!

You have to try this with dry vermouth to deglaze the pan.  I also dredged in seasoned flour as others mentioned - but the vermouth makes it!

this looks like a great recipe with mini sodium and maxi flavor.  If tarragon is not available, well substitute another herb, and change the name. good work

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I made it for my boyfriend and he loved it as well. The second day when I heated up the left over chicken I didn't have enough sauce so I made a quick batch with a little more mustard this time and it was even better. I think next time I make it I may add some capers. A great recipe as is, but also gives you a lot of room to customize it.

This is a really good recipe, but I only gave it 4 stars because of all the editing I had to do to suit it for my tastes.  I did like most people, I coated it in seasoned flour.  After, I deglazed with some white wine, and added some shallots and garlic.  Then I add the cream, mustard and tarragon.  I really like this with some plain white rice.

This was soooo good. I think I'm in love!  I breaded the breasts in seasoned flour and added garlic and onion and a bit of white wine to the sauce.  Served it with mashed potatoes and a salad.  I will definately be making it again.  Might add mushrooms like some of the reviewers.

very good! I made it like other reviewers by flouring chicken first and using carmelized onions and mushrooms. Tripled sauce. Very rich but it tones down over rice.

Wow!  I've been growing tarragon for the past couple of years, but this is the first time I've (finally!) cooked with it.  Delicious.  No additions needed.  Served with a side of pasta - there isn't much sauce, but enough to lightly coat 3-4c of pasta for 4 servings total.

This recipe is nothing short of amazing! I have made it over and over and the only change is to (at least) double the sauce ingredients because I serve it over mashed potatoes and it is SO delicious! The chicken slow cooked with the olive oil and butter creates a delicious stock that adds to the flavor of the sauce.

Fantastic fantastic. One of the only ways I'll eat asparagus is with the sauce from this chicken drizzled all over it.. I'll even make the sauce just to put on asparagus. Very french tasting.

This was so good we made another batch right away.  I added some fresh garlic and white wine while cooking the chicken.  I realized after I'd started that I did not have any tarragon but I kept going and substituted in fresh thyme, dried marjoram and dill.  I'm looking forward to trying it with tarragon, but it was fabulous anyway.  Served with grilled onions and zucchini and buttered new potatoes.

This was absolutely terrific -- and fast!  I have another recipe from a book for a dijon-tarragon cream sauce, but it's far more complicated.  This went together in a snap and it was wonderful :)  
I have to admit that like many of us, I was out of heavy cream and had to substitute half-and-half instead.  While it wasn't as thick as a full-cream sauce would be, it was still terrific.  I strongly suspect that this same sauce would be equally good over salmon.  Since that's on the menu later this week....I'll let you know how it turns out.  But thank you for sharing -- this was definitely something we'll do again ;D

I've made this dish twice now and love it.  The first time I made it exactly as the recipe stated. It was very tasty and didn't seem too mustardy to me at all. The second time I decided to experiment.  I wanted to cut back on some of the fat, so instead of heavy cream I used 2% evaporated milk.  I wasn't sure how this was going to turn out, but it actually turned out great! I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts, as I really don't care for white meat. My fiancee is normally pretty against anything in which I use a lowfat version of ingredients but he said this is probably the best thing I've ever cooked.  I will make it with low fat evaporated milk from now on, since we both loved it and it's a bit healthier this way.

This recipe is excellent.  Like one of the people below, I made the following changes.  I rubbed the chicken with some mustard and let it hang out in the fridge for awhile.  Then floured the chicken and fried it on the stove and then set it aside.  Then I deglazed the pan with a little wine and cooked some garlic, onions and mushrooms until they were almost done.  I added the cream, mustard and tarragon and cooked that for five minutes before pouring the mixtured over the chicken and serving.  Everyone thought it was excellent.  I will definately make this again.

After noting MANY suggestions from other reviews I agree this is a VERY GOOD recipe.  I totally agree that More Sauce is a MUST, as well as using FRESH tarragon.  I marinated the chicken with White wine and Lemon Juice.  Flour and seasoning before browning was a good suggestion, as well as adding garlic and onion to the sauce for alittle more depth in taste.  I served this over rice, but will try pasta next time, as the rice acted like a "sponge" and soaked-up the sauce too much.  
Over-all my family liked it alot, and whould be open to having it again.  I would make ALOT more sauce. I did double the recipe for sauce this time and it still wasn't enough for my guys.

I tried this by dredging the chicken in flour, but didn't think it necessary or particularly desireable. The big difference maker to me was using fresh terragon. I, also, sauted mushroom, garlic and onions in the pan with a little dry Marsala before adding the cream. Delicious!

Fancy dish, I kept expecting there to be more steps...this was totally too easy.  From previous reviews I coated chicken with flour and seasoning prior to frying.  Added 1 small onion finely chopped, and a clove a minced garlic while frying chicken (in extra butter i might add).  NOW, I have NO clue what "tarragon" was or tasted like...but as I was using my herb mincer...it smelled like anise.  Personally I WOULD NOT add anything that smelled like this to anything I cook, but I DID-and it was quite tasty.  I tripled the cream, but not the mustard or tarragon.  And because of my fussy 7 year old son, I just threw the sauce into a gravy boat (I didn't want to ruin perfectly good chicken)...go figure...my son even liked it (I gave to him as dipping sauce). Using a gravy server allowed us to control the amount of sauce on our rice too.  This is very rich however, and would NO WAY be able to eat another helping, even though it was terrific.  Will definately make again, and maybe try different herbs, maybe even a little parmesean cheese melted in...it had a "alfredo-y" base taste to it.

We loved this recipe.  I doubled the amount of Dijon mustard because it seemed bland. I used Herbes de Provence as I didn't have taragon. I also added milk to the cream to make more sauce.  Will make again for sure.

Well, I wouldn't go so far as to say that "you'll think a french chef came to your house" but it is a good quick substitute for an hour's work for a real french recipe. My 7 year old wasn't thrilled, but I definately enjoyed it enough to make again. Maybe she'll come around!

I liked it but I didn't "love" it.  My husband thought it was good but not really our thing.  If you are into cream sauces, you'll probably like this.  But something about it just seemed to heavy to us.  The onions are a must.  They really added a lot to the recipe.

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would!  This was simply amazing.  I didn't have tarragon but used a bit of herbs d'province.  I also followed reviewers suggestions to put dijon directly on the chicken and let them sit and deglazed my pan with about 1/4 cup white wine.  This tasted like I had gone to a fine French restaurant and I've dined in Paris at fine French restaurants before.  It was without a doubt, the best recipe I've used from this site.  I will make this again!!!!

Easy and delicious! I served it over pasta initially worrying it might be weird (I just had to use up this fresh pasta), and actually it was delicious! I paired it with a carrot dill soup and a pinot grigio.

My husband gave this dish 10/10 and my son wanted to know when I would make it again. I followed the recipe to a 't' and as I don't need the extra calories of adding flour or wine as some others have suggested. Thanks

Fast, easy and absolutely delicious! This would be a great company dish -- easy preparation but a sophisticated flavor.  We followed the recipe as written, but substituted dried tarragon (a little more than 1/2 teaspoon) for the fresh tarragon.

make this a monthly dish. But I do have a few suggestions to really pull this dish together. 
First, I coat my chicken with salt pepper and dried tarragon.  
Second, once you brown the chicken on both sides I remove the it from pan and deglaze it with white cooking wine. (just a few tablespoons) once the pan loosens all those pieces of chicken I then add the few tablespoons (I double the recipes sauce) of the dijon mustard and a full c. heavy cream and then add the chicken back in with about a tbs more of tarragon. I leave uncovered and cook down a bit to the consistency we like.

My family raved about the gourmet dinner I provided tonight with this recipe! Based on other reviewers recommendations, I coated the chicken in a dijon/white wine mix and then dredged in seasoned flour. I deglazed the pan with white wine and put in 1/4 chopped onion with it. I also tripled the sauce and used half & half instead of heavy cream. Terrific! Will make again! 

p.s. I did not have any fresh taragon so I used 1 tsp of dried.

My husband is a professional Chef, so it's rare that I manage to make things that blow him away. This did, AND got him to eat his veggies (which he doesn't like..!) My picky kids liked it too! 

I tweaked it and made a "marinade" of Dijon, Mayo, and Targon let it sit for a couple hours in that…then coated it with Panko Bread crumbs before putting in the buttered skillet.  

It was a fantastic meal paired with Broccoli and Roast potatoes…

Great recipe, even got my little sister to like tarragon!  I would say, as others have, to add more sauce.  For mine I did 2/3 cup heavy cream and then 1/3 cup milk, just because I was really looking for something too too thick. Obviously doubled the mustard and tarragon portions too.  I found that halving the chicken was also useful in absorbing the sauce. Overall great dish, definitely trying it again!

This was great.  I followed the recipe but used a bit more cream for more sauce.  Served it over rice with some green beans.  I had dinner on the table fast and it was a hit with my husband and my 3 year old.

Excellent, simple meal. I coated the chicken lightly in flour before browning it. I also added some chicken stock to the cream to extend the sauce. I served it with a rice pilaf.

Excellent! Coated the breasts with flour and sauted a tablespoon of chopped garlic after browning the chicken. Used half & half instead of heavy cream and dried tarragon instead of fresh because thats what I had on hand and I couldnt wait to try this. Can't say enough good things about it!!

I cut the chicken breasts into cubes so they cook faster. I only had dry tarragon in hand and I didn't have enough for the sauce to have the flavour stand out and the dijon was overpowering the rest. Next time I will marinate it in dark soy sauce so the chicken will have some colour. I found the dish to be too pale =P But I will make this dish again

My husband and I loved this chicken.  I didn't have fresh tarragon so I used a tsp. of dried but it was still delicious.  We are eating the leftovers for lunch.  This us definitely a recipe I will used again and again.

So delicious! When I started I thought as I always do, increase the sauce.  I used a half cup of half and half and a cup of chicken broth and a teaspoon and a half of dried tarragon and reduced the sauce to a fare thee well.  I'm stingy with the stars but I'm giving this all five. A wonderful recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

F I V E ***** S T A R S  - easy, delicious recipe.  I followed the directions except to add a little chopped onion to the sauce.  I also did not have fresh tarragon, I used dried leaves (1/2 the amt.) and it was great.  The taste is addicting.  We used the extra sauce to drizzle over our potatoes.  Very nice dinner.  Thanks for such a good recipe.  You make me look like a great cook.

Simple and yet flavorful. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out amazing. I have since modified it by de-glazing the pan with w. wine before making the sauce. Have also used dried tarragon in a pinch, but fresh is always better. In the future, I feel as though I may continue to modify it (per others suggestions), but as is is quick and easy with little prep.

I followed this recipe exactly and loved the end result! Chicken was moist, flavorful, and the sauce was the perfect touch to dress up pan fried chicken a little. Dijon mustard was a nice touch; in the future I might not even buy fresh tarragon from the store to simplify matters.

Wow!  Soo much flavor!  Even my friend's 2 and 5 year old kids liked it.  Fresh tarragon is a must and I know I will plant it in my herb garden just for this recipe.  It's a keeper!

Also added shallots to the cream sauce (which I doubled) but other than that followed the recipe... Delicious!  I love cooking with tarragon, so this recipe was a great idea for something different to do with chicken breasts... will definitely make again!

I was looking to use the tarragon growing in my garden and someone was nice enough to recommend this to me.  I brushed the chicken with dijon and then dipped the chicken in flour seasoned with garlic and onion powder, paprika and salt.  I also used 1/2 and 1/2 because that is what I had on hand and it was fine--now I don't know why one would waste the calories/fat on heavy cream.  My husband loved this.   It is fancy enough for company and easy enough for a week night meal.  I served it with roasted asparagus and baked potatoes.

OMG! This was a party in my mouth! This was definitely one of the best flavored dishes I've found on this site. We served over white rice, but I think it will work well over egg noodles or greens, too. I recommend doubling or tripling the sauce, however. There simply was not enough. I rarely give 5 stars and this truly deserves one.

Great week day night recipe.  The only change I would make is to pound the chicken breasts to 1/2" thick before cooking so that they cook quicker.  Chicken breasts can get tough when cooked too long.

This recipe is very good! I was pleasantly surprised with the sauce and it goes very well with mashed potatoes. My 2 1/2 year old devoured this dish as well as the rest of my family. I did make some changes ~ based on my family's preferences. I dredged the chicken in seasoned flour, used canned condensed milk (as I discovered my cream had expired), sauted a handfull of chopped shallots and baby bella mushrooms, and sprinkled the finished dish with fresh snipped parsley. The end result is definately company worthy! I will be making this again for sure!

This was sooooo good! Melt in your mouth moist. We didn't have fresh tarragon at the store so I went with the dry seasoning. Still great!

I used some of the other reviews and grilled the chicken (our preference) and used herbes de provence instead of tarragon (because that's what I had) and I used fat free evaporated milk in place of the cream and it was just fabulous.  The chicken was so juicy and cooked perfectly.  Hubby said this one needed to be a regular.  That's a big vote.  Served with brown rice and sauteed veggies.

I cooked this for my girlfriend the first time I made her dinner and she loved it. She had me make it again when her mother came into town and again a huge success. I took some tips from some other reviews. This is a new all time favorite.

Very creamy. The dijon mustard really makes this dish stand out. I had never used tarragon before and it smells a little like black licorice which was a bit concerning to me as I am not a fan of black licorice, but not to worry, it tastes delicious!

Wow, this was excellent, except I did not use tarragon. My fiance said it is now his favorite pasta. I never had tarragon before, so after buying it, I smelled it. Unexpected, it smelled like black liquorish, and surprise - it tasted like it, too. I hate black liquorish, so I threw in fresh thyme instead. I tripled the sauce, plus I added 1 1/2 chopped onions and 8 oz fresh sliced mushrooms. I added a big splash of white wine after taking the chicken out to saute the veggies in. I put in 2 cups of heavy cream (instead of 1 1/2) because I wasn't paying attention, but it was perfect! As far as the chicken (used 3 chicken breast halves), I rubbed it with a bit of dijon and marinaded for an hour. Then I sprinkled both sides with salt and pepper and coated with flour. I set it back in the fridge until I was ready to cook this. I served this over 8 oz of linguini. My fiance and I ate it all up!

This was absolutely delicious.  I did make a couple subs -- I used the other suggestions and tossed the chicken (I used chicken tender -- cooked in less time) with the mustard and a little flour and pepper.  I was very surprised how easy and how good this was!

This was a great recipe. I followed other reviewer's advice and covered it with seasoned flour. I also added onions and fresh garlic, and it was fabulous. Served it with fresh sourdough bread and mashed potatoes. My husband was raving!

This was delicious! I doubled the amount of sauce, and used light cream and that worked just fine. I also used fresh rosemary, since we have it growing in our garden. Served it with buttered noodles and cooked broccoli. Very nice dish. UPDATE: I have now made this with heavy (whipping) cream and the result is much better!! The sauce doesn't break or curdle when you use the heavy cream as it does with the light cream. The taste is more intense and my hubby couldn't stop raving about the sauce!! I won't make this often because it is fattening, but when I do I will always use the heavy cream from now on. YUM!

This recipe is great and easy too.  I often will pound the chicken into cutlets for this recipe and sometimes use dried tarragon when fresh is not handy - but either way it's great and my husband and son like it a lot - and they are very picky.

Oh my God, This was delicious. Tarragon is my favorite herb. I didn't have fresh on hand but the dried Tarragon worked just fine. I pounded my breasts as I always do so they would be nice and tender. I also added a can of mushrooms. Great idea of the other reviewer. This is definitely a company dish. My husband raved and that is saying alot for him. He's picky!! Thankyou.

This is a really easy recipe, so I'd give it 5 stars just for that.  I added mushrooms to mine, but other then that followed the recipe exactly as written.  I thought it was good, but the sauce wasn't my favorite.

Absolutely delicious. I followed the readers' recommendations about dipping the chicken in flour, using a little bit of white wine to deglaze the pan, adding some garlic and mushrooms... and didn't regret it. I will make this recipe again.

This was very tasty.  I took other reviewer's suggestions and dipped the chicken in a flour/seasoning salt/onion powder mixture before cooking.  I didn't have any tarragon, so I just sprinkled in some herb de provence.  It was quite tasty.  Next time I will triple the sauce and serve with rice pilaf.  Thanks for a good recipe!

I didn't make this exactly as indicated, but it was delicious anyways.  Per other suggestions, I added a bit of white wine to deglaze the pan, let that reduce a bit, then added garlic and onion to the pan and let that cook before adding the cream.  I also used dried tarragon (about half as much) because I didn't have fresh.  It smelled wonderful and tasted just as good.  I made mashed potatoes to go with it and the sauce, when mixed in with the potatoes, much improved my run-of-the-mill mashed taters!  Thanks so much!

served this up to the family - son-in-law asked for the recipe.  i added spring onions and garlic after glazing pan with white wine.  also used chick thighs instead of breast as i find they are more moist and cheaper.  used full fat cream but would possibly use low fat cream next time just to reduce richness.  a hit in this extended household.

Phenominal.  My husband and I both like to cook.  We followed some of the mods suggested by others and added one or two of our own.  Cut the chicken breasts into strips (or use tenderloin strips).  Dredge in flout seasoned with your favorite spices (we used Mrs. Dash, poultry seasoning, thyme, celery salt, and pepper).  Doubled the cream to 1 cup and used 1 1/2T of dijon and 1 teaspoon of dried tarragon (since I couldn't find the fresh version at the market).

We served with rice and a vegetable.  I may try adding some caramelized onions next time to see if adds to it.  But it's great as made above.  Can't wait to try it out on our friends.

Scrumptious!  I added seasoned flour to the chicken before I sauteed it...put it aside and added mushrooms, garlic, and a minced shallot to the pan and sauteed with a little white wine until mushrooms were soft...then I added the cream, dijon, and fresh tarragon to cook the reamining few minutes.  I doubled the amount of cream and dijon so I could use some of the sauce for the asparagas I served with it.  This is a really easy recipe, and tastes like you spent hours making it.  Thanks!

I loved this recipe.  It was easy and included very common ingredients.  I used dried terragon (where the heck does one find fresh terragon anyway?!  I would love to cook with it.)  and terragon dijon mustard (that was the only dijon i had in my fridge.  A welcome coincidence.)  It was delicious.  My husband said he would rather have bbq sauce on it instead but he has no taste so that doesn't say much.  I would definitely feed this to guests, it is tasty and easy.

Very good! Moist chicken, flavorful sauce, and easy to make! Basically did as others suggested: instead of marinating in mustard, I just spread dijon on one side of the chicken before dredging in flour and browning. Remove chicken, add the white wine about 1/4 c, then add chopped onion and sliced mushrooms, cream and tarragon. I just put the chicken back in pan for a little while longer and it was perfect!  Thank you so much! Oh yeah...definitely double the sauce!

Very easy to make.  I used half and half and doubled the sauce, as per other's suggestions.  I served it over angel hair pasta.  It was a big hit with my husband!  I would definitely recommend using fresh tarragon.  Yum!

So good! Very rich, "fancy" dinner that will impress! I sauteed mushrooms with the onions & used dried tarragon (all I had on hand) turned out delicious. Will use fresh next time and try adding the white wine as per other reviewers.

This turned out superb! I did follow the reviewers' suggestions and marinated the chicken in mustard. I did add finely chopped garlic, salt, pepper and sliced green chilies to the marinade as well (my family love spicy stuff!). And then shallots to the cream sauce. Was really good! Will make it again for sure, but not all that often as I feel its a little high on the fat-o-meter :)

This is a very good recipe!  The tarragon - Dijon mustard combination is a winner.  I will add more heavy cream to create more of creamy dish.

This was de-lish!! We've started eating a lot more chicken, so it's nice to have several different recipes. This one is a keeper! We loved it. I doubled the sauce and served over penne pasta. On the side, I had Garlic Broccoli Spears, from this site. YUM!! Thank you!

This was sooo good and sooo easy. The only reason that it's not rated five stars is one of my kids didn't like it. I used chicken tenders and my tarragon was fresh but wilted and brown. The dish was still fantastic even with my old tarragon.

So goooooood. I loved it. Be careful not to add too much mustard. I added too much and could have done with out the strong mustard taste. This meal went great with broccoli.

Excellent, very simple and tasty recipe.  I sliced the chicken breasts into pieces to reduce cooking time.  I also dredged the chicken in seasoned flour before browning.  Swapped out heavy cream for 1/2 and 1/2.  This reduced overall calories but still thickened beautifully

I selected this recipe on my first visit to this website.  Wonderful!  My husband loved it even though he doesn't like anything out of the ordinary.  Strictly meat & potatoes.  I know I'll be serving this again.

So easy, quick and gently flavored with tarragon. Perfect company meal and easy enough for after a hard days work.  Every one raves every time I make this.

Really good. I substituted parsley for tarragon since I couldn't find any in my local grocery store. But it worked out just fine

A simple dish to prepare, but it looks and tastes like you've spent a lot of time. The sauce was delicious especially with the fresh tarragon. I will serve this aain and again.

My family & guests loved this. I went easy on the Dijon and that was a mistake. Everyone would have liked more of the mustard taste. I plan to make this again to serve to guests over the Labor Day weekend and will aim for more flavor. Definitely a recipe I will keep and adjust over time to suit our tastes.

Wonderfully easy recipe and, with the changes suggested - very tasty.  We followed suggestions to add onion, garlic, mushrooms and to switch the tarragon for herbes de provence.  Also, dredging in flour was a good idea too.

Fabulous. This will be a wonderful dish to serve to guests.  BUT - as per other reviewers you need to increase the sauce.  I doubled the recipe for only (2) breast halves and it was just perfect. For 4 halves I would make the sauce X4.

Absolutely loved this dish!!  I doubled the sauce mixture but added half milk and half cream.  After looking at reviews, i decided to add half an onion and fresh mushroom (1 cup) to pan.
Thanks for sharing it with us.

Everyone loved this even my kids! I made extra sauce (using half & half instead of cream) and substituted herbes de Provence for the tarragon. I followed other suggestions and deglazed with white wine and added sliced fresh mushrooms (baby bella). I had to use a little more butter than the recipe called for. Will definitely make this again.

Very good. Worked just fine with dried tarragon (just add a little more). Sauce thickened nicely, would not have minded a little more to spoon over veggies on the side. This is really a 4-1/2 star recipe, maybe even 4-3/4.

My husband enjoyed this and said he'd have it again.  I wasn't as big a fan of this recipe though.  I used the recommendations of flouring the chickens and adding sauted onions to the sauce.  I didn't have any heavy cream and used milk instead...seemed to turn out fine though.

I can't believe how easy this is!! I couldn't find tarragon ANYWHERE and ended up using dried rosemary and marjoram. Still got great reviews from my family. Will definitely work this into my rotation.

This was an easy recipe to prepare.  I also floured the chicken prior to browning.  The sauce was very good.  I doubled the sauce portion of this recipe, and used it over the steamed asparagus that I served with it.  My boyfriend was a fan of this as well.  Yummy!!

This is a wonderfull dish. Tastes gourmet. It's definitely better with fresh tarragon, but when I don't have it on hand, dried herb works for a quick dinner. Both my husband and I loved it and now I make it regularly. Thank you!

Whoops I forgot to take a picture of the completed meal, so there’s the empty plates!  We loved it!  Like the top review, I deglazed the pan with white wine and added garlic, mushrooms, red pepper and onion!  Served with mashed potatoes and there are no leftovers!

My boyfriend sent this to me for us to make. I must admit i read the ingredients and instructions quickly. I didn’t read the reviews until i was making it. I didn’t change anything. I probably added more tarragon because I didn’t measure it, same with the cream.  This recipe is fantastic, as written. We will be making this often. Loved how easy yet elegant it is. We served it with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. It was amazing.

Sauce was good but like previous reviews needed so many changes it wasn't the same recipe.  Chicken turns to rubber if you cover the pan and needs wine coating etc

I did enjoy this recipe although my wife and I felt it needed a little "pop".The mustard just didn't add enough, or perhaps it needed more of the mustard. The sauce was nice and light and worked well on a whole wheat pasta that I served it with.I will give it another go but will increase the coarse ground mustard and see how that works. This is a great recipe though and easy as well.

This is a keeper that I will make again many times. It is so easy and quick to make, and the flavor is delicious. I wanted to make this according to the recipe, only I would use dry tarragon instead of fresh because I believed I had it on hand. I did not. So, instead of two teaspoons of fresh tarragon I used two pinches of oregano, basil, dill weed, marjoram and rosemary (the Internet-recommended replacement for tarragon) and it was wonderful. Next time I will use either fresh or dried tarragon. What a simple, wonderful recipe.

I was looking for a good tarragon recipe and am glad I came across this one.  I used fresh tarragon from my garden and this recipe highlighted it perfectly.  The only change I made was to add 2T diced onion (because I had some leftover from another recipe and wanted to use it up) and sauteed it in the butter/oil before adding the chicken.  Lovely, light, and refreshing Spring flavor.

Made according to the recipe, this dish is very good, easy to prepare, elegant, and lends itself easily to modifications. I plan to make it again but will decrease the Dijon (a little strong for my taste) and follow suggestions other reviewers have made which will enhance the recipe.  As others have stated, it makes enough sauce for the chicken so needs to be increased if you want extra.

I’ve made this recipe quite a few times.  My family loves it and it is so quick and easy. I’ve followed the instructions exactly and it comes out great, and I’ve also modified it and left out the tarragon but added honey to make it a honey mustard flavor sauce. I’ve also substituted almond milk for cream and it also works really well. Very versatile recipe!

This sauce is lovely. I sliced the chicken but didn’t coat it in the sauce. The chicken went on top of buttered bow tie pasta with the sauce drizzled on top. The only change I would make is adding some chicken stock to make the sauce a bit thinner so it would be easier to mix into pasta. Definitely will make this again!

Such an easy yet elegant way to serve chicken.  I just deglazed the pan with brandy before adding the cream and it turned out excellent.  This is perfect for a weeknight meal because it's so easy but it's elegant enough to serve to company.  Thank you!

I made this tonight and followed the recipe. I used two very large chicken breasts from Kroger’s butcher counter. I cut each breast into two pieces and then butterflied each of the four pieces, which now gave me 8 good size pieces. I pounded any thick uneven areas to allow them to cook evenly. I cooked the chicken in two batches of four filets each, then I made the sauce. It was very delicious! The tarragon immediately imparted flavor into the cream sauce, but was not overpowering. This dish is an easy, yet elegantly flavored dish for either everyday or when you have guests over for dinner.

I am giving this 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe as written. I took other reviewers advice and spread the mustard on the chicken a few hours before dredging in flour, then proceeding with the recipe. I thought it turned out great but my teens weren't crazy about the tarragon spice.

This is an amazing recipe. Simple and delicious. I have made it many times, first sticking with the original recipe but have added mushrooms and other things as it is a good base for adaption. In the end, the basic recipe is the best. I have tried with and without onion/garlic as others have suggested but think it can overpower the delicate flavor of the tarragon. One thing I will recommend is plating it with fresh arugula under the chicken, then adding the sauce. The peppery taste goes well with the other flavors. Finally, I always double the sauce because its so good. I have used the leftover sauce as a pasta sauce and its wonderful as well. That is, if there are any leftovers!

Excellent with some of the changes others recommended: 1. marinade the chicken before hand if possible 2. coat chicken in seasoned flour  3. Deglaze the pan with a little white wine before adding cream  4. If you hate tarragon, use thyme instead.

I will make this again! Great base recipe due to it's versitality, that is why I gave this recipe a 5 star rating. I always tweak recipes to suit my family's palate. I seasoned flour with salt and pepper, garlic powder, cayenne and summer savory. Lightly floured the chicken and cooked in the olive oil/butter combo. I took the chicken out and sauteed garlic and onions before adding the heavy cream. It was a little thick to my liking so I added chicken broth to thin it out. Once I added the tarragon and dijon, I let it simmer to meld the flavors before returning the chicken and spooning the  sauce on top. My picky 10 yr old son ate seconds!

I made this last night and it was a big hit with my husband who, a lot of the time, is like trying to feed a picky 3 year old!  I did not make any changes except maybe on the salt (I'm not sure because I just salted to taste and did not measure).  This recipe is definitely going to be a frequent meal around here!  Thank you for the recipe!

This is an excellent, easy, simple recipe - great for a weeknight dinner and elegant enough for entertaining guests.  I have been using this recipe for years.  It's great as written but I've made two minor changes.  One because I'm lazy and the second because I prefer the sauce a little thicker.  First, I bake the chicken separately with a little oil, salt and pepper and covered with foil to keep it moist.  Then I put the sauce together and add the chicken when it's cooked. To make the sauce, I use 1 T. butter, 1 T. flour, 1. T. Dijon mustard, 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup half and half or heavy cream. Once it's together, I add the fresh tarragon (a sprig or two that I remove when serving). I add the chicken and  simmer it all on very low heat while I cook egg noodles (about 10 minutes).   My husband loves it. It's a winner.

I love tarragon. Dipped pounded chicken in seasoned flour, added a tbsp. flour to thicken sauce. Added garlic and wine to deglaze. Will add more tarragon next time now that I know hubby loves it too.

I was so excited to have a change in our recipe routine by making this Dijon-Tarragon chicken recipe.  I was so very disappointed and let down....it was dominated by the mustard and the remaining flavors were bland and left behind.  In an attempt to give it new life, I added additional cream and tarragon to no avail.  This recipe is NOT a winner in my book.

I did not make any changes. It was delicious as is and will make it again. I did use as a sauce for salmon but used dill instead of tarragon.  It was a big hit!

Omg was this amazing! I used thighs instead of breasts because I do a keto diet. I also doubled the sauce to have extra to pour over some sautéed veggies. And I didn't have fresh tarragon so I used herbs from Provence like another reviewer. I always make my husband rate my dinners on a scale of 1-10 so I know if I should make it again. This was the first 11 I have ever received from him and I am a pretty good cook!

Chicken, mustard, and tarragon are each very mead-friendly ingredients.  All three married in one recipe makes mead by far the best drink to pair with this recipe.  Forget the white wine -- boring.  Pair this instead with an oaked traditional mead (traditional = mead made only from honey). Choose a dry to semisweet mead. Almost every meadery makes one.  There are meaderies in 47 states, and vinoshipper.com ships to almost every state!

The only change I made was to use Evaporated milk because I had no heavy cream on hand.  Yum!  Now it may be even better with the heavy cream, but my husband (and I) loved this sauce very much.

I decided to give it a try.  Loved it!  So did my room-mate. Took up some of the suggestions of the other allrecipes.com members to enhance the meal:  it worked! Instead of the garlic that some suggested, I used shallots and a dry white wine. Perfect for a mid-week dinner!!!

OMG SO YUM was this sce that i scraped the dish!!! Only thing i changed was not using tarragon. I dont use tarragon and I didnt want to buy it just for this recipe. Instead I used dry parsley and i did put more cream  (to my taste). I like "creamy" sauces. Still Delicious - this sce is killer and will def impress as long as your audience likes dijon and cream. This is a KEEPER!

I loved this recipe.  I followed it as close as I could since I only cook for myself so I had to cut the recipe down.  It's very hard to cook for one.  But I thought it was a great recipe.  I'm always looking for different ways to cook chicken.  This is a keeper.  I have some leftover so I think I'll have it with some brown and long grain rice tomorrow.  I notice a lot of people on here change the recipe by adding different ingredients.  Then it is a different recipe.

I took the advice of several reviews and floured the chicken, added LOTS of garlic and shallots, deglazed the pan with white wine. It was delicious!! Will make again!!

This was very good but I had to make several changes. I did not want to put a lot of cream in the sauce, so I used low fat Greek Yogart and chicken stock to increase the amount of sauce. I am making this for our Sunday School Care Group dinner this Saturday and plan on making extra sauce.

Very easy and fast! I did not have tarragon but used thyme instead and it was perfect! Other than that, I did not modify anything and the recipe came out perfect!

Did a basic seasoned flour dredge to improve crispness of the chicken and doubled the cream sauce. Turned out excellent.

Actually made this with a nice thick slice of breast off a rotisserie chicken. Was super easy and fast, but the sauce made it restaurant quality. I live alone and could easily make this for one (or more). Excellent!

Loved this recipe!  I did make some changes, per the reviews I read.  I think the additions were absolutely perfect.  I doubled the cream amount but not the dijon.  I did coat the chicken with the dijon and dredged in flour before cooking.  Good call!  I added 1/2 C white wine, mushrooms, tarragon and a pinch of herbs de provence.  I served it with fettuccine, steamed broccoli, and sprinkled Romano cheese on top.  The family loved it.

My husband and i really enjoyed this! I made a few changes based on other reviews.  I dipped the chicken in flour prior to browning it and once the chicken was browned, I added a clove of garlic to the pan.  The sauce had a delicious flavor!  The fresh tarragon makes it!

Another big hit, and super easy!

I took some advice from other reviewers and made a couple of easy changes. First off, I lightly coated my chicken with flower. Also I deglazed the pan with a couple glugs of dry white wine, then added and sauteed about a table spoon of minced garlic and a jar of sliced mushrooms before continuing with cream sauce. Also, I doubled the cream sauce recipe because, well... I like sauce.  We both LOVED it and I'll be making it again soon!

My tarragon plant died, so I used a scant tsp of dried tarragon instead of fresh, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Very easy and tasty. Goes great with a Rose Chinon wine (made from cabernet Franc grapes).

It ain't really healthy but it's good.
I used non dairy cream and used canola oil instead of the butter (didn't have any). 
It tasted like honey mustard sauce. Real good

Very good. I used whipping cream instead of heavy cream. No other  changes made.  When I'm not feeling lazy I will pound out the breasts prior to cooking. That allows me to feed more people using less meat. Very easy recipe.

This recipe is very good, although I did make a few changes. I pounded the chicken to 1/2 inch thickness before I fried it, as it makes it a whole lot more juicy! (If you don't over cook the chicken!) The other thing I did was use double the cream (1 cup). I do this so when I serve this with mashed potatoes, I can use the extra cream as a gravy for the potatoes. Otherwise and excellent tasting recipe!

Wow, this turned out amazing!  I love tarragon, so I doubled the amount.  Also when I seasoned the chicken, I added a blend of Italian seasonings.  I can't wait to do this dish again!

I make this all the time. My kids and teens love it. I make it without tarragon and using half and half sometimes as well if I'm not in the mood to go to the store for fresh tarragon. As written 5 stars. Without tarragon 4 stars.

I didn't have any fresh Tarragon but read that I could sub it with dry Fennel seed which I have plenty of. So I used a pinch of it and am thoroughly enjoying the meal as I write this.

We followed the recipe as it is reads. My husband made it, and we will be making it again. It is delicious and easy. We had scalloped potatoes, green beans and ciabatta rolls with it. YUMMY!

Wonderful!!! I made a lot of changes based on other reviews:

- Pounded the chicken thin
- Lightly breaded the chicken in flour, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder
- Doubled the sauce, including the tarragon, and added 1/2c of white wine

I made this for our dinner tonight, cutting the recipe in half but following the recipe with the exception of using dried tarragon in place of fresh.  It is delicious, and it will be added to our rotation.  I think that if you were making rice, especially sticky rice (calrose), you may want to make more of the sauce to pour over the rice, too.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  I can't believe it took me so long to make this!

OMG Good!  Hub kept saying YUM!

I made this for 2. Following a tip under another review I deglazed the pan with white wine, also coated the chicken with dijon and let it sit for an hour or so, coated with organic coconut flour.  Had this with long grained brown basmati rice with sundried tomatoes, green onion and red pepper mixed in. Sort of a pilaf. I'd like to make this again with extra gravy and mashed potatoes.

This recipe was great. It was light and tasty, I love the simplicity. When I cook a first time recipe a follow instructions with no modification but I just had to add garlic and lemon to it. That is because I think that all food need garlic and onion for flavor. Next time, of course I will add more ingredients.

OMG!  This is freakin' awesome and so simple!  I loved it.  I only had regular whipping cream but I am certain that did not detract at all from the deliciousness!  I can't wait to have this again with maybe some sauted shallots, garlic, and mushrooms!  Mmmmm!  I am certain that will be excellent too!

Easy and delicious.  The sauce was a perfect blend of the tarragon and mustard - enough to taste each and not too much to overpower any of the other flavors.
The only thing I'd change is the quantity of sauce - double everything and you will have plenty to liberally coat 28 ounces of chicken breast which I cut into  filet size pieces.
A keeper for a quick,  weeknight dinner and suitable for company.

I made this and made a lot of changes.  Some based on the reviews and some just because I thought that they would work.  AND they did!!!  I used boneless and skinless chicken thighs.  I also added sour cream, I used the course ground Dijon mustard, 3 cloves of minced garlic and I also used 3 teaspoons of garam masala (1 teaspoon mixed in the flour along with salt and pepper, and 2 teaspoons added to the cream when adding the mustard and tarragon).  It was   DELICIOUS!!!  The garam masala made the dish.  It was sooooo incredibly good!  I made it for three people and they all gave it five stars!

beyond delicious! i wouldn't really change anything in this recipe. the only thing i would have to say is add more ingredients/spices to create your own unique take on the dish. what i did was add the seasonings while the fish (yes, i used tilapia) was frying. i used lemon pepper, a pinch of coriander and obviously some dried tarragon on both sides of the fillets. then for the sauce i added green peppers, mushrooms, onions, garlic, more tarragon, lemon pepper, coriander, and allspice. this was a BIG hit with the whole family. serve on top of rice.

Made tonight for husband and me. I took advice of others and made more cream sauce. I cut chicken breasts into large chunks so it cooked very quickly. Don't improvise with adding other substitutions. excellent as is and very simple to mske. This is now one of our favorite chicken recipes!

Omg amazing! I added more tarragon because I love it! Used a white wine reduction. Floured the chicken because of other post but I think it would be amazing without will try that next time. Definetly a keeper and would be a great meal for a dinner party!

I love tarragon and chicken, such a wonderful pairing.  The few things I did differently based on some of the reviews, I mixed up some dijon and chopped tarragon and lightly coated the chicken and then into seasoned flour. This made a nice crust on the chicken.  I also used white wine to deglaze the pan.  Extra sauce is good in this recipe to spoon over pasta.  I also added sauteed mushrooms.

This is an awesome recipe. The chicken was moist and the tarragon mustard sauce had an amazing flavor. Making it again for the 2nd time in less than a month and I wouldn't change a thing.

Stayed close to the recipe except I coated chicken with mustered, then floured them. After removing to warmer, deglazed pan with white wine. Tripled ingredients for gravy. Served with Risotto and fresh asparagus. Gravy went well with both.

great recipe, even when followed exactly. I could only find dried tarragon, but it worked fine. The only thing I'd do differently would be to lower the temperature when adding the cream- it reduced too far and wasn't quite a sauce, but was still delicious.

Delicious.
I modified the recipe slightly utilizing ingredients on hand ...  Spicy brown mustard instead of the Dijon, 1/2 & 1/2 and sour cream instead of heavy cream.

I really like this recipe, but made a couple adjustments. It wasn't mentioned but I tenderized the breast halves just a little. Like some of the reviewers have noted, I coated the chicken on both sides with flour before seasoning with salt and pepper. I also doubled the heavy cream, dijon mustard, and the tarragon. The original recipe didn't give us enough sauce! Otherwise, this is a good recipe, and I'll be making this for dinner pretty often!

So easy and delicious. I used one small carton of cream and maybe triple or more of the tarragon because...I love tarragon. It thickened really quickly. There was a lot of extra sauce left over since I used an entire carton of cream. I made it with roasted potatoes and broccoli rabe, and didn't care for the broccoli rabe (made it from frozen, so it was mushy and tasteless even with pepper, salt, red pepper flakes, and freshly grated parm) so I added the extra sauce to the broccoli rabe and it was delicious!

I thought that this chicken recipe was o.k.  It had a unique flavor probably due to the tarragon.  I've never had fresh tarragon before, but it was not an unpleasant taste just different.  I'll make this again and then make some adjustments for personal taste.

Tarragon was too..purfumic of an herb for me to enjoy. It was ok but that tarragon, it would be nice to wear like a perfume, just not to eat in my opinion.

My only issue with this dish is that there wasn't enough of the sauce!!!  My other half, who complains about having chicken once a week even loved this one.  I used some pretty thick chicken breasts, and they released a lot of juice into the pan.  I think that helped with some of the sauce issues that I saw in other reviews.  I may add more chicken stock after I remove the chicken breasts from the skillet so that I can double the sauce, but I would definitely recommend adding some stock or broth if there isn't a lot of juice in the pan.  I will definitely be making this over and over, it was delicious!

Absolutely the bomb! I made this the other night and can't WAIT to make it again, it was THAT GOOD. Someone said that they felt like a French chef afterward...I totally agree! I doubled the cream sauce based on one person's recommendation and I'm glad I did because it totally made this dish. Thank you, Deltaqueen50.

I have made this recipe twice.  I didn't change anything, but my Chicken was cooked before 15 minutes so check it early.  My whole family loves this recipe and it is very easy to prepare.  Thanks!

YUM!!  I admit I'm not actually rating the original recipe since I took the recommendations of many other reviewers.  That said, I coated the chicken with Dijon (tho didn't have time to let it "marinate"), then coated with seasoned flour.  After browning, I deglazed the pan with a bit of white wine, then sauteed 1/2 onion (I think I would use a little less next time) and 1 garlic clove. Once they were cooked I added the Dijon mustard, fresh tarragon and the cream (I used half and half and it thickened and tasted just fine).  I might double the sauce next time.  My husband couldn't stop saying "this is GOOD" over and over as he was eating.  My picky teenager loved it too.  Will definitely make again.

I used four thighs instead of four breasts, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. I'd eliminate the olive oil and just cook in butter next time, as it made the sauce a little oily. The flavor was pretty good, I'd make it again.

Taking in the Janicer8 suggestions,  I rubbed the Dijon mustard on the chicken and only let it sit for an hour then followed her changes.  it was a hit at home. Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious. I followed the other suggestions and sauteed some minced garlic and chopped red onions in the after removing the chicken, but I didn't dredge the chicken in flour nor deglaze with white wine. It turned out really tasty.

I really enjoyed this.  As per other reviewers, I pounded the chicken and dredged it in seasoned flour.  I also doubled the sauce, added shallots and a bit of salt and pepper.  Very tasty and uncomplicated!!

I really did enjoy this,   Did use  it, but would not.  I added 1/2 cup of extra dry vermoutth and 1/2 cuphicken broth .  Cooked down and then added the whipping cream and mustard.   Used a stone ground mustard added fresh tarragon very very good.

So easy to make but tastes like it took forever.  I've served this four times for dinner parties and it's always a hit.  The sauce is sooooo good.  Fresh tarragon is key as is a really good Dijon mustard.

Love this recipe for how simple (EASY) and yet elegant it is. I've made this twice-- once with parsley, once with tarragon-- and both turned out great.

Stunning dish, prepared exactly as described. Lived in Europe for several years and this reminds me of my time there. To alter this AND serve with Stove Top stuffing....I can't find the words. Lovely dish, Delta, thank you.

This is one of my favorite recipes! I pound the chicken breasts thin and season them with salt & pepper before frying. After frying the chicken, I use 1/2 cup Chardonnay to deglaze the pan. (Two-buck Chuck from Trader Joe's works well if you're not a wine drinker and just need an inexpensive bottle to cook with) Add the wine, scrape up the bits, and let it reduce for a few minutes before adding the cream. Also, I use 1.5 tsp of dried tarragon instead  fresh. I've never made it with fresh tarragon because I'm too cheap to buy fresh herbs knowing most of it will go to waste if the recipe I'm making only calls for a small amount.  :) I LOVE this recipe. It's so easy to make, yet tastes so gourmet!

It was really good, but I thought it would be more amazing.  Perhaps fresh tarragon is the key.  Company was impressed and it looked lovely.

Oh man, I can't wait to eat this for lunch tomorrow!  I haven't actually taken a bite of the chicken yet, but the sauce sure is yummy.  I doubled the cream and mustard and used a little more than a teaspoon of dried tarragon.  I also added some onion powder to my chicken breasts before cooking and a teaspoon of minced garlic to the sauce.  My fiance is going to be jealous!

Made this last night and everyone in the family LOVED it.  After reading the other reviews, I did change it up just a bit.  I added onions, garlic and mushrooms, a tablespoon of chicken "Better Than Boullion", and a splash of white wine to the sauce and I did also double the sauce.  I'm not a huge Tarragon fan, but it was key to this recipe. I served it over linguine with sauteed spinach on the side.  Will be making this one the next time I have company for dinner.  Very impressive and gourmet looking and tasting!

This is a good tasty dish and relatively simple to prepare as-is.  After reading other reviews I made some changes. I increased the liquid and added some low-sodium fat free chicken broth, I didn't think there would be enough sauce. Substituted fat free half and half for heavy cream. After removing the browned chicken breasts added white wine scraping up the brown bits, added sauteed sliced mushrooms. This was great. My husband dislikes licorice and wasn't sure how he felt about the tarragon, he was pleasantly surprised. We will definitely make this again

My hubby said that this is one of the best chicken dishes I have ever made for him.  He really liked it.  I did add purple onion and some fresh garlic to the pan first then removed when I cooked the chicken and added back when I was cooking the sauce with the chicken in it.  very good flavor

This was a hit for even the pickiest eaters in my house! I doubled the sauce and I did make a minor change with the ingredients. I didn't have any heavy cream so I used about 3/4 cup milk mixed with 1 heaping tablespoon corn starch, and 1/4 cup butter.   Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

Very good recipe! I tripled the sauce recipe to serve with mashed potatoes. Also added garlic and shallots to give it a little more flavor. Making it for a dinner party this Thursday and I can't wait!

This was a wonderful recipe. I listened to other reviews and floured my chicken. I used a small amount of wine, added some mushrooms and some cream cheese.  Thank you for the recipe and all the suggestions from other reviews....

According to reviews, I simmered garlic with the butter first, dipped the chicken in flour and I doubled the sauce.  This was awesome! I had just enough sauce to serve a little drizzle over penne pasta.  Great taste! Will make again and again!

This was so yummy!  I used a mixture of things from previous reviews that sounded good to me and it turned out good!  The only other thing that I might try next time is a little less mustard...it was pretty strong.  Overall very good and easy!!!

I am not a real fan of mustard but this looked good.  It was absolutely fabulous! Only thing I changed was that I sauteed onion and sliced mushrooms before I added the cream and mustard.

I doubled the recipe and quadrupled the sauce and thought that it had really good flavoring except it was a little too much dijon. Next time I am going to try half dijon and half honey mustard and see how it turns out! Still, a very yummy (and incredibly simple!) recipe that all of my guests enjoyed.

Wow!!!!  This is just as described....easy enough for a weeknight meal but plates up like a gourmet restaurant dish.  I made just as directed but only had dried taragon and it was delicious. I served with couscous (with a little of the sauce) and roasted peppers.  thanks for a great recipe.

Excellant taste, easy to prepare and readily available ingrediants. As others state, I doubled the sauce and servered with boiled new potatoes and steamed broccoli, both of which came fresh out of the garden just prior to dinner.  All around five stars from my family and I.

Hubby RAVED about this.  I would take the mustard down a notch (I did let the chicken marinate for several hours before cooking).  I added the onion, garlic, and mushrooms to the sauce and thought they were a very nice addition.  Thanks for a very good recipe!

This dish is amazing!!  30 minutes...1 skillet and it tastes like something you would get in a French restaurant.  I doubled the sauce.  I also added about 3 tbs of white wine before I added the cream.  I used 3 tsp tarragon and 1 tsp rosemary and that was wonderful.  I pounded my chicken &  it was sooo tender.  Served it all up on angel hair pasta and my family loved it.  Even my very picky teenage daughter said it was "nothing short of amazing"!!

Loved it!  Like most, I also made a few changes.  I marinated my chicken breast in buttermilk overnight and then butterflied them, which speeds up the cook time alot.  I deglazed the pan with a bit of dry white wine. And used anise seed in place of fresh tarragon.  Placed the chicken on top of quinoa and drizzled with sauce and fresh lemon juice. Delicious!

Very very good, though next time I make it I will make some small changes. I didn't have fresh tarragon this time so I used the dried I had on hand. It was good but I think the fresh will add a little extra layer of flavor. The other suggestions of using wine to deglaze, and a splash of lemon were a nice touches to lighten the heaviness of the cream sauce. I deff recommend this recipe and plan on making it again and again.

I cannot believe something so simple tastes so unbelievably delicious! This dish was absolutely wonderful, and we thought the sauce was so tasty that we can't wait to make it again and try it with salmon. So easy, but so fancy... a perfect supper for the family, but just as impressive for company. I followed the recipe to a T. Served it with fresh steamed asparagus. Next time I'll add something like couscous to the plate for a well-rounded meal. Anyway... the chicken is absolutely fantastic!

Onions, mushrooms (preferably Morel) and white whine make this dish a perfect lazy night dinner. Try sautéing the ingredients in truffle oil for a little extra complexity

This was a really good dish.  I read the previous reviews, and put mustard on the chicken, let it rest for awhile, then floured the chicken before cooking.  I also added the chicken broth and canned mushrooms.  This will definitely be a regular meal from now on.

This is such a tasty, quick, and inexpensive recipe! I absolutely love it. Does anyone have some side dishes they would recommend to pair this with? I'm a little new to cooking and quite put my thumb on what would be perfect with the chicken.

This was excellent. I had look at previous reviews prior to making this and they said to deglaze the pan with white wine and double the cream.  I think this is the only way to go.  It was much better like this and you get more of t he yummy sauce.

This was ok.  Made as is with flouring the chicken as suggested by other reviews.  I thought it was a bit plain and could have used some extra seasonings to give it more flavor.

This definitely has 5-star potential. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers (flour the chicken, add shallot, garlic, mushrooms and a shot of wine). It was very good...though still seems to be a little short on flavoring. Perhaps some garlic or onion salt and extra pepper? I will definitely keep making and tweaking...it has 5-star potential! Thanks for the submission!

The only thing I did differently was that I deglazed the pan with white wine. I served it with steamed brown rice & Broccoli. My family likes mustard - so the oly thing I will do differently next time is add more. I may also try it with split skin-on breasts ro retain a little more moisture in the chicken. But truely, this was simple & delicious!

pretty good and very easy.  My chicken was extremely thick, so next time I might pound flat just to have more sauce to chicken ratio.

This recipe works well with wild game such as duck, goose, and awesome as a sauce over slow cooked, then sliced elk and venision roasts.  I don't eat my wild game any other way.

I made this last night, the taste was good and the chicken was very moist.  However, my cream sauce split, im not sure what I did wrong, but it was very unappealing to the eye.  My BF ate it, but skipped on seconds.  I don't think I will try this again.

If I would've done this right it probably would've been a 5.  I read the recipe wrong and put in 2 tsp of dried tarragon instead of fresh.  The flavor was way overpowering!  Also, instead of cream, I used Silk brand unsweetened soy milk and I omitted the butter and used 2 T of olive oil.  I will definitely make it again but with the correct amount of tarragon!

Absolutely delicious! We all loved it, including my 12 yr old daughter, which says alot. I followed the recipe the first time. I'll play with some of the suggestions next time. I am fairly comfortable in the kitchen, but this was a nice confidence booster for me. yum yum

Yummmmm!!!  I'll admit, I changed a  bit.  I wanted more sauce to I tippled it (but used 1/2 and 1/2, not cream)  I coated the chicken as directed with the Dijon mustard, but added the extra Dijon drippings back in as it was cooking in the sauce.   I panned browned the chicken in seasoned flour first too.  I don't normally like breasts because they're too dry compared to dark meat.  I LOVED these!  They were SO moist and yummy!

One of the best chicken recipes I've every found.  Served it to guests last night, they loved it too.  Added a small amount of chopped garlic to the sauce.
Absolutely wonderful and EASY!

Very good recipe. I did incorporate the modifications suggested by most....deglazed with white wine and sauteed garlic and mushrooms before adding cream. I also used 10% blend instead of heavy cream and just thickened with a very small amount of cornstarch to cut a bit of the fat content.
I did find the tarragon a bit overpowering for my taste, and I tend to like a lot of flavour. Next time I will reduce the amount of tarragon a bit.

Loved it!  I took someone else's advice...I sauteed onions and garlic first and tripled my cream/taragon/dijon for a great gravy.  I served over egg noodles with the "gravy" and steamed broccoli.  My husband usually hates anything close to french food and he really liked it...my 3 and 5 year old liked it, too.  will definitely prepare again!

Very yummy! I used dried tarragon since my local supermarket was out and if you are planning on doing the same; I would only use 1tsp if that. I put in about 3tsp thinking I needed more to make up for the fact that it was dried. No need. It's really strong. Even so, it was one of the best dishes I've ever made! Definitely use the flour suggestions. Loved it!

I made this for my son and my girlfreind tonight, they loved it, my twenty-one year old is hard to please.  I only had anise, so I cut the amount in half for the substitution of the tarragon.  I made rice and actually doubled the recipe to pour over the rice and chicken.  I added a bit of cayenne pepper for a litle kick.  Ecellent!!

Loved the tartness that the mustard lends, and modified the liquid to 1/2 buttermilk, 1/2 2% milk for even more tartness!  Used add'l butter/olive oil to increase sauce yield and used about 1 T flour to ensure thickening.  Wasn't sure how buttermilk would "cook!"  When sauce was hot, added 1/2 c. shredded parmesan.  Served over bed of portabello ravioli and blanched green beans.  What a treat!

I made this with tilapia, and it was delicious and so simple. I subbed coconut oil for butter, and I followed the sauce recipe exactly, except instead of cream, I used almond milk thickened with cornstarch. It turned out perfectly creamy and so flavorful. A definite keeper!

Great recipe!  As suggested by others, I dredged the chicken in Wegman's pan searing flour (flour, white pepper, and sea salt in case you don't have a Wegmans nearby) and added 1/3 cup white wine, 1/2 chopped onion, 1 minced garlic clove, and 1/2 cup minced shittake mushrooms.  I sauteed the onion, garlic, and mushrooms then added to the cream once I scrapped the bottom of the pan. 

I didn't add the additional salt and pepper since the flour was seasoned with those ingredients.

I also doubled the sauce recipe as suggested (cream and tarragon only).  

With the suggestions above, this recipe is impressive.

Great recipe! Took very little time to make, and the results were wonderful. I used chopped dry tarragon instead of fresh, and the flavor was milder, but amazing!

A favorite in our house! I do coat the chicken in flour first and add garlic and onion as per the reviews.  My husband likes it so much, it's become a staple in our home.

One out of the four of us didn't care for this meal - my 12 yo daughter.  The rest of us really liked it.  I took the advice of one reviewer and dusted the chicken in flour before browning though, and wish I hadn't.  I'll make it again - perhaps with dried tarragon since I didn't like paying over $3 for 2 tsp of the stuff!  Also used half & half with great results.

Hmm.  My family absolutely loved this one and they couldn't get enough.  I wasn't as impressed.  I followed the directions exactly, except that I added garlic and onion, as well as deglazed the pan with white wine.  I made pleanty of extra sauce to use on green beans that I served as a side.  Since everyone else enjoyed it so much, I'd have to say this one will probably be made again.

Quick & easy, but very tasty.  Both my husband & I enjoyed this dish.  We'll make this one again, and are considering experimenting with other meats in place of the chicken.  We served it with a side of asparagus topped with the tarragon cream sauce as suggested by an earlier review.

This is one of our family's favorite recipe!  We love it!  We did not change anything but if I was cooking the recipe for more than 2 adults and 2 kids, I would definitely double the sauce (1 cup cream, 2 tablespoons dijon mustard and 2 teaspoons of dried tarragon) any guests will love the sauce.

OMG this was excellent!  Only change I made was to follow the advice of other raters, and double the sauce.  I used 1/2 pint of heavy cream, 2 Tablespoons of Dijon mustard, and about 2 tsp of tarragon.  The chicken itself was moist, and tender, and the sauce is made seperately and can be served on the side as necessary (for picky eaters like my two kids).  It was delicious!  My hubbie was mad that I only made 4 chicken breasts, because we wished we had leftovers.  This one is definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

This was easy and delicious! I didn't have tarragon on hand so I used dried thyme and rosemary.

We enjoyed this immensely.  Very easy to make.  Definitely need to double the sauce.  I served with wild rice pilaf and, if desired, spooned the extra sauce over it.  Would recommend it highly.

I liked this recipe. It was simple, relatively quick and tasty in a different way then the usual flavors we eat.  My husband is diabetic, so I made a few healthy changes--- Smart Balance instead of the butter, and low fat milk instead of the heavy cream.  I too doubled the sauce amount, added a squeeze of 1/4 of fresh lemon and a splash of white wine, along with a small red onion cut into strips cooked in the oil after removing the chicken but before adding the sauce, cooking until tender.  I did thicken the sauce a little with some corn starch. Even with the healthy changes, this dish came out very tasty, and even my young sons cleaned their plates and asked for more.  I will make this one again.  Thanks!

This was good, but I thought it would have more flavor.Very easy to make.Didn't have heavy cream so I used fat free half & half.(all that I had) Thickened it with a tiny bit of corn starch. Maybe the heavy cream gives it more flavor. Will try again.

This recipe is so easy and tastes like you have spent a lot of time.  I also doubled the sauce and prior to adding cream, sauteed mushrooms and gr onions scraping up the brown bits.  Then added the cream and dijon.  Delicious.  Will make again and again.

I followed the advice of others, and doubled the sauce, which is a must.  I also added mushrooms, and wished I would have added twice as many!  I couldn't find any fresh tarragon, but read that it has an anise flavor, so I used fennel instead.  It didn't really add anything, but it didn't take anything away, either.  Served the chicken over fettucini noodles, and it made an easy weeknight dinner.

Very good recipe with great results for a quick, last-minute meal.  I, too, marinated the chicken in the dijon mustard and spices (I substituted rosemary for the tarragon I didn't have on hand) and then dredged them in plain bread crumbs.  My husband and even kids really liked this.  And the best part for me, if you have chicken breasts, then all other ingrediants are probably already in your fridge/pantry.

I must have done something wrong because no one in my family, including me, enjoyed this at all.  I thought the sauce was very bland so I added more mustard, but even that didn't help.  We ate it, but all agreed it's not anything we would want again.

Very good, especially considering the prep time. Altered the recipe by pounding the breasts flat and adding about a teaspoon of lemon juice for added zing. Just wonderful.

This recipe was easy to make and tasted good. I will make it again, but with less dijon mustard; it overpowered the tarragon flavor.

I was suspicious that such a simple list of ingredients could turn out tasting so nice. Not fond of tarragon so I just substituted what was on hand (dill weed) and that was fine. A super quick entree - and a keeper.

My boyfriend and I had this for dinner this weekend. We did the suggestions of garlic and we used a shallot to add some flavor to the sauce. We doubled the sauce and I felt it could still probably could be extended some more. We both said it was good for an everyday dinner but would not go out of our way to make it. Just an okay recipe; I guess sounded better than tasted

I also added a clove of garlic and half an onion to give it more flavor, and still didn't like it.  I wished I'd used Honey Dijon instead of just plain Dijon, the Honey Dijon was calling to me saying it would taste better but in the end I decided to follow what the recipe said. I might try to make it once more, but next time I will cook the chicken in some organic chicken broth instead of oil & butter,and use more onion, maybe even add some other seasoning, I will add a can of peas to the sauce at the end and I will serve it over biscuits instead of w/ rice.  I'll update if I try it.

This chicken ROCKS! I breaded the chicken lightly with whole-wheat breadcrumbs before browning. Used the white wine to degaze, as suggested, which really gave an earthy flavor to the dish. A keeper, thanks!

My family, including my 3 year old, loved this. It was quick and easy. The chicken was juicy, and my husband loved the sauce so much that he poured it over everything he ate!
