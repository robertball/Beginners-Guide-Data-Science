This is a nice recipe for beef and mushroom pot roast, but why use a standing rib roast, which is much better roasted with dry heat.  An arm roast or chuck roast works well here and is a LOT less expensive

Great!  My husband raved about how tender the meat was.  I actually adjusted it a little bit...I used 2 1oz packages of onion soup mix and I used a little over a 3lb chuck roast...the butcher said that would result in a very tender roast.

I've used beer with beef roasts (Guinness Draught to be exact) and I've used onion soup mix too (Beefy Onion to be exact).  But I've never used the two together and I was a little uncertain about trying it - it turns out I needn't have been.  I used a rump roast - I made slits and inserted slivers of fresh garlic.   I used just the 8 ounce package of mushrooms I had on hand and that was plenty, tho' I did add several cippollini onions (a nice touch, by the way).  The beer taste disappears entirely and gives way to a rich, deep beefy broth. The roast itself is robustly flavored and fork tender.  Normally I'll dredge the roast in flour and then brown it in butter but, the truth be told, I was too lazy this time - but it didn't matter as the roast sure didn't seem to suffer for it! Awesome good - glad I tried it in spite of my skepticism.

I been cooking this recipe for decades! Super easy and tasty. Add sliced onions to the bottom of the slow cooker along with the mushrooms for another tasty addition. Strain the liquid from the vegis to a sauce pan, add some beef stock and thicken with a roux to make a nice gravy to accompany the dish. However; DO NOT use a standing rib roast for this recipe unless you are rich and WANT to waste your money and ruin a beautiful piece of meat! This recipe (or any recipe using a low and slow, moist heat cooking method) should always and ONLY use a cheaper cut like a chuck roast or similar tough cut of beef. A rib roast is already a tender cut and does not need or respond well to the long cooking times used in slow cooker recipes needed to break down connective tissue and render out fat. If you want to cook a rib roast use a DRY heat method. Otherwise enjoy!

Excellent roast!! I was a little weary using, but it taste great. Thanks for giving me another great recipe to add to my collection. (I used a 6 lb. roast and my family of 7 ate every single bite.) Thanks again

I added 5 cloves of garlic and half an onion cut into thin slices. Next time I'll definitely put more mushrooms in and cook it a little bit longer. Overall, the flavor was really good and the broth can make a really good gravy with a little flour and milk in a saucepan over medium heat.

Yum Yum yumm... I made just as written and must admit I had an urge to add a few more things, but it was great as is!  The house smelled so good it made my stomach growl and I had to eat a bowl of cereal to calm it down.  Extremely tasty and SO easy!  I made it for company and they loved it! garlic mashed potato was my side dish after reading other reviews.  I'll be making this again.

This was awesome. I've never cooked ribs before but found some one a great deal. Made this as the recipe said except we used Ginger Ale instead of beer simply because we don't have alcohol in our home.  My husband said it was one of his favorite beef recipes of all time. It was so tender and perfect. Will definitely make this again. Thanks!

Husband and I gave this 4 stars, but only because I made adjustments that didn't work. I don't normally buy packaged foods, so I made the onion soup mix (a recipe on another website)from scratch using beef bouillon granules, dried minced onion, garlic powder, and pepper. I used no salt in the total recipe, but the bouillon still made the pot roast too salty for our taste. Maybe this wouldnt have happened if I had used Lipton's. Otherwise, this was delicious with the mushrooms and beer. I used a bottle of Anchor Steam which gave it exceptional taste, and served with roasted red potatoes and fresh green beans. Yum.

Great flavor!  As a few other reviewers suggested, I chopped a medium onion and placed it in the bottom of the crock pot, then covered them with 2 cans of mushroom pieces.  Had a 3-lb bottom round roast which I cut in half and placed on top of the onions/mushrooms.  Followed rest of recipe by sprinkling with soup mix and 1 can of Miller Lite beer.  (I don't like beer, so was a little hesitant about that, but you couldn't taste it at all in the finished product.)  It was so tender it shredded easily.  I just scooped the onions/mushrooms out of the broth and mixed them in with the shredded beef, and we ate on French baguettes.  (Didn't bother to thicken the broth, as we just dipped the sandwiches in the broth.)  So yummy!  My husband loved it -- said he could eat it every day.  So versatile -- great on a sandwich, or could be a more hearty meal by thickening broth into gravy and serving with mashed potatoes!

Wonderful flavor. After cooking, I cut the roast into chunks, thicken the gravy, and mixed together.  Then I served over garlic mashed.  Would work great over egg noodles also.

I used a Sirloin Tip roast, and I added 4 cloves of garlic, half an onion, and Portebello mushrooms. For the Beer I used a La Trappe Quadrupel Trappist Ale. The roast turned out perfect! The gravy was simply amazing, rich and complex! 
I suggest using a Trappist, or Belgian Ale. These beers rival Red Wine in complexity! Trappists and Belgians have notes of figs, Dates, Plums, and other dried fruits.

If you do not have access to Trappists ales, then use any other beer that is rich in malts. Such as Stouts, Porters, and Brown ales. DO NOT USE an India Pale Ales, as they have high hop contents and will make your roast bitter. Also lighter beers will add virtually nothing to your gravy!

SO easy! I love that there's no prep at all: no chopping or browning or anything! You literally dump it all in and walk away! The first time we used Alaskan White and the second Sierra Nevada Glissade.   For alcohol-free homes, you are missing out! All of the alcohol is cooked out and the beer really tenderizes and adds flavor.  You can also add just about any veggies that take awhile to cook (carrots, onions) in the bottom. We prefer carrots because you can just throw them in whole.  We're all about no prep work!  =] We can throw this in the crock pot in under 5 minutes before heading to work.

As I generally have no time to spare in the morning, the night before I placed fresh sliced mushrooms and onion on the bottom of the slow cooker, added a chuck roast that I had inserted fresh garlic into small slits, used the dry onion soup mix as a rub, and put it in the frig. The next morning I took it out, added a bottle of ale, and let it cook on low all day. The smell that greeted me when I walked in the door made my mouth water! It was tender and juicy. I thickened the sauce for gravy, and served it with mashed potatoes and fresh green beans. A definite keeper.

I made subtle changes that apparently made a big difference because it came out perfect!  -2 packets of onion powder (instead of 1) -Poured beer over meat first so soup powder would adhere -Rubbed meat with soup packet -used Butt cut of meat and seared the fat side until brown so that it took on an appealing color and the remaining fat added flavor (place fat side up in slow-cooker) -In case you need a smaller portion, I used a 3lb roast and cooked it for 5 hrs on low  I got rave reviews from bf who does not eat %50 of the foods found on earth and my room-mate came downstairs to ask if she could try whatever smelled so amazing! :) Its an excellent (and cheap) Go-To meal.

Best roast I've ever had!! I replaced the onion soup mix with a medium onion finely diced(I did this because I try to avoid processed foods and powered mixes tend to have MSG and other preservatives/fillers). The beer with the mushroom and onion~YUM! The sauce made an excellent gravy cooked down with a little flour and milk. Will probably use this recipe many, many times in the future!

Wonderful! I added lots of onions and garlic too but did NOT use an expensive rib roast. Use a cheap chuck roast that is meant for braising. Use a beer as strongly flavored as you can get. Very good recipe but save that rib roast for the oven.

I’ve used red wine in lots of meals, sauce and beer for beer bread, etc., but not in roast. I thought I would give this a try thou I am not a beer drinker. I used almost a 2lb. rump roast and an 8 oz. package of fresh mushrooms for this recipe. It took almost 7 hours in the slow cooker. The aroma of the mushrooms and juices smelled so wonderful. The meat was tender and juicy. I always like mushrooms with roast beef so that was a nice addition. My initial plan was to use all the juices and make a thick gravy to pour over the meat. However, in this particular case the beer I used did not work out at all with this recipe. It tasted very bitter, unpleasant and inedible ruining the juices and taste of meat and mushrooms. I salvaged what I could of the meat and mushrooms and got rid of all the juices. Next time a recipe calls for beer I would prefer to use red wine or stock in its place. I wouldn’t want to completely dock points for not knowing whether or not it was the type of beer used. Overall the ingredients and cooking time did turn out well and it was easy to prepare everything. I served this with, “Swanson Ultimate Mashed Potatoes,” and “Olive Oil Roasted Eggplant with Lemon,” also from this website.

We don't really eat meat and wow was this a success. I added threee types of mushrooms and used an oatmeal stout and it was wonderful! The juices were super yummy on mashed potatoes. I really like it because there was such easy prep, very few ingredients. I actually bought sliced mushrooms and my butcher recommended chuck roast. Just finished the leftover and sad to see it go.

This is by far the most tender Chuck Roast I have ever made.
I used a 3.6lb boneless Chuck Roast.  I first browned both sides for 3-4 minutes. Then set out on a plate.  I then sauteed 3/4 of a large onion sliced thin, then added about 5 large cloves of chopped fresh garlic to the onion. Put that in the bottom of the crock.  Then sauteed two packages of sliced Portabello mushrooms and put that in the bottom of the crock.  Put the meat on top with Pepper to taste..  Put two packs of Lipton Beefey Onion soup mix on top of meat.  Put 1 fresh sprig of rosemary divided around and on top of meat with a large fresh spring of thyme around the meat. Pour beer a bit on top to dissolve boullion and poured the rest around the side.  Cooked on high 1 hour then turned to low for 7 more.  OMG AWESOME

Any one who would treat a nice standing rib roast this way should be eating hamburger.

This is abysmal. What a waste. Barbaric. A ruined rib roast and a ruined pot roast (use chuck next time). I gave it one star because I couldn't give it 0.

I can't imagine wasting a standing rib roast, which is best served medium-rare, when a cheaper, pot roast cut would be just as good, if not better, in slow cooking.

This is fabulous!  Extremely easy to put together before work, and the whole family thought it was delicious.  My family loves mushrooms, so I added 3 (8 oz) packages of fresh sliced mushrooms instead of the pound specified in the recipe.  I also sliced up two onions and minced 5 cloves of garlic and added them to the crockpot in the beginning.  I used Foster's Pale Ale beer, since I could buy one can of it for pretty cheap (I don't care for beer so never buy it).  I will definitely make this again.

This was sooo good!  I used a 2.5lb beef bottom roast and followed the recipe otherwise.  After I removed the meat from the pot I added cornstarch to the Au Jue and turned my crock pot on high for about 10 mins to make a gravy for the beef and some mashed potatoes on the side.  Mm Mm Good!  Will definitely make again!

Amazing as-is (didn't even need a knife to serve it!!), but incorporated a few tweaks to make it Y-to-the-UM.
Used 2 lbs of sliced baby bellas and 1/2 sliced white onion. Used 2 packs of soup mix, mushroom and beefy mushroom. Used 3 lb chuck roast and inserted garlic into roast (5 smashed cloves). Put soup mix largely on top of roast and added enough red wine to make it wet, but not wash it away. Used Shiner Bock beer. After done, heated remaining juice in sauce pan with Argo to thicken - served over instant mashed potatoes.

Very tasty, but for me, using a standing rib, which is an expensive cut and which I prefer medium to medium rare and oven roasted, was not my choice. I used a pot roast cut which worked perfectly.

J thank you!!!! this was soooooo awesome. I did make mentionless adjustments (more mushrooms, some sliced chunks of onion, and finely sliced garlic cloves), but the genius about this redcipe allows everyone to make worry-free additions without any concern for the outcome. I used some weak tasting beer left in the fridge, but the overall flavor still shined through. Just cooked it with a 4 pound arm roast, but unexpectedly I was only one available to make it for dinner. No problem considering the the plans I have for the leftovers: French dip sandwiches with Aujou, unlimited casserole, omelette, and stir-fry dishes. Thanks again J.

I used a smaller, different kind of roast. I was careful not to pour the beer on top of the meat but around it. This allowed the onion soup mix to form a very light "crust" on the roast which was quite yummy. Incredibly delicious for such a simple recipe!

It's very good as written but as some reviewers said, chuck is best for pot roast (a la Julia Child, PBS episode one!).  "Beer roast" is Belgian-style, for the foodie types.  I never use 'onion soup mix' but it's no big deal to use onion, pepper and beef stock (or the salty bouillon). I like to thicken the gravy one hour before serving.  Beer is Belgian-style, red wine is Beef Bourguignon.  It's an easy, excellent dish.

This turned out amazing.  My husband hates roasts normally, but went back for seconds with this recipe (and asked for leftovers in his lunch tomorrow).  This is now our go to roast recipe and I'm looking forward to making it again soon.

I used a bottle of New Belgium 1554 (Black Ale) and I added a small coarsely chopped onion and a spoonful or two of minced garlic.  I really think that using a nice full bodied beer makes a big difference in this recipe, and think that using a Bud Light (or similar) would result in a pretty bland dinner when it was all said and done. I paired the roast with some home made mashed potatoes (skin on lumpy mash) and it was excellent.

The standing rib roast is delicious just roasting it, plus an expensive cut of meat.  And a rib roast has a lot of fat (why it is so good), but it would be really fatty in a slow cooker.

Yummy!! I used chuck roast and added 2 envelopes of the onion soup mix and used a seasonal Octoberfest Beer. So easy, put it in the crockpot before leaving for work and came home to a wonderful meal. We used leftovers to make open-face roast beef sandwiches - mmmm. I'm making this again soon!!!

I made NO changes to the recipe except that I cooked it about 10 hours.  This change was only due to MY slow cooker, that NEVER cooks things in the time a recipe specifies.  That said, this was such a delicious way to prepare pot roast.  First of all, we're talking about just a handful of ingredients!  I served mashed potatoes on the side.  Made this a few weeks ago, we liked it SO much, I'm making it again this weekend!

I just wanted to add one more thought to my review.  I made this pot roast a THIRD time, and I decided to saute the sliced mushrooms with some finely chopped shallot and garlic.  I then added this to the slow cooker about one hour before I served the meal.  Made a big difference.  The old way, the mushrooms seemed a bit gummy.  This way,  they were perfect.
Ok....... saw this recipe again on AllRecipes..... and BELIEVE ME.....this should be run often......it's delicious.  But, on my last two reviews, I failed to mention two things.....#1.  I used a chuck roast....... and #2....I'm not sure the exact action of the beer..... you will NEVER know it's there.  But, use inexpensive beer.  I made the mistake of using an Oktoberfest beer on one of my times making this recipe... and I had to spend a lot of time covering up the obviousness of the beer.  Not so at all with cheaper lager.
One more thing....if you NEVER make another pot roast recipefrom this site....MAKE THIS ONE

Loved this! Made it for my family on the day they traveled out to visit me for Thanksgiving (yesterday) so dinner would be ready by the time they arrived. I added some baby carrots (I'll add them in later, next time), and used water instead of beer, and it was great. Sauce just needed a little more thickening, and next time I'll remember to get some frozen pearl onions to add, but really nothing was missing. Served it with some latkes and applesauce! Happy Thanksgivukkah :)

Worked extremely well with Bone-In Beef Ribs - used "New Castle" beer and "Beefy Onion" dry soup mix  (also sprinkled Montreal Spicy Steak seasoning on ribs before the onion soup mix) - 9 hours later...they were done to perfection - continually basting with the fat side up - the flavor was oh so unbelievably wonderful !   Perfect Dinner...well worth the wait and super easy to throw together !!   Simply Excellent !!

Can I get a "YUM"?! This was so good. I used a boneless beef blade roast (guess that's from the shoulder) and opted to use a strong, "dark" beer. The only additions were sliced up shallot, a little Worcestershire sauce and some seasoned salt. Oh, and I did use a full head of peeled garlic- I cut slits into the roast and put the garlic in. At the end of cooking time, it was literally falling apart. I removed the roast and thickened the liquids/drippings into a gravy. Served with mashed potatoes.

This recipe is AMAZING! I've made it twice now as an Italian Beef recipe.  I added a jar of pepperocini. It is the best Italian beef recipe ever! By using the package of onion soup mix instead of Italian dressing mix, it's not as salty tasting. I've also baked the leftovers with egg noodles and cheese as a casserole dish!

had incredible flavor and the juices made a gravy to die for, but as usual with all  my roasts, it was too dry.

Sounds delicious, but have not tried it yet.  What kind of beer do you use for this?

I did not have any beer so I used about 1 and 1/2 cups of water instead.  I used some thick boneless beef ribs instead of the roast.  They turned out wonderful.  This basic recipe is definitely a keeper, thanks.

This was okay, nothing spectacular. I added a little extra beer in, because the one bottle didn't quite cover the mushrooms even. The beer added great taste (Flying Fish Winter Reserve) and kept the beef nice and juicy (I used chuck steak) but lacked flavor. I took others advice and added some chopped onion, in addition to the 1 soup mix. I also added some garlic, and made a gravy out of the juices left behind. Pretty bland. We had to use quite a bit of salt to eat it. Doesn't seem worth trying again, I wouldn't know where to start in what else to add.

I've made this recipe for years and years without the mushrooms.  I just don't understand why it calls for standing rib roast?  This is a delightful recipe with a chuck roast which benefits from all day cooking.  When I started making this in the 70's,  I used the oven.  Put the FROZEN chuck roast in a dutch oven, add the beer and sprinkle with the onion soup mix.  I find Mrs. Grasso's far less salty than the leading brand.  Set oven at 250 deg and go to work.  When you get home - ambrosia!  Another tip - remove the beef and keep warm on a plate.  Take 6 gingersnaps and crumble into the gravy to thicken it.  When thickened to your preference, put the beef back and serve.
Don't waste your standing rib roast on this recipe!

This was soooo good and sooo simple. Like other members I used a Chuck roast instead. I couldn't buy a single can of beer where I shopped, so rather than buy a 6 pack I used a can of beef broth. I saw others taking extra steps to thicken the juices to make gravy, so I followed the advice another chef offered and braised my meat on each side with seasonings and flower before placing it in the crockpot. That made the juices form a nice gravy on their own. Such a good recipe that lends itself to easy modification yet stands on it's own. Can't wait to try it with beer!

Ok - I TRIED to like this really. Maybe it is the type of beer, but my husband (who works in a restaurant)didn't think it was the beer. I used Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Maybe it was the combination of that beer with the onion soup mix but the seasoning of the roast and the vegetable was inedible. Unfortunately, I was making this for a birthday dinner celebration as ONE of the main courses (had shrimp wrapped in bacon as the other)and had to rush around in the last hour to do everything possible to change the flavor of the meat and added carrots. Finally worked out but not without some seasoning magic from my husband. VERY DISAPPOINTED!

I tried this with some variations (dried shitakes, 2 bottles of beer and I added some quartered red potatos) and it was so delicious. I love that you don't need to brown the meat beforehand - 1 less item to wash!

The only mistake I made with this recipe is I didn't read the reviews first and spent $25 on a piece of meat. I will make this next time with a much cheaper cut of beef. Other than that it was fabulous. Made a nice gravy out of the juice and served it over mashed potatoes.

The recipe was easy to prepare.   As a few reviewers suggested, I rubbed the meat with garlic and added an onion to the recipe.  I used a brown beer from New Hampshire (from the beer of the month club).    Due to weather issues, I had to wait for more than 10 hours before serving.  The meal held up well with the extra cook time.   
Overall, the beef was moist and the sauce tasted good on potatoes.

For all the non beer drinking folks out there, the same amount of broth or water may be added. Adding a soda may make it too sweet and isn't good for people with diabetes.

Absolutely excellent!  I also cut up 2 onions into rings and put them as the bottom layer below the mushrooms.  Served this with roasted potatoes and roasted carrots.  Planned to use the leftovers for sandwiches, but I left the leftovers sitting on my counter all night, and very unfortunately had to pitch them.  I was really looking forward to those sandwiches, too.  ARGH.

Bone in roasts are hard to find so  I used a Boneless Chuck Roast   It was good but should have tried the roast instead.  Next time.

Came out well, used a cheaper cut of meat. Added cut up onions to the mixture as well.

Nice recipe; I had to substitute the standing rib roast (I didn't have the heart to crock-pot an expensive cut like that!), using instead a bottom round. I smoked it quickly on the Weber as well, and gave it a bit of char as well. Then into the crock pot, but substituted the beer with Young's Double Chocolate stout. Turned out fantastic! Thanks for the recipe posting!!

Good recipe. Meat was nice and tender. I doubled the amount of mushrooms and made gravy out of cooking juice and mushrooms. I used dark beer to give it a more robust flavor. We will make it again.

AWESOME!  You can even substitute a lesser expensive cut of meat like chuck blade arm roast!  You can even make it Gluten Free; substitute Dr. McDougall's Spring Onion Noodle Soup (minus the noodles) for a McCormick's style brand and use Red Bridge Gluten-Free Sorghum Beer by Anheuser-Busch.  AND . . . the best - it only takes 5 - 10 minutes to prepare and you're out the door!

Made this tonite for a special occasion, WONDERFUL!
Used a can of Kilkenny, an amazing Irish beer, just as I would use a top of the line red for a boeuf bourguignon... delicious, juicy, (brazed it before cooking), marvellous “gravy”

This recipe was good, but the meat lacked flavor. The mushrooms were good, and we added carrots which also turned out well. At the suggestion of others, we made garlic mashed potatoes that went really well with the juice from the meat, but the actual meat was a little bland.

I loved this recipe.  As I was preparing it I thought it would come out to bland.  I love lots of flavor and spice.  Along with the mushrooms I added two whole Jalapeno, one garlic clove, and a whole chopped onion.  I know it already had the soup mix but I like the real deal best.  The turn out was great just enough spice! I also recommend putting enough beer to cover the meat.  The top was dry but the rest was mouth watering.  I am actullay making it again tonight by request of my husband.

This has become my all-time favorite Beef Roast crockpot recipe - and I've tried tons! No mushy veggies or tomatoes to eff the flavor up. I love how I can change the flavor slightly depending on what beer we have in the fridge. Don't worry if you don't have fresh shrooms on hand either. Canned mushrooms (drained) work just as well! Love this recipe!!!

This was a super simple and very tasty roast.  I used a deer neck roast and it didn't have a wild game taste when it was done which I was glad of.  When I added the beer it looked like it was going to be dry so I added more which I wished I had not done.  As the mushrooms cooked down the juices rose and I think I watered the flavor down a bit.  But I will be making this one again, as directed!

My husband loved this recipe. I've never really liked roasts, so it didn't seem anything too special to me aside from that the juice made a great gravy for potatoes. It was REALLY easy and quick to throw together, and that's a big plus in our house. I'm sure I'll make it again, but it didn't change my feelings about roasts.

This was disappointing. It sounded great, but came our really bland, despite the onion and two garlic cloves that I added. When I heated up leftovers I added 1/2 c. of red wine and more soup mix, and that helped,but I won't be making this again.

This was a hit.  I have made something similar, but without the beer.  This time I used this recipe minus the mushrooms and added 4 beef bouillon cubes.  My husband loved it!  He said it was better than his moms, so it must have been good. This would also be good with some peppers in it I think.

Both my meat & potatoes BF and my veggie- loving daughter RAVED about this roast. Made with two 2.5 lb roasts and served over wide egg noodles once, and with mashed taters another time. Used dark beer (Negro Modello) and added a sweet onion on top of the shrooms. Next time I'd probably double the mushrooms to have more with the leftovers (which were event better than the first night).   The broth is very thin and would make a great base for soup - thinking LO noodles, shredded LO beef, and maybe some frozen veggies.

This was my first time using a slow cooker and this was the perfect recipe for me to start with... it came out delicious! I cooked for nine hours and might try just a little less time the next time, maybe 8-8 1/2. I did put two packs of the onion soup mix as others suggested. It was great, I was afraid it might be too much but it was fine. My hubby loved and asked that we make it a staple for the family.

This wasn't awful, but it wasn't great. The roast turned out rather dry, and the mushrooms had a funny taste. I thought it was a huge waste of mushrooms, since I LOVE mushrooms. My husband suggested I look for another recipe.

I made this a few days and my husband and I loved it! Definitely my favorite roast recipe to date. I used a smaller roast, about half the mushrooms and a can of light beer just because that's what we had in the house. And it still turned out delicious. I highly recommend!

I used a center cut beef roast (a less expensive cut) and it was wonderful.

I have never made a pot roast before and was hesitant to make something like this. This particular recipe was sent in an email from All Recipes and after clearing it with the husband, I was given the go ahead to make it. I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of adding a 2nd envelope of onion soup mix. I checked on it periodically throughout the day and Moonpie (that’s the husband) said, “it needs more water. Never heard of a pot roast cooking like this.” He literally ate his words. The mushrooms cook down along with the beer to make a great dish. I have gotten requests to make it weekly for him and his children. The funniest thing about the recipe: I am a vegetarian so I can’t taste to make sure it didn’t need seasoning.

I am in love with this dish! The meat was so tender and flavorful, it just fell right off the bone. I used a bottle of Sam Adams Boston Lager for the beer. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

This was so easy and turned out so delicious. I used two packets of beefy onion soup mix and added onions. Also, I used Guinness as the beer because the full flavor is just begging to be paired with beef. Everybody in my family just loved it. We made sandwiches with the leftovers and they were just as tasty.

This was thee best mushroom pot roast I’ve ever made! I only reduced the amount of beer due to a smaller roast..sent hubby to the store! Lol, but the family loved it as well. The beef was so tender and the mushrooms, so juicy and full of flavor. My only complaint, it was devoured so no leftovers for sandwiches the next day!

I will def make this again!  The roast was falling apart and very tinder. I used an arm roast because I already had one and used beef broth since I didn't have beer.  My husband was very impressed and we had leftovers for a few days.  The au jus was PERFECT!! I also used more mushrooms because we love them.

I made this using chuck, not standing rib roast. Other than the meat, everything else was the same and I'm rating it as such. I just can't "ruin" prime rib by putting it into the slow cooker. In all fairness, though, I HAVE used leftover cooked prime rib in a stew recipe - Julia Child demonstrated that on tv years ago. This recipe screams out for a cheap cut. Sorry, but that's my experience.

Wow!!!  Was so good,  the meat was so tender and moist. With only a few ingredients that we usually always have stocked.  Made mash potatoes to go with it.  This is definitely a make again.

This makes an extremely tender meat. My grocery store doesn’t even sell a standing rib roast so I had to go with a different roast. I used exactly a pound of mushrooms and thought it might be too much, really. The mushrooms I had were quite big so I would suggest using small mushrooms and one must really like mushrooms. I don’t usually change up a recipe the first time but I did add some red potatoes to the crock pot because I had them to use up. The beer on hand was Guinness. We used the left over meat for cheese steaks and French dips, which we really liked!

This was great! I didn’t have beer on hand, so as another reviewer suggested I used ginger ale.  I also added one large chopped onion for more flavour with the mushrooms. I used a cheap roast from Walmart and a pack of Knorr onion soup mix. The roast already had some seasoning rubbed onto it. It turned out delicious and was a bit with the family! I used the juices to make a gravy by adding some cornstarch and heating in a separate pot. This roast paired with homemade mashed potatoes and veggies is awesome !

I made no changes, will certainly make it again when I need something easy to make. I did put it in a casserole for the oven and cooked for 2 hours.  Only had strip loin steak but it turned out beautiful.  Because of the cut of meat I didn't have to cook it very long for a tender meat.

Better to use a cheaper cut of beef like a blade or arm roast. Good beer important. Guinness Stout or Sierra Nevada Torpedo Ale. This is a good simple recipe.

This is a delicious way to make a beef roast. I would never use a rib roast but opt for a chuck roast that is a third the cost and is just as good.

The only changes I made were to add an onion to the bottom with the musthrooms and use a chuck roast but otherwise exactly as described.  I really love mushrooms and wanted this to be great but found the beer flavor didn't disappear as others described and the broth was a little bitter.  Maybe I'll use a lighter beer next time as I used a stronger flavored ale and that may be the issue.

I made this recipe. It is awesome! I love mushrooms and I had a lot of mushrooms and broth left over. Looking forward to making something with it.  I made it with lite beer as that is the only thing I had on hand. I drink a beer usually with a little more flavor, so  I am looking forward to trying it out with a darker beer.

Outstanding with little work!  I did add onion & garlic.  Since some reviewers said it was dry, I turned the roast (used a shoulder roast & 3 beef ribs to add flavor from the bones) over halfway and can't complain about a dry hunk of beef.  Yummy!

Delicious as is! I've added carrots and onions and potatoes, too. I've used red wine, instead of beer, which is also delicious. Much to hubby's dismay, I used the rest of a very $$ bottle of vino but boy was it yummy!!!

why would anyone use a standing rib roast like a pot roast? Save your money and by a cheap cut. It comes out the same after 9 hours in a slow cooker.

Only reason it only got a 4star is because of all the fat in the roast. Standing rib is a good tasting roast but what a waste of money with all the fat out and in the roast. The gravy was one of the best mushroom gravies I ever had. Next time I'll use a different roast but not change anything else

This recipe was very good.  And the best part,  its easy to make.
The first time I made it, I made exactly to the recipe four stars.  The second time I made it, I added onions with the mushrooms  and used cabernet sauvignon red wine instead of beer.  Much better with red wine and got it five stars.

I saw this and just had to comment.  It sounds wonderful but seems to be a new take on a really old recipe that was cooked in the oven.  May I share?
Take an at least 2"thick piece of cheap beef (usually flat topped but doesn't really matter) and put it on tin foil.  Spread some A-1 over the top.  Mix a can of Campbell's mushroom soup w/a pack of Lipton Onion soup.  Schmear it over the meat.  Seal it up really good w/the foil, tight as you can but not touching the meat, we're going for steam here. Cook in a 350 degree oven (or 325) for as long as your cookbook says for the weight of meat that you are using.

A few things to know:   1:  Place the meat on a rimmed cookie sheet, no matter how tight you wrap that puppy, it's gonna leak!  2.  You are gonna have gravy so make something that goes with.  3.  Your home is gonna smell WONDERFUL!

I gave this only 4 stars because I was a little disappointed with the taste using beer but that was just to experiment with the flavor. I went back to using red wine which I cook with a lot. I also added 4 cloves of minced garlic, 1/4 tsp of fresh thyme leaves and a bay leaf. Like others suggested I stuck to using the good old stand by, a 3 to 4 lb chuck roast. Very tender, very tasty. I always make a nice thick gravy with the pan juices because we like to have carrots and potatoes with ours.

This was a great recipe! I used beef stock instead of the beer, though. Falling-apart, deep-flavor good! No leftovers for sandwiches, though.

Delicious! I used a 3lb chuck roast and a bottle of a good dark coffee stout. We loved this, and we REALLY loved the sandwiches that we had the next night from the leftovers.

Never in a million years would I put such an expensive piece of beef into the crock pot! Please save money and use a cheaper cut (this is what your crock pot was made for!). I use a chuck roast and it comes out incredible every time. I also add 5 cloves of garlic and one sliced up onion. You can (and I do sometimes) throw in some baby carrots. If you don't have beer, or don't want to use it, sub low sodium beef broth - comes out great!! When I use beef broth, I also add 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the pot. Very, very good!! My four star rating is based on the original recipe. I feel it easily goes to five stars with the changes I made.

4 because the meat was the wrong cut. Someone who doesn't know meat will overspend when unnecessary. Chuck or bottom round would be the correct choice for a crockpot. The recipe was tasty.

Nothing so versatile ( and foolproof) as a beef roast in slow cooker. The always puzzling part of this recipe is why waste an upright rib roast?
When it's all said and done any good beef roast will come out just as good,maybe better as more expensive cuts may cook to pieces.

Followed the directions to the word!  My son (not a big onion or mushroom person) and I both loved it!!  Probably the best beef I've ever made.  Easy and great!
Used an almost 4lb chuck and came out tender and lots of flavor.

This has been added to the rotation.  It's fabulous.  I use a blade roast, add a sliced onion to the bottom, make incisions into the roast and insert cloves of garlic.  No other changes.  It's fantastic, easy and my toddler will eat it. Win!

used the onion soup mix recipe from this website (used better than bullion as base), used a 2/12 lbs sirloin that I salt and peppered then browned. Added carrots and potatoes to bottom of crock pot. At the end I thickened the save on the stove w/ some flour. cooked for 7 hrs on low. Used Sam Adams beer.Delish!

I substituted a 4 lb. boneless chuck roast (exceptionally easy to shred!)  After cooking, removed from cooker and let cool, then shred with a fork.  I also removed liquid, thickened on stove to make a gravy, then added everything back to cooker.  As suggested by others, makes great sandwiches the next day or a great chili meat, too!.

I added a tbsp of minced garlic and a bay leaf to the liquid, seasoned the roast well with Worchestire sauce, no salt seasoning mix and pepper. When I removed the roast the liquid was just salty not really beefy tasting so I added a pouch of sodium free bouillon, pepper and some horseradish sauce, it was okay.

Great recipe!  I took other posters' advice and added sliced onions on the bottom and also used the onion soup mix recipe on this site.  I put everything together the night before so it was ready to go first thing in the morning. I also fried up a few additional mushrooms, because you can never have too many mushrooms, added the liquid and veggies from the slow cooker to the pan and reduced slightly before thickening with cornstarch and served with mash potatoes. Received rave reviews from the family!

This roast was delicious despite the fact that I chose a bitter beer (Guinness Draught).  I didn't taste the bitterness until I tasted the sauce and it was an after taste.  I hate bitter beers!  My SO likes to trick me into tasting bitter beers just to see my "bitter beer face".  Next time I make this, I'll use something I would drink.  I should have known that because that's what they always say when cooking with wine.  The beer did not ruin the roast and I used a cheapish 2 pound bottom round roast because there's only 2 of us.  After about 10 hours, I couldn't slice it because it just wanted to shred.  Tomorrow, I'll make cheese steak sandwiches with the leftovers.  Thanks J for a great and oh so easy recipe.

Tried this recipe, but as many others mentioned, used a cheaper cut of beef. It came out very good. Used portabella mushrooms, which held up very well for being cooked for ten hours. Next time I might add some carrots or potatoes. Like to try a recipe as written before I "fix" it.

I used an Irish Red. I love mushrooms so I added 12 oz white, 8 oz baby bella's. While I was buying the shrooms, I noticed some dried morel's. I boiled in water for 20 minutes and used the morel's and the water I boiled them in. It had turned brown and looked like it should be added. 2 pkgs of soup mix also.

I added more beer. I wanted to be sure the roast didn't get dry and was completely covered. So, I put in a bottle of beer, then filled the bottle with water and added that, then another bottle of beer, until I had a few bottles of beer and water covering it completely. The juice is so good that you won't want to throw it out. I am making french dip sandwiches today rather than just a roast since the juices are so good. The mushrooms will be on the side for people who want some (the kids don't love mushrooms but they love the juices and meat).

Our family is made up of baseball players and they rate my recipes based on baseball hits (single, double, etc) ... they said this was a "homerun". Fantastic. I added some onions as other reviewers suggested and my sons asked me to double the mushrooms next time (they hate mushrooms!). The family is anticipating the next time I make it ...

My family LOVED this recipe. I did quickly brown the roast in a little butter before putting it in the crock pot. My beer of choice was Guinness Draught. AMAZING!

I unfortunately did not have a positive experience with this recipe.  The beef came out stringy and semi-tough.  It's possible it was the beef itself but I don't think I will attempt again.  Thank you for sharing though!

This is great!  I threw it together in about 5 minutes before heading to work and let it look after itself.  I thickened the juice with a tablespoon of cornstarch near the end to make a thicker gravy and we had it with mashed potatoes.  Tomorrow night I think we will try the cheese steak sandwiches. My husband and I both work full time and getting good hot meals that are stress free are important.  Definately will be making this again!

This has to be the best beef slow cooker recipe my friends and family have tried!  Fork tender and tasty, the only change I made was to add some flour towards the end to thicken the gravy.  No leftovers with this meal!

I normally use an envelope of onion soup mix for my roast (which I love), so the thought of using beer was a twist. Being a Bud Light drinker, that's what I had on hand and honestly...it didn't make much of a difference from the water I normally used.  Will try this again with a much stronger beer.  I didn't follow everyones "garlic mashed" suggestion, I put some potatos in the beer.  WOW! Now those were good!!!!

Awesome! I was looking for something different to do with a roast and this was wonderful. I used a chuck roast and it came out very tender and flavorful.  Thickened the broth and it was a hit.

Cooked it for 9 hours.. didn't need a knife to cut but was a little dry.  Great flavor! Added more mushrooms than recipe, also added carrots, quartered onions and potatoes. The best pot roast I ever made.. I'll try adjusting the cooking time to make it more tender. Used chuck since they say that makes for a very tender roast.

This recipe is a keeper. The taste's are fabulous.  I cooked it on low for 8 hrs. and the meat was a little dry, next time I will cook for 7, and will add more mushrooms. Thank you so much for the recipe.

Very good as is. Used a chuck roast and a bottle of Negra Modelo for the beer. Will mod next time to suit our tastes a little better (double the mushrooms, add onion, add whole garlic, and probably use a leaner cut of meat). Definitely give it a go as is before changing it up.

This was wonderful!. First of all, please do NOT use a standing rib roast-too expensive, and not enough fat! I made it with a chuck roast. Added carrots, potatoes & onions. I did dust it with seasoned flour & seared before putting it in the slow cooker. Great flavor!

This recipe is super easy!  I made this exactly as written.  We like more onion and garlic flavor, so next time I will try placing some thin sliced sweet yellow onions and adding some garlic cloves . I made this as part of my meal prep for healthy grab-and-go meals.  I have 2-compartment prep containers., so I put roast beef, mushrooms and sauce in entree compartment and mashed sweet potatoes in the side compartment - yummy, hearty freezer friendly meal!

Oh my goodness this was so tasty.  Did as others had said about adding sliced onions as well as mushrooms to pan, inserting slivers of garlic in a 4lb chuck roast, poured more than half of a 796ml bottle of Belgium beer and one package of onion soup mix.  The only change I would make is to add some good black pepper.  Cooked on high for some of the time as my slow cooker seems to work slower than my old model.  The end result was the tenderest meat and the most beautiful gravy which was thickened up with corn-starch.  The left overs are slowly heating up as I type this.  Don't think twice about this one....yum yum

very easy.   very tender, but not flavorful enough.  i prefer the chicago italian roast beef recipe, which is similar in technique and preparation, but has more flavor and seasoning.

A version of this recipe probably exists in every home cook's recipe file. It's a basic beef in a slow cooker starter. Not sure why it calls for a standing rib roast ......... almost ANY beef will become tender after 9-10 hours. I used a 1 pound eye of round roast, half a pound of fresh mushrooms, and everything else as-written. It was tasty, tender, and served over egg noodles.

I followed some of the suggestions - Guinness Beer, double the mushrooms, also browned the roast before putting it in the crockpot.   Would make this again.

Mississippi pot roast is my usual (so succulent and flavorful).  Threw this into the mix and it failed.  Made as scripted  and it was boring. This cannot be solely based on the type of beer used; I’m not sure any beer could save this.   I really wanted to like this, but I’m not making it, again-despite my adoration of mushrooms.

I made this with a sirloin roast of beef and used the beefy onion soup mix and mushrooms and  it was delicious.  I added mixed vegetables and noodles to the left-over broth and  meat and had a wonderful vegetable- beef noodle soup.
It was great!

This was a big hit as the meat just falls apart. We added large carrots and large chunks  of potato’s with the whole mushrooms. You can the Sri k and add corn starch to make a gravy as well.

We used rump roast (Anyone who uses a standing rib roast and shoves it in a slow cooker for 10 hours is either insane or really rich and we are neither of these) also I used a nice Stout (Beer is for pork) and also since most pre-made dried soup mixes contain mono-sodium glutamate we used a 1 fresh white onion. We trimmed the fat off the meat and used Baby Bella mushrooms. We then followed the cooking instructions and it came out delicious.

I make my roast like this all the time. Instead of beer you can add beef broth or even a can of French onion soup or mushroom soup.  I usually use a sirloin roast.

Very good, but I replaced onion soup mix with fresh onions, carrots, bay leaf and a bouquet garni of fresh thyme, parsley and rosemary tied with string, as well as a good stock cube dissolved into a few tablespoons of boiling water. Far better and fresher plus the veg adds to the unctuous gravy/sauce

This was very good but I felt like it needed a little more flavor. I used beef stew meat and cooked on high for 6 hours-meat was really tender. I also added 2 small sliced onions and about 4 garlic cloves on top of the mushrooms. Towards the end I mixed in some corn starch to thicken it a bit. When I heat up the leftovers I’ll add some Worcestershire and/or soy sauce just for some zing.

The meat was tender to the point of falling apart. Everyone enjoyed it even my grandchildren, who asked for seconds. I will make this again for sure.

This is a great recipe! Easy and oh so delicious. I used the juices to make a gravy using half and half and a bit of cornstarch. So good! My boyfriend doesn't care for mushrooms, but he happily devoured these. Flavor is anazing!

This was pretty good. I actually used 3 small venison roasts, about 1.5 cans of beer and also added thyme & rosemary. Mine cooked for about 10.5 hours (on low) and it was nice and tender.

This was easy to make and the roast was very tender.  I made it exactly as the recipe instructed, but we found the flavor lacking.  I probably won't make it again.

I tried this recipe today.  We generally make this with just the onion soup mix, and water.  The beer seems to have killed the seasoning of the onion soup mix.

It didn't taste bad, but I think I prefer it my way better.

Very easy and delicious. I did use a bottom round or chuck roast because it was on sale. Very tender! I may add more mushrooms next time and leave them whole if they’re the smaller button type.
Thank you for sharing.

Very expensive cut of meat to use in this recipe.  But it was delicious.  Am going to try the same ingredients, but perhaps sub out for a more affordable bone in cut of meat next time.  Imperative that you remove all the fat from the liquid before serving.

3.8 lbs. Roast.  Added onion rings...medium onion.  Used Guinness as my beer.  Cooked low in crockpot  9 Hrs.  Too long.  Guinness was 11.5 oz. Too much liquid.  1 lb. sliced mushrooms and Lipton onion mix. OK flavor.  So disappointed in recipe.  Too much Liquid for Roast.  Will make again yet tweak the recipe.  Less beer, Less cook time.  I have been cooking a long  time, yet thought I might try this out.  Disappointed.

I got a 5lbs roast so I ended up using two packets of onion mix and two cans of beer. Plus I added carrots, and a heaping tablespoon of garlic.

This cooked way to fast, in 4 hours on low so I'm not sure what I did wrong, was very good though, threw in some small potatoes in with the mushrooms and did the ginger ale instead of the beer.

I agree with others although the five star taste is watered down by using a cheaper cut of beef the end result is a very tasty tender roast..

This recipe was delicious, and it can't get any easier!  I used top round, and at the end of cooking, shredded it, then returned it to the broth.  That cut of meat worked perfectly.   It seems like a waste of rib roast to use it in this recipe!  We served it over mashed potatoes.  The only change I made was that I added thinly sliced onions on top of the mushrooms. Update:  I made this again, but served it over quinoa.  It was no where as good.  Quinoa is usually a great substitute for rice, so I was surprised.  I'll stick with the mashed potatoes in the future.  Also, I used an American Pale Ale for the beer.  I want to try a brown ale or porter next time.

Is the liquid from the beer supposed to cover the mushrooms or meat? As of now it doesn’t cover the mushrooms at all so the beef is not in liquid. Wondering if I should add more.

It was ok. I used Carona.  I cooked my mushrooms separately as they absorb liquids and I was fearful they would be spongy.  I used a bottom roast,  which is what I alwAys use when making my roast in the slow cooker.  It normally falls apart.. this was dry and unflavouraful.

Awesome, fall apart roast. Like others I used a 4.5 lb rump roast but did also add a medium chopped onion. I used a bottle of Amberbock beer and the flavor was amazing.

This was really good! I used a rump roast and Guiness Stout beer. During the last hour of cooking, I removed the roast, and whisked in a packet of mushroom gravy mix with the juices, then returned the roast for the remainder if the cook time. Yummy gravy for over rice or potatoes! Will definitely make again. Thank you for the easy recipe!

Bad results due to beer! Had only 8 oz. mushrooms, added 2 medium carrots, and half sweet onion on bottom of pan. Placed  2.75 lb top sirloin tip roast on top, poured 12 oz. Cameron's Ambear Red Ale - made in Ontario. Spread 1 pkg. Knorr onion soup mix on top. This is my first time ever using a slow cooker - bought it 2 days ago just for this recipe.  Beef was well done after  9 hours on low, vegetables were perfect, not mushy. Cooking juices smelled like pure BEER and yeast when I lifted the lid! Could not stand that smell!  Never cooked with beer before. Lots of juice in the pot. Looking forward to it anyway............. 
Enjoyed the beef and vegetables, but could not stand the beer smell and taste. 
Otherwise very good with mashed potatoes.  Removed the juices. Instead used beef  stock and thickened it with gravy thickener. It was a little  better that way. Love the crock pot, but will make beef roast again and again until I get the right combination of flavors. Will definitely sear the meat next time - it should add a lot of flavor. Disappointed but not giving up.

Maybe because I used beef broth instead of BEER it did not turn out tender at all. I cooked it in the crockpot on low from 8am-8pm.Disappointed

So so good and easy. I followed the recipe except per other reviews I added an extra pack of soup mix and I used a 3lb chuck roast. Cooked for 9 hours and it was excellent. I probably could have used a bigger roast for the amount of mushrooms but my crock pot is mid size so it was really packed in there until the mushrooms cooked down. Served with roasted potatoes and rosemary

I'll preface this by saying that I'm one of those people who rates the recipe -- not my version of the recipe with all ingredients and proportions changed, unless the change is very, very minor.  In this case, I'll echo others by saying that I would never put a standing rib roast in the slow cooker, and I myself used a chuck roast.  Under the circumstances, I probably wouldn't have rated this recipe at all, but there's another issue -- the recipe doesn't mention the type of beer that should be used.  For those such as myself who are not beer connoisseurs, this is critical missing information.  I used a hoppy beer leftover from a friend's visit that completely ruined the mushrooms in this dish, leaving them intensely bitter.  The meat didn't absorb the bitterness all the way through, so it was salvageable, and I doctored up the gravy with cream and wine to remove as much as the bitterness as possible.  The mushrooms just needed to be strained out and thrown away though.  Such a waste...

I do think this could be a good recipe, but not as written.  Use a chuck roast or other cut more appropriate for the slow cooker and use a non-hoppy beer.  I'm still not sure what would be ideal though!

The recommended type of roast wasn't available so we used a different kind.  Still came out nice and tender/juicy (seems like any kind of roast will work).  We shredded the leftovers and used them for beef fajitas--so yummy.

The only change I made was using a 3 lb "mock" pot roast instead of the rib roast.  The meat was delicious!  Oh, and I cooked it on high for 5 1/2 hours.  I will definitely make this again!

This was delicious! The meat was cooked perfectly and evenly; we did substitute root beer in for the bottle of beer, and potatoes for the mushrooms; it was still amazing. Would definitely recommend to people with busy schedules, its super easy!

This recipe is very easy and makes a tasty meal. I made it exactly as the recipe stated except for using a cheaper cut of meat as many reviewers suggested. The meat was fork tender when I got home from work, the broth was tasty and the mushrooms were a great addition. The only thing I would say is that it needed a little spicing up, even needed salt. Next time I might add two envelopes of soup mix or try some extra seasoning. I do think the leftovers will make good sandwiches, and I might also even try simmering the shredded beef in some barbecue sauce and see how that tastes. I feel sure I will try this again.

We made this for dinner and it was ok. I found it a little bland and would definitely add beef broth or bouillon cubes to it if I were to make it again. Salt... I did use a import lager beer, but could not really taste it.  Possibly thicken the broth slightly also.

This recipe was OK. I prefer to have a rib roast done with a dry heat. I found the liquid in the crock pot was way too much . Tried to make gravy and ended up with a very bland gravy. I won't be making this recipe again.

My family did not like it as cooked.  I ended up shredding it and adding some peppers, onions and salsa and using it in a fajita.  Then they liked it. I would not go to the trouble again to make it this way to serve as a roast.

Followed the recipe but used a leaner cut of meat. A little dry for my taste but the vegetables were excellent. Will make it again.

this was amazing, but I modified it. I put butter all over it, and minced garlic, then used nature's seasoning all over it and added onions. the flavor was so amazing, even my 7 year old picky, doesn't like"steak" loved it. I also used whatever roast was in my freezer. I believe rump, but I can't remember

I did not make any changes, but next time I probably will, by adding white onions.  It was sooo easy to make, and that is a huge plus if you need a meal quickly and are low on time on spending time at the stove cooking.  I might trim some of the fat off, too next time but not all of it.  I wish my Kroger had fresher 3 lb beef roast cuts, it would've turned out better.  But that has nothing to do with the recipe.  I served mashed potatoes the first time, then tortilla wraps with cheese, lettuce, salsa, and raw onion with leftovers, it was delish!  So easy to make, and tasty.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, I'll make it again, I'm sure.

This is a very good base , recipe and starting platform. My wife and I love to cook ! We were very excited to try this recipe. For the taste and palate in this house it needs some extra life. If u like mushrooms .... use 4-6x the called for amount of mushrooms. They got lost in the meat. We like garlic and onions too. Don't be afraid to toss in as muchas ur family likes of either. We like basil , rosemary and Tyme here too. Such a large hunk of meat will need extra seasoning also. The onion dip mix didn't do the trick. If u ask me .... some salt and more pepper.   If called for. BUT honestly a great jump off point for an amazing meal here. Just needs ur families personal taste added. Then u will have and amazing meal for your family.

Excellent recipe for a beef pot roast (add some carrots and small potatoes about 2 hrs into the cooking time), for any cut of beef that needs long and slow cooking, BUT would never waste a good standing rib roast that is already a tender cut on this recipe.

I followed the directions except I added 2 Lipton onion soup mixes only because I had 2- 2 1/2 lbs of boneless beef underblade chuck roasts in which I seasoned both with 1 pkt each and I added a sliced onion with the fresh mushrooms. I cooked it on high for 5 hours and it was very tender & yummy! Everyone loved it! We are not big on beef roasts but this recipe is definitely a keeper!

I used a chuck roast and added two bottles of beer. When done, I used the liquid to make a big batch of gravy to save for other purposes - it was amazing! I threw in a few carrots from the garden about an hour before serving and enjoyed the extra texture and flavor. Served over mashed potatoes with a bit of the gravy. This one is definitely going into regular rotation.

I didn't have mushrooms on hand, so I used onion slices in the bottom of the crock-pot.  I am a regular crock-pot user & this was one of the most tender bottom round roasts I've made in a while.  The beer was a great alternative for liquid - not so much sodium.

Beef  was very tender.  Gravy was not great.
I could taste the beer.  Would follow process...mushrooms, onion soup mix,cooking time and temp, but find a substitute for beer.

This was extremely easy to make. I used a blade roast. I sliced up half a medium onion and placed it on top of the mushrooms. I also minced up three cloves of garlic and sprinkled those on top of the beef. I followed another user's recommendation of pouring the beer over the meat before adding the onion soup so it would stick better. After cooking, I shredded the (very tender) meat with two forks and served everything on a bun and made gravy from the liquid. My Dad and brother raved about this delicious beef dip sandwich. Would definitely make again.

Loved this!  Used half a bottle of La Fin Du Monde belgian ale.  It gave the beef a wonderful (but strong) flavor.  Strained the juice from the crock into a skillet to make gravy.  Bring the juice to a simmer.   Measure 1/4 cup of flour into a measuring cup and add warm water to make 1/2 cup.  Slowly pour into the skillet and stir constantly until thick.  My gravy always comes out lumpy so I use my hand blender to smooth it out.  Perfect!  Would definitely make this again.

Incredibly easy to make. I've had terrible trouble in the last with cooking roast beef and this recipe is simple and makes beef that is easy to slice and excellent for leftovers. My husband even asked for it for his birthday.

Be patient, the beef cooked low and long will be plastic fork tender.  I put a little garlic in with the sliced portabella mushrooms on the bottom.  Made the most delicious gravy to go over mashed potatoe side.  Cut amount in half because I only had over 2 lbs of meat and was thirsty too!

It was so easy and delicious!  I added a poblano pepper to the mushrooms for an added kick.  When it was all done, we shredded it, combined with peppers and onions and made a healthier version of a philly cheesesteak!  Will definitely make this one again.

Delicous.  Only issue with us was the amount of salt in the onion soup mix.  Will probably make it again and try to find a reduced sodium mix.  Too easy and good to miss out on.

Great dish but I did make adjustments.  I tripled the mushroom with my top 3 favorite mushrooms and put pearl onions in with them.  I seared the roast on the fat side and stuffed garlic all over the roast before putting  in crocker pot.  After adding Sierra Nevada Dark Beer, I put fresh Rosemary and Thyme on top of the roast.  These extra ingredients made this a perfect meal!

I absolutely loved this!  The flavor was amazing and I loved the ease of how fast it went together.  I used portobello mushrooms and a chuck roast and the only beer I had was light, but it was still great.  I did what others suggested and thickened the juices with some corn starch and served it all over mashed potatoes.  I will definitely make this again and again!

I loved this!  The aroma was heavenly and oh so tempting.  I read some of the reviews and used a chuck roast instead of the rib roast.  Added some sliced onions on top of the mushrooms and a little extra beefy onion soup mix.   I also added some extra seasonings on top on the roast and all I can say is - YUM!  Made a heavenly gravy from the juices and served with Diane's Concannon - another recipe from Allrecipes!  Can't wait to have it again!

I used guinness and added sliced onions to a top round roast since that was what I had - the meat just fell apart. Will definitely make again.

I made it as written.  It was ok but I think I would have liked it better without the beer flavor.  It also needed salt.

Very easy and flavorful.  I did add onions with the mushrooms.  Next time I'll add 2 packets of onion soup mix to bring up the flavor.  It was done in 6.5 hours on low..fell of the bone tender!

Will definitely make this variation again.  I used a normal beef chuck roast that was on sale at the grocery instead of the cut that was called for in the recipe.

Definitely not a hit at our table last night. The flavour of the sirloin was  missing. In fact there wasn't much flavour at all, save the onion soup mix and pepper.

This sounds wonderful, but I would use a bottom round roast or a chuck roast.  I wouldn't waste a beautiful standing rib roast this way. Regular roast is already expensive enough.

This was great and easy. I used Chuck roast, bout 3-4 cups of sliced mushrooms, 1 lg onion, 3 Tbsp of garlic, some A-1 rub and Italian seasoning - I don't use onion soup mix since it has gluten in it and I trying to keep everything as fresh as possible. Brought it to work and everyone was fighting over it :-)

Wonderful recipe.  As with others, I used 4 lbs. of chuck roast, and 2 packets of onion soup mix.  Only criticism of that is that it made it a little too  salty.  One packet would have been plenty, I think.  Also added half of a medium onion and a handful of baby carrots.  It came out great.  Will definitely make this again.

I thought this excellent just as written! I used a chuck roast because I couldn't find the other and didn't want to wait to talk the butcher.  It was tender and very flavorful.  Since it just called for a beer, I used a Coors Light. Just really great flavor, will make my roasts this way from now on!

This is definitely one of the best pot roast recipes I've ever made! Yes, I did use a pot roast and I used two bags of onion soup mix. I only wish I had added more mushrooms. As my mother would say about something so delicious," this is out of this world"!

beef was bitter and dry, mushrooms were not good, and the problem exists because the original poster and many reviewers have refused to post what "beer" they've actually used ... all beers are not the same and even the same type of beer is quite different between each brewer ... after seeing "dark beer" posted and an ocktoberfest beer mentioned i used 2 bottles of Paulaner's Octoberfest Mäizen which apparently was a huge mistake ... i will NOT be making this again.

The meat turned out okay, but the mushrooms were  not edible. We used Summit beer and maybe that was why the flavor was not very good.

I enjoyed this roast immensely. It has fewer calories than the pop and cream of Mushroom soup type of recipes. Loved it. I put potatoes and carrots in the pot also. Once finished made a gravy from beef bullion and 2 T pan drippings. Whipped the potatoes and served with gravy. Nothing left. Used only a 3 pound roast and only 6 hours in crock pot.

This was phenomenal! I used Guinness and the flavour was amazing. It also made the most delicious gravy. EVER. Next time I may use a cheaper cut of meat (the cut itself was more expensive than I expected), but would make the exact recipe for a fancy company dish.

This makes a tender flavorful roast.  Even if it is pork, and you accidentally add spicy ranch dressing mix the first time you make it because you are going by memory.

I have had this with beef, pork, and now with and without the accidental addition of ranch.  Each way is delicious.

Great. I used a sirloin roast instead of rib roast  since it was cheaper and because I didn't have a crock pot I cooked it four hours in a slow (250 degree) over. It turned out great . I will make this again,

I followed this to the tee, and it was very bland.  Maybe we just like more flavor?
