Made it for dinner tonight for my fussy kids --- everyone LOVED them. A little more involved than most of our meals, but definitely worth it.  I used 2 lbs of chicken, and had plenty of leftovers.  Thank you!

I followed the directions exactly, and the cheese stuck to the pan and the spatula, but not the chicken.  I was left with tasteless chicken cooked in oil.

I made these with egg beaters and baked them with a little olive oil.  They were great and my son's friend said "best chicken ever".

A quick, simple recipe, but I found it a little bland. The second time I made these I added some garlic/oregano/onion and served with marinara sauce.

This is absolutely delicious!  I substituted vegetable oil with olive oil, even messed up and mixed the eggs in the same bowl with the cheese, and it still turned out great!  Definitely going to make this again soon.

Easy & quick! Made it like the recipe states but it would be very easy to add some seasonings to the Parmesan cheese before coating. Next time I will try that for a different spin. I used 3 chicken breasts & had quite a bit of the Parmesan cheese left over - I think you should start with just 1 cup of cheese & add more to the bowl if needed. Also had egg left so beat in another egg & stirred in the Parmesan then cooked it like an omelet. It came out looking like a fluffy golden pancake.

Easy. Excellent. Quick. Only change I made was that I added some dried basil, oregano, and garlic powder to the parmesan cheese breading.

My son just started having to stay away from wheat. So, needless to say, he really missed having chicken nuggets. So, I searched and found this recipe. I just made 5 but he really liked them a lot! I added Italian seasoning, a little seasoning salt and dried parsley flakes to the Parmesan cheese. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks for sharing it!

so i followed the recipe to the letter, ended up with burnt cheese on the pan, nothing on the chicken. -_- id rather try if i can deep fry it instead of pan frying. smh.
