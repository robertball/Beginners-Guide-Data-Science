This is to die for! Delicious and easy. The perfect topping for fresh fruit! I think I'll add cubed pound cake in addition to the fruit next time!

This is absolutely delicious! I don't like desserts that are TOO sweet, so this is right up my alley.
Instead of heavy cream and sugar, I just used Cool Whip mixed with the zest of one lemon, plus a little fresh lemon juice, then put in the freezer for about 2-3 hours. I have even tried sprinkling the top with chopped pecans.
Light and yummy, and my guests always love it!

I made this for the valentine dinner dessert last year and it got rave reviews from my husband (who is a stiff critic). I passed the recipe to my mother, who used frozen blueberries instead of fresh, and made it in advance. Her blueberries ran, and I think it messed up the consistency, so I would stick w/ fresh berries as the recipie reads.

Very good.  You do have to be careful not to overbeat the cream, I beat it until it had peaks and it made it a little too heavy.  I'm definately going to make this again.

Great summertime dessert.  The only changes I made were to double the amount of fruit to yield six to eight servings, and I only used a small amount of the sugar listed in the recipe for the fruit.

Made for my family & father-in-law and boy did I get the compliments.  Ended up having to make 2 batches of the mousse because there was only enough to do about 3-1/2 glasses.  (guess it depends on the size of the dessert cup but by the picture shown that would not serve 8.)  Anyway, he even called me when he got home to tell me it was more like a 5-1/2 star dish.  Made my night!  Followed directions to a "T".

Quick, light, refreshing and perfect for an impromptu summer dessert. An ideal dessert choice that's easily adapted to serve two or twelve. And if you use Splenda it's nearly guilt free! While it's not the hubby's preference, I sometimes like to flavor the cream with liqueur rather than the extracts--Creme de Cassis, Chambord or Amaretto are all delicious.

A refreshing summer treat! Based on other reviewers' feedback, I also omitted the lemon extract and found it plenty lemony.  Also substituted powdered sugar for granulated in the lemon whipped cream (personal preference). I upped the recipe to 2 cups of cream (changed other measurements accordingly), and a pint each of blueberries and strawberries and had enough for 5 servings.  Next time, I would probably also use less sugar on the berries, since they are plenty sweet.

This was so good!  Instead of spooning into glasses, I mashed up the fruit with some sugar, and spooned the fruit into shortcakes and topped with the cream and more fruit.  It was a wonderful mother's day dessert

So light, so tasty!!  I made this in small dessert wine glasses for a brunch I threw and actually used raspberries with the lemon mousse rather than strawberries & blueberries.  It was amazing and all of the glasses were totally empty by the time we were done!

Great recipe!  I didn't use the extracts, and I used more lemon juice as I wanted a more pronounced lemon flavor.  I served this over strawberries, blueberries, and cherries.  Delicious!

This was great--and I have to say the one time I'm sorry I listened to the reviews rather than the recipe. I double the amount of whipping cream, afraid there wouldn't be enough for 6 parfaits. Not only did I have enough, but it was way too much! You don't want a ton of whipped cream, it should be mostly fruit I think! Regardless, they were still delicious with the lemon taste! As a side note people enjoyed putting the whipped cream on their coffee for brunch!

Awesome light summery dessert.. Generally, I don't eat desserts unless they have mass amounts of chocolate, but I made this recipe for my boyfriend, and ended up loving it almost as much as he did!  Also very quick and easy to make.

I made these parfaits for a Mothers' Day brunch and everyone emjoyed them.  I left out the sugar in the fruit, and it was still sweet enough.  I also left out the lemon extract (I didn't have that in my cupboard), but the lemon juice provided enough citrus flavor. I added a little bit of granola for some crunch, and it tasted great. I will definitely make this again. Elegant looking, but easy.

This made an absolutely fabulous after-dinner dessert for us tonight.  It was soooo nice and light and the lemon flavored whipped cream was delicious. Not overly sweet and I highly recommend this to those who want something sweet but are watching carbs. This was a nice alternative to the usual cakes, pies and cookies.  A very company worthy dessert.  Thanks McCormick.

I followed this recipe almost exactly as written-had to use frozen strawberries- and was very pleased with the results! Not only was it good (I loved the lemon in it) but it presents beautifully. Next time im going to try to layer angel food cake in with the mousse and berries just to give it more substance. Also, going to keep the mousse in mind to use for shortcakes instead of plain whipped topping.UPDATE: Made this for my parents 25th anniversary dinner party. This time I added the angel food cake. It is a 6++ star this way!! I recommend that you try it this way!

I'm glad I followed some of the recommendations from reviewers before me.  Even without the lemon extract, the parfait was a bit too sour for me and my mother (since I wanted to make it for her for Mother's Day) when I added the lemon juice, so I added more whipped cream and a WHOLE LOT of sugar to tone down the lemony taste.  I used low-fat whipped cream, strawberries, raspberries, chopped walnuts, and sprinkled a bit of chocolate yogurt raisins.  Very tasty that way and also light and fluffy.  Next time, I'm going to really use about 1/8 cup (or even less) of the lemon juice.  

Other than that, I enjoyed this recipe.

It's pretty good.  Me and my boyfriend found it a little too lemony though.  It almost overpowered our berries.  It goes too much beyond freshening up the taste of the cream.

8 servings??? Only for the strong-willed. My husband & I thought it only served 2!!! I loved the tartness of the whipped cream. Used Splenda to make it low carb. I don't know if I can make it again - it's too dangerous. Need to strengthen my self-control!!!

This was very good.  I did cut back on the lemon extract to 1/4 tsp and it was plenty lemony.  I also used Spenda instead of sugar as we have a diabetic in the family and it tasted just as good as if I had used sugar.  I also layered it in a glass bowl for a pot luck.

I was looking for a healthy summertime dessert, so I used low-fat whipped topping and a bit less sugar. Even with less sugar, my husband and I thought this was way too sugary! Next time I will not add any sugar to the fruit and only about half the specified amount to the whipped cream mixture, the fresh fruit has plenty of natural sugar. Also, I halved the amount of lemon juice and we found the flavor (besides the sugar) to be perfect. With a few modifications this could be a great dessert!

My husband loved this but I don't think I would call it mousse. It was light, airy & refreshing. I did not have lemon extract (I would like to try that) and I halved the recipe (4) which in my opinion made 2 nice sized servings. Served it with strawberries only, very nice.

I made this for dessert last night.  I'm not a big fan of "fake lemon" flavor, so it was too much lemon for me (still pretty good though and my husband loved it).  I'm going to try it again without the lemon extract to see if that helps.  

I do have to say after putting the extra whipped topping in the fridge, it's much more mellow on the second day.  If you're making it for a party, it could definitely be made the day before, and then put together with the berries shortly before serving.
