I'm sorry, this was disgusting. The appearance and texture is unappealing. The cream cheese makes it too rich to eat and only makes it taste even more peculiar. I have no idea what I would call the flavour, it was non-descript. It was very quick + easy to make. Too bad we couldn't eat it.

Great kid recipe!  I just rolled out a sheet of Bisquick and slit the top and placed it on the meat and vegetable mix, like a topping of a pie.  I added potatoes.  Great combination of ingredients.

As written we do not like it but found it much better tasting and more appealing to look at if made with tomato soup (good brand).  Also cut back on cream cheese by 1/3 cup and omit canned vegetables.  Better to serve a fresh vegetable on the side.

I have to agree with POPNFRESH...the appearance was not appealing. The taste wasn't as bad as it looked but couldn't eat much of it.  The bisquits were not done on the bottom and had a ketchup taste. I won't make it again.  I had to pick a star to post this but it's not worth one star.
