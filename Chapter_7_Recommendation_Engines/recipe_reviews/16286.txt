Works great! Makes 1 cup. Convert to 22 servings to equal a 14 ounce can of sweetened condensed milk (1-1/3 cups).

My husband has Type II diabetes. Until now the recipes for several of our favorite deserts have been filed away because they use sweetened condensed milk. I make this recipe using Splenda. It works in the recipes wonderfully. Thanks.

PERFECT! I'll never buy canned sweetened condensed milk again! PLEASE NOTE: Several reviewers seem to be confused as to how much this recipe makes. I measured the amount myself after making it. THIS RECIPE MAKES 1-1/4 CUP, WHICH IS THE EXACT AMOUNT THAT IS IN A 14-OUNCE CAN. The can is measured in weight, not fluid ounces.

This was very good, and saves so much money! I make this in a hand blender using just boiled water. Throw everything in and blend for 15 seconds and it's ready to go. I have used this recipe in everything from cheesecakes to bar cookies with success.

I've used this recipe for a decade or more.  It was the first Hints from Heloise hint that I saved.  Tonight I couldn't find it but searched allrecipes and this is it.  I wouldn't use any other recipe.

I have used this recipe very successfully in The "Cherry Cheese Cake" recipe by L.J. Bryan.  I found it to be a little thick for the blender also.  Now I just put everything into a mixing bowl and use the mixer.  I don't even bother to melt the butter, just pour the boiling water on top of everything and go!  This becomes the first step of my recipe.  I actually baked two of L.J.'s cheese cakes, one with the name brand canned product and one with the substitute recipe.  We really did prefer the cheese cake made with the substitute.  It was much thicker, creamier, and had a very rich taste! (If I want a "healthy" dessert, I eat fresh fruit!) I use regular dried milk as opposed to "instant" dried milk.  I would not thin it out, as I would be afraid that my dessert would not set up properly!!  Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe DELISH. I make a lot of latin treats which require sweetened condensed milk. The store bought stuff is way too expensive now. I made a minor adjustment and added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the milk. I will FOR SURE use this recipe again. Thanks a lot!!!

Wow! I was a little worried after read some of the reviews, but I can honestly say I will NEVER buy canned SCM again! Not only is this such an easy recipe, but it tastes SO much better than the canned stuff! I did add 1/2 tsp of vanilla and I put the liquid ingredients in my mini blender before the dry ones, because several reiviews said that would be helpful! It turned out to be the perfect consistancy and tasted amazing! Some people said theirs turned out gritty from the powdered milk, but I think it depends on the brand of powdered milk you use. I have always used the store brand because of the expense, but I recently bought some from www.providentliving.org for my food storage and it was WAY better. It was very refined and powdered, whereas the store brands did tend to be more granulated. I think it made a huge difference in the way it turned out! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Thank you!! I will never go back to buying expensive canned SCM again! The measurements are perfect; put the liquids in the blender first and you'll be fine. Thanks for this perfectly adequate substitute that is way cheaper and very easy. THANKS FOR SHARING!

This was a great recipe. But if you are planning on using it with fudge, like The Peppermint Fudge, or whatever the name is, do NOT add cornstarch. I know what happens. It becomes hard and thick, and goes into a ball. Baker Bee, the problem you most likely had was undesolved sugar. Make sure you do it quickly, I did mine in a food processor, let it run until the sugar was dissolved, sometimes stopping so the processor dosen't over heat. Perfect, smooth condensed milk. I hope this helps.

First: I don't buy the expensive SCM, so this isn't that big of a money saver (b/c instant milk ain't cheap).  
Second comment:  It's a good bit thinner consistency than canned SCM, but it worked just as well in my Cafe Latte.  Third: Great for saving calories b/c Splenda can be substituted for much (if not all)of the sugar.  
Finally:  I may be an idiot, but 16 servings is just over 1 can.  I didn't realize that until the end.

This is very close to the real thing, i used it to make ice-cream and i couldn't tell the difference. I used sweetener insted sugar and it works the same way. I had to use a bit more water because it was to thick.

Only change was methodology. I melted my butter in a glass saucepan in microwave, then added the boiling water and the pre-measured sugar and powder milk. Whisked to combine and kept stirring until sugar and milk powder was all well dissolved. Ingredients were as written. Measured in grams for the dry and ended up with 12 oz. (375 ml) sweetened condensed milk.

Great recipe. I planned to make a lemon pie (key lime type) and discovered that I did not have the condensed milk. Remembering that I saw a recipe online, I found this one. It worked perfectly. Only problem, I put the sugar and powdered milk in the blender first and then blended it. When I added the boiling water and melted butter (both microwaved), a rim of milk powder stuck to the sides and glommed around the blade. I had to use a spatula and knife to scrape them loose because the "condensed milk" was VERY thick. I did not get a chance to measure the milk amount, but it looked about right for the 15 oz called for, so I just poured the 1/2 cup of lemon juice into the condensed milk to add a bit of liquid. It worked. I poured the mixture into my beaten egg yolks and finished the pie. My husband said if I had not told him, he would not have known the difference in the "homemade" and "canned" milk. Next time I will put the boiling water in the blender and pour the milk/sugar mixture on top to blend. Maybe that will keep from coating the sides and blades. Thanks for a great recipe!

I've used this successfully in baked desserts since about 1970, when I first saw it in Heloise. Adjust this recipe to 24 servings and it will make 14 oz., and it works out to level 1/4, 1/2 and 1 cup ingredient amounts (as I think may be already be posted in another SCM recipe on AR). I like to completely dissolve the butter and sugar in hot water first in the MW, then mix in the powdered milk last.

Well this was a big bummer.  I made a key lime pie and thought it would be better with home made sweetened condensed milk.  Wrong!  This SCM has a weird texture.  I did everything as it was asked.  I can't say that it tastes bad, I just can't get over the texture. I will only be making my key lime pie with OTC SCM.

I tried this recipe tonight and I have to say it is awsome! I used a hand blender and it worked well, I think it made it nice and creamy. I did have to add a few more tbls of water. Thank you for sharing such a great recipe. I will never buy condensed milk again.

Just perfect. I scaled the recipe to 22 servings like another reviewer suggested and it made exactly 13 ounces. Next time I'll try 23 servings. Worked beautifully in my magic layer bars. I'll not be buying sweetened condensed milk ever again! Thank you so much for posting!

I whisked the powdered milk and sugar together first, then added the boiling water with softened butter and 1 tsp of vanilla.  I used my immersion blender to mix it up and it was perfectly creamy with no texture issues at all. I used it to make granola bars and it worked great!  Next time I'll try honey or agave in place of the sugar and some of the water.

I needed sweetened condensed milk for a recipe and found this. But, it did not turn out like sweetened condensed milk in taste or appearance!  It had the consistency of sand and just tasted like a gritty mess.  Could not think of any recipe to use it with the same consistency of what I know as sweetened condensed milk, which is more of a sweet & semi-thick milk.  Tried to thin it out but it only became even less sweet and the gritiness remained.

Well it tastes pretty good, but it yielded only 1 cup (not nearly 2), and the milk granules did NOT dissolve all the way. I don't know what to think about that. Was I perhaps supposed to use 1 cup PREPARED powdered milk instead of just 1 cup of the powder? That would've yielded 2 cups, and certainly would solve everyone's complaints that it's too thick. But then it would be too thin. Mostly I'm not sure why the milk granules did not dissolve. That is bothersome, it's on top of my cake right now, and while the cake will be covered with cool whip too, it's still going to be noticeable. Because this didn't yield exactly what I was looking, AND because powdered milk is so godawful expensive, I probably won't use this again unless I need it for a diabetic or someone on a diet. Thanks for the recipe!

I lost me original recipe a few years back when we moved and was looking for the perfect homemade sweetened condensed milk, again.  Sadly, this was not it. It wasn't horrible, but as other posters had mentioned, consistency was not my favorite.  The flavor was good, though and I would use this recipe again for certain recipes.

I guess I thought this would taste very near to the canned product.  It's not as close taste-wise as the canned, but the consistency is very good, and the taste is not so different that it changes the outcome of the recipe that drastically. I recommend trying it!

Great recipe!  I made it sugar-free by substituing Ideal grantulated sweetener for the sugar.  I put it in my Magic Bullet and let it whir for a few minutes to really get a smooth texture.  I've made another homemade version before and couldn't get past the grainy feel and taste of the powdered milk.  I like mine really sweet so I added an extra tablespoon of Ideal to make it even sweeter.  I'm using this in place of condensed milk for a granola bar recipe on this same site to make it really healthy.  Can't wait to try them!

Its a nice substitute.  Cant say its any  cheaper but good if you dont want to run to the store for canned milk.  I added vanilla to mask the powder milk taste and used it in granola bars from this site.  Worked fine.  Mine was pretty thick so I added a tiny bit more boiling water.

I love it! Yummy and so easy! Worked perfectly in the granola bar recipe I use from allrecipes (Easy Granola Bars). I did as someone else suggested and changed the servings to 23 - it did turn out thicker than normal SCM so if you need it a bit thinner just add water a Tbsp at a time. Thanks for a great recipe.

I find it does have a slight milk powered taste to it but over all its great to make it yourself and cut down or cut out the sugar.

I'm going with 4 because I changed it a bit, but mine worked very well with the Caramel Popcorn Balls recipe on this site. I didn't have skim milk powder so I used 2 large pkgs (102g each) of vanilla instant pudding powder instead. [I didn't read the reviews beforehand so I put the dry stuff in the Magic Bullet first--don't do that!] Apparently with the liquids first, it's fine. I also had to add extra water as needed, which was probably between 1/2 a cup, and a full cup. Didn't measure. - I didn't adjust the sugar much, as the pudding mix wasn't overly sweet to taste. It made more than the 1 cup that everyone else seems to have ended up with, also. (Between 1 1/2 cups and 2 cups)The other thing was, I omitted the vanilla extract from the Popcorn recipe.They turned out with a great flavour, so thanks for this -it gave me the headstart I needed! This blended in perfectly for that recipe, although not sure how it would work for flavouring coffee, etc.

I'm giving it five stars, because it diffently got me out of a jam, with running back to the store. I used it in Banana Pudding IV from this site. I got about 10oz. out of it. I used it all in the recipe. Thanks.

I never knew it was soo quick and simple to make condensed milk! I was amazed. This recipe, however, needs a little tweaking. It was too runny; I added an additional 5tsp powdered milk to get it to the right consistency.

I wanted to make Peanut Butter Blossoms and had no SCM...in the middle of a snow storm so no way to make it to the store. I was so excited to find this recipe! So easy! I don't have a blender so I used my immersion blender and the cookies turned out great! :-)

Good recipe.  I also need to add just a "bit" more water as the mixture was too thick for the blender to handle.  This recipe yielded just one cup vs the two cups stated.

This was wonderful. My only mistake was using low fat instant powdered milk. The flavour just wasn't full enough for me. So the next time I make this... and there will be a next time, I will make sure that the instant milk is whole milk. I won't use can any more. I will definitely pass this one on :^) Norma

Mine came out a little gritty as well even after boiling it extra long. I wouldn't use it in like a cheesecake cause you would feel the grittiness, but it worked just fine in my cookie bars. I agree powdered milk is expensive. You can also google how to make sweet condensed milk out of milk besides powdered milk. I later ran across that recipe. I didn't find this to be that much of a money saver, since I buy the store brand most of the time anyhow. Thanks for sharing

Doesn't seem to save any money, but handy when I don't have the canned stuff and I like knowing exactly what is in the foods I make.  I measured the dry ingredients in the blender first then added the water and butter.  Would have required much less scraping, if I had added the liquids first, then the dry ingredients.

The only changes I made were to make it lower sugar, I used a little over half the amount with powdered (baking) stevia and the rest sugar. I have found if I use all stevia it has an aftertaste but if I do half and half, nobody notices. Still tasted really sweet and thickened up nicely. I used this to make 2 ingredient ice cream. Even my hubby loved it and said it tasted like "real" ice cream.

delicious and nice and thick! if your butter and water are not boiling when mixing, it won't dissolve the sugar and milk correctly!

I am really happy with this recipe.  I followed the recommendations to make 22 servings because I needed 16 oz.   I only had a cup of powdered milk and added a little half and half.  The recipe was easy and turned out thick and delicious. I used it for my pumpkin pie recipe.

i made mine using my stand mixer and whisks on high speed until it was smooth - it turned out perfect - without any crystals from the powdered milk.

I made this recipe using Stevia.  I was wondering how people get so many cups out of this until I remembered that Stevia weighs/has less volume than sugar.  Change the recipe to 22 servings, like another user said, and it will be a 14oz can of SCM; HOWEVER, it will only weigh about 8-1/4oz because of the Stevia.

It really saved my behind with a last minute dessert recipe before a dinner party! It works better than any other recipe for this I've ever tried.
