This recipe was a total disaster. I had so much milk and hardly any rice. How can adding 3/4 cup rice to 2 quarts of milk make rice pudding? I was very disappointed.

I too was trying a rice pudding recipe for the first time, and without looking at other recipes I decided to try this one as to the mostly good reviews. When I completed the pudding, my Fiance, who knows rice pudding, could not understand why the recipe calls for so MUCH milk compared to the measurements of the other ingrediants. We looked in recipe books such as "Joy of Cooking", and found other recipes of six servings, with 1 1/2 - 3 cups of milk, and seem to be baffled to the porportions of this recipe. In a dessert dish, this voids about 12 servings, an additional cup of rice, and maybe double the sugar, and it would be much improved.
Hope this helps others :- )

I have been searching for the perfect rice pudding recipe for some time now and I must say that I believe I have found it.  I prepared this recipe for my children, 3,2 and 8 months.  They all gobbled it up like nothing I have ever seen.  I loved it as well.  I did change some things though; I used 1 cup of long grain rice, 1 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup of whole milk combined with the egg mixture, and 1 cup of raisins.  It was excellent.  I will definitely be making this again, and again......  Thank you for a wonderful recipe that took me back to my childhood!

This was my first attempt at making rice pudding, and I have to agree that the amount of milk called for seems like way too much.  Folling the directions exactly, it took me almost 2 hours to make, and it never set up.  I now have a pan full of sweetened milk and a little bit of rice in my fridge.  This would probably be very good if you use less milk, or a lot more rice.

If found this to be a very good recipe with several changes:  1.  I steamed the rice first, using 1 1/2 cups of rice with 1 1/2 cups of water, then adding it to the boiling milk and simmering for 10 minutes. (I ended up steaming the rice in my first batch, scooping it out of the milk, after cooking it for more than an hour).  2.  I used 1 cup of sugar and a little sprinkle or two of salt, because I like things very sweet.  3.  I used 1 1/2 quarts (6 cups) of milk instead of two quarts.

This was my first try at Rice Pudding. It was a big hit at Christmas Dinner, with older people that know Rice Pudding. The only thing I changed was I added more rice, because that is the way I like it. Thanks for a great recipe!

I tried this recipe and it turned out wonderful!  I did add more rice to make it thicker.  It tasted just like my mom's without the baking.  It was quick and easy and was a hit!!  I plan on making it again and again....

This was my first itme making rice pudding. I want to make it for a 4th of July party I am having. All the relatives requested it. The recipe came out good. My only complaints is I think it needed a little more sugar and the cook time was a lot longer for me. I was afraid of scorching the milk. But, then again it was my first time. It took longer to boil the milk than I thought. Other than that, I thought this recipe was really good! My girls loved it! I will definetly make this for my 4th of July party!

Delicious and refreshing! In reading other reviews and completing the recipe three times, I have found that it is very important to follow the directions carefully. For example, be sure to pour the mixture in step 2 slowly as directed while stirring quickly. Be sure to be patient and let the milk boil @ medium in step 1. The second time I made it, I tried to boil the milk on high and ended up with burned milk. Yuck. Basically, read carefully, follow the directions precisely, be patient, and you will have delicious rice pudding!

As a Latino I've eaten my share of Rice Pudding.  This one was pretty good.  However it was too much milk.  It depends on how thick you want your pudding to be.  Traditional Latin Rice Pudding is pretty thick and firm so I used 1 1/2 Quarts of milk (which includes the 1 cup to mix with the eggs and sugar).  I also added 2 teaspoons of cornstarch to the sugar.  Also, for me, the best rice to use is short grain rice or pearl rice.  The best results come after setting up in the refrigerator overnight.

As an added note I've made this with Fat Free Milk 2% and Splenda and it also came out wonderful. Just an idea.

How is it possible that this recipe got a 4 star rating?  In trying rice pudding for the first time, the reviews were right - too much milk, not enough rice.  It took a hour to rework in process and I ended up with 3 times the rice pudding that I intended.  We'll see how (if) it sets up.

Everything went great, until the second boil, after adding egg mixture.  Even with vigilant stirring, I wound up with scrambled eggs and rice.  Definitely think the milk/egg mixture Ned's to be tempered before adding into the hot milk and rice.  Have tried much better rice pudding recipes and will probably stick with those in the future.

I did not look at the comments before making this.  Unfortunately I found the same issue as one other commenter.  Not much rice for 2 QUARTS of milk.  Should have been at least 3 cups of rice.  Usually rice pudding asks for 3/4 cup of rice for 2 cups of milk.

This is OUTSTANDING!  I've never tried rice pudding before, but gave this  a shot.  I actually liked the amount of sugar because I'm not the "sickening sweet" dessert type.  I ran a little short on milk, but the consistency was perfect & it gave me a good arm workout too!  It's great!

here is what I would change: up the rice to 2 cups. Add more sugar, 1/4 cup at a time until sweet to your taste. Only use 1/2 Tbsp cinnamon, and use 1 full Tbsp vanilla. I have made rice pudding many times before; but I couldn't find my usual recipe so I quickly printed this one off. Even with the changes I made I still thought it was a rather disapointing pudding. Rice pudding is not hard to make an usually delicious

I ended up doing 2/3 the original recipe, but I added a little extra rice, more like 2/3 c rather than 1/2. I didn't end up with extra liquid after that.

This is a great recipe! I vary this to utilize my leftover rice. Reduce the milk to 5 cups total and 2 cups leftover Jasmine rice, which I add the rice at the end after the milk has boiled. Yum!

We didn't have long grain rice so used regular white rice. We followed the milk measurement, but added a full cup of sugar AND doubled the amount of rice. We also used 1 teaspoon of Oriental Five Spice Powder and about 1 teaspoon ground cardomom. After working with it on the stove top, we poured it into a n oiled casserole and baked it for about 30 minutes at 375.

This is exactly what I was looking for.
Instead of uncooked rice I used left over coconut rice from dinner. Also, I used only about 1/4 the amount of milk, and added cornstarch to help thicken it up.

Excellent!  I took this into work, and they raved over it too.  Never having made rice pudding before, I had to be patient and have faith it would turn out.  Follow the directions and it will.

My husband asked me to make rice pudding. I picked this recipe. I have never made it before. He really like it except he said next time maybe 1/2 cup of raisins instead of the 3/4 cup. Thanks I will be making this again and again.

This turned out really well. I ended up making two batches. I substituted the sugar/second cup of milk with a 14 oz can of sweetened condensed milk....turned out great! I do think you could add a little more rice - i did a cup instead of 3/4...but it really comes down to how much creamy custard vs rice you want in your spoonful.

This is the 2nd time I made it, this time I followed the recipe exactly, except I ran out of milk and substituted half and half for the last cup of milk.   I was careful to follow the proportions exactly.  You really do have to use UNCOOKED rice to make this come out right and thick.  I don't add the cinnamon but pass the cinnamon and nutmeg shakers so people can have a choice.  Terrific either way.  I used jasmine rice and demerara sugar and everyone liked it.  I like it warm as well, quite a lot of it never gets to the refrigerator!

I am excited to try this, my husband loves rice pudding and he picked this one out , from all of them. I've read all the other comments - a little less milk, a little more sugar & cinnamon. I'm excited (oh and a little more rice too)....I have to change my rating of this pudding. I made it 2 days ago and it's gone! My husband asked for more and is even on his way to the store to get supplies! 2 C. milk (total), 1 C. rice, 1 C. sugar, up cin & van. looks runny at first but turns out great!

This was actually a fairly decent recipe. After it chilled it definitely needed to be mixed up a bit, because the way it settled there was a lot of milk on the bottom, but that's an easy fix. And personally, I added a bunch of cinnamon in it. It's too plain for me otherwise, but that's just my opinion. (:

This recipe is actually good when you meausre the things up correctly.  Never use that much milk with that little rice.  I used 3 cups of rice and measure 4 cups of milk, but i do eyeball it and add whatever I think it needs.  As long as it's thick with a little bit of milk visible, then it should be fine.  Also, reduce the eggs and dont add more milk when adding the final ingredients in.

This was really good, but I found that it worked better with a little more sugar (2/3 instead of 1/2) and medium grain rice. I also tried it with brown sugar and that was good too.

This is a great recipe!  However, I gave it a 4 star rating because I did not follow the recipe exactly.  I used the custard recipe with 2-day-old leftover chinese takeout rice.  

Some tips I could give:  1)DO NOT put the vanilla extract in while you heat the custard.  Add it after you turn off the heat. Otherwise it will taste bitter.  

2) Do not heat the custard quickly, otherwise you get scrambled eggs.  If you want to be extra careful, use a double boiler or a bowl over a pot of boiling water.  As soon as the custard can coat the back of the spoon, it is done.  

3)With my extra-dry rice, I made the amount in the recipe and then 30 minutes later I had to make another batch of custard and mix it in since the rice soaked it all in.  

Making it with the precooked rice made it much easier, just next time I use dry rice, I might soak it in some warm milk first.      

I hope I don't sound critical--it is a great, versitile recipe.  I'll definately keep it in my recipe box!  Thanks for sharing!

After reading the other reviews I increased the amount of rice and added cornstarch to help with the thickening. It did manage to thicken up but it took more than twice as long, more like 25 minutes instead of ten.

An excellant old fashioned recipe - this one is perfect if you are looking for something just like 'grandma used to make'.  I increased the sugar by another 1/4 cup because my family likes it a little sweeter and also decreased the milk incorporated into the egg mixture by 1/2 cup but really this one is perfect without any changes.

I made it w/o the whipped cream.  It was pretty good, but not great.  Not really worth the calories.  Surely it would have been better with the whipped cream on top.

The rice measurements are wrong. 2 quarts = 8 cups of milk,there you use 2 cups of rice. I had to add 1 cup of sugar vs 3/4, as for 3/4 of milk, I used 1 1/4 cup along with adding a dabble more of vanilla, cinnamon and touch of nutmeg and 1/2 stick of butter...the rice pudding was soo good, the whole pot was gone within an hour. It was only 4 of eating it :).

It was pretty good.  I think you could use a little less sugar and I'm not sure you need the butter.  Tried it with a sprinkle of cinnamon  then nutmeg.  Liked it either way.  Fruit topping would be good too.  It's a keeper.

I made it for Labor Day, since I love to eat sweet things after a big meal like a B.B.Q. I did make a few slight changes. For instance, I made the rice in the microwave before I mixed the liquid ingredients together  with the rice. It still came out very soft and creamy. Once the rice was cooked, I continued with the recipe as is, except for substituting the vanilla extract for pumpkin pie spice. Which is cinnamon with some allspice, and nutmeg already ground up and mixed. I also doubled the raisins, and half were regular the other half golden. I added about 1/3 cup half and half and 1 Tablespoon of starch to thinken the consistency, although I don’t think it reallyjj did too much difference , but I enjoy experimenting  with everything. Finally I garnished with some whipped  cream from the can around the edges.  And topped the top top with somebody extra apple pie seasoning. In conclusion I thought it was delicious, Thank you for sharing.

Tried this recipe 2x.  First, the way it is written - which was a total disaster. WAY to much milk for the rice measure.  The second time i tried half the milk - it came out much better but to eggy.  I think with some tweaking it has the potential to be a good, simple recipe but as its written - don't waste your ingredients.

Good recipe, & fabulous with a few changes I made! For a great rice pudding, always use short or medium grained rice. You'll get a much creamier pudding & a way better texture to the rice. The things I do differently are I use 1 1/4 c rice instead of 3/4 c, & so I increase the sugar to 1 c. Also, I always simmer the rice covered for 20 min instead of uncovered after bringing the milk to a boil. This works out better, trust me. After the 20 min, I uncover the pot & bring it up to a boil once again, then turn it back down to medium low. After 30-40 min, it'll be thickened up nicely (depends on your stove). Be sure to stir constantly so it doesn't stick! Plus, the more you stir, the more starch is released from the rice, which helps thicken it faster. The reviewers saying this is way too much milk should try these changes. As far as taste, I use a vanilla bean or vanilla extract (or sometimes both!), combined with a tsp. of almond extract, along with 2 Tbsp. of real butter & about 1/2 tsp of salt. This all makes a huge difference in the flavor!  I'm a total freak for this pudding, as it's my fave dessert, & I've tried tons of rice pudding recipes. The ones with more milk always work out better because when you refrigerate it, it gets much more solid. Also, I make this with Splenda instead of sugar often, & it's really fantastic. Nobody can tell the difference, even the hardcore sweetener haters in my family!

I used about 2 c precooked rice, added vanilla bean paste, pinch of cinnamon, dash of cardamom, used 1 1/2 c buttermilk and another cup of fat free milk.  Really good, cardamom is powerful.

Very tasty, and good consistency.

I made my rice in a rice cooker with Japanese short-grain rice. I didn't use raisins because I don't care of them, and didn't miss them in this dish!

Next time I might leave out the butter to reduce calories a bit because I tasted the dish before putting it in and it was still delicious.

Added more milk, vanilla and used Splenda for a sugar free treat.  I like Rice Pudding that's not so stiff and nice and creamy, so the extra milk really helped.

I made it for my wife who loves rice pudding, and she threatened to eat the whole thing in one sitting. I added extra rice ( increased to 1 c.) and held off the one cup of milk from the initial half gallon. I also increased the sugar to 2/3 c, and added a pinch of nutmeg. I'm not a rice pudding fan, due to the texture, but the flavor was great, and it setup very nicely.

Rich, firm n creamy, made one batch with dark chocolate added, changed brands of cinnamon to Kirkland (available at Costco Canada ) definitely a plus to the taste.

Not enough sugar in it. I added half a can of sweetened condensed milk.  It's yummy now that it is sweet enough.

For those of you that were not able to get the pudding to thicken up I am wondering what milk you used.  Meaning was the milk whole, 2%, 1%, or skim milk.  If you made this with 1% or skim I would not be surprised that it did not thicken up.  The first few times I made this I used 2% and it came out fine.  Using ¾ cup of rice is just fine it comes out thick.  Remember this is just a base recipe.  For me this recipe is bland so today I doctored it up.
1.	For the milk I used five cups whole milk, three cups half & half, and one cup heavy cream.  It may be higher on the calories but if you just eat a little at a time it is wonderful.
2.	While I was boiling the milk I put in one whole cinnamon stick for flavoring.
3.	In the milk I added 3 Tablespoons butter.
4.	I added one coup rice.
5.	In the egg mixture along with the ½ cup white sugar I added ½ cup light brown sugar.
6.	Also in the egg mixture I added ½ teaspoon all spice and ½ teaspoon nutmeg and 2 ½ teaspoons orange zest.
7.	I put 2/3 cup raisins in a small bowel and added just enough fresh squeezed orange juice to cover all the raisins.  I let the raisins sit in the fresh orange juice for six hours.
8.	I mixed the egg mixture and added it to the rice according to the recipe.

9. 9.	I added the raisin mixture just before the pudding started to boil.  Once it boiled I turned off the heat and let is sit for 10 minutes in the pot.
My wife is not a huge fan of rice pudding but she actually had a bowl.

I am a horrible cook and cooking rice is one of those art forms I have yet to master so I used boil in the bag instant rice,but other than stuck to the recipe. I was a little nervous before I put the egg in because it was still pretty watery but it thickned out and turned out super.creamy!

Very good recipe. I made two minor adjustments, as others did: increased rice to one cup (and it could go to 1-1/4) and increased sugar to 3/4 cup. Just minor adjustments for my taste. I'm sure the recipe "as is" is delicious as well. Thanks! Better than the leading store brand (more custard-like)! Be prepared to stand over the pot for quite a while, as frequent stirring is required as stated.

Bad recipe!! Total disaster. You must precook the rice and way too much milk to start off with. Also you need at least twice the amount of sugar.

This recipe is flawed. The ratio of milk to rice is not correct. To compensate, I used 2 cups of rice, with 1 cup of sugar, 2 tbs of vanila. The other ingredients I let stand. The result was a 6 qt pot of rice pudding!!!. It was good after tweeking, but I sent bowls and bowls  of it to friends!

This was so good, cooked up great using 1% milk instead of whole milk. After cooking I put it into my Slow Cooker, set to "keep warm" as I wanted a warm desert for the family after a day of sledding.

Love it!  Based on some of the reviews I added some extra rice, but I don't even know if that was necessary.  It was a hit with the whole family.and tasted exactly like the rice pudding I remember eating as a little girl.  I have started precooking the rice however.  I have mixed results using uncooked rice....  Sometimes the rice doesn't get soft.  This is a perfect use for leftover cooked rice.

This was absolutely yummy; rich and creamy. I didn't have raisins on hand so I had to omit them from the recipe, and I used a whole cup of sugar to make up for the difference in sweetness. My family loved it :)

My whole family loved this rice pudding!  I wanted to use up some left over steamed white rice from dinner the night before.  So I combined 1 cup of low fat milk with 2 cups of cold already cooked white rice in a medium sauce pan; warmed them on a medium heat while I combined the eggs, milk, sugar and vanilla.  Then I followed the rest of the recipe except I used an 8x8 pan.  Great recipe and very quick to make!

9 cups of milk to 3/4 cup of rice -  - 9 cups of milk for 6 servings of dessert - this is really only a custard recipe calling itself 'rice pudding'.  After adding 2 extra cups of cooked rice it is still just borderline as a rice pudding.

This is fantastic rice pudding!! I did have to cook it longer than the 10 minutes to thicken it but thats a minor problem.Its a hit with my family! TRY IT!!
