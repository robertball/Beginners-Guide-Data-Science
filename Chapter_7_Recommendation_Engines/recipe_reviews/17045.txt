I made this for a party I recently had and the crab snacks were a hit.  Everyone wanted the recipe and I loved them as much as everyone else did.

I found this recipe while looking for something to do with a can of crab meat.  I inspired a few changes since I didn't have everything on hand and made it on a smaller scale.  I used a small can of white crab meat, mixed it with 1 tablespoon mayo, 2 tablespoons butter, 1 cup of shredded 'cheddar jack' cheese, a little parmesan cheese and mashed it together into a spread.  I put a nice thick layer over a bagel half and sprinkled with the paprika.    I broiled them in a toaster oven for about ten minutes until they started bubbling.  They were delicious!!!  Looking at my quantity, you could make 4-6 bagel halves, which is quite a lot of snack for a decent sized family.  I'll definately make this again, the crab flavor was NOT lost in the ingredients.  Yummy!!! I've also submitted a picture.

I make these at every party that I host and they are always a hit! Try adding a little Old Bay (famous native seasoning made in Maryland) to the top of them after they are cooked- I like to use the sodium-free kind because the crab is a little salty by itself. If you are from Maryland, like me, you can't go wrong with these yummy treats!

I make these all the time but without the mayo and I recommend using butter (no margarine) and Old English cheese spread. They are ALWAYS a hit. I sometimes use bacon instead of crabmeat..... Yum

Super easy and delicious. Used whole wheat bagels, real cheese and a little less mayo to make the crab flavor a little more potent. The family loved these!

this is an excellant snack everyone will love. My brothers favorite.  you can freeze these, on baking sheet, then bag once they are frozed so they dont stick together. up broiling time to about 8 minutes (watch carefully ) then you have fancy snack ready to impress at anytime. ( I add a little garlic and use the canned crab as well)

I added some hot sauce and Dijon mustard. This was quite good in a home cooking sort of way, but I really don't think that I would serve this to company as an appetizer.

I cannot believe all the good reviews this recipe received!  We found that it overwhelming tasted like processed cheese and was very bland.  Too bad because we love crab.

These are a family favorite. At every gathering one of us will make the lusted after "crabbie"!!  My recipe is like this one, but with a spicy twist. I only use Old English cheese. I've tried other processed cheeses & they don't deliver the same punch. I use 1 package softened cream cheese in lieu of mayonnaise. I also add the juice of 1/2 a lemon, Tabasco & cayenne pepper to taste. I also recommend lightly toasting the english muffins before adding the crab topping. Lastly, I finish them off under the broiler for 30 seconds to 1 minute to create a light crust on top. Yum

My husband LOVED these. I'm not as big of a crab fan as he is, but I liked them, too. You can't really go wrong with all of that cheese!
