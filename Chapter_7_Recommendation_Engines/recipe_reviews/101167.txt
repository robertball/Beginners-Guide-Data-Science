the recipe needs to state that this is NOT clay for children to play with (unless you want a mess), it's more like fondant that can melt in your hands.  you mold it into things or you can actually cover a cake with it like I did (well, I covered part of it), I've mostly seen this molded into roses, I don't know what you'd do with sprinkles unless you're making a candy mound to eat

This is great stuff! I would nix the sprinkles (like the other reviewer, I can't imagine what you'd do with sprinkles.

I used white chocolate chips and gel food coloring to make Foofah on my Yo Gabba Gabba cake. Much easier to work with than fondant. Buddy on Cake Boss calls this Modeling Chocolate.

This product was very easy to work with. I think it might be similar to chocolate modeling recipes, but I haven't checked. I chose this particular recipe, because it gave about a 1 cup proportion and I was just wanting to try it out. I practiced with some roses to get a feel for it at first. Another recipe said to use cocoa for sticking. I didn't really have any problem with that except for on my hands just a tad but wetting my hands stopped that. I would like to try this using real white chocolate. I think the whitish flowers look so pretty. I had Nestle dark chocolate chips, in the house, so I used that. These would be very pretty on a plain chocolate cake. I had no idea what the sprinkles were for so I did not use them. I just wish the directions stated the best way to store this for later use or how long it will last? But, I guess I could just look that up.

I had a different experience than the other reviewers.  I made this exactly how the recipe stated but I wasn't able to work with it once it sat overnight.  It was hard and when I tried getting it off the plate it crumbled.

I tried this with Ghiradelli white chocolate chips but the corn syrup was too much.  It turned into a crumbly mess!  I tried it again using less syrup, adding the syrup in smaller amounts and mixing after each addition until I reached the right pliable consistency.  You may need to experiment since different brands/kinds of chocolate probably require less syrup.
