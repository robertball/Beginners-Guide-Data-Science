Well, I mostly drained the fat from the bacon before I added anything else.  That probably helped a bit.  The broth was sour, vinegary.  It was edible but neither my son nor I liked it.  It even ruined the taste of the spuds.  We ended up picking out the meat and eating it over rice.  I put a ton of hot sauce on mine to get it down because I couldn't stand the thought of wasting all of it.  Nothing was rotten.  It was the beer that did it.  Too much beer flavor.  I would do this again with a strong beef bullion base and maybe one bottle of beer.  I would also add thyme sprigs, soy sauce and celery as spices. It has potential.

I used beef broth in place of 1/2 of the ale. If I make again cut Worcestershire way back.
