Delicious! I made these in a slow cooker. I plugged in my slow cooker to heat up, put my soaked beans in the pressure cooker to cook, and in the meantime cut up the onion and garlic. All ingredients went into the cooker with a little water to get it mixed in nicely, then I added the beans once they came down from pressure. 4 hours on high should be enough but you can go longer to get a thicker consistency. I added salt near the end of cooking. My 5 year old ate a very large portion of these!

I wanted to make two different recipes over Memorial weekend using navy beans so I halved this recipe. The only change I made is that I cut back on the molasses because we do not like our beans overly sweet. Not sure we cared for the cinnamon in these but loved the apple cider vinegar. Seeing how I am not a Vegetarian, I will add cooked crumbled bacon to the top of each serving the next time I make these.
