The coconut flavor was too subtle to require the purchase of a whole can of coconut milk only to use a portion of it.  I replaced the coconut milk with an equal amount of additional creme; and, the result was actually a much better sauce.  Additionally, I increased the amount of Garam Masala used for dusting the Salmon Filets; next time I'll add a little bit of flour to make a crust on them.  This recipe is an excellent one and has become a family favorite.

Great recipe with lots of flavor. I followed the recipe and I used Thai Kitchen brand Premium coconut milk which maybe made the difference. Not sure what brand of coconut milk others used but the sauce I made had a nice flavor.

I made this with Tilapia fish steaks, and used Organic Coconut milk. The dish was awesome and so flavorful. I felt I was in an Indian restaurant with all the nice aromas! My husband loved it. It was so much sauce we needed bread to sop it up! YUM!! :) Will definitely do again.

This was very nice! I just couldn't bring myself to use an entire cup of butter, I used less than half and a full can of lite coconut milk (no cream). I ended up having to add a little cornstarch but it worked out just fine.

This was good.  Pretty easy too.  I cut down on the butter a little and it still worked.  I cut the recipe in half and only used 3 TBS butter.  I doubled the coconut milk though.  I've been wanting to try this recipe for a while and I'm glad I finally did.  Served with Matar Pulao (Rice with Peas) from this site.

I was a little disapppointed in this recipe.  I loved the idea, but it didn't exactly work out as planned.  I did enjoy the garam masala with the salmon - that part was delicious.  But the butter sauce was not good... perhaps my choice of white wine was not good, but that's all I could taste, and it overwhelmed any butter or coconut milk flavor.  I was only able to save the sauce by using a couple teaspoons of white sugar.  After that, we enjoyed it on the salmon, but I'm not sure we'll make this again.  Thanks for giving me an opportunity to use garam masala, though!

I thought it was pretty bland - could be because I'm Indian and thought this would have a lot of flavour with the garam masala but that wasn't the case.

Wow - this was divine.  I've been using this website for 4 months now and this was easily the best recipe I've tried.  I didn't change anything, it was delicious as is.  When I served this to my boyfriend he said it looked truly gourmet and after he ate it he said it is one of the best dishes he's ever eaten (I've cooked hundreds of meals for him and he's never said that before).  I served it with boiled new potatoes and sauteed green beans and poured the sauce over everything.  Also the sauce seems versatile, I believe it could be used with other fishes and even chicken, pork or lamb.  Thank you Ryan!

The idea of this sounded so good, but none of us were very impressed with this, we didn't think it was worth the work or expensive ingredients.  It was just disappointing for us.

This was very good. I substituted the cup of butter for natural yogurt and I also added a little brown sugar.  I mixed the garam masala with wholewheat flour for a crispy crust to the salmon.  Thanks, will make again

My whole family loved this! I served it over a bed of brown basmati rice to soak up the extra sauce. I also doubled the coconut milk as well. An excellent dish, truly restaurant quality...I will definitely be making this one again!

Very good.  Everyone like it, no one raved.  Might make again.  I would not make this with Salmon again...not good enough to justify the cost.  There are much better salmon recipes out there.  This may be good with another fish or chicken.

The seasoned salmon was delicious.  I had to remind myself that this is not a sauce, but a flavored butter.  As such, it is good, although a bit flat in flavor, and it is so buttery that I had to use it sparingly.  I will try to make a sauce of it, as others suggested, by reducing the amount of butter, increasing the coconut milk, and perhaps adding some yoghurt.  It is good idea for an Indian-type curry sauce that is quick, easy and versatile.

Really enjoyed this. I made it just as written, except that I doubled the coconut milk (as recommended by other reviewers) The only thing I might do differently next time is to quick sear the salmon on the stove top and then finish it off in the oven (just my preference)

I made this last week for some friends and everyone loved it. I made an Indian style rice pilaf and roasted some veggies along with the salmon. The sauce is really, really good.

I used Rainbow Trout instead of Salmon, and baked the Trout instead of searing it. But when i baked it, i forgot to rub it with garam masala. The sauce is really good, however, it took me about 20 min to reduce it. I also had to use some sugar and salt to add a bit of taste to the sauce. It was really great on the fish. We loved it.

I have made this recipe two times now, for the first time I followed it almost exactly, for the second time I made it with modifications and found it great. I would like to say, if you are looking for an authentic Indian recipe, this is not this. This is a good fusion recipe using Indian ingredients and French technique. My modifications: 1/2 cup coconut milk and 1/3 cup cream for more coconut flavor, I found the coconut flavor a little subtle with 1/3 cup. And I used just 1/3 cup butter and it was enough. 1 cup butter makes the sauce very fatty. The butter makes the sauce thick, but if you serve the sauce hot, the butter melts and the sauce won`t  be thick both with 1 and 1/3 cup. So I found no much difference how many butter you use. Overall, this is a good recipe with very interesting flavor.

Hmm, yummy. Despite of the alterations I made this recipe still turned out great. I used milk and the sauce was a bit runny but when drizzled on rice it was just fine. I didn't pan-fried the fish, but baked it instead. I'm going to have this dish again very soon.

Pretty good. My sauce turned out very runny, not sure if that is correct or not. But I would have preferred a thicker sauce. Boyfriend liked it as well. Probably won't be on heavy rotation, but I will probably make this again.

surprisingly easy and pretty good. i used lite coconut milk and a tablespoon less butter than the recipe called for, but otherwise followed the recipe completely. i wouldn't say it's what you'd get in an indian restaurant (not spicy enough) but certainly yummy.

This was ok.  This sauce wasn't my most favorite, but I enjoyed the Indian spices mingling with the salmon.  I might try this again without the wine next time.

What a unique and flavorful dish. A few pointers from me:
For those of you who reduced or eliminated the butter, a beurre blanc is a butter sauce. It's supposed to be buttery! If that's not to your liking, maybe try another recipe.
When seasoning your fish, check the ingredients in your garam masala first to see if there's salt in there before seasoning to taste. I didn't, and my fish was a little bit too salty.
Also, since this makes a fair amount of sauce, serve this with rice to soak it up. And you can use the rest of the opened can of coconut milk for part of the cooking liquid for your rice, so you don't wind up wasting it.

Overall a great recipe!

had  to add 1.5 teaspoons of sugar - too salty for me despite using the unsalted butter and like some others, used 1/2 the butter

I was stunned. My family loved the fish. My  older two children (aged 6 and 4) don't really like food with sauce so they didn't have any but my husband loved the sauce.  I made it with low fat coconut milk and just a little heavy cream and less butter than the recipe called for but I kept the amount of white wine the same. I did use delicious dry white wine which I also enjoyed drinking with the meal. My children (aged 6, 4 and 2) ate all of the fish and couldn't stop telling me how good it was. It was also something different made with real spices but it was not peppery as my children don't like hot food. I made the garam masala from scratch from the allrecipes recipe omitting the black pepper which didn't take any time at all.  I should also add that I used salmon that I had bought fresh but kept frozen in the deep freezer. I defrosted it while marinating in Shaw's (national groacery store brand) lemon and garlic marinade (a knock of Ken's) along with the juice of half a lemon prior to cooking along with a little kosher salt.  I also  squeezed the last bit of the half  of lemon's juice over the fish as I was cooking it. This dish was ready in 30-45 mins on a day when we arrived home late. The sauce also looks much better than in the picture.  My children have already asked me to make this again.

Made this recipe as written...absolutely yummy. Did garnish with fresh cilantro but that isn't changing the recipe.

It turned out to be wonderful! My husband says he is looking forward to it again soon since I made a whole batch of sauce and only two portions of salmon.

I loved this recipe!  Instead of using salmon, I used chicken.  I only used 1 tablespoon of garam masala on the chicken.  It looked like 2 tbs would be too much.  I also used salted butter rather than unsalted butter.  I ate mine with just regular frozen green peas and on rice.  I think next time, a nice yogurt drink would taste great w/ it and would make this recipe PERFECT!
