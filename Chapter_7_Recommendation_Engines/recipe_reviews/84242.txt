Really, I'd like to see reviews from folks who have tried recipes, instead of nitpicking about what one has chosen to name a recipe.  To be absolutely literal, schnitzel means "cutlet."  Traditional schnitzel is made of veal and is known as weiner schnitzel.  But, this recipe is accurately named, as it a recipe using cutlets.  I have also used a similar recipe to make what I call chicken schnitzel.

That said, this recipe is very good.  I did add a spice blend of salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder to the breading.  The whole family loved it.

This, in no way, is a traditional Schnitzel recipe. The traditional German recipe call for the use of pork, specially cut from the loin area. Schnitzel made from beef is nothing but breaded beef!

This is about as true a schnitzel recipe as I've seen in my German cookbooks. It's really good. It's even better if you tenderize the pork cutlets the day before and let them soak overnight in a mix of milk and egg in the fridge (just enough to cover the cutlets). They are much more moist and flavorful. We also like to top our schnitzel with both a strip of swiss and a strip of cheddar or american cheese, then stick them in a warmed oven for a few minutes to let the cheese melt. We picked this up from a friend who was born and raised German (entire family is still there). It's wonderful.

Some of you noted that this is like chicken-fried steak.  Chicken-fried steak is considered a Texas dish, BUT a lot of Germans emigrated to Texas. So chicken-fried steak is German Schnitzel, translated to American food products.  Mystery solved!

Tasty, although kind of bland, comfort-food. Sometimes... that is a nice change though, from always having so many different, spicier foods.  I found that 1 cup of flour & cornmeal and 3 eggs must be a 'typo' error. I wasted more than half of the dipping ingredients (and I doubled breaded). I made a sweet and sour sauce to dip into and served with mashed potatoes, green beans, fresh pineapple mixed in cottage cheese.

This was better than I expected. After the meat was brown, I drained the fat and  added 1/2 cup of broth. Before serving, I added the lemon juice to the pan juices and poured it over the steaks. I'll make it again.

I made with cubed pork steaks. I loved weiner schinitzel when I spent some time in Germany. We have been unable to duplicate the scrumptious breading that we had our first week there. I had forgotten about the lemon ... thank you so much for adding that into the recipe! I think next time I will use 1/2 c cornmeal and 1-1/2 cups flour. Thanks so much!

Schnitzel can be made usig a variety of meats,  Veal is excellent but expensive.  I use pork loin sliced about 1/2 inch thick and lightly pounded out to reduce thickness.  I then use bread crumbs for the crust.  Be careful when frying or you will burn the outside and taint the taste.

omit the cornmeal and you have chicken fried steak. Schnitzel means meat with crust, but is traditionally made with veal or pork.

My husband and I really liked this. I did not expect it to be as tender as it was. I did not really like the cornmeal texture in the breading though. The only things I did different was to add garlic powder and paprika to the flour and cornmeal mixture. I also made a mushroom and onion gravy to go over it and served it all with buttered pasta. Overall an excellent recipe. I don't care if the name is possibly wrong.

Pretty good!  Purists may scoff at the title, but I enjoyed using cube steak in a new way.  Thanks for the recipe!

We have schnitzel at least once a week in my house. since its hard to find veal in Alabama, using cube steaks sounds alot easier than using the thin pork chops and having to beat them even thinner like i do. I also use plain bread crumbs instead of flour and cornmeal (less messy). Im going to use cube steak next time...Thanks!!

Excellent recipe. The only thing I changed was I substituted boneless pork chops for the cube steaks. My husband raved and raved. He lived in Germany for 8 years and developed a serious addiction to schnitzels. This was very authentic. I'll definitely make it again.

I tried this with the cube steak.  It turned out good but didn't taste like schnitzel to us.   It reminded me of what my Grandmother from Arkansas used to make.  Probably will try it again with pork chops.  Thanks for posting.

Recipe as written, this is just so, so for me a little bland on flavor unless you count the lemon juice, and I did not think it worked well with the beef cube steak. I will look around for another recipe to use..
