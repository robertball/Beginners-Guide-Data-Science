WOW! THis recipe was soooo yummy and simple, even though the recipe has a few mistakes like "2 tablespoons eggs" its pretty obvious what it actually means, so no problem there :) I have already made it three times

These bars are easy to make and simply delicious! The only comment I would make is that the recipe is a bit confusing.  The list of ingredients says "2 tablespoons" eggs, and the directions don't say when to add the brown sugar and the nuts. So I used 2 eggs, added the brown sugar with the eggs and vanilla, and the nuts with the chocolate chips at the end. Chewy and yummy! Thanks!

These tasted great. However, if you are looking for something flavored butterscotch, this isn't the way to go. I cooked them for 3 extra minutes sucessfully. Also, the first time I followed the directions exactly with the butterscotch chips, but they turned out burnt. I then restarted and only cooked them for 1 minute 50 seconds.

These are super easy to make and very sweet!  They have a chewy texture, more like a brownie.  The batter is really smooth and it didn't look like it would fill the pan, but it worked great.  I think white chocolate chips would be a good addition.  I did not think raisins would be a good combo with the butterscotch so I skipped them.  Big hit with the kiddos!  Thanks.

This was a really easy recipe - and it was really good! It really is a 'throw-in-whatever-you-have' type recipe and I added chocolate chips and crushed pecans and it was delicious. I took previous reviewers' advice and cut the brown sugar in HALF, and it was perfect! TIPS: When melting butterscotch: Someone said they chucked it because it was curdled - don't chuck it! Just keep melting and stirring! It won't be smooth the way chocolate chips are when you melt them in the microwave. The butterscotch may look grainy, but don't worry, just keep stirring and melting in 30 second intervals. Once you mix in the eggs and vanilla extract, it'll become smooth and shiny. You'll be fine and you won't regret it!

This recipe was easy to make and was a hit over Christmas. They are at their very best once they've cooled, but keep them out of the fridge if you like them chewy!

These are very quick and easy! THe butterscotch and butter only needs 1:30-2:00 of microwaving time. Other than that it was awesome!

I found these a little sweet and a little chewy for my taste. However, my husband raved about them like you wouldn't believe! I took them to a dinner party and they were received well there too. I skipped the raisens and found that in my oven, 21 minutes was enough. Thanks for the recipe!

these were good cookie bars, but i was disappointed with the lack of butterscotch taste.  you could even smell it when they were done cooking, but i couldn't really taste it.  i left out the raisins but otherwise was true to the recipe.  good bars, just not what i was hoping for!

wow - I really "goofed" these up and they STILL turned out yummy. I didn't let the butterscotch chips cool much before I added the eggs and vanilla - didn't matter. I upped the amount of flour to a scant over a cup, cut the sugar in half (both as per advice from others), left out the nuts and added some quick oats instead for texture and poured into an 8x8 pan for a cakier result. oh yes - and the chocolate chips melted after I added them into the still-warm batter. I'm giving it 5 stars for its versatility. How many other recipes can you goof up so much and still have it turn out yummy?? I'm adding vanilla ice cream to it for dessert tonight - and a drizzle of caramel sauce to make it truly decadent.

These bars have great flavor, but were way too thin.  Next time I will either double the recipe for a 9x13 pan or put the regular recipe in 8x8 pan.  Also, they seemed to need a little more flour so I will be adding about 1/2 c. to the written recipe.  But, the butterscotch and chocolate flavor combo was a huge hit!

These turned out very well, and my kids especially liked them.  They are very sweet, so I cut them small and was able to get more than 18 small bars from the pan.  I did not use the walnuts or raisins since my kids don't care for them.

super yum yum! I used more butterscotch chips instead of chocolate, doubled the walnuts, and skipped the raisins.  If you use a toaster oven like me it doesn't take as long to bake, so keep an eye on it.

What went wrong? I have no idea. I gave two stars because it tasted delicious (although it was a bit too sweet if anything).
It came out as a sticky, floppy mess that I couldn't separate into neatly cut bars at all. So I ended up having to serve it more as a pudding in bowls. Thank goodness I lined the tray with grease-proof paper! I followed the recipe correctly, and think I would have had to change it quite a bit to get something that would hold together well. Won't be making it again.

These bars were really good, but they were too much of a pain for me to make again.  I followed the recipe exactly, but didn't add the walnuts or raisins because I didn't have any, and no one here is a raisin fan.  Yes, the butterscotch chips do 'curdle' when you microwave them, but since I saw that was supposed to happen from other reviewers I just went with it.  They are very hard to spread in the pan because they are so sticky and they are also very hard to remove from the pan.  I'd recommend lining the pan as well as spraying it.  They taste really good though...very sweet.

i'm looking at half the pan of these after making them today. my husband and i and our 2 guests loved them so much that we each had several. my only comments are that an 8"x11" dish worked great and that the needed cooking time in my oven was 35 mins. perfect!

I love the combo of easy and tasty!  I am not a raisin fan so I didn't even think to add them.  Instead I added 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 cup white chocolate chips (instead of the 1 c. all chocolate).  Great combo. I might try it with nuts too but it was great as is.

Great bar cookie! Still chewy and keeps very well in a tight container. I upped the flour to 1 cup, added 1/4c.ground flax seed and 1/2 c. oatmeal. I put it in a smaller pan and the thickness was perfect. Because I also thought it was too thin for a 9 x 13. I also put a mixture of choc chips, white choc chips, and butterscotch chips, right out of the oven. After melting, I swirled it and gave it a marbled effect. It looked festive.

I read the reviews before making. I ended up using 1 cup of flour, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1 cup of a mix of semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips, 1/2 cup of a mix of almonds and walnuts (I keep a mix for my oatmeal in mornings), and baked in an 8x8 pan. The bars came out sufficiently, but not too sweet, and a bit caky- just like we like. I would definitely make these again!

These were sweet and delicious.  Even my boys who don't like raisins just loved them and they were so easy to make!  The only thing that I changed was to decrease the sugar and since I'm not too crazy about nuts, I chopped them very fine so you still got the flavor and a little crunch, but were eating huge chunks of nuts.

I've made two batches now and my husband and neighbors are begging for more!  I used them on variety Christmas plates for friends and now they tell me just make the Butterscotch Cookie Bars next year.  I just might do that, I can't get enough of this wonderful stuff!!!

I like the idea of this butterscotch/choc/nutty cookie bar, but something is really missing. The bar was really sweet, but not in a good, flavorful way. These don't seem to be worth the calories to me.

I tried the recipe twice, and it didn't turn out at all.  When the butterscotch chips and butter were melted, the result was a curdled mess.  I threw it down the drain, and I won't attempt this one again.

Pretty easy recipe. I thought that they were maybe a little too sweet. My daughter loved them though. Do as it says and cut them while they are warm otherwise they are pretty hard to cut!

I used two eggs instead of one. I also folded the rest of the bag of butterscotch chips. They were delicious!

Big hit at my work's Christmas potluck!
Definitely going to make these again for friends so I don't eat them all myself.

This is a great, easy, tasty recipe that my kids and hubby loved. I substituted the butterscotch chips with caramel chips and it turned out good. AT first, i was nervous because the batter was really thick and not spreading well, but after I baked it, it looked good and was the right consistency.

very decadent moist bar cookie....I opted to use white chocolate chips instead of dark chocolate (personal preference), and upped flour to one cup as another reviewer suggested, otherwise followed recipe as written (minus optional raisins). I must caution others that a heavily greased pan still stuck on the bottom, especially on the edges, and recommend parchment paper lining for pan ( I was out, so chanced using just a heavily greased pan). Very yummy for a special treat!

tried this recipe and the taste was great . However the ease with which they are made is not . I used quality ingredients ,Hershey's chips both the butterscotch and semi-sweet and the butterscotch and melted butter never did become really smooth. I struggled through the rest of the recipe and even though my pan was well greased they were extremely hard to remove

I made this recipe two days ago exactly as written. It was slightly soft in the middle, crisp on top, and just lovely to eat. I resisted making another right after I had eaten it all. I enjoyed every morsel and will make this recipe again.

I am a big peanut butter girl, so I added half peanut butter chips and half butterscotch chips. I omitted the raisins as well.  Cut the brown sugar down to a half cup, and used 1/2 C. Walnuts, 1/2 C. pecans.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added another 1/2 C. flour because it seemed really odd to me that for a whole recipe of cookie bars it asks for only 3/4 C. flour. I did use 1 C of Nestle's Toll House semi sweet chocolate chips to.   I used an 8 x 8 glass pan.  This was really really good, something different!  And versatile.

Nah....as much of a allrecipes fan I am, this one def didn't do it for me. I'm a pretty accomplished cook, but the melting of the butterscotch & butter didn't work for me at ALL. I melted them slowly, stirring at intervals - and it ended up a yucky separated (almost scorched) mess. LOVE this website but this is one I'll take a pass on!

I love butterscotch and this was a wonderful treat. I have really high expectations when it comes to desserts and this one was fantastic. I only used 3/4 cups brown sugar since some of the reviews said it was on the sweet side and it was still really sweet. I added the rest of the bag of butterscotch chips in with the chocolate chips and walnuts. I did not use raisins.

I followed the recipe exactly until I found I had NO chocolate chips. I shaved two squares of baking chocolate, and added the rest of the butterscotch chips left from the small bag, added a cup of raisins and a cup of nuts. Oh, my! Heavenly Eating! I also used parchment paper to line the pan - the bars came out perfectly.

I wasn't sure what to expect, but they turned out so good! My husband finished the batch in two days! They might have been gone that night, but they are sugar-shock inducers. I was worried because my butterscotch/butter combo wasn't creamy, but when I started adding the other ingredients, the batter was smooth. I didn't add as many raisins (because I was unsure about the recipe) and I probably could have added them all. They were great!
