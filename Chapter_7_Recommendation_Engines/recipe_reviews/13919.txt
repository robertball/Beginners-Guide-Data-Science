Hmmmm. This one is a head scratcher. Like other reviewers said, it's not great and not terrible. The soy sauce isn't bad, so maybe cut back a little on the sugar. I can't really pinpoint why I didn't love these. I took a star off for flavor and one for presentation. After scoring the eggs, they kind of fall apart as you cut them (see photo...it was the best I could do). And the sauce looks kind of oily on the plate. I would cut back to just a few drops on that. Thanks for posting.

This recipe is a little strange.  The sauce is a good basic asian style sauce and has great flavor.  It would be great for stir fry.  It's simple and quick and tastes good.  It's just wierd with eggs that's all.

I haven't got much to say about this recipe.  I don't think I will try it again- it didn't turn out great and I certainly can't imagine anyone asking for the recipe.  It wasn't the worst thing I have ever tasted, but there certainly wasn't anything special about it.
