Very good. I used a can of cream of chiken soup and next time will also add a half to a whole can of cream of potato soup since i like my pot pies a little more gravy like on the inside.
I used peas instead of green beans and the whole family loved it. My youngest sister doesnt really like veggies, but she adored this pot pie! This will become a usual at my house.

I tried this recipe a couple days ago, and it tasted great! I did make a few modifications, but nothing really significant. I used frozen deep dish pie crusts, which must be rather small compared to a regular pie dish, because the ingredients here filled two of them. I also used diced russet potatoes in place of the green beans (at husband's request), and cream of mushroom soup, since I didn't have golden mushroom soup on hand. I will definitely make this again. Thank you!

This was extremely easy. I used ready made pie crusts and frozen mixed vegetables with carrots, corn, and green beans, and everything else exactly as directed. My husband and two teenage boys said it was really good. Thanks for the good recipe.

Really good, and so easy! My husband ate this 3 days in a row and couldnâ€™t get enough of it. I couldn't find the golden mushroom soup so I used cream of mushroom soup instead, was delicious.  This recipe is a great way to use leftovers during the colder months.

Very good and really easy!!  Bought a Tenderflake frozen double pie crust.  I should have brought the top pie shell to room temperature because it came out of the oven with a little funny bump on it. Other than that it was a big hit in the family.

This recipe is good - I didn't have the golden mushroom soup so I used cream of celery instead (it's all I had) and it was pretty good but I think it would have been MUCH better with the golden mushroom soup.  It didn't make a very saucy filling though   -  I think I would have liked just a little more sauce but if you are looking for comfort food this is definitely it!

This was excellent!  I accidentally doubled the carrots but I think it just made it that much sweeter.  Bonus:  the kids enjoyed an extra helping of vegetables without being any wiser.

I really liked how easy and quick this is to assemble. I used a can and a half of the soup, but other than that followed the directions exactly and it turned out very nicely.

Great recipe and super easy to make.  It was my first time making pot pie and it turned out perfect.  My husband who's starting to get sick of our leftover turkey really enjoyed this and even had seconds.  Doubling the soup made the filling a bit more soupy, which is just the way I like it.  I didn't have green beans on hand so I just added frozen peas instead.  Like another reviewer, I used a Tenderflake frozen pie crust.  This is delicious and I will be making it again throughout the year with chicken instead of turkey.

Fabulous go-to recipe!  It's easy to make, and is a perfect way to use up any leftover bird.  I use a bag of frozen peas and carrots instead of green beans and carrots, but I follow the rest pretty closely.  I'm not a big thyme fan so I cut that in half - personal preference though.  I'll be making this tonight and I can't wait.  Frozen pot pies are a thing of the past - you can't be satisfied with them after this. Oh!  I agree with another post that indicated that they use deep dish pie crusts and still have an abundance of filling - am I doing something wrong?  My pie always has a heaping mound :)

Great recipe! We fried a turkey for Christmas and it was still great. The turkey was a little more shredded then cubed and I used a can and a half of cream of mushroom soup. Next time we have leftover turkey, I am making this again!!!

This is a hit with my family of 4; including a 3 yo and a 9 yo!  I used the green beans with onions I made for Christmas dinner, and the carrots I made, as well. My husband really loved the "thick" consistency.  He was able to cut a slice without all the insides falling out.  This recipe is on our "to do" list after each turkey.

Thank you for a great and simple recipe for using turkey. I did add one medium potato, peeled and cubed small, boiled al dente and added with the veggies. I used frozen peas and carrots instead of green beans and added 1/8 tsp each of rubbed sage, oregano, white pepper. Also chopped small one jar of mushrooms. I also substituted white sauce instead of canned soup- double the normal recipe for white sauce and it is perfect. I used a convection oven for approx 50 minutes at 350 with the edges of pie covered entire time with foil. Also used disposable foil pie plate sprayed with PAM and it turned out perfectly cooked & easy to serve. Thanks to everyone for sharing their tips...it really helped!

I have made this two times now and my family loves it! I went with one of the other suggestions and used frozen mixed vegetables. I also changed the soup to cream of broccoli soup because we don't care for mushrooms. Definitely will become a staple at our home!

Instead of using condensed soup, I used homemade turkey gravy. I omitted the green beans and used leftover Gulliver's Corn, leftover from Thanksgiving. I also added just a touch of poultry seasoning. I used the Butter Flaky Pie Crust for the bottom layer and for the top crust, I used leftover mashed potatoes. (The Best Mashed Potatoes from this site.) My whole family inhaled this. I wish I would have gotten a picture but we were hungry! I'll make this again, with my changes. Excellent way to use up Thanksgiving leftovers in a new and unique way. I bet even using leftover stuffing as a top crust would be great, too!

I have been making this dish for almost a year now and it is the best pot pie I have ever had! I did not change a thing about it. I tried using a generic cream of mushroom once.. BIG mistake. It turned out extremely runny. Definitely stick to the name brands. I also make my own crusts which makes it more delicious and flaky. Definitely a keeper!

This was really good pot pie!  I used 3 cups of turkey (we still have leftovers), some leftover green beans and mushrooms, 1 med. potato (diced small, boil for 8-10 minutes and cooked with the veggies), 1/2 cup frozen peas and corn.  I sprinkled a little garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper on the veggies.  You definately need the golden mushroom soup, don't substitue with anything else.  That is what made this dish.  For the crust, I used a Pilsbury roll out crust.  Brush bottom crust with egg before filling, brush rest on top instead of milk before baking.  This was perfect for all the Thanksgiving leftovers.  We had stuffing and cranberry sauce as our sides.  I will try it with chicken during the year.  Definately a keeper!  Thanks for a great recipe. :-)

I made this last night and it was really good. I did add a can of cream of potato soup, like another review suggested. I think I might add a can of cream of chicken soup next time to make it even more creamy inside. I wasn't sure about using the golden mushroom soup, but it had really good flavor. I would make this again! Thanks!

Excellent use of leftover turkey from Thanksgiving!!  I was out of green beans, so I used potatoes instead; just cut them into bite sized cubes and saute them with the other veggies.  I also used both cream of mushroom and cream of potato.  The whole family loved it!

The pie crust definately needs to b pre-ccoked. I have made this twice. The first time I did not pre-cook the crust and it was soggy on the bottom. I used cream of mushroom versus golden mushroom soup because that is what I had on hand. Other than that, I didnt change a thing. This was a wonderful way to use up a lot of my Thanksgiving leftovers.

This recipe was very tasty! I used a can and a half of mushroom soup and as others said it still wasnt very "gravyish". But it was yummy and we enjoyed it. I also used a mixture of corn, peas, green beans and carrots because thats how my Husband and I like it. Will definitely be making it again.

Very good recipe! The whole family loved it. The only change I made was adding a can of cream of mushroom soup and a can of cream of chicken soup.

I followed the rec and it was pretty good. If I rate according to time to fix the pie or ingredients on hand I would give it 5. However I feel like it needs more seasonings to boost the flavors a little.

I made this excellent pie after Thanksgiving!  Along with some others, I used Cream of Mushroom soup in lieu of the Golden Mushroom soup.  Also, I only used a cup of frozen mixed peas and carrots.  It turned out GREAT!  The wife couldn't get enough!  We will definitely add this to our turkey Holidays!

I didn't use the Thyme and Pepper.  Instead I used Season Salt, 2 tso. Emeril's Essence, 3 tbsp. ap flour, 1/2 tsp. Oregano, and 1/2 tsp Marjoram.  I also didn't cook the green beans before adding them.  It turned out great!

I always make this recipe when I have leftover turkey.   I add a couple small cubed potatoes instead of the green beans and  add double the thyme, and add some salt and pepper to taste. I also like to add an extra can of condensed soup. Its a great meal that even my picky teen likes.

Awesome leftover use! I did not have a problem with my piecrust not getting done enough... but i always butter my pie pans so it helped crisp the bottom crust. i did use regular cream of mushroom as i dont tend to keep golden mushroom in the house and i also added a little poultry rub to the flour i tossed the turkey in... everyone loved it and hubby had seconds and already claimed the leftover leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

This was very very good. I made a few alterations, but doubt it changed the flavour much. Golden Mushroom soup is so hard to find so I used Cream of Mushroom instead. I used frozen mixed veggies and added a cup of diced potatoes. Instead of putting it all in one big pie ... I made 6 individual pot pies for my family. We will most certainly make this again and again!

I will make this again.. It was really good and I thought it was easy to make. I did add a small can of drained mushrooms and a can of drained french cut green beans instead of frozen cuz i didnt have it.. I also added a about a cup of light sour cream just because I had it on hand and wanted to use it up. Regardless of my alterations I would make it as recipe instructions and it would still be the bomb! good stuff probably one of my favorite recipes I have made on here!

I forgot to add the thyme and used a "white" sauce made with chicken stock instead of the soup (didn't have it) and this was still delicious.  Definitely a keeper.

What a great way to enjoy your holiday leftovers!  We served this to another couple and it was just enough for four and it was a great heartwarming pot pie.  I would recommend it for a cold night :)

I'm just learning to cook and I recently made this pot pie with left over turkey.  It was soo easy to make.  I added canned corn & canned string beans.  It turned out sooo good & my family loved it.

This is ok.  We weren't too wild about it so I doubt that I'll make it again.  The pot pie seems to be kind of dry.  And I even used a can of creamy chicken soup which was not in the recipe.  I did not eat it after the first day.  I would have had to make turkey gravy to add on top since it was so dry.

I used Turkey stock that I made from drippings and bones, and powdered milk instead of soup and it was a really good pot pie.

I used after-thanksgiving turkey. I don't know if it would be better with Christmas turkey but it was pretty darn good.

This recipe was really great!  I did take one of the recommendations and also added cream of potato soup.  I think next time I will also chop up some potato include.  All in all, we loved this recipe and can't wait to make it again!

My husband LOVES this recipe! I use cream of chicken soup instead of the mushroom, and instead of the frozen green beans I use up the leftover green bean casserole.  Turns out great!

Really yummy! I had to use cream of chicken soup, because that is what I had on hand. But otherwise I made this exactly as directed and it was WONDERFUL. My one year old was crazy about it, too!

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe and made 2 pies.  I used 1 can each of lowfat cream of mushroom and cream of chicken.  My husband and my 19 month old enjoyed it.  Will make it again for sure.
