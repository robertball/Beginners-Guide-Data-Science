One thing that this recipe is missing:  The searing!  Most recipes for roasts tell you to sear the meat (on a hot pan, high heat) before roasting it at 325.  That would make the meat moister and juicier.

I used a slow cooker with this recipe and it turned out great!  I boiled the potatoes for about 5 minutes, drained them and mixed them with the potato seasonings.  While the potatoes were boiling, I used the rub on the pork as the recipe instructed and then placed it in the slow cooker.  When the potatoes were ready, I set them on top and around the pork and tossed in a can of undrained french cut green beans and cooked everything on high for about 3 hours.  This dish puts out a wonderful aroma and is a great meal for family or guests!

Delicous!  This came out just perfect, moist and flavorful.  I bumped up the heat to 380 for the last half and the potatoes were nicely browned and the meat had a nice crust on it.  As I was adding the boiled potatoes, I tossed in some big slices of carrots and onion and seasoned it all together.  As the roast was resting I also stirred in a few handfulls of frozen peas for more color (the heat from the veggies warms them up just right).  I'm glad I let the meat rest for a while, it stayed so juicy after I cut into it.

As a side dish, I chopped up a few apples into a saucepan with 1/4 cup brown sugar and 2 tbsp lemon juice and let the whole mixture simmer for about 30 minutes.  The whole meal got rave reviews, both from my family and another couple that I made this for.  The only complaint was from my husband, who had to endure the tantalizing smells coming from the oven while he waited for it to be cooked!

i cook pork tenderloin almost evey week. i made this recipe last night and it resulted in the best and most tender tenderloin ever. i did drizzle a little seseme seed oil over the veggies.
one thing to remember is that the size of your meat cut will greatly effect the cooking time. i used one last night with a pop up timer. also always let this stand with a tent of foil after you remove it from the oven for about 20 minutes to let the juices settle.

Delicious!  My roast was 2 lbs. so I followed another reviewers suggestion and changed the time to 20/50 in order for the vegetables to cook thoroughly (I added baby carrots to the potatoes).  My whole family enjoyed this meal!

This recipe was fantastic!  I've been looking for a pork recipe that wasn't sweet and this one did the trick!
For those who complained of a dry roast, I HIGHLY recommenend a digital alarm thermometer that goes off when your pork reaches the right tempature, instead of setting a timer.  It is SO easy to overcook pork that this really is a life-saver.  Plus, don't forget to let the pork rest for 10 mintues or all of the juices will just run out the second you cut it.

As for the recipe itself, the only changes I made was that I used half red potatoes and half sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes.  Yum, yum, yum!  I will be making this on a regular basis.  Thanks for the great recipe!

EXCELLENT! I rubbed plain yellow mustard on the loin added the recipe's herbs, marinated it overnight---- have no fear... no mustard taste, but makes thee best marinade for tenderization. Then I added cabbage wedges, baby carrots, chopped apples all around the meat, and used about 1 cup apple juice mixed with 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 1 tablespoon yellow mustard, mixed well and poured over the meat and veggies, covered and cooked accordingly and basted about 3 times while roasting. Went well for New Year's Day dinner with a side of black eyed pea gumbo (also from this site) and homemade cornbread.

very flavorful and easy to make! I didn't make the potatoes, but I seasoned the meat with the ingredients listed, and the roast came out superb. The only thing I changed was I basted the roast with 1/2 cup of white wine while cooking. the pan juices were amazing!

This was a wonderful recipe for pork loin! Wow! We made this for dinner tonight. We were bowled over by it's juiciness and amazing flavor. I also put sliced garlic cloves in the top of the meat. YUM!! Thank you!

I was a bit disappointed in this recipe.  The flavor was wonderful, but the meat was dried out and I reduced the cooking time by about 15 minutes.  I do think that I will try this again and tinker with it....thanks though.

Very good and very easy.  I think that some reviewers may have had a pork tenderloin and not a pork loin.  There is a big difference in these two cuts of meats - a tenderloin cooks very quickly.  So almost 2 hours of cooking would ruin a tenderloin.

Made exxactly as written, except I didnt have chives, so left those off the potatoes. Had a 4.18lb roast, put on a rack in a 9 x 13 pan, cooking time was perfect! Just enough drippings to make a nice gravy. Added 1 cup cold water to drippings and a beef bullion cube. Heated that stove top until cube dissolved. Mixed 1/2 cup cold water with 2 tbsp corn starch and 1/8 tsp black pepper. Slowly added this to the broth mix and constantly stired to a boil. Added just a little extra salt and pepper to gravy after to taste. Hubby gave this a "perfect 10" as a dinner, and he very rarely hands out 10's for anything. Thanks for a great recipe!

Just wanted to add a "me too" to all the great reviews for this recipe. Couldn't be any easier; and couldn't be any better! I followed some of the other hints & suggestions and seared the roast first in hot vegetable oil. And, because my roast was a heavy 1.5 pounds, I did the 20/50 split, which worked wonderfully, except that I needed a little additional time on the back end to reach the 160 degrees internal temperature.  In addition to the potatoes, I also added chunked carrot, onion & orange pepper ... all delicious! Tossed the vegetables with olive oil, fresh chives, fresh parsley, dried thyme, salt & pepper. Also added a couple of dashes of sesame seed oil for more flavor. (Note: I omitted the garlic powder from both the roast & the vegetables as a personal choice.)  While the roast was resting under foil, I ran the oven up to 400 degrees and put the vegetables back in for some additional browning. (Yummy!!)  Roast & vegetables were unbelievable!! Pork was cooked perfectly, very moist and had great flavor. As we were cleaning up the kitchen, we discovered that the pork is even more delicious as it cooled to room temperature!  An instant favorite & an instant addition to the recipe box!

Very good, a simple, jet classic, comfort-food sort of recipe.  Used my slow cooker on low for 8 hours and the pork was tender and the potatoes just perfect.  There was enough juice to make a gravy.  Fantastic!

This is a fabulous recipe! I made it once before and must have just sprinkled the seasonings on for a "knock your socks off" flavor.  I couldn't find it today with my notes, so I found it online again and cooked according to the recipe.  It was very moist and delicious, but the flavor was too mild.  I ended up cutting the leftovers into chunks, adding more seasonings and searing in olive oil for hubby's lunch tomorrow.  I will not be losing this recipe again.    I mixed up a bunch of spices into a spice jar for future pork roasts.  If you like a lot of flavor, be sure to put it on thick when you put it in the oven.  Pork Roast Spice 3T Garlic Powder 3T Onion Powder 3T Thyme 1T Salt 1T Pepper  Potato spices were perfect.  I steamed them instead of boiling.  Probably for 12 minutes.  I used new red potatoes  Overview:  double the spices, steam potatoes = 5 stars!

I only had a 2lb. pork loin roast and a few potatoes so I scaled this for 4 servings. I did marinate my roast for about 6 hours in a mixture of white wine vinegar, olive oil, spicy brown mustard and a little honey. Otherwise I followed this recipe to a tee. I even had the fresh chives from my garden! Amazing how tasty the potatoes were. I confess my roast had a pop-up timer so it came out nice and juicy and moist and perfect. I did broil my potatoes while I let my roast rest, to give them brown edges, as another reviewer suggested. This was a great home cookin’, even Sunday quality, meal. I will make this again.

This was perfect - we had unexpected company last night and had three different kind of veggies leftover in the fridge.  Just made this exactly as submitted and reheated the veggies.  This pork was moist and delicious!  Now - all we have left after this meal is some pork and are they ever going to make great sandwiches!!!! I'm thinking - after work tomorrow - buy some fresh rye bread.  Put the pork on the bread, saute some onions, a little mayo and we are happy. Thanks submitter!!!
Update-Just made this again cooking the potatoes as suggested (I threw some carrots into the water too.  When I added the carrots and potatoes to the roasting pan I also added wedges of onions as others suggested.  This was really a quick and delicious meal.

I was looking for something to do with a boneless pork loin and came across this one which worked out even better since I had some mini red potatoes that needed to be used up!  So, I didn't boil my potatoes at all, just cut them in half and seasoned per the recipe, deciding to cook them right from the beginning.  All ingredients for me were halved since I had a small roast (1.5lbs or so).  I did spread a thin layer of whole grain dijon on the roast and then my herb mix (didn't have any onion powder left, so used some dried onion flakes - the powder would have been better).  Used my digital meat thermometer and poured a small amount of white wine in my pan.  This was tasty and not dried out at all, yummy!

Delicious recipe! The only thing I did differently was use 1 clove of chopped fresh garlic.  I poked some holes in the top of the meat and pushed a little garlic down into the holes.  Made the meat extra flavorful.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was Awsome!!  The meat came out very tender.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I did not peel the potatoes, and i cut the cook time to 30 min for the roast and then did 50 min with the potatoes.  My husband loved this and he usually does not like pork.  Will definiatly use again.

Wow, this was great.  Almost followed the recipe exactly.  My changes: 1. Didn't measure spices, simply used "enough".  Added Cumin to the rub and the veggies (because I like it on pork).
2.  Cooked the entire thing in a cast iron skillet, browning the roast first with a little bacon grease, then putting 2 slices of onion under each end to keep it off the bottom of the skillet. 
3. 20 minutes in a 350 oven, then added potatoes and carrots that had been microwaved in water for 10 minutes.
4. Roast took an additional 65 minutes to get up to 150, at which point I took it out to rest for 10 minutes, putting potatoes and carrots back in the oven.
5. Made a simple roux out of bacon drippings and flour, then added chicken stock, seasonings from roast, a little Chipolte powder, Worchestershire Sauce, Dijon mustard and a little lemon juice to make a mustard-y gravy.
Everyone raved. The cast iron particularly worked well on the vegetables, making them beautifuly carmelized.

This is a very simple and very tasty recipe! I followed the recipe, but seared the roast first. I also used turnip and carrot with the potatoes. Also, I didn't use chives because I was fresh out, so I used a little basil instead. It was a perfect meal, perfectly moist meat and full of flavour. I made a fat-free onion gravy with the meal, as well as a Maple Pecan Crumble for dessert. It was a perfect meal for a chilly fall day. Make this, you'll be happy you did.

Made this recipe for my family.  Everyone loved it.  The roast was very moist and the potatoes were excellent.  I didn't really measure any of the ingredients for the potatoes though.  Because they were boiled first for 10 minutes, I oiled and seasoned to taste. I used red skin potatoes with the skin on.

I made this last night and it's a keeper.  Changed the amount from serving 8 to serving 2. Couldn't find a 1 pound loin roast so I used a 1 lb. tenderloin instead.  This changed the cooking time for everything by about half.  25 minutes for the first stage and 25 minutes for the second.  It worked beautifully.

Some reviewers are confusing pork tenderloin with loin of pork. A tenderloin is small, up to 2 lbs. The loin is approximately 4 lbs. This makes a Huge difference! The tenderloin by definition is more tender! I found that the 4+ lb loin of pork i used required longer than 100 minutes so i increased the cooking time to 120 minutes. I also agree with other reviewers who suggested browning the loin prior to baking. However, if the loin has been marinated i don't think browning is necessary.

This came out very tasty and moist.  The potatoes did not come out as brown and crispy as I had hoped so next time I will put them in a little earlier.  The potatoes did have really good flavor though.

This was a great basic way to cook a pork roast, thank you! I omitted the thyme & chives because I didn't have any, but I added some Garlic & Onion sprinkle-seasoning of my own to both the roast and the potatoes and they turned out great! Only thing I would do different next time is to only have the potatoes in with the roast for the last 30 minutes. Maybe my roast was just taking forever, but by the time it was up to temp., the potatoes were way overdone.

This was awesome. Searing is an absolute must! Go easy on salt as other spices enhance it's salty flavor. Mine was a perfect 160 degrees after 55 minutes.

This was great.  I marinaded the roast for about 3 hours in 2 c cider, 2 T. Balsmic Vinegar Dressing, 2 T. salt.  I did with poatoes and carrots.  I basted the potatoes, carrots and pork approx every 10 min.  When I took the roast out to rest I turned the broiler on to crisp the potatoes.  Everything was yummy.  Plan on using the leftover pork for BBQ pork sandwiches and chili later in the week.

A tasty, comforting meal. I made gravy from the pan drippings after the roast came out of the oven. I only boiled the potatoes for 5 minutes then drained them in a colander and shook them around a bit to "scuff up" the surface of the potatoes. It makes them roast nice and crisp. I didn't think the potatoes lacked flavor at all, this is comfort food and if my grandma made it, salt and pepper is all she'd have used! With gravy, it's perfect.

The pork was moist and flavorful -- we had a 4.5 lb. roast and it was done after 50/45. We did use the pan drippings (skimmed of much of the fat) for an au jus -- so flavorful, and a shame to throw them out. The potatoes were not as good as I'd hoped. I was looking for something nice and crispy. these were moderately flavorful, but nothing terribly special.

To its credit, this recipe is quick, simple and would probably pass as a really good week-night meal (if you have the time to bake it) for most people!

So easy and so excellent. No gravy needed. The potatoes are wonderfully seasoned. Great with asparagus spears sauteed in a little butter.

Very good. My favorite way to roast a pork loin. Before I rub the pork loin with the spices I rub it with Dijon Mustard, just enough to coat it lightly then sprinkle generously with the seasonings. I don't measure I just sprinkle till it looks good. I do like the combination called for in this recipe. I cut up potato, carrot, celery and onion into bite size pieces thus eliminating the need to boil the potato first because the pieces are small enough to completely cook. Delicious and easy one pot meal.

as a non-pork eater, i'm relying on my husband and kid's reviews of this recipe.  midway through the first bite, hubby declared thisa 5-star!  my kids loved it, albeit drenched in ketchup, but they ate seconds which is a near miracle.  i added carrots with the potatoes and they were perfectly tender and really well seasoned.  the thyme was a new spice for me in a recipe like this, where i'm more accustomed to using rosemary - but it was very well received. plus it's super easy to throw this together.  thanks!

Had to replace fresh chives with dried parsley, otherwise followed recipe. Changed the order of directions to prepare loin and place in oven. Then boil potatoes and prepare to go in after first 50 min. The total roast cooking time is 1 hr., 40 min. Also add a cup of water to the pan to add moisture to the roast. Came out great! A keeper.

easy and very moist. i used a meat thermometer, but the bottom was a tad rare because i didn't stick the needle all the way down. i chopped potatoes about the size of golf balls and they were way overcooked after boiling for 10 mins. would be good with red potatoes too. and maybe boil carrots a few mins. i had a 2 lb pork loin and it took 75 mins total in the oven. my 3 year old actually ate it! she never eats meat.

This receipe was okay, but not great.  I cooked it for exatly one hour and then let it sit, tented, for 15 minutes as written.  Although cooked perfectly, the meat was a bit cool after 15 minutes.  I also found the outside of the meat to be a bit bland.  Maybe more spices?  Something sweeter?  More salt and pepper?  I'm not sure.... I will make this again using another reviewer's suggestion to sear the meat first, and then I'll add more varied spices.  A good starting point tho.

Great recipe. I used dried sage instead of rosemary and it was fantastic. I also brined the loin for 24 hours and it made all the difference. Served with young potatoes (baked along with the loin) with a port wine sauce. My husband is already asking for a re-do for when his parents come to visit.

I made this last night and it was excellent.  I did change it to our own tastes.  I left out the potatoes.  I also added some more herbs, 1/2 tsp of each: tarragon, oregano, thyme, sage, italian seasoning.  I also rubbed the pork loin with dijon mustard and then rubbed the herbs.  I seared the meat in an oven safe frying pan.  I added a 1/4 cup white wine and 2 tbs olive oil.  Cooked it as is.  Instead of the potatoes I put 1/2 thinly sliced onion.  After it was done cooking, I put the pork loin on a plate covered in tin foil for 10 minutes.  While that was resting added another 1/4 cup white wine into frying pan and cooked for a couple of minutes.  Family loved it!  Said I could make it anytime, especially when company comes over.

Wow, yummy!!  This was only my second pork loin ever, but it came out fantastic thanks to this recipe.  First of all, the aroma of it cooking is intoxicating.  The family kept asking when it would be ready.  I followed it exactly, but added the carrots and onion and increased the temp.for the second half as suggested in another review.  A great crisp outside and tender inside.  I second the recommendation for a meat thermometer!  I just relaxed with the newspaper until it beeped.

I thought the recipe tasted good. However, as is it really needed something extra. I ended up adding lemon pepper, some additional garlic powder and olive oil. One of the reviewers complained about the meat being dry. So, I kept foil on it the whole time. As a result it ended up being fork tender. I sliced it, but the seasonings did not seem to penetrate the meat. I added the additional seasonings and olive oil to the potatoes and meat and then put it under the broiler. After that it was much better. Just a lot of prep work and additional broiling. We will definitely eat it, just not a repeat recipe as a result.

Very good for a quick put together. I didn't measure all the spices, just poured them into the pan, mixed it and spread it over the bottom of the pan and rolled the meat in it to coat it, leaving the extra spices in the bottom. Then I made gravy with the pan drippings using 1 cup chicken broth, 1/2 cup white wine, salt and corn starch. Scraped the pan, poured it into a saucepan and mixed it all together. Delicious.

I made this tonight as printed, but I did brown the roast in my cast iron pan with a little olive oil then put in the oven in the same pan..   This came out great.  My wife commented on it was one of the best diners that I made.  (Makes wonder about the other 28 years of making stuff)

This was AMAZING. I made sure to rub all the seasonings on and then sear the pork loin before baking. I sprinkled a little extra seasoning over the meat when I added the potatoes. I also added peeled carrot chunks, onion wedges and celery chunks. The meat was super moist and tender...and very flavorful. My kids ((3 & 6)) ate 2 slices each!! WOW...we will definitely make this again!!

Very good.  Made without potatoes and accidently rubbed olive oil on the pork, but it turned out great.  Thanks for sharing.

Made this last night and it was the best pork loin I have ever made!  I didn't make the potatoes this time, but it amazed me how just those few spices could make such a difference.  It smelled sooooo good while it was cooking because of the garlic too!  Next time I will try it with the potatoes.

A family favorite! Since I found this recipe, my kids request it at least once a week. I make this recipe as it is written, except I prefer powdered sage instead of thyme.

Absolutely fantastic. I had a 2 lb roast and used the original amount of rub and followed the same cooking directions. My family and guest raved and my son took ALL the leftovers for lunch the next day. This is a DEFINITE keeper. Thanks for the submission.

I took the advice of another reviewer and added rosemary.  I used seasoning salt and a pinch of kosher salt. I also tripled the amount of thyme, garlic powder, and onion powder and rubbed all the seasoning on the roast. The roast was wonderful! Great taste and moist.

I made this for dinner tonight. Wow...what wonderful flavor. I did this in my electric skillet because I live in an RV and my oven is useless.  I browned it first on all four sides. Turned it down to 300 degrees and then added the potatoes. From here on I followed the recipe exactly except I added sweet potatoes with the white potatoes.. This is a super recipie and my DH and I loved it. Thank you for a wonderful recipe. This will be in our regular rotation...which is about every other month now with all the great recipes I've gottenfrom AR.  Thanks for brightening my horizon on Pork Loin...I am begining to love it!

this is one of our new favorites.  i usually skip the step of boiling and seasoning the potatoes, and they still turn out great.  the roast is always tender and the seasoning is great.  definitely a keeper.

I had taken a porktenderloin out this morning so when I received my daily recipe,  I jumped at the chance to try something new.  My family loved it, and the house smelled wonderful!  I did have to throw the potatoes in for another 10 minutes to brown them up.

This turned out wonderfully. Used potatoes, and carrots, on the recommendation of another user. Also cooked in a saute pan, I cooked onions and mushrooms which I added to the roast pan after it was done. This recipe went over very well with the family and made a wonderful amount of leftovers for lunches and dinners.

This pork loin turned out perfectly.  We are a family of 3 so I only used a 2 pound roast.  I seasoned it as suggested but used fresh thyme that I had on hand instead of dried.  Cooked it on low for 6 hours in my crockpot with about 1/4 cup of chicken broth added for moisture.  Served with baked sweet potatoes and stewed cabbage.  Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe.

PERFECT!!! I cooked this for my Father's Birthday dinner with a total of ten people. Everyone had seconds and even on the potatoes. I pulled the roast out of the oven at about 155 degrees allowing it to rise to 160 degrees during resting. It was very juicy and tender with wonderful flavor.

I made this recipe last night and it was amazing...    I love it, I love it, I love it...    and so did everybody else...   The pork was so tender and moist and flavorfull..   I did use a meat thermometer (just the one you can stick in the roast and leave in while it cooks) so it did end up being in there for almost 2 hour because we had a big piece.   And the potatoes were very very good.  I will certainly make this again  and for whenever we have company as well.

This was very good.  I didn't bother to boil the patatoes, I just cut them in smaller pieces and put them around the pork.  I have picky eaters and they all ate it.

A recipe I'll try again, with some modifications.  Biggest issue (and loss of one star) is that the roast was dry because it was smaller (1.9 lbs) and consequently overcooked.  Next time I'll start the potatoes first so if the meat is under 2 lbs I can time it 20/50 as I think the potatoes (& other veggies) need the full 50 min. to roast.  I wish I had read the reviews before, there are great suggestions.

Very simple, yummy dish!  We made a couple of modifications though - we seared the pork briefly before putting it in the oven, so the juices were sealed in.  We also seasoned our potatoes and baked them with the pork to add flavor, and also added carrots to the mix.  The last 15 minutes or so, we actually broiled the whole dish to give it a nice crispy outer layer.  This dish doesn't keep very well, as the pork tends to dry out - so eat this right away if you can!

this recipe was wonderful.  I didn't have any tyme so I used rosemary, basil and oregano instead.  I also used red potatoes which turned out wonderfully.  My kids loved this meal and said I better make this again and again. Thanks!

Wonderful! It was very hot, so I grilled covered at medium-high, 7 mins one side, turn and leave another 12 mins - turned out excellent and very moist. Started the potatoes going on a roasting pan on the top grill 10 mins before, then added the pork. Will definitely use again.

Not terrible but definitely not really fantastic either. My husband and son liked it though. I'd try it again with some tweaks and definitely some gravy.

I used a 2-lb pork tenderloin.  1 hr at 325 was perfect, even though I forgot to sear (I included the pre-boiled potatoes in that 1 hr).  This recipe's a good middle-of-the-road classic that most family members or guests would enjoy, but it didn't really knock my socks off enough for 5-stars.  Pork lends itself so well to some really delicious marinades that I would probably prefer to go that route in the future.

This was a great base recipe. I did sear it first and then cooked my 2lb roast for approx. 50 min. Because of this I put my parboiled potatoes (and carrots) in right at the beginning with the roast. I think it would have been better with some type of gravy though.

Good and tasty. Make sure you use a meat thermometer and take it out of the oven at 145* and let it rest for a while otherwise the roast will let all its juices go. If it rests it will retain its juiciness.

I usually never take the time to rate or review a recipe. However, after having this for dinner tonight, I felt that I needed to. This was the most moist and flavorful pork loin I have ever tasted. The cook time was PERFECT!  The potatoes were a perfect consistency of done and had a wonderful flavor as well. I did add a couple things with this recipe though. I added baby carrots, celery, and onions to the potatoes. I seared the pork loin on high heat for about 1 1/2 minutes on each side before baking. I also basted the pork loin three times while cooking with white wine. This was FANTASTIC, and I would definitely recommend to anyone... I served with green beans and corn on the cob for the kids. I would rate 10 stars if possible.. Thanks!!

There are so many pork loin recipes out there so I was torn which one to try. I decided on this one. Wow! My family LOVED it! I also added carrots (which made the meal!) I would HIGHLY recommend this to try! 5 Stars for sure.

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  Any changes I made were based on personal preference.  I think pork looks unappealing if it is not seared first, then baked.  Once seared, I placed it in to bake with an onion quartered.  I also made a sauce, their are members of my family that prefer the extra depth of flavor.  I made mine out of peaches and brandy.

This was easy and delicious. Didn't have garlic or onion powder, so I used fresh garlic and inserted slivers of it into slits in the pork loin.  Also added paprika because I like it. Didn't have chives, so omitted that. I quartered two medium onions, coated them in the same herb mix as the potatoes and put them in with the pork for the initial roasting, adding the parboiled potatoes later. Also, I seared the loin on all sides in olive oil after pressing the herbs on. As another reviewer mentioned, it's an important step to keeping the loin juicy.
Will definitely make this again.

Wonderful dish!!! I didn't have regular potatoes, so I used sweet potatoes instead. I also didn't have the chives. But it still came out great! My boyfriend loved it! 
I used a digital thermometer to keep on eye on the temperature. Pulled it out when it reached 160, let it rest about 10 mins, land it came out perfect! Extremely juicy!
This recipe is definitely a keeper, and next time I will try it with chives, but will probably stick with sweet potatoes.

We made this.  It's really good and fairly easy to make.  We found it to be dry, basically it needs gravy!  Next time I make it I will be making gravy to go with it, but beyond that I will definitely make it again!

Excellent Roast.  Very moist and flavorful.  I did sear on all sides before roasting and instead of an oven rack I cut up a large onion and rested the loin on that.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

This is a great recipe. The one change I made was to sear it on a grill first. The searing time was 4 minutes on each of 4 sides. This added a nice flavor to it.

Very plain tasting, I had hoped it would taste a lot better, it was definitely lacking in flavor even following the recipe. I had to cook it an hour longer than it called for, but it was juicy and would have tasted great with some extra twists. I may try it again in the future my own way.

AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!  I used this with a beef roast too and turned out great!  I add 16oz frozen green beans also.  I cooked in the crock pot for a couple hours w/ pre boiled potatoes.  To make a gravy I just took 1/4 cup heavy cream mixed with 2T corn starch and added all the juices from the crock pot and put on the stove to thicken. Delish!

This is a very easy and good recipe.  I marinated my pork loin in the rub for two days before baking. I did not boil the potatoes, but put them in the pan and let them roast with the meat.   It was to temp in 2 hours, then I let it rest for 20 minutes.  Incredibly juicy.  Some type of gravy would be good.

This was very flavorful and quick and easy to prepare.  I did pan sear it first, just thought I would try that, and I did add some water to the pan while baking, so maybe that helped it to stay moist.  (others mentioned dry)  I also followed the directions of letting it rest before cutting, so this also helps redistribute the juices.  Update: Today I didnt have time so I threw it in the crock pot.  Then we I got home, I boiled the tators and then threw those in the crockpot for maybe an hour.  This was so good, I was starving by the time I got home so this really hit the spot.

Wonderful loin recipe! I often get dry pork and this came out nice and moist. I was running short on time so cut my 4lb loin in half, roasted both for 25 minutes then went another 35 minutes (probably could have pulled it after 25-30 minutes but my thermometer is off) after adding the potatoes. Next time I'll probably put the potatoes in for the entire time to get more of a crisp on them. Easy peasy (:

My family absolutely loved this recipe and it will definitely be making a reappearance to our dinner table! Normally I modify recipes a bit but I hardly touched this one, other than a little rosemary - it was perfect as is! Also, I didn't have a roasting pan deep enough so I just cooked it in my Dutch oven on low heat for 3 hours! My husband's first comment was "wow, this is really tender"! Thanks for this recipe :-)

I made this tonight. Only differece was I seared the meat and when I boiled the potatoes I threw a few carrots and some celery in there. Also, I used different spices as we don't care for thyme. I used more garlic and onion. Served with some apple sauce and my familly loved it.

So divinely good, almost like comfort food. Everything had such good flavors! I used a 2 lb. boneless pork loin roast, 1/2 tsp salt & 1/4 tsp pepper on both the potatoes and the meat. This seemed to be just the right amount of salt & pepper. Didn't skimp on the garlic powder either, as we are big garlic lovers around here. Served this with a side of steamed fresh green beans...perfection!

I made this recipe exactly as given only I cooked mine in a slow cooker.  The roast was so moist and tender, but did not have alot of flavor.  I added exactly the amount of ingredents called for in the recipe and my roast was slightly smaller than the one called for in the recipe.  The potatoes were good tho.  My husband asked "did you season it"?  My anticipation was great, so I was a little disappointed in it.  My son (a great cook) said I should have added Kosher salt instead of regular and that would bring out the flavor more?

Best pork loin I have ever eaten.  I added carrots and and also a tsp of dried mustard to the rub.  Since I was using a 2.5 lb. loin I did the 20/50 that others mentioned.  Be sure to rest the meat before slicing.

This is so good. My family loved one of the reviewers ideas to serve it with apples simmered in brown sugar and lemon juice. It really accentuated the flavor of the pork and herbs.

One of the best roasted pork loins that I ever ate. I followed the recipe and added baby carrots in with the potatoes when I boiled them and I did sear the roast before putting it in the oven. Do not skip the last part, covering with foil when you take it out of the oven and let it sit 15 minutes before slicing. This roast was soo juicy!! Everyone enjoyed it and 4 lbs. of pork disappeared, no leftovers!!!

I broiled the potatoes while the pork was sitting as recomended and they turned out perfectly golden brown.  My boyfriend and his buddy devoured EVERYTHING and couldn't stop remarking at how juicy the pork was.  I will definately be making this over and over!

This was good although it came out a little dry/tough.  Of course this could have been the cut of meat (it was cleanly trimmed).  Next time I will definitely take the suggestions made by others and sear it before roasting.  The potatoes were fabulous!  I did make a couple of alterations to the potatoes - instead of using garlic powder I used 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic, substituted finely chopped green onions in place of the chives and added some parsley flakes to give it some color.

This was very good.. The only thing I changed is the Chives.. I didn't have any and didn't have time to get some so I used red onions chopped up pretty small... Everything tasted really good and like others said the house smelled really good. The only thing I would do different next time **besides getting chives** is to throw some carrots and green beans in w/ the potatoes like others suggested. This is definatly a keepers! THANKS! :)

This was a great recipe.  I added sliced carrots and fresh minced garlic to the potato mixture.  It was VERY tasty.  My husband took the leftovers to work the next day, and his co-workers (all construction guys) were pretty jealous of his lunch.  :)  Thanks!

This recipe is wonderful!  Instead of baking the potatoes, I boiled them on the stove, mashed them with a potato masher, and then added all the potato ingredients plus 1/4 c milk and 2 T butter.  This was much more moist than having them cook in the oven.

This was a hit with my husband.  I used a smaller roast and reduced cook time by only a few minutes.  Roast appeared dry but was very moist.  I was a little dissappointed in the taste of the potatoes but it may have been the olive oil I used that I wasn't that crazy about.  Will definitely make again!

This was really good, but nothing that brought a big "wow" to the table.  It still was very tasty, just a litle dry.  It's very easy to make, but my usual pork loin recipe yields a more moist roast.  Might try it again to see if it was perhaps the quality of loin on this one and not just the recipe.  Thanks!

I had a roast just under 2 lbs. It took 90 minutes to cook. It was moist and tender; both the pork and the potatoes were delicious. I'll make it again, and maybe add some carrots.

This recipe definitely deserves a five star rating. The meat was moist and delicious. I did make a few small additions. I added 1 teaspoon each of rubbed sage and rosemary to the pork rub and I added 4 thickly sliced carrots in with the potatoes. Fabulous!

Because there are just 2 if us I cut the ingredients but basically followed the recipe.  It came out really good and the roast was nice and juicy.  I used a 2.2 Boneless Pork Loin, 1 large sweet potato and 1 large baking potato and 1/2 bag of baby carrots.  In place of the thyme I used Italian Seasonings.  Seared the meat as others suggested then put it in a 9x13" pan, along with everything else.  Everything was done in 1 hr.

Few changes I made, doubled the spice and sauce recipe and added 1t cayenne pepper on the sauce and 1t shiracha for an extra spice, I added 1t onion salt too as per other reviewer's advice, baked for 30 minutes at 350F and then another 1 hr for 325 which is perfect for a 3 lb pork loin, drizzled the sauce on top before serving and I didn't even glaze on top! Thanks for this awesome recipe!

This recipe was delicious! I feel like it took me all day to cook but it was worth it. Per recommendations, I increased the temperature to 380 during the 2nd half of the cook time and also added cooked apples to the meal. The pork loin was super-juicy and the flavor was amazing. Totally worth cooking!

This was excellent, thanks for the great recipe!  I took another reviewers suggestion and added par-boiled carrots along with the potatoes, tossing them in the same marinade as the potatoes.  My cook time was longer than suggested, but my meat thermometer kept the end result perfect!  If you like your pork a little pink pull it out at about 148, as I did the rest time will move it to the appropriate level of pink.

I rarely do any cooking and chose this as a dish to prepare for my husband.  We both loved it.  When I cook it the 2nd time, I will check the loin once it is getting close to being done.  I think if I had kept a closer eye on it, it would have had more juice.  The potatoes were amazing.  If I can cook this...anyone can.  Super easy!

I thought this was incredible but none of my family cared for it.  I was so convinced it was Delicious, I gave the remainder of the meal to the man who sharpens my knives.  He & his wife absolutely loved it.  He sent me a note stating, "Fantastic!  Wonderful blend of seasonings!"  Spot on in my eyes!  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was the most flavorful, tender and juicy pork loin I have ever made.  And, the potatoes were amazing.  As a working Mom who tries to provide a home-cooked meal every night I found the cook time was a bit too long.  Instead, I increased the oven temp to 475 and only cooked it for 1 hour.  I think this is a new family favorite.

Another option of herbs would be fresh rosemary. I love how moist and lightly seasoned yet flavorful the pork is, with this recipe. Tks for sharing.

Pork roast is new for our family and my 9 year old and 13 year old loved the recipe. I followed the recipe with only a slight change by doubling the spices. We will definitely enjoy this again soon. I didn't think I could get my kids to eat potatoes without butter but they sure did and loved them too.

Seemed like it was lacking something....if I try again I will definitely add some white wine and more seasoning. The only change I made was added baby carrots when I added the potatoes.

This would have been great had I not overcooked it (too dry).  But besides my mistake this was awesome.

Thsi was one of the best pork recipes I have made. I reduced the cooking temp to 300 degrees and it was so moist. I also browned mine before I cooked it. Great recipe!

Very awesome recipe!! I have a very limited selection over here (Germany) so I used two 1 lb roasts, and took another user's review to cut the time down to 20/50.  Absolute perfect timing!! It was incredibly juicy, tender, and flavorful.  This will be going into our rotation/company dinner's immediately!

This recipe turned out great!  The pork was tender and flavorful and the potatoes had a bit of a crispy edge thanks to the olive oil.  All you need is a steamed veggie on the side to make the perfect weekend dinner (weekday if you have 2 1/2 hours to put dinner on the table).  Thanks for sharing!

This is so yummy and moist!  I followed the directions to a tee except I didn't parboil the potatoes.  Oops, should have.  They finished up quite nicely, though, while the pork loin rested.  I added some green beans and it was a beautiful dinner!  I will DEFINITELY make this again!

Good recipe. I used less oil, fresh garlic cloves and fresh herbs instead of dried or powder. I overcooked it a bit but it was still really good. I'll be making this again. :)

This was very good and fairly easy to put together. I have never parboiled potatoes before I roasted them with the meat, and was hesitant to do it now, but it worked out well. The potatoes were perfectly done & very tasty. The pork was perfectly seasoned. I did accidentally cook it to 170 instead of 160, but it was still moist and juicy. I took one reviewers advice and raised the temperature the last half to 380. That was why it reached 170 before I took it out of the oven. I will definitely not do that again.  My husband liked it so much that he came back four times for more. I had planned to get two meals out of the loin, but, it was so tasty that we did not leave enough for a second meal. It was good the next day when we had it for a snack, cold. The bottom line is that this is definitely a very good recipe and a keeper. I will not be looking for another recipe for pork loin any time soon. Of all the recipes I considered for Sunday dinner, I am glad I chose this one.

We loved this! My husband, who doesn't really like pork roast, said it was the best roast he has ever had and he had seconds and thirds! I did make a few slight changes - i added sweet potatoes to the red potatoes in the first step and after they were finished boiling, I added one onion to that mixture, put a ton of garlic pepper and sprayed with olive oil while waiting for the pork to cook its first 50 minutes. I then added the veggies to the pork roast and cooked the last 50 minutes. For the rub, I used garlic pepper, kosher salt, ground mustard and and onion seasoning. It was delicious and I will use again. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was ok, a little too heavy on spices, especially the thyme. The potatoes were ok, but not really worth the extra work. Probably won't make again.

Was okay but not excellent. Roast was moist. Next time I will use fresh herbs but that is personal preference. I am not sure why potatoes got such rave reviews. Were pretty ordinary to me. Nice change of pace though from mashed potatoes and gravy meal.

The best thing about this yummy recipe was the tip on the roasted potatoes... I've always just put them in with the pork and hoped for the best.  These were to die for!!!  I didn't do all the seasonings..just the oil and a sesoning mix.  Fantastic recipe...so easy.  I agree you need to carefully watch the pork during that last 1/2 hour 160  no more!!!!!  Yum!

This Roasted Pork Loin was just average.  It smelled wonderful while it was cooking, but we found it to be a bit salty, and somewhat dry.  I think if I had made gravy to go with it, we would have enjoyed it more.  I don't think I'll be making this one again.  Sorry!

We cooked this for the first time for a small dinner party and everyone loved it.  It was so flavorful and moist that everyone had to make a comment from the first bite.  Many of us had seconds, even though we were full, it was just too good to pass on.

This tasted super good! I didn't make the potatoes, though. I also cooked the meat about half the time, and monitored it with a thermometer. I let it rest as the recipe called for, and that is the key I think. 5 minutes for every pound of meat you have is the rule. I also added some dry mustard.
  I will make again. My husband couldn't get enough!

My husband really liked this recipe but I did not think it had enough flavor. The potatoes were very good but shouldn't be boiled for 10 minutes- make sure to check them after 5 minutes.

This is the best pork I've ever made - it's tender and juicy and reheats well for many great leftovers.  The only thing that could have been better are possibly more moist potatoes but they were tasty.

first things first. too much garlic for my taste, but 5 others liked it. my loin was 4 pds but was 5" in diameter so it took 3 hrs to cook. potatoes were too dry. i will not put them in the oven next time. always serve homemade applesauce with this. i cut slits around the meat to get the rub deep inside. it was not dry, but i am going to look for a recipe that will make some kind of juice. there were not dripings in the pan.

This was my first attempt to make a pork roast.  We liked this recipe pretty well though it won't become a regular.  It was very good though.

This was okay.  It turned out really dry and needed some kind of gravy to go along with it.  The preparation, however, was very easy.

Easy and delicious. My roast was small so I didn't cook as long.  It was moist and the potatoes were crispy on the outside and moist inside.  Definitely a keeper for a re-do!

The pork roast turned out well, but I didn't think that the seasoned potatoes were worth the extra step. I also added carrots and broiled the vegetables at the end for a crispier finish.

Fabulous! Meat was very moist and flavorful. Incredibly easy to make, as long as you think ahead enough to get it in the oven for the two hours of cooking. Even the World's Pickiest Eater liked it! This is a keeper.

This was wonderful!
I used both potatoes and carrots with it, and every bit of veggies was gone.  The meat was very good.  I used the meat thermometer to check doneness.  It was ready the first time I checked it, a hour and 15 minutes into the baking time.  So maybe I even overcooked it a bit. It was tender enought to cut with a fork.  Mmmm!

Easy, yummy.  I almost gave 5 stars.  The vegetables were GREAT. I added the parboiled carrots and onion quarters. The roast was very tasty (perhaps slightly dry hense the 4 stars).  Another time did vegetables par cooking carrots and potatoes in microwave, then tossing with zucchine, cauliflower and onions with the same spice mix and baked .5 hour in 400 oven.  Served with broiled salmon (with lemon pepper) and pear pecan and feta salad with basalmic dressing.  Meal fit for any company, beautiful and 12 weight watcher points.

This recipe was great just how it was, but it was even better with carrots. It was so juicy even after baking without a cover. I was suprised how great this turned out. My husband dont really like pork but he loved this dish. I reccommend everyone to try this one!

I made this with a 1# pork loin roast. Adjusting the serving size made the rest easy. I followed the advice of other reviews and adjusted the roasting time to 25/25, and used a meat thermometer. It only took 12 minutes during the second roasting time. The vegetables needed a little extra time, so I let the roast rest for 10 minutes while the vegetables (potatoes, carrots and onion) browned a little. Also, made gravy from the minimal pan drippings, 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 a beef bouillon cube, to deglaze the pan. Then added it to 1/2 Cup water, black pepper, and 1 T cornstarch. Tasty!

I used Pepper Jelly as the topping and made cuts across the top about 1” apart, for the Jelly to seep into the meat. I added carrots, cut in half, cooked the same as the potatoes and added to the sides on the rack, along with the potatoes.

We chose not to roast the potatoes with the pork loin due to time restrictions.   Next time, potatoes will be roasted, too.   This was a simple yet yummy dinner.

The recipe calls for a 4 lb. ROAST, not a tenderloin. If you make the recipe, as it is written, it will turn out fantastic - just as mine did!

I prepared a 4 lb pork loin butt following the recipe as written. The first 4 slices were amazing, my husband compared it to a good prime rib. After that the bone & fat got in the way. I got 2 cups of pulled pork from the remainder. Since the pork was on sale for $.99/lb, it was a good buy.

I used this recipe as a guideline, using many ideas from other reviews and came up with a very tasty result. I did find that any commercially prepared/packaged pork roast has way too much salt injected into it (12-15%!). I will not use any additional salt in future versions.

Flavor combination was great. Substituted green onions for the chives. Seared off in cast iron skillet before roasting in the same pan but the timing was spot on for the cook and the whole family loved it.

This was an awesome recipe. Our roast was flavorful and juicy. We followed the recipe to a "T" but we put in a thermometer while still setting the timer based on the recipe and the roast was ready 20 minutes short of the 50 minute time. I would strongly suggest using a timer because all ovens are different.

First time ever cooking a pork loin. Everyone is my household loved it! I cooked mine on a turkey rack in the pan, it worked out just fine.

I followed  the instructions here for the most part.  And I also took some tips from other reviewers.  I used a dijon mustard along with the recommended spices, and I didn't measure the spices at all, just poured them on and rubbed them on until it seemed good to me.   The good news is that this recipe is so flexible and easy that my pork loin (4.7 pounds) came out just perfect and tasty, and I keep going back to the fridge to snag another bite.  It is good hot, cold, or in between.  Yum. Yum. Yum.

The potato idea is  great one.  They didn't get as crispy as I would like, but they taste wonderful.  I would like to try try this recipe idea with some brussell sprouts in the bottom of the pan for the second half of the roast cook time.

I think I will definitely do this again.  This recipe took all the trouble out of cooking a pork loin.  It was simple and beautiful.

I bought a pre seasoned pork loin, but I used the out line for baking it and it turned out flawless... Boiled the potatoes with a little seasoning, and it was really yummy. I will definitely be using this outline for fixing pork loin again!

SUPER way to use your Thyme! ;)  As others suggested I added baby carrots (1#) to the pan. I always put slivers of garlic all through the roast into little slits.(It's an historic preservation of growing up; Sunday, family meals) We also love onions, so cut 2 large up into thick slices & placed under the roast, too.
All of the veg. we're gone first! Not commonplace in my house. The leftover meat was sliced and dredged in the oil & juices, reheated on the stove top,for sandwiches that were TO DIE FOR! 
Thanks so very much for the ideas that were in this recipe. What a beautiful drawing board!!

I actually used another roast pork loin recipe from this site, and made the potatoes from this recipe and they were AWESOME!! Best potatoes I ever made! I microwaved 4 potatoes for 8 minutes then put them in the dish w/ the loin for the last 75 minutes. The oven temp was 325. Delicious!!!!

I just did the potatoes and changed a few things. First I used yukon gold potatoes and left the skin on. I also used fresh thyme from my garden.  Then baked them on a cookie sheet separate from the roast. My family loved them and said I should have made more. I have never seen something go so quickly.

I used an actual 4 lb pork loin as was called for, not tenderloin. The cooking time was about 45 minutes too long. I cut it back about 20 minutes, but I thought it was dry. I made a gravy with cornstarch from the drippings. My guests and hubby thought it was delicious. Must be a guy thing to like overcooked pork. The 4 stars are only because of the cooking time - the flavor was great.

This was a real success when I made it for company.   I followed the recipe as written, but was generous in my spice and herb measurements. Everyone enjoyed the fact that the spice mix had flavoured the meat all through, and not just on the outside I found the pan difficult to clean afterwards, from where the drippings had burned on a bit, and will line it with foil next time.

Ok other then the fact I seriously cannot make any meat juicy, not sure why. When I cut the porkloin you could SEE the juice coming out but when you eat it it was dry. But that did not affect the taste. This was YUMMY! I added some rosemary to the red potatoes. Will make again!

I made this for dinner tonight, and I wasn"t happy with how it turned out.  Unfortunately, it was not the moist, succulent pork dish I hoped it would be. The flavor wasn't bad, but the pork was dry. Fortunately, there were enough drippings to make a pan gravy, so it was edible.

Very moist and yummy! I didn't have chives, but I used yellow onions and baby carrots to compliment the potatoes. Once I added the potato mix to the pan, I only cooked it for 25 minutes and it was perfect! At 175 degrees internal temperature.

I over cooked the pork, it was dry.  I took it out at 170.  Put the potatoes back in over for 15 mins at 400 and they were nice and brown.  Good dinner but next time i would take the meat out earlier. Very lean piece of meat, dries out quickly.

Like another reviewer I slathered the loin in yellow mustard and spices to let it marinate.  I seered the loin in hot oil on all sides and placed in a stoneware covered baking dish.  I tossed the (unpeeled red) potatoes w/ the spices and didn't boil--I just placed them in the dish w/ the loin.  I baked @ 225 for 6 hours, although it was probably a bit overcooked and should have checked @ 4-5 hours.  VERY tender nonetheless; meat shredded apart easily, it was juicy, and leftovers were still great the next day.

I prepared this for the first time over the weekend, using a boston butt pork roast.  In addition to the potatoes, I added carrots and onions.  Also, I added Tony's cajun seasoning to the spices for the rub.  It was delicious!  And oh, so easy!

I had high hopes for this.  It was good but not great.  The potatoes turned out super yummy and crisp, but the pork was dry with a capital D. Since this is a pork recipe I gave it 2 stars.  I thought it did retain the flavor though. Maybe some type of gravy  would help. I am not cooking this one again.

It was sooooo good!!!! The only change i made was that I had a smaller roast, so I roasted my potatoes at the same time w/out preboiling them! Soooo yummy!

I used a 2 pound pork loin since it was only two of us and halved everything except the last 50 min and it came out dry.  BF didn't care for it and it was okay for me, it would have been better with a gravy or sauce of some sorts. Oh well, not a hit in this house.

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  I had high hopes for it when I first saw it, but I made it last night for my husband and me. The flavor was good and it made the house smell good, but it was tough, even though I had a good cut of meat.  I won't make it again.

This was excellent!  I used sweet potatoes and they were absolutely mouth-watering.  Made this twice now with great results both times- even for picky eaters!

My family enjoyed this.  Very easy to prepare and stick in the oven while you do other stuff.  I served with green beans and garlic bread for a great meal.  Thanks for this easy meal!

Very good, very moist.  It didn't take quite as long as I thought, but didn't dry out either.  I did add a little spice to the rub since we like spicy foods.

I cooked this recipe exactly as written and found it to be a little dry.  I added carrots to the veggies and I have to say that both the carrots and the potatoes were yummy!  I was a little disappointed even though my husband thought it was okay.

I really liked the potatoes but the flavor of the roast was not anything special.  My fiance did not like it at all.  I did not have chives, so they were left out.  I don't think I like them anyway.

This was a snap!  I had an already marinated pork loin, however I followed the instructions for baking as well as the potatoes.  Everyone loved it.  My six year old was hesitant to try something new and said it was the best meal he's ever had!  The potatoes were yummy and I threw in some carrots too!  This is a deliously, easy recipe and one I will continue to use!

I made this without the potatoes and it was boring.  A simple marinade for an hour would have had more flavor.

I rate this recipe 3 stars because I found it a bit bland; there was just no "WOW" factor.  I follwed the directions for the most part - although I did cut the recipe in half as I only had a 1.5 lb roast.  All in all, there was nothing wrong with this dish, there are just a number of pork roast recipes that I prefer.

This was delicious. I have 2 very very picky eaters and they both approved....cleaned their plates.  I will definitely cook this again because my guys are beef men and I'm trying to work more white meat into our diets. This was perfect-it was easy and yummy.  However, I did add a 1 1/2 cup of chicken broth; next time I will add 2 cups of broth.

The only changes I made were to reduce the amount of garlic powder on the roast to a little over 1/2 a teaspoon - and I accidently forgot to put the fresh chives in with the potatoes when I tossed them with the rest of the items, so I sprinkled them on top of the roast and potatoes immediately before serving!  Served it with squash and a salad and it received excellent reviews from our guests! Thanks much "Mom2wildchild".

This had a very good flavor to it.  It was just a bit dry, but still very good.  It made enough for leftovers and was just as good reheated.  This is something that I would definately make again.

We enjoyed this dish.  My roast was smaller (2.5lb), so it took less time in the oven.  I think the potatoes suffered since they were in the oven less time (not roasted-crispy), but I didn't want to overcook them.
