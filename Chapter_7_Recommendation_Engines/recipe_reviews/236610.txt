Very flavourful, but the potatoes were still hard.  I think I would cook on high for the first two hours.

Did not add any flour as I prefer it to be gluten free, added 35% fat cooking cream when it was ready.  I wanted it with cheese topping;  transferred chowder into 1 portion casseroles,  topped with 4 types of cheeses and baked it at 425F for 10  minutes until golden brown. It was very hot and so yummy, just what we like for cold wintery months.

My first attempt at making potato and leek chowder and it is fantastic! I followed the recipe and didn't make any changes and it was delish as is.

This is one of the best leek and potato soup/chowder recipes I've tasted!  My family loves this-especially when I serve it with warm, crusty french bread!

Delicious! I think I cut my potatoes too large because I had to cook it longer. I loved this soup and will definitely make it again!

Made this mostly by the recipe, and it came out really good. I added a little red sweet pepper for color and spiced it with arbitrary amounts of salt, pepper, paprika, cayenne, and just a little oregano.

Really, really, good soup!  And super easy too.   We're vegetarian, so we used vegetable broth instead of chicken, and just omitted the bacon.  It still had plenty of flavor and turned out great.  Perfect for a cool fall night.  I'll definitely make this again!
