Used more like Â½ - 1 tsp herbs de provence and omitted spinach. It was ok... a bit bland. I felt like as a sandwich it was too much bread. I liked it better served open faced. Maybe a little onion or capers would bring it to life.

I'm always looking for new ways to use all the salmon we get. This one was unique. It was good. I might try it next time as a triple decker. Another thought is to add a Monte-Cristo twist and use some kind of preserves (I'm thinking apple might be best).

This was very good. I had never had smoked salmon before and picked this recipe to try it. I liked this best when I had warmed the salmon up in the microwave a bit rather than cold or room temp..and I liked this best with the herbs de provence rather than the italian seasoning.
