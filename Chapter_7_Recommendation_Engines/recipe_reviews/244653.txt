I try not to rate recipes when I've modified them significantly from the original. That said, I did make a couple changes, by necessity. I had some spinach to use up, but had no kale on hand, so swapped spinach for kale. Didn't have fresh thyme, so I used dry. I am not a fan of chevre. That said, I had some in the fridge that I needed to use up, which is why I chose this particular butternut squash soup recipe. As it turns out, I actually really liked how the chevre tasted in this soup! I'm sure the candied bacon would be lovely, but I didn't have bacon, and honestly, the soup was wonderful just as it was. Will definitely make this again!

This soup turned out sooo good! I made a few changes... I added 2 cloves of garlic because why not? I used only 1 (big) onion and also added to the baking dish one chopped celeriac, because I had it sitting around. It added such nice flavor! I did not have bacon so I didn't use any and it still turned out super tasty. I didn't know how to define "1 medium butternut squash" so I used about 1kg (2lbs) and it was the perfect amount. Luckily I also had kale for that extra bit of fiber and nutrition. Yum!

Delicious. I did modify just slightly, I left out the kale because I didn't see the point in this type of soup and instead of maple sugar I tossed my bacon in maple syrup and brown sugar and candied them in the oven. my food processor died so my soup ended up being chunkier than I wanted but the flavor on this was so so good. I also roast my butternut squash in the oven first.

Let’s just say wow. Amazing soup. Not usually a fan of butternut squash but I love goat cheese so I decided to try it out. So happy I did. My grandpa always loads me up with butternut squash from the garden and now I have my go to dish to make it. The only thing I really do different is add a little heavy cream. So thankful you shared this wonderful recipe

Love this soup!  It took longer for me to roast the squash and onion. And I needed the food processor to blend the ingredients — my handheld was never going to handle blending this smooth.

My family did not like this at all. Goat cheese was too strong, not enough bacon, and we don't particularly like greens to start with. Won't be making it again.

So delicious!  I had to substitute spinach for kale but my family absolutely loved it!
