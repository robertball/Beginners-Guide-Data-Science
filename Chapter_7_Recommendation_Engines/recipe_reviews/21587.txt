This was definitely the hit of my party.  I sliced all but 3 small apples of a 3 lb. bag and every apple was gone the the bowl licked clean.  I was worried it was going to be too sweet but went ahead and added all the sugar anyway.  It was perfect!  I wanted to have all the food prep work done hours before the party so to keep the sliced apples from browning I put them in a bowl of about 4 cups of water and 1/4 cup lemon juice and kept them in the fridge.  Right before I was ready to serve them I drained them and served them on a large platter with the dip in the middle.  The last apple was as white as when I first served it.

Scrumptious!  I love caramel apples but they can be a little hard to eat (not something you would serve at a party).  SOLUTION: the flavor of this recipe is very close to caramel apples, but it is easy to make and easy to serve to a group.   Suggestions:  1. add extra caramels for added caramel flavor.  2.  be sure to melt the caramels completely to avoid clumps.  3.  submerge apple slices in orange or lemon juice to prevent browning.  4.  I prefer to use tart apples, like Granny Smith to balance out the sweetness and enhance the caramel flavor.  5.  The dip refrigerates well.   Enjoy!  A perfect Autumn treat.

I've tried the caramel dip with cream cheese/brown sugar/vanilla.  Adults love it.

Even my 4-year-old son loves this one.  The addition of actual caramel makes this 
a dip nobody can resist.  Brought it to a party last night.  People were trying it 
with EVERYTHING.  Grapes, Brie, apples, bananas . . . Thick, sticky, sumptuous.  

I didn't put in quite as much water, and added vanilla.  Refrigerates well. 
Thickens a bit, but still very spreadable and dippable.  This will be a tradition
for our family through the holidays.

This stuff is AWESOME!  And super easy too! I will use it for all my get togethers now.  Oh, one thing about the recipe though, it says to serve immediately, so I waited until the last minute to make it.  I now know though, that it keeps in the fridge for a day or two just fine, with no change in flavor or consistancy.

Fabulous! I used fat free cream cheese, just to cut down a little on fat/calories, and I don't think it affected the taste at all. Took it to a youth group New Year's party and when it was gone I actually caught some of them scraping their fingers around the inside of the bowl to get the scraps!

This was excellent!!  I took it to a party and nobody could stop eating it.  People were scooping so much dip that it covered the apple slices!  After I made it, I put it in the fridge and served it straight from the fridge.  It was still soft and easy to dip into.  I added extra caramels, but I don't think that it altered the recipe too much.  You will not be disappointed by this recipe, but don't make it is you're trying to cut back on calories! :)

Super easy to make, and keeps well too.  Head and shoulders above the commercial stuff.  People always rave about this dip, and it's perfect for the fresh autumn apples.  I add a little vanilla as was recommended by a previous reviewer.

I made this for a reunion and it was a big hit.  I, too, used the entire bag of caramels because I am not a big fan of the taste of cream cheese.  I followed the recs of prior reviewers and used full fat cream cheese.  I served w/granny smith apple slices, Nilla wafers, and chocolate.  I used lemon juice to keep the apples from browning.  This dip is good at any temp, warm, room, and cold.  I will make this again.

I made this exactly as stated. Only I threw in about 5 more caramels! YUMMY!!! (very sweet - but not too sweet) I served with gala and granny smith apples, which by the way I learned a trick to keep from browning on my way to my destination and it worked WONDERFULLY! I cut apples under running water (read this somewhere - not sure if this step actually helped) and then placed the slices in Sprite - after cutting all apples - drained and put into gallon ziplock baggie and removed all air and zipped - hours later - my apples look like I just cut them!! :-)

Instead of the caramels, use peanut butter.  1 cup peanut butter.  1 cup brown sugar.  8 oz cream cheese and 1/4 cup milk.  I am addicted!  Its way easier and tastes better than using caramels.  Maybe a little more healthy too?

yum. under 5 ingredients and fast! so delicious! my mix is chilling in the fridge right now. this is so versatile! this recipe has earned a spot in my own book! thanks! i hate buying prepackaged items, and with this being so simple and easy, why not make your own?! WOW! bananas are THE BEST to be dipped in my opinion. next time i'm going to use fat free cream cheese instead of the 1/3 less fat to save even more calories! this will be used OFTEN!!!! UPDATE: i used the fat free cream cheese, and it turned out very runny!!! i will stick with at least the 1/3 fat. still a great consistency without full fat!

I guess I'm in the minority here because I didn't care for this at all. Not only did I find this to be mediocre when eaten immediately (warm) as suggested, I thought this tasted WORSE after sitting in the fridge overnight. My dip is now barely spreadable. :( When I scoop it, I end up with globs that barely coat my apple slices. I also found the caramel flavor to be nonexistent. As is, this dip has a STRONG cream cheese taste with just a *slight* hint of caramel flavor (more like an afterthought, IMHO). I DEFINITELY suggest adding MORE caramel candies than called for. Maybe this will float your boat, but it sure didn't do anything for me. Thanks anyways, Lori. :-)

Lori, this is AWSOME!  Thanks!  The carmel and cream cheese together.... mmmmm!  What a combination!  This is definately a keeper.  A great dip for fall parties and get togethers.  My picky 7 year old daughter went crazy over this one!

I added a splash of vanilla and didn't bother with folding in the caramel - just used a handmixer to whip it together.  Next time I'll add a bit less water to the caramels that is recommended and might add some cinnamon or nutmeg for a bit of spice.  Sinful as one friend described it!

this was super easy super tasty. I cut up about 6 or 7 granny smith apples and (based on another reviewer's tip) put them into a container with about 4 cups of water, 1/4 cup lemon juice (from the bottle) and a splash of OJ. I had them in the fridge that way for maybe an hour then I took a slice out and left it out to see how quickly it would brown. It was nearly 3 hours before it showed even hint of browning. I kept the dip refrigerated as well and it was great.

I brought this to a dinner party with granny smith and macintosh apples, bananas and bosc pears for dipping.  It was a big hit!  I used Werthers soft caramels because that was all my store had, and added about 5 extra.  I softened the cream cheese first, but there were still some little lumps when I mixed everything together.  A minute in the microwave and some stirring fixed that.  Great recipe!

Use the whole bag of caramels, or the caramel flavor of the dip is overshadowed by the cream cheese flavor. Try adding a little vanilla. Dip apple slices in orange or lemon juice to prevent browning. Also good with pretzels and gingerbread man cookies.

I found this while randomly browsing and decided to make this because of a sudden craving. THE best. Forget all about store bought caramel dip. This beats anything out of a container by far.

I'm not sure if I liked the strength of the cream cheese flavor (& I LOVE cream cheese normally). If I try this again, I'll definitely add some vanilla extract & maybe even a sprinkling of cinnamon.

This is amazing.  I use the low-fat cream cheese, but it doesn't take anything away from how great it tastes - plus you don't have to feel as guilty about taking more...

This was a really good fruit dip recipe. I am in search of the perfect fruit dip, and this was definetely awesome. Make sure you dont keep the temperature on low because if it's too high, the caramel mixture will bubble and burn. I used reduced fat cream cheese and light brown sugar. I also added a teaspooon of vanilla. I was tempted to add Kahlua but I didn't think it would work as well. My Mom just loved this, and we have been making a bunch of different fruit dips recently. It tastes almost like the storebought dip, but lighter in color and with the consistency of yogurt. We ate it with apples, but I bet it would taste good as the cream filling of a cupcake or maybe on top of angelfood or sponge cake. Pretzels, graham crackers, peanut butter cookies could work as dippers too. As for the eight servings, that is really pushing it. I would say more like 3 if you are really hungry!

I make this a little different. I use confectionary sugar - 2 pksg. of cream cheese and concode caramel dip - ( found in the produce section)  I use an electric mixer for the cream cheese, layer it on the bottom, warm the caramel in the microwave and spread it on top and use green apples to dip. It is always a crowd pleaser! You can cut the apples a head of time , put in a zip lock bag with a little orange juice so they don't brown.

OMG this was delicious!! SO simple to make! I used an 11 ounce bag of caramel bits since they are so much easier to melt. Make sure you soften the cream cheese first. I chilled the dip in the fridge for a little while before we ate it and was soooo good!

Delicious!  I used one cup of the baking caramel pieces (which equals 24 caramels).  Everyone wanted the recipe.  What I like about it is how thick it is and that it clings to the apples.

I LOVE this recipe, with the following modification: use the whole bag of caramels (mine was about 50 pieces), or the caramel flavor of the dip is overshadowed by the cream cheese flavor.  Apples (with caramel dip, of course) are my new favorite fruit to eat!

So wonderful!  This was easy to make and it taste great.  I did add more caramels and I put it in the fridge after I made it.  It taste just as good today as it did the other day when I made it.  I will make this again!

It was very yummy and surprisingly not as sweet as I expected it to be!  I did add a little vanilla and a few more caramels as suggested by other members.  When it was all finished, I simply could not keep my fingers out of the bowl.  My daughter asked if she could eat it for breakfast!  Thanks for the recipe.  Will defintely be added to my "Recipe Box".

This was a big hit! I used light cream cheese and added a few extra caramels. I made it the night before and it kept well for a couple of days. Will definitely make it again!

WONDERFUL dip!  Great for encouraging kids to eat fruit.  I made this for my son's Pre-K Halloween party and everyone was asking for the recipe.  One of the teachers said "That's too good to give to children!"  It was a HUGE hit.  I made it just as the recipe was written.  Thanks for sharing!!

This is the BEST!  We had a gathering for about a hundred people and I made this, about 6 times the recipe, and put it in a slow cooker on low and it was such a hit.   There wasn't even anything to lick at the end!

This is really good, better than I expected, in fact! I made it as a back-to-school treat for my boys and they gobbled it up and then asked for more apple slices so they could eat the last of it :) I followed the recipe exactly, no changes at all and none needed. this is a keeper!

This stuff is SINFUL! So so good and so easy! I used a couple of heaping spoonfuls of caramel ice cream topping in place of melting the caramels - added to the easy factor - and I could eat the whole bowl myself. Mmmmm. Thanks for the great recipe!

I used a whole package of the Kraft caramel bits, it saves the time of unwrapping all of the caramels.  I also softened the cream cheese a little in the microwave before mixing in the brown sugar and adding the melted caramel.  I actually made a double batch and it turned out great except for a few small lumps of brown sugar and cheese. I refrigerated it for the next day and I think the lumps will disappear if I stir it well before serving. Yummy!!

I absolutely loved this recipe.  I found the Kraft Caramel Bits which is wonderful. No unwrapping caramels forever. For those using these I called Kraft and was told 1 cups of bits = 25 caramels.    When I added just 1 cup of the caramel bits it was very watery.  I feared it would not firm up so since I love caramel anyway I added the whole bag. I put it in the fridge since we wasn't eating until the next couple days. It is a little thick but still good consistency for dipping.   I love this dip!! The cream cheese gave it a richer taste.  It certainly was hit!!

I have made a caramel apple dip for years. I use cream cheese and caramel ice cream topping. Just soften cream cheese and add some topping to suit your taste. This is so much easier. Barb

Made this for our Fall festival event. While I thought it was a bit too sweet, lots of others loved it... especially the kids. Kind of reminded me of sweetened condensed milk with a tangy taste. I will give it four stars because it went over so well. If I were going to make it ever again, I'd start with 1/4 cup brown sugar and work from there.

To make this even easier, instead of melting caramels, I put a layer of caramel ice cream topping on top of the cream cheese mixture (don't fold in) and then as an added bonus I sprinkle crushed skor bar on top.

Wicked tasty!  Great recipe!  This takes caramel apples up about 5 notches.  I was very pleased with the outcome.  Okay, so slight changes to combine 2 recipes from this site but very minor.  I used heavy cream with the caramel, about 2 or 3 tbs.  A touch of vanilla and half the brown sugar in the cream cheese mixture.  No nuts here. Excellent!

Excellent! I did add more caramels by almost double, to make it taste a bit more like your basic caramel apple.

So easy and DELICIOUS!!!  Was a hit with everyone young and old alike.  I will definitely be making this again.  The addition of the cream cheese helps to balance out the sugar and caramel.  Yummy!!! :o)

This was so incredible and so simply!  Only changes, added lil' vanilla and a lil' cinnamon.  I had thought about getting a store bought caramel apple dip and adding to that, but it was $3 and the caramels were 2.50 and I didnt count them but guessing I only used half.  This was just so yummy.  I am taking it trail riding with some friends over the weekend and I doubt there will be any left :-)

I followed the recipe exactly.  Like other reviewers have said, it is sweet and you can really taste the cream cheese. It has an excellent flavor to it. The caramel flavor is light so this would work well with other fruits and not just apples. It is easy to make too. I will definitely be making this again!

This is okay. Even though I love cream cheese, it had too much of a cream cheese taste and not enough of a caramel one, even after I added another 10 extra caramels. Probably won't make again

For a real caramel flavor, I doubled the amount of caramels.  Otherwise it was overpowered by the cream cheese.  Super yummy though - hard to stop eating!

This was very good!  I did make a few changes because I was making it for children who do not like cream cheese very well.  I used a whole bag of caramel, 3/4 of low fat cream cheese, and added a bit of milk to the water to melt the caramel.  The kids loved it and so did the adults!!  Oh also added 1 tsp vanilla like other reviewers.  Yum!

Yum!  I used about 24 caramels and it was fantastic.  I used the suggestion of putting the apples in water and lemon juice until serving time.

Very yummy recipe, thank you!  I kept all my apples in water with some lemon juice until they were needed, and made the dip a few hours ahead of time, too.  Turned out great!

Ok, so I dont know for sure what went wrong, except that the "fold in the caramel mixture" step went bad. Dip was lumpy, like bad gravy. Maybe my cheese and sugar werent creamed enough, or mayb the fat free variety of cream cheese was the problem. I tried everything to fix it--from mashing out the cheese lumps by hand to putting it back on the stove in hopes that the cheese lumps would eventually melt. No luck.  It tasted ok, but texture and appearance ruined it for me.

This was very easy to make and very, very good.  We used it as a dip for apples, but it was equally good as a topping on cake and ice cream.  Loved it!

I just tried this recipe last night, and it was great! I am so excited to bring it to thanksgiving! I mostly followed the recipe, accept I melted the caramels and water together in the microwave, stirring about every 20 seconds until smooth, and I added about 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract. My husband started stealing it before I could put it in the container! Very good!!

This dip is so yummy and easy we make it for every family gathering.  It is perfect as is, but I usually end up throwing in the whole bag of carmels becuase I dont know what I would do with a few leftover carmels in the cupboard.  I also top it with a chopped up Skor bar to make it look fancy.  Thanks for sharing such a fab-o recipe!

If I could give this more than five stars, I would. This was excellent, and a kid-friendly recipe as well. My eldest son and I had a blast making the dip together. I can see this one being made a lot in this house. TIP: I hollowed out a mini-pumpkin to hold the dip and my son arranged cut up apples around the pumpkin on a seasonal platter. Too cute!

I think I was supposed to dip something in this instead of eating it by the spoonful!  Defintitely deserves more stars!  Cut the sugar in half, 20 carmels, and cooked on water & carmel stove top until carmels were melting then added cream cheese and sugar and whisk smooth.  I wonder what leftovers or cold would have tasted like?  LOL! Thank you for sharing!

This recipe makes one bag of caramels go a long way and it taste great!  The only trouble I had was that it looked like peanut buter and everyone would try it.  Once I got the word out that it was caramel dip, they all ate it and loved it.  (I only had dark brown sugar, so maybe that's why it looked so much like peanut butter.)

Didn't change a thing and the dip turned out wonderfully.  We made this for my daughter to take as a treat to her classroom for her birthday party with sliced apples.  We didn't soften the cream cheese as others suggested and it whipped up nice and smooth after we mixed in the melted caramels.  Delicious.  Great recipe.  Thanks for the post.

I served this dip with sliced apples at my son's birthday party, and it was delicious!  I used caramel ice cream topping instead of the caramels because I was in a hurry.  A nice change of pace from store bought dip.

SOOOO good!  Super easy, ready to eat right after making or right out of the fridge!  Great with apples, ginger snaps.  I used new Kraft caramel bits 1st time about 1 1/4 bags, 2nd time, doubled the recipe and used about 2 fulls bags of caramel squares (minus the few we ate during unwrapping).  The caramel bits melted easier.  While melting the caramel squares with water, I slightlt browned the bottom of caramel in the pan.  There was small darker brown bits in caramel, but no one even noticed, it tastes so good!

This is so good!! I made it with 1/3-less-fat cream cheese and only half the brown sugar (1/4 cup).  Warm it was very creamy and had a definite but complimentary cream cheese flavor.  Chilled (my preference!) it kept its creamy dip-able consistency and had a more pronounced caramel flavor.  I also used 20 caramels instead of 16.  This recipe was easily doubled.  Thanks!!

I would have never though of this myself.  My mom brought me a whole bunch of apples, because she wanted me to "eat healthy" but I don't really like apples.  With this recipe... they disappeared from the fridge... my husband and I absolutely love it!!  Thanks Regina!!!  BTW... I usually only make half the recipe and 8 caramels with a splash of water melt perfectly in the microwave in 45 seconds... no need to dirty up the pots!

I made this dip for my MOPS ( Mothers Of Preschoolers )Group. I was really nervous about making this dip. I had never worked with caramels before and I was really doubtful about cooking them in water. But the dip turned out really tastey!!! I only added half the sugar and it still tasted great, just a lighter color of brown/caramel color. One thing I noticed was that the dip was very "soupy" after I'd made it. So I left in my fridge,overnight, to see if it would set up better and it did. It was "spoonable" like yogurt.    
The dip was a great success at the MOPS meeting. I had a little left over so I brought it home and ate up the rest  in one sitting!!! I WILL make this a PERMANENT addition to my recipe box and   put it in my favorites recipe folder. Thank you Lori!!

My 2 yr. old devoured this!! She ate two apples that day just so she could have this dip! I'll admit, I had 3 apples with her.  If you use at Free Cream Cheese, you loose aot of fat & calories, but none of the taste!!!

Meh, it was okay. On the advice of other reviewers, I upped the caramel count by about a quarter, and it still wasn't overly caramel-y. I love caramel, cream cheese and brown sugar, but the flavors just didn't come together well for me, despite being smooth and well-mixed. An 8 year old, two parents and a grandparent all agreed that it was okay-- i.e. it's not horrible but I'll be searching for a different recipe for next time. This made a lot-- perhaps we'll try the left-overs over ice cream.

Quick, easy, and delicious! Will definitely make this again. I crumbled a Heath Bar on top... it was amazing!!! You can make it ahead of time and refrigerate... I left it out on the counter for about 30 minutes before guests arrived, and it was perfectly soft!

I've made this dip for several parties that I've had and people LOVE it! The bowl always goes empty...which my husband hates because he loves this dip too. I always get asked for the recipe. I think I will make a bunch of jars of this up and pass them out as Christmas gifts this year!

Sometimes simplicity is best! It was really great, not too sweet and not too thick. I served it at a college art reception and it went over really well with the students and parents. The one issue that I did have was that I didn't get the cream cheese super smooth before mixing in the caramel but i think that's a bigger issue with my patience than the recipe.

OMG...this is the best! Wanted just half a batch, so I took reviewers advice - 16 caramels and cut everything else by half. Added 1/2 t. vanilla to recipe and served in individual dipping bowls sprinkled chopped walnuts - cut apple on the side.  Oldest son came back in kitchen and swiped the pan with finger to get the rest...no leftovers here!

This is delicious! It's not exactly the flavor of a caramel apple, but like a caramel apple cream sauce, maybe. I do think I'd prefer a different apple than the Granny Smiths I chose, because they sort of drown the caramel flavor out, but definitely a make-again recipe, thanks!

We had movie night at our house, and we spent more time around the bowl of apple dip instead of watching the movie.  I did use heavy cream for half of the water....I'm pretty sure the recipe wasn't supposed to be low fat or for daily consumption ;)  Super great!  My husband doesn't have a huge sweet tooth, and the cream cheese gives it just enough zing, especially paired with granny smith apples.

I was a little frustrated with this recipe since it didn't give a measurement for the caramel and I purchased the "ready to cook" caramel pieces at the store which is nowhere near the size of the bite-sized candies, but I just added the caramel until it seemed like enough.. That being said, once it was all prepared and cooled, it was *incredible*!  Just like caramel dip you could find at the store!

We did not care for this much. The caramels melted into a soupy syrup, so the dip came out very runny and cream-cheesy tasting. I melted 10 more caramels (without adding any water) and mixed those in, but the taste was still a bit off, while the consistency didn't change much. I don't know if the caramels were the cause.... We ate a bit and tossed the rest... I went on to try a peanut butter version and liked that one better. Still looking for a good caramel apple dip recipe, though...

WOW, best caramel apple dip EVER!  I used honeycrisp apples instead of the Granny Smith's because they were way too tart for me.  A little bit sweeter apple went much better with this recipe.  Thanks!

I added a few extra caramels, but we still didn't care for this at all.  It was an icky texture and tasted mostly like cream cheese.  I loved that it was quick and easy, and we did have guests that LOVED it.

Making this right now to bring to my daughter's second grade halloween party! Will be dipping apples, strawberries, pretzels and graham cracker sticks. Have already made this several times this apple season. I use the food processor to make it really smooth.  I use Kraft Caramel Bits for easy melting-one 11oz. bag. Delicious and easy. It keeps well for leftovers too. Enjoy!

Delicious! Next time I will probably increase the caramel since the cream cheese was the more dominant taste.  It's great the way it's written, but I want to experiment with the ratios a bit.

Excellent. After reading other reviews, I used 1c caramel pieces (easier than unwrapping), 1T vanilla, and wound up with the full 1/2c brown sugar, though I added it in 2 steps. It was not unduly sweet,  the texture was wonderful, and recovered after refrigerating. Also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese. Yummy recipe.

fabulous recipe.  i did make a mistake however and it worked out fine.  i used 1/2 cup water instead of 1/4 so i threw in 2 more caramels.  i also used fat free cream cheese. i used the mixer and whipped it really well.  came out fabulous.

Awesome recipe, I did this in the microwave and it turned out a bit runny, next time I'll use a little less water.

This was sooo amazing!! I made this the other day & no one could stop eating it even though we were all sooo stuffed!! The only thing I changed is that I used an entire bag of caramels because 16 caramels with an entire 8 oz package of cream cheese didn't seem like anywhere near enough & I didn't wanna be eating cream cheese!! So I used an entire package & it was awesome! So easy to make too I love it :)

My friends and I make a recipe similar to this one using only 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1Tbls vanilla.  Then we really guild the lily and sprinkle crushed Skor* bars all over the caramel. Use light cream cheese if it makes you feel better, it  doesn't change how rediculously good it tastes.  *(It's a chocolate covered toffee candy bar.)

I kept everything as is in this recipe, and it came out so delicious.  I was skeptical at first because it wasn't that many caramels, and it seemed like the cream cheese would overpower the caramel flavor.  But it came out perfect.  My hubby said it had the perfect caramel flavoring, and he couldn't guess that it had cream cheese. Great recipe.  I will definately be making this again and again.

Oddly enough, my teenagers weren't really into this.  I, on the other hand, was taking to eating it right from the spoon.  Very yummy!  The best caramel dip I've ever tried.  What do teenagers know about eating anyway?  :)

This is an excellent dip! I was actually eating it straight from the bowl! I had a little bit of a time getting the caramels to melt in the water, but that could be something I did. Otherwise, it turned out perfectly

This recipe was a huge hit and spectacular.  I did make a small adjustment by adding about half a bag of Heath "Bits o Brickle"  right before serving.  I found this in the same area as chocolate chips in the baking aisle and it made a big defference.  AWESOME!

Soooooo easy!! Absolutely yummy! Made it for a small party and it was a big hit!! Secret for serving apple chunks, after cutting them up, put them in a bowl of cold water and lemon juice for a few seconds before putting them out on a platter or in a bowl-they didnt turn brown all evening (grapefruit worked when I was out of lemon!)

This is an easy and wonderfully rich dip to bring to parties. It doesn't look like it will make a lot but it does.  I used the caramel pellets/chips that they sell like chocolate chips. They were easy and there was no need for unwrapping.

A perfect alternative to a Caramel Apple. Couldn't believe I actually got my son to eat a REAL apple. I was looking for a caramel apple recipe that was easy, ha-ha. This recipe was soooo easy compared to real caramel apples and really, the taste was to die for.

Tastes just like what it's made of--cream cheese and caramel.  Yum!  I halved the sugar and it's still plenty sweet.  It definitely can be made ahead of time and served from the fridge--this makes the recipe much more appealing to me.

This wasn't nearly caramely enough.
Not worth all the calories or cost of ingeds. and way too sugary. I have had better dips...still searching for the best recipe. We should've just eaten the caramels. Sorry.

This was an easy and delicious dip. I used just about 2T water so it was a little thicker. Can also be used as an ice cream topping. I made an apple cake topped with ice cream and this sauce and it was fabulous!

Amazing! I love this recipe!. I gave it 5 stars because I used sugar free caramel and it was still delicious. I didn't use as much brown sugar as the recipe called for but it was sooo goood! I had it with my apples on the side and my mom took it from me and told me I had to get my own! So thanks for the posting it's all smiles in the house. Lol

I think this tastes even better than the dip I used to but at the store.  I melted my caramels in the microwave stirring after ever 30 - 40 seconds.  Super easy, did not change a thing.  Will make this a lot.

LOVE this. I changed the recipe a little bit. I used 20 Wethers SOFT caramel chews, added a little bit of vanilla, used half the cream cheese and half the brown sugar (the Wethers caramels are extra sweet and rich) and added 1/4 teaspoon salt. My favorite thing to dip is pretzel sticks.

This was good, but I didn't love it.  The cream cheese flavor is stronger than the caramel flavor, which didn't do much for me, even though I love cream cheese.  It's a perfectly good recipe, but I guess I just prefer the caramel dip you buy in a tub at the store.

This was tasty. (I used more caramels and added vanilla per other reviewers.)  However, the cream cheese never mixed into the melted caramel completely so I was left with unappetizing lumps.  Since this was for an office party I couldn't have that!  I whisked and whipped it to no avail.  I ended up adding a half-cup of chunky peanut butter to disguise the lumps and WOW!  It was even better.  
Today, I had 3 people ask for the recipe and one very picky eater told me he ate the leftovers cold with spoon from the fridge in the pantry.

This stuff is addicting. I found myself starting with apples, then moving onto graham crackers, then pretzels, then just anything I could find to dip in this stuff! It's great! Thank you.

Delicious!  I plan to make this recipe to bring to my family's Thanksgiving get together.  SUGGESTION:  As addictive as dipping apple slices...pretzel sticks.

This is really good caramel dip!! Kids and adults loved it..I mixed a bit with some creamy peanut butter and slathered it on graham crackers....so good. I think you could use this between cake layers and as frosting!! Very quick and easy...

We were looking for something snacky to do with our surfeit of fall apples when I came across this recipe. It sounded kind of gross: carmel and cream cheese? But the other reviews were so positive that we decided to try it.  Wow!  What a hit! We will have to get more apples!

This is great. The consistency is very rich and creamy, it doesn't harden as it cools, which I really liked. I added a dash of cinnamon and vanilla extract to mine, and liked the result. Be careful if your counting calories, this stuff is addictive! You may want to make an extra batch to make up for all the "tasting" you'll do before serving!

This was excellent, my only mistake is I kept it in a crockpot too long, and it burned the bottom because I didnt stir it often enough.  It was still really good!

So, I made this because I had some creamy caramel dip left over (from aldi - you get in produce section near caramel apples.)  I used 2/3 of a cup of the dip and 1/2 t vanilla with the cream cheese & brown sugar.  It's delish!   Normally I don't alter a recipe the first time I try it, but just thought I'd share in case anyone was looking for a short cut or also had leftover caramel dip to use up!  Serving with apples, grapes and cinnamon graham cracker sticks at a shower.

LOVE THIS!! Used it in my caramel apple bar and it was so popular!  I made a double batch and had the little bit of leftovers the next day after pulling it out of the refrigerator the next day - it was perfect!  Will definitely make it again!

This was the absolute worst! I was hesitant about cream cheese to begin with but this was awful. The cream cheese did not break up properly and made the caramel chunky and not in a good way. Cream cheese has no business in caramel apple dip. I am not sure if I was doing this wrong or trying to use it for the wrong thing but whatever the case I did not get good results and the taste was not good. :( I will keep hunting.

Absolutely splendid!!! Tried it with gala apples at first and it was much to sweet. Switched to Fuji and Granny Smith apples and couldn't get enough. My kids and I absolutely enjoyed this. It will definitely be made regularly. Thanks so much.

This dip is fantastic! I used 20 caramels instead of 16, but it still wasn't quite caramely enough for me, so I'll increase them again next time. Overall, the texture was great, everybody loved it, and it was insanely easy. I will definitely be making this again!

Every time I make this recipe I make double because it gets wiped out fast!  From toddlers to the seniors they all love it.  To give it extra caramel flavor I just add more caramels than recipe calls for.  Definitely a favorite!

Outrageously delicious!!!  Took advice to add a little vanilla and a few extra caramels.  Melted the caramels in the microwave,  added to the cream cheese mixture, and it turned out wonderful!  Definitely a "keeper".

Used the full bag of caramels-well, except the couple that we ate-and microwaved them. Next time, I will do in a double boiler, there were lumps of unmelted caramel. Absolutely delicious, and am planning on making again 5 days after the original try!

Awesome! Added vanilla (about 2 tsp to the caramel mixture) as others suggested. Made a double batch the day before and left it in the fridge. Still perfect the next day and totally gone!

So yummy!  I used caramel bits for baking and used the equivalent of about 24 caramels and then only used half the cream cheese because that's all I had on hand. Still really really good.

I made this without additional sugar.  My husband thought it was gross, but I loved it.

I thought the dip was great!  The only thing I did differently was that I used 20 caramels instead of 16, based on some other reviews.  The cream cheese was not overpowering, but I still think I would use all the caramels next time - there's about 24 in the bag. (Werther's)

I made this recipe for a party and it wasn't a big hit.  I think it needed to be labeled because people weren't sure what kind of dip it was.  (Someone asked me if it had peanut butter in it.)  However, I thought it tasted very good, and it was easy to make, so I might try it again sometime.  I'll just be sure to let people know what it is.

To make it even easier I buy the already made apple caramel dip found in the produce isle. I warm the cream cheese before mixing in the brown sugar and then warm the caramel and spread over the cheese mixture and for an added bonus put 3-4 chopped Skor chocolate bars on top. Never any leftover left at get togethers

This was a big hit at my Christmas party!  I'm giving it 4 stars because I had trouble getting a smooth consistancy.  I even let the cream cheese come to room temperature.  All of that said, it still tasted delicious!  We liked it best with Granny Smith apples.

This is delicious!! I followed the recipe to a T and loved it warm, as well as several days later. It does make a lot, so you may want to cut down on the ingredients unless you are serving it for a large group.

This was pretty good. It's really sweet, so I choose tart apples to dip. I also used 1/4 cup caramel ice cream topping to make the dip smoother than the wrapped caramels.

Made this to go along with apples for my son's birthday party.  We soon discovered it tasted just as good as a hot dip on top of the brownies at the party too :).  Very good, but its pretty rich.

I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.  I should have halved this batch, because no one at our house wanted to eat it.  It tasted neither like caramel or cream cheese.  I'm not really sure what it tasted like.  Personally, I thought it was good, but not as good as I expected.  It wasn't fantastic.

This was really good.  I was a little surprised that it was actually on the runny side... not too runny though.. it still coated the apples very well.... which actually probably made it easier to dip.  I made this for a party of 12 adults and 7 kids, so I doubled the recipe thinking that 8 servings would never be enough.... it was far more than enough!!  I could of made the single recipe and still had plenty for the 3 pound bag of apples I used.

This recipe is so easy to make and is so yummy!! I used a few more pieces of caramel which made it taste less cream cheesy and it also added more color. I will definitely make this again!

Followed exactly-using equal amount of caramel bits in place of the caramels.  Yum!  Very cream cheesey-but I liked that.  I may add a litttle more caramel or less water next time to try and make it slightly thicker, but loved it!

I too will probably add more caramel - it was very good the way the recipe is written but I would like a slightly more caramel taste.  This dip is good both warm & cold.

Good, But not great.  I suggest letting the caramel cool before folding into the cream cheese.  I can see where it could be the great beginnings to a caramel cheesecake.

This is so simple and wonderful! The kids absolutely loved it and it can be made days in advance. The cream cheese adds nutritional value to what would otherwise be pure sugar. This is definitely a recipe I will use again and again. I followed it exactly. If it seems too thin when you first make it, chill it a bit and it thickens up to perfection.

I have made this three times now and everyone loves it! I microwaved the caramels and water all three times but I think I will try it on the stove next time because one time it was hard to get the consistency right.

Mmm...I could eat this all day!  I used an entire bag of caramels.  I thought it might be too sweet with the caramels and the brown sugar, but the cream cheese balances it out perfectly, plus it keeps for days in the refrigerator.

Great recipe!!! I followed the direction of another review and added vanilla. I served mine cold and stirred in crumbled up pieces of heath bar. It just gives it an extra crunch. It was great served with Granny Smith apples. This is a new fall favorite!

This is the best! I made it for apple slices for a small get together. I used leftovers for an ice cream sundae and dipped pretzel sticks too. OK, honestly....I just ate some with a spoon too!

In Canada we skip the brown sugar and add Skor bar chips (toffee chips like Heath bars) on the top of the dip for a great crunchy texture. Thanks for the recipe - it is a HIT whenever I make it.

This was good.  A little too sweet for me but that's just my personal preference.  I think next time I will use 1/4 cup brown sugar.  All in all an easy recipe that will please many.  Thanks!

Rated this recipe a five but actually give it a  10.  I questioned the cream cheese in this recipe but followed instructions and of course had to check it out before I gave it to the kids and OH MY GOSH!!!!  Hubby loved it too--WILL be making this often.  Already brain-storming ideas to incorporate it into other recipes.

I made this as an extra dessert for a dinner party I gave a few weeks ago. Everyone LOVED it!! I made exactly as written, didn't change a thing. Guests were not only using it to dip the apples in, they were pouring it over the other desserts (cakes and ice cream) as a topping!! Will definately be making again. Thanks for the recipe!

This dip is delicious and easy to make. I took it to a baby shower and everyone loved it. I thought it would be too sweet but it was a nice balance with tart green apples. I did not like it on sweeter red apples, though. This will be a regular recipe for any of my gatherings.

simple and tasty!  only thing I did different was use a bag of caramel bits. made the night before, kept fine.
*UPDATE* I had leftovers because I ran out of apples. So I used it as a caramel sauce with brownie and ice cream. It was awesome!

This was just ok.  Taste too much like cream cheese (and I love cream cheese!!!).  It was missing something, I'm just not sure what.

Easy and sweet, good dip. Tastes just like a caramel apple would.

Made for a Halloween party and was eaten up so quick I ended up making three batches! People were dipping pears, apples, even their fingers (onto their plates, not the serving bowl!!) into this luscious treat. I did add more caramels per other reviews, and it made it perfectly sweet and creamy. Today my husband and I are finishing off the leftovers...though that's only because I saved us some before it hit the appetizer table! The perfect fall dip!

Awesome and Easy
Instead of mixing, make the cream cheese and sugar your base layer, add caramel on top without mixing and then top with crushed Skor bar -- makes for great presentation :)

This is the most delicious apple dip ever!  To make this dip even easier . . . instead of melting caramels, I use a plastic carton of caramel apple dip, sold in the produce section.  (Not to be confused with a jar of ice cream topping caramel.)  I also always top the dip with a king-sized Health or Score bar, chopped.  Beautiful presentation and even more irresistible!  I would never take this to a party without at least doubling the whole recipe.  It goes fast.  Oh, and make sure to slightly lemon or lime juice your apples to keep from browning.

Splendid, especially on a busy Halloween night. I paired this with Honey Crisp apples, one of the best apples available. The recipe approximates the taste of carameled apples, without the sticky mess and stick-to-your-teeth inconvenience. I highly recommend this easy-to-prepare recipe.

You've got to try this!  So easy and so good!  Other reviewers are right- this dip stays soft, even after refrigeration.  Here's a variation:  add toasted pecan pieces, finely chopped apple (tossed in lemon juice) and Hershey's Cinnamon Chips.  Serve with graham crackers.  It just went from great to incredible.  I used Macintosh apples.  I was afraid the apples might get mushy, but was pleasantly surprised!  They didn't.  The dip was still good the next day.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I love this dip!!  I've made this a couple times & it is always delicious!  Everyone loves it- my cousin's three year old was trying to eat it with a spoon!  The only thing I do differently is use the whole package of caramels & make ahead & chill until time to serve. I also used low-fat cream cheese.  Great recipe I will be making again & again.

When I first finished making it I probably wouldn't have given it 3 stars.  After it got cold and the flavors blended together it was really good.

I did this but to serve one and omitted the actual caramels: 2 tablespoons cream cheese, 1 packed tablespoon brown sugar, microwave for 10 seconds, take out and add just a drop of vanilla, mix, and enjoy! That was enough for just 1 person and one sliced apple! Delicious!

This was so very yummy! I actually had to hide it from my daugther as she kept getting into the fridge and putting her wee fingers into it! I do wonder if it needs the brown suger as our caramels in Australia are very, very sweet. Might try and omit next time. Thanks so much!

orginally i made a double portion of another apple dip on this site cosisting of cream cheese, brown sugar and vanilla. The taste was ok ( mostly cheesey), so I added 66 caramels microwaved ( melted ) with 3/4 cup of milk. Blended the melted caramels into the 1st apple dip and ended up with a dip that was lip smacking and finger licking good ( grrreat)...

Love It,Love It,Love It! I made this caramel apple dip for a baby shower and everybody just raved about how good it was. Everybody wanted the recipe because it is just that good! You can use just about any kind of fruit for this dish and pretzels also work well too! ;-)

I wish this wasn't so good! Tastes great as is, or with the addition of a 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Use to dip graham crackers, apples, grapes and anything else you have on hand. Thanks.

I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving and only one person out of two families liked it. The only thing I did different was use Kraft caramel bits rather than caramel squares. My husband said it had a weird flavor. I thought it was because he doesn't like cream cheese (I didn't tell him it was in the recipe though), but my daughter who loves cream cheese said she didn't like it either. Glad I also made a yummy pumpkin dip. It was wiped out!

Tasted like a 5 but gave it a 4 because of modifications - used 20 caramels and half the sugar as recommended.  Also used cream instead of water for richer flavor.  To avoid lumps (like yvetteski), make sure you soften cream cheese (20 seconds in the microwave is good), then whip it with the sugar and a sturdy whisk.  Kids loved it, me too!

I am making this tomorrow for my sons preschool snack however I just wanted to suggest, instead of using water to melt the caramels with, use 1-2 Tblsp. of whipping cream! It will be the creammiest caramel you have ever had!!

Yum!  How can you go wrong with these ingredients?  Makes a great, smooth dip.  We halved the recipe and my husband, toddler and myself polished it off with just 2 apples!  Will definitely hang on to this recipe.

very delicious. I did add about 10 extra carmels. I love this recipe. Only thing that I wanted to note is that it takes a little longer than 6 minutes to make. I would say more like 12 to 15 minutes

very easy and quick. My son thought it was great. i did cut the sugar in half, and added more caramels. also added 2 tbsp of milk in to keep it easily spreadable and dippable.

What a hit!  Everyone loved this dip!  Make sure you remeber the water when heating the caramels (I forgot them the first time and had to start over :)

This dip is DIVINE!  I decided to give it a try for a Thanksgiving get together.  It is heavenly, and only takes minutes to make.  I wouldn't change a thing.......just double the recipe to make sure you'll have enough!!!

Everyone loved this! Topped it off with pecan bits and served it with pretzel stix and apple slices. I used Fuji apples because I thought they wouldn't brown as quickly (read that somewhere), but they did, so most of my guests went with the pretzel stix. How do you keep apple slices from browning? Anyway - this was a fantastic dip!

If you're looking for an apple dip, you gotta try this one!  I made this for the kids at my sons birthday party.  The adults wound up hogging it!  Once I tasted it, I knew why.  It is really addicting...once you start, it's really hard to stop!  Since then, I've made this three times in the last month for my "kids" (great excuse for making more for me haha) for their afternoon snacks.  Apparently I'm the best mommy in the world for it!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe is so good. I found myself sneaking tastes of it. Served with Granny Smith apple slices and grapes. I am going to try the graham cracker idea as well.

This is AMAZING!!! I make it ahead of time and keep it in the fridge until guests arrive. It is just as wonderful and great for dipping right out of the fridge.

Mmmmm! Like creamy caramel apples. I used less water and more caramels. I used Werther's- so easy to unwrap! They are really creamy too. Super easy to make for a party. My boyfriend made me make two batches- one for him to eat now!

Wow- I didn't realize I hadn't rated this yet!!! Serves 8?? Yeah, right! I usually divide this between 4 ramekins & sprinkle pecan chips over the top. SHOULD be enough for 4 large apples. I could eat this straight out of the bowl. I'll bet it would be great on ice cream or as a cake frosting!?!? Can't say enough about it. Used cored & sliced Fuji apples. Thanks Lori!

This Apple Dip is absolutely fabulous!!  I've made it several times for parties and get togethers and it is ALWAYS a hit, people can't get enough of it.  Instead of normal caramels, I've used Eclair Caramels from Cadbury, which are filled with chocolate. My final result is a chocolate-caramel dip. Hmmmmm!!!!

This is a great recipe.  I teach a cooking class and my students prepared it for a reception.  Teachers, parents, and students loved it!!! I made it the day before it was to be served and then reheated it just before serving. The students preferred this to a cold dip. Once again, it's wonderful.

It was excellent.  I needed something different to take along with another dessert to a party with friends this weekend.  My friends couldn't get enough!
