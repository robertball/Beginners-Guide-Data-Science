First, this recipe is greatly improved if the lemon juice is doubled to 2 tablespoons. Second, I don't like black pepper so I left it out of the recipe. The mustard I used was Gray Poupon Country Style (if type and brand make a difference).

I took MARGALITA4's suggestion to try it on pork after making the wings (which were very good). I used country style pork ribs, marinated them overnight, and we all though this marinate made them even more delicious than the wings--so I next tried lamb chops. If anyone reading this recipe likes lamb chops, this marinade is fantastic on lamb. 

Oh, don't use bottled, chopped garlic in this recipe. The difference between fresh and bottled is dramatic. One of my 3 tests used the bottled for 1/2 the recipe as a test and it was not as good.

I made these for my husband and Dad and baked/broiled in the oven rather than grill due to weather.The smell of the marinade was fantastic and they cooked up beautiful.Both of them loved them.I thought they were great too and will definately be making them again.

We decided to have a wings for dinner night at my house and this was on the menu. This was a huge hit with both kids and adults! Easy preparation and wonderfully tasty but not spicy. Excellent!

I made these wings and the family just loved them, and they take no time to prepared, in fact I did not even marinate them for the two hours suggested I just mixed and grilled and they were great so I imagine they only get better with marination time.

Cooking directions were good.  Suprised that there was hardly any flavor in these wings.  Soaked them for 24 hours. I thought these would be awesome, flavor no, but cooked perfect.

Good recipe.  Used it on chicken wings the first time--very tasty.  Used it on pork chops the second time--even better.  It takes awhile for the taste to develop so make sure you set aside a few hours for marination before cooking.

I used this on boneless chicken instead of wings.  I wasn't sure about the amount of black pepper so I only used 1/2 the suggested amount.  I'd suggest not basting with the marinade (that was used on the raw food) during cooking as this might not be a safe practice. Some sites say you can reuse the marinade for basting if you boil it for 5 to 7 minutes but why bother?

This recipe was great! My husband, my 5 year old and my one year old all loved it. The marinade came out pretty thick for me so I couldn't really use it to baste during grilling but it was still perfect. I did cut back on the pepper and salt since they seemed to be a little much. What a nice change from BBQ sauce!

Made this last night and everyove loved it.  Did use on boneless/skinless chicken breasts since it's what I had on hand.  Next time, I will use a little less salt though.  It tasted a little salty but still delicious!

The sauce is a 10 star sauce (although we use about half the salt!) but the cooking method doesn't seem to work for us.  We've made these several times and can't seem to keep the sauce from burning off the wings with the high heat the recipe suggests.  So, now we double the sauce but put the sauce on AFTER we cook the wings.  I've also marinated the wings with just lemon and olive oil then grill them.  Take them off the grill and coat them in the sauce.  You can make them ahead of time and store them in the fridge til you need them.  I pop them in the oven on 400 for about 10 or 15 minutes and they are perfect.  We are addicted to these!

This is my absolute favorite chicken marinade/coating that I've ever made.  My entire family loves it, and very rarely do we have leftovers.  I've found it tastes great on chicken wings, breasts, and thighs.  We particularly love it on thighs, mainly because that's our favorite type of chicken meat.  Of all the times I've made, I've always doubled the amount of marinade, mainly so I have enough for basting on the grill without having to boil what I've poured off from the actual marinade.  The only change I've ever made is to cut down on the garlic . . . and I know that's a personal preferance.  If I use 6 cloves of garlic for a single recipe or 12 cloves for a double recipe, it's incredibly garlic . . . and I know a lot of people like it that way . . . for my family . . . I had to cut back on a few cloves.  My biggest advice . . . make a double recipe, because you family will be begging for leftovers!!!

This came out very well. We used this marinade & basting sauce on boneless skinless chicken breasts which I marinated for something like 2 days. I did add some honey to the marinade because the flavor just wasn't popping to me. We only used about half the total amount of marinade & basting sauce that we made, but your results may vary in that 2 lbs of chicken wings has a lot more surface area to coat! I also vastly reduced the salt and pepper and just added them to taste. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Used tenderloins along with regular chicken wings. 
Baked not grilled. Didn't marinade as the recipe suggested.
Chicken was delicious! My kiddos loved it!
Will definitely make again!

I used 4 chicken breasts instead of wings, and let marinate over night, and broiled in the over. DELICIOUS and super simple! Dinner ready in less then 30 minutes. PERFECT! Thanks for sharing this recipe :) printed and in my book!

Wonderful! I'm following the recipe again, and its been less than a week since I first tried it. I used drumsticks instead of wings. This is an amazing alternative to BBQ.

I added a little white wine to this recipe to make it a little thinner and also used some of the marinade for vegetables when I put it all in a grill basket, everything was very tasty.

Waaay too much pepper!!  It was so overpowering, I couldn't taste anything else.  Definitely not worth the time to marinate.  It might be salvaged by putting 10% of the pepper specified, but if I'm going to marinate for hours, I expect delicious, this seemed mediocre.  Thanks anyways....

Easy, Fast and Absolutely delicious  - Cooked on Weber with Apple wood chips.  Marinaded for about 4 hours in the fridge - didn't have any marinade to boil and reduce.  However, there was no need for it.

Wow! Delicious!!! Only real complaint I have is that I didn't make more. :( I would make a suggestion, not to use as much salt - maybe 1/2 TSP is plenty? Thanks for the awesome recipe!!! This one is a keeper

I found this dish to be delicious, however the majority of the flavor came from the actual grilling, not the recipe.  More mustard, maybe?

I am not a fan of marinades so I simply spread the mixture on the wings and put it all in the oven. I made sure to turn them often so they were coated evenly at all times. I also used lime instead of lemon, and used much more juice. next time I'll add more salt too

This was NOT bland at ALL. But it sure was salty. D: I only added 1 1/2 tsp salt, and in the future I will cut it to 3/4 tsp or less. Other than that, it was pretty darn good! I will be making it again with less salt. I used drumsticks today, and they turned out soooo juicy. There isn't really a mustard-lemon-y tang - it just tastes 'good'. Served with fresh salad and potato skins. Thank you!

Wow!  I used half dijon mustard, half spicy mustard, and only 1 tsp. of black pepper.  Let them marinate overnight and then grilled them.  They were excellent and completely devoured!  *Update*  After making this several times on chicken, hubby requested it on pork.  It was awesome!

We all loved these yummy wings.  I made them as an appetizer for a tailgate party and I ended having to run to the store to get more drummies to make them.  Most everyone said these were better than buffalo wings.  I took the suggestion of doubling the lemon juice and added the zest of one lemon to the sauce.

FANTASTIC !!! I followed the recipe to the letter and they turned out beautifully. At first I thought there was not enough marinade for the amount of wings but it was just right. They taste delicious and I am already starting my second batch. You have to give them a try !!!

This is mostly a review of the sauce, since the cooking directions are pretty universal.  I found that, for all the mustard and garlic required for this recipe, it was really flat.  I quadrupled the lemon and still could barely taste anything but a slight hint of grilled garlic and fresh pepper.  You need far more acid to make this a proper marinade--almost a 50/50 of oil to acid--and then a sweetened mustard (with a bit of honey) should be used as a glaze during cooking.

I grilled these both times I made them.  I found recipe a tad salty and not quite as lemony as I wanted so I halved the salt and doubled the lemon juice.  I also whipped up a nice dipping sauce of mayonnaise & creme fraiche (sour cream or plain yogurt would work as a substitute) in almost equal parts, but a bit more mayo, and added to taste: lemon juice, crumbled blue cheese, and black pepper or lemon pepper seasoning.

I know the recipe is supposed to be for chicken wings, but I used this to marinate some lamb chops and they turned out super!  I cut the pepper down to 1 tsp and used honey dijon mustard. Had it as a light dinner with a cucumber salad with tzatziki.  Wonderful!

This one was okay, it did not have the lemony burst of flavor I am looking for.  This one was also very easy and quick to prepare.  Will do again, just not soon.

Terrific! I didnt use this with wings, but chopped up a pound of chicken and used it for kabob's. very good marinate.
I marinated for about 3 hours or so.
the day I cooked, I thought maybe the salt and pepper should be scaled back a little bit. the next day, as leftovers, it was perfect. I have already had requests for the recipe.  I used some dijon mustard I had, and regular black pepper.  definitely I will have this again!

I made these wings tonight and they were very good.  I followed the recipe almost exactly (the only thing I did do was substitute minced garlic for fresh garlic). I really liked them, but wished they had just a little more kick.  Other than that, it was a really good simple recipe that anyone could do!

Favor-filled, enjoyable chicken wing recipe. Crispy on the outside yet moist on the inside!

The recipe doesn't require any adjustments but, since I love sesame seeds, I added a little sesame seed oil to the olive oil and  lightly sprinkled sesame seeds on top when they were close to being done.  I also emulsified the ingredients so they didn't  run off of the chicken while grilling and basting.  They are delicious!!

I marinated boneless chicken breasts with this overnight and then broiled them. They came out tender, juicy, and reallly flavorful. My 9yo declared it the best chicken I've ever made, and he can't wait for us to try it on the grill. I added the black pepper just as written because he really likes spicy food, but if you don't,  I'd advise cutting that down to 1 or 1 1/2 teaspoons.

We added 1/4 c. honey and cut way back on the pepper, didn't have time to marinate, and baked in the oven @ 350 for 1 hour.  Delicious!  Bet they would be good cooked on the grill as the recipe states.  Will make again & continue to tweak.

I just made these wings and I thought they were really good.  I used whole fresh wings instead of pieces and I didn't measure the ingredients for the marinade (poured and mixed by eye).  I mixed the marinade in a ziplock bag, added the wings and let them sit in the fridge for 5 hours.  I would make these again!

Overall pretty good recipe, but next time I will cut the salt to half. I also double the marinade recipe and a bit more then half for marinading and the other half for basting so I didn't have to boil the marinade after. Main issue we had with this recipe wasn't the recipes fault...but moreso our bbqs. The marinade kept dripping down and causing insta-flames which in turn burnt the wings. My Mother in law told us a way around is to have half the bbq on the right temperature and the other side off and keep the wings on the other half to prevent the big flames.

hubby and i loved it!!  but 4 stars because i did make some changes.  halved the olive oil, quadrupled the lemon.  subbed out some of the salt for soy sauce, added 1.5 tablespoon of honey, and a tsp of worcesterchire and chili powder for a little extra kick.  i'll prob add chili paste next time for even more kick as we like things on the spicy side.  used it on 6 full sized drumsticks and baked for 1 hour, basting every 10 to 15 minutes.  so good! my husband specifically asked me to keep this recipe in frequent rotation.

Fantastic!  My husband and I agreed that this was the best chicken we'd ever had, let alone made at home!  We used chicken tenders instead of wings and cooked them on our indoor grill.  I set aside a little of the sauce for basting, so we didn't have the extra step of simmering the marinade.  They turned out great!  We're going to try baking them next time.

This was pretty good. Definitely needs to be basted frequently to get that lemon dijon flavor. I initially forgot to bast these and was wondering why they were so bland (even after sitting in marinade for nearly 2 days)so definitely bast frequently during grilling process. A side of honey mustard sauce might be nice too.

i didnt grill this, instead baked and i was fairly disappointed in the taste. i could not taste the dijon flavor at all. not sure if grilling makes a difference.

We loved the recipe even though the meat didn't cook all the way through. I also added a little paprika and oregano. That gave it a better taste.

I've made this recipe twice, although I don't bother to seperate the wings and I put them in the oven instead of grilling them. Also, while it's great to marinate them for 2 hours if you don't have the time 15 minutes is enough. Very easy recipe that's relatively quick to prepare.

I used this on chicken thighs and grilled it on the Foreman Grill.  It was so surprisingly easy and amazingly tasty for simple grilled chicken!

This recipe is terrrrrrrrrrific! It is one of the best chicken marinades I have ever had and certainly ever made. Anyone I serve this to goes nuts for it! I added a tablespoon of honey and half a table spoon of maple syrup to make the flavour a bit more mellow and complex. It does not trun out sweet at all, but most salty-spicy recipes can use a touch of sugar! I have made this many times and will continue to do so! Thanks David!
