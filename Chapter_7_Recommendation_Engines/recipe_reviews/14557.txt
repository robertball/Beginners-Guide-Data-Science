Love, exactly as written! One quick note: I notice a lot of ppl subbing fresh ginger for jarred or powdered in recipes - Buy a "hand" of ginger, wrap it in plastic wrap then put in a freezer bag, and use as needed. It's super easy to grate this way - just peel a small amount, grate away, then back in the freezer. Hope that helps someone.

Finger licking deliciousness! This sauce was a HIT at our BBQ.. I doubled it and used half to baste and half to dip. SOOO GOOD! I addedd sesame oil, mirin,1 cap full of liquid smoke, and a tiny bit of siracha chili sauce... My hub "told" me to have this sauce in the fridge at all times.. People couldn't belive I made it from scratch! this is a great recipe!

This was very good, but very similar to 'Japanese chicken wings' from this site. Sorry, but I prefer the Japanese chicken wings recipe to this.

I substituted cider vinegar for rice vinegar and white sugar for brown, and it still turned out to be the perfect sauce for barbecue chicken sandwiches.  I mixed it all together, cooked the (sliced) chicken a bit, and threw it all together for 20 minutes and it was delicious.

Just perfect! I left a bag of groceries at the store and I left my hoisin sauce. I found this recipe and it was better than anything I have tried. I didn't have rice vinegar so I used white wine vinegar. It turned out awesome but I'll try the rice vinegar next time. Thanks for sharing :-) Oh and I cut the sugar down to 1/2C!

I don't normally like sweet sauces, but I absolutely loved this! I used jarred ginger and garlic, but fresh would probably be even better.

This recipe was amazing.  We love barbeque sauce with our salmon and this was a great alternative.  Reminded my husband of sweet and sour sauce.  Make sure you give it enough time to cook.  I thought I'd be smart and cook the sauce while I cooked the salmon but it needs to boil for a while to get to the perfect consistancy.

My husband said this was the best BBQ Chicken he had ever made on the grill.  I made the basting sauce as directed, except for reducing the sugar to 1/2 cup.  Perfect!  Kids loved it, too.  Would be good on pork or salmon.  Thanks for a great new recipe!

Used chili sauce instead of tomato, upped the soy sauce a little and reduced the sugar by half. Really good.

I found the vinegar scent way too strong for me. I had high hopes, but didn't enjoy the final product until I sprinkled Caribbean Jerk powder on my chicken breasts as well.

Loved it! I don't know if I'll ever find such a delicious, easy-to-make basting sauce. It's so flavourful! Thanks for sharing this one, Bonnie.

I wanted to make it just as it states, but I was in a hurry and didn't check to see if I had all the ingredients.  I used a chipoltle bbq sauce in place of the ketchup (It really gave it a nice kick), and I used white vinegar.  I doubled the recipe and we used it for kebobs and as a topping on rice.  The family raved about it and told me I had to make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very Good!!  We used this basting sauce on grilled chicken and it was very tasty!!  As suggested by others, I too, reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and it was sweet, but not too sweet.  Other than that I followed the recipe as written.  This is a snap to put together and an added bonus - I had everything on hand in the pantry.  I made it early in the day and just let it sit at room temperature until grilling time.  The chicken came off the grill with a beautiful sheen, and it was moist and delicious.  I’ll be making this one again!  Thank  you!

Not a bad sauce...way 2 sweet even for my husband who typically likes a sweet sauce...i had to cut the sauce with some hot chili sauce, that helped a little...if i were to make this again, i would cut the sugar to less 1/2 cup

After reading the reviews i decided to add a tbsp of red pepper flakes to counter the overly sweet flavor that others said it had. It really did the trick and the sauce was awsome.

Great Basting Sauce.  I followed the recipe exactly (except I doubled it).  I used it as a final baste on the "Rubbed and Grilled Pork Loin" recipe from this site.  Just be careful it will burn fast on the grill with all that sugar.  With all that ginger, it definitely puts an Asian twist to the flavor - so make sure that is what you want.  Only negatives, its high in salt and sugar, but I don't think there is anything wrong with us low carb eaters enjoying this once in a while.

I used this to make some Chinese bbq spareribs a little more sticky.  I stirred this together and after it started boiling I threw in the leftover ribs to heat up.  It's pretty good as a dip for chicken tenders too!  I didn't have any fresh ginger, so I used about a half teaspoon of dry ground ginger.  Very sweet, but way better than any reddish asian sauce I have purchased at a regular grocery store.  I think it would be great with some kind of chiles added in.  YUM!

I decided to use this as a marinade and cooking sauce... excellent decision!! Even though I had nowhere near as much ginger as I needed (I managed to wrangle about 1/3 teaspoon) instead of the 1 tablespoon called for... the sauce was incredibly flavourful. As I wasn't going to baste with it, I didn't  add the cornstarch. Everything blended and flavoured throughout  the chicken. It was incredible. This is now at the top of my favourite sauces!

I made this sauce with splenda and poured it over pre-boiled pork ribs, baked them for 30 min @ 350 and it was FAB!

YUM! I make this with splenda (3/8 of a cup) and splenda-sweetened ketchup, to reduce the carbs. I need to add just a bit more soy sauce when I do so, to balance out the flavors. Also nice as a mustard-free BBQ sauce - a friend is allergic to mustard
