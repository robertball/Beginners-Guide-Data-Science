Kevin my mom made these for us too and the three of us all loved them! These days I normally make Taylor Ham, egg and cheese sammies but I just had to try this on my gang and they Yummed them all down! The only thing I did differently was grill the bread in a buttered skillet instead of making toast. Thanks so much for the comforting memory Kevin!

Huge hit with the kids--especially the littlest. I made only two small changes which was using sliced cheddar cheese instead of American and I omitted the onion for the boys as they don't like it (chopped up in bologna spread, no problem but full slices, they pass). They both ate their sandwiches and asked for another. Winner!

Anyone even thinking about this recipe needs to try it. My husband makes a very similiar sandwich for me all the time. It is almost the same as Kevin's, except he does not add the onion ( I am going to try it though) and he grills the sandwich after it is assembled (like a grilled cheese). There is just something about the combination of flavors that is just amazing. The fried egg with the mix of condiments and the pickle, OMG Yum!!! If anyone has access to Finnish mustard, this is what we use and prefer to yellow mustard.

Loved this as a kid. I’ve tweaked it over the years. Unless you score the bologna, it will bubble up in the center and cook unevenly. I now cook the bologna in the Panini press. The only other thing that I do differently is that I scramble the egg with a couple of shots of the “Creole Torpedo” (Frank’s Louisiana Hot Sauce). I then top it with cheese and finish it off in the Panini press until the cheese is just starting to melt.

My husband wouldn't even try this, but me and the kids thought the pickle really made this sandwich! We left off the mayo and ketchup, but we really enjoyed it.

I opted to use one slice of multi-grain bread, having it open-faced. I made a mistake and added butter to the pan to fry bologna (per recipe, you don't have to), resulting in a messy pan. Had to use another one for the egg. I also scored the bologna around the edge so that it would not curl up. Spread the bottom of toasted bread with mayo, then dotted with the mustard and ketchup. The addition of pickles and onions really worked well here.  I popped it in the microwave for about 20 sec to melt the cheese a bit. This could be for brunch, lunch or dinner, and I'd definitely make it again. Thanks  for the recipe Kevin!

Who would have thought to put all those condiments on at once.  This tasted so good, actually put it on Italian bread.  Delish.  Pickle was great on it too.

I never dreamed that a bologna sandwich could make my husband so happy! So much better than the plain one I've made for years with only mayo and cheese. I left off the onions (can't handle them in the morning), didn't toast the bread (we prefer soft) and added lettuce, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Oh and I used Colby jack cheese on mine, as I don't care for American. Thanks a bunch, Kevin!

Pretty awesome sandwich.  I will try some lettuce next time but it is very good on its own. I am a fan of onions on my sandwiches so I added red onions. DELIGHT
