This was so much like my Oma's cheesecake I was floored! Luckily I found Quark vanilla sugar and non-instant vanilla pudding at a local German deli (Old Heidelberg if you are in the Phoenix area). I followed the recipe to the T except I added "drunk raisins" (raisins soaked in rum) to the batter as my Oma does. It was fantastic. I am so glad that I can now make the cheesecake that I previously only had on trips to Germany. Thank you!

Outstanding!!! I made it for a Oktoberfest party and everyone loved it. I'm not sure why anyone would sub cottage cheese for quark since it's not even close to it in texture or taste. It has the texture of ricotta and the taste of a light sour cream. You must use quark for this recipe to taste right. To get the nice color on top I had to cook it for an hour and twenty minutes and chilled it over night. Again great recipe!

Because the dough has so much butter in it it s not necessary to grease the springform. And if you don t have vanilla pudding mix just put cornstarch instead little less the weight of pudding mix and increase the amount of vanilla sugar.

Have not tried the recipe yet but it reads about right. I am from Germany and bake a traditional german cheesecake almost three times a month. My husband just loves his cheesecake. You all know that it is very easy to make Quark at home right? All you need is milk and some cultures an oven and a cheese cloth if you want to make a big batch at once or buttermilk and a yogurt maker for a small batch. I recommend the milk and the cultures turns out just like store bought in Germany if not better.

About as German as Cheesecake gets! DELICIOUS! I made this last night for a Company Picnic and everybody (that got a piece) loved it! When you first make the filling it seems a little runny- but don't fret it will all harden up! Also-cooktime was closer to 90 minutes at 375. But soooo good!

Amazing. I was stationed in Germany for 13 years and I loved this quark based cake but until today never tried (dared) make it for myself. Well the spirit moved me and I decided to go for it on my own. I followed this recipe to the letter and I give it 5 stars easily. The flavor is fantastic the texture is moist the lemon taste s faint yet gives it the little tart taste you expect without having to grate a lemon peel into the batter. Like others have mentioned here however 60 minutes was definitely not enough at 350 degrees not at all. Mine took a good 80-90 minutes to firm up before I pulled it out. other than adjusting the cook time this recipe is perfect. I will definitely be making this again and again.

So amazing completely authentic! Don't be concerned if it seems watery it will thicken. Also I didn't use a springform pan and it turned out fine. However I would suggest a springform pan. Don't listen to reviews of those that used cream cheese Unfair to rate something poorly because you used completely different ingredients! Lastly if there is not a German deli near you these ingredients can be purchased from Germandeli.com; also if you are feeling adventurous - make your own quark cheese!

This recipe was very good(tasted just like the German Cheesecake I remember when I lived in Germany). It was very easy to make and I was fortunate to find a dairy close to home that provided me with the Quark cheese that was needed. After tasting the Quark cheese I don't feel that you can substitute with anything else if you are going for authentic. I will make this again and again!

Wonderful recipe! I am not a big cheesecake person but this defiantly is one of my favorite things to make and eat. It is great for parties of just for fun. If you cannot find any quark use greek yogurt because it has the same frequency.

I believe there are some directions missing from this recipe. When I made this cheesecake the bake time was significantly longer than shown and the finished cheesecake was too wet. Talking with Oma I discovered that she uses cream vs. milk listed here and whips it to peak then folds it into the quark. She also uses 3 eggs in the cheesecake vs. one and two yolks shown here. I plan to redo this with the whipped cream and additional eggs. HTH!

I just made it and couldn't hardly wait to cool it. I didn't have any pudding powder so I used cornstarch about 1 heaping tbl spoon. and did not use as much milk as directed only about 1 cup milk and 1/2 cup French vanilla coffee mate. I also used 1 container 32 oz. plain Greek Yoghurt that I drained overnight over some cheesecloth for the quark. It tasted wonderful and will make again. Next time I will have the Pudding but will use Yoghurt again. It turned out great

Wonderful! Good German cheesecake. It is lighter than others I have had. Find and use quark for this recipe! It is worth it!

Nice tangy flavor. This did require 90 min to bake. I would suggest if you only like the crust on the bottom to cut those ingredients in half and do a 15 min pre-bake.

Am hesitant to say anything negative given all the praise - maybe it was the problem of my oven but it turned rather brown almost black on the surface... Tastes good otherwise but will need to make it again with something like 160 degrees Celsius as 175 turned out to be way too high at least in my oven.

I ve made this twice now. Once using Clark and once he is in mascarpone. They both turned out terrible! The cheesecake would not set up at all even though I left it in the oven for an hour longer than the recipe called for.

I went over the recipe very carefully substituted Quark for ricotta and sour cream but just wan't happy this time. Any idea what could have caused the cake to stay so liquid?

I made this as directed and it turned out perfectly. It took longer to cook than the recipe estimated though.
