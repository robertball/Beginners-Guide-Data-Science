This recipe was wonderful. However, I made one main change.  My husband is not a rice lover, so I substituted orzo pasta. For those of you who have the same situation, or for a nice change of pace, here's how:  Just use 1 cup uncooked orzo and one can of chicken broth.  No more liquid needed, and keep the rest of the recipe the same, cooking for approx. 15-20 minutes until liquid is absorbed.  The previous reviewer didn't know what to serve it with but I think any chicken recipe would do.  I made Easy Honey Mustard Chicken w/ Mozzarella and the flavors melded perfectly.  Since I was making chicken, I ignored the chicken part of this recipe, making it much less time consuming.  This was a winner!

This was simply FANTASTIC! I read the reviews and was a bit skeptical after reading the previous one but then I went ahead anyway. The flavors  blend in beautifully and everyone in my family loved it! I think you should use your judgement while preparing as it is quite a flexible dish. I added peas and julienned carrots to make it look more colorful. Its a must keep in my recipe box!

We loved this and make it weekly. The only thing I do different is add buttermilk to the marinade overnight to make it juicy. We also grill the chicken. Great recipe!

Wow, the texture and flavor of this rice is outstanding.  I did not make the chicken that goes along with the recipe.  I did not have turmeric, but just added a few dashed of curry powder and added 2 cups of chicken broth and 1/2 cup water.  Very creamy and extremely flavorful!

Great dish! I made double the amount, because I wanted to put 2 chicken breasts... and now we'll be eating it all week :) We ate it with chicken on the side, but I think it can definately be a dish on it's own. The cilantro gives it a nice light taste... we both loved it.

We absolutely loved this recipe.  It tasted like we had went out to an Indian Restaraunt.  I made curry vegetables as a side dish, even though this chicke dish is an entire meal in itself.  Thank you for sharing.

This was easy to make and was fresh tasting.  I substituted turkey for the chicken breasts and it was fine.  Served with the Beautiful Salad recipe and crusty bread for a delicious easy meal for company!

All those flavorful fresh ingredients, and this just tastes awful when it's done.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It turns out to be bitter, tasteless, moldable paste.  No one would take more than a forkful.  I am SO disappointed!  If you DO make this, be generous with the salt.

This dish tasted amazing! I have never cooked with tumeric before this and thought I would give this recipe a try, so glad I did! My husband came home from work and could smell all these wondeful flavors before he was even in the house!

This recipe was great, but I doubled the lime juice and the chicken stock... because I didn't like that there wasn't much liquid... i kind of made it into a soup. But I loved the recipe.

easy and tasty. i'm a fan of one-dish meals as i have little time to cook so instead of cooking the chicken separately i threw it in with the rice and added a little extra chicken broth. tasted wonderful!

My friends all liked this dish a bit, I wasn't so crazy about it. It was full of flavor and smelled really good but just wasn't my taste. Something was overwhelming... maybe the jalepeno? I only put a quarter of what the recipe called for since I don't handle spice all that well, and still it seemed like the jalapeno smothered the turmeric, garlic, and lime. 

It is a really pretty dish when its done, very festive and colorful.

Very flavorful but you should really like cilantro because it dominates.  Was confused by qty of chicken so I used 3 breasts and amount of marinade was good; short on time so only marinaded for a couple hours.  Made brown rice seperately & combined everything at the end, no chicken stock or bay leaf needed.  Used 1 jalapeno & left the seeds in so came out plenty spicy.  Juice from one lime wasn't enough, next time I'd use 2.  Great recipe to give boring old chicken a boost!

This dish was ok. I liked the pizzaz the cilantro brought to it but I wish I could have tasted the lime a bit more. Maybe next time I'll add in more.

I made only the rice and I added 2 more servings to the original to make it for 6 people. I was delicious! The only thing I would watch is the jalapeño. Depending on your level of tolerance I could've used 1 pepper and still had the flavor without a lot of spice.

I thought this was a pretty good dish, unfortunately the rice didn't turn out well, so that affected my rating.  Overall though the chicken was very refreshing.

YUM YUM YUM.
I loved this rice.
I just didnt know what to serve with it..I tried a pumpkin/bean/spinach coconut based curry but it didnt really match...
This might be good as a cold/warm rice salad.

Freaking love this.  I made it for dinner tonight and it's a delight.  I love the tang of the lime with the hotness of the jalapeno.  It's just wonderful.

I really enjoyed this recipe and will be making it often in the future. The only things I did differently, just to cut the cooking time down, was to use Uncle Bens Ready Rice with Brown and Wild rice. I then used just enough water and chicken stock to make it a little thinner than the consistency that I wanted (because it will thicken slightly). No need to boil the rice for the twenty some minutes. I also only used 1/2 of a lime and that was plenty since I wasn't boiling any extra off.

I thought the chicken was a little bland and the rice too. Maybe the rice should have been cooked entirely in chicken broth instead of the half and half mixture.

We did not care for this recipe.  My daughter's favorite meal is Tikka Masala and I was looking for an Indian rice dish to pair with it.  Lime, cilantro, and jalapeno do NOT work well together for my family.  15 min prep time is far underestimated.

How such tasty ingredients could combine to make such a tasteless dish.  Eatable but barely (I followed the recipe exactly). Threw the rest out. Sorry, won't be making this again.
