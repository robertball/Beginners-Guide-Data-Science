This was unlike any cornbread I've ever made. It was very dense. Not enough cornmeal or corn for flavor very plain tasting.

I read the reviews for this before I made it so I added a little bit more water and used one packet of active dry yeast. It came out quite tasty! My husband really enjoyed it and so did I. It did not however taste like traditional cornbread that I grew up with - more like regular bread with a corn twist.

Had to debate how many stars to give this. (Really debate - I kept going from 3 to 4 and back.) I made a substitution of defrosted frozen MIXED vegetables for canned corn and that worked. I also had fat-free yogurt which is probably much thicker than the normal so the dough was thicker. And it was quite an enjoyable albeit plain loaf. I think the recipe may want more water but give it a go for something different.

Very dense! I wondered if I had added the yeast? The flavor is good. I think the amount of yeast should have been 1 pkg. yeast or possibly 1 T. not 1 tsp. I used agave syrup in place of the sugar and used 1 cup whole wheat flour instead of all bread flour. I will probably make this again but will increase the amount of yeast!

I made this as written and it was okay. I felt it was a little bland for cornbread. My husband suggested it may be a good bread to use for sandwiches. In order to change this recipe to my tastes I would add more sugar more corn and/or cornmeal and swap the onion powder for garlic powder. Perhaps a bit extra salt might not hurt either.

I thought this was inedible and threw it in the trash. Dense and soggy tasteless and no amount of butter could save this and I don't waste food. Sorry.

I made this with greek yogurt I made myself and it was so moist and delicious..I really liked it a lot. I always put corn onion and jalapenos in my "cornkit" cornbread anyways...sooo good! I like the idea too of being able to make a simple great bread from scratch with both my new kitchen toys..my bread machine and yogurt maker!;) Thanks for sharing!

I was wondering about the small amount of yeast and as I started loading up the machine I realized I never looked at the comments so I made some changes on the fly. I used 2 tsp of yeast which gave me a nicely-sized loaf. I did increase water by 1/3 C but do not recommend that as it made my loaf too loose (although will probably last longer). I cook with a very fluid type of plain whole yogurt from Fiddle Creek Dairy in PA which is maybe why I didn't need the extra water or maybe just the extra yeast solves the density issue others had. I would suggest using the liquid from your canned corn to make up your 1/3 C water. I thought of this too late as I was pouring it down the drain! I upped salt to 1 tsp and sugar to almost 3 tsp (using Demerara and brown). Since I didn't have onion powder I used dried onion flakes instead. I used canned John Copes dried corn which gave it a very cornbready taste although if you're expecting typical cornbread this isn't it as it is standard bread texture due to the yeast. I found it to be very tasty and will make again with original water content as listed.

Meh. I would put it at 2.5 stars if I could. It didn't have a lot of taste as you would expect in a regular cornbread, though the onion flavor was nice. And was a little more crumbly than I would like if I were to use it as a strictly a sandwich bread. Not bad, but not great. I won't be baking it again.
