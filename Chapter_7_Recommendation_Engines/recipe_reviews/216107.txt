I can't get enough of this - it's DELICIOUS!! I used baked turkey breast instead of legs, & it's awesome. Although I think this enough to feed well over a dozen people, so i gave some to granny, college boys & friends & still had enough for the week for 2 of us.

Very good, my family loved it. I added some salt at the end, and quite a bit of black pepper.

This is pretty good.  I added carrots and fresh thyme. My potatoes were small so I used 6 small russet potatoes.   I didn't use the whole quart of light cream - just enough to get the consistancy we like.

Great recipe - I actually modified a bit to make it healthier.  Went with turkey breast instead of legs, used half the onion (just a personal preference), decreased butter to 3tbs, used fat free half-n-half and only 1/2 a quart, and added sage/parsley.  It was delicious!

You saved my bacon!!  I needed a recipe that would allow me to use only what I had on hand as I had no time to shop.  This made an awesome meal for a sick friend.  Thanks so much!!

This was an excellent recipe to make with turkey leftover from Thanksgiving.  Instead of smoked turkey legs and chicken broth, I used the leftover legs and thighs to make turkey broth, and cut up both white and dark meat turkey to add to the soup.  I also added some chopped baby carrots and minced garlic and sauteed those ingredients with the onions.  I did not feel a need to smash the vegetables with the potato masher; the tender chunks added a nice bit of texture and color to the chowder that complemented the turkey and corn.  A little dash of poultry seasoning ramped up the flavor, too!   Everyone really enjoyed this  wonderful chowder.  I will definitely be making it again.

This is a delicious and different take on Thanksgiving leftovers. Definitely helped me use up that leftover turkey! Great when garnished with a little parsley and shredded cheese of your choice.

This was a good soup, though a little bland.  I did substitute 1% milk for the cream due to diet restrictions, and had to add some thyme.  A pinch of ground red pepper helped, too.  This is a great way to use up leftover smoked turkey.

Love this recipe. Added celery and carrots,and used chicken stock not broth but didn't add the light cream, husband doesn't like it, still mashed all the veggies and potatoes, then let it sit on low in a dutch oven pot stirring occasionally. Huge hit!!!
