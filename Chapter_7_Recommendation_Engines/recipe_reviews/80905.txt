Me, hubby and 3 kids really enjoyed this dish. I did change a few things. I browned the boneless chops in butter and salt and pepper. I used frozen green beans, and I used cream of mushroom soup, which I added salt and pepper to while heating up with the sour cream. The chops were a bit bland, but the cream sauce was very yummy over our jasmine rice! Next time, I'll season chops a little more, but will definitely make this again!

It was cool to see this recipe.  My mother in law gave me the recipe over twenty years ago. I've been making ever since, It's been a favorite of my family. I use cream of mushroom soup instead. And pre cook the sauce ingrediants on stove top first, I add about 3/4 cup of milk too to thin out a bit. The sauce just runs and melts into the beans and tots. Very yummy!! It's very quick and easy, great for a work night. Always a hit.

I made this recipe for dinner last night.  It was very tasty.  I used Tater Tots with Onions, because that is what I had on hand.  I did have to bake it on 375 for about 15 additional minutes.  
Also, next time I make this I am thinking of adding French's Fried Onions.

Okay, we tried it once with the recipe as written, it was okay, pretty bland for us.  So I made some adjustments and it was a little better.  I think with a little more tweeking it can be an awesome meal. The second time I made it, I sliced potatoes really thin and layered them on the bottom of my casserole dish.  As I layered them I put salt and pepper on them.  Then I put the green beans, and next the chops ( I seasoned with garlic and onion poweder, salt and pepper before I browned).  Next I put the sour cream mixture to which I mixed sauteed onions.  Next I topped with stuffing mix.  I cooked 30 minutes covered, then uncovered and cooked an additional 30 minutes.  This was much better than the first try, but it still needs something.  So I think next time I will either go 1 1/2 to 2 times the sour cream mixture and add some to the layer of potatoes.  Plus I think I will season the meat a little more.  I will post next time I make and let you know if its any better.  There's just something missing and I can't put my finger on it LOL

Sorry, this was awful. I followed the directions word for word. It needs more spices than just salt and pepper, it was very bland. I thought this would be good because I like all the ingredients that the recipe called for, but they just did not work well together.

This recipe was awesome!  I made a few changes.  I used 2 cans of cut green beans instead of the french style.  I also used cream of mushroom instead of celery soup.  After browning the pork chops, I deglazed the pan with some cooking sherry and then added it to the soup and sour cream.  I baked it at 400 for 45 minutes.  My family loved it.

This recipe is pretty good.  I had to add a little more oil to the frying pan when browning the chops.  I also added a little garlic salt to the chops when browning.

This was pretty good, but I did have to make a few changes. Like other reviewers I season the heck out of this, I used, Season salt, Garlic powder, Chopped onion, Celery salt, Pepper, and seasoned every layer. I also seasoned the chops as I cooked them first almost all the way threw. I also seasoned the soup/sour cream mixture. It turned out pretty good, my kids wanted shredded cheese on it,and they loved it with the cheese.  I also had to bake it for about 50 minutes.

I made this dish so many times when my son was young - he loved it.  I always made it with cream of mushroom soup and cut green beans drained well.  Make sure you season the tater tots well - onion powder, garlic pepper, salt - use your imagination.  Also season the chops - again use what you like.  Heat the soup/sour cream mix in the pan you used to saute the chops and I add some parsley.  I doubt you will find this bland if you try these tips.  Great leftovers too.  I always made this with 6 chops and they fit just fine.

This has turned out to be a family favorite. The only thing I did different is season the pork chops with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I sliced a small onion very thin and sauted it in the pan the pork chops were in and combined the soup and sour cream in there as well.  Then add it to the dish.

This recipe was ok. I thought that it wasnt bad but the kids really weren't impressed with it. I did make some changes. Instead of tater tots I used crinkle fries and instead of cream of celery I used cream of mushroom. We also didn't use the green beans because my kids don't care for those. Surprisingly, this dish was a bit bland. I did make sure to take special care and use spices but that really didn't seem to help. My son liked the cream whereas my daughter didn't. I did also smother the chops with onions which the kids seemed to enjoy. I don't think that I will be making this one again.

This was great! I did add garlic powder to the soup mixture. And it did need to cook longer. after 1/2 hour I took the foil off and cooked another 15 min. at 400 degrees.
My family loved it and will make again.

I tried this with boneless pork chops and it didn't really go over well.  The sauce was too loose - milk? Sorry, but it just didn't work for me.

Good basic recipe, but I did alter a lot.  I cut servings in half but still used a whole can of green beans.  Added a tablespoon of milk to the sauce.  Seasoned chops with Montreal Spicy Steak Seasoning and minced garlic while browning.  Added garlic powder, dried minced onion, a worcestershire sauce to the sauce made with cream of mushroom garlic.  We loved it.

I followed recipe exactly using boneless chops.  I liked the gravy with the tater tots, but I cooked for 30 min. and chops were not done and rest of casserole was still cold in spots.  I put it back in the oven, but the chops although hot were tough.  Would never make again.  Much better chops recipes out there.

This was a definite hit with my family, with a few 'on hand' alterations;  I substituted canned New Whole Potatoes, well drained, for the tots, and whole green beans, drained, for the french cut.  Dilled Sour Cream was used instead of the plain, and also cream of mushroom soup for celery. So many substitutes, it may qualify as a new recipe, but I give the author all the credit for the initial assemblage! Thank you very much!

I made a few changes which helped.  I added garlic powder (from another review who suggested that), I added cheddar cheese to the top, and I put some stovetop dressing on the top.  Thanks for the recipe!

First I want to thank the author of recipe. However I had to make changes because I don't buy tator tots, so I did what another reviewer did. Place a layer of potatoes, with some carrots, then used frozen green beans. Seasoned salt, oregano , I did the salt, pepper, garlic, olive oil and chops. They turned out great.  Placed them over vets and then poured over the celery soup and sour cream, I did have to cook them longer than stated, but that could be my oven, for 40 mins. Result was absolutely DELICIOUS  !!!! 
Am taking leftovers for my lunch today, wish I would have made more. I used 3chops.

Very good.  Did have to add more spices and I'm glad I did!!  Would have been very bland without the extra spices.  Just opened up the cupboard and pulled out what sounded good!!

Been eating this since I was a kid. Had my mom forward me the recipie and made it for my husband, he refers it to "crack on a plate." We love it!! 
Only thing my family does different is that we add the sour cream and cream of celery to the pan the porkchops were in, instead of in a seperate bowl. Creates one less dish, and it gets all the good stuff off the bottom of the pan. :)

It's been an 45 minutes and my pork chops are not even cooked they are still pink.. I should of read the reviews and cooked it at 400 instead of 350 . I guess I'm complaining more because I am really hungry waiting on food.

My family requests this recipe frequently, even my 84 year old grandma loves it :) I do add french fried onions between the green beans and the sauce and then another layer on top for the last 10 minutes uncovered so they get crispy.

A meal-in-one that I will make again. The changes I made: 1.Used cut green beans 2.Seasoned pork chops with Creole seasoning in addition to the salt and pepper; Also added a little Montreal Steak Seasoning 3.Added about 1/4 cup water to the soup/sour cream mixture 4.Poured half of the soup mixture over the vegetables, then topped with chops and poured the other half over them and 5.Baked for more than 30 minutes-about an hour.

This was pretty tasty! I didn't have green beans or cream of celery so I used peas and cream of chicken. I also chopped up the pork after browning and mixed it all together. It took me about 50 minutes to cook. We will be having this again.

This was delicious! Of course, I made some changes that made it great for us. We omitted the green beans and added French's fried onions on top. It was excellent! My kids gobbled it up.

I thought this recipe sounded pretty strange when I read it but I wanted to try it anyway. It was actually pretty good. I think it is hard to go wrong with tater tots and cream soup. Not my personal favorite but very kid friendly.

I wasn't too sure about this recipe when I first saw it, but I was tired of the same old pork chops. This was very easy and my family loved it. It is the only way my son will eat grean beans!

My husband and 9 year old son loved this recipe. It was great and simple- took a little longer to cook in the oven than I thought it would. But, I liked it so much I gave it to all my friends at work!

My husband loved this recipe. I thought it tasted great, but I did make a few changes. I added two tsps. of soy sauce and a couple of dashes of oregano to the cream of celery mixture. This added a nice flavor. I also let the pork chops cook in the frying pan until they were almost cooked through so that they wouldn't be pink. I cooked the entire dish for 40 minutes also. I will make this dish many times in the future, it is now a family favorite!

It was edible. Very blah. Husband said it tasted like military food. I used frozen hash browns instead of tater tots otherwise I pretty much followed the recipe. Also added milk like a previous poster said. I cooked for 40 minutes and my pork chops were still pink. I won't make this again.

I loved this recipe. I did do a lot of tweeking to it though. I got the ideas for the tweekings from the other reviews about this dish. I kept the celerysoup that was on the recipe. I made the sauce on the stove first and I added garlic, chopped onions, portwine (could be any red wine) for flavor and a little bit of soysauce. I did skip the potatoes in the casserole and made jasmine rice on the side. My family loved it. Thank you for a great recipe.

Needed lots of seasoning but was great.  Used Season Crinkle fries and seasoned the chops with Garlic Salt and pepper.

A bit bland and tasteless. The recipe has promise though. I'll add some different spices next time and see how it turns out.

FOR ENGLISH PEOPLE: Tater-tots are miniature potato croquettes!

A big Thank You to the movie Napoleon Dynamite for revealing this. We can't buy them here in England.

I hate celery soup, but I loved this.

My family loves this!!  All I did different was brown chops w/no oil on non stick griddle and add a little grated cheese!!  I found this a few months ago using ingredient search and have made it about twice a month since...If they ask for it, they'll eat it up!!

The sauce wasn't very flavorful and a little too tangy with the rest of the ingredients.
