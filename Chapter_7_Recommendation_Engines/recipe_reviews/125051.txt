I made this for a family picnic and everyone loved it.  I did make a couple changes:  added a capful of lemon extract to the cream cheese layer & used 2 c. real whipped cream (whipped w/vanilla & about 1/2 C sugar).  My hubby loved this one, too, and he's not a sweet eater.

This was good, alot like lemon meringue pie without the meringue.  I don't know what the purpose of the vinegar is but I'll probably leave it out next time.  It gives it a wierd taste.

Everyone gathers at our house for Sunday dinner and dad's favorite dessert WAS lemon meringue pie - he raved about this and said we could have it every Sunday. I followed the exact recipe and have no problem with the vinegar, although I think the recipe should specify WHITE vinegar, this is what I used and there is no weird smell or taste. The vinegar helps with the tartness without making it too tart. I will definitely make it again.

I loved this recipe.  It makes you go "ummmm" 
I didn't have lemon extract, so just used grated lemon peel from the fresh lemons in the cream cheese layer and the lemon layer.
I also used 2 cups whipped cream instead of the whipped topping. I added about 1/2 c. sugar to the cream while beating it to a stiff texture.
I used about 2 tsp vinegar and used fresh lemon juice in place of the required amount of vinegar.
A really good dessert and it freezes well too!

This is a wonderful, delicious dessert.  A little like lemon meringue pie but w/o the meringue.  Very similar to a pie at a famous pie restaurant called "Lemon Pie Supreme", but I don't think they make it anymore.  Too bad, but this is a good substitute.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful.  Note that it's white vinegar - smells funny while cooking, but no taste or smell when done.  Rave reviews from my bridge club.

I needed something to make for an office luncheon.  I went onto Allrecipes.com and the first lemon dessert was submitted by someone in Wills Point Texas which is where I live.  I was a little worried about the vinegar in the recipe.  I could smell it, but no one else could.  Time consuming to make but well worth it.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.

I make a very similiar version with the following changes.  I use 2 pkgs instant lemon pudding, mixed with 2 1/2 cups WHOLE milk. (makes a stiffer lemon filling) Also, I add just one cup whipped topping with the cream chese and sugar, and put the rest on top of the lemon.  Everyone always requests this.

This is a fabulous dessert - I made it for Christmas dinner, and everyone loved it.  I made a couple of changes, used a graham wafer crust,  didn't use as much vinegar as called for, only a couple of teaspoons, added the difference in lemon juice.  Also used lemon zest instead of the lemon extract - gave it a nice, tart flavor in contrast with the cream cheese layer.  I'll make this again and again!

My new fave dessert! I used low fat cream cheese, added lemon rind to the cream cheese and meringue layers, and folded frozen blueberries into cream cheese layer after folding in the light coolwhip.....sooooooo delicious! Set perfectly and didn't last long. Also cut a lot of the sugar out.

I would cut back on the sugar in the lemon topping the next time as it seemed a bit too sweet.  Other than that it was very good.

I love anything with lemon in it, and this was pretty good.  Since I prefer things pretty tart, this was a little too sweet for me.  Next time, I'm going to reduce the powdered sugar to 1 c. and the white sugar to 1-1/2 c.  Will let you know how it turns out.

This was a wonderful pie although it took quite a long time to make. I presented it to my family when I was doing a 3 coursed meal and just managed to scoop it onto their plates and put it in the fridge before the top layer started to run over the sides. Very tasty though! Will have to find a way of stiffening the top layer. Any ideas?

A very tasty dessert.  I like the suggestion to make in a springform pan; will try next time.  Definitely takes time (make a layer, cool it, make a layer, chill it...).  Like others I worried about the vinegar b/c the filling smelled strong even after cooking but it did vanish entirely on the dessert.
