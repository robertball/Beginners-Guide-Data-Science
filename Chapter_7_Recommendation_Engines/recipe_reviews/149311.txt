Surprisingly delicious!  It's a wonderful blend of the saltiness of the seasonings, sweetness of the berry juices, and tartness of the whole berries.  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks!

These were simple enough to make. This is an interesting combination of flavors. I used wild blackberries. I really ended up eating around the berries which weren't all that sweet. The beans were very tasty, though.

My family did not like all of the oregano and the mixture of the blackberries. Also, we had to steam longer than recipe called for. Sounded like it could have been a great recipe, but we will not be making this again.

Just made this dish and WOW!! I would never have dreamed of this combo. I only had raspberries which probably made it a little sweeter. I forgot to add the celery powder, used just a dash of onion powder and added fresh pressed garlic which I see now isn't even in the recipe, and added butter. Regardless of changes it was simply divine!
