As written, the proportions of the ingredients are off. But by fixing the proportions, this came out fabulous for me. Use the amount of scallops, tomato, avocado and olive oil that the recipe calls for. Use 1/2 of a small onion instead of green onions, 1/4 cup cilantro, juice of one lime (mine yielded almost 1/4 cup), 1/2 tsp salt. Of course, the amount of red pepper depends on personal taste. I used one small, fresh medium-heat chili pepper. My hubbie and I loved it.

Not sure if I would make it again or not but wasn't bad. I did not have tomotoes and Cilantro is not one of my favorite spices so I used some Salsa in place of. I also added some fresh Maine Shrimp.

This was delicious! I took mrs. kosmos advice and cut down on the amount of cilantro and lime juice. I used 1/4 cup cilantro and 3 tablespoons lime juice. I also cut back on the hot pepper flakes. Will definitely make again!

My family loved this recipe.  It is a great way to make scallops different.  This goes great as a side "salad" with fish or a great lunch just by itself.

i really didn't like this. the cilantro was way too overpowering. i think a teaspoon of it would be plenty. the flavors just didn't blend well together.

I made this exactly as written and it was excellent. My guests wanted more the next day and the recipe to take home. I will definitely make this again, but, my personal preference will be to cut back on the cilantro next time. I find cilantro to be a very strong flavor and it just overpowered the other flavors in my opinion.

My family absolutely love this recipe. I did not find the cilantro or lime juice too much. I actually used a full bunch of cilantro and 3 medium sized fresh squeezed limes.  We love scallops but shrimp would definitely be a great substitute especially to keep the seafood smell out of the fridge and kitchen. Served this as a side with Beef Bolgogi on a bed of rice.

Boy, am I glad I took the recommendation of other reviewers to cut back on the lime juice!  I used only 3 tbsp (vs 6 in the recipe) but even at that, next time I'll use a max of 2 tbsp., maybe even less.  I added some salt and I might consider a dash of sugar next time to take the edge off the lime juice.  I did not use cilantro - I detest it. I served this on a bed of finely chopped lettuce.
