I’d give this a 5 for taste and a 2 for the recipe as written because I think there’s something wrong.  Since the recipe doesn’t say if the can of corn should be drained, I used it with the liquid.  What I ended up with was a bowl of batter that ran all over the place when dropped onto the griddle (threw the first batch out).  I used a box of Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix which is 8.5 oz.  The recipe calls for 6.5 oz of cornbread mix, so I measured it out on the scale.  I ended up adding the rest of the Jiffy mix hoping to thicken it...still runny.  I think you either need to cut the milk in half (at least) if you’re not draining the can of corn and if you use Jiffy, use the entire pkg, or simply drain the corn.   The consistency of the pancake was almost like a crepe, and I would have preferred something a bit thicker.  On the positive side, they are very tasty, easy to make, and I do think it’s worth trying again.  Just use your best judgment on the consistency of the batter.

When ever you use jiffy mix you need to let it set for 5 minutes before frying.

Delicious! I made as directed, drained the corn, used Jiffy mix which is a little larger than the recipe states so I thought the consistency was perfect after letting it “bloom” for a few minutes. I threw in some blueberries which were a great addition. Definitely adding this recipe to the weekend rotation.

I made this recipe and it was very easy and quick. I did substitute unsweetened almond milk instead of regular milk and I use less oil and use butter cooking spray.

Awesome recipe! It was a little runny I just added some corn meal to bring it to the right consistency I also added some salt and served it with an herb butter that rocked!! Also serving it with some syrup or honey butter would be great as well!
