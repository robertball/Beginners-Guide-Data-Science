Delish! I skipped the pie dough recipe and used a frozen pie shell. Deep dish a must! I also did not layer it. Followed directions until filling the crust. Just mixed all the ingredients in a bowl and poured into a frozen pie crust. Baked for 50 mins on 325. Perfect! I would not add any more ingredients for filling the quiche (mushrooms, broccoli, etc) as one tends to do in a quiche. There is no room at the Inn. This filling fills a deep dish pie shell as is.

What is not to like - cheese, bacon & cream along with onion and you have a match made in heaven.  Warning!  Use a Deep Dish pie pan - or all the filling will not fit.  Also, you must let quiche cool to fully set.   This a classic recipe with a really good method.

Yummy!!!! :) This was the first time I ever made quiche and I was a little nervous about it but I had company over and wanted to make something different. This is a fabulous recipie. I used parmesan and herb seasoning instead of thyme and colby jack cheese instead of Gruyere because that's what I had on hand and it was scrumptious. Made my crust which I just poked holes with a fork in the crust then simply baked it for 10 min. (blind bake thing too much bother). Fried my bacon and onion, mixed up my eggs, put it all in the fridge and it took 2 minutes to assemble and pop in the oven in the morning! Definitly a keeper!!

Wonderful! The first time I made it is was very good, but the 2nd time I watched the video and what a difference.WOW! The tips he gives in the video you can't get from the recipe only. I don't like watching videos but this was a must for me. I get the difference now,from a dense eggy quiche which can still be tasty but Chef John's true quiche is  a  custardy flavorful delight, a taste to behold!

I've made Quiche Lorraine for at least 30 years from the recipe in the big Betty Crocker cookbook.  I didn't think there was a better one until I tried Chef John's.  The biggest difference was the addition of leeks and using Gruyere cheese.  I used an applewood smoked Gruyere which gave it even more flavor.  I'm not going to look any further.  This is my "go to" Quiche Lorraine recipe  A couple of people didn't like the mouth feel of this quiche, but that is what really good quiche is supposed to be like.  It's the cream.

I made this quiche, as laid out in the recipe, for my husband last night (I'm a pescatarian, so I made mine with veggies instead). It was my first time making a quiche. He really liked it. He ate half of the quiche in two helpings last night and ate the other half for brunch today. It always gets me giddy when his mouth is filled with something I've just made and he gets that, "Da*n this is good," look on his face. Such a reward :) So...this was a success and I'll be making it again. I'm such a visual/"in motion" kind of learner, so, as someone who is just starting out with cooking, watching the video, as well as having the written recipe, really helps me. Thank you!!!

The good points-the flavor combo is good, the layering & ladling made for a perfect distribution of ingredients, & it looked very pretty(fitting PERFECTLY into the crust, too). The bad points-my crisp cooked bacon ended up chewy. The texture of the quiche is way too soft for me, I actually gagged on my 2nd bite, this after letting it rest 2 hrs out of the oven. The next day it's a little more firm but still too mushy for my taste. IDK, more eggs or less milk(or both)?? Sorry, Chef John. Not a hit here :(

Fantastic recipe! I didn't follow it to the T, as I have a bad habit of speed reading and not necessarily catching all the details. I substituted onion for spring onion as had a lot of the latter growing in the garden. Then mixed the bacon together with the onion-leek mix which turned out fine. We didn't fill the mixture to the top of the dish as we were afraid it would overflow, but now realised we should've as the centre mix will sink a bit as it cools, so next time we will make sure to fill it right to the top. We also made the pie dough and for a first timer, who wasn't too fussed with specific weights/measurements, it turned out fine. I was actually quite surprised how well it turned out and am sure will be making more pie crusts in future instead of going to the supermarket. Highly recommended - I would make this dish again!

A wonderful recipe! Watch the video, do exactly what he did, it makes a difference. I brought this to work and it was a big hit.  It was pretty simple too.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I will make this again :)

This is by far the best quiche I have ever tasted.  I was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews and seeing people describe the texture as soft or loose.  When I think of soft or loose eggs I envision runny egg whites which I agree are gross, but the texture of this quiche is NOT loose like an undercooked egg, it's smoother like a cream cheese.  I made it exactly as written...no substitutes and no omissions.  I did; however, use Applewood smoked Gruyere.  Everything went together quickly and after watching the video (which was quite helpful), the ingredients were perfectly distributed throughout.  My daughter took the inaugural first bite and her expression said it all...it's a winner!  Thanks, Chef John, for a fantastic addition to my recipe file.

Made it for family Christmas brunch and it was excellent. You are right about the custardy texture! The only observation is that mine took almost an hour at 325, which meant it couldn't cool as long as recommended the way I'd planned.

I've made Quiche Lorraine for many years and have NEVER had one as incredibly delicious as this one.  The crust also from Chef John is wonderfully flaky.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Marry me!

I really loved this quiche! The layering tip was fool proof. I used a frozen pie crust and forgot to buy deep dish so instead I used 3 whole eggs, all of the milk and 1/4 cup of table cream. I also added spinach and mushrooms and beef pepperoni in place of the bacon. Although it took more than a hour in the oven. I suggest baking in a 375 degree oven instead. Overall, It was delicious!

This was fabulous.  I made it for a birthday luncheon.  I used a Pillsbury refrigerated roll out pie crust and did not prebake it.  I coated the crust with an egg white to keep the filling from making it soggy.  I also was short a pie pan so I used a tart pan with a removable bottom.  The quiche came out thinner, more like a tart, but it was very pretty when removed from the tart pan and since it is so rich anyway, the thinner sections were just right when served with other dishes.
I used defrosted, moisture squeezed from frozen sliced leeks (from Trader Joe's) and about a tsp (or to taste) of dried thyme instead of fresh.  I've made many quiches but never a Quiche Lorraine and I will definitely make this again.

I have many quiche recipes but I just tried this one for the first time and it is the best of all of them! Chef John's video on how to make it was helpful, especially the technique on making the crust lie flat.  It was a huge hit here in Europe. It is not dry like scrambled eggs thrown in a pie shell but moist. I adjusted the recipe for 8 people and used 4 eggs and one egg yolk. The flavor is delicate and it is rich, fulfilling.

Made this recipe exactly as stated, and it was perfect.  My very picky five year old loved it, as did my whole family.  I used an already-made frozen pie crust, and followed Chef John's instructions to a "T".  I will be making this again.  Thank you again Chef John for another terrific recipe!

Custardy perfection! Oh my! I had to keep myself from eating the entire quiche in one sitting! The video demonstration was great! This was actually my first time making a quiche and I think it turned out perfect because I watched the video. Thanks Chef John!

Giving 4 stars because the filling was very soft/loose and I followed as written. I made the day before and seemed firm when removed from oven, no jiggles in center. Next morning sliced and heated in microwave. The slices were firm when I sliced from the frig, but after reheating in microwave they became very mushy. Taste was very good, though! Don't know what went wrong as far as the texture goes :(

This recipe really impressed my family. I even impressed myself! It was creamy, bacony heaven in a pie shell. I cheated and used a frozen, ready made pie shell that said deep dish, well, it wasn't! So, I just mixed all the ingredients together and divided them between the two pie shells. I baked for the same amount of time suggested and each pie was just as delicious as the last! Do yourself a favor and make this!

Fry and chop bacon the night before. As well as make and roll out pie crust the night before and refrigerate. The rest comes together in no time the next day. Really delicious. Very rich, but very good.

I used a pre-made pie crust but otherwise followed the recipe. My boyfriend and roommate ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! This was my first attempt at a quiche and I'm very pleased with this recipe--making a quiche turned out to be much easier than I had expected (pie crust aside) and everyone in the house just wants to finish eating all the rest of it now. Highly recommend!

Made this for my little sister's baby shower and it was delicious! Since I was making 5 quiches, I realized that I needed to leave the weights in the pie shell for the entire 12 minutes of blind baking - otherwise, part of the side started to shrink down and the bottom began to puff up.  Agree that the ladling technique (Chef John talks about it in the video for this recipe too) make a BIG difference.  If you just pour the egg/milk mixture over the filling, it will all sink to the bottom of the quiche  Ladling the eggs/milk ensures that you have filling in each bite.  Delicious!

Oh my! First time I made a quiche. It turned out to be easy and delicious. Perfect texture. The custard consistency is brilliant. As our luncheon guest, a former ambassador said, "It couldn't be farther from the kind you buy in the store. Whatever you did, keep on doing it. And can I have a second helping."  Many thanks.

I used 4 whole eggs and 1/2 cup milk.  It turned out very well.  Otherwise I stuck to the recipe.  Will make this again.

Ugh. Too wet. This consistency might work well with a sweet pie like coconut or ? But, wet eggs. We tasted it , put it back in for 10 more min. Still like eating mushy raw eggs. Note to self: Do Not try a new recipe for guests !! Good thing we had lots of croissants.

This turned out amazing! I used a frozen crust ( convenient but I probably will make from scratch next time ), also used a sweet onion in place of the onion/leek mixture, but aside from that followed the recipe as written. The pie crust definitely needs to be deep - I had some mixture left over, and the cooking time in my oven was about an hour. The texture of the custard and the combination of flavors made this recipe one that I will be making again very soon! Not a crumb was left over. The technique in the video was also very good - all of the ingredients are evenly distributed throughout the quiche so you  get a taste of each ingredient in every bite. So so yummy!

I have made many quiches; not one was good. Some were barely edible. They were solid, hard masses of egg.., studded with stuff. This quiche was different. It was silky,  with delicious added ingredients that enhanced the custard. It was not difficult to make, but kind of time consuming (because I’m always slow the first time I try a new recipe).  I’m sure I’ll be making  this often!

Being a vegetarian, I altered this recipe a little (substituted soy-based "bacon" for real, and one chipotle pepper and 1/2 cup peas for leeks, and used 1/2 Swiss & 1/2 Pepper Jack)...it came out amazing! The absolute best! Since my pie crust wasn't deep enough I made a sort of soufflé with the extra milk and eggs - layered with onion, spinach, tomatoes, cheddar and shaved Parmesan. That was phenomenal as well! Thanks for sharing this great (and versatile) recipe!!!

Perfect and only 2 tiny changes:  I used a frozen deep dish crust and had to bake it for an hour to get the center done.  This was so tasty and authentic.  Easy to make too!

This quiche is amazing!!! I didn't wanna go through the hassle of making bacon so I used chopped ham. I also made it a second time and used crab with some seafood seasoning. Both were amazing! Thanks chef john!

First of all, I must admit that I love Chef John's recipes!   I made this with all organic ingredients and a store bought pie crust.  The quiche was way way out of this world delicious.   Fresh farm eggs, fresh cream, yum!   But don't cheap out and buy a crust....make a crust.  The store bought crusts are always horrible!

This is the best quiche recipe I have ever made. I served it to a group of 8 women who could not stop raving. The tip on how to bake a prepackaged pie crust was a life saver as I ran out of time. It was so flakey no one could believe I didn't make it from scratch. I also made another quiche where I substituted spinach for the bacon and kept everything else the same. Also wonderful. Great video!!

Amazing flavor and consistency. I like that the bacon wasn't too crunchy or soft and the sautéed onions and leeks added so much flavor. Will make again and again.

I made this Quiche today and followed the directions to a "T", which I seldom do. It was perfect in every way, taste, texture, presentation, I just can't say enough, add to that, it's easy to make.  This will be the Quiche for special occasions, or any occasion.  Thank you Chef John. mscacoker.

I liked it and would give it four stars, but my husband and three kids did not like it and said two stars.  My husband does not like quiche to begin with and this didn't change his mind.  The flavor was good, but the texture was not quite for me.  The initial bite was a bit of a surprise because it was the texture of custard.  The quiches I have had before are a bit firmer.   Once I adapted to the texture, I enjoyed it more.

I will never make 'quiche' without custard again!! Quiche without the custard tastes like a baked omelette, as other reviewers mentioned, this recipe is something totally different than frittata like 'quiche' recipes. I used a frozen pie crust because I had one but everything else followed exactly. The creaminess of the Gouda and custard is perfect, make sure to layer. I used sliced Gouda and it was perfect. I baked for 52 minutes on the middle rack and had the pie tin on an insulated cookie sheet. Obviously this is more calorie dense than just egg for daily breakfasts but for Sunday brunch it's awesome!

This was a lot of work for a gooey, not quite set quiche.  The only change I made was using swiss cheese but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I guess I like my quiche a little more firm so I'll go back to my regular recipe.  Sorry, Chef John, I've loved all your other recipes, just not this one.

Made this quiche for family visiting on Thanksgiving morning. It was my first quiche ever so I was a little nervous to try it out on house guests but I followed the recipe exactly and it came out dee-lish!!! My family was raving about it and it was still super yummy the following day. Easy and flavorful. You can't lose on this one. However.....use a deep dish pie crust.  This made a ton. Thanks for my new go to recipe :)

Wonderful.  First homemade quiche that does not taste like a dense omlet.  It's texture was really fluffy.  I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk, because I only had skim milk.  I also used the video recipe for this recipe and it REALLY helped me figure out how to determine when the quiche was done.  I did, however,  failed to use a deepdish pie pan, so I did not add all of the egg mixture, as it would have run over.  I will not make that mistake again.

What can I say, this was easy and fabulous. I was timid to use fresh thyme and leeks because I had never done either before. But it was easy and the video was great. For me, actions (video) are better than words (reading) :)

I made a few modifications to work with what I had in the kitchen and it still turned out fantastic!  I used Puff Pastry out of the freezer and did not have Gruyere or Swiss either so used Havarti with just a small amount of blue cheese and the flavor was wonderful.  Also did not pre-cook the leeks first and they cooked just fine in the oven.  I added fresh sliced mushrooms to the bottom along with the onion mixture and that did cause the crust to be soggy, so next time I will still be adding the mushrooms but will put them on the very top.  Definitely worth a repeat!

Made this today for a shower.  I’ve never made a quiche before, eaten some but never made one.  Followed the directions as written and watched the video.  Turned out perfect, great flavor, very creamy!  I’ll actually make this again since the first one was so successful!  Thank you Chef John??

I was short on time Christmas morning, so I used store-bought pie crust.  I also added 6 sliced baby Bella mushrooms to the onions and leeks and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  My family said it was the best quiche ever.  We loved it!   I made it again for New Year's Day morning!

Zero Taste.  Too little cheese for the amount of eggs.  Crust recipe is good and easy.  
This is the first Chef John recipe that I haven't loved.  
Truly disappointed.

I used this as a "base" recipe to use up some leftover ham instead of bacon.The overall recipe was good and more like custard than scrambled eggs as Chef John says. I will definitely make this again

THE quiche. Delicious.
Made as written the first time, and subbed out 2 cups 1/2 and 1/2 the next time, it was just as good.
Great base recipe for the 'clean out the refrigerator' odds and ends. You know what was tasty? The (already baked) acorn squash half, peeled and cubed. Who would have thought.

A very rich, very tasty quiche.  I liked the use of leeks in the recipe and might have used even more. I did make the  mistake of using the recommended pie crust. Perhaps because my only pie pan large enough was a ceramic one, the sides of the crust melted down, making it unusable. My feeling is that the crust is too buttery and rich for such a rich quiche. I had to switch to a store bought crust. Luckily, it saved the day.

I made it exactly as instructed except for  ready pie crust. Since box came with 2 , I doubled ingredients and made 2. They were both so delicious and my family loved it and now want me to make more soon. I was so pleased as it was my first attempt at quiche.

BEST SAVORY CREAMY QUICHE EVER.  I could eat this quiche for breakfast lunch and dinner.  Having overnight guests?   I've made this quiche the day before guests arrive for an easy breakfast the next day.  Remarks on the quiche is "The BEST every" every time.  NOTE:  I only had a runny quiche once.  Taking it out of the oven has to be when there is no giggle and the top is golden brown.

Chef John's recipes are always robust, hearty, delicious versions of classic recipes. This one is no exception. I serve it to overnight guests, who always love it. I have no trouble substituting some things I have on hand like green onions or chopped spinach for leeks, swiss cheese for gruyere and half and half for milk and cream if necessary. Because I use a deep dish pan and due to previous comments, I add one whole egg to the egg total. I also like to turn up the heat for a few minutes at the end to help brown the top.

Excellent flavor! I had a couple of leeks in my CSA box and did an ingredient search and this popped up! I didn't have any cream, just used whole milk, I only had 4 eggs so just used the whole thing instead of separating. I used both of the leeks I had (1 large, 1 small) so I used alot more than 1/2 cup. I used a already prepared pie crust. I also used a combination of cheddar, Parmesan and Asiago cheese. It was what I had.  I like the layering, just came out perfect! I had to bake an extra 10 min for high altitude. Thank You Chef John!

It might get 5 stars next time. I used a frozen pie crust (and so I'm not reviewing based on a crust) that said it was deep dish, but it still did not hold everything. So we put all the liquid bit in but it wouldn't hold all the cheese. As a result even after cooking through and safely, and being cooled it was still a bit "loose"...so next time I'm going to try my favorite home-made butter crust and use a quiche or springform type pan, and make the crust deeper with straight edges. Flavor was excellent. Folk very much liked it and it got eaten all up so my critique is only due to the above and user error.

Last night, I made this for dinner as a sort of last minute idea. Though I hadn’t planned it, I had the ingredients, a prebaked pie crust, and 1.5 hrs before dinner. It didn’t take all that long to prep it, and I let it bake for 50 minutes instead of 40-45, then waited for it to cool for about 20 minutes while I made a salad. At first, I thought I had too much filling for my crust, but it just fit—I agree with others that a deeper dish pie crust works better. It turned out great! It’s been an age since I last baked a quiche, so I was worried about how it’d turn out. My husband and kids loved it, and I have to agree it was very good! I’ll make it again for sure.

Amazing! I think your pastry dough is a must do and worked great with this dish. 

Did everything as per directions. Layering as per video (different to written instructions). I let the big fella sit for an hour to an hour and a half before dinner and the custard was perfect. 

The next day I used the other half of the dough and made little muffin tin quiches. I used half of the egg custard recipe and mixed in a handful each of parmesan and mozzarella and some frozen kale (defrosted and de-juiced) 

And that was delicious too!! My husband said that he liked the pastry to filling ratio

Made as directed, but used a frozen deep-dish pie crust pre-baked for 10 minutes.  Simply decadent.  (Leeks are a vastly underused ingredient!)  The video is a must-watch.

This was a lusciously creamy quiche, which needed slightly longer cooking in my oven.  I used bacon, onion, and Emmental/cheddar in one, and made a traditional quiche Lorraine (ham/Emmental) in the other.  Both were equally delicious. Will definitely make again!

Made for my mom and I to enjoy on Easter Sunday. Used a frozen deep dish pie shell and layered ingredients versus just mixing all together/dumping into crust. It turned out great and we had a great meal.

Who said real men don't eat quiche?  I made this for a large group on a weekend getaway and one of the guys said it was the"best quiche he had ever eaten".  This turned out perfect.  I made it without the pie crust because of some GF people in the group. No pie crust needed.  This is a keeper in my favorites.

Came out very good.  I used a refigerator crust, which was fine, I just didn't realize you had to poke holes in it when you baked it empty to keep it from bubbling.

My quiche came out great and I will definitely make this again. I made 2 minor changes and it was still delicious. I used swiss cheese instead of Gruyere and added 1 cup of quick sauted spinach. I was also short on time, so I mixed my bacon/onion/spinach mixture into the cheese, put it all into the pie crust, and then poured the egg mixture into the dish very slowly. I needed 55 minutes to cook it, but mine was not jiggly as others reported. I served it for a brunch and they demolished it!!:D

We loved this! My husband had previously said he didn't like quiche, but he had seconds. Very velvety texture. Tip: After sauteeing your onion/leek mixture, add some chicken broth to the pan to de-glaze. Store in a jar and you've got the start of a great pan sauce for the next day.

I’m one who will make the recipe as written the first time. I had a frozen pie crust on hand but wish I had made one from scratch to compliment the excellent quiche. I viewed the video and followed the instructions. The tip on checking the doneness ( is that a word?) was the best one. I jiggled the pan after the minimum time passed and sure enough the center was still liquid. I cooked it for the maximum time, took it out of the oven and let it set for 15 minutes. The center was firm when I sliced an hour later. Perfection. I will use different additions to the quiche but leave the base alone. Love it.

So good!!! I never had a Quiche Lorraine before but ingredients sounded delicious. I had a refrigerated pie crust to use and prebaked it in a springform pan. The sides of the pie collapsed and broke off. I was fine with using the bottom of the pie, I don’t think quiches necessarily need a crust, but when spooning the mixture quite a bit of it leaked out of my springform pan. I wrapped the bottom in aluminum foil and hoped it would start to firm in the oven before it all leaked out. It did, so not a total disaster, but not as full of the egg mixture as should have been. In retrospective I wouldn’t have prebaked the crust or used a pie pan and filled it as much as I could have. Regardless, it was delicious and I will definitely make again!!

I have learned to trust all Chef John’s recipes (I especially like his scones and clotted cream recipes) so it comes as no surprise that is one deserves 5 stars too. Normally I try new recipes as written first go round. However I did not here because we wanted a quiche this morning and I didn’t have any the ingredients. Substitute: iltalian sausage instead of bacon, with a little chili powder and smoked paprika on it while it cooked, cheeses were a combination of Swiss, Dublinar

Chef John's tip about the jiggle made all the difference.

I used a store-bought pie crust. Was really looking at this re pie for an idea of the amounts and I used brocolli, Swiss and Jarlsburg because that's what I had around the house. Of course, bacon, too.

I use onion instead of leek, and I use what I have for meat (bacon or ham) and what I have for cheese, but I follow it exactly layering and cooking wise...a family favorite

I should have listened to the other comments. Everything tasted great, but I did swap a few ingredients and it caused overflow before I popped it in the oven. Next time if I'm going to change up the ingredients, I will reserve some of the milk/egg mixture to top at the end (if needed).

Fantastic recipe base - I had no leeks, but substituted broccoli, no bacon, substituted ham, no Gruyere, but used Cheddar. This was amazing - delicate and flavorful. Will definitely do again - love the light, creaminess over the typical dense egginess of quiches. Just wonderful!

Deliciously light and fluffy quiche.  This was the first quiche I ever made.  I chose this recipe because I love almost every recipe of Chef John's.  I used a Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust to make things easier.  I didn't have heavy cream so I substituted half and half.   Mine cooked in a convection oven in 45 minutes to a light golden brown on top.  I let it rest for 30 minutes and it was perfectly set.  My husband who is a big quiche lover said it was unlike any he's eaten, lighter, and more custard like.  No heavy egg texture here.  I will make this again and again and even swap out ingredients.  The gruyere cheese was so delicious.

Lots of flavor!  Loved it!  Set very well.  We didn't have leeks so substituted with green onions and it was still amazing!  No problem with doubling the recipe too, it still came out very well!  We used a frozen crust instead of making our own.

I have been looking for a quiche recipe that was light and more of a fluffy  custard texture. This one is exactly right.  Apparently, fewer whole eggs is the secret. I've used recipes that called for anywhere from six to eight eggs and they always turned out thick and heavy--more of an omelet texture. I love this one. It is such a delightful brunch recipe, or even great for a light evening meal. I did not add the  cayenne pepper, as hot spicy foods are . not my favorite, but I'm sure it would handle it fine and if you wanted a quiche other than lorraine,  I think other ingredients could be used. I'm happy to add this to my saved recipes.

I Love all of Chef John's recipes! This is so easy to  make and has always turned out excellent. It is a little time consuming if you are trying to do the entire recipe all at once, but the shell can be pre-baked and the onion/leek mixture can be pre-cooked, so when it comes time to put it all together it's much easier. I have also pre-cooked the bacon, but it can turn out a little chewy. Watch the video - layering the ingredients make a big difference! It may take a tiny bit longer, but it is so worth it. You end up with the layers and not all the heavy stuff at the bottom.  I have made this for simple dinners and formal family holiday get-togethers and it ALWAYS gets rave reviews and recipe requests.

I cheated and bought a frozen pie crust from Whole Foods just for the sake of time (and kitchen counter cleanliness). This was a quick and easy and *delicious* meal. My husband raved about it. Definitely a keeper.

Absolutely delicious!  My mother was impressed!  Everyone loved it.  Great recipe, and very helpful tips in the accompanying video.  My only change was to sprinkle a little fresh thyme on top as well - made it look even fancier.

Made EXACTLY according to recipe, except instead of making the dough, I used a frozen deep dish pre-made pie shell. 

This recipe is perfect AS IS. Was very good and pleasantly surprised with my first quiche!

This has to be one of the best tasting quiche recipes available.  I made it for the first time over the weekend for quests that were visiting and have made it again two days later for myself.  I added a little diced ham to the recipe and replaced about 1/3 of the gruyere with sharp cheddar.  Simply AMAZING!!

I made this for a special family breakfast get together.  I  couldn't find regular gruyere cheese at my local grocery store but they had smoked gruyere cheese so I gave it a shot. Absolutely AMAZING!!!  I will be making this again for sure but I will use smoked gruyere every time. Thank you Chef John for posting this amazing recipe.

I made this Quiche Lorraine for breakfast and just had to have a second piece because it was so delicious with a perfect texture.  I modified the recipe by using Swiss cheese rather than Gruyere, just because Gruyere was very expensive.  Nonetheless,  this didn't hurt the recipe; it just changed the flavor.

Made it as written - except didn’t have a scale to weigh my cheese. Would be great to have an approximate measure as a fallback. Also, while I love bacon, I noticed the bacon became chewy and the salty smoky flavor had become diluted. I will likely substitute some cubed and browned ham instead next time.

Wonderful! Used a Keto friendly crust made of 2 cups Almond Flour, 2 TBSP Lard & one egg. Incorporated ingredients for crust and par-baked for 15 minutes at 325, changed nothing else. Will make this again for sure!

I made it exactly per recipe, turned out perfect.
We both loved it.  Will make it again. The gruyere cheese was a game changer.  Leeks  interesting! Who knew? layering & ladling made for a perfect distribution of ingredients. Use a Deep Dish pie pan - or all the filling will not fit. This was the first time I ever made quiche , but worked great.This is my "go to" Quiche Lorraine recipe.  And for goodness sake WATCH THE VIDEO.

Very good and very rich, especially since I used half and half instead of milk. Making your own crust helps make this dish absolutely delicious!

Absolutely perfect for Easter brunch. Next time, I'm going to make it with deep dish pie crusts. Besides, I really like Chef Johns way of explaining in his videos. Makes it fun.

My husband loved it and the texture, although I think it helps to be a fan of leeks, because you can definitely taste the leeks.
As always I love how Chef John walks you through how to do it.
I definitely recommend following his recipe to make a pie crust, which added a nice buttery flavor.  
Also the ingredient amounts are correct for a deep-dish homemade pie crust (in a pie dish) but are too much for a so-called deep dish store-bought pie tin -- I used a store-bought tin to hold the pie crust and couldn't fit all the ingredients!

WOW  what a big hit this was with my family. I added a extra egg to this dish along with a little extra cheese. The cheese I used came from Cuzco, Peru, real homemade Andes cheese from the Andes mountains in Peru. I chosed the variety of yellowish/whiteish not too strong flavored cheese, and a good melting cheese it was too. Thank you Chef John for the inspiration to this dish.

My family and guests raved about this quiche. I used a little less cream and more milk as my husband has cholesterol issues. But, even he was asking for more! It was so easy to prepare and I wasn't slaving in the kitchen while others were enjoying themselves. I had time to enjoy it myself. I cheated and bought a store bought crust as I really stink at making crust! No one noticed.

Delicious, and the recipe was easy to follow.  I couldn’t find leeks at my grocery store, so I substituted scallions, and I used Havarti with Jalapeño instead of gruyere.  The Jalapeño added a tiny hint of spice.  Overall, this was fantastic:  creamy and full of flavor.   My husband and I even went back for seconds.  We couldn’t resist!


2/4/18  Update:  I made this recipe again, and this time I had the leeks.  It was much better with leeks!  This recipe is a keeper, and I know I will be making it many, many times!  So delicious!

This is a GREAT recipe--a very rich, classic Quiche Lorraine that turned out very well--very creamy and thick and not at all soggy.  I followed this recipe exactly, and I highly recommend it if you're looking for the perfect quiche.

This is now my go-to base recipe for all things quiche. I use the main custard but add in various ingredients: Ham and Cheese, Broccoli and Cheese, Ham and Mushroom... the sky is the limit!
Best tips are the crust pre-cook (I just use frozen crusts) and spooning custard over the toppings.  You won't need another Quiche recipe.

I made this for a 19070's party because quiche was the bomb back then (and because it's still wonderful!). Honestly, I had forgotten that a real, good quiche is more than scrambled eggs with stuff in them in a pie shell. This one is worth the trouble of finding the leeks, and following the instructions. So so so good! I used the Grandma's secret pie crust recipe on this site that has an egg and vinegar in it, and that was great too.

thank you chef John,  I used prepared pie crust from the store, and the other substituted ingredient was the cheese I used Swiss instead, the other cheese was too pricey.  But yes, I will make it again, I specially loved the leeks in it.

This is excellent.  I added a full pound of bacon.  Next time I will try with regular Swiss Cheese.  The second time I made it I added a pinch of nutmeg as this seems to bring out the flavors nicely in a quiche.  I will try with some spinach also.  As a basic recipe to work from, this is what you want.  Another good recipe from Chef John.

If it's a chef John recipe, you know it will be good, and this is no exception. I dont know if it was my oven, but it took a bit longer to set in the oven. I'm glad I watched this video, as it showed me how much this thing should jiggle when it is properly set. Just like the man says, this is a proper quiche, not an omelet in a pie crust. I love leeks, so this is a great way to incorporate them, and I learned quite a bit about preparing them properly, as well as how to make a proper quiche. I always learn a lot watching chef John. I was not patient enough to let it cool to just warm, and we ate it while it was still on the hot side. I can see why it needs to cool, (to set properly) but the hubby and I had a hard time waiting.... it was still really good, not a scrap left.... it was gone in an hour. I'm glad I used the deepest pie plate I had, I had asparagus that I needed to use up, and I normally won't deviate from the recipe the first time I make it, but I did throw some asparagus in with the onions and leeks, and I'm actually glad I did, it was great! I had a lot of cheese on hand too, but of course no gruyere, so I did have to sub, I used some smoked mozzarella, provolone, and some plain mozzarella. The smoked flavor of the cheese was really good! This would be great for a brunch, as you can cook it early, and let it cool, giving you time to prepare other goodies:) thanks again chef John, I've learned so much from you!

I was looking for a creamy, custard-like  quiche lorraine recipe, and I found it!   Delicious!  Shared with friends  and they raved.  I used half and half to save some fat and calories; turned out beautifully.  Next time I will add a little more salt than I did this time, and will sprinkle on a little garlic powder.  This is a keeper!! (1/2 c of leek is approximately 1 medium leek).

SOOOO GOOD. We really enjoyed this. I used store bought pastry. Did watch video. I think next time a little pre-heat
is good but I will not do foil part again.  Bacon and cayenne so good together. I did use a different cheese because no Swiss today. It was still excellent and easy for a Sunday lunch 
with some left over chef John pasta salad. ILOVEIT

OMG! So I changed it up a little only b/c I have picky kids. I used ham and Colby jack cheese in the eggs. the texture was absolutely perfect and it was gobbled all up. Side note: Be sure to use deep dish crusts

Delish!  I used onions that I had carmelized the day prior, topped with fresh thyme and chives (for colour).  Blind baked my crust with no paper or beans, just pricked it and kept an eye on it.  Added a dash of mustard powder and nutmeg, boy was this good!

This is way to sweet to be a Quiche Lorraine. I followed the recipe to a T but used a frozen pie crust. Very disappointed

Once again Chef John impresses. This was a wonderful quiche full of flavour. I made one error which I will share in hope stat no one else makes it. Trying to save time I bought a ready-made pie crust but it was too small for this recipe and I had a bit of overflow. This is worth taking the time to make a crust for so it comes out right. Very delicious indeed!

The egg part was delicious, but the thick cut bacon was a mistake. It was too chewy.

Great recipe. I watched the video and layered the ingredients. Only thing I did different was to add grated Parm. cheese.  I made two and cut one into wedges to freeze. Just pop in the microwave or heat up in a toaster oven right out of the freezer. Wonderful.

Excellent! I followed the directions exactly and it came out delicious. The only change I made  to keep the calories down was to skip the crust and just sprayed the pan with a little olive oil.

Love this recipe. Made it exactly as written. Made it yesterday for my niece's baby shower. Everyone loved it. One of my nieces who works at a local "boutique " cafe said it was better than theirs. Will make again. However the the price of the cheese was very hefty. Will have to try Swiss cheese next time.

For Easter brunch I made two quiches - this one and one a friend gave me. In using Chef John's I broke a cardinal rule if mine to never make a new recipe for company.

Wow!  I've made quiche before and been disappointed but this one is great!  Didn't have bacon so substituted chopped sausage links.  Couldn't quite get all into a 9" crust so a tiny bit didn't make it.  Husband and I ate the whole thing in about 2 days.

delicious!! followed the recipe exactly. 
In the future I wouldn't bother baking the the crust with beans as a weight, I find that letting the crust rest in the fridge and then using a fork poking some holes in it before baking in a hot oven, also works really well.

To me, this was ok, but not really worth the time or effort that went into making it. May as well just have bacon and eggs - simpler and just as tasty. Sorry but there are better quiche recipes on here so I probably won't be making this one again.

Very Good! (All of Chef John's recipe's have been excellent!) I didn't have leeks so I used thin slices of a few brussel sprouts. Next time I will reduce the amount of gruyere; it seemed to over power the dish but that might have been due to the mild flavor of the brussel sprouts. I also didn't have heavy cream, so I mixed in sour cream with the milk. With these changes it still came out good.

Quiche as it should be! Some of the  so-called "quiche" recipes on this site resemble  frittattas (egg vegetable mixture cooked like an omelette in a pan) that have been baked in a crust.  It is not a true quiche unless it has a custard base.

Fabulous recipe!  I used 1/2 tsp. dried thyme instead of fresh, and did not have heavy cream so substituted 3/4 cup of milk with 1/3 cup of melted butter.  I did need to bake for an additional 10 minutes but found with the milk substitute I made, all the melted butter settled on the top of the baked quiche. (I removed the excess with a paper towel).  I will make again but next time will try it with the heavy cream or just milk.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband declared this the best quiche he had ever tasted. I followed the recipe and layered the ingredients as  directed. I think that the leek and the thyme enhanced the flavor and brought this recipe a step above your average Quiche Lorraine. The texture was perfect, although it did take a little longer in the oven than 45 minutes and did need to cool off before slicing. This will be my go to quiche in the future.

Delicious!  I made this recipe tonight and it was delicious.  I always hate it when people change the ingredients or how they made it, BUT I didn't have leeks so I doubled the onions.  also my crust was a frozen crust from the store.  Anyway, it turned out great and husband loved it!  Thank you.

I served this for a New Year's brunch this morning and it was fabulous. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except that I forgot to buy leeks, so I used all onions. To save time, I used a fold-up crust and followed the pre-baking steps,  which worked beautifully. This will be my go-to quiche from now on. Thanks to other reviewers, I also watched the video and I'm glad I did.

We've made this for Christmas Eve breakfast the last three years in a row. Always a hit. We follow the directions, but the mixture always looks pale and I worry that it needs more eggs. In the end, not a slice remains.

Really decadent.  I followed the directions to a "T" except I used store brand shredded swiss, so I think if I used higher quality cheese, it would be incredible.  Pay attention when he says it's not supposed to have the texture of an omelet...it's supposed to be creamy.  It is!!!

I made no changes and it turned out great. I've made it twice now and never even had any left for leftovers either time!

Turned out perfect. I followed the directions to the letter. 

I cooked mine in my Weber Grill. The convection is great. Mine went 52 minutes at 320. Awesome!

I think next time I'll add some diced red peppers.

First time at making Quiche and I was really pleased at how it turned out. It also tasted great and everyone raved about it. Next time I'll add more bacon to the mix. Can't have enough bacon. No leftovers and this will go into my cookbook as a "make it again" recipe.

Best quiche recipe ever! I was always afraid of making quiche until I saw this video.  Chef John made it easy for me to make this quiche.  Thanks to this recipe I became a big fan of Chef John too.

I made it exactly by the recipe except I sub'd cheese I had for the Gruyere.  I washed the video which was very helpful.  Next time I'll use less onions.  Other than that, we enjoyed it.

The only thing I would do differently is use an unbaked crust and cook for the first 15 minutes at 425 degrees then cook at 350 for rest of time. The quiche custard  and ingredients were awesome. Amazing texture. I really liked Chef John's directions of putting some ingredients in, pour in egg mixture then add the rest of the yum yum's on top!

Excellent quiche recipe! I've made quiche Lorraine numerous times before and it never seemed to come out correctly. I was really searching for a recipe to assist me in the techniques of making a quiche and this recipe is it! I used diced ham steak instead of bacon and mozzarella instead of  the Gruyere, keeping the remaining ingredients exactly as written, the center was a lovely rich custard texture which tasted delicious! This is my go to recipe from now on! Thank you chef John!!
2016: I have made this twice in one week, mainly because we have chickens and an abundance of eggs. The second time I made this I omitted the meat, sautéed the onion in a little olive oil and added fresh steamed broccoli florets and diced tomatoes. . I had to reduce the milk to 1/2 cup to accommodate the vegetables. I used a mixture of cheddar & mozzarella. Every time I use Chef John techniques and my quiche come out Amazing!!

Thank you, Chef John! A Wonderful recipe. I followed it to the letter, including the little side notes you had, and it turned out wonderful. My only issue was that I didn't try the cheese ahead of cooking and it was a little too sharp. My error, not yours, but I think it would be a good idea if everyone tests out the cheese before baking, and add a little less if the cheese is too strong.

Really love this quiche, super custardy. The gruyere and heavy cream really make it delicious-soft, super luxurious. Bacon goodness.  
\n

I don't have such a deep dish and tried it with my cast iron pan, which worked. Recommend using a a dish with gently sloping sides bec/ the more upright dishes will cause the crust to slump, at least it did a few times for me. 
\n

The crust. I don't have a weight measure so no precision in my house but totally agree with doing the crust using a food processor.; it was waaaaaaay easier and much lighter. I do prefer a sturdier crust and next time will use about 3/4 of the dough instead of 1/2 from the recipe. Also, since the processor is already buttery, might as well make a bunch of dough and freeze it. The by-hand crust did not turn out nearly so well. 
\n

I cheated and added some sauteed mushrooms and my every-man's grocery does not have gruyere, so quiche #3 went with Swiss. And that turned out fine too. 

So excited to have a fabulous go-to recipe for quiche!

Very good! My new favorite quiche recipe! I used frozen pie crust, and poured the filling in at once without layering. I also added shredded Swiss cheese as well. So good!

I've never made or even tasted Quiche Lorraine before, but the ingredients appeared promising. I skipped the crust-making, as I was making multiple pies for a "Pi Day" celebration. 
This was delicious, and I loved the texture. I'm not a soft-cooked egg person, but this has the mouth feel of creamy custard, not soft eggs. A co-worker who has had Quiche Lorraine before raved about it.
Yum! I'm so happy I have  the ingredients to make another one for me and hubby to enjoy. Bravo,  Chef John!

I should have paid attention to Chef John's description better.  Custardy quiche is not where it's at for me at least.  I used five eggs and cut down the milk and it was just too soupy. My husband and I agreed it was too oniony for us.  Actually, I think I'd skip out on the onion altogether for sure and  maybe even the leeks too.  I did like the touch of thyme!

Loved this and so did my guests!  Changes I made were to add spinach and saute with onion in bacon drippings, didn't have any leeks or fresh thyme so used dried thyme and reduced amount.  Excellent pie crust recipe too!

Way too soft and mushy for my taste. I made this twice, thinking I hadn't cooked it long enough the first time, but it came out just as soft when baked for 55 minutes. I also didn't like the flavor, although that could be because I used uncured bacon which lacked that smoky bacony taste. I LOVE so many of Chef John's recipes, so I'll chalk this one up to difference in quiche preferences.

Very good stuff here! I have made this several times and it does not disappoint! I too use a frozen pie crust (deep dish) instead of messing with making it,  and still end up tossing out a bit of the egg mixture. Sometimes my grocery doesn't have leeks so I used a shallot last time and it was just as good. The fresh thyme really seals the deal here, do not omit it. I use a whole lb of bacon and Monterey Jack cheese.  Thank you Chef John!

It's pretty easy to make and so yummy.  I've made it twice already.  I need to figure out how not to burn my crust.  Adjust oven time based on your own oven.

Very good!  This quiche was my best quiche effort yet.  The instructions on how to "build it" was new to me.  I used minimal onions (tummy problems),  so I added in sautéed fresh crimini mushrooms.  Next time I may decrease amount of bacon, and may try substituting swiss cheese to suit my taste better.

I have been using this recipe for a couple of years now. It's the best quiche recipe I've found. Meats and vegetables are only limited by imagination. It's such a flexible dish. I often make a quiche when I have friends over and it is always met with excitement and compliments.

This was a GREAT quiche. Phenomenal! Quiche is not supposed to be EGGY. It's supposed to custardy. It was VERY good. I added a few other ingredients and PLEASE don't skip on the freshly baked crust, it is 100x better than store bought! I prefer shortbread crust (omit the sugar).

The only things I did different were: I used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon, didn't have any thyme so I use fresh parsley and I didn't have gruyere so I used what I had shredded Colby jack cheese. Oh, and I used a prepared pie crust to cut down on prep time. Still turned out amazing. Other than that I followed the recipe, layering and it was so moist and soft.

Wonderful! I made this exactly as written (except that I used 1/3 teaspoon of dried thyme in place of the 1 teaspoon of fresh thyme) and it was a HIT at my brunch. 

I watched the video and that was a worthwhile help. 

As for those who do not like how custardy this is, I believe that is a personal taste issue and not a recipe issue.

Awesome like every chef John's recipe. This is the third time I've made it and interestingly the egg didn't set until 50 minutes later, but I think it has more to do with my rack positioning rather than the directions. This is a family favorite, and I did cut down on the bacon amount and was able to sub milk with almond milk (simply because that's what I have in my fridge) without problem. Highly recommend, but don't do it in a rush as it does take a while.

I used my own dairy and gluten free pie crust recipe, and used shrimp instead of bacon, as my wife is pescatarian and I'm intolerant to many foods. I still used gruyere cheese, but it was aged for 11 months, so it didn't bother my stomach. Other than that, I followed the recipe and it came out great! Best quiche I've ever had. I will definitely make this again.

I am a huge fan of Chef John's so any chance I get to cook his adaptations, I am happy!
This proved to be right on! The thyme was the best part of this, of course bacon and gruyere are also awesome :) So fun to make easy, delicious food!

This was AMAZING! I had never made Quiche before and I was nervous, but this recipe was so simple. I didn't brave the lands of pie-crust-making though... I used a Pillsbury crust. The filling is what makes it though, and it was perfection. I actually found a package of fondue cheese mix at the grocery store, so I used that and it was great.

I'll admit it wasn't the typical quiche. Since I'm not a huge egg fan, I gave this a go but I tried to cook it longer than it said and it was still real jiggly. My husband, who loves eggs, said this also.  I'll stick with a regular quiche recipe that I can cook solid.

My go to Quiche recipe.  Suggest separating the eggs & whipping the egg whites,  much lighter fluffier custard.  Other than that, love this basic recipe.

Excellent quiche! Creamy and delicious.
Since my pie shell was smaller I adjusted the ingredients a bit by adding one less egg, and half of the milk it called for.
The result was great and just the right amount for my smaller pie shell.

Yum! Pie crust couldn't be easier or flakier for that matter! I followed the layering instructions, used only vadalia onions because that was all I had, added a little more bacon and used cheddar cheese as that too was what I had on hand. I also only used about a 1/4 tsp. thyme and added a couple shakes of nutmeg. My family loved it! Nice quick easy dinner.

Dumped my old classic quiche recipe (which I thought was great) once I tried Chef Johns. Love this combination of ingredients. I follow the recipe to the letter, after all, he's a better cook than I am.  I confess when I am short on time I use already made pie crust.  It's not nearly as good as the pie crust in this recipe.  It takes a while to make but everyone raves about this quiche. In fact I'm serving this for a ladies lunch with a creamy tomato soup and salad greens. Yum.

Delicious!! I used store bought Pillsbury crust and it worked great. The recipe was a bit too big for that so I ended up making 1 1/2 quiches. I also added mushrooms & sautéed them with the leeks & onions, which everyone liked. Fantastic recipe. Thick & creamy. Not watery or bland at all.

Really the "go to" of Quiche recipies! I did use frozen crust which I pre-baked so the crust did not get soggy on the bottom.  Used 1 3/4 cups half n half. Substituted a good smoked ham and added some porcini romano cheese to the shreddeed cheese. Cooked for about 50-55 min. Very versitle recipie.

Fantastic! Used chef john's crust recipe. Didn't bake the crust first but all at once. My oven has a special programme for quiche which essentially is fan assisted together with heat from the bottom. Works perfectly and also lessens the bake time - was ready in 35' instead of the usual 50'.

Great flavor and easy to make. I used a Marie Callender's pre-formed frozen crust, and followed the recipe as shown. The only change I made was on the bacon. I cooked the full eight slices, but only used about a third of it in the quiche itself (my wife likes bacon, but not a lot of it). I served the remainder as a topping, and that worked really well. Please heed the over-fill caution I've seen in a number of reviews. I had a bit of spillage, but probably made a mistake using X-large eggs. Also, my cooking time wound up being about an hour, give or take. I also prefer the more custard-like texture this recipe produces. Anyway, delicious.

Best quiche recipe I have ever used.  I always get rave reviews when I bake it .  I often substitute spinach instead of leeks, or mozzarella mix if I am out of gruyere cheese.  It is fluffy, light, and PERFECT.

This was my first attempt at Quiche Lorraine - after living in this region for a year back in my school days - did not disappoint!  Was light and fluffy and full of flavor and looked beautiful!  Would not change a thing - followed the recipe to the T except I added more eggs to fill my dish!  Definitely adding this to the rotation - brought back great memories of my year abroad!

Delicious.  I didn't go through all the steps.  Just whisked everything together and also used mozzarella cheese as that is what I had.  Excellent!  The leeks and thyme really make this special.

Delicious - I forgot to buy heavy cream so I used half and half instead, about a cup and a quarter, and then a half cup of 1 % milk. It was still very rich and delicious. Used frozen leeks from Trader Joes, chopped fine, which worked well. Used rice for the blind baking but found that a bit of a pain, so I am wondering if next time i could put in the layer of foil and then just put my other empty pie plate on top of that to keep the crust from bubbling up too much...Worth a try I guess.

I have made this recipe 3 to 4 times, it's absolutely awesome and easy.  Replaced some of the veggies based on what I had on hand, always delicious!  Also vary the cheese, works great!  Perfect meal with a salad.

This was excellent for a beginner like me! The custard was perfect and the end result was so tasty that my guests were asking for more! We had it for dinner as well. I had none of the problems with texture that were noted in other reviews. I used swiss cheese as I live outside the marker of Gruyere cheese. I will definitely being making this many times!

I tried this twice today as a dry run for our Bastille Day celebration. I used my grandmother's pie crust recipe which is delicious, but I did not have a deep dish pie plate so I used a springform pan. First time it seemed like I did something wrong with the pie crust as it was mushy on the bottom. Second time the crust was better but did not cook thoroughly on the bottom, which I think might be a result of the wonderful custardy-light filling. I think this is a fantastic recipe using a deep dish pie crust pan, but I need to tweak it when using a springform pan, which I thought gave it a café-like appearance. All in all, I will always use this recipe as a go-to for a light, fluffy quiche. Husband is French and thinks this is fantastic.

We've made this a bunch of times for various friends and family - always a big hit. The prep takes me a while (not quick at chopping all the veggies and spices) but it's well worth it.

This was a very tasty quiche!  I pretty much followed the recipe to a T, but did use my own pie crust recipe, added an extra egg (was using a deep dish pie plate), and used a combo of cheddar, provolone and parmesan cheeses since I didn't have gruyere on hand - but would love to try it with gruyere next time!

DELICIOUS!! So full of flavor and a beautiful soft fluffy texture! The only modification I made was to do a full cup of onions, instead of 1/2 onions, 1/2 leeks, simply because I didn't want to go buy leeks. I didn't use Chef John's pie crust recipe, but I'm sure it's good also. Thanks for an amazing recipe!!!

But, if you want to kick  this up to 5 stars, forget the cayenne, or black pepper like most people use, and use Basil, it's a good pepper substitute and I can really enjoy this without getting heart burn from the pepper.  Everybody in my house loves this. Also, we like the cream cheese crust the best too.

Since having the quiche at Mon Ami Gabi in Las Vegas I've been searching for a recipe close to it. This is it! Creamy and delicious. I paired it with a frisee salad with a Klamath vinaigrette. 
I found the video to be REALLY helpful. Thank you Chef John!

This is the best quiche recipe I have ever made.  I made this for Christmas brunch and it was a huge hit.  It takes more effort than a traditional recipe but is well worth it.  This will be my go to recipe from now on.

WOW! Delicious!  Easy to make and so so good! Word of caution, it will take more than an hour for this to cool to just above room temperature and maybe longer.  I gave it 35 minutes and decided to cut it and it wasn't long enough.  It still tasted delish but wasn't firm in the middle. But I know for next time. The slices that cooled did firm up though eventually but we couldn't wait any longer after already cutting into it haha! I did have to bake it about 52 minutes because my oven seems to always take more time.  I advise anyone who wants to make this to watch the video for some great tips.  I did add about 3/4 of a cup of chopped leeks since he mentioned he added more. I used 7 ounces of Gruyere cheese because that's what I had and I didn't want to waste it, it's too expensive! My whole family loved this recipe.  I will definitely be making this again on special occasions.  Thanks to another fabulous recipe Chef John.

Excellent!   I changed it up a bit, using less bacon and adding fresh asparagus pre cooked.  It was very easy to make and was a delicious dinner with a accompanying salad.

Made it exactly as is. Wasn't sure about the chopped thyme but I ran with it...and the quiche was delicious. I resisted the temptation to add any other ingredients - well I had chives at hand and thought about adding them but stuck with the original recipe and I'm glad I did. Thank you Chef John.
Now if only I could learn how to cut the first slice without my quiche falling apart....

Best quiche ever.  I received tons of compliments when I made this.  I also used Chef John's pie crust recipe and it was perfect.  I made the recipe exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing.  This was the first time I have made quiche and will be doing so again thanks to this recipe!

I only had turkey bacon & worried it would ruin the quiche, but it turned out great! Couldn't make pie crust from scratch because me arm is in a sling, so I used a deep dish frozen crust (thawed & baked 10 min at 400 F).  This was fabulous! My family all loved it!

This was awesome!  Made for a baby shower and got raves!  I did substitute 1/2 and 1/2 for the milk and cream and used a mixture of mozzarella and cheddar for the cheese and thank goodness it worked.  Thanks for the recipe!

Gourmet! I had never made quiche before but saw this recipe and it looked so good, I decided to try it.  I used a premade pie shell (the kind you unfold) and did not prebake it.  I also did not layer it, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  The result was amazing.  It was like tasting something you would receive at a 5 star restaurant!  My husband, who didn't think he liked quiche, kept raving about it.  This is a winner!!

Requested by my daughter, I decided to give this one a try.  Definitely watch the video… many helpful hints.  Don't overcook your bacon.  I turned my oven up a bit because it took longer to cook.  This turned out perfectly.  I didn't have the fresh thyme so I omitted it, and I didn't miss it.  My mother had this for leftovers the next day and pronounced it the best quiche she has had in 60 years… then she said she must have the recipe!

The recipe is very tasty and the technique for the layers helps evenly distribute the ingredients.  This will be easy to adapt to different flavours.

I wish I had taken a photo as this came out "picture perfect" and tasted wonderful!  It was the 1st time I've cooked with leeks and found the flavor fresh & not overpowering.  I used a frozen deep dish pie crust, too, and put foil over the top the last 5-7 minutes from keeping the top in getting too brown.  Definitely a "must do it again"!
