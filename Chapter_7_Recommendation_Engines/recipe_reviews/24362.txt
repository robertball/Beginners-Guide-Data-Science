This is how I make this salad:  In a bowl layer 1# hamburger(browned with onion & garlic).  Next layer:1 head chopped iceburg lettuce.  Next add your favorite toppings (mine are black olives & chopped tomato).  Top with 8 oz taco blend cheese & 8 oz mexican blend cheese.  Top with crushed nacho cheese Doritos.  Do not add the dressing until just before serving to avoid soggy salad.  I use Kraft Zesty Italian Dressing.

This is a really good base recipe. I cut the cheese in half, four cups of cheese was just too much. I used a cup each of pepper jack and mozzarella. I used the hint of lime tortilla chips, added some medium salsa, and a can of sliced olives. It was great, my boyfriend and friends just gobbled it up!

This is a quick and easy taco salad.  Add your favorite salsa and you have a great meal!  I used one cup mixed taco cheese and one cup cheddar along with the mozzarella.  Adds more of a taco flavor.  My husband and I loved this one.

I wanted something quick and easy to make, and this definately fits!!!  I was a bit skeptical that it would be all that good, and it's fine.  Fiance really liked it a lot, I thought it was just good, nothing I'd want to eat on a regulary basis.  I will make again, just not that often.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

we didnt care for this too much. Mainly the Italian dressing taste-didnt fly well with traditional taco salad. It was very easy to prepare.

Really enjoyed this the second time around. We tried the original recipe the first time and it wasn't bad, but after reading a few of the reviews I added some Taco seasoning and it is much better.  Definately a keeper.

This is a good, fast way to make a taco salad.  If you want it spicer, add taco seasonings to your ground beef, use a nacho-flavored tortilla chip and mix some salsa or pico de gallo right into your salad dressing.  Great with some chopped avocado too or ranch beans with jalapenos!

Kids LOVED it! I did add a pack of taco seasoning to the ground beef.  I've made this numerous times now.  I like it when it sits for a long time.(more flavor)   Definitely a quick easy dinner.

The Italian dressing does give it a different taste than what your used to in a Taco Salad.  I took suggestion of others about adding kidney beans, tomatoes & taco spices.  It wouldn't be worth making if you didn't put these ingredients in, as it would be bland.

My son added a little catsup and thought it was great and tasted just like a taco. I certainly would not try the catsup thing!

Even my picky husband & kids will eat this.  I don't mix the cheese or chips in.  I make a salad & serve the taco ing. on the side.  This way everyone can build their own style taco & if I have leftovers (rarely), the cheese , if mixed in,  tends to make the salad mushy & yucky!

My Mother has a similar recipe. Try using taco seasoning on the ground beef. It also tastes better if you use Doritos and sharp chedder cheese. You may also like garbonzo beans as well. Enjoy!

It's close to my favorite taco salad my aunt used to make but way too bland as-is.  It is MUCH better if you add taco seasoning while browning the meat (that's how my aunt made it)!  The taco seasoning flavors do not clash with the italian dressing at all, in fact i think it's much better with italian than with ranch.  Do yourself a favor and season the meat with at least a half a package of taco seasoning to really make this tasty!  Cut the cheese in half, too.  Please also add diced tomatoes and black olives if you like those for the best taco salad ever!

This was very tasty and fresh! My husband loved it too. I used other reviewers advice, and added the a bit of taco seasoning and  garlic & onion to the ground beef. I actually left off the italian dressing alltogether and used salsa as a dressing. Umm Umm.  My husband actually suggested mixing all the ingredients(besides the lettuce) and placeing them on full romain heart leaf lettuce--like a lettuce wrap-- so I am making this again tonight that way! Thanks for the recipe :)

This was tasty and quick! My husband and I both enjoyed it, but I felt it needed a little more, like maybe corn, olives, some bell pepper...but over all it was very good and I will make this again with my veggie add-ins.

We make something similar.  We brown chicken, then shred it and mix with taco seasoning.  Then in a bowl, layer lettuce, black beans, grated Mexi cheese (not too much), the warm seasoned chicken, chopped red onions and crushed tortilla chips.  For dressing, try the Hidden Valley spicy ranch dressing - fabulous!

A good basic recipe. I like that it uses mixed greens rather than iceberg, though iceberg lends that wonderful, cool  crunch we associate with tacos. Add some chopped cilantro to this, and it's great.

have made this twice since i got this recipe last week.  Sent it on to all my friends too.  We only used 3/4 c of homemade italian dressing because we thought 8 oz would be too much.  But this is going to made over and over again in our house!!

ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!  I am a working mom with a hard working husband and a hungry 5 year old boy...I am always looking for quick, easy, & yummy recipes.  This seemed to fit so I tried it & WOW!!  So easy to make, 10 minutes tops, so easy to clean up after, and it makes plenty of food & the leftovers are just as delicious!! And you can not beat the flavor, it seems so simple but trust me the flavor is there.  Even my 5 yr old son loves it!!  I did use Hint Of Lime tortilla chips & added sliced black olives but that was it.  We have now had it twice in two weeks & we will be keeping this one in full weekly rotation.  Thank you so much for such a wonderful recipe!!

Pretty good as a base recipe. I did add hot taco seasoning to the ground beef. For the cheese, I only used two cups instead of four, and I used Mexican shredded cheese. Next time I think I'd add chopped tomato as other reviewers suggested.

Not bad! Although a good starting point for an EXCELLENT taco salad, I felt this needed some major tweaking to suit my tastes. To kick this up a notch, here's what I did: a) added a packet of taco seasoning to my meat (followed package directions), a 15 oz. can of (rinsed & drained) kidney beans, a small can of sliced black olives, a pint of (halved) grape tomatoes and a bunch of chopped green onions, b) subbed Mexican-blend cheese for the cheddar / mozzarella called for and c) used nacho flavored Doritos in lieu of plain tortilla chips (I'll try Frito's corn chips next time...). My last change was allowing my meat to cool slightly BEFORE mixing it with everything else (FYI, warm meat will MELT your cheese and turn your lettuce soggy!). The use of Italian dressing was unique and is what drew me to this to begin with, but I will stick with a more traditional alternative next time (i.e. TI, French or Catalina). All in all, this was well-received at my neighborhood block party and a GREAT way to feed a HUNGRY crowd! Thanks for sharing, JOHANNIB!

This is good and really easy to put together. I added some tomatoes but otherwise stuck to the recipe. I put it in a glass lunch jar and ate it on-the-go keeping the dressing on the side until I was ready to eat. I’ll definitely add some seasoning to the meat next time. Thank you for the recipe.
