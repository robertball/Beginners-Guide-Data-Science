I've made something very similar but with jalopena peppers added to the cola instead of mushrooms and then simply baked until the meat is tender. The cola's sweetness takes the fire out of the peppers & makes a wonderful sauce.

This recipe was pretty sweet. I added more broth and garlic salt. I also added worchestire sauce and balsamic vinegar. I served over rice. It wound up being very good. My mom loved it, too.

Good flavor, but I agree, sauce is kind of sweet. Either use more chix broth or less cola. Kids loved it, very easy, I used skinless breast's and cooked 15 minutes.  Worth another shot if you ask me.

This is an easy, impressive dish for a small dinner get-together. As a bonus, leftovers are scrumptious and since it falls into the tastes-better-the-next-day category, it can be prepared in advance -- save the saute part for just before the guests are to arrive. For extra punch, thicken with a giant can of undiluted chicken soup instead of flour (which also will stretch the leftovers, by the way)

If you're garlic and onion freaks, like my family, double both ingredients (at least). I served the dish with rice pilaf and a very simple mixed-fruit salad, and people called the next day for the recipe.

This recipe was wonderful!  I didn't have the recipe in front of me when I made it, so I inadvertently used the whole 14-oz. can of chicken broth, and correspondingly less cola.  I served it over white rice, and my husband added soy sauce at the table.

I made this for my husband & I the other night, and we just were not impressed at all, sorry. It didn't pick up enough of the other flavors, could only taste the cola.

My family liked this recipe. Amazing that no one could pick out the cola taste.  I did cut the sody by 1/4 cup and added more chicken broth.  All around everyone liked it.  Next time I will use a bit or salt.

This was a different recipe, and one that I might not have tried if I had not heard about a similar dish previously. Some of the other reviews commented on the "sweetness" of the sauce, but I found that by adding a bit of salt and/or using a bit less cola and a bit more broth, the taste is very good and the sweetness can be reduced. I also cooked mine for a full 30 minutes, and kept it covered for a good portion of that time. As it cooked, I noticed the flavor getting better, the taste of the seasonings really beginning to emerge. I only mention that to say that if you rush the cooking, you may miss some of the flavor. I think we will cook this again, and serve it over a bed of wide egg noodles. The gravy seemed to be perfect to use that way.

Smells delicious while cooking.  I did not cut the chicken into chunks but rather used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I also used the George Foreman grill to brown the chicken--this eliminated the need for butter and thereby reduced the fat.  The taste is not out of this world, but it is good and we will definitely have it again--if trying this recipe for the first time, you might want to add more rosemary or add another spice that gives it a bolder flavor.

My family really likes this! The chicken was so tender. It's a bit like sweet and spicy chicken, without the spicy. Since we like spicy things as well, next time I'll add some cayenne or crushed red peppers or some other form of spice.

I have heard several people say "you should cook chicken in cola! It makes it so good!" I had some chicken breasts and needed an idea, saw this and thought...ok. A previous reviewer didn't like it at all saying it was way too sweet b/c of the cola. I wondered if she had used regular. I had a diet and thought well maybe it won't be as sweet. I am not a picky eater but I found out tonight I don't like my chicken sweet unless it is a typical chinese dish. All a matter of preference of course. This is not a bad recipe. The flavor was very good, just too sweet for my liking. I won't make it again but finally my curiosity involving the cola is satisfied :D

This is a good basic recipe to follow, however there are some changes that I made to improve the taste. For 2 chicken breasts, 10 oz of oyster sauce is wasteful and excessive. I used 3 oz of oyster sauce, 4 oz. of water, 2 teaspoons of garlic, 2 teaspoons of ginger, and 2 teaspoons dried rosemary. I added 1 tablespoon sugar to this and poured it over the chicken breasts. I simmered them on the stove for 15 minutes, and then chopped the chicken into bite size pieces and returned it to the same pan to cook for another 5 minutes. Finished the chicken has a tasty crust around it, delicious.
