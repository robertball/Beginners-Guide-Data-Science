These muffins are really great and oaty!  I didn't put any oil and threw in a grated apple for moisture.  I also used only 1/4 cup brown sugar since I don't like muffins too sweet.  I put in some vanilla, ginger, and cinnamon as well.  Turned out fantastic even with the changes!  They puffed up really well, are moist, oaty, and taste great!  This is a great staple oatmeal muffin recipe!
UPDATE: I've made these quite a few more times now, with grated pear or apple.  I think the vanilla really makes them great so I'd recommend making them with it!

Occasionally the best recipes I come across are when I'm trying to use up stuff in the fridge - this was one of those happy times. It's a simple muffin, not bogged down with a million different add-ins and spices, although it's conducive to that if you're so inclined. So except for adding a teaspoon of vanilla I left it alone.  Wonderfully moist because of the buttermilk and oil, with a subtle brown sugar oatmeal flavor.  I thought about adding chocolate chips, then dried mixed berries and finally added a couple of handfuls of blueberries when I remembered I had them in the fridge to use too. Pretty and not too sweet, these are just delightful.

I love these muffins. When I increase the ingredients to make 12 instead of 8, I use one whole egg + one egg yolk. Also, I substitute melted butter for the oil and I add a generous amount of freshly grated nutmeg. Yum!

Thank you!  I have been searching for years for a recipe that replicates the Quaker Oatmeal Muffin Mix.  This is it!

It made 8 muffins and I baked for 20 minutes.  I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon.  Light and fluffy...not dense at all like many other oatmeal muffins I have tried.

Yum! Really moist! I used melted butter instead of oil, added 1 apple, shredded, and cinamon/nutmeg, 1 tsp/ 1/2tsp respectively. And  1/4 cup of bran.

Bland is the kindest adjective I can say of the taste; I added both vanilla and cinnamon but neither was able to salvage these muffins. I have had boxed mixes with more flavor. I wish I could say how great they were but the only thing I ended up doing was wasting my time making them.

This has become my all-time favorite muffin recipe!  I got it from my dad, and was going to add it, but it's already here.  I always double the recipe, and I add 1 T. of vanilla (1/2 to the regular recipe).  We've also added rasins for those who like a bit more texture.  It's one of my favorite breakfasts - a co-worker said they were so good, he was licking the crumbs out of the cupcake cups!

We had them straight out of the oven this morning for breakfast, but I can see how they could be served with dinner as well. The sweetness is subtle, and although they're lovely just as they are, the cinnamon and nutmeg that others suggested would also complement it nicely. Very, very easy to make and a versatile recipe. Thanks for this one. Also enjoyed the intro--makes me wonder what else was served for that special dinner.

My first review of a recipe.  Had to say how wonderful these muffins are.  They are easy to make, and almost melt in your mouth. I got 11 out of the recipe.  A bit smaller, but that's OK with me. Thanks for a good breakfast treat.  Would like to know the nutritional facts, though.

The are sooooo good warm from the oven. And if you're feeling decadent, butter them! Soft, sweet and oaty. The only change I made was to add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. It will work to sub applesauce for the oil, but of course the muffins won't be quite as luscious.

2.19.12 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/124528/buttermilk-oatmeal-muffins/ ... A good & healthy muffin - especially when you soak the oats for an hour (or more to plump them up); sub whole wheat flour & melted margarine; add a teaspoon vanilla & 3/4-1c blueberries.  It's the same recipe except increase baking powder to 1 1/2t.  I used 3/4c white sugar (since it was my first time) & it was good & not too sweet.  I think the whole wheat flour might "need" a little more sugar, but I'll try less & brown next time.  Did mine at 350 for 30.  BOTH kids (11 & 13) like 'em!  WOW.  :D April2012: Dbl recipe Used 2coats; 2c buttermilk; 2t vanilla;; 2eggs; 1c white sugar; 1/4c melted butter; 1/4c olive oil; 1c white, 1c whole wheat flour; 1T bp; 1t bsoda, 1t salt' 1/2t cinnamon. 'Made 12 as listed. Added 1c blueberries to remaining 12. W berries, sweet enough. W/o, not.  Really needs fruit to sweetenit up.  More cinnamon either way.1/13 Double recipe using 1c brown sugar, melted 1/2c SmartBalance, 2c blueberries, 1t cinnamon.  Made 24 muffs, baked at 375 (using frozen berries) for 20.  (375 for 20 works, too) Healthy tasting, but not so much that you don't want to eat them.  :D  Note4Me: Cooks.com recipe uses more oil/margarine(1/2c vs1/4c.Tried whole wheat: 1coats,1cbuttermilk.Soak 1hr.1cwwflour,1/2tsalt,1/2tsoda,1 1/2t powder;1/4coil;1/4cmeltedmarg;3/4cwhite;1egg, btn,1t vanilla. 350 30

Excellant muffin! Think cornbread type of muffin but made with oatmeal instead and you will appreciate what these are. They are not meant to be sweet (submitter had these with dinner) or fruity or spiced. They are light, fluffy, wholesome oaty dinner muffins with a touch of sweetness from the brown sugar that go well with foods you would normally serve with corn muffins (chili, stew, roasts). I however love a muffin that isn't sweet or filled with fruit and found these to be absolutley delicious warm with a smear of butter for breakfast. I did sub 1/4 c. of white whole wheat flour for regular flour and the recipe made 12 standard size muffins that cooked in approx. 14 minutes.

ADD VANILLA!!! This recipe lacks spices- I made one batch exactally like recipe- they were moist and good, but missing something.  Second batch I added vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, about 1/2 tsp each and 2 tsp white sugar- much better! Still think they need nuts or raisins.

Hooray!!!  I finally found a muffin recipe even the kids liked!  We all thought these were very good, and I will most definitely make again.  I did add vanilla and cinnamon, per suggestions of other reviewers--I almost always add vanilla to baked goods and I love the combination of cinnamon w/oatmeal.  I baked these in a mini muffin pan at 375 for about 12-13 minutes and got 24 delicious, moist and filling muffins.  Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe!

This is a wonderful basic muffin recipe. The leavening is the perfect amount and results in beautiful domes every time. The texture is moist but not overly so, almost like a heavy cake but without the sweetness. It lends itself very well to variation, although I rarely add more than vanilla and cinnamon (the equivalent of 1/2 tsp each per single batch). I never make less than a double batch, which gives me 1.5 dozen full size muffins and 1 dozen mini muffins. The minis take roughly half the time to bake as the big guys. Fabulous for breakfast or any time.

A great HEARTY muffin! Not like a sweet cakey muffin, but wholesome tasting. I always add some vanilla & cinnamon to mine. Usually some chopped nuts and sometimes frozen blueberries or chopped apples, even bananas. It's a very forgiving, versatile base recipe to start with: then add in what flavors you like. Just remember to SPRAY the liners inside w/ cooking spray before adding in your batter, or they will stick! My 4 yr. old loves eating them, and I feel good serving them :-)

I adjusted a bit to make them a bit more healthy and they were still delicious. Substituted whole wheat pastry flour. Used dry buttermilk and added water, used 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup applesauce instead of vegetable oil, and added 2 Tbsp flaxseed.

very quick muffin to make...  as a variation, i have also used various flavors of yogurt instead of buttermilk (the 6 oz containers, diluted with the necessary amount of milk to make a cup)...  

next time will use regular oats instead of quick...  also, use the full amount of sugar :)

Very good but VERY easy to overcook, and very bland and dry when overcooked.  I reduced the bake time and the oven temp for my second batch and they came out far better.  You want to take these out of the oven before anything starts to turn visibly golden on top.

This is a great basic oatmeal muffin. Since it was a pretty small recipe I went ahead and made them as the recipe states (with the exception of one added tsp of vanilla) so that I could see what the plain version tasted like before trying different variations. They have a very mild, not too sweet oat flavor with a light, slightly chewy texture. These would be great with just about anything added in but I think I'll try banana nut and apple cinnamon versions first. However, I think the plain goes well with jelly or jam. I tried mine with Candy Apple Jelly from this site and it was delicious! I will definitely be playing around with this recipe. Thanks Robert!

This recipie has turned me into a liar.  I have to make a double batch, hide half, & tell my DH that they are all gone in order to have some the next day (because they are even better the second day).  lol  I have made them as stated, added spices with the dry ingredients, and fruit (dried fruits or frozen blueberries & even 'smoothie mixed fruit' straight from the freezer) when the dry ingredients are about half mixed in.  They have always come out wonderful & delicious, moist, but not too heavy.  I've also subbed yogurt Greek style plain) for the buttermilk one morning when I didn't have buttermilk - still great, though a bit more dense.

I was so pleased with this recipe! The buttermilk does wonders to produce a great tasting, moist muffin. I also like the brown sugar--providing a deeper flavor than white sugar.

These were good - I added a tsp of vanilla and added chocolate chips.  I think they would have been a little plain without those - but they are quite good with them.

I made this recipe this morning after searching for a way to use Buttermilk.  I love baked goods with Buttermilk.  I read many reviews and altered the recipe with some of the suggestions.  The muffins are fantastic and healthy too ! In the name of getting the kids to eat some good nutrition (without realizing it)I made the muffins with the addition of 1 grated apple (peeled), 1 tsp.cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1 tsp. Vanilla, 1 Tblsp. ground flaxseed and 1/4 cup Oat Bran. I put in only 1 Tblsp. of oil and used 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour. The moisture from the added apple ensures a moist muffin, even with the addition of the extra dry ingredients.  I will definately add this recipe to my box.  The next time I make it I will try with some golden raisins.

I made this recipe as written, then took it a little further and added a tsp of cinnamon, some chopped pecans and golden raisins, for some delicious breakfast muffins. Tender yet hearty, and flavorful. Use the real deal buttermilk for best results. The substitute milk/vinegar or lemon juice will be a very poor stand in.

Everyone I make these for loves them!  This is a wonderful muffin recipe.  I sometimes make changes to fit the mood and make them a bit healthier.  Our favorite variation:  Add 1/2 c finely choppped walnuts, 1/4 c wheat germ, 1/2 c applesauce (and no veg. oil).  Plus I use finely ground whole wheat in place of the all- purpose flour and old fashioned oats in place of the quick - cooking variety.  Also great with some dark chocolate chips added.  These make a nutrient packed breakfast.

These were perfect- exactly what I wanted.  I added a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg and a little vanilla.  My batch made 10 - I definitely could not have just made 8, they would have overflowed.  I baked for 15 minutes and they were perfect.

As written these are a 3. I read all the reviews and saw that most of the 5 star ratings had made significant changes. So  I made up the batter exactly as written and filled 2 muffin cups. I then added raisins and a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the remaining batter. My daughter who requested I make these tried the plain ones and said they were okay. The ones with the raisins she pronounced delish. I would make these again with the changes. Thankyou for the starting point.

If you don't have buttermilk you can make a substitute by adding one TBS of white vinegar to one cup of milk.  Allow to sit for about 5 minutes to sour.

Super Yum!

Followed the recipe, just did a few little tweaks for my own needs... but you can follow the recipe exactly and it would still be a 4 or 5 star recipe.

I added some vanilla because it never hurts. I used Splenda brown sugar, and I added lavender from my garden. Delightful!

Just be sure not to over mix! Get all of the ingredients moist and then stop. There should be a little bit of flour here and there left when you're done.

These muffins are wonderful.  Moist and tasty. The second time, I added bananas and nutmeg and cinnamon.
Well worth the extra calories due to the buttermilk.  
Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

I've made these according to the instructions and they are great (although better with chocolate chips). I have also made a healthier version of them using 1/3 cup applesauce and cutting the oil to 1 Tbsp, sugar to 1/3 cup, and substituting 2/3 cup whole wheat flour, 1/3 cup unbleached white flour and adding some wheat germ and oat bran. Add in some blueberries and sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on the top.

These are nice and moist and I do like them, but I also agree with the reviewer who found them a bit bland, even with the additions -- I think it's because they are more like a dinner roll, for buttering or dipping in soup, than a breakfast muffin. 

I made them with regular--not quick cooking--oats, which turned out fine. 

I added the vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg suggested by other reviewers. The nutmeg was a bit much -- if I make these again I will stick with just the vanilla and cinnamon.

I love that these are low-fat, tender from the buttermilk, and rich in fiber! I read the other reviews and prepped for expected blandness by adding cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, and chocolate chips. They were great! I made 2 batches of these for a potluck, and they were gobbled up!

Wonderful!  Great for breakfast or snacking.  I took the suggestions: (1) Melted butter instead of oil, (2) grated 1 apple, (3) added 1 t. cinnamon, (4) added 1/2 t. nutmeg.  And just because (5) added 3/4 c. fresh blueberries and (6) a bit of cinnamon-sugar topping.  This turned out wonderful.  I bet it'd be delicious without any of my changes, but I adapted it to our tastes.  Thank you, Robert!

These turned out very good.  When I went to get my buttermilk to make these, I realized it was expired and it smelled pretty funky, so I decided not to use it.  Instead, I subbed 1 cup milk + 1 tablespoon white vinegar to make sour milk.  Something I don't do unless I absolutely have to, as, contrary to what people think, sour milk is NOT the same as buttermilk.  However, in this recipe, it seemed to work fine.  The muffins turned out very soft and moist.  I did add a little vanilla, cinnamon, and ginger as well.  I got 12 regular sized muffins; I could see only getting 8, IF you use the jumbo-sized muffin tin liners.  Mine were done right at 16 minutes.  Will make again.

I did as someone else suggested and added vanilla, cinnamon, flaxseed meal, and a grated apple. They were good, but a little bit bland. I will be making again, but with some changes. Thinking of adding some raisin bran crunch in the mix.

wonderful, light and perfectly sweet results. I added one tsp of vanilla and kept them pretty basic (they are for my daughter's preschool class). I used old-fashioned rolled oats and doubled the recipe. Baked them at 390 for 18 minutes. Excellent recipe. I will use this as a base for MANY recipes in the future.

These are morning-warming, basically fabulous muffins.  I made a box of several kinds of muffins for a family that had been through a rough medical time and they loved these for how they reheated and complimented butter and jam.

They're the kind of basic muffin I like best and that can be made on the spot for breakfast.

this recipe is an okay place to start but on its own the muffins are pretty bland. i recommend adding bananas and nuts, or apples and cinnamon, probably a bit more brown sugar too. nothing special on their own, but a nice base for making muffins.

I definitely recommend this recipe!Light, fluffy, and not too sweet, these muffins are a basic must. I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon for a little extra flavor. Also, before baking I sprinkled each muffin with white sugar to give them a sparkly, crunchy top.

A great muffin recipe - not overly sweet.  I added some frozen raspberries which made them extra good!

These were okay. I used sour milk and regular oats, oil instead of butter, and added 1 tsp vanilla and a few shakes of cinnamon. It made 12 muffins, which I cooked for 14 minutes. I think they were missing something-they just didn't have a very strong flavor. Which is okay...just not great. But it was a good recipe for things you already have in the house.

Really good muffins. They bake up so nice and high. Like others, I added vanilla and cinnamon and nutmeg. The nutmeg is great in these. They could have been bland without these perhaps. Crisp on top and moist inside. Just sweet enough .For anyone interested they are about 229 calories a piece if you only make 8, but I got more muffins out of this recipe.  My daughter liked them as well and she doesn't often eat muffins. Thanks!

Oh these were so good. The texture is light and fluffy not too dense at all. They were lightly sweetened so could still add a bit of jam if that is your preference. But they are perfection on their own. I did add a tsp of cinnamon - just for a touch of flavour as I seem unable to cook without the use of one spice or another. Oh and didn't have buttermilk but the milk and vinegar combo worked out great.

The texture was perfect, however, the taste is rather bland, which may be great for some as a dinner bread. I will make them again, but I will use butter instead of oil, increase the sugar a little and maybe add some walnuts and/or cinnamon. And maybe a cinnamon crumb topping. That's it!! I just solved the issue on my own! Seriously, though - the texture was exactly what I was looking for in a muffin.  And now that I'm thinking about it a little more, they were pretty amazing with strawberry jelliy on them!

The greatest part about these muffins is the endless possibilities.  This is a great basic recipe which is good on its own, but can be tinkered with in many ways to make so many kinds of muffins.  I have added a tsp of cinnamon to mine b/c my family loves it, but I can imagine this recipe would be good with fruits too (apple, blueberries, banana even).  Thanks for a delicious, useful recipe.

These are my first attempt at Oat Muffins and I'm very pleased.  These muffins have a nice, light texture and are very moist.  I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon just because I always add it when I cook  oatmeal to serve hot.  The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is becaue I think they would be perfect with the additon of some type of fruit.  Small chunks of apple or banana (and the cinnamon) would make these 5 star muffins.

A great basic muffin recipe. Definitely add spices and other ingredients if you want flavour as this is just a base recipe. The muffins were very moist and chewy.

These muffins are tender and delicious!  I made the recipe exactly as written.  They are moist and have a nice flavour.  I make a LOT of muffins as my family eats them every day for breakfast and the kids take them in their school lunches so I am always trying new recipes.  My only change is that next time I will try adding nuts or chocolate chips, or dried cranberries or something for texture, a little more brown sugar, maybe 1/4 c more, and a tsp of vanilla.  All in all, a really GOOD recipe!

Excellent breakfast muffin!  I doubled the recipe, used kefir instead of buttermilk, used 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar, added 2 teaspoons vanilla, and threw in one chopped-up milk chocolate almond candy bar, as well as about a cup of frozen raspberries.  It was AWESOME!!!

These turned into my absolute favorite muffin base. I have made them (separately, of course) with chocolate chips, cranberries, blueberries, apples, and several different kinds of nuts and spices, and have perfect oatmeal muffins every time. For those complaining of bland taste, I found this recipe in the muffin collection, listed as a basic recipe, I took it to mean I could add whatever flavors I wanted to it, and I was right :D My suggestion is to experiment to find a flavor (or many) that suits your tastes and wants.

These were delightful.  I doubled the recipe because I wanted more than 8 muffins, and then I ended up with 24 muffins.  So you really get about 12 muffins per batch.  But, I was so stinkin' glad that I doubled the recipe because they were delicious.  Per other reviewers comments, I added a tsp of vanilla (1/2 tsp per batch).  These were delightful!

Not bad, but pretty bland. I added 2 tsp nutmeg (my favorite!), 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and they still seemed to not have much flavor.  I added craisins to a few and they were OK but the flavors didn't really mesh too well. If I made these again I would stick with the spices, maybe add a couple tsp of vanilla and some butterscotch chips.

These muffins are fabulous! I substituted applesauce for the oil and used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 wheat flour. Changes made them about 150 calories and 1 gram of fat per muffin (batch of 9). Great for a grab-and-go breakfast and really nice with a glass of apple cider.

I would have baked for maybe closer to the 16 minutes. We went 17 and it was a little dry. Added a cup of reconstituted raisins, a tsp of vanilla and topped the muffins with a sprinkle of cinnamon and sugar in the raw before baking, otherwise they turned out pretty good!

I used ROLLED OATS instead of of quick cooking oats. I used half a cup whole wheat flour plus 1/2 cup all purpose flour instead of only all purpose flour. I also added in a chopped apple, 1/2 cup of raisins and a teaspoon of cinnamon. After baking, I realized that I forgot to add the baking soda.

They were GREAT!

I plan to make another batch with the baking soda tomorrow just to find out if it will make any significant difference.

Tried the recipe exactly as is and found them to be very good. Next time I think I will add some apple and cinnamon, or berries, or something like that. This could be a very versatile muffin! Thank you for sharing!

Delicious and a big hit with the family.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I used a tablespoon of vinegar per cup of milk and let the mixture sit on the counter for 10 minutes before adding the oatmeal.  I also added 1 mashed banana and about 1/2 of a mashed mango.

These are moist, flavorful and delicious! Thanks so much for the recipe.  However, the submitter must have HUGE muffin tins.  I doubled the recipe and made 24 mini-muffins and 23 regular sized muffins.  That's great because we can't stop eating them.  My hubby polished off ten of the mini-muffins in about 10 minutes!

Amazing muffins!!! I used 2% milk instead of buttermilk and applesauce in place of the oil... made a batch of plain ones, one with blueberries and one with milk chocolate chips... they were all delicious!!! YUMMY

Very moist & tasty. Very good recipe to work of off. 

I reduced the sugar to 1/4 or 1/3 & omitted the oil altogether. I also added some vanilla, shredded apple & carrot, cinnamon & ginger, also some ground flax seeds & replaced some of the white flour with wheat. Very good!

These are so bland!!! And I even added vanilla and lemon zest. I wouldn't give up on it yet though, because the texture and moist-ness is great --- just add a bunch of extras (i.e. blueberries, vannilla, lemon, cinnamon, etc.!!)

The recipe as it is makes muffins with a lovely texture, and it is also quite easy. The taste, however, is a bit bland. I would be sure to add spices, dried fruit, jam, nuts, or some other good. 
Good basis, but only a perfect finished recipe gets five stars from me!
My changes: I added vanilla, cinnamon, clove, ginger, nutmeg, and walnuts. I also used some grated apple, but that was just to cut down on fat. The oil ratio is absolutely fine here.

I made these with less sugar and whole wheat flour instead of white.  I agree that they could use a little more flavor...I forgot to add vanilla, cinnamon or nutmeg as suggested.  But, they are also good as-is or with blueberries or chocolate chips inside.

Great recipe!
I changed it up a bit to suite my tastes. I was really craving chocolate at the time! So I added 1/3 cup of cocoa powder, and 1/2 cup of dark chocolate baking chips. I also subbed out the brown sugar for honey and the flour for whole wheat flour. Healthy and delicious! :)

Great recipe.  I've been looking for a buttermilk oatmeal muffin recipe for quite some time.  I made 3 differnet batches of these muffins.  I added pumpkin pie spice to all but in batch had pieces of apple, raisins in the 2nd, and chocolate chips in the 3rd.

I expected to like these more than I did.  These are just basic-not-too-sweet-dense-oatmeal muffins (nothing wrong with that) but there isn't anything really standout-ish about them.  The simple addition of cinnamon or toasted pecans would really take these from so-so to so tempting.

Very good recipe.  I made as directed with good results.  My only change was to use powdered buttermilk solids with regular milk.  This is a great product that is just as good as fresh buttermilk and keeps in the refrigerator indefinitely.  Look for it in the baking area and eliminate thick stinky buttermilk in your refrigerator door.

I made the changes that others suggested, adding spices, vanilla, apple, and I still found this muffins a bit bland.  I soaked the oatmeal the full 15 minutes, but these were still dry muffins.  I much prefer some of the bran muffin recipes on this site.  My kids like these because they are bland.

I just made these last night and they were delicious, even with a few alterations ;-) I used large oats, 1 cup of milk with 1 tbsp. vinegar to give it the zing, whole wheat flour, and for my own taste buds I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1 1/2 tbsp. each of ground flaxseeds, whole flaxseeds and wheatgerm. They were really yummy! I did end up soaking the oats in the milk for longer because I had to clean up a shattered pyrex measuring cup, but I think that helped make the larger oats softer. I will definitely make again! Though, I may add a bit more spice and maybe some orange juice and zest!

These muffins are identical in taste to a recipe called "No Corn Corn Muffins", a recipe from my childhood 35 years ago! My family made the muffins every Saturday morning to eat with scrambled eggs. I have been searching for muffins that reminded me of them, FOREVER! They are spot on and delicious. I only had old fashioned oats so I pulsed them in my food processor a few times, and I didn't have buttermilk so I used the 1TBS of white vinegar in milk trick. My muffin tins are old school (regular, small size) so I was able to get 12 muffins.

I bake a lot of muffins and I'm always looking for new recipes. This one is a keeper! Fantastic base recipe. Very moist muffins. You can make them into anything you like. I added cinnamon and vanilla like others suggested and threw in some frozen raspberries. Mmmm! Mmmm! Delicious!!!  and oh the possibilities ! From simple (dates) to fun (banana/chocolate chips) to scrumptious (peach/blueberry). . . can't wait to try them all :-)))

Absolutely DELICIOUS.  The second time I made them I added the zest of one orange and 1 cup of cranberries, chopped.  With the addition, the muffin was a little 'doughy' while they were warm, I think from the extra moisture, but very, very good after they cooled.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I made the mistake of doubling these which made 26 large muffins! I did add about two cups of blueberries, which might have made the batter stretch even more and a tsp. of vanilla. With any oatmeal-based recipe, I let the batter sit for about ten minutes or so to soak up some of the liquid. Smells great.

recipe as is is great.  However, I do double it, add 3 grated apples, four (small) grated carrots and a good Tablespoon of cinnamon.  I also add some sunflower seeds and wheat germ and use half whole wheat flour and half all purpose flour.  I obviously need to bake them longer and just keep my eye on them.  Yummy this way too!

This recipe is so good my whole family loves it!  I didn't have eggs the first few times I made them so I subbed 2 tbsp water per egg and they were still moist and delicious.  There really wasn't any flavor difference, either, so if you have an egg allergy you can still make this recipe.

Very yummy. Whenever I made them though, I always put in some bran, just to make it more healthy, and towards the end a little bit more buttermilk. They are great!

Fabulous!  Do not hesitate to make these.  They are so soft--sometimes oatmeal muffins can be heavy and tough, but these are so moist you won't believe it.  I felt naughty eating these becuase they are so moist and yummy, but then I reminded myelf that oats are good for you.  Made them with white sugar and whole milk (same quantities) because that's what I had on hand, also added half a teaspoon of cinnamon to mix.  I inhaled mine with no butter, and I am a butter kind of girl.  I am going to throw in some blueberies next time.  This recipe is staying on my bulletin board for use several times a week.  Oh and my picky eater inhaled them as well.  They were done in 16 minutes on the dot; made exactly one dozen muffins.  PS I did sift my flour, that also may have contributed to the tenderness of the finished product.  Cannot speak as to whether or not they keep well as I just made my batch less than one hour ago.

Light, fluffy, and absolutely delicious. I agree with others: add 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla. If you're looking for something a little sweeter, toss in a generous handful of chocolate chips at the end.

I loved these. They were so perfect. I used apple sauce instead of oil. and I baked them at 350 for 18 minutes, since they were in a mini muffin pan.

I just made these muffins tonight.  I added 1 tsp of cinnamon since I love this spice.  They have a lovely flavour, fairly mild but quite enjoyable.  I will make these again changing the quantities to make 12 muffins not 8.

The muffins were beautiful and a nice soft texture, but the flavour was bland even after I added 3/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla.

These were moist and easy to make. They were not the most flavorful muffins ever, but they were a perfect, everyday snack. They were a hit w/ my 4 & 2 yr old boys because they weren't too overwhelming... not too sugary, not too "healthy"!! I added a splash of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon. I didn't have quick oats, but the regular worked just fine. I'll make these again to have sitting around for the Christmas weekend.

I had one of these at a friend's house and fell in love.  She makes them with frozen raspberries!  YUMMY!  I also like to add a few chocolate chips.  And because I wasn't able to find buttermilk the first time I made these, I now exclusively use Coconut Milk in the place of the buttermilk.  Try them!  They will become a regular in your rotation!  Best of all, they are super easy!

This is favorite recipe in our home. Instead of using store bought buttermilk, I made my own by adding the juice of a Meyer lemon to a cup of milk. I also added the zest of the fabulous lemon and it was delicious.

These are excellent and addictive! I've made them several times. I add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. I've also made it with applesauce in place of oil. Tastes great both ways. It has always made 12 nice sized muffins for me.

I had buttermilk I needed to use up. So I tried out this recipe. I followed it to a tee. But I did add cinnamon and nutmeg as well. Plus a little bit of Honey, and they turned out great. I will make these again.

These are great muffins. When I made them I added 2 scoops of protein powder and 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to the flour.  I sprinkled on a little nutmeg and added about 1/4 cup of applesauce to the oat mixture and baked them for 17 minutes and they were fantastic

Delish!! I am unable to follow a recipe exactly, so here are the changes I made: I added 1 t vanilla to the buttermilk/oat mixture, subbed 1/4 c oat bran for 1/4 cup of the flour, used whole wheat pastry flour instead of white flour and cut the salt to 1/4 t.  I also added 1/3 c each dried cherries and sliced almonds, but I will probably experiment with other fruit & nut combinations.  It comes out fantastic!  So light and fluffy, even with my "healthifying" substitutions.

These were amazing! So moist and delicious. I didn't have any buttermilk so I used Greek-style yogurt (full-fat), so maybe that's why they were so rich. My only complaint is that they came close to burning at the edges and I had to turn the oven way down. I'll cook them at 375 next time. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these muffins exactly as written. I made them to go with chili instead of cornbread, and for that I thought they were quite good (toasted with a little butter).  As a snack or breakfast muffin though, they are too bland for my taste.  They were a nice texture and easy to make, so I do think I will try them again with some additions like fruit, cinnamon, or vanilla as others have suggested.

I liked these muffins. I didn't follow the directions exactly . I accidently added oatmeal to the sugar/oil/egg mix instead of the sour mix i had sitting next to the bowl. So i just decided to mix everything together. It seemed a bit too wet but i let it sit for a few minutes and it thickened up nice. I added some chocolate chips to the top of some and some cranberries one the others and left some plain. I found them a tiny bit too salty but no one else thought so. My kids loved them.

These are nice, dense muffins. I added cinnamon, vanilla and milk chocolate chips to mine. They were good but still needed a little something else. I'll try them again and perhaps add some brown sugar to the mix.

I used this as a base recipe for pumpkin muffins.  I used about a half of a cup or so of pumpkin puree and added a tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  Not to pumpkiny or sweet.  Will make these again.

I was so disappointed after reading all the wonderful reviews. I followed the recipe exactly. I thought these were pretty bland. Maybe they would have been better had I added some extra ingredients like some of the others did. Gail F.

Very tasty... :)  I made a batch of these for breakfast, primarily sticking to the recipe but I did substitute 1/2 cup milk+1/2 cup buttermilk for the 1 cup buttermilk. I feel that the batter would have seemed too thick otherwise. But these are so delicious slathered with honey butter.

These are wonderful!!  The only change I made was to use old fashioned oats instead of the quick cook, so I pulsed them in the food processor several times to get them down to quick cook size and they worked beautifully.  Let cool for another 5-10 minutes out of the pan so the wrapper didn't stick to the muffin.  Oh, and not sure what we did, but we ended up making 10 muffins and cooking for 15 minutes.  I'm looking forward to playing around with add ins - we have some beautiful fresh blueberries that would be lovely in these.

These muffins were moist and not overly sweet, as some muffins can be. I did add about 1 tsp. of vanilla for additional flavor.

I didnt get to try one of these, but my bf mentioned that they were good and had me make another batch, which again I didnt get to try any of. Easy way to get rid of extra buttermilk!

Great muffins! I didn't have enough oil left so I used sour cream instead and I added vanilla and a handful of chocolate chips to entice my fussy kids...they loved them and so did I!

These were amazing. I altered the recipe to make them slightly healthier and fit the ingredients I had on hand. I substituted 3 T of melted butter and 1 T of unsweetened applesauce for the oil (I could probably increase the applesauce and decrease the butter by a tablespoon each and they'd still be great). I used 1/2 cup of wheat flour instead of 1/2 cup of the white flour. And I added a teaspoon of vanilla. Also, I got 11 muffins instead of 8 (baked them for about 12 minutes). Enjoy!

I added frozen raspberries & blueberries, vanilla and used 2 eggs.  Yummy and they keep me full for hours if I eat 2!  Oh, and I added some wheat germ in place of some of the flour.

I think this recipe is almost identical to the one my mom made when I was growing up (Better Homes & Gardens Cookbook).  These are just good, wholesome breakfast food.  I used rolled oats (and added a few unsoaked ones to the batter for texture), substituted prune baby food for all but 1 tsp of the oil, and added vanilla and cinnamon.  Will use half whole-wheat flour next time.  Delicious!

My kids wanted cinnamon muffins and I wanted something healthy.  With some modifications this fit the bill.    I doubled the recipe, used 1/2 whole wheat flour, and added 1T. cinnamon and 2t. nutmeg.    We were out of buttermilk so I added a little Iemon juice to the milk to curdle it.  I also tried a crumb topping but it proved too heavy and caved in the tops.    With the modifications I would give it 5 stars.

These muffins are very moist, and it's the buttermilk that makes them great. My daughter loves them and she's kind of picky.  She likes that they don't have any "extras" like nuts , raisins, etc.

These were just fine.  They weren't out of this world, but I liked them.  I added vanilla, but I didn't add the cinnamon as suggested by others b/c I wanted to serve these with dinner and not as a breakfast item.  I made them with a pumpkin and black bean chili, which was a good combo.

I followed the recipe nearly exactly except I did add the tsp of vanilla and cinnamon as some reviewers suggested. I didn't really taste these flavors or any other. While the muffin has a good texture and makes a nice base for butter or jam, it really does not have a flavor on its own.

These muffins are excellent.  The first time I made this recipe exactly as written and it was amazing.  The second time I decided to add some cinnamon and raisins, and it turned out even better.  This is a great recipe and has become a regular part of my baking.

These were okay.  Very basic muffin, a bit bland but that's what makes it good comfort food.  Not bad once I added a bit of butter and jam.

Good muffin, good flavor, moist, good for you with all the oatmeal. I used some whole wheat flour and used applesauce for 1/2 the oil to help healthy it up. My 5 & 2yr old like them.  I added rasins to a couple.  I think I'll try adding some cinnamon next time.

Excellent! I made these to use up some buttermilk I had leftover from making homemade butter.  I used a little wheat flour in place of a little of the white flour, and I think I could have gotten away with 1/2 and 1/2. Can't wait to make them again!

These were really good. Not very sweet, but I liked that. I added a shredded carrot, raisins, vanilla extract, cinnamon. Subbed applesauce for half of the oil.  Also subbed whole wheat pastry flour for half of the flour. Very moist and soft.

These are very good and moist. I did use old fashioned oats and really liked the texture, taste.  I accidentally used 1 1/2 cups buttermilk and oats, used one egg, same amount of oil and sugar, then realized i had done that. I then added some extra flour and 1/4 teaspoon more of baking soda and flour after I realized but kept other proportions the same. they came out fine. Everyone liked them, thank goodness bc I just bought a 25 lb bag of old fashioned oats by accident !

I thought these were excellent muffins.  I added some cinnamon and vanilla, as well as some raisins. They were very moist and flavorable. Next time I will also add chopped walnuts.  I will definately make them again.

excellent.  great muffins to go with coffee or just a quick snack.  I've made these several times when i need to use up buttermilk and they are always a welcome treat.

Amazingly moist and delicious! I used honey instead of brown sugar (didn't have any around) and still turned out absolutely wonderfully.

I did not care too much for these muffins. They were bland in flavor, although they did look beautiful.
