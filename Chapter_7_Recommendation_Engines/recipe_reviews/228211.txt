Super easy and delicious.  Did not wait the full week to eat them because we like them a little more crunchy.  Waited only 3 days and they were perfect.

These are really good.  I want my pickles crunchy and lets face it, you can't can them or process them without them becoming softer.  I used two packages of Persian Cucumbers (small 6" cucumbers) from Trader Joe's which worked out perfectly for the two quart jars.  I didn't add any onions because I didn't have sweet ones but I most certainly will next time.  I mixed the sugar and vinegar together but added the spices directly to the jars so they'd be even.  I poured the sugar/vinegar mixture over them and sealed them.  Occasionally when I went into the refrigerator I would shake them because all the spices will settle to the bottom.  I will be making these again and again.  I have just tasted them after 1 week and they are good but still taste of cucumber.  I will be interested to see how the flavor and crispness develops after more time.  I think I will keep the liquid and spices and just add more cucumbers to the jar.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is my go-to recipe for quick pickling. I modified it to 1c. vinegar and 1/2 c. sugar. It really cuts the sweetness, and lets the other spices shine through.

I am so thankful I found this recipe.  It is super easy and they taste great from what everyone tells me.  I don't like Pickles at all.  The longer you can wait the better they taste

Eh......... None of us cared for these too much. They are SO sweet. Too sweet. I know there are people who prefer sweet pickles. If so, then I'm sure this is the recipe for you. Unfortunately we prefer more of a tangy, garlicky type. These did not do well for us. Sorry!

I made these pickles last week yummy! They are my favorite pickles and so easy to make, now that I am retired I can do more in the kitchen! I have always done a lot of cooking and baking but now with cooking shows and online recipes it's so much fun! My dear 45 year hubby is honest about keepers or not-I love that.

My first time making pickles and they were delicious!  I didn't want a bread-and-butter-sweet pickle, so I cut the sugar to 1/2 c.  Also, when I added the liquid to the jars, it wasn't even close to full (because I left out 1 c. sugar or maybe because I should have squeezed in more cukes), so I added 1 c. of water.

Went and bought more cukes so I could make more of these!.  Even my hubby,, who is not a huge fan of bread and butter pickles, loved them.  I added some sliced carrots and fresno peppers from the garden, and they were all delicious.  We also started on them after just two days, and they were great, although the flavor did develop more over time.

Love this recipe. I regularly cut up the pickles and onions to put in salads and if I do, I don't need to add any dressing. One thing I did do though is cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup. I've made it with Splenda instead of sugar also and that works fine as well.

While I did like the pickles, I didn't even use the whole amount of  sugar called for and they were still way too sweet. I did not want a bread and butter pickle. They sat in the fridge almost 2 weeks before I tasted them so when I finally did  I had to add more salt and a little more vinegar. They are better now but next time I'll add maybe 3/4 cups of sugar, if that. Also I didn't have any turmeric so I left that out, not sure if that mattered or not.
I have canned pickles for years and I had some cukes still coming in from my garden, there weren't enough to can (and I had already done some canning) so this was a good way to use them up.
Thank you!

Delicious! Just tried these after only four days and almost couldn't stop eating them. I am a pickling newbie, so I wanted an easy recipe. I can't see any reason to make it more complicated than this!

Great recipe with a great name. Easy to make and so delicious. We always have a jar or two on hand. I leave out the turmeric because I don't care for that flavor in my pickles, but I add everything else.

I absolutely dispise pickles or at least always have.  I can eat one or two store bought bread and butter pickles but that's it.  I had way too many cucumbers this year so figured I would try making refrigerator pickles.  This was the first recipe I came across.  Made them last week.  My son has been dying to try them.  He LOVES pickles.  So tonight we tasted them.  Yes I tried them too.  OH MY they are the BEST tasting pickles ever!!!  I am totally in love with them and making them again tomorrow with the remaining cucumbers that I have!  The two jars I made are not going to last long.  :)

Fantastic pickles!  Easy recipe!  Took 5 minutes to prep.  I doubled the recipe and put in gallon glass jar.  Everyday I shake the container to mix it up.  Amazing pickles!!!!

Loved it!!  Very easy and everyone who tried them loved them and asked for the recipe.  I did make a little bit of a modification.  I added 1 cup of water to the broth.  Delicious :)

Easy to make, but found someone else who tried this, not on allrecipes, she just likes the recipes, but not a supporter of app, anyway she said even easier is to cut up cucumbers how you want, Spears or slices, and do the liquid as they suggest, bring it to a boil, don’t let it boil but one minute, and pour over the cucumbers in the jars. It works exactly the same as recipe but without the three hour wait   And they are delicious Recipe is sweet so I will probably cut the sugar like so many others said....at least 1/2 cup for sure possibly in half. Other than that, only other thing is it calls for way too many onions in my opinion, sliced thinly they get in the way and are hard to untangle. I will leave them out next time as I feel they add nothing.
