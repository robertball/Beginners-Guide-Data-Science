I used this as a side dish for Aussie Chicken from this site.  I needed to cook some bacon for the chicken and I saw some reviewrs say that they thought a bit of crumbled bacon would taste good with this side dish.  So, I used just a little bit of the bacon drippings to "fry" up the corn and onions.  The result was amazing.  It tasted wonderful and the hubby and I both really liked.  I know not a healthy dish...but who cares.  Tasted great.  Thanks for the post.

I substituted 2 cups of corn for the 4 fresh ears-this was a great side with barbecued ribs.

I grew up with this. I often add some chopped green bell peppers and on occassion, some fried bacon (crumbled). However, it really is good as is. Great side to burgers or grilled BBQ chicken. Fresh sweet corn is the best but I have used frozen corn w/ decent results.

For folks who have not caramelized onions before - the process takes at least 20 minutes at low temp.  Start the onions (with butter and salt/spice) first and once they get brown, and sweet, and delicious... :) then add the corn.

Ive done this several times.  It's very good for such a simple recipe.   Sometimes I add red bell pepper for color and flavor.  My kids actually love it!

I have made this alot. The only thing I do diffrently is to saute cut up bacon first. When the bacon is a little crisp I add the onion saute till limp then add corn and fry till hot with salt pepper and garlic to taste. Omit the butter because your using the bacon grease to cook everything. I have also used Italian frozen green beans in place of corn.

This is an awesome summertime side dish. If using frozen corn, boil it for a few minutes first with 1-2 tablespoons of sugar. It will be as tender and sweet as fresh

We totally love this recipe!  I have been asked for the recipe numerous times as it is perfect for a bring along to a BBQ or a picnic.  I cook the corn on the cob for about five minutes in boiling water - shock it in ice water - then cut the corn off the cob.  This makes it easier to cut the corn off the cob and it doesn't take as long to cook.  I really only make this in the summer because there is just no substitute for fresh corn on the cob. This recipe is also very versatile as it is great served hot, warm and cold!

This is a simple but excellent recipe.  However, cook the onions first then add the corn for just 3 or 4 minutes.  When you do the corn first, the corn gets overcooked.

Tasty recipe and easy.  I make it as Michelle submitted but when we are out of fresh corn - I simply saute the onions first and then add drained cans of plain corn or mexican style - whatever I have.

If you don't have frsh corn, don't use the tasteless canned corn. I buy the steamfresh corn. I slowly carmelize the onion, 1/2 tsp minced garlic, and some slat and pepper in the pan while the corn is steaming in the microwave. About 20 minutes later, once the onion is golden and translucent, I stir in the corn. DELISH!

Who knew something so quick and simple could be so good! Of course, with 2 TBSP REAL butter and FRESH corn, how could it not! Will not make while I'm STICKING to a healthy diet... If you love corn and cooked onion(and are not watching the fat or carbs) you should try this TERRIFIC  recipe! We always use red onion and add fresh chopped tomato to this.

Great recipe!

I've been on a low carb diet plan and this just fit right in.

I threw in green peppers and spring onions, and some chunks of chicken for protein. Makes a great meal instead of a side dish.

Yummy!  My whole family loved this one.  I didn't have fresh corn so I used 2 cans of corn instead.  I also used 1/4 a red onion. I will make this again.

Oh yes, and adding one minced jalapeño gives just the right amount of heat to this.

Have made this for years (I'm 75 so I mean years)  with the fresh sweetcorn from our garden. However,  I always add chopped green pepper and garlic and a tad bit of milk while it is cooking. Extra YUMMY. This is our family favorite while corn is in season except for, of course, the grilled garlic butter corn on the cob. During off season and our palate drools for it I do use canned corn. Freshlike  is best used that way as it is canned with no juice.  More like fresh.

Simple but very good.  I got great reviews when I brought this to a potluck!  I used two whole bags of corn, 1 1/2 yellow peppers (so they hid well in the corn so the kids did not notice), 1 large white onion, 4 cloves garlic, 6 TBSP butter or so,salt and pepper.  First I cooked the onion, then added the peppers once the onions were very soft, waited a few minutes then added all the corn and cooked until the corn started to slightly brown.  YUMMY! I will make this again....and again :-)

This was delicious!  I used canned corn and I can't wait until I get some fresh corn to cook it again. It is very close to a side dish that I ordered from a restaurant in Hilton Head, SC, but they added mushrooms to it as well.  I might try that next time too!  Thanks for the recipe!

Just as pictured, Bi-color sweet corn, Vadalia onions, and fresh tomatoes. I'm in heaven. Cook the onions just enough to blanch. Also, I used a "light" butter. There are several good ones out there.

Great as is, but I definitely think replacing the butter with bacon grease would be sinfully good. Hell, I bet a good powdering with parmesan cheese would kick some corn-butt too! I'll try that next time.

had some cooked corn on the cob so chopped up 1 vidalia and tossed that in the pan with the butter.  If corn is already cooked do not put it in the pan before frying the onions.  onions should be browned before throwing in the corn or corn will burn.  heavenly!

This recipe falls into the category of simplicity at it's best. If this seems like too high a compliment aimed at the lowly ear of corn, you may want to give this dish a try. THREE INGREDIENTS! (+S&P). I made this exactly as written. The corn smells so good as it is sauteed with the butter. I can understand why some would choose to cook the onions first. They do need about 20 minutes to become heavy in flavour and achieve caramelization. However I'm inclined to think that this was not the submitter's intention. "Just beginning to get crispy" is what the instructions tell us to look for. For the record I do really like caramelized onions. The deep flavour impact they produce is heavenly. I think the star of this recipe is the corn. Using fresh is undoubtedly the way to go if possible. 4 ears of fresh corn often costs less than 1 dollar. You cannot get much better a vegetable than fresh corn to provide the essence of relaxed summer meals. This is a good example of seasonable dining. I used 1/2 of a smallish vidalia onion which provided another layer of sweetness. Thanks for posting this recipe. My family really enjoyed it.

This is heaven. I used Incredible Corn from Tacoma Boys. No leftovers. Next time, I'll use half butter, half bacon grease. I only garnished with sea salt and fresh ground black pepper. Wonderful.

very good way to dress up corn. i used 2 cups of frozen corn since that is what i had on hand... i also added 3 small cloves of garlic. i loved it. hubby wasn't sure about the onion/ corn combo, but he cleaned his plate and had seconds so it must have been OK.

I don't know where I've been all my life.  I had never considered combining fresh sweet corn and sweet onions before in a side dish.  I actually made this recipe as written, an aberration for me, and it was wonderful!!  Perhaps others' poor results came from inferior fresh corn, I don't know.  What I DO know is that this is going to become a summertime staple in my house!!  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Excellent! This was so good.  I used a bag of frozen corn and wasn't sure how sweet it was going to be so I added a Tbs of sugar.  Fabulous!  I will always do my corn this way for now on.

This was great.  The fresh corn makes all the difference in the taste.  Even though the onions did add flavor, I will try this without them next time.  I like the corn-on-the-cob with butter and salt taste--the onions kind of threw that off.

Have made this dish several times. It is good as is, but I tweaked it a bit. Carmalize the onion first in bacon grease, added bell peppers, jalapeno, crushed garlic. Saute that a bit then add corn. and diced tomatoe. No left overs

This is so easy and good. You can use yogurt butter instead of whole butter. I also add green chile for a more zesty taste.

We really enjoyed this! I followed the recipe as written except I did add a few sliced grape tomatoes towards the end. I used 5 ears of fresh corn, so I added a tad more butter. I was getting a bit tired of  grilled fresh corn on the cob since we have so much available here this time of year, so this is a nice change. I really love the flavor the onion gives this dish, and using fresh corn really adds a wonderful sweetness . The addition of the tomatoes did add a nice pop of flavor also. I will be making this simple side dish again for sure! Thanks :)

OMG never had this before.  Was wonderful different way to take fresh corn on the cob and change the flavor and texture.  I would give this 10 stars if I could.  I had 3 dozen ears and was going to blanch most, but this will turn it to 1/2 that amount.  Just an add on  ;  I made it the second day with a few home grown tomatoes thrown in after it was done.  Even a better combo.

Who'd have thunk something so simple could be so good. I added a tbsp of sugar for just a hint more sweetness and a few slices of cooked & crumbled bacon w/1-2 tbsp of its drippings for additional flavor; but overall this was simply a phenominal recipe.This is definately an addition to my recipe book.

Very good.  I usually don't like the corn very "crispy" so I didn't fry it for very long.  I used olive oil instead of butter.  Came out great.  The onions don't overpopwer the recipe, but give the corn a nice complement.

I make this a lot using green onion and adding garlic salt, garlic pepper, and cayenne.  Very good.  When I use fresh corn on the cob, I grill it first then cut it off the cob, which gives it a nice grilled look.

This was delicious, even with frozen corn and without the onions (per my husband's request).  What a great diversion from boiled corn.  One thing, though-- if you happen to have leftovers (which is highly unlikely), they are rather dried out and chewy.  Definitely don't make this ahead!  Otherwise, it's fabulous!

Wow!!!  This was excellent, my husband raved over this one.  I did add bell pepper and instead of using salt, I used garlic salt.  Yummy!!  I will definately make this again...Thanks.

Made this with my Thanksgiving dinner - I also put it in a casserole dish, sprinkled a little paprika on top and let it bake for about 15 minutes while the turkey was being carved.  It is a wonderful variation.  Thanks!

This was really good & a change from the old boring sidedish of corn.  I added a chopped green bell pepper & it was VERY good!

I like onions, but this was overpowering. I followed the directions, but it just wasn't good. I won't let it go to waste -- I will use in a soup where the onion taste will be masked.

I have been making this this quick, tasty recipe for years, but I sauté the onions in bacon grease first,(Whaaa, what was that, ohhh, it was the audible sound of the healthy eats police gasps).  
I then add the corn and some butter to finish it up.  Fresh sweet corn season is so short, we usually have this 2 or 3 times a year, and LOVE it!!!!

This is my go-to side dish quite a bit these days.  I have changed it a little: I use olive oil instead of butter, and I use green onion instead of sweet onion.  I also dice up and use some celery, which adds such a nice flavor.  We love it and eat it all the time.

I made charred corn like this tonight except I used canola oil.  You char the corn kernels for about 1 minute then add ginger (preferably fresh) and add some minced garlic, red pepper flakes and salt and pepper. The corn gets nice and sweet and contrasts nicely with the other seasonings.

This was great!  The only change I made was adding half a green pepper I needed to use up.  My family devoured it and demanded more, even my onion-hating sister.  I plan to make again soon as a side for Baked Teriyaki Chicken from this site, maybe with some bacon crumbled in.

Wonderful flavor on this dish! I used frozen whole kernal corn and added a slice of precooked bacon to it as well. I only used a quarter of a sweet onion. The corn was starting to overcook though before the onion started to turn crispy, so I settle for translucent onion instead.

I fry bacon, take that out of the skillet once its done.  Add the onions to the bacon grease, once they are soft I add the corn, a few minutes before taking off the eye I add the bacon(crumbled).  I usually use frozen corn.  Do not overcook - it will become sticky.  This is the only way I get the family to eat corn

This was fantastic!  I know that many people don't like when someone significantly changes the recipe and then rates it and it bothers me sometimes too. So, I apologize in advance.  However, I did use many of the suggestions made by other reviewers. First, and this is not a change, I did use fresh ears of corn blanched for 5 minutes and shocked in cold water.  I cooked three slices of bacon and used the grease to caramelize the onions and broke up the bacon to use in the recipe .  I used only about 1/2 tablespoon of butter.  I also added some diced fresh Roma tomatoes. Next time I'll use more sweet onion because they added great flavor when caramelized.  I also added some Splenda and salt tasting until I got the right combination I was looking for.  Two of us ate all four portions!  Delicious!

This was surprisingly tasty considering its simplicity.  I made this to go with pot roast and substituted some beef drippings for the butter.  I also used frozen corn and a plain old yellow onion.  Which I guess means I used this recipe more as a guideline, but it was still shockingly delicious.

This is a wonderful side dish yum ! For those of you who like okra, try adding frozen okra(thawed).For a main dish add bite size yellow squash and chicken (white meat) , salt, pepper,a little garlic salt and you wont be disapointed . They make this at the world famous Silver Dollar City in Branson Mo. It's called Succotash..Very yummy. Thanks for the recipe mom of 2 boys

Awesome recipe. I made this several times this year with fresh corn, it brings out the natural sweetness. Once I added bacon and cabbage just because I had it on hand, come out great, will be making this recipe for years to come.

I loved this recipe! I didn't have fresh corn, so I used a whole bag of frozen corn. I added a pepper, bacon and 2 cloves of garlic, based on previous reviews. It turned out wonderful. It was such a great way to jazz up a bag of frozen corn.

This is very tasty but I almost didn't make it based on the photos.  For those who like carmelized onions I suggest adding the diced onion to 1 TBS butter and 1 TBS bacon grease or oil and frying until most pieces are starting to brown before adding corn and then fry them together, stirring often, until most of the onion is very brown and starting to crisp and the corn looks roasted.  Note to self:  use a 12 oz bag of corn and a med sweet onion, add a pinch of sugar after adding corn to onions.

A great way to cook corn.  I used frozen sweet corn and added bell pepper and a dash of seasoned salt.  It had a very good flavor and was a nice change from plain, boiled corn.  Served as a side to Fried Chicken with Creamy Gravy from this site and white rice.

5 stars all the way!! I cant wait to make this for my next cookout. I did add a orange pepper bec thats all I had on hand and I couldnt imagine it without it. I think it made the dish so much more tastier. I also added fresh garlic and a tablespoon of lemon juice. Thanks!! This is really a great way to prepare corn:)

Not sure how I never thought of combining onions and corn, since I am a fan of both...but now that I figured it out I'll never make a side of corn another way.  This was fantastic...thanks for the recipe!

HEAVEN!  My corn hating husband loved this.  My 3 year old & 7 year old daughters had seconds.  This was easy and wonderful.
I made it w/ thawed corn on the cob that needed to be used up.  Next week I'll be making it to go with our turkey day dinner.

There's only me in the household. I used one fresh corn, quarter of an regular small white onion, 2 tbs butter, a pinch of brown sugar, and a little garlic salt/ black pepper to taste to finish. An easy, tasty summer side dish.

7.20.18 Corn was on sale for 6 ears/ $1.00, so it was the perfect time to give this recipe a try.  My corn was extra sweet, and this was just so darn fresh, tasty, and easy.  I had a small piece of jalapeño in the fridge, so I added that in, as well. Would recommend not overcooking the corn because that little bit of crunch you get just shouts “fresh.”   I’ve made fried corn many times using frozen corn, but using fresh corn make this an awesome side dish.

This makes an excellent side dish! I made this recipe "as is", however as some users stated I might add either some bacon or a diced jalapeno for some extra kick. Pairs well with the Turkey Cheeseburger Meatloaf recipe on this site.

I love this awesome way to cook fresh corn.  Hubby does too, and asks me to fix it this way every time.  I do saute the sweet onion (Walla Walla or similar) in butter until translucent, then I add the corn.

DELICIOUS!! I had to use canned corn but it was still really good. I used half a big Vidalia and added some chopped fresh tomato like I saw in one of the pictures. I put the tomato in just for the last 3-4 min to warm them but not really cook them.

Yum! I have cut the corn off the cob for years after it is cooked for kids with braces. But cutting it off before cooking was so much easier and I loved the different taste of cooking the corn in the skillet with sweet onion. The family thought it was great!

I have made this twice in the last 2 weeks! The first time I made it following the recipe exactly and my 12 yr old who actually prefers broccoli to corn loved it! I made it again last night for my brother and sister-in-law with the following changes based on other reviews...
1. Caramalized onions first in approx. 1 Tbsp butter and about a teaspoon of bacon grease. 
2. Added a tiny bit of garlic powder, seasoning salt and pepper instead of just regular salt and pepper.
3. During the last couple of minutes I sprinkled about 1/2 teaspoon of sugar over the whole thing, stirred then covered for 3 or 4 minutes. 
Result? Rave reviews!!!! Thanks for a great recipe that even my corn hating daughter loves!

Used 2 cups frozen corn, 1.5 Tbsp of butter, rough chop medium sweet onion. Have cooked this more than 5 times. It's my go-to masquerading-as-a-vegetable side dish.

I read the reviews and thought the people complaining about too much butter were being wusses. But then I made it and caramelized the onion with the 2 Tbsp of butter and the end result, after mixing in the corn, was a greasy, guilty side dish. I wish I had used only 1/2-1 Tbsp.

Wanted a simple side dish for a weeknight dinner and this was perfect.  Used frozen corn instead of fresh, then followed the recipe as written.

Ahhhh, so good. My oldest daughter ate the heck out of it, and wanted to eat the rest. She doesn't care for onions, but she helped make it and carmelized them perfect and realized that sweet tasting onions was the bomb! I may have made this dish too sweet. Will most likely cut a tad back on how much sugar I added to my frozen corn and my onions. But, excellent all around! Great recipe that you can change up and still get a great taste.

I really liked this as a side dish.  Next time I might add a diced jalapeno pepper to spice it up a bit, but I can see why kids would love it as is.  Thanks for sharing!

Great side dish. Had some extra ears of corn left over from the 4th and did not want to make the usual cream corn etc. The addition of the onions was fantastic. I did not have sweet onions available so used regular yellow onions and added a teaspoon of sugar. This was a very savory side dish that turned into the main course for my 9 year old son.

I originally made this with canned white shoepeg corn (I can't stand the normal yellow canned corn).  While it's still canned corn, it was so delicious.  Here is what I did:  Sauteed some minced garlic in the butter and then added the onion (I used a whole yellow onion by the way 'cuz I love onion).  I sauteed that for a bit to reduce the juices.  Then I added 2 cans of white shoepeg corn.  Cooked all of it down for a while, and sprinkling with salt and pepper through the process) until the whole concoction became this yummy corn, onion-y, garlicky, buttery flavor.  The corn and the onion really do blend nicely together. And with garlic, butter, salt and pepper, it's simply sublime.  I do use a tad more butter than recommended, just so it can reduce and cook down more.  

Today I tried it with fresh white corn.  4 ears, same process as with the canned white corn.  So far it tastes great!!

so easy and so good! i did make some changes: 1. i doubled the recipe (for a meal for 7 ppl) 2. used regular yellow onions instead of sweet, since that's what i had on hand 3. canned corn instead of fresh- about 5.5 cups for the doubled recipe 4. some olive oil instead of the butter, to make the dish dairy-free  the prep time and cook time were both cut in half by using canned corn and oil.  the corn tastes so sweet. i can't wait to serve it!

Good stuff. I forgot to follow the instructions exactly, and just dumped all of the ingredients in - with some diced tomato - and it's all good stuff. Saving some for lunch tomorrow.

This was very good! Often the simple things are, I find. I've never had fresh corn this way and I'm so glad I tried it. I used 2 tsps butter and 2 tsps olive oil to sautee and added garlic and a dash of chili powder. I can definitely see myself making this often. Thanks for a great recipe!

Loved it! I copied a few others suggestions and added in onion and bell peppers that I had left over from a previous dish.  I used Smart Balance instead of butter (very health conscience) and then used garlic salt and pepper.  Fabulous and definitely a staple from now on!

I have made this recipe for years and absolutely love it.  If corn is not in season, use frozen corn.  I add Lawry's seasoned pepper to mine and I honestly think it is the key ingredient.

I made ONE alteration to this recipe...I grilled the corn for a few minutes to get that grilled flavor before I cut if from the cob and tossed in some cilantro and lime juice for kicks.  This was an AWESOME and colorful recipe.

Yum, this was great. I used shallots instead of regular onion. I added some minced garlic, chili powder and finely chopped hot red pepper. Yum. It was delicious. I can see endless options to what can be added to this recipe.

Very simple to make and excellent taste.  I added some olive oil to replace some of the butter, and it worked wonderfully.

I've made this before using 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil blend. I also add some minced fresh garlic with the onions and I saute the yellow onions first to get them brown, then add the corn. It's delicious and a big crowd pleaser!

This was a very different recipe for me. I've always loved corn & onions, but never thought of putting them together. I used red onions instead of white or yellow onions. Very good!

I enjoyed this more than my fiance.  A nice change of pace from regular corn & butter.  The corn crisps up nicely and the onions are a nice touch.  A tad too much butter tho...will cut back next time.

Tired of the same ol', same ol' corn side dish, I made this to accompany Oven Baked BBQ Ribs using frozen corn out of necessity.  Sauteing the corn made it sweeter... can't wait to try this in the summer when the corn is fresh from the garden.  Thanks!

Great...tasted really good. You can add just about anything you want to this recipe..garlic, bell pepper..ect. But using REAL butter is the key,in my opinion. I love fresh veggies and this is so simple to make also.

A very tasty side dish on any occasion, but I add at least 4 slices of bacon and a little garlic.  My kids love corn, especially when it is prepared this way.

THIS WAS WELL LIKED BY THE FAMILY. ALTHOUGH I DID MAKE A COUPLE CHANGES.  I USED CANNED WHITE AND YELLOW CORN AND ADDED ABOUT A TEASPOOM OF MINCED GARLIC.  BETTER THEN THE USUAL.

My roomies and I really liked this a lot.  I used one can of drained corn and added it after the onions were pretty soft/browned.  I added some garlic powder, just a dash of minced roasted garlic and cayenne pepper and lots of salt and pepper.  It was delicious!

Soooooooooo good....sooooooooo simple.....I didn't use butter, but I will the next time.  I had cooked some bacon for the Bacon Wrapped Chicken (on this site) and used the drippings to brown the onions.  I added frozen corn, and done!
Easy & delicious!!  My DH loved it, and even my picky son liked it.  I will make again for sure....Thanks Michelle for the post.

This recipe tastes amazing yet is so simple to prepare.  It's best with fresh corn but I needed to use up a can of corn the other day so I used it in this recipe and it was still really good.  If you're trying to limit the calories, you can use less butter and just keep the pan covered so the corn and onions steam a little bit instead frying in all the oil.  Or you can be bad and make it by the recipe and it will be soooooo good!!!!  My super-picky boyfriend loves this and is always begging me to make it!

I purchased six ears of corn for my wife and I. We both LOVE corn of the cob.  This is the first corn of the season here in Washington state and wasn't as good as I had hoped. For our next meal, I tried this recipe and was really impressed with the taste... It taste better with this recipe than cooked on the cob!!

Amazingly simple. Received compliments on this dish. A corn per person is a good way to make sure there will be enough for everyone. I sprinkled sea salt on the corn while cooking instead of the regular granules, which makes for a nice burst of flavor every once in a while.

Ok tasting but missing something. I'll go back to the Barefoot Contessa Fresh Corn Salad next time I want the corn and onion combination.

A previous reviewer, Belapar, suggested making it with or without the onion.  Last night I made it without and it was fantastic.  You must use fresh corn!

This was pretty good as a side dish to steak.  I also threw in some chopped green pepper & seasoned with red/black pepper, which gave it a nice flavor.  I had to use frozen corn, but I'm sure the fresh tastes better and stays more crisp.

Make sure that you cook the onions to the point that they are not still hot.  It overpowered the corn flavor and we had to throw them away.

Needed a side dish to go with bbq ribs & baked beans. Substituted a drained can of corn for the fresh corn. Tasted awesome. Hubby liked so well he said it must be made instead of tater salad. ??

I have been making a similar dish for years.  To send it over the top, fry out 2 strips of bacon, setting the bacon aside.  Fry the corn and onion in the bacon grease instead of butter.  Dish it up in your serving bowl and crumble the bacon on top. Wow!

This was so good! I only added a red pepper because I had one in the fridge I didn't know what to do with. The thing I liked about this recipe is it makes older corn that had been sitting in the grocery awhile taste fresh and rich.  I can't wait to try it when the farms up here start having fresh picked sweet corn might be really amazing!

I used onion powder just because my son doesn't care for onions. It was really good and fast to make. Made it as a side to bbq sandwiches.

I just made this recipe tonight to have with baked scallops. It was  mentioned by a reviewer of the scallops as a nice side dish for the scallops. It was delicious, despite the fact that I didn't have fresh corn. I sautéed a small chopped onion and a pretty big garlic clove (finely chopped) in the two tablespoons of butter with salt & pepper. Once the onions were caramelized, I added the corn and continued to cook for about 7 minutes. Next time, I'll take more than one reviewer's advice and add crumbled cooked bacon. Easy and very tasty!

This is a great fried corn recipe. I always run the knife down the corn cob when all the kernels are off to get some of the yummy corn milk from the cob.I am from Birmingham AL.and we never added onion but it does taste really good in it. I also added about 1/4 cup half and half about 10 minutes befroe it was done, be sure and keep a watch on it if you add the cream because it may want to stick.

I sauteed bacon and onion and then added the corn which put this over the top for us. We'll definitely have it again. For those worried about eating healthy, just use turkey bacon and Smart Balance butter.

We loved this! I did change it a little... I simply started cooking the onions before adding the corn. We love caramelized onions so I got the onions on their way before cooking the fresh sweet corn. Very yummy!

I can give this 5 stars. I used bacon grease instead of butter and frozen corn instead of fresh. After reading some other comments, I added freshly dice tomatoes near the end. My entire family loved it, especially my 6yo. My son didn't care for it because of the tomatoes, so I picked them out. I also added a drop of freshly chopped garlic. Very very good recipe and many things can be added. Will definitely make again.

So I dunno... What's the right AR etiquette if you make something and a fairly picky eater cannot stand it? Do you rate the recipe down?  (He even Googled corn and onions 'cuz he didn't think anyone in their right mind should put them together -- funny, he loves corn, and likes onions more than I do. Why did the combo not work??)  I liked these but wasn't raving about them (like I said, onions aren't top of my list). I ate the rest of the batch no problem.    It's not the recipe's fault that we don't care for the taste, right? BUT: Isn't the purpose of the rating to alert others that the recipe may not be for everyone?? Oh the dilemma.  I'm going to rate this puppy square in the middle. I hope that is a good compromise.

This was an easy and tasty recipe to make. For a two person serving I used 1 1/2 c of corn and used cajun spice to accompany my cajun chicken.  I will certainly be making this recipe again.

Didn't think such a simple recipe could be so good!  I make this with frozen corn and it's still great.  I like making this in a cast iron skillet.  Seems to make it taste even better!  Make sure to add enough salt--that really seems to make all the flavor come through.

I made this last night and it was delicious! The onions make this recipe so savory while the corn is super sweet! I used 2 ears of corn and half an onion for 3 people and it was just right!

Very tastey- the picture had tomatoes but the recipe didnt.  We added them toward the end but probably should have earlier.  Fun recipe~ 2nd time making put the chopped tomatoes (instead of cherry toms) in at the end.  So yummy

This was great. I also used canned corn and I added some leftover diced tomatoes. This is how I will be making corn from now on. I loved it.

I needed a side dish, and this sounded simple enough. I didn't have fresh corn so I used can. This was awesome. Next time,I'll make sure I have fresh. I did add some cherry tomatoes to it like another viewer did. Goes to show, you don't need a lot to make something taste so good.

My father always makes this recipe.  He's been making it ever since I was a kid.  He always used two cans of corn rather than corn from a cob.  It goes GREAT with grilled steaks!

We didn't like this.  The corn was tough by the time the onions were browned.  I wouldn't make it again, but would suggest to others that they fry the onions first and then add the corn.

I loved this! I used around 1½ cups frozen corn (not thawed), around 1 TBS bacon grease, ½ a small onion, salt and pepper, and I added 2 medium-diced medium-sized potatoes (parboiled for around 7 minutes before adding). I fried the onion up in the grease until it started to brown, then added the potatoes for a couple minutes, then added the corn last. My daughter and I scarfed it, my husband ate it with minimal complaints (he has issues with corn, though). He said he'd eat it again, so it's a success! Thanks for sharing, Momof2Boys!

I made this last night for dinner and my daughter, who is a fast food queen and finicky eater, loved it. She liked it so much she just called me at work to tell me how much better it was the second day since she fixed a plate and took it to work for lunch. She NEVER does that!!

I had a can of corn and was looking for a VERY simple recipe.  This was perfect AND yummy!  I also added some shredded carrots - they didn't change the taste, but they really added a lot for presentation (and probably added some nutritional value).

This is yummy. I use our regional Vidalia onions when they are in season the same time as fresh corn. A sprinkle of bacon pieces on top is an oft requested addition.

Pretty darn tasty!  Served with baked scallops recipe from this site.  I added red and green peppers and some grains of desire spices.  Will definately make again soon and can't wait for summer to try it with fresh corn.

My husband and I thought this was a nice change.  We loved it!  I didn't use as much butter but the flavor was great.  I loved having the oniions in with it.  This is a fun recipe I will use agian.

Sorry, I didn't really care for this recipe.  I love fried corn, but had never thought to put onion in with the corn.  Big mistake - my boys hated it.  I thought it was ok, but definitely not worthy of 5 stars.

I'm not much of a corn fan, but I LOVE this recipe!  Makes me wonder why I never put these two together myself.

I LOVE the previous review. Genius! Anyway, this is a great recipe - simple, quick and delicious. I make it when I have corn left over from the grill. It's good with a wee shake of garlic powder. Thanks, Michelle!

Yum!  This is a great side, as is.  The second time I made it, I jazzed mine up a bit with a bit of chopped red bell pepper...not much, just enough to add some color.

A very good recipe, though nothing special. I made it with fresh corn from the cob and real butter.  It was a hit for Thanksgiving, and I will be making it again.

I love this recipe! There is nothing better than fresh corn and this really brings out the flavor.
