I like the recapie it sounds yummy! I think this is the one I'm gonna use for our Thanksgiving dinner! but it's much easier to cut the pumpkin and squash in half first then bake. not only is it easier to handle after you take it out of the oven but it takes 1/2 the time to cook. pre heat the oven to 400 degrees. cut you squashes in half and scoop out all the seeds then cover them with tin foil and place directly on the middle rack. it will take any where from 30 min to an hour for it to be done. It just depends on the size of your pumpkin. if it's not done after 30 min bake in 15 min increments till it is. Once it's fork tender let cool till you can handle it and just scoop it out of the shell. Happy cooking!

This soup is a fail-proof bowl of delicious-ness! I made it  for two, with leftover baked pumpkin pie pumpkin (about 2 cups) and a sweet potato, and it was the bomb. My hubby and I couldn't eat it fast enough...!

Delicious!  I changed it, BUT only because of what I had on hand! I bet that if I would have made it as is, it would have been 6 stars instead of five! I didn't have a pumpkin, so I used a can of pumpkin puree, and I didn't have any broth, so I used an extra can of coconut milk plus a can of water.  I didn't want to, but it's all I had.  Still great!  Helpfull hint - cover it while it heats on the stove!  It's kind of like spagheti sauce, in that it will bubble, and spew everywhere! So, just cover it while you warm it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Thanks so much for posting this! With Thanksgiving coming up, I needed to know how to bake a pumpkin for making soup and pies; I've moved to the UK, and I haven't seen any canned pumpkin anywhere! So, thanks so much for just that small part! :) (I didn't actually try the recipe so I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt, because it wouldn't let me post a message without rating the recipe) I do hope to try the whole recipe one day though; it sounds delicious, and right up my alley. Cheers!

This beyond amazing!  I took my leftover acorn squash and sweet potatoes from Thanksgiving and roasted a large pumpkin from Halloween.  It's absolutely perfect just the way it's written!

So great! I just used what I had:  one small pumpkin, acorn squash, corn, carrots, and sweet potatoes. Right now I am making it again but I'm just using two acorn squashes and a butternut squash.

I used leftover pumpkin filling, a whole acorn squash and a large sweet potato. I also used light coconut milk. It was what I had on hand. I used my immersion blender and added about a teaspoon of garam masala. That was just the kick it needed.

I love this recipe! I didn't have a pumpkin but I had a butternut squash and lemon instead of lime. The flavor profiles are very similar so I can say with confidence that this recipe is worth trying.

I thought this was too rich to even eat.  My 9 month old has eaten as baby food.

I used red potatoes and canned pumpkin to try out this recipe. I simmered it for 3 hours before increasing heat to soften the potatoes -then I pureed half of it and served it topped with croutons. a great recipe for using canned pumpkin after the holidays are over. ;)

This is great! I commonly make a pot of soup on the weekend to bring for lunch. My family doesn't much like squash or pumpkin but I do. I made this exactly as directed and it was lovely. One day I added some chicken to it and another day I added some rice. Both went well. Made it again the following week but forgot pumpkin and it was still tasty.

Made my own version with this as a base.  I added sweet potatoes, carrots, onions garlic 
Increased all the spice lots of coconut milk and served over basmati rice.  I also used coconut oil instead of  olive oil to be consistent with flavor. 
I brought to my school and it went fast. Will definitely make again

Good base but a little bland for my taste. I didn't think just mashing was enough- made the texture too stringy and I mashed and mashed because I didn't want to dirty the blender.   I'm the only one in the house that likes pumpkin so I'll be eating it for a while. To make it a little more favorable I added onion, garlic and a little curry then threw it the blender to smooth it out- much better that way in my opinion...

Soups are great because they can be easily modified to use what you may have on hand.  Only major change was adding around a teaspoon of curry.  Will make again!

This was great.  I used veggie broth to make it vegan.  Such a great combination!  I added some pumpkin pie spice but maybe it would have been better savory

Good, but I wouldn't make it again. Something was missing to boost up the flavours.

I never heard so much complaining in my life.  This recipe was so much work, and no one liked it.  I am going to try and doctor it up with one of our other favorite squash recipes.  It was just not our taste. My husband kept saying, "This stuff just needs something."  "Why didn't you make that other squash soup we really love?"
