We changed this recipe a LOT this time.  AFter searching through tens of frozen and refrigerated pie crusts and homemade pie crust recipes, the whole dinner just seemed way too fattening, even with lowfat cheese.  So, we cooked the filling up as directed, added the cheese, and it was delicious all on its own!  We got some rolls to serve it with and it was a filling (and less fattening) dinner. I think I would serve it on brown or spanish rice next time! MMM!

Great dish!  I followed some of the other reviewers' suggestions, and added 2
minced cloves of garlic and used 3/4 cup of salsa.  I also added a 1/2 can of 
corn, and used slightly less than 2 cups of grated cheese -- a pre-shredded 
Mexican blend and an extra sharp cheddar.  I didn't have a red bell pepper,
so I substituted with additional green bell pepper.  After removing from the 
oven, I recommend letting it sit 15 minutes or so before cutting, otherwise it 
could be runny.  All in all, a tasty, filling dish that I'll make again and again.

This was really good. I followed someone else's advice and didn't use a pastry crust. Instead, I layered one tortilla at the bottom of my pan and one in the middle. I would suggest adding some fresh chopped cilantro to this dish.

This was absolutely fabulous, and really not all that difficult to make!

I listened to other reviewers' comments and added extra salsa.  In fact, I added about a cup of salsa, which really gave it some zip!  I also went with half a red pepper and half a yellow pepper, because both my sister-in-law and I both hate green peppers.  I also used about two cups of Kraft's "Mexican" grated cheese and added a couple cloves of garlic (my theory is always that you can't have too much garlic).

I didn't have any trouble with the crust -- it cooked fine without requiring pre-baking.  (Except I used only bottom crusts.)  I ended up baking this at 350 degrees instead of 325 because I was making it at the same time as the "Awesome and Easy Creamy Corn Casserole" (also on this site), and had absolutely no trouble with it.

This was absolutely marvelous with the amendments I mentioned above!  Highly recommended!

This is a really nice recipe, sure to please vegetarians and non-veggies alike. I will definitely add it to the collection of recipes that I save for "mixed company" functions. I added half a can of well-drained corn into the mix, and made my own super easy crust. This would also be delicious with Gimme Lean Sausage Style (vegetarian "sausage") browned and crumbled into the mix. YUMMY.

I was somewhat disappointed with the recipe but I think it was because of the changes I made. I made the changes that were listed below, adding 1 cup of salsa instead of 1/3 and adding 2 cups of cheese. I used Pace Thick n'Chucky Salsa, but adding a cup was way too much. The bottom crust wound up being soggy with so much liquid. Next time I will decrease the amount of salsa. The additional cheese was nice, but really unnecessary. This is a very easy and quick recipe, but I think I will stick to the way it is written next time.

Yummy! I made this pie with only a few minor additions to the veggies...a can of green chiles in with the salsa, some corn and more peppers.  Next time I think I will skip the top crust to cut calories and fat and just crumble a little cornbread or corn chips on top instead.  Highly recommended.

Very good recipe! I added a can of fiesta corn (drained) and use 2 cans of black beans. My family loved it!  This is great with a salad for meatless Mondays!

What a horrible name for a FABULOUS recipe! This is YUMMY! I followed others suggestions and used 1 cup of salsa and 2 cups of cheese. I didn't use peppers. I thought it was a bit hot/spicy. This combination really does blend nicely together. Hubby turned up his nose at the recipe and then once he tasted it he was hooked. This is a keeper and such a nice alternative to meat. Thanks for sharing!

I changed this a bit by adding a pound of hamburger browned with some taco seasoning and added a can of corn and some salsa. For the bottom crust I used flour tortillias and topped it with crushed nacho chips. I kept all the other ingredidents the same. I made this the night before and popped it in the oven after work the next day.. It was SOOOOO good! We had this with a bit of sour cream and salsa on top and few spoons of my thick chili on the side.This is a keeper! Thanks!

I added about 1/2 pound of ground beef, browned with the peppers and the onion, and it was wonderful.  I doubled the amount of the salsa.  It was delicious and my family loved it.

WOW!!!  We loved this!  I only rate recipes that I have tried according to the original and I was very pleased with this one.  It had really great taste and even my 2-year old loved it.  It was also very filling.  We didn't eat more than 1 and 1/2 slices each.  The only thing I can say that I would like to fix is that there is definitely room for more filling since I used a big pie dish.  Next time I will try a few other suggestions from other reviewers for additional ingredients.  Right off the bat I was thinking of just adding a second can of beans or some re-fried beans.  Thanks Sal for a wonderful recipe - this one's a keeper!  We are hoping to be missionaries to Haiti and I'm sure I can tailor this recipe with ingredients from there!

A fun and delicious way to use beans. I used a bag of all ready cut up frozen peppers and onions to make it easier. I also made my own pie crust.

Followed some suggestions and doubled salsa, added corn, and skipped the top crust b/c I only had one.   This was super yummy and really very easy!  I will make it again, I'm sure and probably without the pie crust b/c it wasn't very necessary, though I imagine it'd be great with cornbread.  Thanks!

This dish has been a family favorite for a few years. I usually follow the recipe exactly, except I add 1-2 Tbsp. chili powder and increase the black beans to 2 15-oz. cans.  We like to serve it with sour cream and guacamole on the side.  Delicious!

This was just ok for us. It was super easy to do and throw together but it tasted the same as a mexican casserole without the tortillas. I increased the beans (used pinto) to two cans and was glad I did, or it would have been a flimsy filling. Increased the cheese to two cups and salsa to one cup. Still came out pretty dry.  Swapped the green peppers for corn and added diced green chilis.

This was pretty good! The only change I made was to use 1 tsp of homemade taco seasoning in place of the chili powder and cayenne b/c i used the last of my chili powder to make the taco seasoning. I will make again!

this was excellent! i cant give 5stars since i didnt follow the recipe exactly. i added a bit of parmesan since i didnt have enough of the cheese required, plus i added a handful of corn. the most important ingredient is the salsa, if you have a good salsa then the pie will be brilliant. i will be making this again and again.

This is a great recipe that has become a regular in our household. The only change we make is to use 2% cheddar and, occassionally we add a can of corn. Great flavor, very filling.

This is SO good, but SO very high in fat. I added more salsa (1/2 cup total) as that seems to be the consensus on previous reviews and put 1/2 cup of the cheese on the bottom crust to avoid any sogginess. Then I put another half cup in the middle and the last half cup on top before the top crust. I also added about 3/4 cup frozen corn and it just wouldn't be the same without it. I will save this for special occasions or days when I have otherwise eaten very little fat!

Recipe was easy and delicous.  I brushed egg wash on the crusts (for a brown crust).
The black beans make for a noisy night.

This was awesome!!!  I omitted the bell and red peppers but did keep the cayenne and chili powder at the recipe amount and didn't think it was too hot.  I also added 1/4 cup of frozen corn.  My husband and I almost ate the whole pie in one sitting!

This is a very good idea. I have never thought of bean pie. This turned out very good. Next time I will definitely make this pie with corn. I realized it can be good without cheese too, especially you need the top cheese layer. Thanks for the recipe, it makes an interesting meal.

This was even better than we expected!  I added a layer of tortilla chips with the cheese in the middle and on top.  I used three cans of beans, a can of corn and no pie crust.  Excellent!

Saved calories by only using a crust on top. Used extra sharp cheese, which my boyfriend liked, but I would not use that again if just cooking for myself. Boyfriend gave it 5 stars. Wish the ingredients stuck together like a chicken pot pie. I thought this was very good but agree with one person who saidthis is more like a salsa with a crust. I will defitenly cook this again. It would be great with soup

First time making this. I followed some viewers and did not use a crust but added some brown rice. I was good, but not good enough for a meal. The cheese seemed to be a bit much for this recipe. I do see how it could feed 6.

Did you ever have black bean salsa and think "if this were a pie filling that would be so good"?, me neither. This recipe was bland and flat out weird. I'm really surprised at the positive reviews. I'm not making this again. I can't think of any way to make it good.

I thought this was fantastic!  I just used a bottom crust, and I used a Mexi-mix cheese and about 2/3 cup salsa.  I think next time I might add corn.  Very easy and very tasty!

Fantastic!! I wanted a meatless dish to serve to my card club during Lent and found this one. Tried it out first on my meat-loving husband and almost-vegetarian daughter. Both loved it. I also upped the salsa and served with sour cream. The directions were clear and right on the money. Will definitely serve again.

This is an incredible dish!  I first made it for my sister and me because neither of us are big meat eaters.  She loved it just as much as I did.  One thing I did was add refried beans to the dish.  We love all types of beans, so I spread a little more than half a can of refried beans on the bottom crust before adding the bean mixture.  We thoroughly enjoyed it.  Awesome Recipe!!

I found this recipe very flavorful and filling.  Since it was just me and my boyfriend, it took us three meals to finish it all off, but it keeps  well and reheats well as long as you use the oven NOT the microwave.

My husband was out when I was preparing this, and returned to see me pulling a 'pie' out of the oven.  He anxiously asked me what kind it was and then paled when I said it was Black Bean.  However, his expression changed considerably when he tasted it.  This is a definate keeper.  The flavors are great.  It is like bean enchilladas in a pie crust.  After starting this recipes, I realized that I didn't have any bottled salsa.  I substituted some canned diced tomatoes with green chilies and upped the amount of the other spices a little.  I am anxious to try it with salsa.

THIS IS A VERY GOOD RECIPE YOU CAN DO MANY VARIATIONS WITH THIS RECIPE ALTHOUGH I DID NOT NEED TO.  I DID HOWEVER USE CORNBREAD AS THE CRUST INSTEAD OF PIE CRUST WHICH WAS ALSO VERY GOOD, NEXT TIME I WILL USE PIE CRUST.

Absolutely amazing!  And meatless too!  I ended up making two pies, so I had it for both lunch and dinner for about a week.  I tried to feed it to my boyfriend, but once he found out there was no meat in it, he wouldn't touch it.  It's great with a little bit of sour cream on top.

I followed the recipe except for using 3 large flour tortillas to layer the filling.  Didn't make a pie crust or use pie crust.  I sprayed my pie pan with cooking spray first.  It only took about 20 minutes to heat through in the oven at 325 degrees.  I warmed up the flour tortillas in microwave to soften them, also.  One more addition I made to recipe is a small can of tomato sauce because I wanted it more 'saucy' but I suppose more salsa would have worked just as well.

This was very good after a few changes, based upon other reviewer suggestions.  I added 1/2 lb of ground beef since I'm not a vegetarian, increased salsa to 1 cup, added 1 cup of corn, garlic, only used 1 crust on the bottom and used crushed tortilla chips on the top.  I also increased the cheese to 2 cups.  I will definitely make again, but will decrease the cayenne and add taco seasoning.

This is a great recipe, I loved it, my husband loved it, and I will definitely be making it again. The only changes I made on this recipe were I just dumped all the bean mixture in and topped it with cheese (though that was largely because I didn't read the instructions very thoroughly lol)and I didn't put a crust on the top, just left the cheese naked up there. That cut my cooking time down to about 35-40 minutes instead of a full hour. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!!

This was great, though I did make some major changes.  I used roasted red peppers in place of the other peppers, mainly because I'm not a big fan of the others.  I also used twice the salsa (2/3 c.) and 2 cups of extra-sharp cheddar.  My guests loved it.  I would certainly make this again.

This was a nice, hearty meal.  I took others' suggestions and added corn, garlic, omitted the green pepper and added extra salsa.  If anything, I would increase the chili powder or add a bit of taco seasoning.  I didn't have any sour cream but I think this would be even better topped with it.

This was great!  I used a 10-ounce can of tomatoes with green chiles instead of the salsa.  This added to the volume, so I had to put the crust in a casserole dish instead of a pie plate.  I garnished with black olives, jalapenos and sour cream.  Very filling, like chili in a pie crust.

Tasted like party dip in a pie crust.  I prefer just using a chip over putting it in a pie crust.  The crust just taste bad for you.  I am throwing this recipe away.  It wasn't gross, just not special

My vegetarian husband said if all vegetarian recipes were this good everyone would be vegetarian.  I increased the salsa to one cup as was suggested and I added black olives along with the peppers and onions.  I only made a single crust and when I took it out of the oven I sprinkled it with raw chopped onion while it rested.  Will make again,definitely!

This was a great recipe.  I changed the salsa to 1 cup as others suggested.  I also added a can of corn, mushrooms, diced jalapenos, and some garlic.  I also added 1/2 tsp of cumin.  I really liked this dish and can't wait to make it again.

I was really excited to make this after reading all the reviews, but ended up not liking it.  I did change things around, though, so that might be the reason.  I used refried black beans and 1 cup of salsa (like others suggested) and it ended up tasting too sweet for both me and my husband.  

Perhaps this is obvious to others, but I was confused about what to do with the second crust til I figured  I should flip it over and put it on upside down so it makes a dome.

This was genuinely good.  It was like a veggie comfort food.  Kind of a cross between bean chili and pot pie.  Pretty spicy.  Will make again.

I cook Southwestern for my husband, but even I had seconds of this! Fabulous! Very easy to put together, also.

Oh my gosh these were so good!  My non-vegetarian hubby went on and on about them and asked me to make some so he could bring them in his lunches.
I made little appetizers out of them using ready to bake tart shells, filled them with a bit of sharp cheddar cheese and bean mixture, then covered them with with the pastry topping ( I rolled out some of the tart shells - got 2 toppers from each- and sealed it over the mini pies).  Then I just baked them till they looked brown and mmmmmm! Thanks for the great recipe!
Oh yeah- I also added an extra 1/3 cup of salsa and fresh garlic to the bean mixture to spice it up.

Neither my husband nor I are vegetarians, but we thoroughly enjoyed this dish, and we didn’t even care that there was no meat!  I added a little extra salsa to make the filling more moist, and added a dollop of sour cream on top of each “slice”.  It was delicious!  This is a keeper!

I made this for my husband who is just becomming used to the idea that I do not intend to cook meat at home any more.  I am a vegetarian who would cook meat for him.  He loved this recipe and now requests it every week.  This recipe is great to make ahead of time and put in the fridge to heat up for dinner when you don't feel like cooking.

This is a great recipe, although fairly high in fat.  I have been working on ways to modify the recipe in order to reduce the fat.  Low fat cheese and avoiding the premade pie crusts have helped and the flavor is still retained.  For those who like sweet bell peppers this is a tasty dish.

An excellent recipe which I will definately make again. A bit dry though, when I warmed up the leftovers so next time I will add more salsa to the filling.

This recipe was so easy. I made it with Kelly's "Best Ever Corn Muffins" and it was so good! I think I will add a bit of garlic next time. I felt like there was something missing, but it was also very good as is, very very simple.

Delicious!  Be sure to let the pie sit for 10-15 minutes after removing it from the oven.  It holds together better and the flavors really come out.  The crust was brown and the contents were bubbly after only 45 minutes, so watch closely since ready made pie crusts vary. It's a keeper!

Very tasty, but the leftovers didn't keep well.  Also, I recommend following the directions on the readymade pie crust package instead of these directions - mine took almost 2 hours to brown!  It was easy, though, and I probably will try a variation of it again.

This is great as written, but I felt that it wasn't enough food for my hungry family so I made it 
with additions. I added a chopped zucchini and 3 crushed garlic cloves to the onion.  I added Birds Eye southwestern style corn to the pan (I let it defrost a bit) before I put in the beans.  I added an additional cans of beans.    Of course with all the extra ingredients I used at least a cup of salsa.  I thought about using fresh salsa and decided that jarred is better so that it creates a sauce.   I added a 1/4 teaspoon of cumin.  I didn't layer the cheese.  I'm sure it's delicious, but I'm always trying to cut fat.  I made my own crust and added an ounce of cheese to the crust mixture.  I only used one crust on the top.  There is a lot you can alter in this dish to make different ways.  It will be part of our rotation of dinners.

I made it without dairy products for someone who is lactose-intolerant. It was better on the second day. Flavor was just meh. Not sure if it was because I used canned beans instead of dried beans that had been cooked in the Instant Pot. May be better with those.

Very good!  Pre-baked a store bought pie crust and made it with smoked cheddar cheese and half manchego..added a pickled jalapeno, clove garlic. Let sit 15 min after baking. Sliced avocado on top.. A nice side salad gives you a satisfying crunch.

This was pretty good.  My husband and I liked it better than our kids but overall it was an easy and filling dish.  I did substitute the red pepper with jarred roasted red pepper and added a 1/2 lb. or so of browned ground beef and Hungarian paprika.  Tuesday is Taco night in our house and no meat would be criminal in these parts. I also appreciated the spices in this  vs. a taco seasoning packet.

Great dish but it should be called black bean pie . When my son heard bean pie he said yuk and when my husband heard bean pie , he said what, baloney cake for dessert? They both loved it! Added more salsa ,garlic, and hot peppers and corn. Really spicy and delicious!

I would suggest adding more salsa, maybe a cup.  I added a can of corn too and it went over well.  This was delicious and will become part of my family's more regular meals.  It is easy to make and quite filling too.

This is the best bean pie recipe I have ever made. It was tasty and even pretty. The only changes I made were of convienence. I used 1 whole red bell pepper and 1 tsp of chili powder instead of 3/4 tsp. I used the FRESH SALSA I recipe for the salsa in this. It was a fabulous combination.

This was so tasty.  I was surprised that a friend, who is meat and potatoes eater, raved about how delicious it was.  I must admit that I misread the directions and instead of encasing the filling between the two pie crusts, I layered the bean mixture so the top layer of bean and cheese was exposed, covered with foil for half the suggested baking time and added green chiles as well.  Even though I fudged a little, it still came out a hit.  Thank you!

Excellent recipe.  I changed a little, adding some extra veggies.  I also made it single crust and it turned out beautifully.  Very flavorful, plan on making a double recipe again this week!

I made this pie with a homemade whole wheat flour crust, and used half cheddar/half monterey jack. My kitchen was a mess, but Whoahhhhhh, it was so worth it! Don't change a thing. Served with homemade chips and salsa for a great Latin meal! It reheated well the next day, too!

Amazingly simple, yet delicious! I made with homemade butter pie crust, added a can of olives chopped up, and left out cayenne because of babies eating, and it pleased the whole family.  I will use this recipe over and over again!

It was delicious.  I made my own flaky pie crust.  I did not have any bell peppers, and I used monterey jack cheese instead.  My husband said wow! and it was a keeper.  My daughter asked for seconds. Thanks!

This was delicious. I used only 1 pepper, and used 1/4 cup salsa + 1/4 cup tomatoes. I was worried that the crust on top would burn after cooking for so long, but it was perfect. I might even brush it with an egg yolk next time!

Good and easy to make.  I did not simmer this for 15 minutes because there wasn't near enough liquid to do so.  It still came out great.  I served each slice with a dollop of guacamole and fat free sour cream.

Pretty tasty and very easy to make.  I took others' recommendations and added closer to 1 cup of salsa to the mix and the consistency seemed to be perfect.  I also added a little garlic and used Mexican blend cheese.  I served it with more salsa and sour cream.  I thought it seemed a little bit sweet but perhaps that was just the brand of salsa I used, or maybe the crust.

I went to visit my sister and she asked me to make supper- I told her I was going to make bean pie. She later told me that she was dreading it. The worst thing about this recipe was listening to her praise it for hours! I wouldn't change anything in it!!!

This was pretty good. Since my father is gluten intolerant, we eliminated the crusts and used spanish rice instead. The only problem we had was that the cooking time took too long and the pie almost burned. I will probably make it again, but shorten the amount of time I leave it in the oven.

Not that great! The only part that my mom, my boyfrined and I really cared for was the pre made crust which had nothing to do w/ this repice. The filling wasn't that great even thought I folowwed the directions exact and even added some more flavor once I realized it didn't have much! Aw well! No lose to me.

Tried this recipe because it was something different yet easy to cook for my vegetarian brother visiting from California.  Excellent!!  Using the pie crust was different yet very good.  Make sure to include sour cream and/or guacomole as a topping.

I read the other reviews before I made this pie, and since I was dining with a 6 year old, I reduced the chili powder to 1/2 teaspoon. It was a little spicy, but it was YUMMY! There was also some discussion by other reviewers about the crust. I used Pillsbury pre-made crust and baked it exactly as the recipe indicated and it came out perfectly! This recipe really is delicious. Mmmmmm!

This is really a good recipe.  I had to cook the pie for over an hour at 325 degrees to get a nice brown look.

This is a fabulous recipe.  It is a terrific dish to bring to other people.  It is easy, pretty and tastes delicious.  I have had nothing but rave reviews from the people I have made this for.  I leave out the cayene if making for children.

This was DEEEELICIOUS.  I added a can of green chiles (I like it spicy) too.  I would suggest reheating in the microwave and then throwing it in the toaster oven on light to crisp it up.

I will be making this again... often.

I would have to chime in with the rest of the reviewers.  This pie is a hit with non-beef AND beef eaters. I asked my veg guests to rate it.  They gave it a high 4 forks.  It would have received the 5, but I had to keep it on "warm" while I prepared the rest of the Christmas dinner. (I also made beef bourguignon).  No one is more critical than I.  Their reaction was a very, very YES.
