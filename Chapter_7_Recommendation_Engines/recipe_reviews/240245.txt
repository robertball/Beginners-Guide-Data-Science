You must use real Maple Syrup. It makes a big difference in the recipe. I made this exactly as written and this is the best Cranberry sauce that I have come across in 50 years. You can also freeze this sauce. I used 1 and 2 cup glass pyrex dishes with tight lids. This is now my favorite cranberry sauce and I make big batches around Thanksgiving (when I can get fresh cranberries) freeze it and enjoy it all year. Thaw it out in the refrigerator NOT the microwave!

Very Tasty! I only had an 8 oz. bag of fresh cranberries, so I adjusted recipe and used 3/4 c water, 3/4 cup maple syrup.
I used 2 Tablespoons of Grand Marnier liqueur orange & cognac in place of brandy (because it is what I had on hand).
It turned out great. Good flavor. Not too tart, and not too sweet.

Easy to make, simple, tasty. I didn't use the brandy, but I followed everything else exactly. I ended up adding an extra half a tablespoon of brown sugar, but I don't know if that is always needed. Taste it first to be sure, then add small amounts if it is a little too bitter. I'll use this recipe again.

Love this!  I have to be careful not to eat too much before Thanksgiving.  I left out the lemon and the brown sugar, and decreased to water to 1/2 cup for more intense maple flavor.  I had just made a fresh loaf of sourdough and put this on a slice with butter, so good! Also, be sure to use real maple syrup!

Very good. Followed recipe precisely.  Well, except I added another Tablespoon of brandy. Sweet, tart with just notes of the maple and brandy.

Delicious! My family grows organic cranberries and makes maple syrup every Spring —- I enjoyed that this recipe is not overly sweet — just the right amount of tartness!

This was delicious.  Tart and sweet. I did not add the brandy but I bet that would be very good.

I've tried a number of cranberry sauce recipes over the years, and this has become our favorite. Real maple syrup is not cheap, but I agree it is a must. I leave out the brandy and add a half teaspoon of cinnamon.

This tasted good but i couldn't  taste the difference using the maple syrup verses sugar. So for cost reasons I would just use sugar. Added chopped walnuts.
