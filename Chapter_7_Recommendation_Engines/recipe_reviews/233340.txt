Very nice sauce, used garlic salt rather than regular.  Left out celery and used apple cider vinegar.

Just poured barbecue sauce and seasoning and cooked it 2 hrs on 350 degrees and the meat literally fell off the bone.

Tender delicious ribs.  The sauce tasted just fine, I tasted it before adding anything but my family likes honey flavors so I did add honey.
