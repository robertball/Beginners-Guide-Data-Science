I have made this twice, both times with honey, and without saffron threads.  It's a beautiful looking shake, but it's thick.  It's more like a raw pudding to me, but oh so good.

I made this as directed,  plus added cinnamon and rose water because I like those flavors with  saffron and nuts.  

Very thick and enjoyable.  I feel healthful already!

This "Nutty Avocado" had an interesting texture: a creamy drink with chips of nuts and ice. I made mine with saffron that had already been cut with sugar using a mortar and pestle because that is what I had on hand (and how we use saffron for our cooking at our home). I thought this drink tasted good (probably more of an acquired taste that comes from drinking it regularly); however, what impressed me was how I felt after drinking it ("very satisfied and full of energy"). This drink could very well be the perfect summer breakfast drink. Thank you LilSnoo for sharing your recipe.
