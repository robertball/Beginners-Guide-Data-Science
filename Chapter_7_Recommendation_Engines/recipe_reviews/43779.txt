If there was a way to give this 4.5 stars, I would. It was very tasty and unusual. The only drawback is the mango. It seems I am pretty inept at dealing with mango, so my "diced" mango ends up looking pretty ragged. This didn't effect the taste however. The only change I made was reducing the amount of red pepper in the dish.

The vanilla flavor is a bit overbearing overthe other tastes. After all, this recipe is Mango and Chicken. I would suggest using a plain yogurt.

The flavors blend well in this recipe.  A healthy and tasty alternative to your average salad.

This was so good! I didn't have any mango chutney or paprika, and I forgot to put honey in the dressing but it was still amazing. I also used fat free sour cream instead of the vanilla yogurt, so I'm sure my dressing wasn't nearly as sweet as it should have been but it was still a great compliment to the chicken and mango. I lucked out and used my mango right when it was perfectly ripe - next time I have another ripe mango I'll make this again.

I would go a little heavier on the spices, but great and healthy meal.

Pretty good. I usually make Coronation Chicken from this web site when I get a Mango from our CSA, but I wanted to try something else this time. My mango only made 1 cup once it was chopped. I also only used about a 1/3 cup red bell pepper, which I diced instead of slicing. Tasted tropical and mildly spicy. We enjoyed it.

This is a killer recipe!  I  changed it up a little out of nessity. Subed plain non-fat yogurt with a touch of vanilla and stevia. Also subed kiwi-pinapple jam for chutney. Doubled the spices too. It worked out well. I can see using toppers like pine nuts, toasted coconut, avacado, or bacon crumbles being excellent on this salad. I served  brown and wild rice as a side. Really good.

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I really liked it and even my Mother who is not fond of chicken liked it.  It was a light fairly healthy meal.  I am going to serve it next time with brown rice instead of lettuce for dinner for guest.  I am also going to try this recipe with shrimp instead of chicken.

This was good, easy and suitable for company.  The only change I made was to sprinkle a tiny bit of cayenne pepper on the chicken as I was browning it.  As my husband says....."It's a do-again"

This was a very good salad.  I had plain yoguart, so I just added a little vanilla to it, and put some honey in it.  I Went heavy on the spices, which made it really tasty.  I like the idea another reviwer had of serving it on brown rice.  Also, I think I may try chilling all of the ingredients next time.

Mango & red perrers are so awesome cold in a salad, so I tryed it. I did not care for it. Warm mango just gets mushy. Next time I'll just cook the chicken & garlic & ginger. Leave the rest uncooked, then I'll have a great salad.

I had no yogourt and substituted it with sour cream which ended up fine. I adored the cream and the chicken on the salad, but found my self picking around the mango. It could just be me, but I didn't really dig the hot mangos on my salad. Meh.

Wow, am I ever glad I had mango chutney on hand. I ingredient searched it and this recipe popped up. I wasn't sure how it would be, but am I ever glad I tried it! Fantastic as is! Next time, though, I am going to try adding 1 tbsp extra mango chutney and see how that goes - I am a mango lover. But do try it as it is first, you'd be surprised how wonderful it is and that it needs no changes!

Great start to an excellent recipe. I omitted the red pepper to keep it focused on only a few flavors and I added fresh cilantro! That was the missing ingredient and it tops it off perfect. I added it with the green onion and I didn't heat the mango all the way through. I served on a bed of fresh spinach instead of lettuce. Then it 5 stars to me!

This was a huge hit for a summer dinner.  Only thing I changed was to add some vindaloo spice to the chicken for a bit of heat.
