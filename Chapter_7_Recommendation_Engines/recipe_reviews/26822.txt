SUPERB - This was loved by ALL my guest, even non-seafood eaters.  The clams blended with all the other ingredients made this a nice dip with all sorts of combined flavors. I added american cheese on top the last few minutes of cooking. The recipe was requested by many.

I was looking for a very good clam dip recipe.  This one did not fill the bill.  The taste of the clams never got through the rest of the ingredients.

The dip overshadowed the clams.
