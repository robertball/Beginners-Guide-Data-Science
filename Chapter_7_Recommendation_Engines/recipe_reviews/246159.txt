I had frozen bell pepper strips so I just thawed those and chopped them into smaller pieces.  I used mayo because I had it on hand and yellow onion as well.  The bacon makes it great.

This was something new for me. We loved the crunch of the Cauliflower and sweetness of the sugar. I omitted the red onion because I thought it would be too overpowering.

Turned out really delicious!  The only thing I changed was using stevia instead of sugar.

Really good!!! Perfect for a cookout. I used yellow onion as I didn't have red one. I don't like  Miracle Whip so I substituted it for whipping cream.
