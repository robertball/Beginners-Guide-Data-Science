Delicious!!!
First, I sauteed a peeled, chopped Fuji apple and 1 stalk chopped green onion in 1 TB butter for 10 minutes. Then, I added a 1.4 lb butternut squash and 1/2 a chopped large sweet potato, an inch of chopped, peeled ginger, and 1 and 1/2 cloves chopped garlic and filled the pot up  mostly with water to cover the vegetables (maybe about a 1/2 inch higher than the veggies), and about 1/4 cup of organic chicken stock. I let this simmer for 30 minutes, and then added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon (as per other reviewers' suggestions) and a pinch of nutmeg. Then, I pureed it in the blender. It was so creamy and delicious (and sweet from the Fuji apple) that I didn't need to add cream or yogurt. I seasoned it with salt and pepper. Absolutely divine!

Having the benefit of all those who wrote before me, I made a few tweaks. The end result was DELICIOUS! 1. Chop: 1 peeled and cored apple (I used Granny Smith because it's all I had); 2 celery stalks; 2 peeled carrots; 1/2 medium onion; 3 inches of peeled ginger. Saute all of the above with 1 heaping Tablespoon minced garlic in 2 T butter (or oil) for about 10 minutes, or until soft. Set aside. 2. Put chunked sweet potatoes (or yams) and butternut squash in a large pan with about 2 1/4 c water and  2 1/4 c. chicken broth. (I used 2 cans of the chicken broth, and a little more than that of water--whatever it takes to cover the tops of the vegetables.) 3. Once everything comes to a boil, add the sauteed mixture from before and let simmer until everything is pretty soft. 4. I added 1 t. of cinnamon and about 1/2 t. of nutmeg, 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1 t. of pepper BEFORE blending/pureeing it. It saved me a step, and it came out great.   It doesn't really need yogurt, in my opinion, but I added a dollop of light sour cream before serving, making it a little creamier.

I agree with the other reviews, this is real good but something was missing.  I was trying to do a vegan thing so I left out the yogurt and added curry.  It was great!  I also added a touch on cinnamon but don’t think it is necessary after the curry.  I also froze single servings and they heated up nicely.

Great recipe!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and fried my onion and garlic in a bit of butter in the pot before adding the veggies and broth.  I roasted my squash in the oven at 400 degrees until slightly soft...it made peeling and cubing much easier.  I added 1/4 cup homemade unsweetened applesauce and lots of extra fresh ginger.  I served the soup with a dollop of plain yogurt in the centre of each bowl.  Perfect winter soup!

Love it.  Easy to make.  Used pickled ginger leftover from sushi, instead of fresh.  Added curry powder & red pepper flakes for a bit more intense flavor.

This soup is delicious.  I used vegetable stock instead of water, and I did not add yogurt as suggested in the recipe (just pureed the veges once cooked).  It was fantastic.  My husband also loved it and he doesn't even like sweet potatoes.  I highly recommend this one,very easy to make and very tasty in the chilly weather!

I made a number of modifications, but this was very good.  I had searched for a sweet potato bisque recipe and found this one.  I did not have any butternut squash, so I just used 5 sweet potatoes.  (In retrospect, the flavor would have been far too mild if I had followed the recipe and used squash plus 4 sweet potatoes.)  Based on suggestions of other reviewers, I sautéed the onion, garlic, and ginger first, added a diced apple and some diced celery, and used vegetable broth in addition to water.  Instead of adding yogurt, I blended in some silken tofu.  The resulting soup was pretty good, but following the recommendation of at least one reviewer, I then tried adding some curry -- that really enhanced the flavor.  My husband is a picky soup eater and, although he wasn't thrilled with this before I added the curry, he complimented it TWICE after he ate it with the curry.  Next time I make this recipe, I will use more fresh garlic and ginger (especially ginger).

I loved this. But I like spicy hot soup so I added a seeded and diced jalapeno  to the puree. I would also recommend using chicken broth as some others suggested. Might also try cayenne pepper if you like spicy soup too. A Winter Winner!

I have made this a few times now, and it's by far my favorite soup.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that one day I also added some curry spiced chicken sausage that I got at the local farmers markets, and it was a great addition.

This soup was extremely thin and watery.  Also, when I whisked in the yogurt, it just coagulated.  The flavor wasn't bad but the consistency was unappetizing.

This is a good basic recipe that can easily be tweaked to your individual liking.  I followed the most helpful recipe's advice and sauteed an apple and green onion in butter.  Great idea!  I only used two sweet potatoes (they were quite big), and added the following spices: 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  It's really good.  Garnished with chopped scallions.

I made it vegan, and it was still creamy and delicious. I added some canned pumpkin because I didn't have enough sweet potatoes, and the taste was quality, not overwhelmingly pumpkin-y.  I also started adding some pumpkin pie spices, mostly nutmeg and cardamom, which gave it a distinctive kick with the addition of lots of crushed red pepper.  A potluck winner!

This made MASSIVE amounts of soup. We froze it in single servings and are still enjoying it.   For more flavor use 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 water for extra flavor. I also added an extra zip with a lot of fresh ground pepper and went heavy on the ginger using a 4 inch piece.

This one was not one of the better soups on here. I used a small portion of ginger and even that was too much. I would consider adding powdered ginger in the end bc it was overpowering and I would also add something on the sweeter side. I thought this would have been a sweet soup but guess its supposed to be more on the spicier end with some of the ingredients.

If I had followed this recipe to the T, it would have been extremely bland.    Here's what I did to make it yummier: curry powder, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, 3x the amount of yogurt, 2x amount of ginger.  To make it easier to peel, I cut the squash in half and baked it at 400 with some water in the pan.  I let that cook until I had my sweet potatoes prepped and in the pots.    By the way, this recipe makes A LOT.  I have at least two weeks' worth of lunch.  It took me about an hour and 15 minutes to make it.

Good, but not excellent, very mild flavor.  This is the first bisque I've ever made so it might have been me, I agree to try with chicken broth.

Vastly improved simply by roasting the squash, sweet potatoes and onions (along with a few garlic cloves) in the oven until soft. Then puree with chicken stock (not water)

This recipe was 'ok' but definitely not worth the time it takes to make it. It was lacking in spice so I added some cinnamon.  My boss added some brown sugar to his bowl and it was much more palatable (kind of like sweet potato pie soup!)

I had to change the recipe. I wanted something I didn't have to buy special ingredients for, so I omitted ginger. Not sure that was a great choice because the soup needed a little extra something. I did add chili powder to taste and only 1/3 an onion and that may have been too much and I love them. I used chick stock (no fat, low sodium)and am really happy with that result. I also only added one very large sweet potato. It still made enough to feed 6! I also substituted garlic powder for garlic and I wish I had used the real stuff like the recipe said. But it has several layers of flavor and does have a nice autumn feel.

I followed this recipe rather closely, except I omitted the yogurt for a vegan friend. I also added some ground cloves (about 1/2 tbsp) - delicious! When I make this next time, I'd love to try it with the apple and some stock. Great recipe!

This was a delicious soup! I looked at other similar soups and reviews and altered it slightly. On top of the recipe I added 2 carrots, 2 stalks of celery, and a 1/4 green pepper. I also used chicken stock instead of water, and added milk and a bit of cream at the end instead of sour cream. This turned out fantastic and was hearty and delicious! I will definitely be making it again!

I made this exactly how the recipe wants you too, however I noticed like a handful of others that mine came out more watery then the original photo (perhaps too much water). However, although watery, it was still pretty tasty. I do want to try this again to see if I can get the texture down, and like others said I will add either an apple or applesauce to it. Definitely an easy soup to try if you've never made soup before.

Excellent! I sauteed the celery, carrots, onion, garlic and ginger first. After cooking, I mashed the mixture with a potato masher before using my immersion blender. It was so creamy, I did not use the yogurt. Will make again.

Delicious, thick and silky smooth soup. I used chicken broth instead of water, added one celery stalk, omitted the yogurt, and garnished with fresh cilantro. Wonderful!

Not as good as I hoped.  There is definately something missing spice wise.  I added pepper and salt and also curry.  The curry helped but still something isn't right.  I used water instead of broth and in my opinion using broth would make it a lot more flavorful.   I used two yams instead of 4 sweet potatoes.  Not sure what the difference is between the two flavor-wise but the soup tasted way too much like the yam and not enough the squash.  I doubt I will make this soup again.  I have a wonderful recipe for squash soup and will keep on making that instead.

tast, but a little too thick.  I think thinning it with some chicken broth might taste nice--will try that next time.

This was very good. I didn't use yogurt as it was already creamy, but I did add cinnamon and that made it really good.  Will make again.

I changed the recipe a bit, by baking the squash in a 400C oven for 50 minutes. I also add a pinch of nutmeg for a bit more flavour. Great texture..nice and creamy.

This is the version I made:
1.	Chop: 1 peeled and cored apple 2celery stalks; 2 peeled carrots; 1 medium onion; 1-2 inches of peeled ginger. 
2.	Sauté all of the above with 1 heaping Tablespoon minced garlic in 2 T oil for about 10 minutes, or until soft. Set aside. 
3.	Put chunked sweet potatoes (or yams) and butternut squash in a large pan with about 2 1/4 c water and 2 1/4 c. chicken broth. 
4.	Once everything comes to a boil, add the sautéed mixture from before and let simmer until everything is pretty soft. 
5.	Add 1 t. of cinnamon and about 1/2 t. of nutmeg (or curry/cardamom), 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 t. of pepper BEFORE blending/pureeing it. 
6.	Serve with a dollop of light sour cream

I followed the recipe exactly and i thought it was horrible. I may just not be a fan of the dish, but my fiance hated it too.
