I've made this recipe a few times now and must say that the addition of cinnamon both into the berry mixture and cobbler batter really makes this recipe pop. I add about a 1/2 teaspoon to each, but also increase the amount of berries to 5 cups and orange juice to about 1/2 cup. Also I read many reviews of this recipe being too sweet, but I find that with fruit recipes you really have to taste the fruit before you use it to know how much sugar is needed. I rather like the cakey cobbler this recipe produces as opposed to some with a denser topping. The best compliment this recipe can get from me is that even my very picky hubby requests it regularly. Thanks for a nice basic recipe.

Terrific recipe vaulted into the five-star category by two changes.  I have added 1/2 tsp of lemon zest(grated peel) and a bare sprinkle of cinnamon to the blueberry mixture on the bottom.  Have added a streusel topping (over the existing two layers in the original recipe) consisting of 1/3 c. Bisquick, 1/3 c. packed brown sugar, 2 T. butter and 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  The crunch and nuttiness were missing previously.  Mix all streusel topping ingredients together with a pastry blender or forks and sprinkle evenly over the middle layer, baking for 35-40 minutes as usual.  Vanilla ice cream is a must for most fans.  Oo-o-o, LOOK OUT!  It's TOO GOOD!

This is really good! But I did make some changes, namely: 

1) I used frozen blueberries. 
2) To the berry mix, I added about 2 dashes of ground nutmeg, 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon, and 1.5 tbsp. cornstarch. I also increased the white sugar by 1 tbsp (total of 4 tbsp). The sweetness was just right.
3) I used a rectangular pan, 9.5" x 7". 

I think that the serving size is more like 4 than 6.

This recipe was amazing!  My first cobbler ever, and it was immediately gobbled up!  I made the following changes to it, based off of other reviews.   1) I used 4 cups of blueberries.   2) I used brown sugar instead of white sugar with the blueberries.   3) I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon both to the blueberries and the batter.   4) I added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to the blueberries.   5) I sprinkled the blueberries with a little bit of nutmeg.   6) I made 1.5 amount of batter (using 2 eggs).   7) I didn't have an 8x8 dish, so I used a 9x7.   8)  I added a streusel topping: 5 tablespoons of brown sugar, 2 tablespoons of flour, 2 tablespoons of butter, and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  My cobbler was done cooking in just under 30 minutes.  I served it with Cool Whip, and it was a big hit.  I know it sounds like a lot of changes, but I read a year's worth of reviews, and these were changes suggested by many users.  I will definitely add this to my dessert rotation!

This was not a cobbler recipe for me.  What I call a cobbler has a crusty crust and this cobbler had a cake like topping which was thick and absorbed the filling into it.  The fruit underneath tasted great, but I just did not like the cake like top.

Oh boy!  Was this ever a HUGE hit with my family and guests!  The only modifications I made were:  Instead of 1/3 C pure orange juice, I diluted it down with water, to make 1/3 C liquid.  (I am not a big orange juice fan, so I adjusted it for my liking!)  I used 4 Cups blueberries, because we had an overabundance of them, and didn't want them to go to waste. The blueberries bake down, and didn't overtake the entire cobbler. Finally, I doubled the topping, but found that the center did not cook fully, so next time I might only do it 1.5 times versus doubling the recipe.  We will make this again and again!  It is WONDERFUL!

Oh my gosh...this is an outstanding recipe.  My daughter and I picked blueberries this morning and I made it tonight.  My family devoured it.  My husband happened to accidentally drop his second helping on the floor and I thought he was going to cry.  Vanilla ice cream on top is the way to go.  Thanks for the recipe!!  I will make again and again!

There isn't enough crumb topping in this recipe, but this stuff tastes fan-friggin-tastic regardless!  Recommend adding about 50%, or even doubling the crust portion of the recipe.

Wow!  Delicious!  I didn't have enough blueberries so I added several fresh peaches, peeled and cut into chunks.  I also made a bit more crust, using a full cup of flour and portions of butter and vanilla to match. There are only four members in my family, and the cobbler lasted about 20 minutes.  I'll have to double the recipe next time!

When I prepared this for company this morning I violated my own rule of never serving anything to guests that wasn’t tried and true.  Well I needn’t have worried.  This cobbler was a hit and my guest requested the recipe.  It was perfect in every way. Neither too runny nor too thick, just right sweet, the perfect balance between the topping and the blueberries beneath, and simply exploding with fresh blueberry flavor.  The cake-like topping is buttery rich with an almost crackly, flaky exterior.  The orange juice (I used fresh-squeezed) was not even discernible so if you don’t have orange juice I’d bet this would be just as good with water!  I added no cinnamon.  Unless you feel you need to enhance the already simple and luscious flavor of the blueberries and the buttery topping, leave the recipe as is.  Perfection shouldn’t be messed with.  Last, not only was this impressively and satisfyingly delicious (even without whipped cream or ice cream!),  it is incredibly easy and quick to throw together and get into the oven.  I baked it for 35 minutes and then, to ensure it was baked through, I laid a sheet of aluminum foil over the top to prevent over browning and baked it and additional five minutes.  Excellent recipe with old-fashioned homespun goodness.

Definitely better the next day - tasted too much like orange juice the day I baked it.  Still good.

Update: I liked this so much that I've adapted it to different fresh fruits all summer. It was particularly wonderful with Bing cherries! I used a little less sugar in the fruit and just a little sprinkle of lemon juice. Divine with cream....and for breakfast the next moring!
*************************
This recipe is perfect! Be aware that this is a cobbler, not a crisp or crumble: the topping is a cake-like batter that absorbs the juices as it bakes, kind of like sweet dumplings. Mmmmmm! I will try a little less sugar next time, just for my personal taste, but I didn't find it cloying. The only suggestion I have is if you use frozen blueberries you need to reduce the added liquid. Try 1 tbsp lemon juice or 2 tbsp frozen concentrated orange juice if you have it. Also allow for extra cooking time depending how much the berries have thawed before it goes in!

Amazing!!! The only thing I did different was substitute orange juice for lemon. Not a big orange juice fan, but it came out great. Also, I ran out of blue berries so I added boison berries. Great recipe, thanks for sharing

This was way to sweet for me.  Also I did not care for the cobbler topping.  Sorry, this was just not my idea of the kind of cobbler I like...on the other hand my husband liked it very much!

This was wonderful. I followed the directions left by some other reviewers and increased the first sugar listed to 4 T., added 1/2 t. nutmeg and 1 1/2 T. cornstarch to blueberries. I increased the flour for the cobbler to 1 c., the salt to 1/8 t., the butter to 3/4 c., the sugar to 3/4 c., and the vanilla to 1 t. After the dough was spread on the blueberries, I sprinkled the top with additional nutmeg and some Turbinado sugar. I wouldn't change anything to this recipe now, and plan to use it often! Thanks!

This was delicious! I made some slight modifications for personal preference: 1) I used frozen raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries; 2) Made 1 + 1/2 of the batter (by increasing the portion size to 9 from 6 and using 2 eggs); 3) Added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to both the berries and batter; and 4) Left out the orange juice. Served warm with ice cream and the family devoured it. Thanks for the recipe and for all the additional tips from other reviewers!

This was a hit at my home!  I made it exactly as specified.  The topping had a fantastic cake consistancy, which is what I expect from a cobbler.  

I did agree with some other reviews that there was a little less topping than I would have liked.  I might increase the topping ingredients a little next time but I would not double it as the would be far too much...

Thanks for the great recipie

The first time I made this, I eat with my own homemade ice-cream. It feels like I'm floating in the air.. Great balance between sweet and sour of the blueberry (maybe my blueberry is not sweet enough). In Malaysia, blueberry,strawberry, and raspberry is quite difficult to find, and expensive.
Second time I made this, I used peach instead. Turns out OK, but I still prefer the blueberry.

This isn't the bestever, but it is easy.  'Could've used more sugar in the berry part - & my berries were already sweet so that's a biggie to note if you're considering making this.  I liked the topping.  It's thin like the photo shows; just a little crisp, but not crunchy.  It isn't biscuit or pie crust like at all.  'Can't think of a comparison.  I'd almost forgotten there was oj in it.  'Couldn't tell by taste - at least with my oj.  The berry part was surprisingly thickend, not runny.  'Not all that pretty either, but you won't get quick & pretty together too often.  :)  'May try the topping with something else.

I made 50% more topping because that's always my favorite parts of cobblers.  It tasted pretty good, but because of the cake-like topping it wasn't like cobblers I normally eat.  On the other hand, my boyfriend loved that the topping absorbed the juices.  I may make it again for him, but I'll still keep my eye open for a better cobbler recipe.

This is a fantastic cobbler recipe.  The only things I changed were to add about 1/4 tsp lemon extract to the dough, then sprinkled raw sugar over the top to make a nice, browned up crust.  Easy, and I'll be using it for other types of fruit as well!

this recipe makes the purfect cobbler crust.  I used a homemade canned blueberry filling and added the crust from this recipe.  It was the perfect addition.  The only change I made in the recipe was that I changed the vanilla to 1 tsp. Our family will be eating this many more times.

This is the best recipe I've ever tried !!  Most use too much sugar,
but this is just right.

Great. Added 1 tsp of vanilla but other than that change it was wonderful.

I was worried when I watched the cobbler bake because it looked so different from any cobbler I have ever made.  The ingredient ratios for baked goods are ususual, however, it turned out beautifully! My husband and guests really loved this cobbler, especially the crunchy topping.  I have never had guests ask for a second helping after eating a big meal before.  Next time I will increase the amount of topping, as suggested by other reviewers. And definitely serve it ala mode!!

This was a great recipe.  I doubled everything, and added a cup of blueberry pie filling I had in the freezer and didn't know what to do with..and baked this in a 9 x 13 pan.  I also melted my shortening for the topping and it was much easier to spread out.

I can't rate your recipe because this is my first time making a cobbler. Your recipe was very easy to make and quick as well. The only problem I had was I had to add more liquid, but I chose to use less butter. I substituted blackberries for the blueberries because we are growing them. It still turned out great!

OMG! This was delicious and soooo easy to make.  I baked it in a 2 qt french white casserole dish and it was perfect.  Topped with a little vanilla frozen yogurt or ice cream or whipped cream - awesome dessert. (and yummy breakfast the next morning minus the ice cream, of course)

I've seen some reviews complain about the cakey top, but that is the best part of this recipe!  It's so sweet and moist and delicious, but my only complaint is that there wasn't enough of it to fully cover the fruit.  The second time I made this, I doubled the cake topping and it was perfect.  I also used just a few splashes of lemon juice instead of the orange juice.  Since I was using frozen berries, they created enough of their own juice that the extra liquid wasn't needed.  This is fantastic with a pack of mixed frozen berries.

I just took this out of the oven for a pitch-in in 2 hours and what a disaster!  There is no cobbler, just floating "discs" that look like it should be a cake, but it sure isn't. I felt there was too much butter in the topping but followed the recipe since everyone raved. Now I'm deciding if I should put Bisquick biscuits on top and rebake - anyone suggest what went wrong?

I have got to say, this is the best thing I have eaten in a long time!  I had to write this as soon as I ate it too! I only made two changes to the recipe, I added a sprinkling of cinnamon to both the blueberry mixture and the batter, and I doubled the amount of sugar in the blueberry mixture ( 6 Tbs. instead of 3 ). I thought this had the perfect amount of sweetness, but I like very rich things. I thought the "crust" had more of a crispy cookie kind of flavor and texture, rather than a cake like consistency. But, I thought that is part of what made it so great! You could also really taste the sweetness of the orange juice, but couldn't really Identify it apart from the rest of the dish, it complements the blueberries very nicely.  Seriously, it's like heaven in your mouth! I will be making this many many more times. My boyfriend will be lucky if he even gets to eat any!  : )

This recipe is sensational!  I took the recommendations from some of the other readers and added some cinnamon to the batter as well as the topping. I will be making this time and time again.  I will add, though, that it is not enough topping!  I will double it next time for sure.  It was so yummy.  I served it warmed up with vanilla ice cream.

I've had an obsession w/ blueberries this summer and this was the first cobble I've made.  Quite easy to make, and good, but not as sweet as I'd like; I'll just add a bit more sugar next time.  There was no problem with it getting eaten up though!

I used frozen blueberries and added an extra cup because they shrink so much when they cook. Turned out perfectly. So good.

I am not sure if it is the organe juice or what, but we are not a fan of this.  Nobody liked it and everyone in my family are big dessert eaters.  My youngest who eats anything refused to eat more than two bites of this.

This was great.  I made one change and used lemonade instead of orange juice because lemons seemed to go with blueberries better than oranges.

The filling was a bit on the runny side as I ate this right out of the oven... but after awhile it soaked up into the topping, which tastes to me just like a sugar cookie. The perfect cobbler...all around delicious, and I'll be keeping this recipe on file. Thanks!

When finished mixing the topping, I could tell from the consistency which was more like a cookie, that this wasn't going to crumble or cobbler. I did use less sugar and OJ to coat the berries, and did add 2 teaspoons of cornstarch as I garnered from other reviews that it was too watery. I kept the topping the same- but using light brown sugar instead. The form is funky but the content is delicious.

What I got was a runny mess w/o thickener for the berries (and didn't add OJ) with a thin crispy crust on top that did not appeal to me at all. I like a more substantial top, way too much butter for what I ended up with. Top was crispy not crunchy. I'm sorry, but not for me.

EXCELLENT...!(I sing this in a high pitched voice every time I make and eat this, I swear!)I'm a diabetic so I bake with Splenda brand called "Splenda Sugar", heavy like sugar. To the batter I add: 1 1/2 tsp Cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, and 1/3 cup of Splenda brand of Brown sugar called "Splenda Brown Sugar Blend" and it's dark brown sugar. And to the fruit, I add 1/3 cup Splenda Sugar Blend and 2 or 3 tbl spoons of cornstarch, I toss berries with this and then add juice. I then use a slotted spoon and move berries to prepared baking dish. Spoon dollops of batter on top, evenly spread out over berries and then pour juice mixture. And follow baking directions, cobbler bakes up golden brown, berry filling is thick, never runny. I can never wait when it's out of the oven. I dish it up and top it off with frozen whip cream (Cool Whip, no substitutions!) and it melts and tastes just like ice cream--DE-LISH! You absolutely HAVE to try this recipe!

I made this because I had tons of blueberries as the result of a morning spent picking blueberries. Although my husband loved the recipe, I thought the orange juice was a bit overpowering. Next time I'll use 1/2 orange juice and 1/2 another type of juice - maybe grape juice.

Very very tasty. Simple to put together. Luckily from the other reviews I was warned for the cakey type topping, to me, a cobbler has the crumb crust top. But nevertheless, still delicious! Will certainly be making again.  Like other reviewers I too added a pinch of cinnamon to the blueberries and then a light grating of nutmeg into the flour.  Adds just a tiny hint of the spices without taking away from the blueberries.  Everything else was exact, perfect with the orange juice. I did not find it overly sweet, which I appreciated. Will be trying this with other fruits as well! Well done Jen!

This was really easy and over-the-top GOOD. OMG. I used frozen blueberries and blackberries, and didn't measure, so probably used too much, but I'm Italian, and "more is more". It's the law. "Abondanza". Also added the cinnamon per the suggestion and basically followed the recipe, with just a little sugar sprinkled over the batter to crystallize. I'd like to try the turbinado sugar for that next time. I made pot roast for a boyfriend, and made this for dessert, topped it warm with vanilla bean ice cream AND whipped cream, and he said it was the best meal he'd ever had. Mm mm mm! I took pictures of him eating it, because his eyes were closed. LOL. Make this, People!

The first time i made this is was delicious, however, it was  a little watery from the orange juice. Also, i found that I didnt really have enough batter to cover the top. That didnt stop my boyfriend from devouring it and bragging to his mother about how delicious my cobbler came out.  The next time i made it, I used a little more blueberries and let it sit in the oj and sugar in the fridge for about an hour and doubled the batter.  I had the same problem another reviewer had that the middle didnt quite cook through, but it was even better than first time i made it!  The next time Ill do 1.5 batter and it should be perfection!

I think the cobbler is great but I made a tweak. I put my family's cinnamon crumble on top. I have to say, I love it!

Really tasty recipe.  The topping is essentially a sugar cookie recipe, so you obviously can't go wrong with that!  I took another reviewer's advice and made a streusel topping on top of the dough recipe, but I don't believe it enhances the original recipe.  Very good as is!

This would get 5 stars if it were yellow cake over blueberries, but it's not a cobbler.  The berries came out wonderfully.  I didn't enjoy the cake topping.  I'm sure it would make a good cake.

The topping, while it had a very distinctive buttery taste, was just to light in texture and very insubstantial. The night I made it, we had out of town company, and while everyone said they liked the taste, every one (ranging from ages 4 to 62) felt like they had eaten air. The blueberries were phenomenal and we all (7 of us) particularly liked the addition of the orange juice, a nice change from other recipes I've made which called for lemon juice. I will save that info and look for a different topping.

My first cobbler ever was a huge hit with this recipe.  I used 4C blueberries and added 1/2t cinnamon to both the crust and filling mixtures.  Baked up perfectly and gave a my family a whole new respect for blueberries.

This had an overall too-sweet flavor.  I feel like it would have been better if the recipe had lemon juice or lemon zest in it to counterbalance all of the sweetness.  I'm sure there are better blueberry cobbler recipes out there.

This Cobbler is the BEST EVER! I only had 2 cups of fresh bluberries so I added 1 Cup of frozen and it turned out perfect, just the right sweetness and the cookie like crust is to die for! My husband loved it! I will be making this one again!!

I made this tonight exactly as the recipe states and it's really quite yummy! It's the first time I've made a cobbler of any kind and it turned out great. Oh... woops... I didn't make it quite as stated. I put one LESS tablespoon of sugar on the berries. That's the only change I made. 
It wasn't too sweet or too bland. I think I'll try using fresh juice next time and a little of the zest tho.. just to give a little more tang to it. That's my personal preference tho. This was as close to a perfect cobbler I've had yet.

This is a ten star recipe!  I will never make another cobbler recipe again.  I doubled the recipe and used 3c peaches and 3c blueberries.  I ran out of eggs (gasp!) so I only used one.  I topped it with turbinado sugar after it finished cooking.  It made it sparkle and gave it a little crunch.  I'm in love!

After reading reviews, I added more sugar to the blueberries as well as a liberal dash of cinnamon.   I liked it so well that I made it again the next week, and doubled the cobbler part. Still very tasty, but I probably should've let it bake longer. It was a bit gooey in the middle in spots. But that's not a problem for me.

This was wonderful and very easy.  I also doubled the top crumble part like others had suggested.  I am glad I did.  I do not think a single batch would be anywhere near enough.  Excellent.  Thank you for this one.

Very good. Added a little milk to the batter, and sprinkled some sugar on top before baking, for a crunchier crust. Just know that this is not a thick crust, though. Delicious with vanilla ice cream.

YUMMY! I love a cakey cobbler. So much so, I think I'll double the batter next time. The only change I made was the addition of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. to the batter and also to the berries. I can't wait to try it with peaches!

This is the best blueberry recipe out there. I did as others suggested and added cinnamon but left out nutmeg. My company absolutely loved it. 6 people inhaled this dessert and my uncle ate the last of it out of the pan. The crust was cake-like but crispy which I loved. I will not make any other blueberry dessert. It was incredible! Thank you for a great recipe!

Made this for my boyfriend's birthday. He LOVES blueberries. I've never made cobbler before and was very nervous. I chose this recipe because it had simple ingredients and high reviews. The ONLY thing I changed was, I added 2 teaspoons of cornstarch in the berry/sugar/juice mixture. The consistency turned out perfect. Without it, it would have been runny. His family was impressed. I made lots of points that night. They've asked  me to bring this dish for Thanksgiving! THANK YOU!

I just made this for our dinner guests and we all loved it!  It was great with vanilla ice cream.  I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of the white flour.  I didn't want a thick topping, so the amount was perfect for me.  The only thing I will change next time is to add less sugar to the topping since the berries were so naturally sweet this time of year.

Anyone who gave this recipe a bad review is NUTS!!! I have to admit, I questioned the orange juice at first, but after trying it.. I was amazed. It was excellent! It was also easy to make, I think I whipped it up in 15 minutes. Rave reviews, even from my mother.. who is my harshest critic! Tasted just like blueberry cobbler from a top notch restaurant. Will make again!

Even though my blueberries were not so sweet to start off, the OJ & sugar really helped! I left the cobbler on the counter overnight (uncovered) & the crust was still a little crispy the next day. Next time I will double the filling.

First time I've ever made blueberry cobbler.  Very easy to make, but I expected more and maybe a little sweeter. I will add a bit more sugar next time.  My husband LOVED it though.  I'll definitely make it again.

I read the reviews about their not being enough of the flour/butter mixture so I doubled that part - except I did not double the butter - we couldn't bring ourselves to use 2 sticks.  It cooked just fine but personally I felt the topping was bland and the berry mixture too sweet.  My husband loved the dessert though.

The pastry was sweet and delicious and my kids loved it before it was even baked (my kids licked the bowl).  I used canned blueberries and found the dish too sweet.  I would make this again using peaches instead.

This was excellent!!!!!!  It was the best cobbler I have ever had.  Unlike most coblers the topping wasn't so doughy, which I liked.

I made this with fresh blueberries and freshly squeezed orange juice. Delicious!!! We loved the rich biscuit topping but next time I'll double it as there wasn't quite enough for the amount of fruit.

I made this cobbler for a party and was a bit concerned since I hadn't tested the recipe before.  It was so easy and wonderful! My guests loved it. I used frozen blueberries instead of fresh and it turned out great.

This is delicious dessert and guests always seem to enjoy it.  The topping is so moist with the perfect amount of sweetness.  The only change I make is that I use apple juice instead of orange juice and add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the blueberries.  I think the apple juice and cinnamon are more complimentary than the orange.  Just my own preference.  Overall a wonderful (and easy) recipe you'll make again and again!

Delicious! I followed the main body of the recipe, along with suggestions of others.  Added thickening for blueberries, lemon juice and water instead of OJ, sugar to taste,extra blueberries, cinnamon sprinkle on berries and in cobbler mix.

Delicious. I had exactly 3 cups of berries from my own bushes and wanted something simple but special. I added two little things... the zest from the orange and a sprinkle of turbinado (sugar in the raw) over the top of the cobbler before cooking. 40 minutes was perfect and it was the best blueberry cobbler I've ever had. Served with vanilla ice cream and I treated myself to two helpings.

I liked the recipe! I just felt it was too sweet with the pastry.
I followed some of the reviews and doubled the pastry and added other fruits because I was a little bit out of blueberries! It was reaaaally nice! 
Next time I will lower down the quantity of sugar and that´s it!

I made the recipe as exactly as stated. While the cake on top was good, there was just not enough of it. If you have your heart set on making this recipe, I suggest doubling the ingredients for the cake top. I guess I just prefer a streusel or oatmeal topping. To me this just wasn't "the best ever".

To make this vegan (aka awesome), I used applesauce instead of the egg and it came out perfect! There is plenty of room for adjustments to your liking too... lemon zest, cinnamon, etc. I'll definitely use this recipe again.

Great recipe! The bake time was spot on and the topping was great. I received a lot of compliments, but it wasn't perfect. I would recommend cutting the liquid by at least 1/4, reducing the sugar in the fruit filling by at least half if the fruit is ripe, and adding cinnamon to the fruit or maybe fruit and topping. I'll make these changes next time.

I made a few changes for a healthier cobbler. Cut the amount of butter and sugar IN HALF and did not use the egg. Added cinnamon to the blueberries. Used a tiny bit of fresh lime juice in place of the orange juice. It was tasty.

Delicious! I used 2 tablespoons of lemon juice instead of the orange because I was out. Other than that I left it as written. It was mouthwateringly divine! I've never made cobbler before, so I have nothing to compare it to whether it was "cakier" or "crisper" as others have complained about. I normally eat chocolate desserts, so this was a nice change of pace, and I am SO GLAD I made it! The whole pan disappeared. I served it with fresh vanilla ice cream and it could not have been better!!

This is scrumptious!! Simple and easy to do. I used what I had on hand: 1 pint of blueberries, brown sugar, and orange/pineapple juice for the bottom. The cake part I did the same as recipe. I have to say, the cake part was so yummy. Thanks : )

This was great!  I used lemon juice since I didn't have any o.j.  I followed previous suggestions and added 5 1/2-6 tbsp sugar to the fruit and cinnamon to both berries (blues and straws together) and also to the batter.  Once I spooned the batter on top, I sprinkled with sugar.  I think this was the best cobbler I've made yet!

It's okay, not the "best ever," but maybe that's just my preference for a more sweet-biscuity topping rather than the cake-like result this recipe yields.  I did add a layer of a pecan/cinnamon crumble on top of the berries, as suggested, and I think that helped.  My family really loved this.  Again, it's just not for me.

It's best with a mix of fresh berries, and some chocolate chips. 
It's a really good recipe, though the crust could be a littler sweeter and softer

Yum!  I doubled the recipe (except for the orange juice--I used 1/3 cup OJ and 1/3 cup water) and baked in a 9 x 13 pan.  I also threw in a couple dozen halved strawberries for added color and texture.  Thanks Jen--I will definitely make this recipe again!

This is one sensational dessert. Perhaps it was the wild blueberries I spent 3 hours picking. I am only giving this 4 stars because I deviated from the recipe. The wild berries are extremely sweet so I eliminated the orange juice. I only had 2 c. of berries so I added about a half pint of strawberries. Before adding sugar, I tasted the fruit. I only added 2 heaping spoonfuls of sugar and about 1/2 t. cinnamon. For the crust, I reduced the sugar to 1/3 c. to adjust to the sweetness of the berries. I also added 1/4 t. ground ginger to the flour mixture, but really could not taste it. Need to add more next time. It was done in 35 minutes, but the first 30 I had the oven at 325. Bumped it up and it browned in a few minutes. This was great warm with nothing extra with it. The crust is very delicate and like a tender shortcake. It was just sweet enough and very light. I cannot wait to make this again. I had it for breakfast this morning cold with some greek yogurt. Wonderful. You will not be disappointed. Thanks Jan.

This was really good and pretty easy to make too.  I had a bunch of blueberries and had company coming over for a BBQ and threw it together and it turned out great.  Thanks

I followed Peanutty's recommendations and it was almost perfect. Next time I would keep the orange juice at 1/3 cup. Raising it to half was too much. It was a little bit too sludgy. Other than that though, the crust and flavor overall was divine. Easy to make too.

Made this doubled this recipe and used a 9 x 13 pan and it was very good. The crust is cakey rather than like pie crust but still tasty. If I make it again I will add the cinnamon that another reviewer recommended.

OK, part of this is my fault...I don't care for this type of "crust".  It is very thick and had a weird aftertaste to me.  But the berry mixture was great...I used 4 cups of blueberries as others suggested, and it was fantastic.  But the crust...I didn't care for it.

This wasn't the worst but definitely not the best. If you want a blueberry cobbler to taste close to being healthy than than this may be the one for you. I like mine to taste like a Grandma in the deep south made it.

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  The topping is like a sugar cookie.  Perfect combination of fruit, topping, sweetness and "liquid".  It was EXCELLENT, easy and just delicious!  I can't wait for summer and all the fruit that'll be in season!!

I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers. I added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch, a small amount of nutmeg, and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the blueberries. Also added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the flour mixture. We all loved it!

This is an easy light dessert. I've made it a couple of times and it was well-liked by all both times. I didn't make any changes. Nutmeg or cinnamon might be nice mixed in with the blueberries, but it's not necessary. The first time, I made it with fresh blueberries, the second time with frozen wild blueberries. It was equally good both ways.

What a wonderful recipe! Buttery cake-like topping atop tangy blueberries... YUMMY! I followed everything to a 'T', except for making 1.5 times the topping as suggested (great idea for those who want a nice, thick topping). I would suggest decreasing the orange juice just a tad (perhaps a little too tangy) This recipe sure lives up to its title!

This is a great recipe for the novice cook.  There isn't alot of room to mess it up and it tastes wonderful.  I tend to like my Cobbler a little sweeter, so if I were to add anything, it would be more sugar.  You could also sprinkle sugar on it after it is cooked.  I added Vanilla Ice Cream to it while it was still warm....best way to enjoy it!!!  Great Recipe!

Just made this for a nice Sunday breakfast. I LOVE the way this comes out. I had to sub cranberry juice, but I think it works and being similar to the blueberries it might fix that 'orangey' thing people were talking about. I let it cook for the full 40 minutes, it will firm up if you let it cook long enough. I liked the crust. I've had cobbler with the crisp, flakey, flour-and-butter flavored crust and honestly I like this better, almost muffin-y. Will DEFINITELY make again.

I love cobblers and I really enjoyed this recipe. I used frozen blueberries and did not find that the berries were too runny. Next time around, I'm thinking of doubling the batter. As is, it's still a great recipe that I would recommend to anyone!

This really is the "Best Ever"! The bluberries have a nice orange-y flavor and the topping is wonderful. I only had frozen berries that I tossed with the sugar and the the orange juice. The flavor was excellent, but it was too juicy. Next time if using frozen berries I will add 1-2 tablespoons cornstarch to the sugar. I also added 1 teaspoon cinnamon to the topping.  Wonderful recipe. Thanks, Jen!

Loved it! Different than most cobblers I've tried, but tasted great, and the orange juice is the perfect touch!

Easy and excellent. I have made this twice now. This time I replaced 1 T of the sugar that goes into the berries with 1 T brown sugar. No noticeable taste difference. Still delicious. Picture is very accurate. Note: Needed about 4 mins. less cooking time in my oven.

The filling part was great and so easy to make.  However, the topping was just ok. I too expected to have more of a "struddle" crust so I actually remade the crust because it was so creamy.  My guest did like it, so although I was a bit disappointed it was not such a big deal.

I was looking for a cobbler that didnt require milk and decided to try this one. It was very good! I used sweetened blackberries for my fruit and served with vanilla bean ice cream. It was also great the next day cold. We really liked the soft, cakelike consistency of the cobbler.

This was fabulous.  I used the stresusel topping as well, just because it was a little lower in fat.  I also used Splenda in the filling, so it turned into a fairly light dessert.  The blueberry filling is fabulous...the orange juice tastes great.  I'll definitely use this recipe again!

This is absolutely wonderful! I pick fresh blueberries every year and of all the recipes I've tried, I think this is my favorite, and my husband agrees.

The orange juice is a great touch. It adds a little subtle citrus flavor without overwhelming it at all, and I found the sweetness to be just right. Like some of the other reviewers, I added a little cinnamon to the topping. Unlike a few of them, I had no trouble with the dough being uncooked. I will definitely make this recipe over and over again.

This recipie was very tasty & very easy.  Came out just perfect.  If you tend to like sweet cobblers though you may want to add a bit more sugar.  I found this one just right for my taste.  A keeper for sure.

This isn't really what I think of when I think "cobbler"; the cobbler was more like cake.  I prefer the crunchy crusty cobbler, but this was still very good- especially since I had all the ingredients already and was trying to use up my blueberries.

The crust was very tasty but was messy trying to 
drop on the filling evenly.  Also the filling was not sweet enough and tasted funny with the orange juice.  My family didn't care for the taste.  Sorry Jen.

I made this blueberry cobbler in the morning and by night it was GONE. One thing I'd do differently is add more of the flour/butter etc. mixture on top. My husband and daughter were fighting over the pieces with more topping from the pan. Thanks for the recipe Jen!

I would not describe this as cobbler...the topping was not a crust topping like you think of with cobbler.  My husband described it best when he said it tasted like blueberry pancakes.  The topping had the same consistency as that of a pancake and not a crust like topping.  The blueberry mix tasted good, but definitely a disappointment when expecting and wanting a blueberry cobbler.

Absolutely loved this and so did my husband and three kids!  I almost made more of the topping based on some of the other reviews but am so glad I didn't. I thought it was the perfect topping/ fruit ratio. I couldn't taste the orange juice but I'm sure it adds additional sweetness to balance out the tartness in the blueberries. Made the recipe exactly as is and wouldn't change anything.

Too sweet.  Too much sugar.  The cake batter didn't  raise it cooked downwards  into the blueberries which made the cake  soggy.  I think this recipe could do with less of  the orange juice and a lot less sugar.

Made this for my boyfriend & he still hasn't stopped talking about how good it was! Told the guys at work about it, even shared some with his dad... it's a winner! I did read other reviews and did modify original recipe by: 1) using brown sugar on the blueberries instead of white 2) adding 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon to both blueberries & batter.  Absolutely delicious!

Loved it. I made a few changes, actually a lot. I added at about a handful of cinnamon. Then added cake mix to the places that our mixture didn't cover. We also did not use orange juice, but we did use 3 freshly squeezed orange wedges leftover from dinner. But still, it was a superrrrrrr success!!! We just hoped that we don't poison the person that will eat this cobbler next. Yes, we never tasted it because it is still in the oven. Oops. Thank you for reading this comment that is so amazing and will help your life of baking with awesomeness. The end.

Too sweet for my tastes and I like sweets.  I think the topping was the culprit.  It's still a good recipe and I will just adjust the sugar to my taste.

My big mistake was using frozen blueberries.  The texture of the berries was gross.  And the orange juice flavor comes through too strongly.  But, more than that, the topping was not at all what I envision cobbler to be.  It was like a very dry cake which soaked up nearly all of the liquid/moisture in the dish.

This is a WONDERFUL and easy blueberry cobbler recipe with no changes.  It is not too sweet and just the right amount of cake.  I will make this again very soon.  Next time I may try adding a little cinnamon, but it is fabulous as is.  Another great Allrecipes delight!  Peggy in Middleburg, VA

Wonderful recipe. I included the cinnamon and used turbinado sugar in the blueberries. My 18 year-old son said this was the best thing he had ever tasted.

Excellent! Loved the cake like topping. So easy to prepare and tastes so delicious, especially warm topped with whipped cream or ice cream.

I made this cobbler yesterday. It was my first cobbler, and I am pleased with how it came out. I added about 1/2 a cup more blueberries than called for because I wanted to use them all. I also added a few dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg to the berry mixture as other reviewers suggested. The cobbler was delicious, and my  family went back for seconds (and thirds!).
I baked the cobbler for 40 minutes, but when we ate it the middle of the crust seemed a little underdone, so I will cook it for 42 minutes or so next time I make this recipe.

I used fresh organic blueberries and it was unbelievably good. Even though I had to add 4T of sugar, it was not too sweet. I added some cinnamon in the flour mix and to the  berries and it was a subtle abd welcome addition. The cobbler did not last long.

I'm not really a dessert person, but hubby likes to eat cobblers and pies and.... so, I thought I'd try this. Between me, hubby and my 12 year old son, the whole thing was gone in 5 minutes. Followed it to the T + the cinnamon. Excellent recipe! Not too sweet which is how I like my dessert.

Great recipe!!! Quick & Easy dessert to put together when fresh blueberries are abundant. Giving 4 stars as needed very small adjustments for me. Took advice from reviews for extra topping. Doubled everything in the topping EXCEPT Sugar - 1/2 C is plenty....I like the natural sweetness from blueberries. I also ADD 1/8 tsp. CINNAMON to the Blueberries & Flour mixtures. I agree it enhances flavors. I baked 40 minutes. Really nice dessert.

I switched out the butter for a ripe banana, the white sugar for Turbinado, (reduced to 1/3 cup because it's much sweeter) and added a touch of cinnamon to both the berries and the flower mixture. Much healthier and every bit as yummy.

I followed this recipe exactly. It was so wonderful. All of my extended family loved it. We all wished, however that there was more crust. We all agreed that I'd double or triple the crust next time. There just wasn't nearly enough.

Easy and delicious!!  A huge hit with my family!  The first time I made it, I misread the ingredients and used 1/2 a stick of butter instead of 1/2 a cup.  It tasted delicious, but the batter was thicker and more difficult to spread.

I rarely tinker with recipes, but did make one change; I added 1/2 tsp of orange peel to the blueberries and 1/2 tsp orange peel to the batter (going for the blueberry citrus flavor).  It was yummy!  Next time I plan to substitute orange or lemon flavor for the vanilla.

I made the recipe as instructed except for using coconut oil in place of butter.  The topping isn't a crumb topping like apple crips (oats, oil and brown sugar).  This topping is fat, sugar, egg and flour so it's more like a sugar cookie, and yummy.  Some folks comment about not having enough topping, so I debatted making extra topping but decided against it.  Using a 1-tbs icecream scoop to drop the topping onto the blueberries,  resulted in much more coverage than others said. I used a rubber spatula to spread the topping flat to fully cover the berries, and there was the perfect amount.  We ate some warm cobbler last evening, and it was yummy.  But, the magic really happens after it's chilled overnight.  The berries set, and the cobbler becomes firm and cake-like.

Mine just came out of the oven, but my taste buds give 2 thumbs up already! Next time I will use more crust. I added 2 oz. of cream cheese to the topping and that made it beyond!! Will do again!

I increase the amount of topping, as I find that the recipe does not provide enough. And I use margarine instead of butter. The Mrs loves it. Sorted.

Excellent cobbler! I doubled recipe to fit a 9x13 pan. I used brown sugar in the berry mixture, white sugar in the crust mixture. I don't think I used quite 6 cups of berries...just was using up the rest of a 2lb pkg of blueberries; I think it was 3/4 full, so whatever that works out to. Also used a tbs of vanilla instead of a tsp. And I added a few shakes of cinnamon & nutmeg to the berries, and sprinkled a thin layer of cinnamon sugar over the top of the crust. I had enough crust mixture to cover the berries; I dropped by tsp's vs tbs's. I expected to bake a bit longer but mine took 33 minutes; I don't know if that was because I had a glass pan. The topping was different from other cobblers I've had; it was a smoother texture but it was light and crispy. The berries were perfect; just lightly sweet. Thanks for a keeper! Btw - my pan was gone within a couple hours!

Oh my goodness, this is so good! I am a southern girl and have had every kind of cobbler imaginable. This is one of the best that I've ever tasted! I scaled down the recipe to a small corning dish (approx 3 servings). I'm grateful I did or I'd have went crazy and ate way too much. This is a fantastic recipe and I will be using it a lot this fall! I had to sub the O.J. for Trader Joe's blood orange italian soda (I didn't want to go to the store just for O.J.) I also put just a smidgeon of nutmeg in the crust (and I mean just a smidgeon.) Other than that followed this exactly. It came out perfection. Thank you for the great recipe!

I only made the topping and used canned filling that I jazzed up. Very similar to a sugar cookie. Great taste, if you're looking for something easy and non traditional this is it!

Great cobbler. I've tried several recipes to get the consistency of the crust just right, and this is a winner. I think I'll modify this recipe for other fruit cobblers.

I made this recipe for Father's Day as my father loves anything with blueberries and it was a huge hit! In fact, everyone in my family loved it even though the rest of us don't usually care for blueberry desserts. I used about 4.5 cups of blueberries, 1/2 cup of orange juice and only about a teaspoon of sugar. I added some cinnamon to both the blueberry mixture and the batter and was really happy that I did. Will definitely make again!!

Wanted a quick blueberry cobbler, turned out great. only change was I didnt have orange juice so I substituted lime juice about a 1/4 cup mixed with water to make 1/3 cup. My daughter and I loved it. Not too sweet.

Delicious pastry and blueberries! I only wish I had vanilla ice cream on-hand. So I'll have to make it again! I love blueberries and had fun making this recipe. I love to make pastry from scratch. I actually had only a small portion of blueberries on hand, so I reduced the recipe accordingly and it was delightful! You definitely must-try this one! Thanks, Jen, for sharing a recipe that I'll use again.

This is probably totally my fault, but I substituted blackberries instead of blueberries. My whole dish was really runny and needed to be baked 20 extra minutes. It tasted fantastic though so I'm not too concerned about the extra 20 min. I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to my berries.

This was entirely too sweet for me.  The cobbler part was more like a cookie dough.  For a true cobbler, I'd try another recipe.

The filling was too runny - needs about a Tbsp of flour or something w/ the fruit to thicken it.  Also tasted very orange juice-y and I even added less, about a 1/4 cup of juice, to the berries and it overroad the blueberry flavor.

Okay, so I am the odd star out.  I didn't really think this was that great.  Topping tasted like a cookie (without the chocolate chips).  Too rich.  Also, I thought consistency of blueberries was too runny so I added 1 TBS cornstarch to sugar before adding to blueberries (the second time i made it).  It is just isn't that good.  I picked this recipe because of the star rating but I am going to try something else next time.  It is easy.

My husband is not demonstrative person but he raved about this cobbler.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and added cinamon to mine. I also used more berries than required and the amount called for of OJ.  Since other reviewers had said something about too much moisture, I made sure to drain my fresh berries well after rinsing them, even rolled them in paper towel before putting them in my dish.   I'm not a big fan of cooked fruit but this was good to me too!  Will definitely make it again, oh wait, I've already made 4 more since that first one!

This was very good! It reminded me of a blueberry muffins. It is a good simple recipe and it is very tasty! 
I did not have orange juice so I had to use lemon instead and it still turned out to be really good. I will be using this recipe again!

It's not bad, but certainly not the best ever. I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out tasting like a really good blueberry muffin. No crisp to it, which I would like in a cobbler. The filling is very runny and bubbled up on the sides, not looking too attractive (but certainly flavorful~!) The topping is easy to make, has a simple & yummy taste, not too sweet. I liked this but wouldn't make it again soon; I'll try other cobbler recipes first.

Love this recipe.  It is so simple.  I used froze Michigan Burlington blueberries from last year and they are delicious!  The only thing I might do next time is make in a 11x7 and double the topping.  That's always a complaint in my house, not enough topping.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

HUGE hit.  I made this last night for guests.  I had leftover blueberries and strawberries from earlier in the week that would soon spoil and I wanted an easy way to use them. WOW.  Huge hit, super simple to make.  I made no alterations (other than using the strawberries as well) and it was perfect.

My dad, who is not a dessert man by any means, RAVED about this cobbler. The tastes are very well-balanced. It is not too sweet or sour and the top is light and slightly crunchy. I squeezed one large orange over my berries and added one tablespoon of cornstarch. I love that this dessert is so easy and quick and it leaves you with nearly no dishes.

Very Yummy! Made it with ingredients I had in my pantry except for the fresh blueberries some one gave us. I was looking for a way to use them up...I had already made muffins & pacakes with blueberries, but I came across this recipe and Im Glad I did. I didn't change a thing...It could use a little more topping but if you shoot some whip cream on top, it makes it unbelievable :)

This was easy and delicious!  I'm usually not big on an orange flavor, but it paired well with blueberries.  I followed another reviewer's suggestions: (1) 1/2 t. cinnamon to both berries and batter; (2) increase berries to 5 cups; (3) increase orange juice to 1/2 cup.  My final change was (4) grate orange zest into the batter.  I thought it gave it a nice complete flavor.  The topping is light and cakey.  I would not increase the topping, especially if you do not increase the berry filling.  ...Unless you want cake with some blueberry at the bottom!  Received well by my husband and his family.  Serve warm with whipped cream or ice cream.  Thank you Jen!

I followed the recommendation to add lemon zest and cinnamon to the berries, and also made the strussel top. I used a bit less butter in the original topping and added chunky cinnamon applesauce to make up the difference. To die for!

This was pretty good.  I added cinnamon as other reviewers suggested, but I must have added too much because the cinnamon taste over powered the recipe.  Next time I'll omit it.  I also added 1 extra tablespoon of sugar and I think it made it a little too sweet.  I didn't add any orange juice because I didn't have any.  I also added 1 tablespoon of flour so that it wouldn't be too runny.  Next time I'll just make the recipe as stated and not change anything.  I thought this tasted better cold than it did hot.  It actually was more like a cake than like a cobbler.  All in all it tasted pretty good, was easy to make and it's a great way to use up blueberries.

this was amazing! my first cobbler i have ever made and it was so easy. Next time i know to double the recipe cause everyone loved it and wished there was more. fyi the current recipe can feed about 7-9 with average sized portions. Double it if you need to feed more. Also i sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar on the top after baking, gave it a nice touch of color and flavor.

YUM!!! I made this today and followed the recipe exactly. The only problem is I don't have any leftovers. It was that good. I shared some with my co-workers and my parents too. Everyone that had some loved it. Thanks for a great recipe. I will definitely make this again.

I could only give this recipe 2 stars because what I ended up with was a runny, liquid MESS! I used 4 cups of frozen blueberries & added a little lemon zest to the berry mixture. The only thing I added to the crust was 1/2 tsp cinnamon. It smelled WONDERFUL while it was cooking, but the crust never puffed up like I thought it would. I ended up baking it for 45 minutes in a 8x8 pan and the crust looked like it might burn because it was very, very brown on top. I pulled it from the over after 45 minutes even though it seemed a little jiggly. I figured it was just because the fruit had no thickener. I let it sit for a good 40 minutes before we tried to eat it & when a scooped into it the crust oozed all over the place. I looked like it never even cooked at all. I still tried to eat a little just to see how the flavors were. The taste was just "OK".  In the end this recipe was more of a disaster than anything else. We had to throw out the whole pan which was such a waste of lovely (expensive!) berries. Don't think I'll try this one ever again :-(

this recipe attempts to make an upside-down cake- it never will be as good - if you are only putting 1/4 teas. baking powder- nothing will rise. Perhaps it's a mistake, but followed recipe perfectly and am looking at some really flabby stiff. How about 2 1/2 teas baking powder?Suyz

Truly magnificent!  Some said this was too tart, but I think it was quite tasty and I couldn't taste the orange juice once it was cooked.  The only change I made was using a half strawberry/half blueberry combination (I didn't have enough blueberries to make it alone).  It was fabulous this way--highly recommended.  The filling is slightly runny, so I might add a bit of cornstarch next time around, but all in all, this is wonderful and I'll be making it again.

After reading all the 5 star reviews, I decided to try this recipe.  I thought the cinnamon was a nice touch, so I added a tablespoon to the berries.  This was a simple recipe and it had a simple taste as well.  My family thought it was good but I did not get the feeling that they loved it.  I though it was just OK..and I don't understand all the applause.

This recipe was great.  I really liked the taste of the crust.  I doubled the recipe to make it in a 9 X 13 pan.  I also used blueberries and blackberries to mix it up a little.  I didn't have orange juice, so I used raspberry lemonade and that seemed to work pretty well.

This iis an excellent recipe I followed a couple reviewers suggeston and doubled the batter I am glad I did because the flavor of the batter is superb although I probably  should have baked it just a little longer, it was nice and brown after 35 mins but the inside was just a little raw.

I *wanted* to like this recipe, I really did.  It sounded so good.  But I was really disappointed.  The orange juice gave the berries a strange, almost-rancid flavor and there was not enough sweetness (in either the filling or topping)to really call this "dessert".  I'll try a different recipe next time.

I made this in a round pan vs a square pan (I didn't have a square pan avail...) and enjoyed serving it in pie wedges with vanilla ice cream. I was surprised at how well it all stayed together and the flavor was wonderful - not too blueberry, not tart, but just enough flavor to nicely go with the ice cream. I would definately make this one again!

Fixed this for dessert tonight. It was delicious but didn't give it 5 stars because it really needs more batter. I did add the cinnamon to the berries and the batter as recommended by other reviewers. I also sprinkled corn starch over the berries before adding the batter. I'm used to a more 'southern' cobbler with thick, almost biscuit-like topping. I think I'll increase the amount of batter next time, but otherwise I think it's a great, easy to fix dessert.

Except for doubling this recipe, I followed it exactly. Everyone thought it was wonderful as is, but next time I would like to try it differently based on the more helpful reviews other people have suggested. It really does bake up "bubbly and beautiful" -- a wonderful little dessert to bring to a brunch, or small get-together.

Honestly, I found this recipe better than a cobbler - the cakey topping appealed to me more than the usual granola cobbler topping.  At the time, I didn't have OJ so instead I used fresh lemon juice. It was delicious! And fantastic with vanilla ice cream!

I've made this twice, and it's tasty. The second time I added lemon zest, as another review suggested. I didn't like it as well and wouldn't add it again. It has a great cakey flavor.

I just made this for the first time and it was really good! I had 4 cups of blueberries on hand and used them all.  I added 2 tablespoons instead of 3 because I did not want it overly sweet.  I had no OJ and used 1/3 cup water instead.  Will make again!

Very easy, very tastey...lots of flavor. I did make a couple changes: used cake flour (2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons), tossed the berries, juice & sugar (added 2 tablespoons of lemon zest) in a large bowl prior to placing in the baking dish. Sprinkled 1 tablespoon cornstarch over berry mixture once it was in the baking pan. After spooning the batter over the berries, I spread it out and then sprinkled with sugar prior to & when I removed it from the oven.  Will certainly make this again.

Five stars with a few additions. Used three heaping cups frozen Blueberries & Raspberries.  1)Added about 1 tsp of cinnamon to the berry mixture. 2) Added a sprinkle of cinnamon to the batter. 3) made strudel topping and added 1/2 at the beginning and 1/2 about 20 mins into the baking process. I made one fo these last night for my Husband and I.  This morning he insisted that we make one for his parents too.  The cinnamon and the strudel topping make this to DIE for! Enjoy!

great recipe!

the only things i added were a teaspoon of cinnamon to the topping and a sprinkle of brown sugar on top before baking. i also used a mix of blackberries and blueberries. i imagine  you could use any berries/fruit you like!

we really enjoyed the cake like topping. next time i will double that part of the recipe. yummm!

I bought a jar of blueberries in light syrup the ingredients were blueberries, sugar, and citrus juice. This covered the first part of this recipe. I made the dough ahead of time and put it in the fridge and about halfway through dinner I emptied the jar of blueberries into the baking dish and dotted the top with the dough, couldn't be simpler, or easier I served it with vanilla ice cream for rave reviews and clean plates!

This was really good.  My guy really liked it.  I made some changes like I read in the other notes with the cinnamon and nutmeg but that's it.  I didn't feel like the lemon juice was over powering like I read.  I didn't taste it at all.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is that even though it was very good it's not the best ever I've had.  But I'll be making it again.

This is a tasty recipe, however I was not satisfied with the topping. I was hoping it would be more a a crumb type topping and have some crunch to it. As another reviewer said, it was more cake like.

I over softened the butter, aka melted most of it, and it made the "crust" soft and cookie like. it is still very good. The orange juice makes all the difference, also i threw in cinnamon and nutmeg :)

I really like this recipe, but I have made it twice and the crust was different each time. I'm not sure why.  I used the same ingredients and method as stated in the recipe.  The first time the crust was more cakey. The second time that I made it, it was crispy like a cookie on top.  It was not cakey at all.  This had nothing to do with the cook time.  Either way, it was delicious.

This recipe is relatively simple to make, and it tastes so good! Instead of using just blueberries, I used 3 cups worth of blueberries and red raspberries which worked out perfectly. I also followed some other reviews, and I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to batter and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon to fruit. I had to bake the cobbler for about 45-50 minutes. Very thin crust.

I made this for my husband and 4 kids. They loved it! Including my husband who doesn't eat blueberries. The topping is wonderful. I will use when making other cobblers. The blueberry mix was a little runny so I will add some cornstarch to the blueberry mix next time. Thanks so much for this great, easy recipe!

With ten pounds of fresh Michigan blueberries, this is the recipe I selected for dessert tonight. Excellent!
I will definately be making this again before all the blueberries are used up.

This was an easy to make desert, yet quite good. I dint have fresh berries, so I used frozen, and after reading other reviews, I also added cinnamon to both the berries and the batter. I reduced the sugar by a tablespoon as I felt the berries were quite sweet, yet still it came out delicious!

I followed the recipe mostly as written but added the zest of one lemon.  Half the zest to the blueberries and the other half to the crust.  I also added a couple more tablespoons sugar just to make sure it wasn't too tart.  Figured I couldn't go wrong with lemons flavoring and blueberries.  I also added a 1/2 tsp. of butter flavoring and then cut down on the butter to save calories.  
It was a little underdone in the middle but seemed perfect around the edges so broiled it a few minutes rather than overcooking it.
This was really, really good.  We ate it plain but kept commenting that it would be phenomonal with whip cream or vanilla bean ice cream.

Really yummy summer dessert! I didn't have enough blueberries on hand but sliced apple pieces complemented the blueberries nicely. Overall an easy treat that doesn't require an extra shopping trip- everything you need is most likely on hand!

I recently made this for a fourth of July picnic.  It was great!  People raved about it.  I did put a bit more sugar into the blueberry mixture but other than that followed the recipe as it was stated.  More than one person asked me for the recipe.  This one is a keeper!  It's also extremely easy!

Very good!  I made with blackberries instead of blueberries....because they are my favorite!  Crust was good - and didn't turn out too "cake-like"...  Not too sweet at all.

I can't really complain about this recipie.  It's not the 'best' I've ever had, but it's the best I've ever made.  There's this diner in Northport, Alabama that makes the best, but I don't know the recipie, so this one will have to do.  I used frozen berries and just drained the juice.  I also doubled the recipie and used a 9x13 baking dish.  The only thing I changed with the ingredients was adding two extra tablespoons to the doubled recipie when mixing the sugar and the berries together.  I made it for my family, and they all loved it.  I will make it again for sure.

THIS WAS A HIT WITH MY HUSBAND (AND THATS SAYING A LOT).  I USED FRESH BLACKBERRIES AND 4TBS OF SUGAR IN BERRY MIX.  I ALSO ADDED 2 DASHES OF NUTMEG AND 1/4TSP OF CINNAMON WHICH WAS SUGGESTED BY SOMEONE ELSE.  IT WAS PERFECT. TY

Great recipe. I used frozen blueberries, right out of the freezer. As suggested by another reviewer, I tossed one and a half tbsps corn starch into the berries to help thicken, and also added 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon, and a few dashes of nutmeg. I baked about 10 mns longer than directed. It was absolutely delicious. Even better the next day. BUT, I definitely suggest making double the batter. I made the amount stated in the recipe and thought the recipe could definitely use more to make it like a standard cobbler.

This is great! The only changes I made were to use a 1 lb bag of frozen blueberries (thawed for 30 minutes) & add a tablespoon of cornstarch to the orange juice before mixing with the berries. I served it warm with vanilla ice cream. I have also made it with only strawberries, and it was great too!

This was wonderful, I also doubled the topping and spread it to the edges of the pan.  Just for fun I tossed in a pint of raspberries.  Took it to a dinner, and the host kept the leftovers and sent me home with a dirty pan......guess she liked it.

This dessert was devoured this evening! My center was just a little undercooked even though the top was at the perfect color and the exact time had passed when I pulled it out to cool. I did add about 2 T. of blueberry jam when the o.j. went in. Thanks!

I had to use frozen blueberries but it was still quite good.  The topping was very cake-like, not what we're used to but delicious nonetheless.

We pick fresh berries at a local farm.  I've tried this recipe with blueberries, raspberries, & ollalieberries.  We enjoy it every time and I like that it isn't too sugary/sweet tasting.  Even better with ice cream or soy cream.

I generally prefer pie crust type cobbler, but this crust is so delicious.  Like others, I did 1.5 times the crust, except for the egg.  Yum!!!

Although I am the type of person who uses cakes mixes when it comes to desserts, I found this recipe to be very easy and delicious.  I used 2 cups of blueberries and 1 cup of raspberry instead and it came out fine.  The crust isn't exactly how I had expected, but the cobbler still tastes great.

Used this as a base for a low carb version.  Completely omitted sugar, used 3/4 cup almond flour instead of all-purpose, and substitued lemon zest of 1 lemon for orange juice.  Based on other reviews, halved the blueberries.  Turned out YUMMY!  Sweet enough from berries and almond flour, and safe for a low-carb diet!  Will make again soon!

This was really delicious!   I will definitely make it again and again.  Following the advice of "jmaunder" I added a streusel topping because I like a crunchy cobbler but I think it would be delicious either way.  This one is a keeper!

I had some leftover blueberry pie filling so I used it in place of the blueberry/sugar/orange juice combination. It turned out great and I would make it the same way again.

Although my family liked this dessert, I think we prefer more of a crust-type cobbler.  I should have taken the advise of the other reviewers and doubled the topping.  I used fresh blueberries and added a small bag of frozen blackberries.  I added a little of the juice from the blackberries and about a teaspoon more of the sugar with the filling mixture.  It could not have been easier and the filling mixture was awsome.  I will definately make this again and try it with a refridgerated pie crust.  Oh yea, you gotta have vanilla ice cream!

I made this using fresh Blackberries - which were pretty tart.  I was doubling the recipe and used a glass 13x9 pan. I added 2/3 cup sugar to the berries, a dash of cinnamon and the orange juice. I just doubled the crust recipe and then sprinkled a little sugar over the top. The result was wonderful!  I got rave reviews from my family and guests.

This recipe is so good that I'm tired of making it.  Every time I get together with other folks my wife insists that I make "the blueberries".  I finally found some good blueberries yesterday and the results were wonderful. They were gone before the other desserts were started.  Thanks for sharing.  Plump blueberries really make a difference!

I've had cobbler before, but this is the first time I have made it.  The filling was good, sweet and juicy.  The crust was good but not cooked underneath.  I would certainly make it again if I knew how to fix the crust problem.

I have made this recipe 3 times and it tastes great.  The first time I doubled the topping recipe but not the fruit and it came out fine.  The last two times the topping/crust has browned on the top and remained raw underneath.  I think it is because I doubled the whole recipe but I also added cooking time.  I am going to use less butter and add more flour next time and see if that helps.  If anyone else has had the same experience, I would love suggestions on how to remedy this.  It tastes wonderful and the first time I made it It was the best cobbler I had ever tasted.

This was really simple and really delicious. I loved the crust, it was really airy and cake-like. I will definitely make it over and over again.

I really enjoyed this cobbler. I made it for Memorial day and it was a big hit. 
 I made one blueberry, and the other I made stawberry rubarb, which was absolutely wonderful. It was a great receipe

The only thing I would do differently next time would be to reduce the sugar. The blueberries were already so sweet that it did not need what the recipe called for. Thanks for sharing!

This cobbler was excellent.  Not the least bit "soupy".   It was the perfect recipe for my 
7yr old son to help with.  I will definitely be making this again for myself, family and friends. I highly recommend it!

A recipe worth making again! Just the right amount of sweet & tart. Doubled the recipe & put it in a 9x13 pan...had to bake a tad longer, but turned out perfectly.

I think the cobbler was excellent. I did add an additional one cup of blueberries to this recipe as well as a tablespoon of flour that I put in with blueberries. The end result was the perfect ratio of fruit to Christ and a very well set cobbler. Because some of my blueberries were sour I added 1 tablespoon sugar to the blueberries as well as the flour I mentioned.  I would have given 5 stars but the recipe did need the extra blueberries and flour to make the consistency the way cobbler normally looks and tastes.

I made this recipe according to the video and peanutty's recommendation to add cinnamon. I believed it worked and paired well. I prefer an under sweet taste, that is, I want to taste the fruit and not a bucket load of sugar. I had exceptional blueberries and they really came through. It has received good reviews at a recent church carry-in I'll make this again but will find a crunchier topping recipe try I augment.

I have never liked cobblers so don't know what it is about this one but I have now used this recipe at least 5 times and I completely enjoy it.  I have even made for friends and used mixed berries, the texture and flavor are perfect for me.

Turned out perfect, I just followed some of the other reviews about substitutions and their recommendations ! Added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the blueberry mixture. Then for the cake top filling I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and added a bit of cinnamon, I also created a crunchy top layer made of 1/2 cup of chopped pecans, 1/3 cup of oats, 1/3 cup of brown sugar, and around 2 tbsp of melted butter.

I will certainly make this again. I had 2 cups so prorated the recipe accordingly. Also didn’t have the right pan, given my smaller recipe I made this in a tin loaf pan and it came out great.

I followed this recipe ALMOST exactly... lol... I know, I know... when you make a few changes it is no longer the posted recipe, BUT, without this recipe I would have been lost... so, with that said... THIS IS THEE MOST DELICIOUS COBBLER, EVER!!!! The only things I changes were... 4 cups of fruit (I had blueberries and nectarines), 4 TB of BROWN sugar, Pineapple juice (no orange juice in the fridge) and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to both the fruit and the batter along with an increase in vanilla to 1/2 TB. Let me tell you, this was divine!! I let it cool a bit then had to, you know, just taste a corner of the pan... which led to eating a whole bowl... OMG... I don't know if I'm going to share with the hubs.... lol. Oh yeah, and I added 1 TB of cornstarch to the berries. Yummmm!!!!

Great and easy recipe! Read the reviews and followed some of their suggestions. With the added cinnamon and nutmeg to the blueberry mixture, a little cornstarch as well, and the lemon zest in the dough mixture this recipe goes from a 4star to a 5star.

I agree with another review.  This was like a cake topping, not a cobbler crust.  It was very bland.  My husband and I did not like.

"Best ever" is no exaggeration.  This cobbler was super easy and absolutely delicious!  I didn't expect it to be so yummy.  I did add a 2 good shakes of cinnamon--as recommended by the video.

Omg, I made this as a surprise for my love because he loves blueberry anything and let me tell you, it was a HIT!!!!! He was so amazed and it “this cobbler is everything”.  And now the rest of the family wants me to make more.  This time I’ll incorporate strawberries or raspberries.  They can’t wait.

I followed many suggestions to double the topping, but it didn't turn out as I had hoped.  I doubled the flour, butter, eggs, etc, but there was way too much butter.  Can someone give me the exact measurements to increase the topping by 1.5 or 2X?  Everything was delicious and will make again.  Very easy to make.

Delicious! I cooked it in a slightly different shaped pan because my 8x8 was dirty and it turned out fine.  Much better than the Puoneer Woman cobbler, which I have also tried.

Perfect! Such a simple, delicious recipe. I reduced juice to 2 Tbsp since I was using thawed frozen blueberries, and sugar to 2 T as well. Otherwise perfect as is; I was even pleased with the cobbler/fruit ratio even tho I usually like more topping than recipes call for. Definitely a keeper!

This was delicious! I followed it to the letter (just had to add a few strawberries because I was short on blueberries), and it turned out perfectly. The topping was buttery and soft with a little crisp. I like it much more than the typical more crumbly cobbler!

This was the bomb! Made it exactly as recipe calls for. I picked wild blueberries from the yard. Will try the cinnamon suggestion next time. It really was more like a 4.5 star experience. 5 is reserved for perfection. Pretty darn close.

Turned out great just as it is written, though I did increase the amounts of everything and basically made one and one half times the recipe. Served the cobbler warm with ice cream, it was wonderful.  Will make it regularly since we have several blueberry bushes!

I doubled the recipe and baked in a 12x9” dish.  The only change I made was adding 1 tsp cinnamon to blueberry mixture and 1 tsp cinnamon to flour mixture. It was pretty juicy so maybe next time I’ll use 1/2 c orange juice instead of  2/3.  I will definitely be making this again.

The middle did not get done. But the outside was really good. Best served hot with vanilla ice cream. I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to both layers and used 4 cups blueberries. Next time I will use a 9x13 pan and double the top layer.

Absolutely terrible recipe. The topping was overly sweet and cake like. I also had to bake it an additional 20 minutes because the batter was completely raw under a cooked top layer. I followed directions to a t. Save yourself the disappointment and try a different recipe.

This is wonderful! My family loved it.  I did not have orange juice so I substituted lemon juice and added an additional TBSP of sugar to compensate for the tartness. Will definitely make this again.  Served it with freshly whipped cream. YUM!

This came out amazing! I used salted butter to have a bit more salty-sweet play. The filling was delicious and the crust was perfect!! Buttery, crispy, and capable of soaking up some of the orange-blueberry juice. (A scoop of vanilla ice cream would be a great complement to this dish!)

Any left over liquid will probably get put into a smoothie or reduced into a nice glaze for ice cream, pancakes, or waffles. :D

Other than a sprinkle of cinnamon to both the blueberry mix and dry mix - I made it as directed and it was fabulous. Super easy and looking forward to making with fresh blueberries now that summer is almost here!

I like my crust a little more crumbly. I may experiment with stirring in the dry ingredients instead of using the mixer.

very nice, thin topping, I like thicker but this still is a tasty dessert.
I'd call it a cobbler as some thought it needed a crusty top. Not so as recipes vary vary

I no longer make blueberry pancakes thanks to this recipe. I omitted the sugar in the berries and use wild blueberries. Any juice works great for this recipe. Pairs great with homemade vanilla ice cream!

So tasty!! I love the cake like topping its perfect with the tartness of the blueberries. I will agree I think its important to taste the fruit before adding the sugar. I used a little less than the 1/2 of sugar and it is perfect. I also doubled the crust topping Ingrediants.  It was just enough to almost fully cover the filling and ensured each bite was perfect! 

Thank you for this recipe so delish : )

I've made this recipe many times over the years, I've substituted grape juice for the orange juice a few times and thought the taste was better. I always sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on top before placing in to the oven, this simple step makes a huge difference.... I've also used this recipe for fresh wild picked blackberries, delicious everytime!

I made more topping as well. Used brown sugar for half the sugar. I didn't have orange juice, so I added lemon zest and juice from half a lemon. Brushed top with cream and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.  Great!

This is an easy, delicious blueberry cobbler.  I use a half cup more berries and a little less sugar just because I have used locally picked blueberries.  I have frozen my berries, just thaw completely before cooking .  They have plenty of sweetness.  Crust has nice texture and flavor. Everyone has loved it. Go ahead and try it. U do not need to be a baker.

Delicious! I added cinnamon to berry and flour mixture. I added cornstarch to berry mixture as well. Did 1.5x the crust and by doing that berries should be increased to 5-6 cups. Easy and yummy, especially on a chilly fall day.

The batter is probably my favorite part of this recipe.  It's not as dough like as I am used to with my mother's recipe but I really enjoyed the cake like batter with the blueberries.  Not too sweet.  It was perfect and my family loved it! I did double the batch and used a few more blueberries than the recipe called for.

Positively perfect. Pretty simple recipe. Love it just out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or the next day all by itself, both are delicious.

This is my go-to cobbler recipe. Its so quick and simple with fantastic results.  I've made it with Blueberries, raspberries, peaches, and now blackberries.  I've made it as written, or decreased the sugar by 1/3rd when I don't want something so sweet, and it always turns out excellent.  I've also tried it without the orange juice and just a squeeze of lemon (about 2 tsps) and it still was terrific. With the peaches, I added a little cinnamon. However, I never skimp on butter, because that gives it the richness and buttery flavor that is top notch. Thanks, Jen!

I read some of the suggestions by others. I made a double batch for a 9x13. I had 6 cups blueberrys & added the 1/2 teaspoon cinn to berries & batter. I also tossed berries with 2 TB corn starch to thicken. Used juice of 2 lemons instead of orange juice & zested the lemons over berries before I squeezed juice. I used 2 cups flour & 3 eggs. Next time I will add another 1/2 recipe for batter. I took it for a family cookout & it was fabulous, there were 2 small pieces left & a friend said I'm taking this back to our cabin so no one else gets it. Topped with cool whip. Definitely a keeper. Would be great with peaches too.

This was AWESOME. I cut back on the blueberries & there still wasn’t enough topping, that is the only negative. I did  use cinnamon as previous reviewers suggested & that is key. 
This recipe is a keeper!

This was yummy! Because I was bringing this to a BBQ, I doubled recipe, baking it in a 3qt rectangular casserole dish. I took others' review suggestions as follows: It's summer so I used in-season local blueberries and diced peaches. Increased OJ to 1/2C per recipe, but I felt it made the fruit mix a bit too watery. Next time I'll stick with the original 1/3C per recipe. Added 1/2t cinnamon  (doubled to 1t for mine) to both fruit mix and topping and it was perfect. Added roasted pecan chips to topping for nuttiness.  Served with  premium vanilla ice cream.

I followed this recipe exactly and will definately make it again!  My boyfriend said he just wanted ice cream for dessert but I ignored him and served this cobbler with a scoop of 7-11 brand chocolate covered strawberry ice cream (strawberry ice cream with chocolate chips and strawberries) and it was awesome!! I think he will trust my (dessert related) judgement in the future!

This recipe was perfect. I added about a half a cup extra of berries and I used strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries. Recipe came out awesome! Not overly sweet, and just the right amount of topping. My whole family devoured it!

I doubled for a 9x13 pan, tripled fruit for a total of 6 cups, added a little cinnamon to the batter. I made GF simply by substituting GF all purpose flour cup for cup, made dairy free by subbing almond milk and Earth Balance butter. Absolutely delicious!

I made this even though I didn't quite have the right ingredients, so I ended up making a lot of substitutions. I used thawed frozen mixed berries instead of fresh blueberries and a dash of almond milk in place of orange juice. I was also about 3 Tbs shy of 1/2 cup of butter so I supplemented with vegetable oil. Even with all the substitutions, it turned out wonderfully. My husband loved it and immediately got seconds. I'll definitely try making this when I actually have the right ingredients.

However, I decided to watch the video associated with this recipe and was upset to see they include cinnamon in the video recipe but its not listed in the written recipe. Now I have a cobbler with no cinnamon. :(

My blueberries are just starting to ripen good so I figured it would be perfect. After reading several reviews, the biggest thing I noticed was that it needed more crust on top. I was working with 5 cups so I adjusted the sugar and juice amount accordingly and added 1 level tbsp. flour to that. I doubled the crust/topping amounts and baked in a 9x13 pan. It was delicious with the perfect amount of topping. I think fresh picked blueberries have a hint of tartness whereas store bought seem sweeter to me. Maybe that's why some reviewers said the addition of sugar to the berries was too sweet????? That you for a delicious recipe.

Everyone in Florida picks blueberries in April and May. With no more room in the freezer I found this recipe and was able to use 3 cups of berries. Glad I did.  I added in some fresh raspberries and used peach juice instead of the OJ. Sprinkled a little sugar on top before baking and we now have a new favorite cobbler. You can’t go wrong with this one and it’s so easy to prepare. Enjoy!

This is the absolute best blueberry cobber I 've had and it is easy.  In addition to using fresh blueberries, I've also used canned cherries ($1.69 thanks Aldi's )and canned apple pie filling with no need for the orange juice/sugar mixed with the canned fruit.

I made this cobbler using frozen blueberries. I added the orange juice, but found there was too much liquid. I baked it longer, hoping it would reduce the liquid,  but it did not.
Next time, I would skip the orange juice, but add grated orange peel to get the orange flavour.

Substituted 1/4 almond extract for vanilla because there was no vanilla in the cabinet - turned out great. Also cut one tbsp of sugar in the blueberries and it was still plenty sweet - if your fruit is sweet you can cut sugar in the fruit mix.

This was delicious! The only change I made was to add a little cinnamon to the blueberries and topping as others had suggested. We really loved this! It was perfect for a cold snowy day.

This recipe is fantastic! pair it with a small dollop of French vanilla ice cream and friends and family will think you were in cooking school for years! A rating less than 5 does this recipe an injustice.

We grow blueberries and I make this cobbler weekly year around, it never gets old. I use an 8x12 pan triple the berry bottom. So, 9 cups blueberries, if frozen rinse in cold water a couple minutes in a strainer. 9 tbsp sugar. Add a dash of cinnamon. A substitution of Apple cider vinegar for the Orange juice is killer, I use 2 capfulls  ( prob 2 tsp equivalent). I double the cake topping. 1 cup both butter and sugar. 2 eggs. Another dash of cinnamon addition. 1/2 tsp baking powder, dash of salt, 1 1/3 cups flour. I use a 1/4 cup of milk to thin the batter and make it easy to pour and spread. Bake 40-45 same temperature, 375. Props to the review ideas I used.

I have made this recipe three times using blueberries, peaches, and Marion berries and only made a couple tweaks to it based on what other reviewer’s said regarding measurements for the topping, adding cinnamon and adding 2 tablespoon of corn starch if there is a lot of fluid in the berries.  My family really enjoys it warm with vanilla ice cream on top.

This cobbler is fantastic and super simple to make. I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I may use less sugar. My blueberries were local and fresh so they were very sweet on their own.

Best cobbler ever. So easy. And just slightly different then the normal cobbler. I think it's the orange juice. You can't really taste it - it just gives it a wonderful taste. My whole family devoured it in one night!

I loved, loved, loved this recipe. So easy to make. I did substitute 3 tablespoons of Sucanat instead of white sugar and I also used 1/3 of a cup of brown rice flour and 1/3 cup of white flour. The cobbler was not super sweet which is a plus. I do recommend a dash of cinnamon too.

While the flavor was good, the texture was disappointing. The topping was thin and sank into the blueberry filling. There are other cobbler recipes I like better.

My family loved this recipe! I would only change two things -- double the topping (I love lots of dough on my cobblers -- and add 1 teaspoon of tapioca to thicken the berries. I don't care much for runny berries, but it probably would be fine without the tapioca, which I added. 

Great recipe!

OMG This is the best ever. Only thing I changed was I used frozen blueberries and used the juice from the bag with the orange juice. For those that didn't like it, either they disregarded the recipe or just don't like cobblers!!!

The taste was good to me but the texture was not. I added the cinnamon like many had suggested and my family said they would have preferred it without - that it took away from the taste of the blueberries. Like many others have said, the "cobbler" was cake like - almost like a shortcake that soaked into the fruit. I prefer a crispy cobbler. I won't make it again.

It was a huge hit!!!  I made this twice over the weekend for two different parties.  Both times, I tripled the recipe and used a lasagna dish to serve 18-20 people.  I also did half blueberry and half strawberry.  Without any changes, it was not too sweet.  I brought ice cream to serve with it both times, but it stood so well on its own!!

Added the cinnamon and it was so good! Also I didn't have orange juice so I "made" some out of hot water and Orange Marmalade--it was all I had! Definitely will make 1.5 of the topping next time.

Made according to recipe, adding a little cinnamon as suggested to the fruit and dough. This is a good dessert but not very cobbler-like. The dough was similar to dropping little cookies over the filling.  Real southern cobbler is hot fruit filling with pie crust or biscuit dough on top. 

This is s good dessert but I would never present it as "cobbler" to my family.

Delicious - this was a huge hit with my family!  Everyone agreed the orange juice gave a nice, light citrus sweetness to the blueberries.  I followed the recipe exactly, just adding a sprinkle of cinnamon, doubling it for my glass casserole dish and lowering the temp by 25 degrees.  I am looking forward to using this recipe for mixed berries.  Thank you!

This is a very adaptable recipe, which I have used as a jumping-off point time and again.  This time I used Truvia  baking mix instead of sugar (1/4 cup in the topping and 1.5 Tb in the fruit).  Also added cinnamon as recommended by others.  I think it turned out well.

Okay so I made this thinking that it would be amazing. But sadly this recipe is not for me. When i made it, it had basically a pool of syrup at the bottom of the pan. Anyway not to complain but here's a tip. When your adding the ingredients to the blueberries, make sure you drain some of the liquid before you put it in the pan. Just a little tip. Also try doubling the recipe for the crust, there was hardly any. The crust was the best part though..... ( you will have some extra dough though)

yes, I used splenda  instead of sugar, reduced the amount to 2 tbsp on the blueberries with a bit of water instead of orange juice.  In the  topping I used half the sugar (splenda) Was delicious , berries had a nice tart flavor.  My company asked for seconds.

Loved this, just the way it was designed. Cinnamon would probably be a lovely addition, but for me, this came out perfectly. Just the right amount of dough (I think doubling it would have made it really cakey), and the blueberries mixture was exactly the right amount of sweet. I loved that this recipe didn't use cornstarch to gooey-up the blueberries. Only possible change for me was to reduce the amount of orange juice--nobody else could taste it, but my first bite was a bit of orange-blueberry. Very good vanilla ice cream is a must to top this off!

This recipe is really, really good.  I just love the hint of orange juice in the background of the blueberries.  I made it exactly the way it was written except that I used 2 tbsp sugar instead of 3 on the blueberries because they were really sweet.  It's a make again for sure.

This dessert was a total hit my husband devoured it :).
We are a non-dairy family so used a dairy free margarine instead of butter. I wanted more crunch to my cobbler and to introduce a nut flavour so added half a teaspoon of almond extract and some spliced almonds as well as chunks of strawberries had a few in the fridge so threw them in. We aren't orange juice drinkers so I used a mango peach juice instead. Used brown sugar instead of white for the topping and did a 2:1 ratio of flour to oats... Also based my baking dish with margarine.. So I guess I kind of made the dish my own... Going to make it next time with almond meal so my gluten-free family members can enjoy when we have them over for dinner :).

Using a 9x13 glass dish, I doubled the recipe
Substituted large frozen blueberries for fresh using only
3 TBS orange juice and the called for 3 TBS sugar
 also added 1 tsp of ground ginger to the batter.
Turned out excellent.
Served with large scoop of Blue Bell  Natural Vanilla Bean Ice Cream

I used frozen blueberries, and I added frozen strawberries and a small, lonely apple that was pining away in the fruit basket. It was absolutely delicious and incredibly easy to make. It's a keeper! Thank you so much!

Loved this, definitely will make again!!  The fruit released a lot of juice  but the juice was so good, I scooped it up with a spoon like soup.  I didn't have any ice cream or whipped cream but this recipe is so good, I didn't miss it!!

First time I made it just  as written in the recipe.  Was a bit hit with the hubby and my dinner guests.  I changed the extract to Almond the next time and it was still very well received.  This last time I used a frozen three berry mix - raspberries, blueberries and blackberries - I did thaw them slightly, and it went like crazy for my Superbowl Party!

This is a wonderful recipe. The top crust tastes like a sugar cookie. Don't even need ice cream. Has plenty of sweetness on its own.

I used 3 cups frozen blueberries dusted with 1 tbs flour, to prevent any blue bleeding through the crust. Then I poured the sugar and the other berry ingredients over the top. It turned out AMAZING!

I made this recipe gluten free. Subbed gluten free flour for wheat flour, used egg whites instead of whole egg, gluten free baking powder, coconut sugar rather than white sugar. My family has decided this is best ever desert.

Not too sweet. Excellent flavor. And I added 1/4 cup oatmeal, and 1/8 cup raw wheatgerm and hubby still LOVED it. ;)

The basic recipe is very good but I would recommend the changes made by Peanutty or JMAUNDER in the reviews to make it five stars. Would make again. Do prefer I crispier crust and this is more cake like but still quite wonderful. Thank you for sharing.

Not too sweet. I used frozen blueberries from last summer. I did not have orange juice so I used the zest and juice from an orange and the blue berry juice to make 1/3 cup.  I wish I made a double batch!

Love it.  Made it several times.  Use 2 cups blueberries as that is how they are sold locally, and the juice of 1 orange - cut the sugar back accordingly, otherwise mine is the same as the recipe.

I used 20 oz. of frozen blueberries and followed some other reviewer's recommendation to add nutmeg, cinnamon, and lemon extract.  I also added lemon extract to the cobbler part and doubled the cobbler part. Next time, I wouldn't double the cobbler part, since I didn't think there were enough berries. I also overbaked it a bit, since it seemed so juicy, but it really wasn't too bad once it was refrigerated. However, adding 2 Tbsp of cornstarch would probably help next time.

Mmm... Loved this recipe, but my favorite when I make these changes:  I've made it a few times now.  I don't always have blueberries on hand though.  So, something I started doing was thawing out frozen mixed berries.  I actually like that much better than just the blueberries, but the juice needs to be drained after thawing.  I also used 1 tsp. orange juice concentrate in place of the o.j.  
I wanted this to turn out a little heartier so I started adding a little bit of oats to the batter.
Also, sprinkle some sugar on the top right before baking.  This will add a little sugary crunch to the top.  My favorite!

Thank you so much for sharing.  I used a combo of raspberries and blackberries. This is an awesome recipe and I will most definitely be making it again.  I think that I will add a little cornstarch in the future.  I knew that it was going to be fantastic after I tasted the dough.

My family and friends loved this cobbler. I doubled the batch and put it in a 9x13. I used about 7 cups of frozen blueberries and added some cinnamon to the batter. With the frozen berries it needed to bake a little longer, the middle was not set. Next time I will cover with foil for part of the time and bake a bit longer. Wonderful cobbler!

Blueberries have never been so delicious!   The orange juice really adds something.   My cobbler turned out to be mostly blueberries with relatively little non-blueberry topping, but this was 100% fine with my family.   The entire 2 quart dish was devoured within 24 hours, and I hope to make another cobbler this week.

P.S.  I omitted the cinnamon because my DH claims he hates cinnamon.  I love cinnamon and this cobbler was absolutely delicious even without it.

Perfect as is, but I did add a little cinnamon for my family's taste. Everyone loved it!! Can't wait to try with other fruits.

Excellent!  I followed directions and it was delicious.  The crust is crispy on top and like a biscuit under.  Tastes like a blueberry shortcake.  Orange juice adds a nice complexity.  This is my new go to recipe for cobbler.  I'm going to try with peaches next.

Loved this recipe. I made it just as the recipe is written and put it in an 8x8 glass pan. It was done after 42 minutes and tasted amazing. I felt like the topping was plenty for the size pan and would not change anything.

Here is the recipe with the most common additions in the reviews:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
In an 8 inch square baking dish, mix 3 cups fruit and/or berries, 3 tablespoons sugar, ½ TSP cinnamon, 2 dashes ground nutmeg, 1.5 tbsp. cornstarch, 1/2 tsp of lemon zest(grated peel), and ? cup orange juice. Set aside. In a small bowl, mix 2/3 cup flour, ¼ TSP baking powder, ½ TSP cinnamon, and a pinch of salt. Set aside.
In a medium bowl, cream ½ cup butter and 1/2 cup sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in 1 egg and ½ TSP vanilla extract. Gradually add flour mixture, stirring just until ingredients are combined. Drop batter by rounded tablespoons over blueberry mixture. Try to cover as much of filling as possible.
Streusel topping: Mix 1/3 cup Bisquick, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 2 tbsp. butter and 1/2 cup chopped pecans. Sprinkle over batter filling. 
Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until topping is golden brown and filling is bubbling.

Perfect cobbler recipe. Delicious! I made it with blackberries and  peaches. Simply added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg to fruit based on personal preference. Also added a teaspoon of cornstarch to the fruit filling. Will definitely use this recipe in the future.

This is the best and one of the easiest cobbler recipes I have found.  I have served to both family and friends and they loved it.  I agree that adding cinnamon (one teaspoon to the blueberries and one to the batter) to the recipe  makes it a "stand out" dessert!  The video is also helpful  and shows how easy it is to make.

Only used 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. I only needed 1/4 cup of water at the end. This was the best sloppy joe recipe I have ever made! It's a keeper!

This cobbler was simply delicious! I went with the other reviewer's suggestion and added cinnamon  and lemon zest. I used 1 TBSP of cinnamon for a kick in every bite. I honestly think the cobbler topping would not have been as good if not for the cinnamon. The recipe doubled perfectly.

I've made this once before.  It's very good.  The only real changes that you absolutely should make is the cinnamon to both the topping and blueberries.  Blueberry has a flavor that cinnamon brings out - seriously, it's science.  The streusel topping is probably good too, no doubt, but I didn't have the ingredients for that.  The cornstarch will create a thicker filling, which you might like or dislike - I opted to leave it out in this batch.  I doubled it, using a 9x13" pan,  and about 8 cups of blueberries.  It fit in there perfectly,  and now my only plan is to get fat and netflix the night away, filled with blueberry goodness.  Praise the sun!

Very simple.  Very good.  I used lime juice instead of orange juice.  Perfect.

Works well with fresh peaches also.

Loved this recipe for cobbler! It was gone in 20 hours -- I only got two servings and my husband gobbled up the rest. I wish I could take off a quarter star, though, because it has SO MUCH BUTTER in it. It's fabulous taste-wise, but pretty unhealthy. I also had trouble spreading the crust over the berries, but that's probably true of all cobblers. This recipe was so easy to make! I spent longer cleaning and checking the berries than mixing together the whole crust. This will be my go-to any time I have berries or fruit about to go bad.

It was good, but I thought that there was too much of the blueberry filling.
Next time, will cut blueberries in half.

First time making a blueberry cobbler & most certainly will make it again. Followed the tips left by other users, such as adding cinnamon to the filling and the top & was outstanding. Used fresh blueberries, which was also a first for me. I doubled the recipe, so using a 9x13 pan was excellent

This is a pretty good recipe. Still came rather juicy as I used fresh blueberries. Next time I think I will try on a bit of flour or cornstarch to the blueberry mixture. Tastes good though

Hello, fellow bakers! 
I suggrest doubling all of the ingredients in this recipe (besides the blueberries! there's plenty!).  I definitely found that using a 8x8 baking pan did not go as we had hoped and we were forced to make another batch! We also recommend either stirring the blueberries in with the entirety of the mixture,  or putting half of the mixture on the bottom, add the blueberries, then add the other half of the mixture on the top (after doubling the recipe of course! )Also plan on adding a brown sugar topping in the near future.

I made this as directed but with 1 cup extra blueberries because I have so many. It seemed too watery as first but when it cooled off completely, it was perfect. The crust is cakey but not like cake sitting on top; it bound the fruit together and was a great consistency.

I do recommend making 50% more crust, as mine didn't totally cover the top. Will certainly make again

First cobbler - delish!  Used the top reviews suggestions :). I made it with more sugar because I was using frozen Alaskan blueberries that are way tart.  Used the review with the crumb top, but halved the crumb top.

Made with Bob's Gluten Free Flour blend instead of wheat flour, it was incredible and crispy out of the oven. The refrigerated leftovers turned to mush, but they were still quite tasty.

This is a giant blueberry muffin, not a cobbler. It was ok but not what I was looking for.

I've made this twice in two days.  The first time, I doubled the recipe - it was very runny, but guests said they liked it that moist (were they just being polite?)  I did increase the cooking time.  The second time I made a single batch using half the orange juice called for; again I had to increase the cooking time, but it was perfect! Both times I used fresh berries, since frozen would make more juice.  Overall: easy, flavor is very good.  I will use this recipe again. Serve warm with ice cream and/or whipped cream.  Yum!

I usually don't like cobbler but this recipe is a keeper, its easy and quick and goes well with vanilla ice cream.  I made the recipe as what it called for, except I used fresh squeezed orange 
juice.

My husbands coworkers loved it. I thought the topping was flat and would have liked it more cakelike. It was quite sugary too.

This was amazing!  My husband said it's the best blueberry dessert he's ever had, and I agree.  I did change some things, though.  I added oats and crushed pecans to the topping, used frozen organic blueberries, doubled the vanilla, sprinkled nutmeg over the berries after they were mixed, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the crust, and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the berry mix.  I normally don't rate recipes when I make so many modifications, but it was too good not to.

Very tasty recipe. I took the advice of others and added cinnamon to the fruit mixture and dough mixture. I also added a few drops of lemon juice and a couple of pinches of dried lemon zest from Penzey's Spices to the fruit mixture .  I used brown sugar instead of white sugar in the dough mixture.  This was an amazing cobbler. I'm making it again today, but with peaches instead.

I thought this was almost perfect.  I used frozen blue berries, and there was a lot of liquid when it was done.  I am not a sugar nut so I cut the sugar way back.  One table spoon in the blue berries and two table spoons in the topping.    I think it might actually be better with more topping.  The next time I am going to increase the amount of topping by 1/2 and I believe I will add some corn starch to the berries.

This is a perfect recipe. I used defrosted frozen berries and added a sprinkle of cinnamon to them before adding the topping. I baked in individual ramekins. Otherwise followed the recipe to a T. So good!

Made this for my husband for his birthday and he was very happy with it. I was short almost a cup of blueberries so I only used 1/4 cup orange juice and 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar, other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I will definitely make again. I think next time I will try adding cornstarch to thicken the berries and make 1.5 times the dough as others have done and see how it turns out.

Never again! The topping just melted and spread out like a very thin crust.  Not a cobbler at my house.  Look at the other "cobbler" recipes pictures.  So disappointed as I made it for company.

I added a little cinnamon like the other reviews suggested, otherwise I stuck to the original recipe. I would skip the Orange juice! Too much of a citrus taste at the last note of your bite.

Was delicious, used 4 cups of fruit, has some rasberries so I added them to the blueberries. I didn't have orange juice so I used pineapple and cranberry juice was great. I used only 2 tbsp. of sugar to fruit as fruit was sweet enough. I also added a pinch of nutmeg to flour mixture. This was the best desert I have found on this site. Was amazing. Thanks

My first blueberry cobbler. I loved it. The crust is sweet, almost to sweet and it's not doughy. The blueberries really popped thanks to the orange juice. I saved the recipe and will likely make for a family reunion. I plan on making a blue/blackberry cobbler next month. I will use this recipe as the base.

This was really freaking good. Having next to no experience baking anything besides a bunch of sugar cookies the dog wouldn't even eat, I think it turned out rather well. Next time I think I will make more of the batter to go along with it because it didn't seem to cover the whole bit of filling like I wanted. Other than that, very tasty with some vanilla bean ice cream and blueberry drizzle to top.

Added the cinnamon and nutmeg. Used blueberries and peaches, 4 cups. Lemon juice, a little sugar and water instead of oj. Brown sugar instead of white.

The taste was good, but it was way undercooked- this definitely would need at least an extra 30 minutes- at least in my oven :(

We love this!!  I made some changes only because I didn't have the OJ and fresh blueberries.  Having said that I used 1 1/2 cup frozen blueberries with 1/2 cup strawberries.  To make up for the extra liquid from the frozen fruit I added just a bit less then 1/4 c of Tapioca flour to thicken the juices.  I threw in some cinnamon  and brown sugar (1\2 and 1\2 white and brown) followed the rest of recipe for the topping. By gum you could smell this desert baking a block away!!!  The tast is the best so what ever your taste buds want go ahead and have fun experimenting........it surely will pay off!

I am rating this recipe on the cobbler topping alone.  It was far too cake-y for my liking.  I like a little bit more of a substantial cobbler top than this.  The underside, though cooked, tended to mush up in the fruit part.  I will say, however, that the taste was very nice.  Think I'll look for a different cobbler recipe.

holy moly...  delicious. I added some cinnamon because I love cinnamon. I was thinking the batter wouldn't be enough but it ended up fluffing  up and covering the berries perfectly.

This doesn't seem like a cobbler to me. It was pretty good. I used the juice of 1 lemon instead of orange juice and increased the topping by 1/2. It was too much topping so I would stick with the original recipe. A cobbler to me is a biscuit topping. This was more cake like, no doubt because of the egg.  We've enjoyed it with homemade cinnamon ice cream but don't think I would make again

Super easy recipe to follow! I always follow the recipe exactly the first time I use it and it came out just right! May try some of the other suggestions next time, like lemon zest and/or cinnamon.

I made this yesterday and after reading almost every review on this recipe, thought this was going to be something out of this world. Mine turned out like blueberries and strawberries mixed, with a lot of bland bisquik on the top. I do have a sweet tooth, and I did read that the top was like a sugar cookie mix, but with all the five stars, I was disappointed. I did double the top, like some suggested so maybe that was too much dough for me. I will have to keep looking for the ultimate cobbler recipe, which after seeing my email today, the peach dessert looks delicious!! This one was easy to make though so it would be a quick dessert in a rush.

The orange juice was a nice addition to this blueberry cobbler.  I changed up the flour, salt and baking powder to simply 2/3 cups of self-rising flour.  Sprinkled a little of cinnamon sugar over the topping.  The only downside for me was that baking at 375° made the topping a little too dark.  Next time I'll cut the temp down to 350°.

I made this for dessert for a casual family dinner with some neighbors and there were no leftovers! I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of adding some cinnamon as per the video demo. SO EASY. I preped it ahead of time and left it in the fridge till I was ready to bake it. I served it with home made whipped cream and it was perfect!

The blueberry/orange mixture was too runny after cooking. 
I used fresh blueberries. I believe it should of had some flour or tapioca to it to thicken it some.  It wasn't even like syrup, it was too fluid.

This was really good! I'm only giving it 4 stars because I doubled the recipie for the topping otherwise I wouldn't have had much coverage.  Other than that I didn't change a thing.

This is a very fine recipe.  I generally prefer a less cakey topping, but this is a nice alternative.  I did cut back on the amount of sugar considerably, but I always do.  It's about the berries, not the sweet....   ;-]

This is a really good base recipe.  I didn't have oj so I used craneberry juice. My berries were really fresh and sweet so i didn't use all the sugar suggested. 
I also read other reviews and added a dash of cinn AND a bit of a crisp crumb mixture on top. Some reviewers said it doesn't make enough topping...I don't think it is supposed to have a lot of topping but that is a personal preference. 

Delicious!!

I only had 2 cups of blueberries, so the third cup I used dried cherries. And added cinnamon to the topping batter.... absolutely delicious.

yummy - added 1/4 t soda for my high elevation. otherwise followed recipe exactly.  The top got brown at 25 minutes, so i took it out of the oven but it wasn't cooked through. Should have left it in the last 10 min & covered the top.

I had just picked tons of fresh blueberries and was looking for something to do with them, so I went looking for a cobbler recipe, even though I had never made a cobbler before. This recipe was very easy to make and I had all the ingredients already on hand. The cobbler it made was delicious, although I might have liked a bit more crust. It is not terribly sweet, so a bit of vanilla ice cream on top makes it even better.

Yum! So easy and very delicious. It is like a cakey type topping that absorbs the fruit, but in a yummy way. Great recipe to use up any fruit that is about to go bad. I used blueberry and strawberry, and it was so good. My skeptical husband who hates cobbler, was asking for seconds! I followed everything exactly and it tasted so good, we will definitely use this recipe again.

Really simple recipe that was a winner from the first making. I agree with some reviewers that the crust dough may be a little less than you need to cover it entirely - but worked out fine.

This has a good taste but not enough topping. Filling is a little on the runny side. i think this could move up to 5 stars with a little cornstarch added to the filling and maybe another half recipe of the topping. I also added a little cinnamon to the filling and the topping and diluted the orange juice. Otherwise yummy taste!

I doubled the topping and diluted the OJ per the previous comments. This was fantastic! I can't wait to try it with fresh peaches!

I'll give it 4 stars because I modified it slightly - followed others' lead and added a touch of cinnamon to the berry mixture.  I had to get rid of a roll of sugar cookie dough, so I added disks of sugar cookie dough to the last 15 minutes of baking.  Delicious berry mixture - will definitely make again!  I ended up using a total of 3 cups mixed blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries to use up fruit my kids said they were going to eat, but didn't.

Just sprinkled a little cinnamon over the blueberry mix and into the batter, used Sunny D instead of OJ (cuz it's what I had), and added 1 cup choped navel orange as I only had 2 cups of blueberries. I was suprised by how tasty this was.  I added a bit of homemade whipped cream, and our tastebuds landed on Cloud 9.  Made it the night before so I could serve it as breakfast with some eggs.  YUM

I used Costco's frozen mixed berry mix and it was just a little bit runny on the bottom but the flavors were excellent overall. I would just cut back a little on the orange juice next time. I also used baking stevia for 1/2 of the sugar and wheat flour for 1/2 of the flour required. Recommend both to make it healthier. I will definitely make this again!

This is the first time I have ever made or eaten cobbler before and it was very yummy.  I would only make a few modifications.  It was almost too sweet so next time I will use less than a half of a cup of sugar for the topping.  Also I put a sprinkle of cinnamon in the topping mixture and in with the blueberry mixture.  Cinnamon compliments the blueberries very well.  Other than that its a great recipe!

Loved it.  Bought Blueberries on Sale tonight.  Family wanted muffins, so I bought too many blueberries. They loved the Cobbler, with a scoop of ice cream.  Finished product came out a little runny, but delicious, and gave us some blueberry sauce for the top of the ice cream.  Rave reviews from the whole family.

Absolutely excellent, and a must have with vanilla ice cream. Another reviewer was right - cinnamon is a great addition. I saw this recipe a few weeks ago and have made it three times already!

Very very very easy! Great for beginners!  I made quite a few "adjustments", which is why I am a horrible baker and an excellent cook. There wasn't enough topping for me so I added a mix of; oats brown sugar, cinnamon, flour and butter.

This was OK but there was not nearly enough of the topping to cover the blueberries I had and the topping was a little bland.  I've made better cobblers so I doubt I will  use this again.

Very good.  Husband gobbled it all up, but he also prefers a more crumbly topping so I knocked off one star.  I loved it and wouldn't change a thing.  Super easy to make.

Yum - good!  My changes were 4 cups blueberries, 4 tablespoons sugar, limeaid (did not have orange juice), and generous but not measured amount of cinnamon to flour.  Might possibly add a bit of cornstarch to the berries next time.

This is really simple and yummy. I upped the blueberries to 5 cups just because I needed to use them up. I would probably up the amount of topping next time to accommodate the increased base, but that is no reflection on this yummy dessert, just a reflection on my bad planning! :) Very simple and quick to make, if you don't have a lot of time to put anything together. It can cook in the oven while you eat dinner.

This was pretty good.  As my husband said, "I think this is as good as blueberry cobbler can get".  It was easy and good, but missing something...perhaps I'll mix in another type of fruit next time.

This should have been titled "orange blueberry cake".  The orange flavor is very prevalent in the cobbler and overpowers the blueberries.  In addition, the topping is really more like a cake than a cobbler.   There also isn't enough salt in this recipe, so the topping is very bland.   A guest of mine surprised me with a peach cobbler on the night I was serving this cobbler.  The peach cobbler was so much better - crisper topping, salty sweet.... I'll be looking for that recipe on epicurious.  If this recipe was titled "orange blueberry cake" I would have rated it 4 stars.

This recipe was quite yummy. I made the modification of adding freshly chopped mint to the blueberry mixture. It added some extra pop to the sweetness of the fruit mixture. Also, I agree with some of the other reviewers that the crust portion barely covers the blueberry mixture. I'll try increasing it by half the next time I give this a whirl. Overall a really yummy summertime dessert. Served with freshly whipped cream (with a dash of honey and lemon oil). Mmmmm.

Made this last night.  We thought it was delicious!  I added an extra cup of blueberries because we have tons.  I also used an extra tablespoon of sugar.  I used my Kitchenaid mixer to make the batter.  After I made it, I carefully placed in in the corner of a 1 gallon ziplock bag.  Then clipped off the corner and "piped" the batter on top.  This was a very easy way to get the batter evenly spread on top.  Great recipe.  Will make again, but would like to reduce the butter in the batter to reduce the calories.  Give it a try.

This recipe was amazing! I followed another reviewer's suggestion and put a streusel topping on top of the whole thing before baking. It was the perfect amount of crunch and sweet--oh and nice and buttery too!

I wish I'd read reviews before going through with this recipe. I would have liked to add brown sugar instead of white sugar to the blueberries as someone suggested, and cinnamon would have been nice. Nonetheless, the cobbler turned out very nicely. I would have liked more crust, but that's more or less my fault for not making more. I love the addition of the orange juice to the blueberries; the cobbler was greatly enjoyed by all who ate it.

I made this yesterday, and increased the blueberries to 4 cups fresh & 1 cup frozen, also mixed them with 1/4 cup sugar and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I also added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon to the batter for the topping. I probably should have kept the berries at 4 cups, or maybe 3 1/2 cups. The ratio of berries to topping wasn't even, there were too many berries. Still this has an excellent flavor and the topping is yummy. I just wish I hadn't used so many berries! Will make again and maybe double the batter for the topping?

This is such an easy recipe!  I did have to add a streusel topping.  It was just 2 TBS flour, 5 TBS brown sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 2 TBS butter.  It was really good!

I've made this cobbler twice now and it's been wonderful both times! The first time I used fresh blueberries and peaches, the second, in the interest of time, i used only canned peaches and it was still fabulous.    Quick and easy for the "un-seasoned" baker :)

Absolutely divine. The only changes I made were to add cinnamon to both the topping and the berries (about a 1/2tsp to each) and to use half orange juice/half water as a couple of other reviews suggested. Delicious!

This had a wonderful flavor, not too sweet, not too tart and I liked the cakelike crust, however it was way too runny and took much longer to cook than listed. Next time I think I will omit the orange juice and add like a tablespoon of lemon juice instead and possibly a tablespoon of flour to the berry mixture to thicken it up.

This recipe wasn't what I expected.  The OJ made it a bit too tangy.  I think that it might be better a second time without the OJ.

This was delish. My hubby's customer has a organic blueberry farm and gave him tons and tons of fresh picked organic blueberries. They are fat too! This was my first blueberry cobbler b/c I usually don't eat blueberry stuff that tastes like store pie filling. But this was so yummy! I made 1 1/2 crust (except only one egg) and upped the blueberries to aoubt 5 cups (and it still didn't make a dent!). This was perfect, not too sweet, yet flavorful. The crust is not entirely cake-like, the bottom texture is, but the top layer was like a crisp cookie, sort of tasted like a sugar cookie.  I didn't double the butter, I actually used about 3Tbls. less, which I usually do anyways. I added a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg in both the berries and the cobbler. And I served with frozen cool whip free. I will definately make this again.

Tasty. Not exactly what comes to mind when I think of a cobbler, but pretty good. I made 1 1/2 the amount of crust as recommended, and will have to remember to add some cornstarch to the blueberries to thicken it up next time. I think I'll use the recipe for the crust to make a shortcake sometime, I think it'll be perfect for that.

This is so delicious!! I will make it again and again! One reviewer added 1 whole TBSP of cinnamon and THEN said it was just "OK".  Follow the recipe the first time- then tweak it according to taste.   Much better than blueberry pie which i found too sweet.  I followed the recipe except i used 4 cups blueberries which was perfect (1 very full quart size bag).  We picked them ourselves-even more satisfying and the berries were so tiny this year.

this was not the traditional cobbler recipe i was looking for but still pretty good. the topping was great but a little thick and the fuit was a bit runny. I've never made a cobbler before and this was very easy to make and just the right amount of sweet. will probably make again with a few changes. thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was great!  I only change a few things - I used 4 cups of frozen blueberries, 4 tbsp of sugar, a dash of lemon juice to flavor and i used a juice I had in the fridge because I didn't have any orange juice.  It tasted great!  This was the best cobbler I've ever had.

I thought this was one of the easiest and tastiest recipes for blueberry cobbler.  I did add cinnamon to the blueberries (just a sprinkle) and about a half teaspoon to the dough.  I also forgot to add the vanilla (pregnant-no brain), and it was still good.  I also realized we had no oj, but I had limeade and figured what the heck.  I know it's more for the acidity than anything.  It was fantastic.  I think it kept it from being overpoweringly sweet.  It baked up nicely browned and beautiful.  I will definitely be making this many times.

This was very good. I threw in a few raspberries with the blueberries . I used water down lemon juice ( 50/50)- which gave it the tart taste I like. I doubled the biscuit part for better coverage. I added cinnamon, nutmeg and that was also very good!

Really tasty!!! Need to leave it in the oven a little longer to dry it out a bit more. If you let the top get NICE and brown - then you have it.

Fantastic!  I think we could have eaten it all in one sitting!  Much like another reviewer, I also let my berries sit for several minutes after I sprinkled on the cornstarch.  Overall - fabulous!

Super yummy!  It is definitely best eaten a few hours after coming out of the oven ... the tart berries, crispy topping & vanilla ice cream are delectable.  Of course, it's very good the next day too -- you just lose the crispy topping due to covering.  Definitely one to try if you like blueberries!

A delicious desert for Fourth of July, though it was a little more like a cake instead of a cobbler. Not too sweet, very pleasant flavor. I made no modifications to this recipe and my family devoured it within minutes.

The topping on this cobbler was not at all cobbler like but rather like a sugar cookie.

Super fast and easy to make plus it was really tasty!!! I don't like overly sweetened desserts so this was perfect for me. Next time I might even use just 2 tbs of sugar over the blueberries- I think that might be plenty. Also instead of using an 8x8 pan, I used a casserole dish- approx. 4 x 9 and that worked out well. I did end up having to cook it for 40 minutes but that may have been because I used frozen blueberries.  Will definitely make again!!!

I made this last night and it's find as is. Really no changes need to be made at all. It was good, not out of this world, but good. I'd make it again. Or try another similar recipe on this site - all are about the same for cobbler. Also it didn't make a whole lot of topping. Maybe that's for the better! :)

Fail proof recipe. We had dinner guests with only a 2 hour notice and I needed a dessert recipe that worked with what I had on hand. This did the trick. The only change I made was using frozen mixed berries (which I thawed before using) instead of fresh blueberries. Once thawed, they gave a little bit of extra liquid on their own, so I cut back on the liquid minutely (Remember: much of the liquid will evaporate out during baking). Baked up wonderfully and there wasn't a drop left!

Followed directions exactly and the top was getting brown but it was still jiggly in the middle.  Let it cook some more, but took it out before the top was ruined.  The dough was still uncooked in the middle and the inside was very runny.  Next time I would add a thickening agent to the berries (flour or corn starch) and either cook at a lower temp or cover the dish with foil when the top was brown enough.  The taste was good, though a little sweet.  Some spices would help (cinnamon, lemon juice...)

I used frozen blueberries, which were more affordable, but were not good once it was baked (They were too hard.). The crust was delicious, but loaded with too many calories and too much fat for my liking (a whole stick of butter for a small crust).

this recipe turned out really good! in fact it was fantastic and was a big hit. i used frozen blueberrys so it turned out to be a little bit wet on the bottom. the only thing i would have done different is probably wash and drain the blueberrys.

Although the filling is tasty (and not too sweet), the topping is more like a sugar cookie than a biscuit-like cobbler. It was nice to try something different for a change- and the sugar cookie topping is good- I'll stick with my fluffy biscuit-cobbler topping.

This was just ok to me. It did not have much flavor. I much prefer a crisp topping made with oatmeal and brown sugar. I won't be making this again.

"Best Ever" is a bit of a stretch for this - it isn't bad, my 4 yr old loves it, but I don't particularly care for it - the orange juice really overpowers.  Won't make again.

This was the first time I ever made a cobbler.  I was searching high and low for recipes and after reading suggestions and reviews for many of them this is the one I chose to try.  I'm gladd I did!  This will be the one and only recipe for blueberry cobbler that I'll use!  I did the suggestions of nutmeg, cinnamon, and cornstarch.  I used the lemon juice suggestion since I didn't have any orange juice on hand.  The next time I make it I'm going to try the orange juice.  Thank you so much Jen for sharing this recipe with everyone!

The topping is excellent! The blueberry bottom could do with a little more sugar, less orange juice, and a little cinnamon.  Will definitely make again using those small changes.

This was very good.  I used fresh blueberries and should have followed the previous suggestion to add corn starch as it was a little "soupy" on the bottom.  I served it with vanilla ice cream as well, and it was delicious.

This rocks my socks. I added a 1/2 tsp cinammon to the batter and 1/2 tsp to the blueberry mix as well as previously mentioned.  Ice cream on top is a must!  The topping is excellent!

Oh My...What a spectacular dessert! We used handpicked blueberries and served with vanilla ice cream. Between my husband, daughter and myself, we almost polished the entire pan off! I can't wait to use this recipe every year when we pick our own fruit!

OMG so good!! I made this with fresh in season NJ blueberries.  Followed recipe exactly and it was perfect.  Served it about 5 hours after coming out  of oven and was not runny at all. The best with vanilla ice cream

Good flavor for the berries..but the topping lacks something...like a little more crisp or bite. Next time I will make this but top it with some extra goodies.

Great homemade dessert & very easy!  My 3 & 5 yr old daughters had a great time helping with this recipe.  We used frozen blueberries and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the topping batter.  Also, we took it out of the oven a few mins early.  Turned out fantastic- Didn't have any leftovers!

Picked blueberries today at a nearby farm, so this was a very FRESH cobbler! Followed recipe exactly (except used half the butter), and it was great. The OJ does not over-power - so no need to worry about that, but I bet that grape juice tastes great w/ it too (hmm...maybe I'll try that next time). Thanks!

Rave reviews from the crowd. My husband likes his blueberries a little tart so he felt this was a little too sweet. But matched it with some vanilla ice cream and he was a believer too. Would definitely make this again.

I thought this recipe was ok. After reading the reviews i decided to up the sugar (I am glad i did) and not use cornstarch because i was using fresh, not frozen berries. My cobbler set up well so i think it's safe to assume that if you use fresh berries, then no cornstarch is needed, and if you use frozen, i would add it. My only complaint is that my cobbler was undercooked in the middle even though i cooked it as directed... so make sure you check the middle really well before you pull it out. Overall, good recipe... not great.... but good.

Took the suggestions of others and added more sugar and corn starch. To be honest, I think it could use even more. That said, this was good, especially warm with vanilla ice cream.

I admittedly used the base of this recipe as a jumping off point. I usually make my cobbler dough more biscuit-y and less sweet, but I decided to give it a shot. I used 4 different berries and peaches, tossing them with a little flour, honey and turbinado sugar. After pouring that in the pan, I followed the recipe directly. We topped the cobbler with quark (kind of a cross between yogurt and sour cream) and it was tasty, but I thought the topping was too sweet. My boyfriend, however, pronounces it "delicious" and keeps clapping - though that could just be the football. It's definitely worth a try - simple, easy and smells heavenly coming out of the oven.

Next time I would make more topping.  I didn't have orange juice, so I used 1 TB of Lemon and 1/3 cup cranberry.  Next time I would use a sweeter juice.  
But it was delicious!!!

I don't eat cobblers, but my hubby loves them so I made this for him and he loved it!  The only thing I did differently was that I saved a few blueberries and dotted them on top before I cooked it.  
I'm giving it 5 STARS based on hubby's response!

This dessert was simple and tasty.  I used a frozen 4 berry combination (strawberries, blue berries, blackberries, and raspberries) it was great. I will try again in summer with fresh berries.

This was really good.  The blueberries were the perfect balance of tart and sweet.  The orange juice really added a great flavor to the berries.  I actually used frozen blueberries and used the juice that was leftover to make a blueberry sauce that I put on the cobbler.  I just put the juice on medium heat and added sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, and a little flour and drained it and it tasted very good on the cobbler.

We live in Texas and blueberries are grown in our town so it helped that they were some of the best blueberries we have ever tasted.  Will definitely try the added streusel topping next time-it seemed to need that extra crust.  The subtle citrus flavor was wonderful!
