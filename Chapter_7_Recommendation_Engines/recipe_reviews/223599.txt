Perfection! I was always a little nervous of pie crust but this came out perfect the first time I made it! Super flaky and light! This is absolutely my "go to" crust for ever and always! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

So my thoughts on the recipe is that it is not that great but I did not give it one star because it may be because of a few things. The dough needs to be really thin I think for it to be "light and flaky". I like a thicker dough so one recipe was enough for just the bottom of my 9 pie pan. Then I did another for the top pattern. Anyhow when baked it was ediable but definately not award winning. I will try to thin out the crust and then update this review but those do not want a paper thin crust this is not quite the one to use.

I added a little sugar to the pastry due to the high salt level, perfection!

The basic ingredients are fine, just a couple things I find really important for crusts.  Add the water a little bit at a time, and most importantly, ice the water.  The colder it is as you add it, the better the crust.

If you like a thick crust, like me, you can use butter instead of shortaning.

I've been using this recipe for about 5-6 years now it's never let me down. It works well with either lard or shortening. I let it rest on the counter covered for about an hour then roll it out or put it in the fridge for an hour then on the counter until it reaches room temperature, covered in suran wrap.

Substituted butter for shortening, and split the salt called for with sugar, since it was for a sweet recipe. Turned out perfect!

This is a great pie crust if you add a tablespoon  of real butter to it.  Make sure the water is iced cold and you will get a flakier crust.

Crust came out perfect! Did not use half a cup, though. Just a bit less.

Super easy to make, also easy to roll out and put into the pie pan (that's where I usually have dough breaking). It was the right amount for me for a 9" pie, easily rolled out two 11" circles. The crust thickens a bit more during baking. I thought it the perfect thickness. I used 1/2 cup of shortening, and I think it is just the right amount of flaky; not too much either. So overall, super happy :)
