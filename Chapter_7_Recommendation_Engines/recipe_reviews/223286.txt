Sorry I hate to give this such a low rating but, I made this pie and I took it to work.  2 people tried it and came to tell me that it wasn't very good.  Unfortunately, the flour did not thicken the juice from the berries enough and it was very watery.

Everyone loved this pie..it was sweet tart and great with ice cream..I added extra berries and didn't add extra flour so it was a bit runny, my mistake. The next day though it was completely set up..Thanks for an easy a wonderful dessert...

YUMMY pie! I used ready-to-go shortcrust pastry out of the freezer, and after reading the other reviews I used 1/2 cup of flour (not 3 Tbs). Turned out great, family love it!
