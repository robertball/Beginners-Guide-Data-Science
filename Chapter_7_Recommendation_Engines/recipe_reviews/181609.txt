This turned out so well! I thought I had lemongrass and red chile pepper at home but I did not but I did have a red curry paste which I added with the cocunut milk and it added just the right touch of flavor. I also used Pillsbury cresent rolls for the pastry and they turned out a lot larger than the small pouches intended for this recipe. The curry part was also great curry recipe on its own. The only change I would I would have made for a curry is addding a whole can of coconut milk for a more liquid curry over rice. But it makes sense to have a dryer consistency if you're going to wrap it in a pastry and bake it.

I love the idea that they are baked and you can always add additional seasonings to taste

These were very very good. I made these with and without chicken and all versions were just fabulous.

To keep pastry ends together dip a finger in water and smear it on the edge and press the two pastry layers together. If you are doing a long roll fold over one edge onto the filling apply a bit of water and fold the other edge over the dampened edge. Then pierce gently diagonally with fork tines to seal. After baking immediately cut long roll into serving sizes. However leaving one end slightly open will help the built-up steam escape out of the puff.

Very tasty and a unique appetizer! Brought to Easter and everyone loved them. The puff pastry isn't the easiest thing to work with- before cooking they looked beautiful then as soon as they started cooking they opened up. I found that when they were cooling I was able to push the folds back down no problem. The trick with puffed pastry is keeping it cold while you're working with it (and water patches up holes). Thank you! Will be making this again! Does take some time but worth it (especially if you're only in charge of appetizers!)

Brought these to a potluck and every one loved them! Because of the amount of time and energy I broke it up into a two day process. Night one I made the curry (easy) and filled the puff pastries up with them. Don't forget to make sure the pastry is thawed when working with it. I refrigerated over night. Night two after coming home from work I just threw them in the oven. It made about 18. The key is to serve at room temp. as the recipe states. I kept tasting fresh out the oven and they were not amazing. But after cooling they were great! I recommend plenty of salt it was missing a little something for me because I love strong flavored curries - I would probably add curry paste too next time. Definitely 5 stars based on the reaction I got. Another added bonus - without the chicken these are great VEGAN snacks!

These took a while to make make but they were SO worth it! I had a little left over so I just put it over rice. I will be making this dish more often! Great for parties. My only complaint was I had trouble keeping the pastry puffs together at the tips.

WOW these puffs were amazing much better than samosas I've had at Indian restaurants!! I didn't have lemongrass or coconut milk so I added zest of one lemon fresh ginger fresh garlic and a handful of shredded coconut. I ended up using much more than a half cup of milk and added peas. I will definitely be making this again!

They were good but needed a little kick. Next time I will try substituting green apples for some or all of the potatoes.

This has been our favorite recipe for a few years now. It is so good that we usually can't wait for the puffs to finish baking so we end up eating the leftover filling straight from the pan as we wait for the puffs. We love to make this for our friends and family when we have get togethers and they are always a big hit. This is usually the only time we make them because they do take a bit of time and effort. When we first started making them we had problems with the puffs coming open while baking them but now that we have had enough practice we are better at forming the puffs so they won't come apart. My advice for that is use enough water and make sure to squish the corners of the pastry together a bit if you can. They also come apart if you overfill them.

For the amount of time it took to prep these and bake them they were just ok. The only ingredient I didn't add was the lemongrass because I couldn't find it. Otherwise followed the recipe completely. As another review said they were missing something. We found them to be quite bland. Despite using water to dampen the sides of the pastry puff so it would stick together about 1/2 of the puffs came apart while baking. I also ended up with a significant amount of left-over filling which I haven't decided what to with yet....I would not make this again.

This Recipe was excellent!!! My family is from south America and this kind of dish has that same taste that i grew up eating! the recipe called for alot of coconut milk so that i could get the same consistency as the video. I didnt have Lemon grass so i grated a little bit of lemon zest mixed with ginger. Because i didnt stir properly i could taste the lemon and ginger but it added a surprisingly pleasant spark. I also made my puff pastry from scratch and messed it up but even with that all i can say is YUM! My husband and other relatives loved it and requested that i make more! I can't wait to try it all again! By the way this was my first time making the recipe and i followed as is with the exception of the Lemon grass.

This is a great recipe. I've made it a bunch of times. I usually buy extra puff pastry and make a double batch of the chicken as it's a bit of work. That way when we have company in the following weeks they think I'm a super hostess when I slop some onto the pastry and pop it into the oven. It's best with a chutney like mango; if out of that use a sweet Thai chilli sauce.

Very tasty and a hit at the party I took them to. Not too spicy and they are light.
