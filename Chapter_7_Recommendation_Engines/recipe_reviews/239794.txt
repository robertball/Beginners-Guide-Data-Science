I make this in regular sized muffin tins with mini chocolate chips added to the cheesecake. Best to beat the cream cheese first, until it gets really light and creamy, then add other ingredients. This really makes a huge difference in the outcome.

I added 1/2 teaspoon of Vanilla and I piped it into the mini cupcake tins lined with papers.  I tried spooning it in, very messy.  I don't have a piping bag either, I used a ziplock with a hole in the corner.

I made this with regular sized Oreos and cupcake liners, not the minis, and added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla. This was simple to make and is a family favorite. Next time I will add a small amount of chocolate chips.

Great last minute deserts!  So easy to put together. Lots of alternative toppings , use your imagination, fruits, chocolate, toppings(wiped cream, candy, hot fudge, butterscotch …) the cheesecake has a nice not too sweet taste.  I think you’ll enjoy this little jewel.

I made this but with a change, felt that for a mini Oreo cheesecake there wasn’t enough Oreos. I added crushed oreo cookies to the cream cheese mixture.

I used this recipe twice, once followed and did the Oreo. But this time I used it for a whole cake. It had to stay in the oven a little longer but it turned out great. Didn't change the recipe at all. I will definitely use this again.

These turned out very well.  Perhaps my idea of a "mini-muffin cup" is different than other people's, but an Oreo won't fit into one of what I consider to be "mini".  I crushed the Oreos and put them crumbs in the bottom and it worked just fine though.  Other than cutting the recipe in half, I made no other changes and these were great!
What a lifesaver!  My daughter wanted cherry cheesecake and Oreo cheesecake for her birthday tomorrow.  I made each of those.  The Oreo isn't setting up and a fridge avalanche destroyed the cherry one.  So I hurried and whipped up some of these and everyone can just add Oreos or cherries as they see fit.
