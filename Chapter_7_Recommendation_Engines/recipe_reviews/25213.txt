I found this bread to be very good.  However, I did make some changes.  I used 2 cups of all-purpose white flour + 1 cup of whole wheat flour.  I also used 1 tsp. of garlic powder instead of the chopped garlic, and I used dried rosemary rather than fresh.  My husband and I both loved this bread.  It was so simple and turned out wonderfully.  I will definitely make it again.

I've made this focaccia many times, and it's one of my family's favorites.  One variation that I've found helps to give it more flavor is to sprinkle the top with coarse kosher salt (in addition to the rosemary leaves).  It makes the top nice and crunchy, as well as more flavorful.

Beautiful and delicious bread, which I used for "Gourmet Chicken Sandwiches," also from this site. For a little more flavor and pizazz, after brushing the top with olive oil, I sprinkled it with coarse salt, freshly ground pepper, shredded Parmegiano Reggiano and, finally, with fresh rosemary. The bread was SO good, but not quite as thick as I would have liked for sandwiches, so in the future I will probably bake this in a 7X11" pan rather than the 9x13."

Very good and very easy.  I added about 2 teaspoons of sugar to the bread machine pan to make sure the yeast could do its job, and you could not taste it in the finished product.  I also used 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of Italian Seasoning and 2 teaspoons of dried rosemary in the bread itself.  I also sprinkled kosher salt over the top of the bread along with the rosemary before putting it in the oven.  Couldn't get my 11 year old daughter to try this, but that just meant more for us!  My husband commented on how good it was but he didn't care for the salt on top so the next time I make this I may skip it, even though *I* really liked it with the salt!  I'd also like to try using this for pizza crust... would be yummy!

This recipe is really wonderful!!  I will say that I did increase the salt for this recipe to 3/4 teaspoon.  When I prepare the focaccia with the rosemary and olive oil, I also add kosher salt before baking.  Although the recipe doesn't call for it, I do grease the cookie sheet with olive oil.  I serve this with a small dish of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  It is excellent!  My Italian Father LOVES this:). Thanks for a great recipe!!

Thanks for sharing this recipe. This is my first time trying this recipe and my focaccia turned out perfect - although it was my bread machine that did everything. I did make a few changes as suggested by others. Firstly I add warm water, 2 tablespoons sugar & 1.5 teaspoons dried active yeast into the baking pan and leave for 10 mins in the bread machine.Then I added 3 cups bread flour, 6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, 1.5 teaspoons garlic powder, 1 teaspoons italian herbs , 2 teaspoons dried rosemary & 1.5 teaspoons salt. Used basic bread setting and voila, 4 hours later, freshly baked focacia. Next round I will try with fresh garlic and fresh rosemary.

This bread turned out horrible.  I made it according to instructions, but must have done something wrong, I don't know what.  The bread was hard as nails on the top, it totally stuck to the pan, and it was basically tasteless.

This is a GREAT recipe.  I tried one other yesterday, and it was not very good, very dry, and not much flavor.   On the other hand this one is very nice, I used a bit more garlic and did add some kosher salt to the topping, it was far and above the other one, is now all gone!!!  Did not use the bread machine, but put everything in the Kitchenaid mixer and kneaded it that way for about 5 min.  Also used Spelt flour, since I have a gluten intolerant kid, but she can have Spelt.   Was really GREAT. Will surely make again.

The ratio of ingredients in this recipes is flawless. I have a slightly ancient bread maker, and even so this bread turned out fantastic. The first time I made this, it was way too bland. The second time, I added 1 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning blend, and 1/4 tsp onion powder. I also baked it on stoneware and it came out beautifully in 25 minutes. Once it was finished, I brushed butter on top, sprinkled kosher salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning blend over it, and put under my broiler on low for 2 minutes. This made a wonderful crust on top. Used a pizza cutter to make squares for serving.

I think there's a step missing in this recipe!  The dough needs to have a second rising after it comes out of the bread machine and before it's dimpled.  Trust me!  I thought it sounded odd, but followed the directions to the letter and it failed miserably.  The flavour was good, but really heavy dough and no browning.   Maybe that is why the writer suggests you cover with plastic wrap while waiting for the oven to preheat???  Also recipe calls for 1 Tbsp of rosemary in dough, and then sprinkle with "remaining" rosemary???  I will try this one again, allowing the dough to rise before baking and will likely be back to rate it a 5 star as I think that was the only problem.

The overall taste of the bread was good although the outside was a little dry.  I 
think I try cooking it at a higher temp for a shorter period the next time.  I would also try 
putting more olive oil on the outside.

I did what some of the others like I add 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of rosemary in the bread. I sprinkled kosher salt and italian seasoning and brushed olive oil on top. Although, next time I will put the italian seasoning in the bread. I put a little bit of parmesan but I don't like how it gets a burned a bit if it's exposed to the heat. I made this twice and the first time, right after I spread the bread mixture in the 13x9 pan , I baked it and it was a little hard but the second time, I let it rise again about in the 13x9 pan for 1 hour and then, baked it and it came out soft and fluffy. I really loved the second one the best (I didn't put the parmesan this time around.) I'm using it to make focaccia bread stuffing.

This was the most tasteless focaccia I've ever had. I used fresh rosemary from my own garden so the fragrance while it was cooking was marvelous - what a disappointment when it was sampled!

Four of us ate the whole thing with our spaghetti last night!  I made the recipe as recommended except that on the top I brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with italian seasoning and parmesan cheese.  This was also really easy to make!

I am assuming I did something wrong. For me the texture was really dry. The taste was fine but the texture not soft and tasty like I wanted. Have to try one more time and see what happens. Thanks.

Very versatile.  I made several times.  I do it different ways: topped with carmelized onions and goat cheese; brie and poached pears, roasted garlic and blue cheese or plain and serve with flavored oils.

This turned out AWESOME!  I didn't have fresh rosemary.  So I used the same amount of dried, crushed rosemary, and I doubled the garlic.  Served it warm with olive oil and fresh pepper for dipping!  Addictive!  I used the leftovers to make sandwiches today.  Most delicious sandwich I've ever eaten!  I'll make this again and again!

Very good recipe, could definitely use kosher salt sprinkled on top or more salt in the recipe, I cut the olive oil in half and used 2 cups of bread flour and 1 cup of whole wheat, still very good. Be sure to grease the pan before baking! This is one I will be making again and again for sure

Great recipe, will definitely do again.  I made some minor changes: substituted 1 tsp dried rosemary for fresh, added 1 tbs sugar to feed the yeast and used half bread flour and half whole wheat.  I put the dough on an oiled breadstone and like some other reviewers put it on the middle shelf of a cold oven with shallow pan of hot water on the bottom shelf.  I let it rise for 30 minutes then turned the oven to 375 and baked it for 25 minutes

This recipe was really easy and so good.  I did make a couple of changes.  After the bread machine was done making the dough, I allowed it to rise for 30 minutes before placing it in the oven.  I also topped it with grated parmesan.  I highly recommend trying it!  It's a keeper!

Really good focaccia!  I added 1 tspn garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, approx 3/4 tspn salt and added extra fresh rosemary that I chopped very fine.  Once dough was ready from bread machine, I put on my baking stone (cold) and topped with mixture of EVOO, fresh rosemary, garlic powder, sea salt and fresh ground pepper.  I put stone into cold oven while preheating - took about 20 mins from when I started oven to finish baking.  Will definitely make again!

I, and my family, really enjoyed this bread. It was very flavorful and a real success! I added a touch more herbs (sage and basil) to the rosemary and it took this modification well. I've posted a photo as it ended up being a very good looking bread. Thank you for sharing this very easy and tasty recipe.

AMAZING! This is a very "forgiving" recipe that you can really play around with!! I added everything except the flour to the bread machine pan & mixed it & let it rest (about 5 minutes)  then added the flour and popped it in the machine.  I used all-purpose flour, increased the salt to 1 tsp., added a pinch of sugar,  increased the warm water to 1 1/4 cups and added in some oregano, marjoram & basil.   I let it rest for about 30 minutes with the plastic wrap and then used brushcetta flavored olive oil over top (and on bottom of pizza pan).  Sprinkled extra herbs, garlic salt & parmesan cheese over top and baked.  It was perfect in 15 minutes rather than (20-25).  After removing from the oven, I cut the focaccia into thick strips and placed them on my HOT (400 degree) pizza stone (sitting out on a cutting board, not back in the oven) for a few minutes to crisp up the bottoms----PERFECTION!!!!.  This came out better than I could have imagined.    I WILL be making this weekly!  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe (my new favorite recipe)!!!

Pretty good.  I topped mine with just halved kalamata olives, and liberally brushed it with olive oil both on the pan and on top before I baked it.

I absolutely LOVED this bread!  Thanks for sharing this.  I think you could add a variety of herbs and spices but, I thought it was fabulous just the way it was (I did, however, sprinkle the top with kosher salt as one reader mentioned).

Great new fav at my home. I used three cups of whole wheat flour, a couple tablespoons more water and put this in an 11 x 14 pan.

This is a great recipe. I think, as one reviewer suggested, that the recipe intends for you to use the pizza dough cycle on the bread machine, then press into pan and allow to rise before baking. The suggestion of adding a little seasalt on top with the olive oil and rosemary prior to baking is a good addition!

5 stars all the way! This was amazing bread! Only thing I did different was to give it a good 30 minutes rise time once out of the machine as getting it out and stretching it caused the bread to go flat. I just laid plastic wrap over it and microwaved a kitchen towel for about 20 sec. to heat it up and help warm the bread. Not sure if it was necessary but my bread did rise nicely. This was a home run for me. Can't wait to try other herbs and veges. Update...I made a plain version of this (minus herbs and garlic) and placed the dough in a regular loaf pan, let raise about 25 minutes and baked at 375 for 25 minutes. Husband said it was my best loaf of bread yet! This recipe is versatile!

This was wonderful!! I divvied up the dough into 8 mini loaf pans, allowed to rise a second time, and baked about 18 minutes. Perfect size for sandwiches, with a nice crust all around. Definitely sprinkle the top with kosher salt.

This recipe was delicious and super easy with the help of the breadmaker! I added fresh herbs to the dough from my garden (basil, rosemary, and a couple leaves of oregano) and found that it gave the bread a delicious flavor. Also, I spread the dough out onto a 9x13 pan and found it provided a great shape for easy sandwich making later. Yum!

This is so great! I took people's suggestions of using wheat flour with regular flour. I usually make this dough once a week - mostly for bread but also for pizza and calzones. If you really like rosemary, I would suggest adding a little more than the recipe asks for but the recipes itself is great as is. I'm constantly checking out other people's suggestions and trying them out - so far so good :)

I made few changes, but this was quite tasty.  I divided the dough in half, and let it rise again before baking it in 2 pie pan.  I used extra fresh chopped garlic, some dried oregano and basil, and a little more olive oil than the recipe called for.  I added a couple tablespoons worth of sugar to feed the yeast.  The results were great!  I made it again with out adding sugar, and it did not rise as well without it.

Oh yum, this was so good! I have made a few focaccia recipes from the site and they are just way too soft. This was more dense and closer to what I know as focaccia bread. It was so super easy in my bread machine too. I have a Zojirushi, if that helps. I used the dough cycle as suggested. My only change was using 1/3 of the suggested rosemary. I had fresh that I dried, which I find stronger tasting. I very finely minced it with a knife to spread throughout. I sprayed a little olive oil on a piece of parchment and spread it out on that on a sheet pan. When I did the topping, after adding 1 Tblsp of olive oil it seemed like enough so that is what I used. I added about 1/4 teaspoon approximately of salt to the 1/2 teaspoon of rosemary as I minced it, for the top, and then lastly sprinkled about 2 Tablespoons of finely grated parmesan on it before baking. It took 24 minutes to finish baking. TY

This is a spectacular bread recipe! My whole life I've been intimidated by yeast... but NO LONGER! I read the reviews & heeded some advice. This is what my final recipe looked like:
1c. warm water, 3 T. olive oil, 3 c. all-purpose flour, 3/4 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. minced fresh garlic, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 2 tsp. dried rosemary, 1 tsp. Italian seasoning, 1 T. sugar, 2 1/4 tsp. yeast. Put into my bread machine according to the mfgr recommendations, used the dough setting. Heated the oven to 400. Shaped the dough into a flat round on a metal pizza pan. Used a wooden spoon handle to poke holes throughout the dough. Brushed 2 T. olive oil over the top, sprinkled another 1T. of dried crushed rosemary on top, sprinkled coarse ground sea salt on top & shredded a little bit of stinky cheese (something with Italian flare) on top of that. Baked for 25 minutes. Cut it into wedges and enjoyed the HECK outta it!!! It is so lusciously good! Try it, you'll love it!

I found this recipe this morning and printed it and already made it for our lunch. Wonderful recipe but we don't like rosemary so I used a little coarse salt and some Asiago cheese on top. It has a little to much raw garlic  taste so next time I will use just a little garlic powder but I definetly will make it again. Thank you for the recipe.

Wow!  This tastes great and is so easy. I made it to go with the "Gourmet Chicken Sandwich" on this site. The dough came out perfect in the bread maker and went easily into the 13x9 inch pan.  In addition to olive oil and rosemary (which by the way, I used dried because I didn't have any fresh), I sprinkled kosher salt and parmesan cheese on top. I will definitely make this again.  So quick and easy.  Am looking forward to serving it with a little olive oil and rosemary as a quick appetizer some time.

Pretty good recipe, but I think I might tweak with the ingredients to see if it improves the texture or taste.

Not bad for a first attempt!

This is a fantastic and easy bread.  The entire family loved it and we dipped it in olive oil with cracked pepper.  Next time I'll put salt on top to add a little more flavor, but it was already fantastic.

Excellent.  Easy to make and shape, tasted wonderful.  Served with olive oil and italian herbs as a dip for a party to rave reviews.

We've been baking on our gas grill this summer and this recipe turned out quite well.  I reduced the heat by 50 degrees and baked for the full time specified.

this was  great recipe but I did change a couple things from other recipes I have. the dough was very dry when it was mixing in the machine so I added another 1/4 cup water. When I put the loaf in the oven I put it on the middle rack and a pan with hot water on the bottom rack. I let it sit in the cold oven for 25 minutes, then turned the oven on and let it bake for about 30 minutes. AFter 25, keep an eye on it.
My loaf was HUGE! size of a pizza pan. Everyone loved it!! I'll post a picture of it.

This was pretty good but after I tried it I tried a more popular traditional focaccia recipe from this site and just put those ingredients in my bread machine and it came out beautifully.  I don't think I'd use this recipe again, the texture was a little off but the flavor was great, although I'd prefer a little more seasoning.  Used it to make grilled vegetable sandwiches which tasted great!

My family loved this bread recipe. Very easy to make. I did sprinkle Kosher salt on top before baking. Made this 2 days in a row, couldn't get enough! Second day I add more salt then I did the first day.

I've made a lot of homemade bread but my mom declared this her favorite! I add extra garlic and sometimes switch out some of the rosemary (not a big fan) for basil. My only tip would be wait to start pre-heating the oven until the bread is in the pan so that it has time to rise before baking. Also as others have recommended a sprinkle of kosher/sea salt on top really adds to it.

My husband doesn't like rosemary so I substituted Italian Seasoning (blend of dried herbs).  I also used regular flour plus 3 Tbs of gluten in lieu of bread flour.  Before baking, I brushed the top with olive oil and sprinkled with parmesan and kosher salt.  Delicious!  Especially dipped in oil and balsamic!

Used this to make pizza crust and it worked like a charm! Made exactly as written, except I omitted the rosemary and did have to add a little extra water to the dough while it was mixing. I can't wait to try this as focaccia! Thanks for sharing. :)

I added a couple of tablespoons of sugar with the yeast (the second time i made this recipe) and found i got a bit more rise out of it.  

Fresh herbs make this, I added a bit of fresh oregano to mine, topped it with a bit of olive oil and rosemary (as described), some cracked sea salt and shredded parmesan...freaking awesome! 

(have made it 3x now...no issues, just have to be sure it rises once before you start the shaping process, and it shapes better if you let it rest for about 5-10 mins after the 2nd kneading is done)

Next time i'm going to spike the top with roasted garlic cloves as well. I've no doubt it will be just as good as the first few times.  Thanks so much.  

PS...this was the first recipe i tried with a bread machine and it worked, so it has encouraged me to try more!

This recipe is perfect just the way it is!  As a variation I did top with parmesan cheese, but it's not needed.  YUMMY:)

So good!  I subbed 1/2 tsp onion powder for the rosemary (didn't have any), used 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp sugar for a terrific flavor! Sprinkled 1/2 cup pizza cheese on top after brushing with olive oil. All else remained the same. Used this to make a turkey BLT sandwich- TO DIE FOR!!!

I agree with others that this bread NEEDS to rise a second time.  Maybe the recipe writer's bread machine has a dough cycle that rises twice.  Anyway, you MUST let the dough rise a second time before you shape it for baking.  Otherwise, this is a good recipe.

Followed recipe as is since I've never made bread before, and the bread came out great.  Only change I would make is to add more rosemary, garlic and other herbs as other suggested. Otherwise, nice and crispy crust with a great soft texture inside.  I put dough on cold stone cookie sheet and it cooked perfectly in about 18 minutes.

I love this recipe. It came out perfect. I did add some parmesan or romano cheese to the top and I kinda cheated with the rosemary, I used a premade spice specifically for Focaccia from Epicure. If anything it made it even better. Thanks for this simply recipe!

Very good bread. Had to add about an extra teaspoon of olive oil during the dough cycle. I also threw in some parmesan cheese and italian seasoning. Used dry rosemary and garlic powder instead of fresh. I also cooked it on an oiled cookie sheet, with oil and rosemary atop the dough as well. I cut them panini style and we ate them with my herb butter. Will definitely make again.

Very easy and very good.  I did add some more seasonings such as Italian Seasoning and basi.  I did add some thinly sliced onions to top before putting in oven.

I altered this recipe and it turned out well even with the alteration being an accident.  I mixed all the cheese ingredients and rather than using sun dried tomatoes i used sun dried tomato salsa.  It was excellent!  I did have to increase the baking time and then added more cheese on top of it but my husband, five year old and three year old all LOVED it.  I'll have to write down my mistake so I can re-do it.

Even without a bread machine, this is a great tasting and easy recipe. If you want to substitute whole wheat flour like we did, it is very good -- just don't use ALL whole wheat. A good rule for most any recipe is to sub only half. Thanks for a great recipe!

I love this recipe!!!!! 

My own changes:  Instead of rosemary I use 1 tbsp italian (mix) spices and 1 tbsp chopped garlic instead of 2 tsps.

I follow exactly as instructed and my family LOVES it we often have it with an Italian style meal, like Spaghetti or Lazanga (a.k.a: lizard-on-ya)

This was nice, though a bit dry. I think it needed more oil on top. I used all whole wheat flour instead of white flour and substituted fresh thyme for the rosemary. Next time I will toss some chopped garlic in olive oil & rub over before baking...

This was super good and easy.  When I checked on my dough it was very dry.  I had to add water to the machine.  I used dried rosemary, 1tsp and a tsp of zatar.  On top with the oil, I added another tsp of zatar, pecorino and course salt.

Really good  and I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I'll brush a bit more olive oil on top and sprinkle with sea salt or maybe some parmesan since it was just a tiny bit under seasoned for my taste. The bread was perfectly baked after 25 minutes but I would have liked it a bit more brown on top but that isn't a deal-breaker. Love anything with rosemary in it and this recipe is so, so easy using a bread machine. Thanks for posting this!

Would have given this a 5 star rating, but the bread had a hard crust, which is not very focaccia-like. Possibly it should be baked at a lower temp, or given more of a chance to raise in the pan.

This bread is really easy to bake & delicious. However I find it a little dense when I tried to make sub sandwiches with it although I increased the yeast to 2 teaspoons hoping it will rise more. Will definitely continue to make this but perhaps not as sandwich bread.

This was super easy and delicious. I baked it in two 9-inch round cake pans for 25 minutes and it came out perfect. I didn't grease the pans and had a difficult time removing the bread. Next time I'll spray with Pam.

This had a great flavor, but mine turned out hard as a rock.  I must have overcooked it, but it never browned on top.  Might try again, but not sure I'm up to cleaning the mess out of the bread machine.

Looks and smells fantastic. Easy to do up...however, could not get it out of the pan. I have re-read the recipe..doesn't say grease or oil or lay down parchment. I was planning on making sandwiches for our ride tomorrow.

This was really good. It wasn't dried out at all. In fact it was nice and fluffy and appropriately moist. I added some Italian seasoning, as recommended by several reviewers, as well as about a tablespoon of grated parmesan to the dough. I also added some fresh basil, parmesan, kosher salt, and black olives along with the olive oil and rosemary on the top. My husband, who is leary of focaccia because it can be dry and too hard, ate four pieces. I'm guessing it got his seal of approval! =)

Excellent bread! The only change I made was to add Italian seasoning. I'm going to try this as a pizza dough next time.

Very good and easy. I baked it on pizza stone, takes a little longer, but adds a little more crunch to crust.

This is a fabulous bread! I shaped mine after the dough cycle, then let it re-rise for 30-45 minutes.  I sprinkled grated parmesan on top after brushing on the olive oil before baking.  I think it has a fabulous flavor as is, if you like a more "herby" flavor, add a pinch of italian seasoning in addition to the garlic and rosemary.

I was not impressed with this bread, but my family devoured it. For the ease of making it I would have given it 5 stars and I thin my family would also. As far as my own taste I would give it just 2. I did not think it had any flavor, kind of like a rice cracker. added cheese would help. It is in my recipe box and would have got rid of it, but for the fam's sake will fix it again, probably adding some cheese to the machine.

This recipe is really good. I made it exactly as written except I sprinkled coarse sea salt over the top before cooking (I recommend doing this). This bread really did come out perfect, though.

Amazing!  Followed to the letter, and it came out perfectly.  Crispy crust, soft interior. I meant to take a picture, but we couldn't help devouring a big hunk of it with olive oil and balsamic vinegar as soon as it was cool enough to cut.  Will absolutely make again!

I made this recipe tonight and it was great! I did change it a little bit. I added basil and fresh pepper to the mixture. Also, I placed thinly sliced red onions, and parm cheese on top.  My boyfriend and brother ate the entire Focaccia that night. I will def. make it again!!! It is a great recipe to experiment with.

I also followed this recipe as written (except to add some coarse kosher salt over the top). It does not have a smooth texture, is dry and more like a batter bread than traditional focaccia. I certainly won't make it again.

I have made this a couple of times and it is a definite hit.  Last time I made two batches for a party and only used one so put the dough in a plastic bag and refrigerated for three days and then used it for a dinner party and it was just as good. Nice to know if you are in a hurry or need to prepare a few items ahead of time.  I did use the kosher salt and also always use my bread machine.

Excellent results.  My family begs me to make it often.  The only thing I change is occasionally putting in some black olives, changing the herbs used and adding some fresh grated asiago cheese.

Oh my gosh...  This is a great recipe!!  Instead of only using Rosemary in the bread itself, I used 1 tsp Rosemary, 1 tsp Basil, 1 tsp Thyme, 1 tsp Parsley flakes.  As the dressing on top of the bread, try coating with olive oil, adding grated Parmesan and Kasseri cheese, then placing rings from an onion over the top.

Excellent, easy and quick.  I used a Pampered Chef bar stone for this and once the dough was in the stone, I covered the top with thinly sliced tomatoes, onions and a tiny bit of mozzarella.

I made this recipe with fresh rosemary and a few small changes.  Changes I made: 
- 1 tsp of sugar to the dough to help the yeast (you can't taste this in the final product)
- Some olive oil, salt and extra dried rosemary and Italian blend spices to the bottom of the pan before I put the dough in.  
- I let it rise a second time before baking.  
- I left it in the oven till it was starting to turn golden, before it had all turned golden brown I took it out and brushed it with more olive oil, then put it back in.  It crisped up beautifully and has a gorgeous colour.

The texture and appearance are fantastic, but I found that the recipe was lacking flavour.  I think it would be improved if the salt in the dough was doubled, and if you're using fresh herbs I would double the amount of fresh herbs at least.  I will try the recipe again with these changes.

This recipe works great! Thank you for positing it. I recently moved and lost the recipe I’ve been using for a decade. I’ve tried other recipes online with no success. This is the one I’m using now, for sure. It was a hit! :-) I followed the instructions exactly except for the addition of coarse sea salt on the top prior to baking.

Great recipe. For Chinese flavors, I made it with 3 tablespoons of sesame oil and chopped scallions in the mix, and brushed with 1.5 tablespoons of sesame oil before putting it in the oven. Baked for 22 minutes. Perfectly chewy with a thin crust. Served with a scallion ginger dip I made and it's scrumptious!

First time I made it followed instructions exactly. EXCEPT, I was out of Fresh Rosemary, but I had fresh Tarragon and used it. (one of my favorites anyway).  It came out perfect.  Now I will try it with Rosemary and will use whole wheat flour for a healthier bread. Makes a great sandwich bread the next day and toasted with my salad dinner.

First time I made it followed instructions exactly. EXCEPT, I was out of Fresh Rosemary, but I had fresh Tarragon and used it. (one of my favorites anyway).  It came out perfect.  Now I will try it with Rosemary and will use whole wheat flour for a healthier bread. Makes a great sandwich bread the next day and toasted with my salad dinner.

Good recipe, but nothing extraordinary.  Mine stuck to the pan even though I greased it with olive oil.

I made this dough in the breadmaker and then baked it in the oven. Split it in half and built a pizza on it. My family loved it.

Delicious!  This was my 1st attempt and it turned out beautifully. I did take the suggestions from some of the other reviews (adding more herbs and salting with kosher salt.  This is a keeper!

This bread came out  pretty good , with few changes. I make bread a lot, by hand, the traditional way my mom taught me or in the bread machine. I knew I could improve little on the recipe. I added 1 teaspoon of sugar to help the yeast do its job and help the browning during baking. I doubled the salt. I chose to use dried rosemary and garlic powder, so 1/3 the amount of both.
Also, the dough needed  couple more tablespoons of warm  water. I shaped the dough into 4 small oval breads. I topped couple of them with sliced black olives and sun dried tomatoes pieces. And the other 2 with thin slices of onion and sliced green olives. I sprinkled some dried oregano on top and some olive oil. I covered with plastic wrap and let the bread rise a second time for about 20 minutes before baking for about 15 minutes  turning the broiler on the last 2 minutes.

Very good recipe but needed a lot more salt. I followed someone else's instructions to add pinches of kosher salt on top; apparently I didn't add enough. But the garlic and rosemary was very nice. Used the dough cycle on a Zojirushi bread machine.

This bread turned out really nice. Very easy. Didn't have to change anything although I thought perhaps it would be hard and flat as there was not sugar for the yeast. Not so!! It's lovely!! I would add a little more salt to the recipe or maybe in the oil that is brushed on top!

This is a recipe I keep coming back to because it is awesome.

With the fresh garlic it really is nice, but if you skip this step it will still be nice. 

Be sure to cover and let sit like the directions say while preheating the oven it will absolutely make a difference in the texture of the bread.


So:

Put all ingredients in bread machine, dough cycle, turn out on oiled pan, shape it delicately and press with fingers, cover preheat often you're good to go

My 11 yo son made this in our breadmaker.  We didn't  pull it out, flatten, brush and bake in the oven.  We made the entire loaf in the breadmaker and didn't add the rosemary topping.  Next time we will add even more garlic and rosemary.  Dipped in a garlic and olive oil Italian Bread Dipper mix. It was amazing.  Would make great sandwich bread too.

I let the dough rise twice as others had indicated. I put kosher salt with the rosemary on top of the bread once it was flattened and dimpled. We like a soft crust, so as soon as I took this loaf out of the oven I brushed it with olive oil.  It's one of our favorites.

Sprinkled cheese on top. Also added an egg to the dough. Next batch I will let it rise a little so they will make good sandwich buns.

This is lovely and easy!  It behaves as described and works well with any topping I have tried.  I switched to garlic powder as suggest by another reviewer and we all liked the even spread of the garlic flavor better than fresh.  Thanks for a great recipe for any day!

This recipe turned out well, except I made a few changes. I made it into a large sub instead of rolling it out. Just after the water and salt were added I added 1 tbsp. of dry Italian seasoning. Then the flour and yeast. Once the dough was done I put it on a large cookie sheet, let it rest and sprinkled it with Reggiano parmesan. Bake at 350 for about 20 minutes, brushed with melted butter. Back in for another 5 minutes. Gone in no time.. A friends boyfriend actually cut the loaf she made in half, scooped out some of the inside and filled it with mustard, mayo and cold cuts.... Was so good his lunch was stolen the next day..... Lol...

This recipe is missing an ingredient - some form of sugar - about a teaspoon, and a step for the dough to rise in a warm place for an hour. And, I bake it @ 450 degrees for 20 minutes.

Maybe I did something wrong.  It was pretty tough in the bread machine, and almost as tough when it came out of the oven.  I added some sea salt to the top as some people suggested, but found it to be too bland.

This was the second Focaccia bread recipe I've tried. The first turned out perfect, so I'm not sure why I felt the need to try another! The bread was edible, and not bad but didn't taste like the Focaccia breads we are use to. It was much to flat in my opinion.

This is a regular in our house.  I always sprinkle with course sea salt, in addition to the 1 1/2 teaspoon of rosemary, before baking.  I definitely recommend trying this addition.  I've also found that dried crushed rosemary is easily swapped for the T fresh rosemary in the dough (Sometimes my rosemary plant needs a break, lol).  But fresh rosemary is best for topping the bread before baking.  Great easy recipe!

I've made focaccia by hand (which takes 2 days) and this recipe is *just as good* in 1/8 of the time! Omitted garlic, subbed 1 c whole wheat flour, will increase salt to 1 t., and oiled bottom of pan. Will make again and again!

followed the directions exactly. the dough looked great, but the bread had a hard crust and was bland. I'll add more salt and try a higher heat and shorter cooking time if i try it again.

This recipe was simple and delicious. I used 3 cloves or fresh garlic, a TB of fresh basil and 1.5 tsp of crushed red pepper.  I omitted the rosemary, and sprinkled the top with kosher salt and Parmesan cheese.  I baked the bread on a pizza stone instead of a pan and it turned out beautifully.  Just remember to flour your pizza peel before shaping or you'll have a difficult time transferring to the stone.  Remember to check to dough for consistency during the kneading cycle and add flour/water as necessary.

This has got to be the BEST bread I have ever eaten!!!!! I followed the recipe exactly and it is sooooooooooooooo good and so easy. I am planning my meals for next week and this is the "crust" i'm gonna use on pizza night. I literally ate half of the loaf the same day that I made it. And it makes a HUGE loaf!!!!! With the other half, I cut it into sandwich size slices and gave it to a friend. They kept asking me where I bought it because they didn't believe that you can make bread this good at home!!!

Pretty good....I should have listened to other reviews and added course salt to the top before baking, it definitely needed it! I used fresh rosemary and a couple teaspoons each of fresh basil, oregano and parsley. I made this for appetizer, but will make fabulous sandwich bread. With a bit of modification this will be a keeper in my recipe box. Thank you!

It was great.  I made the enough to have pizza base and to make bread on the side.  The pizza was fantastic and the bread is quite soft - I am having it in a sandwich a day later and it still has the freshly baked feel.  This is certainly a recipe I will keep using!

I used light spelt flour so had to adjust the water accordingly. We have an allergy to garlic in our family, so used minced onion instead & added some dried oregano & basil. Tasted pretty good & would make a great pizza crust if rolled out thinner.

This was good, but a bit bland...definately try dusting the top with coarse kosher salt to give more flavor.

I haven't eaten my focaccia yet, but it looks like it's store bought save for the slightly peaked color.  Next time I think I'll brush with a little egg wash for a more authentic golden glow.  It's beginning to get HOT here, in the 90's during the day, so I let my dough rise, after patting out into an 8 x 8 glass pan, in my car.  Looks very bubbly.  Can't wait to eat it.

I have made this bread twice. The first time I accidentally let it sit to long and it rose a little too much, however the bread still turned out great, I followed other peoples advice and sprinkled the salt on top. The bread has turned out great both times and my family now requests that we have it in the house at all times.

Very nice and easy.  I added more seasoning--italian seasoning, sage, dried minced onions.  I'm a garlic freak so I added more of that as well.  I separated my rounds into two small ones and dimpled, then let rise.  I suppose I didn't need to; the dimpling didn't remain and the rounds weren't flat like normal focaccia, but I don't really care.  Tastes good.  Thanks!

I have made this twice and it turned out perfect.For those who end up with a dry dough try checking the dough ball while it is kneading. I had to add a little water to get it right. Also using the rising in a cold oven method worked great! An excellent bread I will make often.

Gobbled greedily by my hard-to-impress sons and husband. Very easy to make - so I'll be making this frequently from now on. I also sprinkled the top with sea salt and herbs. Delicious!

This recipe is so good, I am now known by it. Every potluck, get-together, family gathering...I have to bring it or I hear about it all night.  The only change I have made is to add sea salt to the top before popping it in the oven!

Amazing recipe!  I made it in the bread machine, and it was great!  I even substituted rosemary for 1/4 tsp of dried parsley, the kind that comes in the shaker, and the fresh garlic for 1/4 tsp of garlic powder, and it came out really well!

Easy to make and the family enjoyed (even 3 young kids).  I did use whole wheat flour instead of plain. I would probably enjoy the recipe better using plain flour. But still a good recipe and easy the make.

this was great, i didnt need to change a thing. maybe next time though i might try brushing with a little bit of salted butter rather than olive oil to enhance the flavour.

Followed directions to a "T" with one exception, I used whole wheat bread and added 1 tbsp of water as was suggested in another review.
