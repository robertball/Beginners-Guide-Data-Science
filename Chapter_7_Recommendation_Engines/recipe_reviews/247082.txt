I've been making a similar dish for 40 years....leave out the broth.  I have used frozen breasts, pepperoni or salami, summer sausage, chorizo, whatever smoky meat you have, 2-3 cloves pressed garlic, extra herbs, that package of ranch sounds good....1-2 Tablespoons brown sugar, 2-3 cups of whatever sauce you want......Yum!

I will make this again for sure! I did and will make changes. I seasoned the chicken breasts with powdered ranch dressing mix just because I thought there needed to be a multi-level seasoning on the chicken. It worked. 14 oz. is way too much broth it was rather soupy. The only way I would use that much broth in the future is to try putting dry pasta in then to extend the slow cooker time to cook the pasta. I did as another reviewer suggested and used pepper flakes instead of jalapenos. Over all VERY tasty.

I made this for my family with some modifications to fit our tastes. My suggestion is to make it a soup. I added 2 jars of spaghetti sauce 4 -14oz cans of chicken broth a handful more of pepperoni instead of jalapeños I used about 1/4 tablespoon of red pepper flakes and I use 8 boneless skinless chicken thighs. Separately I cook up some penne or similar pasta and before serving I add the pasta to the crockpot to mix it all together. We literally now eat this almost once a week.

I made this and like others, omitted the broth.  I seasoned 4 breasts with garlic & onion powder, creole seasoning, pepper & Italian seasoning. Put tiny bit of water on bottom of crockpot. Layered chicken, pepperoni, cheese, sauce, pepperoni, cheese, sauce. Added total of 1 jar of sauce and cooked on high for 2.5 hours. Everyone liked it!

Easy recipe that can be adapted to your tastes and your pantry.  I read the reviews and agreed that the chicken broth was a bit too much liquid so I left it out. I used 1/2 bottle of spaghetti sauce which was perfect. The pepperoni made a great addition! I also added sliced black olives, diced garlic,  and peas and served it with mashed potatoes. This recipe is a keeper.

Fairly simple. Tasty. I noticed it was soupy as well but what I I did was pour everything in my 8quart pan and let the spaghetti soak up the soup. Seasoned with salt and pepper to taste.

I like the combo of flavors except it was WAY too soupy so I served mine over rice. 'll make this again with only a slight covering of water on the bottom of the slow cooker and perhaps a pinch of chicken bouillon granules.

I have made this multiple times. First as written and it was ok. I now use homemade marinara, leave out the broth, use a combination of shredded mozz and parm cheese added for the last 10-15 minutes of cooking on top of the chicken (until it melts a bit) and serve it over whatever pasta I have a hankering for. Serve a Caesar salad on the side and it is fabulous!

Way too much chicken broth. I probably wouldn’t use any next time. Sauce way too watered down. I lightly sautéed the chicken in olive oil. I think when ever meat goes into the crock pot it tastes way better if it is quickly sautéed first. It probably could use a big more seasoning also

This was really good and so easy! 3 favorites things: crockpot chicken breast marinara sauce. Pepperoni is great flavor addition.I did not use chicken broth. A bit salty but served on spaghetti noodles with mozzarella this was quite yummy. Started with completely frozen chicken breasts and cooked low for almost 5 hours plenty. Chicken was almost falling apart.

I would definitely go light with the broth. Don't want to add too much and make a soupy sauce. FYI. Maybe add a little extra cheese.

Amazing will make many times. I only changed the recipe a bit. 1 and 1/4 jars sauce no broth no jalepenos. I coated the chicken with ranch powder/pepper/Italian essence. Then I placed pepperoni cheese sauce pepperoni cheese sauce on top of breasts. Cooked on high for 2.5 hrs and left on low till the hubby could come home and eat. Also I didn't do pasta bc the cheese made this a filling meal.

After reading all the reviews I replaced the broth and spaghetti sauce with my homemade marinara sauce. I seasoned the chicken with sea salt fresh cracked pepper and 5 cloves of minced garlic. In addition my wife does not like jalapenos; so I left out it out. In place of the jalapeno I added some Linguiça Sausage which added some additional mild spicy flavor.

As almost all of the reviews said I used MUCH less broth than required. I also used powder ranch on the chicken. Didn't feel like heading to the store when I had all but one ingredient so I used pizza topping pepperoni instead of sandwich pepperoni. I'm definitely printing this one out! Parents really enjoyed it. =D

I made it as is. Sauce was thin yes but very tasty. I used shredded mozzarella on top of the pasta probably more than the one slice recipe called for.Glad I did it as written otherwise.

Cut up 4 of my leftover garden tomatoes and a whole small onion and placed them on the bottom rather than the broth. Added 4 cloves of garlic and 2 teaspoons of basil and oregano and 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne rather than using jalapeno. Cut up the chicken and coated it in Italian breadcrumbs. Still topped with sauce and pepperoni. Cooking now and smells great.

Because of the other reviews I only used a small amount of chicken broth and I think it could have been left out altogether. If I make it again I would add a lot more seasonings. However the jalapeños were a good addition.

I skipped the chicken broth and thank goodness b/c it was too soupy for my taste w/just the spaghetti sauce. Next time I'd skip the SS and use tomato paste. The chicken was a little bland which surprised me as I thought the pepperoni would completely take care of flavoring. As given I would not make it again hence 3 stars but spicing up chicken and using tomato paste would make this a great dish. So nice to dump all in the crock pot and have dinner ready a few hours later. That is a big plus.

Very easy to make when my 11 yr grandson goes back for 2nd you know it s good. I put extra sauce and I cooked my noodles in the crockpot also worked great. Of course extra cheese but I used shredded. I seasoned the chicken with poultry seasoning and rubbed it.

The chicken was entirely too dry - I think it is because it was just in the crock pot for entirely too long. I love the ingredients and intend to make it again on the stove.

I used my Instant Pot slow cooker setting for this. I made a few changes based on the reviews. I omitted the broth all together and I didn't use any jalapenos (I'm not a fan of the peppers). Once it was done cooking I removed the chicken breasts & pepperoni from the sauce and added a large tin of roasted garlic tomato sauce and a small tin of garlic tomato paste and cooked it on low saute setting until heated through - I wanted a pasta sauce for ice spaghetti. I shredded the chicken and pepperoni. I put the spaghetti on a plate topped it with shredded chicken and pepperoni then tore up the slices of mozzarella cheese then poured the steaming pasta sauce on top (which melted the cheese perfectly). I really enjoyed it. My husband absolutely loved it but he insists I use more pepperoni next time. Apparently this very easy dish is going to be a regular in our household now!

I lessened the broth based on others reviews and added some Ranch seasoning to this dish. The sauce was still very thin and not very flavorful. I will make this again with less or maybe no broth and definitely add some seasonings and garlic!

I amped up the seasoning and added a LOT of pepperoni and I enjoyed this a lot! I will make again and tweak seasoning more and maybe make my own tomato sauce. For convenience, using a store bought sauce is awesome though!
