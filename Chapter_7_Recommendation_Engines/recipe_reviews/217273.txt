This drink was okay but the name is very misleading. I would call it "Fizzy Iced Tea". There is no lemon in it - just a little splash of lime juice and not enough sweet or sour to be called lemonade. The flavor is dry. I added more sugar and lime juice and it was much improved.

I changed it up a little bit.  Only half cup boiling water over 3 tea bags.  Chilled that then used 1/4 cup for each of 2 servings. Instead of sugar I used 5 drops stevia and used 2 pkts True Lime per serving.  Added it to a large mason jar and filled with ice and seltzer. Very refreshing. Have now made this with True Lemon and True Orange as well as the True Lime, 2 pkts each time.  So Good!

I agree that the name really ought to be 'limeaide'...I used Lipton's Green Tea with Honey hoping for extra sweetness. I still ended up adding plenty of sugar and a little extra lime juice to get the flavor just right. Will play around with amounts again...

I liked this well enough but I have to agree this recipe is misnamed. No lemon to be seen so it should be called limeade. At any rate it's pretty easy. I used splenda instead of sugar and it worked fine. I didn't think it needed more sweetening but I'm not a fan of sugar in my tea. I used a mint green tea and I liked that flavor but bf wasn't impressed. Not sure if it's the mint or the whole idea he didn't like but he didn't drink it. I enjoyed it though and may try with plain green tea next time. thanks for the recipe!

I'm sorry for the poor rating but I was looking for a recipe to duplicate the sparkling green tea sold at True Foods Kitchen. Not only was it anything resembling what I was looking for but it had absolutely NO FLAVOR whatsoever. For one it wasn't sweet enough as I had to add monk fruit and stevia. Even so the sparkling water "watered down" any flavor and I just didn't care for the taste at all.
