I really liked this. The flavours are outstanding. I made mine in a tagine. I sautéed the veggies first then added the other ingredients, placing the cover on top and cooking in the oven for 30 minutes at 190°C. Delicious served with sorghum grains.

What really made this dish was the Greek yogurt with cilantro, and serving it over couscous.  It was a great way to use up left over turkey from Thanksgiving.

I cannot recommend this recipe. I recently visited Morocco and this recipe was a disappointment compared to the tagines there. The amount of fruit made it too sweet for a savory stew. I cooked the veggies for an hour (vs the recommended 30") and they still were not the correct consistency. I think you just can expect a quick stove-top soup to match the slow-cooking of a real tagine. Maybe a slow cooker recipe would be a closer match.

The only changes I made to this recipe was to add chopped celery, and I used dairy free sour cream instead of yogurt. It was really good. I tried the recipe a second time using some pork chunks (chops) but the flavor didn't go with the dish as well as I hoped.

We really enjoyed this recipe and made it exactly as called for.  We love the veggies and fruit, the turkey was leftovers from a breast we made earlier in the week.  I was a little worried that it would be too sweet, but the ras el hanout seasoning tied everything together and a dollop of greek yogurt on top of each serving provided a cool, creamy contrast to the seasoning.  We did make the ras el hanout based on the cooks notes and we had all the spices available at home.  Thanks for this delicious recipe Hunt's!
