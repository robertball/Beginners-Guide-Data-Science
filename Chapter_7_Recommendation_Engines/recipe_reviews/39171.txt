Fantastic! I love pumpkin and this is a great alternative to Beef Stew. Even my three year old gobbled it up!

I was a little apprehensive about trying this stew since I am not a great lover of pork.  I am a fan of pumpkin andI have to admit that this stew was exceptional!!!  Absolutley loved it.  Maybe it was the hint of cinnamon that was so enticing, aromatic,flavorful and reminicent of a fall comfort food, but nevertheless, it was very favorful and a definite keeper in my home to warm cold bones on a cool autumn evening!!  Tasty!!Thanks for this recipe to add to my collection of pumpkin favorites!!!

Very good stew!  Tastes like an ordinary stew with a hint in cinnamon.  I used a regular white wine, russett potatoes, and I doubled the green bean (we love veggies.) I think the previous review did have problems, because of cooking the cinnamon stick for 6 hours.  My stew had a lovely aroma.  I will make again next fall.

This was really good! I made it in the slow cooker, and the pork was super tender.  My kids weren't as thrilled with it, but they did eat it, and they're very picky.  Both my DH and I loved it though, and I will definately be making it again.

Just the smell of this made me sick to my stomach.  It made my apartment smell horrible.  My boyfriend thought it was good, but I couldn't bring myself to eat something so horrible.  One problem was that we made it in the crockpot and put a cinnamon stick in for the whole 6 hours.  It might be our fault so if you really think it sounds good, don't take it from me.

I was very wary of this recipe at first because of the ingredients.  Don't be afraid - it tastes delicious and is nice change from a tomato based sauce.  I made this in my crock pot with the following changes in the recipe:  I cut the amount of onion in half (I've found that onion flavor gets stronger in the crock pot).  I cooked the onion and garlic in the oil, then browned the pork stew meat.  Since I didn't have any green beans, I omitted them.  I drained the diced tomatoes and only used 1 cup of chicken broth.  I cooked on low for 8 hours - the final amount of liquid was just right, in my opinion.  
By the way, I was going to put in the cinnamon stick for the last hour of cooking but completely forgot.  The stew was delicious anyway.  My husband said it reminded him of Manhattan clam chowder but with pork.

I was very nervous about this recipe, but my eight year old really likes pumpkin and wanted to make it.  I am glad he was persistent because this is the best stew I have ever had!  Although I changed it a little bit. I cooked the onion and garlic in the olive oil and lightly browned the pork, then I dumped it in the slow cooker and let it cook all day on low. I added pumpkin pie filling instead of plain pumpkin. I also used died tomatoes that were already seasoned with basil. This stew will be a tradition we make in our home now.

didn't have pumpkin- out of season.  made sw pot and reg pot mashed instead.  sauce would have been thicker if i used pumpkin- can't imagine the taste- but will try again.  pork nice and tender & nice flavor.  not a total favorite, but worth trying again.

I liked this stew.  It just didn't knock my socks off, so four stars.  I will make it again.  I appreciate the fact that it gets most of it's body from the pumpkin instead of tomatoes.  I have to stop eating tomatoes due to arthritis.  I have experimented with making a pasta sauce with pumpkin or pureed squash and when I have it perfected will post it.

I was disappointed at how bland it was.  I expected the pumpkin to give it a sweet flavor, but it didn't.

Shocking! I wasn't very happy, it didn't seem to taste much different to me than beef stew...and it didn't freeze well at all!

Sorry to say but I'm not a fan of this one.  The tenderloin turned out really well but the pumpkin was overpowering for me.
