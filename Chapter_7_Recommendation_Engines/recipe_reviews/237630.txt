My husband and I made this for dinner. I was curious about the molasses flavor only to find my molasses had expired. Maybe next time?  We liked enough to know there will be a next time.

The molasses flavor is distinct, and I am not big on molasses. I may try this again without the molasses and let re-rate.

Delicious and so much better than all those recipes that call for gobs of ketchup and brown sugar. It was a no brainer to feed this to my kids, and bonus that hubby and I loved it, too!
