LOVED the fritters!  Just a note, I used a can of the cheap crab and while the flavor was there the texture pretty much disappeared into the fritters.  If that's not what you're going for I would definitely spring for the more expensive can of lump crab rather than the cheap flaky stuff.  Regardless, these were WONDERFUL!

I substituted shallots for the onion and the fritters were delicious. My family has requested this to be in our seafood menu rotation.

Very delicious recipe. I made them more like corn oysters and added some Old Bay seasoning and fresh lump blue crabmeat into the batter for a bit of Baltimore style.

Will definitely make these again. I added lump crabmeat to the canned crab as an extra treat.

Everyone enjoyed it. :) Mine turned into more of a pancake than fritter but still good all the way around. I did add twice the amount of crab. Glad I did.
