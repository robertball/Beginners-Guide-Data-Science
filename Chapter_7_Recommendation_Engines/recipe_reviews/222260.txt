This is the REAL DEAL.  Everyone LOVED this meatloaf.  I was too lazy to measure the saltines - I guestimated and used one package of saltines (4 0z) roughly crumbled with my hands.  Blending in onion and bell pepper along with eggs etc... is brillant!  Mixing it all together with your hands assures that it isn't over worked yet well mixed.  Then, by free forming rather than cooking in a loaf pan allows the water in the meat loaf to evaporate, leaving a crispy exterior.  Thanks for featuring this recipe, it is a keeper for sure.

Awesome meatloaf... Meatloaf is one of my husband's all-time favorite foods.  Unfortunately,  it is one food I've never really made well.  Even though I don't dislike meatloaf, I never cared for it enough to learn to make it.  My first few attempts were-- well-- not good.  When I saw this recipe, it seemed like it would hit the mark.  After all, how could a grandma named Coco be wrong?  It did hit the mark!  My husband LOVED it.  He even commented, "This will make kickin' sandwiches tomorrow!" He said Coco definitely knew what she was doing.  I even had a second helping. :)  The texture is spot-on which can make or break a meatloaf in my opinion. The blending of the veggies was a genius idea and actually made prep faster because I didn't have to spend extra time carefully chopping. (I admit that I did throw a couple of garlic cloves in the blender.) Thanks Coco and Steve!

This was definitely a child-friendly recipe, with no chunks of onion or peppers and no ground black pepper.  I actually prefer to find bits of veggies, because I think they give more flavor than the "pasteurized" version.  Mom's version of meatloaf includes bread crumbs, but the cracker crumbs made this a very tender loaf.  I cooked for the full hour, and let rest for 15 minutes.  I will make again, but I will add more mustard and some ground black pepper.

Needless to say, my husband is picky, I'm a surgeon and can't cook, and he liked it still!!!!! YAY! Better than standard. Added A-1, just a splash? haha.Used regular mustard in the wet mix instead of dry...didn't even know what dry mustard was. sub red, yel, and orange, peppers for green and onion b/c I didn't have any green or onion. was still tasty! I did throw in some dried onion for flavor...maybe a tsp? WTVR, good recipe!

I dont have a lot of experience making meatloaf, but after watching the video I had to try it. I didnt have dry mustard so I added a teaspoon of table mustard and from reading other meatloaf recipes I added 1/4 cup brown sugar to the meat. For the topping I put ketchup on half and barbecue on the other. Both sides turned out delicious but the barbecue gave it a little more of a kick. I do recommend trying! Also I had to cook for 50 mins instead of 45 mins and to add to one reviewer, one whole sleeve of saltine crackers is 2 cups. My kids absolutely loved it and my husband couldnt get enough! I will definitely be making this one again!! Thank you Steve for posting!

Everybody loves this meatloaf recipe!  I do use red bell pepper instead of green.  Every time I make it, the family tells me I should have doubled the recipe so we would have leftovers. Once I used crushed Ritz crackers as I ran out of saltines and that was great too.  I do use my grandmother's meatloaf glaze of ketchup, mustard and brown sugar simmered on the stove until combined and then spread on top of meatloaf with extra for dipping.

Awesome tasting, moist, easy meatloaf!  Have made with and without the green pepper and was great both ways.  I don't even puree the onion mixture like the directions state to...just put everything in my mixer and pulse together (so the meat doesn't get overworked).  Also, I substitute steak sauce in the meatloaf and spread ketchup on top...which makes it extra yummy!  If you don't like your food really salty, leave out the added salt (or just use a little) because the saltine crackers will add plenty.  My family said it was the best meatloaf ever!

I thought this was a good basic meatloaf, not a lot of flavor &  I didn't care for the plain ketchup topping. I def prefer the crushed crackers vs bread crumbs!

Coco's Meatloaf Haiku: "Guess it's the puree. But my meatloaf was so moist, it just fell apart." Fall-apart-ey meatloaf makes me very, very sad b/c there's no hope for leftover meatloaf sandwiches the next day. I followed the recipe as directed but had to sub in 1 c. Ritz crackers. I let the meatloaf rest for enough time too, but it still just went to crumbles when sliced. It tasted fantastic though, so I'd gladly make it again, but maybe w/o the milk or the pureed veggies, if those were possibly the culprit for my mooshy meatloaf mush meal.

With all the glowing reviews and knowing my husband wouldn't touch it with a 10' pole had he spotted an onion, I couldn't wait to try this method of pureeing the veggies. I didn't have green peppers on hand but I did use the onion. We were quite disappointed in this meatloaf. I felt this meatloaf was quite bland and was missing something. I am sure it would have been better with the green peppers. I don't think I will be using this one again, but I will use the puree method on my next meatloaf. He never knew the onions were in there.

Love this, just like my Mama's meatloaf and I'm from Nashville as well. Only thing I did different was use chilli sauce (bottled by Heinz) for the topping instead of plain ketchup. Thanks for a really great comfort food recipe.

This meatloaf had a very good taste to it, but I like more texture to meatloaf.  I made it as written and pureeing the veggies, milk and egg made for a softer meatloaf.  I really enjoyed it the second day as a meatloaf sandwich with mustard.

Loved this meatloaf! You can have this meal within the hour! I didn't have bell pepper but I did use the saltine crackers. I used this recipe for a Halloween mold to create a meatloaf mummy. It worked great and held together wonderfully. I think the only thing that I would try in the future, would be to add garlic as my family loves garlic. But it tasted great even without it. I did like a review from Jennylou138 that I might try in the future also.

I have been making meatloaf all different ways for many years, following my Moms recipes and my sisters. I love them all. This one my husband actually raved about!!! Although I don't use beef, I used a combination of turkey and veal. I think blending the onion pepper eggs and milk  combination does something to make it the most moist meatloaf I ever tasted!!! I added fresh garlic and a teaspoon of brown sugar. Also I combined bbq sauce and ketchup and spread it over the top.
Amazing!!!!! Thanks Coco and Steve for this wonderful recipe.

This meatloaf has a good flavor and it is also moist. I have other meatloaf recipes that I like, but I am making room for this one too. It is so delicious and different than any of the other recipes. I didn't change a thing.

I made this using a serving size of 3 because I only had 1 lb. of ground beef. I added a dash of dehydrated garlic, 1 Tb worcestershire sauce, and a dash of black pepper. I should have reduced the salt to about 3/4 tsp as it was a touch too salty for us, but otherwise delicious!  Oh and I put 1/4 cup chopped green bell peppers and 1/4 cup chopped red bell peppers (double what the recipe called for). I added 1/4 cup ketchup to the egg mixture (instead of 2 Tb) and another 1/4 cup ketchup to the top.  We liked it a lot! I definitely will be making this again.

Best Meatloaf ever. I did take a few cues from the other reviews. I added garlic to the meat loaf puree. I also added Worcestershire to the topping. I used a pesto crouton instead of saltines. It was delicious. 
I have been told to keep this on the repeat list my husband did request I use less spice on the next go round. So I will try to reduce the crouton's by half and add half bland bread crumbs or something of that nature. I am finding the left overs a bit tangy but I like it.

I had no saltines.  I used half french bread crumbs, and half crushed vegi-thins.  I also put ten fresh sage leaves on top of the ketchup glaze.  By the way, this is by far the easiest thing to make, can't get anything wrong, I'm giving it to my idiot friend who can't cook.  and it was soft, so tender.

I needed to use up a lb of elk meat my brother had given me but knew my husband would be worried about eating wild game so I added a lb of beef burger. This was very good. I don't know if it will be this good with all beef, I would think so. Other than the Elk meat change all else was the same. My husband raved about it.  Easy to make, delicious!!!

When I realized I was out of Lipton's Onion Soup Mix, I headed to Allrecipes for an alternative.  I loved the video and  I had enough similar ingredients to make it happen.  I had red peppers, red onions and Ritz crackers, so it's not faithful to Coco, but it's a winner in my book.

It was good and very easy although I prefer some chunky onions and bell pepper, which can easily be added. Also, I DIDNT SEASON MY MEAT! how embarrassing that I forgot.  Thank you for this recipe!

I didn't have time to purée the onions and peppers and stuff so I just left them chopped very fine. I added a teaspoon of garlic and parsley just for colour and also used a pound of regular ground beef. It was a hit!!!! Hubs said it was the best meatloaf he's ever had. Definitely going into the rotation.

Moist tender meatloaf!  Never puréed the veggies before. It is really fast & easy. Makes the texture smooth. I added 3 cloves fresh garlic & 2 tbsp fresh parsley , 1 tbsp fresh ground pepper to the blender since I could tell it would be too bland for our taste otherwise. Used 1 small package of Ritz crackers and half package of saltines since had that’s on hand. Topped w the classic mix of 1/4 cup ketchup, 2 tbsp yellow mustard and brown Splenda. Used reduced sugar ketchup from Heinz since are diabetic. Served with mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy. My 86 year old Mom , who hates anything with ground beef,  gobbled it up! Next time I will add worcestshire to the blender and maybe add Sriracha chili sauce to the topping as recommended by Chef J ohn. Will also try this purée technique with the classic beef, veal & pork meat blend. I bet that’d be good!

I have made meat loaf many times, using several different recipes, I've never had very much luck in achieving the result I wanted. This one works! Crispy outside, firm moist inside. Flavor is excellent, and the blending of the veg and egg mix is the exact trick you need to avoid those chunks of raw onion and peppers inside, why didn't I think of that? That said. I did make a couple of minor changes, red onion instead of yellow, and yellow pepper instead of green, as these were what I had on hand, otherwise, I made as written. This recipe makes the perfect meat loaf, and thank goodness, the best texture for sandwiches! Finally!

Good basic meat loaf but it needs something to jump start it!  I used less crackers  and made a topping glaze mixture of ketchup and Heinz '57 Sauce.  2 lbs of ground beef took about 75 min to cook thru.

Loved it. Easy recipe. It was my first time making meatloaf! Always have ground beef for tacos and I'm sick of tacos. Needed somthing different and this was a great recipe. Just a few things i changed were, 1-i did not puree the first mixture (mixed egg and milk together like scrambled eggs then added veggies. 2-i used celery instead of peppers. 3- used regular yellow mustard. 4-i added some black pepper.  5-i added a pkg of lipton onion soup mix in with the saltines mixture. And 6-covered top with ketchup. Delicious..

Good recipe! One thing that would be helpful (especially for novice cooks) is to know how big the loaf should be: too short and fat and it doesn't get done, too long and flat and it's over cooked. Just a length and width should make it the right size for everyone to have great results.

I'm not a big meatloaf fan,  but my boyfriend is,  and he absolutely loves this recipe! I used croutons instead of crackers, and that's only because I forgot them at the store. I also put more ketchup on top, but that's just be preference.  Worked just fine! He asks me to make it almost every week!

Loved it as did the kids.  As another reviewer noted, the lack of vegetable chunks made the difference for the kids.   I found that one full sleeve of saltines gave me the required 2 cups.

I made one slight change and added a 1/4 cup of ketchup and brown sugar glaze in place of the plain ketchup topping.  That makes this a go-to for my family.

Love it! I'm on a journey honing my cooking skills and my wife and children (adults now really) were skeptical of a meatloaf done differently. Wow, were they won over. I used Ritz crackers instead of saltines since we almost never have saltines in the house. I also did not use a blender, but preferred having chunks of pepper and onion in the meatloaf, but for those with children, I suppose those might be nasty bits - we loved them. I will return to this recipe again, in fact I'll be making it tomorrow for my son's return from college. This makes a really great family meal.

I really like this meatloaf :) i prefer my veggies big so no puree for me! otherwise it would get a five star. I had no bell pepper to add so I'm looking forward to the next time with all the ingredients. Delicious!!

This was very yummy. Normally I don't like to review recipes that I've made changes to, but this came out so good that I feel I need to.  I didn't have any onion or bell pepper in the house so instead I used some garlic powder and onion powder in the egg mixture.  I followed all other instructions and it was so good!

I found the flavour perfect, but wouldn't bother with the ketchup topping again, a topping that was a little more... visually appealing would work better for me. The loaf held together perfectly, but I think I'll try one less egg next time, I found it a little moist for my taste. Great meatloaf though overall.

I had to make a few adjustments but this was phenomenal meatloaf!  Switched out almond milk and Earth Balance to make is dairy free, oats in place of crackers, half ground beef/pork, added an extra 1/4 C almond milk because I only had old fashioned oats.  Cooked a little longer and it was the most tender, stick together meatloaf I have ever had.  Just don't tell my mom.
This make 2 good sized loaves.  One for today, one to freeze!
