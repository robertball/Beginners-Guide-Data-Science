I have made this recipe for the past three years and always receive rave reviews. People who have eaten sweet potato pie all their lives say this recipe is the best they have ever tasted. I have made minor changes to suit my taste. I use evaporated milk instead of regular milk. I add a 1/4 tsp of cloves and ginger and 2 tbsp of lemon juice. The lemon enhances the tast of the potatoes. I also add a 1 tbsp flour to the mixture to thicken up a bit. Last, I I halve the white sugar and replace with brown sugar.  Try this and you won't be disappointed.

I've made this a few times and the recipient always loves it.  One suggestion--don't store the boiled sweet potatoes in the fridge when you don't have time to make the pie right then...it separates a bit and makes the pie grainier than it needs to be.  It's much smoother when the directions are followed and it's mixed right after boiling and peeling.  :)

The flavor was delicious, but it was very sweet.  The filling did not set well and was slightly loose, as a few other reviewers have noted.  However, I printed this recipe last year and just got around to trying it now.  Apparently in the meantime the recipe has been adjusted from "1 large sweet potato" to "1 one-pound sweet potato".  Perhaps this will make a difference.  In comparing this recipe to other sweet potato pie recipes, I've noticed that most seem to call for 2 cups mashed sweet potatoes.  I don't believe my "one large" sweet potato equalled 2 cups mashed.

I was looking for a fast, easy, sweet potato pie to bake for a church function, and came across this one.  I read about 50 of the reviews and decided it was the one I would make, but was surprised that not one of the reviews mentioned substituting canned sweet potatoes.  I didn't have an hour to bake or boil the potatoes, so I used a 17.2 oz can of sweet potatoes instead of 1 pound of fresh.  I didn't even warm them so they would be similar to the cooked, fresh sweet potatoes!  I just opened the can, drained them, and threw them in the mixing bowl with the softened butter.  I had to mix with electric mixer for a while until most of the lumps were out, but then just followed the recipe as written.  I added just a little more milk since the can was a little over 1 lb.  The pie was great, and saved me over an hour of prep time.

I am a new cook and this is the first pie I ever made and it came out fantastic!!  Although I changed the recipe a little after reading the reviews I used 1/2 cup of white sugar, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, evap milk instead of regular milk, 2 teaspoons of fresh squeezed lemon juice (I didn't have lemon extract), and homemade pie crust (stephanie's basic flaky crust at allrecipes) and it came out wonderfully creamy and the lemon juice enhanced the flavor of the sweet potatoes.  Thanks again!!  Be Blessed.

This was the first sweet potatoe pie I have ever made! I never liked the taste of sweet potatoe pies before, but my boyfriend said it was time I learned to make one. So I went looking for a good sounding one and this was the one I chose. It was DELICIOUS!!!!!! the only thing I did different than the original recipe was I mixed the sweet potatoe up by itself; before adding the butter, to get all the strings out of the sweet potatoe. My boyfriend had told me about the strings... otherwise I wouldnt have known about them either. It passed his taste test, along with mine. I would say it was a winner of a recipe. thank you for submitting it!!!!!

I've been using this recipe since 2002 and I always get rave reviews. I've been offered money, especially during holidays to make many of these pies. The recipe is simple and absolutely perfect. At times, I will make a few variations like using 1/2 brwn sugar & 1/2 white or heavy cream instead of milk. At times even ad a tablespoon of rum extract It all depends on what I have on hand. Thanks for sharing this classic!

This is the absolute BEST recipe for a Sweet Potato Pie! I made this for Thanksgiving and 2 pies for Christmas! The flavor was outstanding, and the spices were perfect! The only thing I changed was that I added about 2 or 3 tablespoons of flour to the mixture. This addition was to help thicken the mixture. It's a little too loose if you don't add the flour. Don't be alarmed when the pie rises while baking; it'll fall when it cools. It's DELICIOUS!!!

This recipe is idot proof--I'm the idiot, and here's the proof!  I was so nervous when a hospitalized friend requested a southern favorite of his, sweet potato pie, since the only thing southern about me is southern California! I totally screwed up this pie. After putting the pie in the oven to bake, I noticed the EGGS on the counter: I had forgotten to add them!  It was out of the oven, back in the bowl to add the eggs, then back in the oven.  After fifteen minutes I checked the pie, only to discover that in my panic over forgetting the eggs, I had TURNED OFF THE OVEN! So it was back out of the oven to wait for the oven to re-heat, and then back in for the rest of the cooking time.  And can you believe after all this the pie turned out PERFECT?  My friend ate two pieces at dinner and kept a third for a bedtime snack. (Either because the pie was so good, or the hospital food was so bad, we'll never know.) Thank you for this delicious--and forgiving--recipe!

This is an excellent recipe!  To speed up cook time, though, I microwave the sweet potato for 6 minutes.  Using the microwave makes it a lot easier, too.  My family loved this pie, especially my husband!  A definite keeper!

this is good as far as the ingrediants~~~ however, to make it awesome... need to separate the eggs, and beat the whites until they are stiff, then stir that into the rest. NOW that makes it perfect!

This was so darn good! Just a note; I do this same idea with pumpkin pie. I pre- bake my crust for ten minutes before pouring in the filling. I first prick the pie shell with a fork so it doesn't puff up.(no it doesn't leak with filling in it)I than pour in filling and bake as directed. I always cover my crust for half the baking time.Then remove the "crust covers" and continue baking till filling is set. This way your crust doesn't over brown and good to last crumb! I did what someone else suggested and used can milk and mostly brown sugar and cut back about 2 Tablespoons of sugar. I boiled fresh sweet patatoes in their skin. Cooled them and put in food prosser to make it creamy. I used 2 c. of sweet potatoes. The pie was creamy,the texture was just the right, as was the sweetness. Pie baked in 50 minutes to perfection! I have my own wonderful pie crust recipe I use. This will be my only sweet potato pie recipe!

I have always been a Pumpkin Pie fan. I decided to try this out, b/c I do love sweet potatoes.  My big thing is the texture.  I wanted to make sure it wasn't "squishy".  Here is what I did. I used 5 small sweet potatoes.  I baked them instead of boil...way better, not watery, and it brings the natural sweetness out. (helps with texture)  I used 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream (helps with texture too) instead of milk.  I put a 1/2 teaspoon of the spices like normal, but I also put 1/2 tsp. of ginger, and sprinkled in ground cloves.  Some people don't think of salt, but just a 1/2 tsp of salt too, b/c salt brings out the flavor. For better texture, I also added about 1-2 tablespoons of flour.  I also used 1/2 a cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of the 1 cup of white sugar.  It was wonderful!  You have to use a deep dish pie pan for this or two smaller ones though.  I recommend the deep dish.  It makes a nice thick beautiful pie.

My first sweet potato pie ever and it was DELICIOUS! Extremely pleased with this recipe.  Some advice for those that found it too runny: 1) I added two pounds of sweet potato (two medium/large ones) 2) I did not boil the sweet potatoes (which adds water to it). Wrapped mine with foil and baked in the oven for 65 min at 400F. Gave it a much richer flavor. And the resulting consistency was perfect.  Also, I made my in a 10" tart pan - the presentation was gorgeous! And the directions didn't have to be changed at all (bake time and temp were still okay).

This is thee best pie ever!!  Very simple to make. Tips:  I used Bruce's canned yams (40 oz can).  I also added a touch of maple syrup, 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract.  Otherwise used same ingredients.  This yields 2 deep dish pies.  I used the frozen pie crusts.  To prevent your crust from being soggy, bake it for 5-10 mins before adding your mixture.  Top with nutmeg, cinnamon, and a sprinkle of sugar and voila!  Delicious!!

Very good!  Saving as a fav.  For anyone with issues with pie setting up if you boil the potatoes- let it cool completly before judging the pie.  If you cut  before it is completly cool you will think it will be a'loose' pie, but it wont be once it is finished.  I usually make my pie the evening before i serve it, let it cool down on counter uncovered for 1 1/2 then cover and chill over night in fridge( dont stick in fridge or cover before that time, if you do the steam  will be trapped on the wrapper, and water will drip back on the pie=soggy loose pie).  When you cut it the next day it will be picture perfect.  I also put the my potatoes in the processor after i boil them because i hate srings!

This is an easy, tasty pie. Follow reviewers advice and it'll get even better. Cut the sugar to 2/3 c. and use half white sugar, half brown. Add a tablespoon or two of flour, two tablespoons of lemon juice, and some cloves and ginger. Then you've got amazing flavor. Thanks Joyce, and all the reviewers.

It really is the we've ever had!  We didn't boil the pototoes though, we microwaved them so they wouldn't make the pie watery and it would be quicker.  Just scrub the potato, makes holes in it and the MOST IMPORTANT part ~ rub with oil . This will make the potato really soft and the skin will slip right off.  I did find the original recipe to be way too sweet , like others had mentioned.  The first time I made it I halved the sugar, still too sweet...this time I used 1/3 c and it was perfect.  You can still taste the sweetness, but it's not overwhelming.

Nice basic idea, however sweet potato pie has NO cinnamon, so that was omitted and only nutmeg and mace were used as is traditional. I also use no real measurement for heavy cream or half and half instead of milk, you only add what you need and depending on the moisture content of the potatoes it is different every time. Milk isn't rich enough. I also bake much like a pumpkin, raising the heat to 425 or so for about 10-15 minutes then lowering for the rest of the baking time. It's a good basic idea and with a few tweaks became incredible!

I've been making this pie for the last 4 years and I've yet to find another recipe that is as rich and delicious as this one.  My nana used to make a pie that tasted exactly like this so, needless to say, my family finds comfort in the continued tradition.  Thanks again for the BEST SWEET POTATO PIE RECIPE!!!

WONDERFUL! One of the best recipes on this site, and much better than pumpkin pie! I used brown sugar instead of white, used evaporated milk instead of regular, and added some cloves. I had no problems with the pie setting as some others did. By the way, I hate sweet potatoes - this pie is the only way I will eat them (and love them!). I actually made a double batch and froze one pie which we are going to use at Thanksgiving dinner.

Sweet potatoes are 'sweet' by nature and do not need 1 cup of white sugar.  I used 1/3 cup Brown Sugar, and it was such a fine improvement that I have decided to feature this improved version in my newest church cookbook.

This was very good.

The only change I made was to peel the 1 lb sweet potato, wrap it tightly in foil, and bake it in the oven.  That way I didn't have to try to peel a hot boiled potato...it just rolled right out of the foil ready to mash!

Absolutely phenomenal! My dad said this is the closest to my mom's sweet potato pie than any he's every had (and she was da best!!!)  I separated the eggs and beat the egg whites before blending them in (I guess I thought it would make the pie extra light). It's an extra step that you don't have to do, but the pie was very custardy and not heavy at all.  It also came out beautifully orange.  I used ready-to-use deep dish pie crusts too. Other than that, followed recipe to a "T". Thanks for this recipe! I love this website, I'm becoming known as a great cook...if people only knew my secret was AllRecipes.com!

Outstanding! Made it with Splenda and used skim milk. Cut the butter in half, only 4 Tb, and added 1/2 tsp grated fresh lemon rind, 1 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp cloves, a few shakes more cinnamon, and 2 Tb dark rum or bourbon (for a true Southern flair.) Divine, and practically guilt free (I removed the crust from my piece to cut back on calories.) Excellent way to get fiber, vitamin A (promotes skin and eye health) and antioxidants galore into your family, and if you use Splenda, it's a treat you can feel good about making them any time, and one that diabetics can indulge in without their sugar levels going off the charts. Be sure to chill well before serving, however, as Splenda can have an off-taste in warm items. Also delicious in a crumb crust made from gingersnaps (but more calories!) for variation. I'm sure it's fabulous made according to the ingredients given, but got to watch my girlish figure - HA!!

This is my second time making a sweet potato pie and I have to say this one was the ABSOLUTE BEST! For starters, I went through and read about 50-75 reviews and from that, this is what I changed/added: I baked 3 medium size potatoes, 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of light brown sugar, 1/2 cup of evaporated milk instead of regular milk, 2 tbsp flour, 2 tsp lemon juice, 1/4 ginger, 1/4 clove, 1/4 salt and a 9 inch deep dish pie crust. I hope my review help you!

This recipe is the same as my Grandmother's recipe I have been using for years.  The only difference I bake the sweet potatoes which seems to give them more of an intense flavor than the boiling. One note if you do boil cut the potatoes crosways in the middle, this will cut in two any of the long stringy fibers. to make a less stringy filling.

My first time every baking or eating a sweet potato pie!  Excellent!  Like a pumpkin pie, this pie can overbake - make sure to turn off heat when middle is still giggly - leave the oven a crack open with a wooden spoon and let cool off nice and slowly.  This is the FOOL PROOF way to avoid cracks in sweet potato, pumpkin, cheesecake, etc.  Actually anything custardy!!  Even leave the oven door entirely closed for the cooling - but make sure the centre is VERY giggly when doing so.  THANK YOU FOR THIS AMAZING RECIPE!  Didnt change anything other than upping the spices and adding 2 tablespoons of flour.

First time eating and preparing a sweet potato pie. I do not have anything to compare it to but it was delish! I took other reviewers suggestions and added 2 tsp fresh lemon juice, 3tbs flour to thicken,  1/2c brown sugar, 1/2c white sugar and substituted evaporated milk for milk. I used 3 large sweet potatoes and it was the perfect amount.  I also found the potatoes to be very "stringy" so I pushed them through a mesh strainer before combining with the other ingredients.  
Even my 10 year old son loved this pie - will make again.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a really good pie, but if you want a really great pie, sub the white sugar for 2/3 cup of light brown sugar and the milk for 1 cup of heavy whipping cream. Also make sure those half teaspoons of  nutmeg and cinnamon are heaping half teaspoons. I've been using this recipe for two years, and no one ever believes it's homemade (and there's never any left)!

I am a southern girl.  I was looking for a recipe that was close to my mother's taste and I think I found it. I made this recipe for our holiday after Ramadan.  It was a winner in my house. I made a small change-instead of using pie crust i used graham cracker crust and it was terrific!!!!

I am a true Southerner, and this is a true Sweet Potato Pie.  YUMMY!  I used evaporated milk instead of reg.  I omitted the nutmeg, as I didn't expect my young children to like that flavor.  Perfect texture.  Don't overcook.  Will "set" as it cools.  I used three medium sized sweet potatoes that I had baked for another meal.  Popped them out of the frig and peeled off the skin, couldn't have been easier.  This made 2 regular pies (not deep dish).  Thanks for a great fall recipe!

I made two pies for a southern friend for his birthday.  It was absolutely delicious.  I made one small change.  In one I substituted evaporated milk for just plain milk.  The one with evaporated milk was much smoother and creamier.

I have never liked sweet potato pie. But I guess that's because I wasnt the one who made it!! This pie is delicious!! This was my first time ever making a pie and my family loves it! Now... i did make  adjustments and have some tips for everyone.
1. Like other reviewers have noted, pre bake the crust a little to keep it crispy.
2. i used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. i did add just a little more brown sugar after tasting it for sweetness.
3. i used more fresh lemon juice than called for. it helps to brighten the flavor a little more and gives it a nice tangy flavor which works well with the sweetness.
The best advice would be to taste the filling as you go.Don't add all the sugar at once. Put in half and see if that's good for you because I've noticed a lot of you said it was too sweet. Add the eggs last if you're a little leary about eating things with raw eggs in them that way you can taste. the filling and add what you think it needs.

Best pie I ever made.  My Mom flipped, now I have to make it more than once a year.  Tip: to get rid of the strings use an electric mixer, the strings stick the beater and not in the pie!!!!

I just made this on Wednesday (9/26/12) for my Mama's birthday. She wanted a Sweet Potato Pie and this is the one I chose. She said "it's the best sweet potato pie I have ever had." So right now, (9/29/12) I am making her another as she just got out of the hospital. I felt like she need a boost and this pie sure did make her happy. I followed the recipe almost to a T. The only thing that I added was (I used 2 med sized sweet potatoes), 1 Tbsp of flour, 1/4ish tsp of ginger and cloves to the other seasoning. I didn't have a piece, but the rest of my family all raved about it.  And they are always honest with what they "really" think! Even the ones who don't eat Sweet Potato Pie. It did turn out beautifully. When I called to check my Mama, I asked, "do you want another Sweet Potato Pie" and she said, "Yes, I would love another that was the best pie I have ever had." Thank you so much Cougaar for such a delightful recipe that made my Mama so happy! I so appreciate you posting this!

Lovely! Fewer calories and elegant with the following changes:  Microwave potatoes - it's the fastest and most flavorful way to cook them - they can then be scooped out of their jackets in seconds.  Then:
1) halved sugar and only used light brown
2) reduced butter by about a 1/3
3) used evaporated milk
4) Combined all with an immersion blender - made everything smooth and creamy
5) baked crustless and poured into 6 oz ramekins, set in bain marie, for 45 mins.  
Served with a dollop of whipped cream. Very very good and assembled in minutes.

Great recipe!  I added 1 tblsp. of flour to mixture and increased baking time by 15 minutes.  I don't eat sweet potato pie, but my hubby loves them.  He says this was the best he's ever had!  I gave some to my neighbors and they said the same thing.  I have one in the oven as we speak.  I forgot to put the milk in, so we'll see if it turns out anyway!  Thank you.  I will definitely be making this one again!

I usually bake my sweet potatoes. I had previously baked several and then frozen the mash in 2c portions, so I used one of those. I also substituted soy milk and dairy-free margarine, but it turned out deliciously! No one would know it's dairy free!

Thanks reviewers for the modification tips. I strictly used brown sugar instead of white; evaporated milk only and increased the nutmeg. Then I used Marie Callenders' pie crust since my mom suggested a pie crust with shortening. "This is the best sweet potato pie I ever tasted" exclaimed by 81 year old dad. My 20 year old nephew concurred.

This pie tastes just like my grandma's sweet potato pie.  Although, I take the lazy way out sometimes and use canned sweet potatoes by warming them first then mashing...regardless if you use canned or fresh, this pie is a true winner.  None other compares.  Thanks Joyce!!!

Absolutely delicious!  I used 1 1/2 medium sized sweet potatoes and mashed them with a fork.  They were quite stringy, so I mixed all of the ingredients with my electric mixer, hoping the faster motion would help chop up the sweet potato.  It definitely helped.  The mixture will be very runny before you add it to the pie crust.  This kinda threw me off a little, but it bakes up wonderfully.  I served it at a dinner party with cool whip on top, and it was a huge hit.  Thanks for the keeper!

This recipe deserves more than 5 stars. I am not very faun of sweet potato pie
But for our church bake sale it’s a requested item for the holiday, so I went in search for a great recipe so I Went into my test kitchen and fell in love with this recipe, truly a great pie. I read a lot of the reviews and made some minor adjustments. I used caned sweet potatoes (just as good as the real deal) it was a 29 oz. can (1Ib 13 oz.)  As other reviewer suggested on previous reviews I added 1 tab of shifted flour to the batter and let me tell you, the pie was silky soft and just plan perfect!

My guests raved about this recipe. I did modify it following suggestions here:  microwaved the sweet potatoes then used 2 cups of pulp, added a tablespoon of RealLemon lemon juice when I pureed the sweet potatoes, used 1/2 cup each white and dark brown sugar; added 2 tbs of flour; used evaporated milk instead of regular milk; substituted 2 tbs pumpkin pie spices for the spices listed. I also blended it a little too long when I was making it - it had a mousse like texture when I poured it in to bake. This was fortunate - there were no strings in the finished product, and the texture was velvety and smooth. It took a very long time to bake - don't remember now, and I had to put foil around the edges to keep the crust from burning. Was awesome, and will definitely make again.

This pie is amazing!!  There is a local restaurant that is known for their amazing sweet potato pie.  This definitely rivals it!  Its not the same (I was hoping for a perfect match) but it is just as good.  One of my friends is trying her hardest to figure out what is in the secret recipe in town, when I brought her this pie we agreed it wasn't the same, but it was JUST AS GOOD!!!  We no longer have to search for the elusive recipe because we have a replacement.  Since I discovered this in November I have made 7 sweet potato pies.  Every time its a winner and a favorite.  Thank you VERY much for sharing this recipe with us.  No doubt, I will make again and again...

We make this recipe EVERY thanksgiving since 2005.  I tried others, but we come back to this one. Even the kids love it!!  Only thing I changed was adding 1/8C Bourbon to the recipe. Enhances a carmel undertone in the pie. Wonderful.

This is a quick and wonderful pie.  I started out making five pies for my family's Thanksgiving, and this year I am making thirty for friends and family members.  Thanks sooo much!

This was my first time baking a pie and it was exceptional. I would suggest that if your mixture comes out thin(because mine originally did), then add some all-purpose flour little by little when you are mixing it to make it thicker.

Living in North Carolina we take sweet potato pie seriously! This is an absolute dead ringer for traditional southern sweet potato pie! I use half and half instead of milk (if on hand) as well as a 1/4 tsp clove. I have tried using only brown sugar and half of each the only difference we can find is pie will be a bit darker but tastes wise use what you have on hand! My husband and children can not get enough of this pie! I have made 6 of these pies since last week! (2 in oven now my in-laws want one of their own lol) Enjoy!!

This recipe is better is easier to make than canned pumpkin pie recipes and all the ingredients are simple. But being called "sweet potato" pie, we didn't know if real sweet potatoes or yams were meant to be used so we tried both. Real sweet potatoes are off white in color and make the pie a light yellow custard look. The yams look more like a traditional orange colored custard pie. We tried the recipe several different times and tweeked the sugar back to 2/3 cup. Both types of "sweet potato" pies turned out wonderfully delicious! We also recommend peeling the potatoes prior to boiling and cleaning the mixer beaters a few times when beating the potato filling as the strings build up on the beaters. Also, letting the pie set or 'age' a day or two enhances the spices in the pies. This is by far the best pie recipe I have made!

I peeled my 5 little potatoes, wrapped each up individually in foil-- baked 1 hour at 400 degrees... then just dumped the potatoes in a bowl to mix with the rest of ingredients... I feel sooo accomplished! i've been cooking for years, & never tried a sweet potato pie.. this recipe is perfect.. just for adventure's sake (or maybe just for a "gourmet feel"-- i used evap milk instead of regular-- but i think the regular would give the same result!!)
YUMMY!

This was AMAZING! Perfect amount of spice and sweetness. I used 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar and added 2T of flour during the mixing stage to help thicken. We had to bake this closer to 70-75 mins for it to be completely done. MAKE SURE TO REMOVE THE "STRINGS" WHEN MIXING! -Your mixer should capture most of the stringy bits. Make sure you remove them for much tastier results. :) Thanks for a great recipe!!

This recipe sounds great. If this sweet potato pie is too sweet for some people I would add a half cup of white sugar and a half cup of light brown sugar.  I also use carnation evaporated milk it seems to make the pie creamier. Try adding 1/4 teaspoon of allspice and 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract to this recipe.  I love the flavor. For you coconut lovers you can add some coconut to this pie. I never measured my coconut but I would say about 1/2 a cup should be enough.

this sweet potato pie was outstanding!  i used about a pound and 1/4 of steamed sweet potato slices, a 50/50 white and light brown sugar mixture totaling 3/4 cup which was the perfect sweetness level, added 2 teaspoons of lemon juice as suggested, and 1 1/2 tablespoons of flour.  i baked it in a deep dish frozen pie crust for an hour.  the pie turned out perfectly sweet, the perfect consistency, terrific looking, and wonderful tasting.  this recipe is a keeper...thanks!

This pie was delicious.  I made it for a Thanksgiving dinner and everyone enjoyed it.  It is not as common as pumpkin pie, so that added to its appeal.  However, one big problem is that both pies took more than 2.5 hours to bake!  Possibly I had too much filling as I used 1 lb. of potatoes per pie, but the ingredients are a little unclear on that point.  My mother (a black belt in baking) suggested that boiling the potatoes also contributed to the exceedingly long bake time, and that I should bake the potatoes instead.  I will definitely make this recipe again, though.  I made one pie according to original recipe, and the other with variations suggested by other reviewers.  That one (with added flour) baked a little faster, but not much difference otherwise.  Up to you.

The recipe itself is terrific but instead of boiling your potatoes it is much better to bake them to hold all of the original flavors...

Not bad as written. One thing to take note of - TOO MUCH SUGAR. I mean, waaaaay too much sugar. I bought a 29 oz. can of sweet potatoes and drained them, then mixed with just 1/4 cup of light butter. Then I used 2 TBSP. of brown sugar, 1 tbsp. of flour, 2 tsp. lemon juice, 1/2 cup nonfat evaporated milk, 2 eggs, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, and 1/2 tsp. each of cinnamon, nutmeg, and all spice. I poured it into a 9-inch regular frozen pie crust and popped it into a preheated 425 degree oven. After 15 minutes, I wrapped the crust in aluminum foil and lowered the temperate to 350 degrees for about 45 minutes. Came out absolutely perfect. Try it!

This was my first sweet potato pie and wow, it's a winner!  I used 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice (recipe on AR) instead of the nutmeg & cinnamon.  Perfect spice to sweet combo.  My 2 medium sweet potatoes made a little over 16 oz so I just weighed the puree and used exactly 16 oz.  Thank you Cougaar for a fantastic, easy to make pie.  Since sweet potatoes are available year round here in the south, this will be on my table often!

I recently tested this out hoping I could find a recipe to really wow my family come Thanksgiving. I was skeptical but holy smokes, this is fantastic. In the weeks since I made the pie, I've found myself randomly craving it. 

I have one minor complaint, which is unrelated to the recipe itself. I only wish it had included how long it takes for the pie to cool. From the time I started boiling the sweet potato to the time the pie was cool enough to cut was over 4 hours. So next time I won't start making it at 6PM. 

Other than that. YUM. 5 stars.

I use a 1&1/4 pound sweet potato, 3/4 cup of brown sugar, 1 heaping t ground nutmeg, 1 heaping t cinnamon and a wee bit over a t of vanilla extract.  I also use a deep dish pie crust and sometimes stick a few marshmallows on top before baking.  sometimes I'll add clove or ginger.

We are a family of 6 and we all felt that this recipe was not very tasty at all. I served it warm just like I did with another sweet potato recipe and it wouldn't hold it's shape. Overall it just wasn't worth making ever again.

Great, solid recipe. The biggest fault of this recipe is it calls for white sugar. A perfect sweet potato pie should have brown. I use brown and this recipe becomes the best one I've ever had. I use 2 cups of canned sweet potatoes instead of taking the time to boil them.

I have been making this recipe for about five years.  The first time was for Thanksgiving Dinner, everyone loved it.  It has become a family and friend favorite. I did make some minor changes,I used evaporated milk and about half the sugar asked for in the original.  The recipe says it makes 1 pie, I have always made 2 pies.  GREAT RECIPE.  THANKS A BUNCH

My husband is a sweet potato pie fan!! He wanted a pie like the one his grandmother used to make for him. I am a novice pie baker. I never made a pie in my life! OMG! I found this recipe to make at Thanksgiving to surprise my husband. He's a hard one to pass muster on, but he loved this pie!! It was so easy to follow & the whole family wants me to make it again, even my pastor wants a pie, too!

This came out perfect.  I added 1 Tbsp flour and used half brown and half white sugar as recommended by other reviewers.  I also passed the pie filling through a strainer after everything was combined so I didn't have any lumps or strings.

My 1st attempt was a complete flop.  After 60 min the center was a lake of syrup.  An extra 30 mins
burnt the crust and the lake remained.  (One for the bin). All measurements electronically weighed & checked.  I will try again though! Read comment on photo 75 re: sweet potato.
I have noticed by the photos that the consistancy varies considerably from dense crumbly cake to denser cheese cake style.

Doubled the recipe for a deep dish pie. Followed the recipe pretty closely although I baked my sweet potatoes. Then I separated & whipped the egg whites as suggested by another reviewer, then added 1/4 teaspoon each of salt & ground ginger. My Christmas day guests said it was the best Sweet Potato Pie I've made!

OK, I don't actually have this in the oven yet, waiting for a pumpkin pie, BUT, have to stop myself from licking the spoon! This is wonderful! I dare say this will take the place of pumpkin pie from now on. Just delish! Hoping the family will go ga-ga over this like I am right now!

Mom taught me to roast pumpkin or sweets to keep the flavor in and water out. I use the microwave. They peel easy when cool. Also use evaporated milk. May need 3/4 cup since the potatoes are drier. I cut back the sugar to 3/4 cup since the sugar didnt leach out by boiling. Taste the batter then add more suger if needed.

I questioned the amount of butter on this recipe . . . seems like a lot, but followed the recipe except substitued evaporated milk for regular. This pie was really good. Whipped cream is a must!

I made a SUGAR-FREE version of this substituting sugar with granulated Splenda (Wal-mart's version is Altern, same thing!) I used imitation vanilla flavoring also. Turned out GREAT! I would recommend buying a pound and 1/4 of sweet potato as the potato loses weight when you peel the skin off. After the first pie was gone, I made 3 more! I'll make another one for Thanksgiving. Soooo good!

I must join the majority and give this recipe a "high" five! I baked this for Thanksgiving and my family and guests couldn't get enough, myself included.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used half white and half brown sugars, added 1 tsp. lemon juice and 1 TB flour.  I also used evaporated milk instead of whole milk.  If you like sweet potato pie, you'll love this one!

This is a very tasty recipe and similar to Japanese baked sweet potato dessert...I could not help snacking on the batter before baking it!  I used a food processor to make it smooth - otherwise strings will ruin the texture.  OR if you have the time...press it through a sieve for professional results!  I added a bit of cooking brandy for extra taste/flavor, and raisins.  For richer taste, cream can be used instead of milk.  I used 450g of sweet potatoes which turned out beautifully - not too runny mixture at all and no extra flour added.  I added a pinch of salt and maple syrup too...though it is popular here in Japan to add honey to a similar sweet potato dessert.

I have added cooked apples (in butter, sugar, lemon juice) to such a pie...and it was even more divine!  The idea was inspired by heavenly buttery smells in Tokyo station, the shop called RaPoPo

EXCELLENT FLAVOR!!!  Not too sweet for ME!  But, I had to take a star away because going into the oven it was still a little lumpy.  I mean I mashed, mixed, and even blended the filling (w/ an electric mixer) ‘til my arms became tired.  It took forever to bake too.  About 1 ½ hours.   Probably because I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk.  I thought it was too soupy.  Otherwise it was good.  I increased the cinnamon and nutmeg to a whole tsp, added a ½ tsp of allspice, and used ¾ cup white and ¼ cup brown sugar.  I will definitely make this again using regular milk, a little flour to get the thickness I like, and 1 tsp of lemon extract or some rum like another rater suggested.  Thanks submitter.

This pie is awesome.  It's *very* sweet though... I didn't even use a full cup of sugar, and next time I'll probably use 1/4-1/2C.

I used about half 2/3 sweet potato, and 1/3 pumpkin (boiled in the same way as the sweet potato). 

Note... you don't have to boil a whole sweet potato for 40-50 minutes.  Just cut it up into 5 sections or so, and you can boil it for much less time, probably only 15 minutes.  The skin is still easy to remove--it just cooks faster in smaller pieces.

Excellent!!  I consulted with my Auntie, and she had me bake the sweet potato whole (easily done in the microwave), add a little brown sugar, replace the nutmeg with additional cinnamon, and add 1 teaspoon of lemon extract. It turned out great!!

I wrapped the sweet potatoes in plastic wrap, and microwaved them instead of boiling to cut down on time (5 min and then turn, 5 min-turn, etc. depending on size).  A fork doesn't get all the strings out, but I do know there is something out there that does get them out-but I don't have it (LOL)I made this for my family and had to hide the rest for my scrapbookers the next day. Don't leave a fork next to it!

Great recipe. The only thing I changed was I baked the sweet potatoes instead of boiling. They come out sweeter, and I prefer the consistency.

Absolutely sensational. I'm on a non-dairy diet and made this with vegan "butter" sticks and vanilla almond milk. No one could tell anything was different. 

Pair this with "Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust" for pie perfection!!

Absolutely delicious! Based on other reviews, I add 1 tbsp flour and 1/4 tsp baking soda to the filling. I also use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Made this several times, always turns out perfectly. Cooking time for my oven is about 65 minutes to ensure the center of the crust cooks through.

This is delicious.  The only change I did was to use half brown sugar/half white sugar. Also, my baking time was at least 10 minutes longer as mentioned in the recipe in order for the knife to come out clean.  Will make this again for the holidays.

I've never had sweet potato pie before so I decided to make one and this was wonderful!  I've never been the biggest pumpkin pie fan (I've always thought it was a little too bland) and was hoping this would be a sweeter, more flavorful replacement and sure enough it was.  The only change I made was using 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, also I used two cups of mashed up canned sweet potatoes.  Loved it!!

This was my first attemp at making a pie from scratch. I was looking for a recipe that I could make with the things I already had in the house. I used canned (Bruce's) sweet potatoes, and mixed everything by hand (or fork). My husband doesnt normally like sweet potato pie, but he just said " its like a peice of Heaven' and wants me to make it for thanksgiving. I liked it too.

Never made Sweet Potato Pie before, and always wanted to.  This was AWESOME!!!  My neighbor brought me a crate of sweet potatoes from the field, I made 10 pies. Passed them out to neighbors, and coworkers, they all LOVED it.  Did make a few adjustments to the recipe, I followed it basically.  I used 3 large sweet potatoes, 3 eggs, 1/4 tsp. ground clove 3/4 tsp. ground cinnamon, 2 teasponns of lemon juice.  This was enough to make 2 pies (not deep dish).  Only had 1 friend say it was OK, he didn't like the texture.  But then he doesn't like Sweet Potatoes either.

My 1st time making a sweet potatoe pie and I did very well thanx to this recipe and the reviews. Based on reviews that made sense, the only changes I made were: instead of 1c white sugar I used 1/2c brown & 1/2c white sugar, I added 1&1/2 tablespoons flour, and used almost all (accept 3 pieces) of a 2 pound can of yams drained. Cooked only 50min and it was perfect. ** I added my own special touch w/ large marshmallows cut in half and placed over the top of pie and put under broiler for about 1min, and I put sprinkles of white sugar around rim of crust before baking.**

I baked this pie for Thanksgiving and it was absolutely delicious!. I boiled two larger sweet potatoes, instead of just one. I used the mixer on it's highest speed to "mash" the sweet potatoes before adding the butter. I used 1/2 c of light brown sugar and 1/2 c white sugar. I added a squirt of lemon juice and 1/4 t each of cloves, nutmeg, and ginger. I completely forgot the cinnamon, but nobody could tell. Instead of milk, I used evaporated milk instead. When filling the pie, I didn't use all of the mix because I thought it would be too much. I baked the pie for 55 mins and it was perfect! I served it the next day topped with a dollop of whipped topping :)

Having a grandmother from the south...and following the recipe completely...I know I will not make this again, when I first tasted it, it just didn't even taste right.  All ingredients were of quality products, so I know that's not the issue. This was a waste of time.  Store bought was better, and people actually finished that pie. I'm calling grandma.

I follow previous advice and added 2tsp. of flour. It came out beautiful in color and texture. My oldest son thought it was a bit too sweet. I had no problem with the sweetness but I do think I am going to add a bit more spices next time. Thank you for the recipe.

This is a great recipe, with a few tweaks though. For one, the amount of sugar it is calling for is WAY too much for my taste, so I reduced it to 2/3 cups brown sugar - next time, I may even go down to only 1/2 cup. I also used 2 teaspoons of vanilla, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and added 1/4 teaspoon ginger to it. I had two bags of fingerling sweet potatoes from my CSA, so I think I may have used more potatoes than asked for. I baked the potatoes instead of boiling them for better taste, less wateriness and more nutrition. Also used cream instead of milk, and added 1 teaspoon of flour and 1 extra egg yolk to the mix. Even though I'm a huge fan of butter, I will probably cut the amount by 1 to 2 tablespoons next time. But overall a great recipe, I will definitely make this for Thanksgiving.

This is such an easy and delicious pie recipe! I added 1Tbsp of flour whisked into the milk to thicken, I used half white sugar and half brown sugar, and I topped the pie with a 3" outter ring of mini-marshmallows in the last 20 minutes of baking.   AMAZING!  A great recipe for my husband who dislikes pumpkin pie!

I have made this a couple of times and everyone loves this pie, it is worth boiling the potato and then making the pie right away from there.  You won't be dissappointd when you make it.

This pie was disapointing...it is a good basic recipie but it is not nearly as sweet as some claim. I would add more sugar and add more nutmeg and cinamon to add to the flavor. If you want a pie that taste store bought this is the recipie for you, but if you want something that taste homade I would keep looking...overall it's not a bad tasting pie just not what I was looking for

Great recipe but you have to try roasting the potatoes instead.  More sweet potato flavor and healthier than taking all the nutrients out by boiling.

This was my first attempt at a sweet potato pie and I loved how easy this recipe looked so I gave it a go.  I used canned sweet potatoes rather than fresh and since I had a large can I doubled the recipe to make two pies, which is quite easy to do then you can simply freeze the second unbaked pie for an easy thaw and bake treat later.  Overall this is an awesome pie.  The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it's a lot sweeter than I prefer.  But a little sugar adjustment (for my taste) and this recipe is a keeper!

I served this last night to my inlaws.  My mother-in-law said it was "the best sweet potato pie she's ever had."  It was very good.  Nice flavor, light, almost custardy texture.  Excellent recipe.

Way too sweet and way too rich. Don't think I care for that much butter in pie filling. I think all that butter caused the weird globby texture. I had to bake it so long that the crust became hard as all get out. Wish I'd not wasted ingredients on this.

Excellent recipe. Made it for a family dinner. Most preferred it over pumpkin pie. Instead of baking the sweet potatoes, I wrapped each one in clear plastic wrap and cooked them in the microwave. Don't poke a hole in them. They'll cook perfect and in less time than in the oven. Time will vary depending on the size of the potatoes. Be careful when you unwrap them because of the HOT steam inside.

this was my first time trying this recipe it was great.I did a make a little minor  changes, I used 1/2 cup of evaporated milk instead of regular milk and 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar and also I used 1/2 cup of karo syrup. And I also made one with 1 cup of splenda instead of regular sugar for me because I can't use real sugar. but in all great recipes..

Great recipe; made it once following the exact recipe , then the next time I  used 1 can sweetened condensed milk instead of the milk and sugar. Same taste! I did add a little more cinnamon and nutmeg and a pinch of ginger. Thanks for the starter!!!

Wow! This is my favourite pie recipe and it's better than pumpkin pie.  I made it for Thanksgiving. The only adjustment you might want to make to this recipe is using 2/3 cup of sugar instead of a whole cup.  Although, if you like it sweet than use the whole cup.  I've tried it both ways and they both taste good. Also, make sure you're adding a pound of sweet potato.  I suspect people that are complaining about the pie not setting right and being loose haven't added enough sweet potato. I added a pound and it came out with a great texture and not the least bit loose.

This was my first Sweet Potato Pie and I really enjoyed this recipe. I read about the strings, but I was much too lazy to pick them out, instead I broke up the potato and put it in the blender. It worked wonderfully! Thank-you for such a yummy recipe!

Wonderful! I used 2 yams and added a lot more spice. It seems too runny once you add the milk but gets thicker as it bakes. For the crust I made a butter, flour, water and salt crust that was crispy and perfect for this creamy pie. Thank you!!

I have used this recipe on so several occasions and each time I get rave reviews from family and friends.  Last week I made 6 pies and ran out of butter so I had to use a little margarine and you could not even tell the difference!  If you are looking for a pie that is a true Southern Sweet Potato Pie recipe you've got to try this!  Joyce, thanks for sharing!!!

This is a good recipe except I used evaporated milk and no cinnamon! Some people may be using sweet potatoes(yellowish flesh) instead of yams (orange flesh).  I have always used yams in making sweet potato pie as sweet potatoes have always yielded a grainier, stringier pie and an unappetizing yellow color.

I have been making this recipe since I pulled it off the site two years ago. Joyce, it's wonderful. And I don't even like sweet potatoes. I found it has the best consistency after some refrigeration. I have also been adding a praline topping: mix 1/3 C brown sugar, 1/3 C chopped pecans, 1 T softened butter. About 40 minutes into baking time, sprinkle the topping over the pie then finish baking. A wonderful recipe!

Man! This recipe is absolutely fabulous. I just happened to have a huge sweet potato on hand and I really had no idea why. I'm just glad I did. The crust is sooooooo easy. Since the pie is for Thanksgiving,I knew I wouldn't be able to get my mouth on it, so with the left over crust and filling I made mini pies in a muffin tin. MMmm mmm. I just keep popping them in my mouth like tic tacs.

The first time I had a peice of Sweet Potato Pie (About 8 years ago) I thought it was the best in the world. Well I was wrong. This recipe is THE BEST!!!!! Honestly this was the first Sweet Potato Pie that I have ever made and it was AMAZING. I was worried it would be too sweet, but it was just perfect. As a matter of fact I think I will stop on the way home from work and pick up some more sweet potatoes so I can make it again. Thanks alot Joyce for sharing this wonderful recipe with us.

I just found out that my husband loves sweet potato pies.  I'm used to making soufles and so I thought I would try this recipe.  I tried to cut corners and used canned sweet potatoes and cut back on some of the sugar and it was great.  I also found out that my husband doesn't eat the crust.  He ate the whole pie, but left the entire crust!

This recipie was used for a cultural banquet for my graduate course in Multi-Cultural Education.  Having the African American culture as my assigned group, I chose this recipie. It was fantastic!!!  I made 4 pies and everyone went back for seconds.. Thank you for such a wonderful tasting pie recipie and for the ease of making it in today's hectic lifestyles we all seem to have.  The group requested copies of this recipie, and one fellow said it reminded him of his grandmothers cooking from Mississippi when he was a child.. Cudos!!

Iit's delicious just as written. Having used this base recipe for years, I will say that using only half the white sugar and using half a cup of brown sugar really does taste better (sweet potatoes are really sweet on their own). I usually make a slew of these at each holiday, so I boil or bake (depending on space) a lot of sweet potatoes at a time. Then we can use them for all kinds of things (they're SO cheap!). I measure 2cups of sweet potato for each pie with this recipe. I also like to add a pinch of ginger. I feel it balances the spices. Super easy pie and very forgiving. As other people have said, separating egg whites will give you a nice, fluffy pie, so if you have time, go for it. I have a lot of baking to do, so I do as these directions say and am still very happy with the results. Another piece of advice-if you are using store bought crusts because you're afraid to make your own-take the plunge! Pie crust is easy! Find a basic recipe on this site and make it. It really only takes a few minutes extra and makes a flakier crust. You can do it!!! Happy pie baking!

I doubled this recipe because my pie pan looked bigger than 9 inches, and it was the perfect amount of filling. I switch from white sugar brown sugar instead, added a full tablespoon of vanilla extract, a tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice in place of the other spices, and I omitted the butter. After the potatoes cooked I mix them with the eggs, milk, and other ingredients to finish them off in the blender so the texture had a perfectly smooth consistency instead of trying to use my mixing machine and risk having filling fly everywhere and not getting all the chunks from the potatoes out.  The taste was fantastic. I bake it for about 50 minutes on 350°, and the filling set perfectly.

We loved this recipe! As per others, I did add a tablespoon of flour, as the only milk I had was 2%, and the mixture seemed to be a bit thin. I also added some pumpkin pie spice and extra ground ginger and ground cloves. I always freshly grate nutmeg, as this adds the best flavor. Also, a pinch of salt elevates most sweet dishes. Thanks for a wonderful and very easy recipe. I did use a rolled up pie crust, as I felt lazy that day, but it was even terrific with that.

My first pie was made for Thanksgiving and was fantastic. My second pie was made for Christmas and my husband said it was probably the best pie he has ever had! It was better the second time around because we made the crust from scratch. This is a keeper and really deserves 5 stars but I don't rate anything 5 stars. Thanks Cougaar for a wonderfully yummy recipe!

Excellent flavor and texture.  Similar yet surprisingly lighter than a pumpkin pie (not as dense and heavy).  It was super simple to make.  No need to look any farther than this recipe for a terrific Sweet Potato Pie!  Thanks for sharing, this recipe is a keeper!

This is the closest rendition I've come to in regards to my late grandmother's sweet potato pie. I was a little doubtful about the amount of sugar but followed your recipe exactly; I'm glad that I did. Thank you for sharing. Happy Holidays everyone!

This was fantastic! I decided to try it because I had all the ingredients at home & my guests loved it. Much easier to make than the pumpkin pie I usually serve, and just as tasty! The pie is quite sweet - I will make it again but will cut the sugar a bit.

This recipe is FABULOUS I have made it several times and everyone loves it. Do NOT use store bought yams it doesnt set right it is not good. Boiling fresh sweet potatoes makes it perfect.... Absolutely PERFECT! My 7yr old and 6 yr old love this also and eat it all.

This pie was Delicious!!! I took the advice of other views and used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and keep everything else the same.  No more pie was left after dinner last night.  Will be making this again very soon.  Thanks for the recipe

Great recipe!  I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar, and added 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, because I just love the spice of ginger.  I also found that if you bake the potatoes instead of boil them, the taste is richer.  A trick I learned from my Mom is to go through the mashed potatoes before mixing them with the other ingredients and pick out all of the strings you can.  I know it takes a little time, but the result is a much smoother creamier pie.  Trust me, it's worth the extra work.  This pie gets rave reviews at my house.

This recipe was great! But If I may make a suggestion, make sure that you bake your pie crust a little while in the oven before putting the filling in. I did this, and it turned out fab! I also did brown sugar instead of white sugar. I preferred this.

Excellent!  My first time making sweet potato pie and I don't see any reason to fool around with other recipes.  I steamed the sweet potatoes to retain more nutrients and I used egg whites.   Rave reviews from the tasters!

This is the most amazing pie I have ever tasted! I did change it a little bit though as other reviewers did. I used only 1/4cup of white suger and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I also used 3/4 cup evaporated milk (as I had a little more than 1 pound of sweet potato) I also used a shortbread crust (buy at grocery store). I will definately make this again and again!!

This sweet potato pie is pretty good. I put a little cornstarch in mine to hold it all together. I only put a pinch of nutmeg in it. My grandma used to make the best sweet potato pies ever!

Very good! However, I have to give it 3 stars for a few reasons. 1. It was a bit too sweet. Next time I will only use 3/4 cup of sugar. 2. I took the advice of another reviewer and substituted the milk for evaporated milk, and I'm glad I did. 3. There was just not enough flavor and spice to this. I added 1/2 tsp. of allspice and a couple dashes of ginger, and that helped a lot!! All in all, I am thankful for this recipe, but unless I tweak it, it falls a little short.

Loved the recipe.  Was easy to follow and tasted very similar to my grandmom's.  I did add the 1tbsp of flour to thicken the batter and foiled the crust to keep it from browning to quickly.  Other than that...a keeper.

This is delicious! It definitely calls for too much sugar though. I cut it down to 3/4 cup (using a combination of succanat and brown sugar), and that was perfect. Thank you!!

I've made sweet potato pies before but thought I'd try improving my recipe.  This recipe received such rave reviews that I figured I'd try it.  It's good, but if you're from a family of sweet potato pie bakers (as I am), it's nothing to write home about.

I love this recipe and always use it.  My mom is a diabetic so I made her one using Splenda for baking, and it came out very good.  She loves it and those who ate it without knowing about the sugar substitute had no idea it wasn't made with real sugar.  Oh, I like to add a bit of cardomom to mine too.  Excellent pie.

awesome thanksgiving dessert, with a few changes. try using 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1 cup white, evaporated milk instead of regular, and adding an extra egg for a better texture. i also doubled the spices, and added 1/2 tsp. each of ground ginger and ground cloves. the 2 tbsp. lemon juice suggested by other reviewers is a must; it really upped the flavor intensity.

i haven't tried this recipe yet,i will.i will suggest that you only add egg yolks not the whites,so that the pie will thicken. You may not have to add flour.

Delicious! I've never had sweet potato pie before so I don't have much to compare to... but this was really good! This was also my first attempt at baking a pie. Some changes I made were: Reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup light brown (not packed) + 1/4 white sugar, added 1/4 tsp of ginger instead of nutmeg, and microwaved 2 medium sized yams for around 8 minutes each wrapped in plastic.. then scooped out the insides. Next time I make this, I will reduce the sugar even more, I feel like the yams are sweet enough on their own.

OH MY GOODNESS !! The best pie I have ever tasted.  I am 65 years old and have always baked pumpkin pies. My husband kept asking me to bake a Sweet Potato Pie.  Today I did and he ate over half of it.  Cannot wait to make for neighbors and family.  I used 2 cups of mashed canned potatos instead of fresh !! THe best !!!!!

I have such fond memories of my mom's sweet potato pies she made every holiday. She passed away when I was 17. This recipe tastes identical to my mom's sweet potato pie. It really IS the best :)

I made 2 of these this week, one for a co-worker's birthday and one for home. My husband said it is the best sweet potato pie he has eaten and he has eaten alot. He had 2 uncles in the Army back in WWII and they were both cooks and great ones at that! This was an easy, wonderful recipe that anyone can do and be successful with. I will be making these for the upcoming holidays for my family. I didn't change a thing to the recipe except doubled it to make 2. GREAT!!! You can't go wrong with this recipe.

Not only was this my first sweet potato pie, it was my first time baking a pie ever. It was amazingly simple, although I had some spillage while transferring the pan into the oven, it came out tasting amazing. I followed the recipe to the dot to be safe, but next time I'll probably use another small potato (I used a 1 lb sweet potato).

TOTALLY TASTY!! I never ate potato pie so I was a bit skeptical but it was easy to make and not at all time consuming (with my 3 little ones running around).I did add a tbsp of flour and a tsp of lemon juice as other reviewers advised. I knew it was a winner when my pickiest child asked for seconds!!

Yummy.. The only thing different, was that I halfed white and halfed brown sugars, and instead of fresh I used 2 17 ounce cans of drained sweet potatoes. Came out perfect. Thanks!

This Sweet Potato Pie is Delicious!!!   I have been making this sweet potato pie for over one year now, and everyone loves it and I have received many requests from others to make them one.  Instead of using milk, and vanilla extract, I use Carnation sweetened condensed milk, and brandy extract. The first time I baked the pie it was runny; however I have learned that it needs to bake 1hour and 50min, and it comes out Perfect!

This is my favorite sweet potato pie recipe and it is so easy to make. This is big hit with my family and coworkers. I sometimes add a little bit more vanilla and always use evaporated milk. Again, great recipe.

I have made 10 pies since Thanksgiving.  Only two of them I kept for us to eat at home.  Everyone loves this recipe!  I make two pies at a time.  Substitutions: use 1/2 the nutmeg; replace w/ cinnamon and use 1/2 white & 1/2 light brown sugar.  Place a thin layer of aluminum foil around the edge of your un-baked pie shell for a light brown crust. Bake 20 min. longer than suggested.

I would first like to say that I am writing this on Thanksgiving Day.  That fact alone should speak volumes about what I think of this recipe!  My family loves it!  I followed the directions closely, but I made the following adjustments:
1.	I boiled 6 potatoes.  Here’s why:  I wanted to make two pies instead of one and because I wanted to use a technique to make sure my pies had no strings.  If you cut the skin off just below the ring you will see if you cut the boiled potato in half, what you are left with is the part of the sweet potato that has less string.  This also means you have less potato, but the results are noticeable in your pie and less preparation of the pie batter is required.
2.	I whipped the potatoes with a beater before I added the other ingredients.
3.	I scooped the whipped sweet potato into a measuring cup to make sure I had exactly 2 cups worth (1 full cup worth of sweet potato per pie).
4.	I followed all other directions exactly except (1) I added 1 tablespoon of fresh squeezed lemon juice (1/2 tblsp per pie), (2) I used half white sugar and half dark brown sugar in the amount suggested per pie, (3) I used Keebler Ready Crust graham cracker crusts, and (4) I ADDED NO MILK AT ALL. I also made certain that I filled the pie crust all the way to the rim.  

The consistency was beautiful, the color was wonderful, the texture was amazing and the taste was outstanding.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great and very easy recipe.  I used Splenda instead of sugar (3/4 C) and added a spash of lemon juice and extra vanilla.  I also used a whole wheat crust.  Made for a diet friendly wonderful "birthday cake!"

Absolutely amazing. I think my dad got teary when he ate this because it reminded him of Grandma's cooking years back. We told my great aunt Maggie that we only used one sweet potato and she felt sorry for me:"Aww honey, is that all you had?" ! Anyway, this was great! I have made it probably 6 times this Christmas season. I love the idea of using a milkshake blender -- it keeps the stringy parts out of the sweet potato. I will definitely be making this again and again.

I had never heard of sweet potato pie before I met my husband.  His Granny Penny used to make this pie for him all of the time.  So I looked and found this one and my husband said "It's just like my Granny Penny's." This is the only recipe I'll ever use for sweet potato pie.

My dad's mom used to make him sweet potato pie all the time in North Carloina, but her recipe was "a little bit of this, and a little bit of that" so it was impossible for my mom to duplicate. I made this for him for his bday and he said it was the closest he could remember to Grandma's.

This was delicious!  I made my own crust, cut the sugar down to 1/4 of a cup, and added 2 T. of flour.  Very easy to make, and best of all, a bit healthier than a lot of the other dessert options out there.

Very yummy. I estimated the 1lb - peeled two sweet potatoes, cubed them, and boiled them until mash-able, then draining and mashing them - and I had enough filling for two pies, and it was delicious (and addictive - a friend and I finished the two off in two and a half days!)

This was my first pie and everyone said it was excellent.  It made enough for a 9-inch pie and 3 mini individual pies.  That giant sweet potato took forever to boil so next time I will use 3 little ones. Overall I don't know if it is even possible to improve on this recipe. I was very proud of my pie and have been elected to make some for Thanksgiving.

Great recipe - I halved the sugar and did 1/4 cup brown, 1/4 cup normal. Used evaporated milk instead of normal. Also bake the sweet potato instead of boiling - much richer flavour! Turned out perfectly, nice and silky! Will be making again :)

IF YOUR PIE FILLING IS WATERY TRY THIS----I love this recipe, but the mix kept coming out watery! I googled it, and stopped boiling the potatoes. I roasted them for one hour, peeled off the skin, broke them up into chunks and threw em in a blender with the 1/2 c milk the recipe calls for. The mix was very smooth, and I added it to a mixing bowl with the rest of the ingredients (only because my blender isn't big enough or everything would have gone in the blender). I baked the pie for about an hour and ten minutes. It came out perfect.
If you like your pie a little sweeter, add an additional 1/2 c sugar. My husband likes it sweet.

After reading a few reviews and making other custard pies this week, I decided to put 3 eggs in rather than the 2 it called for. To me, it made the pie perfect and the ingredients set up without any jiggliness or separation.

This is pretty much the same recipe my step-mom, a true southern cook, makes it is pretty close but she uses condensed milk and she roasts the potatoes at 400 for 30-45 or until a fork goes through with out tension...

This sweet potato pie is the bomb!  I made it and it was fantastic!  I made a few substitutions in the original recipe and it proved so worth it.  Instead of the white sugar, I did 1/2 brown and 1/2 white.  In addition, I added 1/2 tsp ginger and one tablespoon of molasses, yummy!

Ii doubled this recipe and made two pies.  My family loved it and couldn't believe it wasn't pumpkin pie.  I had to cover the crusts while baking as they began to brown too quickly.  Some home made whipped cream and it was super yummy.

I made a number of changes to this recipe, after trying it the original way. First, I bake my sweet potatoes. The flavor is much more intense.  Just prick a few times with a fork and bake at 425 until done. I don't like the taste of nutmeg in my sweet potato pie - it makes it taste like pumpkin pie. I add cinnamon, a little allspice, a little ginger, and a little ground clove. I also use brown sugar and maple syrup instead of white sugar. (We like ours very sweet!). I add a little whipped heavy cream to lighten it up, too. As is, it tastes kind of boring to me.

Made 2 of these for Thanksgiving. Followed the adivce of 1/2 c white and 1/2 c of brown sugar, and adding the flour and lemon juice.  My brother who loves sweet potato pie and has tried many different pies, said this was by far the best hes every tasted!! I have tried sweet potatoe pie in the past and didn't care for it, tried this one and LOVED it! Thanks!!! Only downside is I'll have to keep making it for him.

This pie is amazing! I used one HUGE sweet potato (almost 2lbs), and baked it in foil instead of boiling. I left out the cinnamon because it seemed unneccesary, I also used half the nutmeg (I didn't want to hide the delicate yet complex flavor of the sweet potato). I used heavy cream instead of plain milk (do it). Also, after I mixed the mixture, I blended it in the blender and then strained it, so there were NO lumps or strings, just creamy deliciousness! I separated the egg whites before adding the eggs to the batter, beat them until they were stiff, and then folded the eggwhites into the strained mixture. I didn't  have a deep pie dish, so i divided into two regular pie shells (which i pre-baked for 5 minutes to prevent sogginess). ABSOLUTE PERFRECTION. Let them cool for at LEAST an hour, then move to fridge (prevents condensation, therefore preventing looseness). The extra steps are worth it.

First time Sweet Potato Pie, and I loved it!  The 1 pound is a little vague.  I used 2 sweet potatoes just under 1lb each, that came out to about 2 cups mashed.  Perfect amount.  Nuke/bake the potato.  Boiling is no bueno for flavor or nutrients.  Use a deep dish pie crust.  Preferences: 1/2c white sugar & 1/2c brown is not too much sugar for 2c sweet potato.  Cream or evaporated milk instead of milk.  HEAPING 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and cinnamon (especially with 2c sweet potato).  BONUS recommendation: 2 tablespoons of bourbon instead of 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  I don't know why people complain about how long it takes to cook.  Mine was done in 50 minutes.  You don't want it to be cooked dry.  Don't worry about it rising out of the crust, it will go down.  Wonderful with homemade whipped cream.  I am a new fan of the sweet potato pie, and I feel no need to look for another recipe.

This was a good recipe - it didn't overly impress me, but it had good sweet potato flavor and cooked up nicely. I didn't boil the potato in the skin - I skinned them and cut them up to boil them more evenly and quickly. I also decreased sugar as suggested by others (1/4 cup brown and 1/4 cup white). I also decreased butter to 7 tbls instead of the 8. The pie cooked up solidly in the middle right at 55 minutes, and my toddlers ate it up.

I made this recipe with canned sweet potatoes (yams) and should have reduced the sugar since the yams were sweetened.  So, even though mine came out a bit too sweet, this recipe is definitely going into my "make again" file!  Sweet potatoes are plentiful, the recipe is easy, nutritious and delicious!

Wonderful recipe, I had never made a sweet potato pie, this was easy and delicious, plus I learned a great way to prepare sweet potatoes.
I substituted the white sugar for brown sugar, next time I will try the evaporated milk.  Everyone loved it.

This turned out perfectly! Not being American, I'd only ever read about sweet potato pie and my family were a little dubious at the idea of sweet potato being used in a dessert. But as Thanksgiving rolled around I saw more and more blog posts about different variations of sweet potato pie and I decided that I had to attempt to make one. I made my own pie crust but stuck to the original recipe for everything else and it was a definite hit! I have to make this again as it was surprisingly easy and very tasty.

As the daughter of a woman who made excellent sweet potato pie by feel - no recipe, no measuring - I made this with the following reviewer suggestions: I pre-baked the crust, but wish I hadn't - it was a little too crispy, I subbed brown sugar for half the white - glad I did, but could have reduced total sugar by 1/4, added a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and a pinch of cloves and I used evaporated milk. A tad bit sweet, but a darn good pie. After years of trying, I gave up trying to replicate my mother's pie and followed the Libby's pumpkin can recipe, using fresh sweet potatoes. This pie is better. Also - I always rice my sweet potatoes so that they are smooth and virtually string-free. The Libby's uses no butter and makes a very thin batter.
**UPDATED REVIEW - my initial comments were made after only briefly cooling the pie. Once it had cooled and set overnight, the sweetness was magically perfect!

ok- This is my second year making this pie.  My God this recipe is delicious. I can't say that I follow everything exactly as how it reads but I use the same ingredients plus brown sugar and add flour because I like my pie more on the stiff side so when you slice it , it doesn't fall apart.  I taste while I'm mixing adding this and that until I get the perfect taste. **Strong suggestion if you really want a beautiful taste- use ORGANIC SWEET POTATOES** I made two different pies this Christmas. One with left over organic batter from Thanksgiving and the other with the regular sweet potatoes. Did everything the same and I taste the difference.  You must try! It is simply delicious!

This pie is the best thing I've made from this site in a long time.  It had great flavor and the texture was perfect.  I didn't bother boiling the potato; I just microwaved it for 7 minutes and it was perfect.  I figure I got about 2 cups out of 1 large potato.  Per other reviews I used half white and half brown sugar, and added a couple tbsps of flour to the batter.  The pie was firm and set up beautifully.  It was a hit for our Christmas dinner; I'll be making this often during the fall and winter months.

This is excellent! I made a sweet potato pie for the first time using this exact recipe and everyone loved it and requested it again a week later. The second time I actually left out the nutmeg (I'm not a fan), doubled the recipe to make two pies at once and accidentally used three pounds of sweet potato and everyone adored it. I got a lot of compliments about really being able to taste the sweet potato. This is definitely the recipe I will use from now on.

Very good base recipe, but I made mine with 3 sweet potatoes instead of just one and I used half a can of sweet condensed milk instead of the large amount of sugar. It came out just as sweet and still retained the sweet potato flavor. I love this recipe! Can't wait to make it for Xmas!

Simply perfect, exactly as is. And EASY! I found that I had to cook my sweet potato longer than 50 minutes (it was more like 90 minutes) because it was fat, and I'm at a high altitude. I will be making this OFTEN. It's light and delicious.

This is my first time making sweet potato pie (and also my very second time baking, ever!) and this is a great recipe to start! I'm Asian so I used my rice cooker to steam the potatos to reserve the natural sweetness that is easily lost if you boil. Baking in aluminin foil is another option. I didn't rinse with cold water before peeling in order to preserve the sweetness. I used 1.75 pounds of potatos instead of 1 pound only. I used 1/8 cup of butter and would use no butter at all next time. I used 1/2 brown sugar instead of 1 whole cup of white. The sweet level is perfect!

Mmmmmmm mmmmmmmm! So delicious! Much better than pumpkin pie! And for a quicker prep time, try microwaving your sweet potato(s) in the microwave for about 9-10 minutes instead of baking. It is pretty much indistinguishable from baked in this pie!

Very tasty!  I followed others recommendations subbing some of the white sugar for brown and adding a little extra spice.  Also, because I was short on butter I only used 1/4 cup.  The flavor was delicious and the texture was terrific.

Just for time's sake I subbed out the fresh sweet potato for a large can (I mean large, it's almost the size of a new born child) of Bruce's yams in syrup, drained well you can just throw them in the mixer before the other ingredients and get them to a puree consistency. I double the vanilla and add 3/4 tsp FRESH grated nutmeg. This recipe has made my grandfather stop eating grandma's sweet potato pie, I might be in trouble! Thanks COUGAAR!

I live in the Canadian Prairies. And we eat a lot of Pumpkin pie here..not so much Sweet potato pie. My husband actually made this recipe as a surprise for me, as I love Southern Style cooking..and Paula Deen is my hero! LOL. This was outstanding. All the same flavors as a pumpkin pie..but this had a creamy velvety texture! We served it with some simple whipped cream. Absolutely amazing! We are making a couple to take home to our families for Easter. My husband (who is NOT a baker) said this was a very easy recipe to follow. Thank you so much for sharing. We will be using this again, and again! It's a keeper!

This pie is super moist and flavorful and gets rave reviews from everyone who tries it. (They're not just flattering me either, I know this because they were going around complementing it, trying to find out who made it :) I use 1 tsp. Pumpkin Pie spice in place of the cinnamon and nutmeg.

This is a very good recipe.  I have made this several times with a few variations.  I use exactly 1 pound of sweet potato.  Instead of 1 cup of white sugar, I use 1/2 cup of white sugar and a 1/2 cup of light brown sugar.  I use 1 egg, not 2.  I also add 1 tablespoon of flour.  As for the pie crust, I use regular pie crust not the deep dish.  There's no need to fill the pie crust all the way to the top of the pie crust with filling.  I also do not allow the crust edges to darken.  I allow the pie to bake for no more than 40 minutes.  Awesome recipe!

I was trying to replicate my Mother's sweet potato pie, and this was it! I hadn't ever attempted it, since I'm not good with pie crusts, but using pre-made from the store makes this a simple and quick recipe. I did bake the sweet potato in the microwave first (as opposed to boiling for 40-50 minutes) and my children and grandchildren loved it. Thought it was pumpkin pie at first!

This pie is very delicious..  and easy!!  I've made this a few times now... and here are a few adjustments we've made for our own personal preferences.  #1 BAKE the sweet potatoes first..  this makes a huge difference!!  #2 DOUBLE the measurements for the nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla.  #3 CHANGE to light brown sugar (only) and decrease to 3/4 cup.  My family LOVES this pie and I've received lots of compliments.  Enjoy  :O)

I'm not a fan of anything sweet potato. BUT, i did taste this before serving, and I have to say it was pretty good. My family devoured it for Thanksgiving. I'm about to make another for Christmas. I did NOT change a thing!!!

My husband loved this pie. I had extra mashed sweet potatoes after making my sweet potato casserole for Thanksgiving and decided I should make a pie. I picked this one because it was simple. I did bake my sweet potatoes and mashed them separately, so I measured out about 2 cups. Then went on with the recipe. I do think next time I will melt the butter not just soften it, didn't get mixed in all the way. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this turned out really well.  The spices gave it enough of a kick to make it stand out.  My only change was to do 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, but this would be good with just 1 cup of sugar.  In my opinion, the amount sugar can generally be changed based on your personal sugar/sweet tolerance level.  The boyfriend and his family loved it.

Great pie! I baked my potato before I mixed it up, a different flavor, but very good! I would reduce the sugar by 1/3.   p.s. substitute 1 tsp of the flour in the crust with either a tsp of cinnamon or allspice

Way too much sugar and way too much Vanilla. I know it's called " Sweet Potato Pie" but this is way way too sweet. Half the amount of sugar and Vanilla would be more than sweet enough. If your not a diabetic you soon will be after this. If you got a sweet tooth then this recipe is for you, haven't said that be prepared to make regular visits to your dentist.

This was the first time I have ever made Sweet Potato Pie. I wanted to try and impress my husband! I washed my (1) 1 lb sweet potato, poked holes in it, and wrapped in foil. I placed it in a 400 degree oven for 60 mins. Then I rinsed in cold water as I pulled the skin off. I used a frozen pie crust(let it thaw on the counter as I mixed up the ingredients-(I was very concerned about how runny it was!) and poured it into my pie crust. It filled my pie shell perfectly! It took a little longer to cook and for the middle to set up. I was afraid my crust would burn...but it didn't. It turned out great! It's less than 24hrs later and the entire pie is gone!!! My husband has already gave me a request for a second pie. This will be made often around my home!

Yummy!  I use a 9" deep dish pie shell. This pie is souffle like and has a nice soft texture, as described, which makes it really good.  I have lost count now how many times I have made this recipe. The only change I usually make is baking the sweet potatoes instead of boiling them. Every time I serve it I get told it is the best sweet potato pie recipe the person has ever eaten. It has been a nice change from pumpkin pie. It has a taste of its own. If you have never tried a sweet potato pie before, this is the best recipe! Thank you, submitter!

Just wonderful! I made it for Thanksgiving this year, and the whole thing got eaten in half an hour. Not too sweet, but still nice and rich. My yam weighed in at 1 lb 6 oz, so I was afraid that it might not all fit in the crust, but it just made a nice deep pie. I used my own crust recipe from Jeff Smith, and it worked beautifully. I did use half white sugar, half brown, and I was out if vanilla (that is a new one for me, lol!), and I added a pinch of ginger for depth. Thanks for sharing, this will be my new standard!

It was my first time baking and it was a success. I made 3 pies and they came out great. Instead of 1 cup white sugar, I did only half white and the other half brown sugar.

This is the best pie I have ever tasted and I don't like pie nor sweet potatoes! The only thing I change is upping the cinnamon and nutmeg to 1 teaspoon each because I like a spicier dessert.....I make this every chance I get and this has replaced our traditional pumpkin pie!

I made this yesterday because I had frozen, cooked sweet potatoes on hand.  I thawed them and drained off the excess liquid that accumulated.  I used this recipe but took other readers suggestions and added about 1/2 tsp. each of ground ginger and 1/4 tsp. ground cloves, used canned, evaporated milk and used 2 cups sweet potato pulp.  I also used 3/4 C. brown sugar instead of the white.  It turned out very good and my husband gobbled it up.  My reason for a 4 is twofold, first - it tastes almost exactly like pumpkin and not like sweet potato and secondly, I changed the recipe.  I liked it but I don't think it's the best out there so I'll keep looking but would recommend this one with reservations.

I made this pie for my grams.  It was a big hit.  I used two potatoes just to ensure that I had enough filling.  Otherwise, I stayed true to the recipe and loved the result.

This was the best sweet potato pie I've ever made. I used a thinner pie crust, so I able to get 2 pies from this recipe. One thing I did that I read from the reviews that I'd recommend is, instead of using 1 cup of white sugar, I used 1/2 cup of white and 1/2 of brown sugar. Also I'd blend the potato before adding any other ingredients.

I dont really care for sweet potato pie but apparently I wasnt eating the right ones.  This one was very very good.  I didnt give it 5 because I think the changes that others suggested made it better.  I baked the potatos instead of boiling.

I split the sugar to 1/2 white 1/2 brown.  Added 1 tsp ginger 1 tsp lemon and a little extra nutmeg and cinnimon.  
It set up nice had no texture issues

This pie is delicious. I made one today and it's almost gone! I did make a few modifications for personal taste. I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 3/4 cup white. I also added about a teaspoon of flour to thicken the mixture, but that probably wasn't necessary. The pie came out picture perfect. This recipe is perfect as is!

Very, VERY good!!! I added 3/4 cp white sugar instead of the 1 cup. Tried this recipe to see if it could replace pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving and it definitely will!!

Simply amazing!  Look no further.  This recipe is quick, easy and perfect.  I made the suggested modifications: evaporated milk, 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, 1 tbs flour, 2 tbs lemon juice, 1/4 tsp ginger and clove or allspice.  Note: microwaving the sweet potato is super fast and easy.  I used 2 cups of mashed sweet potato.

I made this pie. with a 1 lb sweet potato i ended up filling 2 shallow pie pans. i went a little over on the nutmeg and cinnamon, that did a good job of eliminating the excess sweetness. it set up very well texture was just about perfect. no complaints about this one at all

This recipe came out to be a big hit. I too took the advice of other reviewers and did the following: 1)used evaporated milk rather than reg milk 2)add 1-2 tblsp of flour to thicken 3)add a tsp of lemon juice to enhance flavor 4)added a tsp of ginger & allspice 

Right out the oven I didn't think it was done enough because it was a little "mushy"  for lack of better words but once it cooled to room temp it was the perfect consistency so be careful not to overcook. 

I was trying to find the best sweet potato pie recipe for thanksgiving and this one will be it. It's not too difficult the most time consuming part of preparation is baking or boiling the potatoes which took an hour for me. I used two big potatoes and it yielded two 9 inch pies. 

Thanks for the recipe! One less worry for thanksgiving dinner.

I doubled this recipe and had enough batter to make 3 delicious pies to take to my campaign meeting. The recipe is lovely just the way it is, but I had good results with the following additions/substitutions:  I used a 1 1/4 pound potato, which is a little bigger than the recipe recommends. I followed other reviewers in substituting 1 cup white sugar with 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown.  I also substituted evaporated milk. Instead of the nutmeg and cinnamon, I used 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice. I added 1 tsp rum extract and 3 tablespoons of flour.I served this pie with my homemade almond rum whipped cream:  beat 1 cup whipping cream until it begins to thicken, add 1/4 tsp almond extract, 1/4 tsp rum extract, 1/4 cup white sugar. Beat until it has firm peaks.  This will be enough cream to garnish one pie.***A little bit of sweet potato lore: in the Trobriand Island, yams (sweet potatos) are a currency and a ritual object.  If a young man and woman want to get married, her family bakes the couple a yam and they eat it together as part of the ceremony.  So make sure to share this pie with someone you love. ;)

I made this pie using some of the other reviewers suggestions (brown sugar instead of white, evaporated milk instead of regular). This was the first pie I have ever made and it was so easy! It wasnt watery at all, nice and firm and really tasty, not grossly sweet, just right.

I get excellent reviews on this pie.  I prefer it to pumpkin pie.  I found that blending the ingredients in a blender made for a smooth, creamy filling that I couldn't get by just mixing with a mixer.  It was also time-saving!

I took these pies to my in-laws whom I was meeting for the first time and they loved it. Of course, the best way to get accepted into a family is through their tummies.

I asked my Mom if she would like a baked sweet potato for dinner, and she said she'd rather have a sweet potato pie! Since I had never baked nor eaten one, I chose this recipe because it seemed the easiest. We loved it--it was very much like a pumpkin pie. I used unsweetened coconut milk for the milk because I needed to use it. I think I'll cut back on the nutmeg next time. Delicious flavor and creamy texture--great pie!

Sweet potato pie is a traditional dessert for Thanksgiving and Christmas in my household.  This is the best I've had in
forty years.  This pie is easy to make and the perfect consistancy.  My husband and three year old couldn't get enough.

I will make this pie every year! When I mixed this, I could have sipped it through a straw it was so runny. But I baked it anyway and I'm glad I did! I cooked it the night before Thanksgiving and it was even better the day after Thanksgiving.

My husband is from a small town in GA and I've gotten many baking recipes from my mother-in-law.  I didn't want to ask for her sweet potato pie recipe and that's what led me to this site.  I doubled this recipe and made these pies this weekend to experiment before Thanksgiving. There was enough mix to make four pies.  This recipe was soooo good that my husband and I ate two pies ourselves on Saturday and Sunday.  This is definitely going in the recipe book that I am passing down to my daughter.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

I made 2 of these for Easter.  I baked the yams (450 for an hour).  Then, pureed them in my food processor.  I used 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 Splenda, a little flour and lemon extract as recommended by other reviewers.  My family couldn't believe how good these tasted.  My brother brought a delicious italian whipped cream cake from his favorite bakery and they went for this one more, hands down.  Even sweet potato haters loved this!  Thanks!

I made sweet potato pie for my first time using this recipe. Everyone loved it, even people who usualy don't like sweet potato pie. Although I modified it with ginger and a grahm cracker crust.  I will be using this recipe for years to come.

Everybody loved this pie, however I used only 1/4 of the sugar!!!  I am so glad that I did.  My husband has a sweet tooth and he thought that it was sweet enough.  Try using less sugar and you'll really taste the flavor of the potatos.

I've never made sweet potato pie before, but I wanted to try something different.  This pie turned out absolutely perfect.  I took it to a Church Harvest Festival.  A number of people asked for the recipe and said it was the best sweet potato pie they ever had.  It was my first taste and I definitely prefer it over pumpkin.  Thanks for sharing.

Tried this recipe because it seemed so easy.  And it was.  But the best part is that everyone raved about the pie.  It wasn't too sweet and incredibly light.  Thanks Joyce to you and your friend for sharing it with us.

I brought this to a potluck and everyone loved it.  I think that every pie I've seen in the past was made from yams instead of sweet potatoes, this had a lighter texture and was a nice change.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Smells terrific while it's baking and the taste is amazing!  We topped ours with real whipped cream mixed with a little vanilla.  Yummy and well worth the baking time!  5 stars for certain!

Great recipe! Instead of butter I put coconut oil which gave a more flavorful taste. I also ever out some ground pumpkin spice which gave it a more autumn feel. Thanks!

I really am debating on wether to give this recipe 4 or 5 stars.. I personally thought it was a but too much sugar. But then when an "enemie" of mine was ranting on how she loved, loved,  loved it! And absolutely needed the recipe and to see the look on her face after everyone told her I made it..... priceless :)

I made this pie for "Friendsgiving," so it had to stand up to a whole array of pies that others had brought.  Taking the advice of others, I used two large sweet potatoes and roasted them at 400 degrees for an hour and 10 minutes.  I also substituted evaporated milk for the regular milk and used half brown/half white sugar. It baked up wonderfully and set after cooling completely. The party was the next evening, and I wish I had let the pie sit out at room temperature until then, because the crust got a little too soggy for my liking. So my tips are: use the substitutions recommended by many other users, avoid refrigeration, and roast-don't boil-your sweet potatoes.

It was fun and easy to make. I made it for the first time yesterday and it was perfect! I just made 2 changes, I used Evaporated Milk and Added Crushed Pecans to the bottom inside of my pre-formed frozen pie crust. It was delicious!!!

After losing my own pie recipe I came across this one. I must say this gives the meaning to less is more. I Changed just a few things. Instead of regular milk I used evaporated milk and I beat my eggs before adding to mixture. I also doubled the recipe to make 2 pies but I only add 1 1/2 cups of sugar. It was perfect and my husband loved it. Also be sure to beat potato mixture well to remove the strings and it makes for a smoother, creamier pie.

I had never made sweet potatoes before but had three or four of them. Found this recipe and tried it. Made a delicious sweet potato pie for Thanksgiving dinner.  Very easy to follow. I did microwave the sweet potatoes as others suggested. I worried it wouldn't set, but it was great. Nice firm texture and yummier than Pumpkin.

This is a good recipe, the one thing I found was to buy the biggest sweet potato, big as a softball. Boil until potato is soft, very soft, all the way through, cut off not just the skin but almost the first quarter inch deep, which may be brownish, by doing so you eliminate most all of the stringy stuff.

This was delicious! I should have boiled my sweet potato longer but didn't mind that the filling wasn't perfectly smooth because the flavor was great. We had this for dessert and again for breakfast this morning. It didn't take much extra time to make the crust from scratch while the potato was boiling and was worth the effort.  I will be making this again very soon.

Fantastic! I used half brown sugar and half white. I think that I will cut down the sugar to about 2/3 cup though, as I thought it was a little too sweet. I used 2 cups of sweet potatoes and used by 9 in deep dish pie pan and it was too thick. It took almost two hours to cook. I will 1.5 times it next time and make two smaller pies.

I just took it out the oven 20 minutes ago on our Family Movie Nite snack break.  I made it because my husband requested a SPP.  I had NEVER baked one before.  He loved it...eyes closed mmmm mmmm mmmm loved it!!! I did use 1/2 brown- white sugar and cream instead of milk. Also, I don't like cinnamon very much so I omitted it.  He's had two slices, I packed 2 for his lunch tomorrow (his request) and there are 4 pieces left.  They will be gone by this time tomorrow!  Thanks from TN!

My husband prefers sweet potato to pumpkin so I turned to AR to find a "from scratch" recipe.  It has a wonderful creamy, yet toothsome feel and rarely survives a holiday meal.  I follow this recipe as written except that I egg wash my crust before I put the filling in and my pie turns out perfect each time.

Amazing pie!  I substituted one cup coconut sugar for the white sugar, used goat's milk and goat's butter and a gluten free pie crust from Whole Foods and it was delicious!  So easy to make.

Top notch recipe!!!! I have made this MANY times. I add 1 TB lemon juice to heighten the flavor and a TB of flour as a thickener. I also use more sweet potato than the recipe calls for, my family likes it this way...slightly healthier and less sweet. I beat the sweet potatoes very long in my stand mixer to get them super smooth and remove all the strings, which stick to the beaters. This is a great option when you want a delicious and nutritional dessert!!!

I loved this recipe!  It is super easy to make and is incredibly delicious!  I used frozen tart shells and made them that way.  The recipe made 24.

Very smooth texture but much too sweet. Will try again with half of the sugar.

Yummy! This recipe was so easy and the end result was delicious.  Followed the recipe exactly and thought the sweetness was just right.  I did separate the eggs and beat the whites as someone recommended.  Cooking time was 70 minutes but this is a function of my specific oven. Will make over and over and over.

This was DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!. I did follow the suggestions mentioned by using 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white. I also added 1 tbsp of flour to mix and used a half of stick of butter instead of 1.

I have been making this Sweet Potato Pie recipe (my first) for the past three years. This year was the first time I tried to do it and the store wasn't sold out of fresh sweet potato, I always had to get the canned ones. Wow what a difference. My family loved the fresh sweet potato version so much better. I keep getting compliments. It's really just night and day switching from canned to fresh. =)

absolutely delicious! this was my first time making sweet potato pie and it was great...one day later and my husband and i already devoured it! i took others' advice to add 1 tbsp lemon juice and some flour to thicken it up.

made the recipe almost as it, but i have two issues with this recipe -- first and foremost, the recipe does not specify that you need to use a DEEP DISH pie crust! i got regular 9" pie crust and the filling was enough for two regular pies (luckily i had two). also, the filling was extremely liquidy, and i ended up adding more than the recommended 1 tbsp of flour for thickening...more like 4 tbsp! it came out just right though.

will be making this again!

this was an ok pie.  maybe i just don't get pies like this b/c i haven't found a pumpkin pie i like either.  with plenty of marshmallow frosting this was good but i still think sweet potatoes are way better in any other form.  I love sweet potatoes mashed, baked or in a casserole but in pie they are at best ok.

I have never been a fan of sweet potato pie and I guess that's because they haven't been using this recipe! This was the first sweet potato pie recipe that I have ever used. The whole family loved it. I baked a 1 pound sweet potato for about 1 1/2 hours instead of boiling. I followed the recipe exactly besides that! Loved it! I was concerned because the mix was thinner than I thought it should be before pouring it in the shell. It turned out perfect, light, and beautiful. I made 3 more! Its going in the LOVE pile! Thanks!

Great recipe.  I substitute 1/8 cup sugar with 1tbsp molasses.  Not quite as sweet and it deepens the color a bit.   Works great with Samart Balance instead of butter if you want to reduce the fat.

I am not a fan of sweet potatoes, but my husband requested a sweet potato pie.  I followed the recipe with the exception of using 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar and baking my sweet potatoes.  I was going to add a few tbsp. of flour as suggested, but I forgot.  I just tried a piece, and must admit, it is surprisingly good.  My husband said it was the best sweet potatoe pie he had ever had.  I will certainly make this again.  It was a huge hit!

YUM!  And ALL THREE of our small children ate her piece in 10 seconds flat!  The only change I made was to split the sugar 1/2 white and 1/2 brown. Great for breakfast too!

I never liked sweet potatoes, but my boyfriend got me thinking about trying them.  He told me of the ingredients his grandmother use to use to make her sweet potato pie and this recipe popped up.  I did change the recipe as suggested by  someone else on here. I use half white and half light brown sugar, evaporated milk instead of regular milk.  He absolutely loved it!!!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  : )

Amazing.  This was the first pie I've made and it was a great choice!  I used 2 regular sized sweet potatoes.  Per the reviews I read, I used evaporated milk, instead of regular.  And I used 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar.  It's similar to a pumpkin pie, but so much better!  We served it with home-made whipped cream.  Excellent!

This is delicious.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe, and both my family and my boyfriend's loved it more than our usual pumpkin pie!

I made this for my husband and he loved it. I used canned sweet potato instead of baking one to spead the process up. Delicious.

Great Recipe, but I change a few things based on what others said. I did use 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar, and added 2 TBSP lemon juice and 1/4 tsp cloves. Also I used heavy cream instead of milk.  My boyfriend loved this, and supposedly he is very picky about his Sweet potato pies. We decided next time to use the evaporated milk to try to get it a little sweeter, and use a Gram Cracker Crust

This was my first pie ever and it was a huge success! I followed the recipe exactly except for one little change. As another reviewer mentioned, I put a teaspoon of flour in with the mixture to give the pie more structure. I am really glad I did because I think the pie would have been too soft without it. Thanks for the recipe! Perfect for Christmas. =)

i have just made this and i have to say it was excellent. i boiled one large sweet potato and two smaller/thinner ones. i found this enough/equal to one pound. i would suggest omitting maybe 1/3 of the cup of sugar - it was a bit too sweet, but the filling overall tasted delicious! i set to baking time to 56 minutes, checked to see if it was ready, then baked it an extra 3 min. thats an easy way to make sure you dont overcook the pie also, i used a pre baked pie crust and it turned out a little burnt, but made for a crunchier, tastier crust . delish!

Just made this pie for the first time today on christmas eve. This pie set up nicely. But I did add some more cinnamon and nutmeg. I managed to get two pies out of this filling because I had a huge sweet potato.

Lost my recipe for SP Pie therefore had to find one that was similar.  This one was absolutelyAMAZING!!!  Made two pies for a small gathering and there was none left after about 30 minutes.  Microwaved my potatoes in plastic wrap for about 10 mins to save time.  This will definitely be my "go-to" recipe from now on.  Thanks.

Very easy recipe! I use white sweet potatoes, and double the recipe. I split the sugar, 1/2 white, 1/2 brown. Everyone begs me to make this! I find i need to cook it a little longer than it says, but it's delicious! After reading the reviews, I'm going to try the 2 tbsp flour, and lemon juice.

The pie turned out okay.  I don't think my sweet potatoes were of great quality, so that may have been the reason it wasn't great.

Made this for Thanksgiving. It was the first time I've made sweet potatoe pie and it turned out very tasty; obviously way better than the kind you would buy at the grocery. My tweaks for the recipe (per other's suggestions) were to use 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white, add 1-1/2 TBSP lemon juice, and 3 TBSP of flour to thicken it up. Adding the flour defenately helped because the pie set well. After those changes, I followed the rest of the recipe as written.

This pie is delicious! I made this for a work potluck and everybody loved it. I read the comments here and did make a couple changes to the recipe, i added 2 tablespoons of flour, this really helps with the consistency, and 2 teaspoons of lemon juice. The flavor is amazing.

This was the first time that I have ever baked anything, and it turned out DELISH! My husband said it was a bit sweet, but he's not big on sugar much anyhow. Myself and a few friends found it to be just perfect, and it quite quick and simple for a beginner as well!

I made this pie yesterday and one is almost gone already.  If you follow instructions to the T, it will be one of the best you ever had.  I can see the difference when you boil the sweet potatoes in the skin.  OMG its just delish, nothing more to say...Thanks for sharing...I will pass this recipe on to friends and family!!!!

Delicious!!! This too is my first sweet potato pie. I decided to give a try to see if its what everyone is saying it is. Well now I know and I will be baking more tomorrow for ThankGiving. I also used 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and also canned milk instead of regular everything else exact.

This pie is fantastic!  I was lazy and used a 1 lb can of candied yams instead of boiling 1 lb of sweet potatoes.  I also used a store-bought frozen pie crust that I used right out of the freezer instead of making my own crust.  I drained the yams and followed the remaining instructions to a T.  I also used a stick of real butter instead of margarine.  It took a while to bake, and it never set the way I thought it would (knife would not come out clean even after 10-15 extra minutes of baking), but once it cooked, I refrigerated it overnight, and it was outstanding the next day.  Such rich, delicious flavors!  I definitely love this more than your standard issue pumpkin pie, and it will become a staple dessert in this family!  Thanks so much for this great recipe!

I used buttermilk vs regular milk because I had some to use up, and I used half brown sugar half white sugar. I also added a bit of ginger. It was fluffly and delish! I served it with my spaghetti squash and Moose Meatballs. Perfect fall combination!

This is my first review on Allrecipes, and I must say this is one of the best pies I have ever made, if not THE best. I am a native Georgian, and I don't think I have ever tasted a better 'potato' pie. Couple of changes that I made: organic sugar, the sweet potato was about a pound and a third, and the milk was 1 percent, and I added a pinch of salt. Because I don't have mixer, I mashed the ingredients, then used a stick blender whisk attachment. Not too sweet, not too oily, very fluffy texture: Just perfect.

This is AWESOME. And so easy!  I followed the recipe closely, subbing coconut milk for milk due to my friend's lactose allergy.  (Couldn't taste the coconut, and it still set up perfectly.)  Instead of the 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, I used about 1/4 tsp. ginger, 1/4 tsp. coriander, and a pinch of cinnamon.  PERFECT.

MMMMMMMM  My boyfriend never had sweet potato pie before so I decided to bake this for him.  We really enjoyed it-not too sweet and very easy to make. I used 2 medium potatoes and a frozen crust, turned out great. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

Delicious! try this recipe you won't regret it. My husband is not one to have seconds especially when it comes o dessert but not only did he have seconds the pie was gone in less than an hour. I only made a few substitutions. I added 1 tbls of  pumpkin pie spice I didn't have nutmeg and cinnamon on hand I also took the suggestion of another review and added 1 tbls of flour in order to thicken up the mixture a bit. I did 1/2 cup of white sugar & 1/2 cup of brown sugar & replaced regular milk with evaporated milk. I've made this pie twice in one week the first time I added 1 tbls of lemon juice as suggested by another member the 2nd tome i omitted the lmn juice.I found that adding the lmn juice cuts back on the sweetness of the pie. I enjoyed best with no lemon. This pie is smooth,silky and melts in your mouth. I used the Stater Bros. brand pie crust.

This was the hit of our Thanksgiving. Turned out absolutely wonderfully. Was voted the "best pie 2009" at our large family gathering. One guest commented, "This is the best sweet potatoe pie I've ever had."

I did what a reviewer said and used part sugar and part brown sugar (because I was out of white sugar). I used canned pureed sweet potatoes because that is what I had on hand, so I didnt add butter. It came out delicious.

PHENOMENAL! It tasted better than my grandma's!  As other reviewers, I made these adjustments:  1. Used sweetened condensed milk (Eagle Brand) instead of regular milk  2. Wrapped sweet potatoes in foil to bake them for 65 minutes at 400 degrees  Removed skin, then blended sweet potato in blender to remove the strings.  3. Used 1/2 cup of organic sugar ("Sugar in The Raw") instead of 1 cup of white sugar.  4. Doubled the spices.  5. Added 2 tablespoons of flour to the sweet potato mixture.  6. Baked the thawed pie crust (itself) for 12 minutes.  I had a deep dish pie crust, and the filling was  enough for one deep dish (I used 4 medium sized potatoes). I'm cooking another one today!

This is a great basic recipe that is wonderful when made as written, especially for beginners. It's also a very good starting point for more expert or adventurous bakers.  I've made it several times, always 2 at a time, because they go quickly. :) Replacing half of the white sugar with brown sugar is nice. I also increase the amount of spices to my liking.  The pie turns out fine with milk, and better with evaporated milk or half and half.

I find half and half or cream better than milk (perhaps not as good for us, that's understood).  This recipe was quite good but I did use half and half.

Tried this recipe after losing mine.  It's perfect except while you're mashing the potatoes, remove the beeters 5-6 times if not more and remove the "strings" from the beeters.  It makes for a much smoother pie.

This was my first-ever sweet potato pie and I agree with some other reviewers that there was something just not right.  I followed the recipe exactly - I then looked at my old "Joy of Cooking" and it notes that for a fluffier, more custard-like texture you'll want to use THREE eggs for this pie rather than two.  I will try three in the future.  Two rookie mistakes - when I was boiling the sweet potatoes (I used two) I failed to turn them in the water so only one side was fully cooked - make sure to turn them!  I will try baking the potatoes in the future as I have heard that brings out the flavor more...finally, I skimped and purchased one of the generic-brand roll-out pie crusts - will not do that again.  Either spend the extra buck, if you can, and purchase the Pillsbury brand refrigerator crust (the best) or just make your own.  The generic one just tastes...generic....Definitely plan to serve this with whipped cream...

This was my first sweet potato pie, and wow! I followed the recipe for the pie, and it turned out beautifully - although I can see how adding two tablespoons of flour might help the filling to set better. I did add a Caramel Pecan topping to the pie before baking. It turned out like a dream:  Caramel Nut Topping (from cooks.com) 1 c. chopped pecans 1/4 c. butter, melted 1/4 c. light brown sugar  This pie will be a new family tradition.

I really enjoyed this pie, however, found it just a tad too sweet for me. I reduced the sugar down to 2/3 cup, but next time I think I'll only use 1/2 cup. Also, I think I'll use brown sugar instead of white. Another thing, I think the nutmeg was just a bit strong, so next time I'll reduce it down to 1/4 of a teaspoon. But, overall a very good recipe and I'll definitely use it in the future!

OK, so for those of us who don't know what 1 lb of sweet potato looks like, it is about 1.5 large sweet potatos.  I made it with 2 whole large and it was just a bit too much.  I followed this recipe to the letter and it came out really good.  Very sweet, will maybe try using 1/2 cup sugar next time.  Great alternative to pumpkin pie, and sweet potato is very good for you.  I cooked mine the whole 60 min, and it still looked mushy in the middle, but the toothpick came out clean.  So it may be decieving, after a little while of sitting on the counter it totally came together and I am very happy I didn't leave it in the oven for any additional time.  All in all a very easy, enjoyable recipe that I will surely make again.  Thanks!

This recipe was delicious. I used three sweet potato's and made two pies with the ingrediants listed. I seemed a bit much to me to use 1/2 cup butter and 1 cup sugar on just one potato. I also added more cinnamon and nutmeg. I baked the pies for one hour. I will definitely be using this recipe often.

Very Good Recipe and great teasting pie. I did take the advice of other reviewers and made the following changes. I use evaporated milk instead of regular milk. I add a 1/4 tsp of cloves and ginger and 2 tbsp of lemon juice. The lemon enhances the tast of the potatoes. I halve the white sugar and replace with brown sugar. Last, I also added a 1 tbsp flour to the mixture to thicken up a bit and I still found the mixture & Pie to be runny.  I may need to cut down on the evaporated milk or add additonal flour.

Wow. I've never baked a sweet potato pie before and I wanted to make sure the consistency was firm. This recipe does the trick. I've since made a yam version of this and it's just as good.

This was the first time that I made sweet potato pie and it came out delicious. I read all of the reviews wondering whether or not I should substitute this for that, etc., and I decided to follow the recipe as is. Well, it came out perfect and was a big hit.

This was amazing! I made a few changes- I used margarine instead of butter (cuz I didn't have any), I added a half teaspoon of ginger, and I roasted the sweet potatoes in the oven just to amp up the flavor. All in all this was the BEST sweet potato pie I've ever tasted!

This recipe is very similar to the one I use, give or take a few minor things. One thing I don't like is stringy sweet potato pie.  My mom taught me to beat the potatoes and then take the beaters and shake off the excess strings into the trash.  Trust me, you will see them.  Also, since you're losing some of the potato, it might be a good idea to just cook an extra one to make up for it.  Hope this helps someone.

Never tasted sweet potato pie before. This was exceptional. If you are burned out on pumpkin this is a great substitute. In fact this may replace our pumpkin pie next Thanksgiving. Very earthy and smooth!

This was my first experience with sweet potato pie,
and it turned out good as written, but it was way
too sweet, to me. I made it again cutting the sugar
in half and using evaporated milk, and it was to die
for! 5 stars and highly recommended!

All I can say is... wow!  I've always thought pumpkin pie was gross (something about the consistency and the spices), and I've never been able to eat more than a bite of plain sweet potato (sweet vegetables aren't my thing).  But this pie is freaking awesome!!  Like, "I could eat half of it right now" kind of awesome.  If you're like me and never got the hang of pumpkin pie, PLEASE give this recipe a try.  I've heard people say that they're pretty much the same, but that is so not true - this pie is much lighter than pumpkin and the flavor (probably due to the stick of butter) is soooo much better!  I can't believe I found a traditional Thanksgiving pie that I actually like!  I did modify this recipe a bit - I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup, and cut the spices to 1/4 tsp. each so that it wouldn't remind me of pumpkin pie.  Turned out perfectly sweet and with just a hint of spice to add to, but not overwhelm, the flavor of the custard.  Glorious!!

This turned out pretty good.  I quadrupled the recipe & made 4 (deep dish 9") pies.  I did use evaporated milk, half brown sugar & a dash of lemon juice.  I peeled the potatoes 1st, then boiled them.  I also used a potato ricer to get all of the lumps out.

Others have said that the pie is too sweet, but I added a little more sugar & it was still not as sweet as I would have liked it.

Thank you SO much for posting this recipe!  I am not a fan of pumpkin pie and I was looking for something different and came across this.  I took the other reviewers suggestions and changed the following: 1) evaporated milk instead of regular, 2) I cut down on the sugar since I don't like things too sweet and used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, 3) 2 tablespoons flour, 4) 1 tsp. lemon juice, and 5) I added some extra cinnamon.  Oh, I also used 1 large and 2 medium sized sweet potatoes and blended everything in the food processor.  I ended up with two pies, but that was fine.  To garnish it, I topped it with candied pecans.  The pie turned out SO good!  Even my brother, who is an avid fan of pumpkin pie and refuses to eat anything else, admitted that it was really good.  Thank you again!

I loved this pie and I do not like sweet potatos. I made this for my boyfriend who loves sweet potatos and pies. He never had a homemade pie not from a can and he loved it! I read other reviews about adding flour, I added 1 Tablespoon and let it cook about 65-70 minutes. Turned out perfect and the middle was completely set. I am now going to make about 3 more pies for friends and family for thanksgiving.

Loved it. The sweetness of this pie it perfect for my taste. I don't like pie that are too sweet.  This pie tastes better than what I brought from a local farm.  I didn't make nay change to the recipe.

Wow!  Absolutely amazing!  Everybody loves this pie and even some of our punpkin pie lovers like it more than pumpkin pie!  It was the perfect consistency and flavor.  I will definitely make it many more times through the years.  I added 1 tsp of lemon juice and 1 1/2 tbsp of flour.  I also cut the sugar to 1/3c white sugar and 1/3c brown sugar and blended the potatoes by themselves before adding the butter.  I also used a frozen marie calenders deep pie dish and I had a little of the filling left over.  This will be one of my all time favorite recipes!  Thanks for submitting!

Not going to miss my pumpkin pies this year.  I did part white, part brown sugar and added 1/4 tsp of ginger.  I made my sweet potatoes ahead of time and then chilled them in the fridge overnight and didn't have any texture issues.  I'd do the same in the future.

This was my first sweet potato pie and it turned out great. My husband was the judge and he loved it. I used a bit less sugar than the recipe calls for. I did 1/3 c brown sugar and 1/3 c white sugar. It turned out perfectly. I also baked a second one and added some coconut and it was wonderful

This is generally a good recipe, but I think it needs a few changes.
#1 WAY too much butter! All I could taste was butter, I will cut the butter in half next time to see how it turns out.
#2 I increased the cinnamon to 1 tablespoon for personal preference and I didn't think it was too much spice, maybe the butter just overpowered everything.
#3 I followed other reviewers advise and cut the sugar. I used 3/4 cup, half brown and half white, I still think it was too sweet. I'm scaled down to 2/3 cup next time and see before I try to go all the way down to 1/2 cup. Some people may like it that sweet, but I like to really taste the "sweet potato" more than anything in this pie.

Other than making the above changes next time, my pie was in perfect consistency after boiling the potatoes for 1 hour(I may even add another 15-30 minutes because my fat potato still wasn't mashy enough). I made sure I let the extra water dripped before I mash and mix. I baked it for 55 mins and let it cooled for a few hours.

This "pie" was super easy and mmm mmm good !! I used 1/2 the amount of sugar (and used brown sugar instead). Also, did not bother with a crust. I just used a glass pie plate and sprayed with Pam. My 4 year old ate 1.5 pieces !! Good for a boy who is super picky and does not eat alot of veg. Will use again for sure.

Delicious and simple to make! I did the half and half thing with the sugar, but otherwise made as written. I love the taste of yams so next time I may roast it in the oven instead. Thanks!

My husband who doesn't even like sweet potatoes LOVED this pie!
It was super easy to make, I even left the pie in a bit too long (oops!) and it was kind of dark on top, but it tasted great!
Thanks!

Great! We loved it! I made a few changes..I took advice from other reviews I read & used 2 cups of sweet potato. Also, I baked the sweet potatos rather than boiled them for a richer flavor. Then I used a cuisinart smart stick hand blender to get the creamy texture. I also used 2/3 cup maple syrup instead of  sugar, for a healthier treat that my 1 yr old could enjoy & added 1 more egg to balance out the extra liquid. Fresh ground spices also added a nice touch.

I was generally pleased with this recipe and it was gobbled up by my guests.  I followed the suggestions of others and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup light brown sugar.  Even with the reduction it was still a little sweet for me.  I used a hand mixer but will use a blender next time to smooth it out more.  I ended up baking my pie for 90 minutes (with the crust covered with foil for 40 of those minutes at the end).  I will make this recipe again and maybe play around with some additions.

LOVED IT! I mixed the sweet potato and other ingredients in the blender in 2 batches. No mess, no strings, just creamy goodness. 
My boyfriend said it was 2nd only to Grandma's. It went fast at Thanksgiving dinner and he's already asked me to make another one. I have always liked pumpkin better, but this one blew away the pumpkin pie. Can't wait to make it again. Thanks for the recipe.

I'd heard Americans raving about Sweet Potato Pie and had to try it, and now I understand why!! This was so yum. I used pre-made puff pastry as my base because that's all I had, but otherwise kept the recipe the same. Texture is perfect, tastes delicious. My boyfriend likes it too and he won't eat sweet potato normally.

Great pie, just for me a little sweet.. wish I would have used 3/4 C. sugar instead, because the sweet potatoes are already naturally sweet. Also cooked the potatoes in the Micro, so much faster!! Overall great recipe.

I know I used more then 2 cups and/or 1 lb of sweet potatoes (I forgot to measure them) - I then added extra milk cause my mixture was too "thick" - not sure how much milk I used, but according to my Pastor and husband, it was not too mucy of anything added like I kept telling them, they just said if it was too much of anything, it was too much of GOOD!!!  I also added the lemon juice that some of the others had used.

One of my sisters decided to have a sweet potato pie contest this Christmas involving all of sisters, 5 in all. I made this pie in record time of 8 minutes. I used canned sweetened sweet potatoes drained and followed the recipe exactly except I added more spices. I"ll give you one guess who won the pie contest. Yep, me hands down. My mother was from Mississippi and she recently passed away, and she made a sweet potatoe pie that was very similar to this recipe. since she was southern raised, she never had any recipes written down she would say use "use a pinch of this or that." I think I will honor her memory by making this recipe each year for the holdays.
thank you for bringing back a small memory of my mother.

This pie was delicious!  I didn't change a thing.  I love pumpkin pie, never had tasted sweet potato pie and thought it would be a nice change for Thanksgiving.  My family loved it and best of all, I impressed my inlaws. =)

OMG FABULOUSE! And Ohe so easy!!!! Made this for Thanksgiving and got rave reviews!!!! Used the recipe for pie crust lll by: Linda Gaffney. You can even make the crust and potato mixure up to three days early, but keep them seperate and wrapped till baking time.
 Would NOT change a single thing! PERFECTION~ Thanks for sharing!

Marvelous!  Great texture, taste, easy!
This is close to my family recipe. I microwave or bake them until soft, instead of boiling them, to get the optimal nutriteints and taste out of the sweet potato!

This was a wildly popular at my house.  It went away in a day.  I barely changed the recipe.  I replaced half the milk with heavy cream, and I used allspice instead of nutmeg.  I also had to bake it about twice as long as the recipe says, but that might be my oven, which can be problematic at times. 
All in all, a big hit.

Pretty good.  I used buttermilk instead of milk, which worked well.  The texture was excellent.  Next time I will double the cinnamon and use half the nutmeg.

This was absolutely the best sweet potato pie I've ever made.  2 CUPS MASHED SWEET POTAOTES is the key to it's perfection.  All my sweet potato pie connoisseurs wanted more & I believe that is the best way to rate a recipe :)

This was absolutely wonderful!!  I needed a recipe to be able to make this pie for my husband who has loved it all his life.  My family never made it so I was a newbie!  It came off without a hitch.  It was very easy and I did my husband proud!!  He ate the whole pie himself so I can't tell you how it rated with the rest of the family!

Thank you Joyce!  I had eaten sweet potatoe pie before, and figured that since I've lived in the south now for 13+ years, it was high time I learned to make one myself.  Here's what I did:  baked sweet potato and let cool until it was easy to handle, then mixed that and all the other ingredients in my food processor.  I used evaporated milk, 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar and added 1/2 tsp of ginger and 1/4 tsp of cloves.  I agree that the pie came out to be a bit too sweet for my taste, so next time I'll decrease the sugar to 3/4 cup.  I poured it into my deep dish pie pan and baked as instructed:  though I had to bake for at least 75 minutes before the center was set.  Next time I may try to divide it into 2 small pies...to avoid the long cook time.  My family thought it was pumpkin pie...and I let them go on like that!  I like being able to use a fresh sweet potato instead of the canned pumpkin.  Thanks so much for sharing your little bit of the south with me!

This pie is so good, it will hurt your feelings!  I've never made pumpkin pie, much less a sweet potato pie, and this turned out terrific even with a store bought crust.  Don't tell my mother, but this tasted better than her delicious pumpkin pies!  I didn't deviate from the recipe at all, but next time I think I will try making my own crust as well.  Thank you so much for submitting a great recipe, Joyce!

Turned out perfect, despite all my cutbacks and substituitions: used only half the butter, skim instead of regular milk, and Splenda instead of (used 3/4 cup only too).  I also shortened potato cooking time to 15 minutes by using a pressure cooker.

This recipe is just about perfect...I did add a 1/2 a teaspoon of lemon extract and that made all the difference to me...I will continue to use this recipe every Thanksgiving...the only minor complaint is that is needs to be a little more firm...but everything else was fantastic!

I thought this recipe was great.  The only part that took a while was actually cooking hte sweet potato, but that was it.  I ended up making two of these pies for Thanksgiving because it is tradition for my husband's family.  He loved it.

I'd never tasted sweet potato pie and frankly, I thought it sounded gross. But a family member requested one for Thanksgiving, so I gave this recipe a shot. Wow! It's delicious! 

It took a while to beat the ingredients into a smooth mixture, but was well worth the effort.

Top notch recipe - a real hit at a church event recently.

I took the feedback many others did, and made the following changes:

1) cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup, and added 1/2 cup of brown sugar
2) added 1 tbsp of flour to help thicken the mix
3) added 1/2 tsp of ginger powder, and 1/2 tsp of clove powder
4) I baked the sweet potatoes instead of boiling them. (Better flavor from roasting)
5) I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk.

The real kicker though was separating the egg whites from the yolks, adding the yolks to the rest of the mixture, and then whipping the egg whites until stiff peaks formed. I folded in the egg whites with the rest of the mixture until just combined.

The result was pure gustatory heaven. The pie had good structure and didn't collapse when removed from the oven. Well worth the effort.

I made this pie and it turned out pretty good, but the filling was very runny.

So then I made it again with a few changes that made it INCREDIBLE!

1. Do NOT boil the sweet potato, it makes it lose its flavor and the water that it absorbs can throw off your filling. Instead, bake it (just as it is) for at least an hour at 375F.

2. I mixed after every ingredient instead of dumping everything in at once after blending the butter and potato. I found this to make the filling smoother and more creamy. You can also swap out the regular milk for canned milk!

Though I am giving this 5 stars, it's based on the recipe with a few changes I made. I used evaporated milk, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also used 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice instead of just the cinnamon and nutmeg. It filled 2 pie crusts. Maybe because I used a really large sweet potato. It's absolutely delicious and super easy to make!

I've made this pie from this recipe several times and it's really good. perfect on spices. The only issue I had in the beginning was it's way too loose. Added about a tablespoon of all purpose flour and it comes out perfect now.

I made this pie exactly as directed and it came out perfectly. I did not follow the cooking time since I never do, so I couldn't tell you how long I baked it for (you just knows when its done) but everybody loved it. Its not over powering with spices its perfect. This will be my sweet potato pie go to recipe from now on. Only thing is this recipe calls for 1 pie crust. If you're not doing deep dish, you'll need 2 pie crusts

I love this simple recipe! I did take advice of another and added lemon juice, brown sugar, and ground clove. Also I recommend baking crust 20 min prior to pouring the pie mix in crust and maybe 1/2 cup more brown or white sugar. My mother said it wasn’t sweet enough for her taste but was perfect to me!

Wonderful recipie! I didnt realize how many pounds of sweet potatoes I put into the pot to boil.... I happened to look back at my receipt! I boiled about 8 to 9 lbs. didnt seem that heavy. Luckly I purchased enough pie shells (no time to make my own). I followed the recipie and used a few of the suggestions added by others... I used half and half instead of milk, added ginger, added lemon juice, and flower. All 8 of my pies are not just gorgeous, but also delish!! Great flavor, beautiful texture, and simply amazing! Thank you Cougaar, this will be a staple in my home! God Bless

Made this once and making again tonight!! I doubled the recipe. Instead of using regular milk I use 1 can of evaporated milk (do not add the water to the milk) straight from the can... I ended up with 2 deep dish pies and one regular size pie.  Everyone who tried it loved it!! Thanks for sharing this recipe and others who have shared their altered versions..

First time ever tasting or making a sweet potatoe pie. It was delicious (note "was"). Entire family loved it. The only modification I made was to cut the sugar amount way down. I used about 1/4 c sugar and made enough filling for two 9inch pies.

have made this pie at holidays and for special requests for the past 6 years. I use a few modifications though, I use canned potatoes, evaporated milk (makes it richer to me),  throw everything in a blender (smoother filling and no strings).  This pie has gotten many rave reviews and some requests for birthdays. Love this pie.

I haven't made a sweet potato pie in a long time and this recipe has just become my favorite way to make them from now on! I took the advice of others and used half white sugar half brown sugar, half & half instead of milk, and 2 tsps of fresh lemon juice. AMAZING!!!!

I love this recipe because it simple.  But I changed a few things because that's what I do with my pumpkin pies from scratch.  I had about a half a cup of finally shaved coconut and I add a cup of low fat canned coconut milk. I changed it to half of the amount of butter as well.  The coconut shavings thicken it up a little bit and gives it better texture and flavor. I baked mine at 1 hour and 45 mins.

Boy does this smell and taste delicious! Had a lot of extra (uncooked) sweet potatoes left after Thanksgiving and used two medium sized ones for this pie. (I was confused by the "1 (1 lb) potato" in the ingredients. Couldn't weigh them and one just wasn't enough.) I also used Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust recipe with this and it seemed to work well together.

I've used this recipe for the last 3 years for Thanksgiving and Christmas and everyone loves it. I made a few tweaks. I add vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, and cloves to the water as it boils and then throw in the potatoes. It enhances the flavor tremendously. I also use buttermilk in the recipe instead of regular milk. I personally don't find a probably with the texture. Mash the potatoes and butter together with a potatoe masher. And use an electric mixture for the rest of the prep. And in an hour you'll have an awesome pie. It is sweet but a little indulgence and vanilla ice cream will help with that... It's the holidays after all.

Dear Hearts, this is an awesome pie. Pease don't confuse this pie with the likeness of pumpkin pie! The simplicity of the recipe is what makes it unique. I have made this pie for years using evaporated milk and eliminating the nutmeg (just not fond of it). My entire family asks for this pie at every event where pie is expected on the menu. If you are a fan of sweet potatoes, you will love the delightful flavor of this pie.  You won't be disappointed!

I used a 15.5 ounce can (this recipe calls for one pound = 16oz sweet potatoes) and subtracted 1/4 cup milk to compensate for a tad less sweet potato. This took 1.5 hours to cook and it was not good. I'm sure if you used baked sweet potatoes it would come out fine but don't try canned. Also -- I added cloves -- which I would do again.

I could never find anyone who could make a sweet potato pie better than my aunt and grandma, when I used this recipe to make mine, I could not believe how super, duper, delicious it was, OMG, THE BEST EVER!!! My husband licked the plate when he was done, he loved it, now he has me up making him 2 more, one for his job and one for home.

I used canned milk, and a little less than half a cup of sugar (mixed white and brown) since I read that this recipe can be sweet. I baked it as a pudding instead of in a pie crust and took it to the residents of a nursing home where it was a huge hit!

the only thing that I did different to this recipe was instead of 1/2 C milk, I put 1/4 milk and 1/4 heavy whipping cream, a squeeze of  fresh lemon, of the things that is crucial I learned long time ago in regards to potatoes (this goes for any kind of potato you mash I.e. regular or sweet potato) add a few tablespoons of the water that the potatoes boiled in, this way you get all the potato flavor you don't lose it all down the drain,also I cut each potato in half in made the boiling time much quicker! TRY THIS RECIPE YOU WELL NEVER CHANGE!

Super good and super easy if you substitute 1 lb canned and drained yams for the sweet potato.

I received rave reviews on this pie every time I've made it. Even from ladies who have eaten sweet potato  their entire lives. They say it's the best they've had. I used drained canned sweet potatoes instead of fresh and it came out great and was a huge time saver. I used about two cups mashed per pie. I also mixed the potatoes and milk in the blender to get a nice purée.

With the advice of other reviewers, this recipe was outstanding! I had leftover yams from Thanksgiving, so I cooked and mashed them and stored this in a freezer bag. I read somewhere about the stringy-ness of cooked yams and it not being nice in a pie….so once defrosted, I strained the yams and got a very smooth texture to use for this recipe. I also added nonfat sweetened condensed milk instead of regular milk, half brown sugar/ half white sugar. Next time, I will go with all brown sugar. At the end I added about a tablespoon of flour to thicken the recipe and last a dash of ground cloves. Next time I will put a little more cinnamon and more ground cloves. Don’t be afraid to add more spice. Once it hit the 60 minute baking time at the 350C temperature, I monitored it very closely to ensure the center cooked through since I had read others having an issue with the doneness. This added to about another 7-10 minutes. Cooked it, wrapped it up and stored it in the refrigerator. This was better than any bakery or store bought pie ever!

This was an awesome recipe. I used my Ninja to blend everything together and to smooth out my sweet potatoes. I also used white sweet potatoes instead.

This is my "go to" sweet potato pie! I have always used 4 or 5 small sweet potatoes. One potato would not be enough to make the consistency of the pie be correct.

The first time I made this recipe I accidentally used yams instead if sweet potatoes. Now EVERYONE I've ever made it for (with yams) begs me to remake it every year. Hands down- best recipe ever. I'd give it 10 stars if I could!

My pic is pre-baking but the outcome was so perfect! The only modification I made was 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar (which was quite sweet, I will add a bit less sugar next time) plus I used pumpkin pie spice and nutmeg, adding a touch more than stated in the recipe. I used a homemade pie crust and I peeled the sweet potato and chopped it into chunks before boiling it to cut down significantly on cooking time. Be careful, sweet potatoes can be very hard so be sure to use a heavy bladed knife. Happy Baking Everyone!

I love sw pot pie and always order it when on the menu.  This one is fantastic.  It is sweet but that is how my family likes it (we are from the south)  I used two cups of potato ( 2 med size) that I cooked in the microwave.  I was worried about strings based on other reviews but there were no strings at all.  Even though I love this recipe I am tempted to try some of the others on this site just to compare, but this one is a keeper.  I did buy the crust, Wholly Wholesome whole wheat as I like to feel like I am making some attempt at good choices, you didnt even notice it was whole wheat.

This is so easy to make! My dad loves it, he actually teared up when he tried it because it reminded him of his mother's sweet potato pie (she died before my parents got married 27 years ago). She was the classic southern cook from Alabama. Me and him share it and its usually gone by the end of the week and its time to make another one.

I made this recipe with the following tweaks:  I used 2 lbs of sweet potato and I tossed them into the oven to bake instead of boiling. While it was in the oven, I made my pie crust. Also, I added a pinch of ground cloves to the mix and because I don't have a mixer, I just dumped it into the blender and flayed it a bit in there....poured right into the pie crust and into the already hot oven (from baking the sweet potatoes.) 

It was AMAZING! Even my 16 yr old daughter with Autism who has severe food texture/smell issues ate it and LOVED it! We will DEFINITELY be making this pie again and again! Thank you.

This was Awesome!! My first time baking any kind of pie and it was simple, quick and DELICIOUS!!!  My son use to say he would only eat his grandmother's pie until I made this.  I used 6 sweet potatoes, vanilla and lemon extract, buttermilk and doubled the recipe for 2 deep dish pies.  Love it!! I will definitely use this again.  Next time I will try brown sugar instead of white.

Love the taste, but I will never boil the potatoes ever again because it adds too much moisture to the pie. I will bake them from this point on.

This pie was a hit at my son's first Nochebuena (his fiancé is Cuban).
I played with the recipe a bit.
After boiling the potatoes, I removed the skin and placed them (hot) into a potato press.  I squeezed gently to remove excess water then squeezed them into the bowl.  This removed all strings and fibers.
I creamed the sweet potatoes with firm butter.  
I replaced the milk with evaporated milk.
I replaced half of the sugar with dark brown sugar.
I added two tablespoons of lemon juice.
I separated the eggs and beat the whites to soft peaks and folded them in last.
I baked 15 minutes longer.
The result was a pie with a chiffon consistency.  Delightful!

Where to start. This pie was delicious but it gave me quite a bit of grief. First off, I over estimated the amount of potato as some users suggested and still had too little. Had to run to the store early Thanksgiving morning. Then after an hour of baking, it wouldn't firm up! It baked for around 1.5 hours and much freaking out, it firmed. It was gorgeous for sure. But the consistency was strange. Next time, I'll puree everything, then bake. That being said, it was the only pie at dinner that got completely eaten! Thanks!

This is the recipe I use whenever I make sweet potato pies. I tried it with a graham cracker crust just to change it up some and that went over very good!!!!! I make two pies, one with regular frozen pie crust and one with graham cracker crust and they both go fast!!!!! I am not sure which one I like the best, they both are so good!!!

All I can say is amazing!  Simple recipe, great taste, and I will be making it again.  This will become my family recipe!  The only change I made was believe it or not, I did not add the milk; the pie filling was quite moist with all the other ingredients and I was afraid it would not firm up, so I took a chance and omitted it.  The pie still came out perfect and it was a hit with the kids!

Delightful!  Great recipe COUGARR. I did however substitute the following as my hubby & I are very health conscience. I used 1/2 tsp stevia extract for the 1 cup sugar and added 1/2 cup brown sugar. Substituted butter with olive oil; milk with ALMOND milk. I did add 2 Tbsp of lemon juice; 2 Tbsp of Almond Meal Flour; and added 1 Tbsp of Pure Maple Syrup. i ALSO microwaved the organic sweet potatoes to cut down on the cooking time and I used all ready made pie dough by Pillsbury which I baked for 10 minutes prior to filling with batter. BTW be sure you "fork" the dough prior to prebaking.  All in all, the pie was D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!!

I made 4 of these pies yesterday with some of the sweet potatoes from my garden.  For three of them, I used half white sugar and half brown, 2 tsp lemon juice, and evaporated milk.  I just used my potato masher and handheld mixer to blend.  These set up extremely well.  For the last one, I ran the sweet potato through my food processor to get it really smooth.  Made the same changes, but used half and half instead of evap milk.  This one didn't set up as well (but tasted just fine and had a very smooth texture).  So, I'll be doing the first method from now on.  Definitely make sure that your sweet potatoes are very soft all the way through before mashing.  Got rave reviews from everyone who had some!

This is a nice and simple recipe. One tip: for a less sweet (and healthier) pie, substitute the one cup white sugar, for one cup brown sugar. I also add a little bit more cinnamon than the 1/2 teaspoon just because I love that stuff! :)

I liked this recipe. Don't be fooled if it looks like coarse meal in the mixer though! (I didn't know that before!) I liked the texture of the pie even though it still left a mild "stringy" feeling of the sweet potatoes. Serve with whipped cream! (Homemade if possible!)

Excellent recipe.  I use 1/2 c brown sugar and baked the sweet potatoes instead of boiling.  My mother-in-law grew up in the south and says it is as good as the one her grandmother made.

I also used canned sweet potato (organic) and added 1/4 tsp. ginger and a couple of dashes of salt to round out the flavors.  If one was using salted butter, the salt would be unnecessary, of course.  Cannot beat the simplicity and I was thrilled to avoid having to use condensed milk, like so many other recipes.

I made this for the first time and everyone in my family became infatuated with it. I halved the white sugar for brown, used condensed milk, used canned yams, and a little flour to thicken it up. FANTASTIC! (I read through reviews and combined advice)

Just perfect.  I added a drop of clove essence, 1 tsp ginger powder, and substituted the pecans for nuts (I cant find pecans where I live).  I'm making it again today.

This is a party in my mouth.  I had never had sweet potato pie before this recipe so didn't know if I was making it right.  YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY.  We're a little on the poor side and this is cheap dessert to make.  To me it's not to sweet, it is just right.

If you happen to be out of milk, evaporated works.

Rave reviews from my family at Thanksgiving. I added pecan pieces, just on top, which really added to the taste. Next time, I'll use my own pie crust recipe, which will really make them melt. 
*I did forget to add the milk, so it came out denser, but so so good.

I cut the sugar to 2/3 cup (half brown, half white), browned the butter, added freshly grated nutmeg, used evaporated milk, and made my own crust.  It sounds like a lot of changes, but they didn't seem like a perversions to the original recipe.

In the end, I pulled a delicious pie from the oven and will totally use this recipe again.  (Probably with more cinnamon, more nutmeg, and a bit of orange zest next time.)

this is sooo delicious! I have never tasted sweet potato pie before and this was the first attempt at baking and eating one. I'm new to the US. All I changed was 1/2 c brown and 1/2 c white sugars. I will be looking for more potatoes soon to make more. My husband who has lived in the US all his life had never tried one either. He loved it. Raved about it! Thank you for sharing...yummy!

Amazing! I used whipping cream instead of milk and added 3 tbsp of flour as some suggested.  Love this pie!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and my pie came out pretty awesome. :)  A bit on the sweeter side though, I think I may take that down a bit next time.

This was my first time making sweet potato pie and it came out great. I microwaved the sweet potato instead of boiling it and cut the sugar in half.  My family loved it. They now prefer it to pumpkin pie.

This was my first time baking a sweet potatoe pie and it received rave reviews!  This recipe is simple and not time consuming.  I did tweet it a little bit by using canned sweet potatoes (I did not want to peel any potatoes and it was inexpensive...cans of sweet potatoes were only 99 cent).  I also added 1 tsp of lemon flavoring.  The pie turned out delicious!!  It was up there with my mom's sweet potatoe pie and that is very hard to beat.  She was truly impressed when she tasted it and said she was "almost" out done.  LOL!

No condensed milk, yay!!!  We loved this recipe - it was easy to make, came out great and it  does not use condensed milk.  We did double all of the spices.

LOVE IT! This was my first sweet potato pie attempt, and it was awesome! The ratios were spot on and the filling set well. People who were unfamiliar with sweet potato pie just thought it was pumpkin! But this is some much easier than making pumpkin pie from scratch!

Finally - a sweet potato pie recipe that calls for regular milk (not condensed or evaporated milk).  I doubled the recipe for this past Thanksgiving Day.  Used a half cup of brown sugar with one and a half cups of white sugar (so it wouldn't be so sweet) and the pies came out wonderful and delicious.  Thanks. :)

Super easy & absolutely fabulous! I did use 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugar..& i also used a 15 oz can of sweet potatoes rather than using fresh. It turned out wonderful. I may add flour next time to thicken it up, but it really was just fine the way it was. Flour may help the presentation.

This is a good basic recipe. I add brown sugar (1/2c white and 1/2c brown),2 teaspoons of lemon extract, 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon (I like cinnamon) and I use evaporated milk.

This pie is great, although I made a few changes....  I used half white sugar and half brown sugar, I added lemon juice, and cornstarch to thicken it up a bit.  It turned out fabulous, the best sweet potato pie that I've ever made! I ended up making a total of 4 for Thanksgiving!

This is the bomb. The first recipe that came out correct. I used condensed milk and took off 1/3 the amount, while adding two sweet potatos as someone recomended.

I'm a novice and easily made this delicious pie! The grocer only had Hannah Sweet Potatoes, which made me nervous, but it still turned out the right color and flavor. It took about 15 minutes longer to bake in my gas oven, but was well worth the wait. It was a great recipe to make me feel back at home in the South during my holidays away. Thanks!

Good but a little too sweet for me - I will make it again but with less sugar and more sweet potatoes. I didn't have regular butter and used light butter - didn't seem to hurt it at all. Baking time was longer than the recipe said by about 10 minutes - also this recipe made almost enough filling for 2 pies

I made this recipe vegan by using earth balance, almond milk, and egg replacer.  No complaints, it will become a stable in our household from here on out.

It was my turn to do the birthday baking in the office and the birthday boy requested sweet potato pie!  I found this recipe and he has been raving since he cut the first slice!  Called it "Like Grandma used to make!" and he is not sharing at all.  I did tweak it just a bit by using heavy cream instead of milk and substituting ginger and clove for nutmeg since it was what was on hand.  I will totally be making this recipe again!  Maybe this time with the lower calorie milk!

Excellent, It was my first time making sweet potato pie and everyone loved it. The only thing I changed from the original is I used half light brown and white sugar. My sweet potatoes were given to me  so I could not measure them. I read that 1 pound of sweet potatoes equals to about 2 cups of mashed sweet potatoes. This worked good for me! Thanks so much :)

my 1st sweet potato pie.  i loved this recipe but substituted splenda for sugar and used 1/4 less than called for.  next time i may try a little more nutmeg and cinnamon but over all it was easy and tasted wonderful.

I have never had sweet potato pie before but this tastes fantastic. My boyfriend loved it and it was a huge hit at work that people asked for the recipe!!!

I used two cups of orange sweet potato mash and two tbps of plan flour as suggested by some of the reviewers and it turned out wonderful... I used full cream milk and I didn't have enough nutmeg so I put 1 tbp of Cinnamon instead. I used the Pie Crust IV recipe from this site which was perfect. Thank you for this great recipe

I love sweet potato pies, and I tried making one on my own from a recipe my mom gave me. Lets just say that it was not a fan favorite. But after searching allrecipes.com, and giving this on a try. It was a big hit, and it comes out perfect every time.

No one in my family had ever had sweet potato pie. I have made this recipe no less than 6 times in the last year for family functions- everyone raves about it and it has now been requested whenever I need to bring a dish to a family function.  Because it is so similar and just lighter on the flavor of spices, it has now replaced Pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving for us.

I would like to bring attention to someone else's review suggesting to add a Tbs or 2 of flour to the filling before baking to thicken it. I use that suggestion as a standard when baking now.  I also ease up on the sugar by about a 1/8th cup.

This pie is fantastic with coffee- a nice Medium-dark roast perfectly balances the sweetness of the pie.

Oh wow....first time I've ever made sweet potato pie...so easy and SO GOOD.  I said "OH WOW" when I took that first bite lol.  I did use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, and added a little ground cloves, ginger (I didn't measure them, maybe 1/2 tsp?) and some lemon juice (all I had left - perhaps about 1 tbsp.).  I was going to use evaporated milk instead of regular milk as others suggested but I didn't have any.  I have another sweet potato so I'm making another pie this weekend!

I made this using stevia in place of sugar plus 1 extra sweet potato to replace the bulk of the missing sugar. It turned out great. I also added 1/4 tsp each cloves and ginger based on other reviews. It got a tumbs up from the family.

I made this for the first time for Christmas and it went over very well with my family, and they are very choosey about their sweet potato pies. I was a bit leery because I'm not a baker by any means but it came out perfect. I followed the directions this time, but I'm looking forward to experimenting with this one.

Recently divorced, my first time making Christmas Dinner for me, 4 of my 5 kids and guest.  They loved the pies.  I multiplied the recipe and subbed 1/3 of the white sugar with brown sugar.  This is going into my recipe box.

This recipe is easy to make and the pie tasted just like the pie i grew up on. The only difference is i used half & half milk in place of the milk suggested.

I don't understand how anyone would have issues as this pie seemed foolproof!  It was DELISH! The flavors were awesome. Make sure you use a 9" pie pan (if you don't have one, get the aluminum one from the grocery store) and the filling fits it perfectly. I covered the pie edges with foil to prevent browning as I like my crusts softer. Also, 1 lb. of sweet potatoes is ~ 3 medium sized potatoes. Note, I didn't cook with the skins on. It was simply easier to peel, boil and mash!

I made this recipe for the first time on Thanksgiving. My father who is from Lousiana and very rarely eats desserts, said, "it was the best he had ever had".  It's a new family recipe.

I was so impressed with myself after making this recipe.  I make a lot of pies, but I've never attempted a sweet potato pie.  I was completely shocked at how well this turned out mainly because it was so QUICK and EASY.  A must try! Don't forget the whipped topping!  It makes it so much better.

This sweet potato pie is delicious.  Maybe my potatoes were naturally sweet, but I found 1c of sugar to be cloying.  I used about 1/3c in my last pie and it was to my liking.  I also baked this without a pie crust for a celiac friend.

This pie was great!! I made a few changes to suit my taste. I only put in 1/2 cup of sugar and I used brown sugar. I used soy milk instead of regular and I added a pinch of ground cloves. I also used only half the butter the recipe called for and it was plenty rich. I used leftover baked sweet potatoes that were stored in my refrigerator over night and did not notice any of the graininess mentioned by other raters that used cold sweet potatoes.

Delicious! I have never made sweet potato pie before so I decided to try this recipe. I am never going to make pumpkin pie again! Sweet potato pie is ten times better! Its very sweet! Just to my liking.  I used a pound of canned pumpkin, and didnt mix it well enough so it was still chunky, but good! Next time I will puree the sweet potatoes!

Big hit at Thanksgiving this year! I used 1/2 the butter and sugar in the filling, and would recommend roasting, not boiling, the sweet potatoes.

I personally don't like sweet potato pie, but I was told it was awesome! I did change a few things, I poked wholes in the crust and baked it before filling. I also used canned milk, baked the sweet potatoes until soft and added 1/4 cup brown sugar. Also, this was enough for 2 pies.

This was so good. The only thing I changed was the milk, I used whipping cream. Everyone loved it.

This recipe is so easy and delicious. I did alter it a little bit by adding 3 tbsp of flour to bind the batter. Also, next time I would use 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead. 1 cup of sugar is too sweet for me.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving, and it was a huge hit. I did follow the suggestions and I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk. I added a 1/4 tsp of cloves and ginger and 2 tbsp of lemon juice. I also added a 2 tbsp flour to the mixture to thicken up a bit. Last, I halved the white sugar and replaced with brown sugar. I know these changes changed the taste of the pie, but I'm sure its a delicious pie regardless. this was just for personal preference. Also, I made a quick graham cracker crust because I was pressed for time, and it complimented the pie wonderfully. I will definitely be making this pie again and again. thanks!

I was extremely happy with this pie, but I made some changes due to my personal preferences.     First, I made my own crust. For me, home made crust is a must have! I used a pasta frolla recipe with a hint of lemon zest. I also used a tart shell. So I blind baked the crust before filling it and baking it again.     Instead of boiling, I baked my sweet potatoes. They retained their original flavors and stayed a pretty orange. I also used 1/2 cup brown sugar + 1/2 cup white sugar instead, and also replaced the milk with evaporated milk. I used my kitchen stand mixer to ensure the potato mixture was smooth and whipped.    These changes made one of the tastiest sweet potato tarts I've ever made. I used my left over filling to make mini tarts. Fantastic!

Thank you for this recipe and for the extra responses. I have never made pie before and I needed a good recipe. Many people doubted my ability to make a delicious pie. I have proven them wrong with this recipe. I used others suggestions 1/2 cup of white sugar and a 1/2 of light brown sugar, microwave the potatos. Instead of milk I used sweeten condensed can milk mix with a little water so it's not so thick, and some lemon juice. This made 2 pies nice thick and fluffy. My son the pickest eater of all wanted seconds...thanksgiving is going to be awesome

I wanted an easy recipe for Sweet Potato Pie, when I found this a few years ago I was amazed. Since then I have added my own touch which has made my Sweet Potato pies a must during the holidays.   1/2 Cup of White Sugar 1/2 Cup of Brown Sugar 1 teaspoon of Pumpkin Spice (Funny story there, I went to the store to pick up nutmeg the day before Thanksgiving and they were OUT! I was so bummed but then decided to just use Pumpkin Spice and it was amazing.)   After the pie cools add whip cream, then sprinkle the top with shaved Almonds for a little extra texture.. You won't be disappointed.

This is an awesome recipe for sweet potato pie.  I make it at least thrice a year, I just add an extra sweet potato for creaminess, alight extra pinch of cinnamon and almost double the vanilla.   I'm going to make this again for Thanksgiving AND Hanukkah.
Happy Feasting.

Very good recipe. I have never made sweet potato pie before but had it when I lived in the south. This was easy to make and was delicious. This is not a criticism to the recipe, only advice to someone that has never made a pie like this before, using softened butter. Make sure your butter is very soft but not melted. I used softened butter that was not soft enough apparently and I had to put the mixture in a warm water bath to warm the mixture to fully incorporate the butter. This was my mistake but worked out in the end and the pie was excellent. A big GLOP of fresh whipped cream made it outstanding...thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe exactly as written.  I had never made or eaten a sweet potato pie, but I definitely will be making this again.  It is so simple and so delicious that I think I may have just started a new Thanksgiving tradition!  Even hubby ate two pieces in one sitting and said it was better than he thought it would be.

My absolute favorite dessert EVER.  I could eat this everyday, for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I even prefer this to classic pumpkin pie!  My only change is raw sugar and it makes no difference.  Thanks for this recipe!

YUM.  I made this pie for my mother who is a sweet potato pie lover. I on the other hand loved pumpkin pie until I made this pie. This pie is absolute heaven.  I won't be making pumpkin pie as much, this recipe has replaced it...YUM

I fooled both my husband and my father..thought it was pumpkin! Father loved it so much, he took the rest of the pie home. (he's very picky about squash pies!)  I cooked the sweet potatoes  in a slow cooker instead of the stove top. Loved this, will be making it again!

This is a good pie but, word of caution, if you use pale sweet potatoes, it makes for a more bland pie.  Make sure you get the potatoes with the darkest skins.

This is the best sweet potato pie I've ever eaten.  I followed the recipe as written except that I added 1/2 t. of salt.  This recipe is very similar to  every sweet potato pie I've ever baked, but it's just so much better!  This will be the standard in our house. Thanks for sharing it COUGAAR.

I reduced the butter to 3/8 cup, used half the amount to vanilla and cinnamon, and omitted the nutmeg.  It turned out great!  My friends loved it.  They thought it was light and fluffy and tasted like Chinese egg tarts.  Next time I will use 1/4 cup butter and omit the cinnamon, because I like the natural flavour of the sweet potato.  Thanks for the recipe!

I don't personally eat Sweet Potato Pie, but in the last two days I have made 2 for friends and family.  I got phone calls as soon as I got home from both, raving about how amazing the pie was, and if I could please make another!  I took the reviews to heart and added the 3 Tablespoons of flour to thinken it up, as well as the 2 Teaspoons of fresh squeezed lemon juice.  I was brave enough to try the mix before I put it in the oven, and it was super yummy! I know what I will be bringing to family dinner for Thanksgiving this year!

Delicious! The potatoes are smoother with fewer strings if you bake them. I bake several potatoes at the same time and make 3 pies (2 cups each when cooked) at the same time. They're best when fresh, but freeze okay if properly wrapped in freezer proof bags. Also, I cooked my pies @ 400 degrees for 60 minutes.

This was my very first Sweet Potato Pie.  I'm so glad I tried this recipe because now my husband and I are hooked!  Just as good as pumpkin pie, but not as sweet.  I used half and half instead of the milk (that's what I had on hand - no evap or I may have used that).  I also used heaping teaspoons of the nutmeg and cinnamon and just a dash or two of ginger and cloves.  I cut down the sugar a bit and used a combination of Splenda and Splenda brown sugar blend.  What a treat this was!  I can't wait to make it again!

This pie came out great. I followed most of the additions of reviewer SL and it was delicious. Next time i may add a tablespoon of cornstarch instead of a tablespoon of flour to help reach that perfect consistency. I also added a special ingredient to mine, a tablespoon of honey. It was awesome.

I always Let my mother cook my sweet potato pies But I wanted to try myself and I tried this recipe last night instead of making this recipe for 1 pie I made it for 2 and Me and my Husband ate a whole pie with butter pecan ice cream. It was great will contie using this recipe only thing I did was I used Deep Dish Pie Shells and it still came out great I used half a cup of brown sugar with 1 cup of white sugar, Next time I want to try it with carnation milk instead of regular milk.

OK, but not out of this world.  It was too mild and just didn't stand out as a memorable sweet potato pie.

I made this the other night and LOVED it. It was the first time I ever made or had sweet potato pie and it was delicious. I will definitely be using the recipe often. I used a graham cracker crust with it and it went perfectly

dealing with the sweet potato was so much easier than I thought it would be. Super tasty, but next time I might just use yams instead to compare.

We made this for the first time this Turkey Day, combining it with this fantastic homemade pie crust here:  http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Pie-Crust-IV/Detail.aspx    For our very first homemade pie, I'm very, very impressed.  Great texture, better than any pumpkin pie I've tasted.  Love the sweet flavor. :)  If I could rate it a 6/5, I would!

I used half & half instead of the milk and split the sugar to 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  And all I can say is wow!  I tried sweet potato pie about 10 years ago and it was ok...  Had some extra sweet potatoes around and the kids wanted to try sweet potato pie.  This totally surprised me!  Great recipe.  You must try it!

Oddly enough my town ran out of Pumpkin two days before Thanksgiving.  I couldn't bring myself to buy a pumpkin pie from the store, so I decided to make this.  My husband was so bummed that there would be no pumpkin pie BUT when he tried this he was amazed!!  It was absolutely delicious.  I followed some of the suggestions of others - 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar, a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and a couple of Tbsp of flour.  I also added a pinch of salt, some extra spices (more cinnamon, ginger and a pinch of cloves).  I microwaved the potato until soft - about 12 minutes total.  Put the mix in my stand mixer and put it through a sieve before it went into the pie shell as there were some bits that just weren't smooth.  I used the No Fear Pie Crust - it is easy, delicious and I always get so many compliments on it - it almost tastes like a cookie.  I will make this again and again.  Thanks so much for a great recipie!

Great recipe! I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because I had to make some changes. I used about 1.5 pounds of sweet potato. I had to add 1 tbsp of flour because the mixture was so thin. Like other reviewers, I also used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I doubled the cinnamon and used evaporated milk as well. Also, I used a deep dish pie crust. One other thing, I separated the egg whites and beat them until they peaked and folded them into the mixture last. It made the pie just a bit lighter and was definitely worth the extra work! Have made this pie several times and will continue to do so!

i made this recipe and I found it to be way too sweet.  I added an additional 4 ounces of sweet potato, and I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup and it was perfect.  As for the "liquid" component - I solved that by adding a tablespoon of flour.  It has a nice flavor to it.  It tastes great in a homemade butter crust. :)

My DH wanted a sweet potato pie for thanksgiving, I found this recipe, and all the good reviews. wanted to test it out before thanksgiving. My sweet potatoes from the garden rotted, so I used the canned as another reviewer did. EXCELLENT. I am not the best pie maker, many don't seem to set up right, this was perfect, even the kids who dislike sweet poato enjoyed it. I am not a pie fan, but the taste was very unique. cut a small piece, and had to get another small piece. I found a keeper here thanks so much

Pre-test before the big day (Thanksgiving)!Absolutely delicious!  My husband grew up in the south on his mother's home cooking and his exact words were "this taste like my mommas!" It is a slightly loose, however, setting overnight it was just fine!  So you have to wait (hard to do) for it to firm up.   I used 3 medium sweet potatos. I've tried many, many recipes over the years and this by far is the best!  I'm done looking for the perfect recipe for SP pie!  I've found it!

First time making a Sweet Potato Pie and am quite happy with it.  My husband, who when he saw the boiled sweet potato said it didn't seem appealing, liked it and took some to work today.  As I can't get pumpkin or canned pumpkin where I live in Sweden, this will do the trick!

Delicious! It was my first time making sweet potato pie, and this recipe was fantastic! Instead of using 1 cup white sugar I used 1/2 cup brown sugar. I don't like my desserts too sweet.  I also used only 1/4 cup of butter instead of 1/2 cup. It turned out to be just right for me!

My boyfriend has been craving sweet potato pie for months, so I finally decided to try this recipe. I used condensed milk instead of regular, and baked it for slightly longer than 1 hour. It was apparently better than what he's had in the South! Thanks so much for this recipe...I will definitely be using it again!!

Yummy pie. First time trying it and eating it. Added 1t extra vanilla, 1T lemon juice. When I cooked the sweet potato i peeled it cut it um into large cubes and microwaved it for about 8 minutes until soft. Way faster and easier :)Changed milk to evaporated milk, used 1/3 C of brown and white sugar together not each as 1C seemed too much. Used a 600gram sweet potato( more than a pound) as it made i thinker and 2T plain flour :) Thanks

Yum!  I didn't think the pie would set as the filling was so runny but it worked.  I pureed the potatoes after boiling them and measured out 2 cups.  I also didn't add all the sugar it called for.  I used about 3/4 of the required amount and it was sweet enough.

Having never tried or made sweet potato pie before, I thought I should try this. Fantastic! I just could not have imagined it would taste this perfect! I will definitely be making this one again.

Delicious! I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I weighed out a pound of sweet potato after they were cooked. Added a Tbsp of flour. It turned out perfect!

I was actually quite impressed with this pie, it's really very tasty. It's fairly reminiscent of a pumpkin pie, so this is a great alternative to an actual pumpkin pie for those who are allergic. My only recommendation is the same as my recommendation with my fave pumpkin pie recipe - double the spices and add in 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of allspice, and enjoy.

Turned out great and was really easy. I would also suggest adding a small amount of flour to thicken up the mix as it didn't cook fast enough and I ended up baking it 10-15 mins longer than it called for just to get the middle of the pie to not be "jiggly" and goopy.

This recipe was excellent. I did a little tweaking to fit my taste. Instead of using all white sugar, I used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white. Then I added a little honey for extra flavor. Also, instead of using regular milk, I used evaporated milk. Also, we like the bottom part of the crust to be a little dark. So I baked the pie shells for a little bit before added the filling. The pies came out great! My husband has already asked me to make two more tonight.

Very yummy and great holiday recipe. I used three medium sweet potatos becuase I didn't think one would be enough. Also, the batter is somewhat watery and I thought that I might have done something wrong but that is the way it is supposed to go. It was a great hit at Thanksgiving!!!

So delicious! Just the right amount of sweet. I added 1/4 tspn cloves and 1 tblspn lemon juice, split the sugar into half white and half brown as per suggestions. An awesome recipe, far more delicious than pumpkin pie!

Incredibly simple and great flavor. As suggested I used half brown and half white sugar, added some ground ginger & cloves, as well as topped with a few homemade pralines after baking. Even with storebought crust it won raves! Thank you, thank you!

Please make sure you buy real sweet potatoes and not yams. You will fall in love with this pie if you stick to real sweet potatoes. I have been using this recipe for many years now and I recommend it. It has a perfect sweet flavor, light texture, and nice combination of spices.

Ok, I have tried to make sweet potato pie before. I was never able to get it to turn out the way I liked by following the recipes.  Then along came this one.  This one, I can't even explain, there is something about the consistency that is awesome, just the right sweetness and spices.  Oh my, this is THE recipe for me.  I absolutely LOVE this pie.  The only problem I had was with the 1 one pound potato.  I wasn't too sure about it but it worked.  Kudos to the author!

This recipe was so easy and delicious.  Last year I tried to make one from scratch for Thanksgiving and I did a horrible job.  This year (2008), I redeemed myself with this recipe.  My family was fighting over the last piece.  Thank you so much.

This is the recipe that was handed down to me from my mother. It is great. This won my mother-in-law over. I make several and they are never wasted. One hint if you like coconut try adding 1 cup of coconut. Also try garnishing with a pecans, walnuts, almonds (your choice).

I made this over the week end but omitted to crust as I follow weight watchers.  I also put in no fat sour cream instead of milk.  I got rave reviews on it and will make it again very soon.

This was really good. It was the first time I have ever made sweet potato pie and I'm sure I'll be making it again. I did use an extra sweet potato (a small one), 1/2 brown sugar and used 1 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice instead of the nutmeg and cinnamon. Nice and sweet and delicious!

I have never made sweet potato pie before so I thought I would try it out.  I am going to make it with canned sweet potatoes next time because it was chunky like some of the pieces could not blend smoothly.  It tasted great though!

I'm not big on sweet potatoes, but even I had to admit this was very good. I changed the recipe just a little bit, and everyone thought it was amazing! I added about 1/3 to 1/2 cup flour to add texture, and about 1/4 teaspoon salt. I also topped this with Marshmallow fluff. The reviews were FANTASTIC!

Delicious! I used 1/4 splenda sugar and 1/4 splenda brown sugar to help w/ the sugar content for my diabetic father. I also added 1 Tbls of four and added 1 tsp of ginger. I also baked my sweet potatoes instead of boiling to bring out the taste.

Excellent taste. A bit too sweet for me; next time will cut sugar to 3/4 cup - 1/2 white, 1/4 brown. Also added a tad more cinnamon.

This was my first attempt at a sweet potato pie and it turned out great.  The only adjustment I made was switching half the sugar with brown sugar..Everybody loved it!

This was an awesome recipe. The sweet potatos took longer than I thought to soften, but once they were this recipe was a snap to make. And I didn't have any pie crust available so I just stuck the filling in a casserole dish and bakes as directed. It came out delicious. My 2 year old could not get enough!

The best Sweet Potato Pie I've ever tasted!  The only thing I did different was use only 1 egg.  It was a big hit at Thanksgiving dinner and even my husband loved it and he doesn't like Sweet Potato Pie!  I especially love how it tastes like it has brown sugar in it. Thank for the recipe!

This was really good. I used much more sweet potatoes than called for, probably about 1 1/2cups more. I like a deep dish pie. And it also made it more firm. My kids didn't notice a difference between it and pumpkin pie.

My girlfriend and I decided to make this very same recipe after hearing it at the beginning of the Dutch band The Ex's song The Pie. I don't know if I'd ever had sweet potato pie previous to this, but it was pretty great.

This was totally delicious! I made it with Okinawan sweet potatoes instead just to add a twist. What's the difference? These potatoes are very, very purple, so they made one awesome purple sweet potato pie!

I was so thrilled when I tasted the creamy batter.  However, the baked pie was a bit dry.  Probably because I used Japanese Satsuma Sweet potatoes.  They are sweeter and richer, but kinda dry.  I made it with brandy and honey (no sugar), the flavor was so good.

My first time making sweet potato pie and follow some reviews putting mashed sweet potato in blender and puree it till smooth. I made 2 pies and reduce some sugar and substitue 3 1/2 cups of brown sugar. Added splash of lemon juice and dashes of allspice. Gave one to my friend and i received great praises even from my picky hubby who eats only pumpkin n sweet potato pies. This recipe is so great and i will make it again!

I made this for our local Lion's Club soup supper. I had never made a pie before and people were astounded how good it was. I'm from Kansas, so sweet potato pie isn't too popular here - everyone thought it was pumpkin pie which was good and bad at the same time. I was hoping for a bit more of a distinctive flavor but i don't think that's what sweet potato pie is all about.

This was my second time making this type of pie.The first time i just went from the top of my head with the ingredients and it came out to be horrible.This recipe was a lot different from my turn out the first time around. This pie recipe is the best I have tasted this far. If you are looking for a pie to knock your socks off here it is. Thanks for the recipe!!!!

I have made this recipe four or five times and my family loves it. Sometimes, I'll replace 1/4 of the milk with sweet condensed milk to make it a little sweeter. My family likes it better with the extra sweetener, but it's good either way.

I thought it was pretty good!  I made my own olive oil pie crust... and I substituted half of the white sugar for brown sugar.  I think i had to cook it longer also.

My family loved it!!!! It is by far the best sweet potato pie I have ever made! I made a few changes I cut up the potato into large chunks then cooled under cold water, it cut the boiling in half. and I used heavy whipping cream.  I also added decorative cinnamon/sugar leafs made out of extra pie crust arranged around the edges and a few in the center.  Thank you for the recipe.

I was glad I read the other reviews that said this would be "soupy" before pouring into pie dish.  A few things I would change for next time - use a deep dish pie crust.  I had to fill two pie crusts to use all the filling.  I would cut down on sugar - about a half cup maybe. 

Very good pie!

I have made this recipe for a few years now and it is a hit every time.  I didn't change a thing about the recipe.  It is exactly what I was looking for.  My grandmother used to make sweet potato pie, but her instructions were "just add a bit of this and a pinch of that".  This is the only recipe that gives my granny's pie a run for the money.  It is now a staple in all my holiday cooking.  If you are looking for a down home southern style sweet potato pie like you remember when you were little, you've found it.  Stop looking.

My parents raved about this and so did my friends!  They kept thinking it was pumpkin pie.  I, myself, have had better but this still tasted great!  I used 1 yam (substituted for the sweet potato) and I accidently added an extra cup of sugar (oops!).  It did NOT need the extra sugar.  I threw everything in the food processor and then baked the pie for 20min extra.  Yum!  Tastes so good after a night in the fridge.

I would use more sweet potato than described if you want a perfect-looking 9-inch pie - otherwise, when it sinks down, it's slightly less filling than it really ought to have. Oh, and I baked the sweet potato, which worked out fine. Tasted like my grandmother's sweet potato pie.

Excellent.  I made this pie for my first Thanksgiving dinner with my new in-laws.  Instead of boiling the potatoes, I pricked them with a fork and baked them at 375 degrees (F) for an hour and then peeled the skins off as soon as they were cool enough to handle.  (The warmer the potato pulp, the better it seems to incorporate with the remaining ingredients).  I also substituted heavy cream for the milk and used a frozen deep dish pie crust.  I followed the rest of the recipe as is, and the outcome was splendid!  The pie is just right.  Not too sweet.  Not too spicy.  And it tastes wonderful with whipped cream and a mixture of toasted pecans, amaretto or almond cookies, and cranberries (pulsed together in a food processor) sprinkled on top.  Thanks so much.

This was my first ever attempt at sweet potato pie.  Awesome!  I tested it out on my office in NC, and they loved it.  I used Splenda for baking and put in some lemon extract, skim milk (with 1/6 cup light coconut milk substituted).  Took 1 1/2 hrs to bake though.  Will try adding cornstarch next time.

For my first attempt at sweet potato pie, this didn't turn out half bad.  I followed the recipe to a T and it was pretty darned good, if I do say so myself.  BUT, I am used to a true southern, soul food version of sweet potatoe pie.  This was good but it wasn't the soul food pie.

The pie has a beautiful color, isn't too sweet, or too spicy.  It's a nice version of sweet potato pie so I'll still give it 4 stars out of 5.

This is the best Sweet Potato Pie recipe that I have come across. The flavor is just awesome and when it's baking the aroma gives you such an appetite that you can't wait for the pie to chill to bite into it. I have done this recipe dozens of times.

I found this pie to be really delicious, even though I made some changes to it.  Instead of boiling sweet potatoes, I bake them.  It brings out their sweetness and doesnt water-log their flavour. I used light brown sugar instead of white, evaporated milk instead of regular, used 2 tsp vanilla and omitted the nutmeg and used 2 tsp cinnamon.  It was ultra-cinnamony and ultra good!!!  (I really like cinnamon)

I have made Sweet Potato pie at the holidays for years because it was my dads favorite. We lost my father last year, but I had to make a pie.  This was "THE BEST" and the easiest recipe I have ever used.  My father would have loved it.  Don't wait to make this pie for your family.  Thanks Joyce and God Bless.

A good recipe.  I microwaved the sweet potato and it took about 9 minutes, turning it around halfway.  I added 1/2 tsp of lemon extract as per previous suggestions and it really changed the flavor; it no longer tasted exactly like pumpkin pie (good for variety's sake).  I melted mini-marshmallows over the top by placing them on the pie about 6 minutes before taking it out of the oven.  So far have made this 7 times (every Thanksgiving) and everyone loves it.
I have also made this with canned Sugary Sams and it is good/easy, but very sweet so I reduce the sugar if I'm using the canned.  I have also used 1 tsp rum instead of the lemon extract and, though good, I preferred the lemon.

This recipe rocks! I've never made sweet potato pie before, and I tried this recipe out last night.  It's fabulous.  My husband raved about it...even said it rivaled his grandmother's! I took some to work & they all loved it, too.  I did modify the recipie a little... I used small to medium sized potatoes (they are sweeter & have fewer strings), I steamed them instead of boiling them (it's quicker), I used margarine instead of butter, and I added a little rum (1t Bacardi 1873 rum). Also, I had to cook the pie about 75 minutes or so. I've made another pie to take to Thanksgiving dinner. Great recipe! I highly recommend it.

What a fine recipe! I did take the advice from other reviewers by cutting up the sweet potato (boiled for only 20 minutes & removed skin under cold water) and I decreased sugar to 1 1/2 cups (1/2 cup being brown sugar).  I thought it was too much nutmeg so I decreased it to 1/2 tsp and added 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice (I think allspice would have been a nice choice as well).  To top it off I added 1/4 tsp. orange extract. The original recipe is wonderful, these are just things that I like.  Joyce Waits is going to be a name known in our home around the holidays!

This was my first time baking a sweet potato pie.  It was the best ever.  The only thing I did differently was add 3/4 tsp lemon extract and I melted my butter so that it was easier to blend.  My husband and my co-workers simply loved it!!!!!! Thanks for the recipe.

This pie received rave reviews at my Thanksgiving dinner!!  Everyone wanted the recipe and said that it was the best they ever had.  I used yams instead of sweet potatoes, and baked them instead of boiling.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I used "Grandma's secret pie crust" from allrecipes.

A wonderful recipe. This is my first time making sweet potato pie and it turned out great. Wonderful texture and taste. Why the 4 stars? It was a little too sweet in my opinion so you may want to cut down on the sugar. Overall, a very good recipe, easy to follow and yummy to eat.

Excellent flavor, the texture is more like mashed potatoes than custard which is great for me but some people may prefer a recipe with more egg.  I get the whole nutmeg and grind it with mortar and pestle, and the flavor is just outstanding.

This was the best sweet potato pie that I've ever made.  I did add some flour to make sure it set well...but other than that, I followed the recipe and it turned out great.

WOW!  This was great!  I made two pies and I'm glad I did.  I ended up cooking this for about a half and hour longer because the middle just didn't look quite done.  I will use this again!

DELICIOUS!!!!  Made one last week and my husband said that it was right up there with his mom's (which is saying a lot)!!!!! I have a kitchen scale and it was easy to get a one pound potato and the pie texture was perfect. Now I have a recipe for a pie that I can easily follow. The taste is so good that my cousin is paying me to make a couple for her for Christmas.

My children absolutely LOVED this recipe!  I had never made a sweet potato pie before and they were skeptical to say the least. Once it was done, oh boy, they gobbled it up (this coming from children who claim to not like sweet taters)!  Great recipe A+

I thought this pie would be an easy one to make; however, the Fire Department almost had to visit my house. I put enough water in the pot to boil the 1 pound of sweet potatoes, but had to go outside for something. When I came back in the house was full of smoke, so I had to quickly ventilate the house before the smoke detector went off. SHEEWW!!! The water in the pot had boiled out, and scorched the potatoes. 

Despite the mishap, most of the potatoes were OK, and the pie turned out great. My family loved it! One minor note: I had to cook it for about 15 minutes longer than the recipe called for.

My Mom's Sweet Potato Pie recipe was way too complicated, so I tried this one and found it very delicious and a close 2nd to Mom's, but MUCH quicker and easier.  My 4-yr old twins were able to help.  The pie was a big hit all-around and is now weekly dessert staple.  I did have a problem with it not setting firmly enough, but if refridgerated overnight, that problem is solved.  In my South Caroline town these pies are served chilled anyway, so it worked out perfectly.  EXCELLENT AND DELICIOUS!!!

I had never made a sweet potato pie before, so I was glad to find out how easy it is to make.  This pie is very thick and delicious.  The only problem I had was cooking the potato.  The second time I made it, I cooked the potato in the microwave which cut the cooking time from over an hour and a half to about eight minutes.  The taste was the same.  I also used canned milk instead of regular milk on the second try which gave the pie a very rich custard taste.  Next time I may even try egg nog.

The only change that I made was I used canned sweet potatoes because that was what I had on hand.  I also added both granulated & brown sugar.  I also added a little orange juice to it for flavoring.  I added the sugar & orange juice while heating.  While hot, I added butter, milk & eggs.

Delicious! It was too sweet the first time I made it, but since the pie had a great blend of flavors, I tried it again with less sugar (about 1/3 less). It was absolutely delicious. I pricked the potatoes and placed in oven for about an hour out of convenience, and that was just fine. I used unsweetened almond milk because that's what I do.

I THOUGHT I didn't like Sweet Potato Pie. It was a regular dish for holidays growing up, but I never cared for the taste of it - until this recipe. I think the difference is the spices or the balance of them. It was surprisingly good and now it has become a favorite dessert when autumn rolls around. It's especially good when the sweet potatoes are baked instead of boiled, the sugar is 1/2 white and 1/2 brown, and an extra dash of cinnamon is added.

I used the canned sweet potatoes simply because of the ease of use and omitted the nutmeg because neither myself or husband likes the taste. I also cut the sugar in half and this pie was out of this world! My husband asked me to make it the following week and instructed me to keep Cool Whip in the house at all times for the topping! He absolutely loves it!

I made this pie for a neighbor's birthday. I've never had sweet potato pie before, much less made it, but this recipe made me a rock star. He said it reminded him of the sweet potato pie his mom used to make. No adjustments made.

I have made this several times for my friends, their parents and kids, and myself, and the answer is always the same: "AMAZING!!" Literally EVERYONE I've made it for says that it is better than pumpkin pie and then they look up at me like they've just learned that I know how to fly and go back in time. Want to impress your in-laws? Follow these simple instructions and take them on a ride to flavor city; you'll be a God in their eyes. Yeah, folks, it's that good.

This taste almost as good as my father’s pie. I baked 3 medium-sized sweet potatoes and added a splash of lemon juice to the mixture. This was enough for two store-bought pie crusts. Delicious!

Big hit at Thanksgiving 2018 - I used a frozen Marie Calendar’s pie shell and baked the shell for about 8 min then cooled it before putting filling in it. Instead of using fresh sweet potatoes, I used 1 can Bruce’s yams (29Oz or 1LB,13Oz) rinsed and drained. I beat the yams with a beater first till smooth before adding softened butter. Because the canned yams are in heavy syrup, only used 1/3 cup brown sugar. Also used Mexican vanilla and added 1 TBL flour to mixture. Absolutely delicious, better than pumpkin pie!

I have made probably 20 pies based on this recipe. The first time I made two (I always double it since the crust comes two to a package, besides why not two for the same amount of work) following the recipe exactly. The pies were really good and deserve 5 stars. Since then I have used several different suggestions from other reviews attempting to make a 6 star pie. Now I always make them the same way. Bake the sweet potatoes they retain more flavor than boiled, put pealed potatoes & butter in my kitchen aid mixer to whip them for about 10 min. Add sugar 1/2 light brown 1/2 regular , use evaporated milk, 1  tablespoon flour then all the rest of the ingredients as listed in the recipe. Whip all of it together for about 5 min. Bake as directed. The pies come out so smooth and taste wonderful. I have had more people ask for this recipe  than any other pie I make. Thanks to everyone for sharing the best sweet potato pie recipe I have ever tasted.

The only thing I did differently was not adding the vanilla. It tastes just fine every time I’ve made pies. This was the best recipe.

I think I've made this pie about 3 times over the  years. I think my pie can compete against my mom's pie. I've used it with the Hot Water Pie Crust recipe from this site. Last night I used the Butter Flaky PIe Crust recipe. I had troubles with that crust for this pie (but did not have trouble with that crust with a Dutch Apple Pie I baked the evening before... oddly). Anyway this third iteration was weird because I cooked it at 350 for over an hour. I took it out because the top was starting to burn and the center had finally puffed up. But it wasn't quite done yet. So  I turned the oven off and left it in the oven for a couple of hours. It finally firmed up later that evening, and even more overnight. Nevertheless, I don't plan on switching recipes since this is fairly reliable. In the future I make bake it at a lower temperature and maybe use only 1 egg to keep it from being so wiggly (or more flour and/or corn starch). Also I really love eating after it’s been in the fridge. Yes, nice and warm is great, but it’s delicious cold too!

Lazy pie maker here. Awesome pie! Used my Instant Pot to make the potato- but then forgot they were in there. It switched to warm for over 5 hours. By then too late to make pie. In the fridge overnight. Used my Vitamix the next day. Put in the egg and milk first, then potato. Blend until smooth. Realized I forgot the vanilla, spice, and sugar so in it went, blend until smooth. Poured into a ready made crust. I liked it with 1 cup sugar, but I love sweet. Plan on trying a healthy adaptation next with half the butter, fat free milk, and splenda... doubt it will beat the awesomeness we just at tonight though! Oh- and no strings if you use the vitamix.

This a great recipe. I make a few alterations. I often sub the milk for half and half of I have it. I always separate the egg white and beat  it
For about 2-3 minutes before adding. . I also add a tsp of ginger and About 1 tbsp of flour.

This is an excellent sweet potato pie. Right off the bat however, I halved the sugar because I already knew that I like custard pies, pumpkin pies, etc. to be only mildly sweet, so I just used 1/2 cup of sugar and that was perfect for me. The pie has excellent texture and sets up nicely. I used an immersion blender to puree the mixture. I think that helps give it a really smooth texture. I like my potato/pumpkin pies to be completely smooth, and a hand mixer just doesn't do a good enough job of mixing for me.

I made this using canned coconut milk in lieu of regular milk, subbing honey for sugar, and modifying the cooking temperature/time for high altitude cooking (5ooo feet). Since I used an equal amount of honey instead of sugar, the mixture was very liquidy, which I want for high altitude. I lowered the baking temperature to 325° and ended up baking it for 85 minutes. The results were delectable. I'm definitely going to be making this again.

I used sweet condensed milk, less sugar and squeezed a lemon into the  mix. I used a graham cracker crust (YUCK) instead of a dough based crust. Overall, I will use this recipe again, it tasted good. I was told to use coconut milk as well. I will try that next time

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. It tastes very similar to pumpkin pie, and since we love pumpkin pie we loved this one too. I will definitely make this one again.

I have been making this recipe for years. I do half white and half brown sugar. I also occasionally use evaporated milk.  I make my own pie crust and I have yet to hear any complaints from those that have tasted it. I will say not to boil your potatoes. Roast them in the oven with skin on until soft and scoop out the flesh. Just last week i steamed a few in my instant pot with much faster results. I find that using my hand mixer gets rid if the strings. I'll see the strings wrapped around the attachments and have never found any in my pies.

Best sweet potato pie I’ve ever made. In addition to the recipe, add the 1/2 cup each of white and brown sugar, the tablespoon of flour for firmness and the two teaspoons of lemon juice as suggested in the reviews. You will not be disappointed.

First, I use Ina Garten's Perfect Pie Crust Recipe and cut it in half for only one crust. 

Changes to the ingredients of this pie are:

1. I begin with around 19oz of potatoes. I use Jewel and Garnet, and it's okay to use both in a single pie. It's like different apples in an apple pie.  Peel them with a carrot peeler, dice and boil.  This results in about 17ounces for the pie. I do weigh it out. 

I only use 3/4 cup sugar.

2. I high-heap a teaspoon of cinnamon.

3. Heap a 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg.

4. Add 1/8 teaspoon cloves.

5. As you're pouring the vanilla into the teaspoon, spill over a few drops. It's okay.

6. Whisk one egg, and egg wash the crust and inside edge. Pour in the pie filling. Bake.

7. I bake at 375 for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Ovens are different. This pie doesn't bake well for me at 350. I like my pies done in the middle! You do need for a knife in the center to come out clean.  I also like to see cracks around the edge of the filling as it puffs up like a soufflé, and light browning on any peaks.
Because of the longer bake time the crust could burn. When the crust has reached the golden appearance you like, place a foil ring over it, and continue to bake. In fact, make the ring before you put it in the oven. 

PS...I am the 1976 Yam Queen from Gilmer Texas, Home of the East Texas Yamboree. Girlfriend, I know my Yam Pies.

We have a great restaurant neayby that has sweet potato everything, including waffles. My husband said this pie is better!

The most important change that I made was to bake the sweet potato instead of boiling it! The flavor is so much better.

I took people's advice and, added tbsp of flour, used canned milk instead of regular milk, added 3 tsp of fresh lemon juice, and used 1/2 cup of white & 1/2 cup of light brown sugar (instead of all white sugar). 

I like a rich tasting pie, so I used about 3/4 tsp of nutmeg and cinnamon (a tad bit more than 1/2 recommended).

I also added another 1/2 tsp of vanilla.


EXCELLENT PIE!

This is a good recipe and turns out well. I have made it several times. The sweet potatoes should be warm and the butter soft or it can curdle. I halved the amount of sugar and it was perfect. The first time I made it I used the full amount and it was way too sweet. the second time I used three quarters of a cup but it was still too sweet. Half a cup was just right and I did not change any of the other ingredients. I prebake my pie crust first for approx 7 -10 mins pricking it with a fork so it does not puff up. Then bake it with the filling in in a pie plate on top of a baking sheet so the crust gets cooked on the bottom and is not soggy.

I have NEVER made any kind of pie before and I nailed this one. My family and I do not eat a lot of sweet so I cut back on the sugar a bit, other than that it is perfect. I have made it even though is not Thanksgiving. Wonderful recipe...thank you.

As another reviewer suggested, I used a 1/2 cup of brown sugar. For the crust I ground up gingersnaps and melted butter and pushed it into the bottom of the pan..yumm!!! I squeezed half a lime into the batter and added some allspice and ginger to the nutmeg and cinnamon blend. This was The Best sweet potato pie ever and such an easy recipe! Thank you!! For an extra fun kick add some marshmallows to the top! You won't be disappointed!!!

Made this for a friend, she is 84 and has to watch her sugar.  I cut the sugar down first time to 3/4 cup then to 1/2 cup.  It is still a great Pie.   She loved it.  She ate all but a slice over a two day time.   Thank you could not have done this without you.  You seldom see her want or eat anything.   Again Thank you

Because I have to watch my fat intake, used only 1/4 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of sugar & used 'Reduced fat crescent rolls' for crust! superb!

I used yams instead of sweet potato and left out the nutmeg. The pie turned out awesome! This is a must have.

I have a potato baking cloth I use to bake my potatoes in the microwave. The texture is SO much better making your potato pie with this! Richer potato taste. Also I did do the brown sugar and white sugar along with the evaporated milk. Absolutely 100% the best potato pie I've ever made! My new recipe for Sweet Potato Pie!!!!

This is a great recipe! I switched mine up and replaced the milk with a can of sweetened condensed milk. Also in the interest of time I washed my sweet potato, placed it in a plastic bag and microwaved it to soften it for mixing. Prior to adding the ingredients I mix the potato with my hand mixer to pull the excess strings from it. Makes for a smooth rich pie every time! My beau asks me to make one at least once a month! Lol

I made the suggested change of regular milk to evaporated milk and took this to my family's Christmas dinner. Everyone liked it and enjoyed it but upon asking for comments, several suggested maybe a touch more nutmeg or cinnamon.  I think I will try that but we still really enjoyed it like it is!

I followed the recipe and made 2 pies for Christmas. I loved the evaporated milk flavor which gave a southern taste. This is now my keeper when making in the future.

I found this recipe to be a good base recipe for the pie. I found the filling to be too soupy. I added flour to the recipe. I also found that it needed more cinnamon and nutmeg. I added until I was happy with the taste. I also added brown sugar to taste. The pie was so perfect my friends didn't believe I made it.

This pie was decent, but the amount of butter is ridiculous. It was swimmingly in butter.
I made the following changes when I made the pie:
1. Replace half the white sugar with brown sugar
2. Add 1/4tsp cloves
I will make this again, but I'll cut the butter in half for sure.

I doubled this recipe and instead of milk I used Southern Comfort "vanilla spice" eggnog.  It came out Awesome!!! Some say it was so good that it rivaled their mothers sacred sweet potato pie!  Added note... I hold back a little bit of the sugar since the eggnog is sweet... then mix everything up... then add more sugar (if needed) to your personal taste.  This pie has been my secret weapon for years, then I finally decided to share my secret with a few friends.  lol

I made this exactly according to recipe and loved every bite! Well actually I made the pie filling exactly according to the recipe. I did not make the pie crust.  The sweet potato filling was delicious even without the crust. In fact, I am making it again even as I write this review. Yummmmm! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

First time making sweet potato pie, and it is delicious! A few changes I made were using 1/3 cup of white sugar and 1/3 up of brown sugar as it was a little too sweet. I also used 1/2 teaspoon of ginger powder as well.

I don't make pies. That said,  my daughter asked me to make a sweet potato pie for Thanksgiving and this is the one I choose.  I love all things all pumpkin, so I figured this would be okay.  I read many of the reviews and made some adjustments, accordingly.  This is my new favorite pie, ever.  I will make it from now on, every Thanksgiving and Christmas.  It is that good.  It does taste like pumpkin, but lighter, fluffier....better!
I used pre-made, frozen pie crusts and I used both for this filling, next time I will use a deep dish and make one pie. (I didn't read the instructions clearly on this!) 
I baked the sweet potatoes (I used yams, btw) the night before in the oven.  The next day I used my food processor and whipped them up in there in case there were any stringy pieces.  Other minor changes, I used evaporated milk.  I added 2 tbs of flour and maybe a tsp of lemon juice.  I also used 1/2 cup each brown and white sugar.   I have a feeling, it still would have been fabulous even without the little changes!

This pie is terrific and I've been making it for several years. I use less sugar as its really sweet with the full amount, and I use half brown and half granulated sugars. I tend to add more cinnamon.

I made 4 pies today with this recipe and it was SOOO GOOD.  I baked my sweet potatos instead of boiling. I had enough mix for 4 pies because I had 3 pounds of potatos  so i trippled the recipe. I only used 2.5 cups of sugar instead of 3. The only issue I had is that once it cooled and I cut the pie, it fell apart.  I can not figure out why.  I will make it again once I figure out how to keep it from falling apart!

I microwave the sweet potato - I think that helps keep it together. I've also made this with pecans on top (25 min. into baking), subbing Greek yogurt for the butter, and 1/2 the sugar. It's so easy and delicious!

Simple and fantastic. This got rave reviews from some friends who grew up eating sweet potato pie. The only tweaks I made were to add 1/4 tsp ground ginger and a tsp of lemon juice, and to use evaporated milk rather than regular milk, as recommended by other reviewers. 

Also, if your sweet potatoes don't quite add up to a pound, you can scale back the other ingredients so that the ratio is right. I had 2 sweet potatoes and I thought they would be enough, but ended up coming up short--I had probably more like 3/4 lb, or about 1 1/3 cups of cooked, mashed sweet potato. .  So I scaled back the butter and the sugar so that it wouldn't be too greasy or too sweet. I used about 1/3 cup butter and 2/3 cup sugar (half white and half brown). I kept the original amounts of milk and eggs since I wanted the custard to still set well, and I also used the amounts of seasonings as written. It turned out awesome, and it actually still filled the pie crust pretty well--the level of the custard was only a little bit low. If there had been much more custard, the pie would have been close to overflowing.  Thanks for an easy and awesome recipe!

This is perfectly delicious. I made it as instructed without adding ingredients, *but pay attention to 1 POUND of sweet potatoes. (I used two large sweet potatoes= 1 lb). I also had to bake it almost *30 mins longer, after checking every 10. (If you bake longer as I did, remember to cover the pie gently with tin foil, after the first hour, so the crust does not burn!) Now, it is proper texture and cuts cleanly! Perfect!

This recipe has been a "holiday must"  for my family over the past 3 or 4 years. I have even had people ask me to make them their own pies. Anyone who has eaten this pie has loved it. The only thing I changed was that I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk and I used frozen deep dish pie crusts. This recipe is amazingly delicious!

I have never made a sweet potato pie before and my fiance' was telling me that he preferred sweet potato pie over pumpkin. I found this recipe and he absolutely loved it. The only thing I changed was instead of purchasing the potato's I bought a 1 lb can of yams. I had to pop out two pies in just a few hours so this definitely saved time. Oh! I also bought the unbaked pie crusts from the frozen area at Kroger's. They were selling them 2 for $1.00 and each packet had two pie crusts in it. Great deal and tasted wonderful. Thank you!

Omg!!!! What can I say I love this receipe!!! My first time trying it and boy oh boy it was a hit!!! I used some of the suggestions in the reviews, half brown sugar, half white sugar, and a tsp of lemon extract. I also twert it by adding a half of can of pumpkin puree. It seem to help with testure and taste! So I guess this pie was more like a sweet potatoes pumpkin pie ;-)!! No one knew the difference all they knew was my sweet potatoes pies was the BOMB!!! This coming from  African American  southern soul cooks who have master sweet pototoes pie and others. To hear them say they loved my pie really made me proud!!!! They ate both pies and wanted more!!!!! I have people putting in orders!!!

I've made this recipe for quite some time now!!! But I do add a few things.  I use 1 teaspoon of lemon extract along with the vanilla extract. I substitute evaporated milk for the regular milk and use fresh nutmeg!!!  Love it!!!

This pie was great. Honestly I never appreciated sweet potato pie,  and still not to crazy about them. I made this because,  my lovely wife likes them. And at first I thought the batter was to runny,  so I took the advice of other reviews and added 3tbs of flour. though I probably didn't have to. I'd definitely recommend

Delicious pie! I have been told this is the best sweet potato pie some people have ever had. This was my first sweet potato pie I've ever made, was very easy to follow and make. The only problem I had was I had to leave it in for more around an hour and a half to finish baking.

This was the FIRST time making a SPP for me. I compared other recipes and the only thing I did here was replace EVAPORATED milk for the milk portion.
From my reviewers: "It was a HIT!!! A "recipe keeper"! Better than my momma's!"  So I guess I will keep making this recipe.  The ONLY thing I would say is that it was a little too sweet for me.  I might cut down the sugar next time.

A friend of mine wanted a sweet potate pie , I agreed. This is my 1st time making one, I  used this recipe and the pies taste AMAZING!!!! Thank you, I did add 1tsp flour per pie, I see where a lot of reviewers suggesting 1/2 brown and 1/2 regular sugar,  I'll try that the next time. I would suggest make sure all ingredients are room temp and your potatoes are cooled!!!!

This recipe is delicious!  I did bake the pie longer than noted - which took care of the runny/loose issue others mentioned.  I also added a pinch of clove.  AND made mini pies with the leftover pie crust and extra filling using a muffin pan (baked for about 45 mins).

I just made this recipe, it was GREAT! My boyfriend doesn't like sweet potatoes but he has definitely changed his mind!! I used coconut palm sugar instead of white sugar  and added flour like someone earlier had suggested. I posted my picture, it came out beautiful and I can't wait to share some with others.

A very easy and delicious recipe. I mix in a food processor to eliminate the fibrosis strings. I also reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup.

Really yummy. I substituted the milk for rice milk and used smart balance dairy free to make it safe for my son who is allergic to dairy. I also make a more complicated one with dairy for the rest of the family and this one won the taste test hands down.

Almost as good as Mama's!
This recipe is almost a good but after tweaking it a little it got as close as I could get it (Mama was renowned for her pie).
First I used Mexican vanilla flavor which enhanced the flavor of the potatoes, I also baked the potatoes instead of boiling. This gave the pie better color and a deeper taste. I made two pies so I used 6 medium potatoes and used a stick and a half of butter and increased the cinnamon & nutmeg to a teaspoon and a half. Used a cup and a half of sugar.  This gave me enough filling for two deep dish pies...delish!

This is the first time I made sweet potato pie and it was very nice. I do have to admit that I added extra spice. I use organic cylon cinnamon so I doubled the amount and it brings such a fruity flavor to anything you bake, its the best. I did not have any milk on hand so I used cream instead and it came out very rich and creamy, more of a thick pudding than a dense filling.  Will make this again for sure.

It tasted so good! I used a square glass pan and rolled the dough into a square shape.and it still cooked fin extra cinnamon and a little less nutmeg and it still tasted great. My whole family loves it.

Awfully sweet, especially if you're going to top it with whipped cream. I recommend cutting the sugar down to 3/4 cup.

This is great pie...used about 3 cups of mashed sweet potato, buttermilk instead of reg. milk, added 1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour to thicken it a bit and reduced the sugar to about 3/4 cup. Made a dense pie which for me is preferable over a "whipped" kind of pie.

The longest time was boiling the 1 pound sweet potato. Mine took about an hour to boil. Then it was nice and soft when I stuck it with a fork. This is a Great recipe!!! Simple, easy and delicious.

I've been making sweet potato pie for 35 years and I have to say using other reviewers suggestions and adding my own tweaks this is the best pie I've ever tasted! Half brown half white sugar, 1 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp allspice, 1 tbl lemon juice, 2 tbl black strap molasses, 1 tbl flour, heavy cream, and I doubled the recipe, made 2 in Marie Calender deep dish shells. Absolutely Fantastic! 10 stars!

I made this for my Thanksgiving meal. I doubled the spices and accidentally omitted the vanilla extract & orange zest. It still turned out fine. It was a bit sweet but the Hubby says leave it as is. I used 3 medium sized sweet potatoes (about 1 pound) and i had a little bit of filling left over so I baked it in a small ramekin and used it as a "taste tester."

I followed the directions exactly, baked it for 60 minutes, and it came out perfect!  It seemed quite sweet so next time I make it, I might reduce the amount of sugar as others have suggested.

I used canned sweet potatoes. I drain them, mash them with hand masher then I put them in the mixer and add the rest of ingredients. Saves the time from cooking and peeling. The pie turns out perfect.

I never boil sweet potatoes.    I zap in microwave or bake until soft. This makes for more consentrated flavor.  It saves nutrients and keeps filling from being too watery.

I have made this recipe several times over the years for Thanksgiving and everyone loves it.  It's not overloaded with spices and is a nice creamy texture.  I always substitute reduced fat milk and light butter when I make it though but that doesn't affect quality.

Delicious!  I used a store bought biscuit shell and peeled the potatoes before boiling and just used the same method as for mashed potatoes. Also used less sugar.  Came out beautifully light and creamy.  Next time I make this I will use coconut milk or evaporated milk.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This sweet potato pie recipe never disappoints. One change I made is that I bake the sweet potatoes rather than boil; I prefer the consistency. Remember - use SWEET potatoes, not yams. Finally, have fun with the cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar (I use less sugar) and taste the mix before you bake. If it is good, it is ready for the oven. Enjoy!

I have used this recipe more than once. Love it. My wife and kids thought that is was a pumpkin pie. I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar one time. That worked well. A tip on baking this pie: The timer is just a starting point. Wait for the entire top of the pie to raise up like a soufflé. Mine took an extra 20 minute. The pie was firm enough to hold a piece in your hand to eat it. My boys like that. No plate, no fork.

Excellent recipe.  The pie was creamy, and buttery.  Here are my changes:  I only used 2/3 cup of sugar though and it was perfect.  I also used evaporated milk instead of regular milk and added 1 tablespoon of flour.   Keeper recipe. Thank you.

I'll give it 4 stars. It's good but not great. I took anothers advice and added some lemon juice and mixed the sugar half and half with white and brown. It still was a little too "loose" in my opinion. However yes, whip the potatos with a blender before adding the other ingredients. Also a tooth pick will work instead of a knife to test to see if its done....less obvious. ;)

I felt compelled to write a review of this because it was so successful. I didn't read all of the reviews before making it and so just followed the recipe (used nearly 3 cups of sweet potato because it seemed that they would fit.) I was a little concerned because the butter did not fully incorporate into the mixture (potatoes were cold...had cooked them the day before and refrigerated) but all worked out well. When making again, I will cream the sugar and butter beforehand (as suggested in other comments). The pie turned out wonderfully anyway and got rave reviews. Couldn't be simpler.

Very good recipe though I always love to do something a bit different to my pies. Some changes: I used 1/4 cup of white sugar, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/4 cup of sweet condensed milk; also replaced milk with evaporated milk; used two different types of large "roots"--regular yams (the orange one) but also Japanese sweet potato (purple skin, golden inside) and I washed, stabbed them with the knife a few times, and baked them both the night before for 50-60 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (baking makes it much sweeter because it causes the sugar in potatoes to caramelize!!); Finally, I made my own crust that is very similar to cheesecake crust using graham crackers, ginger snaps, sugar and butter. Turned into one heck of a pie!! I will be making this again for sure. :)

I've been using this recipe for nearly ten years. I've made several versions over the years. My favorite is to substitute the milk with heavy cream (in the carton). For the sugar, I use half white sugar, half brown sugar and I add a teaspoon of brandy (my preference) or rum (if I don't have any brandy), and a 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract. I usually make about four pies every time because friends steal whole pies when I make them. Tip: To avoid stringiness of sweet potatoes, use a hand mixer, and remove the strings on the beaters and discard. I usually add an extra small sweet potato to the recipe to compensate for the stringy potato I will discard from the beaters. I hate strings in my pies.

Extremely easy!! The only changes I made is instead of pie crust I made sugar cookies and drop them by the spoonful in a buttered muffin tin and par bake it for 7mins. Then added hefty size dollop of sweet potato pie filling and bake it per recipe! It's delicious!

You know this may be even better than pumpkin pie.  This is the first time I have made sweet potato pie from scratch.  I made the pie crust too.  Easy Homemade Pie Crust By: Chef John here at allrecipes.com 
By the way I used 1/2 cup each of white and brown sugar.

Delicious pie... I'm not a fan of too much sweetness though, so I only used half a cup of sugar. Worked out very sweet still.

Instead of adding milk and sugar I replaced it with condensed milk and also mixed in a spoonful of a can od yams in light syrup to get a nice full flavor.  Good recipe with a little bit of improvising. Thx

First of all, I must say, I HATE sweet potatoes!  My son left some here so I thought I'd try it.  This pie is awesome!!  The only things I changed were, I used evaporated milk and used pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon/nutmeg. Baked up perfect!  Don't know how people ended up with a runny or too sweet pie?  This will be one of the desserts on the menu this week at the restaurant I bake at!!!

This pie was good but not GREAT! I have had a great sweet potato pie before so I am on the hunt for something like that. I cooked this pie an additional 20 mins and it was still not super firm like pumpkin but firm enough to cut. This pie didn't wow at all, but wasn't bad.

Ive been making this recipe for two years now, and its always a hit with my American in-law family and friends. Its so delicious that when I offer people ice cream with it, most of them refuse it!  Per other reviews and personal taste and experience, I made few additions/ modifications: I use 3 medium potatoes,  double the spices, I add some clove, 2Tb fresh lemon juice, 1-2 Tb flour (according to how runny the composition is), I reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup and of course I use half brown half cane sugar,  I reduce the milk by 1/4 and replace it sometimes with half and half. I bake it at 425 for 10 min, than reduce the temperature to 350 and bake it for 40-45 more min.

I made this pie a few times. The first time I added 1/2 Tabelspoon of Nutmeg and Cinnamon instead of 1/2 Teaspoon and it ended up tasting like pumpkin pie. (still good though) the second time I put the right amount of ingredients and brought it to my Church's agape sunday dinner. My husband said it was better than the first and everyone who tried it said it was really good :) 
I tweaked the recipe just a little by only putting 1/2 cup white sugar and adding 1/2 cup brown sugar :)

This is a great recipe, basically the same as my mother's.  She recently passed at 99 years of age.  I just jumped on this site to see if I could find subtle changes that might make it a little different.  The addition of stiff egg whites should mak it a tad lighter.  The last time I made sweet potato pies I used spiced rum as half of the liquid, a definite plus!

This pie was delicious! Very easy to make. I used a very large sweet potato and had to boil it about 15 minutes longer than the recipe suggests but it turned out great. I am going to try making one this weekend substituting a graham cracker crust.

This recipe is really good as is but I found that it's even better with a couple of changes.  I like to bake the sweet potatoes instead of boiling them. If you have time, I think the flavor is better with baking. I also use half brown and half white sugar.  The first time I made this pie, I thought it was a little too sweet for me so I use slightly less than 1 cup of sugar. It turns out really yummy!

This is a 5 star recipe! I used sweet potatos from my garden, and made my own crust. I increased the amounts slightly to fill a 10" pie. Great flavor and texture.

First time I've made OR eaten sweet potato pie - I loved it.  Waaaaay better than pumpkin pie!  I reduced the sugar in the recipe to just 1/2 cup brown sugar since sweet potatoes are plenty sweet already.  I used half-and-half instead of milk too.  SO delicious!

This pie was excellent! Made it for Thanksgiving and many who had never tried sweet potato pie said it was better than their beloved pumpkin! 
I took the advice of "SL": added a little flour to the mixture, substituted half the sugar for brown sugar and I added a little cloves and ginger.  

I also added chopped pecans to the top, because I love them with sweet potato.

Very delicious! The only thing I would do differently next time would be to add only 3/4 c. sugar, it was a big sweet for my personal tastes, but others thought the sweetness was perfect.

So I have made this my go to recipe for sweet potato pie for a few years now! My hubby goes crazy for it (literally).  I do make a few tweaks to it though. I add a 1/2 teaspoon of allspice and cloves each. I also strain the mixture through a sieve.  Sweet potatoes can be a bit fibrous and I like a silky smooth pie!

Love this recipe. It is a new Thanksgiving tradition in our home. I've been making it for the past years now. Everyone loves it. We used to make mashed potatoes and sweet potato casserole for dinner, but always ended up with a ton of the casserole left and nobody ever finished it. Wtih the pie, we please sweet potato lovers and never any leftovers.

This was the best sweet potato pie I've ever tasted.  I actually took on a sweet potato pie because I had canned sweet potatoes last season and needed to use them.  Because they were already in sweet syrup, even though I drained them, I didn't add the sugar and I reduced the milk a little, but I imagine it would have been fairly similar to have started with freshly boiled potatoes.  I'll look forward to sharing this with other people, and am officially planning to volunteer for dessert duty this year for the holidays :)

Husband grew sweet potatoes for the first time.  They were pretty skinny little guys....too skinny for our favorite baked sweets.  So thought it might be good to try the pie.   SOOOO glad I did!  This recipe had the most reviews, so made this one.  Used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 dark brown and used evaporated milk as we only drink almond milk.....   Pie was terrific!  A little cool whip and YUM!  Will definitely make with some more of my weird skinny potatoes!

Well, This was my first time making a sweet pot. pie, not to mention I've never liked any store bought one that I've tried.  But This was soooo good.  Many said it was too sweet, but not to my taste.  I think the next time i will do 1/2 sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  Also i may try baking the pot. opposed to boiling just to see if there is a difference. I used a store bought pie crust and it was filled to the brimm! Thx so much for the recipe. I cant wait to make another one!

Great pie!  I made this a little less sweet and served it warm as a side dish!.  Next day, I topped it with large marshmellows, baked under the broiler til they were browned, then served the pie for dessert!

Good stuff!

This was the first sweet potato pie I have made and while the recipe was easy and the pie baked up just fine, I thought the filling was too sweet. I made 4 of these pies for my daughter to serve in her class as part of her Kentucky State presentaton since it's a favorite Southern food. Though I thought it was too sweet for my taste, most of the kids loved it & several asked for seconds, which I didn't expect. The only change I made was to peel the sweet potatoes and cut them in chunks to boil as I was short on time & didn't have an hour to boil them whole. Overall, a good recipe, but I will reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup in the future.

Ok I only rated this 5 star because other people loved it. To make it was very easy. I followed others opinions and added 2 tbs flour to the mix, cooked it 70 mins and then when the timer went off I turned the oven off and cracked the oven door and let it cool down in there for 40 mins. It honestly turned out perfect. I on the other hand couldnt get past the taste. I think i was expecting to much, it looked like pumpkin pie but when you taste it its not, I guess my brain didnt comprend it. Overall everyone else loved loved loved it. I will make again for a get together.

I am not a fan of pumpkin pie, so when I made this I realized half way through that it tasted too much like pumpkin and I did not enjoy it. the rest of my family loved it! I would make it again for holiday gatherings

Turned out perfect! I did use more than a pound of sweet potato though. When I mesured it all out it wasn't enough to fill my pie pan at all ( I must have a large pie pan)! I just added more sweet potato and it turned out really well!

My husband used to have to wait until Fall to find a (popular pie maker's) pie offered in sweet potato! I have made 4 pies in 2 weeks and I'm about to make 2 more today! I took another reviewer's advice and mixed 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar. This is a great, easy recipe! Trust me, just make it, you won't be sorry!

This was very good.  I only had skim milk, however, and it made my mix very watery, so I added two and a half tablespoons of flour to help it firm up.  Still, it took much longer to cook than it should have done.  Next time, I think I will use evaporated milk to help make it thicker.  Delicious taste!

This is my go to recipe for sweet potato pie. The flavors work well and the pie filling, when baked, is the perfect consistency. For me, I like my pie a little sweeter, so I added a 1/4 c. sugar. Perfect with Edy's Double Vanilla Ice Cream.

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it.

Okay -- so my hubby didn't like this at all - I did. I think he didn't like it because I told him what it was!!! This was my first attempt making sweet potato pie but I will be making it in the future.

This was awesome!  Everyone loved it.  I think the pies are better the day after.  After being in the fridge overnight setting.  The deep dish required a lot of time to cook and wasn't set after cooking.  I thought I'd have to remake the next day but no!  The next day they were perfect!  I used a frozen pie crust.  Made this recipe twice.  The first time measured the wrong amount of butter and used 50% more than the recipe called for......so I just added more sweet potatoes.  Turned out delicious!  This one I used a deep dish 9 inch pan.  Had enough for two.   When I re-made with regular pie crust and used the correct amount of butter and sweet potatoes ( a bit over 2+ cups mashed) it filled 2 as well.  Everyone raved.  I also used 1/4 tsp cloves and 1/4 tsp of ginger besides the nutmeg and cinnamon.  Whole milk.  One set of pies, forgot vanilla and was still good!  The pies are excellent warm or straight out of fridge

Soo very very good!! This was my first sweet potato pie, and i immediately made another right after tasting it. I dont have measuring tools so cant say i followed the recipe exactly, i'm pretty sure i added tiny bit more of the spices.

Made last night. Used half brown and half white sugar. It was very sweet and will play with the sugar content. Maybe go down to 3/4 cup. Also used evaporated milk. It was perfect, simple flavors. Not overly spicy which is how I like it. I can't stop eating it!

this is the best...it's so simple! Except for the sweet potato, the rest of the ingredients are staples in most kitchens...and sweet potatoes are beginning to be since they are so healthy.Wouldn't think of trying any other recipes.

Fantastic!  I followed the advice from others and used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.  The flavor is divine!  Also, I added 2 tablespoons of flour to have better consistency.  This recipe is a real winner.

Made this and added about 2 tbls of rum...OMG!  We were hiding the pie from everyone cause we did not want to share! Will be making this every year as it is now going in the family cookbook! Also I just microwaved the potatoes, and scraped the flesh out the beat them before adding the rest of the ingredients.

My husband told me last year that it tasted better and was sweeter than the pumpkin pie.  So this year I'm serving it at the end of the meal instead. Just top with whipped cream and serve.

Made this tonight for Thanksgiving dinner. I thought it need a LOT more cinnamon and nutmeg; I think I added about a tablespoon of each. I like strong flavors, though. I used a storebought shortbread crust 'cause I didn't have time to make my own, and I thought it paired perfectly with this. I also topped the pie with the topping from Gourmet Sweet Potato Classic and it was perfect. My fiance's sister and even his picky mom loved it.

It was a hit!! Hands down. I only made a few changes!   I used 3 medium sweet potato and microwaved them. Boiling them removes all the nutrients. Also, added Ginger and Jamician AllSpice. I used just over a half a cup of sugar.  I also, carmelized whole pecan halves and decorated the top after baking. Yum!!

I've always thought the Sweet Potato Pie my family has traditionally made for the last 3 generations was the best in the world.  But I was wrong.  This is absolutely the BEST Sweet Potato Pie I've ever eaten and (apologies to my family members) I'll be making this one from now on every Thanksgiving!  Awesome recipe!

Delish! We whipped this up tonight in preparation for Turkey Day tomorrow. My boyfriend had a hankering for some sweet potato pie this Thanksgiving, just the way he remembered it from home. We tried this recipe tonight, only altering the sweet potatoes from 1 pound to 2 pounds because it didn't look like quite enough filling with just the 1 pound. I was surprised by how sweet the filling is, even despite the fact that we doubled the amount of sweet potato. He whisked it by hand until it was smooth and we poured and baked! Easy as pie. The BF loves the way it turned out, and he said it is just like he remembers his Aunt making at home in Memphis. Thanks for sharing this great recipe that I'm certain I'll be making for years to come!

It came out to be a very delicious pie, but the next time I make it I'll use only 1/8 of a teaspoon of nutmeg, because when I made this, the nutmeg really stood out and I want the potato to stand out more. Other than that, it was a very good pie :)

An excellent Sweet Potato Pie recipe that is uber easy to make.  The end result is "Sweet Potato Pie"!!  You know how sometimes you try out a recipe and you taste it, it's nothing like what you thought it would be.  You don't have to worry about that with this recipe... This is exactly what it says it is, a yummy sweet potato pie.

I made this tonight and it is a winner. I microwaved the potatoes and scooped out the insides with a spoon. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I served it with whipped cream. It's the first time I've made sweet potato pie and my husband and I loved it. I will be making this recipe again.

PHENOMENAL!!!!!!  I did 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and added a dash of ground cloves as well.  But I must say, this would have been just as spectacular without the changes.  I've never had sweet potato pie before, and have always thought pumpkin was "ok", but this is just fabulous!!!!  This will be a staple at the Thanksgiving table for sure and any other time of the year too!  Thanks for sharing!!!

I've never made a pie before, so I decided to try this one for Thanksgiving. It was fantastic! Everyone loved it. The only thing I changed was I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, and added 3 Tbsp of flour. I will definitely be making this again!

This was my first ever sweet potato pie. I'd like to say I messed up and accidentally bought Asian Sweet Potatoes, but that was awesome. This recipe made with Asian Sweet Potatoes is wonderful. A bit sweet at first but not so much the next day.

This was a hit!  I did reduce the sugar and added a bit of lemon extract.  I also replaced some of the butter with coconut oil.

What a wonderful recipe!  I had a large sweet potato already baked and just scooped it out and mashed it with all the other ingredients.  It turned out beautiful and delicious -- just the right consistency.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

Growing up in the Northeast it's all about the pumpkin pie, but I don't know, if in all good conscience, I can make another pumpkin pie again. The flavor of this pie is so much more complex than a pumpkin pie. I added the sugar a little at a time, because I've heard complaints about other sweet potato pies being to sweet, but this amount ended up being perfect for the sweet potatoes I had. Amazing...the in-laws won't know what hit 'em next Thanksgiving!

This pie was the bomb!!!! (delicious).  I was very surprised since it was so simple to make, and didn't call for the loads of ingredients that I ususally use.  My family loved it.  I made two 2-weeks ago, and I'm preparing to make two more for dinner tonight.  I will diet tomorrow :)

This was really tasty, the only thing I changed was adding half a teaspoon of allspice and cut the sugar down to half a cup, and a tablespoon of flour. Other wise it's a great pie!

This turned out really well, though I did make some of the changes suggested by other reviewers. I added a couple squirts of lemon concentrate, used a half cup of white sugar and a half cup of brown, and soy milk instead of regular milk. I also discovered halfway through that I didn't have nutmeg so I substituted a couple of crushed whole allspice and another dash of cinnamon.

I did not like how this turned out. With the 1/2c of butter, it had a greasy quality. We did not even finish this pie, and in our house that is unheard of!

awsome. TWEAKED a bit FOR the BETTER. Instead of regular milk I used evaporated can milk, and half of the sugar was brown sugar. I left out the cinnamon and nutmeg to allow the natural flavors of the yam to shine. I used "stephanie"'s Basic Flakey Pie Crust from allrecipes.com. Pure Bliss. Thanx COUGAAR !!!

this recipe was simple for a beginner. It turned out perfect and delicious!! I did sub in evaporated milk and added 1 tble spoon of all-purpose flour. Also used half dark brown sugar and half white sugar. It took the longest to boil the potatos and to bake the pies. I also beated the strings out. thanks for the recipe!

This was my first time making a sweet potato pie and I will be keeping this recipe. I grew up in south Alabama and this is a classic southern sweet potato pie.  I took it to Christmas lunch and everyone enjoyed it.

Wow! This is SO good!  I added 1 TBSP flour to prevent it from being too thin, as advised.  I've made this twice and it was loved and gobbled up by all.  The second time, I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar - wonderful either way.

This pie ended up AMAZING! It is my first time trying sweet potato pie and I loved it. My bf suggested I try making it because its his favorite. I used canned sweet potatos because its all I had on hand.  16oz or 2 cups of sweet potato in light syrup instead of fresh, and I used heaping spoons of the nutmeg and cinnamon. also margarine instead of butter because its all I had. I was kind of worried about it while it was in the mixer because it looked strange. I expected it to look more like pumpkin pie. I used pillsbury premade pie crust and a silicone crust protector.  I baked it at 350 degrees F for 48 minutes and it was perfect! I am submitting a picture as soon as I figure out how!  I will be making this again very soon because my huney loves sweet potatos and now I love this pie!!

Very good, nice and creamy. I did cut back the sugar by 1/4 cup (I tasted the mixture before adding the eggs) and it was plenty sweet but that probably depends on the sweetness of your potato and of course your personal tastes.

love this pie!  I used a suggestion from a previous rater, and used canned potato instead, to save me the hour on Christmas morning.. and I don't see where it effected the outcome one bit!  next time I'm trying homemade crust tho, since I can't seem to find a store-bought version I'm happy with yet.

Fantastic!    I made this for Christmas, and got rave reviews.  Like other suggestions, I used half brown sugar with half white (may use 3/4 brown next time!), added a touch of lemon juice, and used heavy cream for the milk, as I had it on hand.     I also microwaved the potato to cook to speed the process.  (Prick whole, unpeeled potato several times with a knife or fork.   Cook time will vary depending on the size of the potato - perhaps 5 minutes on high, then turn over and cook another 5 or so, until fairly soft.   Remove from microwave and wrap in dish towel and let sit for several minutes - the carryover from the oven will continue to cook the inside for a while.   Handle carefully  as you peel and mash!)     The amount of potato used was about 2 cups.    This really was very easy, and extremely tasty!    I highly recommend it to others.

Delicious! People told me that Sweet Potato Pie is better than pumpkin pie, but I didn't believe them until I tried this recipe. It was amazingly good. I modified the recipe like the reviews suggested, by using evaporated milk, lemon juice, and extra spices. I think this will become a new Christmas family tradition.

I adore this recipe!!  A friend and I made 4 pies to take to our sons' school.  One of the recipients of our pies wrote in to the school and asked to pass the message to us that that was the best pie he had ever had in his life!!  Wow!  Thank you for helping me bless others!

Outstanding flavor...the only problem was my crust was too soggy, and I think that was due to me letting my store bought crust come to room temperture before using it .  Other than the crust, the pie was delicious.

The pie tasted great! I used my food processor to process the boiled sweet potatoes, then added 1 tbsp of corn flour, 2 tsp of lemon juice, 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and beat till smooth like others. It has the perfectly smooth consistency and tasted great with hinge of lemon taste… Certainly a keeper !

Amazing!  I've eaten sweet potato pie my entire life and this recipe makes the most authentic southern sweet potato pie.  I didn't deviate from the recipe at all so it was a little too sweet for me but sweet potato pies are supposed to be sweet. I suggest you make the pie as is then decide if you want to cut down on the sugar. This is a keeper!

Our guests loved it, I used this recipe exactly. I didn't have a mixer or blender or anything, so I made sure to get it as smooth as possible when mixing with a spatula. I followed the ingredients and the amounts exactly.

I don't know why this was given such great reviews. I thought it was very bland. My husband topped it off with a cream cheese frosting and that pulled the whole thing together. He said next time he would add the cream cheese in the actual pie mix.

Was fantastic! We added some condensed milk to it and that made it even better!  It was a little runny, so instead of adding flour we just added more sweet potato!

I would add a half teaspoon of lemon extract, along with adding chopped sweet potato (hand stirred) after mixing all ingredients...To give it body...That's how I make my original sweet potato pie.

Really amazing.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and added flour to thicken the mixture, and half brown sugar, half white. (Next time I may reduce the sugar by half.  It is pretty sweet, and I really like the taste of sweet potato.)  Also, I can't find my cinnamon, so I just used nutmeg and ginger.  WARNING!  The mix is very runny, and fills a pie crust to the top.  Place pie in oven very carefully to avoid spilling.    Besides all of that, this is an incredible recipe, and can be adapted to suit your taste.  (Maybe next time I will add some pecans... MMmmm.)

I've never made sweet potato pie before. My friend loves sweet potato pie. He was experiencing some sadness so I thought I'd cheer him up with one. His initial reaction was not everyone can make that, it's hard. Well, this recipe is easy because he loved it and asked for it for his birthday and for Thanksgiving. So thanks for making me look good and we will see if a way to a man's heart is through sweet potato pie.

It came out great.  I too used 1/2 cup brown and white sugar instead of a full cup of white sugar.  I added two teaspoons lemon juice, one teaspoon flour, used half the amount of butter and used cream instead of milk.  Perfection.  Thank you.

Really easy to prepare; however, on the 1st try, this was too sweet for my taste buds and it didn't sit well (it was too loose and it didn't rise (as noted in the recipe). I lessen the sugar to 5/8 of a cup and 1/4 pt of light cream instead of milk; yummy, yummy, yummy!!!

This was quite tasty and very easy to make (and I'm a rookie! :-p), I will say though, in comparison to the sweet potato pies I ate as a child at Thanksgiving get-togethers, something just felt like it was missing. I can't put my finger on what it was, hmmm. I will defninitely take another reviewer's suggestion and add clove next time! =)

Love it.  It took 20 minutes longer than the directions say to cook, but that could be because I just moved to a new place with an oven I'm not used to (though the thermometer did read 350 the whole time).    I ran out of nutmeg so substituted ginger and was very happy with the results.  Try it when it's still a little warm--amazing.

4 stars for the original recipe, 5 stars with my modifications yet not 100% perfect - next time it will be perfect though.  First, I used 2 cups of sweet potatoes, I "mashed" them in the blender with the rest of the ingredients.  I added a teaspoon of lemon juice, 1 tbsp of flour, 1/4 tsp ginger and 1/4 tsp cloves.  I only used half a cup sugar (a mix of brown and white) but next time I'll use 2/3 cup.  Next time I'll also double all the spices.  Then I'm positive it will REALLY be perfect!!

Yummy!  I did have to leave it in for another 5-7 minutes for the toothpick to come out clean, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Much better taste than any store bought Sweet Potato Pie I've had. This recipe will be added to my Thanksgiving dinner traditions (though I am sure I will make it much more often than that).

Great tasting pie, however it wasn't as 'smooth' as my pumpkin pie, so next time I think I will try pureeing it instead of mixing with my hand mixer.  Yummy!

My family loves this recipe.  Even my father-in-law and he hates sweet potatoes.  My only change is baking the sweet potatoes instead of boiling. Never had any issues with the pie not setting up.

This is the first time I made a sweet potato pie, it came out great. The recipe is so easy to follow. I used canned sweet potatoes instead of fresh to save time.  I will make it again for the holidays. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was amazing! I made this for Thanksgiving this past year instead of my usual fresh-pumpkin pumpkin pie because I was unable to find a pie pumpkin as Thanksgiving drew near. This recipe was a million times easier than my pumpkin pie recipe and lended just as good or possibly better than results! Not a lot of work for great results.

I made this for Christmas dinner, in lieu of the traditional "candied yams". Evryone was pleasantly surprised. At first, my daughter's boyfriend would not even try it, saing he did not like sweet potatoes. After she badgered him a while, he finally gave in and tasted it. "Guess I do like sweet potatoes." :)  This is an awesome, easy and delicious recipe was so glad to make something different for Christmas dinner.  Thanks!!

My first pie ever.  It was awesome.  I was so nervous because my dinner guests were all sweet potato pie freaks and I knew they would be very vocal if it were not good!  Well, it was great.  I used condensed mild instead of regular milk and 1/2 brown + 1/2 white sugar and added in another 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.  Next time I will add in cloves and some vanilla for depth of flavor!  I also used canned sweet potatoes and it was pure unadulterated heaven in a pie!  Thanks so much for this recipe.  Its a keeper!

This pie was OK, but lacked the luster and flavor of a great Sweet Potato Pie.  I made it again, only this time I used the sweet potatoes that I baked in the oven - like a baked potato.  The flavor difference was huge.  So good!

I had never tried Sweet Potato Pie, or never had a taste for sweet potatoes for that matter (until recently). One day at work I mentioned making a Pumpkin Pie....Well, someone mentioned how they preferred Sweet Potato Pie over Pumpkin.  I figured why not, and made this recipe!  It was AMAZING! I took it to work and was asked for the recipe immediately!  A older southern Alabama woman with whom I work with even praised how good it was, and of course, gave me some tips with the ingredients, but nonetheless she loved it. The pie disappeared in less than 2 hours.  Thanks!!

This was my first time making Sweet Potato Pie for Thanksgiving and it turned out great!!  I doubled the recipe to make 2 pies and my family was fighting over the pies :-).  I just made 2 more last night to use my left over sweet potatoes from Thanksgiving and I'm still impressed!!  I did cook my pies a little longer than the recipe calls to make the pie set a little better and to have a nice golden color.

This pie tasted great, but I couldn't get over the stringyness of it.  It was way too thick too.  Reminded me of sweet potato casserole at Thanksgiving, which I love, but not as a pie.  I'll stick to my pumpkin pie recipe.

Having never eaten sweet potato pie and knowing my husband hates it, I wasn't sure what to expect... Especially when the sweet potatoes were all stringy when mixed with the other ingredients. But I pressed on! I used about 3/4 of a 29-oz can of sweet potatoes in place of fresh, and I followed the rest of the recipe exactly... Until my hand mixer died mid-recipe. Not wanting to dirty another bowl, I didn't use the stand mixer and instead used a whisk to make sure everything was well-blended. And this was awesome! I think I might like it as much as (or may more than) pumpkin pie. So good, but no one else would touch it (my daughter remembered the stringiness of the uncooked filling!). Oh, well, more for me. Thanks for sharing, Cougaar!

Followed recipe as is (just added 1 tb of flour to thicken).  It was good, but could have used something to make it special.  Next time I will line the rim with pecans and possibly make a graham cracker crust instead.  I will also try using a touch of lemon juice as some suggested - I totally forgot.

We are done with pumpkin pie. This recipe is the one I will use for every Thanksgiving from now on!!! It was splendid. I loved the texture and it had just a hint of sweetness and spice. Not too overwhelming like pumpkin tends to be. The only ingredient I changed was the milk. I used heavy cream instead, but I am certain it would have worked either way.

Very delish!!!  Even people who said they 'didn't like sweet potatoes'...ended up eating it and loving it! Not bad for never making it before.  Wish I could've taken a photo! I only did a few alterations...instead of milk, I used evaporated milk.  I also used 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar (which was homemade...I use dk. molasses with sugar...yummmm).  Thank you!! Such a good alternative to pumpkin pie!  God Bless!

This was great!  I used around 1.5 to 2 lbs of sweet potato pie and kept everything else the same.  It came out fantastic!  I'm glad I kept the sugar at 1 cup because it was just right.  I recommend using only 1/2 cup of sugar if you have 1 lb of sweet potato.

every once in a while, i come across a recipe that is so highly rated, i am shocked when i make it myself. there is WAY too much butter in this recipe. all we could taste was butter, butter oozing from the pie itself ... and i think the simple addition of nutmeg wasn't really enough flavor for the whole pie. very disappointing. this might be a good place to start from, but is in need of serious tinkering.

There is no canned pumpkin where I live. I'm from Texas but have lived in Scotland for 10 years. There is no Thanksgiving here either but there IS in my house. I love pumpkin pie but never have it anymore. This year I just wanted to be traditional so I searched until I found this recipe. It's fantastic. You've just gotta try it. I made the changes advised by a previous review. Condensed milk and half brown half white sugar. YUM YUM!!!  Better than pumpkin pie. No more homesickness for me.

Very Good!! I made for thanksgiving and my family loved it. I made a few changes to make healthier. I added fat free evaporated milk and used 1 egg and the rest egg whites and threw an extra egg white. Very good!! Will make again.

I had to make 2 pies this year, so I made one with a fresh sweet potato and the other with canned sweet potatoe and y'all....no difference! This is a very tasty and easy pie.  My hubby and son loved it because it was not overwhelming in the spices!

This worked for me, though I found the metric measurements weird--not because they were metric, but the quantities themselves: how do you come up with 454 g of potato? why 115g butter? I rounded everything up: 500g potato; 125 butter (half of a package of butter as sold in the UK, where I am). I also added grated ginger and garam masala rather than cinnamon. For pastry I used Julia Childs' recipe which is a classic. It all worked deliciously. I would give 5 stars for taste, but 4 for the odd measurements (not everyone has a scale in his/her kitchen!)

Made this pie for the first time, also ate it for the first itme. Excellent! I nuked the potato and scooped it out of the skin for more flavor. Used 1/2 cup light brown sugar, egg beaters instead of eggs, about 4 tablespoons butter, evaporated milk, and prebaked the crust for 5 minutes. Perfect!!  Did sprinkle cinnamon on top for looks. Thanks for sharing this recipe. Will make this again, very soon!!! :-)

This is almost the same exact recipe my mom gave me years ago.  Only instead of white sugar we use light brown sugar.  Definitely one of my favorites that we make EVERY year at Thanksgiving!!

Thank you for the great recipe!  I followed it exactly, except for using margarine rather than butter and it turned out wonderfully.  No changes are needed.  I would recommend preparing it a day in advance because the texture improves once it has been in the fridge for a night.  Thank you so much!

Mmmm, this was soo good. I did have to add an extra sweet potato because my crust was a 10 inch. I also sprinkled a little extra cinnamon too. My husband and I loved it, the kids wouldn't try it. Oh well, that's more for us!

I loved this recipe. It was my first time baking a sweet potato pie and it came out delicious. I wanted a recipe to use for thanksgiving and I found this one. I baked the pie before so i could see how it would turn out before I put it on the the table for Thanksgiving.  My kids loved it. I took some sugestions from other people. i added 3 table spoons of flour. I also used a teaspoon of almond extract, rose water. I did not have any nutmeg so I used some mixed spice. Thanks for the recipe, I will definetly be using this for Thanksgiving..

This came out WONDERFULLY! I ended up using the same recipe with worth of one pound of sweet potato and ended up with two delicious 9 inch pies. I took some of the suggestions of others and use 1/2 cup white sugar, with a 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar instead of just white sugar. I made add a bit more sugar next time. Adding 1tbsp of lemon juice, 1 tbsp of flour and used evaporated milk instead of regular milk.

I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone.

This pie had a great texture, and a pleasing blend of spices. Many sweet potato pies taste just like pumpkin pie, but this one was unique and quite good. My only complaint is that it's much too sweet; maybe our potatoes here don't need as much sugar. Next time I'll reduce the sugar by at least 1/2 cup.

This recepie was great!!! I have made it for my and my boyfriend twice in the past two weeks. (We sound greedy but really we are not!) I didn't measure the nutmeg, cinnamon, or vanilla extract I just added how much I thought I would like. Love this recepie and will definitely be making it again!

Ended up using 2 very big sweet potatoes so I think my filling was a little heavier than the original recipe... I used 1/2c. Splenda Brown Sugar blend and added 1 Tbl. flour. This came out great! Even my picky little girl loved it

I have been using this recipe for the past 4 years...and it has become my husband's favorite dessert. I always get great compliments when I make this pie. I don't change anything...it is perfect just the way that it is.

This one is a bit too sweet.  I peeled and diced the potato instead of boiling whole, saved on time.

Excellent. The best pie ever. Doubled recipe because of amount of pies needed. Added 2 spoonfuls of flour and 1/3 brown sugar for added flavor. Came out great. This recipe is highly recommended.

This pie was extremely good! I like that it's a homemade pie that's similar to pumpkin but way easier to make. I used half brown sugar as suggested. Pumpkin is still my favourite but i will probably make this again!!

Made this for the first time for a very important dinner.  Turned out WONDERFULLY! (And I'm a rubbish cook!) Did as others suggested: added some flour and cloves, and substituted 1/2 brown sugar. This is certainly going into regular rotation. Thanks!!!

This was my first time making sweet potato pie and it was very very good. I made it for a party and everyone that tried it loved IT and wanted seconds (I made two pies!). I followed the recipe exactly except I used 1/2 brown sugar as suggested. I also added a pinch of cloves and ginger and someone totally asked if I'd added those two items because they could taste them- very good! A must try.

This was my first sweet potato pie and it won't be my last. I reduced the amount of sugar called for and used 1/3 c  white and 1/3 c brown sugar, added a pinch of ginger and a pinch of cloves. Everything else was done exactly as asked for. My husband made his huge announcement that he does not like sweet potato pie but I'm pretty sure he has downed two pieces of the unwanted pie. It's a great and simple recipe.

*Definitely a recipe to try* It was so heavenly tasting, just perfect!! All my guest had seconds, even thirds! I altered the recipe a little, as suggested by other reviewers. I added, 2 tbs of lemon juice, 1 tbs of flour, instead of using all white sugar, I used 1/2 cup white and have 1/2 cup brown sugar and that was it! The other stuff were followed exactly.
I would recommend making your own crust instead of using a store baked ones. Theres definitely a big difference in taste.

This was just not a recipe that we liked overmuch. I made it with a few of the previous review revisions, and it looked and smelled good. My son thought it was good, but we thought it was just too sweet and the texture was not something we cared for.

My first sweet potato pie but and thakns to this recipe it was a HIT at Thanksgiving!  After reading the reviews, I used 2 small potatoes,which was perfect. I also added lemon juice and used 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar.  The pie baked up and settled nicely after it cooled.  Definitly a keeper - thanks for sharing!

Made this last night - my first made from scratch pie - ever!  I was pretty thrilled and couldn't wait to try it.  Followed everything to a T.  My kids (I have three) each had 2 pieces (small) and me and hubby both had a piece.  Smelled a lot like pumpkin while cooking, was very tasty.  A new favorite, will make again and again.

I topped the pie with cool whip.  Yumm!

Great recipe! This was my first time making Sweet Potato Pie and it was way better than I thought it would be. I changed some of the ingredients: 2/3 cup sugar ( 1/3c white and 1/3c brown ), 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and I had to use puff pastry as I didn't have any shortcrust pastry or homemade pie pastry handy and the mashed sweet potato came out to 1 1/2 cups when I measured it out. I baked the pie in the oven at 140 deg C ( forced fan oven ) for 40 mins. and the pie turned out great. I think I wouldn't use puff pastry again as I do like the normal pie crust way better and I think I would add a little more sweet potato ( as most recipes call for 2 cups ) and lastly I think I would cook it for a few mins longer just making sure I don't burn the pie crust. Cooking time may change slightly with the reg pie crust anyways. Definately a keeper recipe for sure. My daughter loved her piece and we took some over to the neighbours as well...... Enjoy!

Absolutely beautiful pie, the family loved it and they had never tried one before. Being Aussies Sweet Potato or Pumpkin Pies are not something that you come across. Very glad to have found such an excellent recipe for such a yummy addition to my baking list. Added extra cinnamon and a little flour as some suggested, also cut  the sugar to 2/3 using the brown and white sugars.
Thanks for the recipe, it's a definite hit.

If I could have given this recipe 10 stars I would have. This is an excellent recipe.I didn't have a pie cruse on hand so I made a homemade graham cracker crust from a recipe I found on this site too. The only thing that I did different was a suggestion from one of the other and use half cup brown sugar and half cup white sugar. I also added a little more cinnamon. Now, my mother in law makes the best sweet potato pie in my family and everyone can never wait until the holidays come around for her sweet potato pie, but this year I will make this one and see if it can compare to hers. This is a definite keeper.

It wasn't too sweet since I cut down the sugar but it was delicious. I made a couple and I had a friend take a whole pie home!

This was fantastic. I use to have a great sweet potato pie recipe, but lost it when I moved and I am glad that I did!!! This is my new favorite recipe. I made this with this site's Graham Cracker Crust I recipe and it was a perfect compliment. I won't be losing this recipe.

This is the absolute BEST sweet potato pie I have ever eaten in my life.  This recipe does make 2 pies which was even better.  This recipe is definitely going to be used often in my house.  In fact, I have made several pies since Thanksgiving.  It's just so easy!  Thanks so much!

This pie was really good.  Had a nice sweet taste...you can really taste the nutmeg and cinammon.  We used a graham craker pie crust.

I used this recipe, but baked the pie about 7 minutes longer and the filling wasn't runny at all..it was perfect. I also added a little extra nutmeg and cinnamon and it wasn't too sweet.

I made this for Thanksgiving. I thought it was very good, and exactly what I was looking for, plus had few ingredients and was pretty quick and easy. It did taste exactly like a pumpkin pie though, which left me wishing I had just made baked sweet potatoes - my favorite!

I am English but decided to cook a Thanksgiving dinner this year and baked a Pecan Pie and a Sweet Potato Pie for the very first time.

This is the recipe I used for the Sweet Potato Pie and it received 5 stars from everyone. 
(Though I did reduce the sugar content by one third!)

I will definitely bake it again.

Thanks

I had never made a sweet potato pie before and my husband requested one. We were going over to a party on Thanksgiving, at my work, where a southern gal was bringing the same pie. He was excited to try hers because he saud "she should know how to make a good one" Well she used canned yams and I made this recipe and he said "honey, you can make me sweet potato pie anytime!" This pie was beautiful. I guessed the weight by looking at the empty pumpkin can on the counter, and didnt use a mixer because I didnt have one handy where I had to make this. The pie filled the pan very nice and the texture was thick but not overly, very nice!! Will make again year round!

I first tried this recipe on Thanksgiving.Boy was this pie a winner! My brother-in-law's mother said this was the best Sweet Potato Pie she had ever eaten.I considered this a huge compliment, considering she was one of the best cooks I have ever had the pleasure to know. This is a recipe I now use several times throughout the year.Thank you Joyce for one of my family's favorites.

Wow - I didn't think I even liked sweet potato pie, but had to make this for a friend who request this type of pie. It was incredibly easy, and the best sweet potato pie I've ever tasted! Huge hit, received requests to bake 6 more as favors!

The first time I made a sweet potato pie, it was a disaster. A friend of mine found this recipe and shared it with me. I tried it for the first time on Thanksgiving and it was a hit. I made 8 pies with the recipe on Thursday and they were all gone by Sunday. This is the one I'll be using from now on.

I have never actually made a sweet potato pie by myself.  I would always help my mother but I never actually made it myself.  When my mother passed away last year, I decided I wanted to try to do it and this recipe reminded me of my time with her.  My son took on my roll and I took on hers.  The pies came out great.  This recipe is definetely a keeper.

This was my first sweet potato pie, and it was FANTASTIC.  I made a few changes-- I used slightly more of the spices than called for, used half & half instead of milk, used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white (instead of all white), put in a little extra vanilla and threw in a couple tablespoons of flour to thicken things up.  I made this for a work party and was told that I should sell these for a living.  Wonderful!  Thanks, Joyce!

Excellent! I used the Honeymade Graham cracker pie crusts. The recipe made enough filling for 2- nine inch pies, leaving enough room for the crust to peak out on the sides. I served it chilled with whipped cream on top (of course). I am not a fan of pumpkin pie, while the rest of my family is. This was a great compromise. Very good. Thanks for the recipe!

Um...this recipe was YUM!  
I work as an English teacher in South  Korea and I made this pie during Thanksgiving week for all of my Korean coworkers and students (since none of them have ever had anything like it before).  Needless to say they all loved the pie and all the kids were begging for more!  I promised them I'd make another one and bring it in on Thanksgiving Day since they gobbled up the first one!  :)  Great recipe...I will (of course) be making this again!

I selected many of the popular review suggestions.  I baked yams then put them in a food processor once cooled and peeled.  Skipped the nutmeg, used 1 t cinnamon, 1/2 t lemon juice, and used 1/2 c brown sugar with 1/4 c white to reduce sugar.  Skipped the crust by using 8x8 pyrex (I do the same for pumpkin pie).  This recipe is so flexible it just won't fail!

I'm a transplanted Yankee living in the south. All my southern friends say this is the best sweet potato pie they have ever had. I even substitute Splenda for the sugar for my diabetic friends. They all love it, and I like the complements I get.

This rating may not be fair. I had already peeled the sweet potatoes and decided to make this. Perhaps that is why the pie was a bugarish green. (Only a mom can use the word bugarish with true accuracy) . It did however, taste good. Not great, good. I'll try making it the way it's supposed to be done and review again.

Great pie.  My two pies required an extra 12 minutes until the knife came out clean.  Recipe was easy to follow and the pies were a hit.

I've tasted many sweet potato pies, and this one is great. I served it at a party and everyone loved it. I made a pie crust with crushed almonds to go with it and served it warm with vanilla ice cream.

FANTASTIC!  Don't change a thing.  I have been making this pie for about 3 years, and have always had lots of compliments.  My husband's coworkers are willing to pay for these, the neighbors love them, and everyone in the family has forgone pumpkin pie for this one.  The best part is how simple it is to make.  Thank you!!!!

I printed this recipe off in 2000.  Four years later, it is still my favorite pie recipe. Thanks Joyce! I get requests for it at every family function and for many special occasions.  I'm a busy mom, so I often just throw two large sweet potatoes in the microwave for 20 minutes and leave them alone.  After they cool, I just scoop out the insides and mix them right up with the butter.  If I want the pie to be extra yummy, I substitute half and half for the milk.

I made this for my father for this Thanksgiving. A friend from the south had made one for him years ago and he loved it. I wanted one that would be as good as he remembered and this was it. He loved it and so did everyone else.  Very easy recipe. Thanks!

This recipe was wonderful. This Thanksgiving was the first time that I ever tried to make a Sweet Potato Pie on my own, and everyone was so surprised to learn that I made it.  I'm not one for all types of embellishments and extras, and this simple recipe did the trick for me. This pie is a hit!

After years of trying to find a good sweet potato pie recipe, I finally found it!!  I stumbled onto this website Thanksgiving of 2000 and I was making a complete meal on my own for the first time.  I luckily found this site and tried this recipe.  It was delicious!  I've made it several times since then, but it is officially the pie of Thanksgiving for my household.  Very easy to follow directions.

Well Joyce, I did it with your help!  I made my first sweet potato pies for Thanksgiving and they were a hit!  My husband of 20 years said they were the best pies he'd ever eaten in his life!  I made a mistake of adding too much milk, but I guess it must have been the right amouunt after all... huh?  I already have special requests for Christmas!  Wow!!!  Thanks a bunch!

This was a great recipe.  I even made a few mistakes as far as timiming on cooking the sweet potato and the size of the potato, and still the recipe was great.  This was the best part of Thanksgiving dinner.  If instructions are followed perfectly, then this is a wonderful recipe.

I had never made a sweetpotato pie in my life. I made it on Thanksgiving and took it over my husbands Grandmother's house for after dinner. They all loved it, and it even made her mad that they compared it to hers! This recipe is TOTALLY AWSOME!

I made this and added some honey as one user recommended. I always make my own sweet potato pies and usually have to keep adding something to get that desired taste.  This was a wonderful recipe and I will definitely make it again.

Wow! This is delicious! I don't even like sweet potatoes, and I don't bake a lot... but this was easy and tasty. I made it for our Kwanzaa karamu (feast) and it was a big hit. Only one problem -- I woke the next morning, Jan. 2, vowing to eat healthy... but for breakfast I couldn't resist having one more slice of pie!!

This was my first time to make a sweet potato pie. I hosted my in-laws for Thanksgiving and promised my father-in-law I would make his favorite -- sweet potato pie. He said it was not only good, but the best sweet potato pie he ever had.

This was the first time I had ever made a sweet potato pie and was suprised to find that it was so easy. I took it home to my family for Thanksgiving.  I placed it on the kitchen counter, came back less than half an hour later and only crumbs were left!!  My family LOVED it so much I had to make another just so I could get a piece...now I can see why it disappeared!!  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!

Made this type pie for the first time, and since I'm from a deep rooted Southern family, I was hoping that it would come out perfect. Well, it did, except that it didn't set enough for me. It was a little loose, so cutting it was messy. Grandma says that the secret is to add just a bit of flour to thicken it. But, overall, great recipe!

This recipe for sweet potatoe pie, was very tasty (just the right amount of sweetness) and very easy to make!  I made this pie for Thanksgiving, which won good reviews from Granny.  I also made it before Thanskgiving and took it to work as my "tester pie".  1 person asked for the recipe, 2 people wanted me to bring in another pie at the end of the week, and 2 people who had never had sweet potatoe pie before love it now!  Thanks again.

An excellent sweet potatoe pie.  Truly from the "Old South".  I cooked the potatoes in the microwave which took only a few minutes.  Another time I added 1 teaspoon of lemon and 1/4 teaspoon of allspice which was excellent as well.

EASY as can be, and the best sweet potato pie I've ever had.  I've made it several times in the past few weeks alone.  Whenever I ask my hubby what he'd like me to make...this pie ALWAYS makes the top of the list.  Thanks for sharing!!

This is the best sweet potato pie I've ever tasted.  My husband said that it was better than his mom's!!  I cooked the potato in the microwave to reduce cooking time.  I also added a little lemon extract to the mixture.  I will definitely be making this pie again.

I'd never made this pie before but was asked to do so by some friends.  Not a fan of Sweet potato at all, I was reluctant to try. But came on and tried this one and came back with rave reviews - I've since made it 3 more times in as many months!!

I was in a hurry and didn’t read the reviews, only the first one.  I don’t like sweet things so I cut back on the sugar and maybe too much (I do that to everything I cook). It was good but not great. However my husband who hates  pumpkin pie loved it. I will make it again. Next time I will bake the sweet potato and use more sugar (the proper amount).

Made with purple sweet potato (ube).  My picky mother does not care for sweet potato pie but only tried it to humor me.  She ate 2 pieces and bragged about the pie on the phone to at least 2 people.   

I followed other ppl's suggestions about replacing 1/2 white sugar with brown, adding 2 Tbsp lemon juice, and adding a tad of flour.  My crust was a little weird so I need a better recipe for that.

1 large sweet potato, 1 canned drained... Mixed and mashed together and then used only 16oz of the mixture; used half cream half milk, half Light brown sugar half white,  whipped egg whites into soft peaks and folded them in at the end... baked slow and low in an UNbaked crust... didn’t fall.. hubby loved it.

First one I’ve ever made. It did start to split sorta while I was mixing... so I heated a 1/4 C of it and added it into the mixture until it all came back together...

Last sweet potato pie recipe I will ever need!!

This is the typical Southern style sweet potato pie recipe. A couple of notes though:  you absolutely must bake the sweet potatoes and my  Louisiana family members always add a quarter cup of orange juice. Beaten egg whites isn't necessary as it would change the texture of a true sweet potato pie.

This pie is fantastic! My family liked it better than my pumpkin pie. 
I made a couple of substitutions.  I used pumpkin pie spice instead of nutmeg and cinnamon.  I used monk fruit in place of sugar.  Next time I'm planning on substituting evaporated milk instead of milk.  I'll be making this pie for years to come.

Didn't care for how dense the pie was, and the flavor was a bit bland for my taste, might try again but will take notes in the comment and make some modifications and see if that helps

It was absolutely delicious! I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and was over the moon excited at how great it turned out! My mom hasn’t made these pies in years and this year I decided to try my hand at taking over for her. Let’s just say, the torch has been passed! I can’t wait to make them for Christmas. They are so easy too!!

I used canned sweet potatoes instead. Pie was very good not too sweet. Took a long time to cook like 1 hour and a half. Would make it again.

I've made this several times. Following the recipe exactly, it's good - maybe a touch too sweet. Baking the sweet potatoes is worth the time. Also, I've played with spices, extra cinnamon, pinch of clove and ginger. This year I used 1/2 c brown sugar and 3 Tbsp maple syrup in place of the white sugar. And used a graham cracker crust. It was a winner!

This was the first pie I’ve ever made. (Although I do like to cook.) I baked the sweet potatoes instead of boiling and I added a little ginger as well. 
This pie is super delicious. I think this will be my go to when I need to make a pie.

I made this but I used Almond Milk to cut down on the dairy for my lactose intolerant friend. I also augmented the spices a bit. We like more cinnamon and less nutmeg. It was delicious!

I made this pie right after Thanksgiving and I am glad I did. This pie was delicious. And it was easy to make. I will definitely make it again.  The only thing I did differently was that I used canned sweet potatoes. The potatoes was approximately 1 pound, just enough for the pie. The canned potatoes were already cooked, making it easier to prepare.

I wanted to make sure the pie would be light and fluffy similar to pumpkin pie so I creamed the butter with sugar, then added the 2 egg yolks and spices to cooked sweet potato.  I  beat the egg whites into meringue and added. I also used heavy whipping cream instead of milk and beat that too before adding to mix.  Also to reduce cooking time, I microwaved the sweet potatoes by cooking on high for 6 minutes, then turning and cooking on high another 6 minutes. I also threw in some maple syrup because I love that combination.  It was so very light and delicious

2 cups of sweet potatoes (HINT:  bring to room temp before creaming with the butter)
added a dash of ginger
1/2 cup cream
1 T flour

This recipe was really good and simple. I added a little ginger, used evaporated milk, and used a little fresh lemon juice to enhance the flavor. I made sure I used the red yams instead of the white.

This was really delicious. I don't know why people make pumpkin pie when sweet potato is so much better. I used evaporated milk, 1 tsp of Penzey's Pie Spice and 1/2 cup white and 1/2 brown sugar. I cooked my potatoes in the crock pot - just put them in whole with skins on for 3 hrs on high. They were perfect consistency (I used 2 medium sized potatoes). Severed with Haagen Daz vanilla ice cream. Perfection!

I’ve been a pastry chef for 10 years and this recipe by far blows everybody away super simple to make the only variation that I do is that I bake my sweet potatoes instead of boiling I wanted to retain the flavour which totally works

I felt that one cup of white sugar was a bit much so I did a half cup of brown sugar instead. I didn’t like the fact that I had to wait almost an hour for the potato to boil so next time I just going to cut it as you can see from the photo there are larger pieces in the pie. With the amount of butter it came out really fluffy looking so we will see what the first slice looks like when we cut pie. The filling did taste good so I’m excited to see what my husband thinks of it!

First time making sweet potato pie.. went through a few recipes til I settled on this one. I did make the modifications recommended by someone else of replacing the milk for evaporated milk, half white and brown sugar, added the nutmeg, ginger and lemon juice. I also added a heaping tablespoon of flour to the mix. It came out perfect! My husband said it was the best he’s ever tasted (and he grew up in the South)! Definitely keeping this in my arsenal of desserts!

This recipe is about as simple as it gets, but sometimes simple is the best way. I vaguely remember my mother would put whipping cream in her sweet potato pie, so I used half-and-half instead of milk, but I didn't make any other substitutions. Both times I have made it, I've ended up with about a cup of extra filling that I split into two ramekins that I bake for 35 minutes, while I bake the pie for 55 minutes. It's great warm and even better the next day topped with whipped cream after it's had a chance to chill. This is definitely a keeper!

I followed the recipe to the letter. Only thing I changed was: I baked my sweet potatoes because it gives a more intense flavor, I used dark brown sugar, I made my own crust. Excellent!

I used the recipe as a base. My version included the following: 2 lbs sweet potatoes, 1 stick softened butter, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and allspice, 1/8 tsp ground cloves, 1/2 cup evaporated milk, 2 eggs, 3 tbsp lemon juice, 1/2 cup each white and dark brown sugar, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. I microwaved the sweet potatoes then removed them from skin and put into my blender. I blended with the lemon juice until puréed. I added the softened butter then blended again. I mm

This pie was amazing! I followed the suggestions from the comment by “SL” on Nov 25, 2003 and it was perfect! The potatoes I used were very fibrous, so after mixing, I forced it all through a sieve to get a really nice and smooth texture. Instead of normal sweet potatoes, I used purple sweet potatoes from my mother-in-law’s garden. These have a more floral and earthy taste than traditional sweet potatoes, so it was definitely a different flavor from normal sweet potato pie, but still amazing. Definitely will make again!

Here we go!  Grew up on sweet potato pie from sweet old neighbor.  Every single SP Pie ive had since was bleh.  Never as sweet as the Southern Belle's pies (neighborhood nickname). I see this one that uses 1 lb of SP, and doubles most recipes sugar amount.  FINALLY!  I made this 2 days ago for the first time.  Just made 5 today. And I might make some to share with others.

the filling was too loose because it needed flour. Also it wasn't sweet enough.  Boiling them only takes the flavor out of the potatoes leaving it in the water. you can't actually sweeten them after they've been boiled. it's like seasoning your meat after it's been cooked. I  candid my sweet potatoes using the same ingredients. just add fresh nutmeg made a big difference. vanilla at the end so it doesn't cook out. this method maintained the perfect amount of sweetness without using too much sugar. brown sugar is better has a deeper richer flavor.  without any flour your pie is like pudding there has to be something to keep it's consistency or structure that's why it's called pie.

I didn't have a mixer, so the filling was chunkier than the traditional smooth, almost custard, texture. Also, I bake the sweet potato, rather than boil. In fact, it was because I had baked too many that I was looking for this basic recipe to whip them into a pie.

Have made sweet potato pie all my life and this is the best yet. 
Microwaved 3 medium-large potatoes instead of boiling and just scooped out the pulp.  Had no mixer so I whisked. Had a good bit left over so could have used a deep dish pie shell. 
 Cooked in a toaster oven.  It tasted great --- everyone loved it.

My Family thought at first It was a pumpkin pie. They were gladly surprised by how it tasted. I replaced the milk with coconut milk and coconut whipped cream because coconut I believe better complements the sweet potatoes flavour. But overall everybody enjoyed it.

This was a great recipe but my aunt suggested one change, use heavy whipping cream instead of milk to make it silkier. The texture is really good, but I think I may have liked it if it were a tad bit sweeter.

I really love sweet potato pie and this recipe was an excellent rendition.  

I gave four stars because I felt, for personal tastes, the recipe could be a little better.  It was overly sweet for my family but we generally like less sweet desserts.  Next time I will use 3/4 of a cup instead of the full cup.  I may also try another type of sugar instead of white.  The vanilla is an excellent addition.  We do not care for nutmeg and so I omitted the nutmeg and added ginger instead.  I added extra cinnamon as well to fit our tastes.  I used 2 sweet potatoes, which ended up being about 2 pounds total.  I used the measurements for all the other ingredients.  The pie was smooth, thick, and delicious.

Love this recipe. Although I do use half brown sugar and half white. Not sure exactly how it effects the taste but it’s just in my blood to add a little brown.

I did make a few changes because I brought a deep dish pie crust.  I used 1 1/2 sweet potato, and I used 1 1/2 white sugar.  It was delicious!!

I love this recipe! As my family have milk and soy allergies, I have to use substitutes like rice milk, and Earth Balance spread in the place of butter. Even with the substitutions, this was exquisite!

I made this recipe for the holidays and it was a hit! I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and it gave it just enough sweetness. Enjoy!

I will definitely make this pie again and hopefully I do not make a mistake like I did last time. I was doing two recipes at once and I used the crust recipe of another pie for this one. The crust was from "Marry Me Blueberry Pie" and I mistakingly thought that I saw the crust recipe called for milk instead of water. I was wondering why it wasn't bonding and looked closer to the recipe and shook my head. The person that was helping me cook, added the water and the crust bonded like it should.

My dad and I made it for Christmas. Was our first sweet potato pie, we always made pumpkin. We were amazed at how easy it was to make. The recipe is perfect. We loved it. The taste is so much better than pumpkin. We will be making this for New Years 2019.  I’ll add a picture next time.

Oven baked Sweet potatoes work best. Preferably baked in the following manner : do not preheat oven . Place potatoes directly unwrapped after putting with fork. Placed foil on rack below to catch drips. Turn on oven to 425° . Bake 45 minutes for two to 3 inches in diameter , one hour for up to 4 inches in diameter , and for super large potatoes bake one hour 15 minutes . After the time has elapsed do not remove from oven. Leave the potatoes in for 30 minutes to an hour . this makes the best tasting potato with the best consistency. You can boil them or used canned, and it will still be great , but baking them really gets the best results . I cooked exactly as directed using 2 cups the potatoes that I have mashed with an electric mixer to get rid of strings as advised elsewhere here. I get rave reviews from people who have been eating sweet potato pies all their lives. Until I found this recipe I had never made a sweet potato pie . From the first one everybody says it's the best they ever had. Thanks for this great recipe . It's perfect just as written

This is a very good start to a recipe, but I found it sort of incomplete.  Made it once, tweaked it, thought about it, and I think I'll hit it again some other time.  As other comments state, the filling is a bit runny, it doesn't really set up the way you'd like it to.  I'd suggest adding some flour to the batter, maybe half a cup, to thicken it and give it structure as it bakes.  I'm also planning to swap the milk for sweetened condensed milk.

Changes I made on my first go:  Added a squeeze of date syrup and some raisins (really compliments the flavor, trust me!).  Also added a couple tablespoons of powdered peanut butter (PBfit), both to thicken the mixture and because the flavor was a perfect match.  Added a layer of buttercream icing to the top of the pie instead of whipped cream.  Everyone raved about the pie and my modifications, so I think I've almost got this thing where I want it.

My First time making this pie and it was absolutely delicious.
I changed a few small things in the recipe .
I used Evaporated Milk instead of plain Milk and i also added extra cinnamon 1 tsp extra and 1 tsp of Ginger too . 
I also cut the sugar to 1/2 cup using 1/4 cup each of Brown Sugar and Plain Sugar .
All the family liked it and i will be making it again for Christmas day.
Thank you

Tested out making my first sweet potato pie before Thanksgiving and it was eaten by my family in one day!  I then made two for Thanksgiving and they were gone within a few days.  Now I'm making two more this evening...thank you for this recipe!!

I made this with a 40 oz can of Bruce’s Yams. It filled the pie shell beautifully! I used a pastry cutter and chopped the yams finely. I like that it adds tasty “morsels” of yams.

The only changes I made was I used imitation vanilla. The pure vanilla extract was too high. Other than that I used the exact recipe and it was scrumptious. Very simple to make especially by it being my first time baking a pie.

This turned out perfect for 2018 Thanksgiving dinner. My mom (a 74 year old lady) ate it for breakfast the next morning lol. I followed the recipe exactly. My oven baked the pie to perfection at 350° for 60 minutes. I’m making it a second time tonight. Thanks for this easy delicious recipe!

Wow!! This is an awesome recipe. I did make the substitutions with he sugar- 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. Also, I used the evaporated milk . I thought it might be a little thin, so I added just a TBSP of flour. This is a keeper!!

This pie recipe turned out wonderful and very tasty!  I made it exactly to the recipe, but used huge potatoes so that was great for the texture and noticed no looseness, as it firms up really good in the refrigerator!  And I even added other baking seasonings to really spice it up and take it over the top!  Thanks, for this recipe was a hit if  you want an authentic and delicious sweet potato pie!

I made a couple of minor changes and this ended up being the best sweet potato pies I've ever made.  I added a pinch of cardamom and a little bit (1/2 small lemon) of lemon juice.  Also, I separated the eggs and beat the egg whites until stiff and then blended them back in.  I had no problem with this setting up, as I see some people did.  My suggestion is to use the toothpick test to make sure the middle it done.  If not, bake a little longer.

I decided to try this recipe after tasting some store bought sweet potato pie at work. I have made this recipe twice already and the whole family is begging for more.

SOO DELICIOUS! Great consistency and the perfect amount of sweetness. I made my own crust which made it even better! My whole family loved it–my grandpa even thought it was pumpkin pie!  I will definitely be making this every year!

This pie was the hit of my Thanksgiving Dinner. I added pumpkin pie spice because I found that first in the spice cupboard and then some cinnamon and nutmeg. I also threw in a handful of chopped pecans. My only complaint about the recipe is I wish it stated how many cups of cooked sweet potato to use. I guessed. It worked.

I was looking for a good sweet potato pie recipe to make for the holiday season so I started searching.  I tried several and then I came to this one.  I made it and I would not let anybody try it until my friend tasted it - she love it and said that it was the best she had eaten.  The spices are balanced and it is not real sweet.  I will be making this again and again.

Made this pie - I was looking for an easy sweet potato pie recipe.   This one is simple,  easy and delicious! I have saved it and plan to continue using it from now on. (So easy,  even a novice baker like me can use it!)

**Update Thanksgiving 2019.  Made again for the family and they all decided  - this recipe is absolutely delicious! Served warm this time.

My sweet potato pie was delicious and came out perfectly. I'm wondering if I would have gotten the same results with condensed milk instead of sugar and regular milk.  Along with pumpkin pie, this is my second favorite!

I added more sugar-to my liking, nutmeg and cinnamon also to me liking. Instead of adding a cup of milk, I substituted with a can of condensed sweet milk. The recipe came out GREAT! It wasn't sweet, it had just the right amount of everything!

It was a great recipe. It was more than enough for a nine inch deep dish pie. I used the leftover filling for another recipe.

Delicious! The only change I made was I added 1 level tablespoon of flour as I whipped the filling. Several reviews said theirs came out juicy, the flour will prevent that.

I make this pie every year and everyone loves it. I do make little changes like I use evaporated milk instead of whole milk and I use 1/2 regular sugar 1/2 brown sugar and a little bit of lemon juice in the flavor is amazing this pie does not last long always the first one to go

A timely article in the KC Star comparing pumpkin and sweet potato pies in blind taste testing led to the making of this delectable treat.  Where have I been!  It was scrumptious.  I did add 1 T. flour, 1/2 t. ginger, 1/2 t. ground cloves and 1 t. lemon juice as suggested in other reviews. I also strained the final mix to eliminate the sweet potato "strings," as suggested.  This is going to be a part of my Thanksgiving table from now on!

I gave it 5 stars for taste and simplicity. I didn’t use nutmeg because I dislike nutmeg.  No other changes. My pie was a little loose as I suppose many are. Next time I will try 5 medium sweet potatoes instead of 4 to see if it will stiffen.

Loved this recipe. It's dangerous because my dad thinks he is entitled to at least half when I make it and its gone by 48 hours. I made some of the recommended changes. Carnation condensed milk. Half white half brown sugar. I also separate the egg whites and "stiffen" them before mixing them in. I use trader joes crust.

Great recipe! However, I tweaked it simply by using 3/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar and adding 1 tsp salt (which I found to be, perhaps, not enough).

This was my first time making sweet potato pie and I absolutely loved it. I did make a few following modifications, most inspired by reading reviews, and then also just to make it ever so slightly healthier.  I microwaved the sweet potato for 6 minutes instead of boiling to reduce cook time. Used Evaporated milk instead of milk. I reduced sweetener using 1/3 cup cane sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar. Added 1/4 tsp cloves + ginger, 1 tablespoon corn starch, 2 tablespoons lemon juice. I also decided to use the removed sweet potato skin to line the crust, just because it is healthy and I didn’t want to miss out on the nutritional value. I guess my thinking was that if it was like a layer of the crust, the consistency wouldn’t interfere with the creaminess of the filling. Because my 9inch pie crust pans were not very deep, this recipe turned out to make two pies which I was not expecting. I did weigh my sweet potato at the store and with the skin it was just over a pound by about 1/8. Not sure if that is typical for others but I did first try to fit it in one pie crust but there was way too much left over so went for two.

I replaced the sugar with brown sugar Splenda using the exact measurement for a sugar-free option for my diabetic dad. It came out really good.

This was perhaps the most amazing dessert I have ever made! I was unsure how many potatoes were equivalent to one pound, so I used three rather large ones, which I would suggest doing in the future. So delicious with a homemade pie crust and served with ice cream or whipped cream.

I have been making this recipe for the last 4 Thanksgivings and it's always a huge hit. Now people that come to Thanksgiving say they have been waiting for my Sweet Potato pie for months. And my Fiance begs me to make it for him by the time September rolls around. 
I do change it a bit. Like others here, I use half light brown sugar and half white sugar. Best advice! It's the perfect amount of sweetness. I also bake the sweet potatoes, not boil. And I double the sweet potatoes to 2 lbs along with adding more of the spices. This is a recipe I will keep and make forever.

This was my first attempt ever at baking any type of pie at home. I love sweet potato pie but the local stores "fresh baked" pies aren't always so fresh and use all canned or heavily processed ingredients. This was a treat for the family as we rarely eat sweets in the home. With our oven I had to bake closer to an hour. After allowing it too cool on a cooling rack, I popped the pie into the refrigerator for a few hours before serving. The filling came out perfectly and the pie lifted right out of the dish without difficulty. A dollop of whipped cream before serving and it was a big time hit. Definitely will be making this again.

This was my very first sweet potato pie and I loved it.  The recipe was very easy to follow and the pie turned out creamy and not overly sweet.  I will be taking slices of this pie over to my mom and in-laws tomorrow and they will be delighted.

This recipe turns out good! Even when using vanilla almond milk. Texture is firm yet soft, not too soupy...please cool pie for many hours as it tastes best after a full night cooling.

Made this recipe yesterday for a special soul food dinner. It was the star! Don't worry if it looks too runny before baking. It sets up really well. I did add a teaspoon of corn starch because I wasn't sure. Came out looking, smelling and tasting great.

I made sweet potato pie once before and it was just okay. I was asked by my sick aunt with cancer to make her one. I frantically searched for a recipe and tried this one.  It is now my go to and I'm always asked to make the sweet potato pie. Great taste and I didn't change a thing.  Once before all I had was unsweetened almond milk and it still came out good. Nobody knew the difference.

Tasted good but the appearance and texture was awful. Looking for something a little smoother like a pumpkin pie. Next time I make it I'm substituting my pumpkin for sweet potatoes and following that recipe.

Wow! I made four pies for Christmas dinner using this recipe and I am so glad that I did. The pies came out wonderfully! I normally don't use canned yams (just not my thing), but took a chance since I wasn't exactly looking forward to all the work involved with whole sweet potatoes.  I'm so glad I did! The only 'extra' thing I did was added 2 tablespoons of flour to the pie mix; I used two of the larger cans of  yams and it made 4 pies. Perfect recipe. I will definitely use again!

I cut the ginger in half and doubled the cinnamon.  I did not separate the eggs as I like my pie more dense.  I also added about 1/2 teaspoon frozen OJ concentrate.  I always prebake my pie shells and protected the edges with foil.  Finally, like my cheesecake I don't take the pies out of the oven at the end of their cooking time, but I turn the oven off, crack the door and let them cool slowly.  Don't get me wrong I loved the recipe but these are just some tweaks that made it perfect for my family.

Instead of boiling your potatoes try baking them. Still able to peel the skin off easily once you let them cool off and cut down on the amount of sugar needed due to natural sweetness of the potatoes.

I’ve been making this recipe since 2011 and tried various ways based on the reviews (all delicious) and still trying various ways to find the all time favorite. I panicked yesterday because I couldn’t find my printed copy with my hand written tweaks! I think someone may have thrown it out between Thanksgiving and now. Anyhow, after much searching online I found and reprinted it! One thing I do differently 90% of the time is that I use white sweet potatoes instead of the traditional orange because my family said they liked the softer flavor more. It also makes it similar to bean pie for those who like it. I also always use the Marie Callender’s deep dish pie crust which come with two in a pack and can be found in the frozen section. I’ve been halving the sugar between dark brown and white; evaporated milk; lemon juice; added ground ginger & ground cloves and flour as other reviewers suggested. I did try lemon extract before but that seemed a little too strong for some of my relatives. Everyone loves it no matter the variation and always ask me to make it for the holidays (Thanksgiving & Christmas). I’m excited to try some of the shortcuts like Bruce’s Yams (canned) and heavy whipping cream instead of milk and less sugar all light brown. Maybe next year I’ll try the rum extract too. Also, I’ll try the Splenda and/or dairy-free variations for some of my friends with allergies or diabetes. Thank you everyone for your awesome review tips for the great ideas and variations.

First time I made it. Added one spoon of flour and used less sugar but condensed milk instead. And brown sugar instead of white. Everyone wanted seconds even my son who doesnt really like sweet potatoes/yams.

We didn’t make any changes and it was delicious! We even used a gluten free pie crust for my mom and no one could tell. We will be adding this to our holiday lineup! Everyone liked it more than the pumpkin pie. I did make homemade whipped cream flavored with egg nog to go with it and I highly recommend trying it!

My husband's family makes sweet potato pie for every gathering.  When he started a job that prevented him from going home on Thanksgiving I looked for a recipe (because his family's is secret) that would give him a taste of home.  This one def did the trick.  I've made this recipe for years now and would change anything about it.

The last time I made 4 pies (there are only 5 people in our family) and ALL of them were gone within about 1 and a half days.

Highly recommended.

This is a good recipe, very tasty as well as not to sweet.  What I did change however was instead of using milk, I used half and half. I also added I tbs of orange extract along with 1 tbs of vanilla. I also made my own pie crust with butter.  Nothing beats making your own pie crust for its the foundation that makes or brakes any pie.  Overall, a pie that’s sooooo good.

Great recipe! This was my first sweet potato pie. I used the canned sweet potatoes due to time constraints and it was great.  Per the reviews, I used evaporated milk, halved the sugar amount, added lemon juice and a little flour.  It turned out perfect and I received lots of compliments.

I have been making this pie for the past two years now and it is amazing! Everyone loves it, and it is super easy to make. The only thing I did differently was I baked the potatoes instead of boiling, in order to insure that there was no added moisture in the potatoes. Otherwise, you cannot go wrong with this recipe. A+++!

I made this for Thanksgiving because my original recipe was lost a couple of years ago and I received great feedback. They enjoyed every last bite. Four pies completely vanished and satisfied customers (family members). Thank you so much for the recipe.

Great recipe I did make some good changes from others who gave input.  I used heavy cream instead of milk, used 1lb 10oz of raw sweet potato then baked them in foil, used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, whipped my egg whites, used a 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, and a pinch of salt. This pie was soooo good the texture was fantastic and had great flavor. Thanks to all the people who had their add touches to this great recipe.

I made this recipe but  changed it up a little bit. I used Carnation milk instead of regular milk and added lemon extract, also I used a little brown sugar as well. It came out great just like my grandmother used to make it.

I took some of the tips of the others here . Since I was making two pies, I used half brown sugar on one and all white on the other. I used the 2 TSP of lemon juice in both, and 1 Tablespoon of flour in each. I like the brown sugared version slightly better but loved both pies.

I made this recipe with sweet potatos from scratch and it was such a decadent pie. Lovely. While cooking the sweet potatoes, I added 2 Cinnamon sticks and a tablespoon of brown sugar, since the canned ones come with syrup. It was the best sweet potato pie I've ever had.

I just made this pie for Thanksgiving tomorrow and it turned out great! For dietary reasons i had to make a few subs and it still held up. I made it paleo-friendly by using cashew milk instead of cow milk, a plant-based shortening instead of butter, and coconut sugar. It was still a little on the thin side with just 1-on of potatoes (and probably all on me because of the changes i made) so i added an extra potato to make it about 1 1/3 lb total. I almost took the advice of previous reviewers and added 2 tbsp lemon juice and i baked the potatoes in the oven instead of boiling them. No complaints from me!

I read 50 reviews and chose many of the suggestions. I used 2 pounds of sweet potatoes and baked them instead of boiled. Used condensed milk, added lemon juice and spices & flour and pre-baked the crusts. Excited to see how these are liked tomorrow on Thanksgiving! Thank you for the recipe and all the suggestions

Very simple recipe that produces a lovely pie. I only gave four stars because 1 cup of sugar is just too much for us. I cut down to 3/4 cup and found that was still quite sweet. Will make this again.

This pie wasn’t amazing.  I made 2 pies and they only lasted one day! Needless to say, this isn’t what I have been designated to bring to Thanksgiving dinner.  The only changes I made were replacing 1/2 cup of brown sugar with 1/2 cup of the granulated sugar and I also used evaporated milk instead of the milk.  I may use a little  more nutmeg next time.

I've only had sweet potato pie once and it was made by a friend's Grandmother who made "the best sweet potato pie you'll ever eat", and it was heavenly. That was 29 years ago, (I didn't want to spoil the memory of that experiance).
Anyway, i decided it was time to try and it again. Making this pie I was apprehensive given the amount of sugar called for but, since I had no other experiance making sweet potato pie, I stuck with the recipe as written and it turned out to be absolutely delicious.  I'd say I beat Grandma's pie except my crust wasn't nearly as good as hers.

I am 53 years old and I have never liked sweet potatoes!  I couldn't believe it when my husband asked me to make him a pie....  WHAT!  OMG! NO!  Well i did it and I always taste what I make I was very reluctant of course but I tried it and OMG  I liked it.  I gave my Mom and Dad the second pie knowing I wouldn't like it and they absolutely loved it too.  Thanks for creating a sweet potato pie i can eat

One thing I wish I'd known: it may take 10-20 minutes longer to cook this pie properly! I started panicking when the center wasn't anywhere near done at 55-60 minutes, but I remembered that the same thing happened with my pecan pie at first and that's why a lot of people have runny centers. I took the advice of another and cooked it until the center had a little jiggle but wasn't loose. Turned out great! I also used 1.2 pounds of CANNED sweet potatoes.

This was my first time baking a pie and this recipe made it easy and fun to bake. I followed some of the advice of others that reviewed. I too added the ginger, and half a cup of white sugar and half of brown sugar. I also used coconut milk instead of regular milk.. the flavor is amazing!! I also made my own crust (from all recipes too!!) I timed it at 50 min, then left it another 10 which made it the right consistency for my liking. I also added 1/4 of flour to the mixture to thinken it some. I can't wait to make it again.

This recipe was amazing. I followed some of the suggestions by other reviewers including using half regular sugar and half brown - I used the Splenda brown sugar blend, so it was 1/4 less sugar. I substituted the milk for Pumpkin Spice almond milk and the butter with vegan butter, since I can't eat dairy. I added 2 tsp corn starch because I could tell it was going to be too thin. I whipped the egg whites until it was a fluffy goo in my blender with a whipping blade, hand mixed the other ingredients in a bowl, and then poured the sweet potato mixture into the blender and gave it a whirl to mix it all. Mine had to bake for 65 minutes, but then it was the perfect consistency. I used a double layered pie shield (first foil wrapped around the crust, then a hard pie shield) which allowed the crust to be a perfect brown. I used a store bought frozen gluten free pie crust.

Didn’t change anything, it was perfect! Sweet potato pie isn’t really a thing here in the UK, so this was the first time any of us had ever tried it. I’ll defimifely be saving this recipe and making it again!

This is my first sweet potato pie to make or taste.  I had a little left over that wouldn't fit in the pie pan. So I put it in a little pyrex dish and baked it with the pie. It  was so good and flavorful. This was a customer request at the restaurant and was a big hit. The only change I made was to use heavy whipping cream instead of milk because the cream was at the use by date and I don't waste anything if I can help it. I will be adding this to my keeper pies!

Not the greatest I’ve ever had but pretty darn good. I did sub half the sugar with dark brown sugar. I didn’t find it to be too sweet at all. Creamy texture and a little savory which is a nice change of pace for dessert. The sweet potato flavor really shines thanks to the light handed seasoning. Used the “basic pie crust” recipe in AllRecipe and worked well. I did have to bake it a total of 65 minutes before the knife was decently clean so trust the knife and bake accordingly!

made this recipe a couple of days ago for Canadian Thanksgiving, worked great! I did change a couple of things for taste though, used a cup of Brown sugar instead of white and added a 1/4c of sweetened condensed milk as I had some left over from the pumpkin pie I had made just before.

It's been years since I've had a good sweet potato pie. This year I was determined to find one that would even compare to Grandma's. I was so happy with this recipe. Not only was it delicious it brought back many memories. I followed the advice of other reviewers and did 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar. I also used evaporated milk, added 2 tbs of flour and a squeeze of lemon. I am so pleased with this. I can't wait to share it this year for thanksgiving and Christmas!

If I'm being totally honest.... I think I over baked the pie. I should have trusted my instincts and took it out when I thought it was ready.

love this recipe. I divided my students into 12 teams and each team made their own pie. no mixer was involved because we did not have any so the kids put their hands in it and mixed it by hand just like grandma use to do well guess what?!!! they came out delicious the kids love it they kept asking for seconds and thirds they really enjoyed it. the only problem with not using a mixer, is that the butter does not incorporate in the mixture. so when we cooked them some butter melted to the top. because of time crunch we had to store in refrigerator and eat them 2 days later. The butter was solid on the top of some of them but it still did not take away from the wonderful flavor. they were really good. One African american grandma was very pleased with the taste and the way we made it. I could have not asked for a better critic

This tasted great! I don't like pie crust so I added 1/2 cup Bisquick to the filling. This gives it enough firmness that it doesn't need a crust. It turned out beautifully. I'll make this again and again.

I used this recipe to make sweet potato pie for the first time! My family was impressed of how good it tasted! The ingredients were perfect! Not to sweet not to bland just as perfect as can be! Just follow the ingredients! The only thing I substituted was milk for evaporate milk because some of my kids don't do well with regular milk! But overall it was the best! I will definitely be making this for Christmas!

Very tasty. Has a really nice consistency and is easy to make. Simple spicing preserves the flavor of the sweet potatoes and is not over bearing

Delicious.  Not sure why sweet potato pies have so much butter in the mix.  It was a Thanksgiving day hit.  I like the squash flavor that comes through.  Nice orange color compared to pumpkin.  Definitely worth your effort.

This came out pretty good. The one thing I would change is to bake the crust a bit before adding the pie filling.

Everyone really liked it. I made two for Thanksgiving party and it was a big hit.  I followed the recipe exactly but baked it about 20 minutes longer.  I live at a high altitude so maybe that has something to do with baking time.

I tried it for the first time with a few modifications. I used a fresh yam peeled, wrapped in aluminum foil  and baked at 400° for 40 minutes. I then placed it in a container and added 1/2 a cup of sugar with 2-3 teaspoons of Vanilla extract and the same of cinnamon.  All other measurements and instructions were  followed as indicated. I used a hand mixer on medium speed as I  added all of the ingredients. We felt it was still too sweet so next time I will use 1/3 cup of sugar with the same measurements of all other ingredients. YUMMERS!!!!

The taste is on point! But what I don't see is several persons that share the recipes share that you have to de-string your sweet potatoes. 

Use a hand mixer to whip the strings out and wash the beaters off ! Do this at least 6 times! What I do is I whip it up and as I'm pulling the beaters out of the mix, I turn it off and then rinse off the beaters!!

No one likes stringy Sweet Potato Pie!!!

The pie came out great, made a few changes.  I added allspice and a 1cup of brown sugar because I had a few more potatoes. It gave me 2 deep dish pies.  It also took longer to bake when you use a cookie sheet under it.

I've never made my dad a sweet potato pie because he's very picky about them being homemade. I made the pie with these exact instructions and it came out perfect!! I will make it every year from now on. Dad gets his very own!!

Very good!  I baked the sweet potatoes and weighed 16 oz.  on a kitchen scale, after peeling.  I put all ingredients in a food processor and mixed it on the "dough" setting.
 I used canned coconut milk which is pure coconut milk (the kind that comes in a carton such as Silk brand would not give the same result). I was dairy-free for many years and discovered my family preferred the coconut milk pies.
Also, I reduced the sugar. The recipe amount seemed too much for our taste (sweet potatoes are sweet), so I reduced the sugar by half. The pie is sweet enough. 
I put it in a whole wheat crust.
All ingredients were organic.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was an absolute HIT! I was soo nervous as this was my very first attempt to make a sweet potato pie. I haven't had one in over 20 years ( since grandma died). I did tweek the sugar ( half white & half brown ), evap.milk instead of regular and added a tbsp of flour as suggested. It was very easy and totally delicious. Pass the cool whip and Enjoy!!!

Delish!  I used organic purple sweet potatoes. Since I was nearly out of sugar, I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 c brown sugar and 1/4 cup dark brown corn syrup. Turned out fine. Very beautiful color and texture.

Had to search hard for it---there's zillions! But this one's special. I printed this one out on Nov 17th, 2000! Jared wasn't even a year old! The paper is worn, torn in a couple places around the edges, and smells of holidays past--and is well loved! ;) It's a recipe from the Deep South, in Georgia, and it really is the best ever sweet potato pie recipe.

Trust me--no need to search any further for the most amazing Sweet Potato Pie recipe! Had to search hard for this recipe for a friend today---there's zillions! But this one's special. I printed this one out on Nov 17th, 2000!  The paper is worn, torn in a couple places around the edges, and smells of holidays past--and is well loved!  ;) There's a mutiny in my family if I don't bake 2 of these pies for Thanksgiving, and then again for Christmas.  It's a recipe from the Deep South, in Georgia, and it really is the best ever sweet potato pie recipe.

I made this.... I used 6 mixed sized potatoes (4 sm 2 med) which yielded 2 full pies. I followed the recipe to the T....However I feel like it's missing something. I will make 2 more batches tomorrow (thanksgiving) and follow the tweaks I've read from other reviewers ie: 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white, lemon juice, ginger, cloves, evaporated milk and flour. Im hoping for a more richer flavor.  Happy Holidays everyone.

This pie is my new holiday favorite. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used half brown and half granulated sugar. I used two large sweet potatoes, which allowed me to double the recipe for two perfect pies. I will definitely make this recipe again in the future.

The canned sweet potatoes might have ruined this.  My butter was soft and fresh as well as all the other ingredients, except the canned sweet potatoes.  When I mixed everything together it should have been a nice homogenized mixture.  The butter and potatoes seemed to separate.  Before I call out let's see what it's like finished.

I've used this as a base recipe a few times. I substitute Blue Hubbard for the sweet potatoes or a do a mix of the 2. I prefer to bake them instead of steam, it gives them a deeper/caramel flavor. I also use 1/2-3/4 the sugar in this recipe, you really don't need the whole cup. Just too sweet! I prefer use 2x the cinnamon and a little extra nutmeg then the recipe calls for. Delish!

Used Butter Flaky Pie Crust for T-Day 2016 and braided the edge. So good. First Sweet Potato Pie I've ever had. Think I'll make it from now on.

It was delicious although I used pumpkin and Hubbard squash instead of sweet potato. I think you can mix and match and still have a delicious pie.

Good pie.  I used 2 C mashed sweet potato, cut the sugar in half and subbed brown.  Added 1/2 tsp ginger to the other spices and used 1 full C evap milk.  After mixing, I thought the filling was too fibrous, so hit it with my immersion blender to smooth it out.  Only took 50 min to bake.  Wonderful!

I love this recipe. I did make some changes that were suggested. I used 1/2 sugar, 1/2 brown sugar,  added two tbsp of lemon juice, and 2 tbsp of flour. The lemon juice gave my pie a really good aftertaste. I can't wait to make this again for my family.

This is a great recipe! This was my first time to bake a sweet potato pie. I think I would change the 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg to 1/4 teaspoon. I love nutmeg, but it was strong in this pie (I'm not big on a lot of spices). I will definitely make this recipe again!

Changes:
- I used 6 small organic sweet potatoes, basically equals to 2 potatoes.
- I used 1/2 cup of cane sugar since other reviews pointed out the sweetness when 1 cup of sugar was used.
- I used parmalat milk from a friend since we don't keep milk in the house.

All in all the pie was just fine. Easy to make and very close to my mothers

This is the best sweet potato pie I've ever made and tasted; it reminds me when I was a little girl growing up in Texas and my momma would be baking her sweet potato pies for Thanksgiving and Christmas...And this recipe is similar to hers except she added carnation milk.. Thank you for the memories and this recipe

I would have  to say probably  one of the best ones I've ever made with this recipe.  Only thing I did differently was instead of using milk, I used evaporated  milk  and I added cloves, and all spice. They turned out awedome.

I made this recipe a couple days ago after recently getting a craving for sweet potato pie. I've eaten it at restaurants a couple times but have never actually made it myself. After being issued a challenge by a co-worker who is from the south (who also prefers sweet potato to pumpkin), I decided on this recipe. I was skeptical at first because it didn't look anything like the ones I saw in the pictures. However, the next day I took it into work and had my co-worker try a small slice (in case it wasn't any good). After just one bite though, she proclaimed it to be as good as her mother's. I tried it myself and immediately fell in love with the flavor and texture. After sharing it with a few others at work (who agreed that it was amazing), I gave the rest of the pie to my co-worker for her to share with her family. this will now be my 'go to' pie for potlucks and dinner get-togethers.

I should mention that I did not alter the ingredients at all and followed the recipe exactly.

Super easy to make.   I peeled and diced the sweet potato into 1 inch cubes and then boiled until fork tender (15-20 min).  We had never had a sweet potato pie, so I knew the kids would be skeptical.  They didn't see me peel and dice, so once it came out of the water i told them it was pumpkin.  Got it baked and served with cool whip.  Kids ate it like there was no tomorrow.  After they almost licked the plate clean, I told them it was actually sweet potato.  They were surprised and have been eating since.  Thanks.

Classic recipe that I was taught as child.  I was never taught to measure, but to taste.  So I can't swear by the measurements, but the ingredients are there except I  use condensed milk.  My recipe's aren't written so I look for ones that are as close as I know to pass on to my grand children in case they ever need to do it.

I'm doing this recipe as we speak. Just put two sweet potato pies in oven. I had two deep dish pie shells and I followed this recipe. I don't know what I did wrong but I got two deep dish pies. Just put them in oven. I did add a tablespoon of flour. That's the only thing I changed. Can't wait til they're done. I still have enough sweet potatoes for about,     8 pies. Does anyone know if they freeze well?

THIS IS AMAZING! I followed the recipe exactly. I was making them for a church supper and I didn't want to buy 5 pie shells so I looked up a pastry recipe & made my own crust 
:-O  I made 3 batches of dough and rolled them out and cut them with a biscuit cutter into the size of muffin cups then filled them with the filling. 1 batch of pie filling made about 40 mini pies. Will be my go to recipe as the fall season goes on!

I made enough for a crowd of about 40 and it was a success with all. I read through the previous reviews and going by the one that wrote about using canned sweet potatoes (which I also used) I put a little flour into the mix to compensate for the extra moisture.  I did take a bit to beat out the lumps of potato. I never did get it completely smooth. I beat until the lumps were only the sized of maybe rock salt and they baked out and became smooth. I will be keeping and making this recipe again.

I made this as an alternative to pumpkin pie for Canadian Thanksgiving. It is delicious! I will make it over and over again throughout the winter, as I can alway by sweet potatoes in the produce section, whereas I don't like to compromise and use canned pumpkin after they are out of season ;)

The pie looked pretty and the consistency was right but it was way too sweet. I would put about half the sugar.

I found this recipe too sweet, although I reduced the amount of sugar called for. However,  I shared it with a friend and she loved it, so I guess it's a matter of preference. Will definitely make again, with even less sugar.

Fabulous!
I didn't change a thing. Personally, I didn't think the substitutions was needed (evaporated milk, lemon, flour, or brown sugar). Straight to my recipe box, perfect as is.

To make it easier and faster I did microwave the potato! Someone else suggested beating the egg whites till stiff, which I did. It made the pie so fluffy and delicious! I will make this often!

I have been making this recipe for about a year now and omg I just can explain how delicious it is. The sweet potato filling is so creamy and it's not so sweet which doesn't make me feel guilty after eating it. I recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a good sweet potato pie.

I've made this a few times and it's turned out great. I used almond milk instead of regular because that's what I keep on hand and it was still creamy and delicious. I do prefer the 1/2 brown sugar and lemon juice suggestions that other reviewers mentioned, but even as is it's a wonderfully simple dessert.

Wow. Simply the best sweet potato pie I have ever made/consumed! I made some minor changes: I used a little more than a pound of sweet potato, I baked them @ 400 for about 30 minutes, cut sugar in 1/2. The worst part about this recipe was the lack of warning! We burned our mouths with each pie because we couldn't wait to eat it! If you let it set - it will be perfect! Do yourself a favor and make this pie. So so good.

I made this last Thanksgiving and it was amazing!!! I made my own crust with crushed graham crackers. I also used almond milk instead of regular milk and egg whites instead of eggs. The pie was so full of flavor! Better than any pumpkin pie I've tried!

I love Sweet Potato Pie and with this being my first time making it I must say it came out perfectly... this was a very easy recipe to follow. I ended up making two because my son just could not get enough of it... the only thing I did was  I added an extra half of Sweet Potato to each pie  to really have that taste of the sweet potato. But thank you for the recipe

So, I have made this pie twice...the first time I followed the directions exactly and the second time I cut the sugar in half and  I totally forgot to add the butter!! I was really scared that it was not going to taste good but it was just fine.....but then again we don't like our pies super sweet and the sweet potatoes themselves tend to be pretty sweet already :) So, for those of you who like to cut the fat and sugar and don't mind something a little less sweet, you should try it :)

Excellent!!!!! It all started with a crazy craving & my love for sweet potatoes. My first time ever making a sweet potato pie & it came out perfect. I bought it in to the office & it was devoured! I work with Chinese people who love sweets but hate anything too sweet therefore I cut the sugar in half & it was still sweet enough to not taste bland. I did have to bake mines for about 1 hour & a half. I topped it off with whipped cream and it was delicious. Did I mentioned how easy it was to make! Five stars!

As good as it gets, but whipping the egg whites helped a lot, and there are approximately 3 medium potatoes, or 2 cups of mashed potatoes in a pound.

I have made this pie for my mother for several years now. always skewering it slightly because she is overly sensitive to excessive spices. 
For all the critics out there, this past Christmas I made this pie according to the recipe with no alterations! It finally got the rave reviews it deserves. don't alert it! if you need to bake it a few minutes longer... but make the recipe with the ingredients it calls for...  You will love it!

I've made it twice.  Was amazing. I blended sweet potatoes and all ingredients in a blender to make it more liquid for smoothness.   Because if that,  I would say have to cook it 5-8 min longer to get proper consistency. Used almond milk instead of regular milk second time and was even better!

This was my first sweet potato pies I ever made! Huge hit! I did add a Tbsp of flour and like a capful of lemon juice just as enhancement and thickening. Also, I used a food processor to mix my pies! No strings or lumps or anything. Because the mixture was runnier that way, I ended up baking them for 1 hour and 15 minutes. My granny, queen of sweet potato pies, even liked it. A LOT!

Love this recipe!  Great as it is, but to make it like my mother in law's, I used half brown sugar and half white, and used a half tsp vanilla and 1 tsp butter nut flavoring, no spices. Wow,  changed the taste, but delicious as well.  I've made it several times, and my husband keeps asking for it!

While this tastes very similar to pumpkin pie, the taste is much smoother and I enjoy it more, perhaps due to the fresh ingredients.  A definite keeper.

There was a sale on sweet potatoes locally at 10 cents/lb.

Instead of boiling the sweet potatoes, I baked them a few days ahead of time. Wrapped them up in foil, put them in the oven for an hour at 400 and then stuck them all in the fridge when they came out. And instead of regular milk, I substituted condensed milk. The rest of the recipe I followed as specified.

The filling barely fits into a regular frozen pie shell from the grocery store. You might want to use a deep dish pie shell. But it did fit. Barely.

The sweetness and the spices were spot on for me, it tasted like your standard issue sweet potato pie. I grew up in the South, so I know what they taste like there.

I've got another 2 lbs of baked sweet potatoes to use up, that's two more pies :)

I love the flavour of the pie it's amazing I made my own pastry but didn't blind bake it before hand so that ruined it a tiny bit. The top of the pie seem to crystalise a little bit any suggestions as to why ? I also made the mistake of making the mixture n putting it in the fridge seemed to seperate a bit

Delish! Baked and cooled sweet potatoes, instead of boiling, for better flavor. Do NOT use canned yams. Was not the slightest bit runny when made as directed. I baked it 50 minutes in my oven. Husband having second slice. Will keep this recipe !

Tasted pretty good but my family agrees that something is "off" with the consistency.  We're used to a creamier pie. I will try one whose recipe calls for condensed milk and see how that turns out.

I used evaporated milk instead of milk,  light brown sugar instead of white sugar, and apple pie spice instead of just the cinnamon and nutmeg. I used a bit more sweet potatoe, probably twice as much. I used a deep dish pie crust. I love this pie! I've never made a sweet potatoe pie. I usually make pumpkin pie for the holidays.This is delicious. I baked my sweet potatoes instead of boiling.

I may have overestimated the weight of the potatoes. I used 4 medium so I could make two pies. I weighed the potatoes in the store, and what I used should have been a little over 2 lbs. I doubled the ingredients but the mixture seemed very thin and WAAAY too sweet (and I didn't even add all the sugar at this point!). I ended up adding a little more potato and a pinch more nutmeg, and the consistency was perfect, but it ended up being too much nutmeg and still way too sweet for my taste. I will try this again and adjust rating. I still can't imagine using as much sugar as the recipe calls for.

I've made this recipe four times and made exactly NO changes. My wife, who is not a squash fan, reluctantly ate a small piece. It's now one of her favorite pies. I use a crust made with 1.5 cups of flour, one-half cup of canola oil, one-fourth cup water, and one-half teaspoon salt, mixed lightly and rolled out between two sheets of waxed paper. If you haven't tried this crust, just do it! You'll be amazed.

This is my second time using this recipe--it just has great flavor! This time I substituted maple syrup for the sugar (3/4c pure maple syrup instead of 1c white sugar). To compensate for the  altered wet/dry ingredient ratio, I reduced the milk by 1/2 and added an egg. The result was stellar--the pies (I made two) raised well, have great consistency and are just delicious!

I made this pie for the 1st time.  I was taken back to my childhood when grandma made sweet potato pie.  YES!  I did change the sugar to 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c of  DARK brown sugar.  Also, I used buttered flavored Crisco and 1/2 teaspoon of all spice .

I made this for the first time for Christmas dinner and definitely will make it again. It tastes even better the next day! I did tweak the recipe a little, though. As other reviewers stated, I doubled the amount of sweet potato and  microwaved them to save time. Also, 1 cup of sugar seemed as if it might be too sweet. So instead, I used 1/3 cup raw coconut sugar and 1/3 cup pure maple syrup. It gave the perfect balance of sweetness.

This pie was a hit and super easy to make! I went half a cup brown sugar and half cane and separated the egg whites and yolks and folded in the whites. This pie won me over, I am the most recent convert from being a pumpkin purist!

I made this recipe and it made my fiance's eyes light up! It was amazing! My mother tasted a slice and came back for half of 1 of the pies, literally. 
I did use half brown sugar, half white sugar. I also added 1 tablespoon of flour. Perfect!

I have made sweet potato pies for years using a similar recipe but have never measured ingredients.  I have also added some brown sugar and used sweet condensed milk and deep dish pie crusts.  I have requests from around the country for my pies.

My SO grew up eating sweet potato pie and has said it was always just "meh".  But last year we had a sweet potato pie at Girl and the Goat in Chicago and it was SO GOOD.  This year we decided to re-create it for our family events.  We experimented with this recipe today in preparation for making it for Christmas.  We taste-tested 5 different variations of the filling and here's what substitution we thought tasted best:
1/2 c. brown sugar and 2/3 c. maple syrup (instead of 1 c. sugar)
Ginger snap cookies (crushed), pecans (crushed) and butter (instead of store-bought crust)
Added cloves
Added lemon juice
Substituted equal amounts of evaporated milk for the milk

I wanted to just do Cool Whip on top to make life easy.  We tried homemade whipped cream (adding Allspice and a bit of sugar) vs. Cool Whip in our taste tests today.  Wow.  The homemade whipped cream was so much better hands down.  And it really isn't that hard.  Adds an extra 5-10 minutes.  So we will be doing that as well.

I will update this review once the parties are over with the final verdict on the pie!

In the meantime, SO pretty much licked the bowls clean saying "Wow, this is so good!  I give it a 9 out of 10!"  I would consider that a winner.

This turned out great. It was the first time I have made pie. Figured I'd give it a try since I've made massed sweet potatoes before and the plan worked out.

At first I halved the sugar, but then I was afraid it would not be sweet enough, so I added about 1/3c maple chunks.  And it was good.  I imagine the original recipe is good.  
I substituted some frozen defrosted pumpkin as I didn't have enough sweet potato, and that was good too.

I made this for my 12 y/o son who is a pie enthusiast. He Was suprised there was such thing of sweet potato pie.Made as directed with exception of I used pumpkin pie seasoning only because I was out of cinnamon. Flavor was great. A bit watery; cooked about an hour, maybe tad more.  I will probably bake & not boil potato (i used one large) next time amd I am sure that will be rid of extra watery-ness.  And for those that don't know how many potatoes to use... try weighing them.

Delicious!  I love this recipe because it's simple and I usually have all of the ingredients in my pantry.  I did make the following changes and it still turned out great:  baked 2 mid-sized potatoes and halved the butter and sugar.  Try it; you'll love it too!

Raves!   I  did take this suggestion to separate the egg in one of the comments and whip the egg  whites and then add and it was perfect .  This by far is my favorite sweet potato pie recipe.

Quick question:

Is one supposed to use actual Sweet Potatoes... Or Yams? I only ask this because I've never made this dish, nor seen it made. The photo looks like it's made with yams, but I just wanted to be certain.

I used this recipe because from all the recipes I found online this one had the most positive reviews and the most stars! I made this the exact way the recipe says but when I finished it and poured it into the crust it was so so watery!!! It was so watery I almost spilled it putting it into the oven. I was staying positive because I followed the recipe exactly. In about 1 hour and 10 mins it was ready and of course it hardened up. I was so nervous to bring this to thanksgiving dinner as it was my first homemade from scratch dish but guess what....It was amazing!!! (it was a little soft though, more like a casserole than a pie) But, it didn't matter it was so so good!! There wasn't even enough for everyone and people wanted seconds. It really was the best pie everyone said. I am now making 2 of these for Christmas! Does anyone know how to get it a little thicker? Maybe less sweet potatoes? I had to guesstimate 3 pounds because each sweet potato weighs differently. Regardless this was delicious and I cannot wait to make it soon!

If I could give it more stars I would because I have made this as my first sweet potato pie and everyone that has tried it has said they truly love it and of course I added my own twists when it came to the ingredients and of course for me this will be the forever recipe for me from this point on I used brown sugar as well and all I can say is yes yes yes. About to make two more right now lol, so in love with this recipe , my first sweet potato pie ever and it was from scratch by my hands and I am so proud of myself

I love sweet potato pie, and I was always concerned about trying to master the taste that I have come acustom to (my mother's sweet potato pie).  Well, this recipe was just as good as my mother's if not better.  It taste perfect.  I have truly found my sweet potato pie recipe.  I have shared it with several people....

Well I followed the recipe.  I just added some things.  My half of cup of milk ,  I put vanilla bean stalks split open in it and let it simmer on the storve while my potatoes cooked. After straining the milk. I mixed everything like the recipe said. Because it was loose to me, I added a tablespoon of plan flour. I also used real nutmeg.  It was excellent.

For me this was the simplest to make and great taste.  Found out how many sweet potatoes it takes.  I baked 4 and it made 2 pies.  Trial and error.  I cut back on the sugar a little bit.   Semisweet allowed the natural flavor of the potatoes to come through with a hint of sweetness.  I also found that the Cool Whip topping came through better than fighting the sweetness of the pie. First time ever to make a SP pie.  Nailed it!

Made it as written, except with close to 2 lbs. of sweet potatoes (I like a nice full pie) and just a touch more sugar, although I don't think it needed it after all.  Superb taste and texture!  Hubby likes it better than pumpkin pie.  Very easy to prepare, too.  Thanks for sharing!

Oh YES I will make this pie again! I've been making sweet potato pies for 30+ years and this is one of the best. My son-in-law saw me making it and said "I don't like sweet potatoes" - he then tasted a spoonful of the mixture and said "Wow, I like sweet potatoes!" I know he had at least one piece along with my grandson - and a whole pie disappeared in minutes. I use vanilla and lemon liberally, along with almond extract and a bit or orange juice. Cinnamon and nutmeg of course - maybe some allspice next time. Love this pie!

This pie was awesome!  I made my first two pies ever this Thanksgiving, one of them being this sweet potato pie.  I was surprised at how good it turned out.  I can't wait to make it again for another holiday.

This was my first sweet potato pie, I brought it to Thanksgiving at a friend's house, and it was a hit! I followed suggestions from other reviewers: I roasted the sweet potatoes the night before for 1 hour at 400°F and refrigerated them overnight. The skins then came off very easily as well as the fibrous ends of the potatoes with just my bare hands. I actually used about 1 1/2 lb of raw sweet potatoes to get 2 cups of cooked mashed sweet potatoes. I replaced the milk with evaporated milk and half of the white sugar with brown sugar. The filling was much thicker than a pumpkin pie and didn't settle nice and flat like a liquid filling, but it still looked nice. Next time I will use a little more evaporated milk to make it more liquid, and 3/4 cup sugar as it was very sweet. I decorated the top with pecan halves and marshmallows just like the picture and let them cook in the oven for the last 8 minutes, which was too much for the marshmallows but perfect for the pecans.

My family is from the South so I have eaten a lot of sweet potato pie. This is the real deal...the absolute best I have ever tasted. I will however bake my potatoes next time vs. boiling them. I think the flavor will be much richer. Overall it's a winner in my book.

First time making a sweet potato pie. So I made this recipe for thanksgiving. Read some of the reviews. And I followed one reviewer by putting a tablespoon of flour to mixture to make it a slight thicker because it's was to watery. And I made a couple of changes myself. I use a 1/2 cup of white and a have cup of brown sugar for a lil darker texture. Then I use sweet condensed milk to give it a rich taste. And it came out great! Everyone loved it. Nothing was left!

I made this for Thanksgiving and was a huge hit. People who don't normally like Sweet Potato Pie loved it! I followed the recipe, being sure to boil for 50 - 60 min, and it was perfect. Great recipe!

This pie was delicious! I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. white sugar, evaporated milk instead of regular milk, added 2 Tbs. flour and used 2 lbs. sweet potatoes. This will be my go-to recipe for Thanksgiving dessert from now on!

I was looking for a recipe that was close to what my Mom and I used to make. I found this recipe  and the ingredients were  very close . I did change and add a couple of things.
I added 1 tsp. of orange peel, and a tsp.  of hot rise corn meal.
Instead of all milk I halfed with butter milk.  This was the best pie I have made in a long time.
Thank you for sharing!

I used this recipe and made four pies last night,  and OMG, they are the best I have ever made. I did make some minor changes: with the sugar I used half white and half brown, I added 1/4 teaspoon of ginger, and 1 tablespoon of flour.  These pies turned out perfect!

I’ve made this many times now and it’s my favorite go-to potato pie recipe.  The only thing I do differently is reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup.  Sometimes I might add a teensy bit more cinnamon & nutmeg just because I like it a little spicier.  These pies always come out great!

I followed the directions and the flavor is amazing….BUT the filling is way too runny! I may just scrape it out of the pie crust and eat like a soufflé. After I started reading other reviews to figure out where I went wrong is when I saw the suggestions to bake the sweet potatoes instead of boil. I will be making this again, but baking instead.

This is a very good basic sweet potato pie recipe.  I bake my potatoes rather than boil.  They do not seem as runny and they seem to have a richer taste.  I followed some other reviewers and decreased sugar to 1/3 white and 1/3 brown.  I also used canned milk.  I add cloves, ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon and vanilla for spice.  Because I baked the potatoes I did not think I needed to add flour.  Tomorrow will be the judge on that part.  It past the raw taste test for my husband and that is the important test.  Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe. I only use a 1/2 cup of sugar rather than a full cup because...well...diabetes. 

Seriously, never  had any complaints on the sweet factor when using a 1/2 cup. Very good recipe.

First time making a sweet potato pie. This was very good. I cheated and used a 40 oz can of  Princella sweet potatoes. This mixture was enough to make two pies .  I had a small bag of chopped pecans and threw those in the bottom of my pie crust before I added the pie mixture and that was very good.

I made this for the first time. I did adjust a few things. I baked my sweet potatoes. Added 1/2cup of heavy cream instead of milk and added a teaspoon of grated orange peel. Smells divine and tastes wonderful!

I found this recipe on this site a few years ago, when I was hosting my very first Thanksgiving. It was a hit then, and I've made it faithfully every year since. In fact, I just made 2 of these pies tonight! Follow the recipe as-is, and you will not be disappointed!

I liked the basics but made some changes. After reading reviews I substituted heavy cream for milk ( makes it set up thicker) did half brown and half white sugar and added 1/4 t ginger and 1/4 t whole cloves for some spice. It resulted in a pie set like a pumpkin with a natural sweetness I loved. Great basics just needs to be tweaked a little to taste.

More sugar, more nutmeg, more cinnamon. Then perfect... :)  
Was a little soupy. Let it sit for about 5 minutes or so before putting in crust, it thickened.  
Potatoes.. instead of boiling, dice into chunks and place in covered roaster pan and bake on 400 for about half hour or until mashable/done. Add sugar and butter when roasting/baking. No water, no straining, no peeling while hot.

I opted to leave all of the nutritional value in the sweet potatoes and improve on their own natural sweetness by roasting them in the oven to cook them (pre-heat oven to 375 F and poke a bunch of holes in your sweet potatoes with a fork or carving fork and bake them for 45 minutes or until soft throughout. Expect them to weep a bit. If your potatoes are older than a week or look dry, this may not work, as it relies upon the internal moisture of the sweet potato. Wait for the sweet potatoes to cool until you can handle them and cut off one end and squeeze out the flesh.) I also opted not to add any additional sugar, as it isn't really necessary if your sweet potatoes are any good. I also used whole spices that I ground myself. You would be astonished at the difference it makes.

I make this every year from thanksgiving until around March when it starts to warm up. I add a hint more of cinnamon and nutmeg but other than that, it's perfect every time!!!!

I did not make any changes to the recipe, but I needed to cook it 15-20 more minutes than it called for. I used Pillsbury pre-made crust (it's rolled up in a package of two). My husband raved about the pie. Because he's a pumpkin pie fan, I was pleasently surprised at how much he liked it.

Definitely an idiot proof recipe, personally I do not enjoy Sweet Potato Pie, but my wife loves them. I am also a novice cook, usually making several errors in following recipes. But despite bumbling through making this pie, my wife says it is one the best SPP's she has ever had. (Must have gotten the proportions right in the end, and yes she is being sincere). I actually enjoyed the taste of it as well (it's the aftertaste I do not enjoy about SPP, but this recipe's aftertaste was much smoother.) Rated it 5 stars for her, not me, after all it is still a SPP!

I have made this twice in the last month.  I made (2) changes.  I am lactose intolerant and my husband is diabetic.  So, I swapped Splenda in for the sugar and Lactaid in for the milk and it was FABulous!  I didn't get sick and his numbers didn't budge!  If you can make changes and have fabulous results, I can only imagine how good this would turn out as shared!  Thanks so much!  A new fall favorite in our home!

I've never made a pie before so I was nervous. But making it was really as simple as 1-2-3. I followed the directions as written and it was absolutely delicious! Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe.

This was my 1st attempt at making a pumpkin pie. I had my reservations because of all the 1st time horror stories...the pie mixture was runny, the pie fell apart, etc. I followed the recipe 100% and the results were fantastic. No complaints. This pie was fabulous & my family loved it. I wanted to do a test run b4 Thanksgiving . My family reviews were great, which gave me the confidence to make 2 for Thanksgiving. Thanks !

Wow, I loved this recipe. My husband thought it was pumpkin. After telling him it was sweet potato, he told me it was a keeper. He had 2 pieces and another for breakfast. Great way to use my garden surplus of sweet potatoes. Followed the directions (almost) as written. I did bake the potatoes. Thank you for this delicious recipe.

Let me just start by saying IVE NEVER MADE A PIE IN MY LIFE! This is very simple and easy recipe! Based on the reviews I did follow the suggestion of lemon juice and evaporated milk. The only thing I did a twist with, is added roasted pecan pieces on top during the last 15 minutes of baking. My friend loved it so much she requested me to make her SIX Of them for thanksgiving for her family!!! They are from the south and they don't sell or make sweet potato pies around here.

First time to ever make a homemade one. It turned out nicely . Tasted really great. Didn't firm up as well as I would have liked. Going to drain the potatoes more when I try  again.

It set well and tasted good, but was ridiculously sweet. With my next pie, I'll cut the sugar at least a third though I'm thinking more like half with the other half being packed brown sugar.

I used about 1lb of canned yams to save time, and the batter was very loose - not sure if that was related to my substitution of canned for fresh potatoes. I added between 1/4 and 1/2 cup flour to bring everything together. 

Instead of making a whole pie, I used this recipe to make about 48 mini sweet potato pies, using just under 1 tbsp of filling per pie. I rolled out pre-made pie crusts to make them thinner, and cut them into smaller circles for the mini pie crusts. Topped with a little swirl of cinnamon cream cheese frosting.. Pretty big hit :) The frosting does take away from the sweet potato pie flavor, so use sparingly!

This is a keeper!  The ENTIRE family loved it including those that are die hard pumpkin pie lovers. The only change I made was baking the potatoes at 400 degrees for 30-40 mins rather than boiling them.  This change was purely to preserve as many nutrients as possible rather than boiling them out as indicated. The pie turned out delicious all the same.  I WILL be making this again for the holidays.  :)

This was great!  The second time I made some changes and it was even better.  I used four 4 oz. jars of sweet potato baby food instead of a mashed sweet potato.  Because it was much more watery, I decreased the amount of milk and butter.  I used 3 tablespoons of butter and a sixth of a cup of milk.  Best pie ever!!

I have made this with no changes and absolutely love it. I've also made it dairy free by using almond milk. Turned out good too. Great recipe to use when you have a guest that cannot have dairy. I prefer it with the milk though.

I love this even more than pumpkin pie, and the fact it can be made year round is amazing.  I added lemon juice (2 tbsp.) and made two pies at a time, so just doubled everything and used 2 fair sized sweet potatoes....sooooo good!!!!

Great basic recipe
I also use brown sugar, cut down  by a few spoonfuls.It works great  if you add a ripe  banana or pear , zapped in microwave 1-1:30 min .
Too, I blend the potato, skin & all
to up the nutrition ...& sometimes add tiny marshmallow s ;-)

This was a delicious pie. Forgive my ignorance but I'm always confused about the Yam vs. Sweet Potato thing, and whether it actually makes a difference for a recipe. I first tried this pie with a yam, and it was way too stringy. (Don't know if that makes any sense) Then I bought a legitimate sweet potato, and it was perfect--a huge hit at a party! Not too sweet, just tasty and delicious.

Simply delicious! This was my first time making a sweet potato pie by myself (I usually make with my grandmother) and it came out PERFECT! I followed the instructions for the most part. The only variations that I made was using 1/2 sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and 1 tsp of Lemon juice.  I will definitely make again.

Not a fan of pumpkin pie or sweet potato casserole. Saw this recipe and thought I'd give a try. Absolutely delicious. Cooked exactly and turned out delicious everyone loves it. My store sells sweet potatoes in 3lb bags and I find that's perfect for 2 pies after getting the skin and husk off.

I tried this version for one of my Christmas day pies and it was very good. The only changes I made was substituting light brown sugar for the white sugar, sub'ing evaporated milk for regular milk, and I added about 1 T. of all purpose flour. Very good flavor and good texture. I prefer sweet potatoe over pumpkin and this one is a keeper.

I substitute heavy cream for the milk. Also skip the cinnamon and use only 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of the 1 cup of sugar the recipe calls for. Turns out wonderful!

Followed one of the reviews adding 1/4tsp of both ground cloves and ginger. Used evaporated milk instead of regular milk, added 1tbsp of flour( since some reviews said it didn't set up) and split the sugar amount with half brown and the other half white. The only problem I had was a 1# sweet Potato is not done in even an hour! I was boiling mine for at least 90 minutes so make sure to allow time. Am sure it would be easier to do smaller potatoes and they would be cooked faster. But in the end... It was an amazing Pie that people loved.. Additional pecans and whipped topping makes it a desert or a side dish! Thank you!!

This turned out nicely, and tastes very good. It took another 30 minutes to get done at high altitude: we are 4000 feet above sea level. Next time I will try adding a teaspoon of flour to see if it helps or call The King Arthur Flour Co. for tips. I also sprinkled a little brown sugar on top before baking.

The BEST sweet potato pie recipe to be found. I promise you will not go wrong with this recipe. I used Marie Calendars pie crusts and fresh local sweet potatoes and the pies were to die for.

Has been years since I had sweet potato pie made by my grandmother from scratch.  She was a wonderful pie maker and thought it was impossible to match the quality of pie she produced. My lovely girlfriend is a very good cook and I am happy to say with this recipe was able to match my grandmothers skills!!! Thanks Rachel!!!

This was great!  I baked my Sweet Potatoes which came in all odd sizes and shapes from small to medium, so there were about 7 or 8 but they equaled 2 cups after I peeled them and put the insides into the bowl.  I also pre-baked the frozen Marie Calendars Pie Crust per the instructions on the package, and I think that helps make the crust full and flaky even on the bottom.  This pie was a hit!

Very good recipe . My one complaint however would be it's a little on the sweet side. Will definitely use only half a  cup next time I bake bake this pie. Other than that it was fantasic.

I used this recipe last night and my entire family absolutely loved it! This was the first sweet potato pie I've ever made I love how it came out. What I really loved about this recipe is that the pie isn't extremely sweet but is still full of flavor. I will definitely be making this recipe for my future holiday parties!

Great recipe...this is my first time baking a sweet potato pie.. And to my surprise after reading some of the reviews..it turned out wonderfully. I keep the same recipe step by step. I only  added 2 tablespoonfuls of flour to my pie. This time I will add 1 teaspoonful of lemon juice.  This was a great recipe and I recommend it.

I really like this recipe, I have made it over the holidays and it is delicious.  I use Almond milk (for milk), 6tbsp butter, 3/4 cup of sugar for a slightly healthier verison; as well as making my own pie crust since I've had to alter recipes to enjoy these treats due to necessary diet changes.  Love it and recomend this recipe to those who eat it. :)

This is a pretty good recipe.  I've seen some people talk about the filling being 'loose,' which is pretty normal for a puree-based pie like sweet potato or pumpkin.  The best results I've gotten are to make it the night before and refrigerate for at least two hours, but the longer it's refrigerated, the firmer it will be.  Don't freeze it though, it'll separate and be vile.

This is my go-to recipe... however, to really put it over the top, I use evaporated milk, in place of the regular milk, 1 1/2 cup of packed dark brown sugar, in place of the white sugar and a pinch of allspice.  And then, my family, friends and I are in sweet potato pie heaven!!

This was the first pie I ever made, it was very easy to make.My family simply love this pie. My husband is from the south(Alabama ), he says it is just like his mom's. It may be a little too sweet, I usually add less sugar. Other than that it's great.

OMG!!! My husband loves to cook, bake. Today I'm happy he does. He made the above receipe, but used purple sweet potatoes. Delish and the freshness of them is unreal. He found them at farmers market. The only change he made was for the milk. It was close to date wasn't tasting fresh, (he's a food inspector) so he instead used my vanilla almond milk. It may of added flavor, pie is great. Recipe is a keeper will make again for Happy Turkey Day!!

This is a wonderful recipe and very simple. I did add 2 tbs. of flour to the mixture to make sure it'd set and it did very well. My mom and husband loved it. It definitely made to my holiday baking list.

Best pie I've ever had! I had to bake it longer than the suggested 50 minutes as it was quite watery. Will use more sweet potato next time, and substitute half the sugar with brown sugar. I followed other reviewers' advice and used lemon juice, cloves, and ginger, and the flavor was splendid! After it is finished baking, turn off the oven and leave it inside for 15 minutes to get a nice carmelized topping!

I made this for the first time for Christmas eve and it was a big hit.  It was creamy not gritty at all.

First off - am I the only one who didn't know the trick to peeling sweet potatoes is to cook them first?? This recipe would have been worth it for that reason alone! Secondly, no lie, this is the best sweet potato pie I've ever had. Just delicious. I made no changes - the recipe is perfect as written. YUM, and thanks!

There is no need to look for any other recipe for sweet potato pie.  This is tops.  I am from the south and from a long line of fabulous cooks and this is the best sweet potato pie recipe I've ever eaten.  Use 2 cups of cooked, mashed sweet potatoes.

I have tried this recipe several times yet mine continues to come out rather thick...I may be using too much sweet potato.  I might try cutting that back to about 2/3 pound

I've made this recipe three times now and loved it.  I would suggest getting 2 half pound potatoes instead of 1 (1 lb.).  The half pounds will cook in the alloted time and make for easier mixing.

Great recipe! I used the suggested altered recipe from SL. Made it for Thanksgiving and got great compliments. They couldn't believe I made the pie - I had to convince them I didn't buy it from a bakery.

I made this pie exactly as written for Thanksgiving. I had to bake an additional 12 minutes. The pie was fabulous and well received. It was similar to pumpkin pie but richer and creamier.

For Christmas Eve dinner I made it with the following alterations: 1/4 C Brown Sugar Splenda and 1/4 C White Sugar, 1 whole can of fat free evaporated milk, and used small tart shells for individual servings (32 servings). Made the alterations for diabetic family members. It was still fabulous. Thanks!

love recipe.  However, I replaced sugar with 1/2 cup Splenda and  cooked sweet potatoes in pressure cooker (10 mins, mashed them, then add all other items). For the finish touch I baked for 20 mins in my toaster oven so family think I cook using oven. Lisa

Made this tonight using some sweet potatoes from our garden. Did half brown and half white sugar. Added a little flour. Not sure how much sweet potato. Just used what we had. Added nutmeg and a little cloves. Turned out delicious! Will definitely be making this again

I use this recipe EVER year!!! My family loves this recipe.  This year my sister begged me to make the pies again and I was able to back 5 with more mix left over so I will refrig and bake more when I get back for my husband to take to work.  I am a diabetic so I just have to replace sugar with 1/3 sugar leaf.  Only for one pie did I change the sugar and named it but for all other ones I used this recipe.

I unfortunately lost our family recipe for sweet potato pie and came across this recipe while trying to find a replacement.  This pie is delicious and may even be better than the recipe I lost.  I would recommend this recipe as is don't change a thing.

I tried sweet potato pie recipes before, but to date, this one is best.  I tweeked the recipe in two ways - one, I followed the suggestion of one of the other reviewers and used canned evaporated milk instead of regular milk, and two, I substituted Splenda for the sugar (mother is a diabetic).  No discernible taste difference.  And Mom loved it.  Oh, and I used it as a custard-sort of dessert, spooned it into custard dishes and baked for 32 minutes. Yum!

I made the recipe as directed and it was great.
The recipe indicates it makes 1 (9 inch) pie, but I had enough filling for 2 pies. I ate it warm and it was ok, but it was MUCH better completely cooled the following day. I recommend making it 1 day in advance if you can.

This was one of the best sweet potato pies I've ever made!  So rich and creamy and savory all at the same time.  I plan to delight my family with this treat on Thanksgiving.

I love this recipe!!! I also use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white like other users suggested. I steam my potatoes, I cut them in fours, sprinkle cinnamon on them and steam for 1/2 hr or so. The skin comes right off.

I made this pie for Christmas dinner last year and my entire family loved it. My mom said that she'll never buy a pumpkin pie again. Really easy to make too. Making it today for Thanksgiving dinner.

I made this today and it came out really well :)  With a few adjustments, though:

I used 1.5 sweet potatoes, I'm not sure how much they weighed...
no vanilla extract, because I forgot it at the store
a little flour to hold it all together
a little salt to bring out the flavor
only half a cup of sugar
LOTS of spices because I like it that way :D

The consistency wasn't exactly right due to my messing with it, but it's fine, and the flavor is really good :D  I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top and plan to serve it with whipped cream!

100%!!! Few tips, bake the potatoes, add the 2tbsp of lemon juice, add the 1/4 tsp of ginger!!! And if you don't have a mixer, put it in the blender! Perfection!

This pie was fabulous!  Though I have to say I had never had sweet potato pie before, so I had nothing to compare to.  I can't imagine how much better it could have been, though.  I did make a few substitutions, though: 1) used two large potatoes, instead of one, 2) used non-dairy "butter", 3) used almond milk, 4) used agave syrup in place of sugar, 5) and added ground cloves and ginger like another reviewer did.  My taste buds were in heaven...

Wow! This came out fantastic! I have to put it away so I don't eat the whole thing myself! I did as others suggested and microwaved two large potatoes and used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 regular sugar.  This was so easy and delicious! Definite keeper!

I made this following the recipe exactly. The pie set perfectly, and tasted amazing. I might reduce the sugar to 3/4 next time, because it is sweeeeeet. But that won't stop me from finishing this one!

This is delicous. As a kid, my father had a patient from the south who brought him sweet potato pie every time she had an appointment and I grew to love sweet potato pie. While I have had a few other sweet potato pies over the years, they have all been overly heavy and too rich.  This one is perfect and reminds me of the early pies I grew to live. I did have to cook it about 15 minutes longer than the recipe called for though. While many people think this is similiar to pumpkin pie, it has way more flavor while still having a lighter feel, texture and taste. I will surely make this recipe again.  Love it.

First attempt at sweet potato pie at my husband's request, and I followed the recipe as written for huge success!! I did mix the potatoes in a stand mixer and a lot of the "strings" stuck to the paddle so I was able to remove them easily. I will definitely be making this again!

This was a great recipe and very close to my moms recipe.  I made some tweeks.  I didn't use nutmeg because I don't like it.  I also used a gluten free pie crust and I peeled and cut the sweet potatoes then boiled them. They are better that way to me. Pie turned out great even with gluten free pie crust.  I also doubled the cinnamon.

I made this on Christmas eve and it came out very nice.  My son nearly ate the whole pie.  It came out good although I must add that I had 2 pounds of sweet potato instead of a pound...this was not my intention and forgot about the kg and lb conversion (lol). I used the same ingredients above.  It still came out good...not too sweet only the sweetness from the sweet potatoes.

Perfect Sweet Potatoe Pie!! 
I first attempted this recipe for our Thanksgiving '12.. Im from Cali, husband from Ga; so you know his taste buds were raised with a "Southern Home Cooking Flavor".. I made 3 of these pies, (as the recipe is), and he loved them! I heard him tell his mother last night "She will make the Sweet Potatoe Pies for Christmas. Almost as good as yours and grandmas.." WooHooo! Wouldn't, and won't change a thing!

This is the best pie that I have ever tried, and also my 1st to make.  My husband, who is not a big sweets guy, had 2 servings, and said it was better than his favorite pumpkin pie.  I did add 1tbs of flour to make it thicker,and used 2c of mashed sweet potatoes instead of 1 1lb potato, but other than that, followed the directions to a tee.  Thank you, Cougaar.

Really great pie!  I never got the knife to come out clean but my father in law, who is a baker, told me that I can just "jiggle" it and see if it all moves as a unit.  Then it's good to go!  Thanks for the recipe!

This pie was amazing! It was my first time trying sweet potato pie and I am quite proud of myself. I followed some of the other reviews and used brown sugar (only 1/4 cup) instead of the white.I didn't want it too sweet since I was going to add marshmallows to the top. I also used 2% condensed milk and just the egg whites to cut down on some badness. I can't wait for a Christmas party so I can bring this! Thanks for sharing.

Pretty good pie. I wish the directions would have stated that you puree the sweet potato. Some of the larger potatoes had spots where they were not completely boiled to the right consistency. So, my pie had little mini chunks of sweet potato. My family didn't care, but if I was making this for a crowd, I would be more careful to puree the potatoes. Also, I used pumpkin pie spice because that is what I had. It seemed to work out well.

My son requested sweet potato pie for Thanksgiving after living in Knoxville for a year.  I had never made it before and found this recipe...I will never make pumpkin pie again!!!  This was the best ever!  And very easy to make!  Thanks for sharing it!  I peeled, and cut my sweet potatos, 4 large ones, before I boiled them until they were done.

Made the pie according to the directions plus added two tablespoons cornstarch to help it set. Delicious. Made it a second time adjusting the ingredients to fit the dietary concerns of my kids. Made it gluten free, egg free, and dairy free by using a homemade gluten free crust, replaced butter with Best Life Buttery Sticks, used rice milk, and used Egg Replacer for the eggs. Wonderful again and my boys devoured it!!!!

This was a great recipe. The only adjustments I made for my taste was adding 1/3 more cups of sugar and an additional 1/2 tsp more nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla extract and of course homemade crust. It was scrumptious!

This was the first sweet potato pie I've made and it was a huge hit at Thanksgiving this year.  I followed someone's advice and added ginger to it (would've added cloves too, but didn't have any).  It was delicious.  Not too sweet, perfect consistency.

Delicious pie. Made this for Thanksgiving and have been requested to make another. Only change I made was to use 5 tablespoons butter instead of the half cup. I used Butter Flaky Pie Crust from this site as the unbaked shell. Wonderful flavor! Thanks for sharing!

This was the first time making a sweet potato pie and I must say...It was fabulous. My family loved it! We made two pies and both pies were gone in no time. Thank you soooo much! Was so easy to make and so quick to be gone :) Will be making lots more.

This was my first time baking a pie. I don't have an electric mixer, so it was a little work to get it the right consistency. I substituted evaporated milk for the milk, and used half white and half brown sugar. Everyone LOVED it and were amazed it was my first time with pies! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Absolutely delish!  The only changes I made were as others suggested half white & half brown sugar and a few Tablespoons of flour.  Not sure if the flour was needed but it did give it a very good consistency.   I will never make pumpkin pie again!

It's a good recipe. I've made sweet potato pies in the past and this is the first time my potatoes were stringy. The batter was very soupy, watery and I was very tempted to add flour suggested by other reviewers. I decided to stick with the recipe. After baked, the pie had a very good consistency. I think with my other recipes, the batter is a little more thicker and while mixing, I am able to catch the strings with the mixer beater and therefore able to remove the strings from the batter. My theory. Maybe my potatoes this time were just more stringier than what I've ever had before. Next time I will remove the strings before I add the other ingredients. Anyway, I wanted to try the recipe because of all of the great reviews.

Great Basic recipe! I add Orange extract to really bring out the flavors it brightens up the taste considerably..and yes alittle bourbon or other inexpensive brown liquor-- it makes a huge difference and I use a half can of Sweetened condensed milk .. adds a different flavor and helps smooth the texture. I added 1/2 c. of flour and I only use a 1/4 c. of white sugar and a 1/4 c. of dk brown sugar and add extra nutmeg to taste and Voila! super duper yummy pie !

I made this pie tonight just to practice for Thanksgiving on Thursday.  It turned out great.  I will add a tad more sugar next time.  I would love to find out how to make the crust more flaky too.  Over all great recipe.

I just made this pie and ate it while it was still a little hot in the middle.  I read reviews and combined suggestions and added a few of my own.  I used a large can of yams/sweet potatoes.  I used evaporated milk.  To cut calories I used 1/4 c Splenda/white sugar and 1/2 c regular brown sugar. I used 1 t pumpkin pie spice.  Next time I will use Splenda/brown sugar mix.  I did add 15 minutes to the baking time. This was my first time to make a sweet potato pie.  It was excellent.

this is an awesome pie.....I used 1/4 cup of maple syrup instead of vanilla and added 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 3/4 cup of chopped pecans to this recipe. My grandmother has friends from Richamond VA and Charlotte NC.....and they both brought her up a couple bushel of fresh sweet potatoes and she shared them with me....I canned several quarts for the upcoming winter and decided to hold back a few and try my first sweet potato pie.......I'm glad I chose this one..

This is the most amazing pie ever!!!! I am a pie fanatic and this even beats my super creamy and rich chocolate pie. AMAZING! Even better than my homemade pumpkin pie...I am seriously stunned. I changed a couple of ingredients, augmenting them slightly. Thinking of putting marshmallows on top and toasting them lightly. YUM and THANKS!!!

Delicious! I've made this pie twice for my family. I did make a few changes however... I replaced the regular milk with soy milk since there are a few lactose intolerant people. I also used 1/4 cup of sugar instead of what was suggested. I did try 1/2 cup as well and found that it was sweet enough. With some non-sweetened whipped cream and raw hazelnuts on top, this was a good treat for everyone :) Thanks for sharing this recipe COUGAAR!

This was my first try at making a Sweet Potato pie and it was a great success! I altered it by using half sugar and half brown sugar and topped it with crushed pecans. I used fresh sweet potato rather than canned stuff. My friends loved it. Pretty proud of myself!

Excellent recipe with one exception... it was much TOO sweet for me. I'll decrease the amount of sugar next time.

I tried this recipe for the first time last week. It came out perfect. I used 3 medium-sized sweet potatoes, and it did not fall like some other reviewers had problems with. Thanks for the recipe!

Utterly delicious.  I served this for my after-Thanksgiving dinner party last year, and one of the guests said that his favorite dish was the sweet potato pie.

This pie is AWESOME! I make smaller pies every year for the March of Dimes bake sale at my job and  it sells the quickest!  Throughout the year people ask when is the next bake sale because they look forward to this pie.  **I use evaporated milk instead of regular milk***

I made this pie for thanksgiving. I've never made a pie before in my life and it was a HUGE hit! I used a real sweet potato and everyone was confused as to why it was white instead of that yellowy orange color. People often mistake sweet potatoes for yams. Try a real sweet potato its sooooooo good. I'm baking another pie for a bake sale and for when I have company in a few weeks...it's so easy and delicious!

just made this tonight...wonderful! I doubled the recipe and added flour like many suggested and kind of played with the spices and turned out really good. I used canned milk (the whole can) with 3 potatoes and added more spice , end result was really good. I think I will take one of the pies into work tomorrow!

This was my first sweet Potato Pie and it was AMAZING. I made two of them for Thanksgiving, praying they would turn out well. After reading some reviews, I cut down the sugar a little and for half of the sugar, I used light brown sugar. I also added a little bit of all spice. The pie was perfect. Since I made two of them, I used 3 large sweet potatoes. My pies were full to the top, but everyone loved them. I will be making these again very soon.

I used 3 medium sized sweet potatoes. Definitely use a deep dish pie crust  or 2 regular crust. 
Another reviewer's suggestion:   I add a 1/4 tsp of cloves and ginger and 2 tbsp of lemon juice. The lemon enhances the taste of the potatoes. I also add a 1 tbsp flour to the mixture to thicken up a bit. Last, I I halve the white sugar and replace with brown sugar. Try this and you won't be disappointed.

For a crumb topping:  
While the pie is baking, prepare the topping. Mix together 1 egg, 2 Tbsp dark corn syrup, 2 Tbsp brown sugar, 1 tablespoon melted butter, 1/2 tsp maple flavoring, and 1 cup of chopped pecans. Mix thoroughly. Sprinkle over pie.
At 25 minutes left, remove the pie from the oven.
Bake for another 25 minutes until set.

Prepared this Sweet Potato Pie for Thanksgiving and it was wonderful.  My elderly mother has always made the pies and is a very good cook.  She is also very critical, but raved over the flavor of the pies.  I will use this recipe for years to come!

Very easy to make, used a pre made crust - I used two cups of sweet potato for the recipe and found that it was enough for two of the crust (9").  also added extras as suggested by another reviewer ie lemon juice, ginger, and cloves I also baked the potato instead of boiling it. I was afraid the leomon juice would make it sour tasting but it didn't.  It came out tasting really good.

I was really expecting this pie to be as wonderful as everyone else says, but for me, not so much.  My only variation was using half brown half white sugar (as opposed to all white sugar).  My experience was that the pie took much longer than the 55-60 mins to bake.  I inserted the knife and it did not come out clean until maybe an extra 30 or so minutes (possibly more, I lost count after having to add 5-10 mins after each unsuccessful knife-test).  Anyways.  It was edible, but not as great as everyone else seems to think.  I think I will try to make this pie again just to see if I made some sort of mistake the first time.

I followed the recipe just as it is written except that I used canned yams to save time and it tasted awesome! I even spilled extra cinnamon in by accident in one of my pies and it was still good!

just made this pie, and it was great!  everyone was asking me to make it again!  :)  i doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg for a spicier flavor.  i also used a regular pie shell (instead of deep dish) and had enough filling to make two pies!

First time making a sweet potatoe pie.  It is greatttt! My Dad wants one to take home. I followed recipe to a T for the first one. The second one I did half sugar half brown sugar. I'm not a cook so I really can't tell the difference. Any how, thank you soooo much! I think I made a contribution to our Thanksgiving Dinner this year.

This was my second attempt at baking this pie and both times it was fabulous. I took the advice from another reviewer and microwaved the potatoes to cut down on cooking time. I also used half white and half brown sugar and added 1/2 teaspoon each of almond extract and lemon juice. This recipe is most certainly going into my family recipe book!

I made this exactly as written. It had great taste but mine never set?! I cooked it for an hour and 15 mins and it was still jiggly when I pulled it out. What gives? I know how to bake a pie and never had this happen before. Weird. I will try it again. Maybe I beat it too much? either way, taste was really good. My southern bred gramma & mom would have loved it

I followed the recipe and it came out PERFECT! Absolutely delicious:))) This was the first pie I have ever made!! About 40 to 45 minutes into cook time I added a few mini marshmallows and it really came out beautiful:) Only thing I would suggest is getting a deep dish unbaked pie crust. I had bought the regular and it ended up making two pies:) which was great depending on what fits your occasion!

My husband told me that I had to try sweet potato pie after he tasted it for the first time while he was stationed in Afghanistan. He challenged me to compare it to my usual pumpkin...I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by how good it is. This is the recipe he used to make it for me and although I am still in love with pumpkin pie, this recipe is definitely a close second!

Great pie! I added a tablespoon of flour like one reviewer suggested, though I don't know if it made a big difference the pie came out perfectly firm. I was surprised by how quick and easy it is to make this.Thanks!I'll definitely use this recipe again!

am i the only one who had trouble with the butter content?  it was melting out of batter, spilling down the sides of the pie pan, burning on the bottom of my oven, and promptly setting off my smoke detector!  it came out really rich; so, i think next time i'll cut back on the butter and save myself the trouble.  but i wonder how come i'm the only this happened to. otherwise, we loved this!

Great recipe real easy, except I baked my sweet potatoes in the microwave to save a lot of time. Just poke a couple holes, put them on a micro safe plate and zap them 5 minutes at a time til done turning each time.

It was pretty good, though I found myself wanting SOMETHING! Maybe spice, it was just an OK recipe. If you decide to make this, better get Cool Whip, it kinda needs it.

This was perfect. I used less sugar and more sweet potato, but it was delicious. I made sweet potato tarts that were bite-site and everyone loved them! So many compliments for Thanksgiving and Christmas! Thanks!

I was completely out of it and put my oven on a higher temperature than it should have been so the pie turned out a little darker and less fluffy than it should have been but it was still absolutely delicious. Will definitely use this recipe again, will also be sure to double check the oven temp next time!

Absolutely GREAT recipe.  I sometimes add butternut flavoring for a little add flavor, but the recipes definitely does not need it.  So quick and simple to make.

I thought the recipe was pretty good, not too sweet. Although, I did make a  variation to it.  Try adding 2 tablespoons of sour cream. It makes the consistancy of the pie filing more smooth.  Great recipe!

This recipe was easy and sooo delicious. Instead of regular milk i used evaporated milk and substituted half of the white sugar with brown sugar.  Will definitely make this again and again!

DE-LICIOUS! First time making Sweet Potato Pie and this recipe is really fantastic! The only change I made was to the sugar - I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown. And, it took much, much longer than 55-60 minutes to bake it. I had to bake mine for 1 hour 45 minutes in order for it to come out right.

Very, easy and good sweet potato pie.  I used other reviewer's suggestions.  Used half C brown sugar and half a cup of white sugar.  This recipe is almost fool proof.

I have tried a few sweet potato pie recipes from allrecipes.  This by far is the best, its the real deal. Only change - I opted for evaporated milk!!  A great and easy recipe to follow. I had to baked 3 pies because the first disappeared so quickly.

This pie is out of this world!!!!!!  the pie deserves 10 stars.  I made a few minor changes. Just like another person suggested I added 2 tbls of flour to the mixture. I halved the sugar for 1/2 splenda sugar mix and an other 1/2 from splenda brown sugar. I added 1/4 tbs of pumpkin pie spice that I have in my pantry and never get to use my husband and guest raved about this pie. Thank you

I couldn't believe that it taste so much like pumpkin pie.  Maybe I'm using the same spices.  I twet the recipe by using 2 Tbsp of flour, evaporated milk, 1/4 cup of sugar, and other spices like ginger and clove.  The pie came out great since this is my first time making a sweet potato pie.  It is so cheap to make.  My Yams (sweet potato) cost me $1.50.  Pie shell $1.50.  You just can't beat a fresh pie with preservatives.  Unfortunately, in my whole family, only me and my sister likes yams.  All for me and Vitamin A!

This is an excellent recipe. I lost my recipe and my boyfriend wanted homemade pie for thanksgiving. I knew where to find the best recipe. I made 4 pies and added two teaspoons of  fresh lemon juice and two tablespoons of flour to the recipe for 4 pies. It turned out great. I recommend this one.

Really, REALLY good.  Made it today for T-Day.   After reading the other reviews, I made a few minor small changes: added 1/2 tsp ginger, added 2 tsp fresh lemon juice, cut back the sugar a little from 1 c white to 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 c white, and roasted the sweet potatoes (2 big ones) instead of boiling them (less watery, richer tasting, and a lot less stringy.)   If you're a stickler for form, you may want to add just a tbsp or 2 of flour to give it more body and make it easier to cut - but if you're okay with a slightly sloppy pie, it's fabulous just as it is.    Looking forward to pie for breakfast... ;) thanks, cougaar!

This was the first sweet potato pie I ever made and I was surprised at how good it was. Hard for a beginner to mess up. I doubled the recipe for two pies. I would use next time slightly less sugar and use condensed milk instead of regular.  This time I used half and half. My wife even liked it and she doesn't like sweets that much!

Added 1/4 tsp ground cloves to original recipe.  Delicious!  And I don't even like sweet potato pie. :-)

Very, very good!  I think next time I will add more spices, but still, it was excellent!  Nothing but compliments on it!

Tasted exactly like I wanted it to!  I doubled the spices and added 1 T of flour as suggested by another reviewer.  This was a test pie for a pie making contest at work - I plan to use it for sure!

Great pie, but guests couldn't tell it was sweet potato.  They thought it tasted like pumpkin pie!  Needless to say it is good.    I reduced the sugar and used brown & white sugar.  Added lemon juice and flour as other suggested.

Just tried this one out last night. Used a blender to blend everything together and still worked out great!!! Took a little longer than the time stated to cook fully for me. Keeps the sweet potato flavor well! I'm making another one tonight!

I baked this pie using 1/2 cup Splenda and 1/4 cup Splenda Brown Sugar.  I added the additional spices recommended by SL, 1/4 tsp cloves and ginger and 2tbsp lemon juice. I also went with the suggestion of evaporated milk and additional tbls of flour.  This is an excellent "no sugar added" Pie.

We had a bunch of sweet potatoes from our garden so I decided to try making a sweet potato pie. It's a good thing I found this recipe! I took one pie to work and a coworker said she grew up on sweet potato pies and this was one of the best ones she ever had. We used 1/2 brown sugar and added a teaspoon of clove. We also put pecans in the pies thinking that they'd float to the surface while baking. The pecans stayed at the bottom near the crust, but gave it a nice nutty flavor. Will definitely use this recipe again!

The pie came out very good but a bit sweet for my taste. I did 1/2 white sugar & 1/2 brown sugar. Next time I think I'll add less white sugar. My husband believes it came out perfect. Thanks, hon.

Three medium potatoes were just enough for the pie. I also left out the spices because they tend to over power the taste of the sweet potatoes. Afterall, it is a sweet potato pie!

OMG! Total pie heaven, this is going in my favorites book! I followed some other suggestions and used evaporated milk, half brown sugar and half white sugar, and before adding anything to the yams, I whipped them in my mixer to get rid of strings (may use food processor next time for better chopping, not a major issue however.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe :)

This was the first time I made sweet potato pie.  My husband doesn't like pumpkin pie so I wanted to try something different.  He absolutely loved it.  Last time I made it, I added the sprinkles of white sugar to the crust rim as recommended on the previous review; turned out excellent!

I just made this pie and it was great! My husband said the best sweet potato pie he has ever had. I doubled the recipe and had some filling left over so will use deep dish crusts next time. I took advice from other reviews and added flour and divided the white sugar with brown. The pie is seasoned perfectly and set up great too. Will make this yummy pie again and again.

This was an unexpected delight!  The recipe was easy and with a dollop of whipped cream, it was perfect.  I found that it had a nice texture and held its shape on the plate.  I made two for two separate homes for Thanksgiving and each reported that there wasn't a crumb left! Thanks

This was VERY good!  REminded my of my fathers SPP (Yes, my father was the chef of our family :-0)Only thing was I made a BIG mistake out of laziness and used canned Yams.  It wasn't bad but I think the pie lost some of it's "true" taste because of that.  I have printed this recipe and put it in a safe place!  I will be making this again for New Years Dinner!!!...the right way with real Sweet Potatoes!!!!

This really is a very good sweet potatoe pie recipe. I bake my sweet potatoes for that extra flavor and use a 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 of brown sugar it comes out perfect every time. We practially fight over the last piece. :)

I was worried at first after mixing all of the ingredients together.  The eggs and butter seemed to separate after mixing.  (Not sure, there were little white clumps in the sweet potato mixture)After it baked though, it looked fine.  It was actually better after it sat in the refrigerator for a day and the pie had some time to settle.

This was very good, but....is it supposed to taste like pumpkin pie? Because I don't know if I would have known a difference in a blind taste test. It was a fantastic pumpkin pie; I guess I was expecting it to taste like....sweet potatoes.

Fantastic! I was in england for thanksgiving this year and as I couldn't find any canned pumpkin so I decided on this pie instead. I followed other suggestions by switching to half brown sugar/half white, adding some lemon juice and also some flour to thicken it. This pie turned out to be so scrumptious, even the picky English people that I live with gobbled it up!

Very good. I do make some adjustments I add a 1/2 cup of brown sugar and pecans on top. Also in the sweet potato batter I add a tbsp of flour and vanilla butternut extract. This is a winner.

Very Good!  I don't really like sweet potatoe pie, even though I love sweet potatoes, but my boyfriend absolutely loved this recipe.  I used two bags of frozen cubed cooked sweet potatoes. (very easy and a time saver) I poured the batter into two Marie Claire pie crust....I will make this again a at Christmas. thanks.

This recipe was FANTASTIC!!! I have NEVER gotten so many compliments on any pie I ever made. I did 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, cut the sugar down a bit and used evaporated milk as different folks had suggested. 
I think anyone who had a problem with this recipe made a mistake somewhere.

I made this for thanksgiving along with the eagle brand pumpkin pies and they tasted very similar and both very good! I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup because I didn't want it too sweet and cooked it about 15 minutes longer. Besides that, I didn't change a thing.

Now I dont usually eat sweet potato pie but I just couldnt resist when I smelled the aroma. But why do they call it sweet potato pie when u need to use yams instead of sweet potatoes? I had to throw out 10 sweet potatoes, but I got over it. I will always use this recipe for this pie. Thanx alot.

Excellent!!  I always make pumpkin pies ( my husbands favorite) because they have a more rich/tasty flavor than the typical " bland" sweet potato pie.  I only tried this because a friend gave me some sweet potatoes and my husband was tired of looking at them try to sprout  the counter. I reviewed this recipe and the only change was adding a tbs of flour as recommended by another member. My husband said "This is the best pumpkin pie you've ever made"!!. And believe me, I've made a lot.  My son ate all the  first pie, but two pieces (breaking my husbands heart), and later said " I wouldnt have eaten it if I'd known it was sweet potatoes"!! I liked jmillers suggestion of using canned potatoes in a pinch,( because I always made pumpkin pie with canned pumpkin), but I do love the pleasure of starting with that one lone potato!! Makes me feel like an artist!!

Thank you so much for this recipe. Pumpkin pie has always been my favorite until I tried this recipe. So delicious and I got a lot of compliments on it. The only things I changed were that I used half cup of Splenda and half cup of brown sugar. I also used Carnation evaporated milk instead of the regular milk and added a TBSP of flour to slightly thicken the filling. Perfect!

I am not a sweet potato eater, but my husband was disappointed I did not make a sweet potato pie for Thanksgiving so I ended up making this 1 and between this recipe and the gourmet sweet potato casserole recipe from this site, I am now a sweet potato eater! I used pumpkin pie spice in place of nutmeg and it was delicious!

My grandmother who is a pumpkin pie purist tried my pie and loved it! I also  drained a can of sweet potatoes to save time and added flour. I'm still getting used to the new oven I have so I overcooked the crust a little bit but the filling was great!

This recipe is WONDERFUL!  The only thing I changed (by mistake at first) was... I used 2-lbs of sweet potatoes instead of just 1-lb.  Obviously, I couldn't quite use all of the mix in the pre-made crust, but the pie is AWESOME!

Thank you!!

This pie is awesome! I'm not that fond of pumpkin pie either and I loved this one! I followed some ideas from other reviews, like using canned potatoes, half brown sugar, evaporated milk and being a cinnamon lover I used 1/2 tablespoon instead. Use a deep dish pie shell. Thank you for the recipe!

Delicious. I followed some other suggestions and added ginger, flour to thicken, and lemon juice to bring out the flavor. I also added a couple drops of red food dye to make it a bit more bright orange. When it was done, still warm, the texture was a little mooshy, but the next day, after refrigeration, it was firmer but not hard. Everyone raved over it! No complaints here.

Perfect in every way! I had never had Sweet potato pie before, and found it to taste very similar to pumpkin pie. Just slightly different texture. I added cool whip to the top and it was fantastic!

Tasted great, but was a little mushy.  However, this may be because I didn't bake it in enough heat; I think my oven thermometer's a little off...

Never having had sweet potato pie in my life, I wasn't sure what to rate this exactly. While I still prefer pumpkin, I think this turned out fine. I used some of the suggestions for 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar, lemon juice and spices. It did indeed take an easy almost 2 hours to get it to set up. I did not add the tbs of flour as suggested. I do like adding toasted pecans on top. I roasted the sweet potatos in the oven for about 45 minutes (an hour if slow oven) and pulled the skins off easily rather than boiling and losing flavor or dealing with strings. For all the trouble though, I'd just make pumpkin.

Best recipe! EVER for Sweet Potato Pie. I had some leftover baked sweet potatoes and used them instead of boiling them. The pies were Fantastic. I just love this website.

I would have rated this a 5, but I didn't follow the recipe exactly as written.  I used others' suggestions and used 1/2 C white sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar.  I actually thought it could have still been sweeter.... I'm very southern and I like my sweet stuff sweet!  I also am not a big fan of nutmeg, so I personally think the recipe calls for too much of it. I actually think it would be better without it altogether, but that is just a matter of taste.  I took this pie to a church dinner and every bit of it as eaten and I heard no complaints!

This tastes like Thanksgiving! I accidentally used sweetened condensed milk (duh) but it still turned out so tasty! A little sweet but the best sweet potato pie I'e ever made.

Good and easy. I used a sweet potato as called for, but the color was not what I have seen on any other sweet potato pie I've had. I must have had yam pie, because this had a yellow/brown color, not a pretty orange. Thrown off by that, but it tasted pretty good.

I will only make sweet potato pie instead of any other from now on.  I read the reviews and made a few changes.  I used about 2 and 1/2 cups of mashed sweet potato, I made the crust from scratch (with Crisco), I increased the vanilla to 1 tbsp and before I baked it I topped it with mini marshmallows and sprinkled brown sugar.  My family agrees that this will be the only pie in the family for a long time!

This pie is great! I use raw sugar instead of white sugar. My mixture has yet to be thin but I am probably using more sweet potatoes (2 large ones) since I'm filling a 9.5 inch pan. I added 3/4 cup milk to thin it a bit but it was still thick. I cook and peel the sweet potatoes the night before, store them in the fridge, to save prep time. Enjoy!

great recipe...my guests enjoyed it!  I replaced regular milk with evaporated milk because I wanted it a bit creamy.  I also followed a couple of suggestions from others---added 1 tbsp flour in mixture---to thicken it up, and lemon juice---about 1 tsp.  will definitely keep this recipe and make it again!

I made this for Thanksgiving and had never had sweet potato pie before.  It was great! My husband who doesn't like sweet potatos actually loved it.  It came out with perfect consistancy, I did use about 2 cups of mashed sweet potatoes rather then only using one.  I blended it with a mixer and folded in the eggs.  I also reduced the sugar to about 3/4 cup.  It was perfect!

FABULOUS!!!  I followed some of the other users' recommendations and this pie is delicious!  Next time I make it, I am going to make a pecan-graham cracker crust and probably add 1-2 more tablespoons of flour.  Thanks for the recipe.

I've been making this recipe for at least 4 years.  My father in law said it was the best sweet potato pie he had ever had and I get compliments every time I make it.  I do strain the potato mixture to make it smooth.

Great recipe.  I had lost one that was given to me years ago.  This one comes very close.  I did only use half the nutmeg, as I'm not a big nutmeg fan.  The pies were gone so quickly!

This is a very good pie. I made one with a graham cracker crust and one with a regualar pie crust both were very good.  The only thing I did differently was add the juice of one lemon to t he sweet potato mixture.  The lemon brings out the sweet potato.

Excellent.  No one at my party had ever tried this, including myself...and it was a huge hit!  Great for people who like pumpkin or those who don't.  It's just the right amount of sweet.

Thanks so much for sharing!

This was quick, easy and delicious.  I told my family it was pumpkin pie and they loved it thinking it was.  I also used yams instead of sweet potato for the orangier color.

This sweet potato pie is one of the best I have EVER tasted. I tried it for Thanksgiving and it was a total hit.  A friend of mine who had NEVER eaten sweet potatoes let alone a sweet potatoe pit was blown away...and she wants me to bake her one personally for Christmas for her home.:-)

I've made this exactly as the recipe dictates and it comes out perfect.  

It's also a good starting point.  Overseas this Thanksgiving, I could only find white sweet potatoes, which are a bit gray when cooked.  To make it more visually appealing, I added a few cooked carrots and used half brown sugar.  It looked like pumpkin pie and tasted great,

I love this recipe but my husband wanted to lighten up so I sub with light oleo and splenda. Turn out really good but of course not as sweet. I also added 1/2 cup walnuts. We love nuts in everything.  Next time I will try 1/2 splenda and 1/2 sugar. I personally would like a tad bit sweeter but of course hubby loves it as is.  Really good with cool whip too.

This was a pretty good recipe.  I think it needed about a half cup more sugar and a teaspoon of allspice to give it more flavor, but overall a good recipe. (I really liked how it filled up my deep dish pie crust.  Definitely not a stingy pie)!

Nice recipe.  Make sure you use a quality    butter, cheap butter doesn't mix well.  I added a splash of Puerto Rican rum, worked great.

This pie has an excellent flavor.  It crumbles a little more than anticipated.  Maybe next time I'll add one more egg to make it more dense and custard-like.

Best sweet potato pie!  Instead of milk, I used evaporated milk and substituted the suger with Splenda for baking.  I also added 2 Tablespoons of flour to thicken it.  The consistency was perfect!  I can't wait to make this again!

This was quite good. First time I ever had sweet potato pie before. We'll definitely make it again. We used a bit less sugar (about 2/3rds cup) but otherwise followed the recipie almost exactly.

This is a very good recipe.  I benefitted from comments that other reviewers made.  I used about 4 small to medium potatoes, halved the potatoes and boiled them.  I didn't have nutmeg so I used a dash of allspice instead.  In addition to the vanilla I added ½ tsp of lemon extract. (Next time I'll try a teaspoon.) I used ½ brown sugar and ½ white sugar and added 2 Tbs flour to thicken.  I baked it in a ceramic tart pan using a homemade pie crust.

Wonderful! I followed the recipe, except substituting half and half for the milk.  The recipe was so easy and the results so good, I would say it is virtually bulletproof.  Thank you Joyce.

This was a great, no fail recipe.  Following the most consistent suggestions, I microwaved the potatoes, added 2 Tbsp. flour, split the sugar--half cup brown, half cup white, and used evaporated milk.  So easy, and as a failing pie-maker, I now have a recipe I can take pride in!

This pie was very easy to make and very tasty. I substituted sweet condensed milk for the whole milk and it was perfect.

This is a wonderful recipe.  The first time I followed the directions exactly.  It was really good.  The second time I used the blender to mix all of the ingredients and it was even better.  I also tried using condensed milk (low fat) and it seemed a bit creamier. Either way, this is a fabulous pie.

It tasted horrible when I made it. It was too sugary, and had much too much butter. To fix that, I had about 3/4 cup sugar, and replace 1/4 cup of butter for 1/4 cup Vegetable oil. Also, I would recommend putting the ingredients in the blender, so that it comes out smooth. After that it tasted great.

My husband said 'this is just like mamas'!!
To reduce calories, I used 1/2 the butter, 1/4 c. sugar and 1/2 c Splenda instead of 1 cup sugar and no nutmeg. Also added 1/2 t of lemon. I'm make this in a pie plate without crust to save more calories.  This is the 3rd time I've made it in 2 weeks!  I'm so happy to find this recipe !!

I don't eat pie but my husband does.  Sweet potato pie is his favorite and I wanted to surprise him.  After he tasted it, he did not believe that I made it.  He said that it was among the best he ever had!  Thanks Joyce Waits for a fabulous recipe.

This was great...most definitely a keeper!  I did add 2 tablespoons of flour and cut sugar to 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup as I read reviews before I started and noticed these were two issues that came up most.

This is a great recipe.  The only changes I made were to use a full tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 C brown sugar and 1/2 C white sugar.  I'll be making this many more times.

First time I made a sweet potato pie, well, first time I have even tried it. I rather enjoyed it, the texture was a bit different, and reminded me alot of pumpkin. My niece loved it, infact she ate probably 3/4 of it and shes only five. The key to this pie, is of course, a good crust, and thankfully, and humbly, i make the best crust around.

I've made this twice in two weeks - I can't get enough!  The wife and kids love it too.  The first time I made this, after 20 min of boiling the sweet potato, I got impatient and just nuked it for another 6 min - and it came out easy to peel (though a tad bit mushy).  I recommend just microwaving the potato for 9 min.

Delicious and easy to make.  I did not alter the recipe at all.  Everyone enjoyed this pie -- I served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  We all agreed it didn't taste at all like a sweet potato but was still very yummy!

I saw the comments about using evaporated milk  but I only have condensed milk.  I used a small can of condensed milk and did not add the sugar.  Sweet potato pie is my boy's favorite.  I have made him several pies before without using a recipe and he liked them.  But when he tasted the one I made from this recipe, he said Yum, Yum, Yum.  I will be making him these pies more often.

Didn't taste like the ones I grew up with. Pretty Blah! I added half a can of pumpkin and that gave it the flavor I was looking for. But hey! Whatever works, right?

This is a very good recipe. I made this for Thanksgiving. My pies turned out great and disappeared quickly. My family really enjoyed.
Thanks.

This recipe was truly delicious!  I thought it was very easy to make.  I doubled my recipe and was worried that it might not turn out well, but it did. It was not heavy and not overly sweet.

Guests loved it.  Nice creamy consistency, and the spices are a nice touch.  It reheats well, too.  I may cut back a bit on the sugar next time though; it is very sweet.  I had more than enough batter to fill a deep-dish crust. Thanks.

Tasted great, but the family wasn't thrilled by the idea of sweet potatoe pie.  Had difficulty getting them to taste it.  The admitted it was good, but preferred to stick with the traditional pumpkin.

I just finish the pie and it was great. I don't think I can wait until the holidays to eat it again, unless I make every month a holiday. Thanks for the recipe.

I have been making pies for years, I made 5 pies for Thanksgiving to take to various people. My sons ate one that night. They stated this was the best I had ever made. I took one to my boss who was on vacation the next week and she left me a voicemail to tell me this was the best she had ever eaten. Great recipe!

I have been making sweet potato pie for my family for the last seveal years.  I lost my original recipe, so I tried this one this past Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it!!  They kept complimenting me on how delicious and buttery it was.  The funny thing is that this recipe is a lot faster and cheaper than my other one!  It's the one I will be using from now on!

This was my first sweet potatoe pie and it turned out great.  I made it for Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  Per review of the other reviews, I might try adding cream cheese instead of milk for a different taste.  But there was no need to adjust this recipe.

Since discovering this pie one month ago I have made it four times and every time has been a smashing success. The pie is now my signature recipe, so don't go telling people I didn't invent it or i'll be in big trouble! Even in the northeast where they don't know sweet potato pie from black-eyed peas, the pie has been hungrily devoured whenever I bring it to a party and disappears faster than a thing that disappears quickly when I make it for my roommates. I use pilsbury pie-crust-in-the-box and nuke the sweet potato for 10 minutes, and I can get the thing made in under 2 hours - such bliss!

Made this pie for Thanksgiving. It was great.Real nice flavor. I used this recipe instead of "my own" and I think I will continue to use it! If I were to change anything--I would add a little more cinnamon--but that's my personal taste. Husband also loved it.Thanks for foolproof recipe!
