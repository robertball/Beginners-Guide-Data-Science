We love feta cheese, so I knew this would be a hit, and it was.  The potatoes are so creamy and the feta flavor shines through nicely without overpowering.  This recipe has been in my recipe box for a year and a half.  Glad that I finally made them and it went very well with 'Yummy Stuffed Peppers' and 'Mexican-Greek Stuffed Green Peppers' both from AR.  RIP, BigShotsMom.

Family loved this recipe.  I did do a couple of minor tweaks.  Using my potato masher I mashed the garlic into the potatoes then added the yoghurt.  Also added a little black pepper as well.   Will be making again.  Thank you BSM and may you fly with the angles.

Made this with some stuffed peppers tonight, it came out pretty good. I did have to add some milk to it since I didn't have enough yogurt. I will be making this again. 
 Thanks!
