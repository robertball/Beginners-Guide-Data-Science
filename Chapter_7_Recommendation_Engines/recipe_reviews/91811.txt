Definitely an interesting recipe. My one substitution may have been the one that took it off, my husband hates anise and anything in the anise family - including fennel, caraway, and dill. So I had to either leave it out or find something else. I used a little ginger. The taste mingled well. In the end, the color and texture of the sauce were pepto bismol. It was a little hard to get through. There wasn't enough tang so I squeezed lime on my chicken and in the sauce as I ate it. My husband wouldn't eat it at all. If you like new things it's worth the try. Stick with the anise!
