I've been looking for a soft, puffy gingerbread recipe for years.  I bake a lot and try pretty much every gingerbread recipe I can find.  This was pretty good, but didn't stay soft once it cooled.  It did puff up when it was in the oven, but flattened again before it finished baking.  It tasted really good and it kept it's shape really well, so it's definitely a good recipe, just not the best.  By the way, this is much easier to work with if you roll the dough between two sheets of wax paper, loosen the paper on both sides, and then cut out with cutters.  This way, you don't need excess flour which can toughen the dough.

I don't know WHAT any of the negative reviews could possibly be about!!!  I found this recipe on here about  years ago and have made them EVERY year since.  EVERYONE I bring them too loves them.  They are not as "harsh" as a typical gingerbread cookie ... softer in texture and milder in taste.  Yes, the dough can be a bit hard to roll out but it is WAY worth it for the YUMMIEST gingerbread cookie I've ever had!!!

I'm not the most experienced baker, but most things I try for the first time come out good. I followed this recipe to the exact detail and the dough was terribly hard to roll out. It crumbled apart the more you tried. My husband suggested adding a little water but I didn't want to ruin the recipe...so I put a chunk of the dough on my board, sprinkled a tiny bit of water, rolled it out, and then cut a heart cookie. I baked that one to test it, and while the taste itself wasn't bad, the texture was weird. I chilled the rest of the dough overnight thinking maybe the minimum 3 hours wasn't long enough, tried again this morning, and ran into even more difficulty. Granted, this was my first attempt at making gingerbread cookies, but I probably would have had better luck just following the recipe on the bottle of molasses! Sorry to be critical, but that was my experience. I should have read more of the reviews before putting the time and effort into this, since the majority seemed to run into the same problems I did.

Cookies were very good. This is a mild tasting gingerbread cookie. I had to throw the first batch of dough out because it was very dry and wouldn't come together so I cut the flour by 1/4 cup and mixed all the wet ingrediants first than added the dry instead of alternating like the recipe said.

I thought these cookies were quick and easy! The flavor is mild gingerbread with a soft,yet firm texture, which made for easy decorating. I loved them and my kids loved them. We used the decorater's frosting made with butter, milk, vanilla, and powdered sugar found here at allrecipes. That frosting is sweet enough to make the cookies perfect. I don't know why some people had a hard time working with the dough. I divided it in half and rolled it out using flour as needed. Quickly cut them out and baked them. Could not of been more simple. In a nutshell: If you need a quick, easy, yummy gingerbread cookie recipe, this is it!

i'd rate this a zero if it was available. I followed your so called recipe to the letter,not only was this dough dry but what cookies were able to make it to a cookie sheet were the dryest flatest tasting cookies i ever made. next time get your recipe items correct. i will be sure not to use any of your recipes again!!!!!

As many have noted, these cookies are not very sweet at all.  I wish I had read them beforehand, but I was under a deadline so I just jumped in.  These cookies are bland as sand, with a texture about as good.  Ended up throwing them all away.

This recipe is excellent.  I did add grated orange peel and substituted honey for molasses to give it more of the Liebkuchen (German gingerbread taste) and it was excellent.

This was a really easy recipe.  They turn out more 'cakie' than cookie like but delicious.  I do not recommend making and decorating with small children... the cookies break really easy and they get upset... funny... kids!

I combined several suggestions on here. I doubled the spices, except the cloves. I substituted 1/2 cup of flour with whole wheat flour and used a full stick (1/2 c.) of butter. Also omitted the baking soda and used 2 tsp. baking powder. I used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/2c. white sugar and added a tsp. of vanilla.  I refrigerated for a half hour and just dropped the dough onto the cookie sheet and flattened with a glass bottom coated in cooking spray and sprinkled with sugar.  I cooked for 6 minutes and pulled directly off the cookie sheet.  Very yummy and chewy and great if you want a quick cookie to serve with morning coffee!

While much milder than I was hoping , I thought the cookies that resulted from this recipe were very tasty and that the recipe itself was quite easy. I had to add a few more drops of water to the dough to get it to stick together, but that is not atypical in baking (as anyone who has ever made a pie crust will tell you), but if you use a little common sense this recipe is quite fun and easy  and what you end up with is a cookie that is pleasantly reminiscent of an animal cracker (only chewier). The other bit of advice I can offer is to not marry yourself to the 8-10 minute baking time, if the cookies are done before that, take them out. If the cookies seem to be hard when they cool, reduce the baking time (remember, cookies continue to cook after they come out of the oven, so a softer cookie can often be achieved by knocking a minute or two off of the baking time). The only other thing i can suggest is that you beat the butter and sugars together first then beat in the water, otherwise it'll be next to impossible to get a smooth mixture. In other words, keep an open mind with his recipe and you will be pleasantly surprised.

The secret to keeping these cookies soft and chewy is to roll out the dough on plastic wrap or wax paper while it’s still warm; then chill it before cutting into shapes.

I thought these were pretty good...I don't know why people were so negative. I changed the 3/4 cup molasses for 1 cup and the 1 tsp ginger for 2 tsp. The extra molasses helped keep the dough together and the extra ginger balanced the flavor out so they didn't taste so much like molasses.

These were good! But not exeptional. If you are looking for a milder, sweet cookie this is the one for you! They are very soft, don't be mislead by the tough crumbly dough. Very good, but I like a spicier cookie.

I made these recently due to a sudden gingerbread craving. Rather than let them cool and then roll the dough out, I dropped tablespoon sized blobs of dough onto a tin-foil lined baking sheet and baked them straight away. If done like that, they finish baking with soft, almost cakey quality to them. Simply fantastic.

I loved these cookies! I was looking for a gingerbread cookie that was soft and this was it! The recipe was very easy to make and had basic ingredients that most people have available. The only changes I made to the recipe were, I only let my dough cool in the fridge for 1 hour and it worked out good.  I also used pumpkin pie spice and cloves instead of the individual spices, tasted great! I also frosted them with powdered sugar icing which added the extra sweetness that I felt they needed!! My son LOVES these cookies. He has never liked any kind of cookie except for these gingerbread cookies!

These gingerbread cookies are excellent! I was looking for a softer cookie and this is it. I did not read any of the reviews before I made these, because I found them in my Allrecipe cookie cookbook and not on this site. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. The only problem I had was when I was trying to get them off the cookie sheet--they were stuck, but came off with a thin spatula. I found that it was easier to get them off right after I took them out of the oven. To the reviewers who complained about these not being soft--gingerbread is different than other cookies. Normally it is dry and hard, these are soft and do not crunch when you bite into them. If yours came out hard, try putting them into a lock-n-lock plastic container for a few days. Gingerbread needs time, that's why in Europe it is made weeks before Christmas. I love the taste of these as well--they are not supposed to be sweet like many other American cookies. All in all, these were wonderful and I had no problems making them aside for the little problem mentioned above. I decorated mine with sliced almonds, walnut halves and raisins before I baked them and they look beautiful. I am going to hang some of them on my tree. Thank you for a wonderful recipe, Sara.

WoW. These are quite possibly the worst cookies I have ever made.   I learned a valuable lesson however - never triple a recipe you've never tried to before, no matter how 'Christmas-rushed' you may be.

I tried this recipient last year, and it was extremely crumbly and dry, but I gave it another shot today and they turned out perfectly after adjusting a few things. Instead of 1/2 cup of white flour, I used whole wheat flour and I used 1/2 c. Brown sugar and 1/2 c. Sugar to make it a different kind if sweet. I also doubled all of the spices except the cloves and used 3/4 c. of molasses. The cookies turned out terrific! My family thought they were amazing, I wish I could have taken credit for the recipe. You just need to roll out the dough in between max paper or plastic wrap before chilling.

My husband thought this was the recipe he used last year, well he was mistaken!! I usually try to be nice with criticism, but I did not care for the taste of these. They make easy, perfect cutouts, but the flavor is just not there! Researched and remembered he had made the McCormick spice recipe last year and they are great tasting. A gingerbread cookie should be able to be eaten with or without icing as I enjoy and this recipe really have no sweetness. Great for decorating the tree LOL

these were easy to make, and turned out great.  i did modify the amount of butter to 3x what the recipe called for, and will prob do 4x next time (1/2 cup, or 1 stick).   the dough becomes too crumbly otherwise.  that aside, great results from this recipe!

The only change I made was to add an egg for cookie stability once baked.  These are wonderful cookies.  Soft, moist, and not too strong in flavor. I like the fact that there is no shortening in this recipe.   I also iced my cookies with vanilla tub frosting.  It sets up well and rounds out the flavor!

I used this recipe for the first time this year and I will keep using it.  These cookies were delicious.  The dough was a little hard to work with but then again I didnt refrigerate it as my 3 year old was too excited to wait.  I will definitely refrigerate it next time.  I sprinkled flour on the counter and on the rolling pin and with a LOT of effort it rolled out fine for me to cut the shapes.  Probably would have been less work had I chilled it first.  Oh well, next time I will - and there will be a next time.

Too many gingerbread cookie recipes are rock hard... this one is so much more enjoyable. 
Definitely use the "gingerbread frosting for cookies" with these cookies.. it gives them more flavor and a kick (kinda like "red-hots")
Crumbly dough issue.. try molding the dough (like bread) before refrigerating.. this will distribute the moisture better, and allow for more consistency, less crumble.. and easier rolling. 
Flour: caution on the flour, use too much and you will have flour-powdered cookies.. when cooked the flour is still there. I like the rolling between wax paper suggestion (I will try that nex time). 
overall.. EASY recipe.. and enjoyable.. grab a glass of milk with these..

By far the best recipe I've ever used for gingerbread cookies.  The dough was easy to work with and the cookies are delicious!

This is a keeper!  I followed this recipe exactly, and the cookies were sturdy enough for my three year old and her 2 1/2 year old friend to decorate (only three broke out of the whole batch).  They were still chewy a few days later.  They were a bit spicy, but that's what I expect in gingerbread.

I found these to be the best cookies when it came to gingerbreads. They were soft,chewy and very very flavorful. Thank You very much for sharing them!

This recipe was fantastic.  My husband, who doesn't like anything without chocolate in it, loved these cookies.  I did tweek the recipe a bit though.  I did not use cloves and I used 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. allspice and 2 tsps. ginger.  This gave them a little more flavor, in my opinion.

Where do I begin...at first the dough would not stay together so I added 2tbsp of butter.  I was really excited after that because the dough was perfect.  The first batch came out and I tried one...not so good.  It was soft and chewy but it lacked flavor.  You need to keep adding spices until you get it right.  Also the recipe says that it yields 36, I made 27.

Great recipe. To prevent from becoming hard do not over cook. This recipe requires very little cooking time. Be sure to roll these out to at least a 1/4 inch or else they will not be chewy.

I had never attempted gingerbread cookies before. This recipie turned out to be great. I couldn't keep my two year old away from them. I did have some trouble with rolling them out and cutting them though. I've never done anything like that before so I had to figure out the hard way how to flour it enough and treat it more like bread dough. But they were wonderful!

I wanted to make my own gingerbread cookies along with my kids and I like them "soft". So came across this recipe! 

I did follow the directions, except for the chilling part. It was late in the evening when I started the preparing the dough. And after the dough was complete...It seemed a bit wet to be dough. So then not reading #3 in the directions before starting. I realized I had to chill it for a few hours. 

Hoping that after chilling it, It would firm up more, but the next day the consistency was the same. 
I don't know if chilling it longer then what the recipe called for had an effect. But I ended up adding more flour (wheat) that is. Also don't know if using the wheat flour made a difference either.

Anyway I added the wheat flour to it. Would say a cup more and then rolled it out. I thought if they don't come out, then oh well. At least the kids got to decorate..lol 

By my surprise!!! These cookies came out awesome! I was really impressed. I was so concerned that they would taste like nothing but flour. Well they did NOT! They were soft, just as the recipe says! and yummy! I will use this recipe again.

I loved this recipe. After reading all the reviews, I followed the recipe exactly. I found out through the many jobs I have worked in, that you have to let the dough warm to room temperature, after it's been refrigerated for the 3 hrs. It's much easier to roll out that way, no need for wax paper. There's no eggs in the recipe, so no worries on bacteria. I also brushed the tops with honey for an added sweetness. WILL TOTALLY BAKE AGAIN AND AGAIN.

This was the simplest most easy recipethat I have ever made. It was not tough toroll out it was alittle sticky but I just added alittle more flour. My first batchI used Wholewheatflour and I do not reccomened that because they came out with no flavour at all they were very floury and taste less. so I am doing another batch right now. I used regular flour and added vanilla as well. I upped the amount of PUMPKIN SPICE that I used  and added 1/2 cup butter as well.The dough this time was easier to roll not tough at all which is surprising so much that people were complaining about this. this time i decreased the amount of molasses I hope this helps the taste.  they are very fragile when they come out of the oven so you have to be careful.  I cooked them for 6 minutes the first time but this time i will try 7 or maybe even 8.I'm sure everyone will enjoy. you just have to test out the amount of spice to your liking.Here comes the test!They look great and taste great! oh i got it right this time they are fantastic! i will use this reciepe all the time. putting icing on them and decorating them to your liking will help make them alittle sweeter. gingerbread cookies are not supposed to be sweet! A huge winner with me and a keeper for sure 5BIGSTARS!

Very good. The dough is tough though. I used about 1/2 a cup less flour, and added as I needed to where it wasn't as sticky. It was a good method to control the toughness. I also doubled the spice measurements, I liked it better than what the recipe calls for. Really love these cookies though!

The alternating reviews going from one star to four stars over and over had me intrigued enough to try this recipe.  I upped the health quotient and the flavor by using some of the tips in past reviews.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour 1/2 all-purpose flour, about 1/4 c brown sugar and 1/4 c Splenda, I only had blackstrap molasses (good source of iron!), and I doubled all the spices except cloves.  My cookies are soft and de-e-e-e-elicious!  I had frozen some, and I just ate one straight out of the freezer - they're even good (and still soft!) that way!

Outstanding recipe.  If you are looking for a soft gingerbread cookie you must try this one.  Just made it for the first time, followed the recipe exactly, I have no idea why some others reported problems with the texture or dough consistency.  Use soft (NOT melted butter), measure flour accurately and mix completely in your mixer and they turned out exactly as I thought.

This recipe was excellent!  Very tasteful even without the frosting (of course they are excellent with frosting too!).  My husband who does not like gingerbread cookies actually liked these.  My son and his friends all loved them too!  The cookies aren't that sweet (which is exactly the way our family like) but very flavorful, soft and moist.  The only changes I made were adding 1.5x of ginger than stated.  Dough was bit hard to work with, but it is worth it!!!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe... this will be our Christmas trandition :-)

These are the first gingerbread cookies I've baked, and I was very pleased with the results. The dough was a little difficult to work with, and I found it had to be very cold or it would soften too much and not be easy to cut out.

Some of my batches turned out a little crispy so I had to watch the baking time very carefully, or they would over cook. There is a fine line between soft and crunchy with these cookies!

The cookies turned out nice when baked properly, though. Nice, soft texture and good flavor. They didn't puff too much and retained their shape very well. We decorated using a butter cream icing and they tasted great! I'm making them again for our Christmas party this weekend.

These cookies looked good, they smelled good. The dough was perfect, and rolled easily. The problem was the taste. They were bland, and almost bread like in texture. Not tasty at all.

These were the easiest and most delicious gingerbread cookies ever.  So soft...I love soft cookies and the fact I did not have to roll out the dough and use those annoying cookie cutters was the best part.  My dough was super sticky so I did not roll the cookies in my hand.  I used a cookie scoop and they came out just fine!

On the plus side, the puffiness of the cookie was very cute, and the dough 
is relatively easy to work with (for this beginner cookie-baker).  A nice plus
is that these cookies seem to be (relatively) low calorie.  However, they are
not as flavorful as other gingerbread recipes.

Great recipe!  Came out well this Christmas.  I varied the thickness and cooking times a bit, which resulted in a good mix of thin and thick, softer and crispier, cookies.  Would definitely recommend!

The worst cookie recipe I have ever made.
1/8 cup of butter is a bad idea. A scant 2 tablespoons of butter makes a dry crumbly mess. I added some moisture to get the crumbs to hold together. I used apple juice. I do not recommend this recipe at all.

My cookies turned out perfect! The dough was dry at first, but it was perfectly moist after it chilled for the three hours. This is a great recipe! I will be using it again!

Either the recipe is wrong (1/8C of butter for 3 1/4C flour??) or it is meant to make decorative, not edible gingerbread.

Very disappointing cookies. Very bland taste and tough dough that crumbles easily. I have had success with so many baking recipes on this site and this was very first true let down. I combed through several reviews and decided to give it a shot because so many people have rated this recipe, usually this is a safe bet but not in this case. Tthe texture is nice but the it has nothing else going for it. As said already by me and others, very bland and not at all sweet tasting.

We made these cookies tonight, and they turned out AMAZING. Very easy to prepare the dough. They taste like what a gingerbread should taste like.   For the folks who reviewed that the dough was to sticky, they probably didn't refrigerate it long enough. We prepared the dough last night and refrigerated over night and it was not sticky or goopy at all!   Fantastic recipe Sal! Thank you for sharing!

Wonderful gingerbread cookie. Just like I remember from when I was little. Perfect flavor and great for decorating. Did make a few suggested changes. I used a half a cup of butter flavored shortening rather than butter, baking powder, not soda, and a half cup of brown sugar. I'm a big fan of this cookie, thank you for posting it and thank you to others who cooked it before me for helping me make it better!

I've never been a lover of Gingerbread. I love to bake! Asked my coworkers what cookies they wanted, and one was Gingerbread! I voted soft gingerbread because I like soft cookies! I had never made gingerbread before so I took on the challenge. Yes the dough was dry, but no more dry then any rolled sugar cookie or sprtiz cookie. You just have to knead it a little in your hands and your good to go! I have already been asked by many people in the office for this recipe, and asked to make it again!

they just need to be sweeter but these are great - soft and tasty.  Added more spice as suggested by one reviewer.  The dough was hard to work with but manageable. This is the recipe I will use every Christmas.

This is a good standard gingerbread recipe. People have to remember that molasses based cookie dough isn't the easiest dough to work with.

After following the recipe exactly and cooling the so called dough for almost 3.5 hours it was crumbly and no where near ready to be rolled.  I added almost another cup of water before it became rollable... all in all they tasted horrible and took way to long to make- this is not a good recipe at all!

I made these cookies with my daughter and they turned out perfect! I did use the tip off another review to roll the dough between two sheets of wax paper with a little flour sprinkled on the paper. It was so easy and the cookies are delicious!!! We also had fun making some x-mas ornaments out of some of the cookies. We just cooked those a little longer.

This were pretty yummy, but I had to add an additional 1/4 cup of flour to the mix and use lots of flour on the countertop and dough to cut out cookies.  Also, I had to make the cookies pretty thick and cook them for only 7 minutes to get a soft cookie.  Otherwise, they were crispy as soon as they cooled.  You can microwave them though and they will be soft again!

I agree these so delicious and are low in fat and yummy.  I made them as little cookies.  I also put 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 white, and added 6 egg beaters.  Then, my children had a tea party with them!  Sooo good.  I bet you could add a little more flour to make them cut outs.

These cookies were pretty good and baked up perfectly. I omitted the cloves, added more of the other spices and upped the molassas to 1 c. I also rolled out between waxed paper and had no issues with it sticking. This is a good mild tasting cookie, good for people who don't like to spicey of a flavor (like kids).

I am sure the rating says it all. But in case it doesn't this is a awsome recipe. I originally tried it for the calorie values and i do like a gingerbread with a bit of bite so read the reviews and added a little more sugar and spices oh and instead of br. sugar I used spenda br. sugar (it worked well) and I didnt have any butter so I used becel oil and it also worked well.I really dont know what the people that said it was hard to work with were talking about it was extremly easyu to work with also if you dont like the taste maybe you used yucky cooking molasses in it fancy taste much better

These were definately the best gingerbread cookies ever!  I made them over a week ago, and they are still very soft and delicious.  The taste is very mild which makes them very good.  I pressed them into a gingerbread men mold and baked them in that, and they were excellent.  Definately a keeper!  Thank you!  Yum!!!

They were great! I've never made gingerbread cookies before and so I was a little nervous. The recipe was really simple and they tasted great!

These were puffy and soft.  I added a little more spice to suit my taste.  The dough rolled out well.  I will make them again!

This is an awesome recipe! I've made 2 batches already this week and my kids eat them almost as fast as I can get them out of the oven! Very quick and easy to make with a great soft appealing texture and yummy taste!

The dough comes out dry and crumbly. I have added 1/3 cup more water and 1/3 cup more molasses and I'm hoping I can save the batch.

I was looking for a soft gingerbread man cookie recipe and decided to go with this  even though some had given it poor ratings. Taking these low ratings into consideration, I made these cookies exactly as indicated using leveled measurements on the ingredients. The flavor and sweetness level were mild but not bland--actually--just perfect for my taste buds, epecially since the icing would kick the sugar rush another notch. The important element for me was SOFT and I certainly got that. It was a beautiful thing. Know that I am not an "expert" baker/cook and I have a habit of altering recipes so I was glad when I stuck to the recipe on this one and the instructions were not complicated. I found it much easier, as others had recommended, to roll it in between two sheets of parchment paper. I also cut the shapes in place, so I just removed the excess dough and rolled out a new ball. As for time, I have a convection oven and it came out perfectly at 6 minutes on convec bake at  my elevation of 6200 ft abve sea level. I will definitely use this agiain!

This recipe is pretty good. They do come out soft. Don't over cook or they do get stiff and stale like. It a was very kneadable dough. The finished product I think needs a bit more butter and spices in taste.

This is a great recipe! This is the second year in a row I'm using it. If you want them to be soft, make sure not to roll your dough too thin.

I've been looking for a new recipe to try this Fall and my husband has been on my case about trying Gingerbread this year. I have never made it until last night. These cookies are to die for. I did change the recipe a little. When mixing the dough, I added 1 or 2 tablespoon of water to make the dough softer and easier to roll, I also adjusted the flour. I took the 1/4 cup out and just used 3 cups. They didn't taste floury at all and they were soft and didn't break easily either. This'll be my come to Fall recipe for now on.

I consider this recipe for healthy low fat cookies but I don't think I will come back to this one anytime soon.

I doubled the butter and added oil to the dough. The cookies were soft when oven fresh but became hard to chew on after cooling. My dad can only eat the cookie w/ a warm glass of milk to soften it up.

I cannot understand how people said these cookies tasted like flour or really bland... I had no issue with these at all. Very easy to make, very easy to roll just a little problem with them sticking. I only baked them 6 mins and they came out perfect, they tasted great without anything on it but since I am taking them to a party I wanted to decorate them and I used the decorators icing from this site. I have to stop eating them or i will have none for the party!

This was the worst ever. I followed the directions exactly and the dough came out sticky and soft, even after I had refrigerated it. I was really disappointed because I couldn't cut out Gingerbread men, and now I'll have to bring something else to the party. :(

These gingerbread cookies are fabulous! Takes a little patience and time with the refriderating and rolling out the dough. Takes me back when I rolled out biscuits with my Mom. They are soft and delicious cookies.

This was a pretty good recipe, the dough was pretty hard to work with the first few rolls, but after that it was fine. The bottoms of mine were a little hard after only 8 minutes, I had no problems with texture. Also, I only came out with 16 cookies...

I've made this recipe a few times now for Christmas.  It has a great flavor and texture.  I didn't find it any more difficult to make than any other cookie that you have to roll out.  I had no problems with the dough drying out at all.

these "cookies" are bland and lifeless and are more like a bread than a cookie. calling them dense would be a serious understatement, these are the thickest, hardest cookies iver ever made. though it said it made 36, i only got about 12 out of it. the dough was hard as a rock and nearly impossible to roll out. my brothers and sisters wont eat them, and my parents even winced when they tried them. but then again, they do make nice tree ornaments.

These had NO flavor, and when put into the oven transformed into little pieces of soft, mushy pieces of bread.

These cookies seemed more like a bread in cookie form. They were not very sweet at all. I think they are good if you know this ahead of time, but don't be expecting much of a cookie. They were incredibly soft, which is one thing toward them. But, I would have liked them better with more sugar, and less molassas.

I have shared the cookies with my family and friends.  All have asked for the recipe.  I just love this gingerbread cookie!  I found that if it was too dry, adding a little water helped.  I also found that rolling the dough when it was just mixed helped to prevent it from drying out and made it easier to roll.  A friend drizzled dark chocolate on top.  The cookie has a pleasently mild taste, not overpowering like some other cookies I've tried.

I wanted a soft gingerbread cookie and saw the good ratings so I tried it today. I followed the recipe and yet my dough came out so dry. I can't even roll it out. Don't know what I did wrong. I'll try it one more time.

Converted to metric as I am in UK & was then worried about the ammount of molasses as it was a lot! They did taste very much of this when I tried the finished product. Had to add more flour as the mixture was too sticky. Could definitely use a lot more spice - added almost 3 times the ammount of ginger but couldn't taste it.
Having read the comments of others I would definitely try again & change it round a bit more by adding more ginger & substituting some of the molasses for hiney or golden syrup. However would try it again as it was easy once I'd worked it out!!

pretty good. I was a little worried about the measurements when I was mixing it 'cause it seemed really dry; I ended up using my hands to mix it.  It came out perfect though, although it definitely needs more spices - I doubled everything and added cardamom, and I think it could still use a bit more

If you are expecting an easy bake as an intermediate home Baker, immediately go search for a new recipe. If you follow this recipe and reduce the flour it still turns out a dense pasty bake.  I make macrons from scratch, ginger bread is not rocket science and mine turned out horrible.  If I were to make this again, no more than 1 cup of flour and I definitely won't chill the dough. Then maybe the extra flour used for rolling would make sense. Honestly go find a better recipe

I want to begin by saying that I am an avid baker. These cookies were very disappointing to me however. I decided to give it a try despite the numerous bad reviews, but I regret this. The cookies are very soft which is about the only positive thing I can say about them. They are so bland and have almost no flavor. I would recommend looking for another recipe.

GREAT RECIPE! I make gingerbread cookies every year for the family to decorate and i found this one 4 years ago and have used it ever since. I love the soft texture and warmth of the spices. You could sub out gingerbread spice since it is all of the spices mixed together. It only slightly changes the flavor because you lose the control of the amounts you add....

I whipped up the dough this evening, will bake tomorrow.  So far, those who have complained about an unsweet, unflavorful or dry dough had to have done something wrong.  Mine is very moist and DEFINITELY sweet enough and tastes just like a gingerbread cookie should.  I laid out a long piece of plastic wrap on my counter, put half of the dough on it in a "fat log" folded the plastic on top of it and rolled the dough into an oval/rectangle into the appx thickness I want.  The plastic wrap easily peeled off if I did it slowly, so I am sure I won't have a problem when it is cold.  Looking forward to cutting and baking tomorrow and leaving a baking rating!

This gingerbread cookie recipe was very easy to prepare, i only cooled it in the fridge for two hours, and the dough was very easy to role out and work with, even my 4 year old son was able to role it out for me sprinkle little of flour and cut out fun shapes.
I would recommend to double check the type of flour used, mine was succesfull, all purpose flour.

Good luck to you, i already advised this recipe to my baking siblings...

Ok, made these today and learned a few things.  I don't like using parchment or plastic wrap with these; the dough is still too sticky.  I just used flour as needed.  

I like the mild flavor; I don't need to be knocked off my feet with overwhelming spice.  

You MAY want to reduce cooking time a smidge and roll the dough a smidge thicker than called for, to help for a softer cookie.  I have some I know I rolled too thin, so they will be crunchy cookies.  Still, the taste is appealing, so even crunchy they'll be good with a glass of milk.  

I think they're fine.  Personally, I don't think they'll win awards for a gourmet cookie. but they are a tasty cookie just the same.  May try a different recipe next time to compare results, but these will do for my Christmas table for this year.

I thought these were fine. Not as sweet as some gingerbread cookies but certainly soft and good gingerbread flavor. As with any cut out cookie it is very important to chill the dough. That is key. I did use a bit of flour each time I rolled out some dough. The dough would be too sticky without that. I made a simple vanilla icing with butter and a bit of milk.

I didn't have allspice, so I added a little extra cinnamon and cloves and a pinch of nutmeg.

Cookies are fantastic! Dough was easy to roll out with the floured surface. They stayed soft after baking. The flavor could be stronger, but they are super delicious. And, thankfully, not too sweet. Gingerbread should not be super sweet! :)

Dough was too dry as written.  I doubled the water & added another 1/4 cup of butter.  Tasted great & fund to decorate.

I made these cookies today, and the are by far the worst cookies ever. They should be called dry salty molasses cookies. I thought it was odd to have that much molasses in this recipe, is it an error? Save yourself the effort to roll it out, click next when you see this recipe

I made a few changes to this recipe: 
1) used Snow White lard rather than butter as butter is wicked expensive
2) used almost 90% molasses and the remainder was honey

The cookies that came out of my over were soft and chewy and have become my very favourite cookie as I love soft and chewy!  However; I was not aiming for just soft and chewy, I wanted that spice flavour and more of the warm scent from the cloves and cinnamon to come through the cookie. This cookie is just a cookie. Nothing really gingerbread tasting to me. 

When I make this cookie again, I will be doubling the values for the ginger, cinnamon, clove and all spice.

This is a very good gingerbread dough recipe. These are *not* 'ginger cookies'. If you are expecting a stand-alone cookie (unfrosted), you will be disappointed. These make a great base for typical frosted Christmas gingerbread cookies or houses, but they need that frosting as they are really a molasses cookie. It's worth using blackstrap molasses and dark brown sugar, and they do puff slightly, so roll them no more than 1/4in (or even 3/16) if you plan to do any flood frosting.

I enjoyed these cookies, but the next time I make them I'll add a little more of the cloves and ginger, and make sure they're kept in an airtight  container as they can dry out very quickly.  Will be making them again!

Good cookie! But I did add more brown sugar and more spices. I didn't measure when I added more, just eyeballed. My main comment would be that this makes a small amount of dough. If you need to bake a lot of cookies to share with family coming over for Christmas or to give away to neighbors you need to double the recipe maybe?  Just my thoughts.

Ok one the amount of flour the you list  needs to be fixed instead of saying 3  1/4 cups of flour just say 3/4 cup of flour and instead of 1/8 of cup of butter just say 2 tablespoons a lot easier to read, because I wasted almost all of my molasses and alot of ingredients as well. Plus for some reason this did not make that much like it's suppose to I was expecting more but only got like a dozen and a half so kinda disappointed there. Plus I had to grease my cookie sheets to be able to get them off of them without a struggle. I think next year I will find a different recipe to make.

The dough was crumbling and hard to roll let alone cut shapes.  Stuck it all back in the bowl and added 1/2 cup of sugar and a little bit of water and two more table spoons of butter as other had suggested and the dough turned out way better and easier to work with.  It also tasted great

It's ok, but needs to be tweaked a bit. They came out fairly bland. I'd throw in more ginger, cinnomon, and a bit of salt if I ever make it again. The cookies came out hard around the edges. They probably need to be in the oven a little less than 8 minutes.

The dough was crumbly and dry- it wouldn't mix all the way. Once I remedied that, I baked them just as cookies- not rolling them out or using cutters. The outside texture was crispy and crumbly looking- the inside was moist and soft. The taste was okay- not the best in my opinion.

Dough was  very crumbly wouldn't pack at all. I added equal parts of molasses and water to the dough until it would and baked  without fridge time. They baked well and  have a wonderful flavor but are to fussy to make a second time .

I had to make too many changes to get the desired product. Good base recipe, definitely flexible, but also quite lacking (especially if you're in the market for a spicier cookie). 

A lot of the issues that people are experiencing can be remedied with some baking savvy: to avoid getting crumbly or sandy cookies, cream the butter and sugar together before adding the other wet ingredients; gradually incorporate the dry ingredients in small amounts; wrap the cookie dough in clear plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for at least 1-2 hours and work with it later; depending on the size of the cookies, shave 1-2 (or more) minutes off of the baking time for a softer, chewier cookie. 

(And I suggest adding much more ginger and cinnamon; I love a spicier cookie, so I just eyeball the amounts of spices I throw in there.)

Only I could take a recipe everyone else says was dry and crumbling and have the exact opposite result! I did double the spices like others suggested. Also I was just short of the ¾ cup molasses so I added buckwheat honey to make up the difference (maybe 3tbsp). I don't know if that made the difference but the dough ended up being perfect for my cookie press. I'm waiting for them to cool now and then I'm going to drizzle them with an orange juice and powdered sugar glaze. They are about the consistency of brownie bites.

The recipe says to- leave the dough in a bowl to chill for 3+ hours, it became cement! Special thanks to "SUGARPLUMSCOOKIES" for offering the wax paper trick and it doesn't hurt to lightly flour each side too! Next time I'll have the frosting ready. I picked scottie dogs, tree & heart for my brand of holiday cheer!

I normally read reviews before trying a new recipe.... oops!  Really bad tasting cookies.  I make gingerbread cookies every year with my 3 kids and they all agreed... no taste, not sweet and bad consistency.  Funny faces as they tried them.  I'll go back to my old recipe :)

This is an excellent recipe! Personally, I don't use a cookie cutter. I simply roll some dough into a ball, roll it in sugar, place on a cookie sheet and press my thumb into the center. Wonderful molasses cookies. 
Also...If you place the warm cookies in an air tight container, they will not get hard.

I did not care for this recipe. I am a baker and I followed the recipe to a tee. I was looking for a chewy cookie, unlike the ones I have made in years gone by. Dough was hard to roll, stiff, not pliable at all. Not sure what happened….all ingredients were fresh as well.

I followed this recipe to a T but I left them in the fridge overnight and brought them out in the morning. I didn't try to roll them out for several hours and when I did, I didn't use ANY flour. They rolled out perfectly!!!!! I would definitely make these again!!

Trying this recipe.... Let it chill for 24 hrs because 3 hrs did nothing, but 24 hrs didn't do jack either. This is almost like soup and I followed the recipe EXACTLY! I bake all the time and never had problems like this. Itheres no way I can roll this dough out, I'd be lucky to be able to make drop cookies!!!

These gingerbread cookies were kid friendly, tasted good, and were definitely soft - they didn't get crunchy Yay!  I just had to find my own frosting recipe.  They are not strong flavored, so those of you who don't want a spicy cookie these are great.

This is the best basic soft gingerbread recipe out there. Very simple directions, I refrigerate my dough about 2 hours and it works better. I also like a stronger ginger/spice flavor, so I add more ginger and cloves to the recipe and it helps as this one is very mild made according to the recipe. I love this recipe though and so do everyone I make them for.

They were soft as the title suggested but I was disappointed in the flavor.  I won't make these again.

Great recipe! I didn't alter a thing and enjoyed the mild flavor of the cookies. Add a bit of royal icing as decoration and you'll have all the sweetness you need. The dough will be crumbly. Just be firm with it! Get your hands in there, use plenty of flour on your work surface, and roll until smooth. The cookies still had their softness on day 4, which is a win in my book!

These did not work out! I had to add about 1/2 cup more water to the dough to make it stick together, and when I baked them (for 8 min.) they all got huge! Since they were so big they weren't done in the middle, so they didn't taste very good. They may have turned out better if I had baked them longer, but I would not make these again.

This was a GREAT recipe and easy to follow, which we followed as written.  The spices were yummy and it tastes just like gingerbread cookies should taste!  The dough was sticky so use flour liberally when rolling them out, that helped a lot. We plan on making them again!

They are not sweet, but they look great! The dough was not as hard as some said to roll out, at least I didn't have trouble. But, they are the best tasting in the whole world.

I don't recommend this recipe to anyone. I wouldn't even give these cookies to neighbors I didn't like. The only thing I could taste when putting them in my mouth was molasses and allspice. They were so bland, icing didn't do them justice. I didn't even finish making them.

Wow! These are amazing cookies.  I am not a gingerbread fan at all and yet I loved these cookies.  I love that they are soft and not too spicy.  Really wonderful with some frosting on top.  Rolling out was a pain, but I found that the longer it chilled, the easier it was.  Next time I make these I will leaves them in the fridge for at least 6 hours.

Best gingerbread ever!  Soft and sooo good.  I made them at Christmas and even people who say they don't like gingerbread loved these!
