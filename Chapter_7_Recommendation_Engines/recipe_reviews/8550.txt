This sauce is the best sweet and sour I have come across! As I was short on time, I skipped making the meatballs and just browned the meat and made a stirfry with the sauce. Adding any array of your favourite veggies just makes it that much better - 5 stars! Edit - I have now made this a bunch of times and I found doing boneless skinless chicken breasts pieces in place of the meatballs is the winner!

This was fantastic - better than I thought it would turn out. Tasted like something you'd get in a restaurant. I did have some trouble with the consistency of the meat after i added the bread, egg and seasonings.  It was just too moist and I thought it would fall apart when put in the sauce. I think that was my fault though as I don't know if I had the full amount of chicken that the recipe called for and it had been in the freezer and was a little watery. But I fixed that problem by adding some breadcrums and putting the meatballs in the oven set at a very low temp for a little while and let them dry out and firm up and they turned out wonderful. I didn't have any garlic powder so I used Mrs. Dash's garlic seasoning. I don't know if this made much difference but I thought the meatballs were perfectly seasoned. Also next time I make this (and there will be a next time!!) I think I will cut down on the vinegar a bit - a little to vinegary for my taste. I had to add some more brown sugar to balance it out. But all in all a very tasty dish!!

This is the best sweet and sour sauce recipe I've found. Instead of meatballs, I make a stir fry with cut up chicken. It's easier and faster.

This was wonderful.  I made a few modifications to the overall recipe but left the sauce ingredients as is.  Rather than making meatballs I just added cut up boneless, skinless chicken thighs to the sauce at the same time you would add the meatballs.  I also didn't use instant rice but made jasmine rice and then served the sauce and chicken over it.  I will definitely make this again.

I really liked the flavor of this recipe, but I had a couple of issues with its particulars. For one, the recipe calls for "instant rice" to be used, but doesn't really specify. Most packages labeled "instant rice" actually take more than five minutes to cook (as the recipe suggests) - what it should call for is Minute rice - which cooks faster. Also, the meatballs did not hold together very well. Next time, I think I'll skip the milk the just add the bread into the mixture on its own. And suggest not chopping the fruits and vegetables so small. I at least like it better with bigger chunks of onion, pepper and pineapple - it seems to be more flavorful.

What a great recipe!  I added the Mango & Pork fried rice from allrecipe.com to this one and it was WONDERFUL!  We loved it!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

If you are craving sweet and sour chicken/pork, this comes close, and its not deep fried, so it's a win win! Made it for dinner last night and was so happy with the results! Used brown rice instead of instant to add a little more nutritional value...This receipe is definately a keeper! Yea!!! :)

I LOVED this recipe.  It was totally different from anything I normally make.  I followed the recipe as is except I used ground turkey, wheat bread & served it over egg noddles.  I used my Pampered Chopper for the onions & peppers & my mini electric chopper for the carrot & zuccini & had none of the problems I've read about with uncooked veggies.  I did have a ton of sauce leftover so next time around I'll double up on meatball ingrediants so I have more leftovers. It was delicious, I emailed it to all my friends.

I left out the zucchini & green pepper as I didn't have any and added a little more garlic powder (I love garlic!).  I used a scoop to form the meatballs.  I used a full pound of ground chicken so it made a few more meatballs--which is good in a house full of meat-lovers!  The sauce seemed a little watery to me & I would probably cut down on the ketchup a little b/c I tasted it more than I would have liked.  It was pretty simple to prepare even though the list of ingredients can look overwhelming.  It was very good & I will make again.

Easy flavor that the whole family loved.  I didn't have pineapple so I added honey for the sweetness but I don't think it really needed it.  Will definitely make again w/ the p/a.

Used the sauce in the recipe as a slow cooker recipe.  The family liked it very much.  I just mixed the sauce ingredients and poured it over chicken breasts in a slow cooker and let it sit for 8 hours.  Very easy.

Loved this recipe.  Made a few simple changes. I included half the amount of vinegar.  Added 1/8th tsp cayenne..it wouldn't hurt to add more.  And instead of garlic  powder for the meatballs, I crushed one large clove of garlic which gave the meal the perfect amount of garlicky flavour.

This is seriously lacking SOMETIHNG. I let the sauce simmer for a while and then added (homemade) frozen meatballs and when I tasted the sauce, I was very disappointed. I added 1/4 cup soy sauce and then a few dashes of hot sauce, and it was edible. My 3 y/o loved it, but he dips waffles in ranch dressing, what does he know. Took a ton of tabasco to make these tasty for me. Will not make again.

I made this recipe for the sauce and didn't like it at all. I'm looking for a good weet and sour sauce and this is just not it. It doesn't taste terrible just not what I was looking for and not that good.

I would have rated this recipe higher, but I had a problem with the instant rice, it was mushy after sitting for a bit (I needed to keep the dish on warm for a little while). I will try it again with a regular 20 min. white rice. Just add before cooking the meatballs.

This recipe was excellent.  A nice change from the "restaurant style" sweet and sour sauce I usually make. I made the recipe almost as listed, I cooked the rice separately instead of using instant rice, and  I used 20 oz. ground chicken instead of the 12 oz. the recipe called for.  The meat mixture was still very gooey when I formed the meatballs, but after they cooked they were perfect.  Excellent flavor, everyone loved it.

I'm so glad this site has reviews because I knew what to expect. I too thought that the chicken mixture was runny so I formed meatballs and put them in a pan and baked @ 375 for 25 minutes. Then I let them simmer in the sauce for 10 minutes while the rice was cooking. I let the sauce simmer the whole time. Before stirring in the rice I removed the meatballs and thickened the sauce a little with some cornstarch and water. All in all it turned out very tasty. I think it would be great with cubed chicken breast also but I eat so much of them already that the meatballs are a nice way to change it up! :)

I have made this twice following the basic recipe using plum sauce instead of pineapple (since I didn't have any in the cupboard). This is a huge hit served with the kids, and I'm partial to it too!

This was not good at all.  I followed the directions exactly, but the cooking time should be longer, as the sauce was still runny and the vegetables were uncooked..  I didn't like the sauce, and I thought it didn't taste right.  I tried it for dinner, and I hoped that it was one of those dishes that would taste better the next day.  It didn't.  I'll keep looking for a good meatball recipe.

Great taste, but rice/sauce to meatball ratio was off.  A little too much rice.

Excellent! I made this for the first time last night. It was absolutely delicious. I did make a few changes as well. I used whole grain bread instead of white bread and I added a few tablespoons of panko bread crumbs as well. I used a red pepper instead of a green (that's all I had in my fridge). I used a tad bit less of the vinegar and ketchup and a bit more of the pineapple and it's juices. I baked the meatballs first, then added them to the sauce and simmered on very low for about 30 minutes. I used the "boil in a bag" white rice that I had cooked in the microwave and served it over that. A+

this recipe had very good sauce.  i made it for my family and they all thought it tasted just like the sweet and sour sauce from a restaurant!  I found that the carrots didnt cook quite all the way, so I'll cut them thinner and put them in before the onions and bell pepper next time.  i also used chunks of chicken instead of the meatballs like someone suggested and it turned out great!

I was very skeptic at first, but must say that it was delicious, my husband and three year old kept raving about it. It is a keeper. i little bit changed it, I add one cup of pinaple juice because I did not have crushed on. Added more sugar and less of vinegar. I also did not have zuchini, so I put it the meat half of cucumber and some wheat germs. As noted in one review I also baked it in oven for about 10 minutes and then added to the sauce and cooked it another 20 minutes. Over rice it was great. Thanks.

I made this recipe for my son who is very picky and doesn't like veggies.  It was a huge hit!  I did add more garlic b/c we like a lot of garlic and I made the rice on the side.  Thank you!

This recipe was a big success for my husband and extremely picky son.  The sauce flavor was tangy but sweet and blended well with the chicken meatballs, as well as the rice.  This time, I stuck to the recipe directions but I may try others' suggestions next time, using different cuts of meat and maybe even try seasoning the meatballs before cooking them in the sauce.

This recipe was really nice, although I didn't add the rice to the sauce at the end. I microwaved some Jasmine rice and then poured the meatballs and sauce over the rice. It was delicious....Thanks Charlene for the recipe.

What a great way to pack in the veggies! No one realized there was zucchini in the chickenballs. The mixture was already very liquidy so I left out the milk. I also used crushed garlic rather than garlic powder for greater flavor. The sauce was delicious but overly soupy. Next time I'd drain the pineapple. To make this healthier yet, I prepared brown rice and ladled the meatballs over the rice.

i saved this recipe, but because it was a decent base, not because it's a great recipe as is. the sauce was bland, so i added garlic, ginger, and soy sauce to it. the meatballs are also bland, so they got some chopped garlic, ginger, lemon pepper, and hoisin sauce. instant/minute rice is inedible, so i served it over baked brown rice. my granddaughter loved it, but if i make it again, i will probably make more adjustments to the sauce and add some more vegetables.

Really yummy! I make my own chicken balls, not following the recipe but the sauce is great! I would double the chicken mixture because otherwise it's mostly sauce. Very yummy and alot of fun to throw together. Thanks!

Sauce was too soupy and I had to add one whole cup of bread crumbs to the meatballs to get them to form, thus making them a little bland.

The recipe was pretty good. The meatballs were great! I would agree that the veggies would have been better in large chunks. For those unfamiliar with ground chicken & turkey, they tend to be very sloppy(mushy)initially but firm right up once cooked. Just make them as close as you can to a ball and drop into the sauce. A good dish to add some variety to the weekly meal. I would recommend using chunks of pineapple as well, I think that would have elevated the dish a little more. I made rice separately since we like to adjust sauce individually.

I love love love this recipe. It is so good and easy. I omitted some things to make it a tad healthier. Got rid of the ketchup and brown sugar, added some honey to sweeten, replaced white bread with wheat and used egg whites when forming the meatballs.

I made this tonight and everyone loved it.  Even my really picky kids.  The only thing I did different was leave out the pepper as no one really likes them.  Next time I will use a little less rice. I think even using only 1 3/4 cups would leave more yummy sauce.

Please note that the rating is for how I made it, not how the recipe is written. I made some important changes to the meatballs. My instincts told me they would be too wet as written and fall apart, so I: omitted milk, chopped up the bread in the food processor to make crumbs and added crumbs to meat mix, salted the zucchini and let it sit for about 20 minutes, then wrung out the excess liquid, reduced salt in meat mix to offset salt in zucchini.

Turned out delicious. The chicken mixture was a little too watery but I let it sit a while and then wet my hands every so often making the balls. I skipped the pineapple, only because I didn’t have any and it was still delicious. I will definitely make it again but maybe next time I will also sauté a jalapeño pepper together with the onion mixture just to give it a little spicy kick.

The taste is great, but be careful when adding the eggs. I found that this recipe calls for too much egg, which made the meatball mixture runny. I would cut down on egg at least by half.

This is pretty good. I think it's a little bit too sweet - which I why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  The only changes I made were to add cooked long-grain rice instead of instant and I used wheat bread because I don't use white.  As lots of others noted, the sauce is the best part.  If I didn't need to make soft foods for my husband (due to dental issues) I wouldn't bother with the meatballs but they do go well with the sauce. The meatball mix is a bit soggy but it you put in the fridge for 15-20 minutes, it firms up nicely.

This was so good!  I was a little wary to cook ground meat in liquid, so I cooked the meatballs in the oven for about 10 minutes, then let them simmer for 30 in the liquid.  They turned out perfect.  I also had the same trouble as someone else with the rice - it definitely takes more than 5 minutes.  I used brown instant rice and it took nearly 20 minutes.  It took quite a while to cook everything, but it was well worth the wait!

Wow.  Incredible recipe!

I made a couple of adjustments.  First, I used frozen chicken meatballs.  Second, I only had pineapple chunks on hand and they worked really well.

My husband commented that this dish tasted like we ordered it from a Chinese restaurant.  It was delicious!

Made this strictly for the sweet and sour sauce.  I enjoyed it, my husband did not, that's why I'm giving it three stars.  It was easy to make and made the house smell great but it lacked something in consistancy.  It needed to be a little thicker and gooey-ier like most restuarant sweet and sour.  This had the consistancy of tomato sauce.  It still tasted okay but nothing extra special.

WOW! I must admit, I didn't make the meatballs, but when I have more time, I will surely do so. Tonight it was the wonderful sauce that dressed up store-bought frozen meatballs. As pineapple doesn't always agree with me, I opted to use applesauce instead. Everyone loved them! Can't wait to make these again!

I can't say enough good things about this recipe...I can't wait to make them again!  I added a dash or two of chinese five spice and baked the meatballs in the oven while I prepared the sauce and then tossed it all together and served it over jasmine rice!  FANTASTIC!

I did not care for this. The consistency of the meat balls was off and I did not like the sauce. I did not modify th recipe at all. Even my husband, who eats everything did not care for it. I will not be making this again!

This was a great recipe for sweet-n-sour sauce and an ok recipe for meatballs. It just didn't go together. Next time I would much rather stir-fry some chicken or even shrimp and just make the sauce by itself. The meatballs were too mushy, and the bread/milk stuff made them taste like they had mushy spots in them. I even browned them first in a pan, then added to the sauce. I made the mistake of covering the pan to cook the meatballs, which then in turn thinned out the sauce a lot. Make the sauce, skip the meatballs. I did however like the idea of hiding the zucchini in them, and might try that the next time I make Swedish meatballs.
