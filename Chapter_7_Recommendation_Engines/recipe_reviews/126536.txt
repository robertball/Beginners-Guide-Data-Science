I've never made cheesecake from scratch until now, and it was surprisingly easy! It turned out great, and everyone was giving compliments. I skipped the maraschino cherries, and just used orange slices, mandarin oranges, and pineapple slices. Would make this again.

This was just okay.  It really needs more orange juice added to the cream cheese mixture or it will just take like cream cheese.  This definitely didn't wow anyone at my house.
