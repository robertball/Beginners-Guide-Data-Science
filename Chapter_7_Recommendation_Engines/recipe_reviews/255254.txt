This cornbread is so easy and sooooo good. I only made a few changes due to dietary restrictions. I used brown sugar Splenda in place of the sugar and I didn't have the creamed corn so I made mine by putting 2 cups frozen or canned corn in a bowl with a tablespoon of butter or marg. and a 1/3 cup of milk (I use soy milk) and a tablespoon of cornstarch (dissolved in the milk), in the microwave for 5-7 min or until it thickens. (stir after 3-4 min) Cool then add to the batter

I used unsweetened  almond milk and brown rice flour in place of gluten free flour and omitted the creamed corn.  I also used only 3 T. of unrefined coconut sugar and added 1/4 t. of xanthan gum to make it softer and moister.  My husband and kids who usually don't like gluten-free foods loved it this way!

I used substitution for white sugar and baking powder with honey and vanilla yogurt with baking soda. Turned out really well. Reduced the temperature down to 375 and it needed about 5 minutes extra time. Turned out great! Tastes really good. It's a bit on the thicker side if you choose to follow the substitutions that I did.  1/4 white sugar to 1/3 honey, baking powder to 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt.

I used yellow cornmeal. Baked golden yellow brown like cornbread should be! Very tasty!

It was well received at Thanksgiving.  I used Del Monte Corn since I found an attestation from Del Monte that it was glutten free.

Having a gluten allergy can definitely be hard but when you find great recipes it can make it a lot easier.  This recipe was yummy,   dense, and filling (like cornbread should be). I would definitely recommend it!

Used yellow cornmeal, BRM 1-to-1 GF flour, and only 1/2 the sugar. Drizzled with a little honey. Loved it! Will make again!

This recipe is a keeper.  I made it to serve with chili,  and everyone loved it.  The reason for only 4 stars is that it took an extra 10 minutes to bake.

I've made this three times and every time it turns out great! For the gluten-free flour I use 1/4 c coconut flour and 1/4 brown rice flour. Today I was out of eggs and had to use 1/4 c mayonnaise as an emergency substitution. I must have really been off my game because I also forgot to put in the sugar. I just drizzled honey over the warm cornbread. It was perfect! Everyone liked it.
