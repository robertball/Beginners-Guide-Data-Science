This WOULD be a good recipe IF it had more seasonings besides a little black pepper!  I had to add garlic juice and "Spike" seasoning.  It's way too bland without them.  I tasted the vegies during each stage of cooking and adding, and did the seasoning then.  My husband and my 14 year old son liked it this way, though my husband added even more Spike.

The adults loved it. I also added celery, water chestnuts
and red pepper. The kids turned their noses up at the squash.
It just goes to show that they don't know how good something
can be.

I doubled the meat, added 4t of minced garlic and ground black pepper to taste. Next time I will slightly reduce amount of squash- really really yummy after I doctored it a bit. Even my 2 year old ate it. Served with Jasmine rice.

Dry and tasteless.  Good for a low-fat meal, but it definitely needs more flavor.

Delicious! I was looking for a quick and light recipe to make on warmer evenings. This dish uses many of my favorite vegetables and the pecans give a wonderful sweetness when paired with the Vadalia onions. A must try dish!

I'll give it 5 stars with additions.  this is something I make all the time and serve over Jasmine rice.  The easiest way to season is with a tablspoon or 2 of soy sauce at the end.
I like to add garlic and fresh ginger with the oil at the beginning.  If you like it hot, add a diced thai chili.
The other way is to take 1 cup chicken broth with 1-2 T of soy sauce and add it to the pan when everything is cooked.  Simmer.  2 tsp cornstarch mixed with a little water stirred in to thicken gives it a better consistency.  It's fast, light, healthy, and delicious, just play with asian spices to give it all the flavor you want.

I made this Stir fry recipe and LOVED it!  I added Water Chestnuts instead of pecans and added Celery too. I also used Teryaki Sauce(on here from "Kevin") and added a very small mix of the 2-3inch dried, red and purple peppers(I can't remember their name, sorry!)that made this dish killer! Good luck andI hope yours tastes as amazing as mine did!    Sharon L

Good basic recipe. I use julienned carrots, chopped onion, minced garlice and summer squash (didn't have shrooms or zucchini) and sauted them in olive oil. Then added a can of Chicken and Rice soup, 1 can water, and 1/2 cup cream. 1/2 tsp kosher salt, fresh ground black pepper, 1/4 tsp ground cumin, 1/4 tsp tumeric and 1/4 tsp curry powder. Also added 1/4 c rice, covered and simmered for 20 min. Added rotisseri shredded chicken at the end. Makes a nice hot chicken, rice and vegetable soup.

Much too bland!  I marinated the chicken in soy sauce and cornstarch before stir-frying.  Too much pepper and not enough flavor!  Halved the pepper and added 1 tsp thyme.

I loved this recipe, and so did my entire family; it's a crowd-pleaser that is easy to make! Slight variations:  I don't like mushrooms, and I rarely keep pecans in the house, so I left those ingredients out.  I had read that the recipe was a little bland, so I make sure to add salt, pepper, garlic and a couple of tablespoons of McCormack Salad Supreme Seasoning.  Enjoy!

It gets one star for ease and one star for looks but this was very bland and needed quite a bit of help to elevate it enough to be interesting.

Delicious as is.  No need to change a thing.  For all those saying it is bland, I don't agree.  The natural flavors of the vegetables combined with the chicken is quite nice.  The wonderful thing about cooking is that you can spice it up if you would like to.

Like others I added spices to this dish...salt, pepper, minced garlic and ginger.  Because of all the squash/zucchini it was still kind of bland.  I'd suggest seasoning it more heavily.  But don't get me wrong, this dish was really good.  Next time I'll just make a chicken stir fry and add some squash/zucchini.

Easy to Make and tasty. I left out the zucchini cuz i didn't have any so I added more carrots and also a pepper. added some green onions as well to give it more color. Instead of of black pepper I added a black pepper SAUCE which gave it quite a kick. Overall lots of fun and ease. I recommend it!!

This was easy to make but watch out don't cook it too long - the vegetables were too cooked the first time I made it.  It needs some seasonings too so I added garlic, salt and pepper.  Yummy dish - great way to get the veggies in.

Good, but I agree with others who said it was too bland. And that was after I added ginger, garlic and bell pepper. A little sriracha gave it a nice little. Next time, however, I'll just stick with the How To Cook Everything stir fry recipe and substitute squash for the vegetable.

I used carrots, squash and zucchini from my garden and only used 3 half chicken breasts. Even my husband liked it and he hates vegetables. The pepper and the pecans make a difference. Also, because the vegetables were from my own garden, I only peeled the carrots.

We really liked this, though I did make changes. I left out mushrooms because I don't like them. I added a lot of garlic, because stir fry needs garlic! The other change was to add some white wine near the end. It deglazed the plan giving the sauce a really nice taste to it. I like stir fry but hate the syrupy sauces so many recipes call for, so this is perfect.
