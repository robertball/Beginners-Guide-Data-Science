I ended up using frozen Swedish meatballs from BJ's (Wellsely farms brand) and then picked up the recipe at step 4. Yum! The sauce is the star for sure. I warmed the frozen meatballs in the broth and then added evaporated milk since the meatballs didn't have that flavor in them. I simmered it down and then made the sauce to spec and served it over egg noodles with broccoli and cauliflower.

These were pretty good. The meatballs were a little to soft and didn't really hold their shape very well. Less milk maybe. I simmered the meatballs in the gravy to finish them off.

Followed the recipe - very delicious. I see what some cooks mentioned about the meatballs being a little mushy but just be gentle with them they will be tender and not taste like something from the grocery store freezer LOL! I served them with buttered wide egg noodles.

I've tried to make meatballs before but have never managed to keep them together or get them to taste nice. This recipe is fantastic easy to follow and amazing end results. The gravy is to die for. Even my 3 year old ate them and he's at his fussy eater stage

I used heavy cream instead of the evaporated milk left out the wine and used all ground beef. It was delicious!

These were very tasty. I made the recipe pretty much as written. The onion was a medium white one and the bread was whole-grain white bread. As I see another reviewer mentioned the meatballs were pretty soft and didn't hold their shape very well. Therefore during the turning and simmering in broth they slightly fell apart during cooking. Also I really should have had a very large skillet or cooked the meatballs in two batches. Nevertheless the flavor was wonderful and I enjoyed the meatballs a lot.

Why would I trust Swedish meatballs from a Brit?

I haven't tried them yet but I will as they are so much like mine. I like to cook without a "roadmap" if you will but I am always keeping my eyes open to something different. I have saved to try later - thank you for posting.

Didn't add the sherry. Family liked it. Needs more flour to thicken gravy.

I'd give it 3 stars my husband would give it 5 so 4 is a compromise. My 7 yr old dipped them in ketchup and liked them. I don't think I'll make them again the flavor just wasn't my preference.

Made the sauce only; Good flavor but the consistency was much thinner than expected... even by boiling it longer to try to cook down while stirring. Needed to add corn starch to thicken

I followed closely as possible. I added cardamom instead of lemon pepper. So good!
