I've been baking for many years now and one thing I've learned is~ There is a way to get around any problem. After reading everyone's reviews I made some changes in the actual baking. Not the recipe, that was perfect. For the people that had trouble rolling: It's a must to kneed long enough for a light, smooth dough (I have a Kitchen Aid that is worth it's weight in gold!) and let it rise until double in an oiled bowl. If the dough doesn't rise long enough you end up with a tough, rubbery dough that will not stay put. After I rolled out the dough, made the pretzel and dunked it in the water/soda, I laid it on a paper towel just long enough to turn it back on my hand and then on my cookie sheet. This way they didn't puddle in the excess water and it's easy to reshape them. I use ordinary baking sheets, sprayed with Pam, and I baked them in the middle of my oven. They literally slipped off the baking sheet and were a golden brown top and bottom. I see no need for Parchment paper. Do they taste exactly like Mall Pretzles? Who cares? They are so good I've already eaten two! Oink! I know the remainder will be gone as soon as the rest of the family gets home and then they'll be clamoring for MORE. Thanks Jeannie!

I rate this recipe 5 stars because the dough is perfect, but it still has some room for improvement in the baking process. Here's what I did: I boiled the pretzels in 4 cups of water and 4 tbsp of baking soda until they floated, one at a time, as some German recipes advise. Then I let them rise for 20 other minutes uncovered, basted them with egg and sprinkled the coarse salt afterwards. Then I baked them for 20 minutes at 225ÂºC, and they came out golden and beautiful, and tasted as real pretzels. A definite keeper. Thanks for sharing!

I am the biggest fan of the "Pretzelmaker" but have been unsuccessful store-bought version.  THIS IS IT!! Now I can enjoy the same pretzels at home!! We topped the pretzels with pizza spices, garlic salt or parmesean cheese and dipped in a variety of sauces. My only advice, DO NOT BAKE on the bottom rack in your oven...the bottoms will burn.  Maybe all you bread experts may already know that but to novices like myself, this advice will save you 6 pretzels you would have lost due to burned bottoms.  THANK YOU JEANNIE!!

Amazing pretzels!  I was a bit afraid of making them because although a lot of people said they were great, some said they were too bready and difficult to work with.  Not so.  And this recipe is SO forgiving.  First, I found that I didn't have any brown sugar so I ended up using regular granulated sugar.  Then, I didn't have bread flour, so I only used all-purpose.  Rolling them did prove to be a bit time consuming because they tend to spring back, but I found that a combination of rolling and picking them up to let gravity stretch them worked well.  Also, because I was working on a short surface, I didn't have room for the entire 3 feet, but I did find that as I got each part to the desired thickness, I could wrap it around one hand  to get it out of the way and continue rolling the rest with the other hand.   I salted them before putting them in the oven, and rather than baking on parchment, I used well-buttered foil.  The bottoms came out nice and crunchy and buttery, and the rest was chewy and soft.  I made a garlic butter by just putting some minced garlic and butter in a pan and heating until the rawness was gone and dipped the hot pretzels in that rather than putting the topping directly on the pretzel.  So yum and so easy!

I used only whole wheat flour as that was all I had so maybe that made a difference, but I have no idea what the reviewers who had problems with sticky dough did - my dough was actually a bit on the dry side!  No problems with the water bath either, although I did blot the bottoms with a papertowel before putting them on a greased cookiesheet to reduce sticking (and had no problems with that either). I cut the recipe in half since so many people said the pretzels didn't keep well... I didn't have any problems here either?  Then again, I didn't put any topping on them until just before eating (so the stored ones are 'naked') - at the mall they don't put the topping on until you request it and if it IS done beforehand, well, those pretzels have only been sitting there for a half hour or so!  Oh, and just like I request at the mall, I use water to make my topping stick (spray bottle) instead of butter - trying to be healthy and all.  :)  Both me and my bf thought these made a great snack!

Good pretzel's. The best with cinnamon. I didn't use parchment paper and my pans were completely sticky. USE PARCHMENT PAPER. The pretzel barely came off after lots of shoveling them off the pan

For everyone having problems with the pretzels tasting stale the next day, just put them in ziplock bags, freeze them, and whenever you get the craving, pop them in the microwave for 45 sec.

Oh my golly these are amazing. I crave these things all the time...not exactly sure that it is a good thing that I can make them on my own now...LOL.  I did have to add more flour to my dough because it was just too sticky...and the cook time was a little bit longer too.  Didn't change anything else.  Hubby ate this with a Garlic Parmesan butter and I had mine plain.  Thanks for the post.  One of my favorites.

pretty good for my first attempt at making pretzels.  i converted the recipe for use with my sourdough starter: 2 cups active starter, 3 cups bread flour, 3 tblsp sugar (a little extra to make up for the sour flavor of the starter) and 2 tsp salt - everything else i left the same.  the rise is longer, as expected for a sourdough starter.  also, greased cookie sheets seem to work fine.  underbake them slightly if you want them chewy.

I have to admit that I was skeptical to think I'd actually find a recipe that was as good as the mall pretzels.  Call me a former skeptic!  This recipe really surpassed my greatest expectations.  I did as Flashsmith said back on February 6, 2004 and laid the pretzels on a few layers of paper towels after dipping in the soda water.  It drained off just enough of the water so they didn't stick. I used Cooks Essentials insulated baking sheets and my pretzels actually slid off the pans.  One thing that I also did was sprinkle my coarse salt on them while they were still wet (from the soda bath), then let them raise and then baked them.  The salt dissolved just enough to make it stick so that I didn't have to use the butter and added calories.  For those that have trouble rolling these out, and as other reviewers have said, a proper kneading of the dough is a MUST.  After the dough raises (and make sure it has raised to at least double) punch it down and let it rest for a few minutes.  Then divide the pieces and go from there.  Also, when you put your yeast in the sugar water, don't put the salt in with it.  Put the salt in with the flour mixture.  The salt is used to control the yeast, and you want to activate it at this time.

This is simply an amazingly good recipe and I thank you Jeannie Yee 
for posting it here on All Recipes!

This is the best ``Soft Bavarian Pretzel`` (Mall Pretzel) Recipe, that I have found.

I make them commercially, so I make several batches ahead of time, freeze them in roomy Zip-Lock bags. One pretzel dough per bag. Date them. Dont take out the air before zipping the bag shut.  And then, VERY IMPORTANT, take them out the night before you need them. We start selling the pretzels at 9;00am.

I want my pretzels to be fresh, so I get up at 3;30am to start baking them. The dough is ready to shape into pretzels at that time. The dough shoould not be frozen for more than a week or so. I usually bake them after they have been frozen for only a couple of days. I also use a scale to make sure they are all equal.

I bake them at 425 F., put the timer for 8 minutes and then start monitoring them. You often have to move the trays around for the pretzels to all cook evenly. I use parchement paper, because I dont want the taste of a pan spray on the pretzels.

Enjoy

These are really like mall pretzels! Here are a few adjustments I made to make them taste like the real thing:  -Boil 4 cups of water and 4 T. of baking soda, boil each pretzel for 30 seconds, then let dry on towel before baking. -Bake at 325 degrees for 10-11 minutes, on the middle rack, this way the bottoms don't burn and they get golden brown all around. -Buy popcorn seasonings, like sour cream and onion, garlic and parmesan, etc. Makes them DELICIOSO!  It's also fun to make a whole bunch of 4-5 inch long pretzels "sticks," and easier than twisting them into the pretzel shape.

Bread Machine Version - Just add dough ingrediants to machine and select dough cycle. They turn out perfect!!  Some things I noticed: 1) Recipe made more than 12, more like 20. 2) Roll dough thin!! They will rise to almost double when baking 3)Do not add flour while rolling thin, it is better when dough sticks a little to counter while rolling (makes it easier to make thin ropes). 4) I used my baking stones with no parchment paper or oil and had no problems with them sticking.  5) We dip these in butter and then in a cinnamon/sugar mixture. They are delicious just dipped in the butter too!  6) These are absolutely wonderful, I have no idea how long they keep, because we never have them longer than a day!!

OMG... Do not hesitate to try these. I will never buy a 5 dollar pretzel again! I made just a few allterations but these come out wonderfully. I made the dough just as written. I then doubled the water soda mix and boiled it, then placed the pretzels into the boiling water removing them when they floated. After boiling I dabbed off the excess liquid and then continued with the baking. While baking I noticed the bottoms were getting browned fast and the tops were still not done, so i removed the pretzels from the oven then brushed them with butter (I think the butter is key in making these pretzles taste like auntie annes)and sprinkled with salt and then placed them under the broiler for a minute or so until they were nice and brown on the tops. This is the only way I have been able to get the correct coloring with my finicky oven without the bottoms getting to dark.

Neither my daughter nor I were able to get these to roll out to a 3 foot length, maybe 18 inches, so our pretzels looked like dough blobs on the baking sheet before baking. They did however taste good with cream cheese and are yeasty...nothing like a traditional pretzel but more like a soft bread stick. My advise to anyone reading this: DO NOT substitute wax paper for the parchment paper! After airing all the smoke out of our apartment we were able to salvage half the pretzels. Will make again, however probably just shape like a bread stick instead of trying to twist them, and ofcourse NO wax paper!

My family thought the pretzels were ok, definitely not as good as the pretzels at the mall.  They taste better if they are eaten right away.  By the next day they do not taste very good.

I thought these were pretty good!  My daughters loved them and had fun attempting to shape them into pretzels as well as letters of the alphabet (great practice!)  This dough was not as sticky as some others we have tried.  For that reason alone we will make these again.  I think the key to these pretzels is to roll the dough pencil thin.  This can be difficult because it likes to hold it's shape and the dough seems to dry out quickly.  Keeping the extra dough covered with a damp cloth does help this some.  I think next time I will use more butter after baking, but other than that the recipe was very good.  Not exactly mall pretzels, although close, but a very good alternative for the price.  Will definately make again.

These pretzels are soooo yummy! I let my bread machine do the work, then followed these instructions for the remaining part of the recipe. They turned out just as good as those at the mall, maybe a little better ;0). I baked mine for only 7 minutes,and got a perfect golden color. Soft, chewy and very tasty with garlic butter and kosher salt. Thanks Jeannie. This is a keeper!

This recipe is absolutely wonderful!  The instructions were perfect.  I agree with one of the previous posters about rolling out the rope and letting it rest.  But I just wanted to add something that really worked for me.  After rolling out ropes a bit, I covered them with a slightly damp towel while I rolled out the others.  When I went back to finish rolling them out, they were much easier to roll. 

I used only all purpose flour because I didn't have bread flour on hand. 

I didn't use parchment paper, I simply greased the cookie sheet.  Also, I laid the pretzel on a spatula while I dipped them in the soda water bath, then flipped them over onto a cloth for a moment before putting them on the cookie sheet.

They were light, but chewy... just like a mall pretzel!

Incredible. They do taste just like the pretzels at the mall. Even my incredibly picky 8 year old thought so.

AWESOME! I brushed melted butter on them, and sprinkled them with salt and garlic powder before putting them in the oven. Then, I took them out 3 minutes before the ten minute timer went off, sprinkled mozzarella cheese and put them back in the oven. After I took them out, I brushed more butter on them. HEAVENLY.. :)

Very good! A bit time consuming, but just throw it in the breadmaker and go shopping or clean the house. They are a bit hard to roll out, but once you get the hang of it it is easy.  I will double the recipe next time cause my boyfriend ate them all before I could put them away  :(

They turned out good, but they were diffidently NOT worth the time and energy. I'll just buy the ones at the mall. I have better things to do during a 3 1/2 hr period. If you want to waste 3 hours out of your short life, good luck to ya.

These are Great. I doubled the brown sugar to 4 tbs because we like them sweet.  I put the ingredients in my bread machine and set it to the dough setting.  It worked like a charm. Once done I rolled the dough into ropes, dipped into water/soda and baked.  The dough was a little sticky so have flour on your hands when you remove it from the bread machine. They were so good.  Just like the ones at PretzelMaker we had yesterday.  I will definately keep this recipe.

I tried to make these pretzels this morning and started off very good. Kitchen was smelling like I knew what I was doing. I got to the part where I needed to cut the dough in 12 pieces and everything started going downhill.  I tried to roll it and it got stuck to the counter. then I added flour and then I still couldn't roll it thin. By the time I stretched and pulled the dough and tried to form it to a pretzel, I was EXTREMELY exhausted. I dipped it in the baking soda solution and the pretzel fell apart. This is where I gave up. I am letting the 1 pretzel and the other "rolls" (this is what I decided was best". I will let you know what I came out with. Oh, let me add that I am a beginner bread maker and this was really a challenge for me!

These are very good and very easy. I worked at a well known pretzel place for many years and I have high standards when it comes to pretzels. These are yummy. Make sure not to let them over rise, because then they will be very sticky, too stretchy and will not shape correctly. A good thing also is to try not to roll them too much. just try to stretch them a little. Less rolling makes them softer and fluffy. It also gives them the slit look that they need.

These do turn out fabulous.  I do not like dipping them however, I find it much better to brush the baking soda on the tops only with a pastry brush.  When you dip them the bottoms burn.

If you boil these like a previous reviewer said, they are awesome..tastes just like a soft pretzel!!  I boiled some, and cooked the rest like the instructions above, they were still good, but more bread tasting.  I liked the boiled ones much more.  Great recipe!!

This recipe went pretty smoothly for me - I just need to roll the ropes skinnier next time.  They puffed up a lot during the rise and then baked into one big blob.  They taste amazing, so we weren't too concerned with what they looked like.

Tastes just like the "gourmet" mall pretzels! I like mine brushed with butter & sprinkled with garlic salt served with a little marinara sauce. My kids like cinnamon-sugar or salted, dh likes parmesan. They get eaten as fast as I can make them!

Wow - these pretzels are super.  I've tried MANY pretzel recipes and the pretzels always turn out heavy and tough.  These "mall pretzels" are soft and fairly light and taste wonderful with cinnamon and sugar.  I will definitely be making these again.

This is a wonderful recipe BUT Iv already tried so many and found the most important thing to me is the chewy crusty outside that your only going to get if you BOIL them, just ever so slightly... don't tell me dipping them in warm water will just do the trick! They taste more like bread sticks that way. If you want a chewier pretzel BOIL them like you would a bagel, just not near as long. 1 min is plenty, drain well. And the key ingredient to this recipe is brown sugar!  if you don't have any add a dribble of molasses... gives it that yummy yeasty flavor.  I agree with Flash-smith that plenty of kneading and then rising time make a HUGE handling difference so they roll out perfectly. Have fun!

I made these twice in one week.  My kids love them! First time, I forgot to let them rise after shaping them.  But still turned out good.  Second time, way better. First time, I use middle rack to bake them, but bottom brown way faster then top, so second time, I move it to 1 level higher on rack to bake, and both side baked beautifully.

Wonderful pretzels.  I have had to make several batches since I first tried the recipe last week.  Everyone liked it as a bread alternative, so I twirled the ropes of dough into concentric circle buns.  Use the baking soda wash, then butter and salt just the same. They have actually been handy for sandwiches even.. Pretzels are fun, but I had to make back to back batches these were so popular with family and guests.  My circle bun was a way to speed up the process -- with wonderful results!

Followed the recipe exactly, except I substituted whole wheat flour for all purpose. I did not have any issues with rolling out the dough. I made traditional twists, long ropes then cut them in pieces, and also shaped out Superbowl XLIII. These disappeared fast at the Superbowl party I baked them for. I also made beer cheese dip, honey spread, and blue cheese dip for the pretzels.

I made these twice, once following the recipe exactly and I would give it a 4 * for the recipe...I then made them and boiled the pretzels in water and baking soda before baking for 30 seconds.  Wow!  What a difference!  Nice crust on the outside and chewy middle. Without boiling they came out yummy, but more like pizza bread.  Boiled they came out like pretzels, fantastic!  Thank you for the recipe!

Very easy to make.  I put all of the ingredients in my kitchen aid with the dough hook and let it do the hard work.  I divided the dough in half, twisting half in to mini pretzels and leaving the rest as pretzel twists so people could tell which were butter/salt and which were cinnamon sugar.  I served the salt/butter with the cheese dipping sauce from this site.  I also followed another reviewers advice and patted them a little dry after dipping them in the soda solution so they wouldn't sit in puddles.  

UPDATE:  2 years later and we are trying to do the "whole grain" thing, so I used the 1 cup bread flour, 2 c whole wheat and about a cup of AP to thicken it up to the right consistency.  Good, but next time I'll just use one cup of whole wheat- just a bit too gritty for me- and I eat whole wheat bread everyday for lunch.  Still a 5 star recipe though

A winner!  This is too easy, especially if you make the dough in a bread machine...you do not need extra flour to roll out the ropes.  I did not use parchment paper, but just sprayed down the cookie sheet with Pam and they came out perfect, with that crusty-chewy bottom.  The hardest part is not gobbling them all up at once when they come out of the oven.

I make pretzels all the time and this one was great! The dough stretched well for me and I thought that they tasted just like "mall" pretzels. I followed a tip from here about letting the pretzels rest and then finish rolling and that worked great. If you find the dough is slipping too much too roll, a little water on my hands from the baking soda mixture solved that for me. Will be making these again!!

Delicious!  Here's my substitutions - I didn't have bread flour, so used regular AP and just kneaded it longer in my stand mixer so it would produce more gluten, making them chewier.  I use bread machine yeast, from a jar, so just use 2 tsp instead of the packet, and reduce the rise time by 1/2.  Another reviewer said to use parchment paper...big mistake.  I had to remove little bits of paper from the finished pretzels.  The cooking spray the next time did the trick and they slid off smooth and easy.  Oh, and the 2nd time I doubled the brown sugar, and liked the flavor even more.  The almost-sweet & salty was irresistable.  Thanks for a great recipe!  Even my 14 yr old stepson wanted to help!

Very good, in fact I believe better than the ones at the mall because you don't have to make them super greasy and heavy from being drenched in butter.  The dough was pretty easy to work with- I kept the dough ball covered with a wet paper towel cause it was drying out a bit while I was doing the rolling, which was a bit tedious and the ones I rolled 'pencil thin' were almost a bit too crisp after baking exactly 8 mins so next time I'll roll them a bit thicker or bake a minute or 2 less.  Brushed them with butter and sprinkled with kosher salt.  Served with a cheesy sauce that was so yummy.  I also made a few pretzel dogs which were soooo good!  They were perfect after baking 8 mins.  Next time I might put a pat of cream cheese in with the hot dogs (it's a Seattle thing...trust me, it's good) and maybe even some grilled onions.  This would also make a great pizza or calzone dough.  I love this recipe and will keep it in my arsenal.  It'd be a fun thing to do with kids too, although since it takes a long time younger kids might get impatient... Well worth the work and the wait!*******UPDATE: Out of curiosity, I froze a portion of this dough for about 3 or 4 weeks and it kept well. I used it to make herbed breadsticks that were YUMMY with soup and salad.  I just patted the dough ball down to about 1/2" and sliced with a sharp knife into sticks. Brushed with garlic butter, sprinkled with thyme, baked 11mins. Really good!

I searched a lot for a good pretzel recipe, this morning I spotted this recipe by mistake, and within an hour my dough was ready and resting, and it took me 30 minutes to assemble the pretzels, and rest them again. One advice, when you roll the ropes to shape the pretzels, let the ropes rest for couple of minutes and then reroll them again, it will be easier to shape a good size pretzel, dip in the baking soda water, keeping a paper towel handy to collect the excess water before you put them on the parchment paper to rest before baking.
This is a very good recipe, and definitely will use the recipe again. 
Here are some pictures from the batch I made this afternoon.

Wonderful recipe!!!  Made them today and there is not one left!!  My daughter said they were the best she has ever had.  We plan on making a bunch to freeze over Thanksgiving break.  To do that, just leave off the butter and topppings and freeze the baked pretzels in a single layer on a cookie sheet.  When you want one or two just take them out of the freezer, brush frozen pretzels with water, sprinkle with salt and bake at 450 for about 5 minutes or until hot.  Or heat, then brush with butter and sprinkle salt.  It's a great,quick snack.

These turned out pretty well.  I will definitely make them again.  However, I will change a couple things.   First, once you have made the dough into a preztel shape, the directions say to dip the preztels in warm water mixed with baking soda (110 degrees F).  Make sure you shape all your preztels before you start dipping.  Otherwise, if you shape one pretzel, dip, and shape your next pretzel and dip, and so forth, your water will cool down too much and the later pretzels won't rise very well.  Next time, I think I'm going to heat some water in a deep skillet and let it cool down to 110 degrees in the pan.  Given that the water is in a warm pan, I would think it would stay warmer longer.  Second, the recipes said to put parchment paper on a cookie sheet and to lay the pretzels on the parchment paper and then stick them into the oven.  I haven't had good experience with wax paper in the oven in the past, so I was a little leary, but I decided to follow the recipe to a T.  Although the paper did not burn, as I thought it would, the pretzels stuck to the paper.  Next time, I will eliminate the wax paper and bake them on a greased sheet.  

Finally, the recipe says to roll the dough out into 3 ft ropes.  I thought 3 ft was too long.  The pretzels ended up very big - - I could only fit 4 on a cookie sheet.  Next time, I think 2 feet will be sufficient.

Despite these modifications, I will definitely be making them again.  They tasted pretty authentic.

When you make cinnamon go on top instead of salt, you can't dunk the whole thing. Next time, I'll make it so that I use a pastry brush on the pretzel so it's not so strong. Let the smaller people (kids) make their own shapes of the pretzels (if they're siblings, letters of their names are fun!).

Love this recipe! It is super easy and the taste is perfect. However trying to make pencil thin 3 foot strands of dough is probably the hardest part.  I made them just about as thick as a Crayola marker and they turned out fine.

AMAZING!!!!!  These are so good and they really do taste like the ones at the mall!  I did pretzel shapes and sticks and they all came out wonderful.  I have a feeling I will be making these again tomorrow because the family gobbled them up quickly. Thanks for a great recipe.

Thanks for a GREAT recipe!!  These are AWESOME!  My kids and I love making these.  I made only one change, not to the recipe, but to the preparation.  Instead of just dipping the pretzels in the baking soda solution, I made a larger batch of the solution, heated it to a simmer on the stove, and simmered the pretzels for 15-30 seconds, removed them with a slotted spoon, and drained on paper towels for a few seconds.  This gave them a much chewier crust, more like the Hot Sam mall pretzels I grew up loving.  I do agree with one post's suggestion not to use parchment paper, but spray the pan with Pam instead.  Every time I try using the paper, my pretzels stick badly, but if I spray the pan, they slide right off.  Happy baking!!

Two things are a must: Kneading and Parchment Paper. Dough ball is smooth after 4-5 minutes of kneading-DON'T LET THIS FOOL YOU!- Continue kneading for the full time. I did the full 8 minutes on a half-sized recipe-and it was *VERY* easy to roll (don't flour the surface when rolling-having them slightly stick to the counter helps them roll out-also combining the jump rope method helps work out thick spots)So maybe even up to 10 minutes would be appropriate on the full size recipe. Wiping off excess water is not necessary when using parchment paper (the paper will absorb some), and they don't stick at all. In fact wiping off the excess may remove some of the baking soda needed to give the outside of the pretzel a nice skin, and the bottoms a crispy golden brown. Best right out of the oven, but they weren't too bad when reheated at 450 degrees. Loved it, can't wait to make again!

This recipe is awesome. We made them with chopped up jalepenos in the dough and dipped the finished product in spicy nacho cheese and they were better than Auntie Anne's! My husband also found out that this dough makes a fabulous hand-tossed pizza dough recipe as well.

Great!  Everyone loves them.  I've used rapid rise yeast with good results.  I usually just toss the ingredients into the bread maker and run the dough cycle (1.5 hrs) and it works fine.

I brush with an egg wash to add shine to the finished product.  A pain to roll out into pretzel shapes.

This is an easy recipe, especially if you have a kitchen aid mixer.  Toss the ingredients in and mix, change to a dough hook and let the machine do all the kneading.  When we got to rolling out the ropes, I let my kids do it, (ages 5-14) so it is definately kid friendly.  They loved the pretzels.  We took half of the pretzels and brused on a mixture of 1 TBSP. butter and 1 TBSP honey, and sprinkled on ground almonds. Then we melted 18 carmels and 1 TBSP milk for a dipping sauce.  LOVED it! We'll be doing this again-soon!

well done recipe. we were able to roll the dough out further to make even larger pretzels which we like. next time we will try raisins or cheese to get more "mall-like" varieties.

These are the BEST!!!  I know others said they had problems rolling out the dough.  I made the recipe exactly as written and I didn't have any problems.  As far as comments on how they taste the next day, I will have to wait till I make them again.  My pretzels barely made it out of the oven before my family attacked them.  Great recipe!!!!!!

These are really good!  They are just like the mall pretzels, only fresher.  I prefer to put the coarse salt on when they are wet and let them rise that way.  Then the flavor is really set in to the whole thing.

Fabulous. Made some salty made others sweet with butter then sprinkled cinnamon and sugar mix. Froze individually wrapped. Reheated 30 seconds in microwave.
Very easy dough to work with. Used instant yeast which made the process even faster and easier.

I tell you what. I'm so glad these are called pretzels, because I sure did get turned around and twisted up in the recipe a couple of times LOL...recipe is excellent. I goober in a few spots but it sure wasn't the recipe...it was the baker...aka ME! ;-) so next time and I hope some take the advice on what not to do in this recipe. So not add all the flour at once... ya might not need all of it. Use what is left if any for the flour board to knead on. Also do not forgot if your warmer box has a proofer button to forget to add a little water cup for moisture reasons...just learned my oven had one and totally didn't clue that in, when I pulled my dough out of it with a slight crust. And also don't roll your dough on a flour board when you pull it out of the proofer either...it won't be able to roll out into a rope like strip when you need to. ;-) I also brushed my pretzels with butter and sprinkled salt on BEFORE I put in the oven to bake...not reading that part of the recipe resulted in a beautiful pretzel because when I saw that part and went opps, I then did it the way the author said...and didn't have the same pretty affect not did the salt stick on like the 1st baked batch...so because of my little goobers, I ended up making pretzel nuggets, brushing them with butter and the salt, made them so easiby pop-able. My kids LOVED these!! They were awesome even after my foo-barbs. I will soo make this again and again!!! What a keeper!

YUMM!! I followed the advice of another and quickly laid the pretzels on a paper towel to absorb the excess water/baking soda before putting them on a baking sheet. They turned out perfect, 6 made with butter, cinnamon and sugar, the other 6 with butter and salt. I can't wait to make them again!!

After reading ALL the reviewes going back to 2009, I decided to take the suggestion of others and boil these pretzels in water and baking soda for 30 seconds before baking.  I have to say, I am very sorry I did.  When I had formed them into pretzels, and allowed them to rise, they puffed up nicely.  Should have just given them an egg wash and sprinkled with them with kosher salt, and baked them.  After having boiled them, salted them and baked them, they came out chewey and flat, not fluffy as I had expected.  Will make this recipe again, this time omit the boiling part and see how they come out.  How disappointing!!!

What a fun and EASY recipe!  This turned out perfectly.  I made the dough in my bread machine and then easily rolled out my pretzels.  My family raved over the taste.  I was a superhero for the evening.  This will definitely be a staple in my household.

These were not thick skinned and chewy on the outside as they should be. In hindsight I believe the problem lies with dipping them in the warm water. I would make these again, but put them in boiling water for a few minutes, just as you do with bagels. In comparing a few recipes in cookbooks and on the net with this one, I see that that is the one common factor that this recipe lacks. Brushing with an egg wash and sprinkling the coarse salt on before baking is one other thing I would adjust. I found the melted butter made these softer and it was hard to get the salt to stick. I found the editor's tip for rolling out the ropes worked really well. Be sure to keep your dough balls covered with plastic wrap while forming the pretzels, as I found them harder to form when the dough started drying out.

Beware.... Don't think that waxed paper will substitute for parchment paper!!  If you don't have it, just grease the pan instead.  My first batch was ruined because of using waxed paper.  Not to mention it smoked up my whole kitchen.  Other than that the recipe is GREAT

This was my first time trying pretzels. The hardest part for me was rolling the dough into the right thickness so mine wound up with smaller than desirable holes. Tasted fantastic though! For the soda bath, I just shaped them on an extra wide spatula, dunked and splashed quickly to cover any areas that didn't get submerged, then removed to the parchment paper right away. Great recipe!

These were good.  I used fresh ground flour (so 100% whole wheat) and honey instead of sugar.  We enjoyed them.

This was what was muttered around my kitchen table as my family of four sat down to eat them. The 4-year old exclaimed, "Mmmmm...yummy!" My six-year old said, "These are better than the ones at the mall!" and my husband said, "Wow, I can't believe how good these are!" The only change I made was to put the ingredients in my bread machine and used the dough cycle. Other than that I followed the recipe to a "T." They were absolutely delicious and I agree with my 6-year old in that I too think they are better than the ones at the mall! I baked 6 of them and froze the rest after the baking soda bath. I'll update my review after I thaw them later in the week. I'm hoping they taste just as yummy as they did today! Fantastic recipe!!!

Wow everything was easy about this recipe.  I did not have bread flour so I used 4 cups of AP flour.  My pretzels turned out excellent!

These are wonderful!  At first, I didn't think they tasted like my favorite mall pretzel with the initials A.A., but once I had one with nacho cheese sauce, I did agree it was *almost* the same.  I made some with kosher salt, some with cinnamon & sugar, and some with fresh parmesean & granulated garlic.  My favorites were the kosher salt ones...with the nacho cheese salt.  I did drain them on paper towels.  I tried layering them like someone mentioned, but they stuck too much and made the pretzels misshapen.  Thank you for posting!  Next time I may add a bit more brown sugar and add a squirt of molasses.

Great recipe. I've done this one a few times with my kids and they love it. Just a tip, instead of dipping in baking soda and water, I let them sit for 20 or 30 seconds in some boiling baking soda water like you would making bagels. The baking soda is what makes them brown like pretzels, so if they aren't brown enough for your liking try adding some more baking soda to the solution. They come out with just a little chewiness that we like. Froze a bunch of cooked pretzels and they reheated like a dream. 
Thanks for a great snack!

Wow! These really are awesome! I did use parchment and had no trouble with them sticking.  Since it was just myself and my husband at home when I tried this recipe I layered the leftover pretzels (already shaped but not dipped in soda/water) with parchement paper in a tupperware and put them in the freezer. Anytime we feel like a pretzel we just take one out, while it is defrosting on the counter I mix up the soda/water bath, then pick up where I left off in the recipe. They are just as good this way! Thanks alot Jeannie for this enjoyable recipe. :)

Yes, these live up to the reviews. I made it two ways: One batch with an egg wash and coarse salt; the other batch with melted butter, garlic and parmesan cheese. I gave a second dose of garlic butter and parmesan sprinkling after they came out of the oven. Both were wonderful, but my family voted the egg wash batch best because it gave the pretzels the chewy texture you get from mall pretzels. I did follow two key suggestions from other reviewers: I let the ropes rest a few minutes before rolling and twisting for final shape. And I boiled in baking soda-water for 15 seconds. The egg wash is critical. Brush on and sprinkle with coarse salt before baking. The dough is easy to work with, too. Yummy. Everyone wants this one in my permanent files. Thank you so much.
Update: Don't boil in baking soda water. Just dip as stated. When they are boiled, they won't rise very much. I learned that the second time I made them and tried the advice of another reviewer.

These pretzels are pretty tasty when they first come out of the oven. They do taste just like the big pretzels you get at the mall. The first batch was gone within five minutes !  The kosher salt gives it the extra kick. However, once the pretzels cooled they were rubbery and soft. So if you plan on eating these right away, I would recommend them. If not, maybe half the recipe because you'll end up throwing them away otherwise.

Oh, these are SO good!  I used my bread machine for the hard part.  ;-)  Then I used the editor's note and rolled them out to half the length the first time and then re-rolled to the rest of the length -- made it a LOT easier!

The only thing I would do differently is lower the temp on my oven.  450 was too high and my pretzels were quite brown after only 7 minutes.  Next time I'll probably try 400.

But overall a GREAT recipe -- one that we will make many times!

I'm still trying out my breadmaker, so I used it on the dough setting to mix and rise the dough.  I brought the water down to about 1 1/4 cups and added minced garlic and Italian seasoning to the dough. I also brushed the finished pretzels with olive oil and sprinkled them with parmesan cheese and basil.  They were great dipped in pasta sauce and my friend told me I have to make them again for her.  I completely missed the part in the recipe about dipping the pretzels in baking soda and water, though.  I will try that next time when I don't feel like pizza pretzels.

Four Stars Mrs Yee!! Normally I like to make my yeast dough by hand, but I did this in a KitchenAid with a dough hook... Worked like a charm! The tips  on letting the dough rest worked well too. Watching an "annies" employee helps making the pretzel shapes quickly and the dipping was a breeze. 
I have to say the KEY to good yeast dough is GOOD YEAST!!!!
Proof your yeast! If anyone is having problems with rising your yeast is not good and flour plays an important part too. When using bread flour be sure to buy a good high gluten flour.
Nuff said!

Tasted great! My changes: 4 cups all-purpose flour was fine. I baked them at 400 instead of 450 to avoid over-baking. Turned out perfectly this way. Next time I would dip the entire pretzel in melted butter since you're going for the "mall" taste anyway, why not? Cinnamon sugar was outstanding. I'm working on a maple crumb, too, with a maple powdered sugar glaze and brown sugar crumbled on top. Who needs Auntie Anne's now? :)

mmm...delicious! Best right out of the oven. I topped mine with garlic salt, ground cinnamon, ranch dressing mix, and/or cheese sprinkles before baking, and they were great - gone in one night. The dough was hard to knead at first because it was supersticky. After that, it was a little difficult to roll it out as thin as the recipe asked, so I just made thicker, smaller pretzels. This was my second time making pretzels - I used the "Buttery Soft Pretzels" recipe the first time, and this was way better!

I made the dough in my bread maker..very easy! These pretzels had a great flavor, but kept sticking to the parchment paper..I think it was the baking soda & water mixture that made that happen. Still very tasty and definitely worth making!!

An excellent pretzel recipe, I made several dozen pretzels from this recipe.  I experimented with different varieties and different toppings.  Adding a chopped up frozen garlic/parmesan butter to the dough as you roll out your pretzels makes for a great savory snack.

Each time a make this recipe, the kids want me to make 'another batch' right away.  I do use regular flour, although I plan to make them 'healthier' next time.  I do 'dip n blot' then add course salt, as many others have. Normally, we top with cinnamon or garlic-butter, but today ~ it's home-made caramel from Chef John on Allrecipes. Why the 4 out of 5 - well, it takes quite a bit of work to do these, when most don't have the time that I do.

Wow! I was skeptical even with all the fabulous reviews, but these taste awesome!!! Mine didn't turn out the prettiest in shape, but I followed the recipe exactly other than the baking part. One reviewer noted that parchment paper is not needed, and she is right. I did the same as her - sprayed the baking sheet with PAM and they slid right off. Excellent!! Thanks for sharing!!

These were outstanding.  I doubled and boiled the baking soda solution, dipping them in that as another reviewer had suggested, then I brushed with melted butter and they baked up golden, chewy and delish.  I covered most of mine with cinnamon sugar and dipped in caramel sauce to eat.  Slap yo mama.

This is the best soft pretzel recipe that I have found so far! I follow it exactly, except the baking soda bath. I boil the pretzels in it until they float, drain, and then bake. I've used this to make pretzel hamburger and hotdog buns as well. Instead of spending a ton of time shaping the pretzels, I'll just shape a few and then form the rest into ropes and cut them in 1-2 inch pieces for pretzel bites! Delicious!

These were super delicious! Instead of using parchment paper, I used wax paper that I sprayed with non-stick cooking oil. Make SURE that if you use wax paper instead of parchment paper that you spray it with a non-stick spray, otherwise your oven will smoke! Also, I halved the recipe and found that I needed to add about a cup MORE flour because the consistency was far too "doughy". As a 17 year old, I found this extremely easy to make and VERY similar to Annie Anne's mall pretzels! They were wonderful! I'll definitely be making them again!

I think I must be doing something wrong. It sounded like people have made these using a bread machine, but it's not working for me. I have tried it twice and both times the dough has been incredibly sticky and hasn't risen at all after I've rolled it out.

The pretzels have tasted good, but they haven't really turned out well. I wish I knew what I was doing wrong.

I tried this recipe once, and while it turned out fine, it wasn't up to the standard of the other recipe on this site, "buttery soft pretzels". I found these to be a little flavourless and not as good a texture.

Awesome!! Made these as directed but used fast rising yeast so skipped first step to let yeast sit. Wrapped these around turkey sausage links and baked-yummy!!

I was excited to try these and  was NOT disappointed. Was a thumbs up in the household.  I was worried I didn't have parchment paper but I used foil with a little pam spray and it worked fine.  Thanks for sharing

FABULOUS recipe.  My kids always want pretzels from the mall and the water park.  I decided to make them at home to show them the price difference.  WOW!  For a couple of dollars we made a dozen pretzels that are to die for.  The kids said, "These are the BEST pretzels we've ever had!!!!"

I made these just as directed (with the exception of rolling the dough into 16 portions instead of 12) and they turned out FANTASTIC!  My 6 year old took a bite and declared "wow!".  They are a big hit and were super easy to make!

I also made a few w/out brushing the tops with butter for my dairy allergic kid.  I just sprinkled the topping on before baking and that seemed to work out just fine.  Great recipe!

love these pretzels, but instead of dipping them in the baking soda soultion, I just take 1 cuo very hot water and add the 2 tbs baking soda to the cup , then take a brush and dip it into the cup and brush all the pretzels with that. And allways cook them on parchment paper. works just as well as dipping them with out all the mess.

These are excellent!  Crisp on outside and tender on inside.  I used 3 cups all purpose white flour and 1 cup whole wheat. Be sure to knead until smooth and elastic and definately let it rise for an hour - I placed mine on a dish towel to drain slightly before placing them on the baking sheet sprayed with Pam.  Roll thinly when forming because they rise again and also increase in size while baking.  No issues or problems at all.  Fabulous!

I love this recipe and I have made a few extra changes to make them very cinnamony. In the recipe for 24 servings I added a Tablespoon of cinnamon to the dough. I let the dough rise twice at one hour intervals (they seem to come out with a superior texture) and when I pulled them out of the oven I brushed them with butter and topped them with a cinnamon suger mixture that I sprinkled on. It is a party in our mouths. I have also made them plain with just salt on top. The only change in recipe I made in the plain ones was I let them rise twice before I formed the pretzels. GREAT RECIPE!

If you are going to use paper, use parchment. Wax paper will not substitute. I had to do two batches of six. The second batch I buttered the baking sheet. A lot better than the wax paper.

Followed recipe to a tee, except cooked at 415 degrees.  PERFECTION, just like Auntie Anne's.  For fun on our second batch we added a tiny can of chopped jalapenos the hot ones:)  Just like AA's jalapeno pretzels...I"M in LOVE with this recipe.  THANK YOU!!!

I used my Kitchen Aid and it made this recipe SUPER easy.  I put the dough hook on, mixed the ingredients and let it knead for 5 minutes.  My 9 year old son had so mcuh fun making this recipe and showing off the results!  Not as sweet as an Auntie Anne's Pretzel, but super good for homemade!

Very fun to make! 

For aesthetics, make sure to fully submerge the shaped pretzels into the baking soda-water solution and to frequently stir the solution between dips. Since I did not do either the first time, my fingerprints showed up on the pretzels as white spots and some pretzels came out with a marbleized look.

Also this recipe is much sweeter than the mall ones, which is perfect is you are sprinkling them with cinnamon and sugar. Next time I am going to make the dough with half the required brown sugar and sprinkle with kosher salt.

These are fantastic! I have made them many times using only all purpose flour because I had no bread flour. This time I replaced 2 tsp of the all purpose flour with 2 tsp wheat gluten and I found the dough much easier to work with. That, and letting it rest after the initial roll-out as suggested by the Editor's note were key. Thanks for a great recipe!

Love them. I didn't have bread flour so I used 4 cups regular flour without a problem.  Well worth the time.  My son and I had 11 of the 12 eaten in 1 day! Carb addicts dream come true!

I have tried many pretzel recipes, and this one ranks near the bottom.  We prefer the slightly sweeter and more dense pretzels at our mall.  This recipe tastes like a mini-roll with salt.  It would probably be best with cinnamon sugar on it, and would be best dropped in boiling water for some added chewiness.  All five in my family agree this recipe is not a keeper.

Easy recipe, I liked them. Kids ate 6 of them in 15 minutes so they must have loved them. I followed the recipe exact. The only thing I did was to blot them on a paper towel before putting them on the parchment as another reviewer suggested. Try these, they are easier than you think!

These were pretty dang amazing as far as pretzels at home go!  Soft centers, chewy outsides, plus the authentic pretzel taste.  THE THINNER YOU GET THE DOUGH TO ROLL, THE BETTER THEY COME OUT!  I tried to go for big, thin pretzels, with dough the diameter of my finger.  My husband request the next batch be made with jalapenos and cheese.  I'll have to make another batch for myself with cinnamon and raisins and I'll make a nice icing glaze to drizzle on them!

Wonderful!  My house now officially smells like the mall.  The ONLY difference was that the outside wasn't crisp like the mall ones, but I might have put the butter on too soon.  Maybe if I wait  for 30 seconds to a minute, the crunch might hold.  Other than that, delicious and easy!

I had never tried to make pretzels before and these were so easy! Of course since it was my first time they did not come out looking like mall pretzels... I had trouble rolling them out long enough so they kinda clumped together and made pretzel- rolls. But they were awesome nonetheless. I made 6 pretzels, topped half with butter and coarse sea salt and the other half with butter and cinnamon and sugar. I did not change recipe at all. They did taste just like mall pretzels

Really fantastic!  Started this in the bread maker on dough setting, then rolled out.  I got tired of making the big pretzel shape so after about 8 of them I started rolling them in half and making twists, turned out really well! Hubby ate 6 in one evening of football!

So this is my first review of anything I have made off this website.  I felt I needed to review this one because of how pleased I was with the outcome!  I would consider myself an average cook/baker.  I decided to give this recipe a shot cause I was bored one night, and I am so glad that I did!  It was fantastic!!!  I didn't make any changes to the ingredients, I just let thing sit a little longer and only because I was doing other things at the time.  So I used my kitchen aid to knead the dough and it only took around 4 min.  I let the dough sit for about an 1 1/2 and let the pretzels sit out about another hour before baking.  Once out of the oven dipped in a little butter and cinnamon/sugar mixture.  Loved them.  Think I am going to try whole wheat flour next time.  Thanks Jeannie for sharing.

Yummy!  I made the dough in the bread maker, adding 1 tbsp of butter to it.  Instead of rolling out the traditional pretzel shapes, (was taking too long with a house full of children waiting patiently for their treat), so I made a large log, about 1" wide, and cut into pretzel 'buns'.  Kids LOVED them!  Took 1/4 of the time to shape and tasted yummy.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

These came out tasting very good and weren't hard to make.  We enjoyed them while they were warm but they started getting chewy as they cooled.  I also made them into pretzels sticks and nuggets to save time.  I'll have to try them with whole wheat flour too.  Great snack, thanks.

I'll keep this one simple. OMG = Oh My Good! I honestly didn't think these were going to turn out, but man did they ever! I will absolutely be making these again; and I did not change a thing with the recipe! Although I did just realize that I didn't let them rise before I baked them. Oh well! They turned out big, soft and YUMMY anyways!

These should be called disappearing pretzels 'cause mine were gone, gone, gone with the quickness.  Used regular salt to top instead of coarse since I didn't have it.  Followed recipe to a t.  Thanks for preventing me from having to spend 2 bucks a pop for these great bites.  Tip: dump everything into your bread machine, wet then dry (finishing with yeast) and set on dough cycle.  When cycle is done, divide and conquer these bad boys!  Lovin' it!

I can't stress enough how important it is to use that one cup of bread flour.  I typically start making these on spur of the moment and just use four cups of all purpose flour.  Four cups of AP flour makes them come out like pretzels you get at the ball park; tasty but a little tough.  Three cups of AP flour and one of bread flour makes them come out just fluffy enough to make you think you're eating a Hot Sam, which I suppose is why they're called Mall Pretzels.    Something else we do for kicks is to put 1.5-2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese in the dough... MMMMM, nummy.

These are dangerously good! I did what the top reviewer suggested and blotted the prezels with paper towel before laying them on a greased (not parchment lined) pan.  I used Pace's Nacho Cheese for dipping, wish I could find regular cheddar cheese sauce though.  I may never buy a mall pretzel again!

This is a very easy, basic recipe for soft pretzels, and my family liked them. I brushed them with water instead of butter so that they would have a harder crust. They baked up to a beautiful golden brown, and looked great! Thanks for the easy recipe!

These taste great.  May not be the same taste as the ones from like aunt Annie, but I think these taste better, less greasy or drench in Cinnamon sugar.  Very easily to customize to your own taste.

I MADE THIS YESTERDAY AND IT WAS A HUGE HIT! THEY CAME OUT VERY FLUFFY AND ONCE I SHAPED THEM IT TOOK ABOUT 1/2 HOUR FOR THE PRETZEL TO RISE AGAIN. I PUT IT IN A WARM OVEN(TURNED OFF) TO MAKE IT RISE FASTER AND IT WORKED. THE RESULT WAS GREAT! I COATED IT IN BUTTER AND A CINNAMON SUGAR MIXTURE. YUM! ***JUST A SIDE NOTE: STORE YEAST PACKETS IN THE FRIDGE. THEY STAY FRESHER FOR A LONGER AMOUNT OF TIME***

Oh my goodness! I did the dough in my bread machine (like I always do to cut down on my work!) and then followed the recipe from there. These were AWESOME. 12 weren't enough, so the second time I made them, I doubled the recipe. They were gone in 2 days.

I mixed everything in my Kitchenaid using the dough hook attachment and let it knead the dough for 8 minutes while my oven preheated to 200 degrees. I put the dough in an oiled bowl covered with a damp cloth and turned off the oven, then let the dough rise in there for an hour. I thought 3-foot ropes of dough was way too long, even for "mall pretzels." I used 1.5-foot ropes instead and cooked 10 minutes on foil, which worked perfectly fine. I tried some with cinnamon sugar but I preferred the pretzels with kosher salt. Very soft and tasty but time consuming.

Awesome Awesome Awesome, is all I can really say.  They were moist and perfect and so yummy!  Tasted just like the ones I wanted from the Pretzel Maker.  I'm pregnant and was craving them, but have to drive an hour to get one, so I thought I would find a recipe and I did and I am so happy about it.  I used marinara and melted velveeta cheese and it was perfect.  They were gone within seconds.  My family reccommended I make a triple batch next time.

This is a great recipe, *IF* you do not dip them in the baking soda. Instead, start a pot of water boiling with a teaspoon full of baking soda in it. Boil the pretzels until they float, then bake them. You can't skip the boiling process and have them come out right, in my opinion.

Wow!!! These were AMAZING!! My children and hubby have already gobbled the whole batch down (I made them 10 minutes ago). I took other reviewer's suggestions by dipping them in boiling baking soda water for 15 seconds, and also brushing them with egg right before baking. Also, I only had white wheat bread flour on hand, so I used that, and they turned out great. I did only use three cups of flour though, instead of four. We topped our pretzels w/ melted butter w/ kosher salt on half the batch and cinnamon sugar on the other half. Both were a hit!

These came out so good!  I followed the recipe as written, except I didn't roll the dough out as thinly.  I also doubled the baking soda and water solution and brought it to a boil and then dropped each unbaked pretzel into the boiling water/baking soda mix for about 20 seconds.  They baked up beautifully, and the outsides were the perfect color, glossy and just the right texture.  We have enjoyed other soft pretzel recipes, but the results that came from using this recipe and boiling before baking tops them all!  The boiling added an extra step. but it really was worth it!

Good, but not what I was looking for. These are definitely tasty but not the chewy, ballpark style that I think can only be achieved by boiling. I will try another recipe next time but altogether, not a bad recipe, just more breadlike than I wanted.

Last year (2006) I made these pretzels for National Pretzel Day (ya, we have one of those)... I made them for my Sunday School class. I had never made pretzels before but I thought... what the heck I can do this. They are awesome. I had to make more because my parents didn't get to try these, and my Sunday School kids are still talking about it this year wondering when I'll make these again. (Soon, I hope) Anyway, they're great. I toss all the ingredients into my bread machine and hit the start button on the dough cycle. Then 2 hours later I come back, pull the dough out and wrap it in seran wrap, then I toss it in the fridge for a bit. I'm not sure what the rules in the bread making world are but when I put the dough in the fridge it: 1. slows the rising process and 2. allows me to make the dough a few days in advance of baking them. Also, as an added bonus, it makes the pretzels easier to roll out. At any rate... I don't do a thing to this recipe as far as the ingredients are concerned and they always turn out great.

My kids loved these & begged me to make more the next day!  I would have given it 3 stars since I didn't think they tasted that great & came out too thin.  Watch your temp/time--mine didn't take as long--the first batch was too dark (but, kids ate anyways--gone within minutes) Will try making again, just rolling a little fatter next time.

Well, I actually found this identical recipe on another website not too long ago. I loved them and they taste a lot like the Auntie Anne's pretzels. I an sort of "challenged" when it comes to making the pretzel shape, so I just made pretzel "sticks."

This recipe was excellent.  I made it exactly as written and the dough was wonderful to work with.  The recipe was quick and easy - no problems with rolling out the dough. You really do have to roll them out pencil thin, though because they rise really well and if they are fatter they will probably make a pretzel knot instead. I always like to try the recipe as written first, and if it works or not, making changes if possible.  I can't wait till my next day off to make these with all kinds of seasonings! I also tried brushing them with the butter and salt before baking, but they come out much better if you just do the baking soda and water, and when they are done you put the melted butter and salt on them.

AMAZING recipe!  I made them in a few shapes, and as per my favorite pretzel place, I made them with a few different toppings...garlic powder and salt with ranch to dip it in is possibly my favorite. :)

I threw about six into the freezer in zip locs, hopefully they'll hold up and reheat well.  I plan to oven reheat them as another person suggested.

Be prepared for your hands to get a little sore when you roll it out...but otherwise, it's easy!

I made mine in a bread machine.  Just threw in the dough ingredients and set it.

The only thing I might suggest is using a damp cloth to cover the dough while you're rolling...the outside of the dough began to dry before I got the chance to go back and roll them more, so all of my pretzels had a slightly odd-looking texture from the dried dough being rolled further.  It didn't seem to affect the taste, nor the texture in my mouth, so it turned out just fine.

Yummm! I made these as "pizza" pretzels for dinner. I combined parmesan cheese, garlic POWDER,(garlic salt can make it too salty.), and Italian seasoning. After brushing my pretzels with melted butter I pressed them into the parmesan mixture and served with pizza sauce for dipping. It was soooo good. 
I also didn't want to make all 12 pretzels at once so I refridgerated 1/2 of the dough in a zip lock bag for later. I laid the bag on the counter to get closer to room temp. for a few hours and then shaped, let rise and bake. They turned out just as good as my first batch!

Tastes perfect. They don't keep well though. The next day they were very tough. Luckily they don't often make it to the next day.

I thought these were great Pretzels. I had a hard time getting the dough to roll out pencil thin..it kept shrinking back to a thicker roll but they were great anyway. (Note-I have now made these four times and the last time I had no problem rolling them out to about 2 feet which seems to be a good length). This is a fun recipe to make with Kids. My 5 year old daughter enjoyed helping mix, knead, roll and shape the pretzels. She thought it was great fun. I would recommend it as a kid project. We used the Butter and Kosher Salt but will try the cinnamon sugar mixture with some of our leftovers.
For those who gave it very low ratings-they must be doing something wrong. I have made them four times now with great results each time. I have followed the recipe to a T.  I also suggest like others to leave any you are not eating plain and add toppings later (squeeze butter is great for this).

YUMMMMMM! I thought these came out with a nice pretzely taste, but they didn't come out as good as the ones in the picture. They definately tasted good with a nice  soft fluffy texture. Next time I will work on my shaping. The flour was way too much so I omitted 1 cup. I used half bread flour and half all purpose flour. Since I have high blood pressure, I didn't use any salt. They were still tasty without it. I may use this recipe to make bagels or rolls next time. Thank you so much!!

Maybe there's a copyright issue here, these are like Auntie Anne's pretzels, not Wetzels.  I also make "pretzel dogs" with this recipe.  Just take a rope, wrap it around a Hebrew National  hot dog, dip in the soda water,  and bake til nicely browned.  Brush with butter.  The kids love them.

best soft pretzel recipe I've tried so far.  ordered pretzel salt from spicebarn.com and sprinkled after the baking soda bath--WOW!  make sure to shake off extra soda water before placing on parchment paper to prevent sticking.  quite tasty!

On the 2nd try I got it right the first batch would not rise. I got 8 medium size pretzels and 2 large(the size in the mall) and the larger ones were not as good as the medium size.
I am going to try this recipe again though, ad hopefully perfect it.

Excellet flavor! Everyone at work requests them. I discovered a few things.  If you brush on the soda water after the prezels have baked a few minutes they won't stick to the sheet, I brushed them several times on each side while baking instead of dunking them in it.  Also to make the shape more prezel like I made a small ball of dough into a large donut shape and twisted it into a pretzel from there.  Awesome recipe, will make again.

This produced a big old soft bread thingy that was VERY salty.  Not very pretzely.  Without the salt, there wasn't much taste to this either.  What Mall did you find these in?

Yum yum yum! So very tasty. I didn't have any bread flour so just used all plain flour, and just plain sugar, not brown. Still came out great! Before I baked them I spread some minced garlic, parmesan cheese and parsley on top of them and they turned out delicious, soft and chewy! Yep, just like the mall!

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but this recipe did not work for me at all.  Maybe I would've gotten better results if I had a bread machine or a dough hook attachment for my mixer, but if you're trying to do this by hand, be prepared for a sticky dough that very difficult to work with.  I even used olive oil while rolling but that did not work - it made the dough fall apart once it hit the waterbaking soda solution.  I'm going to buy the Auntie Anne's pretzel kit instead - where you just add water and bake.

If you're looking for the texture of Mall Pretzels then look no further; this seemed spot-on.  However, I was hoping for more of a Pretzel flavor ... unfortunately, for me, this was more of a breadstick than pretzel.  I'll continue to search for that recipe.

This recipe was so much fun for my 11-year old and I. We were a little clumsy shaping the first few, but once we got the hang of it, we were able to get them to look presentable. We used a cinnamon-sugar mixture on half, and garlic salt on the rest. Both varieties were wonderful, just like our favorites at the mall. One caveat, tho...these didn't keep well for us at all. We ended up throwing away the ones we had left the next day.

Yummy!!!  My first experience with making anything that included "active dry yeast" but they came out great!  But you know, kneading dough sucks!  It's hard work!  lol  Pretzels were kinda odd shaped, but they tasted great!  Seasoned with salt, garlic and parmesan and dipped in warm marinara sauce.  Also, mine tasted fine the next day.  I just sealed them tight in a plastic zip bag thingy and reheated for like 10 mins at 300 degrees.  Still good to me!

This was a great recipe to use for breadsticks, not really like pretzels (too light and 'fluffy').  We found that they were sticking to the parchment paper, so an idea would be to use a greased baking sheet instead of the paper.  Definitely the best on the first day.  :)  As for rolling out to 3 feet, we were able to do that and even longer.  We used the *note* and rolled them half way, let them rest, then rolled the rest of the way.  The less you handle the dough, the less stiff it becomes.

All malls are not the same.  Chewy is the key word here.  If that's your pretzel preference, you'll like these.  If you like the lighter mall pretzels, these will surely disappoint.

Was a little tricky to make and the taste was excellent, but the texture was not like mall pretzels that I have eaten. May or may not, depending on time, make again.

I loved these pretzels.  They were fun to make.  My 3 year old had more fun making them than eating them (I think).  Once they came out of the oven we spread them with butter and poured on the cinnamon-sugar...yummy!!

It's been raining quite a bit in Florida.  As a special rainy day activity, my daughter and I made Mall Pretzels.  The recipe was so easy and kid friendly.  The ingredients were very basic. We were able to make the pretzels from things that I already had in my cabinet.  No shopping for strange ingredients that you might only use once.  We had a ball!  We will definitely make these again.

My kids went crazy for these!  I made the dough on the dough-cycle of my breadmaker.  The rolling and shaping was somewhat of a nightmare, but all is well that ends well!  They weren't very pretty, but they were really good!

I make these for my students every year for Valentine's Day. I just pull the bottom of the pretzel to a point and the pretzels look like hearts! My students love them (me, too!); these are so yummy and easy and a nice change of pace from all the sugar kids get on V-Day!

We grew tired of paying the $2-$4.00 for frozen box pretzels and went on a hunt for a recipe. After reading all the reviews we decided to make these as is, no changes whatsoever in the recipe and they were amazing! We have made them several times since and they always turn out PERFECT! Thank you for this recipe. It has been entered into our family favorites cookbook and is sure to be cherished for many years to come!

Excellent recipe, except the salt should be added in the flour step and not before.   After forming into pretzel shapes, you should allow it to at least double in size.

A friend and I had never made pretzels. This recipe was easy and the results were great.

I have been making this recipe for the past few years. It is NOT neccessary to boil them in a baking soda bath. I make these the "easy way". I use my bread machine on the dough setting. Once the dough is ready I roll the pretzels out in lots of fun shapes and do a quick dip in the baking soda bath. I then let them rise for a little while in an unheated oven. They are amazing the day of baking.

OMG wow! These are phenomenal! I made them a lil smaller (16 pretzels), cooked time at 5 minutes and left them in the warm oven for 30sec-1min after I turned the oven off.
Also let the yeast proof for 10 minutes before adding the flour.
ALSO, I made the 3 flavours! I added Parmesan cheese to the garlic salt ones and the cinnamon/sugar ones didn't last long at all!!! Definitely a keeper!

These pretzels are great, but don't taste as good once they have cooled. Thankfully they disappear pretty quickly. The double twist is key for getting the right shape. I sprinkled mine with Maldon sea salt and they were even better.

PERFECT - For a healthy 'twist' (haha!) used  2 cups of regular flour, 1 1/2 cups (or so) of whole wheat flour, and 1/2 cup (or so) of ground flax. Took another reviewer's advice and boiled them for a minute or so in the baking soda water, then blotted off the water before baking. This step made all the difference in the world. Made salt, cinnamon sugar, and cheese flavored. Mmm Mmm good!

Pretty good tasting recipe.  Not hard to make.  Next time I might try an egg wash instead of brushing with butter.  The real mall pretzels still taste better, but this is a good substitute.

totes amaze!! I have to say that I wasnt expecting much and my first lot of dough came out harder than a rock...but on the second, I doubled the yeast(nothing else) and they came out great! Apart from proving that I lack the talent to make the pretzel design! Great, great, great! Will make again!

This was my first time making pretzels and they came out perfectly.  I did use unbleached all-purpose flour because that's what i had on hand.  My family LOVED them.  I'll make these again, very soon.

IMPRESSIVE!  I've not reviewed a recipe before, but felt the need to with this one.  I've not baked bread products before so I wasn't sure what kind of yeast to buy - I chose quick rise, instant dry yeast.  I used 4 cups of all purpose flower.  I lightly buttered my pan instead of using parch. paper.  The rest I did exactly as printed.  Had no issues with dough problems, and the baking process worked great for me.  Awesome recipe!  My son loves these, but after I paid $4 for one at the mall, I decided to look for my own recipe. Thanks for sharing!!

TERRIBLE!! I made them and put them in for the said time but they were doughy on the inside and crispy burned on the outside.  Use less of the wash mixture.

I have been making this recipe for years, and my husband gets excited whenever I do.  We've made pretzels, we've braided pepperoni into them, we've let the kids shape dough into teddy bears.  They all work great.  When I used this dough to make calzones, we knew we wouldn't go back to regular pizza dough.  This recipe is much more flexible for rolling and folding, and the baking soda mix crisps the outside beautifully!  We can make a calzone with a thinner crust without risking a tear, giving us a fabulous product with fewer calories.

If you have a stoneware baking pan, you'll end up with a much better finish than if you use metal.

not just like the mall, but close enough and I'm sure there's less preservatives.  I use this often as a bread for a loaf sandwich, like a rueben loaf found on this site.

Excellent recipe. I had to use whole wheat flour in place of bread flour, otherwise used all-purpose. Used 1/4 cup of baking soda in a pot of gently boiling water instead of a warm wash (technique of another recipe). I also made bites instead of the classic shape, baked for 15-18 min.
Next time:
I'd make smaller bites, as they get large in the boiling water. 
Use spray butter instead of dipping (to make the salt/sugar stick) because it soaks the pretzel too much.
I might separate a bit of dough in the beginning for the cinn/sugar dip because the dough is a little salty by the end of the process.
Overall, great tasting results!

These are so yummy! So much more cost efficient to make then to pay like $3 at the mall for one.  The dough can be tricky to roll out, so mine weren't the prettiest, but who cares when they taste so good!  Made these for valentine's day in heart shapes! I will definitely be keeping this as my main pretzel recipe.

Eh.  I didn't think these were great.  I thought they were somewhat bland and kind of tough instead of chewey...and I definitely didn't overcook them.  Will try another recipe next time.  My favorite topping was actually probably garlic salt.  (I did cinnamon sugar, garlic salt, and kosher salt).  I also may do sticks next time instead of the regular pretzel shape.  It would make more and would be easier for the little ones to eat.

Fantastic! Have been searching for the perfect pretzel recipe and my search is finally over!I threw all the ingredients in my bread machine and let it do the mixing . I used LANINACALIMAR's suggestion for boiling the pretzels in the water/baking soda before baking. The dough is fantastic. I made 8 with sea salt and 4 cinnamon sugars. Thank you Jeannie!

I have made perfect pretzels with this recipe every time, with these changes;

Add barely malt extract (1 tablespoon) to the recipe.

 I so boil the water and baking soda mixture then add the pretzels while mixture is boiling. (IMPORTANT: add soda and water before boiling)
When removing I put on a towel so the excess water drips.

Also I brush a white egg wash (1 tablespoon water and one egg white whisked together) after boiling.

Then I brush butter over them. 

Put on a pan sprayed with Pam or other cooking spray. (they slip off just fine) 

This recipe can also be used for great bagels!

I have tried pretzel recipes before with no success-until now!!  These pretzels were great.  Instead of shaping them, I cut them into sticks and made some cinnamon and some salt.  Be sure and knead for 8 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic!

5 STARS BY FAR!! You have to kneed the dough for 10 min at least. I allowed the dough to rise for 2 hr. I used less flour as well, and added as needed. I will never buy the Pretzle Maker pretzles Ever Again! This recipe is a dead ringer. Even my super picky husband loved them. I could not stop raving about this recipe Thank you Jeannie for posting this. 

Now if I could only find the honey mustard dipping sauce from Pretzle Maker! hmmmmmmm

These were the best tasting things that I have ever made! And simple, to boot! Placing the dough in the bread machine made it easier than I anticipated. The hardest part was learning to shape them. They come out of the oven hard on the outside, but adding the butter instantly softens them up and make them stay soft. I added myriad toppings, such as garlic salt on some (my personal favorite), salt and pepper on others, plain salt, Parmesan cheese, sugar and cinnamon, cumin and coriander and fennel. What a lovely recipe!

4 out of 5 because the dough is so perfect its not even funny.  The baking method is missing some steps to make them authentic tasting though.  After I rolled my pretzels to shape, i boiled them individually just until they start to puff up in a mixture of 4 Cups water, 2.5 tablespoons of baking soda. At first I tried someone elses suggestion of 4 cups to 4 tablespoons, but they tasted aweful, like chemical salt, 2.5 seemed to do the trick without being overpowering.  Salt with coarse salt immediately after removing from the water and bake for about 13 minutes at 400F, top rack of the oven, on parchment paper or a sil pad so the bottoms dont burn. While still hot baste with melted butter and/or your garlic, cinnamon whatever seasoning you prefer.

These were perfect! 
My childhood friend came over and we spent an afternoon making pretzels. 
We did make one change, though: we dipped the rolled-out ropes in the soda water and then formed the pretzels. We found this was easier than dipping formed pretzels into the soda water, as is suggested by the recipe. 
Also, just a note for those who are new to baking bread items: place the buttered bowl of rising dough on top of your warming oven. (And put the remaining dough there, too, while you're baking successive batches.)

The taste was awesome.  Making the actual pretzel turned out to be a bit more complicated than I would have like, but by the last 4, I had it down.

These do taste just like the pretzels in the mall!  We served them along  with a honey-cream cheese glaze.     About a 1 to 1 ratio for honey and whipped cream cheese.  I will definitely make these again and wouldn't hesitate to serve them to guests.

5 stars on taste! I did have problems with the directions to roll them 3 feet long. When I did this, I ended up with thin, large pretzels that overcooked in 8 min. I would suggest only about 2 feet long to end up with a more appropriate-sized pretzel that takes about 6-8 min to cook. I will probably make these again this weekend, b/c they are delicious and my family is EASILY going to eat all of these tonight.  I topped this batch in cinnamon-sugar, salt, and garlic salt, respectively. Each were delicious, but cinnamon sugar was our least favorite. We bought canned nacho cheese sauce to dip our salty pretzels in and it is just SO yummy! Hubby has already requested that I wrap some pretzel dough around a jalapeno cheese dog when I make the next batch!

These were good. I made them in bite size form instead of the pretzel as quite a few people were going to eat them. I would make these again.

Awesome and easy, I made dinner rolls out of the dough and it was a big hit, all you have to do is shape them into balls instead of the preztle shape. rolls are great for burgers.

Awesome recipe!  It was my first time making pretzels and I'm VERY pleased with how they turned out.  I mixed them in a Kitchen Aid Mixer, let the dough rest until doubled in size.  I then rolled them out, dipped in the water/soda solution and briefly put them on a paper towel before placing on a baking sheet.  I sprinkled them the salt and let them rest while the oven heat.  Thanks for sharing such an awesome recipe!

I made this pretzel with Whole Wheat Grain flower, using 3/4Cup + 2 TBSP for each cup of white flower instead.  I used my Kitchenaid to make it, and my kids LOVE it.  It is their first exposure to pretzels, they are soft and yummy.  I made some with sea salt, some with Cinnamon sugar.  I also made them smaller, so they go longer and are less calories.

First time making pretzels and these turned out wonderfully! I used all all-purpose flour because I didn't want to go buy bread flour and they turned out fine. I had to cook in two batches and before the second batch went in, I brushed it with a beaten egg and it came out nice and golden brown. Also, be sure to let the dough rise really well the first time -- let it double! After you punch it down, be careful not to overwork it. My 7 year old sister made the first batch with me, and they were tougher because they'd been rolled more the second time.

These are awesom!!! But I noticed that nobody has mentioned the dipping/other toppings! I used to work at a pretzel stand in the mall YEARS ago and we were very famous for our "Veggie cream cheese topping. (room temp cream cheese, some sweet green & red peppers and and a little bit of fresh radish, all diced very fine. mix in well and chill.) Spread on top of warm pretzel. OMG awesom!! also Ragu has a jarred cheddar cheese sauce, warmed its great for dipping.Also very popular was "grey pupon mustard" with warm pretzel. You guys gotta live a little & try it!! Everyone is sure to find a favorite! Bon a petit.

Unless I did something wrong mine ended up like soft chewy buns- tasted yummy but Its not the pretzel I wanted- also I agree with others when they say the salt won't stick to the butter- I had salt all over the place!

I have teenage boys (who LOVE pretzels). I made two different recipes from this site. This recipe was the WINNER!!!! My sixteen years old requested I make these again this weekend. I used the parchment paper on the first batch (the pretzels stuck) the next batch, I used Pam spray on my baking sheet... they came out perfect!!! I will be making these again and again... Thanks for sharing ....

Great recipe, between my two kids and the neighbor kids, husband and myself they were gone in seconds! Very soft and chewy! Very easy to make with my kitchen aid mixer. I recommend putting butter on before cooking and after cooking with salt! Oh and next time I will double the recipe for more goodness!

They tasted exactly like pretzels at the mall. The dough was a little difficult to roll into strips. I kneaded it for 8 minutes. Probably a little less kneading would have been better.

I am very glad I used this recipe in my endeavor to make pretzels. The dough was very easy to work with, although it did take a few tries to get the actual dough to look like a pretzel. Ha! I did not have parchment paper to bake on, so I substituted for wax paper. Next time, I'll more than likely use a regular greased cookie sheet, or grease the wax paper. 
I did not roll them as thin as the directions say, and I am wondering if the texture would change that much if (next time) I did in fact get them as thin as a pencil. Regardless, the taste is lovely. I made some with cinnamon sugar and some with coarse sea salt.
All in all, I am very pleased with this recipe and will use it again!

Made these and brought them into work. Everyone loved them. They are best served right away, though. Heating in the microwave makes them a little tough. Would be better to reheat in a toaster oven.

I made the dough in my bread maker and then followed the rest of the recipe. Turned out perfect! So yummy! Just like the mall ones.

These pretzels are amazing.  They're a little more work than going to the mall, but definitely worth it.  I served them with a home made cheese sauce, apple sauce and mustard for dipping.

I loved this.  I have never had a pretzel from the mall to compare to,  but these were good.  The only change i made was, I used egg whites to brush the tops and i salted them before cooking.  I only think these are good fresh.  I had one the next day and they were very tough and chewy.

These are really good.  I hadnât made them before and made them a little thicker than the recipe stated only because I like the thick, bready pretzels.  I did make them a tad too thick, however they still had that wonderful pretzel flavor.  I also followed another reviewerâs advice that after dipping them in the soda water, placing them on paper towels for a brief moment to avoid the puddles on the parchment paper.  I will be making these again.

I have always wanted to try using soda, and now it is out of my system. There was no real flavour with this, just a very syrupy sweetness.

So fun! I made with my sisters since one really loves the mall pretzel.  She was quite impressed. My 5 yr old loved getting the dough, rolling it out, and making his own pretzel. It was a little tricky getting the strip long enough but work with gravity. It helps speed things up. Even if using a pizza stone, put some parchment down. My 5 yr old is already asking to make again.

I loved these Pretzels a lot, but I'm giving only four stars because the Pretzels didn't have the same dense texture as the ones sold at the malls. Next time I won't let the dough rise too long, and bake'em sooner so they come out denser. Overall it's a great recipe!

The water temp needs to be at 155 to 165 degrees.   I added 2 cups of bread flour and 2 cups of all purpose flour.   Great quick recipe that tastes wonderful.

I did not have brown sugar or bread flour, so I used all AP flour, and I used 1/4 cup of honey.  Turned out great!  I followed the recipe exactly otherwise, with no problems.

I followed the instructions exactly. They were ok but not great. They didn't brown for me after 8-10 min. I had to butter them and put them under the broiler for a few min to get them to brown and they didn't really taste like pretzels to me. They just tasted like chewy bread. I will just try a different recipe next time I try making pretzels.

I boiled half of mine in 4 cups water and 4 TBS baking soda until they floated. They were much chewyer this way. The other half I did as the recipe called for and they ended up with crispy tops.  I put sugar on before baking and it was basically gone after baking-maybe I'll put it on after next time.  Great recipe! Thanks!

These do taste very close to the mall version.  The tough part is to get them shaped just right.  It is important to make them as thin as possible so they bake without puffing up to form one big "bun".  I dipped the rope into the water bath then twisted them and it was much easier.  The parchment paper is a must also.  I will make again!

These were great!  I agree with other reviewers, though, and recommend immersing the pretzels in boiling the pretzels for 30 or so, until they float to the top.  This makes a huge difference in the final product.    I also brush the baking sheet with a bit of butter and brush butter/sprinkle salt on the pretzels before baking.  These freeze and reheat beautifully.

The best ever!! Had a craving for pretzels like at the mall and decided to give this a try. I substituted 1 cup sourdough starter for 1 cup cup water, 1 cup flour and the yeast. Let rise for at least 2 hours, longer if needed. These came out so delicious I'm about to make them again today!! Thanks! (Tastes great sprinkled in garlic powder and dipped in warm cream cheese!)

These came out perfectly.  The kids gobbled them up instantly.  My 1 yr old ate 3 of them.  Update:  I made them again today and they were even better.  Don't know what I did differently but no one can get enough of them.  I made a sugar, butter and cinnamon drizzle to pour over some of them, then topped them with whipped cream and a drizzle of chocolate sauce.  I also used some nacho cheese as a dipping sauce.  Either way they were the most delicious pretzels I have ever had.  The kids helped roll them too.

Great recipe - easy to follow. Entire family loved the pretzels.  The outside didn't come out crispy (not sure they were supposed to),  but otherwise, they were perfect and yummy.

These are very good.  It is very close to the recipe Bobby Flay used on the Throwdown show.  I threw the ingredients in my bread machine on the dough setting.  I put it on a lightly floured surface and cut into 6 pieces (I only made a half recipe).  It was kind of hard to roll out. They were very thick.  I might try one of the suggestions and roll, then let it rest and go back to it.  I boiled 4 cups of water and added 4 tsp baking soda.  I dropped in for a few seconds and then put on a greased cookie sheet.  I let it rise for 20 minutes in a warm oven.  I brushed it with an egg wash and put cinnamon and sugar on some and salt on others.  Then baked for 12-15 minutes in a 425 degree oven.  They were very thick (my fault for not rolling it out more) but tasted very good.  Will definately make again, but next time with all purpose flour.

These are fabulous!!! I have made them a few times and every time they are just as good. These pretzels do not stay on the counter very long.  Thanks for sharing!!

They were ok...  I definately don't think they tasted like pretzels at the mall...  I followed the recipe exactly too...  Its a long process and I wasn't thrilled with the results...

I tried immersing half of the pretzels in hot water as suggested in the recipe. The other half I immersed in 4 cups of boiling water with 4 Tbsp. baking soda until they floated to the top, as suggested in some of the reviews. The pretzels that were in the boiling water turned out much chewier. The pretzels that were only immersed in hot water had a texture like ordinary bread.

I was concerned at first because I had a little trouble with the dough being too elastic but the flavor was really quite good.  I found this recipe to be pretty time consuming for twelve pretzels though.  Topped half with kosher salt and half with cinnamon sugar.  Both were tasty.

My family loved these.  I followed the recipe except I used regular all purpose flour for all 4 cups in the recipe.  I also used the dough hook on my kitchen aid for the kneading and let the dough rise longer than suggested.  After I rolled and dipped the first pretzel I realized the next one rolled more easily - maybe because my hands were a bit wet.  My kids didn't have any trouble rolling the pretzels, we had a really fun time together.  Thanks for a great recipe, I think I'll be making them again today!

Good, but not like the ones from the mall. However, my dough didn't rise that much and these pretzels were still a bit too dense. Could have been my fault (which is why i gave it 4 star instead of 3). The dough itself is very easy to work with. I managed to pull 2.5' ropes with the thickness of a marker. I followed someone else's recommendation about BOILING the dough in baking soda/water for 1 minute and the crust came out pretty darn pretzel-ish. I notice that the bottoms looked more browned (almost to the point of being burnt) so next time, I will flip the pretzels over after baking 5 minutes for a nice even brown look. I will definitely make them again!

Sooo good. Don't leave out the boiling stage, that's what makes them chewy! Sprinkled with coarse kosher salt, they are divine. Enjoy with a tall beer :)

I made these a few months ago. How good does that look! Anyway, I loved them. And I will let you all in on a secret...the first batch I made was like the recipe said, Pretzels. Then I had some dough left over and I didn't feel like using it for pretzels. So I deep fried the dough balls and made little doughnuts or fair style zeppoles and added powdered sugar. Excellent if u want to use the dough for two differnt things.

I'm editing my review. The first time I made these, they were okay. I made them again and made the following changes - I used all purpose flour for the bread flour, used 2 tsp salt instead of brown sugar and salt, sprinkled kosher salt prior to baking. I sprayed Pam on the baking sheets instead of using parchment paper. Also, I set a small bowl of water on the bottom rack and baked for about 18min using my convection bake setting. After they finished baking, I lightly brushed melted butter on pretzels and added sprinkled more kosher salt on top. These pretzels were great tasting. Brought them to an Oktoberfest party and everybody loved them.

Mmmm.  I didn't have much time or patience when I made these, and even if I did, am not sure I ever could have rolled these into 3 foot ropes, so mine were short, round, and extremely puffy once they baked.  I also boiled the pretzels in the soda water briefly instead of dipping, and used an egg wash instead of butter to adhere the salt.  Chewy and satisfying, although next time I'll get help rolling them out.

These pretzels were great!!  The texture was fantastic, and the crust was great.  I boiled them for a few seconds in baking soda/h2o solution, and split the batch in half- they were great. I have made pretzels at home before and they couldn't compare to these.   Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is awesome! The only change I made was to use the breadmaker's dough setting to make the dough. The editor's tip about rolling them out halfway then coming back to the first one was very helpful. The pretzels were really easy to roll out and shape that way. The pretzels looked great and tasted wonderful. I'm making them again tomorrow with cinnamon sugar, can't wait!

very good and fairly easy when all the work is done in my bread machine.  Make sure your pretzel shapes are large enough so they don't touch and look like one big blob when baked ( still taste great though!)  Will make again and pass it on!!

The dough is fantastic. The only thing I do differently: I dump 1/4 cup baking soda into a pot of boiling water. Before I baking, I put each pretzel in until it floats (about 5-10 seconds). These are best fresh, but still good the day after if you microwave for about 15 seconds.

I am living in Sweden and you can not find soft pretzels here at all! So, I decided to make some myself and found this recipe. It is great!! It satisfies my yearning for a mall pretzel from back home! I added just a little more sugar and salt and I also put the corse salt on before baking while they are still sticky the finer salt will stick after backing but not the corse stuff. I found that you only need 1 cup of water and 1 tablespoon of baking soda, anymore is a waste of baking soda. These are wonderful and addictive and very easy to make! I highly recommend giving them a try!

This is a great recipe.  The dough is very easy to work with.  The tip about letting the ropes rest before you finish rolling them out is key.  They stretch a lot better, once they've sat out for about 10 minutes.  They don't taste exactly like the mall pretzels, but they sure are yummy!   Especially brushed with melted butter and garlic salt.

YUMMY!!! My daughter and I made these today and they are super delicious. They are also extremely easy to make. We had a bit of a tough time rolling the dough out though, but I read that that may be because we didn't knead and/or let the dough rise long enough. Even so, the pretzels turned out fantastically. I used the "jump rope" method of getting the dough into a long rope since we were having trouble rolling the dough. ("Jump Rope" method means I rolled the dough out a bit and then, while holding each end, gently and carefully flung the dough up and down hitting the counter top on the down fling. This allowed me to get the dough in a long rope). We will definitely be making these a lot!!!! Thank you, Jeannie, for this wonderful recipe!!!

uuuuum! this is so good. the recipe is easy to follow. great recipe for a bread maker newbie, personally i'm just 14 and i found this recipe simple.once my siblings got there hand son these, they were gone in a second. even had to fend them off so that mom and dad could get one. but i would omit the wax paper and lightly grease the pan. my pretzels stuck with the wax. i also recommend a light egg wash coating to help the pretzels brown.

I will never attempt to make pretzels again. This dough was impossible to roll out and I ended up just chucking the whole thing at the wall. Total waste of ingredients. :(

Don't be intimidated by other reviewers...these are awesome and easy! Made these for a football game with husband and brothers and were the perfect game food. Put in the extra elbow grease to knead the dough if you don't have a kitchen aid it's worth it.

This is a wonderful recipe.  My kids and I made these one afternoon, during their school break.  Not only did we all enjoy ourselves, but we have made plans to make these again.  The kids had a blast making different shapes, and they were delicious as well.  I also made a whole bunch of bite sized ones for snacking, and plan on making these for future parties!

I made these this past weekend and they turned out great. I used bread machine yeast so I didn't proof it first, that's the only ingredient substitution I used. I used my bread machine's dough cycle to mix, knead, and raise the dough. It came out perfectly and was easy to shape into pretzels. They tasted great, can't ask for any more than that.

Great!  I took some of the dough, rolled it out into long strands, and wrapped it around hot dogs before dipping in the soda water and baking. My husband said they tasted just like pretzel dogs from the mall.  I didn't use parchment, just a lot of Pam, and they came off the pan fine.

I doubled the batch because the first time we made these it was a lot of work and not enough profit!  I also used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose.  Delightful!

I made these for my family, and they were freaking perfect. The last few weren't as good because I had to cook them three at a time and the dough got kind of wonky, but they were still good. We were going to save some for the next day, but we ended up eating them all. I only wish we had some cheese sauce to go with them. I'm totally keeping this reicpe and making it all the time. Thanks!

Turned out great.  I didn't use parchment paper but greased sheets and worked out just fine for me.  I had a few left over and placed them in freezer in freezer bags.  We warmed them in microwave and tasted just like fresh baked.  Definitely a family favorite recipe to keep.  Thanks!

This is the best recipe for pretzels.  My husband found it and made it first. We've since made it many times. I like them dunked in melted butter and then in cinnamon-sugar. Hubby likes them salted. Excellent recipe.

Made these as an after school snack/activity and they turned out great!  Read the previous reviews and to eliminate potential sogginess, I sprinkled kosher salt on the pretzels after dipping in the baking soda/water prior to baking (skipped the melted butter entirely).  Pretzels stayed chewy.  Thanks for a fun recipe!

These were very delicious-not exactly like the mall pretzels that I am used to but still good. I also need a little help with the shaping of the pretzel. Mine came apart when I dipped them in the water/baking soda. I will keep trying.

I used a bread machine to mix the dough and initially I thought this would be a failure because the dough was very sticky. However, I let it rise for an hour and turned it out onto a greased silicon baking sheet. Instead of adding more flour, coat your fingers and the dough with a little oil to prevent sticking. I did all the rolling and baking on the silicon sheets. The pretzels did not stick at all and cleaning up the counter was a breeze.

This is a great pretzel recipe which definitely gave results as good as if not better than an actual mall bought pretzel. 
As a side note, I wouldn't recommend making this dough in a breadmaker; I have tried three times now with very limited success. But by hand these pretzels turned out very nice indeed; soft, light and squishy.
We'll use this recipe every time now for pretzels. 
Also as an additional sweet topping, try mixing brown sugar and a small amount of cinnamon powder together - delicious!

These tasted great, but mine stuck to the parchment paper like another reviewer said and I had to throw more than half away! I think I will just grease the pan next time and try again! Thanks for a good recipe.

Good. I always thought homemade pretzels would be difficult to make, but these were very easy.I didn't roll them out pencil thin, they were probably about as thick as my finger. I only let them rise about 10 minutes before putting them in the oven. They came out perfect in 8 minutes.

A yummy low-fat snack.  My sixteen year old sister and I had a great time making these.  The younger kids ate them all up the next day.  We did half with garlic butter(our favorite) and half cinnamon sugar.  We made some smaller ones, and laid them on a greased baking sheet-they came off with no problem.  Also, baking them the first four min on the bottom of the oven gave them a crisp bottom, and then we moved them up to the top to get a golden brown finish.  Very yummy, and we will make them again and again.

These are excellent pretzels!  They are a sweet pretzel like Auntie Anne's (in the mall).  My family devoured them!  I went strickly by the recipe.  I think it is important that you use the 1 cup of bread flour.  It makes them chewier.  I bought sweet(unsalted) butter to dip them in after they baked and then used the cinnoman and sugar.  The only problem I encountered was trying to shape them like a pretzel.  After the 2nd or 3rd one, I didn't do too bad.  I also rolled some in rod shapes.  Make sure you don't overbake.  They should be a light golden brown.

This recipe made great pretzels.  I baked them and then froze them.  When my children wanted them for a snack, I put butter on the frozen pretzels and sprinkled seasoning on them (a mixture of parmesan, garlic and salt are our favorite) and baked them at 400F for about 10 minutes.  They are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

These are fantastic. Instead of using the baking soda solution I used 2 tbsp salt and boiling water. I made cinnamon-sugar pretzels and regular salted pretzels, and both were delicious.

These are so phenomenal!!! I can't believe how good and chewy these were. I made them with salt and with cinnamon/splenda mix. Both are awesome. I'm going to make this into a tradition at our house - maybe once a month. The kids will love to knead the dough and it only takes 8 minutes, so it's a very good recipe for them. Didn't take that long from start to finish, so it's a quick reward for the little ones. The taste is just like a mall pretzel - maybe even better since I like the dough-ey nature of them and I made them extra fat by not stretching them as much. You can make these into all sorts of fun shapes as well, twisty breadsticks or maybe a double heart for valentine's day. Very fun!!! Thank you!! To those whose pretzels didn't turn out right, I'm wondering if you used the right temp of water. Yeast can be a fickle thing - make sure your water is the right temp and let your dough rise in a semi-warm place for the FULL hour. The investment is worth it! Also, I only had bread flour on hand - so I used all 4 cups of it and it worked beautifully.

This recipe is the best! I was a little nervous about it since some said it was difficult but it was easy enough for me to do with my 2 year old and autistic 5 year old sons plus I am 8 1/2 months pregnant!  I made up the dough and we watched a video then we all rolled them out, baked them, and had a wonderful snack.  The boys had a blast and loved eating theirs with cin. sugar and I sprinkled mine with grated parmesan --yummy!!

These were tasty and my kids liked them, but I still don't think they come close to what you get at Aunt Annie's or those places.  It is probably my skill, or lack thereof, I should say.  When I dipped these in the baking soda mixture, they started dissolving in my hands.  The dip had to be an extremely fast one. And beware, I was working on my kitchen table, and didn't bother to immediately wipe up the baking soda drips, and they actually ate into and discolored the finish.

Awesome recipe. Everyone loves these pretzels. They are fantastic. Just remember to use the parchment paper, you can get away with using a non-stick spray but the paper works great. I will be making these pretzels a lot thanks for the recipe!

This is an excellent recipe! Delicious and fun to make. To cut down the calories a bit, I brushed the pretzels with fat-free egg substitute and sprinkled them with salt before baking.

OMG!  These are wonderful!  Make sure to roll them out thin (pencil width) because they really rise in the oven.  They are incredible, though, and my kids loved them.  Had company drop by while I was pulling them out of the oven and no one could stop eating them.  Great recipe for making with the kids!  A definite keeper!

Yummy. I just finished making these for my son's preschool class. Easy and quick,  by not without fault.  I didn't have problems rolling them out but here's a tip for people who do.  lightly grease the rolling service and hands with shorting,  and roll the pretzels so that they are twisting,  It's seemed to make them stronger when I lifted them to twist.  Plus do not,  bake the pretzel on the parchment paper.  I had to take the 1st batch out early because I was smoking so bad that all my smoke alarms went off my apartment. plus all the pretzels stuck to the paper.  All in all the pretzets are great. and I got to test all of the smoke dectectors.  Good luck ya'll.  Lulu.

Not that I thought these tasted like mall pretzels, nonetheless Jeannie, they were yummy! I made four salted, four garlic and four cinnamon and sugar. I guarantee my girls will have the cinnamon for breakfast. I, however, enjoyed the garlic pretzel as my dinner tonight along with a beer!

These were good pretzels but NOT mall pretzels (a bit breadier).  But still very good.  I used both cinnamon-sugar and salt toppings and cheese and melted chocolate dips with them for a party and they were enjoyed by all.

Followed all the reviewers advice and had fabulous pretzels. Used the bread machine for kneading, well sprayed air bake pan worked great, put salt on before baking, didn't roll a full 3 feet, ate hot out of the oven and everyone enjoyed. Try this, instead of brushing with butter, serve hot pretzels with dishes of melted butter or WHITE ALMOND BARK for dipping. That added to the fun. Thanks everyone for the tips.

Easy to throw together, and tastes SO good.  Set aside enough time to roll them out; it's worth it, but it takes a while!

WOW!!  These are the best pretzels I've ever had!  These are even better than any mall or storebought pretzel I've ever had, and my family agrees.  The hardest part was getting the dough to be 3 feet long, and I dont think that I ever actually made it to 3 feet, but that was okay ;) .  I made these for the first time tonight for part of our New Years Eve stacking, and everyone raved about them.  I might make these again tomorrow!  They're so good!!  It seems that this would be an excellent breadstick recipe as well.  This is a *MUST* try!

I have tried several pretzel recipes that claimed to be "mall pretzels" and none have ever came close until I tried this recipe. They are so much cheaper than buying them at the mall, and taste exactly like them! Plus, you can experiment with add-ins and toppings. I tried adding italian seasoning to the dough before rolling and topping the pretzels with a little coarse salt, parmesan, and garlic powder...dip in marinara...MMMM!!! Also decided to forgo the parchment. Sprayed the pans with Pam and had few probs with sticking.

I made these for my friends and they loved them. I would recommend putting the topping (salt, garlic powder, or whatever else you would like) on before you cook it.  The flavor sticks better and it also hold on to the prezel better then after.  Also i tried a batch with Cinnamon and raisins in it, i then sprinkled Cinnamon and sugar on top and everyone loved those!

I messed the recipe up from the getgo by only adding 3 cups all purpose flour, I didn't see that the recipe also calls for 1 cup bread flour and by the time I noticed I had already finished kneading my bread and I couldn't be bothered to start over. Anyways, I followed the recipe to a T there on out and the pretzels turned out amazing! I love them. Everyone loves them. They are fantastic. I personally like mine more doughy than crunchy. I find that the pretzels tend to look fully cooked at 10 or 11 minutes but are actually a bit over baked. For the second half  of the recipe I only let them in for 8 minutes and they were fully cooked and nice and fluffy - not over baked.

I wish I had watched the video first, because I immediately added the brown sugar & salt instead of letting the yeast sit for 10 minutes as the video instructed. I made these per the written instructions except I used my new kitchen aid mixer to knead the dough. They turned out perfect, crunchy on the outside and perfectly chewy on the inside. As another reviewer suggested, after dipping them  in the baking soda bath, I flipped them onto a paper towel then immediately flipped them on the cookie sheet.  I have cruddy cookie sheets so I had to use the parchment paper, but if I had better pans, I would not have used it. 8 minutes in the oven was the right amount of time in the oven.  I will definitely make these again.

I used the ingredients and then read the reviews.  One told me I should dip the formed pretzels in boiling baking soda solution.  Great idea, took me a minute to figure out why but it worked.  But the same review then told me to bake at 225 degrees for 20 minutes.  Not even close.  The original temp of 450 degrees for 20 minutes worked best.  Pencil size?  Nope.  Roll them about 1/2" thick so you can only fit 6 on a cookie sheet (big one) and grease that bugger or they will stick.  

Overall, great recipe, just a little off on the baking process but my wife and kids loved them!!!!

Made these with my 8 and 10 year old daughters today and they turned out awesome! Followed the recipe exactly. My daughters quickly figured out the best way to make the rope. Think pizza dough rather than bread dough: twirl them like a jump rope or spin vertically between your palms. (rolling on the counter didn't work) Didn't boil before baking, just the dip in the baking soda bath as described. We covered some with salt, some with cinnamon and sugar and some with parmesan cheese. All yummy! Thanks!

These are great and my kids love them! I followed the recipe to the letter and I thought they turned out perfectly. I will try boiling them next time as others have suggested. ONE IMPORTANT TIP: PARCHMENT PAPER AND WAX PAPER ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS!!! Many people complained of their pretzels sticking to the wax paper... and they certainly will... every time! I use parchment paper all the time for baking and virtually nothing sticks to it.

My son wanted to make pretzels, we had a snow day (yes, in Atlanta!), so we tried these.  They were fantastic.  Having read some of the reviews, we doubled the water/soda solution, which was a good choice.  We didn't roll them out as much as it said - bad plan!  Flavor, of course, wasn't affected, but we were surprised at how they grew in the oven.  We didn't really want them to be HUGE, but we should've made them bigger than we did.  Oh, well, live and learn.  He was also worried about the ones he rolled out, which didn't roll out as nicely mine, being more experience, but once baked, it really didn't matter.  We couldn't tell who had made which ones.  We did laugh about trying to figure out "pretzel" shapes - twisting them was fun and funny.  Great project for "together" time and learning.

These were DELISH.  My friend didn't want to struggle through the rope-making, so we just did pretzel bites. And they were amazing.  The favorite dip was the ground mustard, but everyone loved them!  Kids, adults, dogs...deliciousness for all!

I used this recipe to make pretzel rolls instead of the usual fun shape, and I used the dough cycle in my bread maker instead of doing the work myself. I gotta say, I've tried to make pretzels a number of times and they always came out fairing like a normal bread roll (or worse, a biscotti consistency!), but this time they were perfect.  I didn't experiment with any flavors - I just went with butter and salt and they taste just like the the mall pretzels, only fresher! I can't wait to start experimenting with other toppings and hot dogs!

Very good pretzels.  Just came out of the oven a 1/2 hour ago.  Husband & son had two each, and said they were the best, and better than the mall kind.  I followed the recipe exactly. Don't be afraid or weary (I was) of the brown sugar it works just fine. Using parchment paper is the way to go in my opinion, reduces the chance of burning the bottoms (great for cookies too), and not sticking to the sheet. I plan on doing more with cinnamon & sugar, garlic butter, and whatever my family can come up with.  Thank you

My kids and I had so much fun with this tasty recipe! I made pretzel braids with some of them and they turned out great. I topped a few cooked pretzels with tomato sauce, mozzarella & pepperoni and put them back in the oven for about 5 minutes...quick and tasty meal idea! I'd recommend maxing the oven time at 8 minutes as mine got pretty brown at 9 minutes.

Such a simple but delicious recipe! Easy to make and bake :) I did use all-purpose flour for the whole recipe since I didn't have any bread flour, and they still came out fine. I found they were even better the next day because they softened just a bit... YUMMY!!

I used my bread machine to mix the dough, other than that I followed the recipe and instructions. I only made 6, and froze the rest of the dough for next weekend. There is only 2 of us and we don't need 12 pretzels to eat at once. Very good pretzels!

Yum! We didn't use flour to form the pretzels. We doubled the water and baking soda, brought it to a simmer, and dropped each in for about 10 seconds, until they floated. They started rising right away and were ready to bake in about 10 minutes. We baked them at 415 for about 10 minutes based on some reviews. but I think 450 for 8 would be fine, too. I thought the cinn-sugar tasted a little odd, but the salted ones were great. I think a little more salt in the dough might be good. They were beautiful!

Excellent formula. I use the bread machine to mix the dough. When the dough cycle is complete I divide and roll.  In this way the dough is well developed and stretchy.  Keep the dough covered at all times to prevent it from drying. If it gets dry wet your hands and keep rolling. If it resists let it rest covered for 1 minute then continue rolling. I bake them on non stick foil with no sticking issue. They will not taste like mall pretzels as they do not have all the dough conditioners in them. much better!

Loved these! I did add about 2 more tablespoons of water during mixing because it just seemed a little too crumbly. Other than that they were great, easy to work with the dough and seriously delicious. Did half with coarse salt and half cinnamon sugar...can't even decide which were better.

These were very good.Easy to work with!! My 3 boys loved them!  They were done 32 mins. before the suggested cooking time, so keep an eye on them. & Don't forget the parchment paper! I made these with foil lined pan & sprayed with PAM cooking spray & they still turned out. To make it easier, next time I will be sure to have parchment paper on hand.

Never did I ever think I could make a pretzel at home. In less than 24 hours we have made 2 batches so I think I've eaten at least 8 to 10. Someone stop me! LOL. These are awesome and easy and this is the first time I've made a dough from scratch. Be aware of the proofing times as they are somewhat important. Too long and the dough becomes unworkable. Baste with butter, top with fresh Parmesan and Kosher salt. Thanks for the recipe - perfecto!

Seeing as I have never made pretzels before I wasn't sure if I could modify them to make them lower fat, lower cal and still have them turn out but tried it anyway...and they were wonderful!! Made the recipe as is with the following substitutions... 1 TBSP Splenda brown sugar blend instead of 2 TBSP regular brown sugar, 2 tsp quick rise yeast instead of the active dry yeast and Becel 64% less fat in place of the butter! I made mine into 16 pretzels and ended up with the following nutritional info...114 cals, 23 g carbs, 1 g fat, and 3 g protein...and sooo worth every bite! My family is insisting I make more tomorrow!

My first time trying to make yeasty pretzels and it turned out great! I followed the recipe exactly, and everything went smooth and as planned. The only thing I did extra was set the dipped pretzels on a (clean) kitchen towel to soak up some of the baking soda solution. They came right off the pan! Also, I did roll them pencil thin or smaller in the beginning but they weren't rising the way I wanted them to, so I made them slightly larger than a pencil (think crayon). They ended up much thicker and softer than my original pencil thin pretzels. I may have let it rise a little too much while doubling, so I would just cook your first batch immediately to see how it rises. 

Great recipe!

Just tried it tonight.  My whole family loved them!  A couple of tips to keep in mind - 1 package of yeast equals 2 1/4 teaspoon.  I only had bulk on hand, so I had to look that up.  And, instead of using bread flour, you can use 1 cup all purpose flour with 2 teaspoons of gluten (flour).  Turned out great!  My daughter loves getting mall pretzels and she loved these!  Thanks for sharing!!  A new family favorite!

For the past few weeks I've tried many different pretzel recipes and even an Aunt Aunie's mix. This is by far the best!! I followed the recipe with the exception of using pretzel salt. They are soft and delicious! I have no need to try any more recipes!

Awesome.  Made as directed w/no problem whatsoever.  Dough weighed @ 71g per pretzel and baked in exactly 8".  Update:  Sorry to lower rating.  While these were absolutely fantastic when eaten right from the oven, they shortly thereafter became doughy and rather tasteless.  If you're planning to eat right away, I highly recommend.  If not, well..........

This was a good recipe - but I did add an egg wash before baking. I have been wanting to make pretzels for a while - I have now decided however it is too much work for something that gets gobbled up right away. I guess that isn't a bad thing.

Very good.  I used my bread machine on the dough cycle so that I can throw it in and forget about it.  I used a little bit of flour during the rolling to keep it formed.  Covered with cinnamon and sugar to become candidate for the best dad ever.

I just put the left overs away, by sheer will power there are leftovers at all. So so yummy, even my very picky hubby liked them. I served them with nacho cheese. I had a hard time shaping them, I never got the 3' pencil thin strip to work with, they werent too ugly, but i think ill look up a youtube example next time on  how to actually put it together. I got irritated with it and froze half of the dough for some other time, I hope they turn out just as good. I have not had a mall pretzel in a long time, so i cant really compare taste, but this sucker was soooo good!! Thank you.

The kids and I thought they were great, but I did put 2 pans in at a time in order to make it go faster and by far, the ones cooked on the top rack were better!  The ones on the bottom got too dark.  I think I will try the boiling thing next time too.  Just curious mostly.  I didn't have parchment paper, so just buttered the pans real well, but still had to pry them off with a spatula.  Great taste though, just looking to perfect it next time.

This was the second pretzel recipe I tried and the result was outstanding. Fresh out of the oven these pretzels outshine the best mall pretzels you'll find. Excellent with melted butter brushed and course kosher salt on top, or for a great desert, bake them with cinnamon-sugar and dip in melted butter or icing.

Okay.  Seriously, I normally only like hard pretzels, and usually only eat the soft ones on rare occasions and doused in cheese sauce.  But, the kid loves Auntie Anne's pretzels, and I love the kid, so I begrudgingly made these.  The next thing I knew, I had eaten two, and was working on a third!  Man, are these amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly- not a single change.  The editor's footnote for rolling the dough was incredibly helpful.  This dough is very forgiving and easy to work with.  I made traditional shaped pretzels, with butter and salt, and little pretzel nuggets dipped in butter and cinnamon sugar.  These were a lot of fun to make, and awesomely delicious to eat!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe Jeannie Yee :)

Great except I altered in the following way:
Boiled it in 3 cups water + FIVE TBSP baking soda which was on a gentle simmer - about 45 secs each pretzel;
I basted with an egg wash before I baked;
Buttered and salted each one when it was being eaten

"These are next to heavenly!", exclaimed one of my tasters when they tried these. They were light and delicious. I made some with kosher salt and some with cinnamon sugar; both ways are good. I didn't have any bread flour, so I used regular flour and it worked fine. I also used greased aluminum foil instead of parchment paper. I should have listened to the editor's note about rolling out the dough; mine were a bit thick. I could fit three pretzels on one tray so I only had to use four. Everyone liked these pretzels, they were called "the best pretzels ever!".

I absolutely LOVE this! I have craving some PretzelMaker Pretzel Time pretzels and this is right up the same alley. I just made and all my family and friends love it. The only alteration I made to the recipe was adding 2tbs of butter, which did the trick.

Amazing pretzels! Just what I had in mind.  I reduced the brown sugar by 1 tablespoon and substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour for one cup all-purpose flour.  They were perfect! Crispy on the outside, chewy and tender inside.  I will use this over and over!

Turned out beautifully. It really helped to follow the other comment to dry them quickly on paper towels before putting on the pan.

Very tasty. Mine baked a lot faster though. rolling out the dough did suck, but maybe that gets better with time. Tasty for sure!

Delicious!! These Pretzels were soft and chewy just like the ones you find at the mall. A slightly different taste, but still fabulous. I will definitely be making these again.

Yummy! I have made these twice already and have zero complaints. I am very new to cooking so the fact that I could handle the recipe shows it is easy to make! It does take time to do but it is worth it. They were all gone within 24 hours of making them! They are good re-heated in the microwave the next day too!

I was kind of hoping for a little more authentic mall taste like the pretzle maker, but these were alright... my doe was super wet, so I tried to mix in more flour then it asked for.

Great! Last year, I shaped these pretzels into hearts, sprinkled with pink salt, and gave them to my students an an antidote to all the sugar they get on Valentine's Day. They loooooved them. I'm making them again this year!

This is a great recipe and the pretzels turn out so delicious. The dough was really sticky, so I had a hard time rolling it out, but still turned out great. Used garlic salt on half, and cinnamon on the other half.

It was my first time making pretzels. I used a Kitchen Aid mixer to knead the dough. I did find that a 3-foot rope could later be rolled into a 6-foot rope after you let it rise for a while. 
The texture was delicious with an easy bite, but I think that the pretzels at the mall are usually a bit more chewy. 
Overall, great recipe! I shaped some of my pretzels into hearts!

I had no problems with making the dough; bread makers are my friend for kneading/rising. I found that in order to make them the right size, I had to use more dough. It actually makes about 8 "mall pretzels". I used a spray bottle for the baking soda water, and a marinade brush for the butter.

I worked at Pretzel Time/Pretzel Maker for a little over a year, and have been an avid mall pretzel fan since forever... so I'm  good at rolling and twisting them. Brought back some memories, actually...

I JUST got done making them and they are delicious!!! This recipe is SOOO close to Pretzel Time that it makes me think it must be based off of it. Great recipe, thanks!!!

These were exactly what I expected! I hate paying the price for these pretzels at the theatres, and that's the only place you can get them where I live. Now I can have them whenever I want! I halved the recipe, and made 5 pretzels and a whole sheet of pretzel bites for a party. I topped them all with melted butter and coarse salt, but next time I'm going to try some with cinnamon and sugar. Thanks for sharing!!

These are chewy on the inside and taste good but they don't taste like mall pretzels to me. They taste like warm, chewy, yummy bread but not like mall pretzels. I put Parmesan cheese on them and it kind of masked the fact that I was eating pretzel shaped bread. :) Recipe is easy though for a beginner like myself.

I am not a regular baker, and was a little nervous after reading the previous comments.  However, I found the dough VERY easy to work with. I followed others' advice to flip the dough onto a paper towel and quickly turn in back into my hand after dipping in the baking soda solution.  I also found that a non-stick baking sheet sprayed with Pam worked extremely well.  I coated the pretzels in salted butter!  FANTASTIC!

Followed the recipe exactly.  Granted, since I forgot what a soft pretzel shape looked like, they looked funny but they tasted GREAT! They were so easy to make & I can't wait to experiment with garlic & cheese & cinnamon & sugar!

I'm a almond pretzel fan and thought I would try to make these.  In the same batch I managed to make 8 pretzel dogs and 6 decent sized pretzels, some coated with salt the other in cinnamon sugar.  The only change I made was that I baked them at 425 for about 10 minutes. The pretzel dogs looked wonderful, but taste and looked as if I wrapped them in canned biscuit dough but it didn't matter they still taste good.  The pretzels turned out nicely also.  I still rate it 5 stars because they taste and looked great.
I think I would rather buy one at the mall and leave the mess alone though.

The pretzels came out as salted bread on a plate.  I have been making homemade pretzels for many years now and this is by far the worst recipe I have ever tried. Not only did I waste 4 cups of flour but I ruined a pan with this recipe.

Very good recipe. I had a dozen pretzels in under 3 hours...too bad they were all eaten by my guests in under 30 minutes! ;-)

I've made these twice now. First time they were terrible, second time wonderful only difference I made was the baking temp 350, until a light brown.

Amazing! I think I am in heaven!! Super easy recipe, dough turned out to be much easier to work with than I expected. I did some on parchment paper & some on a sprayed cookie sheet. The ones on parchment paper turned crispier than the others.

These pretzels were delicious.  For a 1st time pretzel baker or baker of any type of "bread", they came out quite good.  Since it was my first time, I should have looked at the Allrecipe how to knead dough recipe and I wouldn't have used so much flour while kneading.  However, despite the fact that I had to pull the pretzels off the aluminum foil (I didn't have parchment paper.) when they were done, they were good and moist.  After brushing the pretzels with butter, I brushed melted butter on them and dipped most of them in a cinnamon/sugar mixture and the rest I sprinkled a little kosher salt on them.  After that, they were ALL gone!  They're not as good as mall pretzels (probably only because I'm a novice and have to improve on my technique) it beats buying them at the mall.  This was very labor intensive and I really should have looked at how much time and how many steps it would take to make the pretzels.  Very good though.

Taste just like Pretzelmaker or Wetzels Pretzels! Very good with cinnimon sugar, salt, frosting, cheese, or just plain with butter!

Oh my goodness! These are AMAZING! The first time I made these, I followed the recipe exactly. The second time I substituted 2 cups of whole wheat flour with 1 TBSP gluten for 2 cups of the all purpose flour to make them a bit healthier. Both times they disappeared very quickly. It's a little labor intensive with rolling them out, but it's worth it!

I made these EXACTLY as directed, and they turned out FANTASTIC!  They do sorta fall apart in what water mixture, but I just re-shaped them on the pan...
My husband said this was the best thing I've ever made...so I will certainly make them again!

I made these tonight with the kids. They were delicious. We just made pretzel sticks instead of messing with the shape. I'll definitely use this recipe again.

These pretzels are a real crowd pleaser.  They are best when fresh, but reheat fairly well.  I like to serve them with a mustard/raspberry dip.  Delish!

These were ok, but kind of disappointing after seeing the high rating and the rave reviews. As far as the recipe goes I followed it exact and it was easy and I had no problem with dough or getting it thin or shaping it into pretzel shape, It was the baking part that frustrated me...wouldn't brown at all and then I ended up leaving them in too long and they turned into hard pretzels. THe second batch I reduced the heat and baked them for 12 minutes and they were better, brushed them with butter and sprinkled with cinnamon & sugar....and while they tasted pretty good the biggest disappointment for me was that they did not taste like the mall pretzels.

Tasted great!  Only problem was they stuck to the wax paper like glue.  If this problem could be solved then these would be the perfect pretzel.

Excellent flavor!  My kids and I had fun making these.  I might work on the presentation a little, but they tasted really great.  My neighbor came over right after we made them, and they couldn't believe they weren't store-bought.  They didn't last long in our house!

Fabulous! Mine didn't look nearly as nice as the ones in the photo but they tasted great :) I used rapid rise yeast so that might be why they weren't as smooth....they just wouldn't roll for me. But this was awesome and I will make this again! :) Thanks!

These pretzels were great! Easy to make(I'm new to baking-so "easy" is saying alot for me).  I didn't get the "soft pretzel skin" on mine but they were good...the family had them gone within an hour of them coming out of the oven.  I served them with some cheese sauces (the men wanted jalapeno sauce of course) and they went over wonderfully, Thanks for a great recipe!

These pretzels were very easy to make. The dough was easy to work with and it wasn't too sticky. They baked up to a light golden brown and then when the butter was added at the end they gained some more color. I ate one fresh out of the oven and it was so light and fluffy! I would definitely make these again.

This was great fun, though it seemed like placement inside the oven made a huge difference between the different racks of pretzels I made.  I tried this recipe twice, and though it isn't the same without lye, I'd definitely do it again even if I don't get my hands on any.

Awesome pretzels!  I love to make pretzel bites  instead with honey mustard.  I always get requests for these when there is a party. They are so easy to make, which makes them a definite keeper in my house.  Thanks for the 5 star plus recipe.

Made these pretzels with my 15 year old daughter. She raved about how fun it was! As for taste - they were terrific. We both agreed we don't need the mall any longer!!

These were really good and easy to make.  Nice and soft and a little chewy.  Other than waiting for the them to rise it isn't even a very time consuming recipe.  The whole family liked them... I did half with salt and half with cinnamon and sugar.  I'd definitely make them again.

These pretzels are amazing but need LESS time in the oven! I found cooking them in the oven for 6 minutes was enough before the bottoms started to burn.

I was so surprised at how much these tasted like the ones at the mall! I was skeptical but they turned out great.  I used 4 cups of all-purpose flour and no bread flour because that's what I had. Other than that I followed directions exactly as written.

I love this recipe, it makes a great dough.  One thing I did was brush an egg wash on the surface of the pretzels after removing them from the baking soda bath.  I learned this from Alton Brown and it really helps to bring that shiny dark brown color and crispiness on the outside of the pretzels.  I use the egg wash to help make the salt, or any other topping I'm using to stick.  I've used this recipe many times and it's always been a hit!

Holy Cow! These are awesome! I did this in my bread machine which made it so easy. We topped ours with garlic pdr, parmesan and italian seasoning. I first brushed with garlic butter from this site. Will be making this recipe for a long time to come.

These are yummy, my 19 month old had a blast rolling the dough!  I experimented with shapes, I think for the superbowl I'll do all "nuggets" where I rolled the dough and cut them into 1.5" pieces. Big plastic bag full of italian seasoning, garlic powder and parmesan for some; cinnamon, brown sugar and sugar for the rest!

I'm giving them 5 because I can't give them 6!  :)  My daughter and her friend (6yo) helped shape them and had a blast!  They didn't know they could MAKE pretzels.  I've never had success with pretzels but this recipe will be a staple from now on!  I'll experiment with different toppings!  THANK YOU!

My kids loved them, but my husband and I weren't as impressed.  They were certainly good, but didn't have quite the "mall pretzel" flavor we were looking for.

Rolling out the dough was tough because it's hard to 3' of surface area to work in most kitchens.  I think rolling the dough out to pencil thin is WAY to thin.  I would say about the thickness of my thumb.    The pretzels did not taste like the authentic "mall" pretzels, but they did taste really good.  I had a hard time getting the salt to stick.  I would also like to make the outer crust a little darker and more chewey but keep it soft inside the pretzel.  Maybe I need to modify my egg wash?

I have made these quite a few times and follow the recipe exactly (except when I don't have bread flour and use all-purpose entirely).   They are always a hit with my family and friends.

Just as good as Mall Pretzels. Followed ingredients exactly but I followed other reviewers suggestions and boiled them in the water w/Baking soda until they floated and then baked for 8 minutes @ 450 Degrees.

These are great!  I will admit though that these don't taste quite like mall pretzels, but they are still pretty darn good!  I buttered and salted my pretzels before I baked them so the salt stays put.  A heads up, make sure you parchment paper your sheet or at least use baking spray, they WILL stick!

These are absolutely fantastic! I love them and so does my family. Easy to make. I did have a problem with them sticking to my baking parchment at first, but now I just spray it with a little oil (the low fat kind) and it works magic! I do think sticking was due to quality of paper rather than recipe though :)

Well I'm not an professional baker, so I was'nt too sure what bread flour was. I used a generic baking mix. I also seen that another user suggested resting the pretzels on paper towels for the second rising time. (Don't use generic paper towels, they tear when you pick-up the pretzels) I also has problems with twisting the pretzels - The kept loosing the shape (This was my first time to twist pretzels) The finished pretzels were great. I give the this recipe 2 thumbs up :)

The kids and I really liked these. We made half with cinnamon sugar and the other half with coarse salt. The only change I made was that I made them into long sticks which I thought would be less messy. Super easy to make in my Kitchenaid mixer.

These turned out really well! Especially after dunking them in melted butter and tossed in cinnamon sugar. Letting the dough rest before rolling them out into ropes is key as well to getting the perfectly sized pretzels.

We were very disappointed in the taste;  we didn't think these had any flavor to them.  The only change I made was using all purpose flour for all of it because I didn't have any bread flour, but I don't think that would have changed the blandness.  There is another recipe on this site called "Buttery Soft Pretzels" that are a lot more flavorful and easy to make.

This recipe is great! I just made it with my boyfriend and didn't change any of the ingredients. The only thing I did differently was letting the dough rise in a slightly preheated oven (let preheat at 350F for two minutes then turn off, when it is in its greased bowl) for maybe an hour + 10 minutes. Other than that followed the recipe exactly. Perfect! The dough tastes just like Auntie Anne's! My boyfriend loves them!

These tasted as good as the ones you buy in the mall. I made the dough in my bread machine and wet my hands in the baking soda and water mixture to shape them and had no trouble with the dough sticking. Thanks for the recipe!

In flavor, they are good, but I did not like the fact that they were so thin (I rolled them pencil thin) and maybe it was my oven, but they were hard to bake because they either came out looking uncooked and on the soft side or crunchy and a bit too browned. They did not taste bad, but I would not make these again.

Delicious! Some important amendments: do not add the salt to the yeast/sugar because it won't let the yeast bloom.  Add the salt to the flour. After dipping in the water, sprinkle on the kosher salt at this stage so it sticks.  If you sprinkle it after baking it won't stay on the pretzel.  FYI the dough freezes pretty well - just roll out your shapes and freeze on a baking sheet (later transfer to bags if you want).  You can resume the process after thawing at room temp with the water dip and baking.

Holy Cow these were great!  My husband made these for us (he made our names in pretzel)while we were away for spring break and he eat a few to make sure they were good enough for us.  I think he followed the recipe exactly.  He's going to be in charge of making pretzels for the family.  :)

oh my goodness, these are delicious. I'm actually eating one right now... I do admit that I made some changes to the baking part based on what my mother always did with me when I was younger. Just before I put the pan in the oven I brushed them with egg and sprinkled them with salt. My room mates requested some cinnamon sugar and italian pretzels (italian seasoning and parmesan cheese). They are delicious just the way the recipe instructs though :)

Unbelievable!  The dough is so easy to work with and they cook up beautifully.  We tossed ours in cinnamon sugar and they tasted just like the pretzel sticks we get at the mall!  The dough keeps in the fridge for a few hours after the first rising too!  Beautiful.

Fantastic!  I have tried another recipe from this site twice (Buttery Soft Pretzels I think it is called) and was not particularly thrilled with the results.  This one turned out perfectly.  The dough had a great light texture and with the butter brushed over it, was just delicious.  We dipped in cinnamon sugar, we did the coarse salt, and we slice garlic thinly and put it in the dough of some while baking.  That is something I'd recommend as they had great flavor.

The taste and texture were great, but the bottoms of the pretzels were really dark, I'm not sure how to change that but overall a good recipe.

first time making pretzel's since the 6th grade and it went well.  I had 7 kids under age 10 "helping" me and it was tons of fun.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect and were a hit with everyone.  Will do again- just by myself next time.

Very bland to me.  I think they need sugar or something.  Also, perhaps its my oven but my pretzels didn't brown on the top, only the bottom.  

Do not use wax paper instead of parchment!  Putting the pretzels down on a greased pan probably would have been better in the absence of parchment.  Also, I tried to make pretzels that were half the size of what's recommended so I could make more.  The dough puffs too much though and they didn't look very appetizing in the end.

These are GREAT!!! I used some of the suggestions...after dipping them in the baking soda and water, I dropped them onto a paper towel to absorb the excess. I baked them on an insulated cookie sheet that I sprayed with PAM. They browned nicely and didn't stick. I cut them into 6 smaller pretzel stix (like the Mall offers now)/ 3' length. Most of them I rolled in cinnamon sugar but a few I saved and sprinkled them with kosher salt and dipped those in mustard. These are really good. Will be making them again soon!

These pretzels were very good.  As others suggested, I boiled them in the baking soda solution instead of just dipping them.  I also brushed them with egg and put salt on before baking, It helped keep the salt on the pretzel.  I had to keep a close eye on these while they were baking, the bottoms came very close to burning.  Overall, they are pretty good, not mall pretzels exactly, but I would definitely make them again!

easy, tasty, and fun.  I make a batch when my almost-7YO twin daughters have friends over for playdates and give each girl a ball of dough and a small pan with flour and they love to roll and shape their own pretzels while I shape the rest of the dough.  I find it easier to work with smaller pieces of dough so I actually divide the dough into about 18-20 pieces instead of 12.  like some of the other reviewers suggest, I blot the pretzels quickly with a paper towel after dipping them in the baking soda solution and then put them on baking sheets with a light spraying of nonstick cooking spray

We used this recipe for a playgroup of 2 and 3 year olds. It turned out great! A few things I noticed when making them that might help others:

It says to dissolve the sugar and the yeast with water. The yeast didn't fully "dissolve"- it continued to move around. I went ahead and considered it done and they turned out fine. 

I didn't have bread flour, instead I used 3 cups all purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour. 

I boiled the water/baking soda mixture and dipped each pretzel into this for about 20-30 seconds before putting it on the parchment. I did NOT wipe off the water before placing them on the parchment and I had no problem at all with them sticking. Perhaps the water is meant to help them not stick? At any rate, the parchment paper worked great for us. 

Because it was a play group, kids rolling and making shapes, etc. we didn't necissarily wait the 20 minutes for the second rise. They still turned out great, but I did feel like the pencil thin ropes were too thin. I made some later ones a bit thicker and preferred them. 

Everyone had a blast making these, and they were deemed "better than the mall pretzels!" I was asked for the recipe by 2 of the 3 moms that were here.

Really good.  Lost one star for not living up to its billing.  Didn't taste like mall pretzels to me, just really good yeast dough bread.  I dipped it in melted butter and tried kosher salt and cinnamon sugar.  I liked the sugared ones better which is not like me.  Once again, because the dough didn't really taste like the mall pretzels.  
I prefer the Buttery Soft Pretzels recipe to this one for tasting like mall pretzels.

This recipe was very good.  I ate 4 and my boyfriend ate 6!  Very dangerous ;)  Two fell on the floor... if those had been there he probably would have eaten those.

I first made my pretzels very long and they were too big and thin, I think.  I think 3 foot of dough is just about perfect.  Otherwise they are too thick or thin.  

I tried it with salt, cinnamon and sugar, and garlic and parm cheese.  All three ways were great.  My boyfriend was so impressed that I made his favorite food from scratch!

This recipe was sooooo good! I wanted some sort of baked good that I didn't have to feel too guilty about but would still satisfy my sweet tooth. To make myself not feel too guilty I used whole wheat flour for about a third of the flour, and I also wanted them to be a little sweeter so I added some Splenda into mix and poured the water right on top to make it dissolve. I also sprinkled some cinnamon in. I kneaded for forever until I felt the dough get really elastic and smooth. After rising I had no problem   shaping the dough, I just rolled them in my hands before dipping them. I did place them on a paper towel just to get the puddling water off the bottom and put them straight on a PAM sprayed nonstick pan. They came out after 8 minutes and I sprayed them with butter flavored PAM and  then sprinkled with Splenda mixed with cinnamon or with dark chocolate cocoa powder. They were both really good and tasted like the mall ones but not nearly as greasy(which I hate).

I've been trying for the last several hours to make these and I'm now tired and frustrated.  I have made bread before and I followed the recipe exactly and read the other reviews. 

The dough is not easy to work with at all.  It is soft and 'elasticy' but it wants to break up (lines run through it) and I cannot roll it to the thickness of a pencil - maybe 2 or 3 pencils thick. lol  I ended up having to squeeze the dough into a long enough line and then roll it into smoother shape.

I had no problem dipping the dough into the baking soda/water mixture, probably because the dough is so darn tough.  I am just hoping that these come out as something that are edible and can be served with dinner, otherwise I will be sorely disappointed.  

I would not recommend this recipe to novice bakers.  I would recommend that if you have a Kitchen Aid mixer that you use that to knead the dough.  I really should have.

---

Okay, they came out of the oven nice and brown and didn't stick to the sheet.  I gave them a good dunk in the mixture and dabbed them ever so lightly on paper towel.  Maybe that is the trick.  Once you dunk them in melted butter and salt them, they're tasty and definitely chewy, although still soft.  I have to say though that there is something missing from the receipe that I can't quite put my finger on. These are very much like bread - they are missing that bit of sourness.

I made this recipe even easier by making the dough in the bread maker. Rolling the dough into pretzel shapes was very time consuming, so I rolled the dough out like a pizza and cut it into strips. So easy & delicious! I've tried making pretzels using the bake-boil-bake method; this is way easier and has more accurate "mall" results! Best if eaten as soon as they're removed from the oven.

Good recipe - loved the dough, very easy to work with and rose beautifully.  Next time I will boil them in baking soda water then bake and then I think they will be 5 stars.

I read all of the reviews and decided to make them just the way it was written. I had great luck! My suggestion is to remove them from the parchment paper as soon as they come out of the oven.

These pretzels come very close to 5 stars. They are about 90-95% as good as mall pretzels.  I'm guessing mall pretzel dough contains some fat which gives it that really good but oh-so-bad-for-you taste.  Next time I might try adding a few tablespoons of butter to the dough.  I prepared the dough in my bread machine.  When I took it out it was VERY sticky and I had to add a good bit of flour to make it workable. Shaping the pretzels was a pain. I think next time I'll just make sticks. My kids loved these!  I made 8 topped with butter and kosher salt and 4 topped with butter and cinnamon/sugar. Both are delicious!

1. First time I made these (1 month ago) I seriously messed up.  I had never worked with yeast before and for some reason I covered and put in the fridge to rise!  Ha Ha.  
2.  Upon finding out about my mistake with the fridge, I had to start over because my kids were counting on it.  I made again from scratch - and was impressed at the taste, but hated the mess it made of my kitchen. (I had made two batches afterall!)  I swore I would NEVER make them again since we had a perfectly good pretzel place around the corner. 
3. Today I said - why not?  I tried again and even put the covered dough in the warmest place in the house to rise.  The bathroom floor by the vent.  It really doubled - maybe even tripled in size.  This time it was soooo easy to cut into 12 pieces.  I obviously did so much wrong the last time - because last time I couldn't separate the dough at all.  I also rolled and that was easy.  Here are my important notes-
First - parchment paper worked better.  We did two batches on cookie sheets sprayed with cooking spray to avoid sticking.  The pretzels burned on the bottom.  The last batch we used parchment and they were perfect.  So parchment changed the way they cooked and at least one pan will be easy to clean up.  Also - I didn't have bread flour so I used regular flour and that worked just fine.  I still don't know if it is worth it because we do have a place around the corner that sells good pretzels - but honestly - the kids had fun.  Now - I need to go spend

These were a hit at our party.  I read reviews and tried to ensure that I kneeded long enough. We turned them into nuggets but I forgot about the butter.  They were still very popular.  No leftovers.

This is the first time I've tried to make pretzels and they turned out great! I followed the recipe exactly, except I did use my kitchen aid. Now that I know how easy it is I'm sure I'll be making these a lot because my kids loved them. I made mine a little thicker so they weren't exactly like the mall's. If I did them a little thinner they definitely would be more mall like. A great recipe!

Yummy!  I greased my parchment paper and had no trouble with the pretzels sticking.  I also dabbed the excess soda water off before letting them rise.  I made a half batch and they were gone in less than 10 minutes...  5 kids and 2 adults all gave 2 thumbs up!

Followed the notes of others about drying off the pretzels - they were great.  Everyone loved them.  They were gone right away, so I don't know how they last.

These pretzels were delicious!  They are somewhat time consuming to make, because of the multiple steps.  I recently tried to double the recipe for a party, but found that the dough was much stickier and ended up having to add a full cup of extra flour.  They still tasted great but if I double it again I will just mix each batch separately.  We sprinkled some of them with cinnamon sugar instead of salt, and they came out delicious!  Also made some into various sizes of sticks, rather than big pretzels.  Will definitely be making this many more times!

I had a lot of trouble rolling these out into 3 foot ropes, but I think it's pretty important if you want them to look like mall pretzels.  Other than that they looked and tasted great.  Next time I might try boiling them or at least using boiling water in the baking soda bath because the soda didn't seem to dissolve properly in mine.

Stuck to the parchment paper a lot, adn did not have a stand-out flavor within the dough itself.  Would have been better if boiled first, I think, and if the pretzels had been bigger (double in size and thickness).

Excellent! I took another bakers advice and kneaded the dough for at least ten minutes. This made it very elastic and even my six year old could make a 3 foot snake (what fun!!) I also salted before cooking which worked perfectly. It was fun making braids and circles and swirls as well as knots. A great project with kids with a tasty finish!

Delicious pretzels.  I changed two things:  I proofed the yeast first for 10 minutes, and then added the other ingredients.  I also used whole wheat flour instead of white.  Came out great!

This was a fun recipe to make as a family.  I was able to mix in 1 cup of bread flour and 2 cups of all purpose flour with the mixer and then proceeded to kneading.  Probably worked in 3/4 cup more the kneading.  We had no problem rolling the pretzels, just let the dough rest for 3 or 4 minutes prior to beginnning to roll.  I brought 6 cups of water and 6 T of baking soda to a boil and dipped the pretzels in for 15 seconds each.  We did the butter and salt prior to baking for about 10 mintues. The pretzels were really light and yummy.  I think I'd use even more butter next time.  They were yummy!

i'm not even exaggerating when i say that i've made this recipe about 50 times!  i've been using this recipe for years, and friends even ask me to make pretzles when i visit them at their houses! i twist mine like a skein of yarn, and they're amazing fresh; but also great on day 2 as a tuna sandwich.  (just google how to twist skeins of yarn!).

Excellent! I used this recipe to make pretzel dogs, and they were awesome! My husband and kids loved them! I couldn't believe even my picky eater ate 2! Better than the pretzel dogs we got at the pretzel place. And using the kitchen aid to knead the dough made this recipe a breeze! Thanks!!!

Wow! These were fantastic! I made these with my daycare kids for their afternoon snack. They were very easy and fun to make and the kids (and I) LOVED them!!! I had to send some home with them because they just wanted more and more and I didn't want to spoil their dinner. There is nothing I would change. They were just the right softness and texture and such a perfect snack. This is a keeper for sure.

These were quite the hit at my Oktoberfest party. I found the dough very easy to work with (got a good arm workout with the 8 min. kneeding!). Three important things to make these really spectacular: serve them hot, add lots of coarse salt, and always serve with a good mustard or two. Prost!

I've been making these pretzels for about 3 years now and constantly get asked to make them for different activities.  A few things I've done differently, They turn out fine with only all-purpose flour; I've had to do this many times due to not having bread flour.  I also don't make them so thin when I roll them out.  I also don't dunk them in the baking soda water.  I'm not sure of the purpose of this but mine have always turned out fine.  I also don't use the parchment paper, I spray with Pam.  If you want salty pretzels I recommend brushing them with butter and sprinkling on the salt BEFORE they rise after you've formed them otherwise the salt doesn't really stick.  Awesome recipe!!

These tasted awesome.  I used the dough cycle on my bread machine and for some reason the dough came out a bit too sticky, sort of the opposite problem that quite a few reviewers have had...I'll knead it by hand next time and see if that changes anything.  I ate them with butter and salt, and with butter and cinnamon sugar.  So delicious!

These are GREAT!  I only had all purpose flour and they were fine.  Definitely use parchment paper though, or they will stick!  Very tasy with salt or cinnamon and sugar too.  My kids gobbled these up!

These were delicious! Like others, I had to add a bit more water, but that was it. My boyfriend said they were the best he's ever had. Other than adding a bit more water to the dough, I followed the recipe exactly. I will be making these again. Thank you!!

This is a very delicious, adaptable recipe. I used 2 cups whole wheat pastry flour and less than 2 cups AP flour.  I use 4 cups of flour overall, including that sprikled on the counter.  The longer you let the dough rise without getting that skin on top, the better the pretzels, in my opinion.  Be sure not to roll them out too thin if you like soft pretzels.  It only took 4 minutes to brown the pretzels (This could be because I live at 7200 feet above sea level), any longer than that, and they get more chewy than soft.  I used canola oil and sea salt, which was good, after I realized that sea salt is much more salty than kosher salt, and adjusted accordingly. I also made cinnamon sugar with cinnamon, sugar, and a dash each of nutmeg and ginger.  Definitely a keeper.

Either I was impatient, or these just didn't raise like I was expecting. They were really thin. They still tasted good, though, so I gave them 4 stars.

these pretzels are awesome!!! I, like a 
couple other people, used regular flour instead of the bread flour, and they still came out great!!!

now the con:
dough was hard to roll (i guess it always is, though),

now suggestions:
if you are using margarita salt like i did, ONLY PUT A LITTLE!!! or else it will taste like a gulp of ocean water...  do not put them on wax paper in the oven (now you probably think im stupid...) because the pretzels stick to it...

thanks, allrecipies and mrs. yee for this great recipie!!

Holy cow! These things are good! I  popped all of the dough ingredients in the breadmaker and set it on the "dough" cycle. Worked like a charm.

Wow these pretzles are great. Make sure you have a lot of time though before you make them and when rolling the dough pieces out to about 3 ft long be careful not to rip the dough since i found out it's really hard to stick back togther without ripping again. I tried another pretzel recipe that turned out horrible before and while ,making them the dough was sticking to everything ended up tring one then throwing the rest away and thought i'd never try to make pretzels again but when i saw all the good reviews for this recipe i decided to try it. And I am glad i did! Also the next day they taste better as long as you microwave them for about 30 seconds on high. Try this recipe, if you don't your missing out on great, soft, and delicious pretzels! 0:)they are the  bomb

Don't get me wrong. These tasted good. But if you're looking for a good "mall" pretzel, you should be looking for another recipe. This one is more breadstick than pretzel.

This preztels taste good, not delicious but only good. 
For my opinion, this pretzels contain too much salt, so i had to put extra sugar over them so that they tasted sweet enough. So next time i'll put less salt. I HIGH RECOMEND YOU TO PUT LESS SALT, because otherwise these pretzels will taste awful.
If you want to put them a delicious icing dip (like the one selled in Aunt Annies) only mix powdered sugar and milk.
I hope this review can be useful to you.

This recipe was a hit! I'm an Activity Coordinator at a retirement home and made these with my residents and they LOVED them. They enjoyed playing with the dough and making their initials from it. These pretzels were fast to make and tasted perfect! Thanks

Pretzels are traditional for Lent, and I went looking for a good recipe so as to start a Lenten tradition with friends.  Well, I have found the recipe and will be using it weekly through Lent.  These were delicious; the texture is just right, and the flavor from the butter and salt conplements the pretzel itself perfectly.  I cooked mine four at a time on parchment paper for 10 minutes at 450 degrees (as recommended).  They browned very evenly, and they were the perfect size, too.  The best way to divide them is to keep dividing the dough in half until you have 12 pieces of dough; this keeps them all pretty even.  For all the first-time bread bakers out there, note that you may need a little extra flour as you knead the dough (but use as little as you can get away with; the dough should be smooth and only barely not sticky).  The only thing I changed was that I used fast-acting yeast instead of the regular, and shortened the first rising time to 40 minutes.  The second rising time was only about 7-8 minutes.  The sooner THESE pretzels are ready, the better.  Enjoy!

I think these are better than the mall prezels. The only change I made was substituting 1 cup of wheat flour for 1 of the all purpose flour cups. To add a little fiber... SOOOOOO good. Thank you for a great recipe.

Not great.  They were easy enough and fun for the kids.  However, I have to agree with the reviewer who said they pretty much taste like white bread.  If it weren't for the salt or cinnamon/sugar on top, they wouldn't even be all that appealing (though with the toppings, they are somewhat addictive right out of the oven).  I've eaten a MUCH BETTER homemade pretzel before, but I lost the 2nd half of the recipe.  I have the ingredients but the process.  It is the recipe for pretzels from the Buckhead Bread Company and was published in the Atlanta Journal Constitution back in 2000.  You can still get it by searching their archives for it if you're willing to pay $5.95, but I can't bring myself to do so.  I may experiment with the ingredients and see if I can figure out the process.  It's a delicious one!

me and hubby both thought these were awesome.  definitely a workout for the hands in making the ropes, none of mine were 6feet but they turned out perfect all the same.  also NO NEED FOR PARCHMENT...i didnt have so i just sprayed my baking sheets with baking spray and i can't imagine paper making any difference.  these were delightful.  i will make again and hopefully not eat what remains of the dozen.  thanks.

absolutely fantastic!  Definitely roll them out 'pencil thin'.  They taste great with salt or cinnamon and sugar.  The dough freezes and refrigerates well.  Great for company.  You can let them rise while you are eating, put them in the oven when you are done, and have just enough time to clear the dinner plates and put on dessert plates!  I have already made this recipe 3 times!

This was the most tasty pretzel recipe.  We have to agree, they are best hot out of the oven and do not reheat very well.  Just like a Lay's potato chip, you can't eat just one.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

I made no changes to the recipe & I had no issues w/ it either. Ooops, I did make one addition...I added two tbp of gluten to the flour to get a better rise. I let my kitchenaid do most of the kneading & then I quickly finished it off by hand. I got a little greedy w/ the butter...they were a little greasier than I would have liked. We loved these but everyone is right, they don't reheat well. I cut the recipe in half ...I wish that I had frozen the shaped pretzels before their second rising to see how they are that way. I will next time. Thansk for a wonderful weekend treat, Jeannie Yee!

These were excellent, but the recipe insturctions could have been just SLIGHTLY more detailed (which is really funny because I rarely follow a recipe!). I just wasn't sure how thin and long to roll out each piece of dough. I rolled mine out to about 16 inches long and 3/4 inch in diameter but I think they were probably supposed to be longer because during the second rise, right before you bake them, the spaces in the "knot" of the pretzels closed. But the flavor was still WONDERFUL!!! I think next time I'll try dicing up some jalapeno peppers and a little garlic and add that to the dough batter and serve with cheese for dipping. Can't wait to try it again!

Awesome pretzels!  I made the dough in my bread machine and then rolled them out.  They are best if you can get them pencil thin.  I tried them two different ways, the first batch I brushed with the butter when I took them out of the oven and sprinkled with salt and the other batch I sprinkled with the salt before baking.  They are absolutely best all around if you brush them with the butter.  I wasn't sure if they would be too greasy because I am giving them as a Christmas gift but the butter soaks right in.  I dipped them in "Creamy Mustard Sauce".  Delicious.

These pretzels were very good!  I used a bread machine to make up the dough so it was super simple also.  The outside was crispy and the inside crunchy.  After taking them out of the oven I rebuttered them to give them more flavor.  I also didn't have all purpose flour on hand so I used all bread flour.  Very good!  Well worth the pain of rolling them out (just laziness on my part not difficulty!)  Awesoem!

These pretzels were really good and easy to make. They are very versatile. I usually make half pretzels and the other half of the dough I wrap around hotdogs and bake at the same temp. I put on seaseme seeds, onions, and cinnamon and sugar. Really great and the best thing to mall pretzels.

These are great. The only thing that I would say is to make sure that you have parchment paper! I didn't have any, so I just baked them directly onto the baking sheet, and just put flour on the pan. Not a good idea, the pretzels had to be taken out of the oven real fast, because they would burn so quickly on the bottom. I would make these again, but next time I'll for sure bake them with parchment paper!

Delicious!  I use the recipe to make pretzel dogs.  Instead of shaping them into pretzels I wrap the rope around a hotdog.  The kids love them and also love making their own funky shaped pretzels.

I didn't make these into twists.  I just layed the batter into a pan and baked it like a loaf of flat bread.  It made a very tasty and light bread for our dinner.  Everyone loved it.

super!!  now, who has a recipe for the cheese sauce to dip them in?  I fell asleep while they were rising, so they rose for an hour longer than they should which might have been a good thing.  when rolling, I did them all in both hands and not on the corner.  I took the advice of the editor's note and I didn't even have to roll them the 2nd time.  I would grab a rope and dangle it and it practically lengthened itself the rest of the way.  Mine turned out perfectly!  Quick and tasty!  TIP:  If you aren't used to making anything with yeast, it may seem these are timely but after a while you learn that you really don't count the rising time

I've made these pretzels a number of times.  They are actually BETTER than the pretzels purchased at the malls!  I served them for all of the Steeler playoff games and the Super Bowl.  I guess I will have to make them every Sunday next year!

These tasted great! The only trouble I had was getting them to look like pretzels. Apparently I didn't roll the dough long enough. But it didn't matter what they looked like, they were fantastic!

I wish I had read all the bad reviews before my son and I took almost 3 hours to make these. (You can sort reviews by rating, you know.) Anyway, we ate one out of the oven and it was okay, but they were for a school project and by the time my son took them to school the next day they were soggy. I think it was the brushed on butter that was the problem. And the salt did not stick. Also, why are they to be rolled out so long and thin? They didn't rise much after rolling out, so we had these huge, skinny pretzels. The ones that we rolled out thicker were better. I felt so bad for him having to present these to his class.... :-(

Delicious!  Mine were more like pretzel-shaped breadsticks.  I sprinkled some parmesean cheese over some of them halfway through baking and they were great!  I haven't had a mall pretzel for years - I guess I'll have to try one to get pointers for the next time I make these!!

I was very disappointed in these. EVERYONE around me agrees they taste absolutely nothing like pretzels (i think maybe they are not yeasty enough). I will make these into breadsticks, though (delicious w/ parmesan or cinnamon sugar). They were simple to make, and rolling them out was extremely easy. However, no pretzel taste at all, and not a particularly great bread taste anyway to compensate, so, 3 stars (maybe 2, actually...) Cinnamon sugar ones taste good if you stick them in the microwave for 20 seconds.

These are SOOOOOO good! My 6 year old, 21 month old and I made these today and they turned out great! (We ended up with a lot of flour on the floor and we didn't actually bake 2 of them) We only had unbleached all-purpose flour and white sugar, not brown, but they still turned out soft and delicious! Wonderful!!

Yum!!! Don't let them sit around too long though - the dry out.  I found that for "next day" eating they were best popped in the microwave for 30 secs.

Normally, I really don't enjoy making breads because they can be nit-picky and time consuming to make, and usually don't yeild great results. This recipe changes that. Although they did take time by having to rise(I'm an impatient person)they yeild delicious pretzels. I made these with my 3 younger siblings(7,5,3)and they enjoyed rolling them out and shaping the rods into the first letters of thier names.
I took others' advice and greased a baking sheet and brushed on the soda mixture. I hade a few sticking problems, but nothing to call home about.
Overall, a good recipe.

I made these for New Year's instead of a big pretzel and they went over huge.  I substituted whole wheat flour for the bread flour since that's what I had on hand.  Really tasty - chewy and delicious!  I topped half with kosher salt and half with cinnamon and sugar.  If little kids are going to be the ones eating these, I'd make each one smaller next time.  Several people asked for the recipe.

Don't waste your time! Go to the Mall! I know know why mall pretzels are so expensive! These tasted pretty good, but, my arms and hands ached for 2 days! They took forever to make, and they don't store well at all. So, only make these if you live in a remote location and there is no mall. They taste good, but, I don't think it's worth the effort.

This was great.  I used whole wheat flour and unbleached bread flour and it still came out great. I scaled down the recipe to 4 pretzels and only made 3 to have them extra big.  i also used 3/4 the amount of brown sugar and just brushed the baking soda mix on the pretzel. I'm thinking about eating the other two tonight also!!

I hate to give this a bad review, esp. after all the good ones. My family and I thought that it was just ok. They didn't taste very much like the mall! The dough was a little hard to handle for my brothers and sister and me too. We used our bread machine to make it. We put all sorts of toping on, but it just didn't taste all that good. You don't need to use the wax paper they work just fine if you put them on a greased baking sheet. They were good as bagels, but as far as pretzels go, I'll keep looking for a good recipe. Thanks anyway!

These came out kind of hard, but still tasty. More like breadsticks than pretzels. I don't think I'll be making them again though.

My 4 yr. old daughter and I just finished making these.  Although we were not so good at making the pretzel shape,(ours look more like bagels without the holes) they turned out great!  I also used all purpose flour(no cake flour) and we sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on them, what a yummy treat!

These are GREAT! I didn't have bread flour so I used 4 cups all purpose flour and the turned out fine. I got lots of compliments from my husband's co-workers and my kids just inhale them. There were none left within 30 minutes of bringing them out of the oven. Super. Thanks!

My hubby made these tonight and we ended up just having these for dinner! LOL! They were awesome! We put all sorts of different seasonings on the pretzels and even dipped them in black bean and cheese dip! I am no good at working with dough but thankfully my hubby is. He said they were easy to make and they tasted great!

When I think of pretzels, I think of those smooth brown pretzels that you can get at the Hofbrauhaus in Munich or at the baseball stadium.  The pretzels from this recipe don't fit the bill because this recipe uses baking soda as a coating, which doesn't make the nice smooth shell. Be sure to remove the pretzels from the baking paper right away, otherwise it'll be hard to get them off. Happy baking!

I've been using the Betty Crocker pretzel recipe
and find this recipe much easier. The pretzels came out delicious and my daughters had fun rolling and stretching them out. We made smaller pretzels as 3 foot was a bit too long and tended to break easily. We used a spatula to scoop the pretzel into the baking soda and water. We will definitely try this recipe again.

Excellent recipe! Fun to make (especially w/ kids) and taste great! These didn't last long when I made them. Also excellent with cinnamon sugar on top!

These were very, very good! My little boys were able to help which was fun. I buttered the bottom of the pans and had no problem with sticking. I srinkled some with garlic powder and some with seasoned salt. Great recipe to make with kids!

I just knew I'd mess these up,and I didn't!  These came out wonderfully.  My 5 year old helped roll out the snakes and told me it was so much fun. I used the garlic salt on mine.  Also, didn't have parchment paper, so I baked mine on tin foil, which was fine, except the pretzels did stick a little bit.  These did not remind me of breadsticks at all.  They were chewy like soft pretzels and tasted like soft pretzels to me!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  I will be making these again and again and again.

My family thought these were wonderful.  Our 5-year old daughter helped shape them into pretzels (a bit difficult with the dough being so elastic... but she had a ball!).  The only place the parchment paper almost "burned" was where I had it hanging over the cookie sheet - lesson learned.  They were wonderful and a HUGE savings over the incredible prices they charge at the mall.  *Very* yummy with the melted butter and cinnamon/sugar mix sprinkled on them.

This recipe is great! The whole family loved them. We didn't use parchment, just oiled cookie sheets. We salted them right after putting them in the baking soda/water solution, and left off the butter. The rolling wasn't as tough for us as other people noted. The kids had fun making "worms" rolling them between the palms of their hands. The kids worked them a lot and they stilled turned out great.

These were to die for.  Very good.  A hint for those who aren't bread makers and who are having a hard time rolling them out.  Make sure that the bowl that the dough rises in has plenty of oil.  Don't roll in flour, if you need to roll in something try a tiny bit of oil (the amount on the dough from rising in the bowl should be plenty).  I put the salt on before I baked, then brushed with butter.  Turned out superb!!

I loved this recipe - so did al of my housemates.  Some people complained about it being time consuming but it really doesn't take that much effort.  Only a few minutes here and there and then of waiting.  The pretzals werre super yummy.  I started out with only 2.5 cups of white flous and then slowly incorporated it as I kneaded the dough.

These pretzel tasted fabulous. My only complaint was trouble rolling out which made the end result somewhat blemished. I did follow the note at the bottom, but I think they need a little more resting time in between. My family enjoyed them, in cinnamon and sugar.

My boyfriend abosolutely loved these. As soon as they came out, he hate em. I had to sneak a couple for myself. Personally, I find the pretzel to taste better when it's thicker. Thin is good too. Either way I will definately use this recipe again!

When I made these pretzels, I divided the dough, froze half, and used the other half for the pretzels.  They went so quick, I wished that I would have made the entire batch!  They were terrific.

We made these as a family project.  They tasted great.  Took a long time though but that may be because we had two kids helping.  We topped some with garlic salt, parmesan cheese and cinnimon sugar. We will make these again.

I have already made this recipe several times.  As a nanny I am always looking for a healthy after school snack and the boys love these.  It is always a special treat for them to get to help make these and they love getting to eat their own creations.  These pretzels are as good if not better than the ones at the malls around here.

The pretzels are a little too salty for a cinnamon sugar topping.  Next time, I'll add less salt if I want the cinnamon sugar topping.  The pretzels are delicious.  We'll be making them often.

We could not believe how much these tasted like the Mall version, only better!! And so much cheaper!! We will definitely be making these again.  Took a few tries until we got the hang of shaping the dough, but it was well worth the effort. Thank you, Jeannie!!

These were wonderful and easy to make.  I made the dough in my Kitchenaid mixer with the dough hook, so I didn't have to knead by hand.  My two young children had fun helping me roll out the pretzel dough.  I was hesitent to use parchment paper after reading some of the other comments, so I baked them on greased cookie sheets, and they didn't stick at all.  We'll definitely make these again!

Thanks to the rave reviews I decided to try making these this afternoon.  I dumped all the ingredients in my bread maker and let it do all the mixing, kneading, and rising for me.  I used the dough setting, but stopped it manually after the kneading cycle and let it rise in the machine for the hour.  I don't think I'd have made these otherwise.  Just rolling them out took some muscle power!  Using the bread maker cut way down on time and energy.

One other thing, others mentioned the pretzels sticking to the parchment paper...I baked the pretzels directly on dark (not silver, they stuck too) airbake cookie sheets and they come out beautifully!

Don't worry about getting them exactly pretzel thin and 3 feet long.  I think the best ones were a little on the fatter side because they are so light and chewy.  Mmmmmm!

Mmm! I have a fondness for Mall Pretzels, and since the one near my house moved from the mall, I have been in withdrawal. My sister and I had fun making these, and they were sooo good. Next time I will put garlic in the butter topping, just like my favourite ones from the mall. PS. These are way cheaper to make than to buy too!

I'm not a baker and was amazed at how easy these were to make.  They were a big hit with my friends.  The kosher salt is a little hard to control so you might want to try unsalted butter for the glaze before you sprinkle them with salt.  Delicious!

Very tasty, but I lost a lot of the pretzel because they were completely stuck to the parchment paper.  Also, directions on how to shape pretzels would be helpful for people who have never made soft pretzels before.

These came out perfect!! I didn't make any changes. I was nervous to try these at first because I was thinking they would be complicated with so many steps. But they were very easy to make and it was a super fun activity with the kids. My kids actually rolled out and shaped all the pretzels themselves. We followed the tip to roll them half way, let them rest, then roll out the rest of the way - it worked great.

We made these with beer cheese. YUM! IF you have baking experience, you will have no trouble. I just about died when I read the review that used wax paper in a 450 oven. Like many have said, boil them in water and baking soda. I baked mine on parchment with no spray and they turned out beautifully. The key to any "bread" is the proofing and kneading. if you haven't got the patience to do it right, then don't bother doing it. Apparently people need to he told to use a floured surface to knead dough. Anyways, I will definitely be making these over and over.

I really liked this recipe. The pretzels came out just the way I had hoped. It's a convenient recipe to make, with easily available ingredients. The only change I would make is to add the salt before baking. That way the salt will stick to the pretzel better.

Great pretzels! I made half of mine with garlic and salt, served with queso blanco. The other half was cinnamon and sugar served with home made cream cheese frosting. Im never buying mall pretzels again!

Yummy!  And so easy.  My batter was not quite firm enough to shape into pretzel shapes so I just made sticks.  Tasted great!

I have made this 3 times, and my father-in-law and husband both really love it. I also enjoy it, but I don't think this is the kind of thing you want to save for later or have leftover. Much better fresh in my opinion.

I made these as the recipe called for, my only change would be not to follow the length and diameter the recipe called for. I found the length was way to long, so I shortened it and made it bigger around, came out more like a pretzel.Other than that good recipe.

WOW real mall pretzels without having to go into the mall!! I had no issues with the dough but had no bread flour, so I used all purpose but added a rounded Tbsp of vital wheat gluten. I used the dough setting on my bread machine and it mixed it perfectly. The note about rolling to half the length and letting it rest, then rolling the rest of the way, was very helpful. I then followed one reviewer's instructions to boil the pretzels in 4 cups water with 4 tablespoons baking soda until they float. After taking it out I set them on Wire racks and let them rise. Then I used an egg wash and sprinkled salt on before baking. I baked them right on the racks so I didn't disturb them, and they only stuck a little after baking, not enough to tear or anything. They came out nice and dark and perfect! Yum!

Great recipe!  I used instant dry yeast (8oz packet), kneaded it for 1 min by hand, let it rest for 5 mins then started shaping it.  I switched out the salt topping with grated parmesan cheese -- it added a nice salty, crunchy texture.  These came out crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.

Delicious.  We just popped them out of the oven and in to our mouths.  Brushed with butter and used course salt before baking.  Very easy recipe for avid bread bakers.

Tastes great; I was hesitant to add so much salt and put probably closer to 1 1/2 tbsp salt. I made a swiss buttercream with some cinnamon added to dip them in and I would highly recommend that for anyone wanting a sweeter and buttery taste similar to Auntie Anne's cinnamon sugar pretzels.

Delish! Took the advice of some reviewers and boiled them in the baking soda mixture, but didn't change anything else. Great with mustard and over the top fabulous with cinnamon and sugar.

This was a hit! I did a test run prior to an upcoming party to see how it would turn out. I decided to serve them as a little appetizer at my daughterâs birthday party and every last one was eaten! I prepared the dough in my bread maker and baked on parchment and silpats.

Made the dough into pretzel bites .After rising,  I divided the dough into four. Rolled each one into equal lengths. Cut into about 9-12 sections and then cut again to make about one inch bites. After baking, I brushed immediately with melted butter. Took as a party appetizer and was the hit out of a huge assortment. Not one left over! Keeper in my recipe box.

I have made these many times and they never disappoint.  They taste and feel exactly like the pretzels you get at the mall! A downside however,  it was a little soggy but I think it can be improved with more dry ingredients. Loved these and they are so fun to make with family! :)

So delicious.  The only things I changed was that I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and I made 8 extra thick pretzels instead of a dozen.  Four on each baking sheet lined with parchment paper, they baked for 15 minutes.   These pretzels are absolutely identical to Bavarian Pretzel, if anyone here is familiar with that chain.  Maybe next time I'll use bread flour and see if they are more similar to Auntie Annie's, which are softer and chewier.  Right out of the oven I basted them in butter and sprinkled lightly with Kosher salt.  I'm going to freeze them, whcih is awesome since there are only two of us here.  I don't know if these pretzels will live long enough to experiment with different toppings.

I've made these several times and am still playing with the recipe. I use the ingredients exactly as listed. For the wash I hold the pretzels by the tips and dip them in and out of the baking soda solution. If it's good enough for a young Mennonite gal I watched making pretzels at a Lancaster County Farmer's Market, then it's good enough for me.

OMG!!  Best pretzels ever! My 5 n 7 yr old granddaughters both said Grandpa make these for breakfast tomorrow! Lol.  Recipe was perfect, I made following tweaks to cooking process:
1. Mix the brown sugar and 110Â° water.Do NOT Add salt at this point. Add 1 pack yeast gently, stir n let sit still for @ 20 mins (allows yeast to activate). 2. Add the salt and 4 cups of flour 1 at a time. (I used all AP flour.)3. I used my Kitchen Aide stand mixer with dough hook on 2 n let that run for 5 to 6 minutes.4.Lightly oil the mixing bowl and dough. Place a warm towel over the mixing bowl n let sit to rise for @ 1hr and 15 min. 5. Put dough out on lightly floured cutting board and cut into 12 equal slices. 6. Roll each peice as described in recipe, except my rope was only @ 18 inches or so.I then shaped 6 into pretzel shape n 6 into twists.Sit that aside to rise again for @20 to 25 mins.7. As that was rising I lightly oiled 2 cookie sheets and in a pot bring 4 cups of water and 4 tablespoons of baking soda to  a high simmer.8. Put 2 pretzels at a time into water, flip after 30secs and simmer 30 more secs. Remove from pot, shake off excess water(prevents sticking), place on cookie sheets, and sprinkle kosher salt on pretzels. Repeat step for rest of pretzels.9. Bake pretzels for 4 min,remove, brush with melted butter, n bake for @4 more mins. Follow recipe n these steps for best pretzels ever!

My kids always get a pretzel when we visit the mall, so I was in search of making this myself. After browsing a few recipes, i settled on this one because it was simple and I had everything on hand. I've made this 3 times in less than 2 weeks. As other reviewers have said, you MUST kneed the dough as long as it states (I use my KA mixer with the hook attachment). It makes the mixer jump around, so its best to hold it down or rest the machine on a towel. You MUST let the dough rest for at least the 1 hour. If you did both, then rolling, twisting and shaping should be rather easy. I don't blot the water solution off, since oven is hot enough to dry it off fairly quickly. But I do let the first pan rise while i finish twisting all the other pretzels. As soon as its out of the oven, I brush the tops with a warmed mixture of 4 TB melted butter, 2 TB light brown sugar, 1/2 tsp salt. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge, i toast it briefly and it still tastes great a few days later.

Easy to make recipe and instructions are easy to follow. I didnât butter them down after baking or added the coarse salt which made them taste somewhat bland under those circumstances of course. Crisp on the outside and fluffy inside. Making these again!

These pretzels are awesome! I did what other reviews did and boiled these in 4 cups of water and 4 tablespoons of baking soda. I also basted them with egg prior to baking. I did not roll them out to 3 feet as I felt that was too long and thin. I did about 1-1 1/2 feet instead and the result was nice fat pretzels about 1" in diameter. After baking I basted them with butter and ate with Rosarita's nacho cheese sauce. Yum!

I just used regular sugar and flour and followed the instructions.  I lined the pans with lard and halfway through the cooking time I flipped them because the bottoms start to brown quickly.  Overall, i Baked them for 7-8 minutes each.  To get that nice brown colour, melt some butter, sprinkle with salt and broil for 3-5 minutes

These were terrific! I followed the directions exactly. Even when my son turned off the oven's alarm without my noticing, the pretzels turned out chewy and delicious despite an extra several minutes of baking time. This was a great (and forgiving) recipe! Thanks.

I've made this recipe so many times I've lost count.  This pretzel recipe is definitely a favorite!
I make a double batch and then freeze them. To warm them up I just put one in the toaster oven and keep the rest in the freezer. That way the salt on top doesn't make the pretzel get that "soggy" texture.

We will be making this recipe again.  Kneeding by hand was difficult and I will try using my dough hook attachment for my stand mixer next time.  Also, I live in a dry climate and needed to add a couple extra tablespoons of water to get the dough to come together.

PARCHMENT PAPER, PARCHMENT PAPER, PARCHMENT PAPER.  Must use parchment paper.  When used greased, non-stick cookie sheet, stuck like glue.  No sicking problems using the parchment  paper.  I use large cookie sheets and can fit four on one sheet.  For easier rolling, roll out half length, let rest a couple of minutes, then roll out rest of way.  Stick tails down well to bottom or will come untwisted when removing  from baking soda/water solution.  Tasty treat.  Taste best when consumed same day.  Got soggy next day.

Basted mine with melted butter and garlic powder.  Topped it with kosher salt and they were very good.  I had a hard time getting 3 feet in length without tearing the things and starting over so some of them ended up a little chubby.  Great flavor though!

Made these for party appetizer.  I am surprised they lasted until the party, they are AMAZING fresh out of the oven.  We used regular table salt and it worked fine.  I cut them into bites, if you do that aim for 1 inch squares and cook for 6 minutes until lightly brown.  I wouldn't plan for these to be done more than 30-45 minutes before you serve them.  They sat for about 2 hours in our situation, and they were the first thing gone.  We served with cheese dip from deli.  It would be a good size for maybe 10 people, filled a 4 quart bowl.  Definitely will make again!!

These taste amazing!  The secret is in the baking soda bath.  Instead of the traditional pretzel shape, I also make pretzel sticks and I am considering making pretzel bites, too.  If you find that the taste and texture are not good after a few days, try putting them in the toaster.  They taste almost as good as new.

These are delicious. I made as directed, except I shaped them into hearts for Valentine's Day. These are so soft and perfect on the inside, with that great brown outside. 
Definitely bake them on  a parchment lined cookie sheet.

These are delicious! Made them for a beer tasting party and these were a huge hit with my friends. Made them with coarse salt on top and served them with a home made honey mustard (equal parts honey and mustard). Will definitely make them again.

I loved these, I made 2 batches mostly because I couldn't stop eating them.  I think next time I'm gonna add a little more brown sugar just to see what it tastes like, I'll make again probably for Christmas with family.

It takes some time but OH is it worth it! I prepped the dough and kneaded it before getting the kids to participate. It was a workout on the forearms but I wanted to make sure it would come out airy and soft so I kneaded for an extra 5 minutes.

You can substitute bread flour for whole wheat flour, it seems to have enough gluten to give the pretzels the right texture

These came out awesome.  On the first time I made them I didn't roll the rope long enough.   I ended up with a bun that looked like a pretzel knot on top.

Makes great rolls for sandwiches!   Also, try topping these with an everything seasoning.  It's easy to make and quite tasty.

Great dough!  The ratios for ingredients are near perfect as written and are easily halved, quartered, etc.  I've made this a few times now, each time making some minor adjustments.  Here is what I've settled on as to how I'll be making the dough from now on:

I made this recipe exactly as it said to as I have never made homemade pretzels. They were fantastic! I would not change anything about it. I did leave my leftover pretzels out in a ziplock bag on my counter overnight and when we ate them the next day they tasted just as good as they did hot. Of course they tasted a bit better when they were hot, but they were not chewy as some people stated they would be. I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone wanting a hot homemade pretzel. They were absolutely were wonderful!!

Although I liked the taste, the consistency was more roll-like than pretzel-like.  I'm not sure what I did wrong, but am exploring other recipes to determine differences in the process.  It was fine, but I have better recipes for yeast rolls.

Let me premise my review by saying I am not an artist... So I made pretzel bites instead! They turned out amazing! I live in  a high-altitude climate, and the only change I needed to make was letting the dough rise for another 15-30 minutes. 

The bread flour combined with regular flour and the baking soda solution is absolutely what takes this recipe from bread to pretzels, so you shouldn't substitute your flours for any others or skip out on the soda bath!

Pretzels are always better warm, so consider making them right before your event. They went great with queso!  Lastly, I used margarita salt instead of kosher salt because I wanted my bites to have a rock-salt look instead.

Really good recipe for mall style pretzels. My wife actually prefers this recipe over actual mall pretzels now.  Really good with cinnamon and sugar or dipped in velveta cheese.

This recipe was easy and sooooo delicious!!  The only thing I did differently was to butter and salt the pretzels BEFORE I baked them which made the steps easier and helped the browning.   If you're looking for a chewy, yummy pretzel, this recipe is for you - I'm giving it five stars!!!

This is easy and great! I followed exactly except I dipped unbaked pretzels in boiling water/soda mixture for 30 seconds each.  Also I brushed with egg wash and sprinkled the salt on BEFORE baking. Yay for salt that sticks to the pretzel! I turned the pans in the oven halfway through baking to get a good brown.   I did want some jalapeno pretzels, so I finely diced a fresh jalapeno and sprinkled the jalapeno on the dough board and rolled the last four to pretzel into shape with the jalapeno before boiling. That's what I'm talkin' about...

Loved this recipe! As others suggested, I boiled the pretzels in water with baking soda added. One thing I did find, if you live in the desert like me, there is no need to add extra liquid (as I usually have to).

Great recipe. I boiled the shaped dough in 6 cups water + 2Tbs baking soda. Then I let them rise for 10 to 15 minutes. Then I bake them at 425 for 15 minutes. They taste just like pretzel only soft.

We decided to make these as a family tonight and they are amazing!  We realized I was out of baking soda, so we used baking powder (2 Tbs), and used all-purpose flour only, no bread flour. Delicious with the ever so faint touch of sweet from the brown sugar.  We will be making these again.

Followed the recipe and instructions  in the video and turned out great. The temperature of the oven causes the non stick spray to burn. Will use parchment paper next time.

However I did find they grew stale quickly. The recipe also made more than a 3 person household could reasonably enjoy.

First attempt making this and I guess the water wasn't warm enough, second attempt and it all came out great! Work fast! Though I wish I knew the secret to getting them a little more golden...

I was a little afraid to try this,but so glad I did. These pretzels are delicious and better than any mall pretzel I've ever had! The recipe works exactly as is. I baked them closer to 15 minutes instead of the 8 to 10 recommended.  The only problem may be not being able to stop eating them.

These are outstanding and definitely like the mall ones and not traditional Philly soft pretzels.  But they are DELICIOUS!  I like to follow the recipe the first time and adjust on subsequent uses.  I made 1/2 recipe and used rapid-rise yeast (it's all I had on hand; don't need to proof and only 1 rise needed).  Used my Kitchen Aid and kneaded for 10 mins. with dough hook.  I froze the baked ones  and just put in 400 oven for 10 mins. and they were just as good as fresh-made!!  I will be making another batch to freeze so I have them on hand.  The dough was so easy to work with and I had no problems rolling them out.  I took other advice and rolled between both hands instead of on the counter.  Worked great!  Try them, they are really easy.

This recipe is good. I've been making pretzels for my children since they were little and have just a tip or two to offer. First, I bring the water and baking soda to a simmer and put each pretzel in until it floats, remove with a slotted spoon and blot up some excess water with a paper towel. Then to bake I sprinkle Just A Bit of cornmeal on the greased parchment. The baking soda gives them that 'pretzel flavor' and they brown beautifully!

I  not an avid baker, but I do make every now and then and I had been searching for an easy pretzel recipe. This was the first time that I have baked with yeast. These are super easy and taste really good...the only thing that I am trying to figure out is how I can save them so I don't have to eat all 12 at once!

The texture was great if I kept the bake time to 7 minutes. I found the dough itself to be rather bland. The toppings you use will determine if the pretzel is good.  I tried a couple of variations and found my favourite was garlic butter sprinkled with Parmesan.

So easy to make and absolutely delicious!! I didn't have bread flour, but they turned out great with all-purpose flour. I used a kitchen aid mixer to do the kneading with the dough hook. I let the dough rise in a greased bowl (with a wet towel on top) inside the oven with a small saucepan of hot water on the rack below the rack where I placed the bowl. I doubled the amount of water and baking soda to soak the formed pretzels in--thanks to the comments for this tip! I kept the water/baking soda  simmering in a pot and placed one pretzel at a time in the solution. When I removed each pretzel from the water, I placed them briefly on a paper towel before transferring them to a silicone mat-lined baking sheet (I didn't use parchment paper). They turned out golden and beautiful (without egg wash) on the convection setting of my oven at 450 F for 8 minutes. Thank you so much for the recipe!!

Everyone in the house liked them and I will make them again. The dough was perfect and next time I will try what another Allrecipes member suggested and boil them in 4 cups water and 4 tblspns baking soda until they float.

These didn't look like the mall pretzels for me, but they tasted amazing. I followed the recipe exactly the way it is written and I will not change anything when I make these again and again. This recipe was easy and delicious!

Each and every bite brings me back images of the last 17 years of my life working as a mall security guard before I fell and injured my back due to a faulty pump in the mall fountain nearest the food court. Even in those moments as I writhed in agony due to my shattered ankle and herniated disks in my back I new how much better life would be if I could know their secret. A gentle sweet white light. I almost feel as though that light is reaching behind my eye as the salt of these pretzels dissolves in my mouth and I type this review with belabored breath. I would do anything to protect these pretzels, as my body now writhes uncontrollably, and highly recommend pairing this dish with diet pepsi and smoked salmon if you can afford it unlike some people.

I made these a couple of years ago in two batches over two months. I didn't have all of the ingredients as listed but made some substitutions. The first time, they turned out marvelously but made a mess, the second time I made some errors in replicating the first attempt but they turned out alright still.

Both times, I made one half of the batch with salt and the other with cinnamon sugar.

It simply didn't taste anything like a pretzel. I thought I made it the way the instructions said, but either I messed up or this recipe did. When making it I heavily brushed on the baking soda solution to mimic a dip since they were unraveling as I did so. It did expand a lot which demented some of my more tightly braided ones, but it didn't matter that much, just make them thin and wide. After I was finished making them all and most of them had risen I went to brush them with a little egg wash and they deflated to my disappointment. After they got out of the oven there was a fight to the death to get the pretzels off of the foil, so butter it up or you'll lose that fight. The bottoms cook quickly, so be wary, but over all they seemed fine until I tasted it. It tasted like crappy bread. One good thing I did do though was use Hawaiian sea salt just before putting them in the oven. It made it taste at least a little bit better.

These were really good, but I messed up a lot on this when i made it. It's my fault, I didnt read the recipe before putting the dough on waxed paper, and then I had to peel it off to put it in the solution, and I stuck them on wax paper (another reviewer mentioned the disasterous results of that choice- charcoal paper and a smoky house.) I didnt have any real parchment paper so after the first go of it with the wax paper I used butter on top of the wax paper and they slid right off even though the paper got smoky. 

Next time I will know what to do!

These were a fun afternoon snack for my kids. A few liked the cinnamon sugar topping and one opted for salt so he could dip it in mustard. It was fun that they could be "made to order." We'll definitely make these again.

I loved it. I will say that I needed to change the baking a bit. I lowered the temp to 420. And I let the pretzels rise in there shape for longer and they came out wonderful.

Made these for the Super Bowl and they were awesome!  I am actually not a fan of these from the mall or sporting events but homemade definitely a fan!  The only down side is we made them the day before and they were much better right out of the oven.

This is a great recipe! I've tried others before that just taste like bread but I had no problems with this one. I didn't have bread flour so I just substituted regular white flour. I used country crock butter to grease the bowl and since I didn't have parchment paper I greased tin foil and used that on the pans. It is a bit of a time consuming recipe seeing as it makes 12 pretzels and you can only fit 2 pretzels on a pan at a time. I would recommend using only your middle rack as well so they don't burn on the bottom at all. I kept mine on the middle rack and none of them burned at all.. Sent a picture of them to my husband at work and he thought I went to an Auntie Anne's and got pretzels haha!

Followed to a "T" and the pretzels turned out perfectly!  Do not consider myself much of a baker but this recipe made me look like a pro.

Turned out great! We got 16 pretzels out of the batch we made. We sprinkled some with kosher salt and others with cinnamon sugar. Loved them both.

Great, easy recipe especially if you have a stand mixer with a dough hook.  I thought it turned out best when I used 3 cups all-purpose flour and omitted the bread flour.  I made regular pretzels, pretzel sticks and pretzel bites.  All turned out great.  Even my daughter who isn't big on pretzels ate one.  Thanks for the recipe!

Time consuming and required a fair amount of effort - but worth it! Very yummy. I couldn't for the life of me get the dough ropes pencil thin nor three feet long so I guess my pretzels were smaller and puffier than they were supposed to be, but no matter. They taste great. My first four turned out ugly/broken because I decided to bake them on a pizza stone and they stuck really badly. I don't know if it's my pizza stone that's not great quality, or if pretzels shouldn't be baked on one (because they were still a little wet from the baking soda bath when they hit the pizza stone), but I stuck to parchment covered baking sheets for the rest of the batch and that worked great. This won't really be something I'll make all the time, but I'd definitely make again!

I had difficulty making this in a larger batch.  The dough was so stiff, it caused my industrial mixer to overheat.

I do believe this recipe will make my picky grandkids happy, lol! OMG! This recipe is a keeper. I think these are better than the mall pretzels.... even though these ARE, indeed, mall pretzels. I gave a 5 star.  Thank you for sharing this!

Best pretzel recipe I have ever tried! They are so delicious and chewy. The best part is how easy it turned out to be to make them. I made my own garlic butter to brush on the pretzels. And would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone!

Have made these twice now and love them. The first time a I cut them up into bite size pieces instead of shaping them into pretzels and took them to work. My employees loved them. I brought some different things for them to put on them (salt, parmesan, cinnamon/sugar, but they loved them just plain. I made them again last night and made them into pretzels this time, only small ones and frozen them so I don't eat them all at once. Now I have snacks for a month.

I love Auntie Ann's, so I was a little disappointed when they didn't taste EXACTLY like then. However, I can't complain too much. These pretzels are delicious and came out perfect. I'll definitely use this recipe again.

Absolutely fantastic! After reading the other reviews, I wasn't really sure what to expect, but the recipe was perfect as is. The only thing was that I only had to add 3 1/2 cups a/p flour (I didn't have any bread flour left). I also cooked them in the middle rack in a convection oven on parchment for 7 minutes, which gave them a very nice, even browning. No burnt bottoms here! And I had absolutely no problem with the dough being overly sticky. The finished product turned out deliciously perfect. I think some of the people having problems may not have enough experience with making bread products. Bread can be very finicky (altitude, ambient temperature, humidity all make a difference), and after many years of making breads, personally, I know what to look for consistancy-wise. As you're kneading the dough (exactly 8 minutes for me), it should be tacky, but not sticky (kind of like the same tackiness as the sticky side of Post-It Notes), and very smooth.  They rolled out beautifully as a nice, thin rope, too. I will be using this recipe over and over again, as I LOVE soft pretzels! Thanks for posting! And for those of you that they did't work out for... try again! They're awesome when you get them right!!

I made these last night, and while the texture and appearance of the pretzels was great, I really felt they lacked flavor. I was expecting a yeasty and slightly sweet flavor, but that was absent. The flavor just seemed kind of...flat. I did end up needing another 3-4 T of flour because the dough was very sticky and unworkable.

Got back to the UK from a great holiday in the USA and was craving these. Found this great recipe as you just can't buy them here. They disappeared very quickly. I ran out of plain flour and substituted one cup for wholemeal bread flour and the result was great - even felt healthy!!!

I've made this many times now.  Always turns out perfectly.  I have tried it substituting one cup of whole wheat flour with much success.  Also made it with left over brewers yeast which was a hit.

Both my husband and I made these with unsalted melted butter and sea salt. They were absolutely delicious! We definitely will be making these again and again. They were made exactly how the recipe says and I even made a con queso to dip them in. (We also used spicy mustard for dipping too). Fun to make and delicious to eat plain or with your favorite pretzel dips.

My secret to making these? Turn them into "pretzel bites" and pretzel rolls! Just roll your ropes and cut with kitchen sheers or, segment out rolls and use the kitchen sheers to cut an "X" in the tops. I make a batch of the bites , roll down a brown paper lunch bag about halfway and fill it with warm bites and serve to the kids after school. They go crazy for them. Letting the dough rise long enough and using a very well greased baking surface are crucial.

I've been on a "Betty Crocker" spree lately, and my husband and I were on a date... We stopped at the pretzel place in the mall and he asked me if I could make these for him. I told him to find a recipe and I'd give it a shot! I must admit I was a little intimidated at first because the only yeast experience I had was in the bread machine! But I gave this recipe a shot and was surprised how easy it actually was! I want to thank everyone who wrote a review, because you really answered a lot of questions I had! Thank you Jeannie for posting this!!!!

Having read some of the reviews, I didn't even try to get the dough into a pretzel shape.  I just decided to make bread sticks.  The dough was soft and worked easily.  I brushed butter and Parmesan cheese on them before I put them in the oven.  I have no idea how they would have tasted the next day because my family ate the WHOLE batch!  Will make again.

Just pulled these out of the oven and YUM! Did take a while, but I think they are perfect for a lazy day :) Used my Kitchenaid hook for the kneading, rolling them took a bit a patience and practice. Couldn't seem to get them thin enough to look like "professional" grade, not that it mattered as they certainly tasted like it! Thank you so much for posting!

These were awesome!  I followed recipe exactly except that I did boil the water/baking soda and then dip the pretzels in it.  When they cooled, I put the leftover pretzels in a ziploc freezer bag.  Reheated in micro for 30 seconds and they were just like fresh!  I sprinkled mine with a little salt before baking, and my kids brushed them with butter while they were warm because they like them extra buttery.  A hit with the whole family!

These are very good. Not as good as the ones in the mall, but still great. I found them to be to thin if they where rolled "pencil thin" so I rolled mine a bit thicker. I did not use parchment paper, I just sprayed my pan with PAM backing spray and had no problems with them sticking. Overall great pretzels!

This is the first time I've made soft pretzels, and they were delicious!  Also, very easy to make and fun to roll and shape!  I found that my dough had to sit for 2 hours to rise, but other than that it was exactly as stated.  I will definitely make them again!

These are great.  I make them at least once a month.  I use regular flour with 2 tbps of gluten.  The texture and taste is spot on.

These came out very good!  I think if you were were using cinnamon, it may be best to include some of that when rolling the dough, as I didn't find the cinnamon sugar on top to be as good.  The butter is definitely a must to provide the mall pretzel taste.  Great also to top with sesame seeds too.  I also served plain ones with some honey mustard sauce or a cheese sauce, and the cinnamon sugar ones with some warm caramel.  Very good!

These pretzels were insanely delicious.  I didn't have much confidence in my ability to get them right but they are CRAZy good.  Mine were ugly and I ended up making pretzel rods but they still tasted unreal!

I've made these five times now with my grandchildren (ages 4,5,6).  It is an easy recipe, fun to make into shapes, and delicious to eat.  We made some with salt and most plain and brushed with butter when they came out of the oven.  My only constructive comment deals with the baking soda wash.  We used MUCH less baking soda than the recipe calls for.  I dissolved 2 TEASPOONS in about 1 cup water (in the microwave) and then put the solution in a flat dish.  I dipped the pretzels in the solution (rather than letting the children) and it worked out fine.  You do not need to waste all that baking soda.   You need the solution to make them brown, so they look like pretzels, but you do not need a lot.  We tried brushing the solution on the pretzels (and the children could do that) but the color looked best by dipping.   A WONDERFUL KITCHEN PROJECT.... will do again, many times, I'm sure.

These pretzels are the best I've ever made.  I have become semi famous among my friends at college for these.  I would suggest getting Kosher Salt for them.  Also change the toppings slightly with cinnamon sugar, Cheese, or caramel.

My first time making a soft pretzel. WHAT A HIT!
They were all gone 15 minutes after I pulled them from the oven and my neighbors were asking when I'll make them again! 

For variety, I use koser salt on some, Garlic salt on some, Ranch Salt on one, and cinnamon/sugar on some. {And 1 plain one for me :)}

Oh, my neighbor just called and asked for the recipe.

Very good! My oven only agreed to 400 degrees so I left them in a couple more minutes. I also need to master the rolling more....use butter. Just saw te editor's note now, oops!

I'll definitely make these again.

Since I've retired, I have been trying more homemade recipes.  I have tried other recipes tor the pretzels and these are the best by far.  I think using the brown sugar and using the bread flour makes this recipe unique.
I did take some suggestions from other posts and boiled them and also used Pam on a cookie sheet instead of parchment paper.
Either way..they are the best and my search ends here and another batch is in the works...

Made the dough in the bread machine, mixed the first four ingredients first, then added to pan.  As I always do for bread recipes I added 4 tsp of vital wheat gluten. The flavor and texture was great, kids raved.  I did briefly set the pretzel on a paper towel to reduce water drippage. Saved a few "naked" pretzels in ziplock bags, to see if putting the toppings on later, and microwaving before eating will be as good.

Epic fail.  The dough was so sticky you couldn't get it off your hands to even "roll" it into a pretzel.

I am not a baker...but decided to try it.  I have made these twice and both times the recipe has been spot on!  The first time I heavily under estimated how much they would raise the second time and ended up with buns that had a pretzel shape on the top.  Rolling the ropes out to pencil thickness helped the second time.

Excellent pretzels!  I made them exactly as the recipe indicates.  Be sure and knead thoroughly to have a nice workable dough after the rise.  Next time I will try brushing some of them with garlic/herb butter for variety.

The only recipe I'll use for pretzels. These are a favorite in my family and it always turns out perfect! 
I can usually only get about 3 cups of flour, instead of the written 4 but nonetheless it tastes and looks great!

I didn't have cake flour, so used all-purpose for the entire thing.  Also, boiled the pretzels for 30 seconds after shaping.  Extras were frozen -they were still quite tasty after a quick reheat in the microwave.  Will make again!

They are nice and chewy. Next time I might try letting them rise a bit longer then punch down the dough and let it rest before rolling it out. Very elastic dough!

The dough recipe is spot on!!! I twisted the dough in the shape of candy canes as we are nearing Christmas. As suggested by another reviewer I boiled the pretzels in 6 cups of water and 6 tbsp of baking soda until they floated, one at a time. Then I let them rise for 20 other minutes uncovered, basted them with egg and sprinkled coarse salt on the first batch and cinnamon sugar on the second batch. Then I baked them for 15 minutes at 425 degrees on a baking stone, and they came out golden and beautiful. I enjoyed the thicker pretzels the most, so I will roll them all fatter next time.

This is by far the best recipe I've ever discovered. I've been following this same technique with the exception of using bread flour and all purpose flour at 1:1 ratio. Otherwise no changes.

Excellent.  However, parchment paper is good to 400Â°F.  These beauties are cooked at 450Â°F.  The first 6 smoked up the house with the smell of burning paper.  The second 6 turned out beautifully with a little Pam.

I have never reviewed anything before but I just wanted to say, I made these with my 3 year old today and they turned out really good. I did follow some of the reviews that said to throw them in boiling water/ baking soda bath but that's the only way I really differed from the recipe. I also didn't top them with anything before baking because I'm trying to watch the salt intake of my two little ones. They don't taste EXACTLY like the pretzels you get at the mall but they're still really good. So glad I found this recipe since I've been craving soft pretzels since I got pregnant and this is way cheaper than going to the mall.

I'm not much of a baker or cook - but I tried my hand at these.  I dipped them in boiling baking soda bath (as others have recommended) and used all purpose flour.  I buttered and salted them before I put them in the oven.  They turned out great!  My husband was laughing at me while I tried to roll them out (which was a little bit of a challenge), but he sure is eating his words now! I cut the recipe in half and just made 6 pretzels, which was perfect for me - and I have a KitchenAid mixer too so I kneaded it on Speed 2 for about 8 minutes.  Trust me, if I can make these pretzels and have them taste as good as Auntie Anne's - then so can you!!!

These pretzels were awesome! Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out as good as mall pretzels. The one thing I did differently is to make pretzel bites rather than whole pretzels. I rolled the dough and than cut it into bite size pieces and baked them for only 15 min. The whole family devoured them!

I used 4 cups of all-purpose flour. The pretzels came out very tasty! I had 2, and my hubby had 3! The kids love 'em too! Thanks for sharing!

Great pretzels!  I was looking for a long time for a good pretzels recipe and this is it! Tempted by so many good reviews I've decided to bake them:) Not difficult to work with at all, though prep time is a bit long it's really worth it! I made little changes e.g. first I let yeast-sugar-salt-warm water mixture rest for about 15 minute until yeast began to "work" before i stir in flour etc another change I made is   I cooked each pretzel side for about 15 sec in the baking soda solution instead of just dipping them and the last change was a mixture of egg yolk and water instead of butter:) I highly recommend this recipe! Pretzels are simply great! Not too bready, not too hard, just delicious:)

Dough was sticky. Very difficult to work with. Pretzels tasted ok, but not like good mall pretzels.

I have made four different recipes of pretzels now and this one isn't my favorite. I hate to be pessimistic but although they looked the best they taste wasn't great. Others were right that the salt didn't stick to the but so i salt them before i bake that and butter them afterward.
for those who do want to try this i would suggest rolling a strand of dough around a cheap hotdog for a fun treat.
 Good luck! :)

Awesome recipe!  I've never made pretzels before and they turned out perfectly (well except a little mishaped, but oh well).  The flavor and texture of these is wonderful, worth the effort it takes to make these.  My boyfriend loved these as well, I sprinkled mine with a little parmesan after brushing with the melted butter.

Thanks for this awesome recipe. It was my first time baking using yeast and was a little apprehensive but made it through just fine. Pretzels turned out great and my neighbors, who are very picky eaters and harsh critics said these pretzels were better than the ones in the mall!!!
One minor change I made to half the batch was to salt them prior to baking and that worked out better than salting after removing from the oven.

These pretzels were really great.  I had a hard time getting the pieces thin enough so that after they rose, they were very thick. After taking them out of the oven, they didn't look very appetizing until I brushed the melted butter over the top.  For some reason, this step turns the crust into something that looks like a pretzel and tastes wonderful.  I would definately make these again.

If you intend to make salted pretzels salt them before you cook them so the salt will stick. That is how it is done in the mall pretzel places.

I love this recipe, it made me nervous when they weren't golden on top but they are delicious! I made them into spirals and sliced them to use as the bread for a sandwich-turkey with apple slices, Havarti cheese, and honey mustard. AMAZING.

Great pretzels, they stay soft for days.  I recommend brushing the pretzels with butter and sprinkling large grain salt on them before cooking however, that's how it's done when you buy them at the mall.

FANTASTIC!!  It was so much fun making these.  They turned out soft, yet crunchy on the outside, and the flavor was great.  I topped mine with either garlic salt or cinnamon sugar.  I'm thinking of creating dipping sauces of cheese and then one of carmel or icing sauce next time I make them . :)

Didn't rise as much as mall pretzels.   Roll them all out & form them then dunk in the water.  I completed each one individually and the water was too cool a few pretzels in so some didn't rise as much.

This was a good recipe though the end result tasted more like bialys than pretzels.  I think next time around I'd add more flour so it's easier to work with, then maybe also trying boiling it in the baking soda bath that others suggested.

This was my first time making pretzels and they came out great.  I separated the dough in half as only 6 pretzels would fit in my oven at a time.  Then I decided that 6 large pretzels were all that I needed, so I used the other half of the dough to make a pizza and bread sticks for dinner.  This was also rather good!

I originally hail from NY where I would buy pretzels from pushcart vendors on the street. These were every bit as good as the "real deal".

Yum! The first time I made these I missed the step where it said to let the formed pretzels rise 10 minutes so they weren't quite as good, the second time I saw the instruction and they came out perfect. We experimented with pretzel dogs and they were fantastic with this dough. New favorite thing to make. And they reheat so well too.

These were everything I was hoping for- I can't leave them alone! I am sure I will be using this recipe often- everyone who tried them loved them. I did use an egg white wash and sprinkle the salt before baking instead of brushing with butter afterwards, but otherwise followed the recipe(I didn't have parchment paper either- but will get some for next time).  Thanks for a great recipe!

I love these. Absolutely delicious, though I had some issues rolling my dough out. I ended up making them into bread sticks instead, just as wonderful though!

I have never ever tried to make pretzels before, it was a little time consuming, but they're SO worth it!!! Delicious, a little chewy, just like the mall only crispier on the bottom! Thanks for the recipe Jeannie!

Great recipe, but not Pretzelmaker pretzels. I followed this recipe exactly and it came out great, though I found the dough quite temperamental to work with. Its gonna take a few tries to make it better. All in all a good recipe and pretzel.

I was a little apprehensive about making this recipe.  I saw that there was no fat in it, and it makes a really stiff dough.  I am talking, REALLY stiff.  But you know what?  It worked like a charm.  These taste just like what you would get in the mall.  The only recommendation that I would make is to cover the dough with plastic wrap when it is rising as opposed to a cloth.  In my dry climate, at least, it's necessary to trap in as much moisture as possible.

These pretzels are great!! My daughters request them for breakfast or snacks quite often. They even asked me to make them for a party at school. Their friends are impressed that they can be made at home.

I made these last night. It was my first time making pretzels. These tasted very good!  The next time I make these I will make a few modifications. First, I will boil the pretzel dough as was recommended by other reviewers, and secondly, I will not try to make them three feet long!

This is a nice pretzel recipe, and it turned out well.  It is NOT, however, like a Pretzelmaker pretzel.  The Pretzelmaker pretzels are sweeter and don't have the soda water coating.  I like this recipe, but I am still searching for a true Pretzelmaker-like recipe.  I tried this because it came up on my search for a Pretzelmaker recipe, but I ended up disappointed again.

These pretzels were very very good.  However I wouldn't roll them out to the specified 3' length.   Mine turned out to be too thin for my taste.  I made one much shorter and really enjoyed the thick bready feel and taste of it.  The sweet/salty taste was perfect and my family took them all down.

Made pretzel bites for super bowl sunday. They were a hit with the kids and the adults. There is a bit of preparation time involved, but worth it! I served jalapeno cheese sauce and honey mustard as dipping sauces. Will definitely make again!

Simple, easy and fun with really GREAT results!  Soft, moist chewy goodness.  My only note is that I'd add a bit more salt to the dough, but i think that might be more of a personal preference.

I cut the recipe in half, boiled the pretzels as suggested, and only used all-purpose flour because I didn't have any cake flour. Results: it was good, but I found that it wasn't fluffy enough, very chewy. I will allow it to sit longer on the second rise the next time i make it. But all in all, good first run!

I am not good in baking at all, but decided to try this recipe and it came out OK, but not what I was expecting. To improve this recipe, next time I will put twice more sugar and vanilla. This will make the dough much tastier. My kids like cinnamon pretzels and caramel crunch pretzels. To make is also picture perfect I would sprinkle baked pretzels ( brushed with melted butter) with a mixture of brown sugar and cinnamon. The last pretzel I made I used brown sugar and cinnamon topping and it was so much tastier.

Surprisingly easy and very tasty.  I made the dough in the bread machine, used white wheat flour in place of all-purpose, and seasoned the pretzels with butter and spices prior to baking.  These are delicious topped with cinnamon sugar and drizzled with honey.

This was my first attempt making pretzels. Taste was 5 stars (kids loved them for New Year's Eve!), however, the instructions that included making 3 feet ropes did not make sense to me. Mine were only about 1.5 feet at the most. I'm confused as to how to make them 3 feet long. The dough started drying out a little bit, so I kept it covered up until formed. Making the dough in my Kitchen Aid (with dough hook) was the easy part. Rolling the pretzels was the hard part. I ended up using only half of my dough. I sprinkled some pretzels with sea salt and some with cinammon and sugar after brushing with the melted butter. Great the next day too!

These came out great.  I have never had much luck when it comes to dough which needs to rise but these were delicious and well worth the effort!

FUN!  This is a great recipe, and produces near "mall" quality.  Our only difficulty was figuring out how to produce the long ropes of pretzel dough without breaking them.

This tasted really good.  I took the advice of another person and sprayed cooking spray on the tray before I put them in the oven and they slid right off! Will definitely make them again.

I tried to follow this recipe exactly, but like others, I didn't have any bread flour, so I used all-purpose flour. The dough turned out REALLY stick and broke off a lot, I had to add a lot more flour. Even then, the pretzels were hard to shape and once baked, they lacked flavor. Won't be making these again, you just can't beat actual mall pretzels.

Very tasty, although as written the pretzels were incredibly large; I made them about 1/3 the size.  Quick and easy, too.

Forget the baking soda water. I tried that years ago and never cared for it. Last night, I just didn't feel like doing it. It wasn't missed. Everyone loved the pretzels. None were left! I used garlic salt, parmesan, butter, honey butter, salt and cinnamon sugar as different toppings for the pretzels. Loved it! Will definitely make again.

They tasted good but they look terrible.  Before I dipped them into the baking soda water they looked fine but afterwards they were sticky and not very pretty.  Not what I had atticipated at all.

These are unbelieveably yummy! I ate 3 big pretzels in a row because I just couldn't stop!  A few minor ajustments I made the second time I made these: Wait till you have rolled all your "ropes" before you prepare your pan of warm water with baking soda, otherwise the water will be cold before you get to dipping. Also, by far they taste the best freshly baked, so what worked best for me was only baking the quantity that would be eaten right away and refrigerated the remainder of the dough until I baked more the next day. Lastly, I buttered and salted BEFORE baking. This helped make them more golden and the salt to stick better. Coarse salt is a must!

This was my first experience using yeast, and I think it turned out really well...especially for the first try.  These pretzels are delicious and so easy to make!  Topped mine with butter then tried them two different ways: cinnamon/sugar, and grated parmesan/garlic.

These were really great!  My only comment would be to eat it immediately after you do the melted butter and salt (or within a couple of hours) since the butter will melt the salt and it looks kind of strange by the next morning.

These were very good! I made the recipe as is and they came out great. I worked on a smaller cutting board surface so I had a little trouble rolling the pretzels out and shaping them, they didn't look too pretty when I put them in the oven but once they were done they had puffed up and looked exactly like the pretzels from the mall. After reading previous reviews about sticking, I used foil on a cookie sheet and greased it pretty liberally with butter -- the pretzels stuck a tiny bit but because of the (yummy) crust on the bottom, with a little patience the foil peeled right off. After they were finished cooking, I brushed some butter on them and then grinded some coarse garlic salt on top. Delicious!

GREASE the pan or parchment paper!!!!!! I did not do this, and the were very hard to get off.  Other than that......very yummy.  The kids made their names and shapes, and finished it out with pretzels or if you are not too good at shaping pretzels, just make sticks!  Sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, very good.

They tasted pretty good, but I had a difficult time getting them shaped correctly, they ended up looking like lumpy rolls.  That's my own fault, but the reason I deducted one star is the texture isn't quite what I expected, I think next time I make them I will make the ropes thinner so they look like pretzels, and dunk them in a pot of simmering baking soda water instead of the wash in this recipe.

Very Good! Try adding a Tablespoon of Sourdough Starter, and then letting the whole dough rest overnight in the fridge before forming and baking the Pretzaas! Yum!!! also brush them with milk just before baking for a shiny gold look.

These are seriously amazing!  I tried them w/ butter and w/ cinnamon sugar, and they really do taste better than the ones at the mall.  The only thing I did differently was use a little whole wheat flour, and I boiled them in the baking soda water.  YUM!

This recipe is great.  I used parchment paper and thought it worked very well.  I didn't blot the pretzels, and I think the parchment paper helped keep the water from being a problem.  I like them dipped in butter and then in cinnamon-sugar mixture.  They are as good as the ones at the mall.

Yum! Just made them and of course had to have one! This is my first time making pretzels...fear of the yeast...and they turned out great. I did one batch with cinnamon sugar and the other with a little Kosher salt. Easy and tasty. Will make again!

This recipe is very easy and tastes amazing! Everyone has loved it anytime I make it, and they go really fast!  This time I decided not to put the butter on and put the salt on before putting them in the oven. In my opinion they turned out just a great, and this time they didn't get soggy as I found they do with the butter.  Can't wait to make them again!

First time I did all by hand. Second time I did in bread machine and just made pretzel sticks. Both times were equally good. These are just awesome fresh out of the oven with butter and salt. My only attempt at reheating them was disastrous - they were barely edible. But I will try that again - maybe a fluke? I found that my wax paper smoked at that high oven temp, so I just used a baking dish sprayed with nonstick cooking spray and it worked fine. A little crisp on the bottom of the pretzel, but I didn't mind that. I look forward to making these for snacks for others.

Excellent! I have made these twice - the first time I used a bosch and the dough didn't hold the shape well - kept shrinking.  The second time I made the dough in my cuisinart and it was perfect.  I brush on the baking soda/water mixture - less messy that way. Tastes great!

These pretzels are very tasty and easy to work with. They don't quite taste as good as auntie anne's but I won't kick them out of the kitchen either. They are good plain but awesome with a topping.

This was a awasome easy recipe to follow, they tasted so good the only thing I did different was put an egg wash on before I baked them. They dont keep well, but they are so good its hard to have leftovers anyway.

Very yummy!  This was my first real attempt at dealing with raw dough and I didn't find it very hard to work with.  I froze the extra dough and it reheated very well today.  I agree with the reviewer who suggested quickly putting the dough on a paper towel before putting it on the parchment paper so it doesn't get watery on the bottom.  I will make these again, it was a fun activity with my three-year-old!

These are even better than the pretzels at the Mall. You need to eat them the same day you make them so I used another user's advise and froze some. After freezing, you can take an individual pretzel out of the oven, run it under a little water, salt and bake the same as if you made the dough fresh. They were just as good as fresh.

This was a great recipe. Very easy and simple. They could be a bit more flavorful, but they are an easy canvas to customize. Also, the recipe is very flexible. I substituted brown sugar with just plain granulated sugar and it was just fine. I recommend cinnamon topping with sugar!

These were delicious! But TONS of work! We like them very much but it always takes so much time & work to make them. We also made a Pizza version of these, where we stuffed the pretzel with cheese & pepperoni, and put melted butter with garlic powder on top, then sprinkled a little cheese on them and salt. Very very yummy. :)

I made these pretzels for my kids since we dont live anywhere near a mall and they were craving soft pretzels.  My kids went crazy for them! The next day I made a double batch for my husbands women's wrestling team and the entire team loved them and wanted the recipe.  This recipe is a must have for those of us that never get to a mall! I agree with another reviewer that the dough should be covered with a damp paper towel to keep it from drying out while rolling the other pretzels.  The editor's note about rolling them half way then coming back to them helped a lot too.  These pretzels were fantastic and I will be making them again and again!

These were wonderful brushed with a honey/butter mixture then sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.  However, Alton Brown's pretzel recipe is a much better recipe if you want "Ballpark" type pretzels.  Overall, not a bad recipe.

This was such an easy recipe and so yummy. I followed the recipe...the only thing I did differently was I doubled the brown sugar to 4 TBS & I mixed 2 cups all purpose flour - 1 cup whole wheat flour - 1 cup German pastry flour. Turned out great. I just grease my cookie sheets well and basted half of them with butter & salt & half of them with butter & cinnamon and sugar while baking. I will definetly make this again and try different seasonings in it. Thanks for a great recipe.

My husband has been asking me to make pretzels for months now so I finally found a recipe and gave it a whirl.  These were so easy to make.  I used my kitchen-aid mixer and the dough came out perfect.  After rising and shaping we dunked them in simmering water with baking soda, let them rise, brushed them with an egg wash and sprinkled with salt.  While they baked we melted butter and brushed them when they came out of the oven.  They don't taste exactly like mall pretzels but I'm sure we didn't use as much butter as they do. =)

I made this recipe three times over the holidays and it was a big hit each time! I followed the instructions to boil with baking soda until the pretzels float. This only took a few seconds. I baked them and sprinkled with the kosher salt. I served them with some garlic butter and they went really fast!

I read the reviews and followed instructions making sure to knead in the kitchen aid and put on the warm stove for a nice rise... they turned out beautifully. Are they the same as the mall? In my opinion they're better and alot less expensive. better because of the taste and freshness. Yummy!

These were good, but had more of a bread taste than a pretzel taste.  I think this recipe would make a great loaf of bread!  I did use 2 cups all-purpose flour and 2 cups of whole wheat flour, which tasted great.  I would highly recommend lightly spraying the parchment paper with cooking spray.  My husband and I were peeling the paper off the bottom of the pretzels.  For those that find the dough hard to work with, it needs to rise until it has at least doubled in size.  I usually put my dough in a bowl, cover it with a towel and wrap a warm blanket (out of the dryer) to help it rise.  It really cuts down on rising time.

I really liked this recipe, just tried it 2 days ago and loved the results, they came out nice and soft on the inside (do not leave longer than cook time suggested) I accidently left a couple two or three minutes longer and they came out crunchy! My kids loved them covered with butter sugar and cinnamon!

this was my first time making pretzels and first time using yeast ever. I gotta say, these turned out yummy! I made them a much smaller size for a potluck, so I halfed the recipe and it made 14, and I set the oven at 375 and baked them for 6-7 minutes. I ate a couple already and I am thinking about making the other half of the recipe so I will actually have enough for tomorrow.

I also only used all-purpose flour, and I just sprayed my cookie sheets with olive oil spray instead of using parchment paper and i had no problems

Wow! These are fabulous. But I forgot to let them rise for the added 15-20 minutes...and they were STILL perfect. I kinda got tired of rolling them out so thin, so I divided the dough this time to 24 pieces and rolled them into bread sticks instead. Amazing. To save calories, after they were done, I sprayed them with butter-flavored Pam and sprinkled them with sea salt. Delicious.

Great recipe, made them for a halloween party so I shaped them into "pretzel bones" (essetially pretzel sticks with curled ends) and they were a hit.  I had no issues with the dough, it shaped out lovely and tasted divine!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are wonderful.  My dough wasn't sticky--but I had to knead it a little more.  Not too hard to make--for a pretzel recipe.  mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!

Yum! These were so good, esp. right out of the oven. Did 1/2 with cinn.sugar and half, coarse salt. I preferred the salt. The cinn ones tasted a bit like fried dough...good, but not when you are expecting pretzel. Next time might use less butter or spray. Left the fingers a bit greasy.

I made the dough in my bread machine, I followed the recipe exactly except I did not dissolve the yeast in the water only the brown sugar, I made a well in the flour and put the yeast in the well. The dough turned out perfect!

These are too amazing. I need to make them in single batches so I don't eat all of them at once. I replaced the 3 cups of all purpose flour with whole wheat, and used all purpose for the bread flour- they didn't turn out too dense or anything. At first they were a little too crunchy, but once they soaked up the olive oil ( I replaced the butter with EVOO) and salt, they were soft and perfect.

I give this recipe 4 stars, and recommend using the bread flour.

I was hoping this recipe would have produced pretzels with a dark brown crust. I can say that making the pretzels was not difficult, and the taste is great right out the oven.

My husband and I did not care for them at room temperature, and it could have been because I did not have bread flour and it seemed to make the pretzels a bit chewy.

These pretzels were amazing. I made the recipe exactly and they came out perfect. The recipe was incredibly easy to follow. The first batch I put on melted butter after baking, and the second batch I put on the melted butter before baking. Make sure you put the butter on AFTER baking because they are SOOO good that way (and better)! My sister didn't know that they were made from scratch because she thought they were so good. I sprinkled coarse kosher salt on most of the pretzels, put some cinnamon sugar on a couple, and a bit of garlic powder and coarse salt on a couple. These were overall just awesome! Chewy, soft, and PLAIN DELISH! I recommend this recipe to anyone and everyone! Oh and p.s. they are the best when they are FRESHLY BAKED so eat up!

great pretzels. Pair with a cheesy sauce, butter sauce, or a garlic marinara.  Watch out, they go fast.  They're fun for everyone to make, but there won't be left overs.  Fun to serve late night after some cocktails!

I just made these and they are so good!!  I love them!  The ingredients are easy to mix up.  I just couldn't roll them to a 3 foot rope, I did the best I could and it didn't really matter because these came out great!  I sprayed them with nonfat butter spray and sprinkled cinnamon/sugar and yummo!  LOL..  A definite keeper!

I followed the recipe, so I don't know what went wrong.  I baked for the 10 mins but the pretzels were still partly raw inside. What was cooked tasted ok. And as soon as they had cooled off, they turned hard.

These are delicious. I make these sometimes with sugar and cinnamon, or galic and parmesan as well. Made them into twists for my husband's work and had different dipping sauce for the different flavors. Used pizza sauce for parmesan, cheese for salted, and the sugar and cinnamon didn't need one, though a glaze would of gone well. They were all gone in no time. Love this receipe.

This is my second time making these. The first time I followed the recipe identically, and they were AMAZING! The dough is amazing to work with, I was done with rolling them within a half hour. Second time around I followed some other reviews about the baking of them, the dough was perfect and I didn't alter a thing. I boiled them in shallow baking soda water for about a little less then a minute. Then I baked them from 10 minutes at 400. They came out amazing! This is a perfect recipe!

Hmmm..These didn't taste like pretzels, the dough didn't have the consistancy of a pretzel. It tasted more like breadsticks.  It wasn't hard to make, I'm just a little disappointed because I was excited to make these and they didn't turn out well for me.

awesome, made salted pretzels, pretzel dogs, and cinnamon and sugar all with 1 batch. Although for some reason the dough didn't rise up very much, I still loved it though best recipe yet.

These were really great. Took a lot of time, but not too difficult, and it was definately worth it. I will be making these again.

These were possibly the yummiest things I have ever tasted, and pretty easy to make. Didn't have any course salt, so just used regular old table salt and butter. Planning on preparing them for my next party!

Brilliant - Absolutely brilliant! Thank you very much for sharing this recipe. This recipe took some practice on my part. I followed the tips of some users as well, and I think I have it down to a science. It is essential to let the dough rises properly. 2nd time making them I let the dough rise a couple times - It is a long process, but well worth it.

Very authentic flavour!

Excellent pretzels... fun to make!  I'm sure they would have tasted EXACTLY like mall pretzels if I had smothered them in butter, but I decided to go the healthier route.   We baked some extra lightly, then froze them... they were just as good when reheated!

Very good! I let the dough rise (after the baking soda dip) on waxed paper...then moved them to greased cookie sheet. They turned out really good! thanks for this recipe :-)

The result was a ho-hum pretzel with a seriously burned bottom. I would love to know what I did wrong, given the high praise from most other reviewers, but I followed the recipe to a T. :(

This stuff baked up more like bread than a pretzel. To me a soft pretzel should be chewy, not fluffy.

These are awesome!  I tried it with garlic butter and parmesan cheese, and dip them in a pizza sauce.  They tasted like Little Caesars crazy bread.

i've been using this recipe for years. i made it for the first time in a while a few weeks ago, and they still came out perfect. i love the brown sugar touch. i like to knead dough by hand, but i suppose you can use a kitchenaid or a bread machine to do the hard work for you. love this recipe. highly recommend it!

This recipe was my most successful Baking recipe I've ever tried! I'm just a beginner but the minute I took those pretzels out of the oven, they were eaten!! I had to put some aside for my boyfriend or else my family would have eaten those too.

Only change I made to the recipe was I used only all purpose flour instead of bread flour, but it turned out great anyways!  GREAT RECIPE!!

These were great--especially the ones with butter and coarse salt!  However, I put the leftovers in ziploc bags and they tasted soggy and gross the next day.  Just be sure to eat straight from the oven.  Delicious!

These are very tasty.  Couldn't quit eating them!  I only had 3 cups of white flour so I ended up using a  cup of whole wheat flour.  Still tasted great but they probably would be better with all white flour.

These were really good!  They get 5+ stars on taste.  I have no idea how you could roll these out to three feet though and I can't imagine they would be like a mall pretzel if you did.  Ours were not very pretty, we are going to have to keep making them untill we get them to look pretty:)

Amazing!  I made these for a New Year's party and everyone loved them.  I doubled the recipe and there were no leftovers.  I did some with the salt and served these with a cheese sauce.  Then I did the cinnamon and sugar pretzels and served these with slightlly warmed buttercream icing.  You could also use canned icing or something similar.  I will be making these again!

WOW-these pretzels were awesome!! I did make a couple of changes--I proofed the yeast/brown sugar for 10 min. and used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour but still came out great. I loved the flavor and texture. They really do taste like Auntie Anne's from the mall! I can't wait to try different variations on these like cinn./sugar, toasted almond,garlic parmesean,ect. To keep the coarse salt from falling off brush the pretzels w/ melted butter and then sprinkle the salt on before baking and then when they are out of the oven I brushed a little bit more melted butter just for the flavor and were terrfic!! My whole house smell sooo good!!!

This is the first time I have ever attempted soft pretzels.  They turned out so well and were very delicious.  If my husband liked them anyone will.  They were a big hit and were gone very fast.  Thank you for the recipe!!!!!!

I was in the mood to make pretzels after returning from Oktoberfest in Munich. While the consistancy is different than the pretzels I sampled in Germany, this is still the best version I've made! I will try to make them chewier next time. But they still get two thumbs up!

I ended up having to add about 1/2 cup more flour to get the dough right.  I used my Kitchen Aid with the dough hook and it worked well.  I also reduced the oven temp to 425 based on many other reviews.  I thought these were just okay but my kids loved them and they were gone by the next day.  I sprinkled some with cinnamon sugar and some with fresh ground sea salt.

Excellent recipe!  Make sure you let the yeast soak for 10 minutes before adding flour.  Pam works great on the baking sheet, no need for parchment. Roll dough so that it is at least as thick as your thumb. Nugget shapes or sticks are the easiest shapes.

These were delicious when they were fresh, but the leftovers the next day were tough and chewy and not good at all, even though I stored them in an airtight container--we ended up throwing them all away. I probably won't use this recipe again unless I'm having a crowd over and know they'll all be eaten fresh and warm.

These pretzels are to die for!  I rolled the pretzels out a little thicker, but did not make any other changes.  Best when eaten straight from the oven.  Will make these again (soon)!

the pretzels are really good and definitely taste like the mall version.  the only thing i would change is in the instructions the recipe says to roll the pretzels into pencil thin.  mall pretzels are pretty thick and next time i would make mine thick too just to get that chewy inside.

I wanted these to work so bad!! They were so good straight out the oven, but when I served them the next day they were not very good. We did put them in the toaster to try to salvage and they were okay.

I just made these today and thought they were really good - 2 of my 3 boys loved them.  Their favorite way to have them is with butter, cinnimon and sugar.  My husband and I like them with butter and fresh parmesan cheese.  I didn't think they were hard to make, but they are time consuming.  Also, I noticed that you really don't need to let them rise again after you dip them in the baking soda solution as the recipe indicates because they rise to a perfect size on their own while baking.  They were really good, but not 5 stars "the best" rating.  I will make them again though.

These were not super hard to make, although the rolling out into thin ropes was a pain.  I added about 1/8 c. extra water to the dough because it was really dry. I also didn't want to drench them in butter, so I sprayed them with a spray bottle of water and ground sea salt over them before putting them in the oven.  They were tasty, but much more like a "Pretzel Time" pretzel than a "Hot Sam's".  I might make them again if I get a hankering!

these are soooo good. I've been craving pretzels all week. theyre perfectly chewy and salty. I had a little bit of trouble with shaping the dough but thats not because of the recipe, just my own clumsiness. All in all, I'll be making these again.

These came out perfect! We topped some with salt and some with parmesan cheese. We also roasted some chopped garlic with olive oil and salt, then spread that on a few. Delicious.

This was a good recipe all in all but I prefer the buttery soft pretzel recipe personally.  They had good texture, and were easy to make but lacked something in the flavor department.  I will try again maybe tweeking it a little to my liking.  Thank you for sharing.

It is not really a mall pretzel, but it was good! It is like a homemade soft pretzel. I brushed the baking soda mixture on the pretzels. I found dipping them too difficult. I also brushed them with butter half way throught baking to give them a more golden look and then again after baking. Very good and still soft the next morning!

The dough is so lovely to work with.  The pretzels baked up light and fluffy and chewy all at the same time.  A keeper for sure.

This was AMAZING!! Auntie Annes just shut down in our mall, so we've been pretzel-less for a while! We added some diced jalepenos and sharp cheddar cheese after kneeding the dough and baked it into the pretzel! My husband is so happy! Thanks so much for this! Also, if you don't have the parchment paper, you can use the silicone rubber baking sheets. They work just as good.  Be sure to add some velveta cheese dip and some fritos jalepeno dip for a dipping side!! Thanks SO much for sharing this! A definite 5 star rating from us!

Mine seemed a little thinner, so I'm just not sure if I'm just not cool enough for these.  But I will tell you this - this is a recipe with A LOT of work!  It took me forever to roll these...definitely not something you just "whip up".  You will need to block out some time, or sweet talk some friends or family members into helping.

I love these pretzels, but I admit this is the only recipes I have tried for hot pretzels.  I used garlic salt on it and seem to like that the best.  And rather than rolling them into twists, I sometimes just make pretzel sticks, about 5" long.  I prefer them a bit thicker so rather than rolling them pencil thin, I like them when they are more like thick markers.  Thanks for the recipe!

Super easy.  Didn't find it too be too time consuming at all.  My 7 and 8 year old sons helped out rolling the dough between their hands.  We also dipped some of them in a sugar-cinnamon mixture.  I baked them at the reccommended temp and time and they turned out nice and crispy on the outside but not hard or burnt.

Was really excited to make these after reading all the reviews...but unfortunately, I wasn't overly impressed. In comparison to a big soft New York street pretzel, these pretzels didn't have a strong pretzel taste and the pretzel skin was somewhat crusty (similar to a breadstick) rather than the traditional smooth, soft and shiny skin. 

As a breadstick (both flavor and consistency), this recipe is fantastic -- especially good with butter, brown sugar and cinnamon. I would also recommend cutting the dough into 9 pieces (rather that 12) and rolling each one a bit thicker (double pencil width) and longer so the holes don't close.

These were great!  I followed the recipe exactly (except I lowered the temp to 425 for 7 minutes) and the pretzels were gone in minutes.  I have never cooked with yeast so I was a little bit scared but my small group ate them immediately.  I am planning on making more to go watch the Colts game on Sunday!

Couldn't believe how good they were. I rolled some raisins in half and covered them in cinnamon sugar and just salt on the other ones. Came out great next time I'll try to roll them a little thinner though.

The pretzels were very good nevertheless they are best eaten right away.  I will make them thicker next time because that's how my kids like them. I also had to reduce the temperature and amount of time baking to 7 minutes because my oven must be too hot and the first ones to come out were overdone.

These pretzels are great and easy to make! My whole family loves them. The hardest part is waiting the 15 minutes to let them rise! We were all very eager to get them out of the oven so we could eat them! We just brushed with butter and used kosher salt, thanks so much for this recipe!

These DO taste just like the pretzels you get at the mall!! My grandchildren love to roll out the dough and make the pretzels into their OWN shapes...I also let them brush on the butter and sprinkle on the salt OR cinnamon sugar...then they get to eat their creations!!

These were awesome!! Idid not have parchment paper on hand, rather I just put them on the baking sheet and they came out fine- a bit hard to remove, but nevertheless, they came out perfect! 
Will definitely make again!

These were easy to make. However, I found that the dough was too soft for my liking to shape properly. The pretzels also weren't as chewy as I would have liked them to be, but they  taste better than the pretzels at my mall at least!

I don't know if I did something wrong or what but these did not turn out as well as I expected...They were quite rubbery and were hard to roll thin enough without breaking.  The kids really enjoyed them though, hence the four star rating.  I may try again just to see if they turn out better.

these were perfect!!  My first batch darkened  quickly on the bottom, so I moved them to the top third of the oven and they were great!  Eggwashed and salted them before baking- beautiful and delish.

This is a really good recipe for pretzels, I don't know if its the best...I have another recipe for pretzels also, I seem to go back and forth between this one and my original. I like the idea of the baking soda bath---gives something extra to it!

Really good. The best part was how simple they were. Don't be tempted to change the recipe. The butter brushing with salt works fine. No need for an egg wash or anything. I used raw sugar instead of salt on half for my daughter and she loved it. Husband ate three out of the oven. No reason NOT to make these.

Delicious!  I have a hard time rolling out the dough any longer than 2 feet - that works just fine.  We like to sprinkle with coarse sugar and cinnamon and dip in cream cheese frosting for an extra special treat.

These pretzels were surprisingly easy to make - I formed all my pretzels before dipping in the baking soda and water, as one reviewer had suggested. I will definitely, defintely make these again. Tasted just like Wetzels.

We have made these twice now and both times they did not turn out like they were supposed to (we followed the recipe exactly).  Not sure what we are doing wrong.  The dough was just too gooey to work with, so we could not form pretzels.  Instead, we made them into "rolls" and they tasted good.

this recipe is brilliant! my family and I just finished our first set.. we all made our own shapes (and some had raisins!) and when they were done, we had a "pretzel-making station" which had cinnamon sugar, butter & sugar frosting, chocolate chips and caramels (hey, I have a seven year old!). they were amazing! we followed the recipe exactly (well, except for the raisins!). thank you so much for this recipe!

My 13-year-old daughter made these for a school project and the entire class loved these -  she added cinnamon/sugar instead of salt for the topping.  She plans on making these again

These are worth the work!  They taste exactly like the mall pretzels.  I didnt use parchment paper, I just sprayed some pam on a cookie sheet.  My only recommendation would be to not butter and salt the pretzels until you eat them b/c when I stored mine w/the butter and salt and went to eat them later the salt had dissolved and they were sort of soggy (but still good).  Next time I will store them "naked" and then re-heat and add butter and toppings.  Will make again!

These were a complete disaster for me.  I must have done something wrong since everyone else gave them such good reviews.  I followed the directions to a T but they just did not come out good at all :(

This recipe is very good.  Any little flaws my pretzels had were due to my own pretzel-shaping inexperience, and not the recipe.  However, I thought it was a lot of work, and probably won't make these again.

My mother gave me this recipe and I couldn't believe it.  It was wonderful and while ours may not look as pretty as those at the mall they taste every bit as good.  I follow the recipe exactly and made no changes and they turned out beautifully.

This is a terrific recipe.  If you roll the dough into shorter 'snakes' and curl it around to make circles you end up with little bagel pretzels.  Excellent.  My family loved them.

i am addicted to soft pretzels. and i work in a mall so i spend a lot of money on them.  so when i found this recipe i had to try it.  i think i'm going to save myself a lot of money by making my own pretzels.  these are so good.  i think they are better than the ones i get at the mall.  they take a lot of time to make but it is totally worth it.

These pretzels were very good (not quite as good as mall pretzels, though).  I substituted 2 of the 3 cups of all-purpose flour for whole wheat flour.  I used the dough hook on my kitchen aid to kneed the dough and it came out nicely and the pretzels tasted very good.  I used the technique that I watched the pretzel makers at Auntie Anne's use to form the pretzels- they looked great!  Next time I will make them bigger and I will try the suggestion of another reviewer and boil them before baking them.

This is as good as it gets as far as results. The one thing about this is that it is by far the stiffist bread gough I have ever made requiring much muscle power for kneeding.But bear with it and a great reward will be yours

Not exactly mall pretzels but still very good.  They key is to get the dough very thin before the last rise.  It takes time to roll them out to get them as thin as they need to be.  And when you think they are thin enough..keep rolling because they probably aren't.  Very good taste...worth the effort.

I let the bread machine do the hard work, the dough was easy to work with once it was done. But I did not think these had a pretzel taste at all.

I had to try this recipe twice before I got it right.  The first time I added the flour to the wet ingredients.  It was just a soup.  The second time I added the wet ingredients to the flour by making a well in the flour.  Make sure your water is the right temperature for dissolving the yeast.  I twisted my pretzels instead of trying to make them into pretzel shapes.  They came out great!

I like the German and Swiss pretzels a lot, and although these don't taste EXCACTLY the same, they are excellent! The dough was very sticky and I almost decided to stop, but I continued and the rolling was very easy. I think pencilthin is too thin, I made them as thick as a sigar. This is a great recipe and the kitchen smells so good! Eat them warm.

AWESOME!  I have baked breads for years, but never made pretzels.  I tried this one after reading all the reviews from the recipes on this site.  This looked easy.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added 1 more tablespoon of white sugar to the brown sugar.  I made the dough and let it rise in the frig because we had to go out.  Came home and put the dough in the oven with a pan filled with hot water just to warm the dough.(oven off)for about 15 min.  Then followed the rest of the instructions.  Baked only 7 min.  They came out light but sooooo soft.  Everyone said they were better than the mall.

Yum! I'm eating a pretzel as I type this! These are delicious - light, chewy, nice yeasty flavor. (My pretzel-forming skills need some work though!) I drizzled them with butter then sprinkled some kosher salt on top. Perfect. Thanks, Jeannie!

Yummy, but I wouldn't say these taste like the ones you get at Auntie Anne's.  The ones at Auntie Anne's are much, much sweeter.  Regardless, these pretzels tasted great, were soft and chewy and were a lot of fun (and easy) to make for my 7 and 5 year old kids.   Even the 18 mo. old "helped" roll out the dough!  The kids polished off half the batch as soon as they came out of the oven and are already asking when we can make them again.  Making pretzels definitely held their attention longer than baking cookies! 

I give this recipe 4 stars only because I don't think they taste like Auntie Anne's, but my kids would definitely give them 5 stars or more.  They liked them even better than Auntie Anne's.

Theses didn't last the day.  I made them for my 2 toddlers, but everyone loved them!  We made half with sea salt topping and half with cinnamon sugar.  For sure a family fav!

So good and easier than I thought (I don't usually have good results with dough!) I rolled mine to pencil thin, like it says, but they stayed very thin, so I rolled some a bit thicker and they were perfect.  An egg wash before they bake might add that shine that was missing, but the taste was great and the texture was soft and chewy.

These just came out of the oven and look real nice, however, DO NOT use parchement paper. It all stuck to the pretzels and I had to throw the out.  NOTE: I am going to agree with another reviewer and NOT roll them so thin. I did a couple of think ones and they came out just like the picture. The flavor was good what I could scrape off the parchment so I gave it three stars.

I had a good time making these pretzels. I made the initial dough in the bread machine on dough cycle and then rolled them out. THis was a bit tedious and time consouming but the dipping in the water-soda mixture was easy to do. I let them rise and prior to baking I basted the pretzels in an egg wash and added sesame seeds. I baked them and then used a pastry brush to brush on a garlic/melted butted mixture.. it was delicious! THis is time consuming but since Im in Australia and we dont have many pretzel shops it was fun to do and a special treat.

Came out pretty darn good, even though they weren't my idea of "mall pretzels"  I didnt have baking soda, so I didnt dip them in the water bath, and I baked them on a cookie sheet I sprayed with a little bit of veg oil.  When I took em out of the oven, i dipped them in butter and spinkled some salt on top...YUM! Thanks for an awesome recipie!

Delicious right out of the oven. I brushed on the soda/water solution and baked them on a Silpat mat. No sticking at all! It takes some patience to roll these out to the right thickness. I thought I had, but they puffed up in the oven and looked more like pretzel rolls. The thinner ones definitely had the better texture. I'd make these again.

We read Walter the Baker by Eric Carle to my four yr old who then decided we should make some pretzels.  So I went on a quest for a recipe and found this one.  We used only 1 cup of all purpose white four and the rest we used whole wheat flour and wheat bread flour.  They turned out yummy!  My kids loved them and we read the story while we ate them hot from the oven.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were great just out of the oven, but forget about leftovers. Make sure to grease your pan well or else you won't get them off. Fun treat to make.

These were fantastic. Not a beginner recipe, though. It takes some patience and lots of flour on the kneading surface. They must be eaten within 24 hours, though, otherwise they become stale. If yours don't turn out, please consider the maker, not the recipe...it's not the recipe's fault!

Good recipe.  I used all regular flour, and by 30 minutes rise time, the dough had risen to triple it's size.  Needs salt for sure.  Thanks Jeannie!

These pretzels were absolutely fabulous and fairly foolproof.  My six year old and I made these together.  It took us forever to roll them.  As you can imagine, they weren't all rolled thin as a pencil:  some were skinny and some were fat.  By the time we were dipping into the baking soda solution, the temperature was cool.  We even took the pretzels out before 8 minutes because they were browning quickly.  The results - delicious anyway.  Thanks!

Give the lady a break!  Those were pretty darn good!  I have tried to make these before and last I made was the darn boiled kind, way too much work for what you got.  I used the brush on baking soda solution and it worked just fine.  I used only regular flour.  They did not stick, I took them off the parchment right away.  They were delicious! Not pretty, but very very good.  And look at all the money I just saved!  Thanks!!!!

They were just OK for me.  I was expecting the really soft kind of pretzels that you might get at Pretzel 
Maker.  These turned out more like the harder ones.  If that is what you are looking for..the recipes is probable perfect.

These pretzels are terrific, Thank You Ms. Yee for sharing!!!  I did find it easier to stretch the dough only two feet or so, bath the dough-drying the drips, then finishing the stretching.  But next time I think I will not make them quite so thin.  I don't know the monatary savings (I am not a mall shopper) but the memories of a warm kitchen filled with the smell of yeast is priceless as I look back on my childhood and I am sure the same will be true for my daughter.  Oh yeah, if you do not have parchment paper--a greased baking sheet worked great for me.

They weren't big, chewy pretzels, they were just kind of so-so plain white bread. The prep time is way off.  If you have 1 hour and 20 minutes rising time, how can you get the whole thing done in 30 minutes?

The dough was really hard to work with.  I found rolling it from right to left in an M shape worked the best.  I don't know.  And dipping it in the soda was a total failure.  I brushed it on after I destroyed a couple and that worked much better.

As for taste, they tasted great and did not last in my house.

I've always wanted to try making pretzels, but having had the experience once, I don't think I will be doing it again.  The taste and texture of these were great, but they take a long time and a lot of work.  Making the dough was easy, especially with the help of a Kitchen Aide mixer.  It did require a little more flour to prevent stickiness (I only had all-purpose flour).  Rolling the dough was no problem either.  But then....  The first batch stuck to the parchment paper.  So I took the rest of the unbaked ones off the paper and put them right on a greased cookie sheet.  The first of those also stuck, but the later ones were fine.  Think about it.  You put the wet dough on paper and let it sit for 15 minutes rising; water and flour make paste.  The paste bakes in the oven, cementing the pretzel to the paper.  Oh well.  As my husband said, "Everyone needs a little roughage."  I only made salted ones and they were very good.  A little salt goes a long way.

Excellent! Not like what you find at the mall but still good! I think that if you are going to cook this, you should be careful. I set of the fire alarm when I was taking the pretzels out of the oven. Calles over 2 fire truckes. I therfor would not recomend it for those with a sensitive smoke alarm nearby.

Very easy to make and quite tasty, but nowhere near as chewy as I'd like.  Will try a boiled pretzel recipe next time.

These were definitely tasty but it won't stop me from going to the mall to grab some pretzels once and a while! I sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar and ate them hot but they were rather hard. Next time, I'll use butter in the dough.

It was very fun and easy to make this bread.  My boys age 7 and 4 and their 5yrs old friend made it together.  We had so much fun!!  We even had a ruler and measured the rope to 3 feet!  Fun learning experience.  Actually I might not make the rope as long next time as I like it thicker.  I didn't have a parchment paper so I used wax paper to let it rest.  Mistake!!!  The wax paper didn't come off well at all after being baked.  So I took the unbaked pretzels off of wax paper and put them on the greased cookie sheet.  It baked fine but had rougher finish!  We put butter on all then brown sugar and sugar on some, garlic salt on some, parmesan cheese on some, and kosher salt on some.
They were all delicious.  Thank you!

These were fairly easy to make and were delicous fresh out of the oven.  However, the second day they were not good.  3 1/2 stars

These are terrific. I made them for a party with a large group of children. They all rolled their own and had a great time. When we sprinkled them with cinnamon & sugar - there wasn't a crumb left!

A must try!! I didn't have Kosher salt so I used crystal sea salt. Also I didn't have bread flour so I used 4 cups all purpose flour. In addition I totally omitted the melted butter part. After we did the soda bath we sprinkled our toppings on.We used salt on some and cinnamon/sugar on the others, just keep a watchful eye on them if you use the cinnamon sugar as with the high temps it will burn quickly. These were an extremely fun project to do with the kids(even the big kids)! I think they are so much better than the frozen pretzels that I have purchased. Just give them a try. I'm adding them to my personal KEEPER list! Thanks Jeannie!!

I love this recipe! I had no problems with dough and rolling it. Dough needs lots of kneeding. It didn't took 3 hours like some reviewers said, I followed the introduction I found this site how to do dough and it was ready in an hour. Absolutly a keeper, will use this again and again and again

I love this recipe!  I have made it several times since!  I like to make them with Garlic salt on top and lots of butter!  I dip them in pizza sauce and they are awesome!  I used my kitchen aid mixer and it was invaluable to this recipe.  The key is kneading the dough well.

I found that these pretzels were not pretzels. I think that they are more along the line of breadsticks, especially with the garlic salt topping. They were not unpleasant but they were not pretzels...

The recipe should have been more precise.  I followed the recipe exactly and did not spray  parchment paper with nonstick cooking spray.  What a huge disappointment!  I couldn't even get the pretzels off of the parchment paper to taste them. :(

Yes, these were easy to handle while making.  Yes, these were soft.  Yes, these were chewy.  NO they did not taste like pretzels.  I followed the recipe exactly and was fairly disappointed when what came out of my oven was just bread with no flavor- and especially not the pretzel flavor I was craving.  I've tried garlic, salt, and cinnamon sugar varieties, and all three left my tastebuds yearning for a big pretzel stand.  Try another recipe.  Sorry Jeannie.

I am a 19 year old college student who is famous for my lack of skills w/baked goods. I decided to try these one day in my tiny kitchen and they tunred out perfectly. If I can make these and not mess them up, anyone can! I make the pretzels a little bit smaller because I don't have the counter space to roll the full length, and ended up with 18. I definantly recommend this recipie for anyone. :)

These were pretty good, but I don't think they deserve quite so rave a review.  They really aren't much like my mall's pretzels-- they aren't quite as flavorful and "yeasty." Still good, though.

I couldn't believe how much these were like the "mall pretzels".  My kids said they liked them even BETTER!  I never thought I'd be able find the recipe for this, let alone make them!
5 stars all the way!!!!
