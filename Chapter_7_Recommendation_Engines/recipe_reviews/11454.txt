They were TERRIBLE!  There has to be something wrong with the directions for the ingredients.  This was a sloppy mess - no way in the world to make into balls.  Please have the ingredients re-examined and adjusted

What a mess of a recipe.  A total waste of good ingredients.  
Did you drink most of the sherry before making these cookies???

I wish I had read the previous review before I gathered all the ingredients for this recipe.  There is too much liquid in it to be able to form into cookies.  I made bars instead, which were tasty, especially because of the fresh nutmeg that I used.  But, I was disappointed.  Not "dangerously delicious."

I took a big chance on trying this receipe based on the previous ratings.  The end result, horrible.  I reduced the quantity of liquid and it was still a complete mess.
