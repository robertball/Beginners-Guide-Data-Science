This was better than I had expected, it was great (the second time!). I did change it up a bit just by adding about a half cup of orange juice, 1 tbsp zest, and salt and pepper to saute the onions and garlic in, which was a good help. The first time I made this is was not quite enough flavor, so with the added juice, seasonings and zest, the flavors really improved. I didn't use any oil, just because the added fat isn't necessary but when my skillet came up almost dry I added a touch of water (2 tbsp). Also, I did put a good amount of lemon pepper, salt and garlic powder on the fish. I topped it with the onions mixture and juices and then let it all sit covered in my fridge for 4 hours before I cooked it. Like I said, it was great! Hope this helps.

We loved this recipe and it was very easy to fix. Will definately make again. We used olive oil to sautee the onions and garlic. Also used a little more garlic than the recipe calls for.

I thought this was very good, but it was missing a little something.  If you like halibut to begin with, you will like this recipe, as the other flavors in the dish are very understated and mild, so you mainly taste the fish.  I did use an extra clove of garlic and added lemon zest along with the orange zest.  I think a little spice - maybe a dash of red pepper flakes or a chopped jalapeno - would benefit this one greatly.  Still, a good recipe, fast and easy to make, too!

Really good! I can see this same sauce being delicious on a variety of fish. Light citrus flavor that didn't overpower the fish but left you wanting more.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  The citrus taste was very light.  My husband had fish that he wanted to use so I needed a recipe for Halibut.  I usually can't stand fish but did enjoy this and finished the small portion I took.  We made no changes at all.

needed more orange flavor for me.  I added 1.5 tsp grated orange peel and that worked for me.

This recipe was amazing.  The flavors were great.  We had fresh halibut flown in from Seattle and this recipe gave the fish the right amount of flavor without overpowering it.

I found this a little bland and the lemon/pepper seasoning actually took away from the taste of the orange and lemon.  I will try it again but will want to perk it up some.

Absolutely awesome! The main thing I changed was the cooking method (cooked each filet wrapped in parchment, same temp & time - this method keeps fish incredibly moist). Only ingredient change was to bump up the amount of juices, and add both lemon & orange zest to each parchment pouch. Hubby's absolute favorite fish recipe now - thanx!!

Wow, that was delicious!  I took it out of the oven and sprinkled a little sea salt on top, just a little sea salt and it just exploded with taste.

Nope...it did not work out for me. I could not really taste the sunshine. It just tasted plain. Sorry, but this wont make it to my table again.

I made this last night and it was so yummy! I made a few slight modifications. Some of the reviews indicated that it was lacking in flavor so I lined the bottom of my baking dish with thin lemon and orange slices. I also used an extra garlic clove in the onion/orange peel sauté. The filets soaked the flavor up and the results were great!

A delicate hint of citrus on the best ever white fish.  Even the leftover was good for lunch.
