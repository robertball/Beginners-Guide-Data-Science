Wow, this is really good. I did everything as written in the recipe with one change. After the soup simmered for 45 minutes, I took half out and blended it until smooth, added it back to the soup pot and simmered for another 10 minutes. This just helps to get more mushroom flavor in to the soup, while still keeping chunks of mushrooms. It also helps to thicken the soup a little, which is a little thin for cream of mushroom. The recipe is 5 stars even without those changes, I was just in the mood for a stronger mushroom flavor.

Made it for an instant pot smothered pork steaks recipe.  Whoops, forgot to add the chicken broth!  Thankfully, if your're using in a recipe that calls for condensed use this instead.  Low carb and turns out great.  Anything with mushrooms, cream, and cream cheese is going to rock your recipe!!  Steaks turned out great.  Going to try the same exact thing with Worcestershire sauce and sugar free ketchup on the cheapest cut of beef I can get my hands on and make stroganoff style steak...

Deeee-lish!  This fit perfectly into my keto lifestyle and was super tasty too!  I cut the recipe in half and also used fresh thyme. I also didn't need to cook the full 45 mins. 
The only change I would suggest is adding more mushrooms - personal preference. I will be making this one often!

This was the best cream of mushroom soup I have ever had, low carb or otherwise. I looked at several recipes, and this one made the most sense for the purpose I had in mind, which was to curb my sudden craving for my Grandmother's smothered pork chops. Talk about heaven. This HFLC version was even better than what she used to dish up; of course she always used that canned stuff my generation grew up on. NEVER AGAIN! As far as changes, I halved the amount of butter, and substituted it for bacon fat, and left out the sherry.

This soup was outstanding. It was easy to prepare, creamy and rich in flavor.  I couldn't stop tasting it and probably ate half a bowl just by dipping a spoon in as it was cooling.  

I followed the directions to a T.  The only "change" I made was to stir frequently rather than constantly during the simmer phase.  Stirring constantly for 45 minutes would have made this a nightmare to prepare, but stirring 4-5 times was fine.  It was clear that the stirring was important though for breaking the cream cheese down.

Yum! My family has this weird meatballs and rice thing that they love, but I just started keto and canned CoM soup has too many carbs, so I tried it this way and cooked up some cauliflower rice. It was a hit and nobody missed the carbs.

Fantastic!  Used a variety of mushrooms; button,  shiitake, baby Bella.  I did add more butter as the mushrooms soaked it up.  Tip for smooth texture - when mushroom mix is done, add in cream cheese to warm and mix well, then add remaining ingredients.  Also used an immersion blender and pulsed about 1/2 of the mix.  A staple now for my keto life!

Excellent recipe as written.  
I also used it as a substitute for condensed cream of mushroom soup by eliminating the chicken broth.  
One recipe equals 2 cans of condensed soup.  I freeze in 2 portions and I use in casseroles.  Exceptionally more flavorful and healthful than the canned version.

I made this primarily to use in place of canned mushroom soup for my green bean casseroles. I’m excited for the way it looks and tastes in the pan and am looking forward to using it my casserole dishes.

I made this to use for a mushroom gravy base and ended up eating as soup!  So good.  I will never buy canned cream of mushroom soup again!  P.S. I made again and used as my mushroom gravy base to cook with pork chops in my Instant Pot.  It was fantastic!

I loved the flavor, texture, and how easy it was to make this. My cream cheese didn't completely dissolve and there were a few small clumps in the soup, it didn't spoil the soup at all. I will be more careful next time I make this , and there will be a next time.

I used half and half instead of heavy whipping cream and beef broth instead of chicken broth. Also omitted the Sherry (because I didn’t have any)

I made this just about an hour ago. It is very good as is but... next time I will either add double the amount of mushrooms or add diced chicken! It was great! Thanks so much for the recipe!

Amazing! So delicious.  I added a little more garlic and roasted a couple of cloves in advance and then for thickening, after 25 mins of cooking, it was still fairly watery, so I added a tbsp of psyllium husk. Turned out thick and perfect!!!

We really enjoyed this soup. It wasn't quite thick enough for me but I'm wondering if I didn't cook enough water or of the mushrooms first.

We loved this soup. Listening to others I added more mushrooms (24 ounces) and I removed some soup towards the end of simmering and using my hand held emulsifier I blended about a third of the soup in order to thicken it and it does add a lot more mushroom flavor. I poured the blended soup back in for about 15-20 minutes of the final simmering. I happened to have fresh Thyme so I used 1/2 tsp. 
I have already made this twice. The first time I chose this recipe is because my sister is doing Keto Diet and I was making it to share with her. The second time I made it was just for me and my husband because it was so yummy.
I will make it again and again. :)

This is super tasty. I’ve made it twice in the instant pot. I love mushrooms so probably added a couple extra cups of it. I found it not thick enough so the second time, I added almost a tsp of xanthan gum but didn’t like the texture although it did thicken up. Next time I will just blend a cup or two at the end or add less xanthan gum to thicken. Thanks for the recipe.

I loved the flavor of this mushroom soup.....I made exactly as written, with one exception, I added more mushrooms.  My thoughts are to omit the chicken stock, so as to make it like a condensed mushroom soup for recipes that call for it, and add a little chicken base for flavor....excellent  soup

This is so yummy! I added more garlic then the recipe calls for because there can never be too much garlic, and I would do the mushrooms a little finer, but that's all personal taste.

Great alternative to the carb-heavy canned variety!  I needed it for a recipe that called for condensed soup so rather than adding the chicken broth I just added chicken bouillon to add flavor without thinning it out.  I was also out of cream cheese so I thickened the cream mixture with a little arrowroot starch.

I hate changing a recipe when I make it the first time, I feel the original deserves a fair shake.   That said, I used mushroom broth in place of chicken, and sautéed my veggies in olive oil instead of butter because that is what I had to work with.  It was delicious!  Great rich hot soup for a cold day.  I will be making again, this time as written.  Thanks for posting.

I made this soup-really delicious. I added about 1 more C mushrooms since I had them on hand, and I also blended about half to help it thicken a bit too.  I will definitely make this again!

I didn’t have thyme, so I used basil.  I used a full eight ounces of cream cheese and substituted one half cup of white wine for the sherry.

Really good with a couple tweaks. Used one cup less broth, 1 more cup of mushrooms and a cup of diced ham.

Made this tonight & delicious!  I used combination of portabello, white, shiitake & chanterelle mushrooms. I omitted sherry, personal preference.  Very easy and quick to make.  I’m sure it would be wonderful with just white or just cremini mushrooms, or whatever.  I was skeptical of using cream cheese in it but happy I did.  This recipe is s keeper!!

Used my homemade bone broth and mixed approx 3/4 tsp  gluten free xanthum gum for thickening in with broth in ninja first to get rid of clumps.  Also cooked sliced mushrooms and onions in an olive oil/butter combo, then poured broth it made in a bowl and reserved. Added a little more butter and got the bottom of  pan nice and brown for more flavor.  Mushroom andonions too. If you do that, don't add garlic at first or it will burn and turn bitter. Add it after you pour the broth out. I used garlic powder. Added broth back in with bone broth.  Used fresh thyme.  The flavor combo is delicious.  will definitely make again!

Used 6 cups of mushrooms, added some can starch in the last 10 minutes of the simmer, to thicken it up

I used mushroom broth instead of chicken, and added a teaspoon of “better than bouillon” chicken. I used 1/2 button & 1/2 crimani mushrooms.  I had a problem blending in the cream cheese - next time I will make a slurry, and then add it back to the soup. I like the idea of blending part of the soup - would make it a bit thicker. We added a container of oysters to the leftover soup - equally yummy - will make it again!

Great recipe I followed pretty much to a T. I added cooked rotisserie chicken halfway through the summer stage. I'm sharing this with a keto group I belong to.

I made this and we LOVED it.    I only used half of the chicken broth and right before I served it I took 1/3 of the soup and put it in my blender.  Adding it back helped to make the soup a little thicker.     Next time I am going to add more mushrooms.

Absolutely delicious!  I will definitely make it again.  The only change I made was to add a little very low carb flour mix to thicken it up a tad more.

This is amazing.  I did have clumps of cream cheese so wished I would have whisked that up.  I didn't add the salt because typically things are too salty but this definitely needs it.  I'd add more mushrooms next time for sure.  If you're doing a Keto diet, this should be part of your meal rotation.

The flavor of this recipe is wonderful as is. I did add 1/2 cup quinoa to kind of thicken it and give it a little more substance. I will definitely make it again!
