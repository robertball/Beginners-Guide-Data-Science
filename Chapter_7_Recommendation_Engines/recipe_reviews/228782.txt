This is the only recipe that my family has ever used, and it's the only one I use and will continue to use...This makes the creamiest, most delicious fudge that you will ever eat, and it's simple to make too! Sometimes I will use white choco. chips and add nuts, cherries, etc.... or white chips w/ maple flavoring and walnuts. I have done so many different flavor combinations w/ this recipe, and it always turns out fantastic~YUM! :) NOTE: If you happen to have a candy thermometer handy, you will want to bring the mixture to 234 degrees, then continue w/ the recipe. I find that I have better luck using a thermometer than just timing it.

The original recipe says to boil the sugar mixture until the temperature reaches 234°F on a candy thermometer.  I've made this every year for the last 15 years or so.  Trust me, 5 minutes of boiling WILL NOT bring the mixture to 234°.  It takes at least twice that long, maybe longer.  Here is the actual original recipe.  http://www.kraftrecipes.com/recipes/fantasy-fudge-51833.aspx

I have made this recipe for decades now and it's just as good now as it was then! This is THE best fudge recipe. Use butter for sure, it lends so much better flavor than margarine. I have never used marshmallow creme though, just a bag of good old miniature marshmallows, 10 ounces is fine or the bigger bag of 16 ounces is okay too. They melt in just fine along with the chocolate chips. That way, you can just keep marshmallows and chocolate chips on hand, they're good for many other things, and then you're ready to make this on the spur of the moment. If you want, you can stir the miniature marshmallows in not quite completely in, and you have a rocky-road fudge. Also, I toast 2 cups or more of walnut or pecan halves in the oven (about 350 degrees, maybe 10 minutes?) till they are fragrant and slightly colored. The toasted nuts taste fantastic in this fudge, and there's no need to chop them at all!

I used butter instead of margerine, chopped pecans instead of walnuts and pure vanilla extract. We LOVE this fudge. Out of the whole pan that I sliced, only four pieces remain. Very simple fudge recipe with excellent results--it really tastes like something you'd buy from a specialty shop!

This is the best recipe for fudge. But, for 20 years I've been making it in the microwave. I cook it on High for 11 minutes, stirring after 3 minutes, then 6 minutes, then 9 minutes. Take it out 2 minutes later and add your chocolate, fluff, and vanilla! Perfect every time. Substitute the chocolate with 1 cup peanut butter for the creamiest peanut butter fudge going!!!

This is the BEST without a doubt.  Have made this particular recipe many times.  To Chris who had fudge that didn't set up.  If you want to try this again, buy a candy thermometer and cook until it's 234 degrees, then remove from the stove and add, marshmallow, choc. chips, and vanilla.  If it gets not hot enough it will be mushy.  TOO hot and it will crystalize.  To have directions that read EX number of minutes on the stove just doesn't quite do it. Some people have electric stoves, others gas burners.  Best to use a thermometer and not run the risk of wasting all your ingredients.  I, myself, learned this the hard way.

I've been making this for 30+ years, and I've never had it not set up.  I've done both the microwave and the stove top versions.  I made some today on the stove top.  I used a large pot, more like a dutch oven than a saucepan.   Always get it to a full, rolling boil before starting your timer (a rolling boil being one that boils vigorously even when you're stirring).  Give it the full five minutes.  I've never used a thermometer.   I like to pour it into two 9 inch pie pans when I'm giving it away as gifts.

I have read where a reviewer says this is not the original recipe - then they give a link to the "original" they think it is... but sorry that link takes to me what is similar to what is NOW on the fluff jar using the baking chocolate. The recipe here sounds much more like I remember from my umpteen years of this recipe. Thanks so much for posting this recipe! I was so sad when they changed it! It just isn't the same!

I have used this recipe for years and it's amazing! My friends and family always ask for it around the holidays. It's really easy to make and it's funny because people have actually paid me to make this for them, even though it's the recipe that's on the jar of the marshmallow cream. They think this is a secret recipe that I have!  I've used all different kinds of chocolate chips and it's always perfect! Peanut butter and milk chocolate is my favorite. I've added Mint flavoring to make mint chocolate fudge...delicious!

I love this fudge....the traditional method from the back of the Kraft Marshmallow jar is combine sugar, margarine and milk in heavy 2-1/2 quart saucepan; bring to full rolling boil, stirring constantly.  Continue boiling for 5 minutes over medium heat, stirring.  Remove from heat, stir in chocolate till melted.  Add marshmallow creme, nuts & vanilla beat till blended.  Pour into greased 13x9 inch baking pan. Cool at room temp.;; cut into small squares.  Also I use a table sppon of vanilla.

Thank you for posting this original recipe for Fantasy Fudge. My husband and I have been making this at the holidays for 26 years. It's the creamiest, most delicious fudge and a favorite holiday tradition for us and family we share it with. It's great to have 2 people in the kitchen to share stirring duty! We use real butter and vanilla and a candy thermometer to 234 degrees. It's spot on 5 minutes from the time it comes to a full boil. We grease a small spatula with butter to make it easier to get the marshmallow cream from the jar and have each batch's ingredients at the ready to make pound after pound with and without pecans. We let the pans sit open to cool. When the shine fades it's time to cut, layer with wax paper and pack in festive tins and ship. We're trying a couple of batches with the flavor ideas I read here this year. Thanks, again.

IMHO a couple tweaks are needed to the official Fantasy Fudge recipe: I use only 1 stick (1/2 cup) real butter instead of margerine; I bring the evaporated milk, sugar and butter to a full boil and also to almost hard ball stage, then remove from heat and stir in chips, marshmallow creme and vanilla. I blend it well, then return it to the heat and bring it to hard ball stage again stirring well. Remove from heat, stir in nuts and pour in the pan. If desired, add a sprinkling of nuts over the top. Place pan in the refrigerator until set. I find that cooking it up to a higher temp helps it set better without having to be kept chilled to avoid softness this type of fudge is known for.

this is the best fudge recipe around.  I have been making it for years and my family begs for it during the holidays.  I lost the original recipe in Katrina but luckily it was committed to memory.  I just need to look at a jar of marshmallow creme to jog the butterflies in my head.

This is the recipe that I used to make with my dad years ago. It  is the best tasting fudge there is, in my opinion. However,  it seems to be a lttle dry. When I cut it, it crumbles a bit. Any suggestions on what  I can do to make it creamier?

I have been making this Kraft Fantasy Fudge for decades now.  I make it for friends and family in lieu of other kinds of Christmas cookies.  I also call this "No Fail Fudge". Forget about the candy thermometers. If you bring the butter, sugar, evaporated milk mixture to a rolling boil and THEN turn your timer to 5 minutes, it will be cooked to the right level.  I also ALWAYS use the original brands called for by the original recipe:  Parkay margarine, Kraft Marshmallow Creme, Nestle Chips,Carnation Evaporated Milk. My BIG no-so-secret addition to this fudge is that I add a cup of raisins to each batch. (If I double the recipe, and I usually do, that would be 2 cups.) I add the raisins last. EVERYone loves this!Trust me. People will rave about the raisins. My 28 year old son has been experimenting for the last few Christmas seasons by adding other things to the fudge. He has added a layer of dulce du leche in between two layers of fudge, or peanut butter. Last week he added a layer of creme de menthe flavor.  I am not going to mess with success.I like the original!

I have used this recipe for years.  Believe it or not, I make 30 lbs of fudge each Christmas.  Friends and family wait to receive it in the mail.  This base recipe can be varied for a myriad of flavors.  I make chocolate covered cherry by adding chopped, dried cherries to the mix.  I add pistachios to dark chocolate/mint chips.  I even make a version with Bailey's Irish Creme.  Grand Marnier with almonds is also very good.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but it didn't firm up enough.  It tastes great, but after spending overnight in the fridge it's still very soft.  Oh, well!  I guess we'll eat it with a spoon!

I have been making this fudge for over 40 years with butter. On a gas stove, the trick is to let the mixture melt slowly until it comes to a "rolling boil" which is a boil you can't stir down. I start my 5 minute timer and continue to stir constantly until the timer goes off and then immediately remove it from the stove at 5 minutes. Then I add chocolate chips, vanilla, and marshmallow cream.  You have to stir these items in quickly so the fudge retains some gloss to look great on top. You can also take a teaspoon and using the back of it, gently tamp down the fudge which makes it a little more  glossy. If you overcook the fudge, or cook it on heat that is too high, it will be gritty. I use a medium flame.

I pour this directly into a foil lined small (VCR tape sized) priority flat rate mail box, fold the foil over and put the christmas card on top and mail it as a gift -it's been a big hit every time!  But I'm wondering if I can substitute marshmallows for marshmallow creme?  And if doubling it is okay?  thanks for any help!

I've made this fudge for over 40 years.  Only at Christmas.  I've  never used a thermometer but let the mixture come to a "full rolling boil."  Only after that, do I start the timer for five minutes.  Sometimes, I boil for six or seven minutes just to be on the safe side.  I've made it with both margarine and butter and both pecans and walnuts.  Have never made a recipe that wasn't delicious!

This is the original recipe and not to be confused with the one using Jet Puffed marshmallow cream.  There is a big, big difference.  I made the mistake of getting the Jet Puffed this time and it made a batch of fudge that ended up being thrown out.  It is just not the same as this original recipe.  Dont' waste your time on the "new" recipe.  It is simply sweet chocolate candy not even close to the fudge we all love!

We've been making and enjoying this fudge for more years than I can count. We use fresh Texas pecans in this fudge. You can use butter instead of margarine if you prefer. This truly is foolproof fudge!

this is a very easy, forgiving recipe.  i didn't have but about a third of a cup of semi sweet chips, so i added the rest of a container of coco, about a quarter of a cup to the sugar and half a bag of milk chocolate chips.  and i always add around 2 tablespoons of light karo syrup (which helps keep the fudge from crystallizing), and cut the marshmallow cream by about a third or more.  i did use a candy thermometer, and it took a couple more minutes more to come up to 234 degrees.  the rest of the recipe went pretty much according to the recipe.  i do like a deeper chocolate flavor to my fudge, so i usually use the darker chocolate when i have it on hand.  but that's the good part of this fudge.  you can twist and tweak with the flavors and most always turns out great.

Love this recipe as is! I used pecans instead of walnuts just out of preference. The only thing I noticed in the directions, there was no mention of reaching the soft ball stage.  This may cause problems with it 'setting up' for newer cooks, but a candy thermometer will fix that.  Thanks for sharing!

LOVE this recipe! I made 2 batches of it this holiday. I omitted the nuts, added some peppermint oil and some crushed peppermint on top and it was really good. Everyone loved it!

I have been looking for this recipe for awhile.  It IS the original Fantasy Fudge recipe.   The only change I made was to use real butter.  Also, make sure you use a VERY heavy pan to prevent burning.

I have used this amazing recipe for years.  I also make another version of it for my mom, since she  can't have the original chocolate. I call it Cherries, Pecan and Cream Fudge. I substitute white chocolate chips. I use buttered pecans by  saute'ing  and lightly toasting  1 cup of pecans in 2  Tb. of butter. Lastly, I add a cup of diced( squeezed and patted dry) maraschino cherries.

As is this is just ok....I can't deal with that much sugar. The marshmallow fluff is intensely sweet as are chocolate chips. I modify it to use butter instead of margarine, dark chocolate chips (usually Ghiardelli) and 1 1/2 cups of sugar. It does not affect the texture or its ability to set up properly. Everyone who has eaten it the way I make it rave about it and say they can't normally stand to eat fudge because it's overwhelmingly sweet.

I have used this recipe for at least 50 years, and it has always been wonderful.  However, I use butter instead of margarine (the original recipe was on the Kraft marshmallow creme jar, so of course it would call for their products) and roasted pecans instead of walnuts. My main advice is to have ALL your ingredients ready before you begin, because once the milk mixture starts boiling you have to work fast.

I have been making this for 25 years. It is not only simple and delicious, but it's one of the few candy recipes that you can make without a candy thermometer. I usually boil it for slightly longer than five minutes. I have never altered the recipe but can see from the other reviews how easy it would be to use peppermint extract or even toss in some white chocolate chips. You could divide it into two or three bowls, mix in your different ingredients, and have a variety box for gift giving without make several different batches. Thanks for the ideas!

This is THE recipe for fudge.  Have requests for it every Christmas.  It is so easy but seems to taste better when someone else makes it. I have found that the biggest mistake you can make is "not" cooking it for 5 minutes at a rolling boil.  Start timing it when it starts rolling around the edges.  Yum.

I have tried other recipes, and none are as easy, or as delicious as this one! This is "no fail" fudge. Just start timer for 5 minutes when it starts to boil, stirring constantly, take off the heat and stir in chocolate chips, marshmallow creme, vanilla and nuts. Voilà, perfect fudge, WITHOUT a candy thermometer!

I have, many times, made the No Fail Fudge on the back of the marshmallow Fluff jar. It always turned out great. That was long ago, and there are so many new fudge recipes on line now that when choosing one, this one caught my eye because it had similar ingredients. Since. The picture had no visible nuts and my granddaughters don't care for them, so I wanted to leave them out. I read reviews: use a candy thermometer, which I did, to 234 degrees, which I did. One review said the cooled fudge didn't stick because of so much butter. As I brought the sugar, butter, and evaporated milk to the temperature suggested (soft ball stage) I noticed small bits of brown in it. After removing it from the heat to stir in and melt the fluff and chocolate chips, it seemed dry, so hoped adding the vanilla would smooth the texture. I had to quickly chop walnuts and add them to cover the strange texture. It nearly slid out of the pot into the (more butter) prepared pan. Then I read the back of the fluff jar. 1/4 cup butter, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt (definitely a flavor enhancer). Why three times the butter? No salt I get. My advice...use the original recipe from the Fluff jar.

If you can weigh out your chocolate chips. Makes the whole product more consistent. Use real butter and this may sound weird but butter the sides of the pot you use to boil the sugar mixture. It helps with the crystalization issue some people have. Use a buttered candy thermometer or test the soft ball stage in a cup of cold water. (Drop some of the mixture in water and when you squish the mixture with your hand (out of the water) it should be a soft taffy like consistency).   This is the best fudge I have ever had. And it is the one we make 3 batches of every year.

if you like a more firm fudge, cook the marshmallow creme with the sugar mixture. It has the same great taste, my grandmother made it that way for years.

Best thing I ever invested in was a candy thermometer. This is my go-to recipe for fudge, with tons of variations. But it is better if you use the thermometer, because it's so difficult to judge EXACTLY when that full boil starts!

I haven't made this in quite some time. While in the market and without my glasses I flipped over the name brand jar of marshmallow fluff and ask my husband to please read the ingredients to me. I ask him to repeat himself several times as I didn't think I was hearing him correctly when he was reading the chocolate ingredients. I couldn't understand what he was saying to me and I couldn't look for myself. I just grabbed a bag of semi sweet chocolate pieces knowing that was what I had used in the past. Then I read the recipe later WITH my glasses only to see it calls for a 9" square pan. I always used a 9x13 so that threw me off. How much chips was I suppose to use? Half the bag or the whole thing? Yikes! All of this leading me here and prompting me to write this big heart felt thank you! This is the best fudge recipe ever. Why fix or change something that was never broken in the first place? Thanks for posting this ?

My Dad always made this fudge, and I have continued the tradition. It has always been a hit. Only thing we change from this recipe is that we use milk chocolates and pecans. The semi-sweet always left a bitter taste in my opinion.

I made a batch of chocolate peanut butter fudge by another recipe for my godson. That recipe was chocolate chips and sweetened condensed milk made in the microwave.  My first batch was so good that my immediate family wanted some for themselves, but I didn't have any more sweetened condensed milk, so I found this recipe with fluff.  I chose to make it in the microwave and followed the instructions exactly, except I cut the recipe in half.  After boiling the sugar, butter and milk for the entire time (stirring every 1-2 minutes) I immediately added the chocolate chips, but it immediately became gritty and extremely dry.  It had all crystallized. It was a disaster!  I will stick with my easy recipe in the microwave. It comes out perfect every time.

I used a candy thermometer for the first time as the recipe on the jar of marshmallow fluff suggests. Took the boiling sugar, butter and evaporated milk off the stove exactly when it reached 234 degrees. If I had left it boiling for 5 minutes, it would have overcooked, which means grainy fudge. In conclusion, this recipe with a candy thermometer at 234 degrees rates 5 stars.

Made this for years.  Never had a problem with it setting up or being too soft but I've made candy for years so I guess I just know when it looks right.

I use white chocolate chips and instead of putting walnuts into it, put crushed candy canes into it.  Best Holiday fudge EVER.  My family won't let me go a Holiday now without making my Candy Cane Fudge.  Same recipe, just white chocolate chips and candy canes, not walnuts.  Oh, and Peppermint Extract, not vanilla!

I used the recipend, but doubled it. I also substituted 5 of the 6 cups of sugar with Splenda. You need to use one cup of sugar in order to have the correct texture.  Using all Splenda changes the texture, though it still tastes good. It also keeps it from being overly rich.

I remember this fudge from my childhood, the 70's. I went against my better judgment and did what the person from the most helpful critical comment said. We boiled it until it said 234 as opposed to boiling for 5 minutes. I will go back to boiling for only 5 minutes. The temperature  stated in her comment was way to dry at the end.  I am letting it cool now and hope it will be edible.

This has been my favorite fudge recipe since it came out when I was a teenager. Now, the only thing I have added is just a dash of salt to enhance the chocolate. Chocolatier Jacques Torres recommends just a dash of salt to enhance the chocolate and it does enhance it.

Enjoy, this is the creamiest, smoothest fudge ever and so easy to make.

OMG this is sooo good.  I made a different version first and it failed.  So I looked and found this recipe and its perfect.  I added crushed pretzels on the bottom before I poured it into the pan.  Gives it the sweet and salty taste.  Everyone raved about it.  I only made 1 batch, next year I will make a couple.

This IS the original!  Just make sure that you have ALL the ingredients measured and ready to stir in immediately once the sugar, butter and milk are done cooking!  No time to waste as the mixture cools!

Great. Amazing recipe and so happy that I could use the chocolate chips instead of having to cut blocks of chocolate like my Grandmother used to do. I did add one more minute to the boil to ensure that the sugar was melted.

Too sweet. I reduced the sugar to 2 1/2 cups and I still found it too sweet to eat.  I split my batch into two so I could make two flavor combinations:  maple pecan (with Ghiradelli white chips) and chocolate walnut (Ghiradelli semi-sweet chips), and I also used real butter.  The maple pecan set up beautifully and smooth, and I used a little maple syrup for flavor (which is why I omitted some sugar).  The semi-sweet one had a layer of grease pool at the top, which I had to dab off, and although it set, was grittier.

My husband's family grew up on hard/grainy fudge, which they make every year.  I've never been a fan of fudge, especially grainy fudge, so never partake in their yearly tradition.  This year, we had an extra jar of marshmellow creme, so I said I was going to try their recipe.  I found this version, which uses chips instead of baking squares.  Yum!  It came out smooth and creamy, no graininess at all.  Thanks!

I've also used this recipe for many years; however, I use the Baker's semi-sweet chocolate that I chop up. I have learned in recent years and wanted to share- for stove top method, don't use the newer/expensive/heavy anodized metal pans. Thinner/cheaper pot does best for me. I think the thicker metal doesn't let it cool down quickly enough and was causing the fat to separate and ultimately was grainy. Luckily, I'd used the recipe for so long already before using my new pot, I was able to figure out the problem after 2 batches that did the same thing. I then grabbed my old, cheap Wear Ever 6 quart Dutch Over pot and was back in business!  I also agree on the candy thermometer. Clip it on the edge of your pot-you'll be glad you did.

For those having a problem with this setting up right, you probably need to test your thermometer.  Altitude does make a difference, but not a problem if you test thermometer.  Dip the end of thermometer in boiling water, then add 22 degrees to that number and it will be perfect.  For example when I make jelly, in my area the water boils at 211 degrees, so I add 8 to that number for perfect jelly.  It is always a good idea to test a thermometer in any cooking.  The thermometer may not be precisely calibrated.  Hope this helps.

This is the only recipe I use and I've used it for many years. I prefer butter over margarine. IT NEVER FAILS, unless maybe you try to make it when it's raining. :) The secrets are to keep the heat on the lower end of med-high, stir CONSTANTLY, and use a candy thermometer to cook to 234 degrees.  Variations:  use white chips in lieu of chocolate ones for vanilla fudge, and for peppermint fudge use white chips with 2 tsp peppermint extract instead of 1 tsp vanilla, adding a couple drops of green food coloring for effect.

I have made this exact recipe for decades.  It always comes out perfect if I always do two things: 1.  Only use margarine.  2.  Start timing your 5 minutes as soon as it just starts to boil, and only go 4-4 1/2 minutes, not five.  it is always creamy, never dry and crumbly, but it is if i go 5 minutes or if I use butter, then it is just awful...

I've made this fudge for more than 40 years! We have it for all holidays, and have given it to family and friends as gifts.  Several years ago I wrote the recipe down, thinking I'd include it in with the fudge. Boy was I happy when those darn 13oz jars came out.  Rather than trying to get the correct amount of the marshmallow out of the jar, I went to the mini marshmallows. When ever someone says this is the recipe on the jar, I say "No, it's an old recipe I've had for years"!!

I made according to the recipe posted. The taste is the same, however, it is a crumbly mess. While it may be THE original recipe, you need to cook it longer than 5 minutes in order for it to have the correct consistency and I should remember every time I make a recipe from here to read the reviews prior to actually making it.

Well I gave it 4 stars because its in the set up stage.  But as far as taste my boyfriend thinks its perfect! I did what other reviews said to do and let it boil for 7 minutes instead of 5.  Thats what my peanut butter fudge says to do too, so I think it will be just fine.  Thanks for this recipe, been looking and trying alot of different ones for a couple years ,and now I think I have found a keeper!

You have to make sure you cook this the full time or it doesn't set up as well.This doesn't have a strong chocolate fudge taste to it, and I like my fudge to have more of a rich chocolate taste.It's a good milk chocolate tasting fudge though.I would defiantly use butter than margarine. I just found the original Fantasy Fudge recipe and its not the same as this but close.

I have made this recipe many times and it's very good. I have changed to half semi sweet and half milk chocolate chips in recent years and I think it makes it even better

Just like mom made every year for Christmas. My only suggestion to make it spot on perfect is to use an entire 12oz can of evaporated milk and double all remaining ingredients.
2/3 cup is apparently just shy of 6oz and my first single batch had a little bit of a texture. The second batch was double with a full 12oz can and the texture was replaced with nothin but creamy goodness. Really curious to try it with other chip flavors. Pretty sure butterscotch fudge may be the death of me. Lol

I am the only person on the planet who can’t get this SIMPLE recipe correct! Clearly I am doing something wrong.  It comes out grainy.  This time not as bad as usual, but still grainy.  And now, the butter is SEPARATING!!  What did I do wrong??? I used a candy thermometer.  234 degrees in about 2-3 minutes. OMG help!!

This recipe is really bad. We have made 3 separate batches and none of them have tasted good. Not sure why we keep trying it but I think we hoped it would be better every year. The ingredients are not cheap. Not recommended.

This is not the fudge I remember as a child.  I followed the instructions and used a candy thermometer.  It was easy to make but it didn’t set up like fudge should. I think it needs less sugar and more chocolate.

I made no changes.  It came out perfect.  Very smooth fudge.  I did line the 9x13 pan with Reynolds non-stick foil.  Very easy to remove to cut in 1 inch squares.

This is the best fudge I have made for many years!  People actually asked me for this and look forward to it every year!  I usually omit the nuts but is very creamy and very delicious without it!  Pecans are great in it too! For those who think it takes longer to boil to reach the temperature, I think it depends on how thick your frying pan is. Thank you for sharing it!

I think the sugar crystallized. The fudge seems dry.  I followed the 5 minute rolling boil as the recipe called for.  I made this fudge last  year followed the direction on the net puffed recipe  and it turned out perfect just like my mother & I made 35 years ago.
 
Not happy with Jett Puff Marshmallow cream.

Delicious! My mom has used this recipe forever. I finally tried it and loved it! I teach about 68 high school kids how to cook/bake and we tried this recipe with peanut butter, butterscotch, white chocolate, and semisweet chocolate chips (the bag sizes vary by a couple of ounces here and there, but I haven’t encountered any problems with that yet) and all were delicious! The kids were so pleased with themselves and many kept the recipe to make it again at home! I will definitely get a lot of use out of this recipe!

I made the recipe and it came out great.  I agree with the other reviewers that 5 minute boil is not long enough. I used my candy thermometer and it's more like 8-10 minutes for the boil - if you want a nice creamy fudge. 
Thanks for posting the recipe. It's a keeper.

I made this twice. Once following the exact recipe, way too much buttter. This corresponds to the reviews where the  complaint was oil oozing out on top. I think  that in rewriting someone took 3/4 cube of butter to be 3/4 cup;  it's twice as much. It did not mix or  pour as nicely as I remember from the 1960s. Thickens too much. Remember, chocolate has fat in it.

Second time, I cut the butter to 1 stick, 1/2 cup. Much better, but still too thick and a  bit oily - paper towel blotting helped on both. It did not need refrigeration to set up.

My recollection, and I never wrote it down, was : 6 cups sugar, one stick butter/margarine, one large can condensed milk, package of chips, large jar of marshmallow  creme and 2 cups walnuts. Cook 5 minutes at rolling boil, and then mix chips, marshmallows and walnuts. Mixture was soft enough to pour out and refrigerate, but still set up. 

I've made enough for a small army, but when I do it again, I will use the recipe above.

I noticed the directions call for lots of stirring.  I googled "fudge" and it says not to stir. What's up with that? I stirred, turned out fine. I also do not have a candy thermometer, so my 5 minutes of boiling worked great! Making peanut butter fudge as I type this!

I measured all of the ingredients and cooked the mixture in the microwave as stated in the recipe.  When I added the chocolate chips, the mixture became very dry and thick.  Once I added the marshmallow cream, it was better but still on the dry side.  After getting it into the pan and letting it sit, I tried a piece and it isn't creamy.  It is rather dry and when you eat it, it crumbles in your mouth.  I believe the wattage of the microwave makes a difference and the recipe may need to be adjusted for higher wattage microwaves so it doesn't cooks so long.

If I use the traditional, original recipe it always turns out perfect! Been making this for years! It’s a thanksgiving and Christmas tradition for my husband’s family!

This was the first time I made fudge and it turned out great! The next time I think I will try using peanutbutter chips instead of chocolate or maybe even the chocolate mint chips.

Delicious! Like you would get at Disneyland. Used 10 oz bag of mini marshmallows instead of marshmallow cream. Used butter instead of margerine. Poured into a foil lined 13x9, cooled then cut. Heavenly!

Thanks for including the microwave instructions. 
Was good as I remembered. 
Had lost my recipe for this in a move and was glad to find it. The microwave directions were great and made it so easy.

I've made this recipe since I was a 22 year old new wife.  It is truly yummy and is a bit with everyone.  I would suggest lining the 13X9 with foil or parchment paper.  Once fudge is set,  flip it over onto a cutting board a cut into desired-sized bites.
You can also use almonds or pecans, if desired, as well as peanut butter chips, adding after marshmallow and prior to adding vanilla extract.  Do a "quick" blend (the mixture should appear as a swirl prior to folding into your 13X9.  (Same goes for white choc. chips, dark choc., etc.  Bon appetite!

Made exactly per recipe, just like Mom and I did when I was a teen! I do prefer to cook it on the stovetop better than the microwave. I also do use a candy thermometer like the original recipe says you should do. So I get it up to 234-degrees. Also, when Mom and I made it years ago we used an electric mixer to mix in and help get the melted chips mixed well and quickly into with the butter-milk-sugar mix. We continued beating it to mix in the marshmallow creme, too. It makes the batch very consistent. It’s not required but easier than beating it by hand. I also avoid pushing any sugar crystals stuck to the side of the pan into the fudge. If you scrape them all in, you’ll end up with hard bits in some of the pieces.

Buying a candy thermometer was one of the best investments I made.  I didn’t purchase it to make fudge, but it made this recipe easier than my previous times.  This is a great recipe!  But great fudge has to get to the softball stage.  This takes longer than 5 minutes. I’ve made this recipe dozens of times. Trust me.

Best Fudge ever and so easy to make.  I like the microwave version the best.  I use Ghirardelli dark chocolate chips. Also used butter instead of margarine.  Note make sure you time a good five minutes after mixture has come to a rolling boil, you may not get good results if you don't do this.

I followed recipe exactly.  A few people in my family liked this.  I did not.  Boiled for 5 mins - got to 184 degrees- still thought it wasn't as smooth as the sweetened condensed milk versions, and I found it too sweet for my personal preferences.

Awesome...and worked!! I brought it to 234 degrees on a candy thermometer. I didn't even let it come down in temperature (as so many people say to do) before I added the remaining ingredients and it turned out perfectly! Walnuts were great in it too. Thank you!

I've been making fudge from this recipe since it first appeared on the jars of marshmallow cream, and I just love it!  I have it committed to memory and always make a double batch.  I looked up the recipe this time, because it's time to pass the torch.  My granddaughter asked for the recipe, and I couldn't remember the measurement of evaporated milk for a single batch, since the double batch takes the full can.  This is such a good recipe that even if you mess it up a bit, it still tastes delicious.  I use it with peanut butter chips, also.  And, over the years I developed a way to make coffee fudge using this same recipe.

Thank you so much for sharing this! This is the recipe my grandma always used and since they've changed it on the packaging I haven't had any success at making a good fudge. My Grandma just passed away in October and I am so excited to have found this original and I just made it and it came out amazing! Again, thank you!

Easy to make and always a winner. I use small can of evaporated milk - no measuring needed. I also heat sugar, butter & evaporated to boiling. Then constantly stir for four minutes. Comes out firm but creamy.

I will admit it was a stupid mistake that resulted in a happy ending.  Instead of the 3/4 cup of butter or margarine as listed in the recipe, I used a cup and a half of butter  and a large jar of marshmallow cream.  Everything else was just as listed.  Final result: a much creamier fudge that makes a slightly larger result and comes out of the pan a lot easier.

Make sure you boil and stir the sugar/butter/milk mixture for the full 5 minutes, and you can't go wrong.

My father used to make this fudge every year at Christmas.  I always believed that it was "his" secret recipe until I realized it was on the Marshmallow Creme jar.  That was over 50 years ago.  I make it every year.  I have used Peanut Butter chips instead of Chocolate for my one of my sons who isn't that fond of chocolate.  It tastes great!

Made this for the first time today.  I used butter instead of margarine, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  It set up just fine for me, but the chocolate flavor is very week.  I figured it would be when I saw the color as I poured it into the pan to cool.  It’s not bad, just very bland.  If I try this recipe again, I will increase the chocolate chips.

If you want to make it how it is originally done and not as strong then do not use vanilla extract. This is my great grandmothers recipe, she won a contest and that is her recipe!

I make this every year as did my mom and grandmother. To double the batch, except for the sugar, (use three scant cups), use one semi-sweet chocolate chips and one peanut butter for a different taste.

I too have been making this recipe for over 40 years- simple and to rave reviews! I can't believe that it is no longer on the back of the marshmallow jar! A few ideas- do NOT grease the pan; just butter it! Also, I always use butter, not oleo-yuck! But I do use "low fat 2% evaporated milk" and do not notice any difference! Enjoy!

Best fudge ever! I made this for many years on gas stoves. Moving to my house, no gas stove! I tried to make it in the microwave. No good. Tried on glass flat top stove. Took too long. YUCK! Well a friend really wanted me to make it. Glad I did. Still great tasting. Used Kraft Marshmallow Creme. Same recipe on the jar. My friends and I love animals, so I made fun shaped fudge.  Will make this for the holidays again. I used butter. No nuts. Will add crushed cookies and candy next time!

I made the microwave version of this and it turned out excellent. Be careful though, the MICROWAVE directions omit the evaporated milk; I added it 6 minutes into the melt phase - thank goodness it didn't burn. Very small amounts of crystalized sugar, I'm sure this was due to when I introduced the evaporated milk.

Every time I make this I add a small amount of salt or even salt the pecans when I roast them and it helps make it not overly sweet and balances it out.

Didn’t have condensed milk so used half heavy cream and half 2% milk, worked great, also cooked to 240* on my candy thermometer because it never sets up to my liking, nice and firm, if I cook to 234*. Finally got it to “work” for me.

I don't know what went wrong, but his is what happened: It kept scorching, and I had it on low flame. Therefore, I had to stir it constantly. I used a candy therm. because I wasn't sure how long exactly to boil it, but when it neared 234 it stiffened up and became too hot for my heat-proof spatula. I quickly took it off the heat and dumped in the chips, but as I stirred it seemed to separate. Other recipes I used had creamy fudge at this point, but it looked somehow grainy. I quickly put in the marshmello fluff, and I had to muscle through what was becoming very stiff dough. I put in the vanilla, but at this point (a couple minutes into mixing the second set of ingredients) all the oil from the butter was separating out. (I used 1 stick butter and 1/2 stick margarine). I quickly pitched it into my prepared pan, and squished it into the edges. It was floating in oil, so I used several large paper towels to sop up all the oil. So very weird! So how does it taste? It is like eating grainy sugar with melted choc chips in it. I pitched the whole thing.

I have never been so confused about a recipe! I followed the directions exactly, I noticed that my bag of chocolate chips was only 10 ozs so I added 2 more ozs. I stirred the boiling  sugar, margarine, & evaporated milk mixture for exactly 5 minutes. When I tried adding the chocolate chips, I could hardly stir it. It totally hardened up! So I added some more evaporated milk so I could finish the recipe. I managed to get the chocolate & vanilla in it but only about 2/3 of the marshmallow fluff. My thought was that 5 min is too long to cook it but some people have said that it should be cooked for 10 min! It has a good taste but it doesn't look pretty and it kind of slid into the pan. it seems like it should be really easy. Any ideas???

I think next time I will try substituting 1 bag of semi sweet chocolate chips for regular chocolate chips. It  wasn't bad by no means I just think it need to be a little sweeter. The texture was great!

I make it a habit to read the Reviews (and tips) before embarking on a recipe, except I didn't do that this time and really wish I had. Yes, I should have used a thermometer. I melted my sugar, real butter and evaporated milk on a double boiler. Once it melted I stirred for approximately 7 minutes (recipe calls for 5 minutes). Wish I had kept it on the heat longer and used a thermometer. The fudge looks beautiful but even with using superfine sugar t is still grainy. Has anyone ever tried emptying the dish of fudge into a pan and reheating?

I have been making this recipe for years and love it, however, I am trying to cut back on sugar and this recipe calls for much more than needed.  I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar and about 12 oz. semi sweet chocolate chips & it worked out just fine.  Plenty sweet.  Also used lots of walnuts, about 1 1/2 cups.  Delicious!

This is the only fudge recipe my family has ever used. It's delicious, smooth, and easy to make! I love that you can easily experiment with flavors and add ins with this fudge. I get compliments every time I make it, and have family and friends who look forward to this fudge in their Christmas goodie tins. I will never use a different recipe.

Follow the 5 minute boil ! I used that 234 degree tip and immediately the chocolate chips siezed up and it went to heck from there.Only use if you like dried fudge with sugar chips.Had to dump. 2nd batch , where I followed the direction,was creamy and delicious.

Best Fudge Recipe Ever!!!                                                                                                                         This original recipe is one I used when I was active in sorority. It was a great fund raiser because we used this recipe to make solid fudge eggs and personalize them every Easter. Now, I make them for my 8 grandkids and my grown kids. I use butter instead of margarine. I ,also, use a candy thermometer  so the sugar mixture doesn't get too hot. I heat it to the soft ball stage and then remove it from the heat. If it gets too hot, the fudge will be very dry.                                                                                   To make the eggs. I use a 9x13 greased pan. You can get 6-8 eggs out of this size pan depending on the size you want.  I do 6. I hand form the fudge into egg shapes and then freeze overnight on cookie sheets.  The next day I use a skewer inserted into the larger end of the egg and dip it in a paraffin (candy) coating. You can cover the skewer hole easily with a buttercream flower or other decoration.  The coating I use is 1/4 bar of shaved paraffin melted to 1 bag of semi sweet chocolate chips.  After I dip the egg, I place it on wax paper to dry and then I decorate and personalize each one with buttercream frosting. When they are done, I put them in a plastic container (the small ones you bring  leftovers home from a restaurant) with some Easter grass.  An absolute hit every year!

First, I made no changes, zip! Second, the exact same recipe (to the letter) is present on the 16 oz. tub of Marshmallow Fluff save for the tsp. of salt recommended.  That said, I got confused while starting, and having failed twice before with other recipes on this site, I prepared each and every component in advance. I even checked my candy thermometer (which had been faithful all along) and it reads 212 or 100 degrees C when boiling water. So off I went...what could possibly go wrong? :-)

And so, I dumped my butter in the pan all three bars with a can of evaporated milk and three cups of sugar. I realized that I needed only 1.5 bars of butter and so I doubled the other components quickly. Good thing I used a large pot. I brought it to a boil on a level of 5 and then stopped stirring (other recipes told me to do this). then I re read the directions and furiously started stirring. Then I added the marshmallow (spitter spatter) as the temperature kept rising to 234 degrees (five seconds before the five minute timer went off. I added the vanilla and then the chocolate and stirred until mixed but not enough to rid the mix of it's shininess. Last I added the nuts and mixed well. It all went into a 9x11 pan and left on the shelf to cool a bit. By the time I had cleaned up, the top surface was firming up. The leftovers on the sides tasted lovely or even a bit sweet. But finally, finally, a fudge recipe in which I could bask my ego after the third attempt. Yes. Thank you. Sincerel

Absolutely love this fudge.  Tastes just like the old fantasy fudge recipe on back of the marshmallow cream jar.   The only change I made was to cook it till candy thermometer hit 234 degrees which was longer than recommended in recipe.

Awesome fudge recipe!  It is so creamy and rich that  it makes you want to eat it slowly in order to savor it.  I liked it both with the walnuts and without. I cooked at full boil, stirring constantly for exactly 5 minutes and it was perfect.  Best fudge recipe I have come across! Yum!

Revised October 30th 2017 .  I only used two cups of sugar  and accidentally used three sticks of butter  instead of one and a half sticks . I poured the marshmallow cream into a large mixing bowl and let it sit while I boiled the sugar butter milk mixture. I took that mixture out of the pan when it was at about 232 degrees and then stirred in the chocolate. I poured, without scraping the sides of the hot pan, the chocolate mixture on top of the  marshmallow cream and then beat it for about a minute with an electric mixer.  The extra butter did not ruin my fudge and it was still  sweet - almost too Sweet . I can't imagine how sweet three cups of sugar would be in this recipe. Let me start by saying what I made melted in your mouth, was creamy, but held its shape and was not gooey. It tasted better than the expensive fudge shops' fudge.  I read many reviews before I made this.  I changed a few things based on some of those reviews and the changes made the fudge amazing.  I used non stick foil measured to have overhang on the ends in my 9x13 pan.  I used only 2.5 cups of sugar.  I  used butter.  I used 12 oz of Ghirardelli bittersweet dark chocolate chips, 60% cacao.   I buttered the side of my sauce pan all the way up to the top to try and avoid stray sugar crystals. I set my timer for 5 minutes after the butter, milk, and sugar began to boil.  I also used my candy thermometer.  I stirred carefully and did NOT scrape the sides.  After a  6 minute boil on medium gas flame my ba

I followed the recipe exactly as written, following the microwave instructions.  My fudge turned out great.  My only adjustment next time will be to decrease my second cooking time from 5 1/2 minutes to 5, for my particular 1000 -watt microwave it was a tad too much, but the recipe is very forgiving and it really did turn out great.  I just had a little trouble mixing the chocolate chips by hand since the mixture was SO thick, so I quickly turned to my hand mixer and finished it up.  Very good, and I will be making this again!

Yummy, yummy! This recipe is a standard one that I've used before but couldn't find elsewhere. I found another similar one but this one is fabulous. Make sure and cook the full time, not before it boils, after! You won't be disappointed.

I have made this original Fantasy Fudge for many many years and I have to say, to me, this is by far the easiest and the best tasting.  I've tried other fudge recipes. None compare.  I've never used a thermometer and just follow the basic directions and have had very good luck and many compliments.

Always turns out good.  Sometimes it is grainy and through the reviews I learned not to mix it after it boils and that did the trick.  Nice and creamy.

This recipe is a HIT with EVERYONE who tried it!!! 13 out 13 people I've given this to loved it!!! The recipe also works PERFECTLY if you switch the Milk Chocolate with White Chocolate in my experience! (Also used butter instead of Margarine ) Recently I switched the Evaporated Milk with Coconut Milk as an experiment, my mother who HATES Milk Chocolate enjoys it!

Best Fudge Ever! My Grandmother has made this recipe for at least 40 yrs now and now I make it. It's the only fudge my family likes. However I'm confused. I looked up the recipe on the kraft website and it looks,to me, to be the same as this recipe so besides wording the ingredients a little different how is this  different?

Great!  I toasted the pecans and thought it was even better.
The link to the "real recipe" says to boil for 4 minutes - I'm sticking with this one.
Thanks for sharing.

Thanks for posting this original recipe!  I was disappointed to see they had changed it.  I agree with another poster here that the original did say to use a candy thermometer to verify it reaches 234 degrees.  I've always used one, it usually takes an extra 1-2 minutes and this is what makes it set up.  My favorite fudge recipe!

This is the recipe that my grandma has used for years and now I'm making it since she has passed on. If you follow the directions it is delicious creamy and perfect. it only takes a little more than an hour to set up if you sit it at room temperature on the counter. I use butter instead of margarine and it gives it that extra creamy taste. Anyone who says that this recipe does not work is obviously not following the directions or doesn't understand what the term full boil means. I alway boil mine at a full boil for 6 minutes instead of 5 and it turns out perfectly every time, no thermometer needed.

I added a 1/4 teaspoon of kosher salt, and used butter.  It's a quick and easy fudge, and tastes good, but it doesn't quite have the density I usually associate with fudge.

So, so easy and delicious.  My boyfriend made it and he can't cook anything!!  No candy thermometer and we didn't even test it in water.  5 minutes at full boil works perfect.  Made one batch with and one batch without nuts.  They are equally good!!

it is an amazing recipe and I have used it many times. but, the mixture you have to boil in the pan took me WAY longer than it said to take put the fudge doesn't have to go until a full boil little lumps will form and they r bubbles and that is good enough to call a boil. over all this is the best fudge recipe

Thank goodness you'd posted this!  I went to make this on Christmas Eve and thought the recipe would be on the back of the marshmallow cream.   Hadn't made it since they'd changed to chopped Baker's chocolate which , if course, I didn't have.  Thank you, thank you!  Merry Christmas!

THE ONE AND ONLY FUDGE RECIPE! Those who have trouble with it should use a candy thermometer. That is the critical part of making perfect fudge. Timing is just guesswork as every stove and pot used can cause major differences in the outcome.

This is delicious fudge.  I have made this three times this month for sharing.  I used butter instead of margarine.   I did make this fudge years ago, and  I am glad I decided to try it again.  Thank you CAVAMom for sharing this recipe with us.
