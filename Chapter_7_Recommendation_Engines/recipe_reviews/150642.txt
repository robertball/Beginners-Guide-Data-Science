This curd was absolutely delicious!  To make it as a filling for Key Lime Cake, I substituted 1.5 Tbsp of lime juice for lemon juice and to make sure it would hold up as a thick filling, I sprinkled in one tsp. of flour while heating.  Wonderful Recipe!

Really good!  I used it as a topping for some mini-cheesecakes but I think I might make an entire pie out of it!

Very very good!  I've been looking for a lime curd recipe and this one is definitely it!  I love that it is so simple and made with things I already have at home.  Highly recommended!

This was great.  I usually make lemon curd, but had a bowl full of key limes in the house.  I had great success with putting my immersion blender into the eggs in a bowl prior to adding them to the lime juice mixture.  No need to put through a sieve with this technique.  I added one drop of green food color and this was perfection!

This is a great lime curd recipe (and I've tried a few). Many recipes call for egg yolks only, but this was smooth and just creamy enough. A little grated ginger adds a nice twist.

This was absolutely delicious and so easy!  I needed some lime curd to add some pizazz to a key lime cake that I had made.  I slathered in between two key lime cake rounds and then topped the whole thing with a sugary lime glaze.  I love key lime pie and this is the next best thing if you can't have pie!

This was a super easy receipe. The taste was great. The only thing I did was pour thru a strainer after cooking. It gives it a more finished look!

Served this on fresh homemade English muffin toast.  Amazing!! I couldn't believe how easy this was.  I'll never buy lime curd again.  FYI - the natural color of this curd is not green - more a shade of yellow.  Used 1 drop of green food coloring to lean it toward green which was more of an experiment than anything else and really not necessary.

This turned out fantastic!! I recently went to Paris and fell in love with French Macaroons.  I wanted to try making them when I came home.  Since I had a million limes on hand I thought I would try a lime curd as the filling.  The result was a perfect combination of the delicate, sweet French Macaroon with the bright tartness of this lime curd. Perfection!!!

I made this to be a filling inside cupcakes for a cocktail party (Refreshing Limoncello Cake recipe on this site), and it could not have been any better. I did add a touch of green food coloring to it, only to make it stand out against the yellow cake, and it was a perfect tangy surprise as you took the first bite of cupcake. Many compliments and many requests to make it again!

Tastes great alone but outrageously good as a dessert filling. Tripled the recipe; made as written. Used real key limes from Key West, FL rather than larger Persian limes more commonly found in grocery stores. Knowing there was an insufficient number of limes to make 2-1/4 cups of juice, subbed Nellie & Joe's Famous Key West Lime Juice 100% Natural Juice to make up the shortfall {1 lb. (18-20) key limes yield about 3/4 cup juice}. Filled individual graham cracker tartlet shells with lime curd, and garnished with a thin slice of kiwi, a few unsweetened coconut flakes, and a small Amaretti cookie. Sarah, two thumbs up!

This was so great! I used this as a topping for cheesecake and was really impressed with the combination of tart and sweet. Plus, the bright green was great for a splash of color.

Turned out perfect!  Husband about ate the entire bowl ...just dipping bread in it.  I did make it in the microwave.  Heated it on high for 30 second intervals, stirring between each interval.

Delicious!  I had to cook for longer than specified to get a nice thick consistency.  Also, I cooked it a little to hard a first and got a few flecks of cooked egg, but these came out easily with straining.

I've never made a curd before and followed the recipe exactly and found some of the steps are vague. I ended up with little pieces of egg in my curd.  I strained out the pieces and the final product was delicious and flavorful.  For taste and texture (minus the egg pieces)  I'd give it 5 stars but the recipe directions get a 3. My guess is that the mistake that caused my dilemma could be 1. use egg yolks instead of whole eggs  2. temper the eggs more gradually by spooning and mixing more of the heated mixture into the eggs 3. stir the final mix frequently.

I had a bunch of limes so I made lime curd. And MAN was it good! It came out perfectly. The zest specks in the curd wasn't too appealing, but they didn't affect the taste or texture at all. I made a lime meringue pie in a chocolate crust with this curd and it was excellent.

This is a great curd recipe (it makes an excellent sour curd with the perfect sweetness) and there's really no need to modify it but keep in mind, the key limes you use could affect the taste.  I usually only use about 3-4  small limes (and only ripe ones).  I grate about 2 tbs of rind then juice the limes but I mainly use "Nellie and Joe's Famous Key  West Lime" juice from concentrate (in the pale green bottle) to provide the bulk of the lime juice. People seem to think fresh lime juice is automatically better but i disagree (you can always count on Nellie and Joe's juice to taste perfect).  I love the extra kick that the zest gives so i add more than 1 tbs.  Other than that, I follow the directions exactly (i use a glass bowl on a boiling pot of water for my double broiler), cook it the full 20 minutes, cool it about 5 and stick it in the fridge, and you'll have no problems with it being too runny or thin.

I stirred everything together and cooked stove-top for twenty minutes then strained. I reduced butter to 2 tablespoons because I don't like a greasy curd. I used 5 domestic limes to get the 3/4 cup of liquid. Finished product, after straining = 8 oz.

This was REALLY tart, I mean so tart that it had a bite in the back of your throat - and I only used key limes.  I am currently attempting to make it usable by adding in a T more butter, some simple syrup and another egg yolk.

This Curd is FANTASTIC I made it to top a key lime cheesecake I made for a Laborday party. I added a drop of green food dye to bring out the green color just because it was for a party. Temper the eggs SLOW to keep from getting egg bits in it.

Lovely tangy curd.  I love lemon curd and this is a great twist on that!  Not clear in the recipe whether you stir or not after adding the eggs, I did (most of the time....) and it came out silky smooth.  Didn't add any zest though as I didn't have any (threw the lime skins before reading the recipe).

Excellent Curd! I used persian limes as that is what I had.  I used all the zest of 2 large limes, so I had more than a tablespoon of zest-but I really like zest. Putting a little of the lime mixture into the eggs until they were warm but not cooked worked well.  It only took about 8 minutes to cook through and set.  I also made 2 cups total  curd. I sterilized 2 cup size mason jars and had two jars full.  I used this in a lime cheesecake recipe that I made using Knox gelatin.  I made the cheesecake, allowed it to thicken then folded in some of the cold curd.  Poured on to a ginger-oat Scottish shortbread crust (recipe from King Arthur Flour). None of these recipes did I follow exactly, but the curd made the dish!  Thank you.

I made this for margarita cupcakes and it was absolute perfection. I usually modify recipes but I tried this exactly as is and it was spot on-- not too sweet, not too tart and so easy (my first time making a curd and first time using a double boiler-- and by that I mean a pot with a metal bowl on top). Thanks a lot for posting this!

I LOVE this recipe. This was my first time making any sort of curd, and now I wonder why I waited so long! This is simple and delicious.  A couple of tips: to help prevent the egg from "scrambling" when added to the hot mixture, place the whole eggs in a mug of warm water at the very beginning of starting this recipe. That way the eggs will blend together much more easily. Whisk constantly while SLOWLY adding the eggs. 
 I used the curd in mini tart shells. I left half plain and half I poured melted chocolate into before adding the curd. Next time I will add a few fresh blueberries!

This recipe tasted excellent!  I doubled it to top a key lime cheesecake I made, and my guests loved it.  My only comment is that it's important to stir continuously when cooking for the 20-25 minutes, to ensure a smooth consistency in your final product.

Thank you for this delicious recipe, Sarah. We love the very bold, tart lime flavor with just enough sweetness. We spread it on gingersnaps for a mini key lime pie experience.

Amazing!  I used this as at topping for mini coconut cheesecakes.  

The only thing I found was that "medium-high" in the first step was too hot.  I'd suggest starting out with medium heat, and reducing to low for the 25 minute simmering in the second step...

I'm going to make again using lemons this time. I'm sure it will be just as delicious!

Have been making lemon curd for many years....was very careful to buy fresh limes and do everything exactly the way the recipe stated.  That was 7 days ago...placed the jars into the fridge after it had cooled thinking it would solidify overnight.  It still hasn't set.  Very disappointed...these were supposed to be Christmas presents.

A nice lime curd, reminding me of my mother's recipe for lemon butter/curd.  I ended up adding an extra egg for the recipe as it just was not as thick as I would like.   I used this curd for part of a trifle that I was making.

Absolutely delicious and very easy to make!  I did use about 1/8-1/4 cup less sugar as Beares limes are a bit less tart and acidic.  This is an excellent dessert to follow a rich meal.  It is also excellent with a raspberry sauce on top.

SUPER YUMMY and perfect flavor! I used Nellie & Joe's key lime juice instead of fresh. I was lazy & didn't use a double boiler. I ended up with a few little bits of egg in my finished curd. VERY easily remedied by straining the curd & it turned out perfectly. I will add more than 2 T of the mixture to temper the eggs next time. I used it to top a key lime cheesecake & it was a huge hit!

This has a great consistency .....not too thick...not too thin. It is very tart but tastes great when paired with something sweeter. I used it to fill a cake and frosted the sides with cream cheese frosting. So, paired with the sweeter cake and the sweet frosting, it created a lovely balance. Thank you for posting the recipe!

I had to find a key lime filling because the company I normally would buy from stop making it.  This was my first time making curd. It turned out great. I didn't have enough limes to make 3/4 cup of juice only half; and the other half I had enough lemons to get the other half. I did take the advice of another reviewer and added 1 tsp of flour to thicken it up. I'll be using this recipe again.

Looking at this w/fear I plunged ahead:  Put a metal bowl over boiling water so it was just touching.  Mixed everything: turned down to mid simmer. Thought 20-25 min was too long but it is  good.  Did not stir constantly but did keep close watch.  I strained/jarred.  It is lovely & quite delicious.  I MUST  comment that THIS IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART.  This has a substantial kick & aftertaste you get only from citrus.  If you are not a key lime fan, choose something else. I see now why the curds are as popular as they are in UK, but this is a deliciously wicked taste for now

My boss loves Coconut Cake and Key Lime Pie. After having seen a Piecaken (Pake is better term), I decided to combine the two and used this curd for the pie filling that was inside the cake. Perfect balance with the sweetness of the coconut and so easy to make. Thanks Sarah for the recipe!

This recipe was very simple and delicious. I tried it on 7/18/2015 as a topping for cheesecake -- it worked perfectly for what I wanted. I made enough to have plenty more to use on toast, etc. and everyone who has tried it has really liked it.

My middle sister and I were in the mood for both Key Lime Pie and Cheesecake, but didn't like the recipes for the Key Lime Cheesecake online or on Pinterest, so we wound up working with 2 different recipes and, at her suggestion, topped it with lime curd. She had made lemon curd before, but not lime, but we had the Key Limes so we googled and came across this recipe. We used it as a spread on top of the cheesecake and wow was it good! This recipe is not for the faint of heart! If you like a nice tart taste with a little sweetness, this is heaven! I plan on making itagain this weekend for a Church supper and will definitely take pictures this time of the finished product!

If key lime pie had a soulless...this is what it would taste like.  WAY better than I suspected.  This will be a filling for David's yellow cake.  I will put coconut milk in instead of regular milk and the Swiss buttercream will have coconut rum in it as well.  Should be miraculous!

This is an easy great tasting recipe. I used it inside crepes with either sweetened blended cottage cheese, strawberries, blueberries or chocolate sauce.

I made this last night and my huband hovered over me the whole time! He LOVES lime anything and this was the perfect lime curd. I had to shoo him away so he didn't try and eat it! Excellent on toast.
