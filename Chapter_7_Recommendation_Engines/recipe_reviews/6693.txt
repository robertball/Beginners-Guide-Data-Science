I increase buttermilk to 1 3/4 cups. I also mix several batches of the dry ingredients (not including yeast) and store it in disposable containders in my pantry. When it is time to make a loaf, the buttermilk, butter, and yeast are a snap to add!

Delicious is an understatement for this recipe. I can't make it fast enough for my family. Its tasty for toast, too. I add 2T vital wheat gluten and get a nice high, tight textured, dense bread with awesome flavor. What more can be said about this recipe? Just follow the directions and let your bread machine do its work. I set my machine for the dough cycle, then take the dough out, shape it, place it in a 9X5 pan, then bake at 375 degrees for 33 minutes exactly.I just sit back and wait for a pefect loaf every time!Thanks, Debbie. I will make this again and again and again.....;0)

I think there is a mistake in this recipe...I only added 1/3 cup wheat flour to this and it worked fine. Use only 1/3 cup and it will turn out!

I tried this today and boy it flopped. I used my bread machine and added ingredients in order listed and my bread machine(got for Christmas) couldn't even get it to mix all the way it was so dry. Much of it stuck to the pan and the rest never did get mixed even close to what it should have been. Maybe my bread machine needed the ingredients assembled differently.

I have had mixed success with two bread machines now, but this recipe has proven itself time and again.  Plus it solves the riddle of what to do with leftover buttermilk from my holiday baking!

This bread was excellent.  However, based on other reviews and other bread machine recipes I have made, I lowered the bread flour to 2 cups and added 2 T. of Gluten.  The bread was moist and tasty.

This is one of THE best bread recipies I've found in many years of baking bread.  
It is as moist as 'store-bought', which my kids do prefer.   We make the dough in the 
bread machine, then divide the dough into 2 bread pans.   Then we cover it with plastic
plastic wrap and put it to rise in the refrigerator overnight.  By morning, it is perfect
for baking in the oven (350 for 35 min 'til internal temp of 190 degrees).  Also,
it's the perfect recipe for white bread.  Just substitute white bread flour for the
rye.    Thanks very much for sharing this great recipe.   Love the sour rye flavor!

A very dense bread, with just a hint of buttermilk taste. Just the way I like my bread. Try it if you like dense bread, and don't be skeptical about the 2 1/4 t yeast: they are needed.

We have found this bread to be rather dry.  It has a nice flavor, but it's pretty hard and difficult to use for much of anything besides toast.

I followed recipe exactly and started my bread machine.  It was hopping all over the counter and making a lot of noise.  The dough was like cement.  I added about 1/4 cup milk and it thinned out and started to knead normally.  I left it on the counter in the same spot I always place it when making bread.  About 10 minutes later, I heard a tremendous crash.  The bread machine had vibrated off the counter to the floor and shattered.  Dough, glass, metal and plastic everywhere.  It flew into the hallway and two adjacent rooms.  Lucky, no damage to my mexican tile floor.  Dangerous recipe and expensive too, includes the cost of a new bread machine.  Obviously, this recipe needs more liquid or less flour.  Good luck if you still dare to try it.!

This recipe definitely has too much flour--3 1/2 cups of flour is generally about as much flour as you need in order to make a loaf of bread--unless you've got some extreme humidity going on.  So, I, too, adjusted the recipe to decrease some of that flour.  It turned out perfectly:  a nice sour flavor wit a moist crumb.  Perfect for toast or sandwiches.  Thanks for the recipe!

I don't know about other's bread machines but this is definitely too much flour for mine.  I used 1/3 cup of whole wheat.   I make a lot of bread and you have to have the dough the consistency of soft play dough without being sticky.   So you have to go by the feel sometimes instead of how much flour or liquid is called for.   But this is a good bread.

Whoever wrote this recipe didn't scale it right, it does NOT fit in a 1.5 lb. machine. There's only supposed to be 3 total cups of flour for a 1.5 lb. recipe, and I knew that, but I went ahead and tried this recipe as written anyway. Big mistake! My machine couldn't even mix it.

I also changed this recipe reversing the quantities of flour (1 1/3 cup bread flour, 2 2/3 cups wheat flour) , added 2 tablespoons of vital wheat gluten and switched the sugar for three tablespoon of honey.  I did not sweat the extra 1/4 teaspoon of yeast - just used the usual 2 teaspoon packet of yeast.  I have a two-paddle, horizontal pan Zojirushi bread machine.  I used the basic wheat setting.  The bread turned out great!  Very moist and delicious.

I made this into 3 mini loaves and baked them in my oven at 375. The taste of this bread is very good, and it rises well too, especially if you add some gluten (I added 2 T.) I also added 2 T. dry milk powder for a little extra sweetness.

I had a taste for onion bread, but did not have have powdered milk called for in most recipes.  I did have buttermilk and decided to improvise.  I added 1/2 packet onion soup mix, a little onion powder and some dried minced onions.  I added a little water, as it was mixing up a little dry (maybe from the powder in the onion soup mix) and it turned out to be a delicious onion bread...this recipe is very adaptable and delicious.  Next time I will try the original recipe!!  Ginger

Love this recipe.  I listened to many other reviewers and decreased the amount of flour used (3 cups bread flour and 1/2 cup of wheat flour) and added vital wheat gluten (2 Tablespoons the first time 1.5 thereafter).  We love the bread. It is now my regular sandwich loaf recipe. Consistency is really nice, not too crumbly, perfect moisture level. I bake on the Basic bread cycle with medium crust.  Excellent.

This is our fave bread machine recipe. I increased the buttermilk amount to 1-3/4 cups (I zap it for 45 sec in the microwave to warm) and I reduce the wheat flour to 1 cup. I set my Cuisinart to large loaf, light crust and it turns out perfect every time.

Wanna try a vegan version?  Use 1 and 1/8 cup of coconut milk and 1/2cup of soy milk.  Use 3 Tablespoons of Earth Balance butter in place of the 1.5 Tablespoons of margin.  I also use agave in place of the sugar.  Its the best wheat bread ever!

This bread was fantastic! I completely omitted the whole wheat and did not replace it with anything else.The 3 cups of bread flour was just perfect. I increased the sugar by 1 tsp. I used a stick of butter. I cut it into 6 slices putting two in the bottom with the buttermilk and then used the remaining 4 slices on the top after the flour in each corner of my bread maker! I used the white/light setting.

I just tried making this bread and it was a disaster. I make several loaves of bread a week and I think the previous rating was right about WAY to much flour.  My bread machine smelled like it was burning.  I have a big machine that makes a 2 pound loaf.  As soon as I took the dough out the blade starting turning.  I found a similar recipe on here that only uses 1/3 of wheat flour.  I think I may try that one.  Would not make this again.

This recipe is not good at tall.  I did what it said for a 1lb and and I let it do its thing and all it is, is flour.

What a mess. The flour to liquid ratio is definitely off. Way too dry, and I rarely have a flop -- but this one was a major flop. My guess is there is an error in the amount of wheat flour. i believe it should be 1/3-cup and not 1 1/3 -cup.

I have a terrible bread machine. Most recipes do not turn out so I was doubtful about this one. I had to add 2 tablespoons of water to the recipe while it was kneading but hands down one of the best recipes out of my bread maker

I made this in my cuisinart bread maker and used the 1.5 lb loaf setting.  It came out perfect.

I unfortunately didn't have enough buttermilk on hand so I had about 1 1/4 cups of buttermilk and then I substituted the last 1/4 cup with whole milk. It still turned out great (maybe a little denser) and my husband asked if I could make another loaf for sandwiches! This was simple, easy to follow, and a great way to break in my new bread machine!

Love this loaf!!! Made it yesterday and must say that I think it is the best bread recipe that I have ever tried. Made it using the recipe exactly as it is and have another loaf on today...to take to a family  get-together tomorrow. Thanks for sharing this recipe Debbie.

Ok...this bread is FANTASTIC.  BUT, you HAVE to lower the amount of wheat flour from 1 1/3 cup to 1/2 cup.  Too much flour.  I could just tell by the recipe that it calls for too much.  I used the same amount of bread flour and added 1/2 cup of ww flour and it was DIVINE.  SO SO GOOD.  My kids DEVOURED it.

I made this recipe just as it was written and it worked great in my old tempermental breadmaker.  My family loved it!
