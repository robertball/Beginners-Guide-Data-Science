This is actually a really good dip - but I make it a bit differently. I don't "layer" it, the cream cheese might overwhelm the salsa. Instead I mix the cream cheese and salsa together. You can do this by microwave or on low heat, simmering, on the stove. I omit the cheddar cheese. Now, this can be served one of two ways. It's GREAT hot and creamy, or you can serve it cool - which means you're dealing with the cream-cheese's original consistency, only with salsa. I think either is great. Good recipe.

I make this but layer it differently.  I spread the cream cheese in the bottom, then put the salsa on top.  Afterwards I cover it with the shredded cheese.  Then I microwave it until the cheese is melted and serve with tortilla chips.  It's so delicious and everyone always raves about this savory and salty dip.

This dip is wonderful if you do a bottom layer of Cream Cheese, then a layer of refried beans, a layer of salsa and top with chedder chesse.  Then put into microwave for approx 2 minutes and serve with chips...Yummy!!

I too do it a bit differently.  I combine the salsa and creamed cheese and place in a shallow pan.  I top it with 2 tablespoons of finely chopped chives then the cheddar cheese.  I place in the oven for about 10 to 15 minutes at 300º F. until warmed through.    My kids like it with bagel chips or spread on thin slices of Italian bread brushed with some EVOO and garlic.

I always get so many compliments on this dip. I mix ½cream cheese and ½mayo. I top it with the salsa and some chopped green onions. Then I decide if I want shrimp or crab on top. Sometimes I use both - shrimp on one side and crab on the other. Then I top with mozzarella cheese and serve. I don't heat it up at all. You can eat with crackers or tortilla chips. It is delish!!

I mix the cream cheese and salsa together. Then, a can of chili with beans.  The cheddar cheese goes on top and is baked.

This recipe is a great beginning recipe for this kind of dip. But I made some changes: I added a can of Hormel chilliw/beans, and some diced onions.I also love to add a dollop of sour cream on the top. It was really a hit with my three granddaughters. They expect this dip each time they come visit Granny, (me), along with a big bag of tortilla chips. Its yummy.

This was okay---when the cheese got cold it was hard to eat.It would be good if you kept it warm the entire time.

Pretty good considering there are only 3 ingredients. I had a guest bring this to my house and prepare it on 2 occasions and it takes about 3 or 4 minutes of prep time. You could use any salsa, but a scoop chip works best. Many people enjoyed this dip.

It was great.  My son, wife, and myself finished it off in about an hour.  The cheddar cheese was little hard to scoop with chips but the taste made up for the broken chips.  This is something I will make again soon.

Try adding a layer of taco meat to it. Makes it fabulouse. Layer cream cheese, then taco meat, then salsa, then cheddar cheese. Bake untill cheese is melted. Serve warm and at room temp with Scoops. Mmm

Tried it as is the first time and found the cream cheese a bit overpowering. Cut the amount of cream cheese in half and added a bit of taco seasoning to it before layering. That made it great for my taste.

i always mix the cream cheese with about 1/2 cup mayo or miracle whip.  and the salsa with seafood sauce to make it a little tangy and top with shredded cheese, shredded lettuce, chopped onions, black olives... its easy, tasty and the ingredients can be in the fridge for unexpected guests.

This was yummy! I love the fact that this simple, yet delicious dip is made with things that I ALWAYS have on hand. Hubby and the little guy tore this up...there were no leftovers! I did just put everything together (including the salsa on top) and just threw it in the oven until it was all warm and melty, which worked perfectly. A definate keeper that would also be great w/ other things added such as green onions and black olives, but absolutely not necessary. Thanks for sharing. :)

Great for sporting events and an easy dish for family get togethers! The only thing I changed, was layering it cream cheese, then the salsa, and melting the cheese on top. Great hit with my family and friends!!!

This is actually a GREAT dip! I had this dip for the first time about 11 or 12 years ago at a friend's house and at first I thought "Cream Cheese and Salsa!!!" but when I tasted the combination with the salty crisp tortilla strips, I thought it was amazing! And very simple too, so that makes it even better!!!
