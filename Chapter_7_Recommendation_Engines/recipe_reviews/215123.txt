This was good-tasting and easy to make. A few changes: I didn't have puff pastry so I used a regular pie crust baked as directed and brushed with butter. I also used drained canned plums instead of fresh, because that's what I had on hand. Instead of the brown sugar, I poured about 2T of the heavy syrup from the can over the pie. It probably came out a little too moist, but it was still scrumptious! I want to make this recipe as written sometime soon.

8.13.16   Hate changing a recipe first time through, but I did make one modification.  This is an 8x8 pie, and I just couldn’t imagine a pound of shredded chicken.  I cut that amount back significantly and mixed it with 3 plums (not 4), and I still had a dish full of chicken...would do that again.  Thought I had mace on hand but I didn’t, so I did add some cardamom which is a good flavor affiliate for plums.  This cooked up beautifully, has not only a wonderful balance of sweet and savory, but lovely presentation, as well.  I wouldn’t hesitate to serve this to company.  Very, very nice recipe.

I made this for dinner last night.  We liked it very much; however, we thought it was very heavily chicken and puff pastry.  It needed something else.  Next time I will try adding some veggies, especially some cubed pre-roasted butternut squash which we usually have on hand(I think this will blend well with the sweetness of the plums).  But overall, this is a great idea.  The sweetness from the plums and the savory of the seasonings and chicken really go well together.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Original rating 7/2013 was 4 stars -- I made this with pie crust instead of puff pastry, and since I was out of mace, subbed 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp allspice. It was different, but good. I am pretty sure the puff pastry will make it even better. EDITED 7/2014 -- I've made this several times now following the recipe exactly. I think it's a 5 star recipe, and I tend to be stingy with 5 star ratings. The only thing I do that is beyond the directions is cook the chicken in chicken broth before shredding so its more flavorful.
