This is a fantastic recipe. I made a few minor modifications. I used half-n-half in place of the milk, kale in place of the spinach, lots more garlic,  added about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of diced onion with the sausage, and added sliced green onion tops with the parsley. I cooked the linguine two minutes shy of al dente (9 min), as it finishes to al dente as you toss it with the sauce and a good splash (1/4 cup or so) of the pasta water. The sauce is very rich, but the greens and lemon zest balance the richness. I will make this again!

I made this according the recipe except for adding more garlic (I always do). This was very flavorful but I think  would like it better with crumbled Italian sausage as the kielbasa was a little overpowering. Update-made again-still think Italian sausage would be good-I think I’m not crazy about the lemon zest-or maybe use a little less next time. I used whole milk but probably would be creamier with half-n-half.

This was a big hit and and the flavor of the sausage was wonderful in the pasta.  I wouldn't change a thing.

Would have liked it to be a bit saucier.

So the only downfall to this was the lemon zest.  I did sub spaghetti noodles for the linguine bc I was out but that doesn’t make a taste difference.  Anyway, I do plan to make this again minus the lemon zest and see how it goes.  Will likely add a bit of crushed red pepper too.  The sauce was a very pleasing creamy texture aside from the lemon zest skewing the flavor.

I substituted collard greens instead of spinach because I had them instead of spinach..  I like the collards and will use them the next time I make it.

It's was okay! But I it needs more spice! I will probably use a different sausage next time as well. It's a work in progress, but great start!

This recipe is very average.  I will keep looking for another Swedish meatball recipe. Virtually no seasonings.  I would not recommend .

My family loves linguine. They enjoyed the Hillshire linguine and there were no left overs.  I made the following changes because we like our  linguine spicy.  I added 3 cloves of garlic and increased the milk to one cup. I added 5 egg yolks, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder and 1 teaspoon of onion powder. I also added lemon juice at the end intead of using lemon zest.

I did this just as stated in the recipe. No changes. Here is my review. In my opinion, the sauce is a little bland. I do believe that the spinach needs to be added in to the pasta after you turn the fire off under it and left In the pot with the pasta in the water for a few minutes. Then drain it all. By doing it the way it is written, I could not get the spinach to wilt much. Otherwise I did like it. If I were to change anything else it would be to use a Alfredo sauce instead for more flavor.

This dish was delicious. I substituted the milk for half and half.  The only thing I would do differently is add just a bit more half and half to make a bit more sauce. I will definitely be making this again.
