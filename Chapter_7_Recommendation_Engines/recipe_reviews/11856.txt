I am a huge pasta lover, and let me say, I was not disappointed with this dish! Substituted Italian pancetta for actual bacon, added in a pinch of Italian seasoning and used rotini spirals since we didn't have any penne, but it never marred the taste a bit, enhanced it if anything. Warning: 12 ounces of pasta makes a lot, so double the amount of water needed.

This was my first attempt at an a la vodka sauce and my entire family went back for seconds! I did make some changes, though. After the addition of the chopped tomatoes, I took my immersion blender to the mixture as both my teenage sons won't go near any visible onion or tomato chunks. Once pureed, I knew I'd get it past their lips! I did leave the crushed tomato bits in though. I also added 1/2 tsp. dried basil for a touch of color. I used half & half and ended up using almost 3 cups. Delish! Diane :-)

I only rated this recipe as a three out of confusion.  When I made this last week by fiance adored it, and said it was the best vodka sauce he ever had . . . while on the other hand I couldn't even eat one serving of it because all I could taste was bacon, which was gross.  I guess that if you love bacon this is a good recipe, because my fiance made me promise not to get rid of the recipe so that I could make it down the road again for him.  I DID add some parmesan cheese to the sauce . . . because it really needed a little something extra.

This was one of the best vodka sauces I have ever tasted.  Before I added the pasta, I couldn't stop tasting it! It is great for a crowd since it can be prepared ahead of time.

GREAT dish...one of my favs.  I modify a little, sometimes using regular spaghetti sauce instead of crushed tomatoes and a can of diced tomatoes...all the same basic idea.  Usually use less onion and never skimp on the garlic.  Love this meal with kielbasa sausage or shrimp.  Yum!!!

I have tried many many different Penne a la Vodka recipes, and this is by far THE BEST I have yet to encounter!  Although I didn't follow the recipe EXACTLY, I would never have thought of making it like this otherwise.  I used Center cut bacons (b/c that's what I had in hand, but I realize using regular bacon may be too strong of a flavor, and you cut a lot of fat by using Center cut).  I also only use San Marzano Tomato Sauce, or Peeled Tomatoes, because they are less salty and every chef I know recommends them. I also did not use fresh tomatoes because I just happened to miss that part, but it was great nonetheless.  As for heavy cream, I never measure the full amount because it's usually too heavy for me, so I just eyeball it for color and my preference in flavor for the heavy cream.  Thank you so much for the recipe, I will never have to look up another Penne a la Vodka sauce recipe again!!

This was very good and very rich. The flavor was excellent. Next time, I'll saute the bacon separately so that it will crisp up. Thank you, Matt and Dave!

I LOVED this sauce and so did my family.  I was looking for a rose sauce and found this.  YUM!!  The 1st time I made it I had everything on hand except for the vodka so I left that out and it was still excellent.  I think I'll make it for dinner tonight!  :o)

This recipe is a favorite at our house.  I use Absolut Peppar as my vodka to give it a bit more kick.  As with every recipe, I add more garlic than called for!  It's fairly simple to prepare but goes over great with everyone that I make it for.

My family loved this recipe. I will be making it again, but next time I will not thinly slice the onions. My kids loved the taste, but could not get passed how visible the onion was. I suggest chopping the onion for those that have picky eaters.

Very happy with this recipe. I don't really follow directions very well, but mine turned out great! I didn't have crushed tomatoes, so I just used leftover tomato sauce. I also used a red onion. I don't know why the photo is white, because my pasta was pink. 

Definitely will make again!

I got so bored making the same red sauce pasta dishes, so when I stumbled on this I thought it was worth a try. It was absolutely delicious. I dipped some chicken strips in flour, salt and pepper and cooked them in a separate skillet and then added them to the sauce when they were done. I also added some sliced crimini mushrooms.   I did scale back the bacon to 5 strips and I only used a half cup of cream to cut down on the calories/fat a bit and I don't think anyone missed it. This is a great receipe, even on the weekdays, you can have it on the table relatively quickly! I'll definitely be making this again!

We really liked this.  I like how it uses both fresh and canned tomatoes.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes, so I used one 14 oz. can of petite diced and one 14 oz. can of tomato sauce.  The bacon added a great flavor.  I cut down on the cream and omitted the vodka, since I didn't have any.  Served with a baguette and steamed asparagus.

Made this with some reservations about how it would taste because of the onions.  I cooked the bacon for a bit and then added the ingredients as directed.  When I combined everything I finally took a taste.  OMG!! I have NEVER tasted vodka sauce this good.  I made it as a surprise dinner for my boyfriends birthday. If he likes is half as much as me I'll be happy.  I'll find out soon.

I only used about 1/4 the recommended amount of bacon, and found the taste of it overwhelming.  Next time, I will leave it out completely.

Ok, I will give a five even with a few changes. I loved this sauce, however did end up using a bit more Vodka and adding additional garlic. I also used diced pancetta rather than regular bacon. I added the garlic after I had cooked the onions, ( to avoid burning it.) and along with the garlic added a few pinches of red pepper flakes.  In addition I added about a quarter of a cup of fresh grated parmesan along with the cream and crushed tomatoes. ( Omitted the salt alltogether as did not seem to need it with the cheese.) Garnished with more shaved parmesan and lots of fresh basil.

Yummy!!!

This was okay, but the tomato flavor was so dominant that many of the other ingredients might as well have not been there. The leftovers were not good when reheated.

The sauce was fine, but the dish would have been improved overall if the bacon was changed to the italian dry cured version.

Oh was this a BIG hit with my hubby!It's been years since I've had this, so I thought I would give it a try myself. It was simple and fun to make. Not only did we have it Friday night but he begged for it again Saturday night. He grew up on only southern cooking so I was alittle worried, but he LOVED it!

I made it for a dinner party of 8 - everyone loved it. They couldn't believe I made the sauce (people thought it was store bought!) Will include this for future dinner parties!

I made this for my dinner party tonight and it was great.  I doubled the recipe so there would be plenty for everyone and I put some sauce in the freezer to enjoy later.  I've made similar dish before but this one is definitely better.

Outstanding! I love the twist of bacon and red onions. This recipe has fresh tomatoes as well. I never made this dish before, but it is so easy. My family  loved this so much. Compared to versions we get at various italian restaurants, they said this was so much better. I'm in love. The only problem is  my hips will hate it.

I made this a little different. I used pancheta bacon a little onion and a drop of oil to sauté. 2 cans crushed tomatoes, I crushed 5 cloves of garlic and Italian seasoning salt and pepper. 

Made the pasta and topped with grating cheese. It was so yummy. Will definitely make again.

A tasty dish but a little muted for someone who's a fan of tomato sauce; that much cream really mellows it out.
