As a "dish" it is ok. I had fun making these and the kids loved the look of them.  I thought of using stick pepperoni  instead of hotdogs and adding pizza sauce and mozzarella cheese. That way when it is cut it "bleeds" sauce and the cheese strings out just adding to the gross factor that teens and kids love.

I tried the suggestion of the other reviewer and added mozzarella cheese to it.  I also used sausage instead of hot dogs.  It turned out great! And, the kids thought it was cool to pull off the fingers and eat them.

I thought this was extremely easy to make BUT I used 1/2 tube total to make 1 complete hand(top & bottom of hand). It baked up perfectly & tasted great!

Loved making this! So interchangeable with your meat addition. This one is with beef sausage bites. Will be adding black olive nails and serving on a bed of linguine and pizza sauce.

These were fun and easy. I placed strawberry preserves on the tips, then placed the almonds, then baked - less work. The almond cooks into the cookie nicely. I used chocolate chips for warts. They were not as sweet a cookie as I prefer.
