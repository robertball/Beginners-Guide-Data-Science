Has anyone else looked at the nutrional facts on this recipe? I'm sure it is good, however, it's a heart attack on a plate.

Marina, life doesn't get any better than this. To cut down on the fat, I used evaporated skim milk. Believe me, when I've spent a week making low fat dinners, I'll definitely do the heavy cream route, but for now, this was great! For you guys who haven't used the new "brand name" boxed tortellini yet, please try it. I think it's better than frozen. Delicious and thanks!

there's ways you can cut down on the calories if that's what you're watching. i substituted the egg yolks with egg beaters and used "smart bacon" (you can find this usually in the health section)

Now this is what I'm talking about. It's simple and non-time consuming. We made it last night and it was great.

This is now the favorite recipe in the house.  This recipe is very rich and can also be used for other cream sauce recipes, it is very easy to make.  Next time I will suggest adding some garlic flavor.

Who cares about the fat content? As long as you don't eat like this every day, why worry? This is an awesome, easy recipe. I used cheese tortellini, and added peas. My family LOVED it and there were no leftovers.

I made this recipe for myself and my boyfriend. I used half heavy cream and half light cream, as I had some that I wanted to use up. I also added garlic powder to the sauce, because I didn't have any fresh to saute with the bacon. We loved it, and have been eating it for the last couple days, as it's more than enough for 4 people.

I didn't eat this only becuase I am on a low calorie diet and it pretty much exceeded my entire daily allowance!  But my three year old and husband loved it, so much they want to eat it every week...too many colories to do that though.

Unfortunately, I did not get to try this the night I made it.  The next day it was good, but once you rewarm it the cheese separates into oil and cheese.  But I could tell it would have been FANTASTIC the night of.

I made this recipe with half cream and half milk. I did not like how it turned out.  I am not sure why but I will not be using this again.

To cut down on fat/calories I used turkey bacon and evaporated skim milk.  4 cups of this was just way too much, so next time I would start with 2 and add more if needed.  Would make again!

This was amazing! Everyone, including my young kids who do not usually like sauce on their pasta gobbled this up. They even had seconds. If you are looking for something healthy, modify this or look elsewhere. If you are looking for a sauce rich and full of flavor and don't care about the fat content then you have got to try this recipe.

Amazing basic recipe for carbonara. I added some pepper, garlic and salt as I found it a bit bland. I used cheese tortellini as that was all I had. Everyone loved it, even my extra picky kids. My 4 year old called it "the best dinner ever".
I will keep this as my go to carbonara recipe and make it again and again. Quick, easy, and fairly inexpensive.

I  made exactly as per the instructions above and added frozen peas at the end when combining the bacon & tortellini.  My husband loved it, said it was restaurant quality and asked for it to be added to the weekly rotation.
