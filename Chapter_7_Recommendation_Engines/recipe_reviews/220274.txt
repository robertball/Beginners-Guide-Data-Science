Made this for Recipe Group...We LOVED this! I was too lazy to drag out the blender, lol, so (earlier in the day) I grated the cucumber and squeezed it dry, then just mixed it in a bowl w/ the rest of the ingredients and refrigerated it to allow the flavors to blend. I marinated my chicken for about 4 hours, only using about 2 tsps. of the oregano b/c I didn't want it to be too overpowering, and that was perfect for us. I cooked the chicken in a pan w/ evoo on the stove instead of broiling it and that worked great. Hubby made several comments on how good these were (and I agree), so that makes this a keeper for us~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made this using the listed ingredients. I used whole wheat pita bread rounds.  Grilled the chicken versus broiling in the oven.  I cut the grilled chicken strips into smaller portions and sprinkled them with Cavender's All Purpose Greek Seasoning. Good easy recipe on a hot summer day!  This recipe was faceless and was the Recipe Group selection for week 7/7/12. Thanks KarenCanCook for sharing your recipe!  I'll definitely make it again as we really liked the Tzatziki sauce!

For the Recipe Group:  These were so easy and delicious!  I prepared as written, but had hubs grill the chicken since it was a gorgeous night.  Loved the sauce, heaped it on with lots of fresh veggies.  This is a great weeknight dinner.  I'll be making these again.  Sincere thanks for sharing your recipe with AR.

Absolutly wonderful. I make my own Tzatziki sauce, Hummus, and pita bread when I make greek meals, usually Keftethes (greek Meatballs). I Tried this and it was just as good as Greek meatballs but cheaper and easier. I like Tzatziki II from this site, although I have realized I like sourcream more than yogurt and it is cheaper. I also just squize the water out of the cucumber using a paper towel but dont mess with getting the water out of the yogurt or sourcream and  I like "real Hummus" from this site. I cant remember where I found my recipe for keftethes but it is a mixture of a pound of lamb, 1/2 pound ground beef, mint, bread crumbs, egg, and garlic. and then I lightly fry them in a pan. I tried googling but all recipes add something I do not use. As for the chicken I used the marinade but did not broil. I used a frying pan and put in alittle oil on medium high (my oven goes from 1-8 and High I was on 8) when the pan is hot i dump in the chicken I then let it brown on each sides and cook. it getting brown is what creates the flavor. Sometimes when I dont have time to make pita bread i will buy flat bread and heat it in a pan for 15 to 20 seconds a side with alittle oil. and for added flavor I like to grill red onions in a pan with alittle butter or oil. and Don't forget to top with Feta!

This recipe was pretty good; the tzatziki was flavorful, and the chicken tasted ok. My oven doesn't have a broiler (why? I don't know, it's German) so I wound up cooking the chicken in a skillet. Overall it was a good recipe, but I just felt that the chicken was lacking something; that it needed more flavor. I would definitely try it again though and experiment more with different spices.

This was good but I had higher hopes for it.  I actually thought this recipe was time consuming between the sauce prep, marinate, and dicing of ingredients.  I think the chicken would have been better grilled vs broiled in the oven. The dressing (Tzatziki sauce) was light tasting but I yearned for a deeper flavor than what I got here, perhaps sour cream in place of the greek yogurt would help.

Recipe Group Selection:  07, July 2012  My family loved this gyro.  I marinated the chicken strips for about 4 hours and cooked on the grill in a basket rather than broil.  I made the sauce as stated, but the next time I will NOT use the blender.  It made the sauce way too thin.  Next time I will just blend by hand.  We have a favorite Greek restaurant close to home, so I purchased homemade pitas to use with this recipe.  I served this with 'Onion Pasta' from AR and we enjoyed a terrific dinner.  My family LOVED this week's selection.  Thanks KarenCanCook for sharing your recipe.  It is a keeper!

Tasty and easy!  I marinated the chicken for a few hours and it was very flavorful, I pounded it out and grilled it.  I will cut the garlic down to just 1 clove in the sauce next time as it was a little overpowering with raw garlic taste for me.

I sent this recipe to my husband and he followed it exactly and it was amazing! Best dinner! Delicious! We did add feta cheese in the final gyros (it was what inspired the meal idea, something to go with the feta we had) Definitely will make again the exact same way.

Great recipe!  Perfect for summer dinner! I made everything much earlier in the day.  Then instead of heating up the oven I cooked the chicken on the grill.    The sauce was really good.  Our only complaint is that the chicken needed more seasoning.  Next time I will add a little salt and more lemon to the marinade.

I loved this recipe! It tasted very nearly authentic and I would make it again. I added some light sour cream to the sauce and didn't have cucumber, so I used zucchini instead. I ended up with lots of leftover sauce, so I'll probably use less yogurt next time. Thank you!!

6-30-2019 ~In all the years I’ve been a member of Allrecipes, I’ve never come across this recipe.  Poor me.  Thanks to my daughter, a young mother of three hard-to-please little kids, I have now prepared and enjoyed something new for us which I know will be on our table frequently.  Hubs, who is as similarly hard-to-please as those kids, will ensure that!  Daughter raved about this, so I was anxious to give it a try. Oregano is a strong-flavored herb that is not generally a favorite of mine so to be on the safe side I reduced it to about 2 tsp., which turned out to be just right for us.  I marinated the chicken for not one hour, but four.  I’m not sure how much of a difference that made one way or another but judging by the outcome I’ll do it the same way next time. Hubs quickly grilled it outside in a cast iron skillet. I took the easy way out, I admit, and used a commercial tzatziki sauce from Costco (which Hubs has quickly become a huge fan of).  I thinly sliced both the red onion and tomato, and included some thinly sliced English cucumber as well - very nice addition! Warming the pitas (also from Costco) in a pan with olive oil didn’t appeal to me, so I simply warmed them in the microwave between paper towels.  This ultimately was not just easy to prepare and fun to eat, it was simply “D” good.  Hubs, who is not a leftovers kind of guy, requested a repeat for tonight’s supper.  High praise indeed.  I will have to see what else my daughter has in her main dish treasure tr

I prepared this dish twice.  

The first time,  my daughter selected it for us to prepare together.  She is twelve.  She focused on the sauce, while I worked on the marinade and chicken prep.  We broiled the chicken.  The chicken turned out alright, but we ended up with too much sauce.   

The second time, I prepared the marinade and then grilled the chicken strips outside on a propane Weber.  The chicken turned out great as evidenced by both my wife and daughter eating all of the chicken while I was out cycling.  Both my wife and daughter informed me that this recipe is a keeper and they asked me to prepare it again.  Nice job and thank you!

After reading the comments on this recipe I decided to take some creative liberties. First, for the tzatziki I used a food processor for the cucumber only. Seeded and finely minced cucumber squeezed through a tea towel to get rid of the excess moisture. Then I mixed the rest of the sauce ingredients by hand. Secondly I used fresh dill in the tzatziki. For the marinade I used chicken thighs for more of a flavor. In addition to the ingredients listed for the marinade I added about 2 tsp of dried parsley and ~1 tsp of ground thyme, ~1 tsp dried basil, and about 1 1/2 tsp of dill weed.  You can even add rosemary, marjoram, nutmeg and cinnamon if you like those flavors to get a great greek seasoning. I will update my review once we taste it tonight! Currently marinating the chicken thighs and letting the tzatziki flavors marinate in the fridge too!

Here's the recipe I used to inspire my marinade: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/231228/greek-seasoning-blend/

We just loved this recipe.  My Greek yogurt was old (& bad), so I used sour cream instead for the sauce  & didn't use blender but just hand-mixed.  We can't grill at our apt. complex, so broiling the chicken was a real winner for us.  No pita bread either, so I used small flour tortillas toasted over our gas burner flame.  My hubby raved about the flavors; they were just right for us.  THANK YOU so much for this delish recipe!  A real fresh summer treat!

I also marinate the chicken longer and grill it. I think it gets better every time I make it.

This was a hit with the whole family. Changed the sauce to add a bit of spice. Used greek yogurt with a fresh habanero pepper, two chipolte peppers and some garlic powder. Took the leftovers for lunch and all my coworkers wanted the recipe.

First of all, the flavor was delicious and spot on. I was very much pleased with how the chicken turned out. Unfortunately, the tzatziki sauce I made got really runny and it kinda ruined the texture of the whole dish. I skimmed some other recipes online, and some of them say you should salt your cucumbers and get them dry before adding them to the blender. If you want good tzatziki sauce, I recommend checking out these other recipes.

I had already made tzatziki sauce, so I used that.  I marinated the chicken. The only  change in the marinade was the red wine vinegar. I did not have any so I used balsamic vinegar. I did not fry the bread. I used pita pocket bread and stuffed the chicken and veggies in the pita pocket and put tzatziki sauce on top. It was delicious.

This dish was super easy and delicious. The only change I made was that I baked the chicken in the marinade because I don't know how to broil. The chicken was really juicy and flavorful. This will now be in our regular meal rotation.

I loved it! It was perfect! The chicken marinade was super! It broiled perfectly! I cooked my onions because that's how they're prepared when we buy gyros. The chicken Took more time in the broiler than the recipe stated. I used sour cream for the sauce because that's what I had on hand. 

WARNING! Do not follow these directions for making the sauce. The 1st batch of it I made tasted amazing but had the consistency of a glass of milk.  My 2nd try I squeeze dried the cucumber before chopping it in my magic bullet. After blending it I blotted it on paper towels and hand mixed the sauce. This time it was awesome! I'm sharing this recipe with family and friends asap!

Love this recipe. However it seems like there isn't enough marinade for chicken and too much sauce. Next time I will double the liquid in marinade and half the sauce recipe. Other than that, this is delicious!!

I thought the flavor of the chicken was delicious. I started it on the grill then I put it in the oven, and poured the marinade over it to keep it moist. I will definitely make this again.

I will be making this again, but I am going to use less oregano next time. The taste of the oregano was kind of overwhelming. I omitted the lemon zest and just added 2 extra tbs of lemon juice. I am also in love with vinegar so I added a extra tbs of that. I marinated the chicken and then cut it into pieces and cooked it in a pan with the left over marinade. I also used a differen sauce receipe but I think im going to make it with sour cream instead of greek yogurt next time. The thickness wasn't an issue, im just not a huge fan of greek yogurt. If you're planning on making left overs, I wouldn't heat the pitas because they are super tough after you brown them and the reheat them. Also, I used green salad mix instead of iceburg. Very yummy.

My rating is for the chicken only as I did not make the rest.  I made the marinade as written except I marinated the chicken in a resealable plastic bag for probably 4 hours and then grilled on a grill pan on top of the stove.  It had a pretty good flavor.  Since my husband and I like spicy, bold flavors I might add some cayenne or other seasoning next time as it was a little bland for our tastes.

I very much liked all the components of this recipe. It just so happened I picked up the WORST pitas in the world, which unfortunately ruined the entire gyro for my husband and I. I will definitely try again... with different pitas!

My hubby and I liked these, but my 9 yr old who loves gyros did not. I left out the cucumber, maybe that was why.

This came out great! I marinated chicken tenders for six hours, and they cooked up very nicely and quickly on my Foreman grille. I followed some of Naples' tips that worked well. I used a store-bought tzatziki sauce which was very good and saved time. I heated the pita bread, wrapped in paper towels, in the microwave. Personal preference, I skipped the lettuce but did add thinly sliced English cucumber along with the tomatoes and onions. Thanks for this delicious and healthy recipe!

I grilled the chicken but otherwise followed the marinade recipe (90 min marinade time). I'm honestly impressed (I'm an experienced cook and simple works for me). I'd definitely make this again. Also, I did salt, seed, and squeeze the cucumbers (English variety) for the sauce. I mixed the garlic into the yogurt the night before to mellow it but finished the rest sauce within a few hours of chicken cooking time.

Okay for aa base line....  Tastes like lemon chicken with a dry yogurt sauce.   The tzatziki needs some sugar or something sweet, and I'm not sure about the chicken but it's missing something. I will find something different for next time.

Fantastic flavor! I sauteed chicken 'cause I tend to cremate in the broiler.  Next time I'll heat the pitas a tad more in the microwave so they are more pliable. *Stellar* recipe!

This came out great! Next time I'm adding Feta to make it even more delicious. I would slightly alter how the tzatziki sauce is made as blending the cucumber really makes it too runny. Next time I would grate the cuke and drain before adding them into the yogurt.

This was a fun unique meal we have never done. We also bought the frozen lamb meat in the freezer section at Sams club. The 5 kids ate only the shaved gyro meat and didn't even try the chicken. I have to agree the gyro meat was a little better but more fattening of course. We cooked the chicken on the frying pan which we thought was great.  I also purchased some tzatziki sauce at Sams club. But I made this written one too. I made the HUGE mistake of not draining any of the generic brand Greek yogurt. Next time I will buy the more expensive brand yogurt because it does make a difference. It was way too soupy so I drained the finished product which helped a little. I then added some of it to the package sauce I bought and it was better. I liked the fresh cucumber taste of this recipe that the package sauce didn't have. I also would have liked some chunks of fresh cucumber in it. I will for sure make this again. The pita bread was amazing after toasting it on the frying pan.

Delicious!! Having just returned home from Greece in the last two weeks, we were all hungry for authentic Greek chicken gyros. I searched for a recipe and found this one to be very close to the real thing! I cut the garlic in half because the garlic flavor should not overwhelm the other flavors. Also used an oregano spice grinder which added a fresher flavor. Did not make the Tzatzeki sauce, used store bought instead. I’m looking forward to trying the sauce the next time I make this recipe, but will not be putting it into the blender, as authentic sauce is usually thicker with small cuts of cucumber in it. Don’t forget to toast your bread, and also remember to add a few french fries!! Most of the chicken gyros that we had in Santorini had french fries on them!

I followed the recipe mostly. All I changes was  I combined sour cream and Greek yogurt  about 8 oz total to make less sauce. Based on reviews I also squeezed the water out of the cucumber and mixed the sauce hand not blend as recommended. My family loved it and we are fans of Greek and Mediterranean  dishes. Easy to follow recipe. Will definitely make this dish again maybe tonight.

We all loved these! I made the marinade as written and felt the oregano was a bit to much for us. The taziki sauce makes a lot, and I cut the yogurt in half. This gave it the perfect amount of flavors. Make sure you squeeze the cucumbers prior to adding the to your sauce or your sauce will end up watery.  We had a lot of sauce and chicken so we made wraps for lunch the next day, delicious!!!

We just got back from Greece so I was excited to try this recipe. I have to say I was very dissapointed. The chicken was bland and may as well not have been marinated. The tzatziki recipe was ok but not great. I had much better results with a different recipe done in my slow cooker.

I made it without any changes.  I found the sauce to be too acidic, and the chicken was overpowered by too much oregano.  It was also quite fussy to make in the broiler.  Next time, I would marinate the chicken breast whole (with a lot less oregano), grill it, rest it, and slice it  before serving it.  And I would use a completely different sauce recipe with a better depth of flavor and a lot less acid.

This was something very different for me to make and I loved it! Followed the recipe, my only issue was we had a ton of sauce left over.

Only exception I made was I cut the chicken into cubes rather than strips to hurry the marinating along.  My guys loved it.

Came out great ! The only negative was that the sauce was very thin after blending it. I am sure that was due to basically liquifying the Cucumber and I even used Greek Yogurt. Next time I will use less Cucumber in the blender and shred the rest and mix it in.

Outstanding recipe!! I was surprised how good it was. I cut the oregano down a bit based on other reviewer's comments, but that's the only modification I did. I served the chicken on top of grilled pita bread with lettuce, black olives, chopped tomatoes, and the yogurt sauce. Thank you for this wonderful recipe. It will save me a lot of money from going to the Greek restaurant!!

I did exactly what the recipe said and I thought it was to lemony. Also 16oz of Greek yogurt was way to much and it was like a tasteless salad dressing. It should be much thicker. It wasn't so horrible that I couldn't eat it, but it is not something I will try again or recommend.

I made the chicken, not the tzatziki sauce but I regret that. Marinated the chicken, threw it in the Actifry for 15 min and served it with lettuce, red onion, tomato and store-bought tzatziki sauce. I only with the tzatziki has more garlic...will definitely try again with the sauce recipe. Served on oven-warm naan bread. Wrapped the bottom in tinfoil to keep the insides in. Delicious!

I tried liking it. The heating time/temperature/setting must be wrong because when I broiled the chicken, the chicken tasted undercooked.

The spices / oil were not flavorful AT all. I wouldn't recommend this recipe. Still looking for something better.

1) The  seasoning tasted so bland.
2) The chicken is UNDERCOOKED at 2-4 minutes in the oven broiler. Seriously? Who wrote this abominable recipe? Stupid beyond measure.
3) I barely ate it. I had to add garlic salt to even finish the meal.

Very good recipe!  We "kicked up" the marinade with a little bit of curry.  It gave it just enough.  Definitely keeping this in the dinner rotation.

I love Greek food and was excited about trying this.  My husband thought it was very good, but, I thought the oregano was a little overwhelming.  All I tasted on the chicken was oregano with little other flavor.   Once on the pita mixed with the other ingredients it did balance out the flavor.

We will be making this again and again! Easier than I would have imagined, so yummy, and fairly healthy. I didn't have a blender so I just finely chopped the cucumber and it was still great, I will try blending next time. Toasting the pita in olive oil was a huge addition!

We've played around with a few different recipes and this one is by far the easiest and tastiest! I like broiling the chicken as I'm super picky about meat being cooked all the way. I love the sauce, although there's always WAY too much of it. And thank goodness for my little bullet-style blender to make the sauce faster :)

Really good and really easy! Used thighs (what I had) and cooked on the stove, and used a food processor for the tzatziki because I didn't want it completely puréed. This will definitely be a regular in the rotation. Will probably halve the tzatziki recipe next time as it makes way more than needed for the meal. Thanks!!

This recipe was pretty good.  We grilled the chicken instead of broiling and put the chicken in the merinade over night.  There was way more tzatziki than needed.  I would half the recipe next time.

This was very good. The chicken was very good and not dry.  I thought the sauce was lacking so I added some feta. The sauce was also thinner than I would have preferred and I have a ton of sauce leftover.  I must have made a mistake but I've rechecked the recipe and believe I used the amount called for of yogurt. I'm curious if this is the same experience others had.

My family loved it! The only thing I did differently was cooked it I'm a pan in a little bit of canola oil- I never trust myself with the broiler! I'm not sure if I diddid something wrong but my sauce was really thin, I did halve it and even so it made a TON of sauce. I am going to use the left over sauce and chicken to make a Greek salad with feta cheese tomatoes and cucumbers. Love a meal I can turn into 2!

This is my go to recipe for chicken gyros. The marinade for the chicken is so delicious! The sauce was good, but I do like the kind I can get at my local restaurant a bit better. Too much dill for my taste, but overall it is a great recipe.

I noticed in some of the other reviews that people weren't marinating the chicken long enough. I marinated mine overnight and the flavor was poppin!! I made the tetziki earlier in the day and let chill. I also used a food processor to get a creamy sauce like consistency. Pretty simple and it was a hit with my kids! Serve with herb pilaf for an easy Greek side.

I tried this today for lunch and it was delicious.  I only marinated for 30mins and it still had lots of flavor.  I added some feta cheese.  So yummy!!!Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great recipe. The sauce, if made as written, is really runny. I would take others advice and either squeeze all the liquid out of the cucumber, or not use a blender. We had to drain it overnight using coffer filters which yielded a great consistency, but is not user friendly. It tastes great though, light and fresh!

Delicious! I butterflied my chicken breasts and cooked on the Foreman grill. I used "sandwich Skinny" whole wheat thin buns and made this as chicken sandwiches. it was messy but good. The marinade itself is a good marinade to use on other ways. The cuke sauce was nice. Felt good to be able to make this and enjoy at home instead of the (unhealthy) hot mess you get at a restaurant or deli.  Good recipe.

This was absolutely excellent. I was craving a refreshing, yet hearty summer dish and this was perfect. The tzatziki sauce was wonderful and very garlic-y, which might not be for everyone. I did the chicken in a fry pan after marinating. I could see where broiler or grill would add to the flavor and texture, but stove top was easier for me. I served it with curried couscous (which could also be added to the pita) and fresh fruit on the side.

Thanks!

I would give this recipe 5 stars were it not for the iceberg lettuce.  IMO iceberg is good for absolutely nothing, and it has no flavor. A romaine, or green or red leaf lettuce does taste good, BUT, traditional gyros do not include lettuce.  It's an American add-on.  I was pleased to see a Tzatziki recipe to use with the dish as opposed to buying it pre-made.

This recipe went almost perfectly for me.  I think 1 lemon may be a little too much for the marinade but I guess it depends on how lemony you like your chicken.  I used a mini food processor so chopping was quick.  I also added less than 1/4th of a medium red onion to the tzatziki.  I broiled the chicken @ 5 minutes on each side and it came out cooked and very tender/juicy.

These were only so-so for us.  I marinated the chicken for several hours and it was still on the bland side.  I did use less oregano than called for, but that's because it can tend to get overpowering (to me), and what I used was as much as I wanted to taste.  However, aside from the oregano, the chicken had little flavor.  The tzatziki was good, I made MUCH less than called for, as I could imagine needing 16 full ounces.  I used about 10 oz of yogurt and I'll still be eating it for DAYS, long after the gyros are gone.  All in all, it wasn't awful, it just wasn't anything spectacular.  Kids didn't dig it, the hubs was gone but I already know that gyros aren't his cup of tea so I probably won't make this one again.  The redeeming quality of this meal was actually the bread - piadina romagnola from this site (made whole wheat ones and they were delicious).
