Delicious!  This is already a family favorite and I only made it once.  I made the cake as directed, except I used homemade apple butter. Other slight changes I made were: 1. I thought the cake was better baked a day ahead as it was easier to cut and it gave it some time for the flavors to blend. 2. I also didn't need to mark out the sides with toothpicks as my pan left and indentation in the cake that was easy to follow with the knife.  3. I would suggest doubling the filling because the amount indicated only provided a very thin layer.  4. In the frosting I reduced the pineapple to 2 oz.  I am glad I did or I would have had some left over and it may not have stuck to the cake as well.  Very good, very moist and a crowd pleaser. Will definitely make again.

If you don't thaw the whipped topping, it doesn't allow it to get fluffy. It's a runny mess.  Next time, I will use THAWED whipped topping for the icing. As is it's a drippy, sloppy mess. It tastes wonderful, but it's for my daughter birthday and i don't even want the thing in any pictures! So five starts for flavor, three stars for directions and appearance. And yes, double the filling!

This was AWESOME. I agree with the others about doubling the filling. I doubled the filling in case I needed extra. I am glad I did, because I used it all. The frosting would not stick to the cake. I decided to keep the frosing in the refrigerator and use it as a topping. I think it worked out better this way, because I don't like putting cakes in the refrigerator. I think refrigerating cakes dries them out. The cake was super moist! I baked it for 50 minutes, and that was almost too long. The edges were a little dark. Overall, it was great. Tasted amazing.

I made this cake last week for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I had to agree with the previous reviewer to double the filling. The one thing I would do different is to try a different frosting. Although the flavor was good, I didn't like the presentation or how it held up. I think that this cake would be wonderful with a cream cheese frosting. I will definately make again.

Positively delicious, & REALLY really moist without being at all dense. I used my own apple pie filling that I had left over from making fried apple pies & also my own homemade applebutter. I thawed the Coolwhip 1st as suggested by another review & used French Vanilla pudding mix. I didn't realize I was out of crushed pineapple at home so I shredded one apple and added to the icing. I would LOVE to try it with the pineapple tho!

OMG, this cake is SO good! I baked the cake in 2 round pans instead of cutting one cake in half. I had home made Apple Butter that a family member bought for me while out of town that I needed to use and this was awesome! Its SUPER moist, even after I left out an egg by mistake. Im making it again for my potluck at work.

This recipe is sooooo awesome!  My hubby has celiac disease, so I used GF cake mix and it still came out as one of the best cakes EVER!  
And I will double the filling next time, it's that good.  Thanks for sharing.
