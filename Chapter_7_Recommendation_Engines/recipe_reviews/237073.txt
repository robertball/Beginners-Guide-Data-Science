Really easy and really good what more could you want from a soup? I've never tasted a Mulligatawny soup before but this one is full-favored yet not over seasoned. A nice new way to enjoy split peas. Thank you Pantaloons for this nice recipe.

Very easy very good! This is a 5-star recipe for me and my family and is the easiest Indian recipe I have. I've learned to double the recipe though! It's great as either a soup or over rice. Not sure I'd call it a mulligatawny but more people should try this! I make with lentils instead of split peas btw and both brown and red lentils are great!

This was good. I'd never had any type of Mulligatawny soup so I wasn't really sure what to expect; I found the combination of flavours a little strange but I think that was more me than the soup. I'd recommend trying this!
