i am greek, and this recipe is not an authentic take on koulourakia.  the consistency is much too sandy, even though i left out 1/4 cup of flour.  also, the butter flavor is too strong.

This recipe was SO easy and delicious.  I worked at a Greek restaurant, and 
these taste just like the owner(Athena) used to make.  I used heavy cream instead
of half and half.  Very easy to twist and shape.  The sesame seeds give it that
extra flavor.

Excellent. My boyfriend is Greek and says that he has had many variations of Koulourakia and this one is one of the best.

Excellent recipe!  My son's 6th grade history class studied Ancient Greece for 4 weeks, 
and had a huge Greek festival to end the unit.  I sent in a double batch of these cookies, and was handed an empty cookie tin at the end of the day.  It's a fast, easy and kid friendly recipe.  Thank you!

I worked for a Greek family and these aren't the traditional style that they made. But the taste is pretty good and unlike some others I didn't have any consistency issues. My batch came out slightly sticky and held up great. I just double the recipe and weighed out 1 ounce pieces then made them into little "snakes," brought one end around and gave it 2 quick twists to hold it together. It may be difficult at first but just keep trying. It's a pretty forgiving dough. If your's came out dry try cutting back a 1/4 c on the flour or add 1-2 tbsp additional cream (I used whole milk with no problems).

I tried to make this recipe and it was very hard to roll into strands and twist. The dough was very crumbly. When I cooked them, 15 minutes was way too long and they were burnt on the bottom. They tasted very dry!

The recipe sounded so easy, but you didn't tell me that it was near to impossible to roll the dough out into strips. After half an hour of rolling the balls only to have them fall-apart and become little peices that don't stick together and crumble - I finally gave-up and tossed the entire mess into the trash. Could it be that there wasn't enough liquids in the recipe to keep it together?

These aren't OVERLY exciting (they taste like a not-very-sweet butter or sugar cookie), but served their purpose well (we were making them for a Greek Night). We had some trouble getting them to brown like in the photo, even when baking for several extra minutes - they stayed white even with the egg wash. A halved recipe made 12. If you have trouble with crumbly dough that can't be rolled like some reviewers mention, just add more half-and-half until you have a pliable dough.

I liked them, not that sweet but soft and delicious all the same!
