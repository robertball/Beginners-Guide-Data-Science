Super yummy smoothie!  I made this for my 15 month old daughter and myself and we both gobbled it up!  I used a frozen mix of berries instead of just frozen strawberries.  And then I used soaked dates instead of honey (because of the potential botulism risk with honey and little ones).  Still came out tasty and we'll add this smoothie to our morning breakfast routine!  

I particularly like this one for toddlers because of the high quantity of healthy fats -- which are so important for developing brains -- and the high protein content from the greek yogurt.  Yet it still appealed to her taste buds...Thanks!!!

Used vanilla Greek yogurt and sub'd wheat germ (it worked well) when I couldn't find my flax seed.  My berries weren't frozen, so I did add some ice to the blender.  Really did taste sort of like strawberry pie, and it also left me feeling full (lots of fiber in this one).  Thanks wisweetp, this one will go into my breakfast smoothie rotation, we really liked it.

It tastes so good and I added chocolate protein powder and it tastes even better!

Great recipe, I used blueberries and peanut butter powder instead of almond butter, Chia seed instead of flaxseed.  But the recipe is endless to the possibilities.  Try it I think you'll love it, the only sweeteners I used were honey and the natural sweet berries.
