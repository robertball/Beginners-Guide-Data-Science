Great for Mediterranean Diet!  Even our daughter who is picky on her vegetables gave a thumbs up to this salad.

I made many changes and maybe this is a different recipe. I left out the onion as one person in my household cannot eat onions. First, I sautéed about half a garlic bulb, two stalks celery, two green peppers, and a carrot. Then I added a large can of diced tomatoes, 1/4 cup red wine/ 1/4 cup vegetable broth, 1/2 bag of frozen chopped spinach, two stalks parsley, a tablespoon of cumin, and half teaspoons of thyme and basil. After an hour of simmering, I added a rinsed can of garbanzo beans and a rinsed can of black beans. I let the whole mixture heat through for 10 minutes and served on a bed of brown rice.

Great recipe as is!..but when I wanted a Tex-Mex flavor to pair with a party we had planned, I changed the lemon to lime and the parsley to cilantro--you can even throw in a jalapeño for extra kick. The flavors were still excellent. A terrific recipe with lots of room to change it up as needed.

I recently made this for a potluck. I got so many compliments on it, it really made my night. that, plus the fact that it's so ridiculously simple and is something that almost everyone can eat no matter how strict their dietary limitations, puts this on my list of favorite potluck recipes.
