I made this for the Thanksgiving dinner that I cooked for my husband's coworkers and it was such a hit that I still get requests for it every time I run into them!  As easy as it is, I can whip it up in no time, but to them, it seems like I went to a lot of trouble.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

I made this late last night before collapsing in bed. I cut it in half only to make one pie but I kept everything else the same. I plan on topping it with the Supreme Strawberry Topping also from this site. I'll update my review after we try this dessert. EDITED: Pretty good. I liked the sour cream against the cheesecake filling, only it was a little rich. I'd make this again. The Supreme Strawberry Topping from this site really took it over the top.

I make this cheesecake in small and large pans... I'm a camp cook and make it for 450 campers! It's awesome! Big or small batches always disappear quickly... one counselor told me it was equal to the invention of electricity in amazing things! Try it.

The cheesecake part is okay, but the topping is basically just sour cream; it doesn't harden at all. I would also reduce the amt. of sugar in both the cheesecake and the topping, but that's just me.

This recipe has been in my family for years! I usually don't use the orange zest but add a bit of vanilla, almond extract, cinnamon or whatever flavor Im in the mood for. I also add a sprinkle of cinnamon and some chopped walnuts, or some drained crushed pineapple on top of the crust before I pour the batter. I get requests for this all the time!

I made this WITHOUT the sour cream topping as I knew I probably wouldn't like it (esp. after reading the reviews). Nice cheesecake, nothing truly special.

Very easy and tasty.  I halved the recipe but kept the lemon zest amount the same.  Next time I will make my own graham cracker crust.
