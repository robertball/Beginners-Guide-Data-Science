Yes, I did make 1 change as did not have the fresh fruit. Used low cal. raspberry jam (1 cup). Maybe would only use 3/4 cup next time but it's very delicious nonetheless.

I did so want to have these turn out well!  The first problem I had is that I do believe these would be better served to make them in an 8x8 pan because there isn't enough of either the topping or the filling to get a good square.  I mixed the raspberries with the other filling ingredients, but I didn't realize I should have mixed it with a mixer until it was well blended, so that could probably be just my error.  When I looked at the filling after putting it onto the baked crust, I tried to mix it up there, so that was another of my errors.  My applesauce was maybe too runny because the filling just made everything soggy.  I love the idea of these, and maybe it is just the way I made them this time.  I'm sorry, Cheerios!  I hope someone will show a photo of how they really should look! I will give them another try!

These were super good!  I could not find oat bran so I subbed wheat bran and it worked out fine. I had to use all of the oat mixture in the bottom of my 9x13- the mixture wouldn't spread the whole way. I also had to add about another 1/2 C applesauce to the filling to have enough for my pan. I made an additional 1/2 serving of topping and baked as suggested. I will make these again.
