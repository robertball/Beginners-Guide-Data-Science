I really love the idea for this but it is SO bland.  Not even salt or pepper, just the sesame oil and garlic to flavor.  Before I finish this off I think I'll mix up some rice vinegar, sriracha, ginger, s&p, and maybe even a little brown sugar and toss it into the mix.  The textures and cook time both get a thumbs up in my book though!
