This was simple to make and delicious; however, it isn't as creamy as most mac & cheese recipes.  We didn't mind that because it was so delicious, but it might be disappointing to others.  I spiced it up by sprinkling a little hot paprika and smoked paprika on top before baking it.  The paprika also added a nice color.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated except I roughly chopped the tomatoes instead of grating.  This a good and different twist to mac and cheese.

I made as a dish for Thanksgiving, and it was a hit! I didn’t use the tomatoes, as per the wife’s preference, but it was still great!

Made 1/2 recipe with 12 oz bacon, assorted cheeses in my fridge. I sauté the bacon, spooned off most of the grease, tossed in the onion, and then Used white Vermouth to deglaze the pan, then  added the tomato and reduced the liquid. Very good!
