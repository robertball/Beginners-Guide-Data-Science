I didn't have any spinach so I cut the almond milk down to 1 cup.  Both my mango and banana were frozen so I omitted the ice cubes.  I used about 1/2" fresh turmeric which I did not bother to grate, I just peeled it  and threw it in with the other ingredients into my Vitamix.  Very tasty.  I can't wait to try this with spinach.

I didn't have any turmeric, so I used a bit of cinnamon instead and it tastes great!
