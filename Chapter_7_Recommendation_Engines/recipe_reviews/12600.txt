Amazing with the following changes:  only 1 scant cup white sugar mixed with the fruit and double the butter to 1/2 cup for the topping (actually, I used Earth Balance since I needed it to be dairy-free).  I also used frozen raspberry/blackberry/blueberry mix with no problem.

I thought this was really quite good, but I think it was way too sweet. I used 2 cups of rhubarb and 3 cups of tart granny smith apples, plus 3 cups of unsweetened frozen mixed berries. Next time I would reduce the sugar by at least 1/2 a cup. Also, and I don't know why, but after 35 minutes the top was *very* brown, even black in some places, and the apples and rhubarb were still a bit crunchy. I scooped the black parts off and it all got gobbled up anyway. Maybe the top got too brown because I substituted margerine? Don't know. Will make this again.

too much sugar; it overpowers the berry flavor. i suggest cutting it back by 1/2 cup.

I made this using 2 c. frozen strawberries, 1 c. frozen raspberries, 1 c. frozen blueberries, and 2 c. apples. I used 1 c. brown sugar for the 2 c. white, and eliminated the cinnamon in the topping. The crisp was too sweet; next time, I think I'll halve the amount of sugar in the fruit mixture. Overall it was delicious, especially with vanilla ice cream. ;)

Very good crisp.  I cup this recipe in half to use an 8X8 pan.  I picked up a winter banana apple from my farmer's market and did not like it just raw, cut up, so I decided to use it in this crisp.  The combination of the apple with the berries and the crumbled oat topping was delicious.  I also had to use frozen berries, but they worked great.  Overall, we really liked this crisp.

I've made this recipe twice this summer, each time with different rhubarb/berry combinations.  It's great every time.  Also low in fat compared to other crisp recipes.

I've made this three times and am making it a fourth this week. I think that it is a beautiful dessert and a low sugar traditional vanilla ice cream or unsweetened whip adds a creamy flavour while not contributing to the sweetness. My family and friends cannot get enough of it!

I heard alot of YUM YUMs when my family ate this. I too, didn't use the called for two cups of white sugar. I cut it in half which made it the perfect amount of sweetness for us. Thank you for sharing such a delightful recipe!

It was delicious but very runny. Cut back on the white sugar or add more cornstarch.

Soooo good!  Made for two summers now, using fruits from my garden and neighborhood.  I follow pretty much as written but usually add extra fruit and a bit more cinnamon.  Hard to beat.

I halved this recipe, and quartered the sugar for the filling, and still found it a little sweet.  A good base recipe, though.  I used blueberries, peaches, strawberries, and rhubarb, all frozen, and the flavor was good, but next time I will let the rhubarb sit for awhile in the sugar mix to get softer.

I also cut back the sugar in the filling to 1 cup but also bumped the butter in the topping up to 1/2 cup.  It may add a few more calories, but the topping is way tastier this way.  Everyone I make this for loves it and wants the recipe!

3 stars for the great fruit combination BUT much too sweet.    I cut sugar in half and even then, for our taste buds, that was way sweet enough.  Otherwise it is fine but had to rate the actual recipe.

I always get raves when I  make this.  It's more healthy, not having alot of butter. I also use whatever fruit I have on hand, or from the garden or freezer. It always turns out great.  I doubt that the recipe would feed 18 though!  More like 6. I like to add walnuts to the crust, also.

I was disappointed because I was looking forward to flavor of rhubarb and it was gone.  But those who thought it was too watery, just cook it longer and it will get as thick as you want.

This tasted great and was devoured by my family in minutes. Gave it 4 out of 5 stars bc we reduced the 2 cups of white sugar to 1 cup of white sugar like the other comments suggested.

This was a great template for me.  I used apples, blackberries and blueberries.  Cut down the sugar to ~1 cup.  Otherwise followed pretty much as written.  I love the versatility of this sort of dish.  Thanks!

The taste is there - the consistency is not. I used rhubarb, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and nectarine as my fruit. May make again - probably will try a different recipe first though.

Delicious using any fruit.  I usually use less than 1 1/2c white sugar.  It just isn't necessary.

This was a delicious combination of fresh fruit...of course, I'm a sucker for a good "crisp"!  I served it warm with ice cream on top...it was to die for!

Makes a very tasty apple/berry/rhubarb crisp, however, I felt there was too much sugar and cornstarch in the fruit mixture.  It did not allow the natural flavors of the fruit to come through and tasted more like a pie filling.

Fruit combo was good...that part tasted great. The topping was chewy and not good at all. Would never use oatmeal in a topping again...too chewy..definitely not a good "crisp" recipe. Will use the fruit recipe with another crumble/crisp topping recipe.

I love using raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, peaches, and apples in here. I often double the topping for extra crunch, and I always half the sugar in with the berries.

I cut in half  both sugars ,and made the crisp sans apples. Also only used 2 TBS of cornstarch.  In addition, kept the crisp in the oven for 50 minutes.  We like desserts like this with a crispy topping.   
Everyone liked it & wanted more. Was especially tasty with Mitchell's vanilla bean ice cream. This recipe is a keeper.

Great recipe to learn and then wing it with various frozen/thawed fruit.  Instant house favorite.  I use less sugar in fruit and topping and more butter in topping.

This was really good, did half the sugar, used a large bag of frozen mixed fruit!  Would definitely make this again!  Maybe half the recipe, it certainly makes a lot!!

Easy to make this gluten-free! I've made this twice so far and love it.  I use fresh apples (we usually have on hand) and frozen fruit (freezer).  The only change is that I substitute the flour for a mix of almond flour and a basic gluten-free flour. I also put in individual ramekins/custard cups. Top with vanilla bean ice cream when still warm from the oven.  Really fresh and homey desert!

I used 3 cups blackberries and 3 lrg Gala apples - good taste combo!  Also cut the white sugar down to 1 1/2 cups. Still a little too sweet for us but overall a lovely recipe.  Will try it again soon.

Way too sweet!!!!!  And topping not very good.  Too bad since it is a nice combination of fruits.

We cut the recipe in half for an 8x8 pan.  We loved it!

After reading the reviews, I cut back on the sugar to 1 cup and am glad I did.  Great desert, will definitely make it again.
