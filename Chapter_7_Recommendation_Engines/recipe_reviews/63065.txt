This was a big hit with my roommates - I don't think I'll have to do dishes for a week! I had to let it simmer for more than a minute and I used real sugar instead of sweetener. I suggest that you put the pie on a baking sheet covered in aluminum foil, because it drips a lot!

I love homemade apple pie but this one beats the ordinary.  It isn't as sweet and has a wonderful flavor.  I got many compliments and everyone asked for the recipe.  It will definately be on the menu this Thanksgiving and Christmas

This is a tart pie. It is an excellent choice for a change from the oridinary apple pie.  Next time I will use a sweeter apple than the Granny Smith I used this time. I got raves from my mother-in-law who asked for the recipe.
