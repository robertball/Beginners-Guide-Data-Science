This is a delicious recipe!  I will definitely make it again! I didn't have the cereal it called for so I substituted it for All-Bran cereal and added raisins.  It came out great!

This was a very moist and sweet tasting bread.  I made the recipe into muffins. I substituted whole wheat flour, raisin bran cereal, and added cinnamon.  I also used three very ripe bananas.  It was a big hit at work with the girls.  I definately will make them again.

Delicious! Moist! The recipe deserves a blue ribbon. What a great way to use up all those old bananas in my frig. Today was the first time I used this recipe. My taste buds are still talking ... "More, More." I had three pieces before I called a halt to this new eating habit (and I might eat one piece before bedtime). I made ONE CHANGE to the recipe since I had no raisin nut bran cereal. I substituted it with 1-3/4 cup of raisin bran cereal and 1/4 cup of chopped pecan nuts. I will make more loaves and freeze them, air-sealing with two layers of plastic wrap then one layer of aluminum foil. If my family and I don't eat them all before month's end, I'll pass onto neighbors and friends. Try the recipe; you won't be disappointed. Thanks, Scrubb, for sharing it with us.

This came out wonderfully!  Rather than 1-1/2 cups regular flour, I used 3/4 cups of whole wheat flour and 3/4 cups regular flour.  I also added extra raisins, some walnuts and cinnamon.  Once I poured the mixture in the pan, I sprinkled some white & brown sugar on top with some additional walnuts.  I think the next time I make this, I will put the mixture into muffin tins.  I love it!  Thanks!

How interesting that my bread looks nothing like the picture shown! I really like this bread. I made a recipe almost similar to this years ago and was looking for something close. I read some of the reviews and let my cereal and milk soak for about ten minutes or so, so it would be a little mushier. I also added about a half cup of organic raisins and a tsp. of vanilla. I'm so glad to have this recipe again. The person I'm gifting this to is going to love it. This is a chewier quick bread. NOTE: If you add raisins like me and want them to be a little plumper, soak them in hot juice/water/soda for about 20 minutes. You'll have a fatter raisin and a little fruitier flavor to your loaf.

Nice twist on your average banana nut bread. I used Raisin Bran Crunch in this recipe. I also added another 1/2 c. of raisins(because isn't Raisin Bran a little skimpy with the raisins?),a 1/2 c. Craisins and a tsp. of vanilla extract. Baked up dark, so I covered it with foil halfway through. No complaints. Very tasty and hearty banana bread.

yummy! almost can't stay away. too sweet for my healthy tongue (next time I'll reduce the sugar even more). good with whole wheat flour. I used regular Post raisin bran cereal. I substituted 1/4 c flax seed meal for equal portion of flour, added raisins and walnuts and cinnamon, and reduced the sugar to 1/2 C.+ raw sugar. Sorry guys, I find it really hard to bake some things without putting my own spin on it :)

So yummy and moist.  You really can't tell that there is cereal in it.  I used All Bran and mixed in my own raisins.

This is a nice, easy recipe that yields great results. It has a good texture, and the raisins are a unique but appreciated addition to re bread. I did tweak the recipe and substituted the all-purpose flour with wheat flour. Next time I make this recipe I want to add a little cinnamon. In general, it was quite good.

Wonderful. Last night I made one "regular" loaf (using raisin bran), then decided I needed a second and added 1 t cinnamon and 1/3 c chocolat chips with chip on top also. I took it to work and everyone wanted the recipe. Very moist and not too much fat :) I recommend highly. I cooked the full time plus a few minutes.

Very tough crumb in spite of using buttermilk which softens the crumbs.  Requires too much beating which creates too much gluten.  Flavor good though.  Too healthy for kids to like!

I was honestly surprised this tasted so awesome! I thought for sure I would see cereal flakes, but you would never know it's in there. I used Raisin Bran Crunch, but it seems like a perfect way to use up any cereal in your house. I also added a dash of cinnamon and a dash of cloves. Perfect with my morning cup of coffee!

I ended up using Grape Nuts cereal with a bit of raisins added to it because it was either that, cheerios, or mini wheats; I figured it would be the best to use.  Following the recipe exactly, except with a little less oil, I had myself a delicious loaf in about 40 minutes. I used a bundt pan because for some reason I ALWAYS use a bundt pan, and the flavor was delicious.  My only complaint would be that my loaf of extremely crumbly, but masha says it's because the cereal I used was like rock-hard rabbit food in the beginning. Next time I'll use a more absorbent cereal. :) But after sticking it in the fridge, the taste and texture just got better and better. This IS quite good.

Good twist on the old banana bread. I ended up baking this for 62 minutes in the end as the middle just wouldn't cook. After all that, the outside was a bit chewier than I would have preferred, although the middle tasted great. I did use Basic 4 cereal since that's what I had on hand with flakes and raising (and nuts and dates, which were also nice).

I loved this recipe. I changed a few things though; I used 1c oatmeal in replace of the cereal and instead of using both white and brown sugar, I used a total of 2/3c brown sugar. I also added some crushed almonds and a little extra banana. It was great.

4 1/2 stars!  This was quite good!  I made it as muffins (bake time = 18 minutes) and they were great for breakfast!  Very filling and solid, not overly sweet.  :)  Many went back for seconds.  I would recommend cinnamon.  I may also try it again and omit raisins but add chocolate chips.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Easy recipe - but had to use 3 bowls. I added oat bran in with the raisin bran to soak...Remember to add a little more milk too. Chopped walnuts were added also.  I made mini-muffins, topped each with a little sprinkle of brown sugar and baked till golden brown.  Everyone likes them...at least as much as you can like bran muffins :) - definately give this one a try...kids will probably like them.  They're in the freezer now.  I plan to sprinkle with powdered sugar and add to a tray of assorted cookies for a few parties coming up.

I liked the bran cereal in the bread but my first bite indicated the 3 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1 teaspoon of baking soda was too much for this recipie.  I've seen recipes of similar quantities with no more than 1.5 teaspoons of baking soda and powder combined.  Using fresh baking soda, I got a rather dry, salty taste.

i have made this recipe twice as muffins and they are very good! i used all-bran cereal, raisins and walnuts in place of the raisin bran cereal and cut back the white sugar to 1/4 cup. the recipe makes a perfect dozen muffins and only needs to be cooked 30 minutes as muffins. will definitely make again.

Delicious! I turned it into muffins and added a bit of peanut butter, too. They were great! Thanks!

Good flavor, but the crust was somewhat tough.

My kids liked this! Instead of using raisin bran, I used Trader Joe's pumpkin granola and I added additional brown sugar and raisins. The effect was nice, the color and flavor very good.

I fell asleep & almost didn't get any, because my hubby almost ate it all! I did add a bit of pecans & choc. chips. I don't bake often, but I will bake this again!

Followed recipe exactly and it turned out very good.  What a great way to get some much needed fiber into your diet.  I will add a few extra raisins next time, as some of the others mentioned, some brands of raisin bran do lack in that area.  Will definitely make again!
