2.21.17   This reminded me so much of stuffing, I kept yearning for additional spices.  It was a very simple side dish to make and took no prep time at all.  I baked in small ramekins, ended up with three, but it baked up just a bit on the dry side.  If I make this again, I’ll probably add some chicken broth in addition to some additional spices.  There’s enough sharpness from the cheese, and although we all have different taste preferences,  I found the overall flavor overall just a little one note (marjoram).   This is a new recipe, and I don’t want to discourage others from trying, but for me, it’ll need a little tweaking.
