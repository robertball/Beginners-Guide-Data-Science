I usually use brown sugar and skip the baking soda when I make these.  Be sure to let these cool on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack, or they may fall apart.

I needed a quick, easy dessert recipe for my mom who is allergic to gluten. Wow, did I come across the perfect recipe!  I agree, you do have to love peanut butter as it is very rich.  I read others saying it fell apart on them, but what I did is mix the ingredients in the morning, put the batter in the fridge and when I got home that evening, I baked them.  I also used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar which I think gives it a better consistency.  They came out perfect little (slight) mounds.  They do need to be rolled into small balls, about 3/4".  I've made this recipe a few times now and what I do if I don't want to bake all of them, is keep them in an airtight container and just bake as I want them. I've kept the batter in the fridge for as long as a week.  This is the PERFECT easy, gluten free cookie!

I followed this recipe exactly and was very disappointed with the outcome.  I agree with the other person who said they were so peanut buttery she had to drink a whole glass of water after eating one.  Eating one of these cookies was the equivalent to eating a spoon of peanut butter!!!  They were also dry and crumbly..  I won't make this recipe again.  I am a peanut butter cookie connoisseur and would much rather take a little extra time and make a cookie that tastes great..

I used the exact ingredients cited in the recipe. I chilled the dough for about an hour, making it easy to roll into balls.  I rolled the dough into 1" balls and then flattened each with criss-cross fork strokes.  I believe that cookie size is critically important to this recipe.  The recipe states it will make 3 doz. which it easily does with a smaller size.  Flourless cookies are very rich cookies, and require a scaled back portion. (It is similar to the reduced portion size for flourless chocolate cake compared to traditional chocolate cake.) The cookies baked up nicely in about 8 min. The result was a golden brown, crispy petite peanut butter cookie.  Thanks Vicki.

VERY peanut-buttery!

I suggest to add about 1/8 - 1/4th cup flour, it helps the cookie harden and not be so limp.

I made sure to shape the cookies in a round ball the SECOND time otherwise they won't turn out into a perfect cookie circle.

The last suggestion I have is to let them cool for 10-15 minutes.

Making these minor adjustments helped me out a lot!

Excellent!  I used Adams Crunchy Peanut Butter.  Rolled half the recipe in balls, they came out round & moist... drizzled those with melted chocolate.  Added chocolate chips to the other half of the recipe.  Also rolled in balls, but while still moist, those came out flatter and crisper.  YUM!  Definite keeper!

I think some people are missing the beauty of this recipe...THERE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE FLOUR! These are great cookie for those suffering from Celiac Disease or those who have gluten sensitivities in general. Many people can't tolerate regular flour, so these are a great alternative. Are they the best peanut butter cookies ever? No, definitely not, but they are delicious for what they are, most people have these ingredients on hand, and they are really easy to make. As far as cook time goes, I would follow the directions on the recipe...I like ooey gooey soft cookies, and I had to cook these above the 8 minutes. I would check them at 8 minutes and see how they are. Mine didn't even brown on the bottom at all and they were in the oven for at least 10 minutes. Everyone's oven is different, so I would recommend following the instructions if it's your first time making them.

Kids love these!  So easy even my husband can make them (and he does an excellent job).  He usually adds a 1/2 bag of peanut butter chips to make them even more peanut buttery.  One trick is to cook the cookies in the ball shape and THEN criss-cross smash them after you have removed them from the oven so they don't crumble!

excellent! I made  1/3 of this recipe (beat the egg and only added 1/3 of the mixture) and added about a tablespoon of flour to make it easier to shape into balls. I also added a few dashes of cinnamon. Crispy outside chewy inside...best PBC's I've can remember having!

I love to cook, but baking is my least favorite thing to do :) so finding an easy peanut butter cookie recipe fit the bill!  After reading numerous reviews, I did half white, half brown sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla, 2 tblsp. of flour and 1 1/2 tblsp. of butter.  These are definitely a keeper!

I love this quick & simple recipe. I added 1 tsp of vanilla and about 1/4 cup quick cook oats for extra fibre and texture. Depending on the size of the egg I may add more or less to achieve the right consistency. If it gets too crumbly; simply add a bit more PB. I use the traditional roll into balls and press lightly with a fork dipped in white sugar. Like most recipes, it`s important to pay attention to the food and common sense and make adjustments to get the `perfect consistency & the perfect PBC`  =)

I was expecting less. But these are great and only 1 point on Weight Watchers. So fast and easy, I used splenda instead of sugar and they turned out good.

I must have done something wrong...although I don't know how! My cookies turned out sooo mushy that I when I tried to get them off the pan they smooshed up. I really enjoyed the strong peanut butter flavour when I ate the crumbly pieces.

It was 48 minutes ago that I first saw this recipe. Right now, the cookies are sitting in front of me and the dishes have been hand-washed. I hope it's okay to review them even though I made absolutely no chages or substitutions, but these are probably the best tasting PB cookies I have ever had. My only criticism would be the delicacy of the final resulting cookie. If handled very gently, they do stay together, but don't toss one of these to the kids at the table! Thanks for a really good recipe, Vicki Douglas!

ok - I changed this a lot....but it was really good!  I used NATURAL peanut butter, without sugar and dark brown sugar (no white at all) and I added 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 1 cup of semi sweet Ghiradelli chocolate chips. REALLY good cookies and a little healthier than they were before!

I use a natural crunchy peanut butter, the kind that has only peanuts and salt on the ingredient label. I can see how some people would find them too rich if they'd used something more processed (they add sugar to most peanut butters). I roll them up real small, maybe around the size of a teaspoon. The more I made them the more I realized smaller comes out better. It's also better not to flatten them with a fork, they'll do that on their own in the oven. When they're done cooking you have to let them sit on the cookie sheet for at least ten minutes before you ever touch them. Otherwise they just come apart or mush. After learning all those little things this recipe is the best peanut butter cookie ever. The trial and error was fun to figure out and I won't be looking for another peanut butter cookie recipe ever again.

I made these for a friend with Celiac. My kids were very curious what smelled so good-isaid gluten free peanut butter cookies. Of course calling them "free" anything was immediately followed by "ewwww" but they couldn't stand to not try one because of how good the looked and smelled. Needless to say I had to make another batch to bring to my friend because the gobbled them all up! Absolutely simple and delicious for ANYONE! Did half white/half brown sugar

I'm not sure how to rate these because I changed the recipe, but I don't think they would have been as good. I used natural peanut butter which is much more dry than the regular stuff, so I added an extra egg. 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white, and 1/2 C. gluten free flour mix (made from white rice flour, tapioca flour, and corn starch), a pinch of salt and no soda. I rolled them into balls, flattened with fork, and popped them in a 350 oven for 10 minutes. They're not bad, and they're quick to make. I think next time I'll try making them with butter and more flour like I normally do.

I am of mixed feelings about these. They're very simple, which I appreciate. They're also gluten free which I appreciate even more. They even tasted pretty good- my family raved about them.
BUT. They are pretty ugly looking and hard to handle. For one thing, mine did not turn out looking like the pretty ones in the picture. They were flat and did not hold together well. They were also almost too moist and chewy.
I am a pretty advanced baker but I am willing to admit the problem may have been user error. I arrived late to the farmers market and all they had were medium eggs, so I added a bit of milk to the cookies to keep the batter together. Perhaps that was my mistake. I will definitely try again, though. Thanks!

These cookies are melt in your mouth delicious!!!!! I've eaten four already and they're not even cooled yet! However, there is absolutely, positively no need for a whole cup of sugar in this recipe. I used a half cup of brown sugar and trust me, it was plenty! I also added a tsp. of vanilla and a tablespoon of flour. With the sugar reduction, peanut butter cookies just don't get much better than these. Thank you Vicki!

Not bad at all for the simple ingredients used. i did use Kirkland organic peanut butter (not as sweet as Jiff)  Going from what other reviews said I added 2 tbsp of flour, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/2 cup sugar, and 1 1/2 tbsp of room temp butter. Use a small fork to press down on balls to give that traditional look. Used parchment paper on cookie sheet and slid right off to let cookies cool on paper. Easy, fast, and tasty!

My husband loves peanut butter and these were a hit! He said a perfect 10. Although I did use 1/2 C. sugar and 1/2 C. brown sugar, skipped the baking soda and added 1 tsp. vanilla! You have to double the recipe, but Its a keeper for sure if your a peanut butter lover!

Very worthwhile as a quick "whoops, need cookies!" recipe. Whipped it up in no time flat. Reading the reviews, I lowered the temp to 350 and they came out nice without burning. I used crunchy peanut butter, not because of cooking flair but because it was all I had... I'd do it again, it gives a nice texture to the cookie.

I use this recipe to make cookies for my husband. PB is his favorite! He has told me that these cookies are the best he's ever had. I will add though that I add choc chips when I make them.

They are easy to make and taste great! But, I would agree to add a small amount of flour to add some firmness to them. I will always make my peanut butter cookies this way.

These are a huge hit in our family. I've made them for a gluten-free friend, but we enjoy them for ourselves as well. Here are my tips: Use chunky PB (store brand is fine). Use only 1/2 cup of sugar, but use brown sugar. Cream these before adding a beaten, extra large egg. After a few seconds the batter gets very stiff. Sprinkle over the baking soda and mix it in by hand. I also add ~1/2 c. MINI CHOCOLATE CHIPS. Quickly shape the balls with a small cookie scoop, trying to pack it in well before releasing it. Place on parchment or a silicon mat. Press each ball with a fork (fixing crumbly edges if necessary). These baked up in 8-9 minutes. I don't try to move them off the cookie sheet until they are almost cool. Enjoy!

I tried this recipe but used 1/2 cup of each brown and white sugar. I also added about 1/4 cup of flour as I found it too wet witout the flour. I am not sure if this was because I used whipped peanut butter or not.  My kids and hubby loved them!!!

These were awesome!  Considering there are only four ingredients!  The only thing I did differently is rolled the cookie dough balls in sugar, and pressed a fork onto them to smush them down a bit before baking.  The sugar helped keep them together and gave them a little coating on them... and it wasn't too sweet.  I also only cooked them 4-5 minutes, so they they were moist inside.  People who say this recipe sucked didn't cook them right... cause this is a really good cookie recipe!

These cookies were a-w-e-s-o-m-e! I did put the dough in the refirgerator for half hour or so before baking and also baked them for a few minutes, then pressed them down with a fork, and baked about 8-10 minutes longer. Great recipe!

A good cookie to make if you are in a big rush like I was but the taste was not that great. It just tasted like peanut butter with extra sugar in it. I could still feel the sugar granules when i was eating them which I hated. Not the best pbc recipe however if i need cookies really quick again i might try one more time with brown sugar instead of white

I made this once before and it was too crumbly. This time I took others' advice to make the balls small, and added a few teaspoons of flour (and I halved the recipe but still used a whole egg).  I also used some brown sugar in it. Baked for 8 minutes, they came out so good, very moist, not falling apart at all.   Yum!

I prefer our standard, flour-based peanut butter cookie recipe, but this was much, much better than I anticipated.  Great if you only have a little time, or have only a few ingredients, or are serving guests with gluten allergies!  Not the best peanut butter cookie ever, but quite tasty and very, very easy.

These are yummy and quick -- perfect if you want to make a last-minute treat.  Next time I'll leave out the baking soda though.  It gave the cookies a slightly bitter taste, and I'm not sure what its purpose is in this recipe.  There are other recipes for the same cookies using only the first three ingredients.

I was happy to see that there was a four item recipe for pb cookies. Made them. They are just discs of super sweet peanut butter. I had to bake them for an additional ten minutes to resemble cookies when cooled.  Scrapped them and made a batch from the old Kraft recipe to smooth things over.

I added some peanuts to mine. The dough was too soft to roll into balls so I just dropped by teaspoons onto the baking sheet and they flattened out nicely. Love this recipe because there is no flour in them - I am diabetic. Thanks!

My daughter is making easter baskets for her friends for Easter but one of them is on strict diet due to medical problems. I made these for her to have a sweet treat like everyone else and they turned out great! I did chill the dough for few minutes in the freezer and  changed is the length of time they were in the oven(10 min or so). I ALWAYS use parchment paper when baking to prevent burning and then clean up is a breeze!

This recipe was extremely easy. I thought that they were a little too oily and were hard to eat without chugging a glass of water. I made them for my gluten intolerant step-mom; she loved them! I plan on baking these again because of the simplicity!

I only had a scant 1/2 cup of peanut butter, a mix of regular Skippy and mostly Adam's natural chunky.  I only added 1/3 C brown sugar, 1 egg, and 1/2 tsp of aluminum free baking soda.  It seemed a bit runny, so I decided to spoon a generous rounded teaspoon of batter into shiny aluminum tart pans that were round and 2cm deep by 6 cm circumference. Sprayed the empty tart pans with cooking oil first.  Sprinkled granulated white sugar on top of the cookie batter.  Baked on convection setting 160 C for 11 min. They may have been able to handle 12 min to crisp the bottoms a bit better.   They turned golden brown, at first puffed up and filled the tart pan nicely, and then started to sink in the middle.  Sank a bit more when taken out of the oven, but looked like a cute shallow cup shape.  I let them cool in the pans for a good long time.  Then loosened the edges with a knife and they came out great.  I admit, I kind of sank when I saw them sink, but then got the idea to pipe a small amount of some good quality jam in the center, I used rasberry, and then drizzled melted semisweet chocolate over the tops. Very fun looking and tasty.   Instead of chocolate drizzle you could dust the tops with powder sugar when completely cooled. These were great. The scant 1/2 recipe only made 11 cookies. As the consistency was a bit cake-like, but crisp on the edges (even without flour) you could actually use a little less than 1 generous tsp of batter per cookie and probably be even better. (If l

I was sceptical at 1st.("no flour" they won't be good), but I needed a "gluten free" recipe to make for a friends' birthday treat!  She loved them!  Of course I saved a few and my husand and son really thought they were great too! I doubled the recipe...put a batch in a mini muffin tin...came out nice and chewy, and perfectly round.  I will make these again...of course, I will add choc. chips as well.

Looked up this recipe, made the cookies, cooled them and then ate one in 45! My boyfriend and I were craving something sweet and we didn't have much in the house, so that is how I found this recipe. The cookies are yummy! I like a thinner, more moist cookie. I added a little splash of vanilla extract too and baked for 9 minutes total. After baking I threw the cookie sheet in the freezer and left the cookies there for about 5 minutes. When I took them out they were ready to eat! Definitely worth making, so fast and east!

Very good and so easy to make. I added a couple extra ingredients so the dough is easier to handle and for a firmer cookie. 1/4 cup Flour & 1 tea. Vanilla and used chunky peanut butter.... Just the perfect touch! Also if you want a more cooked center bake for 10 min.

These are good in a pinch, but they came out with a weird texture. It felt like they were dry, even though they were soft.

I thought these cookies were great! They were soft and chewy. I added a 1/2 a cup of chocolate chips to it for the chocolate peanut butter taste, but I'm sure they would be just as delicious without them. Just a warning, though, be sure to give the cookies a couple of minutes to cool before removing them from the tray.

I'm new to gluten free baking.  These cookies are better than their flour counterpart!  The directions do not mention when to make the fork marks.  I marked before baking with one set and then tried the last minute of baking for another set.  Either works.  I also used 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar.  

I'd also suggest making the dough and refrigerating for a couple of hours before rolling into balls.  Gluten free recipes seem easy to crumble so the refrigeration helps.  I did not rate this a five only because one batch does not make very many cookies.  I did not get the 36 as the recipe indicates.  

Definitely worth trying.  Yummy!

I have made these cookies for as long as I can remember! This is great recipe to make with kids, super easy and fun for them to be able to help. I've never used baking soda in mine, though. Just peanut butter, sugar, and an egg and they always come out delicious! The only thing I add (and this may have just been something my mom did to make it fun for me as a kid) is after forming the dough into a ball shape, we would roll them in a bowl of sugar :) then do the criss cross pattern with a fork. You can also add chocolate chips to the top for an extra yummy cookie!

I have used this recipe for about 30 years without the baking soda.  The Cub Scouts used to "forget" the cookie pail so I would have to bake up a batch of these for the meeting.  I am trying to figure out what the critic who said they were dry and crumbly did.  Maybe used non-homogenized PB?  But yes, each one is about like eating a spoonful of peanut butter.  Perfect!  Why would a self-proclaimed PB cookie connoiseur complain about that?

If your looking for the 'Best Ever' peanut butter cookie this recipe is not for you. BUT if your looking for a 'Great' flourless peanut butter cookie this is it! Both my 5 and 8 year old daughters were recently put on a gluten free diet. I love that I can still make them treats with out the expense of gluten free baking mixes. I used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I pulsed the two together in the food processor before adding the the egg and pb. I froze half the cookie dough for later use! Thanks for a quick and tasty dessert!
Update: I used the defrosted frozen dough and increased the bake time to 12 minutes and they came out perfect! With the extra bake time they were better than a "normal" pb cookie!!!

These were quick and easy, just like the recipe says. I used half brown sugar and half white, like some others had suggested, and I think that was better. They were VERY sugary for me. I don't think they had too much peanut butter... I made them the suggested size and they were perfectly fine. I think I will put a little less sugar in next time...

 2nd time making these cookies.  this time I used Brown sugar instead of white, reduced the baking powder to 1/2 tsp and added 1/4 cup of flour.  Turned out excellent ..once again.. maybe a lil better.  great recipe! Thank You!

I made three batches of these cookies (one just white sugar, one half and half and the other just brown sugar) All three turned out perfectly!!!! However, my husband and I perfered the just brown sugar one. (Thanks to one of the reviews) I now can make these for my mom who is allergic to gluten, and I'm reducing my gluten intake for heath reasons! This is perfect for us since our favourite cookies are peanut butter.

Made these for Fathers Day. They are very peanutbuttery ! Don't try to remove them from the cookie sheet until completely cooled if not they will fall apart. Also do add the 1/4 cups of flour with these two tips my dad said they were good didn't even share with the grandkids LOL !

These can be made allergen free! They work well with sun butter in place of peanut butter, and 1tbl ground flax + 3tbs water to replace the egg.

I made some adjustments and it was delicious. I used 1 cup peanut butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 egg, 1 tsp baking soda and a dash of salt.  They were delicious!! I used crunchy peanut butter because i LOVE peanut butter.  Super easy and quick recipe.  I will definitely use it again.  Thanks!

A chewy and crispy treat! but mostly for PB LOVERS! i had to make it for my class, me and my friends had to bring in cookies for christmas so for a change i used peanut butter rather then the original icing filled sugar cookies! it was really nice and easy to make but be warned you have to be precise when taking them out or else theyll burn as that happened to my first few! my class mates and even my teacher LOVED it!

OMG these are fantastic. I made it their way the first time then the second I added just a bit of flour. Very chewy!! Added some chocolate chips. Super easy to make. This is now a staple in our house!

I changed the 1 cup of sugar to 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, and I also added 1/4 cup milk chocolate chips. They turned out AMAZING! Every one in my house LOVED them with the chocolate chips. There were enough to add a little more flavor, but few enough to still take like peanut butter cookies =)

These are THE BEST!!!  So peanut-buttery and sweet!  I've done them plain, and also with mini-chocolate chips.  After rolling them into balls, I press them down with the back of a tablespoon to make a wells and fill them up with min-chocolate chips.  They are SO good.  This is my favorite PB cookie recipe!

Super Rich!! Turned out perfect. I needed to bake mine for about 10 min, but they were just a tiny bit bigger than 1 inch. I was only able to  make about 32 cookies. Not a huge hit at my house, but a good cookie none-the-less.

I made these for my family they all LOVED them! My dad coud not believe there was no flour whatsoever in them!



Note: If you have a gas stove and you put it for the amount of time it calls for the ones in the back will be perfect and the ones in the front will be a little bit soggy.

These are delicious, easy cookies.  I made them with crunchy peanut butter and didn't use baking soda and they came out amazing.  Everyone in my dorm absolutely raved about them and couldn't believe it when I told them that they didn't have flour in them.

I have to say although these were edible they were not very good. I make a different cookie recipe each week, this one was my least favorite so far. I also found they stick to your teeth. The short list of ingredients appealed to me but was not worth it in the end. This one may be for those who can eat peanut butter by itself out of a jar!...lol....just didn't enjoy it.
Thank you for the recipe anyway :-)

This was NOT a good recipe for cookies.  I rolled them into the balls as the recipe directed and they never flattened. So next round I flattened them but you could still taste the sugar granules.  It just wasn't good. I was very disappointed.

Great cookie!!  I was really apprehensive about how the dough looked, even though it was VERY easy to work with (no refrigeration needed).  I made these cookies in about 15 minutes- start to finish.  The taste and texture was great, and the simplicity of this recipe made it a keeper for sure.  I added some semi-sweet choc. chips just for the heck of it.  They came out very tasty, next time I think I'll use real milk chocolate chips.  Give this recipe a try!

Yum! Quick pb cookie fix! Followed directions. Cooked for 8 minutes. Kept them as round balls going into the oven, as soon as they came out a added 3 chocolate chips and pushed down lightly. Had that pretty cracked look. Slight crisp outside, soft inside.

Perfectly peanutty!
I found the negative reviews of this recipe to be hilarious! "Too sweet"  "Tastes too much like peanut butter" - as if one were expecting a recipe for peanut butter cookies to magically produce table water crackers!
These are fabulous.  I use a small cookie scoop, and then flatten the balls with a sugared glass.  I bake them on a silpat and let them cool at least 15 minutes before very carefully removing them to a cooling rack.
They turn out crisp and perfect every time.

These are so easy and fast.  Usually, I make them large and end up with a dozen...11 or 12 minutes at 350 degrees in my oven.  They are rich and filling, chewy and crispy this way.  A bit less sugar than called for is good for me...3/4 cup or less.  They have to cool a little while before you can pick them up and have them stay together well, but they do just fine after some cooling. They get soggy the next day, so I just rebake them for a few minutes and I think they're even better.  Tonight I made them small and put jumbo chocolate chips in them...I had sixteen cookies and probably close to half the batter left in the fridge.  They're quite good, but I like the other way best.  I still ended up baking them 11 to 12 minutes.  But they do cool more quickly when they're small.

I am a University student in the middle of finals who's short on time so these cookies were perfect! I brought them home on the weekend for my siblings and my younger brother insisted I make another batch tonight. This time I used crunchy peanut butter and added SKOR chips and they turned out beautifully! This is my new "go to " peanut butter cookie recipe.

I think this cookie is great, yes it is peanut buttery as some have said but I guess that's because there is peanut butter in them, and they are sweet also due to the sugar.I think they are a quickly made, wholesome, cookie that is yummy!!! they will crumble if you pick them up while too warm let them cool then they crisp up and are perfect.

I used splenda instead of sugar, which made them even more frail, but they were otherwise simple and good.

Wow! When I first saw this recipe I thought I should try them out so if I need something sweet, fast, I can just make these. People complain they are mushy and falling appart but cooking them longer prevents that and they only have to cool for about 2 minutes. I cook them for 15-20 minutes and they still wont look done but when you pull them out and they cool, they will be some of the best cookies you've ever tasted! Not as quick as promised but just as good and tasty!

these were so simple to make, very kid friendly in the kitchen! Delicious as well, they are a bit crumbly as mentioned by others. I don't see it as a bad thing though! I love, love this recipe! Thank you so much for sharing.

Excellent pb cookies.  Hubby said they were the best he's ever had.  I did half white sugar, half brown sugar.  If you keep them the exact size specified, they won't get too crumbly.  But, GF generally means crumbly anyway!

I searched for PB cookies because I was really wanting some but i didn't have butter or brown sugar so this recipe looked like a winner. it was easy to make but I had to bake the cookies for 18 minutes instead of 6-8. They still came out gooey and falling apart and the texture was weird. Next time i would probably use some flour or just wait until I have the ingredients for another recipe.

I was in denial that you could make a cookie with so few ingredients, but alas it has happened! These are very tastey and chewy. As some reviews suggested I added 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown, I also added a handful of rolled oats just to try it out. Worked fine and next time I might even add two handfuls! 
Thanks!

Love this Recipe they are the easiest yummiest PB cookies ever, I used Kraft PB and cut the sugar back to half a cup. The key is to let them cool before moving them otherwise you will have a mushy mess.

I just made these and have the second cookie sheet in the oven as I write this.  I have a dinner with a friend who is gluten intolerant and am bringing dessert.  Although I prefer regular peanut butter cookies, these are good and I know he will love them.  I will try it with brown sugar next time

I'm just a beginner, and this made up so easy and is the best peanut butter cookies I've ever made. Thank you for the recipe. Oh, I had to adjust my oven heat down 25 degrees and bake an extra 7 minutes.

This recipe, together with the advice of chilling the dough and criss-crossing to spread the dough by smaller bits, is extremely quick and easy. Personally, I think the PB made the cookies too rich, but they were still appealing and stomach-filling. Great to eat with a light drink, or tea to help the digestion!

WOW!! What an amazing cookie this recipe makes! I took the advice of some reviewers and put the batter into the fridge for a 1/2 hour before rolling into balls and it was easy to work with. I also used brown instead of white sugar and it turned out fantastic! This is the only peanut butter cookie recipe I will ever make! Thanks so much!

These PB Cookies were tasty. I did add a bit of Vanilla to the mix and I left the Cookies in the Oven 3 minutes longer. The end results: Medium Brown in Color and a Light Crispy taste to them. Amazing! Will make again soon!

I love this recipe! I tweek it a bit though just for some added flavor. I use 1/2 cup each of both white sugar and dark brown sugar. Then i add a handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Always turns out yummy. I can't keep them away from my husband!

Awesome recipe!! I added brown sugar instead of regular sugar and put the mix before the peanut butter in the fridge for 20 min. Then I added the peanut butter and a dab of chocolate syrup. It was perfect!

These are my favorite peanut butter cookies! I've made them dozens of times. Tonight, I threw in a handful of chocolate chips, a dash of vanilla and a little flour (maybe 1/8 cup?) so they'll roll more easily. Thanks for sharing, Vicki!

Love these!
Highly recommend adding 1/8 c. flour and chilling before you bake these -- as others have said in their reviews. 

Not sure why some people have trouble with this recipe turning out. Perhaps they aren't following the basic order for cookies? (egg and sugar 1st, then PB, then dry ingredients)

They don't look done at 9 minutes, but they are. Take them out!

I tried adding chocolate chips to half of the batch and it only dried out the cookies. The PB is such a strong flavor that you can't taste the chocolate chips.

As someone else mentioned, these are the cookie equivalent of flourless cake (which I love). So they are rich and dense and full of flavor! Don't expect the typical giant, dry, crispy, mild PB cookie. These are for real PB lovers!

These were a bit of a disaster.  I used all the tips...I chilled the dough, I made the balls very small, I pressed the criss-cross after they were baked (still stuck to the fork and caused the whole cookie to fall apart), I left to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes (then 10 for the next batch).  They still fell apart no matter what.  I finally added almost a cup of flour and kneeded it into the dough and they held together.  But they are a very dense cookie now.  They only reason I gave 2 stars instead of one is that they at least tasted good.  I won't be making these again.

I love this recipe. In college it was my term-paper-writing tradition to stop halfway through a long night of writing and whip some up. I would throw in a generous amount of salt (1/2-1 tsp?) sometimes and cut back the sugar and it would be a sweet-and-salty treat. I'd also make them just nickel-sized so I could pop them in my mouth all evening.

Easy, delicious,
Just make sure you wait for them to cool to set before moving them off the cookie sheet.
We used half brown sugar too.

These are okay, in my opinion. They aren't much of a cookie and fall more along the lines of peanut butter fudge--in texture, at least.

This was a very quick and easy recipe which deserves 5 stars!! I'm new to the world of making things from scratch and appreciate that there weren't too many ingredients for me to mess up anything ;). These cookies baked wonderfully and looked very pretty when done. The only reason I gave 3 stars was because it wasn't a moist cookie. You need to have a drink near by while eating these.

Excellent! I added 2 tbsp flour just to thicken batter a bit. I have always found peanut butter cookies too cakey and these aren't at all! My 3 year old can't get enough. Will be making them to give as gifts in a tin for my family.

This was an easy and fast cookie recipe. Everyone loved it. I must say you need to make sure you let the cookies sit on the sheet until they are cooled down about 5 mins or you will get a mushy mess if you try to remove them any sooner. Thanks for the recipe!

I was skeptical with so few ingredients but this cookie turned tasty.  I followed suggestion to replace 1/2 of the white sugar with 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I do refrigerate the cookie dough making it easier to roll the balls.  I liked the smaller cookie it makes.  See pic I posted with spoon.  Definitely good to let cookies cool a little before transferring from pan.

I have used this recipe since I was in middle school..... (1992).....very easy for kids to make.  I however leave out the baking soda.  Love these.  Great when we need a dessert and have limited ingredients in the house.

I also added some flour (1/4 cup) and left them in round balls until I removed them from the oven. Then criss-crossed them with a fork. They taste WONDERFUL and were so easy to make saving me lots of time!

Delicious! I used a natural sugar free peanut butter, half a cup white sugar, half a cup brown sugar and half a cup gluten free flour (and the egg and soda) and it turned out really really well! Super easy and super yummy.

A few simple changes & the entire batch was gobbled up in one night. Sugar: I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Instead of egg I used one ripe mashed banana I added 1 tsp vanilla and white chocolate chips. I chilled dough in refrigerator for a couple of hours to make for an easier consistency with which to work. My guys LOVED these.  This one is a keeper.

These are the only peanut butter cookies I make.  The peanut butter flavor really comes through because there is no flour to dilute it.  Everyone who tries them, loves them.

I really liked these. I did make some changes to them after reading other reviews. I did 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 brown sugar and a 1/2 cup peanut butter. I also used the Adams natural crunchy peanut butter and they turned out wonderful. Not too peanut buttery. Just right. I would double the recipe too my didn't make many.

exceeds expectations, especially given the "what do i have left in my kitchen?" nature of the ingredients. cinnamon is worth adding, as is chocolate.

these are amazingly easy and as an added bonus, they're gluten free. a huge hit with everyone and great to bring to a party where one person can't eat flour. They're especially good with chunky peanut butter (the extra nuts gives them a nice texture) and sugar sprinkled on top.

Flavor was nice. Too crumbly for our liking. I pressed some chopped honey roasted peanuts on top before baking. Added nice flavor and crunch. Probably won't make again.

This was okay.  Very peanut-buttery, which can be good or bad.  My husband loved these and I probably will make them again because they are so easy.  I tried to get fancy and make indentations with cookie cutters, but they looked pretty bad.  I'll just stick to flattened balls from now on.  Easy, but not like the greatest peanut butter cookies or anything.

I was skeptical about how these cookies would turn out without the traditional flour.  I did not add the baking soda, but additionally incorporated vanilla extract.  These cookies are easy to make and turned out great!

These were great when you consider how quick and easy they were to make.  Mine were a bit overcooked so I´d advise sticking to the baking time recommended! (I prefer them a bit soft and chewy..)  They were a tad sweet for me but learning all this means they will be EXCELLENT next time I make them.  thanks!

First of all these do not make 36 cookies.  These are sweeter than I usually like, but they were pretty good.  It was easy and I like that. But 5 star no.

I am a cookie baker from way back, and believe that there should be a little "work" involved when baking--but this is a great recipe when you don't have time to fuss.  I love peanut butter cookies, but with the recipes I had tried before the cookies always turned out hard (so I did the unthinkable and resorted to a mix--ack!)  But these cookies are as easy as a mix & they turned out soft.  Great recipe!

I have used this recipe for years - except we don't use baking soda - and it is a family favorite.  It is easy and delicious - but they're gone before you know it.  I flatten the balls of dough slightly with a bottom of a glass dipped in sugar.

All I can say is, "WOW"!  Peanut butter cookies have always seemed a bit "ho-hum" to me, but these are outstanding!  Finished in a snap from start to finish.  I baked a few extra minutes to add a bit more crispness.  This is a recipe I will pass on to my friends and family!

Wow! I was skeptical at first...but these are so easy and awesome!
I found that letting them cool a bit and then wrapping them in stacks of 5 in aluminum foil
made them stay chewy and just plain out-of-this-world!
I also made mine larger than the 1 inch balls...and imprinted them with cross
patterns. I can't believe I made them without flour!

I chilled the batter and even then, I still couldn't get them to roll up.  Way too goooey.  I ended up adding about 1/4 cup flour and just scooped it out.  I would try a different recipe next time.

When I mixed the ingredients together they came out vary sticky are hard to mold so I added a half cup of flour and it fixed it perfectly. It made it a bit crumbly but not too much. I think I misunderstood the directions cause I didn’t put them in as balls but as circles. They came out really good but vary rich but I don’t mind. Good recipe overall

Doubled each ingredient,  except 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar. Plus 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla. Then rolled each ball into more white sugar. Roommates and I loved them. 3 Ingredient cookies wasn't as easy to form ball nor press fork down even after refrigerating dough. Had Great Value then. 
This recipe worked great with Jiff peanut butter. 
Trying Great Value peanut butter now. We'll see.

I have made them twice. the first time i added 1/4 cup of flour as it does help with tge consistency and the second time i added maybe 1/2 tsp of vanilla. they came out even better.  I always double the recipe (I have boys and its never enough) as my kids love them and they can never agree on anything. Thanks for the recipe.

These are very easy to make and yummy. They are a bit too sweet for my taste, so if I make them again I will probably cut the sugar in half.

I used two eggs, a splash of vanilla and dark chocolate chips. They were good! I would make them again. Not the best cookies ever, (and maybe too sweet), but a nice change , easy and good for a quick fix.

These are great. I learned a similar recipe over 20 years ago. The only difference is this calls for baking soda. I don't think it really added much, but it didn't hurt anything either. I add the step of pressing these cookies with a fork to flatten slightly; I like the way they cook instead of just keeping them in a ball. At 325 degrees, mine took closer to 10 minutes to bake. Do not overbake these--they will still look a little undone; don't wait for them to brown like other cookies. Then let them cool at least 5 minutes or they will crumble.

Continued from previous review: All peanut butter is not created equal. You WILL get different results with natural peanut butter than with one that has sugar and other stuff added. Fresh eggs also make a difference. Bottom line is that this is a great quick easy recipe as is, but as with any recipe, you may have to tweak it to your taste.

I'm not a huge fan of peanut butter cookies, but these are some of the better ones I've had! I used closer to 3/4 cup of sugar because the peanut butter was already extra sweet (purchased by accident so I wanted to use it up). The dough was far too soft and sticky to form into balls, so I threw it in the freezer for about ten minutes (and again between batches), and then it was much easier to handle. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and waited until after they were baked to squish them down with a fork, but just ended up mangling the two cookies I tried it on. Second batch I squished down a little under half way before baking, and they turned out just fine. Left the cookies to cool on their trays for about 10 - 15 minutes and had no problem with them squishing or crumbling when I lifted them off. I suspect the people having these problems are trying to remove them too soon - most kinds of cookies will squish or break if you don't let them cool for a few minutes before transferring them.

Adding a tbsp of cornstarch makes  a huge difference in texture for those complaining about them falling apart. Turns them into a sugar/shortbread type cookie. I personally wouldn't make these without it, but to each their own. The addition of the tbsp of cornstarch brings these babies to 5 stars!

It tastes really good! The reason it lost a star is because it's a bit crumbly. Next time I would make a balls a little smaller than 1 inch.

I don't know what I did wrong.... I followed the recipe exactly, down to letting them cool on the pan until they set.  But these cookies just fall apart when you pick them up.

I loved the simplicity of this recipe, however I to had to improvise, and add a few more ingredients to it to make the dough more cookie dough consistency.... +Butter +Gluten free Flour +A Little cocoa   And I doubled it so that I could get a large enough batch. 2 dozen cookies.  But after all that, it came out perfect!! ^_^ Best gluten free cookies eva!!

I am an Executive Pastry Chef and I have been trying to find a good gluten free cookie recipe that you please both people who are gluten free and not and man oh man have I found it. Everyone who has tried these cookies absolutely loves them and they never believe that they are gluten free! Very easy to make and bake and they stay soft! Would highly recommend

Instead of 1 cup white sugar, I use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Delicious! These are always a huge hit.

You might as well save time and energy...just put a spoon of sugar in one hand, a spoon  of warm peanut butter  in the other and eat both. You'll get the same taste and texture. These are  way too mushy and sweet for me .

For a fast cookie it was pretty good. I added chocolate chips.  The sugar was very noticeable. Gave it a very gritty texture.  But other than that its good.

I was skeptical when I saw the list of ingredients but when I bit into I knew I was in love! This is by far the BEST peanut butter could I have ever had. Far better than the traditional recipe in my opinion. This is for true peanut butter lovers, and you will need a huge glass of milk to wash these down. I didn't add any baking soda and they still came out superb! I highly recommend.

My 11 year old daughter took this on as her first unsupervised baking challenge. I didn't see her do it but they turned out absolutely amazing!! True, so rich you need to follow up with a glass of milk though. She did substitute in 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar but that was the only alteration to the project.

This recipe is so quick and easy, I made this in a matter of minutes.  I was a bit worried since the recipe didn't call for any flour or oats, but the cookies turned out great.  Will definitely bake again.

Well four stars as the cookies are in the oven and I had a tough time putting them on the baking tray as the batter was super sticky! I used brown sugar, is that the issue! Did exactly as the recipe says ... hoping they taste good!

I was looking for a PBC recipe that didn't have all the extra fat (butter, margarine or shortening) because, let's face it: regular PB is full of fat already. I didn't like the idea of adding another cup of it! I tried these and they satisfied my craving. Is the texture and consistency the same as a full-fat cookie? Of course not, and mine lacked that crispy-chewy round-mouth goodness of my usual recipe, but I would make these again. Super quick and easy.

Delicious. After reading some of the reviews, I used brown sugar instead of white, skipped the baking soda and let them sit on the pan for about 5 minutes after they came out of the oven. Easy and tasty!

It's my go-to recipe.  I sometimes push them down in the center and put a few choc. chips (we don't eat Hersheys kisses).  I tried straight pb w/ choc. chips in the dough, but it didn't hold together well enough.

This was quick and easy, very rich. If you had a tad more sugar it doesn't fall apart as easy, plus you have to make the roll up balls very tiny. Then they come out perfect; my family loved them.

I've made this recipe for several years minus the baking soda. Now that I moved to a higher elevation, the baking soda and adding some salt really helped with the texture. I personally love peanut butter so I like the taste because all no flour recipes have strong flavors. U can also use crunchy peanut butter to make it more nutty. The recipe yields 15 cookies or so. They expanded alot because of the baking soda.

I made this for a family at church after a baby was born. They are on a gluten-free diet. They're not bad, although I prefer traditional peanut butter cookies more. I found that they made MUCH fewer than 36 cookies per batch.

I doubled this recipe but I only used 1 cup of sugar and I used Adams Crunchy peanut butter. I had to bake mine for about 3 minutes longer than the recipe called for but other than that they worked amazingly well and taste great!

Wow, these are fantastic and easy! They are rich and addictive! I made them the same way as I make any peanut butter cookies, roll into a ball, roll in sugar, then gently flatten with a fork for the trademark crossed tines pattern.
I also made another batch using only Splenda. They were okay. They held up better and were browner but the texture was a bit like saw dust.

Let me be unbiased as possible:

I loved this recipe. But it would be illogical to call the result of following the recipe perfectly a "cookie" per se. It is more like a semi-intact piece of fluffed sugar and peanut butter. This is why I loved it. It's freaking delicious. But let's be honest, if you're looking for a traditional cookie, this isn't your option.I really enjoyed the flavor because let's be honest how do you screw up sugar and peanut butter? Worth my time, at any rate!

Based on the other suggestions, I made a couple of changes but kept the recipe gluten free. Everything the same, except 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup light brown sugar. Then added 1/4 cup coconut flour, 1/4 t. salt and 1/3 cup mini dark chocolate chips. Used a 1" cookie scoop to form the cookies, then lightly pressed with a fork to make the traditional crisis-cross design. Baked at 350 for eight min on parchment paper lined trays. Cool before transferring to a rack. Cookies were delicate with a wonderful peanut flavor. Made 28 cookies.

I love how quick and easy these are to make. I changed the recipe slightly using 1/2 cup brown sugar.  The original was too sweet for me but my friends loved them.  I will definitely be making them again. In fact i'm going too make some right now ?

I wasnt impressed. These  were not the right consistency for a peanut butter cookie, they were too peanut buttery, and too sweet. I like my peanut butter cookies to be crisp. I cooked for the full 8 minutes at 325°. There were moist and crumbley. I even added a table spoon of flour.

This recipe was brilliant, fast and simple. I read in the comments to add 1/4 cup of flour but I found that if you use a full cup you get a great crispy yet soft texture. Also I left them in longer than the recommended time just to crisp them up. I left them in until they didn't deflate when touched

These turned out amazingly well. I did 50/50 brown sugar/white sugar since we always like the flavor of brown better than white, and we had some cinnamon raisin flavored peanut butter leftover from the holidays so I used 50/50 cinnamon peanut butter/regular p.butter. So chewy and soft on the inside while still a tiny bit crispy on the edges. Quick to make and full of flavor while relatively low in calories since there's no lard or butter in this recipe. Thank you!

I do it a bit different and do 1 jar, no matter what size, peanut butter; 1 jar sugar; eggs depending on size of jar (1 or 2) and bake.  I make these by the hordes for the fire department my daughter works at.  They absolutely love them...note; every time I make them they have a bit different result, from fall apart to pick up and go...I sometimes roll in a ball and stick a hershey's kiss in the middle and bake; these are also fantastic; I have also put a hole in the ball and added a teaspoon of favorite jelly or jam...no matter what, they are always gone in a few hours.

I found that I needed to add an extra egg to this recipe to keep the cookies from crumbling. But otherwise, great recipe! Super quick and a family favorite.

They cooked easily with only a few ingredients. On overview they tasted not so great, very strong and you could feel the sugar crunch in your mouth. I wouldn't recommend making these for company.

My husband and I love this recipe! I made a batch of 72, the batter was a little too dry by these exact proportions, so I added a third egg. I also added chocolate chips. The people on here saying these cookies are too peanut buttery, must have forgotten that they were making PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES! These are a favorite and will be in our family for a long time!

These were very good peanut buttery cookies.  I did not have butter to make "traditional" PB cookies so I tried these.  Would not hesitate to make again.

This is a great recipie and since it uses no flour it is even better! I have never been successful with making peanut butter cookies, but this one worked! I love it and they are deliciousness! Great tip too, if you want to make those fork marks on the top, dip your fork in water when the dough starts to stick!

I was shocked at how well these cookies turned out! I thought for sure they would need some tweaking to make them just right, but they didn't! Amazing texture and taste!  These are awesome for making with your kids as they take virtually no time. The kids can even make them!

I decided to try this with a cup of oatmeal for texture & 3/4 cup of chocolate chips. I think this made them less overwhelmingly peanut buttery and less likely to fall apart.

I liked the cookies, but it was more like cookie crumbles.  It is good folded into vanilla ice cream!  I followed the recipe exactly, yet the cookie does not keep form once you pick the cookie up. Instead it falls apart.  It is delicious though.

Had a craving for something sweet but ran out of oatmeal. I eat gluten free and this seemed like such an easy recipe! They were very yummy, but I did have to cook them longer than stated. I saw someone posted that they used brown sugar and I think I'll try that next time!

For those who are gluten free, this recipe creates tasty, peanut buttery little cookies. I add a 1/4 cup (or less) coconut flour to give it a bit more body. I also add melted chocolate to the top of each cookie. I just melt down an 88% dark cacao bar and fill in the criss cross fork marks on the top of the cookies. I also substitute the white sugar for either brown sugar or Sugar in the Raw. Everyone loves these little scrumptious cookies!!!

I just took the cookies out of the oven they are rather crumbly. Since my intention was to serve them to my kids I'm not sure how mess-free of a treat this will be. I looked at other recipes and I noticed there was no baking soda used. I will try next time without the baking soda

Tasty! I used crunchy peanut butter and added vanilla. I added 1/2 cup of flour to lessen the strong peanut butter taste.After 8 minutes the cookies were still very soft, but they harden after they cool; do no more than 10 minutes.

5 minutes after I took them out of the oven, they were super soft. I ate one with a spoon abd it was very thick. I always liked the crispiness of pb cookies and did not get the same reaction.

I was in the mood for cookies and wanted them right away, and this recipe fit the bill! I only made a half batch (just in case) and made with white and brown sugar. Super tasty, very pretty cookies and only 2 WW points! My husband and boys loved them as well. Definitely a keeper! Seems like I went to much more trouble than I did.

My great grandmother, from Fort Wort, Texas gave me this recipe, minus the baking soda, back in the 1970's.  These cookies have always been a HUGE hit with people and they are so surprised to find out there is no flour in them.  I have shared it with multiple friends and had it published in a couple of fundraising cookbooks in the 1980's.  I think they are the best ever peanut butter cookies.  I LOVE THEM.  Thanks, Grandma Renshaw! ;)

These are okay but way too much peanut butter..even after adding vanilla and a little flour mix thinking it would even out the flavor. Like many others who commented, I would rather find another recipe that I really like with flour in it. However, this is a great recipe for people who have celiac disease or have to avoid flour. Overall, not the worst cookie I have tried but probably wont make it again.

My husband loves peanut butter cookies. Tried this recipe out and used brown sugar as GINAH1 did and I thank you both! They were AMAZINGLY delicious, I'm not a big fan of peanut butter cookies but after making these I think I just became a fan :)

Tried this recipe and loved it. I substituted white sugar for brown, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. The cookies were the perfect consistency & concentration of peanut butter flavor. Plus, it took half an hour to make! I'll definitely be making them again.

This recipe was great!!! The only thing I did differently was after I rolled the dough into balls, I put a little white sugar in a boll and rolled the balls in it.  Then I had little chocolate squares I cut into fours to and pressed lightly on top.  Delicious!!!

These cookies are amazing. However,  if you add flour you need to make sure it's gluten-free if you're making them for someone who has celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.

I have used a similiar recipe for years.  1 cup peanut butter, 1/4 cup white sugar, a little bit of ground flax, 1/4 chocolate chips, 1 egg.  No baking soda or vanilla.  Cook at 325 for 8-12 minutes depending upon your oven.  I used to use kraft peanut butter but now am using Adams Natural PB that only has a little bit of salt and no sugar.  Much better tasting but heavy.

I added chocolate chips to this recipe & it was delicious! Also, don't forget to tamp the dough balls down w/ a fork before baking - the original instructions leave this part out.

I added 1 t. of gluten free Bisquick (cause I didn't have the g.f. floor), 1/4 c. mini chocolate chips, 1 t. vanilla to original recipe. Also used 1/2 c white sugar & 1/2 c. brown sugar.  Refrigerated for an hour before baking. GREAT!!  Will make again and double this time! :)

These are delicious but very fragile cookies!  I doubled the recipe, added 1 cup of dark chocolate chips, 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts, 1/4th cup of rice flour, and 1/8th cup of almond meal.  Several reviewers had remarked about adding rice flour to make them easier to roll.  I also used half brown sugar and half regular sugar.  Next time I will try using more rice flour to see if the cookies will be more sturdy.  The chocolate chips and the walnuts go really well with the peanut butter!  My batches took a minimum of eight minutes in the oven.  I baked them in a ball on the cookie sheet and then gently used a fork to press them down slightly once they were out of the oven.  I used parchment paper and let them completely cool on the cookie sheet before carefully picking them up with a fork.

Ok, this was surprisingly good!! I had saved this recipe to my box about 5 or 6 months ago, looked at it every now and then, but was sure it would probably not be very good. Well, it was EASY, TASTY and SUPER FAST! It only has 4 ingredients!! It's also naturally gluten and dairy-free, which means my daughter can eat it. I thought it would just be like a blob of peanut butter on a cookie sheet, but it looks like a cookie! 

some tips: use parchment paper, then the cookies come off super easy without breaking up. Also, I used natural peanut butter so maybe it was drier? anyway, they ended up like slightly softened balls. I didn't do the fork thing because I thought they would fall apart, but they were pretty firm. I also followed someone else's tip and let them rest 5 minutes before taking them off. Perfect!

Quick and Easy.  Kids loved them however I found them a bit on the sweet side.  Will definitely cut down the sugar next time.  Also, I baked at 325 for 15 min and they came out just right (slightly golden on the bottom).  Will update next time I make them with less sugar.  

Also, I put the dough in the freezer for 15 min to give it a quick chill so it would be easier to handle when rolling into balls.

Thanks for the recipe!

Quick and easy cookies. For a recipe that has only 4 ingredients they were okay. For my taste I prefer a cookie that is more moist.

I made this recipe exactly as directed. I used Jiff extra crunchy pb.  I made the balls slightly larger than I was supposed to, and I dipped them in sugar before I pressed with a fork.   baked 9 minutes, super yummy my kids loved them :)

Yummy!!!  Always looking for recipes with little or no flour!  These are delicious!!!  I dipped my fork in powdered sugar to make criss-cross.  It adds a little to the melt in your mouth sensation these create.  But perfect just as recipe is written.

I like the recipe.  I would recommend a baking temperature of 275-300, and bake them no longer than 4 minutes.  I just made 100 of these puppies and every batch burnt well before the 6 minute mark.

These were great! I used all natural peanut butter, which was pretty much inedible on anything else. I added two bars of baker's semi-sweet chocolate, which was awesome! I  added about a tablespoon of flour for easy rolling. I also added a squirt of honey, a dash of cinnamon, and a pinch of nutmeg. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

The cookies came out moist and didn't fall apart. I added a pinch of flour and put the batter in the freezer for about a half hour before baking which I think helped. They were easy, fast, and pretty darn good considering they're gluten free.

Super Yummy bite size morsels. Slight crispiness on outside and soft center. Too bad they disappear so fast. I also recommend refrigerating dough for at least an hour to make it easier to form into balls.

Very good! I added some cinnamon and vanilla and also took previous review advice and added 1/4 flour and smashed after the 8 minutes baking. Then i actually stuck back in for another 5 mins. They came out awesome!! The people saying they crumble LET THEM COOL ON THE BAKING SHEET FOR ATLEAST 10 MINS OTHERWISE THEY WILL CRUMBLE!!!

I tweaked these just a little and they turned out great!  I added 1/4 c. of flour, and a dash of salt and cinnamon.  The batter was just too wet without the flour.  Very peanut buttery!

I reduced the sugar a little bit to suit my tastes, and thought these came out perfect. Great, quick recipe, but definitely isn't 36 servings (more like 3 or 4 the way they got gobbled up), so just be aware of that!

I think the reviews on this recipe are very misleading. They turn out extremely mushy and take a very long time to cook and they never are a solid cookie- they turn to crumbles. So if this is a recipe for peanut butter..crumbles.. then you got it but if you want fast pb cookies, look elsewhere.

Easy recipe! My pb cookies were soooo delicious and looked like I bought them from a bakery! With the ingrediants I did add a 1/2 cup of flour, dash of cinnamon, and a drop of vanilla. The cookies do need to rest for about an hour on a plate.

These were amazing. I made small balls then did the criss cross pattern with a fork. I baked them for 8 minutes. They didn't look like they were done but I took them out anyway. (They will continue to cook out of the oven) I waited 10 minutes before trying them. They were light and crisp. The recipe is perfect as is but just to shake things up I'm gonna try it with brown sugar, and a little vanilla. So simple! love it love it love it! :)

Used 1/4 C brown sugar, 1/4 C white and left out the baking soda.  Used about 3/4 Tablespoon batter for each cookie and flattened onto pan.  They weren't finished at 8 minutes so baked a little longer.  Allowed to cool 10 minutes in pan before transferring them off to finish cooling.  Used an organic natural peanut butter.  It's a nice gluten-free cookie, but I would recommend adding something, like chocolate chips or using crunchy peanut butter.

Pretty good. I added some flour, cinnamon, and craisins, and they came out so moist and soft! Absolutely loved how simple it is. Great for a beginner, or those of us who like to experiment with a basic recipe and make it their own!

I wasn't really that impressed with this recipe.  I followed it really close, with the exception of replacing the white sugar with brown sugar and adding chocolate chips.  The cookies stuck to the pan and burnt on the bottom, but they were still raw on top.  However, my husband loved them.

These were awesome! I really enjoyed how fast they were to make and the fewer ingredients the better! ;) One thing I think would help would be to cut the sugar down just a bit since the peanut butter is already loaded with it. But other than that fantastic! :)

I love the concept of this quick cookie!  I made a few very slight changes though.  I added a tsp of vanilla, replaced 1 c sugar with 1 c splenda.  Added 2 tbs maple syrup and 1 tbs unsweetend cocoa powder and 1/2 tsp coffee.  I also lightly dusted with powdered sugar.  I used Adams natural peanut butter.  THe slight changes made it not so peanut buttery and the cocoa powder binded it more. I made sure to cool on baking sheet before moving to my cooling rack. THEY WERE AMAZING for the short amount of time it took to whip them up!  My toddler had fun!

These were great. I made a few tweaks based on others suggestions. I mixed 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar, added a little vanilla and also mixed in a couple handfuls of heath toffee mix. Everyone loved them!

I've made almost the same cookies except without the baking soda and they turn out pretty much the same if not a little more moist. It is a good recipe for peanut butter loving people with celiac disease though (and even for those of us without it too)!

I  love this recipe.  Today I made them with brown sugar ( I ran out of white sugar) and added gluten free dairy free soy free nut free chocolate chips.  They turned out perfectly ooey and gooey when warm and cooled nicely into a soft and chewy delight.  I highly recommend the brown sugar and chocolate.

I've been making this recipe for years!  People are always shocked to find out they're made with only 4 ingredients.  When I make them, I never roll them into balls (I just drop by teaspoonfuls) or chill the dough.  I also bake at 350  for 10 minutes rather than at 325 for 6-8.  These cookies are buttery and delicious, perfect for peanut butter lovers!

This recipe saved my hide when my teenage son said (two hours before his performance) that we needed to bring two batches of a cookie.  I found this recipe and began to make.  What a wonderful cookie this is.  Crisp edges, chewy center and EASY to make.  I added semi-sweet chocolate chips to one batch for a variation.  Before we left the concert, I had written the recipe down numerous times.  Thank you for saving the day.

I found this recipe to be a little too runny when I doubled it. I added 1 cup of brown sugar instead of white. I added 2 tablespoons of nongluten flour mix, 1/2 teaspoon of soda and salt. I also added 1 teaspoon of maple syrup. The last thing I added was 1 1/2 cups of a tropical granola mix. These were excellent.

So, so easy!!!  I needed something quick to whip up with the few ingredients I had in the house and this was just perfect.  How could something so good be so easy?

This recipe is excellent.  It really took no time at all.  I used it as an activity for two three year olds.  I made the batter and then used a  rounded tablespoon measuring cup sprayed with pam to scoop the batter onto the pan.  Then the kids used  the shallow cookie cutters that were on the bottom of my measuring cups to lightly press the cookie balls down, so that the cookie had a small heart shaped indent in the center of the cookie.  Before putting them in the oven, I sprinkled a pinch of granulated light brown sugar over the tops of the cookie.  After taking the cookies out of the oven, I drizzled Smuckers butterscotch sundae topping over the entire pan.  The kids loved them and my neighbors couldn't get enough!!  Thanks Vicki!

This is a recipe that should be handed out to ALL parents!!  I give it to everyone I know that needs to be able to make a quick batch of cookies with stuff you always have in the pantry!  They taste great and I'm done with the dough before the oven is even preheated!  Perfect for busy parents on the go!!

I know I can't expect much from a short list ingredient recipe , but these cookies tasted like plain peanut butter and it was so peanut butterish that I had to drink a full cup of water after tasting one cookie. It had no special taste and the texture was way crumbly.

This is easy and yummy as it gets.  But, we too preferred flattening them with a sugar-coated glass bottom.

Excellent taste!!!!  My 5-year-old had a friend over and we made these together.  Because there's no flour, there's less mess.  Kids seem to enjoy them.  We used crunchy peanut butter and added mini chocolate chips for added flavor.

This recipe is great when you're in a hurry or even when you're not. the only problem is i don't know how long they keep because they get eaten too fast in my house :).

I never liked peanut butter cookies until I tried this recipe.  They are delicious!  They were a big hit with the whole family-and I have 4 children who never like the same thing.  Thanks for this fantastic recipe. Sue73
