Great idea subbing nilla wafers for lady fingers.  There was not enough liquid called for in this recipe.  I had to punch holes in my pie and dump more coffee over it because even after 12 hours the wafers were still hard.  I would say double the amount.  Also double the cream cheese- we couldn't even taste it.  People at work also said it needed more coffee flavor- even though I added some extra coffee liquor.  Is there such a thing as coffee flavored pudding because that might help.  This is a great idea in theory, but needs to be kicked up a few notches.

My bf and I have made this probably 10 times, after finding the recipe on a french vanilla cool whip container, unfortunately, we cant find french vanilla cool whip anymore, even in the fall/winter, so we use regular, and french vanilla pudding and it tastes the same. BUT we use more coffee, I drizzle it on the cookies til theyre all wet and softening, every time we make this we do it a little different, and its always tasted amazing, just make sure to keep it cold for atleast 4-5 hours or it'll be runny, but its AMAZING, Im not a fan of coffee, but I can definately taste it in there and this dessert is our favorite, In a family of 4  plus a toddler who wont eat anything, it only lasts a day. Lol. Definately cant want to take it to a family get together for them to try it!

I made two pies because I had to modify this recipe. I used 1pkg (4serving size) of chocolate flavor pudding. Made it the same as for the vanilla and also made the vanilla. I made the bottom layer chocolate and the top vanilla. Did everything else the same. Wonderful!!!

This is good, but you need way more coffee than the recipe calls for.  I soaked the wafers in coffee and I still didn't really taste the coffee.  I think next time I make it I will add some coffee to the cream cheese mixture.  I also used Lite Cool Whip and it was still good.

I doubled the amount of coffee but still didn't have a coffee taste like Tiramisu usually does.  I think the Nilla wafers overpowered the coffee flavor. My husband doesn't usually like Tiramisu but he liked this.
