For those of you that love the sweet taste, this pie is the way to go! I also added a few sprinkles of strawberry jello powder to the flour, sugar, and raspberry mix. I've already gotten requests for this recipe from friends. This is a great summer pie.

This is quite sweet, if you want tart, cut back on the sugar.  Great as is, though.  The egg and flour holds the fruit together & absorb juices.  I let the baked pie sit at room temperature 24 hours before serving and it was not liquidy at all.  Also, a regular pie pan should be fine, you don't need deep-dish.

I have made this pie several times and have gotten RAVE reviews.  It's easy and throw in a little french vanila ice cream on the side and it is a fabulous dessert.  Thanks  Renee

This was delicious! I was a little low on rhubarb so I tossed in a cup of blueberries that I had- still delicious! Everyone loved the pie.

this pie is incredible.  it holds together great.  it could use  a little more sugar.  rhubarb and raspberries are both a little on the sour side.  served with vanilla ice cream, this made a wonderful "birthday cake" for my 32-year-old son.

Good, easy recipe with the right amount of sweetness.  When I filled my crust, I thought it seemed a little thin so I added another cup of fruit (strawberries) with an additional Tbl flour and a sprinkle of sugar.  Brushed the top crust with milk and a sprinkle of sugar.  Everyone who tried it loved it!

Didn't put an egg in it as I use tapioca (4 T) for my fruit pies.  I used a crumb crust and 6 people ate the whole pie.  Very good!

I have made this pie twice both times came out great, only thing you may have to change is the sugar content, it all depends on how sour your fruit is in the beginning.
