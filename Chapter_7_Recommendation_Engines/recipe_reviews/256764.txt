This was fantastic! Didn't need to worry about transferring to something to keep it warm; I served it in a regular bowl and it was gone before it cooled down! Even the non-beer people came back for seconds.

Followed the recipe except used an IPA from a Columbus brewery. It was a stringy blob of cheese.
