This idea Jessica, is just too sweet for words! I didn't pierce the hole until they were out of the oven, as the cookies were still nice and soft. Believe it or not, I made these for my teen to take to school and give out to her best buds. I packed the rest of the cookies that were not made into necklaces into a container so she could share them with her lunch table. A couple of heart shaped turkey sandwiches (using my cookie cutter) and a little "love note" made her day. This just proves that even the big kids get a kick out of these special touches. Thanks so much Jessica and Happy Valentines Day!

This was easy and yummy.  I made two batches for Valentines.  On the second batch I added a pinch of salt to the wet ingredients and used only 3/4 tsp of baking powder (I could taste it with the full 1 tsp) I did not have any lemon zest and it came out fine without.

I also used a smaller heart cutter to make a heart 'window' in the cookie necklace on some, it was so cute :)

The cookies and frosting are absolutely delicious.  The cookies may even be the best sugar/shortbread cookies that I have ever tasted.  I will be making these cookies and frosting again and again.  However, making the necklaces was very time consuming (adorable but time consuming).  I could not find the long string licorice so I ended up having to tie 3 short strands together for each cookie which took a long time.  The holes in the cookies also closed up but it was easy to open them using a pointed knife inserted in the back of the cookie and twisting gently.  If you have a meyer lemon tree, you just have to make these cookies using the peel/zest from the meyer lemon.  I still cannot believe how tasty these cookies are and I am not a fan of lemon cookies.

A wonderful sugar cookie recipe. I love the idea of maing it into a necklace to give to friends. I made this with my cooking 4-H club and they enjoyed it and had loads of fun! I omitted the frosting and added 10 drops of red food coloring to the dough.

Great Valentine  craft/gift. We made a double batch for our girls to make for their classmates. The small sized heart cookie cutters were perfect for making the pendants. We put 2 different sized/colored cookies on each necklace. We live in a very small town and couldn't get red lace licorice, so we threaded them on variegated yarn. it worked just fine. 

As for the recipe, it was wonderful as directed. I love the shortbread cookie. I will be making it often! I did make some hearts and heart outline cookies and left them unfrosted. I put raspberry preserves on the full cookie and layered the open heart cookie on top. Such a light sweet take on this cookie. Great with a cup of tea or coffee. We will be making these again! Thanks Jessica!

These cookies are great! I made these for my nephew's kindergarten class..and they loved them! These cookies are great becuase they're sturdy enough to be handled by little kids, yet still moist and flavorful! The only changes I made was I used orange extract in place of the lemon zest (I didn't have any), and they had just a nice subtle orange flavor. These cookies are a keeper!

These necklaces were so easy to make and my niece had a blast! For the frosting I used thick royal icing- worked out great. The cookies tasted good too- the kids and the adults were all happy- what a deal!!

Thank you for a very cute recipe idea!  They turned out really well and Im very happy with this recipe!  The dough was not sticky, it was easy to handle, roll and cut out the heart shapes!  I tinted the dough with pink Wiltons concentrationed paste.  I made larger hearts and cut out the center with a small cutter for some and for the others I used 1" heart cutter and I made the hole (with a straw) prior to baking and it didn't close up.  I used red "shoelace' licorice for the necklace and it made the most cutest cookie presentation ever!   Happy Valentine's day!

Very fun snack! I needed to cook them a little longer though to make them sturdy. Take them out when the bottom edges are starting to brown. They tasted fantastic and the dough was very easy to work with.

Very good!  This was a very nice change from our traditional sugar cookie recipe.  We liked the subtle lemon flavor (I used fresh lemon peel). The texture was nice, too. I rolled them to about 1/4" and they stayed soft. We tinted the dough and icing pink and made some with icing and some without.  We preferred the iced ones but the plain ones were delicious as well - and I can't say that about my traditional cut-out recipe as they are NOT good without icing. We will definitely make this one again.  FYI:  We didn't bother making them into necklaces, but we might try that sometime for a special treat.  FYI:  Chilled dough and it was very easy to work with which is a nice plus.

Sooooooo good! It was a little time consuming but well worth it. The holes were easy enough to make, I simply used a straw and than baked them after piercing the hole and the hole didn't close up at all.

It may be because I am a busy mother of twins working full time but I found this recipe very time consuming.  The cookies are good and look good but I don't think I will go into so much trouble next year.  My 3 yrs old were very impressed and proudly brought them to daycare today as Valentine's Day presents.

I liked the shortbread taste of these cookies. They are durable, but it takes a while to tie all the "strings" on. The kids loved them, lots of fun.

Great sugar cookies - more like shortbread.  My husband liked them better with the lemon zest, which I didn't have the first time.  We're now making them for my daughter's class.  Great recipe and very easy to do.

This recipe was wonderful!! I made these for my 4 yr old's ballet class and they worked out great! After the cookies came out of the oven I re-pierced them with the straw to make the hole a little larger. The licorice slid through without a problem. I then tied the necklace to a Valentine treat bag to add a little pizzaz. Thank you for the great idea!

These are just perfect!  I made a batch of them for my son to take for his preschool Valentine party.  I used ribbon instead of licorice.  My husband ate one and liked the flavor of them so well that he asked me to make another batch for him to take to work (minus the ribbons).  I made mine without frosting, just a coarse colored sugar sprinkled on before baking.  Also, in the second batch, I didn't have a lemon, so I used 1/2 tsp orange extract and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract.  These are just the right size and flavor for enjoying with a cup of coffee.  Love 'em!  Nice job with this recipe.

These are cute!  The cookie dough recipe is delicious.  I just used store-bought frosting to save a little time.  I tried pull 'n peel licorice strings, but had a very hard time tying them.  I ended up using ribbon.

Used just for the cookie recipe but its a super cute idea for Valentines!  Cookies are more like shortbread (mildly dry), less like sugar but still taste great.

I made these cookies, but not the necklaces.  They were great!  The dough was very easy to work with too.

My daughter and I made these yesterday for Valentine's Day! What a fun afternoon! I only let the dough chill for 2 hours (if that) and it rolled with ease. Only two minor problems: First, I used the straw to make the hole for the necklaces but as they baked, the holes closed together anyway and they were tricky to re-do them when they were done baking.  Second, they were soooo soft (a good thing if your not trying to do the necklace part), which made it difficult to string the licorce through the hole.  After two attempts with the necklace stuff, we just gave up and frosted the rest without the licorce.  Still, these were darn good cookies that even I = the non-cookie lover, had to admire. Would make these again! Thanks Jessica for the creative and fun Valentine project!

Thank you so much for this fun and delicious recipe!  (I doubled the cookie recipe.)  The cookies themselves are divine, I got many compliments on the taste of the cookie.  Of course the children loved the looks of everything. We had no problem using the straw, etc.  What a fun activity!

I can't wait til try this with a twist.
I'm going to cut out the center of the heart using a smaller cookie cutter. Before baking I'm going to fill the centers with crushed red hard candies. The crushed candy will melt while baking and once cooled will look like stained glass.  
I think this will make it look more like jewelry. My sons love when I make Stained Glass Sugar Cookies for their classmates. I'm sure they'll like giving them out as necklaces this year
