We don't care for eggplant, so I added extra thinly sliced squash and zucchini.  Used ground chicken and It was very good.  Even our 3 year old granddaughter ate it up!

Very yummy!!  I used 2 yellow peppers and a large onion.  Roasted them along with the zucchini and eggplant with Italian seasoning and a little olive oil for about 40 minutes.  Added some roasted red peppers to the turkey/marinara mixture.  Used lots of extra Italian seasoning.  Very good results!  It made two small casseroles.  Going to freeze one.  Will make again for sure!
