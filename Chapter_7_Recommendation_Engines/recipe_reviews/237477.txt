Easy recipe and good, although, wait until late Summer. I did these with peaches this week and the peaches just weren't that good.  Not the recipe's fault.  The black pepper really makes the dish.

Delicious! My bread was a bit too fresh, but still very tasty. I used peaches but also used strawberries tossed in sushi vinegar (rice vinegar and sugar). Both are great. :) I'm a huge fan of Chef John! My boyfriend and I have watched his videos together since we started dating in 2014--when I get lonely when I travel, I listen to Chef John.

Fantastic appetizer! I used a French baguette and trippled the cheese, Thyme and pepper. Had to have it in the broiler close to 10 minutes at 6" from heat. It was a HUGE success! I will be making this again for certain!

I love this recipe!!!  You can also vary with putting the peaches on the grill first and then really kicking up that summer flavor!!  The grill helps if your peaches aren't end of summer perfect quite yet.

This was extremely tasty! The olive oil was a nice touch. I love Chef John's videos, he always makes me laugh out loud and plus they're yummy recipes!

Be careful because it burns the edges of the bread very quickly.

I made it with peaches, strawberries, and raspberries. The raspberries were a bit too tart. The whole thing might need a little bit of sugar sprinkled on top of the fruit. Other than that, a great recipe.

Had to use well-drained, canned peaches and 1/4 tsp. of dried thyme.  For my taste, too much olive oil.  Next time will use olive oil on only one side of the bread, try it with some mint or rosemary instead of thyme; and drizzle a little honey on top instead of more olive oil.

This is so good and easy to make.  I would give it 10 stars rather than the five.  Chef John has hit a grand slam homer with this dish.
