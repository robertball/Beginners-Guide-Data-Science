This has been a favorite in my family for a few years but because of one very important addition.  Adding crushed red pepper is what makes this a great side dish.  Add a little or a lot, depending on what you can take.

I used two cans of corn, less butter, 4 oz of cream cheese, and heated everything in the microwave. This was a delicious, simple recipe to prepare. Next time, I'll try the red pepper as previously suggested. Thanks!

I knew ahead of time that this recipe would be too bland for my taste buds, so I added a little chopped garlic and a little more chopped jalapeno for an extra kick.  It was even better reheated the next day after the jalapeno had had time to really sink in.

This was a big hit for Christmas dinner and one of the more popular leftovers.  Since it was the holidays, (and we had already blown the diets soooo badly already) I added a few slices of cooked/crumbled bacon and just a touch of bacon grease.  I also baked it in the oven to heat it after preparing it the day before - - -wonderful!

I altered the recipe to serve one person (myself) as a late night snack. I used low-fat cream cheese, but found that it didn't melt very well. So I heated up the corn in the microwave for about 30 seconds, the cream cheese broke up quickly, and it took about half the time to make. I eventually added many of my own seasonings (salt, pepper, paprika) as I found it to be much to bland. Although, I found the cream cheese to corn ratio to be a bit too creamy, this was an okay dish after all. I would suggest tasting it as the dish cooks, and adding your own seasoning as needed. Also, if you are cooking small quantities, cook on low heat, otherwise it will overcook and/or burn.

Corn is our favorite veggie and this is our favorite way to eat it!  I often use 3 cans and we omit the butter.  For my hubby and I, we love to add a can of diced green chilis. Delicious!!

With the amounts listed this makes a TON!  I cut the recipe into 2/3 and it was more than
enough for 8 adults.  I had lots left over but lots of happy tummies!  I had people asking 
for the recipe when they left.

This was excellent.  Normally I just use butter, salt and pepper.  This was definitely a nice change.  My daughter who I thought wouldnt not even try, went straight for it.  Asked for seconds even.  It is a lot of corn but it'll feed at least 6 people with some to spare.  I will be making this again in the near future.

Easily bored with vegetable casserole recipes, I tried this in hopes of jazzing things up a bit.  I added the red pepper flakes and a shake or two of prepared real bacon bits.  It was a pleasant addition to the dinner table and far from ordinary.

We loved this recipie!  I had a ton of leftover grilled corn from a BBQ and had no idea what to do with it.  Luckily I found this recipie and I had everything I needed for it in my fridge!  Such an easy go to for dinner parties also.  I did add some diced tomatoes and used less butter.  So good and creamy!

You are missing the most important ingredient - Velveeta!  Add chopped up Velveeta and the can of Rotel as others have suggested. Use frozen corn, start it in the slow cooker early in the day and YUM!

This was okay, wish I had read the reviews first!  It does need a jalapeño pepper and I didn't know to get one at the store.

To liven up the flavor of this, I melted the cream cheese with chopped jalapenoes and 1/8 of cup of jalapeno juice.  I also added cracked black pepper and salt.  I tossed that with the corn, threw it in the crockpot and it resulted in a pretty good side dish.  I might experiment with some of the flavored cream cheeses next time...like sun-dried tomato or red pepper!  Thanks, Earla!

While this was a yummy dish, it was too bland for eating in hearty quantities. I will. Try it again with the tips of other reviewers - maybe garlic, salt, paprika, pepper, and a lower cream cheese-to-corn ratio.

I made this corn last week. Everyone liked it, the only thing was the corn didn't cook very well (we used frozen) and the texture wasn't the best. Besides that they liked it!

This is such a simple recipe but so delicious. I separated into 2 and added diced jalapeños to one.  Cream cheese and jalapeños together are one of my favorites so this is definitely a side dish we make quite often now.

This is such a simple recipe but so delicious. I separated into 2 and added diced jalapeños to one.  Cream cheese and jalapeños together are one of my favorites so this is definitely a side dish we make quite often now.

I made this as is at first, and it was good and easy, but a bit boring for me. So I added parsley and tomatoes based on some other reviews. After the additions, I thought it was a very good side dish!

This recipe is great as is but I love it even more with a can of chopped green chilies added to it. It really adds a kick of southwestern flavor.

I used 3 ears of corn, 1/2 a tub of chive & onion cream cheese, and the butter...I thought my son and husband were going to eat my pot, they ate it so fast!  Will be making this week as well, with the corn crop still in grocery stores.

I was looking for a way to jazz up corn for a potluck luncheon I had at work.  I found this recipe and thought I'd give it a try, but with some moderations as others suggested.  This is what I did.  I used 2 Pounds of frozen corn, 1/2 can of chicken broth, 1 8 oz package cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp paprika.  I let this cook in the crockpot for about 2 1/2 hours half on high, half time on low and would stir occasionally.  Everyone loved it.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but nobody liked this. Maybe it's just too different for the family and friends to wrap their minds around. Sorry to the creator.

Kind of funky -- sweetish with a strong cream cheese flavor.  I didn't alter at all.  My kids (5 and 8y) really liked it -- might make it again for that reason. A nice change from plain corn.

This has been a family favorite since I was a child.  We call it "Nana's creamed corn."  As an adult, everyone I've prepared it for has raved! It's always a hit in Texas!

This recipe was a good base, but I did need to spruce it up a bit. I added garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper and a dash of seasoning salt. Very good!

My daughter made this recipe for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it.  I have made it several times since and will make it tomorrow for Easter.  We follow the directions but then keep it warm in the crockpot until serving time.  .

I have made a similar dish for years. Instead of fresh corn, frozen or 3 cans of shoepeg corn works just as well.  I add 1/2 to 3/4 cup of green chili depending on heat/taste.  Yummy and oh so popular at potlucks.

It's not a bad side dish. I agree it does look plain and perhaps tastes less wow for others , therefore you will attempt to make it "colorful" or twig with the recipe a little bit. Good luck.

Perhaps I did something wrong (don't see how though since there's not much to this) but my corn was a runny mess, so I had to add bread crumbs to it to thicken it up a bit.  The first few bites were pretty good, but each bite after that it got worse.  I'll not be making this one again.  (Sorry)

Pretty good. I added 2 chopped jalapenos (depends on how hot they are) and some 1/3 c of milk.

My family & friends rave about this dish. Most of the time, I omit the chiles for those who can't handle the heat. But it works well with or without them.

This is a wonderful side dish.  Corn with a twist! It's different, but delicious!  This receipe puts a new meaning to cream corn.

Easy to make, VERY tasty.  Use sweet cream butter for better results.  Can make less fattening by using magarine and low/no fat cream cheese which also turns out pretty good.

I have used this recipie for many many years but I add 2 cups of sharp cheddar cheese to mine and bake it instead of stove top.  Its always a big hit!!  Its even good as a dip for corn chips the next day if you have any leftovers!!  Not a diet food for sure but so good!!

My daughter and I liked it, but my husband and son did not. I used canned corn though and they thought that they might like it better if I used frozen. So, I might try it again. It was a little thick, which was ok, but there was not a lot of flavor. I had to salt it. I tried the leftovers today though and like it better.

This was just ok.  It was creamy alright but it was too bland tasting will all the cream cheese.  We couldn't quite taste the flavor of the corn!  Had to spice it up quite a bit.  I probably won't make again but it was a nice try.  Thanks.

usually i make my corn with butter, black pepper, cayenne, garlic powder, and cumin... so i gave the cream cheese a try... i like it better without the cream cheese, personally. it didnt bring anything to the flavor, and seemed to drown out my added spices.. but still tasty.. i ate it all...

Kinda bland as is, but a decent start. To make I use a large can of drained corn and add a 1/2 container of medium salsa to the cream cheese to give this "kick".  Perfect as a side dish to a Mexican dish or even a nice seasoned steak and a baked potato.

I used only 1lb of corn instead of three and it came out great. (I'm not even a corn lover but this was good) Next time I might try sweet corn.

This dish was ok, but I had to add some garlic powder to it for some flavor. I also found that the cream cheese was very thick when melted so I added some milk to thin it out.

The corn was really good, gave it a very different taste from regular corn.

This is my favorite way to eat corn.  Since no one else in my family likes it, I make smaller batches, but it reheats well too.

Awesome easy side dish!  We used fresh summer corn, which probably makes a big difference. Per the suggestion of other reviewers, we spiced it up a bit with some chopped jalapenos and a generous dose of Tajin (a mildly spicy Mexican spice mix.)  So delicious, and it couldn't be easier to make.

I do use the crockpot so I can basically set it and forget it, with the occasional stirring.

This came out good but next time I make it I think I will do half the butter because it was pretty thin instead of thicker like I had hoped.

I used parmesan cheese. Next time I'll cook the corn and add the cheese on top. Added green onions to cut the grease. Really good.

I grew up with this side dish for Thanksgiving and Christmas, and I've always been a big fan! I don't see why I don't make it throughout the year... Would be awesome next pork chops too.

This was super easy, but needed a little more flavor. I added some garlic and onion powder and cayenne to give it a little more something. Overall, reallly good.

This is an excellent corn dish that is 'something different.'  I did however make a few changes.  I added some minced garlic, as well as salt and pepper to taste.  I also added diced jalapenos.  I'm a spicy girl so the hint of heat from the jalapenos is a great touch. :)  You can add green chilis instead of jalepenos if they are too hot for your liking.    Delicious!
