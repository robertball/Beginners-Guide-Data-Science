This really was a fairly basic egg salad that just added fresh green beans from our garden. Not bad but nothing special. If there is a next time, I will add some curry to it give it a little wow factor.

Yea! I'm the first to rate your recipe Jane! I loved this, especially now since I'm growing beans in my garden this summer and I'm always looking for recipes to use them in. I liked the fact that the beans kind of took the place of celery which made it even healthier. Thank you!!
