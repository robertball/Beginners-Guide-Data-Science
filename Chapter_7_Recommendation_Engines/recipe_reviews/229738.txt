Honestly, it didn't sound appetizing in the least (you should have seen the look of unenthusiasm on my husband's face when I told him what we were having for dinner), but WOW is it yummy! He requests it over and over again! We made quick work of shredding the squash by using a food processor, otherwise you risk losing a fingertip or two. We've also made the tomato and avocado into guac and used that as a topping and it was yummy as well! This one's a definite keeper :) Thanks so much for the awesome recipe!

This was so tasty. The store was out of acorn squash so we used a small butternut squash and it was awesome. I did not "fry" them, just a smidge of olive oil in a pan and they cooked nicely. I also forgot about the cheese entirely (until we ate the left overs) and it was still delicious. 
My husband liked them with a bit of taco sauce on top. A great recipe Thank you Becky!

This was incredibly delicious!!  I made a few changes.  1) I used coconut oil.  I NEVER use canola.  EVER.  2) I added about 4-5 cloves of fresh garlic.  3) Used brown rice tortilla.  3.  Used rice "cheese".  We are vegetarian, but I still eat eggs, so I did not change that up.This did take some time to prepare everything, but it cooked up rather quick, and easy.  And was just delicious.  I also added some sweet chili pepper sauce to top off the flavors!!  This is amazing!!

very nice change of pace from the standard (american/) mexican fare. i think some lime juice and fresh cilantro on top of it would be really great. probably will make it again sometime, but i didn't love it enough to spend all this time grating the squash again, for it to become a frequent meal in our house.

I made this recipe as written and it was delicious! A few days later I wanted to make it again but peeling the acorn squash was so difficult that I decided to omit it and used a sweet potato instead. I also didn't have another serrano chile so I used canned chopped green chiles. And since I was out of eggs, I substituted flax seed and a few tablespoons water. And it was still great!  Will definitely make again

Loved these!  Didn't miss the meat at all!  Could have been a bit more zippy, but I attribute that to some "cool" peppers.  Great recipe - worth the work to peel the squash.  Definite make again recipe - thank you Becky!

Hand shredding the squash was a pain, but absolutely worth the effort.  My kids didn't know that there wasn't any meat in the recipe and asked for more!

Delicious but labor-intensive. Not the best for leftovers.

Surprising use of acorn squash yielding a savory delight. This recipe is now our second favorite taco recipe (right below "Grilled Fish Tacos with Chipotle-Lime Dressing"). I'm so glad we tried this! I prepped the acorn squash for peeling by poking holes in it (as you would for a potato) and microwaving it for 3 minutes. Peeling took a while and grating took a while, so for us it was at least more like an hour start to finish. This is worth the effort though, we will definitely make this again.
