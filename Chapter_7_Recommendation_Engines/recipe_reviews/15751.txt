This fudge came out well, set perfectly, and tasted yummy. I didn't have the problem that the other Denver reviewer had, and my fudge looked great. My only problem was a significant one. The texture was a little embarrassing, as you wind up chewing on the sugar granules. Anyone who makes this recipe should use a very fine white sugar, and not the ordinary variety. If this is done, then the fudge should come out great.

Mine came out a bit gooey.  I had to freeze it before I could cut it up.  The marshmallow also seems to undermine the chocolate flavor.  I don't think I'll use this recipe again.

Really good but may need more cooking. I live in Denver and my fudge was a little runny.
