I too was disappointed by this.  The mixture didn't form a "burger" at all, and I ended up with more of a scramble.  Also, I think it may taste better if the veggies are sauteed first, as leaving them raw makes the "burger" rather crunchy.

Rather disappointing.  The mixture didn't hold together well enough to put on a bun and it was too spicy.

Thanks for a good recipe.I didn't have fresh basil so used a liberal amount of dried and served the burger on wheat toast with ketchup and lettuce. I think its important to remove water properly from zucchini, onion and celery, otherwise it will fall apart.  I reduced the amount of celery and used bread crumbs by approximation till it would form good burgers. And yes, I think a little bit of salt in the mixture adds to the taste.

Adding eggs to the recipe made the ingredients stick together a bit better, but this is still a mixture that falls apart. It tastes pretty good, but if you're expecting it to become a pattie you're out of luck. There is no way this stuff will stay together inside a bun. I had to serve it as just regular tofu stir-fry. Still, everyone enjoyed it so it's not too bad.

I had the same problem as many other people -- the mixture just didn't hold together. I even sauteed the vegetables before mixing them, but that didn't really help. What I ended up doing was just scrambling the entire mixture in a skillet to dry out the ingredients and then forming patties afterwards. My friend and I also tried baking them, but that won't work either unless the mixture is drier first. Tastewise, it was very bland (not sure if it was supposed to be that way). We added dry basil, seasoned pepper, and garlic salt for some flavor.

I sauteed the veggies as another reviewer suggested.  I thought they tasted very good but they didn't hold together and they looked unappetizing.

This was really good- although I made quite a few changes. First, I didn't have basil so I used parsely, a little mint and curry to spice it and then I liked the taste of it so much (I hadn't added the egg yet) that I decided to eat it as is, with some soy cheese in a wrap. Was fantastic! Also lower in fat and vegan (semi-raw). Maybe tomorrow I'll fry it....

I thought it was okay, not great, but then, I'm not a huge tofu fan either. People in my family who like tofu loved it! I'm sure if I make if more it'll grow on me!
Thanks:)

These were pretty tasty but def. had a kick to them.  They're a little messy so I fryed them and them baked them in the oven to get them cooked evenly.  They're actually better left over and without putting them on bread.

This does indeed make a very soft patty, but I did get it to form into a patty without any ingredient changes.  The issue for me was the cooking method.  It takes MUCH longer than 5 minutes to get a crust on the patty in order to be able to flip it over.. more like 10-15 minutes per side.  once I got the crust, there  was no problem.  Also,, it does need salt and next time I'd add more curry

This recipe turned out pretty good, but I didn't really follow it too well! All of these reviews were telling me that it falls apart way too easily! I seem to have corrected that problem! 

I ground up the tofu in the food processer. Then I boiled the carrots and onion to soften them and threw them into the food processer. I combined all of those ingedients and then added TWO eggs and the half cup of dry bread crumbs. I did not use zucchini or celery...because I did not have them, but I did have some leftover asparagus and cut up 3 stalks of that finely and added that to the mix. I added basil (but not fresh leaves as suggested, unfortunately), as well as a little Cumin, salt, pepper, and soy sauce, and one clove of garlic, cut finely. I mixed everything and then made patties and cooked as recipe suggested, and they turned out just great!

Even if the flavor is okay, this is not a burger. Unless you did not mean to use silken tofu, it is WAY too runny to form patties. I tried adding a cup of cooked rice, and extra cup of bread crumbs and it still had the wrong consistency.....

I used a potato press to remove the water from the shredded zucchini and I put the whole mixture through my food processor. We didn't have curry past so we just used kosher salt and lots of freshly ground pepper. It formed perfect burgers and tasted great!

This should not be called a burger- it did not hold together at all.

The taste was very average- just like minced sauteed vegetables

I will never make this again

We tried this recipe specifically to use up some tofu, carrots and fresh basil.  I am allergic to yeast, we chose to use rolled oats in place of the bread crumbs.  We also cut the curry paste in half.  Other than that, we followed the recipe as is.   We had already cubed the tofu for another recipe and based on some of the other reviews, we ground it up in the food processor since the recipe didn't indicate how to prepare it.  

As others have said, this did not stick together with just one egg.  Only having one egg on hand, we added about 3/4 cup blackberry puree in 1/4 cup increments as a substitute binding agent.  This didn't work, so it was off to the store.  Two more eggs later, we gave up on trying to make burgers and just made a scramble.  The flavor was okay - though we thought it was a bit bland (and we fried it in bacon grease because bacon makes everything better!)

LPT- make ahead of time and freeze them.  This will help keep the patties from falling apart.

I started with tofu that was previously frozen and well drained. I didn't add zucchini, since many complained about it falling apart and it doesn't add flavor. I used cilantro instead of basil for a bolder flavor and almond meal instead of bread crumbs. I let it rest for 10 minutes before cooking to let it absorb the meal, I also doubled the egg. Be careful not to flip them too soon, and only flip once or twice. I will make again.
