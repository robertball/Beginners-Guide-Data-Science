This is a delicious, spicy, quick and easy shrimp appetizer or dinner that is ready in only 10 minutes.  I like a medium spice level and the spice level was just right for me.  If you like a mildly spiced dish, I recommend cutting back on the cayenne.  Next time I think I would like to grill the shrimp instead.  Thanks for sharing the recipe SlimCookins.

This was absolutely delicious & super easy!! I mixed the spices up in a Ziploc bag & tossed the shrimp in it to fully coat before cooking. I cooked them about 1 1/2 minute per side on medium high. I served it with roasted vegetables (asparagus, fresh green beans, red bell pepper & grape tomatoes coated with a little olive oil & sprinkled with salt & pepper roasted in oven at 400 degrees on parchment paper for about 12-14 minutes)on top of leafy greens. I drizzled a little lime basil vinaigrette (Maple Grove of Vermont Fat-Free brand)over it all & sprinkled a little feta cheese over the top. Absolutely perfect for a summer meal, especially after a good workout!

Very good and so easy to adjust to your family's tastes. Paired with Garlic Rice from this site and was perfect with it.

I give a 5 star rating.  I used all the same ingredients but no salt at all.  I also added tomatoes,  bell pepper and scallions.  I served it with pasta that had been cooked with zesty Italian dressing.   After the plate was made I sprinkled shredded mozzarella cheese over the top.  Mom bon apetit.  Great,  easy quick cooking.

It is amazingly delicious and so simple. I added 2/4 teaspoons of Creole seasoning which made it spicier. It was awesome without being overwhelmingly spicier.

This seasoning is delicious!  When the shrimp finished cooking, I decided to take it out and make a quick gravy. I added about a tablespoon of flour then some chicken stock. When it was thick I added the shrimp back and then spooned over quick cook grits. Voila-  shrimp and grits!  The entire meal took maybe 10 minutes and I will be making this again!

I didn't have basil and I added smoked paprika. It was delicious but the smoked paprika obviously was the most prominent taste. Still like the mix of spices. I paired it with Chef John Classic rice pilaf and some simple baked asparagus (salt, pepper, olive oil and a bit of lemon). Thanks!

Absolutely 5 stars! Yummy! I had this for dinner last night and wished I was not on a diet so I could cook and gobble up the entire bag of shrimps!

Rather than go with a new Cajun seasoning, we use Creole Seasoning Blend by Joslyn from this site since it is kept on hand. We also add some Badia Blackened Redfish Seasoning (about 4 parts Creole to 1 part blackened seasoning). You can adjust the ingredients to get the level of spiciness/heat suitable to your taste preference. These spicy shrimp can be served as a snack with a beer or cocktail or made into a meal. Sometimes we simply combine them with rice and have a side dish such as broccoli and other times we’ve created a sweet & spicy dish by adding a sweet sauce such as Roasted Pineapple & Habanero Sauce or Pineapple Coconut Mango Tequila Sauce (both of which are made by Robert Rothchild Farms). So quick and easy to make, and these are always a hit so long as the person likes shrimp . . . this recipe works equally well with sea scallops.

This was really delicious...with light heat for an adult crowd.  And even more to the point was a really quick, fantastic hot appetizer to serve as guests got drinks and settled into conversation.  I didn't change any ingredients but to make things especially easy, mixed up the spices the day before and then added to peeled, cleaned shrimp a couple hours to marinate before cooking in a sauté pan with half butter/half EVO.  I also doubled the recipe. The shrimp were served with several cold appetizers/dips and noticed that a couple people added a bit of Chimichurri for just a bit more heat and fresh zing.  Will definitely make again and try as a main course with pasta or couscous. Thanks for this one!!!!

Tried this recipe a couple of days ago, and loved it so much that I am making
it again tonight.  Followed the recipe exactly except did not add salt. Have had problems with fresh shrimp being a bit salty and did not want to take chances. My husband says it is the best shrimp he has ever had. I will make this again and again, and will feel confident sharing with friends and family.
Served with a fresh orzo-vegetable salad and steamed asparagus. Delicious!!!

IThis was a good and simple recipe. I followed the recipe but only used 1 lb. Of shrimp. If you use the whole 1 1/2 lbs I would up the apices a bit. Not too spicy,  my elderly mom and 11 y.o. son gobbled it up!

Family really liked it!  I'm not a huge shrimp fan and I ate 5 which is 2 or 3 more than I usually do.  Really quick and easy and most people will have all ingredients on hand.  Followed recipe fairly closely...made a 2 pound bag of shrimp so had to up all spices slightly.  Will make again.  Served with fresh steamed asparagus, crescent rolls and salad.

Husband gives it a 5 star.  Me ... a 3 star b/c the oregano and thyme overpowered the taste (maybe that's what Cajun spice is supposed to taste like?).

Very good and simple! I didn't have oregano but I did throw in some cumin.  I coated the shrimp by putting them in a bag and working them around with the spice a little.  Half way through cooking in the pan I decided to throw in some jalepeno pieces.  I served over brown rice and it made a great meal!

We like a bit of sauce so near the end of the shrimp cooking I added 3 tablespoons of butter and splash of lemon juice to deglaze the pan.

Great recipe but I did tweet it up a lot. I used a ton more of the paprika, cayenne, and garlic powder. I didn't use any dried basil.  I also threw in some fried up  sliced cabbage, broccoli, garlic, hot peppers and some spicy Italian sausage.

Very good and easy to make!  I added cream after cooking the shrimp to make a spicy cream sauce that I served with angel hair pasta.  Turned out great!  Pretty spicy, but we like that!

Good to see a Cajun recipe that asks you to blend your own spices; I added a bit of extra black pepper and used smoked Paprika for the extra flavour.  Made some Hush Puppies to accompany - devilishly hot heaven on a plate!!

It was very good. I didn't have any cayenne pepper so I substituted some tony Catchers Cajun seasoning. It was good with just enough kick. Hubby enjoyed it as well.

This was really good! My husband and I love spicy, and this was tasty. I used 2.2 lbs shrimp and tripled the spices. It was a bit too hot for me, so I should have just doubled them, but I still enjoyed it. We have quite a bit left over, so we are going to make shrimp tacos with the remainder. Haha,  won't need any salsa on mine! Thanks for a yummy recipe!

Margaritaville brand used to (maybe still does but I havent seen it in 10 years) make this, and Ive been relentlesly trying to minic it forever. This is it! I actually doubled the spices which I realized later might be over kill but worked great (although I wont do that again). This is so amazing...... Yum!

I didn't make any changes at all to the recipe. I like to try them exactly as they're written the first time, then if I'm not 100% happy I might try to tweak them. No changes needed with this one for my family! Don't be intimidated by the pepper, it's not too spicy at all. I LOVE spice, but my husband just can't take it and he loved this recipe. His words, "there's just enough  cayenne to give it a great taste." Honestly, if I ever make it just for myself I'll probably add a little more, but for my family as a whole the spices are perfect. Thanks so much for a fantastic recipe that will be served again and again in my home!

I ended up using whiting instead of shrimp due to cost, but still came out great. My Creole clan loved the flavor and it was sooo easy to prep. Next time I'll save up to use as much shrimp as possible for sure.

I served it with steamed/seasoned green beans and parmesan butter-noodles.

It was so delicious. I actually put the spices on last night and refrigerated the shrimp.  The shrimp were the tastiest shrimp I ever ate. This is my "Look No Further" shrimp recipe. I made brown rice and mixed vegetables to go along with the shrimp. Perfect!

This was so easy and fast to make. I had frozen precooked shrimp in the freezer so used that instead of fresh. Im sure it would be even better fresh. I halved the recipe and used a bit extra garlic since I love garlic. But overall, recipe is delicious, and calorie-counting friendly!

Easy and fast way to cook up some shrimp. I skipped the thyme, not a fan. Otherwise, spicy and delicious. I added some vegetables such as onions, squash, zucchini and mushrooms!!
Fried the veggies in a little sesame oil, removed from pan, fried the shrimp, and then combined back together!!

The recipe was quick and easy to follow. I like spicy favors so I added hot  peppers. I gave this recipe a 4 stars.

Quick and simple recipe! We like heat so I increased the amount of spices. Very versatile dish too, I tossed in a can of diced tomatoes and poured the cooked mixture over pasta, will try it over rice next time. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent and easy.  What more could a person want?  I put the shrimp on top of brown rice and served alongside some collard greens.

My family really enjoyed the flavor. My daughter isn't a shrimp fan, but she said, "you need to make this more often". I almost doubled the cayenne pepper, as we like things spicy. It was perfect.

Easy and so quick - spent the most time peeling and deveining the shrimp, and that did not take long.  I didn't have thyme, so I just omitted it.  I substituted about 3/4 tsp Tony Chachere's creole seasoning for the salt, pepper and cayenne plus I added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes.   Instead of using a skillet, I stir-fried the shrimp in my wok, which is non-stick, and I used canola oil.  I served the shrimp  with Zatarain  Caribbean packaged rice .  Next time I make this, I may follow another reviewer's lead and use this for shrimp tacos!

Yum! I think I would use a little less cayenne pepper next time, because this has some serious heat, but otherwise no changes. Lightning fast and healthy too. Instant favorite!

We keep kosher, so substituted the shrimp for "not-shrimp" (fish made to look and taste like shrimp).  No black pepper in the house (!) so left it out, no Cayenne pepper, so used regular red pepper instead.  I used 3/4 t (I love hot/spicy food!).  It was so good!  We used it as an appetizer, and 8 pieces were not enough for the 4 of us.  Will definitely make again!  It was best warm, but it was good room temp too.

I used this recipe to make shrimp tacos but i put in a few extra ingredients and it was great along with guac, cole slaw, lett, tomatoes and cheese. 
What a hit with the family. Fresh lemonade was the perfect drink to go along.

Excellent and Easy Recipe!  Phenomenal taste for how little effort goes into making the meal.  Made exactly as the recipe states!  Once it was done we tossed it over a wild rice stir fry with tons of veggies.

This is easy and delicious!  I would not use as much thyme as I don't care for it.  But it is so quick to make.  It probably needs to cook a bit longer--5-6 minutes, but the shrimp are very tender regardless.  This will be a go-to recipe for me.

Very good recipe! I did not make as many shrimp but still used the same amount of spice and that was way too spicy. But the flavor was good and it was extremely fast and easy to make. I will definitely make it again!

Loved this. It was a hit with my husband and toddler. I decreased the cayenne pepper a bit (for the toddler's sake), used canola oil, and it was still delicious. Quick, easy, and flavorful. Paired it with baked sweet potatoes and the sweetness complemented the shrimp nicely. Also made some garlic bread to dip into the leftover oil & herbs. Rave reviews all around.

This is such a great, quick recipe. I will be adding it to the rotation. No brainer, and such a nice option for those nights you haven't planned ahead. If you keep shrimp on hand, chances are you'll have all the other ingredients! Yum.

This is a very quick and easy recipe with great results overall.  I took out the cayenne pepper only because my young children dislike spicy food at this point.  I'm excited to try it will all ingredients next time, and I would recommend this recipe to family and friends.

This was so good!  I made it as is (well, except I used canola oil instead of veg because it's all I had...pretty minor, in my opinion).  Not sure why people thought it lacked flavor--plenty of flavor and a wonderful, just right amount of heat.  I cooked it in a cast iron skillet, and the light browning added perhaps a little amount of taste.  
Also, I took another reviewers idea of pairing it with the Garlic Rice recipe and it was a total hit.  Will be keeping this in my repertoire as a regular dish in our house!

Fantastic. I am not a good cook. This literally took 10 minutes to prepare and was delicious. I halved the recipe and substituted a pre-made BBQ rub  + dash of hot sauce for the cayenne/paprika.  Also prepared with pre-cooked shrimp and just cut the frying time down to 2 minutes. Turned out awesome, will definitely make again.

Mmm... . is my user name,  and yes this dish was just that!  I'm on a health kik right now and this recipe was perfect.   The only change I made was to cook it on the grill I'm trying to cut as much oil out as possible.  Thank you.

Everyone loved the shrimp!! Just the right amount of heat. I skewered the shrimp and broiled them instead of frying in oil. I also added a tsp of old bay to the seasoning.

This was the easiest and best recipe ever!   Husband loved it and it was so quick too!   Made it with a side of pasta, but might try rice next time. Wish I could give it 10 stars!

Fantastic, easy. I added the base ingredients and a bit of panko. Mixed butter and oil in the pan. Let them sit on each side until crispy. Yum.

This was absolutely fantastic. LOVED it. I had it over brown rice. This is going to become a habit for me. In fact, I'm going to mix up a larger batch of the spices so I don't have to mix it up each time, and I'll just take the proper percentage out of the container to mix with the shrimp that particular night. Thanks very much for posting it!

This was a little too spicy for me.  My husband loved it but it was so spicy for me that I couldn't even eat it.  However, I washed the shrimp off after he cooked them and they tasted fantastic.  Just different taste buds.  The recipe itself is excellent.  Great flavor.  Next time (and there WILL be a next time) we'll use less seasoning.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was great. The only thing I did differently was I added a little more Cajun seasoning.

It was quick and easy, but there wasn't much depth to the flavor. The spice was nice but next time I may add something to round out the flavors like a smoked olive oil or  - like another reviewer said - grill/broil the shrimp instead. We served it with oven roasted brussels sprouts and a barely chilled NZ sauvignon blanc.
