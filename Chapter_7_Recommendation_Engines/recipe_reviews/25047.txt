Easy! Easy! EASY!!!  Just remember to chill the dough in wax paper for about 45 minutes for "bakery cookie" results!

I LOVE these cookies.  I made a similar recipe years ago, but lost the recipe in a move.  When I made them they were called Cookie Monster Cookies and came out of a Sesame Street Cookbook but now all Cookie Monster Cookies are those with M & M's and oatmeal, peanut butter, etc.  These cookies remind me of Sugar cookie cakes sort of, thicker than normal cutout cookies usually are and sweet with a tender texture.  I didn't roll mine in sugar, but dipped a glass in sugar and used it to flatten.  These are great frosted!

This is a wonderful cookie!  However, we used butter, not shortening. We rolled the dough in colored sugar for Christmas.  The dough is gooey at first, but if you let it sit for just a little bit, it turns out perfectly!!!

My daughter needed cookies to take to school for chirstmas party and we wanted to make cookies from scratch so we tried these.  This recipe was easy to make and very delicious.  We chose to use cookie cutters to make christmas shapes and found that we had to put the dough in the refridgerator for a while before rolling out the dough but they turned out wonderful!  Great recipe!

This recipe was wonderful. The dough was a little oily when being formed into balls, but I added a pinch of four to my hands in order to make them less gooie. There was a small hint of saltyness to the cookies, but I was using a coarser salt, be sure to use the finest ground salt you can find and I'm sure you won't have the same problem. I also used the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar to flatten the cookie before cooking. They turned out PERFECTLY sweet, light & delightful! This one is a keeper!

I've been looking for a sugar cookie recipe as well as a shortbread recipe.  My daughter made these - by herself- and they came out awesome.  She used margerine instead of shortening and in my opinion they tasted like a cross between sugar cookies and shortbread cookies.

used the recipe to make cutout cookies and the dough was very sticky. needed more time in the fridge.  However with a little flour we were able to cut them out.  Had a 6 yr old and 4 year old helping.   Overall an easy recipe that tasted great

Awesome! These cookies are a bit like shortbread in texture. They are so tasty and easy to make! I did not sprinkle with sugar before popping in the oven, but they were still amazing cookies. Thank you, MECHSGAL!

this cookie was OK, although they were moist and fluffy they lacked flavor. butter probably would have enhanced flavor. i did chill the dough for about 45 min which always seems to work better for me.

Even with flatening the cookies they puff up like a biscut, they were soft and gooie first out of the oven but they quickly hardened and not only looked like biscuts but my husband ate it not knowing it was a cookie and said "man this biscut sucks" I didnt have the heart to tell him it was suppose to be a cookie and tossed them out right there.

This cookie is flavorless but easy to make, I would add butter or margarine instead of just shortening. I am an avid cookie maker and I like to try new cookies, this one I did not add to my cook book- no flavor what so ever- but on the plus side it is easy. Maybe adding a spice like ginger or a flavor of peppemint or even chocolate chips might add something but as it stands- not good...Sorry

I really did not enjoy these cookies.  My 3 year old thought they were great but he'll say that about any cookie.  I found them flavorless, and I even added a touch more vanilla.  I may try them again and use butter or marg. instead of the shortening.

I had to make two minor changes out of necessity:  swapped the shortening for butter, and I didn't have brown sugar, so just used white.  These were GREAT cookies.  Soft, light, great for dipping in milk.  I made my own colored red and green sugar from a recipe on this site.  Also, 1/2 inch balls sounded awful small to me, so mine were more walnut sized.  Turned out great, I will definitely be making these again...YUM!

These cookies are perfect because they are not too sweet but still have a pretty good flavor. Sometimes I add some almond extract and they taste even better!

My 12 year-old daughter made these by herself. Great for young cooks, she had to use margarine because we were out of shortening, then she got a littel impatient waiting for the dough to get workable, so she added about 1/3 cup of flour. They came out like cookie cakes, great under strawberries as a shortcake, or for ice cream sandwiches. The second batch was cookies, those were great too.

These were pretty yummy! I made the batter as far as I could without the extract and split it in three different bowls. In one I used vanilla extract, in another I used lemon extract, and in the third I used imitation almond extract. All three were delicious, but the Almond cookies were my favorite! This is a good recipe. The brown sugar adds a nice touch.

Easy, tasty and requires only ingredients you always have on hand - and cheap! Good for bake sales since you can afford to make lots. Colored sugar makes them pretty. Thanks.

FABULOUS! I did a drop cookie version of this and they came of excellent! They're soft and chewy and DELICIOUS! The only thing I'm going to do is add a 1/4 of a teaspoon of lemon extract because I like a hint of lemon...but I may decide I like the original recipe more! TRY THESE!

I make these cookies all the time for misc. reasons, and they always go over really well!! You can spice these cookies up for the holidays by adding some nutmeg, cinamon and ginger.

I tried this recipe because I was low on ingredients and the kids wanted cookies. I was really surprised at how good and quick they are.

This turned out great, AFTER refrigerating the dough for a while. Very soft and delicious, just need to chill the dough to make it more manageable.

Really good and easy! I made these for Valentine's day. I put them in the fridge for an hour before using heart-shaped cookie cutters. They came out great, thanks for sharing.

These turned out Great... everyone in my family loved them.  I only put 1/2 cup shortening and the rest butter.  I added a cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Also, added some cocoa to part of the batch and it also turned out great. Yum.. will use recipe again.

They really are tastless. All I could think of as I was eating them was how the taste of shortning is gross. I would recommend using butter instead and even adding ginger. :(

These cookies are so easy to make and they have a wonderful buttery taste.  I made a double batch and found the batter to be a bit sticky to work with, so I just added an extra 1/2 cup flour and they were perfect!! (this did not affect the taste)  I also found that these cookies freeze nicely and still keep their lovely texture and flavor.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.

I was looking for a kid friendly sugar cookie and this proved to be it! My 9 and 6 year old little girls baked these with a minimum of supervision from mom--I put them in and got them out of the oven and they did the rest. The oldest three children happily helped eat them.

I substituted the shortening with butter and these turned out very well.  I also made a batch with 2 teaspoons of anise EXTRACT and that made them VERY tasty (but no longer a straight sugar cookie anymore)

The cookie tastes pretty bad.  I think if you replace the shortening with butter it would have been fine, but the shortening taste is pretty awful.

Made this recipe with my little sister! A very good recipe but suggest something that won't make dough so crumbly when about to scoop them onto the pan!!! ;)

These cookies were okay in a pinch. I probably wouldn't make them for guests but they satisfied my cookie craving. The second batch I experimented with a chocolate candy bar. I just broke it up into pieces since I didn't have any chocolate chips. This improved the taste a little. I'll save this recipe since it was so easy and I always have the ingredients on hand.

These cookies were delicious and easy to make.  I would reccommend flattenig each ball more than just "slightly". I found that pressing about as much as you would for peanut butter cookies worked well.  But overall, this is a great recipe.

Excellent. I have never tasted such great ginger cookies.
