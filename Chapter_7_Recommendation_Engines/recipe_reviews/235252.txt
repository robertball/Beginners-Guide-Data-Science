These were tasty! Very soft and sweet.  The persimmon flavor is very faint. My only complaint with this recipe is I ended up almost doubling the bake time. I have a very old gas oven so it could have to do with my antiquated kitchen equipment. Thanks for the recipe!

I made the recipe exactly as written, using fuyu variety persimmons fresh from my backyard.  The texture of the cookies was good - soft, with a good chewiness added from the oats.  But the flavor was just not what I was hoping for. It was a little on the salty side, and even with the toffee bits, they are not sweet enough for me (and my 3yo son spit it out and said it was yucky).  I'm new to persimmons, so I don't have much recipe experience to compare to, but I couldn't taste the flavor of persimmon at all- just the spices (and salt) I added in.  And that was disappointing for me, because I could achieve that with applesauce if I wanted to. Anyway, my search for a great persimmon cookie recipe continues, I suppose.

Just  made these cookies and they came out great. They are soft and moist. I used 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and loved it!

Moist and delicious! I made my own puree from overripe fuyu persimmons in a food processor. I also used only 1/2 t. of salt and cut up 1 1/2 heath bars which worked great! I used an ice cream scoop about 2 inches in diameter and the cookies needed about 20 minutes to bake. I love the texture of the outside a little firm/crisp and the inside stays really moist.
