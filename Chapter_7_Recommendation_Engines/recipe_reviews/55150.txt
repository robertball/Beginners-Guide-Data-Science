I live in Montréal and married a French Canadian so I can vouch for the fact that this is not a recipe for pouding (not a typo) chomeur.  The word "dumpling" gives it away because pouding chomeur is a cake.  My mother-in-law immediately identified this recipe as "Grandpère dans le sirop".

Great recipe.  I wanted to make something other than a usual dessert and this was perfect.  Incredibly easy to make and great tasting.  Next time, I will cut the baking powder in half though.  I could taste the baking powder too much.  Other than that, my husband and I loved this dessert.

Tonight I reheated the leftovers in the microwave for 1 1/2 minutes and had it for dessert with vanilla ice cream on the side.  I also sprinkled a little sugar over the Pudding Chomeur.  My husband and I thought it was delicous.  It's been about three days since I initially made this recipe and the leftover Pudding Chomeur was still great reheated!  I will definetly make this again.

Lovely.  I cut the sugar with a little dark rum.   I know that rum takes away from the cultural purity of the whole thing, but it was really good.  Especially with a little milk poured over in the end.

Very easy, very rich, and I halved the recipe and still came out with more than enough for 4 people.  This is kind of like a dumpling version of creme brule.

OMG... My husband and I just made this up hoping that it would taste like what we get when we visit the Cabane a Sucre and it was fantastic!! Absolutely what we were hoping for.  Thank you for a great recipe!

not so bad. It did come out way too doughy and white on top which was not appealing at all. I put it in the oven uncovered for a few minutes and it made all the difference! Nice and golden, it stuck hard to the pan though. They did enjoy it after I broiled it, so I would suggest broiling the top b4 serving.

This is so very good and will make it again. Love how the dumplings become like a cake layer and sauce is underneath. I used self rising flour since I forgot to replenish the all purpose and it came out great. We added half a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and it was perfect! Thanks for sharing.

Awesome!  My family just loved this dessert!  My son was a little skeptical, but once he tried it he was hooked!  I will definitely make this again!

I'm glad I tried this, but I probably won't make it again. It was overwhelmingly sweet, and I could only eat a little bit, and I have all kinds of leftovers- I even scaled the recipe down to serve only 2.
