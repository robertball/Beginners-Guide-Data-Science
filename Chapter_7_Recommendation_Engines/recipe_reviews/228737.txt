I pressed the crust into the pan using a square pan and baked for 10 minutes. Then added the rest of ingredients and baked as directed. Excellent results.

I made these for a Halloween party and they were a hit! The only issue I had was that they were very soft so they fell apart easily. Otherwise, very tasty!

These were really good. I made them for my husband's club meeting and everyone loved them. I didn't change anything for the first batch, very unusual for me! Next time I would add a few more apples. Not sure why others said they didn't hold together as bars, I did refrigerate them for a short time before cutting.

Delicious and easy! I didn't have premade caramel sauce, so I used the "Oh-So-Easy Caramel Sauce" recipe from this site in its place. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the crumbles.

I brought these to a party, and they were very popular! I overheard people telling others to go try them because they were so good. However, they aren't really "bars" because they fell apart, which was annoying when I tried to arrange them on a plate for serving. If the base had actually stayed together for these, I would give them five stars.

I made these bars for a treat at work, and everyone gobbled them up. They are especially good if warmed up slightly in the microwave just before eating.

These were a flop. Followed directions exactly. Crumb crust had a bitter taste. Definately needed more flavor, maybe some cinnamon and definately more sweetener.  Kinda pricey with the cost of all the apples and the 16oz tub of caramel. Sorry guys...huge dissappointment. 1 Star. *

Made these for my co-workers and they gobbled them up! I took another reviewer's advice and baked the crust first for ten minutes and added the apples and Carmel sauce,and crumbs. They fell apart but still tasted great. I didn't have shortening,so I substituted organic coconut oil instead. I also couldn't find the Carmel dip listed for this recipe,but found Carmel sauce and it still was great. I will be making these all through the fall season!

I decreased the brown sugar to 1 cup, used 1/2 cup of apple sauce in replacement for some of the butter, and I didn't add flour to the caramel. I just popped it in the microwave for 30 seconds to soften it and then spread it around. I used golden delicious apples, and man, it truly was delicious! I had no issues with the crust falling apart, but I did make this in a 9x13 pan, as I don't have the one specified, and I think it was too thick. So the only change I would make next time would be to decrease the flour and oatmeal that went into the crust. Apple, caramel bar gooiness! Had it with vanilla ice cream and it was to die for.

Made as written.  Falls apart, not a bar.  May try again but mix it all together and pat in pan. Drizzle with carmel on top
