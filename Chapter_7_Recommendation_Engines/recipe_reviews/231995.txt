I made this with Parmesan, although I doubled the bread and cheese because the avocado was large.  And there was still a lot of spread for 4 pieces of bread.  This made a great breakfast or lunch because it kept me full for a long time.

This is one thing I eat most for breakfast, with a little modification. I toast a slice of dark rye in the toaster oven, slice half an avocado and spread on the toast, sprinkle with a few grinds of sea salt, then for an extra boost of protein I add a fried or poached egg (cooked yolk). Tastes amazing and very filling!

I thought this was just alright. It made for a quick and easy lunch today with some soup. Just seemed like something was missing. It was almost like the beginnings of a sandwich, but the other ingredients were not listed. I have mashed avacado with a little garlic salt and put it on a tortilla. That worked for me. Maybe, it was the cheese with this, I don't know. It was an affordable lunch anyhow. ty

Perfect combination of flavors. I eat a lot of avocados and toast but I never thought of combining the two. I will be making this toast again. Thank you Sarah Ruiz.

Yesterday I made guacamole but did not realise that we had no chips for nachos. I made a version of my favorite sandwich: on Ezekial bread, place a slice of muenster cheese, on top place thinly sliced mushrooms and red onions.  Toast until bubbly and you like the way it looks.  Take out of toaster oven or oven, sprinkle some hot sauce and top with many slices of avocado (or leftover guacamole).

Very good, and it would get a 5 star rating if you suggested buttering the bread first.

Combined this recipe with Asian Avocado by Josie stirred the avocado into the sauce before spooning onto the toast. Works fine in toaster oven on toast.

A Dutch friend showed me how they make avocado toast.  They just toast a hearty bread or crusty Italian loaf.  Slice the avocado and spread around the toast.  Salt and pepper.  Enjoy.
This is better for heart patients like me.

I mashed the avocado with s & p and a few dashes of  Cholula hot sauce. Then toasted slice  French bread with 1 oz asiago cheese. Once cheese melted to my liking I took out of toaster oven and spread avocado on top. This was delish, quick & very filling.

This is quick, easy, and delicious! The only variation I made from the original recipe, was to add some tomato slices on top of the cheese before I put it in the oven. This on is on my "do it more often list"!

My  wife recently discovered this similar recipe on her own.  We love rye bread with the seeds, and she loves avocados.   She simply toasts the bread, puts some butter or margarine on top, then places the sliced avocado between the slices.  She has been raving about this since she discovered it a few weeks ago.  I will share this development and try it on my own with a variety of cheeses (like cheese more than avocados).

Thoroughly enjoyed this!  Simple and easy and very filling.  I did drizzle a little bottled lite Italian dressing on the bread before adding the cheese, otherwise I made it as written.  I will be making this again.

Good hot or cold but needs a splash of hot sauce to complete it! Or make some guacamole and use that as both are delicious on toast!

I used Dave's Bread (the thin kind). I also put parmesan on the toast as suggested by someone.
