I was pleasantly surprised at the results of this recipe. I did add 1/2 of a diced zucchini and 1/2 of a diced yellow squash, which I sauteed with the celery and onion. We used small tortillas to make mini-burritos.
I will definitely keep this one to use again!

These were great!  My husband does not like celery so I went light on it...he could still taste it so I will eliminate it next time (at least in his portion).  Otherwise the texture and taste were great,  did not make them spicy for the kids.  We added avocado, green onion, sour cream, cheddar and green avocado salsa as toppings.  Yum will make again.

Really tasty. My only sub was black beans for the red beans, used what I had in cupboard. I wasnt sure how all that celery would be, but it was great. I didnt miss meat at all

I liked these but my husband wasn't super keen on them, though he isn't super keen on beans in general.

My family and I decided to try this recipe to explore healthy eating options. The ingredients are kitchen staples (no unobtainium) and the recipe was quick to make. I didn't have an issue with the meal. The reason it didn't get a perfect rating was I was hard pressed to remember the meal only days after I ate it.

The taste and texture of the mixture was good but too much chili powder!!! I cut the amount to 2 tea spoons and was still very hot. I didn't season with hot sauce at the end.Instead of salt I used a half of a table spoon of chicken bullion. I added half of a green pepper that was cooked with the onions and celery.I will make it again but definitely I will cut down the chili.
