I have one thing that I do every time I cook salmon.  I always make a little foil packet for each fillet and close it up, leaving a little room for air to circulate inside.  If you bake the foil packets on a cookie sheet at 425 for about 15 minutes (slightly longer depending on number of fillets), the salmon cooks to perfection every time!  This is a great recipe to use when preparing salmon in foil packets... it poaches gently in its on juices and always comes out so tender and delicious!

My husband really liked this one. I used 1/3 c. lemon juice and 1/4 tsp. black pepper instead of the lemon pepper. I cut the soy sauce to 1/4 c. to lesson the salt flavor and used only 1 T. olive oil to cut calories. I also sprayed the grill plate with olive oil to keep the salmon from sticking.  Turned out wonderfully.

FANTASTIC! We live in Alaska, and have lots of salmon to eat.  We are always looking for the next great Salmon Recipe.  This one is now our favorite.  Try it, you WILL like it.  My only suggestion is to grill the fish, flesh side down first (facing the hot coals).  This allows the brown sugar to glaze the fish and seal in the moisture.  Then after about 7 minutes, flip the fish over with the skin side down facing the hot coals.  Don't worry about sticking to the grill, the oil in the recipe help to make this not a problem.  Enjoy....Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe.  Be sure to use plain Lemon Pepper and not Lemon Pepper Seasoning Salt (you will oversalt if you do).  If grilling is rained out, this can be baked in a 450 degree oven for 12 minutes, and then broiled for 5 minutes.  The soy sauce and brown sugar blend wonderfully with the salmon flavor.

YUM! This is one of the best marinades I have tasted for salmon! I'd rather stay home and make this than pay for salmon at a restaurant with this recipe! The longer you marinate it - the better. I tried grilling this on a bbq - and it came out very good but didn't hold the seasoning in well (even though I wrapped it in foil). The second time, I wrapped it in foil again and broiled it in the oven - and the marinade really stuck. I use both the lemon pepper seasoning AND fresh lemon juice. I will make this recipe over and over again - especially since I live in the great Northwest where salmon is abundant. I think this would taste good with other types of fish also.

This is now a staple in our low-fat home.  I substituted olive oil for vegetable oil and it worked beautifully.  Also, leftovers can be sauteed in a little olive oil and fresh lemon juice, and it's even better the second time around!!  Try the Dill Sauce recipe with it - Yum!!

This is my FAVORITE marinade for salmon!  My whole family raves over it and it is SO easy!  One tip - I grill the fish with the skin down first to capture the juices, when I flip it over the skin just peels off!  Even people that don't like fish - love this recipe!

Must agree.  I have used this recipe for years and have a tip for the grillers.  Place the salmon side, skin side down, on aluminun foil.  Grill for 8 minutes on medium heat.  When it's time to turn, grab a long edge of the foil, sliding it off the fire and flip the fish gently onto the hot part of the grill.  Gently remove the foil, and, viola, the skin comes right off.  Brush on some more marinade at this point.  Cover the grill and cook 7 more minutes.  Mmmmmmm....

I made a variation.  I used honey crystals rather than brown sugar (that's what I had on hand).  In addition, I sprinkled the salt and lemon pepper seasoning on the fish.  Finally, I cooked it in a hot skillet on top of the stove with the remainder of the marinade from the bag plus a little water.  By the time the marinade had reduced the fish was tender and flaky and among the tastiest dishes I have ever made.  A very forgiving recipe that really tastes great.

My 4-year old begs me to make this! I followed the advice of another reviewer and usually bake this in a 450 degree oven for 12 minutes and broil for 5 minutes. I also transfer the marinade to a saucepan to make a yummy gravy by adding 1 T. of corn starch and bringing to a boil. Serve with rice for an absolutely super meal!

LOVE IT!!  Yummmmmyyyy.....VERY good recipe!  The whole family loved it (including a VERY picky husband).  My kids loved it!  The only substitution I made was extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable and I baked it in the oven at 450 for 12 mins and then broiled for 5 mins.  (It was TOO cold to go out and BBQ).  This one is a keeper and I have already shared this recipe with several of my friends. Thanks:)

this is a very good recipe.  definitely save the marinade and cook it separately.  add some cornstarch to thicken it and pour it over the salmon as a gravy.  the flavor is a little light just the way it is right now.  the gravy would make it perfect.  serve it with rice and have the rice soak up that sweet and savory salmon gravy.  very yummy.  you also if you dont have time just bake the salmon plain then use the marinade to make a gravy to pour over the salmon.  still works

This was great.  I skinned the salmon before marinating it overnight, used lemon juice and pepper (instead of lemon pepper), light soy sauce, and olive oil (instead of vegetable oil).  Cooked them in foil packets at 425 for 12 minutes, served with steamed green beans, sauteed, herbed red potatoes, and sauvignon blanc.  Delicious!

My husband said this was better than any salmon he has ever had!  I only marinated for about an hour and it still turned out good.  I have a basket to put on the grill so it is easy to flip the fish over without it sticking.  I put all the seasonings in with the liquids too, and it turned out great!

I used ¼ cup of pure maple syrup in lieu of the brown sugar. My choice of soy sauce was "low sodium".  Added a dash of cayenne pepper (ground chili) to up its tanginess index and rubbed the fish down with all the ingredients incl. the oil. Skipped the lemon pepper and the salt.  Baked in an open, lightly oiled Pyrex dish at 450ºF (10 min. per inch of thickness).  Even without marinating this is a superb dish, a keeper; thanks!

My husband loved this, but I found it far too sweet.  If I make this again I'll add lots of ginger and maybe some sriracha to balance the sweetness.

I've been making this for a couple of years now and it is FANTASTIC ~ every time!  Instead of grilling I put it in individual foil packets and bake at 425 for 15-20 minutes and it is fool proof... seriously, you cannot mess it up and it is delicious.

I used a frozen fillet of salmon and baked it in foil.  I sprinkled brown sugar, garlic powder, lemon pepper and salt on the bottom and then put the fillet down.  I pushed the sides of the foil up and sprinkled the seasonings on again and then mixed the soy sauce, water & olive oil and poured it on top and sealed it in.  I cooked it on a baking sheet in the foil at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  It was moist and delicious!!!

I've made this salmon twice, never altering the recipe and both times it was FANTASTIC!  I did follow the recommendation of another reviewer and grilled it fleshside down first (skin up) and this creates a nice carmalization of the marinade.  When done the meat slid right off the skin.  

The first time I made this, I only marinated it for the minimum of two hours, and it was really good.  The second time I marinated the salmon all day and it was even better!  

A must add to the salmon recipes!

I have made this salmon recipe - exactly as written here - for family (both immediate and extended) and for friends... dozens of times over the past several years.  I will never... I repeat NEVER... make salmon with any other recipe other than this one.  So simple, yet so delicious.  My two sons ask me to make it for them all the time; I would, except buying quality salmon isn't inexpensive.  I have found that our local Costco has some of the freshest salmon available here in the desert southwest... plus, I like that their salmon comes skinless.  (Just a matter of taste, but I'm not a big fan of skin on fish of any kind.).  UPDATE:  11/1/14:  In my opinion, this Is THE best recipe on AR!

WoW!  You will love this recipe. I have been using this for years and everyone I serve it to just raves! I substitute a lemon garlic spice blend for the lemon pepper and I throw in a generous amount of minced garlic as well. We liked the recipe as submitted, but we all love garlic, so we decided to make the change.  You will not regret trying this recipe!

This marinade was absolutely delicious!  I actually baked 6 oz. salmon filets, so I made some modifications.  Added a couple splashes of lemon juice to the mixture, instead of seasoning the filets directly with lemon pepper.  I also used jarred minced garlic to taste.  Let the filets marinate for two hours, then wrapped them along with the all of the juice in tin foil and baked on 375 for 35 minutes.  Outstanding!!!

Excellent salmon recipe!  I was a little worried after I made the marinade and tasted a little.  But I thought, "hey, 823 people can't be wrong".  Two hours and 15 minutes later I found out they weren't.  Everything plays together really nicely, and it was a definite hit at my house.  I took the advice of others who don't have grills, and 425 for 15 in a foil packet was perfect.

I first seasoned the salmon portions with salt, garlic podwer, freshly squeezed lemon juice and subsituted the Lemon peper with Club's House Lemon & Herb Mix (which contains onions, parsely, pepper, lemon shavings, etc.)

I then marinated the portions for 3-4 hours (frequently stirring up the sauce) A tip, do NOT FORGET TO ADD SALT. I tested a portion without and the salt adds to the sweet & salty factor even with the soy sauce.

I then wrapped the portion in foil underneath a bed of circular cut zucchini and lemon slices and baked for 10 minutes under 350.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC! Paired it with some parma sprinkled asparagus and rizotto mozza/basil balls!

After grilling, I brought the leftover marinade to a low boil on the stove and added cornstarch to make a thicker glaze that we had at the table for people to pour over their salmon.  What a hit!  Even people who didn't like salmon had seconds!

This almost got a 4 star rating but I'm giving it a five because it WAS very good.  Technique in grilling has something to do with how it tastes in the end.  If you don't get it crunchy, with the sauce carmelized, the taste is not the same.  (Some fillets were and some weren't... still learning how to grill it effectively).

I get similar (tastier) results when I marinate salmon in Yoshida's Gourmet sauce so I may just do that next time because it's easier and quicker.  But if I run out of Yoshida sauce, this is a great marinade from scratch for salmon.

The next day we had the leftover salmon with pasta and alfredo sauce... yum.

This marinade is a dominant flavor, and goes toe-to-toe with flavorful salmon pretty well; with any other kind of fish, it would be a one-note dish. This recipe is ideal if your audience includes folks who don't like salmon -- the taste of the salmon is still there, but muted. However, if you're serving only people who love salmon, find a different recipe that will let the salmon shine.

This was fantastic!  I seared it in olive oil on the stove, then put the pan in the oven at 425 for 15 minutes to finish cooking, then served on a bed of spring mix salad greens.  I reserved the remaining marinade and brought to a boil, then removed from the heat and added rice wine vinegar to made a salad dressing.  Will definitely make this again!

This is an excellent recipe for grilled salmon. I always grill this instead of pan frying because of the great crust that forms. Marinade it for 24 hours.If you boil the left over marinade you can use this for your sauce. Try adding some toasted sesame seeds to top it  off.

Oh My!  I'm a HORRIBLE cook, but this was part of the best meal I have ever, ever made--and the easiest too!  Since I live in an apartment and can't have a grill, I made it in a foil packet in my oven and let me just tell you--it was the most amazingly moist salmon ever.

PHENOMENAL marinade.  I also baked it for 20 minutes in foil at 425 instead of grilling, the broiled a couple of minutes to brown.  So moist and flavorful.  Don't throw out the extra marinade!  Reduce it on the stove and add some flour to thicken, along with a tad more brown sugar to sweeten it. It creates a perfect soy reduction glaze to sprinkle over each filet that makes the dish a show stopper.  Rave reviews!  Will make this again and again.

After all the accolades I read about on this recipe, i had to try it. We had very high-quality salmon that we had caught and i was worried that the marinade would cover up the natural flavor of the salmon, but it didn't. I marinated it for 10 hours and put it in a fish basket which i would definitely recommend to keep it from falling apart. Everybody raved about it. I liked it because it was so simple. Thanks!

This is the most amazing recipe for salmon I have ever had.  This recipe beats out any fish I have had at any restaurant.  My family likes it as much as I do.  I make no changes to the recipe other than the initial cooking.  If the salmon has skin, I cook it on aluminum foil on the grill skin side down in the marinade for 5 minutes.  The skin will stick to the aluminum foil when ready and remove the skin for you.  I just use a spatula and flip it right onto the grill.  I like to cook on high heat so the brown sugar caramelizes and the salmon is still moist.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a very easy and delicious recipe.  I used all of the oil but next time I will cut it in half.  I also used light soy sauce which tasted fine.  It was cold out tonite so I broiled the fish in the oven for about 12 minutes and it came out delicious.  I marinated it for 3 hours but next time I will do it overnight or for at least the entire day.

This was a great marinade for salmon!  The oil seals in the moisture and prevents the salmon from drying out quickly.  I followed the recipe exactly, with great results.  Also, I grilled it on a piece of foil in order to prevent it from sticking to the grill (didn't want to risk it sticking or falling apart).  Thanks!

So simple and delicious!  As others suggested, I replaced the lemon pepper with fresh lemon juice/ground pepper and used olive oil instead of veg. oil. The water helps cut the soy sauce's saltiness. Also added mirin to the marinade. Baked at 425 degrees uncovered for 6 minutes, broiled 1.5 minutes. I used coho salmon - adjust bake time if using less lean cut of salmon (i.e. Alaskan).

This is a delicious dish. I wasn't a fan of salmon until now.  There's not really a fishy taste to the salmon when you use this marinade. However, I did use extra virgin olive oil instead of the vegetable oil. Only because it think it's a healthier choice. My whole family loved it, even my 2 year old. I will use this recipe many times.

This was an excellent recipe. The longer you allow the salmon to marinate, the better it will taste. I let it marinate for 2 hours the first time, and then overnight the second time. While both times the salmon was delicious, it's just better if you leave it to marinate over night. The salmon will take about 7-9 minutes on a forman grill - you will know it's down when you pick the salmon up off the grill, and the skin immediatley falls off/separates from the salmon. This is a quick and easy recipe. I highly recommend you make it with a cucumber salad on the salad or rice pilaf - a great combo.

I marinated salmon steaks for about 5 hours and did them on the B.B.Q. I did not mention to the family that they had been marinated and they could barely taste any flavour.  Not worth wasting the ingredients.

Amazing! Tastes sweet & salty! Followed the others advice on wrapping it in foil then putting it in the oven on 425 for 15 mins. Tender, and perfect! I covered the fish in the marinade before closing up the foil. Didnt even have to marinate in the fridge to get the flavor.

I really like this recipe - I already have been using it for a variety of meats on the grill. i'M giving it 5 stars even though I made quite a few changes, just because its a good starting point for your own additions. I added lemon zest and some lemon juice to the marinade, as well as one tsp of sesame oil, minced garlic and finely grated ginger. I used spring salmon fillets and marinated for 6 hours in the fridge, and then baked the fish in a hot over, in a foil wrapped dish. I also didn't drain the marinade, nothing wrong with pouring a bit in the baking dish to give it moisture. It really came out moist and flavourful.

We LOVED this recipe!  It was super easy and fast.  I did not marinade the salmon for 2 hours because I did not want the fish to get too soggy.  I only let it sit for about 30 minutes and then basted some reserve marinade 1/2 through grilling.  The fish does not need to be flipped on the grill.  Skin side down for 6-8 minutes on medium high does it! Serve this with some grilled, lemon-garlic asparagus and you have a quick, tasty healthy meal!

Fantastic. I made it with the Ginger-Scented Rice and Stir-Fried Sesame Asparagus recipes from Epicurious.com. I bought individual filets from Whole Foods, so they were very fresh. I used olive oil and I also saved the marinade and boiled it and skimmed off the oil to use as a sauce. One guest actually said "restaurant quality." Next time I'll spray the grill since some of them fell apart when I flipped them, but it's still worth flipping them for the beautiful look and texture on top. This is the first time I've reviewed a recipe - it was that good!

I thought this was great. I added finely minced garlic and onion to the marinade. The grill ran out of gas so I baked the salmon in a foil pouch and finished it under the broiler.

Very good marinade, it gave the salmon a wonderful flavor that wasn't overpowering.  I kept it in the marinade for a little over two hours, skin side down.  I used a 1.5 lb fillet and kept it whole until after it was cooked.  Also, I don't have a grill so I baked it in tinfoil on a cookie sheet for 15 minutes or so at 400 degrees.  Paired with the Baked Asparagus with Balsamic Butter sauce, it was wonderful.

We enjoyed this recipe, and will use it again.  Living in the NW, we have frequent access to fresh salmon.  Filets are thin, they really don't need to be turned, to cook completely.  We fold foil into a the shape of a jelly roll pan, put the fish on the foil, and the foil on a biscuit pan.  We use the biscuit pan as a big spatulla to slide the foil and fish on and off the grill. We usually cook fillets 6-9 min, or until the fish flakes easily.  The foil allows the fish to "cook" in the marinade.  Wouldn't change anything else...Loved it!  Thanks....

This produced the best meal I have ever tasted in my life!  My fiance couldn't stop praising my cooking all night after this meal.  I promise this recipe will not disappoint anyone.  It's one that will suit everyone's tastes.  We threw some mushrooms in the marinade and grilled those too and those tasted terrific as well!

I have tried this recipe twice because it's got such high ratings and I thought it was me or my soy sauce/salmon/something was bad but I can't stand this recipe and I've followed it to the T. My husband and I hate it. The last time I made it I couldn't even finish it I about threw up. I don't know what it is because I know I can cook and my food isn't rotten or bad. Im sure I'm the only 1 star rater but I'm not going to star something I can't stomach.

Baked at 400 for 17 minutes, covered with foil. With the remaining marinade reduced in a sauce pan and added chopped pecans at the last minute. This is a winner, in fact my 10 year old and I fought over the last piece. Yummy!

I love salmon .... wife, not so much. I have a recipe she likes so I made two versions -- her's and this one (for me). The only thing I added was a small sprinkle of cayenne just before baking. I offered her some of mine .... she tried it ..... and ... verdict was BETTER than her past "acceptable" recipe!!! So ... this recipe works for people who LIKE salmon AND those who do not!!! I followed this recipe exactly, except for the light sprinkling of cayenne and it was really good. I baked mine for 15 minutes at 400 then on broil for 5 minutes. I use a small cast iron pan for all of my baked fish ..... thank you for a new and wonderful recipe!!! CHEERS!!!

I made 1 filet on my indoor grill and it was dry.  I made the other 3 filets in the oven as another reviewer suggested and it was perfect!!  It was done at 15 mins on 425 degrees.  I cut down on the oil to 1 Tbs and used lemon juice and pepper instead of lemon pepper.  This salmon is perfect when it comes out and does not need any extra lemon juice.

Great recipe.  I used fresh garlic instead of the powder and I baked in the oven in a foil pouch. It creates its own sauce that is excellent with white rice. My 2 year old loved it.

We loved it, and reduced the extra sauce with a tish of flour or corn starch to drizzle over the top. I substituted lemon juice and fresh garlic and olive oil instead with no problems. Mmm!

I have made a version of this recipe and although not exact, same idea so I had to let you know to MAKE THIS DISH!!!  My version includes: 1/2 c chopped green onions, 1/4 c brown sugar, 1/3 c bourbon (or apple juice), 1 clove garlic, 1/3 c soy sauce, 2 T molasses, and 1/3 c Dijon mustard.  Marinate for 8 hours.  It is the best way to prepare salmon, esp for those new to eating fish.  Divine!!!!

oh my goodness!  i am not the biggest fan of salmon, but this recipe has changed that!  i used agave instead of the brown sugar.  i also seared the fish for about a minuet each side, and then baked it for 20 min in a 400 degree oven. yummy~

This marinade is so simple and tasty too.  You can add additional flavors (ginger, fresh garlic, crushed red pepper, etc.) to your taste - but its terrific AS IS, too!!  (works good on chicken as well....)

I have one thing that I do every time I cook salmon. I always make a little foil packet for each fillet and close it up, leaving a little room for air to circulate inside. If you bake the foil packets on a cookie sheet at 425 for about 15 minutes (slightly longer depending on number of fillets), the salmon cooks to perfection every time! This is a great recipe to use when preparing salmon in foil packets... it poaches gently in its on juices and always comes out so tender and delicious!

We had a terrential rain storm the night I planned on making this.  So, I followed Elizabeth's recommendation and created foil packets, baked at 425 for 15 minutes.  These were delicious, even my 19 month-old twins liked it!

BEST salmon recipe we ever ate!!  I use a whole Wild Sockeye Salmon filet (around 1 1/2 pounds) when available.  Used low sodium soy sauce and kept all other ingredients the same.  I imagine the oil could definitely be cut to 1/8 cup.  Spray grill so fish does not stick. Grilled flesh side down for 4 minutes first to get a nice glazed grill mark.  Turned skin side down for another 4 minutes.  DO NOT OVERCOOK WILD SALMON or it will be very dry.  This is the only salmon recipe my family will allow me to make!!  ENJOY!

I rarely rate recipes but this one is fantastic.  We eat salmon two or three times a week and this is the only way that I prepare it.  Makes my mouth water just to think about it.

This is a great recipe but best cooked on a grill starting with the skin side down.  I don't care too much for salmon cooked in foil.  This is a 5 star recipe.

Yum!  Olive oil instead of veg oil, marinated for about 45 min.  Grill needed no spray, salmon did not stick at all even without skin.  Sweet, savory, easy.  Great for any weeknight or for guests.  I brought remaining marinade to boil and pour spoonfuls over fillets and veggies.

Delicious!!! I used fresh salmon and gently poked some holes in them to soak up the marinade. We had a change of plans for dinner the night I wanted to serve these, so they were left marinating for about a day and a half - the longer the better!! You have got to try this recipe, the marinade is so much better than anything store bought!

SOOOOO good! I like it best cooked in the oven in the foil packets (see other review). Remember, the longer you can let it set in the sauces, the more they can soak in and the yummier it will be!

Fantastic Salmon!  I did not have time to let it sit for 2 hours but it still turned out great.  I cant wait to try it again with more prep time.  I would recommend grilling vs baking.  Those well done edges that they get from the grill are soooo good.

This recipe was super-easy and tasted really good.  I cooked the fish on a George Foreman grill, 4 minutes on one side and 2 minutes on the other side.

A Great Recipe! After reading the reviews, I decided to use lemon juice & pepper mix. I also substituted 1/8 vege oil & 1/8 olive oil instead of 1/4 cup vegetable oil, 1/6 Japanese soy sauce & 1/6 Chinese sauce (a total of 1/3 soy sauce) & a mix of 1/3 sugar - dark brown sugar & splenda. Yum & Great! :)

I cooked my salmon in the oven because we can't grill in the snow.  Even my super picky hubby loved it.  He wants me to make salmon like this again.  :)

What I did different was that I used real garlic instead of garlic powder.  Also, I reduced the leftover marinade until it's sauce-like.  Left some on each plate as for dipping.  It was sweet but not overwhelming and was very very good.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

This recipe is perfect for broiling or grilling.  The sauce is quick to put together so it makes a quick weeknight meal.  I like to serve it with couscous made with chicken broth instead of water and steamed broccoli.

My second time making this and this time I think it was even better! I baked it for 45 mins @ 400 degrees -- First line a pan with foil, then put in the pieces of salmon and all the left over marinade from the bag. Then pour two small (like the ones you can get for (.89 cents a bag) bags of veggies around the salmon and just stir them into the marinade a little. It came out PERFECT and looked so nice with all the other colors mixed in from the veggies. It was a hit at our table again, and my toddler ate two servings! I really think he thinks it's chicken :-)

When I try a new recipe, I usually have to tweek at least one thing with it to make it work right.  I am happy to say that I didn't have to change a single thing with this recipe and everything is delicious!  I'm going to try this marinade with chicken next...

Another success story. This marinade made my salmon fillets perfect!  It really toned down the "fishy" taste that can be so common with salmon.  I marinated 2 fillets for about 5 hours and broiled them in my oven.  I served them over rice cooked in chicken broth and ghee and stir-fried cabbage and cauliflower.  My 19 month old even enjoyed this.  Thanks Tina.

I thought this recipe was GREAT!  This is by far the best salmon recipe I have ever tried.  I really like how the combination of brown sugar & soy tastes on the fish.  I usually cook this in a foil bag on the grill to prevent the fish from flaking off and falling into the grill.  This also steams in the marinade and gives the fish great flavor.

This is a wonderful recipe! We love garlic, so I add 1-2 cloves chopped garlic, as well as some fish/poultry seasoning, to the marinade. The longer you marinate, the better!

Excellent recipe.  Like one of the other reviewers I cook this once a week. My children, ages 5 and 3 love it!  As noted, donot marinate too long, and a bit of extra brown sugar does wonders.

We eat a ton of Salmon throughout the winter season and I always use this marinade.  I do substitute a few of the spices and omit the salt based on personal preference but I must also say the original spices are yummy as is.  If interested, my alterations are as follows: 1-1/2 lb. of salmon skin removed, Old Bay Seasoning to taste, dash or two of Cumin, Garlic Powder to taste, 1/3 cup Soy Sauce, 1/3 cup Brown Sugar, 1/3 cup Water, 1/4 cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  I make two separate batches of the marinade; one for marinating the fish and the other for basting the fish as I cook it on the grill.  Fish Tip:  If you have picky eaters who don’t care for strong flavored fish I suggest the following:  Soak the fish in Milk for one hour in a zip-lock bag, drain off milk, rinse and marinate as specified.  Thank you for this scrumptious marinade!!

This is the best brown sugar marinade for salmon ever. Instead of pouring off the marinade, I poured it into a nonstick fry pan, added 1 huge tbsp of brown sugar, and reduced it to a glaze consistency to serve with the salmon.  My dinner guests nearly licked their plates!  Great served with jasmine rice prepared with garlic, ginger & cilantro.

I modified the recipe a bit for speed, but the flavor should be roughly the same, so my rating is based on that.  It's delicious!  I skipped the marinating step since I knew I'd have plenty of sauce for soaking and this was ready in half an hour.  I used 1.5 lbs salmon (2 fillets) with half of the other ingredients as follows:

1. In a small bowl, mix 1.5 tbsp lemon juice, 1/8 tsp pepper, a pinch of garlic powder, 8 tsp low sodium soy sauce, 8 tsp brown sugar, 2 tbsp water, and 2 tbsp olive oil.

2. Rip a piece of aluminum foil large enough to wrap around a fillet roughly 1.5 to 2 times.  Place the fillet on one half facedown, pour half the sauce over it, and then fold the foil over it.  Pinch the very edges together, folding them over twice to make a well-sealed packet with some extra space inside (the packet will puff up a little in the oven).  

3. Place salmon packets in the oven, preheated to 440 degrees.  Bake for 10 minutes, then flip and bake for another 10.  Serve alone or with a side - YUM!

This recipe was delicious. One small thing I added was a little dollop of honey and since I don't have a grill, I seared the salmon first then baked it at 325 for approx 20 min (I only had a 1lb serving). The subtle sweetness of the sugar and honey and mild tang of the soy and garlic was a perfect combo. I served it over brown rice and stir fried veggies. Thanks for the great dinner! My boyfriend appreciates it too :)

Delicate flavor that gets rid of the fishy taste/smell. Following tips in other reviews, we wrapped them in foil packets and baked it in the oven at at 425 for about 15 minutes. Coming from someone who doesn't really like salmon, this was the best salmon dish we've ever made!

This was outstanding!  In have one of those seal a meal vaccume marinators and marinated this overnight.  Mostly because my wife fell asleep just prior to dinner prep.  We served it with grilled Asperagas and a Greek salad.  No restraunt could have done better.  It was so good that my wife insisted that I review it here.

I am trying to get myself to like salmon, so I tried this recipe. It's very teriyaki like. I had a tiny 4 oz piece of salmon so I lightly seasoned it with the lemon pepper and salt, I used fresh garlic and cut the recipe to 2 TBL each of the soy, brown sugar, water and oil then marinaded it overnight in a baggie. I baked it in a foil packet in a 375' convection oven for 20 mins. and served over rice. The marinade was good, couldn't take the lemon pepper and it hid the taste of the salmon (which for me could be a good thing). From everyone else's review this sounds like it's a fave and a big star rating for them. I'm still trying to like salmon though...

very good but use 100% maple syrup instead of brown sugar and this becomes a 5 star recipe.The maple syrup is thicker and the marinade is thicker and this make the taste more intense.

I usually don't bother with reviews, but this was so good, I had to! I didn't have lemon pepper or garlic powder, so I did what another reviewer said and added 1/3 c lemon juice and 1/4 tsp black pepper in place of the lemon pepper and some minced garlic instead of the powder. I also only added 2 Tbs of the oil. But otherwise I did what the recipe said and it was so yummy, even my 1 1/2 year old loved it, and my 4 1/2 year old kept asking if there was more! Thanks!

Made this tonight exactly as the recipe was written and my husband and I both loved it.  We love seafood and love to try different marinades on it.  My husband said "Yumm" several times during dinner, and he said that this was the best salmon recipe he's ever had.  It was a winner here!  We grilled it out on the grill.  I marinaded it for about 2 1/2 hours and then we got some tin foil and put the salmon in there making a pocket and then I poured extra marinade on the salmon and let it grill slowly.  When I was finished, I opened the packet and all of the extra cooked marinade went on my rice.

This is so good and easy to make! I have made it several times and it has come out great each time.  I prefer grilling, but it also cooks great in foil pakets in the oven. Great dish for entertaining.

Awesome recipe!  I didn't have time to marinate so I just mixed the sauce up and poured it over the seasoned salmon.  I also broiled it for about 6 minutes per side rather than making a foil packet (I was out of foil).  It turned out wonderfully!

Used 1 pound salmon steaks, 1 inch thick. Marinated for 3 hours in mixture, baked in oven at 400 for 15 minutes, then broil for 5. Turned out excellent. Next time I will set aside some marinade and glaze half way through baking.

I'm sure this recipe is worthy of 5 stars and that this poor rating is due to errors on my part.  But maybe someone can learn from my mistakes or help a poor soul who has very little experience cooking salmon (first time!).  Anyway, started with frozen salmon (my first error?) and since I don't have a grill I tried the whole bake it then broil it method.  It was dry and the marinade didn't really glaze over like I would have liked it to (should I have expected it to?).  Also the salmon had weird grey gobs on it when it cooked.  Next time I think I'll try rinsing the filets first and then putting it in those foil packets before sticking under the broiler (closer this time).

Fixed this for 91-year-old mother-in-law.  She thought it was wonderful.  I have to confess, I didn't even get to taste it, but it surely smelled and looked wonderful!  I'm sure I'll make it again and get a taste then.  Will update my review.

I absolutely agree with the other reviewers out there. This is one of the best marinades for salmon that I have personally tried. I too used the foil packet method (about 20 minutes at 425) and then opened them up and broiled for another 5 minutes to get the marinade to caramelize up a bit and brown the top of the fish. It turned out tender and delicious. Thank you very much for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Tasty.  Save the marinade, grill skin side up first, then baste the flesh after turning.

You know its a good recipe when I review it twice since I accidentally clicked cancel! This pleased me, who HATES salmon, my 1 year old, my 9 year old....AND THE HUBBY. They all went back for more. The baby kept saying "Fish fish MORE good!" I baked it at 450 for 13 minutes. I forgot to marinate so just poured the sauce over the seasoned fillets. I however did NOT add salt to taste as the soy sauce already offers more than enough. This is not a FISHY tasting recipe. It is AMAZING!

Best marinade for salmon I've ever tried. I did use fresh garlic, juice from one lemon and ground pepper instead of the garlic powder  and lemon pepper. Grilled on med/high skin side down and it came out perfect.

First taste and I said: "Oh yeah momma!" It was so good. I didn't even have all the time to marinate it, and I did it in the oven for 20 minutes, rice on the side. Also, I took the extra marinade, added some flour (pre-whisked into water) and heated it for a sauce. Yum!

Delicious and a big hit with my family.  Baked instead of grilled.  Put it in a foil packet WITH the marinade and sealed and cooked for about 20 min or so.  So moist and tasted sooo good!

This recipe is fantastic!  I usually do not like salmon but I loved it made this way!  I actually don't have a grill so I made it in a pan on the stove top and it still turned out great.  I also poured a little of the marinade in the pan to caramelize on the fish as it cooked and that added a really nice taste!

This is the first Salmon I've ever cooked and is also the first Salmon I've ever eaten and liked! I did not use any lemon pepper since I did not have any. Also, instead of throwing out the marinade, I added just a bit of water and I boiled it for about 7-8 min. and then it made a great syrupy sauce to pour over the fish after it was cooked.

OMG!!! SO GOOOOOODDDD!!! Didn't have lemon pepper so I used ***I love lemon so this may not work for others*** 2/3 cup lemon juice --- pepper, garlic powder, salt, and onion powder to taste --- 1/3 cup soy sauce --- 2/3 cup brown sugar ***to offset the double lemon juice*** --- 1/3 cup water --- 1/4 cup oil. I marinated for 24 hours in fridge because salmon was in deep freezer. Baked in oven 450 degrees for 12 minutes. Then I broiled for 5 minutes, checked fish, and broiled for another 5 minutes (because I was cooking 7 fillets) in little aluminum foil pouches.

I have to agree with another reviewer who said "the longer you marinate, the better it is!" I used alot of garlic, and added some dry mustard to the mix. Quite possibly the BEST salmon recipe I've found to date. Thanks, Tina!

I've used this marinade around 5 times now...it's really the easiest and tastiest marinade for salmon.  I just throw the fillets on our Foreman grill and the taste has always been just right.  Great...

Fantastic!!! Never been a fan of marinating salmon because it is so flavorful. I reluctantly tried this to see if the rest of the famiy would like it. Wife loved it and salmon is one of her least favorite fish. Even the kids (4 & 6) enjoyed it. It has a sweet flavor at first taste, but the marinade does not overpower the fish, and the natural flavor still comes through. An instant family pleaser and keeper.

I marinated the salmon for 1 1/2 hours.  Sprinkled it with lemon pepper and garlic salt just before putting it into the oven.  Baked it for 40 minutes at 400...wonderful!  Will definitely make again.

My husband doesn't like plain salmon very much, but loved it prepared with this recipe. I also enjoyed this recipe as it didn't detract from the taste of the salmon at all. I cooked it using our George Foreman grill and everyone thought it smelled wonderful in the kitchen.

A really great recipe!!  I prepared this for dinner last evening and we enjoyed it so much. Before reading the reviews of many others, I thought my husband and I were the only 2 people who didn't like salmon.  However this method of preparation has certainly converted us!  I baked the fish at 450 degrees for 15 minutes then broiled it for another 5.   I also thickened the marinade (but with a little corn starch) and added that to the serving plate.  Thank you so much for this recipe...we will be enjoying a lot more salmon and using the same marinade for other seafood.

Loved this. It was too cold the other night to fire up the grill so I cooked it for 12-15 minutes at 450. It was terrific.

Really tasty!  A nice change from the ususal lemon/dill salmon.  I have to admit though, that I tweaked the recipe a bit.  I used the lemon pepper, garlic, and salt, cut the soy sauce and brown sugar to 3 tablespoons each, omitted the water and oil, and used 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice instead.  I marinated the fillets in this for four hours then baked it in the oven.  (I didn't drain the marinade.)  Came out wonderful!  A definite keeper!

Another fabulous salmon recipe!! This (along w/ 2 others I've found on this site) have turned me AND my hubby into salmon lovers!  (My 12-year-old son already was...)  It is superb!  I started marinating my salmon for dinner last night and ended up going out on the spur of the moment, so didn't make the salmon until night.  I was concerned about marinating it for so long but it was wonderful!  This one definitely goes into my permanent file of recipes.

One of our favorite ways to grill salmon. The only thing I do differently is to boil down the marinade after putting the fish on the grill and use it to baste the fish while grilling. It's safe to use after boiling down and creates the most wonderful mahogany glaze on the fish. Try it, you'll love it. Also, I always use a fish basket for grilling to keep the fish from sticking to the grill - so much easier!

OH MY GOSH! Made it exactly, cooked it in a bit of olive oil in my electric skillet. Started with the skin side up, when the bottom carmalized, I turned it over. The skin came right off (yay!) We TORE THIS UP!!! Thank you ~ never knew salmon could be this good :-)

Added 1 squeezed lemon, omitted water, used a dash of olive oil (substitution for other oil), omitted salt, doubled marinade, and added fresh ginger. Only marinated long enough to get the oven warmed up and the rice and green beans going. Cooked at 350 until everything else was done (about 20-30 min?), basting a couple times, then broiled for a few minutes while I seasoned the green beans. Really, it didn't take long at all and is superb! No leftovers on the fish. I will be saving the leftover marinade/sauce from the pan to use with the leftover rice when I make fried rice. Will DEFINITELY make again!

SUPER TASTE and SUPER EASY!  Made it last night for wife and 2 kids who really liked it-and they are some picky suckers!  It is a moderately sweet dish, which we like.  I followed the recipe exactly, but boiled the drained marinade so we could add to fish after grilling, if desired.  It was better tasting and much cheaper than the same at a restaurant.  I had as the side/vegetable another Allrecipes item--Green Beans with Smokey Bacon Vinaigrette. It was a good complement to the fish.

Not that another review is needed, but here's my two cents (and if I don't write down what I did, my family will be mad!)  I used all the specified ingredients, sans lemon pepper (sorry, not a fan). I whisked in the juice of half a lemon, a good dose of Penzey's minced garlic and freeze dried shallots, garlic/onion powders, jarred minced garlic (yes, I'm a garlic fanatic!) a couple tablespoons of Thai sweet red chili sauce, a sprinkling a red pepper flakes, a spritz of ground ginger and some freeze-dried chives. Yes, this is more ingredients than the original recipe....who cares, it was perfect for our family and I see this marinade as a regular Friday night rotation this summer. Pierced the salmon fillets using a fork and then seasoned them using fresh lemon juice, sea salt, pepper, and garlic/onion powders. Marinated for about 4 1/2 hours.  Grilled using a foil-lined grill basket for easy cleanup for 7 minutes skin-side down first, then 7 minutes flesh-side up. Perfection!!!! My 5 year-old DD wanted more salmon rather than a chocolate gelato for dessert! Served with a grilled veggie medley (zucchini/squash/Vidalia onions and yellow & red cherry tomatoes) and steamed jasmine rice. Not many dinners get a "5 stars across the board" rating, but this one.....oh yeah, baby.

This is my family’s favorite salmon recipe period. I rub the filets with lemon pepper prior to bagging them with the other ingredients. I always let the fish marinade 2-3 hours before barbecuing them on my charcoal Weber. They come out perfect every time. Thanks for sharing.

We had this tonight and made for 3 servings (with two larger pieces of salmon).  Like a reviewer suggested, cut the oil to 1 tablespoon and used EVOO.  Marinated for 5 hours and wished I had gone longer.  The flavor was great in the thinner portion of the fillets but missing in the thicker pieces. This has potential - we missed ginger and a bit of heat.  Will try again with a few modifications.

This is absolute salmon perfection! I sometimes bake this in the oven at 425 degrees for 12 to 18 minutes depending on the thickness of my salmon. It is so moist and delicious. The other day I had some of this marinating (a beautiful, expensive fillet) and got into a car accident. I couldn't get to the salmon for a few days and thought it would be ruined, but it was fabulous. One of the best pieces of fish I've ever had. I love to add quite a bit of lemon pepper and garlic powder, the combination of the spiceness and the sweetness is tantalizing. YUM!

I used wild sockeye salmon.  I only marinaded for about 30 minutes and it was still tasty.  I also tossed baby bok choy into the marinade and grilled those as well.  I served the salmon with mango salsa, but it was flavorful enough on it's own.

The only thing that I would add to this delicious recipe is a tip from the woman who sold me my salmon. I grilled it skin side down first and then slid the fillet off of the skin and flipped the other side back onto the skin that was still on the grill.  I didn't lose any salmon and I was glad I didn't when I tasted it!

Made tonight and it was good.  I made the Yummy Honey Mustard Dipping Sauce from this site to go with sweet potato fries I was serving with the salmon.  The sauce was excellent with the salmon and took it up a notch so you have something to dip the salmon in.  Five of us loved it, and we all used the sauce with the salmon.

Really good and makes a lovely glaze cover on the salmon at cooking. I did sub. lime juice and fresh cracked pepper because I don't keep lemon pepper at home. Otherwise, followed as written. Excellent way to grill salmon.

Excellent recipe!  I used a splash of lemon juice and lemon peel & black pepper since I didn't have lemon pepper on hand.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil & I skipped the salt and used garlic salt instead.  I wrapped the salmon in foil packets and hubby cooked it on the grill as directed.  He is NOT a fan of fish, but he loved it & said to make it again anytime!!

Wow, we loved this one! We were looking for something fairly healthy to grill for Labor Day and came across this recipe. I'm so glad we tried it! Very easy to make, and we had all of the marinade ingredients on hand. I'd recommend leaving the skin on one side of the salmon to keep it moist. Ours came out with the perfect texture, and the flavor was great. Thank you for a great recipe that I'm sure we will make again!

Scrumptious! Followed recipe other than using olive oil, and regular pepper because I didn't have lemon pepper. Everyone gobbled it up! Definitely added to the rotation :)

Awesome simple/basic recipe for grilled salmon! Very flavorfull but not overpowering. The glaze made the salmon a little crispy on the outside and perfect on the inside. I don't think this would turn out as good if it was baked/broiled. I also don't think this would be as good with frozen salmon.  Get fresh and grill it and you won't be disappointed!

I've been using this for years and our family loves it!  I reduce the remaining marinade for a topping, but I'm the only one who uses it.  You don't have to grill it.  You can finish it off in the broiler to brown it, but watch it closely.  Some reviewers said it was too sweet, but that's probably because they didn't add enough salt before marinating.  The only way you won't like this is if you don't like salmon or soy sauce.  Thanks for this recipe!

Flavor was pretty good!  I marinated for about 4 hours and baked in foil packets.  I may have slightly over cooked it because they were a bit dry for me - next time 10 minutes instead of 15.  Will definitely make again.

Great recipe, didn't change a thing and my wife (who is not a seafood fan) loved this.  I have a small 45 degree needle nose plier that I keep in the kitchen utensil drawer that I use to remove the pin bones.  I use a paring knive to depress the flesh and then the needle nose plier to pull out the pin bones.  The combination of no fish bones and great taste did it for the wife.

It was very good - although i baked it in the oven at 425 for 12 minutes and then broiled for 5 - would like to try it on the bbq next time. i also boiled the sauce to put over the salmon once done. very yummy

I haven't tried this recipe but but I have a very simple way to make salmon.  Brush with Mikee brand Sesame Teriyaki Sauce.  Marinate the salmon then put it in a pan and cover the pan with aluminum foil and bake @ 350 for about 20 - 25 minutes or until it's done.  I had it with dried cranberry/pecan cous cous.  I prefer salmon steaks to salmon filets, but it is good with both!  Mikee Sesame Teriyaki Sauce is probably comprised of the same ingredients made in this recipe and it has sesame seeds!  Very easy!

I have been making this recipe for years, with a few variations depending on our mood. I use 1 tablespoon melted butter instead of oil. I also add fresh chopped rosemary, or fresh grated ginger for that extra freshness. Sometimes we add Sambal to kick up the heat. This is also wonderful on fresh tuna steaks

I become a member of allrecipes.com just so I could rate this recipe!  DELICIOUS!  Marinated for about 5 hours, used fresh lemon juice and garlic powder instead of the mix, and olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Wrapped/tented with aluminum foil, baked at 425 for about 25 minutes.  PERFECT!  My fiance who DOES NOT like fish gave it rave reviews!  Back to the store tomorrow for more Salmon while it's on sale!  This will be a regular in our home!

Very good. I looked on You Tube for how to grill salmon...and used a method found on there. The marinade was good with a slightly sweet flavor.

A very good recipe with a great sauce. Caution though, don't let it marinate too long or else the outside of the fish will absorb too much of the soy flavor and makes it too strong and you can't taste anything else.

This is one of my new favorite salmon recipes. I didn't have lemon pepper, so I added some lemon juice and used fresh garlic. I also added a Jalepano pepper to the marinade to compliment the brown sugar. It gave it a great sweet and then spicy flavor. I'm sure you can take this recipe in a variety of ways and have great success.

I just got married and this was my first meal that I've ever made that wasn't out of a box..lol...not only was it idiot proof, but it was AMAZING!!!  I LOVE this marinade!  Just the way it is!  I actually kept the marinade and drizzled some on the salmon after cooking it.  Thanks so much for such a wonderful recipe!  My husband has been raving about it for 2 days!

Tasted good. I'm not a fan of salmon but if I make again I would likely use this recipe again. I wound up baking mine for 20 minutes at 425 degrees. The salmon turned out very moist, tender and flavorful. 3/13/12 I made this again but grilled it this time. I wound up marinating it for 24 hours, which wasn't intentional, just decided to grill it the next day instead. Turned out very good and served it with fresh spinach and mashed potatoes. I turned the leftover marinade into a gravy. It bit too strong so a little went a long way.

Wow!! That's all my brain to process after tasting this the first time. It was the best salmon I ever had!! I used olive oil instead and fresh garlic. Even my husband who doesn't care for fish kept raving! This is one to print off and use weekly! Enjoy!!!

This sauce was delicious. I thickened the leftover sauce on the stove by cooking over medium heat for a few minutes and then served it on the side with the salmon. Everyone wanted more of the sauce!

I'll add my 5 stars to this already highly rated recipe.  Absolutely perfect combination of flavors with the salmon.  I did like another reviewer's statement that she took the left over marinade and boiled it until it turned thick and gooey.  Oh my, what an instense flavor over the salmon.  A special treat for me since my hubby doesn't eat baked or grilled fish of any kind.  I made 4 4oz pieces, grilled them on the charcoal grill and then wrapped them in some saran wrap and put away for some lunches this week.  Will eat it with some of the Sesame Noodles from this site.  YUMMM!  Makes me want to go to work!

I marinated my salmon for over 7 hours, which still didn't impart as much flavor as I'd hoped! (I did skip the salt though.)  I added dill and more lemon pepper, as well as a topping of a little more brown sugar, and then baked mine in the oven still in the marinade. It was so saturated in juices that it was a little hard to tell when it was done, but it turned out delicious, with a moist texture and sweet top layer from the extra brown sugar.  My hubby still prefers my extra lemony version of salmon, but I loved it!

Wonderful recipe.  I eat salmon all the time and this was a nice twist.  I marinated it in a 13x9 pan with the skin side up for about 3 hours.  Then baked it on a foil-lined cookie sheet, skin side down, at 400 for 20 minutes.  I let it rest for about 5 minutes before serving.  The marinade left a nice carmelized glaze on the top. Excellent!

I've been making this recipe for years, and realized I've never reviewed it.  I almost always make it for company, and am always asked for the recipe or to make it when they come for dinner again!  I have made it both on the grill and in the oven.   When I grill I often use the Reynolds Release foil under the salmon -- it never sticks or chars, but still gets a nice finish.  (It does slide a little when you want to flip it, but it really takes the stress out of grilling fish if you are at all concerned.) Excellent -- I have no need for any other salmon recipe!

This recipie was great! Instead of a grill, I cooked it in the oven in foil packets at 450 for about 15 minutes. Easy and delicious.

so simple, so great...add a pre-soaked alder or cedar plank over a charcoal grill. this is excellent as is. can be enhanced easily with best toppings or butter-rubs. but this stands alone as a great way to prepare salmon.

This salmon is fabulous!  My only warning is to not over marinate... most seafood marinations should not be any longer than 30 minutes, so be careful not to marinate too long as you will get an acidic rotten flavor from the fish.  I marinated the salmon for 30 mins for this recipe as I do all fish and it was perfect!

I used the oven method, since its too hot to even grill right now. 425 degrees for 15 minutes inside a foil packet--delish! Squeeze a little lemon juice to brighten the flavor.

My husband and I cook this often for family and friends.  Our 4 year old out eats the adults on this one.  I do leave out the salt due to the soy sauce being somewhat salty and substitute olive oil.  It turns out great.

I always feel like it's a good sign with a recipe when you can modify it to what you have and it still tastes great.  I didn't have lemon pepper so I used lemon juice.  We also don't have a grill, so I used the broiler.  I only had frozen salmon, which I thawed them marinated for about an hour (I also didn't have much time).  And what do you know?  It was absolutely delicious.

Very good.  I didn't use the lemon pepper or additional salt but didn't feel it was missing anything.  I didn't have time to marinate it as long as the recipe stated, and I think it would have been even better if I had.  It creates a beautifully caramelized crust on the fish, which stays moist.  This one's a keeper for us.

All I can say is "WOW". You MUST make this! I don't think I can eat salmon any other way again. It was so simple to prepare too. I added slices of lemons and a little sweet chilli sauce and marinated for about 8 hours. I also added about a tablespoon of vietnamese fish sauce. I cooked it for 5 minutes each side and it was just perfect. The leftovers were wonderful cold in a sandwich with some mayo. Thank you for a superb recipe that I will be using time and time again. Salmon has never tasted so good.
This is also just as awsome if you use chicken. Delish!

I didn't think this sounded that great, (soy sauce and sugar?) but because it was on the top 20 recipes I tried it anyway. My boyfriend and I are both very picky about salmon. I will only eat it at one restaurant in our tri-country area. We both just about died when we tasted this. I kept repeating "OH MY GOD" every time I took a bite. One tip - get Alaskan Red King salmon, its very moist. Also, don't get too thick a filet of salmon, it makes it tough to grill it all the way through. You end up leaving it on too long and then it's dry.

FIVE STARS I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Great marinade. I've made it twice. The first time I used the recipe as shown. Second time I added some Wasabi powder and crushed red pepper to add a little punch. 

Used the leftover sauce as a dipping sauce. It is a little sweet, but a very tasty sauce. I cook salmon on the George grill which is excellent, and serve with zuchini and squash that I also have cooked on the George. It is easy and delicious!

The marinade was very tasty!  I did make a few changes after reading other reviews.  I only used 1/4 cup of soy sauce (the low sodium kind).  I mixed brown sugar and Splenda to make it a little healthier, and I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I marinated the salmon in a baking dish, skin up, for 8 hours and was disappointed that the salmon did not absorb enough of the flavor of the marinade.  I ended up making another batch of marinade to pour over the cooked salmon, and then it tasted amazing.  I would definitely recommend making some extra marinade or reserving some to pour over the cooked salmon.  Very delicious flavor!

Hello. I am only 14 years old and I decided to cook salmon for the first time, and came across this recipe. I was amazed and very very proud. I dazzled my landlord and family. I made a few changes to the marinade, but basically it was the best marinade ever, very clever and delicious. I added a touch of honey to it and dry red wine. Also, I baked the salmon instead of grilling it, for ten minutes. Halfway through the baking, I took the salmon out and marinated it with new marinade. It turned out juicy and amazing. Thank you so much!

Wife liked it. Kids raved. It was simple. As with the review currently listed as 'most helpful', I did not grill but instead followed those directions-- bake at 450 for 12 minutes and then broil. However, where that review said to broil for 5 minutes, at 2 minutes it was looking quite done to me, and I took them out. Done perfectly! Yum.

I don't use oil in the marinade and I use 2 Sweet & Low packets instead of brown sugar.  It's the best salmon recipe out there

I just realized I forgot to put the garlic powder and lemon pepper on the salmon.  Did everything else right and it turned out well.  I think I prefer my salmon more simple & "natural" with just some lemon & onion flavors, on the grill.

We had this tonight for supper and it was sooooooo good.  Because it's very hot inside, we cooked it outside on a Coleman stove using a Martha Stewart cast iron grill pan.  Served it with brown rice and fresh veggies.  Will have it again, for sure.  Great Recipe!

I was pretty excited about making this after reading the reviews.  I am a fish lover already, and salmon is an excellent, versatile fish to work with.  My husband is not crazy about fish, but he is getting there, and salmon is one fish he does like.  I thought this recipe was a nice change from my traditional way of preparing salmon. I made it 3 nights ago and my husband still talks about it "Remember that great dinner we had the other night?"  ;)  The things we did differently:  I added 1 tsp. minced garlic to the marinade, and subbed orange juice instead of water, like some other reviewers suggested. I marinated the salmon all day, for about 9 hours, and I think that was fine.  We did grill it, but wrapped in aluminum foil to seal in the flavors instead of laying the fish right on the grill.  I also took the leftover marinade, boiled it to reduce, and added some cornstarch to thicken it, which made an excellent dipping sauce.  We would term this recipe "Teriyaki Salmon" because of the soy sauce flavor...very good.  I will probably use this recipe throughout the summer because of the grill!

Sorry to disaggree with so many 5 star reviews but hubby and I both agreed the sugar and soy sauce couldn't cover the fishiness of the salmon and barbequeing seemed to make it worse.  So far the only way we are able to eat this so called "healthy for you fish" is to poach it and then drown it in cucumber dill sauce.

Excellent!  I just mixed all the marinade ingredients in the bag, put in the salmon and turned several times.  I also added about 1/4 cup of brandy to the marinade and a little cayenne.  Thank you for this recipe!

This was amazing.  I now have another salmon recipe that is so good...I will probably make it too often.  I did things a little differently.  I mixed all the ingredients together and made a marinade.  I left it in the fridge for a little over 2 hours.  I also substituted the garlic powder for about 3 cloves of minced garlic.  My husband thought it was great.  I'm sure this one will stay in the recipe books for quite some time.  Thanks for posting.

A winner of a recipe! I didn't have any lemon-pepper, so I added a bit of lemon juice and about 1/4 tsp fresh ground pepper. Everyone enjoyed it and asked for more. I think this will be our preferred recipe for grilled salmon this summer.

This salmon is very impressive!  I didn't add the full 1/4 cup of oil because I didn't it want it to be so oily, and it still turned out awesome!  This is a wonderuful salmon recipe and I'd recommend it to anyone.

This recipe is sooo good!! If your like me, I love quick and easy meals during the week. You'll need to fix the marinate the night before and when you get home from work it's ready to go! It tastes fabulous!! I wasn't a fish eater until I tasted this recipe!!

"EXCELLENT"  Everyone loves this! My husband likes it so much it asks for it almost weekly.  One of the best salmon marinades I have tried.  We keep a little of the marinade on the side to drizzle over the salmon after it is grilled.  I also cut back a little on the soy to help reduce the sodium. THANK YOU TINA - Great recipe!!

This recipe was wonderful.The only thing I added was appox 1/2 tsp minced garlic. I also sprayed my grill grate with nonstick cooking spay before I put the fish on.  Put the fish skin side down first.  This tastes just like Longhorn Steakhouse's salmon.  I worked there for nine years and then moved across the country and there are no Longhorns.  With this recipe, I get a little taste of home.  Thanks!

This recipe is wonderful! I use it almost once a week. I did find the key is not to marinate for too long. If you do the brown sugar dissolves too much. Also, by adding more brown sugar the fish really is great!

7.6.17  I made this exactly as written and was happy with the way it turned out.  The only thing you’ll have to stay on top of is the cooking time, and that’s dependent upon the thickness of the filets.  We overcooked ours just a little, but it still flaked nicely, and unlike some reviewers, we had no issue with the salmon being bland, being too sweet, being too salty, etc.  Actually, we found the flavor pretty mild and fresh, and when removing the filets from the grill, they just slipped right off of the skin.  I bought fresh wild Alaskan sockeye salmon and cooked it the same day.   We enjoyed this recipe and plan to buy more while the fresh salmon is available (and on sale, too!).

Loved this!  Very easy.. followed the recipe given.
I baked in the oven and broiled the skin side up first, to give a little crisp and gently turn on the other side to bake, but put just a little bit of oil in your pan so you Salmon want stick if you bake it...-Charlotta,  AR

Absolutely brilliant....... The second time I tried this I added lemon juice, chopped garlic, minced ginger and 1 tbsp Chili sauce to the marinade.. The chili added a surprisingly mild heat to it. I enjoyed both recipes.

I baked our Salmon in parchment with 2 cloves of garlic...20 min @ 425.  it was moist and lovely without broiling.  Reduced the sauce and added corn starch with chicken broth and served the Salmon on Brown Rice with that perfect sauce.  Just the best Salmon I have ever prepared.  And, I have cooked for 70 years !

This marinade is SO GOOD! I don't grill my salmon, I bake it. I found a video on this site on how to perfectly bake salmon. You heat your oven to 450. Once preheated you heat a glass or ceramic baking dish with a couple tbls of butter for 5 minutes. Then bake your salmon for 10 minutes per inch of thickness. I always buy the center cut fillets and bake for 10 minutes. I've made this recipe countless times and they always come out perfectly cooked, not over done. What a great recipe for the marinade!!!

LOVED this recipe.  I have tried so many different salmon recipes and this one is by far the best. I used wild caught sockeye salmon and put in in the oven rather than on the grill. I can't wait to try it on the grill!  It was so delicious baked, I can't imagine how tasty it will be grilled.

This has to be one of my favorite ways to marinate salmon! The pairing of soy sauce with brown sugar gives the fish an added sweet and savory flavor. Salmon comes out so tender and flaky.  I average marinating time for at least 2 hours, but have had it sit for up to 4 before grilling. I have done grilling directly on grate, but I prefer to use a large sheet of foil, sprayed with Pam, and place the foil directly on the grill, less chance of losing any delicious meat to the coals.

My 5 year old loves salmon (it's her favorite meal). She ate 2 full servings, and said she liked it better than my usual baked recipe. I didn't marinate as long as the recipe said (only about 20 minutes), but it was still very good. I think the Lemon Pepper is the secret ingredient. The first time I made it, I didn't have it on hand, and it wasn't as good.

I followed this recipe exactly with the exception that I cooked it under the broiler for 5 minutes on each side and I used the marinade to make a sauce to dip the fish in by boiling it with some cornstarch.  I also didn't season the fish with salt since the Lemon Pepper and soy sauce are both very salty.  I only used the lemon pepper, garlic powder and a little onion powder to season the fish and since I only had 3 salmon steaks I decreased my soy sauce and water to 1/4 of a cup each, kept the oil the same and added a little extra brown sugar on top of the 1/4 cup.  This so far has been my favorite salmon recipe that I have found.

I loved this recipe! I'm so glad that I picked this one. I did a few things differently. 
First, I didn't grill it, I baked it. I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. I also didn't marinate it because I just found the recipe tonight and I really wanted to make it. For baking, I preheated the oven to 375, I then put a little of the oil and the dry seasonings on the bottom of the pan. Then I placed the fish in the pan, and sprinkled some more of the dry seasonings on top. Then I made the sauce and poured it on top of the fish.

I also made rice as a side to this. The rice and the fish with the sauce was perfect. I will be making this again.

I made this last night and it was superb! My entire family loved it!  The changes I made: Added juice of one lime and I omitted the garlic as it takes away too much of the Salmon flavour.  While I grilled the Salmon, I boiled the marinade/reduced it by half, which made an awesome sauce over the mashed potatoes served with the Salmon.

I  broil this...4-6 inches away from heating element...more like 4 minutes per side until it flakes.  Absolutely one of our all-time favorite recipes!  I was really disappointed the last time I ordered salmon at a restaurant.  It wasn't nearly as good as "mine".  :-)

Perfect salmon recipe.  I have been using this recipe at least 2-3 times a month for about a year because my family and I LOVE it.  I bake it in the oven because I am not so grill savvy and it comes out perfect every time.  I use juice from half a small lemon and ground black pepper instead of lemon pepper.  I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil to make it a little more healthy and I bake it at 350 for 25ish minutes in a small pyrex dish covered with foil (so yummy and moist if you add half the marinade in the dish.)

Amazing!  I only had 2 filets, so I did 2 T each of soy sauce, brown sugar, and water, and 1 T each of olive oil and lemon juice.  I sprinkled the filets with garlic powder and pepper.  It was awesome.  It took 4 minutes for it to cook on the george foreman grill.  I may add some ginger next time.

We don't have a grill, so instead we put the salmon in a foil "tent", placed it in a glass dish, and put it in the oven at 400 degrees. It worked great; you'll just need to check it once in a while to see if it's done. We also substituted Bragg Liquid Aminos (160mg sodium) for the soy sauce. I'm a picky eater and I thought it was delicious.

Made exactly as written (refrigerated for just 2 hrs) and it was wonderful! I did use wild salmon so the marinade tasted subtle on the bold flavorful filet. I imagine on farm raised salmon the marinade flavor may be a bit stronger. It was perfect for us though.

SUPER simple and REALLY great flavor! I let it hang in the marinade for about an hour then grilled it. Of course, watch the grilling time because each piece of fish will be a different thickness, so it will take more/less time (mine took less). Perfect main dish for our dinner! The flavors were all great together--I wouldn't change a thing! This is a keeper!

Loved the flavor of this!  Instead of sprinkling the fish with lemon pepper and garlic powder before marinating, I added lemon zest and 1 clove of minced garlic to the marinade.  The fish marinated for about 4 hours but it could have definitely gone longer.  YUM!

next time use regular soy sauce instead of low sodium, and also cut sugar down slightly.

I did make a few changes but this is definitely one for the recipe box.  I used half vegetable oil, half sesame oil and I added minced garlic instead of garlic powder and a little lime juice.  I also have some maple pepper that I used in place of the lemon pepper.  I marinated for about 6 hours.  Served with mashed potatoes, mashed squash, steamed carrots and asparagus.

Followed recipe 100% & although fork tender & cooked to perfection, the flavor was not complimentary. Very strong soy sauce flavor. Didn't like the dark color of the marinated fish either.

This was GREAT! I hate salmon, I never buy it, however, I'm trying to eat better and this was one of the fish I read that was great in omegas and stuff. So I brought it, followed the receipe and it turns out that salmon is now my favorite fish, hands down.

I'm not a fan of salmon(or any fish really) because it always leaves that fishy aftertaste.But with this marinade I don't get that at all!!The taste is so great,it could just as well be chicken!!I love it!

I do cut back on both the sugar and the oil for dieting purposes,but it comes out great anyway!!This is a real favorite in our house,liked by all(fish and non fish lovers)

This recipe puts twist on the trditional salmon. I have made this about 3 times. Mak sure u let the fish sit in the marinade for 3 hours. I found this to be much juicer than the first time when I let it sit for 2 hours.

This was really good! I only was able to marinate it for about 45mins, but I flipped a few times while soaking. I also added minced garlic to the marinade. Then I made foil tents (with cracks to breathe), added some marinade and baked at 425 for 15 mins. Then I uncovered and broiled for 5 mins. Turned out really good. My BF loved it, and cleaned his plate. I made with almond rice and broiled veggies. Next time I will add a sprinkle of cayenne to the marinade. Keeper!

YUMMY!! Starting mixing ingredients and realized, didn't have brown sugar.  Used HONEY as a sub (healthier option). Had one (1) pound of fish, so I cut the recipe in half, about 1/6 of the ingredients. Omitted the water. Poured liquid over the top, with salmon swimming a bit. Baked in glass baking dish on 425, for 15min NO foil. Flavors are awesome!! Going to use a baking sheet next time to get more caramelized.

Excellent!  My whole family loved it, wonderful sweet taste.  We don't have a grill so I cooked our salmon in a convection oven and it turned out super moist.  Couldn't ask for anything better.

This is amazing. With it being November in the upper midwest I decided to skip the grill and bake it. I did everything according to the recipe, until the cooking part. I put a layer of 2 cups frozen green beans in a square casserole dish and laid the fillets on top, pouring the marinade over the fillets. Then baked at 425 for 15 minutes, basted, and baking 10 minutes longer. Amazing dish, the flavors were perfect, and my 3 year old son finished his whole plate in minutes!

Hands down the best salmon marinade. I made this tonight with fresh caught coho salmon and only marinated 15 minutes - still brilliant on the grill. A variation of this recipe includes adding a tablespoon or two of fresh ginger, which I recommend.

I only had 30 minutes of marinade time, so I basted it as it cooked...and it was soooo good. Can't wait to have it again when I can let it marinade longer. Really, really good.

This was delicious and amazing!  We all loved the little crispy parts so next time I might try to let it cook a little longer.  My 3 and 5 year old girls asked for extra helpings.  Makes you feel like a good mommy when your kids want to eat healthy food.. and lots of it!

I made the marinade exactly as directed but didn't grill my salmon; I baked it in foil packets as suggested in a review, allowing some air in the packets for air circulation.  425 degrees for 15 minutes = perfect salmon!! I will definitely be using this recipe again for salmon, no matter how it's cooked!!

Simple, easy, delicious! I thought adding salt to this recipe was a bit redundant because soy sauce is very salty, so I skipped it and didn't miss it! Otherwise I'd say this recipe is darn near perfect.

Absolutely amazing!!! I marinated it over night and used minced garlic instead of garlic powder. It was so easy to make... I can't believe how delicious it was! I was ready to make it again the following night. I'm planning use this marinade on chicken and beef too, I'll update my review after I try it.

A must try for grilled salmon. The marinade adds to the overall taste and blends perfectly with the salmon.
I did use olive oil.
Thanks for sharing.

Fantastic marinade! Great combination of flavors that really compliment the salmon. I skipped the lemon pepper and salt (husband's high blood pressure) and added some fresh ground black pepper and juice of a small lemon. Also used jared minced garlic and olive oil. As other reviewers mentioned I baked and then broiled it, and also did a reduction on the marinade to serve over the salmon and some rice. The sauce on top was delicious. Can't wait to make this again.

AMAZING!  Like another reviewer had suggested, I baked this at 425 for 15 minutes in foil.  I followed the recipe exactly - doesn't need any changes!  Will be making this many many more times.

I love salmon and I usually cook it in teriyaki sauce. Didn't have any last night, so tried this instead. It was FANTASTIC! My husband was grilling brats and dogs and i threw the salmon on the grill wrapped in tin foil. Turned out so moist and the marinade was superb!

Really a nice recipe. This is very simple to prepare, and I'd rank it as the best salmon recipe our family has ever attempted. My wife and I both enjoyed it and will make it a regular main course. We followed the recipe precisely.

Great basic marinade recipe for Salmon.  Made exactly as written and it turned out perfect.  Grilled it on my calphalon grill pan on the stove top and it turned out beautiful with gorgeous grill marks.  I served it with Asparagus w/Balsamic Butter, also from this site, and Rice Pilaf... Thanks tinamenina!

This was my first attempt at ever cooking fish, and it turned out great. As one reviewer suggested baking it; that is exactly what I did. Grilling will be my next attempt on this, but as far as the ingredients go, it was good.

I don't usually like cooked salmon, but this changed my mind.  I baked the fish in the oven in foil tents at 425 for approx. 17 min.  Very moist and flavorful. Will make again.

Love this recipe.  I did leave out the salt as the soy sauce was salty enough. This marinade is a good way to get my family to eat fish.

This was so delicious!!  The only modification we had was half the sugar.  The flavor on the grill was outstanding!  I have a feeling that this will be served a lot during lent.  We served it with grilled asparagus (salt, pepper, olive oil...some sprinkled parmesan cheese on it too).  We also had grilled pineapple (2 tbsp honey, 1 tbsp lime juice, 1 tbsp olive oil mixed with about a tsp of cinnamon as a marinade - see MayoClinic's recipe). We really enjoyed this salmon recipe!

Another favorite salmon recipe! We used to eat this one the most when we weren't on a budget. No adjustments needed but I do bake instead of grilling. Im afraid of having the fish fall apart when flipping. I wished I had one of those fish basket/holder.

This is my go-to recipe whenever I am feeling lazy but want some nice, healthy dinner. Super easy and yummy. I don't necessarily use lemon pepper or extra salt to go with the marinade because marinade itself adds perfect taste to the fish.

Easy and flavorful. Marinated it for hours to let that flavor get in there. Served with sauteed green beans that I added a little soy sauce to and topped with sesame seeds, spinach salad and pasta. Was a big hit with the family and our guests! :)

Thanks for a great recipe. I modified mine slightly to 2 tbsp soy sauce, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 2 tbsp olive oil, 1 tbsp butter and 3 minced cloves of garlic with salt and pepper to taste. The water is essential so the marinade doesnt dry out. I served it with lemon slices and rice.

this turned out very good. i actually baked it in foil, but did not modify the ingredients at all. the best part is that that these are all items that i always keep in stock in my kitchen, so making it is a snap!

Absolutely SUPERB! This is the first time I've enjoyed the frozen salmon steaks that we get from Costco here in Korea. It is hard to get rid of that fishy taste from frozen fish, but this recipe did the trick! My husband and I LOVED it!

This was the first and only recipe I've tried for Salmon. It's great! I have a recipe for the White Sauce they serve at Hibachi Restaurants, and it goes along perfectly with this.

This recipie was sooooo good!  It's always a hit when I make it.  I like to marinate the fish around 6-8 hours.  It doesn't seem to mess with the texture of the fish.  The second time I made this, I added a teaspoon or so of toasted sesame oil which was pretty good.  Note, I would cook the flesh part first on the grill before the skin side so that the skin will keep the fish together as you lift it off the grill.

I know most reviewers love this, but in my opinion, it ruined the taste of the salmon.  Our salmon is from Lake Superior, and the best way to fix it is to get it on the grill as soon as you get it out of the lake.

If I'd tried this before Asian Salmon, I'd probably give it a four star rating.  Asian Salmon very similar, but it has sesame oil.  Mmmmm!  Other than that, they are very similar.  As others have said, if you like salmon, you'll probably want to try another recipe - only because the marinade is very concealing of the salmon taste.  I'm in the group that doesn't care for salmon, but keep eating it because it's so good for you.  'Sticking with Asian, but this one's good, too.  With asian, double ingredients except for oil.  :)

Wow. This was really tasty! Both my wife and I really enjoyed the flavor. I followed the recipe exactly; but for those of you who thought it was too salty or too bland remember that 3 ingredients are "too taste". For me, I used skinless cuts and prepped a charcoal grill with apple wood chips. I lightly sprinkled each side with salt, but then was slightly more generous with the garlic powder and even more so with the lemon pepper. I rubbed the spices in a little before marinating for a good 2.5+ hours. Great!

This was good though  I thought it was a bit salty. I think next time I would use reduced sodium soy sauce or maybe reduce the amount. I also ended up baking it in the oven to save some time and it came out nice and moist. Next time I do wan t to try it grilled.

Best marinade for salmon I ever had.  It is now the only one I use.  The trick is the longer it marinades the better.  I didn't change anything else.  I cook the salmon on a cedar plank that I soak for serveral hours.  The taste is incredible.  Even family members who don't like fish love this.

I totally had every intention of grilling these but t-storm let loose. I follow Elizabeth's advice from 11.2009 (including changing some of the ingredients) baked them in oven at 400 for 15 min next to the bacon-wrapped asparagus. I will definitely make again!

PRETZEL CRUSTED version!  Remove the salmon from the marinade and bread it with crushed pretzels.  Place it in a cast iron skillet with oil preheated, turning when browned.  Remove salmon at desired doneness and set aside.  Pour marinade into skillet, add one squeezed lemon, and bring to a boil.   The pretzel crumbs that fell off the salmon will thicken the sauce.   Pour over salmon.  This dish was WONDERFUL!

I used high end olive oil instead of the vegetable oil and replaced the lemon pepper with a little black pepper and fresh squeezed lemon juice and swapped out the garlic powder for some real garlic. And used a bit less soy sauce than called for. And I broiled it instead of grilled. Which changed just about everything ... but I was *inspired* by this recipe and it came out awesome.

This was 'ok', I want to try it again as I don't think the salmon we used was the best quality. Used Wild Caught Chum Salmon I got on sale. It was the first time grilling a plank of salmon like this so I will try again at some point. It was tasty but after awhile the after-taste got to you.

Love this- easy and quick enough for a school night! A few tips of my own: sub 1/4 c honey for the sugar; use fresh lemon juice (2tbs); Omit salt and opt for a clove or two of fresh garlic. I line my grill with foil, grill skin side up first, flip, and then top seared fish with thinly sliced lemon rounds for remainder of cook time. Delish!

I don't really like salmon, but I made this for my husband and he loved it. He said this is the way he wants his salmon cooked from now on. I only made two changes: I marinated it overnight instead of for 2 hours and cooked in a foil package in the oven instead of on the BBQ.

This is the only salmon recipe we use.  We had tons of salmon due to a very productive fishing trip.  We marinate it for about 2+ days though.  Really good.  People who normally won't touch salmon, love it.

A great go-to marinade for salmon. I cut the brown sugar down to 1 heaping tablespoon; cut the salt altogether; and used a lite soy sauce which still lent a salty kick. Baked in foil packets at 425 for 15 minutes - POIFECT!

This is pretty great!  I omitted the salt because of there being so much salt in the soy sauce and it was perfect.  Couldn't improve on it if I tried.

Great easy recipe with only one thing I would change next time I make this, which was my fault.  For me, it wasn't overpowering with soy sauce or sweet flavor (I did use low sodium soy sauce).   My fillets had the skin on one side still.  So, I had a great flavor on one side, but the other side didn't.  I should have went with my first thought to remove the skin.  Next time I will remove the skin.

Yum! My husband and I love this salmon recipe! My in-laws liked it also when we served it to them.  The only thing that I did differently is that I substituted lemon juice and pepper for the lemon pepper. ~enjoy!

This is super fantastic. I love the salty soy combined with the sweet sugar. Didn't change a thing.

This salmon recipe is amazing.  Salmon can be so boring.  This recipe is super easy and soooo tasty, you'll think you're in a high-priced restaurant.   My only change: I only cook approximately .75 lbs of salmon at a time and don't adjust the marinade -- recipe suggests 1.5 pounds.  It doesn't over power the salmon and because salmon has such a strong flavor to being with, I like the stronger marinade.    In fact, if I made 1.0 - 1.5 pounds, I'd double the marinade.  Also, winters are too cold to grill, so I have baked these and they work just fine.    Try this recipe!

WOW!!!  The flavor was tremendous.  This is definetly one to keep.  I only made a few changes.  Since I don't keep brown sugar handy, I used molasses crystals (a raw sugar.  I also seared the fish in a saute pan.  When the fish was cooked through, I removed the fish and reduced the sauce. The sauce is an excellent complement on the fish as well as on the oven roasted asparagus.  Delicious!  This one I will make again!  B.J.

This recipe was FANTASTIC! Quite frankly I’m not a fish person at all BUT I tried this recipe and surprisingly, I was able to eat and enjoy it. The simple changes that I made for a quicker meal were in step 1 I squeezed lemon juice from 1 1/2 lemon and used about 2tsp of black pepper instead of lemon pepper to season the fillets. For Step 2 I added an extra 1/3 cup of brown sugar (we love a little extra sweetness) then placed the mixture and fillets in a freezer bag and put that into the freezer for about 40-45 minutes since I didn’t have the extra 2 hours. Instead of using a grill that I don’t have yet I used Elizabeth’s Review/Advice and made “a little foil packet for each fillet and close it up, leaving a little room for air to circulate inside. If you bake the foil packets on a cookie sheet at 425 for about 15 minutes (slightly longer depending on number of fillets)” the salmon did cook to perfection while so tender and marinating in its own juices inside of the foil packets.

This was so simple and it tasted SO good. I baked 1.8lbs of salmon at 425 for about 20 min and it turned out perfect. Thanks!

Absolutely amazing! I don't even usually like salmon, but this was awesome. Even the kids loved it and my daughter is so finicky, we can't usually find anything she likes! We will definitely be cooking this again. I cooked exactly as written-no substitutes or modifications.

This is a great tasting recipe.  The only thing I did was add crushed garlic to the marinade rather then using garlic powder on the fish.  I also cooked in the oven in the marinade then used the left over marinade to put on my rice.  IT was delicious!

I opted to use the bake/broil method since I ran out of propane for my grill. I baked it at 450 for 12 minutes and broiled it for 5 min. It tasted awesome and the only thing I'd recommend when using this method is use lemon juice and pepper to make it not so salty to the taste buds. Other than that the recipe was AWESOME!!! I served it with brown rice, corn (for my picky hubby and son)and brocoli and cheese (for myself).

This was super tasty! I have tried many different ways to cook/grill salmon.. and have to say this is the best to date. My husband - who usually doesn't like salmon, gobbled it up - as did my five year old and of course me!

It was sweet.. but not too sweet.. and had a great crust over the very edges of the fish.. and to top it off the color after you cook it makes it LOOK as amazing as it tasted..

I made no changes to the recipe.

thanks for sharing it! It's a new family favorite :)

This is fantastic. I don't usually eat baked salmon but really liked this. Served to company and everyone gave it two thumbs up. Followed the recipe except used lemon juice instead of lemon pepper seasoning and did it in the oven in foil packets at 425 as some had suggested. Definite keeper.

I know why this recipe is so highly reviewed---it is fabulous!  The brown sugar lends a delightful sweetness and the soy adds just the right complexity to the dish. However, I didn't have any lemon pepper in the house so I used lemon juice and black pepper and eliminated the water. It's a real winner and one of the best salmon recipes out there. Thank you for posting it!

Really tasty way of making salmon. I didn't have time to grill so I used the advice of making foil packets and cooking in the over. This worked out well. I can't wait to try it on the grill!

I used a T. of lemon juice instead of lemon pepper. I didn't think this recipe needed any extra salt due to the soy sauce, so I didn't add it. We thoroughly enjoyed this easy and tasty recipe.

Have made this dish twice now! It gets rave reviews from anyone who eats it. The salmon is best when it is marinated for longer than two hours though. I did for two days but even overnight would be better than just two hours!!

This was delicious! Will be making this again. Made this dish for Mother's Day and it was a huge hit. We all felt that eating the salmon this way was better than going to a restaurant. I did marinate the salmon over night and feel like if it hadn't been it wouldn't have been as flavorfull. Marinate for atleast 12 hours. I actually use almost this same marinade. Increase all ing. to 1 cup, leave out oil and lemon pepper and add a roast that is thinly sliced, marinate from 12-24 hours then grill. Yummy

So delicious & really simple. Had to bake this instead of grilling, but not a problem. Baked at 400 degrees for about 15 min, w/o turning. Great flavor & so tender. I'll be making this one again.

Simple mix of basic ingredients yet still still flavorful! I didn't have lemon pepper, so I used black ground pepper & lemon juice. Added a small spoon of crushed chili/garlic from a jar fo hint of spice. Marinated it over in 1.5 hrs & still came out great on the grill, 7-8 mins on each side.

I love this recipe! It's the only way my daughter will eat salmon. I used lemon juice & pepper instead of lemon pepper( I was out). It was delicious.

I would leave out the water in order to make the glaze thicker.  Also, be careful how thick you salmon... the thinner the salmon the more the glaze gets into the meat.

Excellent!  It was storming outside so instead of grilling I baked the salmon in foil packets at 425 for 15 minutes and they were perfect.  I drizzled fresh lemon juice on them right before baking.  Excellent flavor and simple to make.

This was good - I did not use lemon pepper seasoning, but I did use lemon juice and pepper.  I also cut back on the amt of oil because it seemed like too much.  It was about 10 degrees out, so grilling was out of the question for me - i baked in the oven and it came out fabulous!!!!

This was very good!  We did the foil packet at 425 for 15/20 min and it was great.  The only changes I made was fresh lemon juice and pepper instead of the lemon pepper.  I also marinated this longer than 2 hours based on a couple of reviews.

Very tasty and easy.  I used lemon juice and pepper, like others did.  I also forgot to add vegetable oil, but it was still great.  I cooked in aluminum foil packet in toaster oven at 450 for 25 minutes.

I think salmon is a difficult dish to prepare. I really don't like it with just lemon butter and herbs, so I was thinking this recipe could be a winner and it definitely was.

I was worried that with the lemon pepper seasoning, the fish would be just way too salty, but it wasn't. I only marinated it for 2 hours so next time I hope to marinate for about 4-6. Even so, it was really good.

I served this over the "Indian Style Basmati Rice" recipe from this site. The rice is made with a stick of cinnamon... which I thought really complimented the fish and marinade. 

We didn't have a grill so I put the fillets skin side down on a glass baking dish. Baked at 450 for 15 minutes and broiled for 5-6 minutes.

I LOVE this recipe! I haven't been able to eat or make many fish dishes because my fiance doesn't care for seafood.  But upon his first bite he said, "Wow, I wasn't that hungry but this salmon is making me hungry!" I bought a 1.5lb boneless filet at Costco, used olive oil because I didn't have vegetable oil, and I marinated it overnight. Based off of another review, I put the salmon in foil packets (I cut the filet into 2 because it was really big) and in the oven at 450 for 15 minutes. The salmon was cooked perfectly and it was very moist. I also threw sliced mushrooms, butter, and garlic powder into a separate foil packet and cooked it in the oven with the salmon. Next time I think I'll throw diced tomatoes and onions with the salmon.

WOOO HOOO! Boy did my wife like this! It was raining really hard out last night, so instead of grilling I prepared this inside. I used a whole lemon’s juice and rough ground pepper instead of the lemon-pepper stuff. Also, I simply mixed it into the soy sauce/brown sugar sauce instead of directly to the fish. I placed the fish, with all the sauce, in a Ziploc bag and let it sit in the fridge for 2 hours as recommended, turning it every so often. I then took a glass casserole dish and wiped olive oil on the bottom. I placed the filet, skin side down in the dish. I also poured a little extra sauce over the fish. Baked at 450°F for 12 minutes, then broiled for 10, as suggested in another review, it came out perfect!  I served this with steamed rice and steamed carrots. Mmmmm.. We’ll be eating this again!

This is an excellent salmon marinade! I've made similar marinades before (using maple syrup vs brown sugar) for baking salmon, but somehow this was the best I've ever tasted - perhaps because this was grilled! I followed the advice of 1 T oil and substituted lemon juice and fresh minced garlic for the powders, and marinated in the fridge for 30 hrs. Against all odds (never before grilled fish, and very finicky about salmon), the fillets stayed intact and came out delicious - even better chilled the next day for salads!

Very tasty. We liked the sweet flavor that the brown sugar added. Only marinated for about a half hour, and cooked on the indoor grill. They were very easy and turned out great!

Very nice! I ran out of time and ended up marinating them overnight and grilling them the following afternoon. Had a very nice "Japanese-grilled fish" taste. If anyone does marinate overnight, I'd suggest halving the soy sauce as it really soaks in and dominates the flavor. I'd also freshen with another splash of OJ about an hour before preparing.

This was a very good marinade, I ended up putting it in the oven at 350 for about 40 minutes and it came out perfect. Next time per requests from my family I might add a little crushed red pepper or chile oil for a little kick.

my husband doesn't really like salmon;i love it.  typically, when I want salmon, i make him tilapia (broiled tilapia parmesan).  this recipe may have changed that.  he tried my salmon last night (after finishing off his tilapia) & he actually told me the next time I cook this salmon to make him one.  that must tell you something about this recipe!!

5 stars for being a good, healthy and easy dish. I broiled instead of grilled just because of the weather.

I've made this recipe about a dozen times and never get tired of it.  It is very tasty and just a different way of preparing salmon.  LOVE IT!!

Use a fish basket if grilling--falls apart easily.

Both my boyfriend and I thought this was great! I baked it instead of grilling (30 min. at 350) and I didn't have time to marinde prior so I just made a lot of extra glaze and basted the fish a few times during the baking. Also, I added some crushed pecans to the top of the fish. Served it with field greens and some asian dressing (recipe also from the site)

Will definately make again!

I, like others, baked the salmon for 45 minutes at 400.  Didn't have lemon pepper so I added a few drops of lemon juice.  Turned out very good.  Served with rice and steamed cauliflour.

Overall excellent recipe, good taste. Used 2 tbsp lemon pepper and 1/2 tsp garlic salt. As another user suggested, save the marinade for use as a dipping sauce.  Much better this way.  Also, make sure to cook thoroughly to avoid "fishy" taste.  If you're using the George Foreman grill, you'll need to cook longer than the 4 1/2 minute suggested time.  About 8 minutes should be right.

This was excellent! 

Although the heat needs to be medium to keep from overcooking, the grill needs to be hot to keep the salmon from sticking. Excellent for the family and great to serve to guests.

This is the best recipe for salmon marinade of all on this site. We do not like pepper much in our family, so I substituted 2 tblsp. lemon JUICE for it and put the juice in the marinade. I also added 1 tblsp. GINGER to the marinade. What a marvelous taste sensation. I also like the fact that there is a LOT of marinade...most recipes are too skimpy on it. We use a double-sided indoor grill that cooks evertyhing very quickly, so a very deep marinade is needed to retain the flavor. I marinade most of the day prior to dinnertime. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is my favorite salmon recipe ever!  My husband requests this meal often.  I usually add a tsp. of minced garlic to the marinade and let it sit overnight.  The flavor is amazing!  No fishy taste at all and so simple to make.  Thanks Tina!

Simply elegant dish! I only used half the oil for the marinade but I added some chopped ginger and minced garlic. With a side of steamed rice and stir-fry veggies, this dish was a winner tonight!!!

This is a delicious and easy way to serve salmon.  We've served this often to my husband's business guests -- guests regularly ask for the recipe.  Even our daughter who doesn't like fish will eat this!  High praise!  I add minced garlic to the marinade instead of using the garlic powder.  Thanks for a great recipe!

AWESOME!  I don't care for salmon, but my husband brought home fillets so we tried this recipe with only an hour to marinade.  My husband was wowing after each bite.  I liked the edges where the marinade had time to soak in as it took away the fishy taste of salmon.  I know I would absolutely love this if marinated longer. DELICIOUS, no changes needed.

The best salmon recipes so far on this website! Omit the oil and the water for a less fatty salmon! :) Amazing! The brown sugar and soy sauce is spectacular! Make cuts in the fish to soak the sauce in! :) Much better than the dijon salmons! :)

This is the first marinade recipe for salmon that my husband and I tried, and we both love it! The soy sauce and brown sugar add a great sweetness to the fish. We marinate the salmon as long as possible for the most flavor.

This is a great recipe and very flavorful.  I was surprised given how simple the marinade was.  I added a dash of sesame oil to enhance the aroma.  On the lowest setting of my propane grill, it only took about 4 minutes on both sides to cook.

This was a really quick, easy and delicious meal to prepare.  Instead of grilling it on an outside grill, I did it on a George Foreman grill and it tasted great.  My husband enjoyed it as well and we will definately cook it again.  Will have to try it on the outside grill to see if it makes a difference.

Easy and delicious!!  The most my husband says about meals is okay or good.  He RAVED about the salmon.  "Awesome, wonderful, this is better than I've had at restaurants, we could serve this to company and see, even the kids ate it up."  This is the most he has complimented any meal I've made in 20 years.  We all enjoyed it!

Good recipe.  Be very liberal with the garlic.  I wrapped the fillets in foil and baked them at 425° for ~20 minutes.

Did this for Father's  day. It was a big hit. I grilled and let it sit. I don't recommend  that. It got too dry.

This was a delicious marinade with ingredients we normally have in the house.  This recipe's a keeper.

Can not praise this highly enough!  A staple in our kitchen, and especially popular with our 12 y/o who claims to hate fish (go figure).

Cooking option...in the non-bbq season, I'll do this in a 350F oven at about 13 minutes per side. (Lining the baking sheet with foil makes clean-up easier.)

I agree with the other posters.  This is a great recipe and if you do it right, it will taste just like what you get at a restaurant. I have never had luck before with grilling salmon, but that has changed after following some tips from the other reviewers. First of all I made the marinade exactly as it's stated in the recipe, although I did not add any additional salt to taste.  I used skin-on wild sockeye salmon, marinated it for two hours and then grilled it on an oiled grate with the flesh side down first, on medium-high heat (gas grill).  After about 7 minutes, it had nice grill marks and I flipped it for another 7 minutes.  While it was grilling, I boiled the marinade and used it as a sauce on top of the salmon when serving.  It was perfect and even my husband who does not like fish and my elementary aged kids loved it.

This is simply amazing!  Followed recipe exactly, and tried it on my new grill. Nearly broke my arm patting myself on the back, it was so good!  Would be an excellent company dish.

I really liked this recipe even though I didn't quite follow the instructions. I live in an apartment complex, don't own a grill and am to lazy to clean the complex grill. So I broiled it instead. I flipped it a few times in my oven and glazed it with the marinade each time I did and it came out great :). It was very difficult to save half of the salmon for my boyfriend as intended lol.

great marinade, also works wonderfully baked in the oven covered with foil. I've found that you can skip the 2 hour wait if you oven bake.

This is delicious and super easy to make, even for a beginner like me! I followed the recipe to the letter, except for the grilling part. Instead, I popped it in the oven for 15 minutes at 425 F, as another reviewer suggested. And it came out delicious! The salmon was cooked all the way through, but still very moist, tender, and flaky. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Wonderful flavor! Rubbed dry ingredients and let them see overnight then let the liquid marinate on the salmon during the day. Very pleased with this recipe and we will use it again-maybe on a different seafood like shrimp!

This recipe tastes very similar to a Vietnamese dish I grew up with - ca kho. I followed this recipe exactly and loved it; I'm glad I stumbled upon this, it reminds me a little bit of home. The only thing I might recommend is making a little less marinade? I felt like I had to throw out quite a bit of good liquid.

Amazing!  I love fish, but have only ever ruined it when I try cooking it myself, and I've never attempted to grill it.  This recipe turned out perfectly for me on the first attempt!  I didn't have lemon pepper, so just squeezed a lemon and used black pepper.  I love the tinfoil tip I read from a few others: put the skin side down on a piece of tinfoil, carefully flipped the fish off onto the grill, and the skin stuck to the tinfoil.  Voila!  It was like magic; I hate picking fish away from the skin while it's on my plate.  

Highly recommend this recipe, even suitable for amateur fish grillers.  :)

I am not usually a salmon lover. But this recipe proved otherwise! It was delicious!!! I didn't have 2 hrs to marinate, so only marinated for about 45 min. Also no lemon pepper, so as another person did, I added a little squirt of fresh lemon and a drop of lemon juice to the marinade. I also read a review where they said to grill the fish side 1st to lock in the flavor - good advice. It was so easy and so good!

This was so easy and tasty.  We love salmon and this is going into regular rotation.  I don't think I changed anything, other than that I sometimes only marinate for 1/2 hour and it's still great.

Oh my God this was amazing. I use Tamari instead of Soy Sauce to cut down on gluten (no difference in taste) and I added ginger to the marinade which just made it even more delicious. Recommend spraying the grill with olive oil spray first, then grill flesh-side down first then flip to skin. 7 minutes per side is perfect for medium. We actually got farm-raised instead of wild-caught but we did it at Whole Foods who swear their farm-raised is healthy, non-everythingthat'sbadforyou and hey, it happened to be dollars cheaper. Maybe the best dinner I've made in ages. Served with warm black lentil salad and braised spinach (a la Lidia Bastianich). So healthy, so yummy. Yay!

Made this tonight exactly as written and dinner was AWESOME! Hubby and I are not big salmon fans and I don't even care for fish but for health reasons, we've been forced to change our eating habits which of course, includes a lot more fish in our menu plans.  Hubby couldn't stop raving about this salmon tonight and I ate every bite of mine.  Served with Greek Salad I from here on the AR site, this was a restaurant quality dinner served at home tonight.  Thanks for posting.

For a healthier version and just as tasty I substituted Honey for the Brown Sugar, Olive Oil for the Veg Oil and used fresh garlic instead of powdered, marinated slightly longer for a fuller flavor and broiled in the Oven 5 minutes each side. Wa La! Yummy Salmon!  Thank you for this recipe :+)

Excellent on the BBQ or broiled in the oven.  I've also used trout instead of Salmon.

I had a few friends over for dinner. My girlfriend won't eat any kind of fish of seafood. I got her to try a little bit, and she liked it. Another guest said he's never had Salmon that he liked, but he loved it. Very good

This was excellent.  I didn't have much time for the marinade and only did so for about 20 min.  I'm sure it would be even better if marinaded longer!  I did not add any salt, I try not to cook with it unless it is something that absolutely needs it, this didn't.  Also, I used olive oil instead of vegetable. We are trying to eat healthier and this one is a keeper! Thanks!

Omg! We had this tonight and it was AMAZING! My pickest eater husband even loved it and ate an entire piece! 
I made a couple changes from reviews. Added 1/3 c  fresh squeezed lemon juice to the marinade instead of water. Then baked in a foil packet at 425° for 14 min then opened the packet, basted the fish with juices moved to top rack and cooked for additional 3 min. Was perfect!!! (Oh yeah... I slowly poured 1/4 cup of the marinade over the fish before sealing the packet).

Salmon is a favorite for my family but I'd never cooked it before. This recipe was delicious! I cooked it on the griddle and it turned out great. I used a 1/4 of brown sugar instead of the 1/3 noted in the recipe, but followed the other instructions as listed. This is a must cook dish!

Yummy, but basically tastes like teriyaki salmon. Can achieve similar taste with only 3 ingredients.

I love this recipe!!! I added dried chopped onions to the seasoning but everything else was exact. My family loved it as well and they all had seconds even my husband who doesn't like fish. I added this to my favorites so I will definitely make this again.

I really like salmon and have had it many times prepared a few different ways. I found this to be the most delicious recipe and best tasting salmon ever. I did not have lemon pepper so I am unsure to the taste difference. Instead I used regular pepper. I make this every time I grill salmon now. Better than any restaraunt. Simple and fantastic.

Wonderful! We didn't have time to marinade the fish for the full two hours, but it still turned out great.  I didn't use any salt (I forgot) but we didn't miss it at all.  This recipe is a keeper!

Thank you! I've made this twice in 1 month. I've always grilled fish but live in a NYC apt. now without a grill, so I was searching for a recipe to do in the oven & followed Elizabeth's review from 11/9/07. My husband & I split 1 pound of fish, so I scale back on the marinade proportions a bit & substitute with olive oil & lemon juice. I've only had time to marinate for 30 min. in small casserole dish which I then cover in foil to bake (with the marinade) - so easy! Baked for 13 min. at 425, then opened the foil (covering the more done portions) & broiled 2 min. to finish.The sauce carmalizes on top & is so good spooned onto the fish at the table.Thank you!

Awesome recipe!  I made this to put over salad for a few dinner guests and it was a hit. The only changes were the addition of lots of fresh lemon juice, quartered grape tomatoes, not using the lemon pepper seasoning, and cooking it in the oven, foil covered, at 400 for about 25 minutes. The sauce was so good that we used it as dressing for the salad.

Simple, tasty, and quick - a winner to add to the regular weeknight rotation!

Made a few modifications:
- marinated for only 20 min (prob better to do for longer, but I was short on time and it still tasted great)
- reduced sugar by half
- instead of grilling, cooked in oven in cast iron skillet (skin side down) at 425 for 14 min, then broiled for 1.5 min. Saved a bit of reserve marinade sauce to sprinkle over top at the end

OMG! This was the best salmon we have ever eaten. We use to not like cooked salmon, then we tried a lot of different recipes. Being up in the Northwest, we eat alot of fish, so this time we cook on a cedar plank on the BBQ, and with this recipe, it is awesome!

my problem with this recipe is the fact that it says to add the lemon pepper salt and garlic powder to taste I could really use some actual measurements to know how much of these to put. If I was going to make the fish to taste I wouldn't be looking up a recipe.

We love this recipe.  I never seem to have the lemon pepper so we just add Ginger and we never season the fish, we just put all ingredients into the ziplock and add the fish!  This is so good! Thank you so much for the recipe.

Tried this recipe as directed, but broiled instead of grilled. I liked it but my husband and boys did not (said too sweet). So, I tweaked it a bit and left out the brown sugar and water. Instead of marinating, I basted with the soy and olive oil (not vegetable) then sprinkled the seasonings on. Broiled for 8 minutes or until done. Tasty ~ very tasty!

I make this recipe weekly.  It is delicious and the only way my husband likes his salmon prepared.  I have cooked it on the grill as well as baked it in the oven.  Excellant either way.

I had guests over for venison back strap and one of the girlfriends did not eat meat so i prepared this salmon on the grill along with the venison.  The entire dinner party loved both!  I am making this again tonight for dinner for my boyfriend since it went so fast at the party.

I made this recipe with some small changes.  Instead of using garlic powder I added one tsp. minced garlic in the marinade.  This is a great idea for someone who prefers fresh garlic to the powdered. I used regular pepper on the salmon and to get the lemon taste I added one tbs. of lemon juice to the marinade.

I actually NEVER liked salmon. I usually stay far away from it. However, I absolutely LOVED this!!!! I wanted to find a way to make myself eat salmon and I must say thank you for helping me find an option! I marinated the salmon in the sauce for around 3 hours and then I put it in a foil packet and poured some of the juice over it and baked it at 425 for about 18 minutes. I then served it up with a simple side salad.

Very easy to make and very tasty! I skipped the lemon pepper because of allergies, but I replaced it with 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice, which I add to the mix along with all the other ingredients. 
You can even make it the night before so the next day your meal will be ready in less than 20 minutes! Try it, I've converted the non-believers into fans of salmon thanks to this recipe!

Love this! Made it twice now, and I measured the seasonings: I used 1/4 teaspoon of McCormick's lemon pepper (but you could substitute regular pepper and a bit of salt), 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder.  I used NO salt but added one Tablespoon of lemon juice. The soy sauce makes it salty enough.  I think you could get by with half the entire recipe if you don't have a lot of fish.  Also, I just throw all the ingredients into a ziplock bag, mix and add the salmon pieces.  It was great with less than an hour marinating.  I use two small grill trays from the dollar store, take them outside to spray with olive oil Pam, then sandwich the fish and put on a preheated grill. Makes them easy to turn using oven mitts and they don't stick to the grill. Leftovers were so delicious too, just cold for lunch - yum!  Thank you, Tinamenina!

I just love this recipe as does everyone i feed it to. Just be careful not to overcook it like i did the first time. I am an old man and even I can hit a home run with this one. I serve it with wild rice and carrots steamed in butter. YUMMY

I've made this as written a couple of times and everyone loves it.  If you don't want to use the grill, it works great in the oven as others have said.

This last time, I put the marinated filets and the marinade in a small corning dish.  I cooked it in a preheated 425 oven for 5 minutes to get the marinade hot, put on the glass lid and cooked it another 10 - perfect!

I fixed this salmon dish because my hubby is a big fan and he actually requested it for dinner a few nights later. We don't have a grill so it had to be baked at 425 for 20 minutes. Everything else was done the same way. The next time I make it I'll make some extra marinade to use as a dipping sauce.

I loved this!  I followed another reviewers suggestion and cooked it in foil packets in the oven.  So there was absoultely no clean up!  Now THAT is the way I like to cook.  The taste is just delicious.  Next time I would save more of the marinade to pour over the salmon.  I servied it over quinoa.  Yum!

Loved it! I made it twice. The second time I subsituted most of the brown sugar with pure Canadian maple syrup (1/3 of a cup maple syrup and 1 tbsp of brown sugar) just because maple syrup makes my life more amazing : ) It was just as equally delicious.
Both times I put three to four garlic cloves, minced, instead of the garlic powder (fresher).
I also added about a tablespoon of lemon juice to the marinade. 
I grilled the salmon in a bit of the marinade.

Important note: I would not marinate for more than half an hour. Two hours would completely take the taste of fish away, which I guess is fine for someone who doesn't like fish to begin with, but I love it. Just a matter of preference I guess.

I'm surprised this recipe has so many great reviews.  I made as stated except i used olive oil in place of veg oil.  I marinaded 4 hours and the taste was still a bit bland.  The delicious salmon recipe on this site is similar and sooooo much better.

I made this marinade tonight at the last minute and only let it marinate for about 20-30 minutes but it was still delicious.  A little on the sweet side, but I like it that way. Instead of placing the salmon directly on the grill, I put them on aluminum foil over the fire (sprayed with non-stick spray). The skin still gets crispy and brown without any flare-ups.  I turned them over after about 5-6 minutes and moved them to indirect heat, closed the lid of the grill and let them sit another 4 minutes or so. They were cooked perfectly.

Best salmon we've had.  Great recipe.  I had 2-3/4 lbs. of fish, which I cut into 5 fillets and marinated for a couple of hours.  Used lots of fresh cracked pepper in the marinade.  We grilled them in aluminum foil packets (with some air space above the fillets).  We kept them on the grill longer than the specified time, because the fillets were very thick.  Don't need to turn them over if you're using the foil packets method.  Absolutely delicious salmon!!

LOVED IT! However I didn't have time to marinate it as the recipe states, so I baked it in the marinade in the oven, then thickened the marinade with flour and made a dressing... Tasted PHENOMENAL!

Delicious! It complements the salmon perfectly- I was never a salmon fan, but this recipe has converted me! The seasonings and the marinade are tasty, and the saltiness of the soy sauce counters the fish and makes the salmon taste a bit sweet. The only thing I did was to completely leave out the salt, and I used olive oil instead of vegetable. Will make again and again!

All these flavors together are phenominal. The sweet, sour and salty really completement the strong fish flavors of the salmon. I had no lemon pepper, so I squeezed fresh lemon on first, then put it in the marinade.  I don't have an inside grill and it is raining outside, so I cooked it on the broiler. The brown sugar caramelized with the soy sauce and garlic.

Really enjoyed this! My husband and myself aren't big into fish at all but have been trying to eat much healthier and thought we would try this when there was a sale on salmon at our local store; I am glad we did. This really mellowed out the fishy taste but still left enough where you knew it was fish. Very pleasant flavoring! Paired with the suggested browned butter asparagus. YUM! I am pretty sure my 1 year old ate as much as my husband and I.

So Yummy!! Here are my revisions - I don't use any salt (because soy sauce has enough for my taste), I also use low sodium soy sauce, instead of 1/4 cup vegetable oil i use 1 tablespoon of olive oil. I also bake it in the oven at 450 for 12 minutes and then broil for 5. With this Salmon I serve ratouille over pasta - perfect light, healthy meal!!

I didn't have time to marinate so I did not use the water and just spread with sauce and placed in oven for 15 minutes at 450 degrees! perfect I also used fresh lemon/pepper before placing sauce on top.

This is an easy and delicious recipe! I substituted a huge clove of garlic in place of the garlic powder but followed the recipe otherwise. It took 30 minutes on the grill at about 400 degrees. I used a cedar plank on the grill - no flipping and the skin comes off! 
Thanks for sharing!

I did not care for this recipe. The taste was very bland and there was a funny smell to the marinade. I won't be cooking this ever again.

Wonderful flavor & very easy.  Added minced ginger & garlic. Marinaded for 3 hrs or & seared it in non-stick pan; 5 minutes with skin side up; then flip over & sear for 3 minutes. DO NOT overcook.  Heat the remaining marinade in saucepan to use as dipping sauce. Absolutely delicious! Can be used for other meats.

Love this recipe.  I leave out the lemon pepper because I'm not a big fan of it and sometimes add red pepper flakes.  It's been Salmon Sunday at my house the last few weeks. Some small filets and steak = good surf and turf!

This was the first time I've tried salmon and other than having to wait 2 hours, the recipe was simple and the salmon came out great! I had lemon pepper seasoning so omitted salt. Loved the ingredients because I'm not a cook and I had everything needed.

This was a very easy, yet tasty recipe. My kids usually only like fried fish. They really liked it and asked me to make more. My husband who doesn't like seafood at all tried this dish and is now willing to try this salmon dish again. Yay! This is a real winner!

I first printed this recipe almost a year ago, and it has become my 'go-to' marinade. I use it on salmon and steak both.  Even if I'm short on one ingredient or another - the overall flavors are still there.  This is absolutely an all around winner.  Last time I grilled salmon with this marinade, our dinner guests were amazed!  Definitely compliments the fish and works with it without being over powering!

This was ridiculously good. I mean GREAT! I have always just seasoned my Salmon with Kosher salt and fresh cracked pepper and have been satisfied. I always buy my fish fresh so I've never complained about the wonderful flavor that already exists in Salmon. However, I did want to try something new and just plain maple syrup squeezed on something so beautiful just doesn't seem to do it justice. So I decided to try this and I am so happy I did. My whole family LOVED this! I even used the exact same recipe and let it reduce on simmer in a pot and drizzled it on top. Thank you tinamenina for this awesome twist.

Such an easy, tasty way to prepare salmon!!  I cut the brown sugar in half and added several tbs. of honey and added a sesame seed/ginger Asian spice blend to the marinade, which was full flavor in the two hours I kept in in the fridge.  Baked for 20 min. in a 400 degree oven and it came out perfect!  Served w/ teriyaki potatoes, also on this site!! Mmmmmmm!

Wow... this is delicious!  Per another review, I tried this baked at 425 for 20 minutes (I had thick filets) and it was perfect!  Husband liked it too, even though he typically doesn't like cooked salmon.

Loved it!  I was looking for something similar to a teriyaki salmon and this was great. :)  Didn't have lemon pepper, so used some lemon juice and pepper.  Turned out wonderfully.  Didn't have time to marinate (didn't plan ahead - only marinated for 15 min), so when I put the salmon in the pan, I also poured some of the marinade in.  So tasty!

This had a really nice flavor. I definitely recommend marinating it for at least the full two hours listed in the instructions.

Good glaze for the salmon. It was a nice change from our typical (rosemary/garlic) way of preparing it. We had potatoes and asparagus to go with. Very good.

OMG is this marinade delicious! Best salmon marinade I have found so far - even better because it uses ingredients that everyone usually already has in their pantry. I have shared this marinade with coworkers and they rave about it as well. This recipe is a MUST!

Was an okay marinade. I added three whole lemons to the marinade the second time I made it. Juiced them and left them in the bag. Added a little more kick which was enjoyed all around.

This was probably the most flavorful salmon I have ever made!  I marinated for about an hour and it was perfect.  The only changes I made were to add a splash of lemon juice (didn't have lemon pepper), added a bit of pepper, used olive oil and baked in a foil packet for 12 minutes on 425.  I will make this over and over!  Thanks for the recipe!

I used to be intimidated by the grill, but with recipes like this my confidence is swiftly growing. Plus, any recipe that calls for everything I already keep on hand (excluding fish ;) earns instant points at my house. I picked out skinless salmon portions rather than full-size fillets, which were perfect for me and my husband. The only thing I did at all differently from the recipe was cut down the brown sugar by about half. I also had a tube of lemon grass puree, so I added a little over a tablespoon of that. I could not be happier with the way these flavors work together. The fish developed a light, delicate crisp crust that kept those flavors laced through the moist, flaky flesh. This will definitely be my go-to recipe for salmon on the grill.

Excellent flavor! One day, I was going to bake my salmon rather than grill it. I did not marinate the salmon; but put all other ingredients, except the oil, on the salmon filets. When the salmon was done baking, I had a little syrup-like sauce from the run-off, which was spooned over the salmon for added flavor. It was probably the best salmon I've ever eaten. The recipe is also great as written for the marinade/grill.

So very yummy!  My boys and husband loved this and ALL asked for seconds (my four year old went back for thirds).  I didn't have the time to marinade, so I just brushed some of the marinade onto the fish before baking and it was still wonderful.  This one gets filed with the family favorites in this house! :)

Kinda tweaked this a tad. I did'nt use lemon pepper, just lemon juice, because I wanted cut the water down so that it would stay thick- and not run off while cooking. And used Olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Threw in a little dill to punch it up-- color and texture turned out amazing! grilled on a cedar plank for 20 mins. Served with white rice seasoned with lemon and parsley. SO YUMMY!! :)

Basic, simple, love this salmon!  I actually made a test piece that I had for lunch to determine if the two men in my house would approve, I deemed it wonderful and made it for dinner that night (so I had it twice in one day and it was just as fabulous both times!) The guys loved it so much that I ended up making it twice for them that same week.  Again, simple and perfect! A+

My husband, who hates fish and usually gags when I convince him to try a bit, asked for seconds of this dish! I didn't have lemon pepper so I just used regular pepper and squeezed fresh lemon once the salmon was cooked. It was so delicious, I've been given the go ahead to make it regularly! Thank you.

Had all the ingredients, made it on the grill and my husband absolutely loved it. Great simple recipe. Plan to try it on trout next. I didn't use the salt, lemon pepper or garlic powder.

We loved this--great flavor, and so easy to make.  As a reviewer suggested, I added one-third cup of fresh lemon juice, and it really enhanced the marinade.  Next time,  I think I will use less sugar--it will be even better if it is a little less sweet. My fillets were skinless, so I placed them on a piece of heavy foil, and they came out just perfect.  This is a great recipe--a keeper for sure!

Very easy. Used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and these turned out great. I will leave them on the grill a little longer next time for that outer crunch. YUMMY, making again this week!!

This is by far one of the best recipes for Salmon I have ever had. When I make this recipe I always cook more than what we need and make a salad the next day with my salmon over it. So good!!

I have had this both ways, with the oil in the marinade and without. Both ways are delicious, I will admit that it is better with the oil but without is still awesome and fewer calories.

My husband followed the recipe to a "T" and it was awesome. The outside had a nice crunch to it, while the inside was moist and tasty. Fresh caught in Alaska, we enjoy new recipes. This one is a hit!

We didn't like the sweetness.  A quality piece of salmon is best cooked simply and this was too cloying.

I skipped the lemon pepper, and garlic powder all together, as I thought that lemon might steal away from the sweetness(though not overly) and richness of the salmon. In place of the garlic powder, I minced up a large clove of garlic and added it to the zip-loc bag along with the rest of the marinade and the fish. I let it soak for about 8-10 hours before throwing it onto the oiled and preheated grill. I put it flesh side down first, and then flipped it over as recommended. Just before it was finished cooking, I flipped it back over to put some perpendicular(fancy looking) grill marks on it, and I peeled off the unappetizing skin.

The sauce that I improvised to put on the salmon was three parts Sweet Baby Ray's Barbecue Sauce/ two parts honey/two parts soy sauce. It was phenomenal, everyone(except my uncle) put it on their fish, in great quantity. I suggest using low sodium soy sauce, as the dish does have a lot of soy sauce in it and it may taste quite salty if you don't.

I served the fish with a rice pilaf, and steamed asparagus, and also with a nice riesling from the Columbia Valley in California. The dinner was a smashing success.

Try the sauce.

This was good, but I felt like it covered the salmon flavor too much. It wasn't too sweet and was easy. (Kids didn't try it they had something else that night.)

This was SOOOOOOOO good!  Everyone loved it! The only thing I did different was to put the salmon in foil to cook it on the grill.  (I wrapped it up like a tin foil dinner that the Boy Scouts make) We'll have this again, and again, and again!

My husband and I agreed this was some of the best salmon I have ever made!  The only thing I added was some hot sauce for that spicy and sweet flavor I love.  Since we don't have a grill, I baked it in foil packets at 425 degrees for 15 minutes, and it turned out wonderful!

Nice flavor, but I only marinated for 2 hours because I was short on time.  I added a little honey to even out the strong soy sauce flavor and reduced the marinated on the stove to make a sauce.  Next time I will marinate over night to get the full flavor throughout the fish.

When I originally made this dish I was a little short on soy sauce but I think the brown sugar really appreciated it. This dish was phenomenal and I don't even care for salmon that much. As my first experience cooking salmon myself, this is definitely a keeper!

This is so amazingly easy to make! I decided on this recipe for my first time cooking salmon, I'm so glad I did! I used one of the previous suggestions of putting the fillets in foil packets and then broiled the packets in my toaster oven at 450 for 15 minutes. I cannot recommend this recipe highly enough!

Fantastic salmon recipe!  I seasoned the fillets, then let them sit in the plastic bag for 1 night without the marinade.  The following day, I added the marinade, and grilled them up that afternoon.  (I used my Foodsaver to "quick-marinade" the meat...works wonderful, and does the overnight job in about 20-25 minutes!)  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This recipe was awesome. Very easy to make. I took other reviewers advise and put fillets in aluminum foil. Salmon was juicy, delicious, and smelled awesome. I served it with rice and used some of the cooked sauce to pour over the white rice. Thank you for a great recipe!

I did not marinate first - time thing. Grilled on a cedar plank (10 minutes per inch is the "rule") and basted during grilling instead. Also, I used less sugar (@ 3 T.ish? I don't measure)  and a bit of natural honey. I will use all honey next time if I have some (about 3 T.) and eliminate the sugar altogether. Just a bit sweet the way I did it. Non salmon people may like this as the sweetness and grilling takes away some of the fishy taste.

simple and delicious! My grill is covered in snow and I didn't feel like cleaning the broiling pan when I was finished, so I actually poached it in the sauce and it was still delicious.  Can't wait until I'm brave enough to clean the snow off my deck to BBQ!

This recipe is so easy and delicious, it's become one of our favourite meals.  I usually skip the salt and the oil altogether and add a bit more water.  I find the soy sauce is plenty salty and I add a small drop of oil before grilling to prevent the salmon from sticking.

I like to keep all the ingredients on hand for unexpected guests because it's so easy and everyone loves it!  Nearly everyone I've made it for has asked for the recipe.

Too easy and delicious.  I bake it and marinate the salmon in the same dish I'm using it to bake.

Fantastic!  My girlfriend couldn't stop raving about this.  I've made this twice, and the second time it marinated overnight... I found the soy sauce taste just a little too overwhelming.  A 1 1/2 hr soaking time seemed perfect.  I wrapped them in a little foil tent, put a slice of lemon on top, and cooked them in the oven.  Perfection!!

I hate salmon. I thought I would give it one last try since my husband loves it and it is so good for you, Well now with this recipe, I LOVE IT! When I took my first bite I said out loud "I love this!" Thank you so much. I will be making every week.

I love this recipe. This is the only way I marinate my salmon. I bake it in little foil packets like some of the other reviewers suggest. And I usually reserve some so my BF can use it as a dip. He loves it. Delicious!

We absolutely love this salmon recipe!  I didn't really want to try it because I didn't think it would be as good as my old favorite, but I tried it because of the 5 star rating.  Hands down, this has my old favorite beat!

This is pretty much a fail safe recipe.  I have made this several times and just love it.  Everyone served had nothing but good things to say about the great flavor.  I actually make this quite a bit because it's such a hit.

Simple and Delicious. I was short on time so I sprinkled lemon juice (from 1/2 lemon) and the garlic powder over 4 thinner salmon fillets. Then I mixed the Soy, water, and Brown Sugar (my salmon was fatty so I skipped the oil). Marinated it for about 1/2 hour, placed on a baking dish (marinade and all) and baked at 475º for 12 minutes ('til it was flaky). This worked for me and it was tasty!

First of all: DELICIOUS!! I opted to bake my fillets in the tin foil pouches and allowed them to poach in their own juices. Once it was finished, I just couldn't bare to throw away the marinade - some might think this is weird - but I used it as a salad dressing! Just over some simple lettuce, it gave it an instant Japanese Steakhouse salad pizazz!

I never liked salmon until I tried this recipe.  Now we eat it often.  The flavors are a perfect blend and gives the salmon a slightly sweet taste. I find that the rich taste of sock-eye salmon is well suited to this marinade.  Also, salmon with the skin on it will have more flavor than skinned salmon.  Watch carefully as you grill.  Thinner fillets (like the tail end of the fillet) may not take a full 6 minutes per side.  You don't want the salmon to be dry from over-cooking.

I don't like salmon and I will now eat it due to this recipe. I made it exactly as described and I wouldn't  change anything.   My husband likes salmon and really liked this recipe as well.  I have been wanting to incorporate salmon into my diet but wasn't able to find a preparation I liked.  Problem now solved!

Awesome recipe. My wife loved it, and she is not a huge seafood fan. I followed the recipe exactly except I used 1 clove of crushed garlic instead of garlic powder, and I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. After marinating I covered in tin foil, and baked in the oven at 375 degrees for 25 min. I served it with Uncle Bens boxed wild rice, a green salad, and a bottle of Pinot Grigio wine. Nice romantic meal for about $30.00 dollars with enough left overs for a great lunch the next day. You could easily build off this recipe and make it your own by adding stuff to the marinade such as thai chile and garlic paste, or tequila and lime juice etc......This salmon recipe is definately worth a try. The best part is, it's also a relatively healthy dish that you feel great after eating, and not fat and sluggish.

I am not a big fan of salmon unless it is grilled because that seems to take away some of the fishiness flavor.  This recipe was outstanding.  I loved what I was eating instead of it being just okay as salmon usually is for me!

Extremely amazing recipe. I used Skinless, Boneless Atlantic Salmon as my husband is extremely picky and as soon as he took a bite, he had this huge smile on his face. He told me that it made the "recipe book? (where we keep tested recipes that we both love). A++ to whoever posted this recipe :)

This is loaded with flavor.  The only change I made was to use fresh lemon juice and black pepper instead of lemon pepper seasoning since I didnt have any. I will be making this again.

I had a 2-1/2 lb Norwegian farmed fillet which I cut in half and placed on the oiled gas grill. I tented the fish with foil after about 10 mins b/c the bottom (skin side) was cooking faster than the top. The coals ended up catching fire and singing the skin, so I placed the salmon under the broiler for a couple minutes to finish it. It came out very moist with a hint of the marinade (next time I will marinate it for 3 or 4 hours instead of 2.) This is the best salmon I have ever cooked or eaten.

My family *loves* this dish.  The first time I made it, I'd intended to grill the fish, but mother nature intervened (it rained) so I put the fillets in foil packets with a bit of the marinade spooned over each one and baked it at 375 for about 15 min.  It came out so well that they won't let me fire up the grill even when the sun is shining!   I've made it several times since and now simplify it by putting the lemon pepper, garlic powder and *no* salt (my husband has a heart condition) in the marinade which I make in a plastic bag.  Swish it around, add the fish and refrigerate until you're ready to bake.  Love it.

My husband and I catch fresh salmon on the Great Lakes and this recipe is the bomb!  We've tried others, but kept coming back to this one.  I use olive oil instead if vegetable oil. We won't change again.  It is as good as any retaurant salmon.

I tried this both ways at the same time.  Maria's rice cooks at same temp as the salmon In oven does so i grilled half & baked half.  You are absolutely missing out if you don't grill it!!!!!!

This was excellent. My husband is not a Salmon person, but I marinaded the Salmon for 3 hours and then grilled it. Both my husband and our grandson loved it. No more problems getting them to eat something that is good for them. I enjoyed it, too. Thank you for a great recipe.

I loved this!  Followed the advice of the top reviewer and cooked individually in foil packets. Be sure to pour a generous amount of the sauce over the fish before sealing the foil.  Served with brown rice and grilled asparagus.

Salmon is my favorite fish, and I order it frequently in restaurants.  I must say that this is the best salmon I've ever had!  Even my husband who is not a salmon fan loved it!  The only thing I added to the sauce was some pineapple juice, and I made extra to pour it over the fish. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a "t".  It was amazing.  I will definitely be making it again!  Thanks for sharing =)  UPDATE....made this again on the grill tonight...spring fever lol....still the best salmon ever!

Amazingly balanced and simple marinade.  I used lemon juice and ground pepper and brushed some back on while it was grilling.  The family said it was the best salmon they'd ever had.

This was restaurant quality taste! I'm not a big fish fan, but I loved this recipe. I did not add the additional salt and used low sodium soy sauce, and it still had enough salt. I baked it in the oven at 425 for about 15-20 minutes each wrapped in foil. I used some of the extra marinade and made a brown rice/ vegetable stir-fry as a side. It was great!

Wow and thanks. It was delicious. Make sure to lightly oil grill/grill pan. Move it a bit on the grill after a minute or two to prevent it from sticking to the grill since the sugar will carmalize. Used kroger brand frozen salmon fillets thawed. Putting skin side down first, cooked for five minutes each side, then let sit in serving dish for 5 mins skin side up to rest.  I substituted extra virgin olive oil for vegetable oil, added a dash of ground red pepper. I used my cast iron grill pan. Served with rice and green onion kimchee and the kids liked it as well. Son said it would be great for chicken also. Thanks for a quick easy recipe.

This is the all time best recipe for grilled salmon.  I had a group of friends over for a dinner party and they couldn't stop raving.  One of my guests told me after dinner that she didn't even like salmon and when I had told her it was the main dish she was disappointed until she tried it.  She had two servings.  The absolute best.  I made 8 pounds of salmon so instead of lemon pepper I used two freshly squeezed lemons and fresh ground pepper and olive oil instead of vegetable oil, but the rest of the recipe was absolutely perfect.

This salmon is so good, but if you marinade it too long the soy makes the fish a little slimy, in my opinion.  I followed another reviewer's advice and cook this on the grill or in the oven in a aluminum foil packet.

Easy & excellent!  My 4 yr. old loves it too.  I tend to like sauce so I take make the marinade enough for 6 servings (instead of 4) if I have a pound of salmon.  After I put the salmon in the oven, I take the leftover marinade and put it into a frying pan and let it simmer for the length of time the salmon is in the oven.  It slowly thickens & makes a super yummy sauce to top on the fish.

I did not wait two hours or do any prep....and I used the oven instead of the grill. I poured sauce into individual foil bowls with salmon fillets and put them in the oven at 350 for 15 minutes.   Served with rice and the sauce went well poured over it. This was delicious and I will definitely make it again.

This was excellent! I am not much of a fish eater but my husband is. I made this as a treat for him and we both really liked as well as our 2 boys. I followed the recipe exactly except I used one reviewer's suggestion to put each piece in foil individually wrapped for cooking and baked at 425 degrees for about 15 minutes. Easy and very good.

I MUST AGREE WITH THE MASSES - THIS WAS WONDERFUL.  ALTHOUGH, I WOULD SAY IT'S BEST TO USE A THINK CUT OF SALMON AND A LITTLE RED PEPPER FLAKE MIGHT GIVE IT A NICE ASIAN SPICY KICK - I HAVEN'T TRIED THAT YET, BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD.

This was the BEST salmon recipe ever. I baked it in the foil pouch as someone suggested and it was moist and tasty. I did omit the salt as soy sauce is salty enough for me. Both hubby and I enjoyed this dish and am looking forward to making it again and again. Thanks so much for sharing!

We normally arent real keen on Salmon but this was very good, I used Real Garlic in the marinade rather than the garlic powder (I usually only use garlic powder in dire situations because the real thing is just so much better.) and lemon juice and pepper instead of lemon pepper since I didn't have that on hand.    I baked this in the oven since it was like 5 below outside that day. (brrr, Minnesota!)  I took the advice of another user and wrapped my salmon in foil packets first then I baked it at 450 for 10 minutes and then opened them up and put them under the broiler for about 5 minutes.  I think I may be cooking salmon more often now that I know the right way to make it and I'm especially looking forward to trying this on the grill when the weather is a little more cooperative.  My whole family enjoyed this- even my 2 toddlers who are my biggest critics.  ;)

This was better than I expected.  I baked it at 425 for 15 minutes in a foil packet.  I wish I had a grill, I'm sure that's the best way for maximum flavor.  Next time I will take the foil off at 12 minutes and broil for 5 minutes like other reviewers suggested... or buy a grill and do it right!

So I am not what you call a fish person but since fish cooks quickly and is healthy I figured after years of not eating fish I would give it a try. This was delicous. As the other reviewers suggested I cooked it in a foil packet as per the fish guy at the supermarket I cooked my piece for 25 minutes at 350. Next time I make this I am going to put brown sugar on top of the fish a couple minutes before finish and switch it to broil I think. Oh and pour more of the marinade in the packet to pour on the fish when it is on the plate.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for and it was fantastic! I did bake it at 400 degrees and then broiled for 5 minutes. I will definitely make this again!

This is totally amazing! I HATED salmon...this recipe was my one last shot at trying something to like salmon. It worked...we now have salmon Sundays in our house. I pierce the filet with a fork all over and put the salmon in the marinade, usually for a few hours. Hubby grills it while I make a side dish of jasmine rice w/peas and carrots and a green salad w/ginger dressing. My 2 changes: omit lemon pepper and garlic powder. Instead add fresh lemon juice to taste and fresh garlic. FYI, the leftovers are delish the next morning on a bagel w/cream cheese. YUM!!!

By far the best Salmon recipe that I have ever made. Cooking it on the grill made it a little bit crispy & it was perfect!!! I can't wait to make this again & I am actually going to try to make the marinade for chicken too it is that good!

I loved this recipe.  I baked it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and used garlic pepper and 1/4 c. lemon juice.  Came out wonderfully.  Tender and delicious.

Exquisite. Perfect, juicy and tender. We cooked it right on our fire pit flesh down first. I put a touch less soy sauce but other than that followed recipe exactly. Thank you for bringing me such full flavor!!! A new favorite!

This is awesome! I change nothing, recipe stays as is.  My husband accidently blackened one side a little too much the first time he grilled (maybe because of the brown sugar?), and it was still amazing!  I don't think you can ruin this. Five stars all the way.

Not a recipe for those of us who like to actually TASTE the salmon.   Tasted like chicken.  If you like that, go for it.  For me, I'm sticking to lemon and a little bit of rosemary.  Done.

Very yummy and easy too.  Made the exact way the recipe called for but next time will cut back on the salt, don't feel you need both salt and soy sauce.

Amazingly delicious! I did however let the salmon sit with the lemon pepper and garlic powder, salt for an hour before putting it into the liquid mix. It's best grilled IMO

Yum Yum Yum!!!  I used foil packets and and baked in oven at 425 for 20 minutes.  Otherwise, I followed recipe exactly and it was delish!  Even my 5 year old and 2 year old ate it. It had a nice light and semi-sweet taste.  Thank you for the recipe I will use this many more times.

Fantastic marinade!!  My husband was not a salmon lover until tonight.  He said he was shocked at how delicious it was.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use olive oil.  I prepared it on our gas grill along with the Quick and Easy Grilled Potatoes from this web site, and a foil pack of onions and peppers.   I served the salmon with a creamy dill sauce which we didn't even need because the salmon had such a great flavor of its own from the marinade.  Can't wait to make it for guests.  They are sure to be impressed.

I added a touch of Sesame oil to the olive oil for a more Asian flavor and rice wine vinegar along with the lemon juice and zest, fresh ginger and crushed garlic.  I used Tamari instead of regular soy sauce, less sodium, more flavor.  I brought the remaining to a boil, reduced the marinade and used it as a glaze over the finished fillet.  Very good but after 7 minutes it was done through; seared, with a nice bark on one side and done through.  Next time I'll watch it more carefully.  This is almost the same marinade I regularly use for flank steak, minus the brown sugar.  I loved it.

My husband caught a king salmon this morning and I marinated the fillets for about 5 hours then grilled it for about 12 minutes, it was awesome! I did use fresh lemon and a little fresh minced ginger in the marinade. My in-laws don't like fish but liked this recipe a lot!

I substituted honey for brown sugar and used lemon juice rather than lemon pepper.  I poached in the foil packets (it was too hot outside to fire up the grill.)  My hubby thought this was the best marinade EVER!

4.5 Good flavor and very easy to prepare.  Marinated the salmon for about 2 1/2 hours before hubby put them on the grill.  Next time, I will add more seasoning to the fish as they are grilling as I think it needed just a touch more.  Served with Garlic Rice and asparagus.

I was looking for a quick and easy way to make some salmon and found this recipe.  Due to lack of time and lack of ingredients, I ended up having to eliminate the soy sauce (and am SO glad I did!!). I put the salmon in a baking pan, poured the marinade over it and broiled it for approximately 10 minutes.  Came out perfect!  Will definitely make again!

I loved this dish. If you are watching your salt intake, there's no need to add salt. Soy sauce has enough salt in it already.

Awesome....my husband said he felt like he was eating in a 5 star restaurant!  I did use 1/2 the oil and 1/2 the soy sauce.  There was plenty.  I also reduced the extra marinade in a small pan to use as a sauce.

Great dish! Followed Elizabeth's suggestion. Baked in a foil packet for 17 minutes at 425 oven. Then opened the packet and broiled for 5 minutes. I also put the remaining marinade in a saucepan and reduced while the salmon was in the oven. Drizzled some sauce on the fish before it went under the broiler and then again before serving.Very flavorful! Served with roasted potatoes and burnt broccoli! Great dinner

Needs to marinate longer. I have cooked salmon before with a similar recipe and it comes out much better if you marinate for at least 4-6 hours, however, I usually try and marinate it over night. Also, be careful about cooking the salmon with much of the juices of the marinade because the brown sugar can cause it to burn. I've given it five stars because it is a great base recipe, but I highly recommend adding about a 1/4 cup of bourbon and some cut up green onions. Superb!!

YUM! Love this recipe it makes the salmon absolutely delectable. The hubby even likes it and he usually hates seafood. (I cooked mine in the foil packets in the oven with the marinade on top, as I usually dont have time to marinade before hand)

My salmon fillets were very delicate so I wrapped them in foil packets and put them on the grill.  Very tasty but next time I am going to try them straight on the grill.  Thanks!

Excellent!  Husband cooked this on our gas grill and it couldn't have been easier.  I made the marinade early in the day and let the salmon marinate for about 5 hours.  This is by far the best salmon I have ever eaten.  Picky husband agrees. Will be making this again. Thanks!

Overall, the taste was wonderful, but this recipe could do without the oil! Don't add any oil! Salmon is oily enough without it!!!!

I marinated the salmon for a day in the fridge. It's an okay recipe. I much prefer other salmon recipes - I feel that the soysauce and sugar took away the natural flavor of the salmon. I wouldn't make this recipe again.

I let it marinate overnight. Then at the suggestion of another reviewer I first grilled flesh side down for 7 minutes, turned and finished grilling skin side down for 7 minutes. It was fantastic.

I don't like fish so i made this for my boyfriend who loves salmon.  I will admit it smelled very good and I was very tempted to take a bite.  My boyfriend was amazed on how good this was and he even asked that I make it again!

Made this tonite for dinner, husband and I loved it! Made a few changes:  I did use a 2.5 lb. of fish but kept the same amount of ingredients. Omitted the salt, didn't need it with soy sauce, no lemon pepper, just 2 squeezes of fresh lemon juice and next time I will try fresh garlic. Also used my skillet/grill on the stovetop and the carmelization was so tasty. Will definitely make regularly.

Delicious marinade for the Salmon. I omitted the water and added the juice of half a lemon.

The cover was frozen onto the grill so I broiled the salmon and it was fantastic.

This is a very good recipe. I made it exactly as listed. Next time, I would cut back to about half the amount of oil suggested. The flavor was good, cooking time was accurate. Nice way to have salmon. Will make it again, for sure.

We loved the salmon prepared this way! It was very moist and not 'fishy' It was not oily or overly sweet either.  Used the ingredients exactly the same in recipe except I used reduced salt soy.  I left fish in the marinade approximately 1/2 hr, instead of two, since I don't plan ahead, (obviously), and baked in oven for 12 minutes and broiled for 5 minutes as suggested.  Came out perfectly.  Made Jasmine rice and used some 'sauce' on top of it.  Will make this recipe routinely and plan to make it for my 'company' meal next week.  Thanks all.

This salmon is flavorful and never dry (even when I overcook it!)  I live in a small apartment so I usually cook it in the oven and it still comes out tasting wonderful!

Super recipe! I am not a fish eater myself but wanted to try something new on the grill with friends who come over too frequently to keep serving our standards and now we have a new regular dish!
Everyone LOVED this recipe. My husband who is not a big fan of the fishyness of salmon made it again the next night and yet again the following weekend.
Nothing to change with this recipe. It is perfect as is.

This was just wonderful!  I didn't change a thing.  I removed the skin before it was marinated.  My husband just came back from Alaska salmon fishing.  I had no idea what I was going to do with 80 lb of salmon!  I know now!  Thanks for a terrific recipe.

I let the salmon marinate for 3 hours. I thought it turned out really well and had lots of flavor. My husband didn't finish his because he said it had almost TOO much flavor and kind of cancelled out the fish taste. I'll make it again :)

My husband, who previously said he only likes "lemon pepper salmon", LOVED this!  I did too- I love the sweet mixed with salty, and the flavor is just perfect.  I have not enjoyed salmon this much in a long time.  The only thing I did differently is bake the fillets in foil packets, as I'm not good with a grill.  Wonderful recipe!

Really, really tasty.  I used fresh lemon juice and black pepper and accidentally added too much oil and it still came out fantastic!  Kids gobbled it up, and they aren't crazy about salmon.  This one has been added to my recipe box.

Love this recipe but I do make a few changes. I use a little less water than suggested. I bake it at 425 degrees for 15 min in individual foil packets placed on a cookie sheet.

This was a very easy marinade.  I tasted it before pouring on salmon and thought it would be too strong. But once I grilled it it turned out delicious. Will definitely use again rather than my usual bottled marinade. Thanks!!

This was very good!  I just eye-balled the ingredients, and it was fantastic.  I didn't grill it, though, I baked it at 450 degrees for about 16 minutes.  I didn't even flip the fillets over, and they turned out wonderful.  The flavor is perfect, and I can't wait to try it on chicken!  Thanks for the post!

This was so good and different than the classic salmon filet.. My dad caught the salmon and didnt want to eat it beacuse he has never been a fan of fish, I made him try it and he loved it. I made it on the GEORGE..seven mins it was simple and  perfect! MUST TRY!

This was a really easy recipe and we enjoyed it a lot.  I made it on our indoor grill and it worked great.  I did have lemon pepper seasoning salt so I just cut out the regular salt.

OK - for starters let me say that, before this recipe, I was really not a fan of salmon.  In my efforts to eat healthier I decided to try it again.  Much to my delight, it was spectacular.  This is a great recipe, thanks!

This was WONDERFUL! I followed the recipe exactly. I skinned the filet and started top side down on the grill, then turned it for another 7-8 minutes(filet size dependent)until finished. My husband is not a fish eater and loved it. I only had the 2 hours to marinate but have to believe longer would only be even better. I will try this on a cedar plank next time for kicks. Thanks!!

The absolute best!  I did not add or change a thing!  The lemon pepper is a must have, I feel, for Salmon.  Everything else just accentuated the taste of the Salmon, while adding a sweet flavor.

Even my crumudgen husband who always comments how this could be better or that could be better and who only likes salmon cooked the way he does it loved this.  And my son couldn't stop eating it!  Super easy too.  And it's a superfood.  We'll be having this once a week if I can afford to buy salmon.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would.  I made the marinade early in the day and let it set all day before grilling.  We reserved the marinade to baste while grilling on a ceramic coated grill tray.  This was so flavorful and flakey tender!  I can't wait to make it again.

Loved this!  It is so simple, but the marinade flavor and the wonderful grill taste of the salmon make it restaurant-quality cooking.  I was pleased that the recipe is cost effective, fast, and nearly impossible to mess up.  I didn't (and wouldn't) alter a single thing :)

This is THE BEST salmon I've ever tasted, I couldn't believe that I made it!  I followed the recipe exactly as directed, and it was absolutely perfect.  Thank you so much for this recipe, I will never again make salmon any other way.

Very good...the brown sugar gives it a nice caramelized crust on the grill. I didn't have time to really let it marinate long, just 30 minutes at room temperature, so I wasn't expecting much...but I was really surprised just how much flavor it had.  We will definitely use this recipe again.

I followed Elizabeth's advice and used a tin foil packet ... The salmon was done perfectly! I also used fresh squeezed lemon juice, instead of lemon pepper, and fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. Thanks!

Really good - I cooked at 450 for 13 minutes, and forgot to broil it, but it was delicious.  Moist, perfectly cooked, the salmon had a hint of sweetness from the sugar, but it wasn't overwhelming.  Super easy!

The smell was divine when baking.  Used oven at 400 degrees and since it was a thick fillet, went 25 minutes.  Used the leftovers to make Salmon Dip and the hint of soy and ginger made it phenomenal!
Kids even liked this one!
Thanks

I don't eat seafood, but my husband loves it. He bought a nice piece of salmon and asked me to marinade it for him. I used this recipe and realized I was out of brown sugar so I used maple syrup instead. After marinading, he grilled it and gave it a 5 star. He swore it was the best salmon he had ever tasted! Thanks for the recipe!

We tried this recipe due to the overwhelming good reviews on this site. Unsurprisingly, we were not disappointed. 

The one thing I liked best about this recipe is that it uses simple ingredients found in any household, yet it tastes anything but ordinary.

We didn't have a grill, so we used a cast iron grill slab that fit right over our cast iron stove top. This cooking method turned out great. The only vice was a little bit of the brown sugar sticking to the grill plate. However, this was mostly due to me having the heat on too high initially, and the fact that this recipe really calls for a grill.

Overall, I would recommend this to anyone, due to the great flavor and simple ingredients. I'll make this again.

This is the best. I've made it several times and my husband and I just love it. The first time I made it I wasn't so sure how well the soy sauce and brown sugar would taste with salmon, but I am so glad I tried it. It's a keeper for sure, and we'll be making this often. Thanks for sharing!!!

The reviews are true - this is a sensational marinade for salmon!!  I only marinated it for about an hour and it was still delicious (and I'm sure it would be even better if I had marinated it longer).  Most marinades don't seem to hold their flavor, but this really carmelized on the salmon.  I will use this  whenever I cook salmon on the grill!

Delish!  Instead of grilling, I seered in a very hot skillet, in olive oil, for 2 minutes.  Then put the pan in a 450 degree oven for 8 minutes.  Yum!  I will be using this recipe often.

This was terrific.  I marinated the salmon and then put the fish - marinade and all - into my calphalon grill pan on top of the stove.  Cooking it like this, the marinade actually caramelized on the fish.  My 11 yo asked for seconds! Now THAT is success! ;o)

I am not much of a fish eater but this was great! I cooked in the foil packet, used real lemon and fresh ground pepper, and serve it with lemon wedges, steamed veggies and rice. We will be having this often. Thanks for the recipe!

If I use the foil method, should I still let it marinate for 2 hrs or can the sauce cook inside with the fish?

Wow!  I didn't grill the salmon as the original recipe said, but picked up a few of the other people's suggestions.  I replaced lemon pepper with lemon juice and fresh ground pepper, much to my pleasure.  I also tried the little foil packets at 425 for 15 and it was just heaven.  Moist, tasty, tender, delicious!  My husband went back for thirds and fourths!  I've made it twice this week already and munch on what little leftovers there are the rest of the night.  I am usually uncomfortable cooking seafood, but this was simple, easy, and just fantastic!

This recipe is great! The best salmon I every cooked.  I used the Showtime Rotisserie, cooked it for twelve minutes  and sqeezed on a little lemmon juice before serving.  My nine year old daughter loved it. Finally made salmon the way I liked it.

Served it with Oven Brown Rice from this site, and oven roasted asparagus and the family loved it. I have never been fond of salmon, but I agree that this recipe is a keeper.  

Thanks so much for sharing.

This a great recipe, I have made this many times and everybody I serve it to just loves it. I revise by using juice from 1/2 lemon, 1 clove of chopped garlic as well as fresh rosemary and dill to the marinade.

**UPDATE--Made again. Didnt have any brown sugar, only Splenda, but I made this again anyway. Still just as good!!**-- I am giving this recipe 5 stars because it is super easy to make and with ingredients you already have in the house. I dont like my fish, or any meat for that matter, sweet but this was great.  It wasnt too sweet.  It took me minutes to put together and it was fantastic!  I didnt grill it, i made it on the stove and reduced the marinade after and poured it over the salmon when it was done.  It was yummy!  The only thing id change is use way way less oil, its really not needed.  Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe :)

Tried this reciped exactly as stated.  Simply wonderful!  The salmon was moist and extremely delicious.  My wife re-heated and ate more the next day, which has NEVER happened before with any fish.  A definite keeper!

No lemon pepper; used lemon juice. My husband--not a fish lover--thought this was great. I appreicated it using soy sauce but not tasting Asian--nice to see ingredients stretching themselves!

Let the marinade work for at least 4 hours.  I've tried it at 2 hours and 4 hours and the fish had much more flavor at 4!

My hubby said this is probably the best salmon he has ever eaten!  It took all of about 1 minute to mix the ingredients, place it all in a bag and marinate.  THis is PERFECT!!  I think I have found my next meal for company!  Oh, and I made exactly as written.  Wouldn't change a thing!  Thank you :-)

I didn't have lemon pepper, so I brushed the filets with about 1/3 cup of lemon juice prior to seasoning with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.  I marninated the filets in a baking dish, and only ended up using half of the marinade.  I'll be saving the rest for another day!

I live in an apartment and can't grill so I baked it in the oven at 450 for 20 min. I would suggest if you do this to either get rid of excess juices on your pan before you bake or watch it very carefully as the brown sugar and soy sauce burn quickly on the pan and affect the edges of the salmon.  Other than that it was fantastic and I will make this again and again.

This was not what I expected, based on all the rave reviews, which usually I agree with on most recipes. I followed direction to a tee, even the sugar which I was not sure of because sweet fish is not my cup of tea, even the oil seemed way to much, but still I followed directions to a tee, and yes thats hard for me beacuse I like adding my own touches. I let it sit overnight and grilled the following eve. I wish I could have tatsted the sugar, soy or something, I hate to be so harsh but I feel I wasted my salmon on this recipe, this was truly tasteless to me. Thanks anyway

Replaced brown sugar with Splenda + tbs of SF maple syrup.  We only marinated the salmon for maybe 1/2 hour, but kept putting the marinade on the salmon as it was cooking.  IT WAS AMAZING!!! WE'RE GRILLING SALMON THIS WAY EVERY TIME!!!

Simple and terrific! I think it was just a bit too sweet, though. Next time I will cut the sugar down to 1/4c. or less.  I reduced the oil and used olive instead of vegetable and it turned out great. Also, adding fresh squeezed lemon was the perfect touch after cooking. I baked at 450 for 10 min (covered with foil) then broiled for 7 for a slight crisp. Turned out perfectly cooked, but I'm sure grilling would be best. Thanks for the recipe.

okay, so I was afraid to use soy sauce, because I'm not a fan, but neither me or my hubby like salmon that much either, so I was going out on a limb to try this recipe anyway...It is FANTabulous!!!  I marinaded the salmon overnight with the skin side up as recommended by other "enjoyers" of this recipe.  It worked out perfectly!  I'm a full time student and get home pretty late in the evening and this was so quick and easy.  I served it with garlic rice and Parmesan Crusted Asparagus- delicious!!  Good job and thanks so much, will be aking this again for sure!

I make this recipe often, its very simple and very good after it sits ALL day. I think that is a must for this one.  I use a shallow baking dish instead of the plastic bag, scale side up. I will make this for a very lonnnnng time! Love it!!

I made this on salmon and it was incredible.  I marinated for about 5 hours.

I also used this marinade for a pork loin. 

I seasoned the pork the same way it calls to do the salmon.  Then I marinated the pork in a plastic bag for 24 hours.  After taking the pork out of the bag I boiled the marinade. I then grilled the pork loins on medium heat for 30 minutes. (I have a gas grill.)  I basted every five minutes.  I turned the pork loins half way through.  The last few minutes I turned the grill up to high to char the outside.  I messed up and let the temp get to 160 on an instant thermometer, although it was moist I will pull it from the grill at about 22 minutes or 150 degrees next time as I like my pork a little less done than the standard 160. 

The pork turned out as good as the salmon!  Moist and delicious.  This goes PERFECT with pork loin!

You can't say anything bad about this recipe. It is perfect the way it is. I made this with asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes for my mom's birthday and she absolutely loved it!

We couldn't taste any of the flavors from the marinade & I marinaded it for over 4 hours. Sorry but we just didn't like this one.

There is hope for Salmon after all.  I have tried several other ways to make it and have never been impressed.  Now, thanks to you, I can add another "healthier, yet tasty" recipe to my list.

This was ok, but not one of our favorites.  The fishy taste was still pretty strong and we had a lot of leftovers that we ended up using in other recipes that thankfully muted it quite a bit.  I give it four stars just because 3 seems too little since we don't particularly like salmon.  Someone who likes it would probably rate it 4 or 5.

I didn't ooh and ahhh when it hit my mouth, but I definitely felt healthy and satisfied after this meal. I paired it with the "japanese zucchini and onions" recipe from this site. they were nice together. i will make this again, maybe i will let it marinate over night though. i cooked it in the oven also, and it cooked perfectly! thanks!!!

Made this for a dinner party and WOW!!  Best salmon I've ever had; husband says the same thing.  Threw it on the grill on a cedar plank after marinating for an afternoon.  This is a keeper!

I served this on a bed of rice with the 'Baked Asparagus with Balsamic Butter Sauce' from this site as a side, which turned out to be a mistake. The asparagus stole the show! This salmon was good, but I think I like plain salmon a little better. I baked this in foil so it turned out nice and moist and flaky, but I wasn't crazy about the flavor. Not bad, but not that great.

I'm made this numerous times with the beautiful Salmon fillets you can buy from Costco with no skin or bones. I marinate it overnight in a Large Glad freezer bag and BBQ it the next day.

Everyone asks for the recipe...even the non fish eaters. This is extremely simple to make and you will not be dissappointed. 5 stars +

This was my first time making grilled salmon. I knew this website would not let me down. This recipe was excellent. The brown sugar gave just a hint of sweetness and grilling the salmon after marinating gave the salmon kind of a glaze. I was really impressed with this recipe and will be making it again.

NO DOUBT THE BEST RECIPE FOR SALMON. My parents who are not into salmon though this was so good. I made it for my dads birthday on the 11th and they made it for dinner them selfs the next day. Yummy.

I am on a roll!  My in-laws think I am a great cook and it is all thanks to Allrecipes :o)  I only had time to marinate for 1 hour and had to substitute olive oil for the veggie oil.  I also used splenda brown sugar instead of regular.  It was delicious and between 3 adults and 2 kids we finished off 2 lbs of salmon.  I also fixed the Quick Sesame Green Beans from this site and a quick box of sesame rice.  Great and easy meal!

Very good, very easy to do. A little on the sweet side but a nice change of pace from the usual. Sugar gave it a nice "grilled" finish when pan-fried.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was great! I marinated it for about 8-9 hours and the flavor was just right! Boyfriend gave it a 10!! Made with orzo pasta (2 cups), mixed with chopped red and orange peppers (1/2 of each pepper), fresh garlic(1 clove), and some olive oil (1-2 tbsp). AMAZING compliment to the salmon! Will make this recipe over and over!!

I had pretty high expectations for this recipe...Maybe they were too high. It was good, but it didn't blow me away. Next time I think I'll add more sugar, marinade it longer, and cook it crispier. I will try it again though.

I don't have a grill, but this is great baked too! My husband and I love this recipe and have enjoyed it for quite some time.  My 2 1/2 year old loves it too.  He doesn't even mind eating Nemo! Thanks for a crowd pleasing recipe!

I dont know- I don't get what everyone likes so much. I thought it was just average with not a ton of flavor. Luckily, I love salmon so any kind tastes great to me. I did cut the oil to about 1T. Doubt I will make again. Thanks.

I marinaded these for a couple of hours & boy, were they packed w/ flavor! I don't care for salmon much because of the fishy taste & the marinade masked it very well...even I loved them. I was out of lemon pepper so I squeezed a bit of lemon juice on the filets & added some ground pepper. I did not add any salt because soy sauce is usually so salty. I cooked these inside on a grill pan & served them atop brown rice (cooked in chicken broth w/ sliced green onions), w/ steamed broccoli & cukes & onions marinaded in italian dressing (w/ a couple of squeezes of lemon juice)on the side. Will have this healthy dish many times!

I didn't follow this recipe exactly, but it still came out wonderful! I had no time to marinade the salmon so I placed it in a small cooking dish with all the ingredients; the fish was about halfway covered with the liquid. It is freezing outside so the grill was out of the question but the oven worked just fine, cooked it for about 20mins and it was SO DELICIOUS!! I am not a huge fan of salmon, but the flavor of this dish was great, I will recommend to everyone! Thanks!

We've made salmon a gazillion different ways and this was by far the best tasting for the least amount of hassle.  It works well to grill it skin side down against the shiny side of the foil.  Then when it is done cooking, the skin sticks to the foil and you are left with perfect tasting salmon!  I'd compare it to a cedar planked salmon.

My 2 kids enjoyed it yesterday.  Next time I will put them in a foil first with a slice of lime(lemon) and little of olive old on medium heat. Then after cooking it, I will remove the foil and grill it a little more for grill marks.

Wow!  This was fabulous.  My husband and I usually don't like Salmon, but I decided to give this a try.  I'm so glad I did!  I left out the lemon pepper (personal preference) and used a little less oil, but kept everything else the same.  The flavor was wonderful!  I think some extra marination time would be even better.  I broiled it in the toaster oven and poured the extra marinade on top while it was cooking.  Yum!

So good!!! yum!!! 
I recommend that if the lemon pepper has salt, you should omit extra salt. also use light soy sauce (its less salty) and olive oil instead of vegetable oil, it made the fillets very moist and tender. 
To grill, cook each side for 7 minutes if the coals are hot. i loved this recipe. great family meal, and even picky children enjoy it. best salmon I’ve had yet. it goes excellent with organic Trader Joes jasmine rice.

I love salmon, and this marinade was the best I have ever tasted! I marinaded the salmon for about 5 hours and then grilled it on my George Foreman grill.  Absolutely delicious.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Delicious.  I ended up marinating the salmon overnight, then placed salmon along with all the marinade onto foil, to which I added some frozen broccoli and carrots and sealed it all up into a packet.  I then baked it at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes; the salmon was not quite done, so I opened the packet and let it bake another 15 minutes or so.  Came out great served over rice.  Nice flavor that doesn't overpower the salmon.

This is good! When I first read the recipe I thought "Who would want their salmon to taste like sot sauce and brown sugar?" It is one I will do again and for company.

I really loved this. It was perfect. I would, however, like a sauce similar to the marinade to dip the finished salmon into. My house actually smelled less fishey and more sweet like the sugar - nice change!

This marinade was GREAT!!!! I added a few drops of liquid smoke as suggested by another reviewer and smashed a clove of garlic and added to the bag. I will never buy bottled marinade for my salmon again. Thanks Tina.

I hesitated to write a review because I would be repeating the same theme, but I felt I had to add my two cents...this recipe is fantastic!!!  I like salmon anyway, but it does have a bland taste.  This recipe made the fish soooo flavorful.  It was very easy.  I marinated overnight and added 2 tsp of liquid smoke to the marinade.  I baked it in the oven..20 min covered then 20 min uncovered at ~ 400 degrees.  My husband enjoyed it as well.  Thank you so much Tina !!!

Prepared this with frozen individual portion salmon from Sam's.  We were too hungry to wait so only marinated for about an hour but still enjoyed the subtle flavor.  We grilled on a cedar plank and reduced the leftover marinade which produced a delicious sauce.  Used orange juice in place of water.  Can't wait to try after marinating overnight as others have suggested.

WOW!  I don't even like salmon (seriously), and I thought this was good.  I bought a fresh salmon filet for some out-of-town guests, and thought I'd try this because of all the rave reviews.  I didn't use much garlic or lemon pepper, but I think it would be safe to use a bunch.  The main flavor comes from the soy sauce and brown sugar.  I only had about an hour to marinate and it still came out unbelievable.  Different, but so simple, everyone REALLY loved it.  No need to change a thing.

Oh my GOSH! I've never eaten salmon in my life and my fiancee insisted I make it (healthy stuff, you know...). This was incredible! I  LOVED the seasoning! Will definitely make again; plus, my boyfriend was talking about how good it was HOURS after dinner was finished!

I've never reviewed here before but had to for this recipe. I'm not a big fish lover - unless it's fish sticks or deep fried cod. But this recipe was fantastic! Even my 3, 6, and 7 year old kids loved it - and they're not big on fish either.

I didn't marinate it 2 hours. I used 2 of the individually wrapped salmon packets from Costco, put the fish in my frying pan, and salted and peppered it. Then I mixed the other ingredients together and drizzled on top. Also blended a little onion and garlic in my food processor and added to the mix - substituted Mrs. Dash for the lemon pepper and omitted the oil also.

I cooked it on med. high for about 15 minutes, then flaked the fish apart, and mixed the flakes with the sauce, I simmered for another 5 min. and served over brown rice with asaparagus.

Thanks for the great recipe!!

Yet another recipe from this site tht I crave!  Made this exactly as written (well OK, I used lemon juice and ground pepper separately) on the Foreman grill.  YUMMY!  I diod as others had suggested and saved the leftover marinade for extra cooking and thickening and drizzled the "sauce" over fresh spinich to wilt it and served salmon on top.  TO DIE FOR!  Then I decided to experiment by tweaking the recipe slightly.  I took out the pepper, left in everything else and added minced fresh ginger. I then sliced up some bok choy and sauteed it a bit to just get it slightly softened.  Again I took the "sauce" and drizzled it over and the salmon on top.  YUM YUM YUM!!!  Both ways are a big hit in this family - even the cat comes around to get some.  LOL THANKS, TINA.

Just made it last night... came out great.  
I baked it at 450 for 12 minutes and then broiled it for an extra few minutes. 
I didn't discard the marinade, but heated it up with corn starch and drizzled over some arugla... then served the salmon on top of the argula!  came out great.. thanks!

I had salmon steaks & the recipe worked out beautifully. In the marinade is used the juice of a lemon because I didn't have any lemon pepper. Also, after grilling the fish I placed it in a baking dish with the marinade & baked it for another 10 minutes at 400 degrees. I served the steaks on a bed of mixed greens and drizzled a bit of the marinade on top. My husband rated it a 10 out of 10.

This is an amazing recipe that is so quick and easy!  I use a little less of the vegetable oil and add some sesame oil to add some flavor.  I am not good with the grill so I cook mine on the stove in a skillet until the sauce carmelizes, and then put the fish on top of a bed of rice, pour the extra sauce over it and garnish it with scallions and sesame seeds.  My husband and I both adore this dish!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is definitely different than your typical lemon/dill salmon.  This is great served over a bed of steamed jasmine rice.

I've made this salmon twice and both times people were literally fighting over the last piece!  Since I don't own a grill, I broiled the salmon for 8-10 minutes.  Also, I reduced the marinade and added butter until it was thick enough to drizzle over the finished fish.  This food barely hits the plate before it disappears!  Great recipe!

This is a really great change from my usual white wine/lemon/oil/dill marinade. I don't mind the fishy smell of salmon, but for those picky eaters in my acquaintance, this marinade definitely pleases their finicky palates. This marinade has become a treasured part of my recipe box :-P

This was EXCELLENT!!!!  My husband and I have always hated salmon and wanted to start eating a little healthier.  Now we literally eat this once a week.  I completely left out the oil and sometimes I will add some fresh garlic, but all in all, it's a delicious dish!!!  Thanks for posting!

This is an amazing and yet simple recipe! I used fresh lemon juice and fresh ground pepper instead of lemon pepper.  Worked great!  I also marinated some different veggies in the same type of marinade-made for a great sidedish!!

07/20/03 - 4 stars - In spite of marinating for 6 hours, DH (who dislikes salmon very, very much!) could only tolerate it accompanied by much wine!  I (who loves salmon every which way), on the other hand, thought the marinade made the salmon taste very mild.  I will try this again, probably marinating it for 24 hours...and serving it with 2 bottles of wine!

08/01/03 - 5 stars! - Yes, I made this again but substituted white wine for the water and marinated it over 24 hours.  It was so delicious!  I didn't think it tasted like salmon and my DH thought it was much better, although he said it still smelled like salmon!  I cooked his salmon very rare and he liked it more that way.  This is a keeper and will be made many times--so easy for company, too!

This marinade was VERY EASY TO MAKE.  I was short on time so I actually only marinated the salmon about half an hour; however, it was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  I will definitely make again.

Really eliminated any "fishy" taste to the salmon...I cooked a great dinner for myself by marinating 1 salmon fillet in the marinade for two hours and then popping it on the Foreman grill!

This recipe was a lifesaver,for my first time preparing salmon, the first recipe almost failed, so luckily I turned to this one.  My husband ranted and raved about this, saying it was the best dinner I had ever made. He totally loved it.  Even my 4 year old liked it.  My husband said to make sure I keep this recipe.  If you dont particulary like fish, like myself, you proabably would not like this.  Thanks!

This is an awesome marinade for salmon.  My nephew loves it and calls up saying it time for more salmon and he asks if I will cook it for him.  I grilled along with some hickory chips and it was to die for.

Excellent! My father said, and I quote, "This is the best FOOD I've ever tasted!" I made the recipe EXACTLY as recommended, and its wonderful! The brown sugar makes all the difference. The marinade caramelizes on the grill, and it's delicious. Thank you!

This is great! I marinated for 4 hours, then baked it as my broiler is unpredictable. The marinade was subtle, but good. Next time I think I'll add garlic as someone else suggested, and a pinch more of all the other ingredients to give it more oomph. Delicious and low-fat.

Nice, easy recipe with good flavor.  I used the broiler instead of grill and I would recommend keeping a close eye on the salmon as the sugar in the marinade makes it easy to burn.

Great taste.  This was the first time I ever tried to grill any kind of fish on my BBQ...and it stuck to the grate.  I turned it over and took it off the grill to finish for 1 minute in the microwave to avoid losing the other half of my fish.  I only wish that I would have saved the marinade to cook down so that I could have poured it over my fish when it was done (since a lot of the "flavor" part stuck to the grill).  I'll try it again...maybe with one of things to hold the fish on the grill without it actually touching the grate.  Thanks for sharing.

I had never tried grilled salmon before this recipe, and I m glad that I picked this one!  The salmon is wonderful, it has a slightly sweet taste.  Since the first day I made it, people have been asking for the recipe.  This is a keeper!

First time grilling a salmon filet right on the grate and it turned out perfect!  FYI, to make sure the grate was well oiled: heat the grill first; thoroughly oil a paper towel with some vegetable oil; use tongs to hold the paper towel and apply oil to heated grate.  This worked VERY well!

This is FABULOUS!!!!!  I used a 3lb whole piece of salmon, and I should have got another!!!!I did 1 1/2 the marinade b/c of the size of my salmon.  Only thing I added was 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic, and some grated fresh gingeroot and I used low sodium soy sauce!!!!!!  Thank you TINA!!!!!!!  This is a KEEPER!!!!!!

I have just mastered boiling water, so I was nervous when attempting this recipe for a recent picnic. It was easy, quick, non-messy and my guests loved it, exclaiming that it was, "restaurant quality"!

I followed the recipe but used less of all ingredients. I had some lime juice, paprika and some teriyaki sauce just because. It caramelized great on the grill. This was my very first time grilling salmon so I’m very impressed. Next time I’ll plate it with sweet potatoes and broccoli.

I'm not a fish eater but I make it for my wife and I always try it.  I made this and ate my whole portion.  It was excellent.  The only thing I did differently is I grilled it skin side down only until the internal temp. reached 135 degrees.  Oh and I marinated it a whole day.  That marinade is awesome.

I did not make any changes, it was great cooked in the oven on broil. I did make a lemon sauce to go with the salmon, and I threw some asparagus in with the salmon when I broiled it. Cooked some rice to go with the meal - it was yummy.

I didn't change anything in the ingredients, but I did marinate it in fridge an extra two hours. Me and my husband loved it! We had Roasted Red Pepper Quinoa for the side dish and not only delicious together, but it was beautiful!

I can’t believe I have not rated or reviewed this before. This is the best marinade I have found, and I have quite a few. Please follow the directions, you will not be disappointed. I just made this for a large family event, expected to have leftovers - not a bit was left. Even the very picky eaters loved it.

Absolutely amazing flavor!!  I couldn’t grill due to the weather so I baked it at 425 for about 15 minutes & finished it off under the broiler for 5 min because I like my edges a little crisp.  Excellent!  My 10 yr old granddaughter ate as much as I did.

Good, I didn't have any lemon pepper. The salmon was pretty thin and I grilled it on the Foreman Grill for 6 minutes.

Put ingredients into ninja - including lots of lemon pepper poured out of grinder. I put a good 1 1/2 t garlic powder and add ginger from the tube. Marinate all day and drain marinade to a pan and boil with green onion for a minute or two and add fillets, cook, flip and cook and top with more green onion. Recipe is versatile and can grill, bake, broil or sauté. All delicious!!

This is a great recipe! But, don't be fooled by the 2.5 hour time required. I marinated for 30 minutes while I prepped and cook other items on the grill, then cooked the salmon. It came out fantastic. (Note: I used on of those copper sheets "as seen on TV" that I saw at Walmart for $10. Cooked the Salmon on the Grill but on one of the sheets. They still make grill marks and made for easy flipping.

This marinade was INCREDIBLE. I almost just stuck with lemon juice and butter like I normally do as I was a bit skeptical about the flavor combos in this. But after making it once, I don't think I'll ever make salmon any other way, it's that good. Seriously. Make it, you won't regret it.

This is another great salmon recipe on this site. My family loves it. I have made few times following the recipe exactly, including cooking the fish on the grill. But if weather not permitting, I have made by marinating the fish in a casserole dish and baking it, in the same pan, at 400 ° F, for 15 to 20 minutes, depending on how thick the piece of Salmon is. Both ways, the salmon comes out delicious but you can't beat the smoky flavor the grill adds to it !

I've tried to make Salmon several times and it just wasn't restaurant quality.   This was as close as I am going to come to perfect restaurant Salmon!  I did follow some of the other reviews and baked it in the oven in a "tent" for 10-13

I made no changes to recipe. Will make again, this was our 2nd time of making. It is good for only marinating for about 30 minutes. I'm sure it is much better if marinated for the full 2 hours it calls for. :)

This is a terrific basic recipe.  I've made it my "go to" recipe for summertime salmon, sometimes I add some dried herbs to the marinade like basil or some dried ginger if I have fresh ginger I just chop a piece of it and add it to the marinade baggie.  If I use ginger I use OJ instead of water.
I always grill it on a hinged griller that sandwiches the salmon before placing it on my BBQ, liberally sprayed with Pam. I leave the skin on too, but that's a matter of preference, we like it because it keeps the fish moist.
I only marinade the fish for an hour, because I like to taste the fish and not just the marinade.

We were so impressed with this recipe. My husband didn't think he liked salmon but his opinion has changed. The only thing I did was omit the lemon pepper (we don't like lemon) and left the garlic powder out. I would suggest this to anyone. Thanks for the other reviews that influenced me when looking for a recipe.

Five stars, plain and simple.  We used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and I didn't have lemon pepper on hand.  It was great.  The marinade caramelized perfectly giving it a perfect sweet/savory combo.  I am NOT a salmon fan, and my husband is a HUGE salmon fan.  We are VERY happy to have found a way we both like salmon!

I have made this twice now and my family loves it. I have been cooking salmon for years but never had as good of a recipe as this. The only addition I made was sqeezing a lemon over the top of it after it was done. My husband is so hard to please and both times I have made this recipe he has commented on how good it was.
Its a keeper in our house.

I will definitely be making this again! Cooked perfectly right on the gas grill. Cooked it like other reviews said with flesh side down and then flipped it once finishing with skin side down. Cooked till it flaked nicely and temped out. Husband loved it!!! This is my new favorite salmon recipe. I was short on time so I only let the fish marinate for one hour and it turned out really tasty.

I don't care much for salmon and I tried this recipe for my boyfriend. I tried it and thought it tasted pretty darn good. Now I eat salmon about once a week!

This is an excellent marinade for salmon.  went exactly by the recipe except I used Lite Soy Sauce and omitted the salt  ( we have to watch our sodium).  Will be making this again.  Will marinate it longer.

If you're reading this recipe and see the step that says marinate for 2 hours and think oh well, I don't have that much time...think again. I marinated for only 1 hour and it was delicious. I grilled it inside on my Cuisinart.

Absolutely fantastic! I like this recipe SOOO much I just bought $30 worth of salmon at Sams and I'm marinating the whole slab in this stuff. I add Weber roasted garlic and herb seasoning on top of the salmon, press it into the skin a bit with a spoon, throw it on a grill with some hickory chips and boy....I'm sure glad salmon is healthy because I can easily eat twice the portion they usually serve in restaurants!  You don't have to wait the two hours to enjoy the enhanced flavor of this recipe, but I found doing so certainly does enrich the flavor. Huge fan.  Use it at least weekly.

I finally was able to make salmon that was edible!  This was wonderful. I broil in oven for 7 minutes on each side - no grill. I also left out garlic because stomach issues. Husband loves this.

Oh my was this good. Made this salmon this evening and hubby loved it. Followed the recipe except did not add salt or garlic powder. Did boil the marinade and used alittle extra on the side. My salmon was done in about 12 minutes with the grill at 350 degrees. Will definitely be making this again and again...

Amazing recipe.  Completely gets rid of the oiliness of the fish that my husband always complains about with salmon.  I switched the lemon pepper for the more flavorful 1/3 cup fresh squeezed lemon and 1/2 tsp pepper.  I also left out the garlic and increased the brown sugar a little bit.  I marinated it for about 3 hours in foil packets and baked them in the packets for 30 minutes and it was perfect.  Simple and delicious.  Even the kids enjoyed it, and that's saying a lot since one daughter has never liked salmon before.

Well...I'm 'stupidfied' about how good this is. I followed the recipe besides adding a little honey w/ the brown sugar. I let it thaw and marinate for 3-4 hours. My new Cusinart Griddle/Grill set at 350 degrees on both grill plates rendered an exceptional tasting fillet. Moist, not too salty (did use low sodium soy sauce), not to sweet...just wonderful. Can 28,000 reviewers be wrong (give or take a few thousand)? One time I added some Tabasco sauce and leek rings (needed to use). Whereas this is too salty to turn into a sauce by boiling, I might use this as my default marinade. Needle nose pliers worked well to pick pin bones. I like salmon skin, especially if it gets crispy.

I have made this for years and my friends and family love it! The one thing I do differently is I cook the marinade while the salmob is grilling. Stir constantly until it is the consistency of a glaze then pour on top the fish and rice if you have some.

Made this tonight for dinner.  Couldn't grill due to the weather, so tried the foil packets...15 minutes at 425. So delicious! Made enough sauce to drizzle over the rice.  I love this sauce!  Thank you!!!

I have to get on the "I love this recipe" bandwagon!  It really was good...so simple and so flavorful.  I ended up grilling on the BBQ over gas flame...oil made flames shoot up like fireworks, and charred the skin.  But it was still very tasty.  My boys are more likely to eat anything when it's grilled over an open flame.  I will use this marinade with other meats as well.  By far, my favorite.  (substitutions: used olive oil instead of veggie oil/decreased soy sauce to 1/4 cup as suggested by other reviewer AND mixed it with special soy sauce for soups only and Memmi-soy sauce used for Udon noodle soup base/didn't have lemon pepper powder so used Myer lemon juice and ground pepper/used real garlic instead of powder). 
Thanks for posting this tinamenina.

Excellent Salmon recipe, my gf loved it. I BBQ'd it the first time and tonight I'm baking it. Goes excellent with rice and/or a big salad. I used EVOO instead of veg oil, otherwise used as posted.

Served it for guests last night, perfect! Grilled the salmon and served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Used a slice of lemon and tomato as a garnish. Marinade worked perfectly. Will definitely use again. Prep time was minimal.

I followed the recipe exactly as written; just threw it straight on the grill, and it was AMAZING ! Topped it with scallions, and served with roasted potatoes and mushroom couscous (don't have any veggies laying around or else I would have done green beans). This is our new favorite!

The store did not have salmon so we used steelhead trout, and it was awesome. This is a great recipe even for those who do not care for fish.

We followed the exact recipe and it was absolutely wonderful! The only thing different we did was use a cedar plank to cook it on the grill.

Tasted good. Easy to make. Switched...used olive oil instead of vegetable and honey instead of brown sugar. Worked just as well.

Fantastic! Great recipe, only did three minor things different. First no salt, soy has plenty. second I used a fish basket so you don't need try to flip on grill and last I added a tinder box filled with apple wood chips prior to grilling. just let the wood start smoking and than add the salmon, perfect!

My son is 13 and wanted to try cooking fish. He made this using sunflower seed oil and when he took it off the grill he put butter on top. It was excellent both right off the grill and reheated the next day.

I didn't have the time to marinade the salmon, so instead I brushed the sauce on and every three minutes put on another coat. came out perfect.

This was amazing!  It tasted so good.  The only thing I did different was that I added Barbecue sauce  and I did not use brown sugar.  Other wise it is an amazing recipe.  I think it is good to play around with it and kind off suit it to your own taste buds.

We love this recipe, you don't only have to grill the salmon you can all so bake it, use all the marinade when doing so.
I've tried this with chicken thighs skinned and de-boned, loved it as well. Thank you for the Recipe.

I used this recipe with a couple tweaks and everyone at the party loved it including my wife who is not one for fish. I added lemon juice (just a splash)to the marinade and cut the soy in half and replaced it with teriyaki sauce. Marinated for 24 hrs in a vac seal bag with no air. Perfect glaze and tenderness.

Very tasty.  Only thing we did  different was grill it on a well-soaked cedar plank.  Will make again.   Made this a second time and this time substituted water for white wine.  We baked it in the oven at 400 degree 15-20 min.  Love it and it is so easy.  Making it one of my "GO TO" salmon recipes.  Made it this time in my air fryer--360 degrees for 10 minutes.  Obviously this salmon is good any way you cook it.

The.Best.Salmon.EVER!! I've been using this recipe for about two years....it is our family's absolute favorite meal...kids included. The edges get slightly carmalized and the salmon stays so moist. Love, love, love! One note: I do not add salt to taste...none needed!

This was great!!! I didn't have lemon pepper on hand so I used some lemon juice and pepper. Besides that I kept the recipe the same. I took the advice of others and placed the salmon flesh side down on the grill first and it did not stick at all. I also just mixed all the ingredients in the zip lock bag, makes no sense to dirty a bowl if you are just going to pour everything into the bag anyways. This is my favorite recipe for salmon that I have found.

I did not have lemon pepper, so I just used a tablesppon of lemon juice on the salmon. As suggested by another reviewer, I started with the salmon side down. I am not sure that it mattered because I was using a George Foreman Grill. With the lid down, it cooked on both sides. Even so, I still cooked it for 8 minutes and then flipped the salmon for 5 more minutes. (I was cooking a 2 lb. piece of salmon.) I was perfect! It was flaky, but still juicy. Next time I will marinate overnight and not just 2 hours. I would like to see if I can get more of the soy sauce flavor. This is a great salmon recipe!!

Didn't have time to marinate the salmon, so we just brushed the sauce on top and let it sit for 20 min while the grill heated up.  Tasty!

I used frozen salmon fillets and marinated for less than 30 minutes because I decided I wanted salmon at the last minute. My usual go to recipe for salmon (which calls for ginger and other ingredients I don't usually keep on hand) was not an option. This recipe was simple, used ingredients found in most every kitchen, and was delish. I added red pepper flakes for taste and instead of grilling I baked them individually wrapped in foil at 400 for 20 minutes. If you want more of a glaze atop the fish, just unwrap them after cooking time, brush with the juices and broil for a minute or so.

I have tried a LOT of salmon marinades. My dad always swore by brown sugar but he uses Dijon mustard in his "go-to" recipe which I always found a bit strong. I tried this marinade just the way it is ingredient-wise. The thing I did do that may be a bit different was that I took a grilling basket and grilled it flesh side down like the reviewer KATHY had mentioned. Using the grilling basket you avoid a lot of the meat tending to stick to the grill.  I then finished it off skin side down. That really left a nice brown sugar glaze on the top but allowed me to finish it off slowly and still peel the meat right from the skin. Worked great. Go easy on the "to-taste" seasonings if you like the salmon flavor to burst through. The lemon-pepper adds a nice flavor. definitely 5 star.

Really tasty! Instead of rubbing garlic powder into it, I mixed 2T of fresh garlic in the marinade itself.

Reallly tasty, really easy.  I skipped the salt, since the soy sauce was already salty.  Might cut back a smidge on the brown sugar next time.  I served this with the Lemon-Basil Quinoa Salad recipe on this site, fresh fruit, and stir fried vegetables.  Everyone really liked it.

Excellent!  My daughter declared it her favorite meal.  I marinated an hour or so, and cooked in a skillet on stove top.  I added some of the marinade to the pan for added flavor.  Definitely in the rotation.

This was so incredibly easy and so good! I used a little less soy sauce and added a little more brown sugar and it came out delicious!! I made it for my fiance and he couldn't stop saying, "mmmm!" whenever he would take a bite, haha! That's when I know he really loves the way something tastes. He loves salmon and I really dislike it, but with this recipe I gobbled it all up! Super delicious and really tasty!

We had a big thick piece of salmon. After 7 min on each side it started coming apart. We cut it in half and it wasn't even half cooked. So we put foil under and finished cooking it like that.

This salmon was amazing!!!  I made exactly to the recipe.....   I also boiled the leftover marinade on the stove with a bit of cornstarch (to thicken) and we used the sauce to pour over the fish after serving.  I even found my husband spooning it on his roll!!!  It is awesome!

I pretty much followed the recipe but cut the cooking time to 9 minutes -- 5 skin-side down and 4 flesh-side down (more or less the 10-minutes per inch rule). Perfect!

My non-fish-eating husband really liked this. Loved with brown rice on the side. After making this a few more times, I found that the longer it marinates, the better it tastes. I also add a tsp of minced fresh ginger and a tbsp minced garlic.

This is so close to my favorite fix for salmon.  I use equal parts low sodium soy sauce, brown sugar and lemon juice and a generous amount of fresh grated ginger.  The lemon juice balances the brown sugar so it isn't so sweet.  I then baste while cooking for added flavor.  Love it!  Also for those who blame this recipe for being fishy, It is likely because your fish was on the verge of spoiling.  Salmon is healthy and it is not fishy when fresh. It may also help you if you remove the skin.

Seriously the best salmon I have ever tried! I followed the top comments advice on cutting back some of the soy sauce and it was delicious. It reminded me off the eel roll sushi, which is my favorite.  I definitely will be making this again. :-p I just realized I never wrote what I did different, I didnt have lemon pepper so i used just a little bit of lemon juice over the fish with some black pepper. I cut down the soy sauce to 1/4 cup instead. I also put the salmon in a glass dish to let it cook in its own juices. I didnt even let it marinade for a couple hours and it still turned out amazing!

The recipe for this sauce was so simple, but I was so hungry at the time I couldn't wait 2hrs for the salmon to marinate and I didn't grill either. I made the maranade and put the salmon in a large pan, let the marinade come to a boil and then simmered my salmon in it for 6min and it was excellent!
I do plan on grilling and using this same recipe correctly. So simple and tasty. Thanks!

We had this tonight and it was awesome!  Everyone loved and wanted more than I cooked!  
A repeater for sure especially since it's so easy to prepare.
Don't overcook the salmon!

After spending $30 + on 2 pounds of Alaskan wild salmon we chose this recipe and were so happy we did.  We changed nothing and followed the advice of the Alaskan resident that said to  cook it meat side down for about 7 minutes and then turn and cook skin side down for about seven minutes. Ours was a thick cut and I used a meat thermometer to bring the internal temperature to 145 degrees.   I did use Pam for grilling spray and was glad I did.

I've done this a few times now, and really love it. The last couple of times my only change was to add dried crushed chili pepper to the marinade for just a touch of spice, and to add a dash of sesame oil because I love that on fish. Awesome!

I've made this several times and I LOVE IT!!!!! I had a question though I just marinated 2 pounds and realized how late it was. I was thinking of leaving it overnight and maybe cooking it tomorrow afternoon. What's the longest I can keep it in the marinade and refrigerated?

For those who say that it was bland: the fish needs good seasoning with salt and garlic, soya sauce doesn't do the job because it's in the mix. Also depends on the thickness, mine was bit more than 1". When the fish goes in the marinade, it kind of washes away the salt from the fish. Anyway, we liked this recipe, but needs some experience in seasoning to get it great.

I ate half of it 4 hours later and it was better, no fishy taste at all!

I boiled the marinade for a couple of minutes and it was great-just couple tablespoons-over basmati rice. Love anything with soya,sugar and garlic mix.

We had used another salmon marinade the night before but my daughter liked this one much better. I guess I will add a little more garlic powder. I don't eat fish but she does so I want it to taste good and she said it was a "KEEPER" Thanks!!!

Very tasty.  Only had time to marinade for 45 minutes instead of the 2 hours it calls for.  I'm sure it will get 5 stars if I make it right.

I added a little lemon juice to all other ingredient's and used an indoor grill. Time was not on my side so I used a fork to poke a few holes in the salmon to allow the mix to sink in a little quicker. It's Very Good.

Was very good. Used the idea of placing fish skin side up for a few minutes to caramelize the top that worked well. As in all fish dishes the key is to get the freshest fish possible.

Wow!  I have always blackened Salmon and it's always been a hit, but this adds so much!  I did the marinate exactly following the recipe.  Once ready to grill (which I used the griddle on my stove top) I seasoned with garlic salt, Magic Salmon Seasoning and Garlic Pepper on both sides.  Grilled well on first side till blackened, flipped and covered until done and blackened on 2nd side.  This marinate added such a wonderful sweet crispness to the blackening, I'll definitely use it again!

Love this recipe - the things I changed were that I wrapped all in one foil pack and topped with fresh spinach and lemon slices and baked at 425 for about 20 minutes - because I added sliced lemons, I skipped lemon-pepper - salmon and veggie in same package - DELISH!!!

we really, really liked this dish. We used the first suggestion of using tin foil, so we made a foil basket around the fish and seasoned and pour in some sauce in each foil boat. We also added fresh chopped garlic. We put in the oven at 425 for 15 minutes and it came out deliciously. We had a side of white rice and steamed broccoli. I cant wait to share this with friends and family!

My go-to! This marinade is so simple and so delicious. It doesn't over power the fish, but rather complements it. Everyone I've made it for has raved about it and asked for the recipe.

UPDATE: I NEEDED AN EASY MEAL TO SERVE GUESTS (MY PARENTS). MY HUBS AND I HAD A BUSY DAY AND TIME IN THE KITCHEN WAS LIMITED. THIS FIT THE BILL PERFECTLY. FYI, AS OTHERS HAVE ADVISED, GRILL YOUR FISH SKIN SIDE UP FIRST. IT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE! I wouldn't say this is the BEST salmon I've ever had (it's decent...), but it's quick to prepare (marinating aside) and made for a fuss-free, satisfying dinner. It took less than 15 minutes for my husband to grill our fish and for me to assemble our sides (steamed jasmine rice and Cooking_Muse's Japanese-style green beans). While there are other salmon recipes I've enjoyed much more flavor-wise, it's nice to have a quick option to turn to when life gets a little hectic! I can see this becoming a staple just for that. :) Thanks for sharing your recipe, tinamenia!

Not a fan. Cooked it just as recipe said, even in foil pack, broiled, made "gravy".  Had high hopes because sounded delicious. But, alas, guess I have a different palate. It was too sweet for us. I prefer some seasonings, garlic, & lemon or lime. Plain Jane, I suppose! My husband didn't care for it, either.

This is amazing! Easier than it sounds to make. I took someone's advice and marinated and grilled it in foil packets.  The seasoning steamed in, and no mess to clean up!  My husband who usually doesn't like fish unless it's Mrs. Paul's deep fried, LOVED this!!!

Great marinade! We've made it six or so times, and each time it's been fantastic. We sub olive oil for the vegetable, and we've found that marinating overnight makes a huge difference in increasing the flavor. Also, don't be afraid to go heavy on the lemon pepper!

My cooking skills are barely beyond boiling water, but this grilled salmon recipe worked out great for me. I did reduce the brown sugar by about 40% and used olive oil in place of vegetable oil. I grilled the marinated salmon skin side down first, using a "Denmark Cast Aluminum Grill and Griddle" on a ceramic cooktop. I covered it with a skillet lid and cooked it for 6 min per side. The 1/2 lb salmon fillet was bought at my local supermarket since I live in "fly over country". It was wonderfully tender and tasty skin included. Accompanied with a rice medley and washed down with a cold beer.

Tonight will be my third time making this and I love it! I used the foil trick (wrapping each in foil packets) at 425 for 15 mins and it comes out perfect every time. I also freeze leftovers and it still turns out delicious! ...I'm not even a salmon fan!

I made this in a grill pan on the stove.  I used low-sodium soy sauce and didn't add salt (it doesn't really need salt...people can add their own)I also by choosing like olive oil...this is a recipe that I will use over and over again...in fact...next time I'll probably have
to get more salmon...there weren't any leftovers...

This was delish!!!!  I highly recommend this recipe. I followed the directions but added a little lemon juice and dill on my salmon. This marinade will probably go well with chicken too. I'm trying that out next. Excellent!!!

This was the nicest grilled salmon I've made yet. I made it with 1.66 pounds of frozen sockeye, and marinated it for about 2.5 hours. I found the flavor a bit mild, so I wish I would have marinated it a lot longer. Not fantastic, but maybe worth making again sometime.

I used the juice of a lemon and 1/2 tsp fresh ground pepper in place of the lemon pepper seasoning.  My boys really liked this but I would've preferred to have a glaze to baste it with.  Next time I think I'll make a soy sauce/brown sugar glaze for it.

This is my 'go to' salmon recipe.  Everyone in the family loves it.  I didn't have lemon pepper so I just used lemon juice & pepper!  I cook them in the oven in foil packets.

not trying this again it is too sweet, yet so plain. Needs many more spices or extra flavoring ingredients. My family absolutely didn't like nor did I. :-/

I made this last night for my boyfriend and he absolutely LOVED it! I don't have a grill so I baked it at 450 for 12 minutes and broiled it for 5. It turned out super tender and delicious! I would definitely make this recipe again.

Love. I bake this in a foil pouch in a 425 oven for ~15 minutes, then finish under the broiler for 3 minutes. (Last time I used one ~3/4lb piece of salmon). Easy peasy. Serve with rice and some veg.

I have yet to use this marinade on the grill, but I have done as another reviewer recommended and cooked the salmon in a foil packet in the oven at 425 for 15 minutes. I scale the recipe down to one serving and marinate the filet in a ziplock baggie. Quick, easy and delicious meal for one!

This recipe turned out quite nicely. I let it marinate for 3 hours and cooked it to perfection. It was perfectly cooked. However, for my taste, it was slightly too salty and sweet. It may be all right for most, but I would cut the amount of sugar and salt to maybe 2/3 of what is called for. I'm not much of a sweet-for-dinner person anyway and I have sensitive taste. I also added about three Tbs of lemon to break down the meat just a little and add some spunk. It was amazing because it helped the salmon melt in the mouth even more! Ah, and when I cooked it, I cooked it covered the entire time to keep moisture and cooked at medium low heat to avoid burning.

Fantastic recipe! We let it marinade all day then grilled it on foil so it wouldn't stick to the grill. We also used the leftover marinade to create a sauce by adding cornstarch and heating on the stove like others suggested. Both my husband and I thought it was to die for. We will definitely be making this again!

We love this marinade.  I grill it 6minutes flesh side down, as recommended, then 5-6 min on skin side.  I wanted to like salmon so I gave it this recipe a try.  We love it.

This marinade came out awesome!  I used hickory Kingsford charcoal, pecan wood chunks and apple wood chunks.  Salmon filets were cooked indirect on alder wood plank.

This was fantastic. It is perfect for the grill and the sauce does not overpower the taste of the salmon. Two suggestions though, anytime the recipe calls for soy sauce, it's a pretty good bet that you won't need the salt. Also, there are fish racks that enable you to grill fish without it sticking to the grates and falling through the cracks. This went great with rice and greens, and of course, a nice white wine.

I made exactly as written and it was amazing.  I only had time to marinate for 30 minutes and it was tender, juicy, and flavored all the way through.  I cooked the remaining marinade (added a little cornstarch mixed with water to thicken) and dressed the final dish.  It was delicious served with coconut rice (also on this site).  Yummo!

I also add fresh ground garlic to the marinade.

This was delicious. I did have to make a few changes though. I ran out of soy sauce so I used teriyaki sauce to make 1/3 cup - honestly, I think however you did this (soy vs teriyaki) would be good. I let this marinate in the fridge for about 5 hours. Since it decided to rain that day, I also took the suggestion of another reviewer and baked this in a foil packet for 15 minutes at 425.

So delicious for so little work. The amount of marinade was plenty enough for 2.5 pounds of salmon which all grilled wonderfully. Served with asparagus and polenta.

Best way to make salmon!! I always use fresh garlic and lemon juice but that's because I always have it on hand. I'm sure it's fine the way the recipe states. The soy and brown sugar are perfect together!

I made this recipe as is for my husband and myself Sunday for dinner. I am not a salmon eater. I've never been able to make it taste good, therefore I've never really liked it, but this recipe made it palatable for me. My husband LOVED it. This is definitely a keeper and I'll be making it again.

I made this for the whole family and it was a hit.  I actually forgot to add anything lemon to it and we decided we liked it all the better for that.  I didn't season the salmon steaks themselves but put a bit of minced garlic in the above marinade.  I grilled it on an open flame bbq (no tinfoil) and it simply melted in the mouth.  Delicious!

I give this salmon about 3.5 stars. There is nothing wrong with it, but from other salmon recipes it didn't seem to have much other flavor other than the salmon and a very light glaze that could only be tasted on the very top. I broiled it instead of grilling it. That's not usually a problem. When they were done I put about a tsp. of butter on each one, spritz of olive oil, and a light sprinkle of garlic salt. That made it a little less dry and gave it a tad more flavor.

Yup.  It's good.  No question.  I even liked the skin - somehow turned out a little crunchy.  Used one lot of marinade for two lots of salmon, two nights running.

Delicious!  I marinated for over 24 hours.  I baked in oven at 425 degrees for 20-25 min.  I also heated the remaining marinade in a small saucepan, along with a little flour, and added the thickened sauce to the top of the salmon about 5 min before finished cooking.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband DOES NOT like any kind of fish...EVER! He enjoyed TWO fillets of this variation. Marinated for 4 hours. Wrapped in foil pouch, baked in oven due to bad weather. Perfection! We will grill next time (as recipe recommends), but we can't imagine it tasting any better. Winner!!

Made this at my MIL's house and it was fantastic!  My variation: I cut the brown sugar in half.  I also didn't have 2 hours to marinade, so I put in fridge for 30 minutes, then drizzled some of the marinade on top of the salmon before putting it the oven.  Mother-in-law said I was the best cook & kiddies asked for "third" helpings.

I used lemon zest, fresh lemon juice, and marinated it in an oven safe bag, so that it could go from fridge to oven.  1lb at 425 took about 20 minutes.  Thanks!

I have made this recipe several times and have enjoyed it every time.  My husband isn't a big fish eater and he even likes this.   I let it marinate over night so that it is ready to cook when we come home from work.

I've made this several times and should have written a review sooner.  My husband never liked salmon, when I made this for dinner one night he was not very excited...now it's one of his favorite meals.  I reduce the marinade and brush the fish after it comes off the grill....so good

Recipe was easy to cook and tasted great. I didn't have the lemon pepper, so I substituted lemon juice with black pepper and it turned out just as good.

Fantastic!! This really is good. We don't use the lemon pepper (I used a little lime juice) and it really was wonderful!!  I only marinated 30 min, I didn't have 2+ hours to wait. I like it the way we did it. I think it may have been too sweet if we went the 2 hours.

Made this tonight and it turned out great!  I took the advise of one of the reviewers and baked in individual foil packets. Then I broiled to make the tops a bit toasted.  Turned out great!  Will be making again.

A very simple recipe that is a crowd pleaser.   In our family, adults and kids give this one rave reviews, and it's a quick solution for a healthy meal.  Give it a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed.

The best recipe by far for fish!!!!

I use 1/3 C lemon juice and black pepper to taste along w/ sea salt and garlic powder. I also wrap it in a foil packet and bake for about 20 mns on 450 and then broil it for about 6 more mns. It is so good this is the only way I will cook fish and all my kids (7,5,3, and 1) and my husband LOVE IT!!!! It is so good w/ the balsamic asparagus and crock pot mashed potatoes recipes from this site.

Great recipe! Salmon was moist and delicious! Kids and husband loved the salmon. Doubled the amount as I had a Costco size salmon piece to cook down. Plan to reheat the leftover filets and serve over spinach.

Very good!  I substituted a pack of splenda for the brown sugar, left out the water and used lemon juice and pepper instead of lemon pepper.  Tried it grilled and on a cedar plank, both were good but preferred it grilled.

Fabulous. I don't like lemon pepper so just used salt and garlic powder instead. Only had time to marinate about 1.5 hours. It was delicious.

Everyone seemed to like except the younger ones.  They seem to prefer more of a lemon flavor on their salmon.

I have never liked salmon until now. Great and simple recipe. Also, my new taste for it could be that I now only buy sockeye, which has a great taste.

Oh. My. Gosh! This was delicious! I would've followed the recipe as written BUT I was looking for a recipe at the last minute and I could only marinate the fish for 1 hour. It was so flavorful, I can only imagine what it would've tasted like had I marinated it completely! I loved the flavor that the soy sauce gave it, the brown sugar was perfect and next time I'll use more garlic powder. This was just absolutely wonderful served with steamed veggies!

This is SO great!!!  This marinade turned the salmon haters in my family to salmon lovers--there were seriously no leftovers when I made it the first time.  I've learned to make a little more so that I can cut the leftovers up and use in a salad with crumbled goat cheese the next day for lunch!  Great recipe!

First time I have made my own marianade and it turned out fantastically.  Really simple recipe, with a great end product.  Plus the excess marinade made for a tasty sauce when thickened with some cornstarch.

I combined the brown sugar and soy in a sauce pan for about 2 min.  It thickened a little and clung nicely to the fish since I didn't have the time to marinate it. Also, I omitted the salt and water and added Tastefully Simple Minced Garlic.  Delish!!!!!

Good.  Soya sauce adds a different flavour from other grilled salmons I have made.

The first time making this we guesstimated on the measurements and didn't have time to marinate for the two hours but it was still delicious even with just the hint of the seasoning - also note: I used garlic salt instead of garlic powder+table salt. The second time I measured things out properly and although still very good, I found it to get a little overwhelming with the salt about half way through the filet. I like sweet with salmon so next time I will use a little less soy sauce than called for and a little more brown sugar.

Update: I kept the left over marinade (that I had set aside to brush on while grilling) and added about two pinches more brown sugar to what was probably 4-5 tablespoons left of marinade. I coated the left over salmon and slow re-heated it. It was perfect; not too sweet at all and cut down the salt taste just enough. Delicious!

Truly amazing!  My 9 year old begs me to make this almost weekly.  I do not change a thing.  We love it.  Usually serve on bed of spinach and side of edamame in pods.  Thank you!!!

No need to grill this at all.  I love the foil packet idea.  It is a great way to serve salmon to a large group.  I get a huge slab of salmon and Costco, and cut them into individual fillets, depending on number of guests.  Also, I usually don't marinade at all, I just divide up the marinade evenly and poor in the foil pocket and then each guest can use the left over sauce to poor over their brown rice.  So flavorful, so healthy, and kids really like it too.  Definitely favorite salmon recipe, just as good as restuarant prepared salmon, actually better!!!!

Ok, so I made this for my fam tonight....instant winner! My 7 yr old loved it and my 4 yr old cleaned her plate! my husband who had already had dinner with the boys and "just wanted a bite" ate a full serving. And he doesn't "like fish" I did make a few changes...fresh lemon and cracked pepper as well and minced garlic and onion. Also only 1/8 c olive oil in place of veg oil. I grilled flesh down for 1 min, made a 1/4 turn and grilled another min I love markings. Flipped skin down, basted with marinade and grilled 7 mins. Added corn starch to remaining marinade and reduced for a sauce. Already planning on making this again!

We enjoyed the outside flavor, but it doesn't get into the flakes of fish.  So, next time, we're going to try to inject the salmon to get the flavor throughout the fish.  We've never injected fish before, but it's definitely worth experimenting.

so simple, so amazingly tasty! I used low sodium soy sauce to cut back the salt intake.
I tried it with thick boneless pork chops & it was MORE amazing. I added one full Thai chilli for some kick & my husband went crazy for it. Next I'm going to try it with stir fry & steamed rice.. so many options!

I made the marinade for the salmon and ended up marinating it for 52 hours. I kept turning the salmon in the marinade and ended up broiling it.  Everyone loved it and wanted to know what was in it, etc.  This was the  best salmon I ever made and every one said the meal was better than most restaurants.  Thank You!!!!

I have numerous salmon recipes, as we eat it a couple of times a week.  This is my favorite - followed recipe directions exactly & I thought it was perfect.  No need to make any adjustments, maybe cooking time depending on thickness of salmon.  A little on the sweet side, just the way I like it!

I gave this a try based on reviews, but was apprehensive thinking it might be too sweet. I'm glad I took the chance.  We loved it. Cooked marinade and used it on leftover salmon next day. Enjoyed it enough to make it again soon. Thanks.

I made this exactly as listed.  I know that most of the reviews loved it, but both my husband and I thought it was way too sweet.  Neither of us appreciate a sweet glaze, so this is just a personal preference.  I will make it again, but will probably half the brown sugar.  If you like sweet on your fish, this is definately the marinade for you.

This was excellent. My entire family loved it. My salmon filet was 3 lbs and I grilled it without foil and it fell apart when I tried to flip it. Next time I will cut it into smaller pieces so that it's not so hard to flip. Some of it got a little chard but that was still tasty. I will definitely make this again.

This was really good!  I'm not too into fish, but I'm trying to be healthier.  
I didn't have soy sauce, so I used A1, which worked really well.  I can't say whether it was better than the soysauce.

While I don't eat salmon myself, my husband and our guests all loved this...I did add a smidge more brown sugar than called for - when tasting the marinade before I added the fish I just thought it could be a little sweeter...

Followed the recipe using pure olive oil in place of vegetable oil since it was what I had, and grilling for six minutes per side at 300F on a Sanyo electric grill in my kitchen. Looking back I should have gone seven minutes per side as it was fully cooked at six minutes but only barely. Still very tasty though.

Very good! I cooked the salmon in a cast iron skillet, added all of the marinade.  Then I added mushroom and red wine vinegar (it was lacking some acid for my taste) and turned the marinade into a warm dressing and served it all over spinach with sliced mango.

The marinade is delicious!  I added sliced onions, sliced baby bella mushrooms, and torn swiss chard to the broiling pan.  Paired with a nice smooth Zinfandel.

I had some tilapia and was looking for a marinade and came across this recipe.  It was excellent and had just the right amount of salty sweetness!  We can't wait to have this again!

Totally enjoyed this salmon.  I left it in tin foil as suggested by another reviewer and it was very good.

I loooove this recipe! I made this for my husband with a Cesar salad and he thought it was the best salmon he had in a long time and he eats it often. A crowd pleaser and I made no changes to the recipe. Thanks

Wow! I was never a fan of salmon before I guess because I really didn't know how to cook it.  This was very,very tasty! I used salmon steaks though because the woman at the fish counter recommended them instead of fillets when grilling. This will be definitely be on our grilling rotation!

My 22 year old daughter loves salmon and asked me to please make it for her family birthday dinner. I wasn't looking forward to the meal because my husband and I have never been big salmon fans....or so we thought.  My husband took one bite and asked, "What kind of fish is this? It's delicious!". I followed your recipe marinade exactly, but I actually cooked it like the blogger below (loose aluminum foil wrap in oven) recommended.  All I can say is....perfection! Bravo to both of you :)

Great dish. I had to use teriyaki sauce since I had no soy sauce.  The recipe still turned out great.  The family loved it.

Fantastic!! No "fishy" smell, made a nice crust on the fish and it was beautiful :) My only not-really-a-complaint complaint was that the skin stuck to my grill pan. But when I used a spatula to lift the salmon the skin stayed behind. Lots of elbow grease later on, but made the salmon perfectly de-skinned.

Awesome recipe! The only thing I do differently is marinade the salmon for 8-10 hours. This has been our go-to salmon recipe for a few years now.

OMG!!!!  I would give this 100 stars if I could!  The only thing that I changed was to use some lemon juice and regular pepper because I didn't have lemon pepper.  It is out of this world and we will be eating this all summer!  Easy, healthy and fast!  Who could ask for more??? Oh yeah, delicious! This recipe has all the bases covered!

Made it to a T.  Next time we will wait until the grill gets to 350 before we put the salmon on.  As a side note, make sure you dont eat the dark gray meat next to the skin, it is very fishy.

This recipe was great! The brown sugar gave the salmon a sweet taste that created a great combination. Instead of grilling the salmon, I did the little foil pockets in the oven which was just as great!

Amazing recipe! The salmon cooked amazingly with just 7 minutes on the fleshy side, and about 4-6 minutes on the skin side. It was so moist and flavourful. I marinated it for an hour instead of 2 because they say you shouldn't marinate fish for more than an hour (only the very richest for that long, and others for no more than 30 minutes) because the acid starts to break down the proteins, causing a mushy fish. 

Excellent recipe!

I use this recipe very often but substitute honey for the brown sugar and water. Only using equal parts oil (either olive oil or sunflower seed oil) honey and soy sauce. I cook in an oven of 435f skin side up so as to protect the soft meat and then flip after about 10 minutes to brown the top basting after I flip. I serve with homemade fried rice and oven roasted sliced red bell peppers. A wonderful meal full of flavor!

A nice change from my usual baked salmon.  My husband really liked it.  I thought it was a bit too sweet so I may delete or reduce the sugar.  I also added some crushed ginger.  Will add more ginger next time.

I substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil. I also added some fresh minced garlic in the marinade. I ran out of time to cook it the night I prepped it...so it marinated a day. My grill wasn't working so I broiled it in the oven. This was the BEST salmon I've ever had. My kids were eating it like they hadn't had anything to eat for days!!!!

This was awesome, however I did add 1tsp each basil, thyme, parsley and 1/2 tsp garlic powder. I am not a fish eater and my husband and I both loved it.  It had great crust from grilling but still very moist. It will be a staple recipe for Salmon

Wow!! Wonderful recipe!! My husband and son just returned from a fishing trip to Alaska last night and our freezer is full of salmon. We have never been big fish eaters, so we are now on the hunt for good salmon recipes. This one left nothing to be desired! In fact, my picky 6 year old had 4 servings! This is a keeper for sure!

Made this last night on the grill.  It was Awesome!!!  Kids loved it.  Was only able to marinate for 30-45 min, but still great flavor.  This will become one of our staples.

Pretty good. My husband loved it. I thought it was about a 3.5. I used frozen salmon though. Maybe better with fresh salmon next time

I used a little less brown sugar and substituted olive oil.   I also used fresh lemon rather than lemon pepper and no salt.   This turned out great!  This enhanced the salmon flavor without overwhelming it.  The last few times we grilled the salmon without marinating and although it's good, it's just a little bland.  I will definitely make this again.

Change the lemon pepper to the juice of one lemon and one lime and fresh cracked pepper. Leave out the water, whisk together and marinate your salmon for 30 minutes and grill on cedar planks. Yum!

If you're pressed for time and/or ingredients, a simple brown sugar & black pepper rub is delicious whether salmon is grilled, baked, or poached.

Thanks for the recipe! This turned out so good. I uploaded my picture as proof. When I grilled my salmon, I put foil down on the grill. I oiled the foil with pam so they would not stick. I can't wait to make this again.

This is exactly like the recipe I use for salmon, except that I use citrusy Ponzu Sauce instead of soy sauce, and freshly ground pepper instead of lemon pepper. The whole family loves it.

Everyone loved this.  The kids even said "this fish is yummy!"  I let it marinate overnight in the fridge.  Didn't use the oil (no need to with such a fatty fish).

This was very easy to make and turned out excellent.  We had a gathering of people at our home and one person would eat only fish so we made this recipe.  It was a hit!  I used light soy sauce to avoid the risk of the fish being too salty.  It worked!

It was pouring outside so I had to bake the fish.  It was still awesome, cant wait to try it on the grill.  Just the right amount of sweet, not over powering. My husband, who doesnt like fish said he liked it, and that he will only eat fish if I cook it :)

This is one of the best salmon recipes I have had. My familyn isn't big on fish but they ate this one up! I let it marinate for 4-5 hours and did use the foil wrap method to keep the grill clean. This one's a keeper!

I wish I had the option to give this 10 stars!  I made the marinade exactly as stated, the only thing I changed (because we don't have a grill) is that I put it in the oven at 350 degrees for 25-30 minutes.  Not only did I LOVE it but so did my parents and 3 of my neighbors when I shared our leftovers with them.  This was AMAZING and is definitely my go to salmon recipe!

Update:  It's been 4 years since I first tried this recipe and it is still my go to recipe.  My husband is in love with it and I'm pretty sure it's the reason he married me ;)

I made this dish for my boyfriend and he loved it. 
I followed the advice of using 1/4 c of soy sauce instead, used 1/3 c of lemon juice and dash of pepper instead of lemon pepper, and 1/4 c of olive oil. It turned out perfectly on the BBQ grill!

We love this! I changed just a couple of things though.  I use olive oil instead of veg.oil and I use teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce (that was an accident at first, but my husband loved it, so i continued!)  it such a great flavor!

Excellent recipe!! I marinaded it for a little over 3 hours, and I baked it in the oven instead of grilling, but other than that I kept everything the same.  Such a delicious and simple dish!!

This was so incredibly tasty! I followed the recipe as written, but as we like spicy, added some paprika, maybe chili powder next time. Yummy! Highly recommend this one.  I marinated for 6 hours.

I didn't add or delete from the marinade ingredients but I did cut the salmon into serving sizes and put them in tinfoil packets on a bed of sliced onions and poured the marinade over top before sealing and cooking them on the grill.  We aren't big fish eaters but we really enjoyed this one!

First I have to say that I didn't follow this recipe exactly as stated.  I used garlic powder + fresh garlic, and lemon pepper + lemon juice.  I also only used about 1 T of vegetable oil since I was baking and not grilling so I figured I didn't need that much.  

I baked the salmon in individual foil pouches at 425 for 15 min like others recommended and the salmon came out nice and moist.  Unfortunately I was disappointed that there was very little taste other than saltiness (and on the thinner parts of the filet it was way too salty).  I didn't really taste lemon or garlic or anything else, even though in the original sauce I did.  

I saved the sauce as recommended and added more brown sugar plus a bit of honey as well as flour to thicken it up.  It was a delicious sweet and salty sauce but unfortunately I could not use it since the salmon itself was already too salty without additional sauce.

I read other reviews that said this sauce overpowered the taste of the salmon and I both agree and disagree.  The saltiness made some of the thinner parts of the salmon taste just awful and yes - it covered up the taste of the salmon!  However, in the middle and with thicker filets, the salmon was very obvious and the sauce (well, saltiness was subtle.

I will try this recipe and perhaps add a little honey to the original recipe and play around with the ingredients a little more since I like the idea of a salty sweet glaze for salmon and I like the ingredients list.

Really good.  My husband and I made it and we really liked it.  Just a note, don't put your grill on high, put it on medium.  I accidentally burnt some of it.

I didn't have the luxury to wait two hours to marinate and it tastes wonderful. Next Time I will wait and marinate. I also used Lemon Juice and lemon pepper with skin down instead of flesh. Tasty...hmmmm

I have never ate salmon nor cooked it. I baked it in a foil tent with the marinade poured over it and sliced lemon on top. OMG, it was great. I will have this again and will use this to entertain people.

Have made this recipe over and over again with little adjustments here and there for difference spices/herbs.  If you worry about burning the salmon on the BBQ I found that you can cook the salmon in a glass pyrex dish and cook it in the marinade at 350 for about 30 minutes.  This cooks the flavour into the fish and you can usse some of the leftover to top onto the salmon on the plate.

this was great! i was a little scared to try it but i gave it a go and am so glad i did! the only thing i wish i would've done was use less soy sauce maybe a 1/4c. or even a little less, it was a little on the salty side. i did add about 1/4 c lemon juice to the marinade and baked them at 425 in foil packets for about 15 min. these were so good i can't wait to make them again!!!

This was pretty good! I thought the flavor didn't penetrate the fish quite as much as I thought it would/should even though I let it marinade about 3 hours. If I used this again I would maybe reduce the leftover marinade on the stove and serve it as a sauce with the fish. I think I should've added more of the lemon pepper/garlic powder seasoning as well.

Excellent Marinade for Salmon! My 2 year old and significant other loved it! I used the low sodium soy sauce and I didn't add the lemon pepper since I didn't have it on hand and the dish was just fine without it...

This was absolutely amazing for such a simple recipe!  The hardest part was getting my monster grill to hold a constant temperature before I started cooking.  ;-)  All I had to do was make minor adjustments to ingredient quantities to taste, and the rest was pure magic.  Everyone loved it!  Made it for a simple treat before leaving for a conference for the weekend, and it left everyone wanting more.  My 5-year old DEMANDED I make it again the night I got back, and was begging for it all weekend!  This is THE new family favorite!  Thanks for such a great and simple recipe!

My family LOVED this recipe!  I don't eat anything that lives in the ocean but I tried it because everyone said it was so very good. I will say even I could eat it and that is saying something!  Thanks for the great recipe, my husband said it was the best salmon he has ever had!

I added a few tablespoons of honey, and had lots of sauce left over.  Overall, it turned out delicious, can't wait to make it again.

This was a really good recipe; I marinated it all night; only thing I did differently was to add some pineapple juice in the marinade and put a slice on the side of the plate.  The recipe stands alone on its own...was worth making again..and I am hard to please.

I just made this tonight and the first word out of my husband's mouth was "WOW"!  The only thing I did differently was use fresh garlic and just about a tablespoon of olive oil instead of the vegetable oil.  Excellent recipe!!  Thank you so much for sharing it with us!

This was very good, but a tiny bit too sweet for me.  I did not have lemon pepper on hand, so I think next time I will make sure to get the right seasoning, kick up the rest of the spices and cut down the sugar a tiny bit.  A really great, fast marinade : ) Thanks!!

I'm not a huge salmon fan, but since it's peak season I thought I would give this a try.  I didn't have lemon pepper so I substituted lemon juicer and fresh ground pepper.  It was delicious, and my husband, who doesn't like fish, absolutely loved it.  Thanks tinamenina!

The marinade does not overwhelm the salmon.  The soy sauce and brown sugar add a light delicate taste that is excellent with wood grilled salmon.  I highly recommend this recipe - my whole family had second and third helpings.

Delicous! Salmon had a nice suble flavor which complimented the salmon rather than overpowering it.  I did substitute sucanat for the brown sugar. I laid tin foil on the grill and the marinate carmelized as it grilled. Be sure to use a high grade of salmon as not to have the fishy taste. We love Soceye! And make sure it's fresh!

This is a great recipe, it always comes out so moist and flavorful!  I usually make it on the George Foreman Grill so I don't have to worry about it sticking and falling apart.  I use low-sodium soy sauce and find that it's not necessary to add any extra salt.

I'm a pescetarian (only meat i eat is fish) so I'm always looking for new fish recipes. THIS IS ONE IS GREAT! I even make it for my steak loving, fish hating dad & sister and they loved every bite. The salmon has no fishy taste and has the perfect balance of sweet and salty. I added more lemon pepper the 2nd time I made this and it was even more delicious. Also, the longer it marinades, the better! Happy cooking!

absolutely delicious! We followed advice and grilled it face down first for 7 min, then flipped the fillet over on the skin side for the remainder 7 mins. PERFECT! the skin did stick to the grill, but it was kind of nice because it took the skin off for us! :)

I have tried a lot of Salmon recipes since I stopped eating meat other than fish. This is by far the best recipe yet. My fifteen year old devoured it and she is not crazy about Salmon. We will be making this again. The only thing I changed was the vegetable oil; I used olive oil.

Excellent,   My husband thought it was a bit strong after 5 hours of marination.   So for him I'd either cut down the time or the amount of marination.   My teenage son and I loved it.   Also very easy to do with ingredients readily on hand.

Looks too easy to be true, but this is the best salmon I have ever had. Even  my daughter, who doesn't like fish, loved it!! We only marinated it for an hour, and it was still fabulous. Make extra fish and turn leftovers into an asian stir fry or salad. Wow!

I agree with others who said no flavor.  Came out bland.  I added a ton of other ingredients before throwing the salmon on the grill...

Not enough flavor.  I  tried adding diced garlic to the marinade but no joy.

Very easy to make and deliciously healthy! I put it in the marinade right after i got off work then got a bunch of things done around the house. Then 2 hours later, just through it on the grill for 10 minutes (I cook it a little hotter because i like the crispy blackened edges) and it was ready to go! So easy and health for the busy people who dont think they have enough time to cook healthy. :)

We've made this a couple of times.  Keep the fish in larger pieces for ease of grilling and the trick of putting skin side up first makes it so much easier!

Made this tonight for dinner. Husband and I really enjoyed it. I followed the receipe although as suggested, I made made foil packets to steam the salmon. I baked at 425 degrees for 30 minutes. I also made extra sauce and thickened it by adding flour. Would definately make this recipe again. Thanks.

Wow! this is amazing, so fast to make and everyone LOVED it.  I used low sodium soy sauce and it was perfect. Even my fussy 10 year old ate every bite, I can't believe how simple and tasty this receipe is.

Made this for our Christmas dinner, and everyone loved it!  I marinated it in the soy sauce, sugar, oil and water for an hour or so, then it sat for about half an hour (while we grilled the steaks) and I added  pepper, garlic salt and lemon juice at that point.  We used foil on the grill.

This was very yummy, but I was hoping for a bit more flavor explosion I think.  If I make again, I will try marinating for even longer to see if that helps.

Living in Alaska we get a lot of salmon. Unfortunately my husband is not a huge fan, he'll eat it but doesn't love it- until this recipe! Absolutely the best hands down! I can't say enough good about it! Important to not overcook as is always the case with any fish, Enjoy!!

Great recipe!  I'm not a big fish eater, and I really enjoyed this.  My kids even liked it.  I wrapped it in foil packets and baked in the oven at 450 for 13 minutes then unwrapped them sprinkled a little brown sugar over the top and broiled for couple minutes.   Only thing I will do different next time is save a little of the marinade and drizzle over the top when its all done cooking.

This was amazing!  I like fish, but for those who don't, it really doesn't have that "fishy" taste to it.  It actually kind of reminded me of grilled chicken.  My only complaint is trying to eat around all the miniature bones, but that's a salmon issue... not the recipe's!

Didn't have time to marinade, so we brushed it on instead.  Made a mess on the aluminum foil that was spread out over the grill grate, but still had a good taste, but not as strong as if it were marinaded.  Great compliment to salmon's flavor.

Superb salmon recipe. I took the advice of another reviewer and baked it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes instead of grilling. Will definitely make again!

Simply too much soy flavor.  It absolutely overwhelmed the other flavors.  And too salty even though I used a reduced sodium soy sauce.  I will not bother to make this again.

I loved the marinade, but the salmon came out dry and I had to add more soy sauce after I served it. After I added more sauce it was delicious and everyone agreed. Thanks.

Best salmon I've ever had.  My husband and mother who both do not like salmon, loved this salmon & have requested it!  I marinate overnight, and grilled on a pan, pouring some leftover marinade on while grilling.

Very good, and outstanding recipe. Very easy to make. I grilled my salmon on the irons first for about 5mins on both sides, then place the salmons in a pan on the grill. Pour some of the marinade in the pan while on the grill. End result perfection.

This was the first recipe I used to cook salmon, of which I've never been a big fan, but this is outstanding! It really doesn't need lemon pepper or salt. After only 2 hrs marinating it's perfect. I've also boiled the marinade and served it over the fish and rice- so delicious! Much better than paying big bucks in a restaurant for this quality. I will be making this for years to come!

I omitted the lemon pepper, and used olive oil in place of vegetable oil. This was very good, and oh so easy! I couldn't give it the full five since my husband claims he favors the way I usually prepare it. But this will become our #1 "grilled" recipe. (As opposed to the oven recipe I use.)

Prepared exactly as directed (except that I let it marinate a couple hours longer) and it was excellent.  This will be my salmon recipe from now on, whether grilled or baked.

Prepared exactly per the recipe and let stand overnight. Grilled in a wire grilling device for easy of turning. This is by far the best recipe I have ever had for salmon. Highly recommend.

This was very easy and very tasty.  Everyone who tried it really liked it.  No modifications to the recipe.  The next time I grill, I will put the salmon on some foil since the fish did break up on me and I lost some through the grates.

This is a great basic recipe.  I substituted maple syrup for brown sugar (skipping the water) and I used minced garlic and slivered almonds and some lime slices.  Even without marinating this was great in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes.

I've made this twice for a BBQ and I cannot believe the raves I've received for it. Marinating it as long as possible and wrapping it in foil on the grill has proved worth it for me.

One of my most dependable go-to recipes.  My wife sometimes likes me to add crushed ginger to the marinade, and I sometimes squeeze some fresh lemon juice at the end, but the original recipe is still darn good.  To get optimal results you should grill over coals, lump charcoal being my preference.  Being able to grill year-round is one of the best things about living in South Florida.  Since fish fillets tend to stick on the grill (even a well oiled one)I like to grill on a sheet of oiled aluminum foil placed right on top of the hot grate, and the salmon always turns out perfect.

i am delinitely NOT a salmon lover, but i am trying to eat it as part of a healthy diet. This is only the second time i have ever prepared salmon(i'm a new cook), but this will be my go to recipe from now on. It was fabulous! My husband and i couldn't get over how flavorful this dish is, and quite a joy to eat. I am now a salmon convert. I prepared it exactly the way the recipe stated and won't ever deviate from it. That's how good it is. Thank you.

Delicious!  My husband and I do not care for fish, but basically force ourselves and family to eat it because it is so healthy.  After making this recipe, I am actually CRAVING it and looking forward to making this again!  I did not change a thing.

Wow!! Whats a great dish! I was kinda nervous at first because my hunny doesn't care for soy sauce at all, but it had such good reviews so I decided to go ahead and give it a shot. I'm glad I did because it was perfect! We both loved it, and will definately make it again!! Thanks for the great recipe Tina!

I love this marinade.  I like salmon but I can't eat to much at one time because of the fishy flavor.  This marinade makes some of the "fishiness" subside.  My husband thought it was a little too sweet so I will add less brown sugar next time.  :)

wow this was a hit! i put it in foil and put it on the grill. when i placed it in foil, i put in about a spoonful of the sauce as well as squeezed fresh lemon over it to give it a kick. then i wrapped and put it on the grill for about 6 minutes or so without flipping. (if you flip it, the sauce might drip out of the foil) one time, i accidentally left it there  for a while and forgot but it didnt burn much, thank goodness! even with the light burn, it tasted good! haha! i also did this same recipe in the oven and it turned out great. so over the grill or in the oven, BOTH ARE GREAT! thanks for the recipe!

I used lemon juice instead of lemon pepper and I also substituted fillets with salmon steaks.    I packed it in foil packets and baked in the oven.   It was scrumptious!  To reheat it for a later meal, I put it in a frying pan and dumped the marinade over it and reduced the marinade over low heat until it was slightly syrupy.  This made is taste like a teriyaki salmon with a slight tang.  Better than regular teriyaki! Very tender and flavorful both ways. Will make again.

Fantastic! The only thing I did different was that I left the salmon marinating for around 8 hours (put it in before I left for work). And I grilled it on charcoal, indirectly, adding mesquite chips which gave it a great, smokey flavor. It was perfectly cooked in 15 minutes. It was the most flavorful salmon I've ever tasted.

Never grilled salmon before.  I followed the recipe to a 'T', marinated it for about four hours, grilled it flesh side down first, and then finished skin side down.  THIS WAS WONDERFUL!!! EVERYONE loved it...I was really impressed. We grilled it so the skin was almost black, the darker, the crispier. I never thought I'd eat salmon skin...I enjoyed it very much. Marinating it for at least a couple of hours is a must, the marinade permeates the flesh wonderfully.  This was SOOOO easy, quick to grill, and fantastic tasting.  We will definitely do it again.

Thanks Tinamenina,  Quick and easy. My wife loved it.  I used a little of the sauce to coat the fry pan which added even more flavor.  I'm going to try this on other types of fish fillets.

OMG...what a hit!  My first attempt at grilling salmon and it turned out great - made me look like a culinary super-star with the family.  Proportionatly increased the marinade to accomidate 2.5 pounds of fish. Grilled it skin side down only over low for about 15-20 minutes after marinating it overnight. YUM YUM YUM!

EXCELLENT!!! The kids and the hubbie all ate it.  My daughter started off saying that smells disgusting to taking 1/2 of a filet to taking the other 1/2 and then finally scooping every bit off of her plate.  This is most definitely a keeper.

Outstanding flavor! The only problem was that the fish completely fell apart on the grill.  :-( Next time I will try a grill basket or cage.  I used 1 T. lemon juice and freshly cracked black pepper (in place of lemon pepper seasoning) and 1/4 cup maple syrup (in place of the brown sugar).  I also scored the salmon with a knife before marinating and let it sit in the fridge for about 4 hours.  The scoring helps it pick up the flavor of the marinade in a short period of time.  YUM!

This is a super recipe.  I fixed a 1.7 pound wild Sockeye Salmon and it was great.  I marinated for about 5 hours and cooked the fish skin side down for 7 minutes, flipped and cooked an additional 6 minutes.  Served with Basmati rice, Szechuan noodles and a couple of pasta salads.  I will use this marinade many times more.

We just ate this last night and it was AMAZING!  I marinated it overnight and it was perfect.  Since my husband and I don't like salmon too much (it tends to taste too fishy), but know we should eat it for better health, this recipe  exceeded our expectations!  Definately a 'must keep' recipe!

This was a good, middle-of-the road marinade. A little sweet, a little zip, some soy sauce flavor. I didn't have lemon pepper so I added a little lime zest. It was actually pretty good.

This is as GREAT recipe!  All my family and friends that have tried this have asked for the "secret" marinade I use.  Of course I give it to them, but I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and I like it a little on the sweeter side so I increase the brown sugar.  Love it!

Absolutely LOVE this marinade!  It is truly one of the best I have ever paired with salmon for grilling.  I substituted lemon pepper with fresh lemon juice ( 1 lemon) and ground pepper.  Plus I substituted soy sauce with lite soy.  Since the marinade is so good - do not discard the extra rather put it that aside & use as a dipping sauce or pour over the salmon once it has been removed from the grill.  I paired this with rice & mixed some of the extra sauce with the rice.  A must have recipe.

Wow! My husband and I went to an upscale Japanese restaurant in Milwaukee and I swear I had this same recipe salmon--it's amazing! I followed the ingredients exactly, but changed the cooking method a bit. Since we have never properly seasoned our grill, I cooked this in a foil packet with a lot of the marinade and it was SOOO flavorful and tender. I never flipped it and it took about 15-20 minutes over med-high heat and it didn't dry out at all (I had about 1 1/2 lbs I think).

This salmon had great flavor but I can't rate it 5 stars because I'm comparing it to the Baked Salmon recipe on this site that is really out of this world. I would defintely give it a 4.5 though... I didn't time to marinate it so I placed 2 fillets in foil, combined the salt, pepper, and garlic powder and rubbed it on to the fillets. Then, I poured the marinade over the fish, sealed the foil and baked at 425 for about 20 min. The cook time was really too long (my fault - too much happening at once) but the flavor came out nice - not too over powering. Served over brown rice. I will make this again for sure, but next time will cook 15-17 min and see how that works. I also reduced some reserved marinade and pour it over the salmon and rice - that was too strong - too sweet and too salty. I wouldn't do that again.

SUPER!  The last piece of salmon I fixed was so dry that I was looking for something different to do with the other pieces.  This is the recipe!  The flavor was wonderful and it was very moist.  Will be eating salmon more often now.

This recipe is the best! We aren't big fish eaters, but I wanted to add salmon to our meals for nutrition. This blew us all away! Even my very picky 9yo son loved it and asked for more! We didn't have a grill, so I cooked it in foil packets in the oven. Worked perfectly.

My teenage boys thought it was OK. The marinade smelled good as I was preparing it so I was really looking forward to it. I  cooked it in foil packets in a 425 degree oven for 15 minutes. But it was just OK, maybe you just have to be a bigger Salmon fan then we are to appreciate it.

I used this recipe for my very first fish cooking experience--it was super easy and turned out great.  Up till a year ago, I wouldn't even eat the stuff!  I love it now, thanks to the healthy influence of my boyfriend, and this recipe will be a regular part of my rotation!

This salmon was so delicious! Excellent flavor. I thought that 1/3 cup of soy sauce would be too much sodium, so I used only half of that and olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I also would suggest using salt-free lemon pepper seasoning.  Served with baked sweet potato and steamed brocoli.

Delicious!  Cooked this for supper tonight and followed Elizabeth's suggestion to wrap it in foil and bake @ 425 for 15 minutes.  I usually always manage to overcook my salmon on the grill but it was cooked perfectly in the foil.  I also added lemon juice instead of using the lemon pepper and then just sprinkled salt, pepper and garlic powder on the marinated salmon after setting it on the foil squares.  Will definitely make this again.

Just wonderful. I followed the advice of reviewer Cyndi12 and used foil packets at 450 degrees.  We likesalmon a little on the rare side so I cooked wrapped up in packets for 7 minutes and then uncovered and cooked for 5 minutes more. I served it with asparagus cashew rice pilaf from this site which was also delicious.

This is one is great. Wonderful marinade for salmon! I also substituted olive oil for vegetable oil and it worked beautifully.  I grilled face down for 3 minutes then rotated 45 degrees to get those nice grill lines for an additional 3 minutes. When I flipped it I flipped it onto foil and pored the remaining marinade over top of  it and grilled for 7 more minutes.  When I removed from the grill the skin stuck to the foil. The salmon stakes looked and taste like something you would get at a five star restaurant. I served with wild brown rice and steamed broccoli. Actually felt healthy after we ate it. Thanks for the recipe.

I was looking for a recipe that was similar to Applebee's Grilled Salmon and this recipe is the one!  It is so good!  I would recommend marinating overnight, if possible for added flavor.  It turns out perfect every time!  You may also want to add a little liquid smoke for a smokey flavor.

This is the best Salmon dish I have ever made. It was too cold to grill so I cooked it on the stove and let it cook in the marinade.  The sugar soaks into the skin of the salmon and the taste is amazing. The coloring is also a nice brown.  Delicious!!!

This is the first salmon recipe I have ever used & I think it is incredible!  I substituted rapadura for the brown sugar & broiled it because it's not grilling season.  We will be eating salmon on a regular basis from now on ...

WOW! This was AMAZINGLY delicious! I dont make salmon that often but after making this one im already planning on stocking up on salmon. I think grilling it was the key. I sprinkled with garlic powder and lemon pepper after marinating/right before grilling. SoOoOo Good. Cant wait to make this again. One of my favorite recipes so far!

GREAT!!!!  made a few changes and loved it! Olive oil instead of vegetable added plain pepper to fish instead of kemmon pepper- then used lemon juice (1/2 fresh lemon) to liquid marinade.  a little extra brown sugar and some ginger in the marinade too.  We cooked on foil on the BBQ abnd then browned directly on the grill for a few minutes- it was amazing and evermy six year old ate it!!! will be a family regular!

Very good and very easy. I didn't have time to marinate as long as the recipe called for.  So as I was grilling (on a Foreman grill) I basted the fish several times.

BEST Recipe! My husband not a big fan of fish, since we got huge salmon from his friend, we need to cook it. So, I looked on this site, and I found this recipe. I made like twice the ingredients, I put white sugar, and still good! 

And the best thing is: I cooked it with George Foreman Grilling.. Small but powerfull!

Result: My husband ate whole fishes! I can't believe.. And he don't mind we make the same thing the next day! LOVE IT!! Thank you so much!!

Delicious marinade makes the salmon sooo flavourful.  I broiled it for 6 minutes on each side and it was sooo very yummy.

Really great recipe!  We both enjoyed it a lot. I marinated it an extra day when we decided to go out that night and it was still good; would've tasted a lot lighter following the recipe's recommended time.  Goes well with baked potato or jasmine rice and a nice salad. Will definately make this again!

This is my favorite salmon marinade, and I make it at least once a month. Fabulous. Great for use on an indoor grill, like a Foreman.

A couple of hours is all it took.  Great flavor.  Have made several times with fresh caught salmon from vacation.

Quick, easy and very delicious. What I usually do is season the salmon after marinating it w/ the soy/brown sugar mix. You can also broil it. It still taste good.

Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly. Grilled the flesh side first to form the glaze and to seal in the flavor. Loved it!

I found that this recipe really made the salmon tasty and a bit crispy.  I baked the fish in the marinade for 15 minutes covered at 350 in a preheated oven, and then put it in the broiler for five minutes at broil, uncovered w/no marinade.  A baking sheet will do, but be sure to spray the pan with Pam (the type of your choice).  This fish came out nice and flaky.  

Keep in mind that I used "light" brown sugar.  It was the only sugar in my house.  I suppose if you use regular brown sugar or honey (something I'm contemplating for a shorter trip in the broiler) the outcome might be somewhat different and a bit crispier.

Another nice thing about this recipe is that it is versatile, and allows each user to customize their own experience, by refraining from including measurements for garlic, lemon pepper, and other spices.

It was a great success.  

My only suggestion is double the recipe!

Excellent, easy recipe.  Didn't change a thing!

Updated to add that now that it's cold out, I made this again but baked it wrapped in foil at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and it was just as good.

Really enjoyed this.  I brought it to my neighbor's for dinner - we all enjoyed it.  I was afraid the marinade would be a bit too strong but it was not.  It was very nice.  I cooked the salmon steaks in the oven wrapped in foil.  Nice, moist, and yummy.

This is the absolute best recipe for salmon I have ever eaten, let alone cooked myself.  So simple, yet so delicious.  I eat alot of seafood, but normally hesitate to make it for guests just because fish is such a "love it or hate it" kind of meal.  I have made this twice now, and it was so wonderful with nice fresh thick salmon filets, that I can't wait to make it for guests.  I highly recommend it.

I used lemon juice and pepper (as suggested by another reviewer). I also used minced garlic instead of garlic powder per another reviewer. I did not add salt, as others suggested. I reduced the soy sauce in half and cut out the salt (as others suggested). I doubled this recipe as my salmon was a 2.5 lb fillet I marinated it over night and cooked it for dinner in a convection oven, sealed in aluminum foil at 400 for 25 minutes because of the thickness of my fillet. This recipe is amazingly versatile. The whole idea of contrasting the sweet and the salt for this recipe is just great and makes the fish so succulent. My husband loved it !! My son, who shys away from fish is now beginning to try it due to recipes like this !! Thanks for the submission.

This is our family favorite.  I do add about a tablespoon of rice wine vinegar (or rice wine) and 1 to 2 teaspoons of sesame oil just to make it a bit more Asian.  Regardless of whether you cook this on the grill, in the oven, on on top of the stove, you WILL be happy.

Loved this recipe! the marinade kind of threw me off at first, because it smelled pretty nasty, but it turned out oh so good! and it's so simple! If you like salmon, you will love this. I substituted the garlic powder for real garlic, and cooked it in foil at 425 in the oven for 15 minutes. Perfect! thanks for the recipe!

Used real garlic instead of powder and olive oil in place of vegetable. Marinated salmon overnight in the sauce then made foil parcels and bake for 25-30 minutes as suggested by previous reviewers. It was so good that even hubby who doesn't like salmon ate it. Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe!  It is the only one I have ever used when making salmon.  I don't have any need to find a new one!  The only thing I do different is use light sauce.  That's it.  It's perfect.  Thank you so much.

I've made this 4 times now and it was really good each time.  I first tried it as written.  This was good.  I would probably have given it 4 stars.  Then I took the tip from another reviewer and used half the oil and mandarin oranges.  I reduced the remaining marinade with some corn starch and water and used it as a sauce. Again this was good, and again I would give it 4 stars.  On the third and fourth times I took a different reviewer's tip and cut the oil to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce.  I grilled it on a cedar plank on the grill.  This was SPECTACULAR!!!  My husband hates fish and hates it when I make fish.  He told me three times that he liked it and couldn't believe he liked it.  I'm giving it 5 stars because it is such a versatile recipe and because it impressed my picky fish-hating husband.  I do recommend getting a high quality salmon and I really liked using spicy BBQ sauce.  I used Famous Dave’s Devil Spit on the fourth version and I think that was my favorite.

6/2019 - made ahead with a tsp of ginger and marinated for 3-4 hours, nice mild flavor and cooks up beautifully on the grill (cook with skin side down on foil first, then peel off skin with foil).  6/29/2008 - Eh.  This was good, very moist, tasty.  Not a LOT of flavor and I probably expected more.  Next time I think I'll use less water and oil and more of the other ingredients.  I did marinate overnight and it still didn't have a lot of punch.  Hubby thought it was great.

Easy to make with a different taste twist.  Marinated for about 6 hours and used low sodium soy sauce.  This is a keeper.  Thanks.

I eyeballed these ingredients (I had a small piece of salmon and didn't need the whole recipe) but they were a good, different flavor combination for salmon.  I really like brown sugar with salmon and this lent a nice Asian influence to my usual preparation.  I also added a little sesame oil, for a little something extra, and I'm not sure I'd do that again, I'll try it next time exactly as it is written.

The easiest, sure fire way to have GREAT tasting salmon.  I usually make a little more marinade, and put in a Ziploc bag overnight and let it marinate.  Absolutely awesome, and so easy to do!!! Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

I've used this recipes as the basis for variations. Depending  on how asiany I want to get I have substituted teriyaki sauce and added orange slices. When you do this you can halve or omit the brown sugar.

A different take on how to cook salmon than how I usually cook it. Instead of grilling, I fried it so the skin was crispy. The marinade was delicious - sweet and somewhat salty at the same time.

This salmon was DELICIOUS!  It turned out great with a sweet, not overbearing flavor.  I put it on top a ceasar salad with croutons, parmesan cheese and a lemon wedge!

d*** good salmon. I followed the advice of some others who do it in foil packets in the oven (I'm in Australia and it's winter here so no grilling outdoors!) and it was superb. I did use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. Additionally, instead of using lemon pepper I used juice of half a lemon in the marinade -- in the future I'll probably use lemon zest as well -- and then we added the juice from the other half at the table. Just so good!

I live in Alaska and we get fresh caught wild salmon all the time.  Unfortunately I hate salmon.  So I tried this marinade and boy did it do the trick.  Excellent recipe and I will definitely use it again!

You'll never want salmon any other way after trying this marinade! Only change, I always use fresh garlic instead of powdered.

This recipe was awesome. Great flavor. My husband loved it. Followed almost exactly, instead of garlic powder, I just added fresh minced garlic to the marinade. I also grilled it on a foreman grill for 7 minutes, came out perfect.

I found this very easy to prepare. And very tasty. I will try next time preparing it in the foil pouch to see the difference in taste and I would also suggest making a bit more marinade and set aside to brush on the fish as it grills.  
All in all it was a great recipes.

My husband and I really really liked this recipe. I didn't change anything, and it was basically perfect. I think next time I might add some lemon juice too, as I couldn't taste any lemon. Other than that, so great!

Wow! This recipe was awesome! I used fresh lemon slices, fresh garlic and ground black pepper and tented it in tin foil in the oven. This received rave reviews at the party I was throwing, even from the non-salmon lovers.

Made this for company & my husband who were all skeptical of the brown sugar. My husband loves salmon with butter & dill, my guests make it with soy sauce and lime. They all agreed this was the BEST! We don't give out 5 stars easily, this was well deserved, thank you! Followed recipe exactly.

I wish I could rate this dish a 10! Followed the recipe to the letter and it was GREAT. And I don't even like Salmon! My husband and friends also thought it had a wonderful flavor. I did use non stick tinfoil on the grill and it worked perfectly!!!!! 
Thanks for sharing this one!

Incredible!  Living in the Pacific NW we tend to eat a lot of seafood...I love it when I find a new recipe that tastes great and is easy.  Our neighbor gave us some fresh salmon that he had caught a couple hours befpre and I decided to BBQ it and try this recipe.  Instead of garlic powder I used fresh garlic, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  My 10 year old, who insists she hates salmon, even tried it and wanted more instead of the hot dog that I had made her...wow!  The only change I will make in the future is to marinate the fish for at least 3 - 4 hours.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I really tried to like this. I suppose I'm just not a salmon person. I took the suggestions to bake it in a foil pouch for 15 min at 425. Maybe I'll try to marinate it longer than 2 hours and grill it next time. I do feel foolish saying this- but it was just too fishy for me. Aside from baking it, I did everything according to the recipe and couldn't even finish it.

This was amazing, I use recipes off this site on a weekly basis and this is now in my top 5. It it super easy to make, if you use a ziplock bag for the marinade you dont even get more than a 1/3 cup for measuring dirty.  The marinade darkens the fish so it can be hard to tell when it is fully cooked.  I needed to cook each side for 10 minutes apiece in our gas grill

This turned out very nicely, and there was none left. My husband and I are not fish eaters, but our son loves fish and requested fish for dinner so we are trying to branch out. I thought it was too fishy for my tastes but even my husband who isn't into fish liked this dish. He did use mesquite charcoal, like usual. Both agreed they would eat this again and they liked it.

Awesome recipe!!  Very simple, but adds so much flavor.  This is the only way we eat salmon now. I omit the lemon pepper (personal preference), but it still turns out great.

Absolutely delicious!  So simple to make.  I have 8 month old twin boys and need to have recipes that take very little prep time.  This took me 5 minutes to prepare and then I put it in the oven in a foil packet as another reviewer suggested.  Served it with couscous and it was a huge hit.  I even gave some to the twins - their first taste of fish was a huge hit!

I bought my husband a Showtime Rotisserie for Christmas so when I saw the review that someone had used their rotisserie, I knew we had to try it. Also, from another review, I used the 1/3 c. lemon juice and 1/4 t. pepper. The salmon turned out awesome! It was very moist on the inside and a slightly crunchy outside.

Amazing recipe. i tried this a few minutes after first reading it. I however wasn't a fan of lemon pepper, so I substituted ground ginger and black pepper to taste. It comes out as a much more Asian tasting salmon fillet and is absolutely "to die for". Both ways is fantastic, 5 stars :)

I am fairly new to cooking, and this recipe was easy, fairly fast and delicious! I found the review that said to put it in foil to be very helpful. I also tried that and it helped to keep a lot of the flavor in. Great recipe!

Absolutely the BEST Salmon recipe ever!  I have loads of Kokanee Salmon that my husband keeps on catching, and I was looking for a delicious recipe that we wouldn't tire of - this is it!  Even great cold the next day.  Kokanee are small and sweet, so I turned my grill pan to Medium High and grilled the filets, flesh side down first, for 3 minutes per side.  They turned out perfect, and even a guest who doesn't eat fish liked this Salmon.  Truly an awesome recipe that I have had to share several times!  Thanks so much!

Great taste. Wonderful. Sear the non scale side first, then turn. It locks in the taste. Cook longer on scale side down and tent with a piece of foil to complete cooking time. The foil tent insures it is done and helps it stay moist. When I removed it from large grill pan on top of my stove the scale side stayed on the grill pan the the fish was removed easily. Looked like something from an upscale resturant.

This turned out great!  Gives any strong flavored fish a sweet, oriental taste.  I also followed the advice of using aluminum foil pockets, which cooked the whiting to perfection.  Thank you!

I have never cooked salmon a day in my life, even though I love to order it in restaurants.  I followed this recipe to a tee and viola, I had salmon that tasted better than anything I had ever ordered.  Delicious and simple, definately a keeper!

This salmon is great.  Even my boyfriend who doesn't really like salmon loved this.  I didn't have garlic powder so I used a garlic press to add garlic into the marinade.  I grilled it on my stove top.  I spooned some marinade on top.  Because of the sugar, it caramelized a bit and put a slight crispy coating on the top of the salmon.  Really good.  This is a keeper recipe.  
Thanks for sharing

Excellent.  Replaced lemon pepper with fresh lemon juice and ground pepper.  Seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder again after removing from marinade.  Cooked marinade down to sauce, but really didn't need it.

Loved the taste!  I used splenda brown sugar mix, lite soy sauce, and less oil to make it healthier.  I also cooked the salmon in a foil packet in my toaster oven for fast and easy clean-up--425 degrees for 15 minutes but watch it closely since the cook time depends on the thickness of the salmon.  Will definitely make again.

This was my 1st time ever cooking any type of fish (I haven't been cooking very long!). I made it for Valentine's Day dinner and It was SO easy and DELICIOUS! My husband loved it, too, and he's not a huge fan of salmon. I am eating leftovers as I type this, and they are great, too! I will definitely be making this again.

I followed some of the reviews and didn't add nearly as much soy sauce.  I did decrease the brown sugar too since I didn't want it to be too sweet.  I baked the salmon in foil packets as also was suggested, but I think this would be the best on the grill.  Mine is out of commission so I had to bake it.  It was still VERY good and I will make it again.  My 4 and 5 year olds liked it too so that is an added bonus.

My husband asked "what did you do different to the salmon?" when we ate this for dinner, LOL, and he really liked it. I cut the soy sauce to about 1/4 cup, used 2 Tbsp of lemon juice instead of lemon pepper and added brown sugar to taste, between 1/3 and 1/2 cup. I let it marinate overnight, baked it for about 15 minutes and then broiled it for a few more minutes. Be careful broiling though, because the sugar will burn quickly. The salmon had an almost teriyaki taste, but much better. I will definitely be making this one again.

This was AWESOME!  I did the 1/3 cup of lemon and 1/4 tsp of fresh ground pepper (not the lemon pepper) and used kosher salt marinaded it for 2 hrs and cooked it on a grill pan.  I am  going to marinade one for 24 hrs to see how well that turns out.

One word: Yum! We are not fish fans around here but we are trying to add it to our diets. This is a phenomenal recipe! I only had time to marinate it for an hour and it was still delicious. The only changes I made was to use lemon juice instead of lemon pepper(didn't have any) and I baked it at 450 for 15 minutes in foil pouches at the suggestion of another reviewer. Also made a sauce out of the extra marinade I made, also at the suggestion of another reviewer. It was a great decision. I served the salmon over arugula with garlic-steamed asparagus and Parmesan risotto. It is definitely a meal worthy of serving to guests. Thanks!

This was so easy and I put them in the foil packets and did them in the oven. Be sure to adjust your cooking time depending on how thick the salmon fillets are. I also sliced a lime up and put a layer below and above the fish when I cooked it, it went over very well!

My husband and kids said this needs to go in the every other night recipe rotation! I did marinate it overnight and cooked in the aluminum foil packets.  It did take a little longer - not sure if that was because of high altitude (Cooking in Colorado) or what.  Cooked at 425 for about 25 minutes which seems long but the packets were not ready before that. Enjoy - this is a keeper.

Thank you soooo much for this great recipe. I love salmon as it is but this recipe is very good. My husband is picky about "fishy" tasting fish, and he wont eat salmon any other way now. This salmon always turns out soooo good made this way!

I didn't have lemon pepper, so I used McCormick's Lemon Herb seasoning instead and marinated the fish overnight.  Also, it was raining, so I broiled these for about 20 minutes in my oven and they were fantastic.  My husband could not stop complimenting me on his meal!

We loved this recipe!  I made it using the modifications suggested by another reviewer - sub olive oil, fresh garlic, pepper and lemon juice for cooking oil, lemon pepper and garlic salt.  Also, cut down soy sauce to 1/4 c.  I also wrapped each fillet in aluminum foil with a tbls of marinade and grilled for about 20 minutes.  Delicious!

fantastic! I put this in the oven and it turned out great. Served with a side of wild rice, it makes an excellent meal.
To give it a little extra, I substituted the veg. oil with olive oil and a little bit of sesame oil (which tasted great in this dish).

So very very yummy. I smothered the salmon in the left over marinade as it cook adding some additional flavor that was loved by all. I will definitely be making this one again.

As far as a marinade goes it was just ok for me. It was very simple which was nice. I really like salmon so it still tasted good but the marinade didn't seem to leave much flavor on the salmon. I left it on for the 2+ hrs recommended and cooked it on my George Foreman grill. It was just so-so.

This is the best salmon recipe.  I don't like fish but my husband loves it so I have tried to find some way to make it taste better and this is it.  I actually enjoy eating salmon when I make it this way. I always put it in tinfoil for and easy clean up.  Great recipe.

Fantastic simple recipe!! Just had it tonight for my birthday...A SMASH!! I'm the BBQer in the family. I used 1.5 lbs and there was plenty of juice to cover it. Instead of lemon pepper I used fresh cracked pepper and a fresh lemon. I cracked the pepper over the salmon after i put the juice of 1 lemon over it and let it sit for about 20 minutes. I put a medium sized garlic clove, chopped finely, instead of garlic powder and the zest of 2 lemons  in the soy sause mix along with the garlic for about 20 minutes to meld everything together. I let it marinate for only about an hour but it still turned out great! The next time I do this one (and I will), I will use a little less brown sugar. It was fairly sweet. The burst of lemon from the zest was a fantastic little surprise as well. A+ Cook on a medium low setting... P.S. a turnable vegetable basket makes the turning super simple..no fish through the grill and super easy clean up.

OH.  My.  GOD.  This is phenomenal, and so easy!!!  You don't even have to pre-season the salmon beforehand, the marinade itself is so flavorful!  Also, this marinade works well with chicken and pork too!  My all time favorite Allrecipes recipe!!!

My god is this good.  Perfect compliment to the salmon.  It doesn't overpower which is key for me.  I actually like the taste of salmon and in many recipes the marinade takes over the fish.  Not this time!  Perfect.  My husband requests this once a week, and could it be any easier to make?  If you don't like salmon you may want to find a more powerful marinande.

This recipe is awesome!!!  It is quick and so easy to make.  I used my GF grill and it turned out great.  My husband and my five year old who usually will not eat Salmon were asking for second helpings. I will be using this recipe often.

My family and friends loved this recipe, but I didn't think much of it.  I thought it was very boring in taste and I even marinated the fillets for nine hours.  I added garlic and fresh green onion from my garden to jazz it up, but it was still bland (at least in my opinion).  I'll stick to Yoshita's Gourmet Sauce for teriyaki flavor from now on.

I cook fresh salmon often (I never use frozen), but had never used suugar in a marinade.  This recipe turned out really well.  It was delicious done on the BBQ.  For a little more Asian touch, try sesame oil instead of vegetable oil.

Absolutely delicious, flavorful yet not over powering. I did let it marinate over night.  (used wild salmon filet with the skin) cooked in a basket on the grill. I served the salmon with summer squash that were sauteed with butter,onions,salt, pepper and when finished added bacon bits and parm cheese.  Also had some creamy horseradish on the side to dip in.  Pickled beets, cottage cheese, salad and a glass of wine!
I am going to make the marinate and put the fish in a small pan, freeze with marinate and then vacuum seal it.  Ready for the grill.

OMG~ I have just started in the last few years becoming a fish freak, but I still have yet to really love the "salmon" type fish other than "steelhead" which was my favorite until last night when I made this with Copper River Salmon.  So delicious I will be craving this often!  My 8 yr old son and his friend and my husband all loved this.  I'm afraid after trying this that I won't experiment with all the other salmon recipes on this site but who cares!!! You won't be dissapointed even if you're not a big fish fan!

This is a great marinade! We are trying it again tonight because we liked it so well the first time. Very easy to make. I like that it is a one hour marinade. Long enough to flavor the fish but not overwelm it.

This marinade is FANTASTIC!!  I made it awhile back and am making it again tonight.  The leftovers also are great for making salmon patties!  Added a dash of cracked red pepper, a few squirts of lemon juice (didn't have powder), fresh garlic and powder in combination (love garlic!) and used a combination of vegetable, olive, and sesame oils.  Didn't need to add any salt, the soy sauce was enough.  Mmm mmm mmm!

This is the best Salmon I have had so far.  I used Splenda instead of brown sugar to cut down on calories. Perfect blend of flavors.

I let this marinate for about 6 hours, I don't think it was enough. I will make this again but I will let it marinate overnight  to really  absorb more flavor. Still a nice easy way to prepare salmon.

Best marinade yet -- perfectly balanced flavors!  I paired it with the japanese-style sesame green beans from this site...very nice together.  Thanks for sharing!

Maybe no oil next time? I usually don't use oil with fish cause it already has oils in it.

The best salmon recipe I have found.  I marinated them from 8 in the morning until 5 in the evening, and grilled them when my husband got home from work.  They turned out beautifully!  We will be doing the frequently during the summer grilling months!

My husband, who says he doesn't like salmon, liked this recipe.  It was quick and it was good.  I cooked it on our George Foreman grill.

Excellent recipe.  This was the first time my kids tried salmon and they gobbled it up....literally!  The only change I made was to add minced garlic to the marinade.  It really makes a difference!

My dad catches the salmon and then I prepare it. When I made this recipe for him he said that this is the best salmon recipe that I've tried yet. (And I've tried many.) I will make this over and over again exactly as the recipe said. The only exception was that I used my George Foreman grill for about 5-6 minutes.  Perfection!

Excellent. Perfect mix of sweet, sour, and salty. Simply the best way to do salmon. Easy, quick, and tasty. What more could you ask for?

We enjoyed this as the main course for our candlelight Valentine's Day dinner. Used fresh Atlantic salmon. The marinade is good, but what makes it is the lemon pepper/garlic rub. I didn't add the water to the marinade--why dilute it?

This gets a 5 star based on ease, simple ingredients and taste.  My husband raved over it.  But I have to agree the flavors mute the fish rather than enhance it.  So this will be a keeper to mix it up when we don't use our go-to lemon recipe.  I'll be trying it on chicken tonight.

The salmon was very tender but I did not think that the marinade had much flavor after it was cooked, which is why I gave this recipe 3 stars instead of 4.
Update:  Baked at 450 for 15 minutes in foil packets and it was more flavorful.  Doubled the marinade and boiled to use as a sauce.  Doubling not necessary - one batch is enough sauce.  Also, 10-12 min should be enough cooking time.

This was great!  My boyfriend said, "Wow, this is so good" at least 10 times while he was eating it!  I was only able to marinate this for a little over an hour and should have probably marinated this 2 hrs +.  The taste was still great, but I think by marinading this just a another hour longer, the flavor would have been a bit stronger.  Either way, I'm making this again next week.. and I am looking forward to it again!

Well, we're split on this one-Hubby loved it, I wasn't impressed. Kinda salty, but that could be the quality of the fish. I think I prefer Salmon of the cream sauce variety

My husband made this when we had company over.  He doesn't like salmon usually.  Everyone loved it, and he could not stop bragging about what a good job he did.  The marinade reminds me of something you would use for smoked fish.

I had some fairly inexpensive 5 oz. salmon steaks that I bought; the first ones I prepared were pretty "fishy" tasting but I used this marinade the second time and have to say that it eliminated any "fishy" taste.  Delicious. Will use again.

This was delicious. We had fallen in a rut of always doing Salmon with Irish Butter Sauce, so this was a very  healthful alternative. I could only marinate it for an hour, so I made efforts to baste the salmon in its own juices while cooking. I baked it first and then finished it off under the broiler for that beautiful crust. We loved it. Will make many more times.

Loved it! The grill wasn't working though, so I let it broil on low in the oven for 8 minutes on one side, flipped it, took the skin off, and let it cook for 5 minutes after that. It turned out great! Everyone really loved it. Thanks for this awesome, yet easy recipe!

Made this dish tonight!  My husband really liked it, but I was thought the mustard was a bit strong.  I took someone else's suggestion and broiled it at the end.  Will make again but I will lighten up on the mustard.

This is amazing!!  My husband loved it and he doesn´t normally like seafood.  Asked for a second helping!  My mother-in-law loved it too and asked for the recipe.  I found ou she made it the next night!  I added fresh lemon slices into the marinade instead of lemon pepper.  Delicious!!

Tried this recipe on the first go of cooking salmon. It was delicious. Pan fried it instead of grilled with a little peanut oil and came out tasting like we bought it from a restaurant! YUM!

This was really yummy. I didn't have lemon pepper so I seasoned this with salt, pepper, garlic powder and lemon zest. I hit it with a little fresh lemon juice when it came off the grill and it was really good!

So yummy!  I highly recommend you grill your salmon on a cedar plank!  You can get one at most grocery stores at the meat department.  Just ask.  The flavor is soooo nice!  

I ran out of time and only marinated my salmon for 20 minutes.  I think longer would have been better, but it was wonderfully delicious nonetheless!

This recipe was good, not the best salmon I've had. I found it a bit too salty and oily if I make it again I don't think it needs all that oil.

Nothing wrong with this recipe, I just prefer tasting the full flavour of the salmon..and soy sauce covers that up a bit. Others will like this recipe though, completely edible....especially if you don't love salmon I think this would be a good recipe....I probably don't like it that much because I think salmon is at it's best cooked plain  with a lemon wedge.

I cheated: didn't marinate due to lack of time, and used the oven instead, but it still turned out well.  My fiancee wasn't a fan of salmon, but he loved this.  Will make again.

Quick and easy but not as much flavor as I expected.  I used OJ instead of water but will likely switch to olive oil and add garlic the next time I make it and try to marinade more than four hours.

This was good. The mariande would probably taste really good on chicken too. Something different then just putting lemon-pepper on the fish. Thanks for the recipe.

It was a very good recipe. It wasn't the best salmon I ever had for the preparation time; it seemed the soy may have drowned out the rest of the flavors a bit. However, it was very good, and I will definitely make it again!

This is a very good recipe.  My kids, 17, 14, and 9 do not like salmon but when I made this they keep asking for more.  I usually make 6 salmon steaks, tonight they asked me to make nine so there could be more.

I don't like salmon but am trying to eat heart-healthy so decided I needed to eat fish.  This recipe was quite good!  I used teriyaki marinade instead of soy sauce and brown sugar and subbed olive oil for vegetable oil.  We liked it!  Will undoubtedly have this again!

Man, this is so good!!! My family and I loved the tenderness and how moist the fish was right after it was done on the grill! You could definatly taste the difference with baking and grilling. From now on, I am always going to grill my fish. I made two adjustments to the marinade. Instead of using lemon pepper, I used freshly squeezed lemon juice instead. I also skipped the brown sugar, and added some spices and herbs instead. Came out great!

I had salmon with skinned back.  I marinated this for 4 hours and grilled it face down and flipped for 2 minutes with the skin still on.  The meat was so moist and flavorable.  Thanks for a great recipe~!

I think this recipe is excellent especially considering it includes ingredients most cooks will have already stocked in their pantry!  I made it on my Foreman and in 5 minutes I had delicious, moist salmon.  I sprinkled mine with toasted sesame seeds right before grilling as well as chopped shallots and it was so good.
Quite tasty with the broccolini with ginger aioli that is also on this site.
Reminds me of a similar recipe my mother had for chicken wings.  (I'm actually using the same marinade tonight for chicken breasts.)

This is delicious.  I've made this so many times now, I don't even measure.  I just toss together olive oil, brown sugar, chopped garlic, and soy sauce for the marinade.  So moist!
Thanks Tina

Very easy and fabulous.  I followed the advice of other reviewers - saved leftover marinade, boiled to reduce and added cornstarch to thicken.  The salmon was delicious and the marinade made an excellent dipping sauce.  Even people who don't usually like salmon loved it.

This was absolutely the best salmon we have ever had and we both have had a lot of salmon. We left out the soy sauce because there was none on hand, but it was still spectaculiar. I made double the amount I thouhgt my family would eat, but it is all gone.

Love, love, LOVE this!!! I've made it many times since finding this recipe, however, I've never added the lemon pepper (only because I've never had it in my cupboard). I've also used it on pork. Yummy!! Thanks!

Try letting the salmon marinade overnight... it'll be unbelievable the next day. Also, make sure the brown sugar doesn't get onto the pan or it will burn into a sticky mess

My hubby grilled this for us this past weekend and it turned out very nice.  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly except for maybe cutting back a bit on the oil.  We thought it was great with a little lemon squeezed on it after cooking.

This was delicious!  I baked the salmon filets and it turned out fantastic.  I heated up the left over marinade over low heat to reduce and poured over the cooked salmon.  Served w/the Wasabi Mashed Potatoes from this site and it was a hit w/our guests.

FANTASTIC!  My husband and I are trying to be salmon eaters, and this recipe did the trick!  The flavor of the marinade was perfect.  The only thing I did differently was to grill it skin side down only.  It turned out perfect, and the skin came right off.

This is an unbelievably great recipe.  I don't especially care for salmon (or fish in general), but this recipe makes it more than palatable.  It almost makes it "candied" salmon...sort of crusty on the outside, moist and flavorful on the inside. Much better when actually grilled. I tried it with chicken and pork..also very good.

I don't like fish or any other seafood besides fishsticks, but I'm trying to eat healthier and salmon is one of the 14 superfoods I'm trying to add to my diet. The reason I don't like salmon is because it has a "fishy" taste to it, but once I was served smoked salmon and the fishy taste was absent. So I added 2 tsp. of liquid smoke to the recipe and then cooked the salmon on my George Foreman grill for 6 minutes and it came out wonderful. The liquid smoke eliminated the fishy taste and I loved it. So if anyone out there doesn't like seafood because of the fishy taste, then just add some liquid smoke and you'll love it. I even went back for seconds and will be making it again tonight for my boyfriend who says I never cook. Yum.

I made this tonight and it was fantastic!!! If I watching my portion size I would have ate the whole thing. My husband also loved the fish. In fact tomorrow I am going to get more salmon. I follow some of the user's ideas such as 1/4 brown sugar, 1 tablespoon of oil and a 1/4 cup of soy sauce. I usually don't cook fish but this is my all-time favorite.

I'll preface this by saying -- I have never liked salmon.  That said, my wife loves it.  So I have been searching for a salmon recipe that would be ok for both of us.  I made it last night and will definately make it again.  I ended up leaving it in the mixture for 24 hours, not by design but because of weather.  Even still it was very good.  I've finally found a way to enjoy salmon....and my wife asked when we could have it again...so mission accomplished!

This is by far the easiest, fastest, marinate for salmon. Very good, I add a little squirt of lemon before cooking. I also broiled with this recipe.

This was so good.  I used lemon juice instead of the lemon pepper and after marinating I boiled and strained the marinade and used it as a sauce on the salmon which was served over mixed greens!  Great idea!

This recipe is excellent!  My boyfriend really doesn't like salmon much, but he actually suggested that we make this recipe again sometime soon.  Also, the salmon is really good over a mixed greens salad.  I took the leftover marinade, reduced it, and used it as a salad dressing.  The reduced marinade also works well as a sauce if the salmon is not served on a salad.

I really didn't care much for this recipe, I think that the sweetness really does not compliment the taste and texture of salmon. However, I do think that this would be great on grilled shrimp or even chicken! Not even my husband (who loves to eat anything) liked this recipe. Sorry, but just not very impressed. :(

this is SOO good! i am eating it as i write this.
i marinated it overnight and then i wrapped it in foil and cooked it over the bbq that way to keep the juices in.  very juicy and soft!!.  it has a wonderful sweet flavor to it.  mmm, this will definitly be the recipe i use for salmon from now on.

I have used a recipe similar to this for a very long time.  The only variation is I use several sprigs of fresh Rosemary, dot my salmon with butter and wrap in heavy foil.  The bottom of the fish gets crispy while the fish is nice and moist.  Remove the skin from the Salmon since it is not very tasty!!

Followed recipe exactly except reused marinade as a sauce by boiling and reducing and marinated fish for 8 hours. Very tasty and easy. I don't particularly care for salmon but thought this was good. DH LOVES salmon and thought it was excellent. Thanks for the recipe.

I dont eat salmon, but my husband does, and he absolutely loved this recipe.  After pouring over the marinade, we had to run out, so the fish marinaded for more like 24 hours.  He said it wouldn't have been as good had it marinaded for only 2 hours.   Thanks for sharing!

Great taste!!  I didn't have lemon pepper so I just squeezed some lemon and sprinkled some pepper in.  Very easy to make.  The only problem I encountered was that I didn't have a grill except for a George Foreman.  When cooking, the fish turned too brown (looked burnt) too fast because of the sugar in the marinade.  Still tasted great though!!  I highly recommend it!

Easy and delicious.  Made it for my husband(the red meat monster) - he really liked it.  I made it for my in-laws, they loved it.  We did up the grill time to at least 20 minutes (medium temperture)..could be our steak was a bit thicker than normal..it was a single 2lb piece of meat (with skin).

This is YUMMY! I used a white fish (sole) and didn't grill it, I baked it, and it was still delicious! My 7 year old son, who doesn't eat fish, ate 3 PIECES! There were no leftovers!

This was delicious.  The only thing I will do differently next time is add some minced sweet onion to the marinade.  My husband and 2 year old loved it.  I served it with Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice and grilled zuchini slices.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent... my 12 yr old who thinks the only way to eat fish is fried, couldn't get enough of this.  I am not a big salmon lover, figured I would try this recipe for something new and I'm now hooked.  I cooked this on an indoor grill and it was fabulous, now I can't wait til the snow goes away so I can try it outside!!  Thank-you for the great recipe.

This recipe was very good.  I will definitely make it again.  I did have a little trouble with getting the sauce even over the fillets but that may be because this was my first grill experience.  I do plan to try again.

It was okay, I decided to marinate a few of it in this recipe and a few just using lemon juice and lemon pepper, we preferred the old version w/the lemon juice.

This was great. The bar-b-que carmelized the sugar and gave the salmon a sweet texture. My husband loved it and he is very particular. I will definately make this again.

Awesome and simple.  Quick to throw together.  This is a recipe that you can put together quickly in the morning or early afternoon, and leave it in the fridge until you're ready to cook.  My hubby and I loved it, and have even tried the marinade on chicken and other seafood!

I'm in agreement with everyone else - this is great!  Even the ultra picky husband and three year old loved it.  We love salmon so it's good to have more than one way to prepare - especially one that will be a favorite.  Many thanks!

Very quick and easy, most ingredients you have in your pantry anyway...so no last minute rush to the store.  That's the best!  Great flavor to grilled salmon.

The marinade compliments the natural flavor of the salmon perfectly--delicious!! When grilling, I was skeptical of how it would taste, and one amazing bite later, I'm a believer!

This recipe is outstanding.  I add more brown sugar for the extra zing!  Also lemon juice and or vinger will set it off nicely.  The oil keeps the fish from sticking to the grill which is also a plus.  Thank you Tina and I will use this recipe again.

This is a delicious way to prepare salmon.  When I
grill it, I use a "Grill Buddy" (Reynolds Aluminum product of heavy duty foil that is perforated for use on grills).  No need to turn the fish, and to make it even nicer, the salmon skin sticks to the foil when being served!

This is delicous!  If you have a George Forman Cooking grill, this dish is a breeze!! 
Don't taint the amazing taste by adding any addtional falvors to the cooked Salmon like lemon or butter.  Leave it as is!

This was really good!  I marinated the salmon filet for about an hour in a zippy bag and put it on the George Foreman grill for 5 minutes.  The marinade made some nice crispy grill marks.  I did reduce the soy sauce and added some fresh lemon juice.

This is simply the BEST salmon we've ever tasted!! I marinaded ours for 24 hours, then cooked it on a George Foreman indoor grill. Outstanding- the whole family was fighting for scraps. Easy, heart-healthy, and delicious- thank you, Tina!!

Excellent... I added 1 tsp of red pepper for tang, served with fresh asparagus and Hoppin Johns by Zatarains. I baked instead of grilling at 425 degrees for 30 minutes this time. My brother is partners in EHS of Mn. and Fl. they hire managers and cooks for 4 and 5 star restuarants around the country, he wanted the recipe,as he was awestruck by the flavour. I told him to go to "allrecipes.com"

Made this for company and it was a big hit - We grilled the salmon over slow coals and hickory chips that had been soaked in water. Delicious!

I was looking for a simple easy way to fix my salmon and this was it. We don't get to eat salmon that much anymore but whenever we get lucky I always fix this recipe.

Excellant sauce.  I cooked it on tinfoil in the BBQ for less mess.  Also added fress garlic instead of powder.  Very tasty

This salmon recipe is by far the best i've tried and tasted! i substituted the brown sugar for normal white sugar and it still came out fabulous, despite marinating for about 5 hours! i also substituted garlic powder for 2 large cloves of garlic, omitting the vegetable oil completely, and added half a tablespoon of cooking Sherry, and 1 lemon (i sliced whatever i could and added the juice of the corners). the salmon was grilled with butter and put in foil packets, heated over the BBQ. FABULOUS! (we loved the marinade so much, we boiled it and served over the salmon) thanks loads for this recipe!!!

I followed the recommendation to add fresh ginger, garlic, and sesame seed oil and grilled the fillets for 6 minutes on each side. It was a big hit with the family- even a usual non salmon eater had a double helping!

Loved it!  Cooked on the grill but used foil packs so that we didn’t have to worry about flipping it and it steamed nicely in the seasonings.  Took the rest of the marinate and added a tbs of corn starch to thicken it up.   Made a nice sauce .  Made this with baked veggies and it was awesome.  My family loved it and even though I made double the recipe, they ate every bite.  Will definitely 
make again.   Thanks!

Best salmon I've ever eaten. If you want to kick it up a notch, try using hickory infused coals and/or flavorless starting fuel. in my opinion they accent this recipe perfectly.

This salmon was so tasty. I skipped on the salt on the fish since soy sauce has a lot of sodium in it. I did mine skinless on a stainless steel grill insert. Came out amazing.

Awesome recipe. Used honey and white sugar instead of brown and only marinated it for an hour. Turned out great! Used an electric grill outside and medium high heat, skin down first, then flesh side and covered it, and finished up skin side down. Will cook again.

Excellent!!  I did it on a pan.  4 minutes per side.  Next time I will reduce the sugar. Maybe because I used a low sodium soy sauce.

I have been making this for years and the only change I make is to omit the lemon pepper(personal preference), add1 tablespoon of liquid smoke  and everything else as written.   Marinated for 3 hours and baked in 450 degree  oven for 12 minutes broil for 5 minutes and make a glaze from the marinade using cornstarch. It's the only way my husband likes salmon.  Great smokey sweet flavor!

The family loved it! Good for wild salmon which can be a little dry. I didn’t have the lemon pepper so I used lemon zest, ground pepper and a little salt. I will make this again.

I have never made salmon in my life; I don't like fish. But my husband had a recent health challenge that requires a new way of eating so I decided to grill salmon. This was DELICIOUS! Huge thanks for sharing. This will definitely be made again!

I was really blown away by this recipe. I had really been craving some grilled fish, and the recipe did not disappoint. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I was not expecting the marinate to have that much flavor, but wow it did. This is going to be one of my go to recipes for salmon going forward.

Turned out amazing. I did bake it in tented foil first and then broiled it to finish it off. (took about 15 minutes to bake for my 1lbs filet)

I've made salmon with this marinade twice, wife and I absolutely love it. Very simple recipe, which makes it even better. I cooked the salmon on a wood plank which added a nice flavor to an already excellent marinade.

Loved this recipe!  I made a supplemental glaze by boiling down the marinade. I reduced it by more than half - it was fantastic!  I spooned a little on the fish when it came off the grill

No changes.  I don't care for Salmon(not my go to fish), but this was the best Salmon I've eaten.  Both at restaurants or home cooked.

This recipe produced the most flaky,  flavorful fish.   The marinade was the perfect combination of sweet and savory.   I paired it with steamed Jasmine rice and French green beans and topped it with fresh green onions.   No leftovers, so it's safe to say it was a hit.

I grilled 3 lbs and the family tore it up. There was less than 2 oz left between 2 adults, 1 teenage boy , and a 12 yr old boy.  That’s what they all shared at the end of the night was how awesome that salmon was and that I’m definitely the best cook they know. Lol

For simple & savory- this is a great option! I opted to try this outside of my favorite salmon recipe, because I wanted something “less” to really let the flavor of Alaskan salmon stand out. This didn’t disappoint! But, it also left the palate wanting a little more, so I would make a slight modification next time. I will be making this again! 

My suggestion would be to skip adding the water to the marinade, or add significantly less than called for. It was too runny, so I don’t think it did as well as a thicker marinade would have, in really coating & sticking. 

The flavor really is outstanding! I prefer ginger & lemon with many fish recipes, so I added a bit of fresh ginger flakes & a few squirts of lemon to the filets while seasoning, prior to marinade. I think it enhanced the flavor quite a bit, as the citrus penetrated what the marinade didn’t. 

The bake time always seems so short with fish! But, trust this one. 12 minutes was dang near perfect. Another 5 on broil was almost too much. I suggest checking at the 3 minute mark & turning the oven off to let it sit & cool as the broiler coils cool- evens it out very well. And I will be trying this one again! Really an easy & classic recipe for a sweet & savory salmon.

I absolutely love this recipe!! I have made it so many times, it is one of my favorite dinners. I do use Norwegian salmon, also my favorite, and cook it in the oven as others suggested then broil for 5 minutes. My mouth is watering just thinking of it,  haha!

Excellent...I didn't have lemon pepper so I added 1/4 c lemon juice. Added the garlic powder in with the liquids. Baked at 425 for 12 minutes, broiled on low for 5 minutes. Thickened leftover marinade with cornstarch paste  and served over fish.

Wow this was delicious! I added a couple drops of liquid smoke to the bag and let it marinade for 4 hours. Thank you for sharing!

Wow!! This was really good! I got lazy and didn’t feel like firing up the BBQ so I just baked uncovered at 400 in the same Pyrex dish I marinated in. 25 minutes later, I had salmon that was so tasty and moist. Even my picky 5 yr old liked it.
I made 2 ingredient changes: I didn’t have lemon pepper so I used black pepper and juice from 1 lemon. And I substituted the vegetable oil with melted butter. 
I will make this again on the grill to see which one I like better. Either way, this recipe is a keeper !

This is the first time I've ever used this recipe. Since I didn't have lemon pepper, I used a TBS of lemon zest and a pinch of white pepper. I love garlic so I minced a TBS and used just a pinch of garlic powder. I like sea salt and olive oil, so I used these ingredients and dark brown sugar, and low sodium soy sauce as well. My husband bbq'd it on a cedar plank and we loved it! We'll be using this marinade recipe for many years to come.

I will definitely make it again. I added a little red pepper and sesame oil to it for I pretty much always add red pepper to whatever I'm making and sesame oil just seemed right. ??

A very excellent and easy way to marinate salmon!  Substituted a tablespoon of lemon juice and  a half teaspoon of pepper for lemon pepper, otherwise followed the recipe as given and turned out great.  Thanks!

Fantastic recipe. Fam wants me to cook the marinade and have it as a sauce next time after allowing the fish to marinate. Kept ours in the sauce for 8 hours. DELISH.

Yuuuummmm! This was so good. I didn’t have time to marinate so I just basted when it was halfway through cooking and squeezed a tiny bit of lemon juice on the fish when I was done. I really liked this and so did my dad.

This salmon was top notch. Absolutely delicious!  Easy to prepare and better tasting than any I’ve had in restaurants. I served it with dill dip on top, grilled asparagus and baked potato. Fine dining at home. If you like salmon, you will love this recipe. Loraine

The family LOVED this!  I followed Elizabeth's advice and cooked it in a foil packet in my oven instead of firing up the grill.  It turned out beautifully!  Full of flavor and moistness!  We will definitely be having this again!

This recipe is so easy and yummy. I don't grill it but cook it in a cast iron pan for the stated time. I drizzle real maple syrup on each side while its cooking. Serve with flavored mashed tators and fresh green beans. Perfect dinner that my family loves

I cooked the salmon on the stove using a grill pan, which works just as good as grilling it on an outdoor grill. Using medium heat, I placed the salmon in the pan with all of the marinade and brought it to a boil letting it soak up the marinade for 1-2 minutes. Then I poured the marinade out and continued to grill the salmon 6-8 minutes per side. The salmon comes out very moist and tasty!

Family loved this!  We grilled this on a Cedar Plank in our Green Egg to give it a smoky flavor!  Will marinate longer than an hour next time to get more of the yummy flavor.

Just made this and followed exactly except I did not have garlic salt so I did a pinch of kosher salt. Fantastic! I followed other reviewer’s suggestion and reduced the marinade with a little cornstarch and drizzled it over the top of the salmon once it was out of the oven. That took it to the next level.

So, as usual, I didn't plan ahead much so I didn't have two hours to marinate.  So... I took my 15 minutes as I prepared everything else (heating grill and making salad) and then I put the salmon in a little aluminum foil packet and threw that on the grill with quite a bit of the marinade.  Well, it turned much more like a poached salmon but the flavors were delicious.  Oh and I don't measure too much either so I know that I didn't use the full amount of brown sugar- maybe a couple of tablespoons until I thought it tasted good and then I put it over the fish.  Will definitely use this again.

Wow!!  What a great recipe!  My boyfriend doesn’t even like salmon typically and he thought this was amazing.  Had some sautéed garlic spinach on the side.  Perfect summer meal! made a salmon salad with the leftovers for lunch the next day with some mayo and Siracha.  Sooo yummy!

I would rate this a 4-star recipe if it were not too sweet for my tastes. I'm keeping it in my rotation and reducing the sugar by 1/3rd.

Fantastic! I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe. I cedar plank grilled a 2 1/2 lb. salmon fillet hoping for leftovers and my 13 year old son ate it all on me a couldn't stop saying how good it was.

I grilled the salmon on cedar plank soaked in dry wine. The other 3 who had it said it was fine, but I think it is too sweet. I recommend removing the sugar or trying a different recipe.

I used real maple syrup in place of brown sugar. (I was out of brown sugar.) So glad I made that decision. Brown sugar would make it too sweet. I also added olive oil, lemon juice and balsamic vinegar to the marinade.  No water. Be careful not to overcook it. Better to have it a bit underdone. You can heat it up in the micro for one minute. Perfecto!

I don't even feel like it has to marinade (at least not for long).  I just make sure plenty of the marinade goes on the grill with the salmon, and finds it brings plenty of flavor.

Had a little bit thicker fillet which meant ten minutes per side but came out great both of my girls finished their salmon. Definitely a keeper!!

No time to Marinate. I made the sauce in a saucepan, added about 1/2 tsp ginger. Boiled it and then added some cornstarch and made a very thick glaze.  Baked my 1 lb. filet for 12 min, put on the glaze and broiled on high for about 1 min, till glaze stared to bubble. The taste was wonderful, my husband loved it. I was able to save enough sauce for another meal.

I love salmon to begin with. But the salty ness of the soy sauce and sweetness of the brown sugar was amazing! I’m glad to have found this. Salmon also tastes really good baked with this recipe

Wow!  What an easy recipe.  And delicious.  I don’t have a grill so I broiled the fish in my toaster oven and it came out perfectly cooked.  Also rubbed a little plain greek yogurt on top to keep the fish moist before putting it in the toaster oven.  I would have taken a picture but was too busy eating the finished product.

This was excellent.  I didn't marinate for the full 2 hours as I didn't have time.  I gave it a good 30 minutes in the fridge and grilled.  It was delicious!

I can understand why this recipe gets so many 5 stars...so good! followed exactly except browned in a cast iron skillet (way to cold outside to grill) still came out great. Love the marinade..tossed in some broccoli and added that to the skillet..

Fish turned out very moist and delicious if you wrap in foil and place in oven at 425 degrees for 15-20 min.

I made this but didn’t have the time marinate for 2 hours so I made the marinate and poured about 3/4 at the bottom of the  baking dish and the rest over top.  I baked with aluminum foil and then removed the foil the last ten minutes and it was delicious!  Thank!

I've been making a very similar recipe for many years, with the exception of adding 1/3 cup teriyaki as well as replacing garlic powder with fresh minced garlic cloves  and juice of fresh lemon instead of lemon pepper .  Broiling when unable to grill out, it also turns out wonderful.   I have made salmon lovers out of many people that were seafood haters!  Better than most high end Salmon selections at restaurants, this recipe is delicious and it's  a regular in my rotation!  Great leftover too! (if you have any!!)

This was an easy recipe.  I used what I had in the kitchen, soy, olive oil, water and brown  sugar. Wrapped in foil and cooked for a ounce 25 minutes. Cooked perfectly. With more prep next time I will marinate

I can see how others could like this recipe. For me it was too salty and sweet even though I cut down on the soysauce like another reviewer had suggested.

Delicious, “like butter.”  Alterations :  1. fresh lemon zest and black pepper instead of dried lemon pepper seasoning.  2. honey instead of brown sugar. 3. wrapped in a foil packet and baked at 425 degrees for 15-23 min.

I reduced the H2O to 1/4-cup, so my blend was 1/3 C soy sc, 1/3 C brown sugar, & 1/4-C each of water & EVOO.
I also used the juice of 1/4 lemon, rather than zest the waxed peel.

I pan-sautéed the filets, as it was raining heavily, & grilling fish while holding an umbrella is awkward, at best.  :—))

Great taste, nice & moist - not too sweet, a little tangy.
Yum!

This is my go-to recipe for salmon and a quick weeknight meal. Occasionally I add a little ginger to the marinade but it's great as is, too.  I usually bake it, covered and in the marinade, at 425 for about 12 minutes then take it out of the dish and broil for a few more minutes. Even my kids love it! I serve it with jasmine rice and a veggie.

I followed the directions but, I think I should’ve allowed it to marinate more than two hours.  I do not feel the flavors were strong enough.  Will make again.

Delish thanks for sharing! I actually haven't marinated it I just make the sauce a lil less oil, marinate it for about 15-30 depending on how much time I have and then bake it with the sauce poured over it.  Turns out yummy still bit I do want to try marinating it as the recipe suggests.  The brown sugar does end up burning so maybe marinating it will prevent that.

I’ve made this many times. Outside & indoor grills & it is good every time! My husband (who is not a fish eater) loves this recipe. It cuts the “earthiness” of the salmon & has some sweet notes from the brown sugar. It is a family favorite.

I've been bbq'ing beef and chicken for years. This was the first time I bbq'd salmon, and my wife said this was the best thing I've ever bbq'd. I'm not a big fan of fish, but I liked it enough that I went back for seconds. It's easy and delicious!

Delicious! The marinade gives the salmon a great flavor.  Cooked it on the planks in the oven at 350 on the top rack for 20 min, then broiled for about one minute to glaze the tops. I placed a foil lined pan on the lower shelf to catch drippings.

This is the best salmon I’ve ever had. It’s such a simple recipe, I couldn’t believe how wonderful it tastes. I didn’t use the lemon pepper or the garlic powder. I whisked the olive oil, water and brown sugar and low sodium soy sauce together, then used a microplane zester to grate 2 cloves of garlic, a generous knob of ginger, and the zest of a lime into the mixture. I put the filets in a 9”X13” pan, put the dish in a cold oven and set it at 450 degrees. It took about 15 minutes (my filets were on the thin side). I boiled the remaining marinade and poured it over the filets, letting them rest for 2-3 minutes before serving. Delícia!!! Thank you for this recipe. I’ll be making it quite a bit!

Ok, I was looking for a new salmon marinade and this one was a hit. I used all the spices for taste and tweaked the amount of wet ingredients as I only used about 3 TBS of Olive oil, not Vegetable oil, 2 TBS of brown sugar, and approx 3-4 TBS of water and dissolved it and poured over the salmon. I chose to oven bake the salmon in foil pouches at 375 degrees for 22 minutes. It came out perfect moist and delicious! Thank you for this great recipe.

Okay, I'm a terrible cook and this turned out awesome on the first try! My whole family loved it. I cooked it exactly as the instructions say (with my poor track record, I can't afford to improvise, lol). I cooked it on the grill (medium heat). First, flesh side down for 7 minutes, then skin side down for another 7 minutes (as the reviewer from Alaska suggested), and it came out gorgeous and cooked to perfection. I also heated the left-over marinade and added 1 tablespoon of corn starch, bringing it to a boil, to make a "gravy" (as suggested by another reviewer), which also turned out delicious. Some put the gravy on their salmon. Others put it on their rice. I put it on my salmon, rice, and broccoli, it was so good. : )

this was so easy and tasty. I thought I didnt like salmon but after making this I am convinced. 
i had two frozen fillets and i cooked them in the sauce at 450 for 20 min. flaked them with a fork served over rice and spinach. one of the easiest meals. my boyfriend had a bad experience with salmon so he was hesitant to try but once he did he said "if you wouldn't have told me it was salmon I would've thought it was chicken, its bomb."

Very tasty!  I mixed exactly as written, but didn't have the time to marinate for 2 full hours. I ended up frying instead of cooking on the grill as I didn't realize we were out of gas. I cooked on medium heat for 6-7 minutes each side only and it was perfect!  Thanks for a delicious recipe!

This was a very simple recipe, and was very good!  I will definitely make this again.  We loved it!  We served it with sautéed spinach.

Seriously Good. Seriously Easy!!  I was searching for a new salmon recipe and came across this one. Wow.  Great flavor and other than the marinade wait (I let my fish sit overnight), it was very easy to make. I paired it with some grilled asparagus and home fried potatoes and the wife loved it!  I recommend making a little extra sauce for dipping or to drizzle over the salmon when serving.

It turned out great.  The fish was flaky and the flavor was delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and this is now my “go-to” grilled salmon recipe.

Made the marinade just as written and marinated salmon approximately 3 hours. The flavor was very light not overpowering. If you are looking for a more robust flavor this recipe may not be to your liking. We did grill the salmon on a gas grill at medium heat starting with skin side up for about 8 minutes then flipped over and grilled for another 8 minutes let it rest on a cover plate for another 5 minutes.

I really liked it but my family thought it was a little oily (not sure I agree with this).  The next time I will use smaller salmon filets so it is easier on the grill.

Excellent didn’t give 5 stars.  We would like to substitute garlic cloves for powder.  We gilled on slices of lemon to keep moist. Overall, excellent!

Really delicious!  I cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and left out the water.  Not sure why that's needed.  Fish actually doesn't need to marinate very long.  I marinated mine for about 45 minutes and the flavor was perfect.

I didn't use any garlic powder because my daughter is sensitive to it. I had a little more fish than called for so I added more water to the brine to cover. It turned out very well. I served it with cheesy potatoes and corn on the cob. It was a hit. I will make it again.

First time I've ever made grilled Salmon and it came out amazing! Everyone loved it. We ended up eating late so it sat in the marinade for several hours. 
Only thing I might do differently next time is a low sodium soy.

Delicious!! Some marinades are so overpowering that you can't taste the fish or meat it is on. This one is a perfect balance of salty and sweet without taking away the taste of your salmon. This one is a keeper for sure!! 
*note I did not have lemon pepper on hand so I added a splash of lemon juice and also use fresh garlic.

Pleasant, although slightly mild, flavour. Easy to adjust to your preferences though.

Amazing! So easy to make. I made it as the recipe stated. Both hubby and myself couldn't get enough. I did, however, thicken the marinade after cooking the fish. Best decision ever.

Instead of marinating the salmon, I mixed smaller amounts of the marinade ingredients and used it as a glaze throughout grilling it. I brushed it on, over the top of the dry seasonings, let it grill for 10 minutes and then brushed more on. We repeated this every 10 minutes throughout the cooking time. It saved time and kept the salmon moist during grilling. My husband said it was the best salmon he's ever had! Our kids even loved it.

My wife said it was the best salmon she had ever had.  Very simple recipe and I had never grilled salmon on the grill before.  I followed the directions and it came our great.  I did boil down the marinade down to make a glaze, I like the addition of the glaze.

Anytime you marinade in Soy Sauce and brown sugar it's going to be good.  This has become a staple for Salmon.  I add a tablespoon (min) of fresh ginger and fresh garlic into the marinade.  Also use Olive Oil vs. Veg/Can oil.  I usually forget the lemon pepper, only because I quit looking at the recipe we've made it so many times.

Excellent recipe, and grilled salmon is a perfect dish for summer--no heating up the oven inside, no standing in the heat very long, outside!  Tasty!  Thanks for the recipe.

My favorite salmon recipe by far. I made a “bowl” out of the foil and add some of the juices to each salmon “bowl”. Very juicy and delicious. Wouldn’t recommend leaving it in for more than one night... dries out the salmon.

For the first time in 5 years, I made something my husband literally would not even take more than one bite of. I made salmon the night before and everyone loved it as usual (good ol simple blackened Cajun and Boston bay rub). He got back out the leftovers tonight and left this recipe for me and the dogs. He held the leftovers under my nose and I was admittedly jealous that he got last night’s leftover salmon - first time in my life I’ve EVER been envious of leftover salmon. I ate this salmon and three of my four dogs absolutely loved it. Apparently the chihuahua and my husband were some of the few who thought this recipe was just terrible. I thought it was a 2. Edible but definitely not twice. Barring this being expensive home-made dog food, This recipe was a total fail.

This was absolutely delish! The salt is really not needed if you're on a sodium restricted diet.
I'd do this again in a heart beat. (Pun intended:^))

This salmon was delicious!!! I didn’t make lemon pepper I just used lemon juice and fresh pepper. I added about 1/2 TBS of fresh ginger. I marinated it for about 5 hours. It had a wonderful sweet flavor.

I used the foil since I skinnned it and my husband loved it! Next time I will not take the skin off and grill with the skin side down first. The flavor was wonderful!!

Made a bed of red, yellow, orange and Polana peppers (seeds remove) onions and mushrooms and fried bits; lightly braised in a fry pan to put beneath the salmon in the foil pocket

We had company over for a bbq this weekend and I needed a marinade for our salmon fillet. I found this one and I had all the ingredients on hand. Made it as is, no changes. Our company raved about it. Excellent! My new go-to.

I made this for my family.   We used the smoker instead of the oven.   We will have this one again.  It was quick and easy.    I added two tablespoons of honey to the salmon ( drizzled over the fish) when I placed it in the smoker.

Everyone loved it! My partner said he’d give it a million stars. Grilling it flesh down was they key to getting a great caramelization that really made it amazing. This was truly a simple recipe with phenomenal results!

This recipe was wonderful.  I usually use the Cedar Plank Salmon recipe, but I didn't feel like doing the work for it.  The only change I made was to add 1/3 cup of lemon juice.  I also used the "Smoking Gun" by Breville to smoke it a little more.  I am the only one in the family who eats seafood of any kind, however, my son decided to try it---he ate half of it!! I will definitely do this one again!!  I would submit a photo, but we ate it before I could take a picture.

I thought the marinade was good, but my partner thought it was too salty.  My only complaint is some of the reviews said the marinade burned off when grilling and it was really to cold to grill the evening I wanted to cook salmon, so I took the advice of some other reviews and baked it, but the oven was too hot at 425 degrees for 15 minutes, so the salmon was dry.  If you need to bake it, do so at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes depending on the thickness of the salmon.  I will try it again because it is different, but will skip adding salt since soy sauce has enough salt.

An Alaskan fisherman gave my dad this recipe about 8 years ago while he was on a fishing expedition. He passed the recipe on to me. I was thrilled to see it on Allrecipes! We've been making salmon this way every since. I used to not like salmon until I found this recipe, and now even my young children like it. The longer you marinate the salmon the better it tastes. It is truly the salmon recipe for people who don't like salmon!

This salmon is amazing! Substituted minced garlic that I pressed into the fish for garlic powder and also cooked only 4 minutes on each side instead of 6 the second time I made it cuz 6 makes it to dry.  Also cut down the oil a bit.  2 hours marinading is ok.... but if you can do 4-6 or even overnight it’s great.  Cilantro instead of parsley for sure.  Be generous with the amount of fresh lemon you squeeze on it at the end makes it so much tastier! Try with a side of balsamic brussel sprouts or asparagus and sliced avocado sprinkled with Himalayan sea salt and lemon.  YUM!

2nd time I made this, and it has been great.  Husband is a picky eater and finally got to try, since our son ate two helping the first time.  He loved it. I only get to marinade for an hour, since I make after and it comes out.

This recipe is AWESOME. I realize "how sweet" something should be is subjective, but I think Jennifer DeFosse is wrong when she says that is salmon is too sweet. I'd say to AT LEAST try it with the base recipe and adjust from there, because this recipe is awesome and worth the trouble. Not to mention easy as can be. I BBQ'd without foil and without skin it turned out perfect.

The marinade was perfect, I let the Steel Head Salmon "Skin on" sit in the refrigerator for 5 hours then baked at 425 for  20 minutes then broiled for 5 to char the skin a bit! Awesome on top of rice or as street tacos.

Put in oven 425 degrees 20 min. Used 2 tablespoons of honey. Marinated for 15 min while cooking a side dish. Still yummy!

This was delicious! I used this recipe on trout and absolutely loved it. I used the recommendation of another reviewer and baked at 425 for 15 minutes due to heavy rain outdoors. Came out very tender and flavorful.

I love this recipe! One change I have made is to forego the "Lemon pepper" and instead zest lemon and add pepper. It really makes a difference. People I know who don't like salmon, love this one!

It was the first time I  tried to cook Salmon, it came out excellent. Next time I think I'll add cayenne pepper for a little heat and see if that works. Thanks for the Great recipe.

Amazing dish!! I was so worried about it being to salty but it was perfect! I didn’t grill mine, I baked in the oven wrapped in tinfoil for about 20 mins on low heat. The salmon was so good I have family members requesting all the time!

Great marinade... salmon was perfectly done.  I was short a bit of brown sugar so I added a bit of maple syrup to compensate.  I marinated overnight and used a cedar plank in the oven as it was too cold to grill.  Lastly, I prefer Sockeye salmon...better than ordering at a quality restaurant!

My go to recipie from r salmon. Simple and taste great. I've never grilled it. Always bake in the seasoning at 375 for 20 minute. I use fresh garlic most of the time, reduce the soy and use reduced sodium, omit the water and 1 T oil.

Amazing!!!!!!! I live in Pulaski, NY. I can catch salmon literally in the creek in my backyard, however, i haven’t enjoyed salmon until I found this recipe. It is PERFECT! Restaurant quality. I thickened the leftover marinade on the stove for a little drizzle over the finished product, and served the salmon over rice pilaf with a side of grilled yellow squash and zucchini. My boyfriend said the same thing.. he has lived here all his life as well and he grew up on the salmon river... again... he didn’t think the salmon from here could taste so AMAZING!!!

As suggested by an Allrecipe user, I made foil packets for each individual salmon. That way  it can bast in its own juices. Then I open the foil packets to lightly broil the salmon to a nice golden brown --- YUMMY!

I'm a huge salmon fan.  I regulary eat it so I am a pretty tough critic.  I was looking for a recipe to replicate the sweet salmon you can buy at  the grocery store without paying the high price. I must admit, this marinade is seriously delicious and really compliments the taste of salmon so well. Why 4 stars? After marinating overnight and baking the fish in the oven (I followed other users and baked, then broiled).   Once cooked, the flavor was bland but it is my fault.  I should have boiled the marinade in a seperate pan then topped the fish before broiling.  Next time though,  I will add a bit of bourbon, use regular sodium soy sauce (I used low sodium and the fish really needed the salt), marinate overnight using an oven bag, then cook the fish in the bag with the marinade before broiling. I think that's the missing step in this recipe. I will have to make it again & update my review later.

Made this for my husband and me and will use this recipe again.  I didn't happen to have lemon pepper or garlic powder so added lemon zest. Sauce is delicious.  And leftover grilled salmon made wonderful salmon cakes for lunch the next day. Thanks.

I didn't have time to marinate the salmon for 2 hours so I only let it marinate for 15 minutes and it was still delicious!

We did not care for this. The marinade overwhelmed the flavor of the salmon. I'm going back to dill and lemon for my salmon.

I only used 1lb of salmon fillets & baked mine instead of grilled, but it still turned out great!! A tad bit too sweet for my taste but nothing that can't be adjusted for next time!

I don't have a grill so I baked mine at 425 for 15 minutes inside a foil packet, the way another reviewer suggested. It came out very nice. I am planning on making it again.

Excellent! Really enjoyed it. I did substitute lemon juice for the water. This was so tender, flaky and tasty! Grilled in a cast iron grill pan. Added marinade to second side after turning for flavor and moisture. Definitely make again! Salmon is a staple in our house.
Thanks for the recipe!

We all liked this except my 8 year old who doesn't like salmon, but he said he just liked it a little (he did eat it which says a lot). Will make it again and highly recommend it.

This was great! I have made a few times. I usually grill. 8-9 minutes or so. The longer you marinate the better. I might try making gravy out of the marinade next time. I also might try grilling in little foil packets, but I really like the taste of it straight on the grill.. have also baked these, 12 minutes in a foil covered casserole dish, then broiled for 5 minutes. (I read that the internal temp should be 140 degrees.) Still really good.

I typically make changes, but I did this recipe by the "book".  It is awesome.  My husband, who doesn't eat a lot of fish requests this on a regular basis.  This is my "go to" salmon recipe.  Love it.

No changes.  Just made it according to the recipe and it turned out beautifully.   Tried it skin side up first time and then flipped, skin side down the second time which is my usual approach.  Have to admit liked the the first result better.

It is a little sweet, but all in all very good. The only change I made was that I use a hot grill, about 400 - 450 degrees and grill it for about 3 to 4 minutes per side. As a person that lived in Alaska for 30 years I've grilled hundreds of salmon fillets and unless you have a fillet that is over 1" thick 12 to 18 minutes on the grill will leave you with dry salmon.

So good! Didn't have lemon pepper so just used lemon juice and black pepper as a substitute. Turned out great and this will now be our go-to salmon marinade.

Went to Alaska for the first time this summer and brought home some freshly caught salmon. I'd never cooked salmon before, so was unsure what to expect.  Decided to try this recipe and it is a winner!  A little sweet, a little salty, and a lot delicious!

I made the salmon for dinner tonight and my fiance said it was the best he had ever eaten. He gave it 2 thumbs up after his first bite! The only changes I made was to substitute fresh lemon juice and fresh ground pepper for the lemon pepper seasoning. I will definitely be adding this recipe to my favorites.

Outstanding. Best ever.  I did marinate for 5 hrs. Preheated grill on high for 5 minutes then turned to medium for 5 minutes. I sprayed aluminum foil shiny side up and put on the  cookie sheet, added Salmon and carried to the grill.  Pick up aluminum on each end and put on grill and grill for 7 minutes each side. Perfectly grilled with grill marks. Use pot holder to lift foil and put back on cookie sheet. No messy grill to clean or pan..

I love salmon and I am always looking for a new way to cook it.   I prepared the recipe as is and I was worried that it would be too salty, but, it was just right.   The salmon developed a nice caramelization from the brown sugar.   I didn't notice the taste of the lemon pepper seasoning at all, but, I squirted some fresh lemon juice on top after it came off the grill and it brightened the flavor.

Just grilled it today.  I marinaded a 1.5lb salmon yesterday and grilled it today.  My husband can't stop picking at it.  Salmon isn't even his favorite fish!  I didn't bother seasoning it first.  I just added everything to the marinade minus the salt (soy sauce is plenty salty) and lemon pepper (just used regular pepper).  Flipped the bag this morning to coat the other side better and volia!

Looove this recipe it's easy to make and comes out perfect every time. I did take the hint from a previous poster and cooked it in the oven. After leaving the salmon in the soy sauce-brown sugar mixture overnight or at least about 6hours, I place it in individual foil pouches with the seasoning and some of the marinade. I cook it for about 15 minutes depending on the thickness of the salmon. It came out flaky and flavorful. One of my go to recipes for salmon.

Good recipe. 
If I make it again, I would pat dry the salmon ...it was too wet. I used spray oil on my grill pan (worried the salmon would stick)and with the wet salmon, it was too much moisture. 
If you are watching your salt intake, you don't need it. The soy sauce is good flavor without. 
I also used frozen steaks and it was real good.

I'm not a huge salmon fan so I was relying on the high reviews to help me enjoy a healthy fish. Needless to say, this did not disappoint!  I found out I was fresh out of lemon pepper so I substituted for about a tablespoon of lemon juice and some black pepper.  I did everything else as suggested and it was perfect. I used a grill pan with holes in it to keep things clean and easy.  The fish had a nice grilled flavor to it which worked well with the overall taste.  This will definitely be made many more times!! I even told my husband I secretly don't like his recipe so he better use this one from now on :)

Delicious!!!! I wrapped it in  individual foil packets rubbed salmon with epicure lemon dilly seasoning and salt and then poured the marinade over fish (i didnt have 2 hrs to wait).  I cooked it on bbq for 15 mins at about 450F.  It was so good 18 mths old  and 5 year old loved it they even asked for more. Will make this again for sure!!
Side was potatos , carrots and broccoli in foil packet with butter salt and pepper on bbq for 30 mins same temp.  Delicous meal

I *hate* fish, I mean seriously hate anything that comes out of the water lol.  Our son (12 1/2) loves to cook and loves seafood (as does his dad). He made this for us, and I promised I'd try it. It was SO good!!!! (we left out the lemon pepper, mostly because we didn't have any). I finally like some fish :D.

I did not change one thing about this recipe and it turned out so very delicious!  I cooked it a little longer than indicated since I had a larger filet (2 lbs) and it was perfect!  I made it for my mom's birthday and will make it again whenever salmon goes on sale.

This recipe was good. The flavors were all there and now that I've made it once, I can make it again with a few changes that I'd love. The only thing was, I cooked this exactly as described and it burnt! I like salmon cooked thoroughly but geesh! This turned black quickly! Next time I'm going to start cooking it skin side down first ... then lower the heat when I flip it. Hopefully that works out better. The poor salmon stuck to my cast iron grill pan and I couldn't get it off! Cleaning this thing is gonna be a nightmare.

This is a great marinade for salmon. It enhances the flavor of the fish and doesn't overpower it. This is a keeper.

SO delicious! A rain storm blew in so I had to bake this in the oven, and ended up marinating it for about 6 hours. I also used 2 lbs of salmon but didn't change the quantity of the marinade. And I didn't add any oil to the marinade. It was perfect!

Delicious!  This was my first try at making salmon.  I had a piece without skin so I fried it in a cast iron skillet with a teaspoon of vegetable oil.

OMG, this was wonderful.  Turned out beautifully.  Can't wait to make again.  Have already shared the recipe.  Following others' suggestions, I used olive oil in place of vegetable oil and baked in foil pouch for 10 minutes, then broiled for 4.  Didn't have lemon pepper so mixed some pepper in lemon juice.  Also, as suggested, added corn starch to remaining marinade to thicken and poured lightly on salmon and rice pilaf.  To die for!!!  I will try just  a tad less brown sugar next time.  Thanks for this recipe.  It's a winner.

Incredible!! I added an 1/8 of a cup of fresh lemon juice to the marinade like some suggested. During the marinating, I flipped the bag about every half an hour or so. Also, brushed marinade on at the beginning of grilling and again, after flipping. This salmon was not the least bit dry, as I find in restaurants sometimes. I'm in love!!

What a great marinade! I did this with steelhead trout. Marinaded all day. The trick is not to over cook fish. Made it last weekend and turned around and bought fish for the following weekend. Will do again and I would serve to company. Also I cooked a slab of fish not small pieces.

Fantastic marinade!  I didn't add salt because the soy sauce has enough sodium in it, and it was very good.  The only thing I would do differently is to add less water - only because I used frozen salmon.   After cooking, the marinade was a little too watery, but the flavors were spot on.  Hubby is very picky about his salmon and he absolutely loved it!  He didn't even mind it being a little watery, but I did.  Will definitely make again (using less water next time).

This recipe is amazing! My kids loved it and they're not big fish eaters. I did the real lemon juice instead of the lemon pepper and it was amazing! Great with a salad or just about anything else. You have to try it!!!!

Very good, the marinade was not overwhelming.   Marinaded about 45 minutes.   More than that would be too much.  In my opinion you should never marinade Salmon more than an hour.

Best Salmon recipe we have found. Follow directions as stated. The one thing we do is wrap the fish in foil before putting it on the grill. We found that even after greasing the grill grate it would still stick. No longer a problem now. Love this recipe! Enjoy!

Made the marinade according to the recipe.  I usually get 2.5-3 pound fillets, and double or triple the amount of marinade.
Cooked over coals, on foil.
Skin side down, do not flip.  
When the meat can be flaked apart, it is done.  The skin will stick to the foil.  Less clean up afterwards.
Have made this several times, and is my go to for salmon.
Once again (every year) I made it for a golfing weekend during lent with the guys.  One told me that he does not like salmon, but that this was awesome.  Another described it as "like eating candy".
I cannot rate this high enough.

This was absolutely delish! I used fresh lemon (about half of one) and black pepper since I didn't have any lemon pepper. I also didn't add any extra salt since it was getting that from the soy sauce. I baked mine at 425 for 15 mins since I couldn't grill it, but cannot wait to try this grilled as well! Great great recipe enjoyed by the whole family!

This was phenomenal, but I made some changes. I added the lemon-pepper and garlic powder to the marinade, and because I was impatient, I only let it marinade for 45 minutes (can only imagine the flavor I would have had after 2 hours). I also sprinkled just a bit of lemon-pepper on the salmon just before cooking. Rather than grilling, I put it under the broiler for 7 minutes.

This was delicious!!! All of my kids under 7 gobbled it up and asked for seconds. The only thing I changed was to use garlic powder in lieu of garlic salt since I didn't have that ingredient. Delicious on the grill! Thanks to the reviewer who advised to grill meat side first and then flip to the skin side. It was absolutely perfect.

This recipe is amazing! I marinated it overnight and use fresh lemon, put it in the oven preheated at 450 degrees  for 15 mins and broiled 5 mins after. Served with steamed rice and vegetables.  Everyone in the family loved it, even my little ones.

While I did have a couple execution errors the flavor was wonderful!!  I made it with some grilled asparagus!!
I think my grill was too hot even at medium and the filets stuck and took some  scrapping to get off.  Gonna try again at lower heat.

This is the ONLY grilled salmon recipe I can use per my family.  It's perfect.  And to make things easy, I throw all the ingredients in a gallon zip-lock, add the fish and marinate in the fridge for 3 hours.  Perfect every single time.  Great with Tartar Sauce IV by Marlene R (allrecipes.com)  Make sure to use dill pickle in the tartar instead of sweet pickle because the salmon is slightly sweet.

Best salmon recipe I have ever used! I substituted the lemon pepper (because I didn't have any) with lemon juice and fresh ground pepper before soaking in the marinade. I also followed another users suggestion (because I'm not great with a grill) and baked the salmon in foil at 425 for 15 minutes. It turned out PERFECT! Such a hit and I can't wait to make it again.

I have used this recipe dozens of times and recently had a guest tell me this was the best salmon he had ever had.

The only things I do that are not in the recipe is to 
a) sometimes I bake it in the oven with all the marinade and then thicken the liquid with a little cornstarch at the end.
b) when grilling on the BBQ I save the marinade, boil for a minute or so and then thicken with cornstarch and pour over the salmon before serving.
The marinade is just too  good not to use!

This marinade is exceptional.  I let my salmon marinate for 24 hours and then we grilled it on a cedar plank.  Some of the best salmon I've ever had and super easy!

I liked it a lot. Cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup, however that was still too sweet for my kids. "Ewww sweet fish", that's why 4 stars.

Better then a restaurant! This marinade is really delicious and my husband and two year old absolutely loved it! I marinated the salmon in ziplock bags and put it in the fridge for 45 min ( due to time ). It was to cold to grill outside so I put them in the oven at 400 degrees for 12 minutes and then broiled it for another 4 minutes which created a beautiful top. I didn't have foil so it was placed directly on a cookie sheet and it turned out perfect!

I have made this marinade several times.  We no longer buy the Bourbon Marinaded Salmon from Publix anymore!!  This is a great marinade and the longer it sits, the better it is.  I usually let it sit overnight.  I swap EVOO for the vegetable oil and use real lemon juice, rather than the lemon pepper seasoning as I season the fish with something similar to Paula Deen's "House Seasoning."

Excellent recipe just as is. I made it for Christmas dinner for the first time and *risked* making it without any modifications. It is possibly the best salmon I have ever had. 

I marinated it overnight to save on time. I don't have a grill, so I packed in foil individually and baked in oven for about 18 minutes. I also made the gravy with the marinade as others suggested and that is what made this salmon over the top delicious! I put it to boil on the stove and added a bit of flour to thicken. It was lumpy but that was my fault. This will be my go-to meal for impressing company. Thank you for the recipe.

No changes  i did add corn starch to the marinade , as suggested by another person, to make sauce to pour over the salmon.   Absolutely the best and easiest recipe for salmon.

It turned out great.  I broiled it in my convection oven because I was worried it would fall apart on the grill.

I had no idea where to start with salmon and this was delicious the first time. I did add my own twist to this. As for substitutes I used McCormick's grill mates lemon pepper(has all of the listed seasonings in it), olive oil, and local honey. This is just what I had already available. Added some red pepper flakes too.
Cooking method: Cook skin up for ~1min. Flip meat and pour on some of the marinade. Finish the remaining cooking time. Use sharp spatula to cleanly separate meat from skin and plate it. The remaining skin was fairly easy to scrape off of the grill. 

I will be doing this again soon. Thanks!

My husband and I loved this marinade! I only let it marinade for bout 30 mins and I cooked it on the stove over medium heat 4 minutes on each side. Turned out delicious! Making my salmon this way from now on!

Pretty good. Flavor was overwhelming- good for a cheap fish or if you're looking to mask the natural flavor of the fish.   The saltiness of the soy was pretty strong, as was the sweetness of the brown sugar.  Next time, I will probably cut back on both to 1/4 cup soy, 1/8 cup brwn sgr and use lemon juice and fresh ginger as other reviewers recommended.   Also, I will use real garlic instead of garlic powder.

I baked this at 450 in foil  for 12 min then opened the foil and broiled it for 5 min. I also saved the marinade I boiled It and added some corn starch  to make a sauce then spread It over the salmon. I made all of these changes from reading other reviews.  It turned out really moist and juicy.

I used one big fillet,  about 4 in x 8 in. 2 garlic cloves, 1 shallot and about 2 tsps ginger, (who measures?!), and the directed amount also of soy sauce and olive oil. I grilled it with the marinade . It was quick, easy, flaky, juicy and delucious!! Definitely will make again!! Thanks!

I made it exactly per the recipe and it was just fabulous.  I don't like fish (of any kind) but I'm trying to eat healthier and try new things. This was absolutely divine. My 14 year old is a very infamous picky eater and rarely likes ANYTHING other than pizza or burgers...and he loved it.  Went back for seconds. That NEVER happens.  Excellent recipe!

I have tried making salmon for years and just about gave up on it. I bought more salmon only because it is good for me. I tried this recipe and wow! We will come back to this recipe time and time again. I substituted maple syrup for the brown sugar and olive oil for the vegetable oil. It was very good and everyone wanted seconds!

Let me start by saying I've never liked salmon, but decided to give this a try since I'm often on the grill and need to augment my diet with fish.  

I followed the instructions and although I didn't care for it,  my son really loved it.  The star rating is based on his assessment since he loves fish.  

I plan to try this recipe again, but next time I'll soak the salmon in milk for 20 minutes to help remove the fishy smell.  I've recently tried that with other types of fish and it works.

Pretty much followed the recipe. I did start the grilling "skin side up" and flipped it halfway through. This is definitely a "sweet" marinade. I may try some ginger in it the next time around.

We loved it! I used 1/4 cup of Lawry's lemon pepper marinade and 2 tbsp of chopped garlic instead of the powdered stuff and the lemon juice. I grilled it in my trusty cast iron grill seven minutes on each side.

This salmon is the greatest and really easy.  I sauté it rather than grilling.  We like it so well that it has become a regular on our table.  The longer it marinates, the better it is.

Absolutely loved this, and I don't like salmon at all! Will be making again,  for sure! I didn't have any garlic powder, so I used 2 cloves instead. Next time, I'll try with the powder and see if I love it the same.

Absolutely the best salmon I've ever eaten. Very easy to make, and full of flavor. I froze a few pieces, and they kept so much of their flavor. Highly suggest using this recipe.

Fabulous! Very flaky and moist. Marinate the salmon no more than 30 minutes and cooked for 8 minutes total over medium heat on grill.

My whole family loved this dish.  I coupled it with a coconut pineapple rice.  I cut down the sugar and added lemon zest from one lemon to the marinade because I had no lemon pepper.  I was very happy with the result!

Great as a broiler dish, I marinated this all day, because I hada busy day. It came out great! Even our fish hating teen loved it, and said this change his mind about looking fish that isn't frozen commercial breaded fish sticks.

I have made this several times now and it is truly the best marinade for salmon I have ever tasted. I ad onion powder to the seasonings, and only use Kingsford Applewood briquettes.
I place the fillets on canola oil sprayed non-stick aluminum foil up on the upper rack of my barbeque grill. It is excellent for Atlantic Salmon, but my absolute favorite is the sockeye salmon!

Great recipe! The marinade is sweet and flavorful, I will definitely make it again. I made a few small substitutions based on what I had: used garlic salt instead of garlic powder and added fresh lemon. I marinated the fillet for 4 hrs and baked on 425 for 10 minutes, then broiled on high for 8 minutes. Yum!

I made as is except I use a blended oil.  I baked in my toaster oven at 425 for 20 minutes, (2 filets) delish.  Excellent recipe.  Will grill next time.  Oh, I used low sodium soy, marinaded overnight.  Will make over and over.  This is my fave marinade for my salmon from now on.

I left out the garlic as we cannot eat it.  I added a touch of ginger to replace the garlic.  Next time I will cut back the sugar as it was too sweet but still had a good flavor and a nice glaze.

I had a few requirements for a salmon dinner  for a get together with friends: easy to prepare, grilling outdoors, little time away from company and delicious.  This recipe hit all my requests.  I did not have any lemon pepper so I substituted lemon thyme in its place.  I was able to prepare the salmon two hrs. ahead of time and enjoy the company of friends.  I served the salmon with a sugar pea pod/potato salad which I also made ahead of time.  Sipping on white sangria (also made ahead of time) made my entertaining fun and easy.
Oh, my company wanted the salmon recipe they liked it so much.  Thanks for the recipe, it's already saved to my favorites.

Very good. My change would be to get the grill really hot, sear for 3 minutes and then turn off and close the grill. Then let sit in grill for 10 min. Perfect.

Absolutely loved, My husband & I both. we grilled the fillets; instead of placing on an oiled  grill grate, I placed on heavy duty foil, grilled additional 2 minutes  per side....OMG, they were awesome ! Love the marinade.

DELICIOUS. Made this as directed. Cooked it on the grill on a Cookina mat which caught any excess marinade and juices  so we didn't lose any flavour and it didn't stick. I made a large portion of salmon for 4 people and we ran out, everyone went for seconds. I marinated it for 4 hours in the fridge.

I've made this three times now, my family loves it! I make the marinade exactly as stated. It tastes fantastic! I serve the fish with lemon or lime wedges. The recipe is perfect as-is. Thanks for sharing!

swapped out lemon pepper for juice of one lemon and 1/4 t pepper; used 1/4 C low sodium soy sauce; used 1 T olive oil in place of vegetable oil; used less brown sugar than recipe called for. grilled using foil packets to retain heat. served with jasmine rice and grilled asparagus - very good. will make it again!

For the first time ever my husband asked for leftovers two days in a row! He even took a piece of salmon off of my plate. It is definitely sweet so those looking for a more savory salmon might want to look elsewhere. I kept a lighter hand with the lemon pepper seasoning than I normally do when that is my main ingredient. I don't have a grill so I just Sauteed it in a pan. I plan to try it again tonight with shrimp and catfish.

Fantastic!! Delicious! Quick and easy dinner which taste amazing. The  salmon ended up marinating for 4 hours instead of 2.  I grilled the salmon non-skin side down first for 4-5 minutes I then flipped the salmon and cooked it skin side down for 2-3 minutes more. This created a sweet caramelization on the salmon that my family loved, including the 3 & 5 year old. Definitely will be adding this to our dinner rotation.

This was a great recipe.  I did add chopped garlic cloves with the marinade, rather than the powder. I liked the suggestion to grill the fish side first then the skin side. It was yummy and I will use it again. I do also always use low sodium soy sauce.

made it exactly as written. I thought it was a little too sweet but I don't tend to like sweet sauces on foods other than dessert. My family, however, loved it. I will make it again for sure, maybe throw in a few red pepper flakes to give it a little pizazz.

I marinated the fish for about 8 hours.  I saved a little of the marinade  in a separate container and  poured it on the fish right after after taking off the grill.  Best way to prepare fish ever!!

This is the best marinade for salmon EVER!  I made the marinade just as the recipe calls for but I cooked the salmon a little differently.  I grilled it on a cedar plank.  I also use Scottish Salmon when I make salmon instead of the stuff you buy at a grocery store.  I had a dinner party with 12 people the other night and everyone is still raving about it and everyone wanted the recipe.

Instead of grilling, I actually cook this on the stove top. My family, including my 80 year old father, says this is the best salmon recipe they have ever eaten!  I love this recipe because not only does it taste good, but it's simple, using ingredients I always have on hand, and very easy to make.

We had this for dinner tonight; it was delicious for husband (who doesn't love salmon), me (who does) and my 6-year-old daughter. We were only able to marinate it for half an hour, and it was still wonderful. (We'd probably try to marinate it longer next time.)

Okay so my husband keeps me away from the stove (for good reason,) but around here I pride myself on the grill skills.... I grill anything I can get my hands on and I'll say this much, I continuously come back to this recipe. It's crazy easy and CRAZY good! What JonLemire said about grilling the first side flesh down is spot on, although we prefer our salmon a bit less done so I'll usually do 6.5 min then flip skin down for 5.5 minutes. It also tastes ten times better when you leave it in the marinade a day or two to really soak in the flavor. A must try if you and your family like salmon. A++++

OMG.  Delicious.  Kids loved it too.  I didn't change anything except that I baked it at 450 for 12 minutes then broiled for 5 as suggested by someone else.   Yum.

Loved it!  Tried the trick suggested by another reviewer of starting the filets skin side down on foil.  This makes flipping much easier and the skin sticks to the foil and comes right off the meat like magic!  Flavor was just perfect for us.  Give it plenty of time to marinate; the longer, the better.

Made this last night, huge hit and very tasty.  I didn't have lemon pepper so I just used pepper plus a bit of lemon juice. Instead of grilling, I put them in individual foil packets and baked for ~18 minutes on 425.  Super flaky and kept the moisture in so they didn't get dry.  Delicious and easy.  Go to recipe for salmon in the future.

This is a good basic recipe.  Next time I would amp up the flavor with fresh garlic & ginger.  1/3 cup brown sugar is also a little much.  I'll use honey next time.

Will definitely make again - didn't even have time to marinate it the entire time.
Thanks AllRecipes !

Best salmon recipe I've come across on the web! I used Kerrygold unsalted butter instead of oil and cooked in a T-Fal non-stick pan on the stove top. I marinated the salmon for ~8 hrs in the fridge. As a side dish, I cooked a white potato in the pressure cooker, and added cracked black pepper and shredded cheddar cheese. Additionally, (as other reviewers have suggested) I poured the marinade in a small pot, added some cornstarch and water, let it cook for ~7 mins on med heat to make a gravy. The gravy was a bit oily, but still very good.

I absolutely will be making the recipe again.

I'm a beginner cook.  This recipe made me look like a bonafide chef!  Followed the directions - left it to marinate 8 hours.  Grilled directly on a lightly oiled charcoal grill grate.  It was absolutely fantastic.  Will definitely make again to impress my big sister who's visiting.  She won't believe it!!!

It lives up to its stars. Best marinade I have found thus far. My fish hating husband will now eat fish and I love it too. Score! It says to marinade for two hours but it still gives good flavor in just thirty minutes.

I used low sodium soy sauce and 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of 1/3. I think next time I will use only 1/8 cup of brown sugar, only because I prefer less sugar. I also use pickled ginger for a topping after cooking. I also cooked in my NuWave Oven instead of the grill and it still came out like it came from the grill, and that was my husbands opinion too. And it was just delicious!

Made it exactly as described with the ingredients.  First time grilling fish, and the results were beautiful.  We did reserve about a 1/4 cup of the marinade before adding the fish to use for basting during grilling.   We also followed the advice to start flesh side down, then flip and finish with the skin side down.  Worked like a charm.  Even our toddler loved it!

I made this recipe. I was looking for a sweet salmon recipe. I did not have maple syrup to make a maple salmon recipe, so I tried this one. I was pleased with the taste and my family enjoyed it, as well. I will definitely make this again. The only change I made was I added some  chopped garlic to the marinade. I did not fire up the grill, so I baked it at 450 for 12 minutes and broiled for 5 minutes (like other reviewers suggested) in the remaining sauce.

Came out really good, I would suggest to not add as much oil. 1 1\2 of olive oil should do. Really easy to make and really good taste

Delicious!  Sure winner all around.  I marinate for at least half the day and use the foil packet method in the oven as a user had recommended.  425 for 15-20 minutes.  Perfection every time. :)

Was not so keen on this recipe , found that the salmon just  kept on breaking up! next time around I will put the salmon on the b.b.q and see how that works.

Great recipe. I substituted dry white wine for the water and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Delicious!

My son and I loved it. He said we have to put it on the dinner list of things to have more often! I did add about a table spoon of garlic sauce to the marinade and it was great!

The marinade was fantastic!  I didn't plan well enough ahead to marinate for 2 hours so i did 30 minutes in the freezer and i used Elizabeth's idea about the foil packets and it came out AMAZING!!  I loved the flavor of the marinade- it wasn't overwhelming nor was it non-present.  My husband who is NOT a big fan of salmon at all loved it.  I found him in the kitchen eating it right out of the foil packet!  He said, "It's good.  Not dry at all."  Which from him is a ringing endorsement.

There is no doubt this is a good recipe.  Even my boyfriend who is new to the world of non-fried fish, and specifically salmon, really liked it.  I ended up baking it in the oven at 400 degrees for 10 minutes and then broiled it for 5 minutes.  It turned out great!  The only thing that was slightly shocking was the amount of sugar.  I think next time I'll reduce it because it seems like a lot.  I'll also make a sauce with soy sauce, a bit of brown sugar, water (or stock or orange juice), garlic, salt, pepper and cornstarch to serve over the fish.

This is hands down the best salmon recipe. Each time it turns out perfect! I sear it on both sides in a cast iron skillet then bake until it is cooked thoroughly. It is super easy but turns out five-star restaurant quality.

Absolutely amazing. I used juice from a lemon in place of lemon pepper. Also grilled skin down on aluminum foil for 8min and then flipped it over onto  hot grill for the remaining 7 minutes. The skin peeled right off, so easy. Great paired with grilled asparagus and rice pilaf.

Thank you to share this recepi. Itis easy but I've reduced the soy source about half from the reepi for the second time and it came out OK. I followed one of the suggestion to do the bake and it's good.

Not sure why but although the taste was good, the salmon really caused a lot of flames in the bbq which burned parts of it in the process. Could be the brown sugar (I only put a tablespoon though).

Lovely and delicious recipes .. My husband said " the best taste salmon ever, mixed flavours , sweet, lemon sour and tasteful ".. 
I only used 1 tbs of soy sauce, and sprinkle of brown sugar, and olive oil on the grill pan. But when i grill, i didn't waste the marinated. I use the marinate again when the fish half cooked. Grill with low heat .. And then cover it again with marinate. So all the marinate is usefull.. Use it  when you grill  the fish too.. So you can taste the flavour inside.. Mmm yum.

Not only is this simple to make but it taste great!!!! I baked them in the foil pouch instead of grilling as suggested on another review and I also put a little lemon juice in the marinade. My family could not stop raving about how good it was. Will definitely make over and over!!!

Now I know why so many have commented on this recipe. It's WONDERFUL! So simple yet so good. Restaurant quality. I marinated the salmon for about three hours. My husband, who is not a fish lover, raved about it. It doesn't get better than that!

I made as directed. The soy sauce seemed somewhat overpowering, just a tad. I like the glaze-like texture from (indoor) grilling. A couple more ingredients and this recipe could seriously be restaurant, fine dining quality. I'd give it a 4 out of five rating, as is. Perhaps I may throw in a splash of bourbon and pineapple juice and serve with grilled pineapple. 

We are a family of picky eaters!!!! So don't take this lightly when I say that I'm definitely adding this recipe to my repertoire. I would strongly encourage you to give it a try.

This was incredibly good and moist. I also added the seasonings to the liquid before I marinated for about four hours. I grilled them on my Weber on a grill mat ( a nonstick thin mat that keeps delicate things from sticking) along with some red bell pepper. I went skin side down for 7 minutes, flipped (skin stayed on the fish, which my wife loves) cooked for 6 more minutes. It came out very flavorful and uber moist and tender. A great way to cook salmon!

We eat a lot of salmon and this is one of the best recipes I've ever tried.  Two of my nephews who won't even try fish loved it.  Thank you for the great recipe.

It turned out great!!! And never thought brown sugar and soy sauce went so well with salmon! Didnt have lemon pepper so used lemon and pepper with salt! Added very little salt because of the soy sauce. Used the leftover marinade to toss over stir fried veggies!! Loved it

This recipe turned out great! I used lemon juice and pepper instead of lemon pepper seasoning and baked it on a cookie sheet uncovered at 350 for 20 minutes. Came out perfect! Paired it with roasted red potatoes and a Caesar salad. Definitely will be making this again!

This is a great starting idea for salmon. I use the ingredients listed (except the water) but in natural form. So instead of lemon pepper, use squeezed lemon and pepper, instead of garlic powder, real minced garlic, etc. I use all of these ingredients to taste and the results are fantastic. Be sure to choose salmon filets of uniform thickness so they will cook evenly, and if you don't want to grill them, put them skin side down on a prepared glass oven-proof dish 6" under the broiler, cooking until the fish flakes with a fork. Great stuff :)

This has become a favorite with my husband, who does not like fish in general. The last time I made this recipe, I decided to save the marinade and reduce it to use as a glaze - amazing!

This salmon was so amazing. Great taste and very tender...I followed another review that stated to make a foil packet and bake the salmon on 425 degrees for 15 minutes....came out amazing! Thanks for sharing and will continue to use this.

I used a cedar wood plank on the grill, so good. I also used Alaskan Salmon that we caught dip netting, that probably helped :) For real though, the glaze/marinade was very good.

I've made this many times.  It is really good.  I usually cook on grill pan inside the oven on broil.  About 6 minutes per side depending on the thickness of the salmon.  So good and really easy.

Great recipe! I replaced the water portion with lemon juice and it gave the sour and sweet favour. For the sauce mixture, i didn't throw away but thickened it with corn starch and pour over the cooked salmon if the eaters prefer more sauce.

Everyone in the house adored this dish! It was so easy to make and turned out so beautifully that I could give it no less than five stars! I will also credit Ms. Elizabeth in the comments though, as I wasn't able to grill out on the night I made this. Her suggestion of creating a foil pouch and baking each filet at 425 for 15 minutes was genius! It turned out absolutely perfect!

It has a mild yet satisfying flavour and its perfectly balanced between sweet and salty.

The longer you marinate the better the flavor. The only changes I made is instead of vegetable oil I used olive oil and placed in the oven covered for about 25 minutes. Big hit with my daughter who is a picky eater

Really good! I used about a 1/4 cup soy because that's all I had and it was fine. I baked for 12 minutes at 450° and broiled for 3-5 minutes until the tops were bubbly and caramalized with the marinade.

I had not been a big fan of salmon and was looking for different ways to cook it... I found this recipe and it has been in my regular meal rotation ever since.
This recipe is extremely simple and very tasty. I try to marinade it two hours, but sometimes I don't have time and it still tastes fabulous.

Made this yesterday, just as written. I used a 2.8 lb. slab of salmon. It turned out fantastic. Hubby isn't TOO fond of salmon but this recipe he absolutely loved!  Keeping this recipe in my rotation for sure.

One of my favorites, this turns out amazing every time! I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil and cook the salmon in the marinade so it absorbs the flavors while cooking

Amazing!  First time I made this it came out excellent!  Love the flavors, a perfect pairing with salmon.  We didn't have time to marinate for 2 hours and it was still so good!  I cheated a little by using garlic salt and lemon pepper, marinated about an hour in a skillet and cooked on the stove, covered over low-med heat about 7 minutes per side.  This is a keeper, thanks for sharing!!!

Amazing recipe! I use to hate cooking fresh salmon and opt to just cooking the tin ones. This recipe gives the salmon a great taste but also keeping the inside nice and moist.

Hi all, 
I made this salmon dish last evening. I followed it as it was written, and unfortunately found it rather dry. It was tasty as the the marinade did have a sweet/salty taste to it. I cannot really explain why the texture was not as moist as I had anticipated. I will try it again.
Thank you.

I really liked this but may use more garlic and lemon pepper next time and let the salmon marinade longer.  I grilled it as recommended, no foil, it didn't fall apart or stick to the grill and was near perfect, flaky but not dry!

Multiple substitutions made because of my dietary preference (no refined sugars and oils and gluten free)

tamari for soy sauce, 2 tbsp. lemon juice for lemon pepper, pure maple syrup for brown sugar, olive oil for vegetable oil.

and I added onion powder to taste

delicious!

Absolutely loved it. Used half the oil and less sugar. Baked in foil packets at 425 degrees for 15 minutes as someone else suggested. Then unwrapped the foil and put under the broiler for a few minutes. I only marinated it for a couple of hours but will do it overnight next time. The flavor of the marinade is so wonderful ... I couldn't get enough of it!!

Great on the grill!! Made a nice brown, crisp coating.  I didn't have time to marinade so I cooked it on a cookie sheet on grill for 8 minutes. Then I put salmon on a grid to brown on grill. The sauce was poured into a serving dish that the salmon went into after browning. Excellent recipe! No leftovers.

It was excellent and our company loved it. The only thing I didn't do was marinate it for two hours. Didn't have enough time so it only marinated about 1 1/2 hours. Didn't make any changes to the recipe.

LOVED IT! It's SUPER EASY to make. 

I took the tip one of the reviewers stated and individually wrapped each salmon piece with foil and oven backed it @ 425 for 15-20 min, depending on how many you are cooking at once. 

Prepped this for a whole week with Jasmine Rice and vegges.

I made no changes.  It was delicious, tender, flaky and perfectly seasoned.  Cooked it 7 min/side with the flesh side first, finishing with the skin side on the grill.  Nice grill marks on the top.

It turned out absolutely lovely! I did one little thing different though, I got home late from work so I decided to marinate the fish in the juices inside a little ziplock bag overnight, then in the morning I grilled the salmon. So much flavor which such little ingredients! Now to remake this salmon it would cost me only like $5!!!! Love it

I love this recipe. I make this once a week every week and my husband and daughter love it too. I don't grill mine though. I bake it at 400 for about 20 minutes, flipping it halfway through.

I love making this recipe whenever my roommate and I have the chance to buy salmon. It is a bit on the sweet side, so adding something to counteract that (sriracha or perhaps red paper flakes?) would probably be a great addition if you find it too sweet. I like to prep this, let it marinate for about 2 or more hours, and then throw it on a George Foreman grill for until I can see that it is still moist enough on the inside that it breaks and crumbles apart with a fork when I check if it fully cooked. This is one of the easiest/laziest way to create delicious salmon!

This recipe is fantastic! My son was hesitant to try it (picky about fish) and ended up devouring it & asking for more. I followed it exactly and marinaded overnight. It was perfection, I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for sharing!

I cut back the sugar a bit so it didn't get too sweet. The whole family liked this. Used on "Fresh Farmed Atlantic Salmon Filet" from Costco. A definite make again!!

I'm not usually a big fan of salmon but this was really good.  I prepared the marinade exactly as written; the only thing I did differently was to cook the salmon on a cedar plank.  What a nice treat.

Followed recipe exactly except cooking directions. Baked in foil packets I think at 425 for about 12 minutes then broiled for almost five. Definitely restaurant quality recipe!

The recipe itself was great, but it was my first time trying salmon, and I'm not a fan. However, I think this recipe really saved the salmon and made it edible. Whenever I took a bite that was covered in the marinade/grill marks, it was super delicious. (Also, we used lemon juice instead of lemon pepper, simply because that's what we had.)

Really easy! Really good! Not a mess to clean up! The people who said to reduce the marinade and serve on the side are brilliant! Recipe seems pretty foolproof. A little less soy sauce was/is better for our tastes and we don't buy anything but olive oil but it was fine in this recipe. Haven't tried the lemon juice or fresh ginger but do like the suggestions people had - next time (maybe, if I can bear to change the recipe...). Thanks for this recipe.

Made this for dinner last night as written but didn't add salt.  We are salmon lovers and usually like it grilled with just olive oil and lemon or white wine but this was awesome!  Everyone loved it and will definitely make this again.

I wasn't a huge fan of salmon until I used this marinade. Absolutely the BEST!!! The entire family loves it every time I make it and I have 2 small kids :-) Definitely the best salmon recipe that I've found and it's the only one I use anymore! Take note, definitely marinade it all day.

We really love this recipe. We don't leave it in a container for two hours like it asks but it still turns out amazing every time. One thing I would say is that putting the extra rub on top of the salmon when you grill it caramelizes and burns the rub. It still tastes good, but that's just something to be careful of.

Great recipe - very easy.  The sauce is very sweet - I may add lemon juice next time or reduce the brown sugar.  I grilled the salmon with skin side down on foil for the first 5 minutes then took the salmon off the foil (the skin stayed with the foil) and then put flesh side down on the grill for just a few minutes more which caramelized the sauce on the salmon.  Reduced the remaining sauce by boiling on the stove.  Good, just too sweet for me.

I made this with a little improv. Had no brown sugar, so I mixed white sugar and some blackstrap molasses. I cut the soy sauce down to a tablespoon and used olive oil. I also cooked it in the foil in the oven like one reviewer mentioned. I poured all of the marinade into the foil pouch. It worked out nice. Most everyone liked it and rated it 4.5 stars. There's no half star so we rounded it down. The 3 year old ate it, the 11yr old ate it, my wife and I ate it. The picky teenager skipped it! 4 stars.

Great recipe for Salmon even for the non-Salmon lover like me.  Very flavorful.  I only had 1 hr. to marinade but then boiled the rest and basted during grilling.  I also took the advice of another and cooked it first skin side down on aluminum foil then when I flipped it the skin pulled right off with the foil!  The only issue I had then was that the side that was directly on the grill was sticking so might need to flip it onto another piece of foil or try a foil packet like others suggested.  My son who is 10 said we need to have this more often!

I followed the recipe, except, I put it on a cedar plank on a charcoal grill and it was AWESOME!  Even my wife, who isn't a salmon fan, liked it.  Super easy and so good.

Delicous marinade!  Salmon turned out great.  I didnt have lemon pepper so I used lemon juice from a fresh lemon and topped the fish with four slices of lemon while on the BBQ.  I also only used maybe a tablespoon of brown sugar and it was still delicous :)  Will be making this again soon...

This marinade is wonderful.  I too always substitute olive oil for vegetable oil. Another variation is to use teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce.  We love it both ways.

I have made this a couple of times and I'm making it again tonight. My fiancé said this was better than any salmon he's had in any restaurant, even while he was in the Caribbean. He now thinks I'm an amazing cook! Thank you for posting this recipe.

I have made salmon using this recipe for over a year now at least once a month. It is the best marinade for salmon you will find anywhere. I have made for non salmon lovers and have converted them all because of this marinade. Whether you grill, bake, or broil it it is fool proof and is OUTSTANDING and so simple. Must try and one of my favorite recipes on this site.

I didn't have lemon pepper on hand, so I used black pepper and about 1 tsp of bottled lemon juice. Other than that, I prepared as directed, let sit in marinade about three hours and grilled on medium heat for about 10 minutes. Delish!

Changed a bit on the recipe, added 1/2 tsp of minced ginger, used 2 tablespoons of light brown sugar, 1tsp black sesame oil, 1tsp rice vinegar. Came out amazing, let it marinate for 30 minutes flesh side down.

This had a lot of flavor but was too sweet for my wife and I. If I make it again, I will be using 1/2 of the recommended sugar. Other than the sweetness, we really like this recipe!

Great marinade for salmon.  I have tried to like salmon for years because it is so good for you and this marinade made the salmon taste delicious.  Just the right amountn of brown sugar and soy, not too salty and not too sweet.  It could use a little more lemon flavor though. This ones a keeper..

We tried this recipe tonight.  I am the only one in our family that does not care for fish!  I made this recipe as written, only used the oven at 450 degrees for approximately 12 minutes plus some broil time, as others suggested as the weather was not cooperating for a bbq.  Everyone loved it!!  I tried a small piece and actually liked it.  Thanks so much for posting!!

My family of picky eaters loved it and they keep asking when I'm going to make it again!  I didn't have lemon pepper so that ingredient was missing.  I'll have to try it sometime with the lemon pepper.

We made this tonight and my husband and I loved it.  We had a 2 1/2 lbs salmon fillet and I cut it to fit inside the grilling rack.  There was plenty of marinade for it.  We cooked with a charcoal grill, it was excellent!  Thanks for posting this, we will be having it often!

Everyone loved it! You can't go wrong with Copper River reds but my goodness, this is one to save!! Reminds me of teriyaki beef jerky. Even a girl who says she doesn't like salmon loved it. I'd removed all the skin first and was worried it would fall through the grates of my grill. Nope, it was perfect!!

I usually make blackened salmon, but I had some salmon that had been in my freezer for a while and thought that using a marinade would hide some deficiencies that freezing causes. It worked. This marinade was super easy to prepare, especially since I stuck to the recipe without any alteration in ingredients. I did, however, bake it in the oven rather than grill it. I took the advice of others and cooked it for about 12 minutes at 450 degrees, followed by a couple of minutes at broil. It came out nice and moist and flavorful. It was a nice change from the normal way I cook salmon.

This recipe is amazing!  Even the kids loved it and asked for seconds and thirds (they said they didn't like salmon before this recipe).
I really recommend the Mrs. Dash lemon pepper seasoning over a few others I have tried. The flavors are much more balanced and enhance the overall flavor.

The longer you marinate the salmon the better it will be!  Can't go wrong.

I wish I would have loved this, but I didn't like the taste of the marinade. I'm not sure if it was too sweet or something, but I won't be trying this again. Otherwise, instructions were easy to follow

Oh my goodness, this was outstanding! Followed the recipe exactly except cut 1.5 lbs of salmon into 4 pieces instead of 6 and it still turned out delicious!!  I can't believe the flavor.  Try it, you won't regret it!

Very good --nothing phenomenal about it, but a repeat per my family!   I marinated my piece for just about 10 minutes and stuck my fork into the flesh so the marinade could dribble into the flesh of the salmon.  It was good!

This was fantastic!!  We paired it with a fresh pico, roasted red potatoes, and grilled asparagus, all simply prepared with olive oil, salt and pepper.  It was the perfect summer dinner.  My 6 and 3 year old girls wanted to lick their plates!  We had a few leftovers, and I think the flavors were even better the next day for lunch.  We will definitely be making this again.

I have had this no fewer than 10 times since I found the recipe and it remains an awesome staple.  In the last several meals I have used a cedar plank to grill the salmon and it works much better than straight on the grill.  I added dill and cilantro to the water for soaking the plank but not sure how much it makes a difference.   soak the plank for at least two hours and then skin side down on the plank.   Tonight I added red pepper flakes to the marinade and OMGosh it was wonderful ... Provided exactly the right kick to the fish.  I will definitely use the red pepper when I can't use garlic for friends that are allergic.  thank you so much for a great base!

Simply fantastic!  Had a huge bbq party & EVERYONE loved the salmon which I fixed just as the recipe states - I used Copper River Salmon which is one of our favs!  Had a leftover filet that we grilled the following night, which was in the marinade overnight, & it was just as good (if not better!) than the first night!

Love, love, love this recipe. I made it as is, but marinated for 16 hrs or so. Fantastic. Make sure to have a hot grill if you're going to follow the cook time. I made a creamy dill sauce that paired perfectly.

I added a tablespoon of crushed garlic to the liquid mixture. I only had an hour for marinading but that worked ok. It seemed to emphasize the salmon more which was of high quality. I put the salmon slices in an aluminum foil wrap and drizzled a few tablespoons of the marinade on top of the salmon before sealing. The marinade was absorbed by the salmon and kept it moist. The foil meant cooking it about 10 minutes on each side on my charcoal grill. It was delicious!

Not a fan of salmon so I started here and it was a good choice. I did not use lemon pepper, added minced onion and used pineapple juice instead of water. Best salmon I've eaten so far.

Got near to completion of making this recipe and then came to the realization that we did not have cashews or any other nuts in the house, excepting a bag of salted, in-shell peanuts. My improv was to cut some going-stale pretzel sticks into small chunks and use them instead. Probably not as good, but definitely good enough. 

Wait, I also had no soy and used instead Worcestershire. Why that seemed immaterial, I know not, but it was perfect.

This is only my second time eating salmon (that someone else cooked) but my first time cooking/grilling it myself.  It was very good!  My son-in-law tried it (his very first time having salmon) and he loved it!  He told me next time I make this, let him know.

Love the flavor of this marinade.  Only thing I changed in the marinade is to use EVOO instead of vegetable oil.  I marinated for about 4 hours and chose the foil packet way of cooking (my first time for this).  I boiled the marinade with a teaspoon of cornstarch and just brushed that on the filets after they finished cooking.  Next time I will bake them for the 12 minutes, brush on the thickened marinade and broil for 5 minutes.  Any way you cook them you can't beat the flavor of the marinade.  It's yumbo.

Great easy recipe. I normally don't flip salmon but tends to dry out.  Flipped and this turned out awesome.

I wish I would have thought ahead and omitted the salt - the soy sauce was salty enough, so the whole was just a little more salty than I would have liked. Overall though, a delicious marinade that complemented the salmon nicely. Didn't have the grill out yet, so I did these in a cast iron skillet on the stove and then finished them under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp the skin. Very good!

I had a half of a salmon in the freezer that I bought to use during the holidays when the family was home. We'll  I didn't use it and now I had half a salmon for two people! 
I came across this recipe and tried it and it was great. What was even better is it tasted good through all three meals we had it for. This was very easy and very good. It is a keeper.

My wife and kids really liked it, but, as with every recipe I find on here, I made some modifications based on the reviews:

I have a family of 6 so I used 3lbs of Swai.
Also, I didn't have lemon pepper, so I added coarse ground black pepper and juiced a whole lime; I also decided to use about a teaspoon of minced garlic instead of garlic powder.

I baked them in little foil packets (and ladled in the sauce mixture into each) at 350 for 15mins, and served over white rice and topped with chopped green onions.

According to the kids, I'll be making this again soon.

DELICIOUS!!! This is by far my favorite salmon recipe.  My kids love it.  My 3-year-old asks for more every time I make it.  It's SOOOOO easy. In the spring and summer, I grill the salmon, but when it's cold outside I bake it and it's still delicious.

I made this with home made garlic any herb biscuits, mashed potatoes and grilled corn on the cob with garlic sauce. The flavor of the salmon pulled everything together! And I like my salmon a bit crispy so when took some bites it was great how the brown sugar and soy sauce mix so well together. Great recipe!!! It made my husband happy .

Perfect. Made it exactly to the recipe and was pleasantly surprised. Was worried it might be too sweet with all the sugar or too salty with all the soy sauce but it was perfect. In the end, it was all perfect.

I have always grilled my salmon by just adding spices. This is the first time that I have done my salmon in a marinade. Wow, my friend said. That is some of the best salmon I have ever had. That was very gratifying. I must say that it came out very delicious.

I was prepared to LOVE this.  I prepped the marinade and marinaded the salmon all day while we were at work.  Mr. LTH did a bang up job grilling the salmon, but I just didn't LOVE it.  We'd eaten Firecracker Grilled Salmon from here last week and I think that's my issue.  This was OK, but I definitely preferred last week's salmon (I didn't even finish mine; opting for more potatoes!).  THANKS for the recipe!

FANTASTIC and simple.  We love it.  I grilled half the salmon on the first day and half the second day.  The second half marinated for almost 30 hours and was even better than the first.  (Some meats don't do well with over-marination, but my fresh Coho Salmon did great.)  I always bring the fish up to room temp before I grill, so it comes uniformly up to temperature (135º).

We use the lemon juice & add pepper and only use the 1T olive oil as others have said.  We make it so much, sometimes I'll mix Worcestershire into the mix for different flavor.  Marinate overnight... so much better!

Everyone loved it. I followed other suggestions/substitutions: wrapping in foil, olive oil instead of veggie oil, grilled face down with no turning so it took a little longer to cook, but worth it.  I also reduced the amount of soy sauce.  I didn't see this, but I also seasoned again before grilling because I didn't see any of the fish. This will be made again!!!

This was fantastic! Made on my indoor grill - just amazing! I did not add any salt as the soy sauce was plenty and I squeezed the juice of half a lemon into the marinade, served it with quinoa and broccoli. Very good, this will be a hard one to beat, so easy, relatively few ingredients and YUMMY.

The flavor was okay, but I prefer a simple dry seasoning on my salmon. Just lemon pepper or WEBER'S "Sweet 'N Savory Salmon" dry rub.

I just made this salmon dish this evening.  It turned out really well.  I do think after tasting it that next time I will allow to marinate longer than two hours - just to infuse the seasonings longer for stronger affect.

Just finished eating and it was wonderful. I added slices lemons and onions on top and cooked in foil over the grill. I also only marinated in for 30 minutes and let the salmon cook with the marinade in the foil. The hubby loved in and he's a finicky eater.

Easy and delicious.  We've been making this marinade for years.  Sometimes I add ginger, too.  Great brunch item - impress your guests with a meaty, caramelized filet.  Toss some lemons on the grill at the end to serve with with it.  Even those who don't care for salmon will eat this up! Guests will think you are a gourmet chef!

the marinade was very good but we made a sauce out of the leftover and it was very salty.  will use as a marinade but bypass the sauce.

Really good.  I followed Elizabeth's tip and wrapped each filet in foil then baked at 425 for 15-20 minutes.  It was perfect, not dry at all.  Kids liked it too.

Sauce gave it a good twist. I did opt out on the salt for seasoning since soy sauce is salty enough for me and I did add more brown sugar for a sweeter punch. Turned out great will use recipe again!

Believe the hype. This recipe is fantastic. This was my first time making salmon and it was the best I've ever had. Didn't have lemon pepper so used fresh squeezed lemon juice and black pepper but otherwise followed recipe exactly. I also baked it for about 20 min at 400.

I used to be nervous about cooking seafood but this recipe is incredibly quick and easy to make.  Now all of my children are hooked on Salmon.  I've tried other salmon recipes, both at home and in restaurants, and this beats all of them.  The salty / sweet flavor is WONDERFUL!  The kids love to make the marinade themselves.  I usually leave the lemon pepper off the kids' pieces.

This recipe was DELICIOUS! I loved it. I did what another person suggested and used 1/3 cup of lemon juice and black pepper instead of the lemon pepper and then I put them in little aluminum foil packets and put in the oven. Turned out amazing!

I was looking to try something new with my salmon and stumbled upon this delicious and easy recipe. I was skeptical about the sugar at first but tried it anyway and it was just delicious. I love it, I'm going be using this marinade for salmon from now on until something better comes up.

Excellent! I sprinkled the salmon with lemon juice and pepper, then marinated it with the soy sauce, brown sugar and olive oil. After 2 hours I wrapped it in tinfoil and baked for 15 minutes in the oven at 425. While baking I made a salad and thickened the sauce with cornstarch. Delicious, next time I want to make it for company, it was that good and easy. 8/17 I have tried it with lemon pepper still delicious although I couldn't marinate it that long.

Amazing recipe.  The only thing I do differently is make a foil tray and add apple wood chips on the grill.  The smoke takes it to the next level.

Really good base - and great with the changes others mentioned:  used juice of 1 lemon instead of lemon pepper, decreased soy sauce to 1/4 cup and used only 1 Tbsp olive oil.  Also did grill flesh side 1st, then flipped but would suggest re-oiling grill when flipping salmon over.  Marinating for a couple of hours really brings flavors out.  Thanks for the basic recipe.

Liked this dish. My family is literally fighting over the last piece. Getting out the grill is a hassle though so I just broiled it for 10 minutes. It turned out great. I couldn't find lemon pepper but lemon juice and black pepper worked out fine. As a side dish recommendation; asparagus and hollandaise.

I made this recipe using swai fish...the frozen kind, so nothing fancy. It came out absolutely delicious! The only thing I did differently was 1) I baked it for about 25 minutes on 400 degrees with about 75% of the marinade drizzled on top and 2) I added green onions to the marinade (because I love green onions). They complimented the favors nicely...this a new staple for my fish recipes!!! P.S. I tried it with frozen salmon filets (sans green onions) previously...the swai turned out better.

I made it according to directions other than adding 1/2 of a fresh squeezed lemon, plus the pepper and garlic powder all to the marinate.  It was SOOOO good.  My 14 year old VERY EXTREMELY PICKY daughter gobbled it down and licked her plate.  I served in on top of a bed of quinoa. I will add this to my list of "perfect recipes for anyone" list!!!

My husband hates salmon, but he LOVED this meal!!! After marinading the salmon overnight, I baked it (in a foil pouch) in a preheated 450 degree oven for 15 minutes.  What a great recipe!!!  Thank You!

Only used olive oil instead of Veg. oil. Also did not flip over during cooking on the grill. Other than that, followed the recipe. Marinated for 4 hours. So delicious. Made with grilled squash and zucchini. Awesome dinner!! Thank you for the recipe!!

It's not bad but it could be better. For it to be truly asian, I added some chopped ginger and fresh garlic along with a few chili flakes.

This was so easy!  I baked a 2 lb. filet for about 40 minutes at 350 degrees.  

The salmon was flaky and moist and very tasty.  I doubled the recipe as  was using 2 lbs., but I think I would use less of the butter/soy sauce next time.

For years I have avoided salmon.. I never cared for it in restaurants and couldn't get into the smoked version. So when my hubby requested that I add salmon to our menu rotation for health reasons, I came across this recipe and made a back-up dinner for myself in case I didn't like it. I ended up eating the whole fillet - and have made salmon several times since then! I used Elizabeth's advice and baked the fillets in foil packets - they turned out perfectly! My husband has requested I make this for our next dinner party!
Thank you for a simple and delicious way to enjoy salmon!

Made this last night and cooked it on the grill.  It was delicious!  I made it exactly by the recipe with no changes other than doubling the portions for a larger crowd.  Everyone raved!  I will definitely be making this one again.  Next time, though, I do think I will try a little ginger in the marinade as one of the posters mentioned.  Not because I didn't like the original version, but simply because I love ginger!

I wish I had marinated overnight! Prepared as written with the following changes. Added 5 large minced cloves of garlic. Also, No additional salt and used Low Sodium Soy Sauce. Instead of the lemon pepper, I added 2 TBSPNS lemon juice. Marinated two hours and used the foil packet method, 15 minutes at 425F.

Served with Asian Sticky Rice and Stir fried veggies with stir fry sauce. An excellent meal!!

I thought it was pretty good, but a little salty, and I really didn't even use that much salt to begin with because I knew the soy sauce would be pretty salty on its own. I did add a few good squirts of lemon juice to the marinade since I didn't have any lemon pepper (along with seasoning the fillets with pepper). I also used grape seed oil instead of vegetable, and cooked on the stove top instead of a grill. Just a side note, I was making asparagus to go with this and decided to add some of the marinade to the asparagus after sauteing in butter and omg it came out so good!!

I would give it even more stars if I could.  My kids thought it was as good if not better than the Hibachi restaurants.  I made it exactly like the recipe.

Yum! Yum!! I followed the recipe and it turned out perfectly even though I only marinaded for approximately 30 minutes. I barbecued on the grill for approximately 6 to 7 minutes on one side, and carefully flipped it to get the beautiful grill marks. My husband raved that it was the best salmon ever!

Made this for tonights dinner and it was so good, my husband and I fought over the last piece. There is nothing that I would change in this recipe but I did take the advice from a review and made a gravy with the leftover marinade and so glad I did. AMAZING!

This recipe was delicious! I did not have time to properly marinade it, so I just marinaded it for about 15 min and then grilled each piece of salmon in its own foil with the marinade.  It turned out delicious!!

I have had this several times and love it. I would order salmon and never eat it. Then my husband said he would find a recipe and if I still didn't like it I should give up on eating salmon. Well he tried this recipe and grilled it on cedar planks. We get the salmon skin taken off and use the cedar planks to cook it on. It is amazing and I can never get enough. Good job

WOW! I'm not a fan of salmon, but the boys in my house are, so I try to serve it at least once every couple weeks. This is amazing!! I broiled it wraped in foil pouches for about 13 min because we didn't have time to get the grill going. An absolute keeper :) Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful receipe!

The hubby loves salmon and besides my amateur mistake of over charring the skin side of the salmon he said it was really good.  I'm not even a fish or seafood fan and I enjoyed this.  I would say that cooking it for 6-8 mins per side was way too long though.  And I didn't marinate it longer than 20-30 mins so the flavor may be even better if I'd let it marinate the 2 hours stated.  I'm sure I'll have a second chance to prove that :-)

Awesome! I cooked these wrapped individually in tinfoil in my oven and it turned out great that way. I only had time to let it marinade for an hour, but it still turned out very flavorful.

Very good recipe. My only complaint is that you cannot use the marinade as a sauce. On the other hand the marinade was so good a sauce isn't really necessary as it was very tasty.

We made this recipe as-is and liked it. The second time I replaced a bit of the water with bourbon. The third time I replaced all the water with bourbon. Now we love it! We've made this maybe 8 times since then. It does better marinading longer (overnight) than for a short time. It tastes best on the grill but also does well broiled.

Made this recipe as is. Super happy with the results - I was a bit worried that it would be too salty or sweet based on some other reviews, but it was delicious.

This was delicious!  I baked it in the oven at 375 wrapped in foil.  Poured all the marinade in with the fish.  It  turned out fabulous!  I know it's a hit when all 3 of my kids gobble it up!!!  Definitely a keeper!  In fact my family asked me to make it again next week!  Thank you!!!

Love salmon, but didn't care so much for the salt content and lemon on this recipe.  On my second attempt at grilled salmon, I marinated the salmon in Chinese Plum Sauce for 30 minutes.  No other ingredients.  Threw it onto the oiled grill and kept basting with the plum sauce as it cooked.  Wow.  Even my 11 year old loves it that way.

Over all good, the seasoning tends to stay glazed on the exterior of salmon and not soak into the middle which is fine to maintain the original salmon flavor. My family loved it, i thought it was okay.

This recipe was great! I cooked mine in the oven since I live in Michigan and it is January :) I marinated just as the recipe says and then place the fish on an ungreased cookie sheet lined with foil. I turned in the broiler, and while I waited for it to heat up, I started cooking the bottom on the glass top stove on high. I just placed the sheet right over the glass. Once the broiler was ready, I put the fish one the first rack directly under the broiler for about 7 minutes. I then switched the over to bake at 350 and baked on the center rack for about 20 more minutes. My filet was VERY thick, so I checked it every 5 minutes after the first 10 on bake. It was moist and wonderful! Even my 4 year old and 5 year old ate it! (the asparagus was another story :)

yes we tried it at home with my kids (9, 10, 14) and we all loved it.  prepped as instructed but left the salmon as one large fillet then sat the whole thing skin side down on foil and placed it on the grill to cook.  the foil allowed me to create a steam tent and well keep more of the flavors together.  once done your fish will pull away from the skin nicely and you through out the foil with no messy grill to clean.

Simple, elegant, perfect! I wouldn't change a thing but you could easily add your own favorite herbs and spices. I used this for a Copper River salmon filet, marinating it for about 3 hours. I broiled the fish skin side down on a pre-heated pan for about 8-10 minutes. To die for!! It flavors the fish without overpowering it. Just a hint of sweetness from the brown sugar. Even though salmon is expensive (our three large servings cost $13) it's still cheaper and so much more nutritious than fast food! Including rice, veggies, and dessert, the entire meal was less than $20 for three adults!

I'm not a big fish fan, but my husband loves salmon, so I gave this recipe a try.  Had less two hours to marinate and was still amazing. We were both very pleased!  We added fresh lemon juice as we grilled it and it was immediately our favorite salmon dish hands down!

I was never big on eating salmon but this recipe changed my mind.  Followed ingredients to a T but cooked on my indoor grill pan so it did not require any additional oil.  It came out wonderful!!!!

I just recently tried this recipe and it was delicious! I followed the directions exactly except for only marinating for 30 minutes (due to lack of time). Granted, the flavor was probably not as strong but the entire family still loved it! Will definitely make again!

Very good and simple recipe. I took the advice of one reviewer and baked the salmon in a foil pocket instead of grilling.  It was very moist and tender with a good flavor.  I didn't have lemon pepper, so just used pepper, which was still good.

I've been making this recipe for years now and can't believe I never rated it!  It is AMAZING and it's the only way I grill salmon (it's also wonderful with steelhead).  Everyone in my family adores it.  I always make extra marinade that I save that we poor over the fish after it's cooked.  DELICIOUS!!

This is a great recipe and will go into my file for one of the salmon options we like.    I put mine under the broiler and it worked out very well.  I like a bit of crusty edges and was able to get a bit of that.

I improved the flavor, by increasing the quantity of the marinade and seasonings by 50%. I roasted instead of grilling.

reserve some marinade for a sauce. On BBQ can get dry. Very good.  Used real lemon and real pepper instead.

Delicious, we tried a version of this using the marinade then grilling on a soaked cedar plank... might seem an odd pairing but great with Cajun dirty rice which we use from another salmon recipe site (the Cajun grilled salmon recipe page), Wild Salmon Recipes.

I am not a salmon person, but I am trying to eat a little healthier, so I am on the lookout for some fish recipes to include into my rotation.  This was a hit with my boyfriend and I.  We both liked it, so I will be making this again! {Update: this is by far the best salmon recipe I've come across to-date.  We love it!}

Great recipe and easy! I cooked this two separate ways:  1.  directly on the gril and 2.  wrapped in AL foil on the grill.  Loved it both ways but found the AL foil kept it much more moist.  I had no leftovers either time.  Kids loved it!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it wasn't 'knock your socks off best i've ever eaten' but it was good.

I tripled the recipe for a 5 pound filet and let it soak up the marinade for about 10 hours. It was wonderful! My husband caught the fish yesterday - fresh fall chinook with this marinade got rave reviews from our guests. Wish we had leftovers!

Very good.  Try marinating fish in a portion of the sauce.  Even using a portion of the sauce for marinade the recipe should be cut in half.

This was good.  Not the best grilled salmon I've ever made, though.  A little boring for my taste.  The brown sugar did caramelize nicely on the grill though.

YUMMY! I followed the advice and substituted fesh lemon juice and scotch bonnet peppers for the lemon pepper. I also scaled back the soy sauce to limit sodium; the longer you marinate, the better it tastes!

My husband went salmon fishing in Alaska and I have been trying a lot of different salmon recipes.  This is the best one!  I didn't have brown sugar so I used white.  It would probably even be better with brown!  We grilled it on a cedar plank.  It was wonderful!

Delicious! Didn't have any lemon pepper so I used some lemon juice and pepper. Also, got rained out so I broiled them in the oven instead for 8 - 9 minutes. Family loved it, will defnitely make again!!

This was great.  Only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because I deviated from the recipe a bit.
I didn't have prepared lemon pepper so I took the zest of a lemon and added some black pepper and then squeezed some juice over the salmon.
Mine were also broiled in the oven but came out FANTASTIC!!!  Definitely keeping this in my menu rotation!

If you like sweet and salty salmon, go ahead. Personally, I didn't care for how this recipe flavored my rather pricey piece of wild caught Alaskan Salmon ($19.99/lb). I even added more water because I was afraid the Soy sauce would overpower the flavor. I am very disappointed.

Excellent salmon.  I prepared this with sockeye salmon and grilled it on a small countertop foreman grill and it was superb.  Very flavorful and moist.  My husband and I really loved it!

We tried this recipe tonight, with the only change being using a little less soy sauce (1/4 c. instead of the 1/3 c.).  It was wonderful.  My husband loved it!  Will definitely make again.

Delicious and easy.  I baked the salmon using this marinade on 350 for about 30 minutes and it came out great.  I did not refrigerate it, just poured onto the salmon and baked it.  I can't wait to try it again.

Wow, this is so good, a huge hit with our family!  I replaced the lemon pepper and water with the juice of one lemon and throw in some chopped green onions.  I use olive oil instead of veggie oil and marinate all day.  We've used this same marinade for pork chops and plan to try it with chicken.

This was delicious!  My kids and husband even ate it and they don't like fish.  I took some other reviewers advice and made a sauce out of the marinade, but we didn't use it because the fish was just perfect the way it was.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I cooked it on the grill skin side down on foil and gently flipped after 8 minutes, the skin came right off and I grilled for another 8 minutes. Thanks for a great recipe!

very good! I added some onions and mushrooms as well. I would lessen the vegetable oil next time. I like to cook the skin separately so it doesn't get a fish smell.

My family now eats salmon a couple times a week because of this recipe!  I bake the salmon in little foil packets (15 minutes at 425 degrees) with the marinade and it turns out so delicious.  I've never used lemon pepper and it still turns out great.

Awesome!!! I've made this a few times now and love it. I do mine on the BBQ and make sure to prepare extra because I love the leftover salmon on salads the next day. I marinate mine overnight for extra flavour. So good!

This is such a great recipe and it was such an easy fix too. Although I had to tweak it a little bit because I didn't have enough time to let the salmon sit for two hours in the sauce, but I did bake it with the salmon sitting in the sauce and it came out great. Thank you so much for this recipe! Very delicious.

SOOOOOO good!  I marinated the salmon on the counter for about 2 1/2 hours to bring it to room temp before cooking it.  I took other users' advice and cut the salmon into the portion sizes that I wanted and pan seared the flesh side down on med hi heat for about two minutes.  Then I used foil to wrap each piece in a glass baking dish skin side down.  Poured a little of the marinade into each foil pouch and baked the fish @ 425 for about 17 minutes til it got to the perfect doneness for me (Unless it's sashimi,  like my salmon med-well).  It was a HUGE hit!  My boyfriend isn't really a seafood guy and he devoured every bite!  Definitely will make this again!

I have made this a couple of times now and we really enjoy it. I never happen to have lemon pepper so I just use lemon juice in it's place. We LOVE these in the little foil packets another user suggested. Cooks perfectly!

I never have liked salmon but was bond and determined to find a way to eat it. This recipe is wonderful!!! I took the advise from another review and replace the brown sugar with honey. I will be doing this every chance I have to get fresh salmon.

This is the best Salmon recipe I have found. It quickly became a family favorite. I make it exact to the recipe. It has a good flavor and the marinade isn't overpowering. I highly recommend this.

This marinade was great! It complements the salmon flavor very well. Used olive oil instead and cut the amount of oil in half. Still tasted awesome.

Made grilled salmon for the very first time and used this recipe. It was delicious however, I wished that I could have tasted the brown sugar a little more. I plan on making this again but adding a little more brown sugar.

Wow, very good, family raved. I have never steered away from beloved butter/lemon/dill or dijion/mayo versions of salmon. I was always skeptical of soy flavored fish as well as bbq salmon (always bake). But this was great and will definitely make again as well as try variations I have seen in some cookbooks.

I love this recipe and so does my 2yr old. It's a mixture of sweet and salty to perfection and so easy to make. Hint: the longer you marinate the better it tastes!

So good. Flavour was just enough to not take away from the salmon. Brown sugar carmalized on top when we cooked flesh side first.  Our 3 year old gobbled it up first:)

Absolutely amazing! I made this for family and friends and everyone gobbled it up. They were basically searching for anything they could find in my kitchen to soak up more of the sauce. The marinade would be great on chicken and veggies. This recipe is so easy, it's definitely my go-to fail-safe dinner!

Awesome! I only had one fillet, so I just seasoned it with lemon juice and pepper (did not have lemon pepper). I made the marinade with equal parts soy sauce, brown sugar, water, and olive oil (instead of veggie oil) - I just eyeballed it with a spoon instead of measuring (SO easy!). Added a a chopped up clove of garlic to the marinade. Cooked it up on a George Forman grill, super fast, super easy, and delicious!

Bland. There was not enough taste to the salmon even after 3 hours of marinading. I don't know everyone else is giving it rave reviews. Not my favorite.

I made this last night and it was delicious! We cooked it on a cedar plank, and I did not use salt. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly. By far my favorite salmon recipe I have found!!! We are already looking forward to making it again!

I made this for a surprise dinner for my parents' anniversary.. I didn't have 2 hours to marinate the fish so I poked a ton of holes in the salmon fillet and immersed it in a bowl of the marinade for about 30 minutes instead. Also, the lemon-pepper we had was questionable so I just used half a capfull of lemon juice with the seasoning. I got a text message later that night from my mom demanding to know how I made that salmon, because it was the best she had ever had!

I have tried this recipe as is and also tried it with 10 packets of Splenda as a substitute for the brown sugar. also used a specific brand of soy sauce that I favor - Silver Swan.

Amazing. And so simple. For the oil, I use partly sesame oil and partly corn oil. My dad likes to garnish the fish with the marinade, even though the recipe clearly says to discard it. Well, there's no arguing with taste, I guess.

This is perfect. Just the right amount of sweetness and tartness. Will be a staple in my summertime grilling, and probably wintertime broiling too!

I am a really good cook but not when it comes to fresh fish.  
When I read the reviews for this recipe I thought, oh good, I can fix salmon.  
I thought it was still way too fishy tasting.  The sauce was good but nothing to save for use again in this or another dish.  Very dissappointed.

I thought I didnt like Salmon.  Guess I was wrong.  I baked in the oven for 15 min (in foil packet) and broiled for 5 mins. as per another reviewer.  Changed nothing else and marinated for 5 hrs. Delish.....

My husband made this recipe and it was great. He didn't have time to marinade the fish, so he just basted it right before throwing it on the grill. It had a perfect balance of flavor. He did have to cook the fish an additional 6 or 7 minutes, but overall it took very little time and was delicious. We are definitely keeping this recipe for next time.

very good salmon recipe; it is easy and quick to make. With the marinade it stays juicy and tender under the grill.   I served the salmon with steamed broccoli and a caprese salad. My family absolutely loved the salmon.  I will be making this more often

i cooked the salmon in the oven in foil packets as suggested since i don't really grill and they came out perfect! clean up was a breeze.  this got rave reviews from my little ones who love the "pink" fish.

This was amazing. Probably the best salmon I've ever cooked at home. The only thing I left out was the lemon pepper since I didn't have any. I replaced it with a little pepper instead.

LOVED THIS! I've always just kinda liked salmon.. but this recipe, I actually ate all of my salmon, which is rare for me. I didn't have time to marinate the salmon, so I put the filets in individual foil packets (per the advice of another review), poured the marinade over so it would cook in the juices, and sealed up the foil. Baked at 425 for 20 minutes.. came out perfectly!! Yum!!

Delicious! I think this is probably the best salmon I have had (at least the best that I have made). I followed the suggestion to make a foil packet and bake in the oven and it turned out perfect. My picky two year old said "yum yum" and asked for more (something that rarely happens).

Oh my gosh, this is DELICIOUS!  So easy to do too.  I let it marinate all day, and I'm so glad I did, the flavor was incredible and the texture was so juicy and flaky, just perfect.  Like others, I did not need to oil the grill, as the oil in the marinade did the trick.  I will make this often.  Thanks so very much for sharing this!

In my opinion, this is the most delicious way to make salmon, the only bummer about this recipe is it does take a while to make, but it is good.

This was delish!! I wasn't expecting much because of the simple list of ingredients and the lack of an acid ingredient (lemon juice/vinegar), but the whole family loved it. I marinated a skin-on salmon filet half for 2 hours and it was great. I guess the lack of an acid allows for the longer marinating time.

This is by far the best recipe ever for salmon!!! I cut down the sauce b/c I only had just over 1/4cup. Used 1/4cup lemon juice and 1/2tsp of pepper. I also only used 1-2T of olive oil. Sooo tasty and easy! Even our 3yr old son gobbled it up! Thankyou for a great recipe!

very good and easy. since it wasn't barbeque season, i prepared it in a baking dish with the marinade and the put it under the broiler.  it was tasty even though i made it at the last minute. can't wait to try it after marinading overnight. this one's a keeper. i plan to make it for guests, as well

I have to say that my family and I  do not eat a lot of fish.  My husband wanted to try something different, and brought home salmon.  I tried the recipe and my family loved it.   They went for seconds, what in the world.  Yeah!! this recipe was a success!!! I am thinking we are becoming fish lovers.

This is the best fish I have ever eaten.  My husband even liked it, and he always told me he didn't like salmon, or fish for that matter.  I used Mrs. Dash's lemon pepper.  I sprinkled it on top of the fish before I baked it (I don't have a grill).  I also marinated it for 2 days.

Wow,excellent recipe. Because of my work schedule I had to marinate the salmon all day and it was wonderful. Very quick and easy marinade. I would highly recommend this recipe. Oh yes,I did pan sear the salmon with olive oil instead of useing the grill.

WOW!!! This was awesome!!! I am not the biggest fish fan and this was fabulous!! I used frozen Salmon defrosted over night in some milk (discard the mike once defrosted) and then marinated it  while I was at work (about 9 hours). Came home and pre-heated the oven at 425 put the salmon in foil packets and baked for 15 min... And like I said WOW!!! I totally recommend this for any body even non fish lovers....

This tastes amazing. I usually eat it with a zucchini dish I found and rice. I also used someone's suggestion and baked it in a foil packet.

I always make this Salmon recipe and everyone LOVES it!! It comes out perfect everytime! I always double the marinade and sometimes will boil the extra marinade to use for dipping. If you live in a wintery state like me baking the salmon in a foil pouch is a great alternative to grilling!

Such a compliment to salmon.  Slightly cut back on all the ingredients and used low sodium soy.  Used the foil packs suggestion and the fish was cooked to perfection!  Juice and flaky and very tasty.  I was very generous with the lemon pepper and garlic powder.

Really delicious way to cook salmon and I've used the same marinade successfully on prawns  I'm not too keen on garlic powder so I leave this out and put a couple cloves of garlic in the bag when I marinate

The salmon lovers here enjoyed this! The others said it was just okay. I broiled the salmon on high for 8 minutes until golden. Served with Quick Brown Rice and Mushroom Pilaf with salad.

Extremely simple and amazing recipe...I dont have a grill so I put it in the oven at 425 for 12 min.  Mine was a little well done for my tastes, so next time i will only do it for 10 min.  the time depends on the size of the fillet.  Definitely will make again. I might add some red pepper flakes to the marinade to give it a little kick.

Superb!!! I have several grilled salmon recipes, but this one has it all. It's as good as it's going to get. However, I do not use foil on the grill. I have 2 Weber charcoal grill, and cook over direct heat. If you want to "take it up a notch", soak some hickory chips in water for 30 minutes, and scatter them on the hot coals. Cover the grill, and as soon as you see some smoke put the salmon on the grill. You won't be sorry! If you have a gas grill, put the soaked chips in a foil package, poke holes in the bottom, and set the package over the spot where the gas ignites.

I guess I was expecting a lot more out of this recipe.  I left the skin on and I think that stopped some of the marinade absorption because the salmon had no distinct marinade flavor.  I don't think I will use this recipe again.

This is such an easy marinade and flavorful marinade.  I seared the salmon on both sides in a pan, but I can't wait to try it on a grill sometime! I will definitely be making this again!

I figuered all those reviews on here for this recipe couldn't all be wrong and I was right! This salmon was moist with the perfect combination of sweet and savory from the brown sugar and soy sauce. I pierced the salmon many times over with fork before marinating and then let it sit for about 4 hours. Easy, fast, awsome!

I was afraid I'd get too much of a sweetness or saltiness, but it came out loaded with this mellow blend of delicious flavors.  THANKS.  Will use often.

We used this recipe for our annual cookout, which is very large with many guests.  The recipe was easy, which was what I needed since I had a lot of cooking to do.  My husband and guests all said this was the best salmon they ever tasted.  This dish will be included as a feature in our future events.

So good even for leftovers! I too didn't have time for marinade, but i stuck it in the fridge flesh side down in the juice for 30 mins or so then did the foil pouch thing and it was fantastic. Had left overs so heated them up right in the oven in the same pouch and fliped them to be skin side up half way through. I put in on a nice firm bread and drizzled the remainder of the juice and had a yummy treat! The skin came off so easily, just gently used the edge of a fork. Next time i'd like to try it with pepper for a nice spicy kick

Great recipe but because I was rushed I only had time to marinade it for 45 minutes. It was delicious! Next time I won't marinade it any longer as we liked the way it tasted.

Very good, but a bit sweet for my personal taste. I prefer a more savory. Next time I will just decrease the brown sugar a bit. Otherwise, very delicious!

This marinade made some of the best salmon I've had, restaurant or home.  I left it in for 24 hrs. and it was perfect.  I wouldn't let it sit any longer though, or it will break down the meat too much.  Delicious!

It's kind of hard to mess up such a yummy fish as salmon! Used 1/3c lemon juice and 1/4tsp pepper since I had no lemon pepper, 1/4c soy, and 2Tbsp. olive oil vs. vegetable oil. Had trouble with the fish on the grill, maybe next time we will put them in foil packets, leaving space for air to escape, either on the grill or in the oven at 425 for 15 min.

Delicious!  My husband loved it and he is a picky seafood eater.  My teenagers won't go near seafood so I used the same marinade for a few chicken breasts.  It was a hit overall!

We really liked it. I was afraid it would be too sweet, but flavor was nice. Only marinated 1/2 hour as recommended in other fish recipes. Two out of three kids wouldn't eat it. Just one of those nights?

Looked great,tasted good, but had less flavor than I'd anticipated based on reviews.  Used fresh wild salmon which I'd definately recommend over farm raised.

I loved this!  As a pescatarian I almost always make the rest of the family a meat dish while I enjoy a nice, bland piece of fish.  This recipe was incredible.  I will absolutely make this over and over again!

This was tasty.  I added a bit of lemon juice to up the zing a bit.

I used 1/4 cup lemon juice and fresh pepper. I also used one clove of garlic crushed and about 1/2 the oil called for.  Turned out great

Simple, easy and very very good. I have tried other marinades and this one is definitely one I would use again. I didn't have to go shopping and my kids absolutely LOVED it--which is the best review of all. If you want a quick, easy, really good tasting marinade for salmon, this is definitely it!!

Excellent recipe! I used the foil method in the oven and it was perfect. It marinaded for 2 hours and was full of flavor. Another one I will make over and over again because it is so good and very easy.

Simple and delicious! We marinated fish overnight and cooked the fish in foil on the grill and for the last few minutes we took it out of the foil and placed it on the grill. Came out excellent! This is a keeper.

I've made salmon a few times and this has been our favorite recipe.  I used lots of lemon-pepper and garlic and a little koshar salt and pressed it into the meat so it wouldn't come off in the marinade.  Used low sodium soy sauce. Grilled for 20 minutes on a cedar plank that was soaked in water for a few hours.  Excellent-no flipping needed.

Really simple and tasty marinade for the salmon.  I didn't have any lemon pepper on hand, so I subbed just a squeeze of lemon juice for each filet.  It came out great.  Will definitely make again.

Very tasty meal. My boyfriend and I loved it. Will certainly make again. The only thing different that I did was pan sear it. Next time I make it though I will set some marinade on the side  to dip.Fantastic recipe!!

This is my favorite marinade for salmon yet.  It gives it a smoky sweet and salty flavor - I recommend grilling it over charcoal as well.

Awesome, awesome, awesome! The only thing I did differently for this recipe was what another reviewer did. I kept the filets wrapped in foil after removing it from the marinade and cooked it on the grill. The whole family loved it and it was SUPER EASY!

This was a good recipe but I still perfer the Maple-Soy Salmon recipe from this website better.  I used Sockeye salmon for this recipe so I didn't skimp.

Very easy dish and maybe use the sauce for other things too.  If you do cook it in the oven make sure that you cover each salmon loosely with foil so you keep the flavor in.  If not then the salmon may turn out a bit dry.  Excellent dish and worth trying!

I never thought I would make good fish, but this turned out superb!  I love the taste and how easy this recipe is!  I had to cook mine in a frying pan, which I coated lightly in olive oil.  I loved how it turned out!  This is my favorite recipe for salmon now!  Restaurant quality and easy clean-up makes this a 10-star recipe!

oh my goodness! this was delightful. i made the full amount of marinade for 1 lb. of salmon, and added flour to the remainder for a heavenly sauce for garlic lemon-pepper mashed potatoes. my husband is already planning to use the marinade for chicken and maybe even pork chops!

This is a great simple recipe for salmon.  I think salmon tastes great on it's own so getting too fancy runs the risk of ruining it.  I've got to say, you folks who are wrapping your fish in a little foil pouch, be brave, put it on the grill, directly on the grill, a charcoal grill.  If you're going to trap it in foil why bother lighting a grill at all?  GRILL it ON the grill, it's so delicious!

I do not eat fish.  That being said, this was wonderful.  Even my 3 year old scarfed it up and wanted more.  I did not have lemon pepper so I added pepper and the juice of one lemon to the marinade.

Excellent!  Followed recipe except used olive oil instead of vegetable.  Cooked on foil on the grill.  I only marinated for about 20 minutes because it was a last minute decision, but I saved a little marinade aside to pour over fish when done.  Next time I'll marinate longer because I'm sure it would be even better, but it was yummy this way too. I made with the roasted asparagus from this site. I'm trying to get more fish and vegies into my diet, so this will be a regular on my menu.

Absolutely perfect marinade.  I used olive oil instead of the other.  I made this with Nutty Basmati Pilaf from Recipezaar - except that I omitted her spices, and added onion, carrot, peas, snap peas, and 1/4 cup of this marinade as part of the cooking liquid.  It was an AWESOME dinner.  Next time, I would use 1/2 c of the marinade in the rice - it could definitaly hold up to the flavors.

because of the health benefits, I have tried (unsuccessfully) to get my husband to eat salmon. He just wasn't crazy about it until I tried this recipe.  I used the sockeye salmon and it was really good, he even said he would definately eat it again! Yeah!

Outstanding! Just made it today. My girlfriend "doesn't like fish", and she liked it a lot. It's perfect for outdoor activities where some people don't appreciate good fish. I love pacific salmon with just lemon, or just broiled; but this was delicious! And so effen simple!

Fantastic recipe! I used olive oil instead of veg. oil for health purposes (and used about 1/2 of what the recipe called for). And thankfully, I only marinated for 20 min. and then saved some of the marinade to brush on while it was cooking. Tasted great! A new favorite!

I bet this is great on grilled salmon.  I read through all the reviews to see if anyone used it on their smoker, but no one did.  I tried one salmon plain and one with this marinade.  The smoke taste was too dominant - this marinade was lost.  I could barely taste the difference between plain and marinated.  So, if you're planning on smoking this, it isn't worth it.  I look forward to trying it on just grilled salmon though - the marinade has all the right stuff!

I made this for supper tonight and it was delicious!!!! I would recommend everyone try this recipe. It has just the perfect blend of sweetness from the sugar and the spices.  I think I will use this recipe from now on when I cook salmon.  Even my 5 yr old loved it!

Very good.  I use LaChoy Light to ease the soy flavor and I add 1 tbs of liquid smoke.  This is now my favorite for salmon!

This was outstanding salmon. My husband and I both agree that it is the best salmon we have ever had, and we lived in Alaska for years, where we had all kinds of good salmon. Even my 3 young children ate it up, and they are not big on fish. I highly recommend you give this one a try.

Awesome!   I used a 2# sockeye salmon fillet that I bought frozen.  Defrosted in frig for 24 hours (in original packaging), than cut in 1/2 and marinated both halfs for 8 hours. Grilled skin side up for 7 min. (on oiled grill grate) than flipped and grilled for another 8 min.  Best salmon we have ever had.   Served 7 with a few pieces leftover for the next day.  Thanks for great recipe.

Yum... only change was I substituted fresh garlic for the garlic powder because I prefer the flavor.  We made this with veggies we steamed on the grill in foil packets and some herbed brown rice on the side.  This is definitely the best way to eat salmon.  My friend doesn't really like fish but even he loved this and wants to try this marinade on tri-tip.

An easy, quick recipe with a great flavor! All the recipes are things I had on hand. Instead of grilling though, I baked it. A genereal rule of thumb for baking salmon is bake at 400 degrees and 10 minutes for every inch of thickness. I promise you will get perfection each time!! Next time, I will skip the salt though because the soy sauce and garlic powder is plenty salty. This marinade will also go great with chicken too I think.

This recipe definitely deserves a 5 star rating.  A wonderful marinade, that doesn't overpower the flavour of the salmon.  No modifications needed at all.

This was absolutely wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly, but I ended up marinating my salmon for about 7 hours. I also broiled the filets since I didn't want to deal with the grill, and it turned out excellent! It was a wonderful meal with steamed rice and a spring mix salad. I will definitely be making this again.

Really good!  I used about a 1/4 cup of soy as opposed to the recommended 1/3 cup.  I also used an organic dark brown sugar that complimented the richness of the salmon nicely.  Put it over a spinach and arugula salad and called it a dinner!

This is the first salmon recipe i have tried, and it was amazing.  i now have no need to ever try another one.  2 of my guests commented that this recipe this salmon was better than the restaurants that they use to work at (longhorn steakhouse and brazzenhead in columbus, OH)

this was so moist and yummy. i created a foil pouch and cooked it in the oven like a  reviewer suggested. my roomies loved it and are making it now toO. i love how u dont need many ingredients. that's one of the important things when i make foods, that i dont have to go out and buy a crapload of ingredients. this saves money and time, which is imperative as a college student. thanKS!

The only reason I gave this 4 stars & not 3 stars is because I poached in foil (as another reviewer recommended)& did not grill the salmon.  Maybe grilling it next time may do the trick

So good and super easy!  I served this to a group of 12 ladies and was going to grill it, but it was raining so hard, I just didn't want to deal with the outside gas grill.  Instead, I sliced it into 12 individual serving size pieces and wrapped each piece in a foil pouch and baked it at 350 degrees for about 12 minutes.  The salmon was incredible!  Moist and delicious!  My ladies and my hubby told me it was the BEST salmon they had ever had!

This was such a delicious recipe!!! I will definitely be making it again. It had a wonderful flavor with hints of lemon. Definitely would recommend to anyone. I baked it in the oven for 15 minutes at 425 degrees in a tin foil pouch. I made hollandaise sauce and poured it over the salmon. Simply delicious!!!!!

This recipe is great! Had a lot of wonderful flavors.  I did as others suggested and wrapped the salmon in a foil packet and baked at 450 for 12 min, then uncovered and baked for another 5 minutes. CAME OUT PERFECT. My boyfriend loves salmon and he was very suprised at just how great this was and is wanting to know when I will make it again!

This is an awesome recipe for salmon! Fixed according to the recipe. Was only able to marinate it for about 2 hours but it was so delicious.  The combination of soy sauce and brown sugar is fabulous - the relatively strong taste of salmon can handle these ingredients.  I'll take the advice of some of the other reviewers and marinate longer next time. Thanks for such a wonderful and simple recipe!

This is a really good recipe.  I didn't have lemon pepper, so I substituted it with regular black pepper and lemon zest.  Otherwise, I followed the rest of the recipe exactly...so easy!  I didn't want to use the grill outside, so I used my Foreman Grill and it was done in about 7 minutes....it was awesome!  I made the Fried Rice Restaurant style from this site (with some minor additions) and it was great!

This is an excellent marinade for salmon. It is very good. Marinate for as long as you can, the longer the better. I cannot wait to make this again.

This recipe is incredible. It is simple and tasty. I didn't grill my salmon. I made individual parchment packets and baked at 400 for 15 mins then turned the oven off and let it sit in the hot oven for 5 mins. When I served the salmon in the packets. I just cut open the parchment packets. My family loved it including the picky 3 yr old.

A little more flavor needed. Maybe if fish retained the mix it would of had more flavor. Although Salmon tasted good.

Wonderful taste. I now have a salmon recipe that my whole family enjoys. Easy to make. Used my Cuisinart griddler (cause it's subzero outside here in MN) and it turned out perfect. Served over a bed of rice pilaf (also found on this site) and garlic broccoli. Great combination!!!

Thank you sooo much for this recipe. I am a new cook and when I say new, I mean just boiled water for the first time. I've been looking for recipes that are easy as well as good and all I could find was stuff that called for ingredients that I had never even heard of.  I have no idea how to mince anything.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I tried it months ago, and I've been making it regularly ever since.  I've gradually made a few changes... Now I omit the garlic powder; instead, I crush a clove of garlic and add it to the marinade.  And instead of using lemon pepper, I just put a slice of lemon on the fillet as it grills, then squeeze the lemon onto the fish once it's on my plate.

For the taste of the fish, I'd give this a 4.  For the taste of the reserved marinade... boiled and then poured over rice... I give this a 5.  Everyone in the family liked this recipe, and it was very easy to make.  Thanks so much for sharing it.  I did cut the amount of oil in half but left everything else the same.

I use the salmon with skin. 
Brown skin quickly in a hot pan and olive oil. Remove and marinate. Cook as directed by recipe.
It give the "crunch" and flavor to this great dish.

Salmon is not my favorite, but with the marinade and grilling, wow, very good.
I used my fav. charcoal Weber grill and a piece of oak from the shop.
It was a hit.

Excellent!  We grill ours on a cedar plank and serve it over jasmine rice with edamame (shelled).  We also reduce the leftover marinade to drizzle over the fish and rice.

Excellent. My husband would only eat salmon in salmon patties prior to trying this recipe. I flaked the left overs and served them on a salad for lunch the next day with a sun dried tomato vinegarette.

This is the recipe that I now always use for salmon - can do it either on the grill or in the oven! Guests ususally request the recipe - and it's easy enough to remember when I'm traveling and cooking.  Thank you Tina for an awesome recipe.

I marinated the fish overnight, it still didnt have much flavor.  I did cook the marinade w/ cornstarch, as some suggested.  That definitely added flavor to the fish.

Was some of the best Salmon I have ever had.  I cooked this recipe for my folks when they came to visit.  My dad said it was the best Salmon that he ever had, and not to tell my Aunt that he had a knew favorite.

I had stopped eating salmon for awhile due to perhaps a bad one. I was watching foodnetwork one day and it seemed everyone that day was cooking salmon so I decided I wanted to try it again. Looked for a recipe to use and found and tried this one.It was FABULOUS!! Even my "non fish" eating DH and 12 yr old daughter LOVED it. DH said if I continue to make salmon this way he will ALWAYS it eat. WE LOVE IT!! We also cook it on cedar plank on the grill. YUM!! Thank you for the post.

This recipe made me fall in love with salmon. As a kid, I enjoyed eating fried salmon patties with ketchup. Other than that, you really couldn't get me to eat fish. This recipe changed that! I have made this many many times and it's come out perfect every time. Once suggestion is to always grill flesh side down first. The marinade carmelizes on the salmon and is absolutely delicious. Thanks for the great recipe.

Yummm!  This is the best salmon recipe I have ever tried.  I serve it over rice with asparagus or green beans on the side.  It's one of my husband's favorite meals!  I bake it at 425 for about 15 min.

This is an awesome compliment to salmon.  My husband claims to not like salmon, yet he always goes on and on about how tastey this recipe is...go figure!  The perfect amount of sweet and salty.  I've never changed a thing!

Sorry, but I didn't like this one.  I'll admit I'm pretty choosy about salmon recipes, but this one just didn't do it for me.  Our fillets were about 1" thick, and the marinade only got to the very outside edge of the meat, so the insides were very plain.  We used fresh King Salmon (as in fresh today) from the best fish market in our area.  The result was clearly the recipe and not the fish.  I won't try this one again.

This is the best salmon I've ever eaten. I tried to reduce the sodium content by using reduced sodium soy sauce. Leftovers are just as good the next day!

this recipe was delicious, fast, simple, and basically foolproof. did i mention delicious? i took the advice of the other reviewers and used the foil packet (425 for 15-16 mins, making two servings) and used olive oil in place of the vegetable oil as well. oh..and i also only let the fish marinate about 30-40 mins..ive read a few places that you shouldnt let fish marinate longer than that, it isnt the same as when you marinate meat or poultry.
it turned out amazingly tender, juicy, full of flavor, and made it seem like i had some actual skill and proficiency in the kitchen. haha.

I love this simple yet tasty recipe!  I was short on time and only marinaded the salmon for a little over an hour.  But I can still taste the great flavors and will definitely plan ahead the next time.  No grilling for me, but I followed the advice of others to bake at 450 for 15 minutes then broil for 5 minutes.  Excellent!  Even my husband and my 2 year old ate it up.  Thanks for a great recipe - it's a keeper!

This was really good!  My hubby is not crazy about salmon, but he lets me indulge occasionally without complaint.  He liked this one though!  I didn't use the lemon pepper because we're not huge fans of it, but otherwise, followed exactly.  Will definitely make again!

This was one of the best recipes I have found so far on this sight! I love it as is, but have also added a 1/2 cup of bbq sauce to "zing" it up a bit! I also use 1/2 the oil ~ Always a hit! Thanks =)

Amazing! My husband rarely eats fish so I ran this recipe by him and he agreed to try it. He loved it! I'll be adding this to our weekly menu plan. It was fast and easy, minimal mess since we grilled it.

This is REALLY good for salmon :)  loved it, and so did my family.  I didn't use lemon pepper, so put a little juice in the marinade.  I used minced garlic, b/c that is what I had on hand.  Great recipe.  Thanks!

Followed exactly (except doubled recipe). DELICIOUS! I only had time to marinate it for 2 hours, and it was still amazingly flavorful. Will use this again soon.

Very good flavor, marinated fish for 6 hours, and used minced garlic, and no salt, plenty of salt on soy sauce.  Great with cilantro rice!

This was good...but nothing special. I found it light and bland on taste. Plus, because of the marinade I will grill for only 2 minutes each side and then bake next time...too many flare ups!

Excellent!  Very easy, simple ingredients, great taste and texture, ameneable to changes and additions. Added a little cayenne pepper to kick it up a bit. Didn't have lemon pepper, but it didn't need it.  Will make again.

My husband and I love this recipe. I usually cook the salmon on stove top. A few drops of liquid smoke into the marinade is nice also. Right before I cook it after it comes out of the marinade I rub some pepper/coarse salt and ginger on each side. The salt helps to seer in the juices. I also use lower sodium soy sauce and Canola oil in place of vegetable oil. It is now one of our favorite dinners!

I don't have a grill, so I simmered the salmon in the soy sauce mixture for about 10 minutes. This is the best salmon I have ever had, and I've had alot seeing as I have family in Alaska. This is going to be a kitchen staple from now on.

This salmon was delicious...it rained, so we followed oen of the other reviews and baked it for a little then broiled it. I also used a little less oil, since I like to use as little as possible. It was exremely delicious, and the broiling made a nice, crisp outside. I loved it!

This was ok.  It grilled real dark - probably because of the sugar and soy sauce.  Some of my guests thought I burned it.  It tasted ok, but I don't like sweet meats, so maybe that's why I didn't rate it a 5.

This could not possibly be an easier or faster recipe to make.  It takes a total of about 3 minutes to make the marinade and then maybe 8 minutes to grill it.  The salmon is absolutely DELICIOUS!  My fiance has requested this many times since I first made it, and I love what a no-brainer it is!

This recipe was great.  I was a little nervous after I tasted the marinade because it seemed too salty.  Thankfully all of the flavors came together nicely for a great dinner!  I marinated my salmon (which were rather thick) for four hours.  I would adjust marinating times according to thickness as I feel my salmon could have marinated longer. 
As other reviewers suggested, I also baked in foil pouches.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Fantastic.  I don't give out 5 stars lightly, but this marinade is truly great.  Carmelized outside, tender inside.  I served with on a bed of spinach, with honey-lime dressing and gingered carrots.

I MARINADED FOR 24hrs (WAY TOO LONG) BUT IT STILL TURNED OUT REALLY REALLY YUMMY.

It's hard to believe that something so simple can be SO yummy!! I didn't change a thing except I marinated it for three hours. I would recommend at least three every time for the best flavor. Next time, I'm going to add cornstarch to the marinade and cook it on the stove to serve over rice! Another person said to add rice vinegar to make salad dressing and that sounds awesome too!!

Great tasting and easy recipe with ingredients that I already had on hand.  I slightly changed it by adding garlic and green onions to the marinade.  I then baked it in the oven for 12-15 minutes and served over rice.  I garnished the salmon with sesame seeds and more green onions.  Next time, I think I will also add some dried chile flakes to add a kick to it.  Great recipe!!

Delicious!  I reduced the marinade and served with the salmon on the side.  Instead of lemon pepper, I used fresh ground pepper and lemon slices.  I wrapped in foil to save my grill.  Will make again.

Thus far my favorite recipe on this site and so simple.  When we have company this is my go to.  I used to live in Alaska and have had a lot of great Salmon dishes.  This is the best and I wont even order Salmon out anymore.

Awesome recipe!  Best to marinate over night if you have the time, but pretty tasty with the 2-hour time as well.  We cooked flesh side down first, for about 4-minutes per side.  Served with green beans and brown rice.

Simply fantastic.  We prepared this dish with a garlic and olive oil cous cous, and a strawberry spinach salad.  Wine was Pinot Gris.  One of the top ten meals we have ever made.

Absolutely delicious!!!!!!  The brown sugar caramelizes a bit for wonderful flavor.  Beware, if you marinade the fish too long (I left it in for 10-ish hours...oops) it may fall apart on the grill.

We wanted to try this recipe, but on the cheap if we didn't like it, so we used tilapia filets. It turned out great! Will definitely try it with salmon to get the full effect!

I loved this recipe. My husband and I made this for our Valentine's dinner, and it was quite the success. I did not have brown sugar so I substituted Maple Syrup which was just as good. I do wish I had made extra marinade to create a sauce.

Simple and fast.  This recipe puts a nice flavor into the fish. I recommend at least a 3hr. marinade.

Another great recipe from this site.  The marinade is DEFINITELY the secret to this wonderful salmon recipe.  It also makes it brown up just right on the grill.  My 21 year old son (who has NEVER liked salmon) loved this one!

I use this recipe, with a little alteration, to marinate my salmon and chicken.  I use 1/4c. lemon juice, and about 1/2 tsp. of ground black pepper, instead of lemon pepper.  I also use fresh basil and whole cloves.  To make healthier, I use xylitol(natural sugar substitute derived from birch)in place of brown sugar, at almost equal equivalent.

There's nothing like the succulent taste of well cooked salmon!  Great recipe, thank you!!  ***note: I have made this now with a sugar free version, I substitute 1 dropper of stevia for the brown sugar... Tastes great still!

This was good, but a bit too salty for my taste.  I'm sure it was due to the amount of soy sauce as I was very sparing with the seasonings.  It's always fun to try a new recipe, but I probably won't make this again.

This was the first time I have ever had Salmon and it was so yummy!  I used lemon juice and black pepper like others did.  I grilled it and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  Will definately make this again!

This was very good, did it in the oven - next time would do it on the BBQ.  Also, I used a large piece of salmon, next time would cut it into smaller pieces so it would cook evenly.

I am not a huge fan of any fish, but I have to say this was excellent.  It had a great flavor and didn't taste fishy!  My husband loved it too. We will make this one again.  We did the foil packets and I baked for 25 minutes to account for the altitude as another person suggested. It was so tender. Thanks!

Me and one of my friends grill salmon a lot, and this is one the best recipes yet.

It had great flavor from the soy sauce and brown sugar.

I normally put a couple slices of lemon on mine while I grill it, to put a little  more lemon flavor in it.

This was delicious!! Just the right amount of everything to make the salmon just right. I foil cooked mine an dit came out perfect!
This makes quite alot of marinade so you can shorten if you are making a smaller amount, i had 4 fillets and it was more than enough.

Make as directed, except add lemon juice for more zing. My kids love this, and the college student asks me to make it every time we buy salmon!

I liked this recipe much better when I substituted lemon juice and pepper for lemon pepper seasoning... My whole family loved it and I have 3 kids that are fairly picky eaters...

This is an awesome easy salmon recipe. The longer you marinate it, the more flavorful it is. I usually reserve some of the marinade and bake the salmon in it at 350 for approximately 20 min or until it flakes easily with a fork.

Fantabulous!!! I usually avoid fish dishes, but decided to try some because of a new "healthy lifestyle" mentality. This was so good, I'm hooked!! The only change that I made was a substitution of roasted garlic teriyaki sauce for the soy sauce, because I was too pressed for time to go to the store. It came out wonderfully, and it was my first time to make/grill any kind of fish EVER!!

So, I am not a big fan of salmon.  Too fishy for me.  BUt, we are trying to eat healthy.  Anyway, this recipe was absolutely delicious!!  It took the fishy taste away and replaced it with a sweet treat!!  I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.  Wouldn't change a thing with the recipe.

So simple but delicious. I made this with some fresh caught Copper River Salmon and it was amazing. I also made this for family in Iowa and got raves. I don't particularly like salmon but here in Alaska it is so common so this is a great recipe that I enjoy too.

I think this recipe would be a hit with those that appreciate the sweet, soy sauce type taste.  However, my family prefers lemon, green onion, butter & some seasoning on theirs.  Following the recipe exactly, it turned out looking very nice (cooked on foil since I have a gas BBQ, didn't need to be turned that way either :-) ). Will not use this again, but have referred to those I know appreciate this kind of flavor.

So delicious.  I didn't have time to marinate very long and I omitted the garlic.  Actually, I kind of threw together the rest of the ingredients without actual measure as this recipe states...still turned out fabulous.  My husband doesn't like salmon, however he tried a small piece only to heap his plate with more!  Kids also like it.  I never would of thought to have used this type of marinade for salmon.  I will try with garlic next time.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is the second time I've made this, and both times, it was mediocre.  The first time, I only marinated it for 30 minutes, so I thought that was the reason it didn't have enough flavor, but the second time, I let it marinade for the recommended 2 hours, and it still tasted the same.  The marinade itself tastes great, but I don't think the salmon is absorbing it very well.

A great success for my first time cooking salmon. I used the Foreman grille and it was cooked to perfection. Great served with wild rice and veggies.

DELICIOUS!  The only change I made was to use fresh garlic, because I didn't have any garlic powder.  My husband and I loved it.  It grilled perfectly, and was juicy and tender.

Very good.  Grilled on medium heat (400) and my husband said it was better than the local fish house restaurant.

I just thought this was ok, but the kids really liked it, so I'm giving it 4 stars.  The sweetness was a little too much for my taste.  I also used lemon juice and lemon pepper, to zing it up a little.

Wonderful flavour.  The best way I have found to prepare salmon.  As suggested by others, I used 1 tbsp olive oil, 1/4 cup soy,, and lemon juice/pepper instead of lemon pepper. I omitted the salt.

Very good.  It is a nice light salmon without a heavy crust or sauce.  My husband is diebetic so I exchanged Splends brown sugar and it cooked and tasted great.  No after taste and we could not tell the difference.

After marinating for over 24 hours the salmon still had little taste.  make sure the pan you are cooking in is HOT, i used a cast iron frying pan and couldn't get it hot enough.  the salmon ended up sticking.

I was really looking forward to making this recipe.  I followed everything to the "t" except that I marinated the salmon for about 3 hours instead of two.  The salmon turned out rather tasteless.  The marinade didn't seem to take.  Not sure if I did something wrong.  Based on most people's reviews, I was expecting better.

Very tasty for a surprisingly easy recipe. I didn't have lemon pepper so I just used lemon juice and black pepper. (although I hear you're not suppose to put lemon on the fish beforehand because it separates it?) Anyways I marinated it overnight and the results are fantastic. No sides necessary, very tasty ala carte.

To be honest I haven't made this recipe yet but based on the review I intend to this week. We eat salmon at least once a week.  I work for a wholesale/retail  fish market and we get lots of requests for recipes. I plan to print this one and hand it out. With directions to the web site. Thanks so much for something different.

Yummy.  I'm not a big fan of fish, and even I liked it.  I used it on the George Foreman grill, and it was quite tastey.

FABULOUS!  I made this as written except used only 1 lb of salmon filet and did not have anough time to marinate the full 2 hours.  I think I marinated it about 1 hour and then cooked on a charcoal grill on a cedar plank.  I am pretty critical of my own cooking and I thought this recipe was wonderful.  My measure is "would I be happy if I paid for this in a good restaurant?"  My answer was YES!  Salmon is one of the few fish the whole family will eat so we will up our fish intake with this recipe (budget permitting).

An overall good maridade.  Slightly sweet and almost gives the salmon a chicken flavor.  A good one for non-fish lovers.

Amazing!  This was a HUGE hit with my husband and children.  I ran out of soy sauce and substitued with teriyaki sauce.  I'll be making this recipe next time I entertain.

Very nice. I made this for a BBQ I had on Canada Day. I didn't have the lemon pepper and forgot about the garlic.  I only used the soy sauce, brown sugar and 2 tbsps of olive oil.  I marinated the salmon steaks for about 45 minutes and popped them on the BBQ. They were a hit!  I served this along with grilled asparagus (tossed in olive oil, salt/pepper & a squeeze of fresh lemon), a tossed salad, brown rice and some fresh bread.  It was a nice light dinner on a really hot day.

This was delish!  My husband had gotten tired of salmon with just broiling it so I tried this recipe and he loves salmon again!  I thought it would turn out to be too sweet but it was not at all.  I even marinated it overnight.  It was quick and easy and very yummy!

I fixed this using our charcoal grill last evening. WOW! What wonderful flavor! Hubby especially loved it and I used the leftover salmon to make salmon patties for lunch today and they were wonderful! Thanks for a great recipe I'm sure I'll be using over and over again.

Was a little bland for my taste, but I give it a 4 for the simplicty.  I baked this instead of grilling and the honey kept the house from smelling so fishy.

Absolutely amazing.  So tasty.  I read on another website that to cook fish on the grill, you should have it cranked as high as possible for several minutes before putting the fish on (they said 20, but that seemed like overkill).  This is supposed to sear the fish on the outside, as opposed to drying it out.  We had this with grilled asparagus and it was to die for.

This recipe made me look like I knew what I was doing! All my guests raved about it!  I bought the jumbo Costco filets and had leftover pieces that I didn't cook so I let them marinade overnight and grilled them the next day.  Turned out great like the first batch.

Since I've been praised so many times for this recipe, I think it's time I thank you Tina!  I don't eat salmon, but when I cook it for my guys, they always insist on this recipe! I served this at a family reunion last year (a big beautiful slab 'o salmon), and even my caterer-brother in law wanted the recipe!! Here's another few stars **********!!!!

Too rich for me. The first bite was great, but the more we ate, the harder it was to get down.

I put a clove of fresh garlic in the marinade along with some regular pepper.  Then just added the fish.  So delicious.  Probably the best salmon I've ever eaten.  I'll definately make this again.  Perfect for company.

I made the marinade the night before and put on the salmon in the morning before I left for work.  I also added some fresh chopped garlic.  It was perfect!

This was excellent!  I didn't have time to marinate the salmon long- I mixed all the ingredients (I used lemon garlic seasoning and kosher salt)in the bag and left the salmon sit in it for about 15-20 minutes while the grill was heating up.  Then I just basted the salmon a couple of times on each side.  I grilled it skin side down first for about 8 minutes then when I flipped the salmon the skin stayed on the grill and when it was ready we got just fish. I cooked it 7 minutes on the 2nd side.  I coated the(we use a charcoal grill) grill with both veg. oil and sprayed it with nonstick both. This was SOOOOOOOO good, we will use this recipe again.

Great flavor. I only managed to marinate it for an hour, and I suspect it needed that extra hour (if not longer). You can cut the oil to 1 T, no need for more.

My fish-hating husband and picky 1-year old son gobbled up this salmon... that made a believer out of me!  Very tasty, and SO easy.

I eat a lot of fish and this is one of the best tasting ways to prepare salmon I have ever tried. One word of caution: handle your plastic bag very carefully. I ended up wearing a good portion of the marinade but quickly forgot about the mess after tasting this a few hours later.

I had some salmon ready to grill and ran across this recipe.  I didn't have time to marinade it so I just brushed all sides of the salmon and put in on the grill.  I basted it often and was very pleased with the results.  It is the best salmon I've ever eaten!  My family loved it!  The only change I'll make next time is to marinade it in the sauce for the time recommended.  Thank you very much for the recipe.  10+

This was the first time I've ever made fish and it came out great! I marinated for 5 hours, and broiled the filets.  My mom used to make perfect salmon and now so can I! :)

Good.  I baked mine at 350 for about 30 minutes and it turned out fine.  I will probably use this marinade again.  I'll try grilling next time.  Salmon is always better grilled.  Thanks for an easy, good marinade.

Salmon was delicious!  I used the salmon in a wrap.  I sliced my salmon into 1-inch wide strips and marinated them for about 2 hours.  I slightly changed the marinade: 3 tbsp brown sugar, 4 tbsp soya sauce, 1 tbsp dark soya sauce, 4 tbsp water, 1 tbsp olive oil.  I baked the salmon (spoon some of the marinating liquid over the salmon before placing it in the oven) at 400 degrees for about 15-20 minutes.

This was an amazing recipe.  Simple, quick and easy.  I especially like the fact that you do not have to marinate it overnight (as I usually do not plan my meals that far in advance).   My husband said it was the best salmon he had ever had (restaurant or otherwise)  Thanks Tina!

This recipe was awesome, especially since I did not like Salmon until I made this for my husband.  He begged me to try it and I couldn't believe how awesome it was!  I did omit the salt, (doesn't need it),added Paprika, and also added fresh minced garlic.  5 stars from us!!!

My family loved this!  Even my picky 1 year old ate it up.  I have been making the firecracker salmon(also found on this site) forever but this was just as good but with a shorter marinade time and kids love the sweetness!  Thanks Tina!

Easy to prepare and a good flavor. Thought it migfht be a bit stronger in taste, but the marinade makes a nice carmelized crust when grilled which is tasty. I may add more lemon pepper next time around.

Pretty good recipe.  We pan-fried it instead of grilling, and it was just as good!

This dish was awesome and I am not even that fond of salmon!  Would try this marinade on tuna or swordfish too.

Ended up marinating this much longer than suggested but it came out great.  Used wild red salmon and cooked on my George Foreman grill as others suggested. Easy and delicious.

Fantastic salmon recipe.  I didn't have lemon pepper so I added a little lemon juice.  I also added fresh garlic.  It was to die for.  Thanks.

This is delicious.  I marinated it for 3 hours and they my boyfriend overcooked it on the barbeque.  It was still moist and delicious though as a result of the marinade.  Some marinades can make fish tough this one doesn't I guess because there is no vinegar in it. Still I would not marinate it any longer than 3 hours.

This was pretty good, I think I marinated my salmon too long because the flavor was VERY strong, will reduce marinating time next time I make it.

My family loved this recipe! My 15 year old son loves salmon and said this was the best ever. I marinated longer than 2 hours, so I think that helped seal in the flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was so easy and the salmon was the best I have had.  I didn't have any lemon pepper so I just used pepper to taste and added a teaspoon of lemon juice to the marinade.

Delicious!  The best salmon marinade I've ever tried.  Like others, I reduced the oil a bit, and I was generous with the garlic powder.  If you can, prepare 1/2 a day ahead to give the salmon more time to absorb the flavors.  Thanks, Tina!

I'm not crazy about salmon, but even I was able to eat most of this because of the delicious marinade.  We accidentally marinated it for almost three days (!) due to unexpected changes in plans, so the flavor was very strong, but still yummy.  A simple, mild rice pilaf went well with this, although I think green veggies might have been nice too.  Salmon doesn't get any simpler or tastier than this - try it!

My husband really liked this one, he doesn't care for ginger very much--which most salmon marinades include. However, I missed the ginger.  Still, it was quite tasty and I will be making it in the future.  (Half with ginger and half without) :) Thanks

My goodness what a tremendous recipe!!  I have a family of 4 and made 4 quite large filets.  My children were begging for more and were quite disappointed when they realized they'd eaten it all!  My husband (a huge salmon fan) said this was the best he'd ever had.

Very good recipe.  I added a little fresh ginger just to give it some extra flavor and I also changed the vegetable oil to peanut oil.  Everyone loved it.  My son (who isn't quite 2 yet) kept asking for more.  I will be making this again tonight.

Absolutely Fabulous ! changed the garlic powder to granulated garlic  since that was all I had on hand. My boys  ate every single flakey piece of the fish !! I also used my foreman grill it was done in no time ! and so so so great. I made some lemon pepper fried rice to go with it.. perfect pair ! Thanks for a great recipe !!

My husband loved this...his only request being that I marinate it longer.  I was short on time.  I didn't have garlic powder so I just crushed some garlic and threw it in the marinade.  I'm not a salmon fan but this did the trick since his doctor said that he must cut back on the red meat!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great meal, it made the salmon taste really good and for anyone who is not a salmon lover it is a must to try. I'me going to try using orange juice next time instead of the water.

The marinade was quick and easy.  I made it for a dinner party of my friends and they all loved it.  I modified it however, I didn't have any lemon powder or garlic powder.  I just crushed a clove of garlic and added it to the marinade.  Next time it would be interesing to add lemon slices in the marinade.  I also baked the fish rather than broiling it.  I kept some marinade in the bottom of the pan and it kept the fish extra moist.

this was very good. My DH who is not a fish fan enjoyed it and made comments about the next time I make it. 

He wants it to sit over night in the marinade.

Made it last night. I also baked it in the oven and then broiled for 5 min. as was suggested by other reviewers. My husband loved it! I found the taste excellent, fish turned out moist and with good flavor. I will add a little more lemon and garlic next time to make the flavor even more distinct.

Love it! We've done this recipe on the grill and in the oven, marinated overnight or just cooked with the marinade, and it's great any way. I like it a little better with some minced garlic...but any way you make it, it's simple and wonderful!

I can't say enough about this recipe.  If you don't like this recipe, you just don't like salmon.  I've been hooked on salmon every since I used this recipe.  Hands down, it's the best salmon I've had.  Thanks!

When I make salmon, I marinate it all night.  I did that with this salmon.  I used way less oil and added smashed ginger.  I thought this was very good grilled on my Foreman wannabe.

This is sooo good!  I omitted the lemon pepper and salt though. Also, I baked my salmon in the oven like the recommendations, and it was not enough time. I have to leave it in the oven longer, but it is great!!!

I've prepared salmon every possible way and this is the absolute best!  I did not salt the salmon before marinating, and used low sodium soy sauce, based on other's comments.  Yum!

This was very delish . . . even my husband who "said" he didn't like salmon went back for seconds.  It was 19 degrees outside so I didn't cook on the grill.  Instead I enclosed the salmon in foil and cooked in the oven at 450 degrees for 15 minutes then opened the foil and cooked for 5 min. more.

Salmon tasted good, but I have a couple recipes that we like better. Fun to try different ways to cook salmon. It is our favorite seafood.

Fantastic recipe- very easy with great results! I've also tried it with Rainbow Trout and have had success. Used about a pound of fish each time and didn't feel the need to alter the amounts given for the marinade. thanks!

My husband and I have made this recipe several times, and everyone raves about it. They always tell us that they can no longer eat salmon any other way without comparing it back to this recipe.  One thing though, we don't grill ours my husband smokes it. Thanks so much for this recipe a definite keeper and a must try.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! My husband normally does not like salmon, but even he enjoyed these. Since we don't have a grill, I lined our toaster oven tray with a long piece of foil and after placing the fillets in there, lightly covered the fillets with foil and followed another reviewer's instructions to bake at 450 degrees for 12 minutes then broil for 5 minutes, and they turned out so tender. Instead of using lemon pepper, I used a little lemon juice, and I used low-sodium soy sauce, and I marinated it in the fridge for about 45 minutes instead of 2 hours since we were hungry. We also used a large salmon filet we purchased from Costco which we sliced into about six long strips. I served the filets with sauteed zuchinni and white rice I cooked with chicken broth instead of water, and it was a great meal!

This dish was too salty for my taste. I even used low sodium soy sauce. Not bad. I might make it again and cut back on soy sauce. Husband really liked it.

I made this recipe last night and I was a little skeptical, but I was wrong.  It was super delicious, my boyfriend and I loved it and plan to make it again!  The only thing we did differently was that we wrapped the salmon and some of the marinade in foil then tossed it in the grill.  It came out perfect!

I am very new to the "cooking" world, but this dish turn out to be excellent and best of all, it is so easy to make.  I strongly recomend this. As an apetizer we made a shrimp salad and as side dishes mashed potatoes and string beans.  I was great.

Husband doesn't really like 'sweet' dishes but loved this way to cook salmon. He said it would be a 5 star if I doubled the sauce to serve on the side as a dipping sauce. Next time I will make two batches of sauce and leave one for dipping and one for the marinade!

Followed recipe exactly, and it was excellent!  Marinated for 3 hours, & broiled it (didn't take as long to cook, so be careful!).  I put about 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, & 2 Tbsp lemon pepper on the filets before marinating.  Couldn't really taste the lemon pepper, but I'd rather not have it overpower everything else.  Lemon & lime wedges squeezed on was very tasty though.  Hubby really loved it!  He couldn't stop raving about it.  Was as good or better than restaraunt broiled salmon.  As my hubby said, this definitely is a keeper!  Thanks Tina!

Wonderful, wonderful recipe. However, do not add lemon juice and pepper(like I did) instead of lemon-pepper seasoning. A nutritionist told me that lemon juice dries out fish. Therefore mine was a little dry but otherwise fabulous. If you love salmon-even if you don't love salmon, try this recipe!

A++++!! This was amazing! My 11 year old son, who does not like fish (let alone anything else) LOVED this dish, and my two little ones gobbled it up! They said it was like bbq ribs! DELICIOUS! Thanks for sharing it!

I love salmon, but I don't make it often because I don't have any good recipes for it...until now! I made this for my family and in-laws and they ALL loved it! My mother-in-law even told me it was better than hers! I will definately make this again, but I think I will try some of the other suggestions (although it is already perfect as is).

I don't even like salmon normally, This is just fantastic! Broiled or on the grill. We make this a lot. If you don't like this, you will NEVER like salmon.

A very easy recipe....I already had all of the ingrediants sitting around in my cabinet. :) I was a little apprehensive about the salty-ness of the soy sauce combined with the sweetness of the brown sugar on Salmon....but I must say, it is wonderful! In fact, I am making it again tonight. ;)

I really liked the way the salmon tasted with this marinade.  I might add some crushed garlic to it next time.

The only changes I made was using olive oil instead of vegitable oil and marinating the salmon overnight.  Instead of cooking it on the grill, I baked it in the oven and it was absolutely delicious.  Even my son, who is very picky loved the taste.  Thank you, Tina.  This recipe has become one of my favorites!

I thought this recipe was a good start, but I didn't think the flavor was strong enough. I did marinate this overnight but I think it needed something added. It was very easy, but I think I'll stick to the firecracker salmon.

man, was this yummy! i used low sodium soy sauce & marinated the salmon overnight. i also took the hint from previous reviewers & made a gravy by adding 2 tsp. flour (whole wheat) to the marinade.
we nibbled on the cold leftovers for the next 2 days. thank you tina!

By far the best recipe I have tried on this site! I would not change a thing, my husband who doesn't care for salmon much even LOVED IT! The salmon I used we actually bought for a different recipe and ended up freezing it and unthawing it still turned out GREAT!!!!!!!!!

Wow, so good!  I actually used it with Rainbow trout-- was a bit worried about the outcome but it was sooooo good.  I also did have lemon pepper so just thinly sliced a lemon and added some ground pepper.  I make something similar with chicken with pinapple instead of lemon and bell peppers to compliment.  Will definitely make this again!

This is a great recipe! I made it a dozen of time. My 17 years old cousin don't often like fish, but she love this recipe. The only modification I made is that I cook it in the toaster oven with the marinate. Also, I used the sauce from the marinated and thicken it by letting it cook on the stove top for a few minutes. Than, I throw different kind of vegetables into the sauce until the vegetables get a bit soft.

I made this as an alternate to how we usually cook salmon. I had to oven bake it but it still came out wonderful! Of course it's high in sodium, so won't make often, but definitely a fabulous indulgence. Oh and there were zero leftovers although I had 2lbs of salmon feeding four adults and one child.

This recipe is amazing - the marinade gives just a hint of sweetness which makes the salmon taste incredible.  It's quick to prepare and cook; by far one of my favorites on this entire site.

I'm not a salmon/fish lover but this made it good enough for me to eat some.  It helped take some of the fishy taste out.  I had salmon that I caught while camping last year not store bought which might account for some of the fishy taste.  My wife and kids liked it enough to try this again if I catch some more salmon next year.

This was delicious. I always rate everything by my kids' reaction to it, and they loved it. I had to broil it instead of grilling, but it was still very good. Will definitely make again.

I used my George Foreman grill and since I didn't have any lemon pepper so I used plain pepper instead. They were really good but I couldn't really taste the marinade even after marinating for 4 hours. I'll have to try the lemon pepper next time to see if it makes a difference (and there definitely will be a next time).

My wife loved it...I used half the oil suggested and it still came out great.  I followed the advice of one of the "raters" and saved the marinade.  Heated it with 2 tablespoons of flour..gravy!  Also, used low-sodium soy-sauce..never missed the extra salt!

I just made this for my husband, and he is raving over it.  I am not a big fish eater, but I had a little bite and I liked it.  This is definately a do again for us though since he is still having fits about how good this is.  Soooo easy to make and cook, even for a fish newbie like me.

Wonderful! My husband and I both love salmon and this is the BEST I've had. I didn't have lemon pepper so I used regular pepper and a little bit of lemon juice. I marinated it overnight and I agree with the previous entries - 2 hours just would not be enough.

This is a great recipe.  My family loved it.  I was especially happy since I had never cooked salmon before and it turned out so well.  The only thing I would do diffently is let it marinate overnight.  I can't wait to cook it again!

I love to order salmon when we go out but never had much luck with it at home.  This recipe is wonderful, and we'll do it again.  The only extra thing I did was serve with a lemon wedge.

This was so easy.  It was my first time cooking fish.  I am a self proclaimed kitchen klutz.  My husband and kids (9 and 4) raved over it and everyone asked for and gobbled up seconds. Thanks!

My husband and daughter loved this recipe and I will make it again soon.   Only substitution was ground black pepper instead of lemon pepper as I didn't have any lemon pepper.

This was super easy and had a wonderful flavor.  We cut out the salt and let it stew for about 1 1/2 hr.    A nice carmelized coating.

I made this for my husband, not for me as I do not like Salmon. He said on a scale of 1 to 10, it was definitely at 10. So, I tasted it... it was very tasty!! I will make this for both of us next time.  I put it on the grill and oiled the grill first, but it still stuck a little. Not sure on what to do about that. Maybe by lifting it after a minute to prevent sticking.  You must try this recipe, its great!

recipe was good, but the marinade seemed to fight the rich flavor of salmon as much as it brought it out, and i'll keep looking for good variations on this recipe

Fabulous salmon recipe.  I omitted the lemon pepper and just used regular ground black pepper. I used less brown sugar as well.  I also used a grill pan on my stove for this since it is winter.  I grilled it for about 8 minutes each side and it was perfect!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Awesome!  I added ground ginger and crushed red pepper flakes and marinated for two hours. I also cut back on oil and just added a splash to reduce fat. I grilled the salmon but I think it will be just as good broiled. Served this with the Syrian green beans (also on this site)and a bold red wine... couldn't ask for a more healthy, delicious meal.

I made this for dinner tonight.  My husband loves salmon and he liked this recipe.  I used fresh chopped garlic.  I only marinated for 1 hr,
as I was short on time, and it was fine.  I grilled the salmon on foil and served it with white rice and fresh green beans.  I will make this recipe again. Thanks.

Very good, but not really different than others I've tried.  I WILL make this again.  I found that adding the lemon pepper and garlic to the marinade itself worked just as well as sprinkling onto the fish.  Also, I eliminated the salt as even low-salt soy sauce added enough saltiness.  Thanks for sharing!

This was really simple to make and absolutely delicious.  My three kids ages 7,4 and 1 even enjoyed it.  I cooked this over a charcoal fire with a little mesquite wood.

Absolutely Fantastic!!!!!!
I am not a big fan of salmon, or fish of any kind, but my family is. Everyone loved including me. I did add some extra garlic, but this something I do to all recipes, because I just love it so much.
Wonderful recipe.

This recipe was awesome.  I made it for a dinner party and everyone raved about it.  I had to give them the recipe and several have said they would not make salmon any other way.  Am planning to make it again for Mother's Day.  It was requested by both my mom and my mother-in-law.

Lots of flavor.  This would also make a great marinade before smoking the salmon.  Very good, and my hubby even said it's the best way I ahve ever cooked salmon (and he liked the other ways lol).  Thanks Tina...

I can't believe how easy and tasty this was.  I only had time to marinate for an hour and it was so yummy that I gave my printed recipe to my guest.  We'll definately have this again.

Marinated for about 6 hours.   Grilled on my indoor grill.  Turned out great.  My husband (who isn't a fish lover) had second helpings.  My picky 6-year old ate about 4 small pieces, which I think is good!!   Definitely a keeper.

I do not like fish but my Husband LOVED it. It was easy I just prepared the steak and put the marinade in a zip lock bag, then in goes the fish,done. Fast and easy I love this recipe and my Husband like the taste. I was surprised that the other few users didn't like it. Maybe they should make sure their fish was fresh and give it another try.

I wont try this again - I was really looking forward to it - I allowed the salmon to marinate for about 6 hours - I like salmon but you expect to taste something other then salmon (the point of marinating) - It didnt taste like anything but salmon.

Absolutley INCREDIABLE!! I made it for my mom and my boyfriend..I am just starting to cook and IT WAS TO DIE FOR!! I grilled it on one side and then the propane went out on the grill(just my luck!) So I put it in a dish to cook in the oven and put the marinade juice with it and cooked it for about 20 min...UNBELIEVEABLE!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!! DEFINATELY A KEEPER!!

This is an excellent recipe! I let the salmon marinate for about 24 hours and it was terrific... my 2 and 4 year olds even loved it!

This is fantastic!  I marinated the salmon overnight and all the next day, and then broiled it.  It is incredibly delicious -- restaurant quality, if not better than most!  A must try if you love Salmon.

This recipe is the best!  I was looking for something different to do with Salmon.  We cooked it in the broiler instead of the grill and it still came out great!  My husband even liked and he does not like fish!  We're even having it again next week :)

Salmon was never my husband's favorite seafood, but I love it.  When I made salmon this way, he loves it and even tells other people about it.  Quite a change from past salmon dishes he's eaten.  We now have salmon regularly, and this one is so easy to make.  It's even great cold for lunch, plain or as a sandwich.

Okay, check this out....  My in-laws wanted to cook a salmon and didn't know what to do with it.  So to make myself a wonderful daughter-in-law I found this recipe and gave it to them.  They said it was wonderful, they did point out that when cooking fish you need to turn it a lot, so that it doesn't stick.  GREAT RECIPE!!  THANK YOU!!

i made this a second time and forgot to use the garlic and lemon pepper and i think it was still awsome. (broiling works good too)
