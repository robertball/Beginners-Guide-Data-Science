I really enjoyed this recipe. I didn't have any roasted red pepper in a jar so i followed the roasted red pepper recipe from this site. I also substituted two tbs. oil for some sundried tomato salad dressing. It turned out wonderful. will certainly make again!

I changed a few things to make it perfect and spicy.  I used fresh bell peppers.  2 red and 2 yellow roasted and skinned under cold water.  1 onion sliced, 2 garlic cloves, 1/2 tsp chili powder, 14-ounce can chopped tomatoes, 1 pound pasta shells.  Parmesan cheese to serve.

This was a good way to use up my garden tomatoes. I used fresh roasted bells as well, and it turned out excellent. The flavor was lacking a little something, so only four stars, but perhaps it was my taste buds. Enjoyable hot or cold. Used some immediately and froze some. Thanx Jennifer.

I made this with yellow tomatoes fresh from my garden and it was great. It tasted more like salsa, but next time I will use red tomatoes and I'm sure it will taste like sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

I liked this recipe a lot.  I roasted my own red peppers instead of using the store bought ones and also roasted and added some pearl onions and a few green chiles which made for a sweet, spicy sauce to cover my (almost) famous meatballs.

super easy to make, and I adore roasted veggies but it didn't "come together" for me somehow.  I roasted my tomatoes with the garlic for more flavor.  Also, I used 2 heads of garlic (not just 5 cloves!) for more flavor.  Is mellows out so much that you need at least 2 heads.  I've made similar sauces but with roasted carrots and onions added too.

No need to change a thing with this one! I made it exactly as written and it was perfect. I used about 1/4 tsp pepper and 1/2 tsp salt. I also used 6 roma tomatoes. The only thing I might suggest is to keep a close eye on the garlic towards the end. Mine was starting to burn. This is excellent cold or hot, but I chose to warm mine gently in a pot and served it over spaghetti squash with a sprinkle of parmesan. It is rather thin, so keep that in mind. I'm sure if you simmered it for 15-20 on low, it would thicken up some. Also, for those who don't like spicy, keep in mind that the heat is more prevalent once it's heated.  This one's a keeper! Very fresh tasting. Thanks for the great recipe, NUBBYJEN!

My family loves garlic but I didn't have time to add it. Whipped this sauce up (sans garlic) and added extra basil from my garden.  This sauce with soft goat cheese on top = PERFECTO!!! It was a huge hit with toddler and adults.
