Oh my goodness. I frequent this site a lot. I use the recipes a lot. But I have never left a review. This recipe was so delicious it prompted me to make a profile so I could review it! 

First off, venison is so tough and mildly gamey tasting. So, I have never been thrilled when my husband cooks it. It was always so tough and gummy. I felt like I would never chew it enough to swallow it. 

I thought it would be great to slow cook this type of meat to help tenderize it. I ran across this recipe and boy were we surprisingly impressed. I didn't change a thing in the recipe. I cooked it for 2 hours, added the carrots and tatoes and cooked it until they were tender. 

Then I served it over mashed potatoes. This was so good I wish my mouth was bigger. 

Try this, you will not be disappointed.

This stew was delicious!  I did let it cook practically all afternoon before adding the veggies - in order to make the deer meat extremely tender.  I also added more vegetables (corn, green beans, etc.)  This is a keeper!

We were trying to use up some of our stored venison and came across this recipe.  It was wonderful!  Even our neighbor who said she hated venison liked this stew.

For people who don't hunt. Would not know that you must soak your venison in cold water to get the blood out of the meat.  That is what causes the gamey taste.  We process our own deers and the quarters are soaking while I am processing other parts of the meat.  Try it sometime, you will never know it was venison.

I found this a very good way to use up the tougher cuts of meat on a deer.
I used brown gravy mix in place of the flour to
make a more robust stew.

LOVED IT!!!  I don't understand why people rate low because you can "still taste the deer" If you don't like wild meat, don't eat it! doesn't mean the recipe was gross! I ran out of worcestershire so i made a substitution with soya/hot sauce combo (yes this is a valid sub!) I also didn't have oregano and substituted it for italian seasoning instead.  I seasoned my meat with garlic powder, seasoning salt and roasted red pepper flakes and browned it with the onions in a frying pan.  I then put it all in a roaster and cooked it in the oven for an hour at 425.  I cut my potatoes smaller as a personal preference and added the potatoes and carrots and popped it back in the oven for another half hour.  This was an excellent recipe! The flavour is perfect,and the meat is extremely tender. Love it! will definitely make this again and again! thank you for sharing!

This was excellent!  I was out of potatoes so I cooked it without and served the stew over egg noodles.  Very flavorful and tender!  I will definitely save this recipe for the next time we get some venison.

This was the WORST recipe I have found on this webpage thus far.  My husband and I couldn't make it past the gamey taste (and smell)!

This is a great stew and easy to make. I took the advice of the other reviewers and used 3 cups beef stock and 1 cup red wine. I also added 1 8 oz can of tomato sauce, I usually add that to my beef stew. everyone loved it! I married into a big hunting family and my freezer is stocked with venison, this is a great meal! will make again and again!

This was delicious!  It was not at all gamey.  It had wonderful flavor and could have easily passed for beef stew.  I did not add oregano but I doubled the garlic.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

I took the advice of a few reviewers and came up with the perfect recipe for my family.  I soaked the meat in milk for 10 minutes (this also helps make the meat tender), instead of 3 cups of water I used 2 cups of water and a can of beef stock, and instead of using flour I used brown gravy mix.  Sometimes the carrots take longer, so I simmered for 1.5 hours, added the carrots, simmered for 30 minutes, then added the potatoes and simmered until the potatoes were tender.  YUM!  Can't wait to make this again!

AWESOME!
As a fairly newlywed to a hunter and having not grown up in a family with guns, let alone hunting, let's just say eating deer has not been my favorite time (even moreso as a former vegetarian). I'm the person at the dinner table that if I think too hard about what I'm eating is an animal, I get a gag-reflex. Needless to say, respecting the deer and finding recipes I can swallow has been a bit of a task. We've tried jalapeno burgers with lime mayo, bacon wrapped grilled backstrap, and all other combinations. I've found some to be edible, but this TASTED GREAT! It was better than any beef stew I've ever had, and I actually enjoyed every bite, going back for seconds. I finally have found a recipe that makes me say, "I love eating Venison". The meat was tender. We served it with egg noodles. Now I finally know what we'll do with all that deer meat in the freezer. I cannot thank you enough for this recipe. I have cooked using online recipes for years and never felt the need to rate one. This recipe caused me "sign up" just to rate it. If you don't think you like venison or think it's too gamey, you should try this recipe first. It was also very easy, especially on the weekend when I was doing other things, just letting it simmer. Thank you for the great recipe!

This is a great venison recipe. I used olive oil instead. And saut√©ed the onion and garlic (6 large cloves) with the venison with salt and course ground black pepper.  Then put it in the crock pot with the rest of the ingredients and added a few tsp of "Better than Bullion" beef bullion and reduced the salt just a bit. Crocked on high for 5 hours Turned out tasty and tender. Absolutely no game taste. Yayyy!!!

This recipe was great. The spices used really bring out the wonderful flavor of venison.
To the reviewer who left about "gamey" flavor--next time, be sure to clean off all the fat from your venison. That is what causes "gamey" flavoring in venison, not what you use the meat in (stew, roast, etc).

I've been making this for years However I add 1/2 cup of beef broth for a little extra flavor! I noticed several comments on this and other venison recipes about the "gamey" taste. I was always taught to soak the meat in milk for 10-20 minutes, then drain in a strainer over the sink before cooking! I have cooked deer meat without doing this before and I can taste a big difference! This goes for any fresh game. Hope that helps.

I think it's sad someone gave this zero stars because THEY don't like venison flavor. As a VENISON stew (which is gamey, come on folks) it was excellent! Will make again and again.

We liked this stew very well, but I'm mystified as to why no one has mentioned the obvious problem with adding 1 Tablespoon of salt to a stew with only 3 cups of liquid; that's a teaspoon of salt per cup plus whatever salt is in the Worcestershire sauce!!!!  Yikes!  I assumed it was a typo and added just 1 teaspoon.  I also used 4 cups of beef broth and 1 cup of water to increase the liquid.  Adding a stalk of chopped celery with the onions and a can of green beans with the veggies added even more flavor.  Overall, a delicious winter stew.

Quite a good meal! I actually made this in double because I had four pounds of venison that I had defrosted (between a roast and a back strap). I actually didn't use the veg. oil, but rather cooked the venison in bacon fat (used an entire package for the double batch) and then also added 1 lb of celery and 2 packages of mushrooms. In addition, i used very little water, instead i used beef stock, and i also used prior reviewer's recommendations to use brown gravy mix instead of flour.  I also added a few more spices (such as rosemary, basil, etc,) and used salt and pepper to taste. I have a great amount left for me and the roommate as well as some portions for family members. This is a great alternative to the chili I usually make. Great meal that everyone has raved about!

The stew was fantastic, however 3 cups of liquid does not make a stew.  In fact I checked my meat and onions at 1 hour and the water had all simmered out.  Next time I will use 4 cups of water and 2 cans of beef or chicken broth.

I am a chef I use this site for a base then I add my ingredients. when u coo deer meat u can soak in beer and Italian dressing or red wine it will take out the game taste. I hear people complain about deer meat.  i hunt deer i been eating deer meat since I was young. When u make stew.  the stew meat is a muscle so u braised it for a couple of hours and the muscle tissue will break down.....

This tastes better than the beef stew I've made in the past! I can't suffer even mildly tasting venison and this had none. However I did marinate the venison in a can of diced tomatoes for about 5 hours. I have been told the acid in the tomatoes breaks down the gamey taste. I think the tomatoes enhanced it wonderfully!

Oh.  My.  Word.  This stew is awesome!  The only change that I made was using beef stock instead of water.  Because of this I didn't add the salt.  It was AMAZING!

Holy Moly, this was good! First time attempting to cook venison and I am glad I picked this recipe. I took the suggestions of others and browned the meat with brown gravy mix used in place of flour. I also used beef broth instead of water and added a splash of red wine (which I usually will do when cooking with beef broth). My husband raved about it! He took it to work for lunch and shared some with his crew, they were also floored! Will make again, trying with beef as well. Thanks you Buchko!!

I've never rated anything on this site before, but this stew was so absolutely fantastic that I must tell the world about it. Served a giant pot of it at a party last night, and I was getting anxious that I might not have any yummy left overs. I even dreamt about it in my sleep -- it was just that good. 

If you're planning to cook this, I'd say adding even more vegetables wouldn't hurt; mine came out a bit meat heavy (but delicious!). Also, when combining the last bit of flour and water, make sure it's stirred evenly in a separate bowl before adding to the stew to get that smooth gooey texture. Ok writing this review is making me hungry. Happy cooking!

Very good stew-no hint of gaminess, and I was looking. I was also leery of adding Worcestershire sauce for fear that it would overpower the dish, but that was not the case. Cooked this on high for 4 hrs in a crockpot with a splash of red wine (imparted a full-bodied flavor) and a third of the salt (1t total); it would have been too salty except for the bed of noodles accompanying. I will certainly make it again, maybe with the addition of mushrooms.

This was so good!  I'm not a big venison fan, but we have a ton in the freezer to use so I tried it.  It was fantastic.  I did soak the meat in milk before browning it to get rid of the gaminess as much as possible and I brown it with the onions.  I also used a combination of red wine and beef broth rather than water.  It was a hit and was a perfect cold weather meal!

I am not a fan of venison, but my entire family is... so I decided to try this in hopes that the garlic and onion would mask the gamey taste of the venison. It turned out great. Noone even realized it was venison and it was so tender. I will definitely make again.

To get rid of gamey taste it is all in prep age your deer in fridge for 7-12 days then cut out all slivery tendons and all fat, seal or wrap in freezer bags and freezer paper , after cutting into small stew pieces and this recipe is amazing I added large egg noodles and cream of mushroom to make more liquid. Delicious.

those that complain about gamey taste should shoot better deer. We cut up our deer, not a gamey smell at all. We'd had one another time and the smell was awful. Soaking it in milk will remove the gamey taste if you need to. For those of us that shoot deer that's not gamey, we don't need to do this!

I added fresh cherry tomatoes and celery. I also used 1/2 merlot red wine and beef broth instead of the water. My husband also added 1/2 of a beer. He added hot sauce to his when it was done. We cooked it in a dutch oven over the campfire. It was so good!

I also found this to be very gamy the first day I made it.  It was almost inedible.  I then threw in a can of tomatoes and put the pot in the fridge for 2 days.  The stew tasted much better after that and most of the gamy taste was gone.  Next time I may use part wine instead of water during the stewing phase.

Best Venison Stew EVER! Well actually, it was the first time I made it. So delicious! I used the crock pot on low, took around 30 minutes prep time, (prepared at noon) and by 6PM it was done! I didn't soak the venison overnight, just rinsed it in cold water and salt before I browned it in the frying pan. No wine needed, just put a bit of water in with the worcestershire sauce to deglaze the pan for that nice brown gravy. Put the veggies in at the get go. Then before serving I turned up the crock pot to high, mixed the flour and water to thicken the stew, added that, five minutes later it was ready! I loved it!

Absolutely delicious!  I made this exactly as directed, minus the bay leaf (I never have liked the taste of bay leaves).    I saut√©ed the onions with the meat for a few minutes before adding the water, and might add diced celery at this point next time.    We ate it as is, and I would only serve it over rice or noodles if the potatoes were omitted.    I might add some frozen peas near the end of cook time next time I make this.

Great taste, but the recipe seems off to me.  I only used 1 lb of vension, 3 medium potatoes and 1 cup of chopped carrots with 1 chopped onion.  I used the 3 cups of water.  I feel if I had used all the potatoes that this recipe called for, then there would have been little broth.  I didn't use the whole 1/4 cup of flour either.  More like 1 heaping TBSP with 1/4 cup cold water shaken in my tupperware shaker, then stirred into the bubbly mixture to thicken.

Made this and loved it! I did do it in a Crock-Pot. Low for 12 hours. And I switched out the water for beef broth. It was a huge hit. I don't get why anyone would rate it one saying they still tasted the venison or it was gamey. It is a wild game so if you don't like wild game don't make it.

BEST recipe overall by far online.!! #1 if you have not prepared your venison properly before cooking, do not blame the recipe. You do NOT need to soak, marinate or otherwise do anything to venison before cooking. If it has a gamey or off taste, it is because it was not cared for properly in the field or in butchering. This is not the place to educate you on proper field care but please read up on it thoroughly. Venison is food and you don't  let it "hang" for a week before cutting it up. Get it packaged and into the fridge ASAP! Most "gamey" venison is so because it is beginning to spoil. **********

    That said, this is a very good recipe. Granted, I don't measure the meat and veggies. I always add extra meat and toss in extra veggies to account for that. Important, make sure that you trim ALL fat from off of the meat. Venison fat is strong tasting so remove it. I use bacon fat instead of the oil to initially cook the meat. I also add in a cup of burgundy. After the veggies are cooked I also throw in a quantity of assorted chopped mushrooms (shitake, crimini, ect.). At least 4 cups worth as they cook down. I have a gas stove and let the pot sit on low on the back burner for several hours. Stirring once in a while. I don't add the flour until the very end because, after that, it can burn on the bottom if you aren't stirring it frequently. I regularly double up this recipe X2 and make @ 4 gallon batches. Divide it up into portions for two and freeze or put into smaller stor

My husband and I made this recipe last night.  We thought it was very good, but plain.  I'm giving it 5 stars because my 7-year old daughter LOVED it, and asked for seconds.  She usually won't eat anything with ingredients that are mixed together.  If you are looking for simple, warm, comfort food, this recipe perfectly fits the bill.  NOTE:  Use either doe meat or a young (button) buck if you want yummy venison meat without having to soak in milk or rinse a million times.  IMO big bucks taste awful, and I only use them for sausage.

I made this in the crockpot for 4 hours on high with buck steaks. I rinsed the buck steaks in cold water before starting and added all ingredients to the pot after browning the meat in a skillet with onion and garlic. I only had 1 onion (added some onion flakes), 2 potatoes, and added celery. Very good, not gamey, tender meat.

Used beef stock with the flour at the end and found it added a little extra body to the dish. This never lasts more than two days in our house. Fantastic with room to adjust/add anything to it.

This was excellent! I had two small deer roast and soaked them over night in vinegar and water, cut into chunks and marinated in vinegar and water again, another 24 hrs. until water turned clear (have to change it several times) I coated the deer meat in 1/4 flour (maybe a little more) and browned it up with onions and garlic, I used 3 cups of unsalted beef stock (can't have a lot of salt)added meat after browning then added one can of unsalted diced tomatoes(with oregano, basil and garlic) Worcester (had enough salt from this) sauce 2 TBS, oregano, 2 bay leaves, cooked the venison for an hour in pot then added chopped carrots, cooked about 40 mins added potatoes and celery cooked another hour. it thickened up nicely as it cooked didn't have to add any thickner....family loved it was all gone! I will definitely make this again excellent recipe could not tell it was venison.

Worth more than 5 stars!! I followed exact save 1 onion, and this was so tender and GREAT! Maybe helps having fresh deer? Killing and dressing correctly also makes a world of difference in taste. This is a repeat recipe!

I was looking for a venison stew recipe and this one was a winner.  I didn't have any potatoes so I used celery instead and served it over gnocci.  My kids went back for seconds and my hubby asked when we were going to have this again while he was still eating.  Next time I think I am going to cut back on the salt and add some pepper to the meat as it browns. I liked the addition of the celery and will probably double the oregano.

Excellent - not a huge venison fan but my husband is a hunter so we always have a freezer full.  This is, by far, my favorite venison recipe so far.  Didn't add potatoes to the stew but instead served it over mashed potatoes.  Will definitely be making it again.

I added about a tablespoon each of Thyme and Rosemary in addition to the Bay leaf (I used about a tablespoon of dried bay leaves).  I increased the water from 3 cups to 6 cups which meant I doubled the flour and water to thicken it.  I also added 3 cans of drained corn, lima beans and peas.  This recipe is awesome.  My mom even loved it and she is really picky about deer meat.  Said there was no gamey taste!

Made a couple small changes, added a touch of Chili Powder to the spice mix as well as diced tomatoes.  Less water because of the liquid in the Tomatoes and it was Delich!

I fixed this stew exactly as stated except I didn't have one pound of carrots.  My family thought it was a little salty, so next time I will cut down on the salt a little.  It will certainly be a keeper in our house.

I thought this was very good!  People have commented on the "gamey-ness" of the stew and I think that really depends on what kind of deer you use.  We used doe meat because I think buck meat is way too gamey, and the doe meat was delicious- didn't even know it was deer!  I too let it simmer all afternoon and the meat was quite tender!

This recipe was a good starter. I made some changes on the 2nd batch, doubled the garlic, added a cup of leeksand mushrooms, replaced half of the water with, hearty, bold red wine, a Cab would work well. I used Fortessemo jug wine. Also I didn't have the full amount of venison, so I added some beef bottom round.  I think the wine killed the gameyness.

What a great stew.  Just used Mule Deer and Black Tail stew meat in this recipie and everyone loved it.  Great with a flaky crust french bread with butter and a ice cold glass of milk.  Lasted me and my wife for 4 days, and it only gets better with age.

I was surprised to read how many people soak the deer meat before they cook it. I've never done that or even thought of it. Anyway this stew came out great. I already had it in the slow cooker when I came looking for spices that others were using. The only thing I did different was for the juice. It was just way to thin for the way we like it. So I got 2 packets of Pioneer brand brown gravy and added it to it. Came out perfect. My in laws both swear they don't like deer meat. They went back for seconds. My father in law couldn't get enough. Shhhhhh don't tell him.

So good! I also used beef stock and a brown gravy packet instead of water and flour. Everything else was just like the original recipe and it turned out perfect! And to remind people who don‚Äôt understand game meat, you can soak the meat in cool water to get the blood out of the meat and there will be absolutely no gamey flavor. There were no leftovers... so that was the only downside!

I made this for my husband. We've never had venison and a friend shared some with us from a hunting trip. 
This came out AMAZING!!!!!!! OMG! 
Yes, this is the recipe to follow. It's delicious!!! We had it with giant egg noodles but it's also savory with homemade cornbread. I feel victorious!!!
You cannot mess this up. Just follow the recipe. DELICIOUS!!!!

This was very good and very easy. I soaked the venison in milk for 24 hours (may help to reduce gaminess) and dredged the meat in flour before browning it. I made it in the slow cooker with extra veggies. Family asked me to make it again. Add Cabbage, tomatoes, parsnips, turnips, etc.

Very easy and simple but delicious! When I added the other veggies I also added a can of diced tomatoes with the juice and I shook the meat in flour before browning and then omitted the flour later. But followed the recipe otherwise and it was amazing! Would definitely make again!!! Family loved it.

As a full time resident of New York City, I don't get a chance to cook venison very often.  This year a hunter friend from work gave me some venison stew meat and I sought out this site for a reliable and good recipe as always..

I was so rewarded with this one!!! It was easy to prepare with cabinet staples and very good and tasty.....As Dina mentioned in her 2011 review you must always soak the meat in cold water...My North Carolina grandmother taught me to do that plus add salt to the water which you frequently change until the water is clear....I allow about 8 to 24 hours of soaking before preparing any venison recipe...Do this and you will have a fabulous dish every time....

This one is a keeper!!!

I had a large crowd so I used 3 pounds of venison chili grind, cut up 4 large potatoes,2 cans of sliced carrots, 1 can of peas - then I doubled all the other ingredients and ended up at the end thickening the stew by using three quarters cup of flour and three quarter cups of water. For the meat I used 2 cups of water, and then added 6 cups of beef broth. I personally don't care for onions, so I blended them up along with the garlic,with 2 cups of the water I used. I just served them with bisquits. Very good,everyone was happy with it!

Very good, I did add peas and corn but followed the recipe other then that. I don't  generally love venison, but my son and husband do. This made it very tender, and the flavor was great. Thank you, I will be using this again and again.

This was AWESOME! Very,very good stew. I also used two cups of beef broth and one cup water vs.the three cups of water like some other folks. I also added about 1/3 cup of red wine and some green beans. I took my time adding the flour so it was just the right consistency. The meat was so tender, it melted in your mouth. 

To the one or two  folks that comment on the "gamey" taste, I would suggest checking on your venison before blaming the recipe to see if the issues is with the meat. No recipe can fix that. I killed my buck on Saturday and very carefully processed him, to produce this awesome stew on Monday. Thanks to all for their input! This is a keeper!

We did not like this recipe.  My husband made it.  I double checked it because it was not a pretty brown like the pictures.  And I still don't know how it would be anything other than a potato/watery/soupy mix with venison in it.  And, that is what it was.
So, I'm not even going to try to fix it.

I've been processing and eating my own venison for many years . I made this with addition to two things - morel mushrooms I had kept dried , rehydrated and used the water from that to make brown gravy mix ...so rich and hearty. If your venison is "gamey" its usually because of poor handling before or while the meat is being processed.

Delicious!!! I have to start off saying that I am not a venison person, however, my husband loves to hunt so we have a freezer filled with venison meat. I have been extremely nervous about cooking venison because I've had it in the past and it was terrible. Just awful!! My husband said that the meat was not prepared or cooked properly. After reading some reviews I soaked the meat in water for 15 minutes to get rid of the blood (thank you Dina). I then marinaded the meat for 2 hour in my homemade Italian marinade. I followed the recipe from there. I did add celery along with the carrots & potatoes as well as a can of corn the last 10 minutes of cooking. I added those vegetables because I have a 3 & 1 year old who loves corn and celery. They gobbled up the stew. The 1 year old had thirds along with my husband. I was extremely surprised with how tender the meat was and how tasty this dish was. Going to be making this again & again!!! Thank you Buchko!!

This was excellent, hearty and full-flavored. I followed the recipe exactly except that I added about 1 tsp. chilli powder and 1/2 tsp. ground black pepper for a little more kick. Thank you for a great recipe!

My husband loved this! I put this in the crock pot after browning the meat and and onions, and cooked on high for 1 hour and low for 5 hours. I added the carrots and potatoes after after 3 hours, and thickened with water and cornstarch about an hour before serving. I also substituted a can of beef broth, a half cup of burgundy wine and a half cup of water for the initial 3 cups of water. Thanks for the great recipe!

i am surprised when people complain about the recipe retaining the gameiness of the vension.  Excuse me, I believe we're cooking venison here!
Anyway, I used this recipe with a bit of my own addition such as red wine and  it was delicious.  To be perfectly honest, I am afraid the gameiness was cooked out too much.  The reason I like venison is the gamey taste.  The recipe was easy and I think the results were excellent.
I don't think of venison as a cheap meat I get from my hunter friends that I try to make taste like beef.  I enjoy it as its own meat with its own characteristics!   VENISON! YUM!

Sooo good! The only things I changed were using beer in place of half the water and added a can of diced tomatoes. Best stew we've ever had and hubby loved it. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was right on for us! I used stock that I made from leftover chicken, the venison trimmings and two mashed tomatoes instead of the water and cut out the flour entirely. I also only used two potatoes and added yellow squash and zucchini from the garden in place of the rest.  Also tripled the garlic and Worcestershire. Everything came out perfect. Perfect consistency, perfect juicy meat, right salt balance, perfect. As for everyone complaining about "gamey" flavor... It's venison. It's game. Learn to love it or go back to beef. Don't eat a potato and complain that you can't get it to taste like an apple. Personally, I think that flavor is the beauty and character of venison.

The "gamey" aspect of the venison has nothing to do with the recipe, but reflects poor preparation of the venison. It needs to be frozen after butchering, then thawed and washed/soaked in cold water.

After initial brazing of the meat, once the blood cooked out of the meat, I rinse the meat in a colendar and removed nearly all the gameyness.  Then finish brazing with the recommended recipe items.  This came out A+ with no gamy flavor at all.  Yummy!

This recipe is a KEEPER!!!!! My family LOVED it, which is a rare thing for EVERY member of my family to love it!   I changed just a couple of things tho, I deglazed my pan with some red wine then added that all to the stew, I also added some corn about 2 cups, doubled the water and added 3 cubes beef bouillon, and also added some quick barley. This is an AMAZING stew, one you will LOVE and WILL make again!!!!

This was really good.  I made minor changes: I marinaded the meat for a few hours first; beef stock instead of water and salt; used less onion; added celery and mushrooms; Italian season instead of oregano.

Made this using pronghorn (antelope) instead of venison.  Also had an open container of beef stock and used three cups of that instead of water.  I am hesitant to rate with a superlative but it was excellent.  
I can think of and will try several variations:  chicken stock instead of water; thyme or fresh rosemary instead of oregano; adding celery and/or quartered onions with the other veggies (I see v2 has done some of those things.)

Properly handled and prepared venison should never taste excessively gamey. I used this recipe with a deer I harvested last season and it was excellent. Instead of a skillet I used a slow cooker and cooked it for several hours.

This was great!  It turned out very tastey.  I didn't think it would have much flavor because it doesn't call for much spice but I was pleasantly surprised.  Thanks!

So tastey! The venison was tender and tasted perfect.  I did not add potatoes to the mix but rather put the stew over mashed potatoes. It's a family favorite!

Made this one yesterday and got great praise and everyone took seconds. Only changes were to soak in 1/2 cup vinegar and water to cover for 2 hours then soak in milk to cover overnight. Rinsed then followed recipe with slight changes. Did not have Worcestershire, used about 1 tsp coarse salt, water with enough beef bullion paste (low sodium) to make 3 Qt broth. I used more potatoes (9) and 2 LB carrots cut into about 2 - 3 inch pieces and split it too thick (more than 1/2 inch diameter). Served with hot cornbread. Yummy!

Good and will make again.  I marinated the meat the night before.  See Marinate for Venison this site.  Discard marinate brown meat and cook in slow cooker (with liquids) for three hours on high.  Then add veggies.  Cook until done (3 hours high).  Add thickening and season to taste.

So simple.  I was out of Worcestershire so I substituted 1/2 soy sauce and 1/2 A1.  I didn't have potatoes and served in on top of kasha.  Very tasty and so easy.  I'll keep it as a standby.  I did serve it to company and everyone liked it (very casual party).

This was very good! I only had a pound or so of venison steak, but it seemed to be plenty. I added some celery and some corn to the stew to give it more substance. I'm not a huge fan of venison, but it tasted more like beef cooked in this way. It was a bit tough, maybe remedied by cooking it longer in the broth. Oh, I used a can of beef broth in place of two cups of water, and I splashed in some red wine as well. Veyr good and I will probably make it again the next time a friend gives us some deer meat.

My family loves this dish! Made couple of time already. To add flavour to the stew, I coated it with flour and browned it before putting into the slow cooker, added fresh mushrooms (I'm a mushroom person)and a little red wine just before serving. I also let cook it under med heat as I realised high heat with toughen the stew. Absolutely delicious!

I married into a family of hunters.  This recipe is the first one where I actually enjoyed the venison, not just tolerated it.  I thought the 1 tablespoon salt would be way too much, but I went with it.  It wasn't too much - just perfect.  The only change I made was to replace one of the cups of water with red wine.  I am making it for the second time tonight.  Thanks for the great recipe.

All in all a good recipe!  We ended up needing to add additional water about half way through, but it still turned out well.  I am not a venison person, but the rest of my family is.  However I have to say I cleaned my plate!  All though venison is high in cholesterol, it is low in fat, so it is a give take in the health dept.

Very good recipe!!!  My family loved it.  I used a can of beef broth to make up for some of the water.  I will be making this again.

this was excellent.  I also cooked in a slow cooker and also used beef broth for most of the water.  Husband was reluctant to try it but did say that he did like it.  Would definitely make it again and would even try with stew beef

Good overall. Not overly gamey. Hubby said it needed more flavor, though.

An absolute hit, used chicken broth and only 2 onions, pepper to taste and always use extra garlic along with the other ingredients and served over wide egg noodles.

This was surprisingly quite nice. My only disappointment was that it didn't have  enough deer meat flavor. I've tried making deer meat stew with beef bouillon like how I make beef stew, but the flavor of the beef clashes with the natural flavor of the deer. This recipe is good because it only tastes like the venison and is quite tasty. My wife found it delicious and not gamey whatsoever. Don't listen to others saying it's way to gamey. If you have the right cuts of meat and not some old deer meat that someone gave you from their freezer after sitting for several years, you should be okay.  This would be even better made from moose or elk meat.  I would want to try making my own stock from the deer bones for added flavor for this.   Otherwise salt and pepper to taste does the trick.

Have made this twice and everyone loved it. Made sure there was no gamey taste by soaking the diced meat in water for half an hour before cooking. Nice to have a simple delicious recipe!!

This is a very easy and one of the best recipes yet I've made.This was my first stew ever. I've grown up eating and hunting deer. So I love the taste but for the ones who don't like gamey meat don't buy it or cook it. If you soak it properly you can't even taste it. Deer is so much healthier and leaner then alot of other meats. This was amazing I'd recommend it to everyone...

Delicious! It was nothing fancy, but cooked with tender young buck meat, it was the perfect stew for supper on a bitter late autumn night. I added some peas, chopped mushrooms and a little more water before I threw the potatoes in, but otherwise, I did not alter the recipe. This is a keeper!

More of a soup than a stew and really really salty. If I made it again I would definitely cut down the salt and add something to thicken the water.

I have made venison stew many times and very similar to this recipe. I slow cooked recipe in crock pot which will make meat tender. I think the vegetable and slow cooking overlaps the gamey taste and will fool some people that it is venison. I added a tablespoon beef base, 2 stalks of celery, corn, and mushrooms. I thicken my stew with instant potato instead of flour.

Delicious! I made it twice and love this recipe.  To tenderize and minimize the game taste then soak in milk for 24 hrs.  I use buttermilk. Drain then continue on the recipe.  Super tender and so very very yummy.  I also use chicken broth that I make myself instead of water.

I had to add about 2 cups of additional liquid after boiling my meat for 2 hours; even with the cover on, it had cooked down enough that I wouldn't have had enough liquid to cook my carrots and potatoes.  I opted to use beef broth instead of water, along with about 1/2 cup of red wine.  Once the stew was done, it was really good, but I chose to add 6oz of tomato paste, a can of undrained corn, and 6oz of frozen peas to make it more to our taste.  Overall, it was really good, I ate 2 bowls.  I should also add that I am not a big fan of venison, but prepared this way it was good.  I diced it very small so that I would not get a big wad of meat in my mouth.

It was very easy and I had everything I needed on hand. We all liked it, even the 2 toddlers. The only addition I made was about 1 Tbsp of dried juniper berries. We would make this again.

I made it with Elk as written and loved by all.
Only reason for 4 stars was the prep time.  It's hard to do so much before work in the morning, but when we came home the stew was great!

I was never a stew eater but this recipe changed me. I had some venison given to me and I wanted to try your recipe for venison stew. Oh my, I couldnt stop eating it. The meat was so tender and the flavor out of this world. Thank you so much.

Too gamey? Cut an apple in half, and cook it with the meat and onions.  Remove the apple before adding the other veggies. Takes out any gamey flavor. Or just don't. It's deer meat. It's gamey.

Delicious & easy! I read a few bad reviews that said it was bland, watery or gamey and I disagree completely! First of all you need to reeeaally brown your meat to get that deep flavor going. Then you make sure to bring it to a boil and then keep it at a simmer, if it's not simmering the meat won't get tender because it's not going to cook enough. Last when you add the flour and water mix, let it come up to a simmer again to get rid of the raw flour flavor and to thicken. I feel like the bad reviews were due to personal error, not because it's a bad recipe.

absolutely wonderful and super easy to make.  i did add extra salt and pepper, as well as a stalk or 2 of celery.  would make this again and you could really make it with other types of meat as well.  i am disappointed that someone rated this 1 star because they didn't like the taste of venison!  that shouldn't affect the rating of this recipe and its annoying that i can't comment on that rating.

Had an incredibly delicious flavour right up until the flour n water mixture was added..after that it had a fairly bland flour taste to it...I only used half of recommended flour n water too. Any ideas?

This stew was great!  I did use beef broth instead of water and deglazed the pan I used the cook the meat with red wine and added everything, to the slow cooker.  I added celery.  I also used brown gravy mix the coat the meat with.  I added a mixture of half water and half flour with a little bit of the broth from the slow cooker and cooked that in the bottom of a big pot on the stove until thickened, then added the stew from the slow cooler to that and boiled it at the end to thicken up the broth, and it made a tasty stew.  My husband said it would probably taste even better the next day, but unfortunately there were no leftovers!

I am the hunter in my family and I thought I would try this recipe to celebrate getting my first deer. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! The recipe was so good that even my mom, who does not like meat from the field and prefers meat from the store, LOVED IT! The only thing I felt like I needed to change was the amount of liquid in the recipe,  I felt that there was not much when I first made it, so I doubled the water, garlic, oregano, bay leaf, salt, and Worcestershire sauce. I am going to make this again and I cannot wait for my friends to try this tomorrow at our Halloween party!

This is the BEST stew I have ever tasted and it was my first time ever cooking anything with venison. I must say...it was DELICIOUS!!! My 16 year old ate 3 bowls of it after claiming he would never eat venison...needless to say- he loved it! I  altered two things with the original recipe.....I used beef stock instead of the water and I cooked it in the crock-pot on low for 5 hours after I browned the meat. I will definitely be making this again: )

The only thing I did differently was to reduce the salt by half. Other than being a bit salty, this recipe was very easy, with things most everybody has on hand. My family LOVED it, and I will be making it again soon. I read one bad review while deciding whether or not to use it, and that person's problem is with venison, not the actual recipe.

My husband loved this stew, I'm not a fan of venison. My husband will eat this for every meal until its gone. Before cooking but after cutting I rinse the venison with water then soak it in milk for at least 30 minutes. Then rinse with water. This supposedly helps mellow the gamey flavor.

It was easy and so delicious.  I added lots of fresh ground pepper to the venison when I browned it.  I also added about 3 stalks of celery with the onions.   I used 2 bay leaves vs. 1 since I love the flavor of bay leaves.  Lastly I used 2 cups of beef broth and 1 of water when I simmered it.  When I added the flour I used 1/4 cup beef broth.  My husband is Italian and is very critical of American food but he loved this stew.  I will be making it again for sure and if I don't have venison, will use beef.

I made this for a church "critter" dinner.   It was very good.  I added celery too.  I also soaked the venison in cold water as another member suggested.   
I came home with no leftovers.   In fact it was gone before everyone got through the line. 
Happy Happy Happy

I only had 1 lb, so I halved the recipe. It wasn't enough for our family of four. Another issue I had was all the water evaporated while the meat and onions were simmering, so I added about a cup of beef boullion when I added the carrots and potatoes. Still not much liquid with the flour mixture. Let the meat and onions simmer for an hour and a half, as family was hungry, would recommend going the full two hours or longer, with more liquid. Overall, it was very good meat, just not much liquid. I would say three cups for the half recipe.

This was my first attempt at deer stew and this recipe worked perfect... I had some deer sausage that needed to be used up, so I sliced it up and browned it in garlic butter then added it into the stew. It turned out really good, my husband loved it.

I think this was a good base recipe. I have made vension stews before, but have a terrible habit of not writing things down, especially when it turns out great. So I was trying to find a recipe that might be similar to what I have made before.  As hunters, we love wild game.  But we both found this stew lacking something. Not sure what it is.  I will definitely make it again but work on figuring out that "something".

This is my go-to venison stew recipe. It always turns out great. I recommend using yukon/yellow potatoes so the potatoes do not disintegrate into the stew.

Yesterday I made this recipe and it was a whole success. The meat was delicious but also the potatoes and the carrots. I put organic baby carrots cut in half. Then, when the recipe was done, I added a few more cut in half as well, and let them cook by themselves until my husband came home, hours later. I have to say that my husband was delighted with it. He asked me again and again if I had ever cooked venison before, and I kept on telling him NO. He even bowed and made the reverence , LOL, and asked me to make it this way again but with beef. So I want to thank you for the ingredients, sometimes it is just that simple, instead of adding lots of ingredients. It was amazing and I have not yet told him I found the recipe here :D but I will! Thanks to the chef!

Wonderful! Except for adding some fresh parsley, I followed the recipe.  The venison was  extremely tender and the stew itself tasted great.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

Great, easy recipe!  Added some thyme and basil as well as three packets of beef bouillion!  Delicious!  Also substituted tapioca flour in an equal amount because we eat gluten free!  No problem!

Busy cooking it now... smells delicious! I added 125ml french salad dressing after browning the meat - which is Kudu from SA! Let it reduce and then added half a diced green pepper with the onion and other ingredients. Surprising hubby, wish me luck.  ;)

I have been trying different recipes for cooking deer for 4 years. My husband is an avid hunter and loves venison. I've found the winner! He asked me how I made it because he has never in his life had it any tastier. He said it was perfect! I'm so happy to know I finally found "the one". I didn't make a stew though I just cooked exactly as written minus adding veggies but used onion with the meat. He prefers it this way rather than a stew. I usually slow cook a roast. I wonder if this recipe could be adapted for a roast? I'll try it next time. THANKS!

I didn't have any worcestershire sauce so I skipped it and it still turned out great! I used vegetable bullion mixed with the water for some added flavor and ended up using more water than the recipe called for (although I think I also had more than 2lbs of meat). Overall excellent.

I have meant to leave a review but kept forgetting! This is delish! I only usually like ground venison and breakfast sausage. I read the reviews and soaked in milk sometimes up to an hour but not always that long. I have made this several times, shared the recipes with others who all loved it. Sue

This was so easy and had a great result. I followed the directions except for the water which I replaced with Campbell's beef stock. I also rolled the meat in flour before browning to make a gravy easier to make. The meat simply melted and had a lovely rich flavour. I will make this one of my favourite recipes.

I followed the excellent suggestion to soak the meat in milk, used beef broth and red wine in place of water, and added celery. Also added some dried shiitakes with the water they were soaked in. The result tasted more like a good beef stew than venison - not at all gamey. Served with crusty bread. Very tasty.

This is a great stew. Most of what I hear about venison being gamey is the fact of where your deer come from and what they eat. Here in the middle of Wisconsin are deer are grass and corn fed like cattle and taste just great. The northern deer eat acorn and whatever and taste very gamey.

My boyfriend is a hunter and got a deer this fall. Having never cooked venison before, I went online to look for recipes to cook the massive amounts of deer meat we have in our freezer. This recipe is AMAZING! It did not taste gamey at all, was very tender, and flavorful. I will definitely be making it again!

I didn't have time to do any of the prep work...just dumped the ingredients (minus oil and  flour) into the crockpot and set it to cook on high for 2 hours and then low for 4-6.  Decided not to add flour at the end and it turned out great.  Super easy and filling.  Venison was so tender and didn't taste gamey at all.

My family really loved this! I used ground venison because that is what we had and I doubled the recipe. I left out the flour and used 3 brown gravy seasoning packets instead. It was about the best stew I have ever had! Thanks for posting this one!

I love venison and have made stew many times.  The secret to removing the gamey taste of venison is to brown it in a little vinegar.  Also, it does depend on where the deer is shot (location).  Plains deer have a less gamey taste than mountain deer that eat pine needles.  It takes a little while to get used to venison, but now that I have, I'll never go back to eating beef. LOL!

My family did not care for this.  They told me not to make it again.  I think it was the oregano that just gave it an off flavor.  Will just have to stick to my regular old recipes.

It was alright. I had a beautiful cut of venison though. I had to add cornstarch to mine because it didn't thicken like a stew with the flour. I also added a little beef stew mix to it. I browned mine and put it into the slow cooker for 8 hours. 
For those that don't like the gamey taste, why the hell would you buy a game meat? Geez

Basic recipe is spot-on.  For those who like a more robust flavor, substitute 1/2 Cup red wine and 2 1/2 Cup beef broth for the water.  I also added the carrots after 1.5 hours of cooking (for a total of 2 hours on the stove),and omitted the potatoes from the stew.  Served this over mashed potato with gremolata (parsley,garlic,lemon zest, minced together) on top for those who like an extra pop.    Delish!!

I added 1 cup red wine in place of the 1 cup of the water. I used it to clean the pan bottom after browning the venison. I then simmered the stew for 2 1/2 hours on the wood burner.

This recipe is phenominal. I have made it 6 times now. I substituted the venison out for Moose when I ran out of deer. I put in an extra splash of worchester and more oregano than it calls for, because I feel it adds a bit more flaver, to my liking. The meat always ends up falling right apart like a long-smoked roast when its finished cooking. 

When possible, instead of browning the meat in a pan, I throw it in some tin foil with oil and worchester and smoke it with apple chips for about an hour. I think this helps add flaver to the meat that lasts through the simmering.

I was saddened to read that some people didn't like the "gamey" taste of fresh game meat.  There are many ways to keep that taste down if you know your guests are fussy.  After you defrost your meat [I keep mine in the freezer so it always tastes fresh] put it in a bowl, cover with salted water, cover and leave it in the ice box all night.  The next day rinse off the meat and and use it anyway you like.  You will be surprised I think.  It is always delicious.  Oh yes, this recipe is marvelous.  I have served it many times and the people don't even know they are eating deer!!  If they ask I am glad to tell them, but they usually don't.  Happy eating!!!

This recipe was ah-mah-zing! Don't change a thing :) For any nay-sayers, if the meat is gamey that is not the recipe that is the deer! I soak my deer in milk the night before and that can help with the gamey flavor if you have a gamey deer. Also, you could put in crockpot in milk on warm for a couple hours before cook time. Sometimes deer takes longer to cook since sometimes they have more game flavor. The 2 we got this year are not gamey at all thank goodness. Great recipe!

Very Delicious! One of the best stews I have ever made especially considering this is my first try at venison... A neghbor brought me up some fresh venison and this turned out amazing added mushrooms and used a brown gravy pack instead of flour/water at end yummmm! Anyone who didn't like this obviously cant follow a recipe or think outside the box by adding personal touches.

I never leave reviews but I had to leave this one because it was excellent. I didn't change a thing.

This was a very tasty stew. I received some venison stew meat( 330 Grams) from a friend and had no idea how to make it. Followed the recipe almost to a T, but halved the recipe and exchanged some of the potato for turnip cubed, added about a teaspoon of 'better than bullion', sauteed the meat, oil and, onions and garlic together. Then I put 2 1/2 cups water and let it simmer on low for almost 3 hours while we were at church. It was so tasty and not gamey at all!

Cooked venison for the first time using this recipe with a few altercations after reading reviews.. Such as adding beef broth, gravy mix, and more veggies. It's very flavorful and delicious. Oh, and I soaked the meat in water before cooking and it does take away the gaming taste.

Ok, this recipe is great but there are a few points.  I used SHANK meat from a young buck about 2 years old (this is the calf or rear foreleg) for boiling stew meat as this seems to make the best stew, this is meat you would ordinarily throw into the grind pile, considered "tough" with lots of connective tissue.  but it works great when cubed, browned, and boiled.
I also substituted brown gravy mix packet instead of flour and added an extra 1/4 cup of water and lots of garlic.
Great recipe and my wife and kids gobbled it up with a big helping of cornbread!!!

This was absolutely delicious! No gamey taste to it. I used cornstarch to thicken then liquid at the end.

This is a great stew.  As another reviewer suggested I tossed the meat in brown gravy mix before browning and also added celery and used cornstarch as the thickener in place of flour.  Other than that I didn't change a thing.  I let the meat simmer for a full two hours before adding the veggies then simmering another hour.  The meat was very tender and not at all gamey.

This was quite good, except I felt the recipe lacked the correct amount of seasoning.  Next time I will use beef broth instead of water.  All in all it was quite tasty and I am excited to have another venison recipe!

I'm not a venison fan, but my father had given me some and I hate to waste food.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The stew was yummy.  I only had 1 pound so halved everything but forgot to halve the liquid, so used 3 cups liquid (1 cup beef stock, the rest water) and used 2 T flour and 2 T brown gravy mix plus 1/4 cup water for thickener.  Probably used a lot less salt than called for.  Threw in some frozen cut green beans at the end

We loved this stew. We don't eat venison very often, but when I got some stew meat from a friend, I tried this recipe. Excellent is all we can say. We will do this again. Served it with some dinner rolls and butter.

Pretty good.  I was a bit reluctant to try this since it's venison, and I'm not that adventuresome when it comes to game.  Cooking the meat in a pressure cooker with minced ginger, garlic, and salt really helps liven the flavor.  It was cooked just perfect as a result.  I will make this again, but with beef.
