When it calls for butterscotch pudding, it means already made!  This is equal to about four of the serving size cups.  I made the mistake of using dry instant pudding mix and once I placed it in the bowl, I realized that the only moisture was from the eggs!  So, I had to go and rebuy all of the ingredients again!  

But, the other reviews were right when they said that this was easy to make!  I suggest using a mixer (the recipe just said to "combine").  It filled my house with a wonderful fragrance and looks  and tastes delicious!!!

My seven year old and I made THREE of these this weekend and I am NOT a baker, even with simple mixes.  Cooking yes, baking no.  Anyways, I thought I'd point out for others who don't know, the sugar and the chips won't completely melt, they will carmalize, so don't think you've done something wrong.  Also, if you pour all this into a 13 x 9 cake pan it will take about 30 - 35 min. in a 350 degree oven.  Everyone who tried this cake loved it.  Someone suggested using chocolate cake mix, chocolate pudding, and chocolate chips.  Now *there's* death by chocolate!  Enjoy!

i really liked this cake. but the only thing i would say is the problem with the recipe, is the butterscotch chip u have to add. mine all fell to the bottom and ruined the first cake, but then i made it again without the chips and it was really good. i say, make it without the chips, they fall to the bottom, and also they make the cake way too sweet.

I LOVED this cake and I can't bake to save my life. A few tips - a lot of people mentioned that the chips fell to the bottom. Toss them in a little bit of flour before folding them into the batter and they will not fall. I made a cream cheese frosting (butter, vanilla, cream cheese and confetioners sugar), and it was DELICIOUS! This is a keeper.

man this was good.  instead of butterscotch chips, i used chocolate chips and added only about half of what it's called.  the taste was wonderfully complimenting.  you can taste everything!  all the tastes are working together to make this delicious and easy (cup)cake.

I was a little skeptical about the idea of butterscotch cake, but it was requested for a birthday, so I tried it out.  I didn't do the butterscotch chips and I did use frosting instead of sugar, but otherwise followed the recipe, and we LOVED it!  Even my husband, who says he hates butterscotch, had two pieces.  It was SO moist and good. And no one will realize you cheated and used cake mix, either, it tastes that decadent. : )  Great recipe, thank you so much!!  I'm tweaking this to make chocolate cake for a party tomorrow and hoping that will come out just as good.

I made this into cupcakes and opted to mix the butterscotch chips into the batter.  I omitted the sugar and almonds and used a chocolate buttercream instead.  Nice butterscotch flavor, without being overpowering; however, I don't think they would have been as good without the frosting.

The pan size is big but there won't be any leftovers!  I used Jello pudding mix instead of canned pudding, which I couldn't find.  This recipe is a keeper.

Really, Really good. I made this because I accidently bought the butterscotch pudding you have to cook instead of instant. I didn't know what to do with it so I made this cake! I didn't use the chips on top but this cake is excellent without them.

This was fantastic with chocolate cake and pudding! i just used 4 of those little, ready-made puddings and made up the rest of the 1 1/2 cups with cream liqueur...iced with chocolate icing...the women loved them! Thank you for an easy yet delicious recipe!

Do yourself a favor..... skip the chips altogether. It is not worth the hassle. I had to fix the problem. Just leave them out. It is a good tasting cake. Nice and moist. I will make again.

This is SO easy, and SO good.  The sugar on the top is the best!  When my husband takes this to work as a treat, it is gone in a flash.  I have made with with chocolate pudding and a chocolate cake mix, vanilla pudding and orange cake, and the butterscotch.  It is endless as to the number of combinations that can be made with this. I put this in a 9x13 pan and it works fine. Just test it with a cake tester or toothpick to make sure it's done.

I used a 4-pack of SnackPack Butterscotch pudding and used jumbo muffins pans to make 12 individual cakes for my sons lunches.  The butterscotch chips didn't sink at all and the cakes were very light.  I did put a bit of melted butter and brown sugar on the bottom of the muffins tins since I wasn't going to add frosting.  Baked at 350 for 15 minutes (12 jumbo muffins tins...only about half full) and they were perfect!!!  Will be making again!!

Like others, my chips sort of sunk.  I did toss them in flour first, so they didn't sink all the way to the bottom.  Next time I think I will partially cook then add the chips.   Awesome flavor, very moist.  Already looking forward to trying different flavors of cake / pudding & chip combos.  Thanks for this!  It will be in my recipe box for good!

My son requested Butterscotch Cake, which I had never heard of.  This was so easy to make.  Everyone loved it.  My wife has a new favorite cake, now.  Next time, we want to try English toffee chips.  We will be making this cake for family & church gatherings, as well as for a treat at home.  Thank you for a great recipe Angie M.

Very good.  Didn't have any almonds so I added some chocolate chip along with the butterscotch and mixed cinnamon in with the sugar.  Served with Cool Whip on top.

Really like how easy this is, and of course the possible combinations are endless. I did find that the butterscotch chips were essential to getting that flavor (although maybe I am at fault for using a generic pudding mix, I wonder if going with Jell-O brand would have made a difference?) nonetheless I found that most of the butterscotch flavor came from the chips rather than the cake. The almonds add a nice touch, and my roommates and I really enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing!

This cake is very easy & lends itself to so many variations. I used a Devil's Food cake mix with the butterscotch pudding, then used a mixture of butterscotch & chocolate chips on top with chopped hazel nuts. The sugar gives a nice crispy touch. I used a 13 x 9 pan and baked it a bout 35-40 minutes. Moist & delicious! Definitely a keeper!

This is the easiest and tastiest cake I've ever made!  I'm not big into cake, but I hogged this one for myself, lol!  I didn't have any butterscotch chips in the cupboard so I sprinkled on some brown sugar. AWESOME!

Delish!  From reading other reviews, I would agree that this would work in a 9 x 12 pan, but I would recommend the pan the recipe states - jelly roll pan, 15 1/2 x 10 1/2 x 1 - for 2 reasons.  1) the baking time is only 20 minutes in a jelly roll pan, and 2) since the cake is thinner, you get more flavor from the chips per bite!  I opted for 1/2 butterscotch chips and 1/2 semi-sweet chocolate chips to balance the sweetness (tossed chips in a little flour before sprinkling on top to keep them from sinking to the bottom) and skipped the almonds.  I also added 1 tbsp. of veg. oil as I was skeptical about this recipe  not having any 'shortening', and used Jell-O brand instant pudding (prepared).  The white sugar sprinkled on top adds an interesting crunch, similar to that of a coffee cake.  The kids love this recipe - it is definitely a keeper, and I look forward to trying this with other flavors of cake mixes and puddings!

This was easy to make and came out very moist. It had a hint of butterscotch flavor. I used the individual (4oz) cups and could have added another one to add more flavor.  The topping didn't caramelize for me but it was crunchy and tasty.

Cake had a great taste and texture; however, I had a little trouble getting it out of the pan in one piece.  It might have just been me.

This is one awesome cake!  It was gone VERY fast.  I served with Cool Whip and it made a perfect combination.  Only one suggestion - that is to half the sugar on the top.  This will make the cake not too sweet and just perfect.  Loved it!!

we followed others suggestions of flouting the chips.....and didn't have flour so ended up using powdered sugar.  This definitely kept the cups from sinking, but we would have preferred the chops mixed throughout.  This is a VERY sweet cake with an awesome butterscotch flavor.  I can imagine a slice of this would be great with anything!

Wonderful moist cake. I added chopped dates and subbed cinnamon chips for butterscotch chips, and vanilla pudding for butterscotch.  I will use this recipe many different ways.  Judyd

De-e-e-licious!  I made just as recipe says, except no nuts.  And used suggested pan size.  I used Jello cook and stir pudding mix.  Husband loved it too.

I was looking for a butterscotch cake to make for the BF's birthday and saw this recipe.  I used less than a cup of butterscotch chips because I was afraid it would be too sweet, and instead of almonds, I used pecans (personal choice). I still found it a little too sweet and I am a big butterscotch fan.  Not too sure I would make this again.

You can do this cake in a regular 12x9 pan for a slightly longer time....also works with either homemade pudding/pie mix or premade from store. It is excellent and easy to make. One of the best cakes ever!!!

This cake is very easy to make. Easy prep, mixing and clean up...so simple that it would be great for kids to make as well and since I love easy stuff thats delicious I know I'll be making this again soon. For me the cake didnt turn out overly pretty...but no one seemed to mind. I probably doubled the butterscotch chips (and no they did not sink) and reduced the almonds a bit and I loved the melty then crunchy effect those and the sugar on top made. Definately I would say that caramelization made this recipe for me. No left overs of this cake will last long!

I enjoyed this cake, and I'm not really a cake person.  I subbed vanilla pudding for butterscotch, and left out the butterscotch chips entirely.  I am glad I did; the cake is sweet enough without the chips.  I didn't have a boxed mix, so I used the Cake Mix from Scratch and Variations recipe on here, then followed this recipe for the directions.  I baked in a bundt pan and baked for 55 minutes.  The only problem I have now is getting it out of the bundt pan.  It's not a bad cake, and I like the almonds, although now that I think about it I should've coated the bottom of the bundt pan with the sugar and almonds bc the prettiness will be lost with the toppings on the bottom.  Ah, well, live and learn!  Thanks for the recipe.

i was skeptical when i mixed the cake (the batter was extremely thick) and very skeptical when i pulled it out of the oven (it's not a pretty cake, at least mine wasn't), but after I served it for my mother in laws birthday and got rave reviews i'm a fan. the texture is extremely moist but not crumbly and it tasted great. i left off the carmelized sugar and added butterscotch & dark chocolate chips for a contrast, and iced it with a light whipped topping

I sort of combined the 'better than sex' cake recipe and this butterscotch cake recipe. The results were unique and delicious! I will definitely make again.

This is a great cake! My boyfriend wanted a butterscotch cake for his birthday, so I came upon this recipe. 
I used the pudding cups, which I hoped I was doing right. I did not put sugar or the almonds on top, instead I put butterscotch chips and chopped up a few skor bars and it was FAB! Im going to try doing a chocolate version next, or lemon?? you could really do any flavor.

This was easy to make and very tasty. Friend who requested this for his birthday was ecstatic. This made it into the permanent recipe book.
