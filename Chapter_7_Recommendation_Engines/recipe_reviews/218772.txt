Nearly like my recipe.  I never use tomotillos, I like to keep it all green chilis.  I'd add 3 poblanos instead of the tomotillos. -- Dan

This recipe is almost identical to mine. Serve in a bowl with fresh flour tortillas or use to smother your favorite TEX MEX recipes. For those of us in Colorado & New Mexico the green chiles are in, available freshly roasted & ready to bag, freeze & enjoy for the next 12 months. They should be around thru mid September or until the supply is exhausted. Or drive to the lanes east of Pueblo & buy them directly from the farm.

AHHH-mazing! I live in Colorado and have had some darn good green chili, but WOW.  I used approximately 20 fresh roasted green chillies and zero tomatillos.  I took cupfuls of the chili and put it in the blender to get more of a uniform looking dish.  I will be making this again, and often!

AWESOME RECIPE! I'm a Boulder Born - and - Bred gal and I've had great green chili but this is the first time I made it myself and I love it! It's the kind of recipe where you can make any adjustments you need to based on what's in your pantry and it STILL comes out awesome. I will save this for years to come

We really enjoyed this dish.  I did revise it;  some changes were based on ingredient availability and some were based on preferences.  
Added:  2 large poblanos, more tomatillos, whole onion, couple pounds cubed pork roast, couple shakes adobo seasoning, and canned roasted hatch chiles.  
Omitted:  Anaheims (not available), green bell pepper, beef bouillon cube, chili powder, and cream cheese.  
When ready to serve, I dolloped Mexican crema on top and we ate with warm corn tortillas.  Because I probably doubled the recipe (this will not serve 8 as written unless the servings are tiny!), we have leftovers, and I plan to use over cheese enchiladas tomorrow night.

My husband and I grew up in Colorado and LOVE green chili.  This was really good, but not as good as my father-in-laws recipe (hence 4 stars).  I made it in a pressure cooker (25 min/15 lb pressure).  We didn't add the cream cheese.

Don't know if this person is from Colorado, but this isn't the green chili that I ever had in the 42 years I lived there.  The traditional green chili is very simple:  Roasted Hatch chiles, jalapenos depending on personal taste, roasted and shredded pork shoulder, chicken broth, onions, cumin,tomatoes, and flour to thicken. Use it as a chili to smother things or just dip your tortilla in it!  So good!  (P.S. I did make this recipe and couldn't eat it.)

I like more tomatillos than suggested so I doubled the amount and added some cilantro. I forgot to buy cream cheese so I added sour cream but will try with cream cheese next time. Overall this was an absolutely delicious meal! It did not make 8 servings- more like 5 (3/4 filled normal size bowls). I suppose it could be stretched to 8 if served over rice. Additional notes: after sitting for 2 days we realized that the tomatillo was overwhelming in the dish. next time I will try the recipe as is and update again.

Going to leave in more of the seeds from the pepper, it needed some more heat.

This was really good for a easy Green Chili but I felt the cream cheese took away some of the punch.  I've made it a couple times, one of the times I added 1 cup of shredded chicken, more peppers and just a touch of the cream cheese----awesome!!

I followed the recipe closely, but not exactly. I left out the cream cheese completely, but otherwise followed the directions. The flavor was good and went well with the homemade tortillas I made.

Very YUMMY!! Great flavor, spicy but not too hot. I think next time I will double the tomatillos but that’s just a personal preference.

This was fun to make and so tasty!  I must have found some mild chiles, because there was no heat at all to this dish- but that didn't detract from the flavor.  I agree with other reviewers: next time I'll skip the cream cheese at the end, as that may have contributed to the 'coolness' of the dish.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this chili for a chili cook off at work and got disqualified. Everyone loved it and finished it off, but because it had no beans they said it wasn't chili, I didn't even attempt to argue. It is wonderful and my family loves it.

I would give 4 stars to any green chili recipe! I didn't make this, as I am a competitive chili cook, having competed in the ICS World Championships for years. I like my Chili Verde and so do the judges! I would substitute Cilantro for parsley, add Cumin (1 TBL /LB,) Mexican oregano (forget the beer) and use chicken stock. Looking for great green chili recipes? Go to the International Chili Society (ICS) web site. Enjoy!

This is awesome chili! I never thought of using green tomatoes (tomatillos) in a chili! I had some leftover beans that I JUST HAD to use, thus the beans in my photo. I used my own leftover broth from green chili chicken in the crockpot the night before (instead of the bouillon cube)and I was out of red tomatoes. No Anaheims here this time of year, so sub'd a couple of previously roasted and peeled chile poblanos. Great blend of flavors and tastes even better the second day!

This may just not to my liking. I followed the recipe with two exceptions: I had to sub Pablaneo or Anaheim peppers (my store was out of the Anaheim), and I used pork loin instead of pork shoulder. The veggies were too mushy, and the entire thing was too hot. I love hot, but this wasn't a good hot. Maybe I didn't roast the veggie properly, but this wasn't for us. I've tried one green chili recipe that I liked, I'm determined to fine the very best.

I made this for a fall picnic.  Big hit!  The flavor is absolutely delicious, very complex and savory.  I seeded the jalapenos, and there was not even a hint of heat in the finished dish.  I think I will leave some seeds in next time.

I did add the cream cheese, but I think I would prefer it without it.  I would rather add a dollop of sour cream at the table.

Excellent recipe.  I will make it again and again.

absolutely wonderful... more time consuming than the recipe states though.  but worth it!  we have made this twice.  the first time, used a bottle of ginger ale to make it gluten free.  the second time, followed the recipe exactly.  liked it MUCH MORE without the alcohol.

This chili was very tasty (and I'm hard to please). In my oven, 30 minutes of roasting was way too long, however. Also, scaled as written, there's no way this makes 8 servings. More like 3-4 medium-sized servings or 2 large servings. It was also WAY too spicy, but that was my fault, not having cooked much with fresh peppers.

I've been in CO for about 20 years now, and I've eaten and made green chili of all kinds.  This is very unique and amazingly yummy. Unlike so many reviewers, I used the cream cheese and I gotta say I like,no,LOVE, the creamy hit at the end. I'd not really used tomatillas in my chili before, but roasting them does it for me. Also, I buy green chiles in the fall and have them roasted, then I bag and freeze them, leaving the skins on. I defrost and peel them just before I use them.  The flavor is much better when they're frozen in the skin. I guess I used about 10 Anaheims and 5 Big Jim's in all. Absolutely will make this many more times!

This was excellent! My first recipe with a crockpot! 

My changes (since I'm pseduo vegetarian): 
-replaced meat with same amount of red skin potatoes, quartered (cooked with the rest of the veggies) 
-Used cheddar cheese for topping instead of cream cheese

Fabulous as is and substituted venison for pork and equally awesome.   This is my new favorite recipe.    Serve with warm tortillas.    Left cream cheese out and served with sour cream on the side.     Easy too

Added to it and made the most delicious soup!Since it was 20 below zero; I decided to make this into a soup after making it exactly according to the recipe and two hours into the crock pot. I added a little more beer, cilantro, small can of tomato paste and one can of tomato sauce. I then threw in two more beef bouillons,water, frozen corn and four diced potatoes. I put the crock pot on high for several hours and tested the potatoes. I served with sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese instead of adding the cream cheese. I received extremely high praise over the soup. I did serve with warm tortillas. We were so full, we could hardly walk so skip on the second helping no matter how delicious it is! Oh, I had already diced up the oven roasted veggies after reading other reviews.

We LoVeD this recipe. Like others felt that the recipe did need to be doubled (leftover reheated great on the stove) 
We only seeded half of the jalapeños and skipped the cream cheese cuz we like it hot. Will be making this again and have shared with a couple of friends already. 

Thanks for the recipe!!!!!

Started roasting the peppers the last few batches and that makes a HUGE difference.  I out them in convention oven, but a buddy of mine says he roasts them on the grill.  Yum, Yum, Yum!

This is the best version of green chili I have come across. It is amazingly flavorful, spicy but not too spicy. Just the right amount of heat, and pretty easy to make. I made substitutions with what i had on hand- used about 8 tomatillos, 2 lg. poblanos, and 6 jalapenos, no bell pepper and forgot the cream cheese. I also blended the roasted veggies then added to pork in slow cooker....Delicious. I think the beer really rounds out the flavors. Will make again and again! Thanks for this awesome recipe!

Good recipe. I didn't think I would like the cream cheese in chili as much as I did. I added a habanero pepper for heat. I probably will add two next time. Also, I think using a food processor after roasting the vegetables would be better than hand-chopping them for homogeneity, if that's important to you.

Pretty good - if you love the taste of green chiles. Leave out the sour cream. I also added pinto, kidney, and chili beans for a beany alternative.

I substituted poblanos for Anaheims and Serranos for jalapeños. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter. Great flavor and texture! I'll make this for years to come. Thank you for the recipe.

We will be entering this recipe into a chili cook-off. I do believe we will win hands down. Instead of using pork shoulder, I used preseasoned carnitas, I also used a frozen pre-roasted green chile. I love all the ingredients and the cream cheese was unexpected surprise for an added "secret" ingredient. Amazingly delicious and we will definitely be making this more often.

Made this to go with eggs for huevos rancheros. Nice flavors and a great recipe for crock pots. I left the cream cheese out since we are going dairy free for a while, but it was still delicious. Also served it with the Chunky Paleo Guacamole and veggie chips.

So I made this with pork sausage because unlike some people I don't live next to a butcher's shop. That worked out better imo because it's less fussy than shoulder. Other changes I'd propose would be that you drop the tomatoes entirely and just use eight tomatillos since they're closely related. As for the peppers, I only had two jalapenos, some of those baby bell peppers and a poblano and they worked really well despite not being nearly as many as called for. (although I plan on using more peppers next time). Other than that this is a great and easy to make meal that pairs best with the Spanish flan recipe also on here since flan is a cinch to make.

My initial "while cooking" taste did not get me excited about the final outcome however I was proven wrong! The flavor was delightful! I used pork I made for an adobo pork recipe earlier that I froze so my flavor may have enhanced the recipe. Regardless, I'm making again and will double it to have extras or to serve more than 4. Also, I did not remove any veins or seeds and the hot factor was pretty high. I enjoyed it but have a high-heat tolerance. Lastly, I intended to use hatch green chiles but I forgot! I'll make again this week and see the comparisons!

I recommend making this. Also, I used a Colorado Native lager beer my boyfriend selected since I'm not a beer drinker and used the whole bottle.

No true green chile uses cream cheese! Also, leave out the green pepper and you can use canned petite diced tomatoes.

I cooked it in an Instant Pot (electric pressure cooker).  I cooked it for 25 min and natural release after 25 minutes.  I can say this is the closes I gotten to making what the restaurants make.  Next time I am going to substitute with dry herbs than fresh.

This was a great base recipe. I had to make some adjustments based on what I had on hand and personal preference. After roasting my vegetables, I blended them to have a smooth soup. Instead of the beer and beef bouillon, I used chicken broth and chicken bouillon since I didn’t have beer or beef bouillon. I substituted sour cream for cream cheese as well.  Also, based on another reviewer, I cooked the meat in the pressure Cooker and then cooked everything except the sour cream under pressure for 25 minutes. We are this over rice with tortillas. I adjusted the recipe to 1.5 times and ended up with 5 meals.

Because i don't have a lot of time in the evenings,  i put a pork roast in the crock pot overnight on low with the seasonings. When i got home from work next day,  i roasted and chopped the veggies (including garlic) and threw them in with the roast.  I used a bay leaves as a best available sub for the beer since i didn't have any.  My whole family LOVED IT! Very delicious,  and we'll be making again.

This is great green chili on it's own or over top of whatever you like, a go to for sure.  I have made it with and without the tomitillos, we like it without.

I used pork loin.  My husband loved it.  Had quite a bit of heat, I put a dollop of plain Greek yogurt (substitute for sour cream) and enjoyed it that way.

I have made this chili about 3 times now and I absolutely love it! I followed the recipe exactly and it was awesome, so each time that I've made it again, I've made small variations and it's still been awesome! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made this just with jalapanos  using this recipe.  I don't live in Colorado anymore and really missed this. We use this to smother on borritos. Not an easy coast thing.

Really good.  I used tenderloin. Easier on the denture crowd. 
Nice over rice.

So so delicious - it was a hit at our Super Bowl party!  The guests could not get enough.  I used poblano chilis and jalapenos, in the quantity recommended by the recipe.  It produced a nice heat, with not too much bite.  I think I might add a few more seeds and membranes next time, and increase the poblano chilis by 1 or 2.   Will definitely make again...and again...and again.  I served over rice, but also great straight.

Love this recipe, first time making a chili with out beans. I did make the mistake of leaving the seeds in the peppers. Although it wasn't too spicy for me, others found it too hot to handle. I also added a poblano pepper to the chili, roasting it with the other veggies as well. Definitely a great addition to a great recipe!

After  reading most of the reviews, I ended up leaving about half the seeds so we like it nice and hot, I double the recipe and halved again the peppers, the cream cheese at the end really made it for me and one our most creative chef friends asked for the recipe....sign of a sure winner!

I'd suggest doubling the recipe, adding hatch green chilis, using a little chicken stock and like the others, I used Poblano peppers instead of Anaheim.

I had to use chicken bouillon as my daughter has an intolerance to beef but otherwise this was an amazing dish. I have never commented before but always check the comments as they are as important as the recipe itself. This one rocks.

Did a test run of this recipe because we are growing almost all of the ingredients in our garden and I'm trying to find recipes that are delicious and will freeze well when the garden gets out of control.

I ended up throwing in double the cumin and chili powder in the last half hour. It just wasn't very flavorful. 

A few changes...used chicken because that's what I had. I would prefer pork though. Added a poblano because the early summer peppers that I used weren't very meaty. Overall, it's just missing something. The cream cheese added somewhat to the texture but not to the overall taste. We served it over rice. I could see, with a little tweaking and maybe without the pork, that this could be a nice green chili sauce for when I make enchiladas.

I had never heard of "Green Chili" until stumbling on this recipe looking for a way to use up some of a 7# pork shoulder I cooked in the crockpot. Well, my deepest thanks to the author! I make tons of soup since it's such a great and enjoyable way to eat your vegis. My hubs and I both think this recipe for the  soup I made was the best soup I ever made. We were stunned at how good it was. 

I probably will annoy some people admitting that I modified the recipe and then am reviewing it, but it came out so awesome that I thought I should share. Here are my changes: I cooked, defatted, & shredded a large roast in the crockpot. I used about 1/3 of the meat from this in my soup. I strained the broth and defatted this and added it to this soup, I used pretty much all the vegis & peppers listed but used only 1 jalepeno and substituted a Pasilla (sp?) pepper for the other two since I was concerned it might be too hot for us. I added an extra green pepper and 2 more tomatillos. (They were small) I added a large can of green enchilada sauce and a can of water. (There was a lot of meat and I wanted to make it more soupy.) I had 2 leftover baked potatoes that I diced and added in the last 30 mins. I cooked this on high in the crockpot for 4-5 hours. I didn't add the cream cheese at the end. It was so delicious as is, we didn't want to change it. We did sprinkle a little shredded cheese on top. Loved, loved, loved it. Thank you so much for a huge hit at our house!

I used this as a base for shredded pork for tamales (like the lady who would sell them in Castle Rock)  I roasted the veggies and just threw the entire roast into the crock with less broth, shredded it, blended about half of the veggies/broth and added back in. Best darn tamales I have ever made.  I know not the intent of the recipe, but it is a darn great chili with many possibilities.  This is now my 'go to' mexican meat!

Pretty darn yummy. I was cooking for kids with no tolerance for heat, so I subbed a can of green chiles for the fresh peppers. Worked great. One question, though. The directions say to peel the tomatillos. When I did that, it basically left a blob of insides, and that didn't seem right. Is that a typo? Or maybe something AR added to the original recipe? Or maybe I peeled them wrong? Anyway, I peeled one and left the rest unpeeled, and there didn't seem to be any weird skins in the chili, so I guess it's OK to leave them unpeeled.

Great recipe for a teen Halloween party.  12 fourteen year-old girls loved this chili best of the three kinds I made for their fun Halloween evening.  I was even asked to share the recipe, high praise from this bunch!

Great recipe! Never made this type of chili before but turned out well. Only thing I couldn't find was the Anaheim peppers...used canned green chilis instead. Definitely worth a try.

Great recipe!  Chef's got it right, roasting the veggies is a must.  I boiled a couple ham hocks, pulled the meat off the bones and used the stock.  Much more flavorful, so you won't need that beef bouillon.  I've also done a vegetarian version with roasted okra.  For stock, boil the stems and ends of various vegetables that you've saved up over the week.

I'm still trying to figure out how to make this chili GREENER! Tried doubling veggies and adding more green salsa, but I think a ton of tomatillos might do the trick. I added more stock to make it more soupy.

Excellent green chili. I'm a CO native and this is in the top 5 green chili's that I have had in my life. I made it for my wedding shower which was a potluck style bbq in the fall. It was a HUGE hit. I would omit the cream cheese though, it's not necessary and I think it actually takes away from the authenticity. Maybe a dollop of sour cream is all it needs.
