Terrific base to begin a dijon mustard of your own liking.  My tweaks were as follows: Used 3/4C yellow and 1/4C brown mustard seeds.  Cut out the mustard powder.  Used a dry white Riesling wine.  Added in cracked black pepper and 1T onion powder on top of the chopped sweet onion.  Also added in a bloop of powdered stevia.  I skipped direction #1 and soaked the seeds overnight with the wine and vinegar.  Went to step 3 and blended the seeds and liquid with the water, raw onion and garlic, onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I then simmered on the stove about 30 minutes.  Canned, put 3-12 oz jars up and 1, 1/4TH full jar in fridge.  DELICIOUS!

I made no changes to this recipe unless it would be failing to time the 15 minute simmer. After soaking the seeds and powdered mustard for 48 hours and blending to a fairly smooth consistency, the mixture is very soupy. The flavor and aroma are very nice, but it's not a spreadable consistency. Can I do anything to salvage this batch?

Edited: After rereading, I discovered I had omitted the simmer after blending the mustard. The texture is better! Now to let it rest and taste it in a week.

This is excellent! A little too much "tang" but that can be adjusted. I've reused "hotdog" mustard containers, so more needs to made to fill one of them. A definite thumbs up.

My daughter gave me Grandma's Apple Pie 'Ala Mode' Moonshine, that I used. I used in place of the white wine. and apple cider vinegar in place of the white wine vinegar.  I will be making this again.
