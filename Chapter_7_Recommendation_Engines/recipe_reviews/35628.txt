Maybe it's because I'm an inexperienced cook, maybe it's because I halved the recipe... I've been looking for a recipe for fried scones that I had in Salt Lake City, and I really hoped this would be it, but I was sorely disappointed.    The scones I was looking for had a sweet, fluffy quality.    These were heavier than I had hoped, and tasted yeasty (even after smothering them in melted honey-butter)  more than anything...   but, I probably didn't do something quite right.    I'll keep searching, and maybe I'll give this recipe another shot somewhere down the line.

I made these tonight for dinner and they were EXCELLENT! However, I cooked them in a deep pan on the stove top. I heated crisco (half a big container) and added a little canola oil. My kids have never had them before, and they loved them. This recipe makes a ton of scones!! I was able to feed 2 teenage boys, dad, toddler and myself..there's enough left overs to fill our bellies again. I made them into the 2.5" circles. Yes, I will make again!!

I halved this recipe. It was really simple to make and delicious!  It reminded me of elephant ears you'd get at a fair. We put cinnamon and sugar on ours and sprinkled with powdered sugar.
