This is absolutely fabulous. It’s so easy and so delicious, it will be my go to method for chicken from now on. I actually used leg quarters instead of just thighs and times were the same. What an awesome recipe!

Attractive and tasty. This was quick and easy. Most of all, everyone loved it. I left out the lemon wedges.
