This smoothie had the honor of being my first-ever homemade smoothie!  I found it to be delicious and very refreshing.  I did not have any frozen raspberries so I used frozen "mixed berries" instead.  At first taste, I thought that the smoothie was not sweet enough, but then as I continued to drink it, the flavors of the fruit and the tang of the yogurt really came through.  A delicious combination!

I did not care for this (was way too fruity) but my 3 year old daughter loved it.  It was a great healthy treat for her and the extra saved well in the fridge for the next day.

I'm new to smoothie making but I thought this was pretty good, although it could have been sweeter.  Will add a little honey next time.

I make a similar smoothie to this all of the time. I love the fruit combination with the yogurt and orange juice. I often add other frozen fruits to the recipes to change it around a bit. I love it with mixed berries, and peaches. I also add fresh blueberries and/or strawberries. I love it!

Used fresh instead of frozen; subbed strawberries instead of raspberries because my kids like the whole "strawberry-banana" taste. 
Put in a little sugar also.

I liked this.  I didn't follow the amounts exactly - I just threw everything into the blender.  It is quite sweet, but I like that.  It was very refreshing.

This is good, and I like the choice of using OJ instead of milk. It gives it a tart freshness that is just right. The only thing I changed was to add half a packet of Splenda to add a touch of sweetness to cut some tartness. In the end, this tastes a lot like sorbet.

Hubs and I widely disagree on this smoothie.  He liked what I thought was the odd combination of flavors, while I did not.   He called this “tart” and rated it four stars, but that was only after I added sugar, knowing it would need it as I looked over the ingredients.  I, on the other hand, would not call it tart; I’d call it sour, even after the sugar – I believe it was the large amount of raspberries and orange juice that made it so. The raspberry-orange-banana flavors in general were oddly mismatched, and just didn’t work well together.  I rate it, generously, two stars.

I used frozen mixed berries and used 3/4 cup of a rich, sweet vanilla yoghurt (I like my smoothies thick). Has a nice taste but definitely use a sweet yoghurt or the smoothie won't be quite sweet enough. I also strained most of the crunchy berry seeds out.

Great smoothie, but I made a few changes: decreased the orange juice to 1/2 cup, increased the yogurt to 1/2 cup (fat free plain yogurt) and added 1/2 scoop of protein supplement.

The smoothie was alright, but it was overpowered by the berry seeds! It was also too thick to drink, I had to add milk.

Tart, sweet and delicious.  The only thing is there isn't much banana flavor here, but that doesn't make it a bad smoothie.

Very good smoothie. Easier to drink after the mixture sits for a bit. A great way to increase calcium intake, particularly if you use calcium fortified orange juice. Thanks!

This was pretty good.  Nothing spectacular, but it was a good smoothie.  I had it instead of dessert one night- definitely a healthy and tasty choice!  The serving size for this recipe fit into a small glass.

I really like this smoothie. As the description states, it's very versatile (like most smoothies). I've made this twice now, once with orange juice and once with apple juice. Both were very good. Thank you :)

Made this twice this week to enjoy on my way to work and LOVED IT!  Didn't have frozen bananas so just used regular ones but I doubt it made any difference. This is now a staple in my house.  Thanks for posting it.

I used strawberries instead of raspberries (less tangy & that's what I had) and I also added an avocado for more creaminess & to reduce tartness!  Yummy!

Perfect! The ingredient proportions are exactly what I was looking for. I used Fage 0% fat plain greek-style yogurt instead of vanilla yogurt to make it a bit healthier. Also used frozen mixed berries.  It came out to be either a big serving for one person or smaller amount for 2 people.  Thanks!

Tart.  Yum.  Used plain yogurt and fresh squeezed (no sugar) oj to make it even more tart.  Great deviation from the same old sweet and fruity smoothie.  Also, was baking the Lemon Raspberry muffins found on this site at the same time, so added a twist or two of lemon juice to my smoothie.  Love it.

It was OK.  I used a fresh banana in mine. My husband thought it was horrible.

I'm new to smoothie making but really did enjoy this recipe. Try blending a minute or so longer to make less thick, this also increases the yield or just add a bit more OJ.  A great way to get my 2yr old daughter to eat her fruit!
