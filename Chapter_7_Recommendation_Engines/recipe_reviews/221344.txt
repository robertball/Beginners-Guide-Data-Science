The potatoes should sit in the broth for HOURS, not 10 min. This is why the recipe didn't have enough flavor, Annie. My Oma made her potato salad earlier in the day and let it sit for 2 hours in the broth. The longer it sits, the more flavor. Then the oil drizzles over last, just before serving. You will then have a flavorful salad. 10 minutes isn't enough time to soak up.  We also omit the onions since half our family dislikes raw onions. Instead we add a little onion juice for flavor. We do not add any mustard. We use white pepper, not black. And apple vinegar has more flavor than plain. Lastly, you have to use a strong potato, which won't fall apart easily, otherwise you have mush. Red works well. Sorry, I can't add my photo because I just ate all mine! :)

This was very easy and quick to make yet resulted in good salad.  I used organic red skin potatoes and left the skin on and used white distilled vinegar.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Will make it again.

I remember eating German Potato Salad at a friend's house and it had much more flavor than this. I was disappointed by the blandness of this recipe.

Really good although I would change a few things on here. Whole grain mustard is much better. As gigi said Apple cider vinegar. Cook the bacon. Cook the sweet onion in the bacon grease. Add everything including any remaining bacon grease. That is how my great Omi, and my Tante would make it. That is how I would make it. FYI If you don't like onions (like gigi) don't bother with German food. The basis for all German cooking is Bacon and Onion. Like Olive Oil and Garlic is for Italian food.

Tangy and savory; I absolutely love this potato salad, especially since there is no mayo in it and no added sugar.  I have made it twice now and find myself wanting to make extra potatoes so I have left-overs to make it with.

I have made this several times for my German friend and he found it really good, as with the other comment I also used more onions (3 onions) as we love fried onions and added well cooked bacon crumbled up.

I made this for New Year's Day. I wanted something quick to serve my sauerkraut recipe over (also a recipe I found on this app). This was flavorful, fast, and just what I needed to complete my dish! Thanks!

O mein got!  I remember the potato salad I had at my friend's house in Gotha, Thuringia, and I have never been able to find anything like it.  This recipe is as close as I've found, though the potatoes need to be soaked in the broth for at least a couple of hours, not ten minutes.  And red russet potatoes are the best.

It just wasn't what I was looking for and wasn't received well with those I served it to.
