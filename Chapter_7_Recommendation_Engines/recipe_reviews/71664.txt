These looked great and wanted to try, but i hate baked beans so i made them with Bushes Chile beans. I also sprinkled cotija cheese on a couple was a nice touch. Thanks

We really enjoyed this recipe.  When I make this again I am going to add some ground beef, green chili peppers, and extra cheese in the mixture.  Thanks Steven!
