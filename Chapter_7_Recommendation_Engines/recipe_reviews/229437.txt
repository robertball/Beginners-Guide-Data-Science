My family really liked this.  I sauteed my veggies in grapeseed oil rather than margarine.  It was a tad on the bland side, but that may be because I used dried parsley rather than fresh.  Very versatile as far as other spices that could be added.

We really enjoyed this dish, and I don't usually like brown rice. I did make a few changes, I know, I know. I shouldn't be rating and reviewing it if I changed it, but the recipe deserves feedback. I didn't have dried orange peel so I used orange zest; I didn't have minute rice so I used regular brown rice which I cooked in my home made turkey stock. The turkey stock really upped the flavor in the rice.  Everything else was as the recipe said. The results were very tasty. The things that needed improvement were the texture of the rice. It was a little gummy I think if I had used the minute rice that would not have been a problem . Maybe the turkey stock added to that texture problem. The other thing is the amount of dried cranberries. I thought that the next time I would reduce the amount. A little too sweet for me. I quadrupled the recipe and took it to a funeral reception.  It was very well received many having seconds and several people asked for the recipe.

Great flavor!  I added 1/4 cup of sour cherry jam, and used orange juice instead of chicken stock (no orange peel).  Turned out to be a fabulous side dish.

Made this for a family Thanksgiving.  Very good.  I didn't set it at the table-we had last-minute additions and I didn't think they would care for it-but my son-in-law found it in the kitchen and had several helpings before the others noticed and finished it. The adults all loved it.   This would be a great side dish with chicken.   I used cooked brown rice in place of the Minute Rice.  Reheats well.
