This is a fantastic variation of the typical roasted/kosher salted seeds.  Be sure to soak the seeds (I soak overnight) so they absorb some of the liquid and become plump and less splintered.  You can also add Soy for an added kick!  Great recipe.

These are delicious.  I did one batch exactly to recipe.  Then two others...one I used garlic salt instead of regular salt.  The second I let red pepper flakes heat up in the butter for a spicy flavor.  They were all excellent!

So I never go back and review recipes but I had to review this one. We went to a pumpkin farm on Halloween and they had all pumpkins 5 for $5 so we bought the largest 5 we could find. We had so many seeds (10+ cups) that we were going to try several recipes. This was the first and my family told me to just make them all this way they loved them so much.   I found the recipe to be very flexible. First batch I used olive oil instead of butter and added garlic salt as some recommended..FABULOUS! Second batch, ran out of olive oil so half canola..still fabulous! I didn't watch the time closely but baked each batch during a one hour tv show..stirred at the halfway point. I fast forwarded commercials so probably about 45 minutes.   My only recommendation..I boiled in salt water for about 10-15 minutes and then let soak for about 10 more, while I was getting things ready. I have tried drying and/or soaking overnight..no difference..just longer and more hassle. I didn't find them too salty but I like salty anyway..I have tried making them in the past without doing this and they don't taste as flavorful.

This is a great recipe!!  I did make one or two changes.  I used cooking spray rather than butter and I cooked the seed in the microwave for 2 or 3 minutes to dry them out a little.  Thank you for posting this recipe!!

Fantastic! Easy and delicious.  I did not change the recipe at all (don't have to, it's wonderful).  Instead of soaking the seeds overnight, I decided to "quick brine" them.  I boiled them in a brine solution (very salty water) for 10 mn, removed them from heat and let them sit in the hot water for another 10 mn.  I patted them dry and immediately tossed them in the ingredients listed.  I let it sit for about an hour (it soaks up the flavor better).  Then I roasted them at 275 for an hour (to compensate for the moister seed).  They were PERFECT.  I'll be doing this every year.

EXCELLENT!!  I am usually not a seed eater, it is something we just do for fun with the kids ...  but I LOVE THESE!!  SUPER GOOD!  I cooked them on my stone pan, and the 250 just didn't seem hot enough after about 30 min of baking, so boosted up to 350 degrees and just watched them closely for the last half hour or so and stirred them several times.  TURNED OUT GOLDEN BROWN and GREAT!! LOTS OF FLAVOR TOO! -Muskegon, MI

Best I have found thus far.  I still soaked my seeds in salt water for 2 hours before hand.  I have used the oil recipes in the past and found the butter to taste much better.

I have never toasted pumpkin seeds before but we had all these pumpkins after thanksgiving so I wanted to try it.  Well I loved it.  I also added garlic powder and this was so good as a healthly snack compare to other snacks out there.  I wish we had more pumpkins.  My three year old liked taking out the seeds from the pumpkins..lol.

My normal recipe is just butter and salt, but I wanted to try something different this year.  I followed this recipe exactly and it was awesome.  My kids loved them!  I will never go back to my basic recipe again!!

This worked and tasted great. I had 5 1/2 cups of seeds to do from 3 pumpkins. I substituted the salt for ranch seasoning mix with a little added garlic powder.

To be honest, I was disappointed after reading all the reviews.  I'm not sure what all the fuss is about, but I'll go back to making my regular salted pumpkin seeds next year.

I grew up with my mom's roasted pumpkin seeds, and these were pretty good compared to hers. They seemed a touch bland, so I made a second batch with the remaining seeds (we made a lot of Jack-o-lanters with our kids) and added a 1/2 tsp each of garlic powder and onion powder, then an 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper. And for my secret ingredient to give it that little extra something, I lightly sprinkled them with nutmeg once they were spread onto the pan. Delish! Everyone loved them. These were also a great take along snack for my 2 year old while walking to pick up her big brother from the bus stop. We ran out almost immediately! Thanks a lot!

I thought this recipe was great.  I only had enough seeds to make a 1/2 batch.  I am not a big fan of salty foods and thought the salt level was just right.

Every year I have made a similar recipe using butter, a pinch of garlic powder, cheyenne,  and either seasoning salt or sea salt...BUT the worcestershire is the ingredient I always knew was missing but couldn't figure it out.  I still add my other spices, but my pumpkin seeds are outta this world thanx to your helpful tip Crystal!

Yum! Wish I had made more! Used 1 tsp. garlic salt in place of seasoned salt, and I baked for approx 65 minutes at 275 and stirred the seeds a few times. Great recipe that you can tweak to your own preferences.

Easy to make and most of all great tasting.  Husband says that I must make these more often.  Guess, I will have to grow sugar pumpkins next year so I can make more than one or two batches of these a year.  Thanks for sharing this!!!

This recipe is really good!  I usually just use the butter & salt recipe and wanted to try something different.  The only thing I did different from this recipe was add about 20 minutes to the time because I like my seeds a little more roasted (stirring as needed) and put them back in the oven, after I turned it off, for an additional 15 minutes.  Perfect!!

I used this recipe last year- wahoo, it was good.  I used garlic salt.  The key, you have dry the seeds good after washing them, blot w/towel to get off all water.  Otherwise they won't crisp up nicely.  happy halloween!

I've found out that pumpkin seeds just don't do it for me... flavor-wise, these are pretty good. I found myself wanting a little spice or smokiness (perhaps a smoked paprika...which I happen to be out of...). My boyfriend is enjoying them though, as-is. Next time we'll try for a spicy-sweet combo. *I stirred every 20 minutes, setting a timer to remind me. They were done in about an hour, with no issues of burnt seeds.

Just perfect. Simple, but a great way to prepare pumpkin seeds. I dried them for probably an hour or two on a cookie sheet on the counter and then baked them. I baked them shy of an hour so they didn't end up too dry. Will make again!

Yummy!  Everyone in my family enjoyed these.  I think next time I'll take the advice of some of the others that said they soaked them.  I never knew that that would help.  Wishing I had more pumpkin seeds to make up another batch of these.

After the seeds have been in the oven for an hour, I like to keep them in the oven overnight.

These were decent - I prefer other varieties.  They turned out super crunchy though and had some flavor.  For any pumpkin seed recipe, you need to "prep" your seeds if you have gotten them from a fresh pumpkin.  First, rinse off all the gunk and residue.  Then put them in a bowl with salt water and let them soak for a day or 2.  Cover the top of the bowl with a wet towel.  Change salt water as needed.  This is to a) draw the water out of them (for a crunchier bite) and b) infuse them with some salty flavor.  Thereafter, drain and lay out the seeds on a flat surface (ie. baking pan) on top of a layer of paper towels.  Let them dry out for a day or two and then cook as directed.  I used 1 cup of seeds for the amount of spices specified for 2 seeds.

This is a great recipe!  We had a lot of pumpkin seeds this fall, so I wanted a simple recipe to roast them.  I did make a few changes to the recipe however.  I let the seed soak overnight in salt water and then boiled them in that water for about 15 minutes.  I also did not use Worcesteshire sauce on them.  The seeds turned out awesome and are very crispy!

I have never made pumpkin seeds before and it turned out amazing. The only thing I did different was half way threw I added more seasoning salt and Worcestershire sauce. Yummy

OM NOM NOM! I am eating these as we speak. I had a little over two cups so I increased the amounts just a tish and added a sprinkle of garlic powder, inspired by a previous reviewer below. DELICIOUS! They are a teeny bit too salty, but it's not so bad with something to drink to take the tang off. The crunch is phenomenal; it reminds me of popcorn, only way, way better for you.

Very savory and delicious. I was going to try a sweet recipe, but decided to stick with this more traditional one instead. I'm glad I did. It was a nice change from the plain jane way I usually roast pumpkin seeds, with just butter and a little salt. Thank you for the recipe.

These were really good! I did double all ingredients except for the pumpkin seeds, and added some Hot Salt.  My seeds must have had a lot of moisture in them too, I had to bake them for 2 hours for them to be crunchy. All in all, everyone loved them!

A pretty great, basic recipe. I always toast my leftover pumpkin seeds when I carve my jack o lantern. I tweaked this to my tastes. Instead of season salt and Worcestershire, I used butter, cinnamon, and sugar to give them a sweet flavor! So delicious, even my husband who was skeptical of eating pumpkin seeds loved them.

Used Red Robin seasoning salt and they came out awesome! I really liked using the lower temp, though for the last 15 minutes or so I turned it up to about 325 degrees because I wanted them a little toastier. :)

I'm not a huge fan of any kind of seeds but WOW, the first time I made these, I couldn't stop eating them! The whole family loved them. I've made them twice now, exactly as written, and they are delicious! Definitely worth saving the pumpkin seeds!

There was a pumpkin carving contest at work, so I took home some seeds that were going to be thrown away.  This is so delicious! I'm not really a fan of seeds (it's a texture problem with the shells), but I wish I could suck off that coating or may try this again with shelled seeds.  The hubby went nuts over them.

Sorry wasn't a big fan of these.  I think that the cook time was off and they were a little to bland for me.  Ended up making another batch this time with some melted butter and a chex mix seasoning packet

Mmm!! So good! I love these things. I double the Worcestershire sauce because I like it a bit stronger. But what a great and different flavor! My new favorite healthy snack. Oh, and my dog likes them too :)

This recipe is perfect! My pumpkin produced right at 2 cups of seeds, so no need to alter qty. I took this to a girls party and got compliements from almost everyone there! They are not too salty and have lots of flavor.

I'm not really rating this recipe as much as I am the recipe plus the feedback in the reviews that followed its posting.

Based on other AllRecipeists, I put my two pumpkins' worth of seeds in the microwave for three minutes, stirring once. I then spread them on a cookie sheet and sprayed olive oil (Trader Joe's) all over them. I applied it liberally. I then grated some salt and pepper over the seeds and then applied a bunch of habanero sauce. Mixed every thing together. Last but certainly not least, I applied approximately two tablespoons of precrushed garlic (Trader Joe's) to the cookie sheet and made sure each seed got some garlic on it.

I baked the seeds at 300 degrees for approximately 45 minutes, checking every 15 minutes and stirring when I checked. 

The very last thing I did was turn the oven off, shake some Parmesan cheese over all of the seeds, and stuck the sheet back in the still-hot oven. 

Yum yum yum. My house smells amazing right now. :)

I'm really stepping out of the box this week, the second recipe I tried straying from the ones I ALWAYS use.  I'm glad I did, these were really good!  I did have to bump the heat up to 300 after 45 minutes since they didn't look nearly done and let them go for another 1/2 hour for a total of 75 minutes.

I've always made pumpkin seeds on the stovetop, but decided to try it this way this year. It was awesome! I subbed cajun seasoning for seasoned salt because I just ran out of Lawry's :(, and it worked great!

Great recipe! I have always hated pumpkin seeds until now. I forced my father who has also always hated them to try them, and he finished the whole pan. Good stuff.

Made 2 batches, one with Worcestershire sauce and one without. Both were very good but the ones with it reminded me of chex mix. Mine took a lot longer in the oven though.

These are delicious! I used a slightly different recipe though. I did not clean or rinse the seeds. And I used kosher salt instead of season salt. Then I cooked for 2 hours at the same temperature. Turned out perfect!

Very good!  I was skeptical about the Worcestershire sauce, but it really does give it a good flavor without being over powering.  Like others, I added a bit of garlic salt, and brined the seeds for about 10 min before.  These turned out yummy!  Will definitely do again.

I followed the reviewer who boiled in brine then soaked in marinade for 45 min.  But they definitely did not take a full hour to roast!!  I had at 275 deg for 25 min and they were boarderline burned.  Maybe my seeds were smaller, I don't know.  The flavor was good though.  So next time everything the same except bake at 250 and watch closely after 20 min.

My grandchildren and I made these from the pumpkins they grew in our garden and carved for Halloween.  This recipe had us all fighting over the seeds!  They were delicious.  We will have to grow more pumpkins next year so we will have more seeds:)

I've never made roasted pumpkin seeds before so I have nothing to compare my creation to.  I did soak my seeds in salt water overnight  and then followed the recipe as written.  They were very tasty, although I probably soaked them too long as they were also very salty.  I'll use this recipe again.

Loved this recipe, I had never tried roasted pumpkin seeds before.  Everyone that tried them loved them.  Great flavor, not overpowering.  I didn't change the recipe, nor would I.  Loved them right out of the oven and the next day as well.

Delicious! Boiling them for about 10 minutes before baking makes them even crunchier! This is my go to recipe now--it's a keeper. Edit: I followed the recipe using some spaghetti squash seeds, and my 3 year old tried to eat the entire container of seeds!

Made these tonight after Halloween! They are delicious and a big hit at the house! The only thing I did different was add a 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder because I saw it on another recipe and thought I'd give it a little twist of extra flavor! It came out good!

This was a great EASY recipe. I followed it exactly for the ingredients but accidentally cooked longer, about 1 1/2 hours. I did 2 batches and the second one was only an hour, I think the longer one tastes better as it is crunchier. Just my personal preference

YUM - GREAT SIMPLE RECIPE!  It just came out of the oven 10 minutes ago & I'm eating them shells & all which I never do. Shells usually choke me but these are browned, toasty & crisp. I never made pumpkin seeds before so I followed the recipe as is. Only exception was I boiled seeds in salty water until they turned gray before baking. It cleans them & adds flavor at same time (a great tip from JOSCRAZYM!) Next time I'll bake the small & large seeds separately because the large seeds are a little lighter in color & chewy. They needed another 5-10 minutes more to achieve perfection. These are so good! I need to make more for my family, friends & neighbors. I'm inspired to try new flavors with it also like soy sauce & wasabi powder or teriyaki, ginger & ground coriander, and maybe a sweet batch with vanilla extract, cinnamon & toss it with brown sugar right out of the oven to create a light glaze.  Looks like I'm gonna need to get more pumpkins! Thanks for a tasty, easy recipe that anyone can have success making.

I am so impressed how well these turned out.  Yummy!!!  I soaked the seeds in the mixture for about 1 hour before baking. I am not a pumpkin seed fan but can't stop munching on these.

Awesome!  I, like another post, usually make them with butter & salt.  This was a LOVELY difference.  I too will use this recipe in lieu of the traditional.  I took another comment and added a tsp of garlic powder.  Thanks!

I used olive oil instead of butter and doubled everything but the worcestershire sauce per reviews.  I didn't think these were exceptionally flavorful.

This is my favorite pumpkin seeds recipe!  This year I bought a pumpkin for $4 and only got 1 cup of seeds from it.  I googled raw pumpkin seeds and just received my order.  They were about $3/lb which is WAY cheaper than buying a pumpkin and I can make them all year round!

This recipe was great!  I had more than 2 cups of seeds to I increased the amounts and added some olive oil to my butter since I used light butter and then added garlic and onion powder.  Fantastic!  Cooked in exactly one hour and my fiance said it's a keeper!

Great recipe! I let the seeds dry overnight on a cookie sheet. I also mix in some garlic powder and Jane's Crazy Salt. For me, they usually only take about 45 minutes in the oven.

Some of the best pumpkin seeds Ive had in along time!

I love seasoning salt, and I love Worcestershire sauce, so when I saw this recipe I knew it would be great. I halved the amount of butter, and used olive oil instead. My oven is a little off, so I bumped it up to 300 and toasted them for 50 minutes tossing them every 10-15 minutes until they were brown and crisp. They turned out excellent! Thank you!

I love this simple recipe! These are just like my mom used to make them, and maybe that's why I only made one small alteration. I reduced the salt to 1 t, just because of personal preference. The flavor is fine with that extra 1/4 t, and my 5 year-old ate them that way with lots of "mmm", "yum", and "these are SO good!". She's is a picky eater too! I stirred halfway through the bake time, just because I wasn't going to take the time to make sure all of the seeds were single layer. I have this recipe saved, and I will definitely be using it in the future!

These were so delicious. This was my first time making roasted pumpkin seeds. I soaked them in hot water for 25 minutes then laid them out to dry overnight. I made the mixture as written (except I used table salt). I baked for 25 minutes, stirred and then cooked them for another 15 minutes. They were golden and delicious.

My favorite recipe for pumpkin seeds so far! I made sure the seeds were mostly dry before mixing all the ingredients together. I also used "French Fry Seasoning" as the seasoning salt.

This turned out great.  I did not follow the recipe exactly - I did not measure out the ingredients.   I also used seasoned salt on the recipe.

My family loved it.  I can only eat so many before I get sick of them.  Best recipe I've used.  I recommend!

These tasted delicious just the way the recipe said.  I might have left them in just a little longer to be sure that they were a bit more crunchy, but all in all, they were a perfect snack!

Made this last night using some of the reviewers tips: I brined the seeds for 10 mins (boiled in very salty water) and let it sit in the brine for 10 mins after. I patted the seeds dry and immediately put them in the mixture. I use 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1 tbsp salt since I didn't have seasoned salt. I baked it for 1 hr at 275°as someone else suggested to account for the wet seeds. it is fabulous!!

Oh my Gosh, love this. I followed the comments and was very pleased. Soak your seeds in salt water overnight, add a splash of soy to the butter, half garlic salt half sea salt, and I just added a few red pepper flakes to the butter but not too much. I also set a timer every 20 minutes to stir while baking. I will make this again

I doubled the seasoning because my family loves super salty. The Worcester Sauce adds some nice flavor. Will add this recipe to my sweet-honey pumpkin seed recipe. I like to have both options every year.

Delicious and simple. I had 3 cups of pumpkin seeds so I did 1 1/2 the recipe. Because I didn't have any seasoned salt, I used a combination of garlic powder, onion powder & paprika to replace it.

For years I only used regular salt and then roasted my pumpkin seeds which was okay.  I thought I would try something different and I found this recipe.  Yum!  This will now be my go to.

MY family loved this recipe! I couldn't keep them in the bowl. I did add cayenne pepper to the butter as it melted, used garlic salt in place of the regular salt, and also boiled the seeds for 10 min. before coating them with the seasoning.

Had to adjust the recipe for a half cup or so of hubbard squash seeds. First I mixed 1 T sugar, a couple pinches of kosher salt and 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and set aside. Then I used an 8" cast iron frying pan on the stovetop (seemed a waste to heat up the oven for such a small amount) and toasted the seeds. When they looked golden brown, I tossed in 1 T of butter which melted fast in the hot pan, then quickly sprinkled the sugar/salt/spice mix and stirred to coat all the seeds. When they were all coated, I emptied them onto a plate and spread them out to cool. By "cool" I mean still warm but not hot enough to burn my tongue! OMG delicious! I plan to try it this way again with a larger cast iron pan and pumpkin seeds and will spread them out on a cookie sheet to cool so they don't clump.

Used sesame oil instead of butter. Added some roasted garlic powder too. Had to cook the seeds longer than called for, but golden brown is a nice rule of thumb. Terrific!

These were pretty good. I think best the first few days, after that they seemed to get old to me but this was the first time I've made pumpkin seeds.

Pretty good!  I had about 2 1/4 cups pumpkin seeds and used 2 tbsp. butter.  Could use a little more salt, but still very easy and a good snack!

Easy, delicious, uses ingredients I always have on hand anyway.  The perfect recipe!  I only soaked in salt water for 15 minutes because the kids were dying to eat some before bed and they were still wonderful.

These have turned out excellent each time I have made them. I have scaled it up to make more than 2 cups. It just requires a little more time in the oven.

Delicious!  I followed the brining advice and I do think it enhanced the flavor.  Brought the seed to a boil in very salty water, turned off and let sit for 15 min before draining.
Thanks!

I made my pumpkin seeds cajun-style by adding spices like cayenne pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and a splash of hot sauce with the worchestershire sauce and the butter.  I didn't soak my seeds as suggested by some reviewers and they were just fine.  I did make sure they were very dry (overnight in paper towels).  They were crispy and slightly spicy.

I did not like these at all.  I grew up in New England and we toasted a lot of pumpkin seeds.  I was looking for a different prep, instead of just salt, spices & butter or oil.  This recipe fell short for me.  They have a weird sweetness to them, from the worcestershire. In my opinion it takes away from the simplicity of the seeds themselves.  Would not make these again.

Very tasty....and addictive!  I did stir them around about halfway through and raise the temp to 300.  They were done in about 40-45 minutes!  I didn't soak the seeds or anything...just made them as the directions said, and I thought the absorbed the flavor wonderfully!  Thanks for the recipe!

I had never boiled/soaked seeds before, but followed recommendation found in reviews and it made a huge difference! The hull was no longer "icky" - it became crisp and crunchy. The flavor was subtle, not overpowering. Only baked about 30 min and they were ready!

Mine burned after 20 minutes in the oven?  I soaked them overnight, dried them overnight, then baked as directed.  They were smoking after 20 minutes.  Some still ate them even though they were a little burned, and not very crunchy.  Will try again next year...
