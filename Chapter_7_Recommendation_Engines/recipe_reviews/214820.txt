I've been making this recipe for years and it's always been a hit. The only changes that I made was to omit the salt and sometimes use thyme and/or steak spice. I also add 1 egg so that the patties stay glued together while on the grill.  Thanks for sharing.

Great hamburger! I love grilling with beer. I used about 1 & 1/4 lbs. of ground beef and about 1/4 cup of finely chopped onion along with the garlic. I kept the other measurements the same (1 Tbsp. of Worcestershire & 1/4 c. beer). There's never a shortage of beer in this house so we used Michelob Ultra. I think any type of full bodied beer will work fine in this recipe. Instead of a tsp. of salt and 1/4 tsp. of pepper I used 1 & 1/4 tsp. of McCormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning. After mixing the ground beef, we let it set for a half hour in the fridge before making the patties to let the flavors come together. These burgers came out very moist and juicy -perfect on a toasted sesame seed roll with melted cheese, lettuce and tomato.

I will definitely try this recipe again.  The burgers were quite tasty.  However, the burgers tended to break apart.  Next time I will try with a little less beer.

I think it was too much beer, the burger was too tender. I made this three ways I took the 1/4 of beer and put it in a pot and cooked it down to 1 Oz. this still gave the full flavor of the beer, but still made the beef patty tender. I also used 1 oz of dark German beer and a good Belgium beer. The left over beer I drank, I hate waste.

Yum! These burgers were super. I used 93/7 ground turkey instead of beef, the meat mixture did seem very thin and I was worried that these wouldn't hold together well on the grill so I added about 1/4 cup of bread crumbs. Topped with extra sharp white cheddar and served on a hawaiian roll. Thanks for the recipe, we will be making these often!

Pretty darn good little burgers!  My only change was to use steak seasoning in place of the salt & pepper.  I did these indoors on the grill pan.  Looking forward to trying these on the outdoor grill this Summer.  Thanks for sharing!

These were really tasty. I overcooked a  bit but they still came out savory. I added a few dashes of cayenne and paprika. Everyone loved them.

Pretty good, although the consistency when shaping the patties was really soft even after adding an egg. They were hard to flip, but the end result was yummy!

I did not care for this recipe. It ended up being a crumbling un-eatable mess! I don't get all the rave reviews or how anybody managed to keep these burgers together long enough to put on a bun. Followed directions exactly except for the addition of an egg like many reviewers suggested. This one goes in my "do not repeat" file.

I found this recipe here this past summer and have made it many times.  It is now my "special beer burger" and everyone loves it!  I've used different beers (Killian's Red, Guinness, Sam Adams Octoberfest)all to wonderful reviews!  Also, I am lucky enough to be able to use free range beef (actually met the cow)which makes this the best darn burger I've ever had!

I've used this recipe without the onion and really liked it.  To get the burgers to hold together I form the patties and put them on a platter in the freezer for about 45 mins. to a hour then put directly on the grill.  Brown well on one side before flipping.

Really good, but I did modify it. I added an egg, breadcrumbs and steak spice as per other reviewers. Texture is amazing, and I am experienced working with very soft burger meat as I make mine with cream cheese and they also are hard to form patties. Just slap the glob on a plate and put it in the fridge for an hour. :)

Great burger....just a few suggestions...... I added an egg, small amount of fine bread crumbs, and hamburger spices. Let sit in fridge a while before you make patties. ( so flavors meld and use bold tasting beer ). Keep grill fire low and let each side of burger cook a while before flipping.    Yummmmm!!!!!!

This very similar to a recipe I have used for quite some time.  Only difference is I use an IPA or a Porter for the beer.  Also, instead of salt and pepper I use Cosco's Sweet Mesquite seasoning.  Really adds a nice smokey taste to the burgers.

Made this last night using a dark-ish amber beer. It was SO GOOD. I followed everything to the letter, except that I let the mixture chill without the Worcestershire for a while (I started making these without realizing that I didn't have any, and had to go out). I also chilled the patties for a little while before grilling them. I used 80/20 beef, and I'd chalk up the juiciness of the burgers to that and the beer. Definitely a lot easier than my normal recipe, and just as good.

This is a recipe that I've been using for years, except I add an egg to bind mixture together.  Also I add garlic.  I add garlic to almost everything.

This was just OK. Used ground turkey, as we don't eat beef. Added an egg and reduced the beer to 1/8 cup. They were still runny, so added 1/4 cup panko crumbs. Cooked them on the stovetop and glad I did as they never would have stayed together on the grill. If I fix them again, I will add some chipotle peppers or red pepper flakes to jazz it up.

Very tasting and will use this recipe again. I had no problem with my burger staying together. I let the meat absorb the beer and didn't over mix meat.

This was pretty good.  The only reason we rated it a 4 was because the burgers wanted to fall apart on us (while cooking and eating).  I used less beer than called for.  The taste is really good.  Give this recipe a try!!

Loved this burger. I like a lot of seasoning and instead of salt and pepper used hamburger seasoning from McCormick and left out the onions. Will definitely be making these again. Was  huge hit! I also cooked them inside on the stove and had no problem with them falling apart or being too watery. Added lettuce and tomato for a fresh crunch. So good!

I love a good burger and will try about anything.  When I read this one I thought, why not?  Now I ask myself why?  There wasn't anything appealing about it at all and everyone left the majority of theirs on the plate.

Made these burgers with a maple porter, and scaled back the onions by about a third. Moist and  flavorful, they were an instant hit! Definitely gonna make these again!

I was very disappointed in this recipe. Burgers were dry and had a funny flavor. My husband and son who love beer did not love these. Unfortunely I made 2 lbs worth, so I guess we'll be eating them for awhile.

I tired these burgers today and they may be the best burgers I have ever grilled and I've grilled a lot of burgers.  The addition of the beer really does something wonderful.  I prepared these yesterday and cooked them today.  Really good.

Easy to make and super great tasting. Added an egg to keep it together and it worked perfectly on the grill. Didn't fall apart at all. Topped with smoked cheddar cheese. YUM!

These were just OK.  I added an egg to help hold them together, but even the 1/4 cup of beer was overwhelming for me.  Also felt there was to much garlic.

I neve tweak new recipies on the first try out of respect. I got the reaction from three of 5 cookout guests, sour face terror. The garlic was way, way too much. I am always amazed at the copious amounts of garlic some people use and think it is always a good thing.

This was a great meal!  The burgers really held onto the flavor and if you use the right beer, you can enhance the garlic / onion overtones.

This was a good recipe! My friends loved the beer burgers. I think it is a little too much beer for one pound of ground beef so I added a little extra ground beef. I also used a grill seasoning from McCormick instead of the salt and pepper.

These were very tasty! I was so surprised that I didn't need to add extra ingredients like bread crumbs or an egg to hold the burgers together, but I didn't! They were juicy and full of flavor! I can't wait to make them again!

Made these for the family and they were a hit, especially with the Hubby. He ate 3 of them and kept commenting how good they were. Even my picky 10 year old daughter liked them, which is rare considering they had onions in them. Overall, very good, will make them again.

Family loved these burgers.  I doubled the recipe and used 2.5 lbs. of ground chuck.  I followed another direction and decided to use more meat.  I had extra burgers left, so I froze them.  Will definitely make again.

Looking to kick up the usual - tired of the same old thing - burgers.  This one popped up early in the search; looked easy and sounded like it'd be worth giving it a try.  How can you go wrong with beer and beef????  Any how, they turned out FANTASTIC!!!! Added some nice fatty bacon & Swiss cheese to a few if them and in the old Emeril talk, BAM......BAM...BAM....... (how many times & ways can one say Fantastic ....Outstanding........ about a burger ??)  Another keeper - and an added note - I've tried a number & variety of recipes from the AllRecipes site and not one has missed the mark as of yet - so I think AllRecipes is a KEEPER TOO!!!

I never would have thought of adding beer to my burgers, but what a great addition it is. The burgers were super tender! I used Montreal Steak Seasoning instead of salt and pepper. 
The only problem, as others mentioned, is that these burgers tend to fall apart. I added both an egg and some breadcrumbs, and refrigerated the formed patties for half an hour, and my husband still said they were hard to handle on the grill. But the flavor was superb.

Got a little excited that I was using beer in burgers and put a little too much lol but squeezing them a little before shaping helped. They're a little hard to work with but came out amazingly delicious and almost put the smack down on the old man for the last one. Definately a keeper.

Love this recipe! I used minced onions & garlic salt instead of chopped garlic & regular salt! Came out great! Plus I used my oven broiler because it was raining outside.

i have used this recipe several times; most recently with turkey burgers. it is really good. with the turkey burger i melted some butter in some vegetable oil to keep the turkey burger from going dry and mixed some pepper jack cheese in the burger mix. the melted cheese within the burger was really good.

These were delicious! I used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 Johnsonville Italian Sausage, and that was a great combination!!!! Great flavor, and all of the ingredients worked well together. From a family that loves both sausage and burgers (and beer, lol), this was a winner and a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Delicious!  I added an egg because so many folks said they were falling apart and they turned out wonderfully!  I used a stout Guinness and it added such amazing flavor.  I made these for guests and they loved them!  Will definitely make again!

These are really great!  I did add an egg because I was worried that there wasn't a binding agent in them.  But otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  They were really great!  VERY juicy!

This is very similar to a recipe I have been using for the past couple of years. The only difference being we use a few slices of cooked crumbled bacon in the ingredients... so I call them Beer N Bacon Burgers 
I also had a problem with them being too "mushy" and falling apart. To remedy that I use a hamburger press & simply put the patties on wax paper and throw them in the freezer for a bit before grilling. Not freezing them through, just firming them up enough that they don't fall to pieces. It works perfectly for us!

They were very good burgers, however considering the amount of people in my family who don't like onions, it didn't get the best remarks. The only substitution I made was I added 1/2 tsp. pepper. Delicious!
