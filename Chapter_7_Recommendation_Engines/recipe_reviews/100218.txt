Taste is 5 star but am giving this 3 Stars because of the misinformation when it comes to the ingredient amounts.  I made this as directed except for using just 1 cup of elbow macaroni. Makes a lot so I sent some to neighbors.  When I took mine out to serve the next day I couldn't believe it.  There was NO broth left.  The macaroni had absorbed it ALL and I didn't even use the full amount of macaroni.  I called my neighbors and they said they enjoyed the STEW - too late to send them over a can or two more of broth to add to it.  This soup needs a minimum of 24oz. more of liquid - I would use vegetable broth.

Recipe was very easy to make and it makes ALOT!  I would recomend to cut your vegetable into small pieces especially the carrots and potatoes.  As for the rest I doubled the broth and cut 1/2 cup of the pasta out, even this did not work as previously recomended I would go with 1/2 the pasta (and most importantly pre-cook it) I love the pasta in minestrone and it was too much for me! As for the cooking instead of slow simmering I brought the soup up to a boil reduced to a simmer and covered and it cut about 10 minutes off of the cooking time.

GREAT START, BUT...needed some adjustments to get to 5 Stars. Here is how I got to 5 Stars: Added 1/2 bag frozen chopped spinach, 1 can petite diced Italian tomatoes, 1 can pesto tomatoes paste (Contadina brand), 1/2 the recommended amount of dried spices, 5 cloves garlic, nixed the pasta, only 2 potatoes, 4 carrots 3 whole celery stalks (leaves and all!), 1 zucchini, 2 small yellow squash, 1 quart vegetable stock and 1 can chicken broth (no water!) 1 more can of regular tomatoe paste will likely make it 6 stars...NEXT TIME!!! Thanks for the recipe!  PSST...don't forget the sprinkle of cheese!

I'm rewriting this review because I made the minestrone again and it is SOGOOD!

Last time I made it, the liquid disappeared within an hour or two of taking the pot off of the stove. I mean it was totally gone--like a casserole or something. So here's what I changed this time:

I used 3 potatoes, 3 carrots, 2 stalks of celery, one quite-small onion, 4 cloves garlic, 16 oz of veggie broth, 1-1/4 cups macaroni, and dried herbs instead of fresh (same quantities). All the other ingredients were the same.

I heated the olive oil and cooked the onion and garlic for maybe 5 minutes, then added the rest of the chopped veggies and let them cook together for a few minutes. I think it tastes better that way.

I had to cook longer than 30 minutes, and the macaroni took longer than 10 minutes as well.

There isn't a lot of liquid but it's much better than last time. If it disappears again I'll add more veggie broth.  

Using smaller quantities of vegetables makes a much more manageable-sized soup and I don't think we'll have to throw any away this time. It also tastes better when there's more liquid.

With these modifications, I really love this recipe! Thanks Corrigan!

When I worked at Olive Garden, we cooked the pasta seperately. Then , add just before serving.  Boil the pasta, drain and toss with veggie oil. Toss into soup right before serving. If you plan to store some for later, divide it before adding pasta or simply add a 1/4 cup or so of cooked pasta to each bowl before ladeling soup over it.

Easy make ahead family dinner or cold weather party starter.  Cook pasta separately.  Place pasta in individual serving bowl & add the soup on top. Cooked and drained pasta will keep in a plastic bag in the frig for several days.  Personal preferences include less onion & garlic (especially when freezing), chopped spinach, finely shredded cabbage, diced tomatoes, V8 juice and any veggie I have in the frig. Keeping the pasta separate also makes the recipe crockpot & freezer friendly for those rushed days. Enjoy

Warning: Makes a lot yet can be easily frozen for leftovers. This stuff was GOOD, and really easy to make for a weeknight. The most time consuming part is chopping the vegetables, and while the soup cooks, stir every so often. I didn't have veggie broth so I used a can of chicken broth instead, also added in a can of chick peas. Very yummy, will definitely be making again.

This was a huge hit at a church supper last night.  I needed a hearty vegetarian soup and this fit the bill.  We doubled the recipe and had enough for about 23 people plus some extra.  Everyone is asking for the recipe. I made a couple of small changes, but it would've been good without them too.  I just added some chopped zucchini, used dry herbs since I didn't have fresh, and used small shells instead of macaroni for the pasta.It was excellent!

was good but I followed the recipe exactly and was left with a pot full of everything but broth.  Next time I will reduce the potatoes and pasta and add a LOT more vegetable stock.  I've already added more stock and there's barely any there.  The recipe as written is even thicker than a stew and I definitley would not call it Minestrone SOUP!

Didn't even miss the meat. The beans make this a very filling soup. I used black beans, since I didn't have kidney beans. Also, added celery salt and onion powder instead of the fresh stuff. Had to steam the potatoes and carrots for about 20 minutes in the steamer. I don't think they would have been done otherwise. Also, had to add a lot of extra water! While I was cooking it I just added extra every once and awhile. Until it was done and the way I like it.

I overcame the problem of the liqued 'drying' up by precooking the pasta, so worked extremely well that way.

Fantastic!  I used only 2 potatoes.  Used an 8 oz box of macaroni noodles, and added 14 oz can diced basil and oregano tomatoes.  Also used Better than Bouillon veggie bouillon (from a jar) instead of canned broth.  Added fresh parsley, and served with Parmesan cheese.  Made Focaccia bread to go with it.  YUM!

This was a great soup with a couple of modifications. The tomato paste was way too strong for my taste so I discarded about a cup of the liquid and added extra stock. I used chicken stock instead of vegetable and left out the kidney beans. I took the advice of other reviewers and cooked the noodles separately and added to soup just before serving. A great soup!

Like others, I agree that this one calls for too much pasta & potatoes for the amount of liquid.  However, the overall flavor is very good & you can play around with the ingredients!  I made these changes: used 3 potatoes, 3 stalks celery, 5 cloves of garlic, 1T dried basil (didn't have any fresh on hand), about 1.5T salt, and 1/4 tsp ground white pepper.  I cooked the pasta separately (used small sea shells) and placed the hot pasta in the bowls before pouring the soup over it.  This makes the amount of liquid called for in the soup just about right and keeps the pasta from becomming mush in leftovers.  Store the pasta & soup separately or make just enough pasta for each meal and you always have fresh minestrone at hand!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I did cut down on the potatoes, carrots and celery. And cooked the noodles before adding. They still took a lot of liquid but it is a delicious soup. I added green beans and corn but next time I will add spinach. Really good minestrone.

Delicious soup - I followed the instructions of many of the other reviewers and added about twice as much liquid as the recipe called for.  I also used homemade vegetable broth instead of water.

My husband and 2 year old and I enjoyed this immensely! Yum! My husband is not usually a soup fan but this was perfect as it was chunky and thick  -- especially since he had a sore throat, it hit the spot.

I don't do a lot of cooking, but today was my wife's birthday and minestrone is her favorite soup.  Very good recipe, but a little too thick.  Next time I'll add more water.  Here's what I changed:  Put in two cans of tomato paste, 1 and 1/2 times the vegetable broth, and added half tablespoon of sage.

This is a really great recipe.  I just tried it for the first time b/c its cold and rainy outside and it just sounded good.  I didn't have all the exact ingredients so I used what I had on hand.  I used pinto beans instead of kidney, chicken broth instead of veg., italian seasoning instead of basil and oregano, and frozen garlic and parmesan potatoes.  We enjoyed a big bowl full accompanied by some fresh cornbread and it hit the spot!

This was fantaastic. I took the reviewers' advice of cutting down the amount of beans and I only added the pasta when serving so that whatever was left over, I could bottle and put away without it all getting soaked up. I've made this a couple of times and it has always come out a winner.

This soup was good, but adjustments had to be made.  The first time I made it there was way too much pasta. I followed the recipe exactly and it was good, but there was no broth, the pasta soaked it all up.  The second time I made it, I did not use water, but veggie stock instead and I used about 1 1/2 cups pasta.  I think next time I will decrease that to 1 cup of pasta or serve the soup over cooked pasta instead of cooking the pasta in the soup, as another person suggested.

This was good.  I did make some adjustments with the spices as I found it to be a little bland.  I find that with any soups the veggies taste better if you saute them a bit to soften them up before adding the liquids.  I will definitely make this again.

I loved this soup. Added some frozen chopped spinach. The only problem I had was that even cutting the pasta back to half I had to add about 3 extra cups of broth because the pasta had absorbed most of what was there. Next time I will cut it back even further or omit it all together.

This is a good basic soup.  I made it really close to the recipe but I omited the potatoes (was out and with noodles didnt really need them), I added Italian parsley (I had some and needed to use it up), and I only used about 1 and 1/4 cup of noodles.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for sharing, m.   Edit: I forgot I used beef broth because I couldnt find veggie broth at the store.

This is a very good soup! I added and took some ingredients off , I went by what I had on hand. One thing that is very important is to cook your macaroni before hand and then add it to the soup, or it will absorb all your liquid. I didn't use potato, added 1 c. cooked macaroni shells, mushrooms & spinach. Lovely! Very filling and good for you! Also did it all in a crock pot so no need for the oil! :)

Very tasty soup!! I also added more water, almost added 2 cans of tomato paste, 5 cloves garlic, half the pasta, one zucchini. I added the basil and oregano at the end. By the time we were done eating, the soup turned into a stew. I will have to add again more liquid tomorrow. Very flavorful and easy to make. one of my favorites now.

This was great. I cut back on some of the veggies and used 3 potatoes, 4 carrots, and 3 stalks of celery. I doubled the broth and halved the pasta as suggested by other reviews. I also added a can of petite diced tomatoes and 1 zucchini and 1 small yellow squash. And unlike some of the other recipes on here when this recipe says 12 servings it MEANS 12 servings. Lots of leftovers.

I too cut back on the carrot, potatoes, and celery, though left onion and garlic the same (how can you ever have too much onion and garlic?)  I like to chop and add as I go, so start with the onion, saute while chopping the garlic, add the garlic, etc...Then I eye-balled the liquids to my taste preference.  It's soup, there is no need to follow directions and amounts exactly!  I took other people's advice and cooked the pasta separately and added a bunch of spinach, as it was in my fridge.  I only had fresh basil, so dried oregano went in along with a bay leaf.  I love diced tomatoes, so added those too. I thought it was a great basic soup recipe that is ideal for substitutions, additions, and experimentation according to taste.  A garnish of parmesan is the ticket.  Cheers.

Loved the texture of the different veggies coming together with the beans, potatoes and pasta. Makes for a hearty soup. However, flavor is king, and this soup is pretty bland.

Was a pretty delicious soup.  I did make a few changes.  I left out the celery (I'm not a fan) and the potatoes (helps cut down on the carbs).  In place of the potatoes I substitued an 14.5 oz. can of green beans (reserve about 1/2 c. juice).  I also substitued the vegetable broth with just plain old chicken broth, and added the reserved green bean juice.  I put dried herbs in because I didn't have fresh ones.  Just feel it out to your own tastes.  I would recommend putting the kidney beans in a little later because they were a little mushy, and cooking the noodles separate till al dante or just a little before that so when you add it to the soup, they are just right.  And for my secret to the soup, I add a little red pepper flakes to give a nice heat to the aftertaste.

This was so good! I used about 10 baby carrots, chopped, maybe ½ a yellow onion, and I used some garlic powder instead of the cloves of garlic. Instead of vegetable broth, I used more like 2 quarts (total) of water with a tablespoon of beef boullion powder mixed in. And instead of the fresh herbs, I used maybe 1½ or 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning (the saltless dry herb blend). I used maybe a teaspoon of salt, and I added a few shakes of pepper. It was so very good! And the next day, it tasted even better! I like to mix sour cream into my bowl, but it's very good without! Thank you so much for sharing this, Corrigan!

This recipe is fabulous!  I was craving a lighter soup so I suggested to my husband that I make minestrone.  He informed me that he was not much of a "minestrone soup kind of guy".  I went ahead and made it anyway, and he had 3 helpings!  He loved it!  Also, my 6 year old gobbled it down and when he woke up the next morning he requested the leftover soup for breakfast!  I did make a few modifications only because I didn't have all the ingredients... I substitued the fresh spices for dried and used chicken broth in place of the vegetable broth This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was excellent.  It had a lot more flavor than I expected.  I made exactly as written but I intended to eat it throughout the week so I boiled the pasta but stored it separately until I was ready to eat.

Pretty good. Wasn't as flavorful as I'd hoped-left me thinking it needs cheese tortellini instead of regular pasta..or italian sausage or something to liven it up. As others suggested, I added the pasta only to the serving bowls not the entire pot. Will tweak and madge again sometime.

Good stuff. I left out the pasta as I'm sensitive to gluten. I took other reviewers suggestions and sauteed the onions first, then added the garlic. I used 16 oz. of vegetable broth and then put in enough water til it looked right. I used dried herbs. I had to cook it longer to get the veggies soft. Leftovers were great. It made a LOT of soup - I gave decent portions away to two friends.

The result was good 'cause I ended up adding mushrooms, and sauteing them first with garlic and onions, then added all the rest to the broth. My hubby loved it! Gave it 4 stars 'cause i don't like how the recipe calls for dumping all together and pretty much just boiling...

Good soup. After reading the reviews, I added a couple extra cups of broth and cooked the macaroni separately so it wouldn't be too stew-like. I also added a can of white beans in addition to the kidney beans to add some extra protein. It was pretty good, but just a little on the bland side. Like most soups, it's much better the next day.

i did make this into a smaller batch, but wow this was fantastic!  i used a sweet potato instead of white potato and the starchiness was much less noticable...i ran out of stock when the water level boiled off a bit and instead of adding water, which loses the flvours i added a puch of french onion soup mix and then added some water.  it adds a beefy flavour.  haven't eaten it yet but it smells amazing!  even though it is 35 degrees celcius i am cooking it anyway!

I loosely followed this recipe and am excited to have found the combo of ingredients similar to the old Minestrone soup recipe that I had clipped from the Vancouver Sun eons ago but have now lost. Unfortunately my pot was not big enough to accommodate all the ingredients! I left out the pasta and still the soup ate like a stew!  I used an 820g can of diced tomatoes, no tomato paste, garbanzo beans instead of kidney  and two onions instead of one. My cooking order was a lot  different too: sauteed onions for 3 min, added garlic and continued cooking for another min or two. Added chopped celery and the basil and oregano and cooked for three mins with the lid on. Added the can of tomatoes, two cans of water and  the vegetable broth, followed by all the veggies except the corn. Added some freshly ground pepper and a bit of salt. About 40 minutes before serving I added the garbanzo beans and corn kernels. I would  have added the pasta at this point had I used it.

This is a great basic recipe to adjust to your preferences. For people saying there was "too much veggies," I see part of the issue that it lists number of vegetables rather than the measurements: Use your judgment, just pay attention to the ratios. For those saying it's "bland", like any recipe you have to tweak things to your taste. I simmered it with crushed red pepper flakes, added black pepper, used dry basil and fresh marjoram and Italian parsley from my garden. I *always* sautee garlic and onion first, until they carmelize. Chop the onion, add to the oil, simmer while chopping garlic, add that to the oil, chop other veggies. Rather than tomato paste I used leftover homemade pizza sauce. Used tomato bouillon cube and water in place of broth because that's what I had on hand. The recommendations to use V8 are good ones, have had great results doing that with minestrone in the past. I think the recipe calls for way too much salt. Hubby has high BP so I didn't add any to the recipe, just salted the bowl lightly. Parmesean on top is a must! Had potatoes on hand, but I think zucchini would be better in its place. Next time will take the recommendation of pre-cooking the pasta. I've always had the problem that my minestrone ends up drying up (easily fixed with more broth the next day) so I appreciate the tip! Overall this is a fantastic basic recipe.

I used this recipe as a base for my soup and ended up with something fantastic! I made the following changes: used chicken broth instead of veggie broth; tomato sauce instead of tomato paste; and canned green beans (drained) instead of kidney beans. I also skipped adding macaroni since I figured the potatoes added enough starch to the soup; I didn't miss the pasta, but my boyfriend did. Also, since it's the middle of winter and I didn't feel like paying an arm and a leg for fresh herbs, I used dried Italian seasoning. A great recipe, and easy to change according to your preferences. Thanks for sharing!

This didn't work for me.  It was way underseasoned and, after the macaroni cooked, had no broth left in it at all.  Flavor was also missing.  It probably would have been better to saute the onions and garlic until browned before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I'll pass on this minestrone.

Very easy to make, I used a little more vegetable broth than stated (double) to give it a little more flavor, I will definitely make this again.

Great tasting soup! I followed the instructions to the letter except for a couple additions. I added 1 can of rinsed garbanzo beans, about 12 ounces of canned chopped tomatoes that I wanted to use up and also added additional vegetable broth to thin it down. I did pre-cook the pasta (as others suggested) before adding it. My soup took substantially longer to cook than the recipe said but I just kept cooking until veggies were tender, no problem. This is VERY good tasting and nutritious and even my meat eating son enjoyed it. I will definitely keep this recipe and be making it again. Thanks much for sharing a good one!

This soup is wonderful and very filling. I did end up using more broth maybe up to 24 oz more, per another reviewer. Glad I did so I didn't end up with stew the next day, it was still soup. I will continue to make this soup, I love it with the small change, this freezes well too. Grated parmesan cheese is wonderful on this after ladled into bowls, and crusty bread is a must! Thanks for submitting (:

I made this last night for my family and was rather dissapointed.  I followed the advise of those who had previously complained that it was too dry and added an extra can of vegetable stock.  Firstly, the preperation of peeling, cutting and cleaning all vegetables was well over twenty minutes if you work alone (it took me almost 45 minutes).  Secondly the soup was just bland.  It did not have much flavor what-so-ever.

GREAT SOUP.  I added canned tomatoes in puree instead of tom. paste because we like the tomatoes in soup. It was great. Excellent recipe. Thanks

After some changes, fabulous. I replaced all of the water called for with veggie broth and then also added about 28 oz of chicken stock. Concerned about broth evaporating, I only used 1 potato, and diced it small so every bowl had potato in it. I would recommend if you use all broth, cut back on the salt a bit. Also, I prepared the pasta separately and just added it to each bowl.

I like this recipe. I followed what other suggested though and used half the veggies and I also added have a box of frozen spinach. I over baked the noodles though so they're soggy but the soup itself is good. Will make again but definately reduce the amount to half liquide and quarter of the veggies. 
This is how I made it though cause it seemed to be missing directions. I put the oil in a large pan and added the veggies to them on medium heat and cooked them for a few minutes to soften them up a little. I also simmered everything together for approx and hour then added the noodles and cook until noodles are done.

This recipe was amazing. The only change I made last time I made it was I used northern beans instead of kidney beans (forgot to get the beans at the store so I used what I had). I also made the macaroni on the side and then added it when needed.

The preparation instructions reduced my rating.  I sauteed the carrots, onion, celery, and garlic and blanched the potatoes in boiling water for 5 min. before mixing other ingredients (otherwise you have very crisp veggies).  I agree with the earlier reviewer adding the fresh herbs with the pasta. I added fresh-ground black pepper to the sautee.  Otherwise it is very delicious.

This was easy to put together and didn't take many ingredients. I did have to add a LOT more liquid as there wasn't much to cook the pasta in. I added beef broth since I didn't have vegetable on hand. I cut this in half and it still made a huge pot full of soup, 3 qts. My son complained there was too much green stuff, but I don't know whether to cut back on the oregano or the basil or both. He still ate a bowl full. Hubby thought it was too rich and too stew-like and not soupy enough. This made a decent meal and was fairly quick to get together, all done in about an hour. I'm not sure I'll make this one again though as my family just wasn't "wowed". Thanks anyway.

Easy to make, and delicious. I left out the pasta because there was way too little liquid for it to cook, but I prefer no pasta in my minestone anyway. I halved the recipe to 6 portions, and if I'd added in more liquid and pasta it would have made 6 very large meal-sied portions. I refrigerated and froze some in individual portions and it still tasted great. Will be making this again.

I used homemade vegetable stock that I made first.  This soup is very healthy and satisfying.  I used almost double the stock as written and only half the pasta.  It came out great.  I added zucchini; any vegetable you like will work fine.  Cannot wait to make this again.

This recipe was very good however i did take the advice on adding 24 oz's more vegetable stock and it took longer than an hour before the vegtable were done. The end result was a great tasting soup everyone enjoyed. I will make this again!

Not enough liquid. Way too many vegetables and maccaroni and not nearly enough broth. I recommend double the vegetable broth and half the potatoes and maccaroni.

A great meal for cold autumn nights.  Within an hour or so most of the broth disappeared, but it still made delicious 'stewy' leftovers.  Instead of water I used vegetable broth.  Yum!

After reading the reviews...I also adjusted the recipe.  I only used 2 potatoes; and 2 carrots.  I added a can of green beans and sliced up a fresh zucchini.  I didn't use celery.  I used a can of diced tomato instead of tomato paste.  I used 2 large cans vegetable broth.  Instead of adding water...I added 3 cups of V8 Hot and Spicy Juice.  Instead of fresh herbs...I used 2 tsp. Italian Seasoning. I only used 1 cup of small pasta.  The V8 really added a nice spicy taste and the soup turned out great; especially the leftovers!  My family loved it...and I will definately make this again.  Thanks for a great soup!

Fantastic recipe!  Kudos to you.  I followed most of the directions, but found pureeing the celery and garlic to be more towards my taste-- it provides a creamier, thicker soup without altering the flavor.  Still, the method you described works just fine.

This soup was absolutely delicious! It is just what I wanted on a cold, rainy day - hearty and flavourful. I made a few minor changes, using some chopped fresh green beans and fresh peas in place of the celery, and adding some fresh parsley in addition to the basil and oregano. I only used 1 tbsp of oil and 1/2 tsp of salt, and 900 mL of vegetable stock (I get confused by American quarts, ounces, etc.) 
This is the kind of recipe that will easily become a family tradition.

Delicious!! I made this for a friend who is vegetarian and all of us who had lunch together enjoyed it!  It was so easy to put together and as the previous comments noted, the ingredients are easily adapted to your taste or what you have on hand.  I even had meatless sausage I added to it that tasted perfect.  I am more open to trying more meatless meals after trying this and will keep this in my file for a heart-warming, home-cooked meal.  This makes a LOT so half it if it's not for a big group and add more water or broth as suggested before, mine needed at least 3 more cans of broth or water for a full batch.

Boy is this good! Just the kind of minestrone I was looking for. I played around with the ratios a bit based on what I had on hand, and had to up the liquids a lot to avoid getting a stew. But the result is mind-blowingly faboulous. After tasting it I decided to invite some friends over to help polish it off, it is well-worthy to feed to company. What it could use is a bit of green: zucchini or green beans. May throw some in next time.

This was really good and very easy to make.  I didn't have the fresh herbs on hand so I used dry and they worked great.  I also used only 4 potatoes, added a little extra liquid at the end and served it with crusty bread - delicious.  My husband loved it.  Thanks!

my family loved this soup, and it was great as leftovers. I thought i had Oregano at home, but I didnt, so I used a couple of spoonfulls of some fresh pesto i had in the fridge. Turned out GREAT! I think i might add some diced sweet potato next time.

Great soup! So easy and tasty. I added a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes and used ditalini, which I cooked separately and added before serving.

I like the list of ingredients in this recipe for portions you need.  I switched it up, I did one medium zucchini chopped. And instead of oregano and basil I used 2 tablespoons of Italian seasoning and 2 bay leafs. with a pinch of ground pepper. I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. It was great!

I love minestrone from the national Italian chain restaurant and wanted to try my hand, I am not a cook by any means, so the simplicity of this recipe encouraged me to try.  The first time was a success with my entire, carnivore, family. My family is large, and we love it the next night too, so I usually triple the ingredients. I add green beans, garbanzo beans, some red pepper flakes, and use small shell pasta.

This is a very healthy recipe, what with all the vegetables.  However, we found it to be a little bland.  Were I too make it again, I would definitely add additional spices:  Italian seasoning, maybe a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes, something.

Wow! This was delightful!  The only changes I made was to halve it, use chicken broth instead of vegetable b/c that's what I had, doubled the beans, used about 1/2 of the amount of macaroni and only simmered w/ them for about 5 mins, and used a healthy squirt of ketchup instead of tomato paste - b/c I just don't like the flavor of the paste. LOVED this soup! Perfect hearty soup for the cooler weather! update: noodles did swell up, but still delicious.

Delicious soup!  I was a little worried that it would just turn out plain, but I was wrong.  The flavors were perfect and it actually turned out quite flavorful.  The only thing that I found off was the cook and prep time, but that is no big deal.  This is a definite keeper for the winter months.

5 stars for the soup base - 4 1/2 stars overall ... not sure if all my veggies were jumbo sized or what, but after adding everything there was waaaaay too much stuff not enough broth, I had to go back and make more broth.  I'll definitely use this recipe again, just maybe use half of all the veggies.

This was wonderful soup! And made a ton so I will freeze it and have lunches for the next several days! After reading the reviews, I increased the vegetable broth by using a 32 oz container of the broth. I also used cooked pasta, 2 cups, instead of putting it in there uncooked. And I omitted the celery, just because I don't really care for it. Some of the most delicious ministrone I've ever had!

Soup was yummy but it was missing a bit of soul...so I added a few dashes of hot sauce.  That did the trick!  There are no leftovers.

We made this exactly as the recipe stated and there was no broth at all. The flavor was ok, but kind of dull. It wasn't as good as restaurant minestrone. I was dissapointed. I might try this again with some modifications.

Made this last night for dinner and it was a big hit!  The only change I made was I used onion powder instead of an onion, and I put in 1 extra can of broth, and used only 1 cup of macaroni.  It was perfect!!  Even better the next day for lunch!!  Yum!

I'm not giving it a 5 until I figure out the right proportions for this recipe.  Soup ended up like a stew, as another reviewer wrote.  I like the flavor, but the liquid pretty much disappeared once I put in the pasta.

I made this for the first time tonight, taking the advice of other reviewers. I added 1 can of diced tomatoes, I also sauteed the onions and garlic for a few minutes before adding the other ingredients and waited longer to add the herbs. I used 6 cloves of minced garlic and a 32oz container of organic veggie broth PLUS 3 cups of water. It was very flavorful but when I went to pack up the leftovers, most of the liquid had been absorbed. By the time I read the advice of cutting down on the veggies, it was too late. I would just either use even more broth & water next time or use less veggies. Oh and I added green beans too. A rare dish when the whole family enjoys it, a very picky husband, a 6 year old and 10 month old - all couldn't get enough!

I feel this recipe has potential but not with the instructions listed. After reading some reviews I also doubled the amount of liquid in this recipe but made the mistake of cutting the pasta amount in half. I think it's one or the other. Either use more broth OR cut the pasta in half. 30 minutes was nowhere near long enough to cook my veggies and I chopped them up small too.

needed way more broth. As others said the pasta absorbs all the liquid. I used chicken broth rather than vegetable which gave it good flavor. I skipped the potatoes too. 
Very good, will make it again!

I agree with Aspiring Chef Rita. The pasta soaked up all my liquid, even after I'd added plenty extra; every time I reheat some leftovers, I have to add a little more water/broth to it. It was also a bit bland for my taste (perhaps because I kept having to dilute it with more liquid), so I added a few shakes of an Italian herbs mix.

This wasn't bad, but I agree with the rest of the comments. This was way too thick. More like red mashed potato cassarole with macaroni in it.Double up on the liquids or half everything but, because this would never make a soupy mixture. I won't make this again just for the fact that it didn't even taste that great.

This soup was excellent!  My husband really liked it so much that he wants me to make it again!  I used light kidney beans instead of dark ones.  My dad and his girlfriend even liked it a lot.  My dad went back for seconds and thirds.  A good compliment to this soup is some garlic bread.  Will make again.

A very yummy soup.  I made the following changes to the posted recipe: left out potatoes; used 2 cans of tomato paste; vegetable broth instead of water and cooked the pasta separately and then added it to each bowl.

I'm giving this a 5 stars but only because i read the reviews. i also added extra broth and used veg and beef broth.  i only used half a cup of pasta otherwise it would of been way too much. i also used 2 cans of tomato paste due to preference and added brocoli which really doesnt belong in this soup but i had lots and needed to use it.  it turned out great.

Made a few changes with this.  Used dried herbs instead of fresh, left out the celery, added an additional can of veggie broth, added a few shakes of red pepper flakes, and used only 1 cup of macaroni (uncooked). This is very good! Quick and easy to make.

I add corn and fresh parsley. If you are going to freeze some of the soup, set aside the amount to be frozen before adding the pasta...otherwise you'll have mush!

My husband and I love this soup, as do the grandsons.  I precook the carrots, celery, and onions in the oil.  I parboil the potatoes and precook the macaroni.  Allow to sit a couple of hours to blend.  Delicious.

This was a very good recipe, but I did make a few changes.  I added zucchini, 1 can green beans (with juice) and garbanzo beans.  I'll tweak it again next time by adding more spices as I thought it was a bit bland.  My husband loved it and went back for seconds so that was a good sign!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Made this for dinner with family last night.  This was pretty good.  Ended up using vegetable boulion cubes instead of broth and added a large bag of frozen mixed veggies.  There was so much soup! Will play with herbs for better flavor next time.

My husband doesn't normally like minestrone soups because they are too "thin" but the tomato paste in this recipe made the base thicker and he loved this.  This is definitely going to stay in our soup repertoire.

Followed the recipe exactly except used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth - and ended up having to add about 6 more ounces than the recipe called for.  This was pretty good - although really just a glorified vegetable soup.

Wonderful recipe, except it is absoutely necessary to double the liquid.  I did so and on the second day it still had absorbed almost all of it.

This recipe was easy, delicious and full of great veggies!  I am a home schooling mommy of 4 and this was a great comfort meal on a rainy and cold day.  Thank you and G-d bless you.

This was a great soup for a cold day. Only change I made was to use beef broth instead of vegetable broth. Also just cut down on the liquids so we wouldn't have so much. I also added a small can of V8 to beef up the tomato flavor and a few extra spices for overall seasoning. Very good!

I think the recipe is a good starting point, but a little bland.  I would cut back on the potatoes next time, and try adding diced tomatoes with their juice, plus extra garlic, basil and oregano.  My soup was really thick, like a stew, especially after sitting overnight.

Great! Added one small can of tomato sauce, zuccini, ground pepper, and doubled the basil. Used about 1 T dried oregano instead of fresh. I also only put half the salt. My 1 and 3 year old liked it too!
