SO GOOD!  This turned out exactly as described.  Creamy on the top and dense on the bottom meaning custard on the top and rice pudding on the bottom!  I tried to capture that in my photo.  This was really tasty.  Too much water was used for cooking the rice so I poured it through a colander after 25 minutes and the rice tasted done.  I did use vanilla bean paste in place of the vanilla extract, and, because I had a large serving of vanilla pudding mix, I increased the recipe by half changing the servings to read 9.  I got almost all of it into my 8 inch square baking dish.  I left out about 1/4 cup so I wouldn't spill it putting it in the oven.  When served, I sprinkled with cinnamon.  Hubby says, "where's the raisins?"   I told him next time.  There will be a next time.   Thank you KOKO48 for sharing!

So, I made 1 adjustment on accident.... I went to add the pudding mix and realized I only had chocolate, I rolled with it. My only complaint doesn't have anything to do with my added chocolate flavor, it has a very distinctive pudding mix texture mixed in which is not something I really want in a rice pudding. However, my kids love pudding mixes so this is just fine with them.

So delicious! I will make this again, everyone loved it! The instructions are easy and straightforward.Followed to the tee, the recipe was 5 stars. Consistency was perfect, dense, almost like a bread pudding custard.  

Second time I made this, I added rum-soaked raisins and wow! 6 stars! 

*I have also substituted a package of serve and cook tapioca pudding for the vanilla pudding because that's all I had on hand. I think it will be a permanent change for me!  Highly recommend giving this recipe a try!!

Perfect! Eggy and sweet by not too much. Serve w while milk or whipped cream and cinnamon. I added raisins before baking.
