Delicious - perfect balance of flavors.  I scaled the recipe back and cut the chicken breasts into medallions; therefore I marinated the medallions for 45 minutes and baked it for 30 minutes at 325º.  I served the chicken medallions over mixed greens so I used the marinade that had cooked and thickened during the baking process as the salad dressing. I didn’t have fresh ginger so I substituted dried ginger and used cider vinegar.  Perfect - can’t get any easier or tastier than this.  Added note:  I made this again cutting them into medallions only this time I grilled them on the grill with excellent results.  It's a fast, easy and tasty dish.

I made the marinade the day before and let the chicken sit in it over night.  Then I just popped it in the oven to cook.  Super easy, absolutely delicious! And, mine wasn't black (as happened to a previous reviewer) it cooked up beautifully! In fact, I'm having the leftovers for lunch right now!!

This was very good. I added a little sesame oil because I like the flavor in chinese style dishes and a few drops of chinese hot oil to give it a little heat. Yummy!

I scaled the recipe down for two breast for just the husband and I. When I went to get sugar I realized we were out of white sugar...like that ever happens? So I used brown sugar instead. I used Balsamic vinegar, since it wasn't specified what kind to use. We grilled our breast on charcoal and I cooked the leftover marinade on the stove top to thicken and baste the chicken. I forgot the tablespoon of water, wasn't needed. Next time I make I might put in a teaspoon of chili sauce and add some minced onion for more flavoring.

The weather has been surprisingly warm for the month of March in Ohio, so I decided to make this recipe, but in order to take advantage of the nicer weather, we grilled it rather than baking it.  I made half the marinade for two chicken breast halves but I only added the cornstarch to half of it.  I marinated in the half without the cornstarch.  I heated the other half that included the cornstarch on the stovetop until thickened and bubbly.  Hubs grilled the chicken, basting with the thickened sauce during the last few minutes, which produced some beautiful looking chicken coming off the grill.  While we thought this was quite good, it may not be our absolute favorite – a little too heavy on the soy sauce flavor for us.  But that didn’t stop us from polishing off every bite!

This recipe was not what I was expecting - it didn't taste anything like sweet & sour chicken.  It reminded me of an Asian bottle marinade that we use.  All you could taste was soy sauce and it wasn't even sweet, or sour for that matter.  The color was not appealing either, it was almost black (like soy sauce) when it came out of the oven.  Sorry, just didn't care for this receipe.

My husband told me he loved  it each time he ate it - high praise for your recipe!  I baked it in the oven and we had it for dinner twice. Flavor was wonderful and the chicken moist both times. Great recipe, easy to do and tastes great! Thanks very much!

Such a great recipe!!! My niece and boyfriend tore it up!!! Didn't have vinegar, but it came out bomb anyway. The marinating really makes a difference! Oh and used boneless chicken thighs instead of dry a** breasts??

Nothing like sweet and sour chicken. The husband took maybe 2 bites. The kids and i ate it, but only because we try not to be wasteful.

was good per Bob  and had it with rice. I found the 40 minutes was too long on the chicken (small breasts) they were a little tough. If using snaller breasts adjust the time.

I used agave instead of white sugar and added extra crushed garlic, because we love garlic. Flavor was good! And as some other reviewers did, we cooked on the grill. It’s not as sweet as most “sweet and sour” recipes, but I prefer it less sweet anyway.

The first time I make anything ,I follow the recipe to the letter.It was phenomenal. This time I added a little sesame oil and barbecued it low and slow. More of a weekend thing. Same results,just a little twist. Doubled up the recipe since I made the whole bird. Next time maybe some sesame seeds on the last baste. Wish me luck Traveler, thank you so much.

Tried baking in oven per recipe, but chicken not done in 40 min. Next time either bake longer (60 min?) or up oven temp to 350. Even cut the thick breasts thinner before baking.  Added some crushed pineapple w/juice and used less sugar and vinegar b/c of pineapple.  Was good!

The sauce was very flavorful as written, I did have to use ground ginger as I didn't have fresh on hand, and based on other reviews I used apple cider vinegar.  I used the marinade with pork chops which went very well with it, and served with steamed broccoli and white rice.  This was an easy weeknight meal I will definately make again.
