Good and easy.  Would recommend increasing the meat to at least 5 slices per sandwich.  Add a little spicy mustard for added kick.

This was absolutely delicious! I wasn't sure at first about this recipe as I had never thought about using cider vinegar and honey in a recipe like this, but all of the flavors came together wonderfully. Even my picky 2-year-old was asking for seconds.

Loved it. Since I didn't have all the ingredents I had to make a few changes such as leaving out the cilantro and using a differnt ype of bread.
