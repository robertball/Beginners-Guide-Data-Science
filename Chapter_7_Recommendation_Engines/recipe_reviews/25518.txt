I made this for a pot luck at work and everyone enjoyed it.  I saw people using it as a vegetable, tortilla and pretzel dip.  Instead of sour cream I used some drained yogurt that I had on hand (I let the yogurt drain overnight in a cheesecloth).  I was afraid that four heads of garlic might be a bit excessive, but it wasn't.  I think it'd also be tasty in place of hummus on a sandwich.

Whilo not a terrible dip, I thought it was a little boring.  There are several other dips I'd make before this one.

The garlic flavor was too strong, and I usually love a lot of garlic.

This is great.  At first I was disappointed bc I couldn't taste rosemary.  Then I realized that I didn't actually follow the directions (this is not an unusual occurence for me!) and roasted the garlic in the skin, so of course there was no rosemary flavor.  So I added some rosemary and I'm happy.  Next time I'll try with roasting garlic without the skin and with the rosemary.  Thanks!

I made a couple small changes, but nne of them drastic - only had three heads of garlic, and that was just right for this recipe.  Also, no dried rosemary so I used an Italian seasoning blend that had rosemary, oregano, marjoram, basil and thyme and that worked fine.  Finally, I only had cannelini beans on hand and that also worked fine - I actually think I prefer them as they are a bit creamier than navy beans.  The result was one excellent dip!  I do think that for us an extra head of garlic might have been too much, but otherwise this is one of my favorites now.  Great for veggies, toasted pita wedges, tortilla chips or even crackers.

This was pretty good. But I made this to go with carrots - not so good! I think it would taste awesome on tacos though. Also, I used only half the garlic - it was more than plenty. My garlic LOVING husband said it was a bit too much. But I might make it again to use in place of refried beans.

I'll agree with another reviewer...way too much garlic initially (and I'm a garlic fan).

However, I did make some changes, and I think this dip will work fine. First, I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream and increased it to 3/4 cup. I also added two tablespoons of lemon juice for a bit of zip. Caramelized the onion for some sweetness (from the recipe, I think that's a bit longer than originally stated). 
The main changes I made were in the spices. I used 1 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp each of ground coriander, sumac, Aleppo pepper and paprika and then a pinch of Cayenne.
With the changes made, I think this one served with pita bread will be a staple for us when we're doing a Mediterranean/North African menu.

Wow!!! I really enjoyed this recipe. It's full of flavor, easy and versatile.  I used different beans but stuck to the recipe otherwise. It's worth a try and would be a hit at any party.

Not terrible, but boring. Pretty flavorless, considering everything that goes into it. It's lacking acid.

Relatively healthy, but just didn't have that something to bring it to 5 stars.

I attempted this twice.  The first I did half roasted and half minced garlic.  Soaked my own beans and it still was lacking.  Second attempt  I added extra rosemary and cumin and roasted 7 heads of garlic and it was still bland.  I hate to sound so negative, but I LOVE garlic and hate to waste it on such a tasteless dish.

Great taste.  Very minor changes.  Used 2 heaping teaspoons of minced garlic from a jar which I added to the saut√©ed onion just a minute or 2 before  onion was cooked.  Used fresh rosemary.  Will use this dip as a sauce over zucchini noodles as well.  I liked the taste of this dip with carrots

This is my first review of anything on here.  This is worth the time and an amazing dip, very full of flavor!  I didn't have dried dried rosemary but used fresh from the garden.  My Husband absolutely loved it!

Was out of rosemary so I used my usual Italian seasoning to roast the garlic. Used cannellini beans from the freezer because they were ready, worked great. Only 2 heads of garlic because that was all I had on hand.  We are huge garlic fans so I planned on adding more  the next day  but I left it as is and it's fine. Spread the bean dip on tortillas for roasted 
veggie tacos which made them better than they would have been.

This is a wonderful recipe.  We serve the dip on a grilled or broiled baguette that has been sprinkled with olive oil, salt and pepper.
