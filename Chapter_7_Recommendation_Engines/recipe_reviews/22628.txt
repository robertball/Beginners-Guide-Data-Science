Loved this recipe!! I used brown sugar instead of white, added about 1/8 teaspoon of  pumpkin pie spice. Instead of a yellow cake, I used a butter cake...IT WAS TO DIE FOR!!! Made several for a bake sale...didn't have any left over!!

I made this using sweetened evaporated milk and omitted the sugar.I also added all spice and three eggs. I was fabluous. I will make this again and again. Oh the last time I added 1/2 pkg chocolate chips, and the kids loved it. Thanks again.

I didn't add the pecans, but maybe that would have helped.  I did drizzle quite a bit of butter over the top, but every place that didn't get butter was just raw cake mix in the finished product.  I thought it would soak up the pumpkin mixture.  Maybe I should have patted it down into the pumpkin mixture?

This recipe used twice the amt of pumpkin than a similar recipe my mom has and I really like the thicker pumpkin layer.  Yum!  I made it in 2 8x8 pans, giving one away and keeping one for here at home. I probably should have taken it out at 50 min, but let it in 5 min more, but it is still great.

I made this dessert and got RAVE reviews.  I followed some of the other reviewer's and added more cinammon (about a tsp)  and added about 1 tsp Pumpkin Pie spice.  We did wait more than one day to dig in and the wait was well worth it!  I've already emailed this recipe to others.

This was the first cake I ever made (I had to actually buy a 9 x 13 pan), and it came out perfect!   I couldn't find yellow cake mix in precisely 18.25 oz so I used 16+ oz instead, and I didn't miss a thing.  I also used 2 cups of cinnamon sugared pecans which I found at Whole Foods, and that added a lot to an already excellent recipe.  I used 30 oz of pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling), and though I had been skeptical, it came out every bit as hedonistically yummy as I could imagine, and not too gooey.

Excellent!  This has become one of my new favorite Thanksgiving Day desserts.  I almost prefer it over a regular pumpkin pie!

Great flavor. Crust was very thick and difficult to cut without making a mess. Inverted onto a plate and took care of that problem.

i made this because we accidently made too much mix for pumpkin pie, so instead of making 4 pumpkin pies we made some of this! 
it was good, but we didnt eat all of it, and ended up throwing half of it out.

This is a great dessert! My family loved it and they are not afraid to tell me the truth! I used pumpkin pie filling from the can and added about 3/4 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. This is a keeper!

Never made anything with Pumpkin before. So I used canned pumpkin. I did use a little over 3/4 cup butter to make sure the cake batter wasn't too dry. This cake was to die for. Everyone loved it and none left over.

Absolutely wonderful.  Love it more than real pumpkin pie.  Followed recipe exactly except for cutting back on the butter.   3/4s of a cup seemed like too much so I cut out 2 tablespoons.

I made this exactly as directed and was quite disappointed. I was skeptical about just sprinkling the cake mix and drizzling butter on top but I figured some magic must happen and it would bake up nice. It didn't. It was like bland pumpkin pie with dry cake mix on top. Maybe some people like the taste of straight cake mix, but no one at my dinner party ate more than a couple bites.

Made recipe as stated and it was fantastic!  Took it to an anniversary party not realizing there would be cake and ice cream so I thought it wouldn't be eaten... WRONG!  Not a crumb was left!

Really like it but made some pretty drastic changes: Halved the sugar; two eggs; 4t pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon; no salt; doubled the pecans and left whole; halved the butter (if you melt and "froth" the butter til slightly brown first, its taste is greatly enhanced); and used about 1/6 of a spice cake mix on top.

I found a recipe almost exactly the same in a school fundraiser cookbook, and it is, indeed, to die for! I don't like pumpkin pie, but I LOVE this, as does everyone who tries it! The only difference from this recipe is that the original called for pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon. It makes for a more complex, pumpkin pie-ey flavor. I've lost the original recipe, so I'm going to have to make it to taste, and then update my review with a recommended substitution.

If you love pumpkin pie but hate soggy piecrust this is the one to try! I spice the filling with my own favorites...cinnamon, ginger and cloves. But omit the salt...I don't see why you need it. I would like to try other flavors of cake mix. Might be good with spice cake??
Definitely better served cold.

I was given this recipe years ago from a close family friend!   Absolutely, the most wonderful way to combine a pie and cake...I love this recipe!
