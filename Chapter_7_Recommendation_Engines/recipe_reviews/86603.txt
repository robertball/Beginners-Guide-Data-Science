I thought this was great. I made a couple of changes in that I used V8 vegetable juice and 1 can chicken broth instead of the beef bouillon. I also omitted the cabbage and okra. The soup was hardy and perfect on a cool fall evening. Thanks for sharing!

Great for a cool fall night.
I used cubed stew meat, in bite size
pieces. Instead of ground beef, It turned out real good

Pretty good soup for a cold winter day.I left the okra out the second time as I thought it made the soup kinda slimey.Overall I would make again.Thanks for the post.

When I originally listed the recipe - I used Butter Beans instead of Lima Beans, as my family are not big on Lima Beans...  The Butter Beans can be found in your frozen vegetable section as well as with you other vegetables.

I use a chuck or rump roast along with a soup bone as my mother has done for years. Definitely a richer broth with a roast vs. ground beef. This is my "deserted island" food choice. My husband and I make it year round.

This is a great soup!  I substituted ground venison instead of ground beef and followed the rest of the recipe.  Simple and great!

Very good and easy- liked the fact that you can change it up easily but the base flavor is great. Will definitely make this again.

The only change I made was instead of the frozen vegetables, I used some leftover corn and green beans.  My husband had three helpings and drank the broth after the third helping.  It was easy, I had most of the ingredients already, and it was delicious.

Was good, I did add turnip to the soup, I always do.  Beyond that I pretty much followed instructions.  Tasted great, but soup during cold weather is always good.

I used 4-6 potatoes and 1 bag ( for coleslaw)of shredded cabbage and carrots  Boiled w/2 C water and 1 can chicken stock about 10 minutes. Saut√©ed in olive oil, med. onion,  1/4 C celery, and 1T garlic. Cooked about 10 minutes, put in w/potatoes. Then I added 2 14oz cans V8, 1 can chicken broth, 1 can beef broth, 1 can Italian tomatoes, 1 can mixed vegetables,  1 bag frozen corn, 2 beef bouillon cubes, 1 T Worcestershire, and 1 T bacon grease. Seasoned with celery salt, onion powder, garlic powder, fat pinch of cumin, salt and pepper. Instead of ground beef, I used leftover beef roast. Will try different vegetables next time. Very good soup!!

This was a delicious mix of vegetables, in the future I would add a little cumin & cilantro to spice.
