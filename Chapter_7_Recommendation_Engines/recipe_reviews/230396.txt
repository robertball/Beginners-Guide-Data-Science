This bread was great!  I didn't have potato flakes so I didn't use them and took out 1/4 cup of water since I researched how much water is used to reconstitute them. I used regular sugar, not demerara, and I didn't have pickle juice so I used sauerkraut juice instead. Since I make a lot of bread I changed up the directions a little.  I mixed the sugar and yeast into about 110 degree water until the yeast became frothy, about 5 minutes. I mixed the flour, rye flour, caraway seeds, and salt together (I would have also mixed the potato flakes in with this dry mixture if I had used them).  I then poured the frothy yeast mixture, sauerkraut juice (or pickle juice)and oil into the dry mixture and mixed them all together. I then kneaded the dough for about 6 minutes with the dough hook in my kitchen aid. I put the dough into an oiled bowl and turned it to coat the whole dough. I let it rise, covered with a towel for about an hour or until doubled in size. I then punched it down and put it in an oiled loaf pan, covered it with a towel and let it rise for about an hour, or until a little over the loaf pan.  I cooked it at 350 degrees on the middle rack of the oven for 35 min.

I live in an area of NY that is blessed with both Jewish delis and bakeries and this bread would be right at home in either.  I free formed my loaf and baked it on my pizza stone.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing, Dad!
3/18/14 the potato flakes aren't strictly necessary, especially if you use bread flour rather than AP.  It simply adds gluten to the recipe, making for a nice rise. Vital wheat gluten would also work.  And the pickle juice doesn't have to be a specific type.  I used the juice from a jar of bread and butter pickles, I have also used both white and cider vinegar. It only imparts the slightest of taste and is primarily used as a dough conditioner.

This bread is absolutely fantastic!  Follow the recipe exactly and you'll get a perfect loaf.  The pickle juice is a must.  

PS:  I'll never understand people who give low ratings to a recipe and admit they changed the recipe completely.  At least try it as written to be able to give an honest rating.

The first time I tried this I did everything by hand. I live in a small town in the far south of Mexico and am an hour and a half from the closest grocery store. I had to substitute light rye flour someone brought me from the States and brown sugar but luckily I make my own dill pickles so I had the juice. It came out good. In the mean time someone gave me a kitchen aid stand mixer and I used it the second time and the bread came out superb!!! I added about half a tablespoon more caraway seeds and used a coffee grinder on half of them and left  the other half whole to give it a stronger caraway flavor. The first loaf was done in a smaller bread pan and this loaf was done in the recipes suggested 5 x 9 pan. Made quite a difference. Made Rubens that were to die for. The hardest part was finding sauerkraut and corned beef. Thanks for the recipe since in 16 years in Mexico I have only seen rye bread twice and both times I got my hopes up and was sorely disappointed. Keep em commin Dad.

This recipe is hands-down, the best recipe for rye bread I have encountered. I have successfully made it in the bread machine, using either the full loaf cycle, or the dough cycle and finishing it off the second rising in a loaf pan then baking it in the oven.  It is perfect as written but sometimes I add 1 heaping tsp. of grainy mustard to enhance the flavor. To change things up I've also substituted demerara sugar with organic barley malt syrup, which is commonly used by bread bakers. Thanks for a fantastic recipe.

Wonderful bread. I did grind the caraway seeds cuz we don't care for the whole seeds. I let it over rise so it deflated a bit when I put it in the oven. In spite of my mistake, this is a delicious & perfect sour rye. Thanks so much for sharing!

Awesome recipe, hubby took one bite and said "better than anything you can buy!" That is his highest praise. 

I could not find dark rye flour anywhere in this town so I had to use the light colored one, the only pickle juice I had was Kosher Dill and I didn't know if that was going to mess up the flavor of the bread so I used apple cider vinegar. I was a little worried because the vinegar smell was so overpowering as I was mixing and waiting for the rises, but it was perfect in the end product. 

I make a lot of bread, this one took 1.5 hours to rise only slightly and I was starting to worry that maybe I had forgotten to add the yeast to the mixture. I let it rise 1.5 hours again on the second rise and still didn't get a really impressive rise out of it. Worried that it hadn't risen enough I took a chance and popped it in the oven - thank goodness for oven spring! I had to cook it about 10 minutes longer than the directions state too. But in the end it was perfection!

This is definitely a keeper recipe. I can't wait to toast a slice up and have it for breakfast with a fried egg. thanks for an awesome recipe!

Really great recipe!  Was looking for a good "New York Jewish Deli - Rye Bread" recipe for my brother's father-in-law, and this hit the mark perfectly!  I had a hard time finding sour pickles, but found an old style deli near me that had a pickle bar and they were more than happy to help me by adding a little more sour pickle juice to my pickle order!  I used a hi-gluten flour - great texture.  I also used the bread machine for the first kneed/rise and had no issues.  I prefer not to bake the bread in the in the machine, and it the recipe worked really well to do it 50/50 like I did.  Next time I make it, I'm going to try and cook it a few minutes longer just to get a little more crust on it (not that it was bad by any means this time).  I am also curious to see how it turns out not cooking it in a loaf pan. Try this recipe - it was really wonderful and the bread is delicious!

I used this recipe the first time I made rye bread.  I didn't have demerara sugar so I substituted brown sugar for it. Also I didn't have sour pickle juice, but I had a jar of sweet/spicy pickles in the fridge and used that instead.  Instead of canola oil I used olive oil.

The loaf came out like a perfect loaf of sandwich bread, complete with the mushrooming over the loaf rim.  The crust was thin between crisp and chewy. The crumb was medium between coarse and close and it was both fluffy and chewy.

I used 3 cups of bread flour and 1 1/2 cups of rye flour and added more to keep dough from sticking to bowl of the mixer, in a ratio of 2 Tbsp. bread flour to 1 Tbsp. rye flour. 
Dough came out silky smooth after being in the mixer for the 8 minutes.
Let raise in the proofer at 74 degrees for an hour, then put in 9 x 5 bread pan, and back in proofer for 1 hour and 15 minutes, for the final fermentation. 
Put in 350 degree oven and steamed the oven and the loaf almost doubled in size.
I usually bake at 460 for 15 minutes, then drop temp to 400 for about 14 minutes and check temp 190. Will do this the next time I make this bread. I make sourdough rye this way and it comes out great.
I live in Tennessee where you can't get good rye bread, so I decided to make my own and am now making it for others.

Absolutely fantastic! Potato flakes give the bread a moist crumb, and pickle juice just augments the rye sour beautifully! Loads of flavor! I made mine swapping molasses for the sugar and it was flat-out perfect! I've made lots of rye bread, this one is the best.

Followed the recipe pretty close. I stirred the yeast in the water with a fork and then dipped the fork in sugar and used that to stir again, which was plenty to feed the yeast. I also used brown sugar instead of demerara sugar, which I never heard of before, but intend to look for it soon. Instead of the bread pan, I used a round Brotform basket to give it an Artisan look and baked it on a preheated pizza stone. The result was a nice looking loaf of wonderful tasting rye bread.

Just finished baking this wonderful aromatic loaf. The crust is strong and chewy, the crumb is close. The addition of pickle juice recreates the authentic loaf. Thanks!!

Made this today for the first time and it turned out beautifully! I substituted 2 Tbsp. of Vital Wheat Gluten for the potato flakes and put everything in the bread machine, setting it for the whole grain dough cycle. I then shaped the dough into a round, let it rise a second time, and baked according to the recipe. My guests said it was outstanding...far better than any commercially made rye bread they'd ever had.

My step son told me that this is the best bread that I have made, and it didn't even have the caraway seeds in it!  The pickle juice gives it a nice, tart taste.  Perfect for tuna sandwiches!

I'm not a baker or a chef but I do like to try making different things.  My bread is usually pretty good but this bread was delicious.  The texture was perfect and it seems we could taste all the ingredients in just the right proportions.  I didn't have dried potato flakes so I shredded a raw potato and microwaved it for a minute and used some of that because I couldn't find a straight up substitute.  It seems to have worked.  I will be making this bread again, probably every time we have the need or hankering for some delicious rye.
Thanks to 'Dad's World Famous' for this recipe.

Love this bread!  Made this with regular rye flour and omitted the potato flakes (reducing the water by 1/4 cup as others have advised).  It is so good and makes great sandwiches.  The dill pickle juice is a definite flavor punch.  I have also used this recipe to make Reuben bakes by rolling the proofed dough into a large rectangle, filling the middle third with 1000 Island dressing, sauerkraut, and pastrami or corned beef, then folding over the sides before baking.  It's like a deli-style calzone and all who have tried it think it is amazing!

I would use less, maybe half, caraway seed next time for our preference. Other than that it turned out really good even though I had to use a couple of tweaks. I didn't have potato flakes so left them out and then needed more flour, about 1/4 cup rye and another 1/4-1/2 cup total of bread flour and white whole wheat. I kept adding tablespoons until I ran out and then had to use a little white whole wheat to finish so I'm not sure of the exact amount. Very nice texture for sandwiches, soft but sturdy. I free formed the loaf and mine rose in about half the time for each rise. EDIT 3/24/15: I made as written but still needed a little extra flour, maybe 1/4 cup. Same great texture and one of the easiest doughs I have worked with. This has kept in a sealed bag for 5 days without staling or molding.

Fabulous recipe. Beautiful bread, it was easy to follow and turned out wonderfully. I made a few small tweaks, nothing too major. Absolutely must try this, even my non rye eating friends liked this!

This was my first time making my own rye bread.  The dough didn't react as I've grown accustomed to bread dough reacting.  It was very dense, and didn't rise much.  But it turned out very well in the end.  Dare I say this is the perfect rye bread?  The "rye" flavor is intense, and that is just the way I like it.  I made a few substitutions:  I didn't have pickle juice, so I sub'd apple cider vinegar, and didn't have potato flakes, so sub'd gluten, and didn't have oil, so sub'd butter (equal parts for all).  To make up for the lack of pickle juice, I threw in a pinch of dill seeds with the caraway.  I let my bread machine take care of the dough cycle.  I shaped it and let it rise on the counter for 1 hour, then baked at 350 for 35 minutes.  It didn't rise much more when it was on the counter (I was getting nervous at this point!), but the loaf really fluffed up in the oven.  It turned out just as I was hoping.  Just as good, if not better than the rye bread I get from my local bakery.

This is n excellent bread, but definitely not for beginners. The dough is quite sticky and I prefer to do it by hand on the counter. You will be kneading for a WHILE. But it is so worth it. I also grind half of the caraway for a truly excellent flavor. Yum.

I made this bread and it is delicious.  The recipe needs to changed to 1/2 cup water.  One cup makes the dough too stickey so I had to add more flour to get it right.

Fabulous!  I love it!  I didn't have any potato flakes, so I grated 1/4 c. of a potato and reduced the water by as much.  The crust is crunchy, but fine.  It is not hard or thick.  The inside is soft, but holds together well when sliced.  I've struggled with bread in the past, but this recipe worked out great!  The flavor is tasty tasty! :)

This is top dog! fab recipe, bread has a lovely taste and cuts well...can't wait to try it with pastrami, mayo mixed with a little mustard and a bread and butter pickle...a fab open sandwich.
great tip frpm another poster,  if you don't have potato flakes leave them out and reduce water by 1/4 cup. Thanks for that...will make again!

YAAAYYY!! I finally made a loaf of rye that is edible! Before, the dough never rose correctly, so the bread was dense. I had given up, but still had about 2 cups of rye flour left in the bag so decided to try once more. I'm so glad I did! I followed the recipe, mixed it with the bread machine and it came out light & fluffy and delicious. I stopped the machine for 1/2 hour after it mixed, then re-started it on "dough". I can't wait to make another loaf with the rest of the flour & will be buying more soon...Thanks, Dad!

This was the the recipe I used the first time I ever made rye bread and it came out fantastic. I have since tried other recipes but this is by far my favorite. It’s easy to make and delicious, it toasts and grills beautifully.

This is the best Rye Bread Recipe!  Have made it several times.  Follow the instructions exactly and it will turn out great.  I have substituted 1 cup of Multigrain flour with success as well!

The only change I made to the ingredients was to sub light brown sugar because I couldn't find Demerara sugar.  I like to weigh my flour rather than to measure by cups.  I used 240 grams of all-purpose flour and 147 grams of stone-ground rye flour.  I made this for hubs, born and raised in NYC, who has been complaining about not being able to get real New York Deli Rye Bread where we live now.  When it comes to food, he's a tough critic and he says it's a do-over!  His only complaint is that the crust isn't crispy enough, but I'll fix that next time.  I'm not a big fan of rye bread, but even I thought it was pretty darn good!  I made this in my bread machine on the Dough Cycle.  I put the machine on pause for 30 minutes after 3 minutes of mixing.  After that I let the machine finish it's knead and rise.  Then I followed the rest of the instructions to a T and baked it in the oven.

I was looking for a good rye bread recipe.  I found it.  I made this in my bread machine and it came out perfect.  AND it stayed first day fresh for one week.  Great recipe.

This is one of the nicest breads I've ever made. It's softer than I expected, but I prefer that. I swapped the potato for 2 tbsp. vital wheat gluten, and I didn't have pickles, so I used the liquid from sauerkraut. The rising/proofing/baking times are spot on. Definitely a keeper.

Absolutely  love this recipe! I  make it about every 4  days and also share with family and neighbors. Instead of using dill pickle juice, I add 2 tsp of King Arthur Deli Rye Flavor and increase the warm water by 1/4 cup. Also, I use regular sugar.
Best rye bread recipe!!

I made it in my bread machine on dough cycle then rolled it out and shaped into a loaf to rise.  The only changes I made were to brush the loaf with water before rising and then a whole egg/1 tablespoon water egg wash just before baking.  Excellent soft texture with just a hint of "tang" from the pickle juice ... and it looked gorgeous and tasted great!  Will make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

It is a great recipe. Have made several rye bread recipes and this is by far the best. I am from Texas and my grandmother and mother always made rye bread. Never could figure out why I couldn't come up with the same flavor. And for me that is the problem. It is the sour pickle juice. California has never heard of sour pickles. I have them because I order from the manufacturers or family members send me care packages. It is just not the same without sour pickle juice. Will make it again as long as I have the sour pickle juice.

EEEyow, this is so good.  It is at first, a very mild rye flavor, but the aftertaste is amazing.  And yes, I added pickle juice with a lot of skepticism, and while you can't taste it, I'm sure it is what makes this so terrific.  

Couple of minor changes.  I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of white, and then we got stuck in traffic and it sat out on the counter for about 5 hours before we got home to punch it down.  It had obviously "popped" at least once, but if it affected the flavor it was to our benefit.  The texture is fine and the bread is soft, fairly dense and wonderful. Can't hardly wait for breakfast to make toast from it.  My sister and I each ate just this for dinner, and are so very happy.  Try it.  This is such good bread.

This recipe produced a great loaf with a crunchy crust and soft interior.  The flavor is wonderful.  The dough is very sensitive.  I recommend a slow proof at room temperature (no heated proofing drawer) to avoid over-proofing.

Tried this NY Rye bread recipe and it was a real winner.  Will make again and again.  I love the really soft interior and slightly hard exterior.  It reminds me of Levy's rye bread from NY.

Really good flavor and texture.  I deviated from the directions to Try to get a round loaf to use for a bread bowl.  I will make it again but have to work on a pretty, round, loaf.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Will I make it again, absolutely. The texture and the flavor was sublime. I'm just a Goy from Colombia, but I thought this was one of the best rye bread recipes I've tried to date. After making Kosher chopped liver, I spread it over the rye bread which I cut into triangles. My Jewish partner said it was as good as my New York bagels. The only thing I added to the recipe was more flour and rye flour as I live at 7,300 ft in altitude and it requied more flour. I kept the two to one ratio: flour to rye flour until the dough stuck around the dough hook on the mixer.

I didn't make any changes. I will definitely make this again.  I let it rise in the pan too long :( So, I want to see if that made a difference in the way it came out.  I will also try cooking it in a round cast iron pot.

If you like supermarket bakery rye bread, this is spot on, but it's nothing close to what you'd get in a Jewish deli or bakery. The crumb is soft and spongy (think wonder bread), as is the crust.  Real Jewish rye, has a nice chew, a great firm texture and a crust that actually resembles a crust.  A real rye also has a much longer raise time to develop flavors - this recipe simply isn't anything close to Jewish (or New York or German) rye.

This bread is great. I didn’t have pickle juice so used Apple Cider Vinegar. My Rye Flour didn’t specify dark or light, but it worked. This is a keeper. I’m curious how the taste will change with pickle juice.

I made this Real NY Jewish Rye in my bread machine on the Basic setting, Large size and dark crust.  The taste is perfect and it cuts smooth and evenly.  I did replace about an ounce of liquid with molasses which gave it a darker color and added a bit of sweetness.  The taste and consistency of the bread make this a 'keeper' recipe.

Wow, I actually made rye bread!  This bread tastes great! 
 I was so excited to try it, I just put some butter on it and ate it just like that.  Recipe was so easy to follow.  I love the detailed instructions.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!

I didn't have potato flakes on hand, I boiled a potato and mashed it. I decreased the water by 1/4 cup and used 1/4 cup of the mashed potatoes.  The end result was awesome.

It was very good! I didn't have potato flakes, so left that out and reduced the liquid some. Used regular sugar since I dind't want to buy demerrara sugar. I would reduce the caraway seeds. Otherwise, it turned out perfectly.

The bread is amazing the flavour & texture are great. I changed the baking instructions. When the dough is finished I turn it out on a floured surface and shape it into a long log. I let it rise for about an hour. I heat a baking stone to 450  I put an empty pan in the bottom of the oven. When it finishes rising I mix 1/4 cup water & 1/4 tsp cornstarch and microwave it for 45 seconds  I brush this on the bread and sprinkle with everything but the bagel spice. I bake it for about 20-25 minutes on the baking stone on parchment paper.Before closing the oven I put a cup of hot water in the baking pan and quickly close the door. This gives a crusty finish to the bread

My son made this recipe several times for practice and then submitted it as his 4-H Foods project.  He won the Grand Champion award!  He used the recipe as written.  He used a banneton proofing basket.  He watched some you-tube videos for help on how to shape the loaf.  And took the advice of one video to use an egg white and milk wash on the top to help with an even lovely color.  And he baked the bread on parchment paper.

This bread was incredibly easy. I used white sugar for this becauit isn’t cost effective for me to purchase the other sugar. I also didn’t add the caraway seeds because my husband doesn’t like them.  It turned out beautifully and it definitely will be a regular recipe I use.

This bread is awesome! I have made plenty of Jewish rye from any number of recipes but... This.Is.Best.Ever. Reminds of the bread we got from my favorite childhood Chicago Jewish deli. With some soft butter, I could eat half a loaf with nothing else, all by myself as soon as it’s cool enough to slice. Thank you so much for posting this recipe.

I made this twice ... the first time was the best! Second time, it was okay ... I am wondering if using sprouted rye flour instead of regular file flour had something to do with it. I did change the methodology a bit ... I like to use the slow, overnight rise method and therefore use less yeast. I’m going to get some regular rye flour and try it again. All my neighborhood taste testers liked the first version best.

I didn’t have potato flakes. I replaced cucumber brine with mozzarella brine ( whey) and used 1/4 cup of black strap molasses instead of sugar. This bread is very tasty. I will definitely bake again

I made this today, used white sugar, dill pickle juice and omitted caraway, simply because that’s what I had or didn’t have.  It’s the best rye bread I’ve ever made.  Yay!!!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

I'm originally from NY/NJ and after moving out West I really miss good old-fashioned Jewish rye bread.  I've made this three times now and it's really an excellent recipe.  If you want the oblong rye bread (I do), just form it into a loaf and bake without a  loaf pan. If you want the chewy shiny crust (I do), use an egg wash.      I didn't make any changes except for adding some vital wheat gluten which I always add to my bread recipes. You don't have to use potato flakes if you do that.  BTW, this recipe works beautifully in a bread machine.  I have a Cuisinart bread machine and I set it for a medium loaf with a dark crust on the white bread settings.

This recipe was OUTSTANDING! I made as described, except for subbing brown sugar for the demerara - but followed the rising and baking directions exactly. I also ground half of the caraway seeds. It has a thin crunchy crust, and a lovely soft interior. The loaf slices beautifully when cool - I will never buy store rye again!

Followed the recipe exactly as was published on this website.  First off bread was way too salty.   Recommend using only  1/2 teaspoon of salt.  Doubt if not using sea salt would make a difference.

The texture of the bread was a little doughy as if it wasn't backed enough.  The internal temperature was over 200F.  It was baked for 35 minutes at 350 degrees. The oven was  preheated for 10 minutes.  

While the bread's taste was ok it is no where near the NY Jewish Rye I have had.  Not even close!

I use sauerkraut juice instead of sour pickle juice.  I don't believe it has much impact on the bread's flavor.  Will leave it out next time. 

I can't imagine the bakers of Jewish Rye use pickle juice or the special sugar used in this recipe.

Made it with no potato flakes and I reduced the water accordingly. I also couldn't find "sour" pickles, so I used kosher dill pickle juice instead. Turned out absolutely amazing with that classic rye taste. Would definitely recommend this recipe.

This is fantastic bread. I don’t have stand mixer but used my food processor and let the dough rise in refrigerator overnight. I also made some substitutions based on previous suggestions. I used wheat gluten in place of the potato flakes and barley malt in place of the sugar. I also made a round free form loaf brushed with egg yolk and baked on oven stone. It was beautiful and delicious!

I doubled the caraway seeds...the flavor was good and the crust was crisp. The texture was NOT as good as what I have come to expect from rye bread. 

Next time, I will try activating the yeast  in the warm water with the sugar BEFORE adding to the mixture.

I will make it a third time. My first loaf rose beautifully, but my second didn't rise at all in the oven. I put raisins in for me because my husband never eats the bread I make so why not, and the raisins may be why it didnt rise in the oven.

A comment regarding the first paragraph, I have been eating my bread for several days now,and even though the loaf is not as high it's just as good as the first. The raisins gave the best of both worlds as my two favorite breads are raisin bread and rye bread. I also put in a scant teasp. of citric acid instead of pickle juice.

Turned out fantastic.  Due to lack of correct ingredients,  I sub'd brown sugar, grapeseed oil, and white rye flour.  Also mixed in one part sprouted wheat flour.  Fed it to my local rye bread experts and they love it. Thanks!

I've never been to New York City to try any of their rye bread. But this recipe is awesome! Dense, chewy, crispy crust, and the flavor is out of this world! I think it's the pickle juice that does it. Makes great toast too. Also I made it by hand instead of using a mixer. Thanks.

I don't have a mixer with a bread hook so I need to increase kneading time and I had to increase bake time.
I'm tempted to increase the rye to 1 1/2 cups and flour down to 1 1/2 cups.

Great rye bread recipe to add to your files! I was skeptical about not dissolving the yeast 1st but this bread rises better than any other recipe I've used. Yes, I admit I made a couple slight changes: I used juice from my refrigerator pickles I maintain ( heavy on the garlic and dill!) and cut out the sugar. And it's also the 1st time I've used a mixer in bread making but I wanted to follow this recipe as close as possible.  Can you double this recipe? I'm going to find out!

This was exactly what I have been looking for!  I made it in my bread machine.  I was skeptical about the pickle juice, but I'm pretty sure this is the secret ingredient that makes the bread perfect.

Made this exactly to directions with the exception of demerara sugar (used plain old white sugar) and it was fantastic!  Made it once in the loaf pans and another time formed into a loaf on a stone.  The loaf pan version was a bit softer and the stone baked loaf a bit crisper, so it would depend on what it was being served with which I would choose to do next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a fabulous, easy, and foolproof recipe. Our altitude  is 5000 ft, so rising time is a bit shorter and I add 1 T gluten for every 2 cups of flour.  Instead of one large loaf I divide the dough in half and make two baguettes, in a baguette pan on top of a stone, bake at 375 convection for 30 min.  This is not a heavy, dense European style rye...it has a much softer crumb with a delightful taste.  I do grind the caraway seeds a bit.

Perfect, soft wonderful rye bread. Great for sandwiches. I made it as written, but subbed 2 T of potato starch for the flakes, because that's what I had, and used the dough cycle on my bread machine for kneading and the first rise. I will definitely make this again, but will probably cut the yeast down to 1.5 t because I live at 7200 ft. and the loaf rose really fast and blew up like a balloon in the oven, then sunk a bit at one end. The yeast is probably fine as written at lower altitudes though.

Hi.. didn't make any changes...  the rye bread was not a dense as you would normally find.  I worked in a Jewish Deli for years.. and that rye bread was definitely different in texture.  This recipe was leaning toward a white bread consistency....

Very easy instructions to follow and turned out as it was supposed to. My husband loves rye bread and he couldn’t stop complimenting me on how well the bread turned out.

I generally weigh my flour instead of measuring to avoid using too much flour.  I think maybe this recipe was designed for the flour to be scooped and kind of compacted because it was an extremely sticky dough. Since I've never made rye bread I thought this was how it was supposed to be.  It ended up sticking horribly to the pan and is my first bread failure. The taste was really good though and I can't wait to try it again, only with more flour next time.  If you are having a hard time finding demerara sugar or dark rye, try the bulk area if your store has one.  I was able to find those, the caraway seeds (super cheap) and the potato flakes (which was nice because I don't normally use them and was able to get a small amount).

I used 30% of the flour after I mixed the two flours to make a poolish, which I let ferment for about sixteen hours. I used the dough cycle on my breadmaker o knead and raise, and I made three mini-loaves. They came out perfect! Moist, springy, and very flavorful.

Instead of 1/4 cup of pickle juice, I used white vinegar, all purpose flour instead of bread flour, and instead of regular potato flakes I used latke mix. The bread still came out really delicious. Makes good sandwich bread.

First time making rye bread and it was pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly (except I ground the caraway seeds).  The recipe is easy and straightforward. I was really hesitant to add the pickle vinegar, but it is a delicious bread and it would have tasted flat without it.

Very tasty.  I made this to go with the "Solianka or Russian Beef Soup" also on this site.  They both contained dill pickle juice and went well together.  It later also made a good sandwich with Chef John's "Grilled Flank Steak 'Pastrami'".

I could not find Demarra sugar, so I used turbinado sugar (a close cousin),  and I used  pickle juice I had on-hand. Delicious bread! Will definitely make again today.

I made this bread 6 times now, the only ingredient I adjusted was the amount of salt to account for the salty pickle juice in the brand of pickles I bought.  This bread is amazing, this is the first review I have ever written in my life, its that good.

A basic recipe that's easy to assemble.  Just put everything in the bowl, mix, and let rise.   The taste and texture is authentic and your kitchen will smell like a NY deli for a while.  And that's a good thing!

Still leaning how to make bread, This turned out great. I did not have any sour Pickle juice so used sauerkraut juice instead. Only thing I will change next time is perhaps add some less salt and juice and add some caramelized onions in the batter.

I have to admit I didn't do the recipe exactly as written.  I didn't have potato flakes, I didn't have demerara sugar and I don't like caraway seeds.  I did not use potato flakes or caraway seeds.  I used white sugar rather than the demurera sugar, but I have to tell you this is the best rye bread I have ever made or tasted!  It's moist, not heavy.  It doesn't dry out the second day or third.  I would highly recommend this recipe to everyone.  It's my new favorite.  I would also say, my dough was very moist and rather sticky, but I did not add extra flour and I am so glad I didn't.  I also did the warm water, salt, sugar and yeast together first and then added the dry ingredients.  
GREAT!

Absolutely the greatest rye bread recipe ever!!! Followed directions exactly, just be sure you don't let the bread over-rise, The second rise was shorter than stated in the directions. Let rise till just over top of pan by 1/2" . Moist, savory and simply an all time keeper recipe. (I can my own pickles and like them very spicy so this really came out great).

I used a 1/4 cup of sour dough started instead of the pickle juice. I also cooked it in a cake tube pan which worked wonderfully.

Thank you for the recipe.  Made this today, and the loaf is almost gone.  Folowed recipe with 2 exceptions, used regular yeast as I did not have quick rise, and omitted potatoes flakes.  Very good, nice crumb when cutting.

I did add 1/2 cup sourdough starter otherwise just as recipe written. It was great and have made it twice since as gifts. It was ideal as a sandwich light rye bread. Got a great rise and wonderful flavor. Plan to make corn beef and this bread for Superbowl weekend
So easy and delish kneaded in Kitchenaid mixer. Highly recommend this bread.

I hesitated to make this after reading several reviews where folks had difficulty with the dough rising.  However, I made it with no changes and it came out beautifully.  What a treat! Thanks for the incredible recipe.

Delicious! I used baked potato instead of potato flakes and subtracted 1/4 c water to compensate. I also made the dough in a bread maker, baking it in the loaf pan as directed.

Great recipe!
I made this as posted and it turned out great!
I like Jewish Rye bread for my Reuben sandwiches and this fills the bill perfectly.
I will make this again.

This was my first time making a bread from scratch.  The recipe was so easy to follow and the bread came out perfectly.  I did place a foil tent over the bread for the last 15 minutes of baking.  It was absolutely delicious and my family loved it.

This is delicious! I did do my yeast , water and sugar and let them set for 5 minutes different from receipt and added gluten but pretty much kept to the original receipt. I will be definitely making this again!

If there was 6 stars I would give it.  My bread is awesome.  Everyone who tasted it loved it.  The secret ingredient made the difference.  I am going to make it again in a few days.  Today I am going to make the San Francisco sour bread.  I used Claussen Pickle juice.  If you like rye bread you will love this one!

This is my first loaf of rye and I'm a novice bread baker. Taste is excellent, nice crumb, crunchy but soft crust. Indeed better than any you can buy. I did add 1 tsp of diastatic malt powder, 1/2c high fiber flour blend (both from King Arthur flour) in place of 1/2c bread flour and I also added 1 tsp mustard powder. 

It did rise but not as much as I hoped. Still great sliced for sandwiches. Right now I'm enjoying it with pastrami! :-)

This was the first loaf of bread I have made in my life.  I am an American living in Amsterdam and I so miss NY Jewish Rye.  I followed the recipe almost exact (my timings were a bit different) since it was my first loaf.  It is delicious!  My most honest critic is my husband.  He came home, took one bite and said "EXCELLENT!" Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This was quite good. I used white vinegar rather than pickle juice.

I am a novice regarding breads but I tried it and I came out pretty good except-----it crumbles, really easily.  Does the length of time it takes to rise effect the way the bread holds together? when I put it aside to rise I turn on the under cabinet lights to help it along and it actually rises fairly quickly.  So while it tastes really good it falls apart.  Any help anyone could give me would be great.  Thanks so much.

This worked very well in my bread machine! As I could not find potato flakes, I left them out. Very nice!

I followed another reviewer and omitted the potato flakes and reduced the water by 1/4 c.  Used pickle juice from Vlasic Reduced Sodium Stackers but next time I'll try Zesty Dills.  Used brown sugar.  This turned out perfectly.  The dough was just wonderful to work with.  I baked it in 2 half-loaves for just the two of us, freezing one.  Baked them for 25 minutes.

I made two 4 loaf batches.  I used sauerkraut juice instead of pickle juice for the first batch and the bread had the perfect consistency before the second rist.  I use the pickle juice the second time an the dough remained sticky, but baked into 4 pretty good looking loaves.  I'm wondering if the other ingredients in the pickle juice could have made the difference in the consistency of the dough.  Any comments would be great.
