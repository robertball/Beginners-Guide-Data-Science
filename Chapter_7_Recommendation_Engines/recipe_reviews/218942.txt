This is delicious!  This recipe makes a lot, so we are planning to take it for lunch for the next few days... taking the spinach/basil combo in a separate box from the rice and putting it together at lunch.  I made this with tempeh instead of chicken, but I think tofu would be great too.  I used brown basmati rice and Thai basil. The peanut sauce is marvelous. This would be even better if topped with shredded carrots and chopped peanuts. My only problem with this recipe is the order that the ingredients are listed - it would be better if they were listed in order of use. Thanks, Uncle Ben!

I made this with quinoa instead of rice.  My husband (who is normally pretty picky) took one bite and said "This is really good!".  And it was.  So delicious and refreshing!  Next time I will use thai basil.

Serving this for dinner tonight. I just finished putting it all together and had to check it for "quality assurance". It is a wonderful combination of flavors. Very refreshing & would make a great salad during warm weather. When I serve it I will garnish with finely shredded carrot and chopped peanuts.

I removed the chicken and replaced it with grilled salmon (marinated 30 min w/ 1 part soy sauce and 1 part maple syrup) and added avocado.  Awesome!! Our dinner guests raved and asked for the recipe.

This is really good.  I did add an extra 1/4 cup or so of peanut butter because the rice vinegar overpowered the other flavors and I was craving a peanut-flavored sauce.  A little extra peanut butter and the "peanutty" flavor came right through.

Boyfriend really liked this, I really didn't, I thought the dressing was WAY too overpowering.

This was delicious.  I cooked the chicken ahead of time in the crock pot so it was shredded.  It made a huge amount!

As I made it, it wasn't as pretty as the picture and the smell of the rice vinegar had me a little worried.  But then we tried it and it was AMAZING!  Great recipe, highly recommended!

I absolutely love this recipe!!  I am always looking for tasty, healthy, and easy lunches to bring to work.  This is my new favorite option!  I used chick peas instead of chicken since it was a little quicker.  I also recommend using Bangkok peanut sauce instead of regular peanut butter if you like a little kick.

I made this for a camping trip. I used canned salmon rather than chicken. I wasn't impressed with the recipe. I think it's average. I like Thai flavors and I like grain salads. But this was dry and seemed bland. It seemed like a clump when serving it from the bowl. I'm not sure how it could be fixed.

I was really looking forward to this recipe because I love Thai food and it received such good reviews.  I made the sauce twice and it just didn't taste right.  The first time I added 1/3 cup soy sauce as recipe calls for and it was terrible. I added more peanut butter, some chili sauce but I just couldn't eat it.  I threw away the first batch and made another with no soy sauce, thinking I would add it slowly, but maybe it's the rice vinegar because batch two was pretty bad, although not as bad as the first.  I gave up on the sauce, added more veggies to the rice and chicken, tossed with a light vinaigrette I made and at least managed to salvage dinner.

Very good flavor.  I cut the recipe in half and it was perfect for two people.
