Scale back on the sugar, and it's spectacular! Next time I'll start with 1/2 cup and add more to taste. You get sweetness from the orange juice as well as the pear, so a full cup isn't really necessary. I had to add an additional cup of cranberries to balance it out.

3/4 cup of sugar is more than enough. Made fresh garam masala using the recipe "Easy garam masala" (here on Allrepcipe). It was soooo yummie, mingling the aromas of the freshly ground spices! The biggest difficulty is not to eat it all at once.

Very tasty.  I used several slices of fresh ginger since that's what I had, and I only had half a cup of orange juice so added more water to make up for the difference.

I roughly followed this recipe, and it was amazing. I've never been particularly fond of the tartness of cranberries so I used an equal amount of pears instead of just one, and anise and the spice blend were a little out of hand for me, so I just substituted other spice blends (nutmeg, allspice) to taste. It turned out a dark dark red but so sweet and delicious. We ate in on toast for months, and it kept fine.

This cranberry dish is so so delicious. I made it for Thanksgiving and then for Christmas. And then as a spread for bread or ANYTHING! Next I am going to make it and can it!

This sauce is delicious!  I can see where some people are suggesting cutting down on the amount of sugar - it is sweet, but I rather like it that way since it has the additional ginger and spice flavor.  I love the combination of pears and cranberries.  I had to sub fresh ginger for candied, and since I forgot to pick up star anise I subbed about a 1/4 tsp. of Chinese 5-Spice powder, which is heavy on the anise flavor.  Worked out great!  Use a decent garam masala - some of those bottled grocery store ones are awful.  The Easy Garam Masala recipe from this site is good in a pinch.

Nice sauce.  Worked well with both turkey and ham.  sweet and tart to complement and enhance the savory taste of the meat.

This is delicious!!  I made this for Christmas Dinner and was simply a wonderful accompaniment to the turkey.  It is also delicious in a Turkey and Brie sandwich.  Doubled the quantity and just used 1 cup of sugar and more crystallized ginger.

This is the best cranberry sauce I have ever had!  I will be making it for the fourth time next week as everyone has requested it.  I don't think I have ever received as many compliments regarding a side or sauce as I have with this recipe.  Once again Chef John, you ROCK!  If you ever do a cookbook, PLEASE let us know.

I am German, living since 12 years in Canada and this is the first Cranberry Sauce 'be I've ever made. When  saw this recipe - I immediately loved it and then I was overwhelmed from this tasty sauce. My Canadian friends asked for the recipe, which made me very proud.

Through the years, I've made fresh cranberry relish various different ways.  This was my family's favorite so far and I think it will be a staple for our holidays.  I did make some changes as follows:  I used raw sugar; cinnamon powder rather than the stick (that's all I had on hand); eliminated the anise, as I didn't have any; and added about a tablespoon of ginger paste, instead of the crystallized ginger, since I already had that in the fridge.  It came out delish !

i love Chef John!  of course, as he would want, i never follow the recipe exactly, choosing to go creative.
the star anise and the grand Marsala spic e was a nice touch, adding some unique after-notes.   i have never used these spices before!
i added a granny smith green apple, a jalapeno, some celery and red onion .oh la la!  
the sugar level was fine, since i added all the other ingredients.
mmmmm.  love the smell that is permeating the house!

I tired this recipe exactly how it's written.  I even watched the video.  Something just didn't taste right about.....maybe the garam masala.
