This is a really good recipe.  I liked the "kick" that the dressing has due to all the spices and chili powder.  I used dried blackeyed peas instead of canned (LOVE my Instant Pot!!) and doubled the dressing because I like mine a  little wetter.  Other than that I didn't change a thing.   This one's a keeper!!

I have made this a couple of times and it's a huge hit!! I can't make enough of it and I even get requests " can you make your salsa for the party" so easy to make too!!
