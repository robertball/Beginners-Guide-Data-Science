Ok everyone, I hope your ready for a few variations on this bad boy of a pumpkin seed recipe.  So on the whiskey I used jd like it suggested.  On the bacon drippings I used maple bacon drippings and omg it was a nice twist.  For the brown sugar I did use light brown sugar just like one of the other reviews but I uped it even more and went with 1 & 1/2 tablespoons. And finally on the salt I went 1 tablespoon sea salt and 1 tablespoon garlic salt and bing bang boom there it is MMMMMMMM GOOD!

I was very hesitant to try these as #1, I don't like whiskey, #2, I didn't really want to waste a half cup of whiskey and #3, I didn't want to ruin my first batch of pumpkin seeds.  The ingredients sounded intriguing so I tried them and was truly amazed how delicious they are.  I didn't have dark brown sugar, and didn't want to try to adlib since the recipe only called for 1 Tablespoon, so I just added maybe 2 teaspoons more light brown sugar but otherwise followed the recipe.  I think using dark brown sugar would make them taste better/different but overall, I am very pleased with them especially since I can't really taste the whiskey.

I LOVE roasted pumpkin seeds and this year I decided to try this recipe because it sounded interesting. This was so good I might buy another pumpkin just to make these seeds again. I added the homemade bacon bits and they get a delicious caramelized glaze on them. Yum! I am obsessed!

Wow!!! I used Dewars Honey Whiskey because it was all I had and also because I thought it may give a good sweetness. I can't stop eating them and they aren't even done in the oven yet. I may have simmered mine too hard because I had nothing to drain... the whiskey, had already reduced to a glaze when they were ready to go in the oven, but I would do it the same way again. This glaze is AMAZING. I did also use cayenne as other reviewers have noted. I am so glad we bought HUGE pumpkins and I have tupperwares full of fresh seeds because I will be making many batches of these in the coming weeks.

One do the best roasted pumpkin seed recipes I've found.  Being from KY, we love our bourbon.  I made for a Thanksgiving Day snack, but I doubt they'll last that long!

BEST PUMPKIN SEEDS EVER! They were so good I had to make more! I did follow the "cook's notes" and added cayenne pepper and also drizzled the remaining sauce on the seeds! I am defiantly going to use this recipe again!

This was FABULOUS!  We didn't have a blended whiskey on hand, but we did have some single- malt scotch ... whiskey. While I'm sure it is better with a blended whiskey, we certainly loved it. I added lots of cayenne, as we like spicy food, and they disappeared in no time.

My husband just said " WOW these are the best pumpkin seeds I've ever had!!" I agree!! I used hulless seeds from our kakai pumpkins which turned out better than the usual seeds I used last year. I used light brown sugar 1 1/2 T and 1 tsp garlic salt 1 tsp kosher salt. Cooking time using the hulless seeds was 40 minutes and they were perfectly crunchy! Yum

I made a batch and followed the recipe. While it was well received, it didn’t have a bourbon flavor. I made a second batch but placed all ingredients (used Maple Bacon-a must) in a ziplock bag and marinated for 24 hours. Wow! Intense flavor!

Oh my gosh! This was perfect exactly how it was written! I made a batch and it was demolished as soon as they came out of the oven. The ONLY thing I did was cook the glaze a little longer to make it more like a syrup and holy poo it was amazing this is goin down in my book as epic.

I had no brown sugar, but I had that Evan Williams Apple Cider Bourbon.  So I followed the recipe just using that and omitting the brown sugar.  I took the added step of reducing the liquid into a syrup.  About 1/3 of the way through the baking process, I drizzled the syrup over the seeds, dusted them lightly with cayenne pepper and then mixed them up with a spoon while they were still on the baking sheet.  Back in the oven and WOW!  My kids gobbled them up, and the wife who was highly skeptical, could not keep from grabbing handfuls.

Yum. My friends didn't get to try these...they never escaped my house! I was hesitant that the booze would overpower the seed flavor, but instead it added a wonderful smokey-savory highlight. Because of the brown sugar,  I lined the baking sheet with parchment paper to make cleanup a snap.

I just finished making this and went off of some of the reviews adding a pinch of garlic salt I also decided to go ahead and cook the seeds with the bacon but removed it after all seeds had turned the grey color. Overall these seeds are alright not bad next time I would add more whiskey and maybe even let the seeds sit in it for a good 10 minutes before cooking.

I had seeds from a butternut squash, so I decided to try these because I'm not quite ready to chop up my pumpkins yet.  I added a splash of liquid smoke, and salted them with Tony Chachere's More spice when I popped them in the oven.  I will have to hide these from myself so my DH can try them, and I cannot wait to cut open my pumpkins!!!!  YUMMO!

I used Seagram's 7 as my  whiskey, not expecting much. I wasn't disappointed, there was no whiskey flavor. For my taste I'd cut the bacon grease in half, reduce the salt, and use a more flavorful whiskey.

This year I added to the recipe to make them spicier & have a deeper flavor. I also changed the way I used the 'glaze'. 

1.) Added 4 large cloves of garlic to seeds while they were cooking on the stove top. (i love garlic so I also roasted them in the oven with the seeds so I can eat them like candy) 

2.) Also added 1/2 teaspoon each; cayenne, hot paprika, Chipotle powder to liquid mixture. 

 Instead of drizzling the glaze 3/4 of the way through the roasting, I put the seeds back in the potty  with liquid & mix so they are completely coated. Then they go back on the sheet pan to finish roasting.  Yuuuummmmm!
