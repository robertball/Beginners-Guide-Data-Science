It takes some practice to achieve a round tortilla. The second time I made this I decreased the salt and lost the amazing flavor. I rolled seasoning into the dough after I realized my mistake and really liked the result. This is a great option for my limited diet (no soy etc)!

I made this recipe using coconut oil (that is all I had). I followed the measurements exactly, I cut the recipe in half (just for me), I was able to make 8 tortillas, a few the size of fajitas and the rest a little larger than that. 
I can taste the difference between these and store bought. Fresh tastes way better, the outcome is awesome, I rolled as thin as I could and still got a thicker tortilla, was very satisfying. Saved me money, and took the same amount of time as if I would have gone to the store to buy. I like that I can make a half batch and not have so many leftovers. This was my first time making tortillas, overall it was a success.
