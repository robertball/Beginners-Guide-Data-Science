Yummy! I made this for a party at work, and received many compliments on it, along with requests for the recipe. The night before I made as directed, but didn’t bake it. I refrigerated it, then microwaved it just before the party. Worked great.  In the future I will probably add some garlic powder or sautéed minced garlic.

I think this might be better than spinach/artichoke (because of all the free spaghetti squash in my garden).  But, I did tweak the recipe -- added two cloves of garlic, & I used cheddar jack cheese (what I had on hand).  Also, be sure to use fresh shredded parmesan -- not the powdery pre-grated stuff -- that's ok on spaghetti, but in a recipe, for really good flavor (and texture), you need to use the fresh stuff.

I made it as written; it was cheesey and good but missing something.  I put the leftovers in a small dip crock pot and added green onions, ground black pepper and worcestershire.  Better.  I think this is way worth making for such a creative use of spaghetti squash, just needs a little tweaking.  I will make this again and keep experimenting... :)

I made this for a party, one with fancy girly drinks, and the dip was what they talked about. One of my friends said she was thinking about it the other day, six months later, and wishing she knew how to make it. You won't mistake it for spinach-artichoke dip, but it is delicious in its own right!

Amazing. Got rave reviews from even my five year old!! I added a sprinkle of garlic powder to this and didn't have monterey jack cheese, so I used cheddar. It was phenomenal! Also, I microwaved the mixed ingredients because I wanted it done quickly. This was SO much like artichoke dip! Thanks for the unique recipe!

We loved this dip!  My niece thought it tasted like the creamy part of spinach and artichoke dip, I thought it was better!  I followed the recipe with just 2 additions - I added 3 ounces of cream cheese when I added the butter, and I added some garlic salt for extra flavor.  Yum!  Next time I might add a can of crab.  Thanks for sharing!

Had everyone guessing on this one.  I added a fair amount of parm on top and it baked wonderfully. Even if you're not a squash fan, this is a good one.

This was tasty and cheese-y, but unless I happen to have spaghetti squash that needs using, I will return to the spinach-artichoke dip.  and if I do make this again, I think I will puree it before baking.  My guests didn't seem to mind, but the squash strands seemed a little messy to manage for me!

My roommate is addicted to this recipe. I have to puree it for her, though. Made as is, it's perfect. I tried the taco seasoning version, and it wasn't as well received.

This was a huge hit.  I made it for a party and did not tell anyone what was in it.  They devoured it.  Super easy!  I did use asiago cheese, because that what I had but awesome.

I thought this was awesome.  I added some garlic powder, as other reviewers suggested.  It was just as good as the spinach/artichoke variety.

This is a great change from having spinach dip all the time. Used ranch & cream cheese instead of mayo. Plus for a kick I add chili peppers & garlic. I agree with the fresh Parmesan (better flavor)
If you need a new appy for a party, this one will be a hit!!

This was okay, but I was really hoping for something with a little more flavor. I agree with other posters that it needs some extra seasoning. If I make it again I will definitely try the taco seasoning packet or maybe another type of seasoning packet (like Italian dressing) to give it a more rounded flavor.

I tried this when I had leftover spaghetti squash.  I didn't have Montery Jack but had some Pepper Jack and used that instead.  This was delicious and even my picky 9 yr old loved it.  A definite keeper!

I added 2 cloves of garlic and just that little bit of flavor made a huge difference!  Delicious-- and my husband, who hates squash, couldn't get enough!

awesome with a bit of garlic! I also used calorie-wise miracle whip instead of mayo, and it gave it a bit of a tang. will definitely make again!

I went the taco seasoning and mexican cheese blend route. I also microwaved the dip instead of baking. For some reason, my cheese didn't melt all the way so it was a bit stringy. 

As far as cheese dips go, it was ok. Not stellar, but not terrible.

The dip was ok, but rather bland.  We added some taco seasoning and some garlic powder to spice it up a bit and it was better.  I definitely prefer the spinach-artichoke dip.

I WAS VERY PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THIS RECIPE BUT I GREW LOTS OF SPAGHETTI SQUASH ON ACCIDENT SO I WAS LOOKING FOR UNUSUAL FOODS TO MAKE WITH IT.  THE VERY FIRST BITE I TRIED WITH A RUFFLES RIDGED POTATO CHIP I DID NOT LIKE AT FIRST.  THE FLAVOR TAKES A MOMENT TO GET USED TO.  I SERVED IT AT A FAMILY FUNCTION OF 15 PEOPLE AND IT WAS THE MOST POPULAR FOOD OF THE NIGHT. IT WAS SOOOO POPULAR THERE WERE PEOPLE GETTING UP IN THE MIIDLE OF THE NIGHT TO HAVE MORE!!!  I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT ON A BAGUETTE ALSO. WONDERFUL WAY TO USE YOUR SPAGHETTI SQUASH

Mild and boring as directed. I then added sauteed onion and garlic, parsley for some color- still boring. Added a gigantic squirt of yellow mustard, which did add more flavor interest.
I like strong, bold flavors. This wasn't either when prepared as directed. I will not bother to save this recipe.

Added garlic salt as many mentioned and felt it still needed something so I added raisins which gave it a great flavor and a sweet aftertaste. I also scooped it into a bread bowl after heating and it was enjoyed by all.

Everyone loved it!  I added about a tsp of garlic powder and a little salt to add some extra flavor.  The 2nd time I made it I used a bag of cheddar/swiss cheese but I liked the Montery Jack better.

I was given a spaghetti squash from my neighbor so I jumped online to find a recipe to make good use of it. Sorry but I wont be making this again. For me, it was really "squashy" tasting and too heavy/stringy/chunky to be called a dip. It also made a ton, so I froze some, and will try to use the other leftovers by pureeing and combining into a twice baked potato so all that cheese wont go to waste. Although Ive used recipes with other squashes before, this is the first spaghetti squash Ive used, perhaps I just dont like this type, through no fault of the recipe itself. Thanks for posting it anyway!

So easy to make and delicious.  This is the only way my hubby will eat spaghetti squash.

Tried this, not very good.  Definatley not better than an artichoke dip with the same ingredients, skip it.  Might be good with a different type of squash?  Acorn squash, maybe sweeten it up?

I wasn't sure what to expect- I love spaghetti squash, but not everyone does.  I used Pepper Jack, because I had some on hand, and baked/served inside the squash half with tortilla chips and bread.  Big hit for a fall gathering!

I made this for a party. Everyone liked it but I thought it could be better. When I reheated the leftovers the next day, I added some bacon. Holy cow! That made it so good. I will make it again but definitely add the bacon.

I just had this dip the other day and all I can say is "It's Addicting!"  So easy and it is perfect to share around.  Did not find anyone who did not enjoy it.
