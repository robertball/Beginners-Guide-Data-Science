Delish on fish tacos.  Added 1/2 tsp chipotle since love spice and a pinch of salt.

made this last night for an orange themed pot luck dinner, and it was a hit!  i didn't have a red onion in the house, so i used half a white one when they asked for only a quarter because i wanted it to be salsa-y.  i also substituted a drizzle of agave nectar instead of sugar.  so so delicious with fresh picked peaches from the backyard!

We thought this was really good. I added a sprinkle of salt to really bring out the flavors. I think next time I will add some minced jalape√±o to give it a bit of a kick, since we like things spicy. I also used only half the stated amount of sugar. I served this with some chicken. Thankfully I had made this salsa because the recipe I picked for the chicken was SUPER bland, so this salsa really saved the day!  This would also be excellent on a white fish such as cod or sea bass and would make a great accompaniment to seared tuna.

I followed the recipe almost exactly the first time I made it--I forgot to add the sugar and increased the cilantro just a bit--it was AWESOME! Grilled some chicken with a bit of teriyaki sauce in a bed of white rice and added our cilantro right on top........dreamy delicious!!

The only problem with instructions like "1 lime, juiced" or "1/4 red onion" is that the size of these things vary. I think I had too much of both of those things because there was no way to measure. I would much rather it say "1Tbs lime juice" and let me figure out how that relates to my limes. I also decreased the sugar by half (and did not miss the other half), added salt, and a pinch of Cayenne. In spite of all this, I will use the recipe (doctored) again.

Although I only added a scant tsp finely minced red onion, once this set for a while in frig, it totaled overwhelmed the peaches and overpowered the dish. It tasted and smelled of nothing but onions Would not make again as none of my family ate it.

I made this salsa for a turkey lion on the grill. I added chopped red bell pepper, salt, pepper and a little hot peppers. Will make this again. A nice addition to any poultry and white flakey fish.

This is quite a tasty recipe! I added a jalopeno and it gave it just the right kick.
