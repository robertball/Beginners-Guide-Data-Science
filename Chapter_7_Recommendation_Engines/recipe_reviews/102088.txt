I only marinated this for about 3 1/2 hours and the flavor was very over powering. It was spicy but not very flavorful. If I made this again I would maybe add some soy sauce to balance out the spicy flavor.

This marinade was great. I put it and the steak in a plastic bag instead of on a plate to ensure the whole surface of the steak was covered, rotating the bag over the course of 8hrs. My husband LOVED the flavor.

I halved the amount of cayenne pepper, and it was still a bit too spicy for my wimpy taste buds. The flavor, however, was fantastic - I marinated the steak for about 10 hours, and it was perfect. This would work great with chicken too, maybe as a kabob marinade. Thanks!

Very spicy. VERY spicy and I halved the cayenne. I also added in cilantro to try to get more flavor and it just wasn't very flavorful. Just very spicy. I marinated for the full 8 hours too.

Pretty good.  Mine too was a touch hot too for the liking and not in a complex way.  First time to use London Broil though so perhaps I just need to learn this meat better.  I would suggest maybe cutting back on the cayenne - as others have - and maybe adding a touch of lime or maybe orange to the marinade.

This recipe has potential but needs to have more than just cayenne and garlic for seasonings. I'll play around w/ the recipe tweaking it to my taste.

Made it for dinner tonight,though, I chose to halve the cayenne and also went the broiler pan route, 10 minutes on each side for a total of 20. Family loved it regardless.

Too much tequila in this, acohol didn't burn off well and had too strong a taste in the cooked meat.

Added lime juice and used chili paste instead of cayenne. Also seasoned with garlic salt and fresh ground pepper before cooking

I broiled this instead of grill and used New York strips. I think you could add some things to make it more like a jerk style which would add more flavor.

The steak really had no flavor except heat and tequila. It was actually overpowering.
