The cookies looked wonderful for the effect, but the taste was horrible.  Were these meant to be eaten??? I pitched the whole batch. As a matter of fact, my dog would not eat them either.

When I first saw this, I thought "I just have to make this for my friends". Of course, I did modify the recipe slightly- Cut the flour to two cups, and add 1/3 cup of cocoa powder. Used 1 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. Cut the molasses to 1/8 cup, increased the honey to 3/8 cup. Added 1/2 cup of crushed Heath bars. Added 1/2 cup brown sugar.  The guys at work got a kick out of them, but I practically had to force feed the girls to get them to try it. It reminded me of the Cracklin Oat Bran cereal.  Second batch I made I left out the brown sugar (ok, I forgot to add it), and took it over to watch the Rose Bowl game with friends. They all liked them. One even said she liked that they weren't as sweet as the Christmas cookies, because she was starting to get tired of all the sweetgoodies of the season.  I gave it a four instead of five mainly because I'm not a big fan of Grapenuts, and that's the most dominant flavor- to me at least- but still pretty good. The appearance is great for Halloween or practical jokes. I could definitely see myself making these again.  Just my two cents.

These cookies tasted like POOP.....BUT for as HILARIOUS as they are, it was worth every effort put into them (which was pretty much zero).  I got such a kick out of everyone trying to figure out "who the" \ "what the" is that, HA!  I think you could probably use the Reese's Chewy Chocolate cookie recipe for these & they would be funny & good.  Thanks for the humor Jackie, it made my day..Happy Halloween!! ;)

This cookie was...interesting. 
I added mini m&m's for color and a little coconut.
They ended up being a little tough but the
chocolate made that easier to over-look. 
The dough had to be refrigerated, which 
took more time and I'm not sure that kids would
really like the strong molasses taste.

I have been making these cookies for my son's class for years and yes, they are bland so i do add a 1/4 cup of sugar and i melt in some real choco chips for flavor but, I also put candy, stickers and treats under the "litter' as an extra surprise for that kids. They will eat enough "" at a classroom party anyway. They are mostly used a visual.

While these are "startling" to say the least, and did give the desired effect, they are very bland, and very dry.  Nothing less would do for a prank, but be aware, the cookie itself isn't much to dig for.

These cookies are almost as good as the real thing.  They taste as yummy-in-the-tummy-licious as they look. Try them with very berry blue tum-e yummies! M-m good.

Really do look like Cat Poop.  If you sprinkle grape nuts cereal around it'll look like kitty litter, too.  The taste of these cookies isn't that great.  Very bland and flat.  But kid's will gobble them up anyway for sheer novelty.

Surprisingly nice!!! I rolled them in coconut mixed in with the grapenuts. They would make great normal Christmas cookies too, less of the poop shape.

The concept was good for Halloween however the cookie lacked the sweetness a cookie should have and it had too many different spices need to cut out the ginger and cloves in my opinion. It was more of a prank then anything else, let's see who we can trick into these cookies.
