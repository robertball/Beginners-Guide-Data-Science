According to my cookbook for this recipe, which has this recipe in it verbatim except for one problem, you are supposed to mix the 1/2 cup puree w/ the 1 cup of plain batter and set THAT aside. The remaining plain batter goes in the bottom, making the thicker layer the white layer. That takes care of people feeling the need to add more cream cheese mixture--it was just supposed to be mixed up differently to begin with. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a big hit over the holidays!  I also made a few changes by combining some suggestions from previous reviews.  first off, I made a gingersnap/shortbread cookie crust in a 10 inch springform pan.  I used 3 packages of cream cheese and 1/2 cup of sour cream(as suggested in a previous review).  After putting in the first layer I added almost a whole can of pumpkin puree and added more spices than the recipe called for and 1 tbsp of spiced rum suggested in a previous review. I cooked it in a water bath at 350 for one hour and it didn't crack at all.  I served this with a homemade cinnamon whipped cream.  Everyone loved this cheesecake and I will definitely be making it again!!!  Thanks for the great recipe and for all the great reviews!

I pretty much followed this recipe exactly. Everyone loved it. I did make a minor change, I made mini cheesecakes instead of 1 big one. I took crushed graham crackers and butter and lined the bottom of cupcake liners and then followed the recipe as directed. I added some pumpkin pie spice for extra flavor.

Great Recipe! I'm on Weight watchers, so I substituted Splenda for Sugar and Low-Fat Cream cheese for regular cream cheese. I baked it in a low-fat pre-made graham cracker crust. It is absolutely wonderful, and only has 5 points per serving! I will be making this again for Thanksgiving!

My guests and I loved this.  The only change I plan on making is to increase the plain cheesecake filling; it was barely noticeable.

This is fantastic!  I made some alterations, as follows:  Increased the non-pumpkin batter to 1 1/2 cups, increased the sugar to 1/2 cup plus 2 tbsp., increased the vanilla extract to 1 teaspoon, instead of the various spices, I used 1 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice, as well as 1/2 tsp of additional cinnamon, added 1/2 cup low fat sour cream to the batter to make it creamier, and the biggest change was that I baked it in mini-graham cracker shells, for individual cheesecakes, for approximately 20 minutes.  They came out looking great!!!  I am going to serve them with a dollop of whipped topping, with a little sprinkle of cinnamon, and then some caramel sauce swirled on top.  I can't wait for my party tomorrow!!

A good recipe for thanksgiving!  I adjusted the spices to my taste and increased the nutmeg (1/2 t) and cloves (1/4).  I also used the whole can of pumpkin puree!  I didn't know what to do with the other half and I doubled the recipe so it worked out well!

The entire family LOVED this dessert! Even those who aren't typically pumpkin lovers said it was one of the best desserts they'd had! 
It's definitely more of a cheesecake than a pumpkin pie, the pumpkin is very subtle, and provides a nice spice to it.

I would certainly make this again for holiday dinners!

Well, I've made this recipe about 4 times in the last 2 weeks.  NEVER had one complaint, only non-stop compliments!  I tried it with both reduced fat and regular cream cheese and I've learned that it tastes exactly the same either way!  I use 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of each individual spice and pumpkin pie filling instead of puree'.  At the advice of another reviewer, I placed the cheesecake layer in the freezer while I prepared the pumpkin layer in order to get a more pronounced double layer.  I also found that the cheesecake should bake no less than 50 minutes; I didn't have any problem with a cracked top.  
Several people told me that they are not pumpkin pie fans but found the lightly "whipped" taste of the pumpkin-cheese mixture quite tasty.  Thanks for a great recipe!  It will definitely be a regular during the holiday season.

This tastes amazing! I love cheesecake & pumpkin pie.  Anything that combines these 2 flavors is just brilliant!  I made a few changes as suggested by others..  Used 3 pkgs of cream cheese, almost a whole 15oz can of pumpkin, and was generous with the spices.  Dont even need whipped topping, excellent as is.  Will definately make for this year's Thanksgiving & try the fat free/splenda version.  Yummy!!

This tastes amazing! I love cheesecake & pumpkin pie.  Anything that combines these 2 flavors is just brilliant!  I made a few changes as suggested by others..  Used 3 pkgs of cream cheese, almost a whole 15oz can of pumpkin, and was generous with the spices.  Dont even need whipped topping, excellent as is.  Will definately make for this year's Thanksgiving & try the fat free/splenda version.  Yummy!!

I found this recipe three or four years ago and tried it out for our Thanksgiving potluck, using some of the suggestions from others.  I doubled the recipe and made it in a springform pan, cooking it in a water bath.  It was a huge hit and I make it at least three times every holiday season now, always getting asked before parties if I'm bringing it!  It's really easy to make and so delicious.  I use half low fat cream cheese and half regular.  The first couple of times I made it, I had trouble getting even layers so now after pouring in the first layer, I put it in the refrigerator while mixing the second layer.  When I'm ready, I spoon in the second layer to keep it from being too heavy in any one place.  I find that I always have to cook it for almost an hour and a half, but it's worth it!!

This recipe is wonderful and easy to make.. I wanted a swirl in the cheesecake, so I took 1/2 cup of the cheesecake mixture and saved it for the swirl on top.. it was beautiful and if you can make your own graham cracker crust, please do it.. it makes a difference .. I did bake it 5 min longer than it said and it was perfect..

Amazing! Followed the recipe to a tee and it was perfect!! I made this for my family last Christmas and it was a hit.  I loved that the pumpkin flavor wasn't too overwhelming.  I will definitely make this again.

This is very good! I added the half cup of sour cream, another cream cheese, and a cup of pumpkin like other suggested. I also made my own graham cracker crust from a recipe on this site. It's not too heavy, and the pumpkin flavor isn't overpowering at all.. Delicious!

I am a diehard cheesecake fan, but I am not so big on pumkin. I did change the pumkin for pureed pears and it was lighter and my family loved it! But at the holidays I always make it with pumkin

My friends and family love this recipe! Though I have found that if you use the 2 extra serving graham cracker crust it works better and for the chocolate lover try using the Oreo Graham cracker crust, my boyfriend loves it so much better than the regular graham cracker crust.

Easy and delicious. I added an extra 1/2 cup of pumkin and I think it is tastier using canned pumkin with spices as oppose to prepared pumkin pie mix.

WOW!  This was awesome!  I made my graham cracker crust and I used 3 blocks of cream cheese instead of 2.  After I put the 1st layer down on the crust, I added one can of pumpkin (instead of 1/2 cup)to the remaining mix and an extra egg.  I also added extra of all the spices- we like a lot of spice :)  Baked it for an hour in a springform pan and it was wonderful!  My cheesecakes always crack, but when it is covered in whipped cream, no one's the wiser.  Very good recipe for the Holidays.  Thanks!

this was absolutely amazing!!! definitely a hit at thanksgiving dinner. i had extra filling so i made a second pie by layering the first layer with the pumpkin cheesecake filling and then the top layer was just whipped topping. they both came out amazing.. the double layered cheesecake was good for cheesecake lovers and the pumpkin cheesecake with whipped topping pie was a great alternative for relatives who prefer a not so heavy cheesecake. great recipe.. oh i also used pumpkin spice and i upped the cream cheese to 3 packets.

I TRIPLED THIS RECIPE FOR OUR THANKSGIVING LUNCHEON TODAY.  AND IT WAS A HUGE SUCCESS!!! I DID TWEAK IT CAUSE I'M A SWEET POTATO PERSON.  I USED A 28 OZ CAN OF SWEET POTATO PIE FILLING INSTEAD.  I ALSO ADDED A PINCH OF ALLSPICE.  I ALSO FOLLOWED A REVIEWER AND SCOOPED OUT A CUP AND 1/2 OF THE CREAM CHEESE MIXTURE TO SPREAD IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CRUST.  AND BECAUSE I WAS MAKING A SPICE CAKE THAT WANTED MY EGGS TO BE ROOM TEMP, I SAT MY EGGS FOR THIS OUT TOO, ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW IF IT HAD ANY EFFECT ON THE AWESOME OUTCOME OR NOT.  I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY COPIES OF MY TWEAKED RECIPE I HAD TO HAND OUT TODAY!  5 AND COUNTING!!  I WILL BE MAKING MANY MORE OF THESE NOW RENAMED "DOUBLE LAYER SWEET POTATO CHEESECAKE"!!!

When I make this I don't bother separating it at all.  I just blend it all together to pour into the crust.  I also buy the keebler graham cracker crumbs and follow the recipe on the box for their crust.  By doing the crust this way it's much richer and everyone raves about it.  Sometimes I will take caramels and evaporated milk and melt them in the microwave and spread the sauce over the cheesecake once it's cooled as well.  Either way it's fabulous!

Do not mess with this recipe! It is perfect as is. The only changes I made was to omit the ground cloves, since I didn't have any. If you would like to save a few extra calories, you don't even need to add the whipped topping! It's just as good without it. The only negative thing that I could possibly say was that the top "cracked" after I took it out of the oven. But who cares how it looks, the taste is what matters! YUMMM!

very fast and easy. I had a ready made crust that was a bit bigger than the 9" the recipe called for (a new product;it said it had two extra servings and is by Keebler)...so I used a whole cup of pumpkin. I took the pie out of the oven when it was done, and it immediately started to crack. I put it right back in to cool, left it for 2 hours, and the cracks healed.  Should have listened to other reviewer.  Very delicious.

This was great. A friend reccomended it after I was complaining that everytime I made pumpkin cheesecake, it was pretty "blah". I opted to make my own crust out of gingerbread graham crackers, and used a springform pan so it would take the shape of a cheesecake instead of a pie.

I love this recipe because it is so easy.  I get so many compliments everytime I make it.  The ingredients are inexpensive.  Everyone who tries it is always amazed that it only took me about 15 minutes to whip it up.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  I didn't try it myself but everyone seemed to like it and a few loved it.  I made a graham cracker crust myself since all the ones at the grocery store were broken.

Awesome recipe!  I made this crust with cinnamon graham crackers.  This tasted fantastic.  I think cinnamon compliments pumpkin very well.  I will make this over and over.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was amazing, but I did add 4 more oz of cream cheese to make it more cheese-cake-like. WHEN I make this again, I think I'll do an entire 3.  It was the perfect texture and had a great pumpkin pie flavor.  I also used a chocolate crust instead of graham, but that's my preference of mixing chocolate and pumpkin.  So good!

Unbelievable!!!  I debated on which pumpkin cheesecake recipe to try, and this one will DEFINITELY be the one to keep.  My family loved it!  I ended up making a second one a few hours later to give to my sister because it was so good.  It is SO easy to make, and once it chills for a few hours, it is DELICIOUS!   Not too sweet, and just the right amount of pumpkin and spice, and cheesecake flavor.  WONDERFUL!

This was delicious!  I made it for friends and they raved about it!!! I did add more spice and pumpkin as some of the other recipes mentioned.  I will also make my own crust next time.

This was an amazing recipe. I have been meaning to rate it earlier but I never got around to it.  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner for dessert and it was a hit! Everyone asked for the recipe but I didn't share it... I want this to be my secret weapon every year!   Thanks for the recipe!

This was an amazing recipe. I have been meaning to rate it earlier but I never got around to it.  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner for dessert and it was a hit! Everyone asked for the recipe but I didn't share it... I want this to be my secret weapon every year!   Thanks for the recipe!

This is my all-time favorite pumpkin cheesecake recipe! I have been making it for three years now and it never disappoints. It may just be my oven, but I've found I have to let it cook at least 45 minutes for the center to set properly.

You can't go wrong with this cheesecake! Nearly foolproof and has a classic pumpkin pie flavor to it. Delicious! I made it exactly as is, baked 35 minutes, it turned out beautifully, not a crack in sight on the top either.

I won a bake-off with this recipe! It was great! The only thing I goofed was not letting it refrigerate long enough! I was pushed for time and it did not set all the way, but still took people's choice award! This is a keeper, and now everyone wants it for Thanksgiving!! Thanks

I love this recipe and so did my family. I have made four pies within two days, by request of my step daughters. The only thing i did differnt was double the recipe and add a half cup of confectioners sugar instead of a full cup of white sugar. A definate five star award should go with this recipe. A+A+A+A+

This is super easy to make and absolutely delicious.  My husband actually asked where I bought it from!  I've made it several times and the last time I mixed it all together.  I think it had an even better taste, although you don't get the pretty presentation of the layers.

Thank you so much for this recipe! It was my first attempt at cheesecake and it turned out perfectly and looked beautiful. I don't even own a spring form pan (is that what it's called?) and it didn't even matter..it came out so perfectly. I love this recipe because I'm a brand newbie to baking and it made me look and feel like a PRO! thank you sooo much for sharing such a great recipe!!!!!!! I wish I could give it more than five stars!!!

Very yummy!  I took it to my holiday dinner and work and one or even two wasn't enough to go around--first dessert on the table to vanish.  I loved it myself and it was definately easy to make!

All I can say is, this pie ROCKS!! It's very easy, all you do is mix the ingredients, pour, and bake! And the taste is great! When you cut it, it looks very cool with the thin layer of cheesecake on the bottom. I was asked to make it again! :)

This cheesecake was absolutely fantastic!  My guests loved it (one even said it was the best cheesecake he had ever had!).  I loved it!  Thank you so much for a great recipe Ms. Phillips.

Excellent and quick recipe.  All my taste testers loved it, and they are picky.  Nice light cheesecake flavor with a hint of pumpkin pie.

Thought August was a little early to make a pumpkin cheesecake but then heard a Starbucks commercial for Pumpkin Spice Latte and decided that pumpkin cheesecake would totally be legit then. Lol! Tripled the recipe for an event I signed up to bring desert to and it was a big hit! Followed the recipe to a "T". Everyone loves it!

My very first cheesecake!  This couldn't be easier and my four year old was 'helping' so you know it's not complicated.  Very rich and very tasty.  Will be making this one yearly.

Really good!! I made it twice. First I didn't have much cheesecake part but the pumpkin part is actually cheesecake too. I made it on Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I don't know what -terry is talking about that it was horrible. Must have made the recipe wrong.

I changed this up to follow my low carb diet by adding stevia instead of sugar, actual pureed pumpkin, and made the crust out of almond flour.  It turned out fantastic.

This cheesecake was so so. Nothing really that special. The family really really liked it, but I think I'll add more to the bottom layer next time. And a different topping to spice it up a bit.

This was a super yummy pie. I added a little more pumpkin than the recipe called for (I was worried about the color) and all worked fine. I made 2 regular pumpkin pies and on double layer pumpkin cheesecake, since we only had a few "cheesecake eaters" at Thanksgiving. To my surprise I have no left over cheesecake.

I was not overly impressed with this recipe.  First, as other reviewers have stated, you need to add a lot more spices to have any flavor.  I doubled the spices called for and still could have used more.   Also, if you are making in your own 9" springform pan and not using a premade "tiny" crust from the store, you will need to double the recipe overall.  I used double ingredients and still came out with a pretty thin cheesecake.    For the bottom layer if you want a nice white layer to show, you'll need at least two cups of the pre-pumpkin / cheesecake only mix to start.   I used Splenda instead of sugar and found the cake was hardly sweet at all.  My parents liked this as they prefer non-sweet desserts, however I would have prefered it to be much sweeter.   Overall it was an okay recipe, but nothing that the family will be begging me to make again.

We really enjoyed this.  I gave it 4 stars as I made it exactly as written, and after tasting the pumpkin filling before pouring it into the crust, had to add another 1/4 cup of sugar- it just wasn't sweet enough and tasted a bit off.  I personally like traditional pumpkin pie the best, and other flavors of cheesecake.

This is very yummy. I am currently using this for a restaurant I bake for. But, I double the recipe and add more pumpkin to give it more oomph.

All I have to say it when I made this for our Thanksgiving work party.  (Made four) My VP said i either deserved a hug or raise for bringing this.  An absolute treat at Thanksgiving.

All I have to say it when I made this for our Thanksgiving work party.  (Made four) My VP said i either deserved a hug or raise for bringing this.  An absolute treat at Thanksgiving.

Very good cheesecake. It came out very "flat", so next time I will add 3 blocks of cream cheese and use a smaller springform pan.  I did add 1/2 cup sour cream which made it light and baked in a water bath.  Served with homemade whipped cream (heavy cream, sour cream, vanilla and confectioner's sugar).

This was a good recipe but not great. It was more pumpkin pie than what I consider a good cheesecake. If you like no-bake cheesecakes and ones that whip up real easy, this is something for you however, if you're like me and want the baked more New York tasting cheesecake this is not it. For what it is, it is good though.

I didnt make this or even tasted it, but my 14 year old daughter made this to bring to her dads on Thanksgiving. It was the first pie to go and people who never eat pie or cheesecake loved it. So given the ease of the pie and the reveiew its a 5 star....

I made this to take to my in laws Thanksgiving dinner and it was a big hit!  Very easy to make and it turned out perfectly!  I followed some of the tips from others and used 3 8 ounce packages of cream cheese and 1/2 cup of sour cream added after the eggs are beaten in.  It is definitely a cheesecake with a mild pumpkin flavor...so if you dont like cheesecake, don't try it.  I got some Cool Whip to serve with it, but it really didn't need it.  Wonderful texture.  My husband is not a big fan of pumpkin pie, but he thought it was delicious.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe I will make again and again.

I read through the reviews and revised a little. It didn't rise at all, so I took out a tiny slice and it was fabulous! (I made for Thanksgiving, so I wanted to be sure it wasn't a flop) I used 3 pkgs of cream cheese, 1/3 c sour cream, only had 2 eggs, used extra pumpkin & spices. I tried my first water bath and it was a consistent texture all through. I had read that foil can leak so I used a Reynold's cooking bag to prevent water seepage - it worked perfectly...just scrunch the bag down to the top of the pan and it won't fall over on the cheesecake! ( or you could cut some of the excess off...I was trying to see if I could re-use the bag) I baked for 50 minutes and removed from oven immediately to cool. I let sit for an hour and put in refrigerator...no cracks! It's not a heavy cheesecake...very light. Love it!

This was good, probably better if I added the nutmeg or allspice, my kids have nut allergies and I do not want to take a chance.  But the family loved it and it looks great with the two layers.

This recipe is delicious and very easy to throw together for those last minute guests you may have (provided you have pumpkin puree on hand, that is!)  I used low fat cream cheese to cut down on fat, but then reloaded it back on w/making a homemade graham cracker crust from this website, and topping it w/whipped topping.  Oh well, it was worth it!  Husband and in-laws loved it.

This is a fabulous cheesecake.  Everyone loves it.  Cheesecake lovers, pumpkin pue lovers (and pumpkin pie haters) aLL love this cake!  I like to drizzle carmel syrup over the top to give it a little more flavor.

I love this but I do up it by one third and this time I used a gingersnap and graham cracker crust which gave it a little zest. Wow it was so good.. no whipped topping, only fresh whipped cream in dollups.

This was absolutely fantastic! I made it for Christmas and it was such a huge hit that everyone asked me to continue it as a tradition. Perfect texture, scrumptious flavor, and easy to make. Thank you!!!

I felt bad that I don't love traditional pumpkin pie, so I decided to try this recipe and I'm SO glad I did!  This is the best!  It tastes so great!  I used the Keebler Shortbread pre-made crust and everyone LOVED it!

I made exactly as written... turned out beautifully and layered nicely. I refrigerated the cheesecake layer while I made the pumpkin layer and it helped when spreading. The only thing I would do differently, is add a little more sugar to the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Cheesecake is cheesecake, so I rated it 3 stars as it was still "good"; however, it didn't layer like I expected. Instead, the pumpkin part made the underlying cheesecake part a bit splotchy. I will probably make it again, but play around with the thickness/consistency of the layers. I made my GF, so was able to offer it to others with food allergies! :)

To the person who left one star. Sorry but you simply do not know how to bake!! If you make this correctly it is a smash. Always the favorite dessert where ever I bring it or serve it and I been making this for years now. I do add one teaspoon of vanilla, but always add more vanilla in all baking recipes, and TS of cinnamon and a little more of the nutmeg as well. A smash hit. So again anyone who gave this a bad rating you simply are doing something completely wrong. And if you can not make this simple recipe and get 5 star raves for years like I have you need to give up baking all together. It is really good with some caramel poured on top with cool whip. Makes it even better served that way and served ice cold. :)

The first time I made this I totally messed up and so it was an all pumpkin cheesecake!  It was still wonderful.  I have been making this exact recipe for years and am looking forward to having it again!  Thank you for the recipe.

The only change I made was per a previous review, set the 1/2 cup pumpkin puree with one cup batter aside and put the remaining batter in the bottom of crust (for white layer). Came out great.

I`ve made this recipe numerous times, and it always gets eaten right away.  I put one cup of cream cheese mixture aside to mix with the pumpkin, and use the rest of the cream cheese for the bottom layer.  I also increase the amount of pumpkin and spices.

Made this for bridge club dessert and it was a big hit! Delicious and very easy to make. I used a prepared chocolate crust in place of the graham cracker crust. Turned out great.

This was amazing! My husband and friends loved it! I had to bake this longer than the time it said and normally that's not the case with my oven. I just had to keep an eye on it till it was finished. I will be making this again next year for Thanksgiving. Thanks so much!

Yummy! This disappeared faster on thanksgiving than regular pumpkin pie.  IF I made any changes, it would be to add more spices as it is mild.  But it was such a big hit I'd think hard about changing anything.  Very easy to make.

Really good and very easy. The only thing I did not like was the frozen whipped topping. Next time I will make real whipped cream.

Excellent. This was the hit of the Thanksgiving dinner. It replaced the pumpkin pie and was requested for next year! I made the following changes: I used a homemade graham cracker crust, used canned pumpkin, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and I baked it for 50 minutes. I also left it in the oven to cool after it was done baking.

This was so easy to make and my boyfriend loved it!!  Cheesecake and Pumpkin go amazing together.  I took the reviewers advice and used the pumpkin pie filling.  However, i still added a little bit of Nutmeg and Cinnamon to the recipe.  :0)

Double the cheesecake layer & it will be a 5 star recipe.  This pumpkin cheesecake & the sourcream lemon pie was the hit for Thanksgiving this year.  We had never had so many compliments.  Tons of pies & none left over for the next day.  If you make the sour cream lemon pie, double the lemon.

This was awsome!  I made it with a healthy graham craker crust recipe from this site, and used half low fat cream cheese to decrease the fat a little.  I think it turned out wonderful, thank you for this recipe.

This was awsome!  I made it with a healthy graham craker crust recipe from this site, and used half low fat cream cheese to decrease the fat a little.  I think it turned out wonderful, thank you for this recipe.

Excellent cheesecake!  I gave the recipe 4 stars instead of 5 b/c I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I can't ever leave a recipe well enough alone. :o)  I made my own crust using cinnamon graham crackers & pressed it into a 10-in springform pan.  I also added an extra 4 oz. cream cheese and an extra egg to the batter, plus an extra 1/2 c. pumpkin to the pumpkin layer, in addition to using pumkin pie filling with extra spices rather than just pumpkin puree.

My cheesecake cracked something fierce (didn't have anything big enough to stick it in for baking in a water bath), so I ended up making Cinnamon Cream Syrup (from this site) and pouring over the top to disguise the cracks.  It looked a little bland, so I crushed some butter toffees and sprinkled the crumbs over all.  The cheescake was spectacular, and the added toppings were just guilding the lily, so to speak.  This recipe (or my version of it) will be on my holiday menu from now on!

This was very good - used a ginger cookie crust (Anna's Ginger Thins - crust was awesome!) and doubled everything and used a 9" springform pan.  I basically split the batter in half and used half plain for the bottom layer and mixed the pumpkin and spices into the other half, and got two perfect thick layers.  Took about 50 minutes to bake, then turned the oven off and left it until cool.  Very attractive and tasted good too (I even used low-fat cream cheese)

I served this dessert today after Thanksgiving dinner. It was a big hit. I received so many compliments on how fantastic it tasted. It's hard to believe something so easy to make could be that wonderful. The only thing I left out was the pinch of ground cloves only because I did'nt have any, but I don't think it affected the outcome at all. Thank you Stephanie for sharing your recipe and making our holiday dessert extra special.

I used Maria's Gemasa Cookies, much like animal crackers flavor, for the crust (with the pecans.) Cookies are not too sweet and work well with cream pies also.   I did add a bit more spice.   
Excellent recipe!! This year (my first) is giving thanks to the All Recipes Website! I love it!!

This pie is wonderful, I cooked it for the first time the other day using the recipe just as it is, and it was perfect. 
It is suprisingly simple to make, and it is delicious. My family is already begging me to make another one.

Absolutely Delicious!  I made 2 pies and used a whole can of pumpkin that I pureed with the blender (I couldn't find anything to make with the remainder of the can) I also made my own graham cracker crusts. Other than that I followed the recipe and both pies disappeared in a week! This will become a tradition for our family Thanksgivings!

Oh my god---this cheesecake was AWESOME!!!!! I followed it to a T and it turnes out perfectly. The hardest part was waiting the 3 hours for it to come out of the fridge, but it was well worth the wait. Even my 9 y.o. son who isn't keen on either pumpkin pie or cheesecake absolutly loved it and couldn't get enough of it. I'm definitly making this for Thanksgiving.

I took the advice of others and used pumpkin pie filling instead of pumpkin puree. I also added about 3 tbs more pumpkin than it called for. I baked it for at least 55 minutes and it still ended up a little under cooked in the middle but if I'd baked it longer the outside would've been too done. I'm not sure what went wrong. It tasted good though.

This was absolutely fantastic! If you really love pumpkin, add in extra. The first time I made it I didn't think it had enough pumpkin. I brought it to a large event around Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! It was the only dessert that was completely gone.

Very good recipe. I followed directions but had to leave mine in the oven for about 10-15 minutes longer than the recipe calls for. This was a hit on Thanksgiving. I will be saving this one.

This had a very good flavor but I was expecting it to be a little less soft like a regular cheescake or pumpkin pie. It is more soft like a mousse. I may have just undercooked it.

I thought this was really delicious and a nice change from pumpkin pie. I increased the spices for my spice-loving audience. My  only quibble was that I couldn't really taste the pumpkin; maybe adapt the recipe to use a cup or more of pumpkin puree?

This is such an easy cheescake recipe, and tastes so good.  A good way to serve pumpkin other than the normal pumpkin pie.  Will make it again!

Thanks for this recipe, I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the spices listed.  I made this for Thanksgiving and my mother-in-law "told" me I was bringing it for Christmas.  I also made it for treat day at work and everyone wanted the recipe.  Thanks again!

This was so easy to make, and got great reviews at dinner.  We even doubled the recipe with no trouble :)
