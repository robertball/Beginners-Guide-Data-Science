Lovely.  Having no sour cream in the fridge, I substituted half and half.  Also, I increased the sauce a bit because I served over bowtie pasta and, well, let's face it ~ you can never have enough sauce!  I might ease back a tad on the salt next bime but my husband thought it was perfect as is.  This tasted like something you would get in a fine resturant, but was so simple and made with ingredients I had on hand.  Does life get better than this!?!

This was a very tasty dish.  I did not have wine on hand and used chicken broth instead.  I agree that capers would be good in place of olives and you could even add artichokes (non marinated kind).  I poured the whole thing over a box of farfalle and doubling the sauce would be good since the pasta soaked up a lot of the sauce.  I will make this again!  Thanks!

This was delicious! I didn't know how much milk to add so I just poured a little in. I didn't add the olives and added 1/2 a cup of sun-dried tomatoes instead of 1/4 a cup. I served the chicken and sauce over bow-tie pasta and it was delicious! Thanks for a great recipe! Will def. use again!

Fabulous!  We're not big Italian fans but the flavors of this chicken & sauce were wonderful!  Made this in the crock pot, using frozen chicken tenders,  which also made this so easy!  I did substitute a can of chopped tomatoes w/garlic & onion for the sun dried tomatoes and added a chopped red bell pepper and a can of artichokes.  I also used a small jar of capers & the green olives, but the olives definitely made the difference!   I mixed everything but the chicken & artichokes together & then  layered the chicken, sauce, & artichokes.  Cooked on high 5 - 7 hours.    Ladled it over bow tie pasta.  Thanks for the recipe!  This will be a great dish for potlucks and soooo easy!!

Flavorful and delicious! This is not your run of the mill, bland chicken dish. I made 1.5 times the amount of sauce called for in the recipe and served it over farfalle, which was fabulous. Next time I will double the sauce, though, rather than just 1.5ing it.

Excellent! I sliced and cut up a chicken breast but I should've cut the pieces smaller so tenders would have been better.  Flavor is rich but not overly.  I can imagine many alterations and substitutions for a variety of flavors: capers, black olives, parm. cheese, shrimp.

Delicious! I loved the tangy tomato taste with the olives. I feel like the sauce could've been a little richer, though.

This was recommended on the Recipe Exchange (tab at the top) and I liked the flavors.  I had to substitute capers for the olives, but they have a similar briny flavor.  I did not serve it over pasta or rice to save the carbs.  Adding an extra splash of white wine at the end really makes it special!

I made this while in a very "Italian" mood- very good even though I didn't have the indgredients on hand.  I substituted sun dried red peppers for the tomatoes- I didn't have any sour cream on hand, so I used half and half.  I servied in over gluten-free fettuccine. Excellent, I will definetly keep this one.

I used capers instead of olives and added roasted red bell pepper instead of just sun dried tomatoes. Partyly to suit a picky DH and partly because of what was on hand. Also used only half and half since sour cream isn't very Mediterranean. Divine! I'll double the sauce ingredients next time as my husband wished he had more to put on the pasta.

Pretty good.  I used the dry packaged sun dried tomatoes b/c it was what we had and served this with pasta.  Hubby and I enjoyed it and the kids ate it :)  Next time I will probably use kalamata olives.

Very good chicken dish.  I agree with making more sauce for the pasta.  I did not do the last step of adding the cornstarch.  It was creamy after adding the sour cream and milk.  I turned off the heat for a bit when adding the sour cream and milk since I didn't want it the sauce to curdle.  After stirring the sour cream and milk in thoroughly I turned the heat onto warm and added the chicken back into the pan.

This was so flavorful!  I didnt add as much chicken as the recipe states.  About a lb. of chicken to this recipe is perfect for us with the amount of sauce.  I served this over penne pasta.  We arent olive lovers, so I know it probably defeats the whole "mediterranean" purpose of this recipe but I left them out and added onion instead.  At the last minute I noticed that my sun dried tomatoes were expired.  I happened to have some sun dried tomato pesto, so I used that in place.  It gave the sauce so much flavor and next time I will probably add in the pesto again, along with the sun dried tomatoes as well.  With the sour cream, I added in a little chunk of cream cheese to melt and make the sauce nice and creamy.  While eating it I thought that it would be good by adding some crumbled feta cheese on top when serving.  Great recipe!  We loved it!  Thanks so much!

Made this to a T - found it very, very bland. The sour cream coats the mouth, making the sauce almost grainy and quite unpleasant. Would not make again.

I really, really liked that (I had seconds :) Had to use sherry wine as that was all I had on hand, but the flavors of this dish are beautifully paired and it sure didn't hurt a thing. Simple to make yet it looks and tastes like what you would receive if you ordered from a good Italian restaurant. I will be making this again for sure. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

So, so, so BLAND!  I followed the recipe exactly and served over farfelle.  I was expecting something delicious after the great reviews and my taste buds fell asleep instead of celebrating as they led me to believe they would.  I can't imagine why anyone would rave over this dish.

I do not usually rate recipes a 5.  I would do this exactly like it is.....i had some chopped fresh tomato's in my fridge and added them at the end before removing the chicken.  Also stir your cornstarch.  I always make my cornstach thicker and add a little at a time.  Cooking the sauce a little longer made it very nice.  Will definately make again.

This was so simple and delicious!  I've now made it several times and the only change I've done is make more sauce - to ensure there is enough for the pasta.  Also - if you happen to not have white wine handy - I have substituted in red wine vinegar (yes, vinegar) and it gives it a great zesty flavor.

Very tasty. The sauce came out great - perfect thickness for this recipe. I omitted the olives and added peas instead. Made a 2nd time a few weeks later and added a half cup of golden raisins instead of olives to give it some sweetness and that came out well too.

Loved it! I also doubled the sauce like many other reviewers. Otherwise, made it as written. Served with Mediterranean Black Olive Bread. Perfect meal.

I always try the recipe as is before I adjust but I seem to be having issues with my eyes...what I thought said 'green onions' actually said green olives. Since I didn't have any olives in the house and I did have capers, I threw those in instead. Geez. Excellent taste!! The sauce is light and very flavorful. I was a tad impatient with the sauce and didn't let it thicken as much as it should've before we devoured it. The sauce definitely thickens and tastes even better after it stands a bit. LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!! I put it over spaghetti and served with salad.  Will try next time with the olives and make enough to cook up with shrimp for my honey and chicken for me.

This was a total waste of time, money and effort.  It had no taste.  Thank goodness I had made a blackberry cobbler to compensate.

A big hit with my family! My changes: I doubled the sauce as others suggested to do (but found myself with a lot of leftover sauce) and used Kalamata olives in place of the green ones. I think the sauce could use a bit more cornstarch, as it took awhile to thicken. I served this with some freshly-grated Parmesan on top and a Buttercrunch lettuce salad from our garden on the side.

Absolutely freakin' fantastic!!  I served this over bowtie pasta, and to save time, I used a bag of pre-cooked frozen chicken breast strips.  Wow!  I'm definitely adding this one to my repetoire.  :-)

I thought this was great!.. I served over pasta and would love to add even more green olives to this next time (if the kids aren't eating it)  I used petite diced tomatoes to replace the sun dried tomatoes.  Really good! :)

Great flavors! We put it on spaguetti, I think the bow ties would have been better. I wouldn't change a thing! I didn't give it a 5 because it has to knock my socks off for that. This was just plain good!

I made this dish two nights ago and my family and I loved it! I used capers instead of olives as my son does not like olives, and I used half and half in place of the sour cream. I served with farfalle pasta. I'm sure it tastes great with chicken broth as many have used, but the wine really gives it something extra! Thanks for a great recipe.

We enjoyed this dish but everyone thought it needed something. The only changes I did was, skipped the olives since I didn't have any, used boneless skinless chicken breats, and used parsley from a spice jar instead of fresh. It would have tasted better with mushrooms and onions in it. We had it over penne pasta. I made a whole 16oz. box and there was plenty of sauce without making extra. I'll probably make this again with some added ingredients.

I love the flavors, I sub the cornstarch with nutritional yeast for more flavor and thickened the sauce perfectly. I served over cous cous with grilled eggplant.

WOW - was this good.  I didn't know what my kids would think of this, especially with the olives in it..but we all loved it.  It definitely has a mediterranean fresh and zingy taste but oh so good. This is a keeper.

I made half this recipe cutting the salt by half and decreasing the Italian seasoning to 1 t.  I doubled the olives.  I also went about this a little differently which in hindsight was probably a mistake.  I cooked my chicken completely in the pan and removed it to a warm oven.  Then I added my other ingredients.  I was concerned that the sour cream would curdle, so in an attempt to prevent this, I mixed it with the milk and tempered it in the microwave to warm it up a bit before adding it to the pan.  Well it didn’t help, my milk/sour cream mixture curdled immediately and I had a mess on my hands.  This was probably my fault.  I think my pan was too hot when I added it.  I was able to salvage it by constantly whisking over very low heat.  The flavor of this was very good, so I’ll have to give it another go, but I'll use heavy cream instead of sour cream.  It will better withstand the heat of the skillet.

My husband likes red sauces so I've never tried a recipe with a creamy sauce.  I made this last night and he loved it!  So did I.  This is more than ample for 2 people.  I was heavy handed on the olives and sundried tomatoes.  I serve this with angelhair pasta and salad.  I used lowfat milk.  Maybe next time I will try it with lowfat sour cream.  Can't wait to have it again.

I was REALLY looking forward to tasting this dish since I adored the ingredients list, but after preparing it as written it fell a little short -- even after taking some of the "most poplular reviews" comments in mind and adding capers and increasing the olives (which helped a little); but it still was not as stellar as some reviewers would have you believe. Although hubs said he enjoyed it, we both agreed it was NOT company worthy as some have written.

My husband and I loved this! I halved the recipe since it is just the two of us, other than that, I followed the directions exactly. I served it over the bowtie pasta and it was delicious. It cooked in a matter of minutes which is great for a busy weeknight meal. I will definitely be using this recipe again...and again! Thanks so much for submitting it!

Excellent!!!  This is a delicious and easy way to prepare chicken and pasta.  I followed the recipe except I subbed veg broth for the wine as I didn't have an open bottle.  I served this over 1/2 lb. of farfalle pasta and the ratio of pasta to sauce was just about perfect.  Another good thing is that even though this is a creamy pasta dish, the calorie count is reasonable.  This is because milk and sour cream are used in the sauce instead of the cream that would typically be used.  You won't miss the cream a bit.  The sauce is wonderful.  This is definitely a keeper.

This was a very good recipe.  I did use capers instead of green olives since that is what I already had on hand.  It was a little salty - so just a warning before you add all the salt!!  I also added some parmesan cheese to the sauce.  Very good!!

This would easily be a five star dish, but I followed the enstructions exactly so when I took out the chicken pieces, most of the sundried tomatoes come out too so they didn't infuse their flavor into the sauce.  Next time I'll add the sundried tomatoees after I take out the chicken and I think it will be perfect!

Really wonderful!  Great flavor. Really easy to prepare. I would make sure that you chop and prep all of the ingredients ahead as it takes no time at all to cook. I will add more water and cornstarch next time for a thicker sauce. We added the cooked pasta just before the chicken at the end to coat everything.

Very good.  Made this for our weekly girls night dinner and it was a hit.  We added the chicken back in at the end and served with black rice.

I was hoping that I would really like this, but I didn't.  The flavor of Italian seasoning was too strong.  I would recommend cutting the Italian seasoning down to half the amount or even less.

Yum! This was SO good. Even my picky hubs raved!!! :) I'll admit, I wasn't sure I was going to like this at all.... I am not particularly fond of olives, sun-dried tomatoes (I can take or leave them) or tangy sauces, but the combination of all three really works here! To my surprise, the sauce was not tangy in the least!!! Having said this (and although tasty as is), I think I'll use capers from now on. Pair this with a simple Greek salad, farfalle (i.e. bow tie) pasta and crusty french bread or rolls and you'll have a fantastic, well-rounded Mediterranean-themed meal. Thanks SO much for sharing your uniquely delicious recipe, hike4diamonds! My husband and I DEVOURED it! :-)

Oh wow, it caught me off guard by its simplicity.  Very subtle yet complex flavors.  We will definitely be making this again soon.  I'm thinking that the sauce might be adaptable to a seafood medley.

I made this in the crockpot and it was juicey and delicious. Will try it again on the stovetop, or maybe even in the oven. The flavor was very subtle, so if you want to jazz it up with your own spices, it is a recipe that will be forgiving and still come out great!

This was excellent. So much flavor. It was as good as something you would get at a really good bistro. I added a touch of anchovie paste. Not enough for a defining flavor but it added depth. The new McCormick smokehouse pepper is great in this also. I added penne pasta right into the dish.

GREAT RECEIPE.  I was looking for something to serve this weekend for company and this is it!  Only change I made was that I used cooking sherry because I didn't have white wine and I used chopped black olives which had a worked out well.  In the produce section I found a bag of smoked sun dried tomatoes which were julienne cut and moist so they worked perfectly.  Definitely use fresh parsley if you have it.  If you like receipes that are a little different with some real flavor this is the one.  Thanks so much for a great receipe!!

Really good.  I was hesitant at first and didn't think that I'd like it as I was making it but turned out great.  Served with pasta and sub'd chicken broth for the wine.

My family loved this!  I couldn't find sun-dried tomatoes, so I used grape tomatoes.  It turned out great!  This recipe tastes a lot like Bertolli meals in a bag, which I love.  I will be making this again!

This was very flavorful.  I tried to make as written but discovered I was missing a couple things.  I only had breaded chicken tenders that were more of  a nugget size.  I think the breading absorbed much of the juice, so it wasnt very sauce-y but still very good with pasta.  I also didnt have sun-dried tomatoes, so I used a can of diced tomatoes.  (I had more than 12 tenders I think)  I also didnt have sour cream so I threw some cottage cheese in there and some half and half.  I probably should have added more milk, as it was very thick, but it turned out very good so I didnt want to chance it.  It was a little on the salty side.  I think my olives were to blame for that.  I will be making this again.  Thank you for sharing.

OK.  I tried this just as is, and it was really good.  Family loved it.  I tried it again, but substituted skinless, boneless chicken thighs, doubled the wine, garlic, seasonings, olives, etc., added an equal amount of sliced black olives, used dry-packed tomatoes, left out the milk, added 2 cups sour cream, left out the corn starch, and added cheese cheese tortellini (12 oz dried, cooked per package instructions) and let simmer for about 10 minutes to thicken.  Also turned out really good, and the family loved it.  Next time I am going to use good quality Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream.  I think this is a really outstanding sauce idea.  I also think it would work with scallops, shrimp or Italian sausage.  I have got to give recipe 5 stars.  Goes really well with sauted summer squash, tomatoes and onions seasoned with basil.

This was so yummy! I didn't have regular sun dried tomatoes, so I used sun dried tomato pesto (Gia Russa). It came out awesome! My husband loved it! :)

Very unique taste, although I couldn't get the sauce to thicken as much as I would have luck.  It's probably just lack of skill on my part.

This was excellent, my family loved it and if you can't handle all the dairy you can get fake sour cream and use non-dairy creamer, It takes out some of the fat too and it was excellent this way also

Delish! Did not have olives, nor do I care for them much, so I substituted with capers. I also did not have sun dried tomatoes in the oil so I used the regular ones. I also did not have cornstarch so I used flour and had to put in a little more than two tablespoons, to get it to a good thickness. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that it did not have as much flavor as I expected but it was very good and this recipie can be easily altered. I will make again!

I'll admit up front that I overcooked the chicken but besides that, these flavors (while I love each of them seperately) in my opinion, just did not marry well.  It wasn't aweful, but it wasn't great.  Not even good.  I'll recommend a pass on this.

My family loved this and my daughter said it is now her favorite meal and wants it for her birthday.  I substituted the green olives for Kalamata olives and instead of using the Italian seasoning I used McCormicks Montreal Chicken seasoning to give it more flavor.  I served this with egg noodles - a wonderful combination!

This was good.  I left the olives out, it was pretty salty without them even.  I used Organic Chicken Broth instead of wine and that boost the flavors a bit.  I also used the sun dried tomatoes not soaked in oil and they turned out just great.  I would definitely make this again.  However I think I would add some more veggies next time.  Asparagus, fresh basil, mushrooms.

This was very tasty. I had to use roasted bell peppers instead of sun dried tomatoes but it tasted even better. Took everyone's advice and doubled the sauce. It made a great cover for the pasta.

My husband liked this quite a bit - I thought it was ok.  I used grape tomatoes as I really don't like sun-dried and added a few mushrooms.  Served steamed broccoli on the side.  Not sure I'll make it again as I didn't think it was anything really special - thanks, however, for the recipe.  Keep them coming!

It wasn't what I was expecting for sure. Thought it tasted like it was missing something, rather bland. Definitely needs more corn starch then what was suggested. Probably wont make it again.

This was absolutely the best, I didn't have white wine so I used chicken broth, can't wait to taste it made with wine!  Everyone in the family from kids to Grandparents loved it.  I served it over egg noodles.  This is definitely "company" worthy, all that and easy too!

Very good!!!  We thought this was super flavorful!  Just adjust the salt to your liking and that's all you need!  We did as others and subbed out the olives for capers and I did add just a splash of heavy cream to the sauce to make it a little more creamier since I used 1% milk.  It's nice to find a tasty sauce without a TON of cheese in it.  5 stars!

Yum! I didn't have any olives on hand, so I doubled the amount of sundried tomatoes called for, and it turned out delicious :) Also, I reduced the amount of oil that the chicken was cooked in and it still tasted fine. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good. Quick to make. Might need a little more cornstarch to thicken sauce.

OMG this was wonderful! The sauce was full of flavor. I used capers instead of olives. After the sauce thickened I returned the chicken and cooked on low until the guests arrived. (Almost 45 min. longer) The chicken was even more tender.  Stir often though so the sauce doesn't stick.  I added this to angel hair pasta. Garlic bread and salad as sides.  Thank you for such a flavorful recipe.

This is definitely 4.5 stars as is. I think I'm not into dry wines so next time I'll decrease the seasonings and use my normal table wine. Also, maybe decrease the olives and increase the sun-dried tomatoes.
