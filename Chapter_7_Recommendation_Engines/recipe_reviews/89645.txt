We thought this was a fantastic recipe.  Please note:  you must reduce the sauce once you've added the balsamic vinegar by letting it simmer.  Otherwise it will taste like vinegar.   Balsamic vinegar reduction has a wonderfully sweet and flavorful taste.

nice recipe the only problem is that you can't add cornstarch or any other thickening agent into a hot liquid it must be COLD! or other wise the starch molecules will cook on the outside before the inside hence the ole lump syndroom

Delicious!  I only had salmon filets which worked well.  Baked them in the oven after brushing lightly with olive oil, squeezing on a bit of fresh lemon, and lightly dusting with seasoned salt, lemon pepper and dill.  Didn't have any honey so I added about a tsp. of brown sugar to the sauce.  Served with mashed red bliss potatoes and steamed asparagus.  Extra bonus:  The blueberry sauce was simply fabulous on the asparagus as well as the salmon!

We made this last night and I have to say that it was a total waste of time and money. If I could give less than one star I would. I followed this recipe without variations until I could do no more. The balsamic totally overpowered the berries. After doubling the OJ and honey it still was not improved. I added a whole tbs of sugar and a bit of vanilla to no avail. I don't know what purpose the chives served in this sauce. I couldn't taste any hint of them let alone see them etc. When my husband dropped the fish on the ground by accident I think that was sign from above to spare us this dish. We would have ate the fish without the sauce and I know I would have like that. Dinner was ruined with or without this sauce. We ended up having cheeseburgers. Factoring in the cost of that; this meal cost us in the neighborhood of $30 for the two of us to eat at home. I want my money back!!!

I did not like this at all, and I love salmon.  Maybe that's why - I'm somewhat of a salmon purist, as I think it is such a flavorful fish it really doesn't need a sauce this strong.   Also, I think the balsamic vinegar is way too strong in this.  I won't make this again with salmon, but I may tweak the sauce and try it with something like pork or chicken.  Too bad - I love the thought of using blueberries is something other than muffins/breads or dessert....

I thought this was fantastic.  I had a bunch of blueberries that I needed to use and was so excited when I found this recipe.  I reduced the balsamic first and that made a huge difference in the sauce not being too overpowering in the vinegar department.  I had a big salmon fillet so I baked it in the oven with some butter and light seasoning and the sauce was absolutely delicious with it.  Served with wild rice and green beans and both my husband and I loved it!  I will definitely make this again.

I found the balsamic vinegar's flavour did not complement the salmon; it was too overpowering and masked the flavour of the salmon.  I reduced the amount of vinegar to 1/8 cup and it was still too much... In the future, I'll reduce it again and maybe add only 2-3 tbsp.  Otherwise, the blueberries and OJ were a great match for salmon.

I used seasoned rice vinegar with basil and oregano, after reading that balsamic overwhelmed the salmon.  One of the best dishes I have ever made.  

Serve with wild rice and a spinach salad with a few fresh blueberries. A glass of Pinto Grigio and a French Apple Tart for dessert.

I didn't think that I would like this but it was good. And for all the "professional" cooks out there who don't know how to add cornstarch without it lumping....speaking as a beginner you can always add it to a little cold water and stir until well mixed then add it to the sauce. I've NEVER had it lump at all anytime I do that. But I AM just a beginner!! 

Great recipe, I will definitely try it again.

Amazing!  Barbequed a whole fresh salmon, and served it with the blueberry sauce and it is so good.  We all agreed 5 stars, and will definately make it again!

I have to say that this recipe was amazing. I played around with the sauce a bit using a raspberry blush balsamic vinegar, but kept everything else the same. It came out perfect, and the vinegar was not over powering. I served it with plain brown rice and a spinach and orange slice salad. I read quite a few complaints in the review section, and would just like to say that I believe you have to have the ability to tweak and experiment with any recipe to tailor it towards your specific tastes. This recipe overall is magnificent, but may very well not be to everyone's liking. What makes it a great recipe is that it is VERY easily changed in some minor ways to make it likable to many. If it's not you idea of perfection the first time try changing the type of balsamic vinegar or add less. I personally found that a fruit blush vinegar balances the flavor much better.

Very good, I used on 2T Balsamic, omitted the chives (didn't have any) and used with salmon fillets.  Had NO trouble with the cornstarch, the recipe has 1/4 cup of stock set aside for this purpose.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was still too vinegary. Added a lot of sugar just to neutralize the vinegar taste. Next time, I will reduce the vinegar by at least half.

I felt like the salmon and blueberries were fighting with eachother to be the stronger flavor. I did really enjoy the sauce and only used 2 tab. of balsamic vinegar bec I wasnt about to waste 20$. I think I might use the sauce on white fish bec the salmon didnt work for me but Im glad I tried this. Very Healthy.

Used blueberry jam with blueberries inside to save some dough. Made it a little watery, but I added more cornstarch and it tasted just as awesome.

I made this for CAMPING!  Froze the sauce just after adding the blueberries.  (Frozen sauce helps keep the ice chest cold besides.)  Brought the chives separately and snipped them over the sauced salmon.  I got RAVE reviews from our whole party, but then all food is great when you're camping.  You need to use good balsamic.  Cheap balsamic is sour!

I thought this was great! I get bored cooking Salmon sometimes and this was a nice change. I did reduce the Vinegar (used red wine instead of Balsamic) & added more honey. If I make this again I will probably eliminate the OJ all together. I didn't like the citrus flavor.

Please consider simply grilling a nice piece of salmon with simple salt, pepper, lemon and olive oil over this recipe.  It really overpowers the salmon flavor.  The sauce is just not interesting enough to justify replacing the salmon flavor.  No one in the family liked it.

After reading a good portion of the reviews, I decided to try this recipe because I was having a party and wanted to serve salmon. I listened to another reviewer and reduced the balsamic vinegar which was a very good idea! The sauce was thick, but I just let it simmer a little longer to let the blueberry color really set in (it was really brown).  I also had never fired up and cooked on a grill before, so that was really exciting. However, I think maybe I didn't brush enough oil onto the steaks because it was sticking to the grill. Oh well! My salmon turned out wonderful and moist and flaky. I tried it with some of the blueberry sauce warm, and while it was very tasty, if it cooled too much and got thick the combination of textures was just kind of odd. So I would say to eat this dish hot.   I didn't give this a full 5 stars because while I appreciated all the ingredients in it and its uniqueness, it wasn't anything super exciting I would go out telling everyone to try.

This was something very fun and different to try with salmon.  I took special care to reduce the sauce to the proper consistency and allow the vinegar to mellow and let the blueberries come through--which they did.  Though the sauce was delicious and I would definitely try it again, it did seem to be lacking a bit of body.  The flavor pops on the top of the palate, but then dissipates pretty quickly with little to savor... not sure how to remedy that but it is a problem I wouldn't mind solving. Served with grilled zucchini and corn on the cob and homemade baking powder biscuits.  The roommates loved the sauce on the biscuits as well.

This is delicious if you make the following changes in preparation: Saute a couple of shallots in olive oil and then add a little garlic for a minute longer. Then de-glaze the pan with a little of the balsamic vinegar. Add remaining ingredients including whole blueberries and simmer for 1-2 hours or until reduced and thick. The sauce is almost better on pork tenderloin but the salmon is good too.

Amazing!  I tend to stick to my own marinade for salmon and have never found anything that measures up.  Well, here it is.  The hearty sauce complements the strong texture of the salmon well.  I couldn't get enough!  Followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for a great alternative recipe for salmon!

I LOVED this and I don't even like salmon that much. I served it with steamed broccoli. I poured the blueberry sauce over the fish AND the broccoli. I didn't have to use butter/oil, etc. to season the broccoli. A very healthy dinner!

My husband and I thought this recipe was delicious.  I made the sauce according to the directions, the only thing I changed was the balsamic vinegar.  I didn't have any and I substituted the exact amount of red wine vinegar.  I served it with rice and some vegetables.

Tasty. But I think I'll reduce the vinegar by half next time or maybe substitute some red wine for it. I also added about a tablespoon of sugar to sweeten it just a little more. It looks gorgeous when drizzled over the fish.

Splendid dinner.  I used a little less than 1/8th cup of Balsamic Vinegar for the 4 serving recipe, instead of the whole 1/4 cup.  This kept the sauce from being overpowering.  One could still taste the salmon as well as the orange juice, vinegar and a hint of chicken stock.  I would recommend anyone who tries this for the first time to go easy on the Vinegar as it is a very strong flavor.

Very Nice, easy prep and tastes great. I used fillets instead of steaks, the sauce went a lot further than I had anticipated.

This was very good. I did cook the balsamic vinegar, 1/2 cup of chicken stock, orange juice and honey for about 10-13 min. before adding the remaining chicken stock and cornstarch mixture( cold stock). If you don't cook this down the sauce will have a very strong vinegar taste. I decreased the chives to 1tsp. and added a heaping tsp. of brown sugar when I added the cornstarch. I simmered the sauce with the blueberries for about 5 min. and it was wonderful!

I prepared this dish exactly as the instructions set out, and found that it the flavour of vinegar was overwhelming. I had to add several cups of brown sugar to dilute it. Some other reviews suggest reducing the vinegar before serving. It would have helped salvage this dish. Entirely, not terrible, but I don't think I'll try it again. The salmon was grilled perfectly, but I'll take the credit for that. I suggest if you do try this one, serve the sauce on the side.

Wonderful blueberry sauce that is delightful on many meats. I paired it with steamed cod (simply steamed with butter, salt and pepper).  I reduced the balsamic vinegar to a splash or so and used maple syrup instead of sugar.

A very nice change for salmon.  I added 1/2 jar of blueberry all fruit preserves to thicken the sauce up and to soften the vinegar/orange taste.  The sauce seems to mature a little in the refrigerator so you might want to make it ahead of time then warm it up before serving.

 I poured the left over sauce over pork chops and brown rice the following evening and got raving reviews from the family.

Interesting combination.  I love both but I am still undecided on the recipe.  I added some lemon juice for a bit of tang.  My boyfriend (who picked this recipe out) loved it.

Easy to do and surprisingly berry good with the blueberry sauce. I used salmon steaks, so time on the grill at medium high was 8-10 min per side. It's a Keeper.

Really good. Reducing the vinegar is a must, added a tbsp of butter at the end. My husband said it was "really good", while admitting that he didn't think that blueberries and salmon would be good together. But I, like other reviewers, really enjoyed the combo of the blueberries and orange juice with the chicken stock and balsamic vinegar (plus that little pat of butter and some honey), really good. Definitely would eat this sauce with other meats as well. Thanks for the recipe!

This was delightful and not too complicated.  I baked the salmon instead of grilling, and I seasoned it with oregano, thyme, lemon juice, and a sprinkling of ginger.  For the balsamic, I used an orange vanilla variety from a gourmet shop, and it added a lovely flavor.  This recipe is a keeper.

I came across this while looking for a recipe to use up some leftover blueberries.  It didn't come out like I expected.  The sauce was too acidic for us.  I ended up pureeing it with some honey.  I used it for 2 meals.  It was better the time I brushed it on the fish and broiled rather than serving over cooked fish.

I followed this recipe exactly as described and it was great.  My husband loved it.  We used blueberries that we picked ourselves over the summer and stored in the freezer for about 6 months.   I will definitely cook this recipe again and again.

This was absolutely delicious!  I added honey, lemon and lemon pepper seasoning to the salmon before grilling them in the oven.  I also added a little more honey to the sauce for fear of the balsamic vinegar overpowering everything.  I actually mashed a few of the blueberries in the sauce as soon as I poured them in as well.  It was perfect!  In the top five of my favorite recipes.

This is an absolutely fantastic combination for people who like a sweet/tart/savory combination of flavours.   When I made this I took special care to reduce the sauce until it was thicker than the recipe calls for and was very happy.  Highly recommend using a quality piece of sockeye or coho, as the richness and flavour of those two really come out with the blueberries.

Made a couple changes due to lack of exact ingredients.  Exchanged cranberry juice for orange and maple syrup for honey.  Brushed a bit of sauce on the salmon while grilling.  Quite good.  Kids and husband were pleased.  Seved with basmati rice and steamed veggies.

I made this recipe last night and thought it was just "okay". I don't think I'll make it again. For the person who said you can't add thickening agents to hot foods, you are correct, and that is WHY this recipe clearly requested that you mix the corn starch with 1/4 cup of chicken stock that had not yet been heated and then combine it with your hot liquid. Simple.

I was happy to find this recipe since I was thinking about trying to make something with both salmon and blueberries. I followed the recipe except substituted chopped green onions for the chives. I felt the sauce complimented the salmon very nicely and was glad I decided to use the green onions in leu of not having chives, for it also gives the recipe that extra "something". I prepared this meal for another couple who told me they did not ever think that salmon would go so well with blueberries.
I think that when making this recipe it is important to have quality blueberries and salmon and to make sure you do not overcook the salmon.

Following everyone's suggestions, I used only 2 tbsp balsamic. At that amount, I thought it balanced the blueberries fine. Overall, the taste was unusual, which I appreciated, but still not necessarily something I would want to make again.

What a treat on wild Oregon salmon.  My husband (who caught the fish) turned up his nose when I explained the sauce.  He ate it up when I served it.  It is delicate and not too sweet.

I found this recipe quite good indeed. I would probably reduce the amount of balsamic vinegar next time I cook it. 
But overall, it is very nice!

A little too sweet for my palate, but I would try again and alter the recipe a little.

Loved it, it was still a bit tart for us, so i added a little more honey and a bit of orange marmalade.

Love salmon, love blueberries, but we didn't love them together. This was a complete miss for us but I'm glad we tried it. Sorry for the not so good review.

The sauce was not good at all!!  the chix stock made the berries taste super salty. and the balsamic was overpowering! I ended up just slicing the berries with water & honey & heating it up..  MUCH better!

This recipe surprised me.  I really liked the sauce, and I usually don't like fruit based sauces.  It had just enough tang to balance the sweetness and the honey did't overpower the taste of the blueberries.  We had wild rice and chard with goat cheese and the combo was really fantastic.  Even my husband enjoyed it and he isn't a salmon fan!

this recipe won me a lot of compliments.  just drizzled olive oil and peppered the salmon steaks (6 oz was good size).  my guests were surprised at how well the blueberry sauce complemented the fish.  served with roasted red potates and roasted asparagus/cherry tomatoes.  whole thing took 20 minutes.  I was psyched.  Definitely making this one again!

Excellent recipe, a very unique collection of flavors, based on some other reviews, I decided to cook off some of the Balsamic, it still was a little strong.  I think the next time around I will reduce the amount some.  Great dish, and will be a nice suprise during service.

This was horrible and I followed it to the letter.   I said ok, lets try something new because we are adventureous eaters.  The balsamic vinegar overpowered the blueberries which I could not taste.  I used good aged expensive balsamic vinegar too.  This was tasteless otherwise.  Save your money.

I was disappointed in this recipe as I felt the blueberry sauce (although visually interesting) did nothing to enhance the flavour of the salmon.

My family loved this. I made fresh string beans and put the sauce on both the salmon and the beans. Very good and healthy too!

The only reason why I did not rate this lower was because I did enjoy the color of the blueberries with the salmon.  The taste was just "ok" - there are better, easier, and cheaper things to do with salmon that are 5-star quality.
