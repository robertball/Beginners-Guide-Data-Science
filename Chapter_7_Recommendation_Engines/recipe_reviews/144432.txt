My family was not too happy about trying something new and they LOVED this at Thanksgiving.   This was the first of the "leftovers" to dissappear, and that's a first!

I thought this recipe sounded good because I always like to try new things but the flavors did not really go well together. Out of 12 people only one person enjoyed this dish.

I did not care for this recipe ,I always do the traditional green bean, but this sounded good, the sour cream made it running and the ginger was weird, everyone said please bring the other one next year. Sorry
