Very light, VERY crisp -- turned out almost more like a savoury cracker, not that there's anything wrong with that. Nice consistency and satisfying taste; excellent tea cookie. Suggest making them rather smaller than indicated and spacing them out fairly far on the sheet.

This recipe did not work for me. The consistency was so thin--I think the measurements are wrong.  It was like a puffy pistachio omelet.

Very frustrating. Soup is right. But I stayed positive. I tried smaller cookies and reducing time. Still woudln't come off of bak. sheet great. Tried sprinkling flour on sheet hoping the batter would stay more put. Not. Then I tried reducing time and then wrapping around wooden spoon to make more attractive. Uggh. I thought they had no taste at all, waste of 7 eggs to make 1 cup of egg white, and what a waste of pistachios at the price of those. If you like a challenge go for it.
