This was Very Good! My daughter LOVED it! 
I made the following changes/additions:  
1) I used Crushed Pineapple, instead of Sliced Pineapple (I didn't want large chunks of pineapple in it)  
2) I added 1 tsp of Cayenne Pepper to give it a little kick (we like spicy food)
3) I added chopped Green and Red Pepper and Onion, and sauteed them before adding them.  
I served the Chicken over White Rice, and it was Very flavorful.  The Sweetness of the Honey Barbeque contrasted nicely with the tartness of the pineapple and the spiciness of the Cayenne Pepper. I will definitely make this again!

What type of side could be paired with this? I'd like to keep the Hawaiian theme.

This was a fantastic dish. It didn't specify if you should use the juice from the can of pineapple or not, I did put some of it in the crock and it made for a very good sauce for the rice.

Yummy just as written.

I made it without the soy sauce due to dietary restrictions, but it was still amazing! I would definitely save the sauce to keep the chicken moist when reheating, but overall, the taste was fantastic.

Easy to prepare. Served over a bed of rice. This dish was delicious. Going to try mandarin oranges instead of pineapple next time, just to mix it up.

This was amazing. I went with one of the reviews that added cayenne pepper, red peppers, green peppers and onion. I served it over brown rice. I'll definitely make this again.

Another keeper.  Thank you SammiB. The first time I made this as written and it was very tasty.  I tried it again this time adding onion, bell pepper and little bit of garlic powder.  It was served over rice, as suggested by another reviewer, with garlic, bacon fresh green beans and Hawaiian rolls for the sauce.

I just made this last night with a few changes made by my personal preferences and I got a whole lot of " that's hella good" and "wow can you make some more" I Followed the recipe but i used my own bbq sauce that my man bought, brown sugar and slightly spicy flavored, added white onion and a drizzle of honey to the crock pot. Also I cooked on Low for 4 hours! Chicken was melt in your mouth delicious and omg that flavor was freaking amazing. so good i didn't have any left to bring to work for lunch, super bummed about that. I think I will make kabobs with this exact recipe next time!!!! Mmmmmmm

This was a big winner at our dinner table.  The only change I made due to the fact that it was all I had on hand was crushed pineapple instead of slices.  I also went ahead and added the juice from the can.  This is a very sweet dish but served with white rice, it was perfect.  I will be making this again very soon as requested by my family.

Tastes like chicken with bbq sauce watered down with pineapple. Flavors I usually enjoy, but ended up throwing it out.

Very nice slow cooker chicken recipe. Next time I will use pineapple slices in juice or syrup. If I can find them. I added cornstarch at the end to thicken the gravy. 
I said to my husband, this chicken would be good shredded and served on a Kings Hawaiin Sweet Roll with a little bit of cole slaw on top.

Made this last night for dinner and it was great.  There are very few recipes that are this simple to make and taste this yummy!  I only made 1 slight change...I poured in some of the pineapple juice (1/2 can) when adding the pineapple rings.  Delicious!

This was very good. I made a few changes. For the barbecue sauce I used half Honey and half Spicey Sweet. I also added carrots and onions after it had been cooking for 2 1/2 hours. The sauce is wonderful and works great on rice. I used brown rice since that was what I had on hand. This recipe will be made again.

So simple and so tasty! My kids are finicky and I was concerned that they might not like it. They asked for more!
I put the breast on a bed of white rice and drizzled some of the extra sauce over it. Served with a side of peas cooked in garlic butter and decided that I'll be making this many times more in the future. I had to substitute brown sugar BBQ sauce, but it turned out great!

We liked this a lot. Used chicken tenders  because I didn't have enough time for breasts to cook. Added onions, peppers and garlic on the advice of other reviewers and served over white rice. The leftovers are already claimed.

I wish I could give it a 10!  In fact I actually only had 2 bottles of Sweet Baby Ray's but I did have a package of sloppy joe sauce and added it as well along with mandarin oranges and 2 large cans of pineapple.

I used 2 chicken breasts on Low for 2.5 hours. I cannot imagine how this doesn't dry out if you cook it on High for as long as suggested! I added sliced onions, dried minced onions, as well as garlic powder to add more flavor. I think without it the taste would be overpowered by pineapple.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and found it to be very soupy and the sauce was loose.  I had to get more barbecuse sauce and throw the chicken on the grill.  Otherwise I would have had to throw it away.

This is cooking now. It was so simple I love it. I used a small can of crushed pineapple  with juice cuz that's what I had and I peppered the chicken well. I think next time I make it I will add a little brown sugar and  will add diced onion, red and green  bell pepers and a little crushed garlic.  I am going to serve this over rice . Can't  wait to try it. ?^?^?

Easy recipe! I used about 4.25 lbs of chicken breast,  20 oz can of crushed pineapple and large bottle of store brand honey barbecue sauce and used low sodium soy sauce.  Cooked on high for 4 hrs and 10 minutes, served it with white rice and streamed broccoli.  Absolutely delicious!

wow.  it was sooo good.  I think the key is to have a great bbq sauce.  I make my own and I make mine sweet.  for this recipe I added honey to my bbq sauce.  I did some cayenne as well for spice, but it's not need for flavor.  I added the whole can of  pineapple chunks and all the juice.  the meat was sooo juicy and not dry.  my bbq sauce is sweet as I use a lot of brown sugar, that's how we like it, it's also thinner and not thick so my sauce with the chicken and pineapple was thinning but still coated it very nicely.  I saved the sauce and chicken for leftovers.  again use a bbq you love, I recommend sweet but that my own opinion.  adding brown sugar to the mix would also be a great option.  in no way did I think the pineapple took over, I think it added the perfect touch and not over powering.

This was terrible. Dry flavorless chicken, completely bitter pineapple. Not sweet at all. Followed recipe and suggestion to add a bit of cayenne. Even added the pineapple juice because I like sweet. All ingredients I love so I had high hopes for this. Smelled amazing, tasted awful.

I thought it was to sweet. I put it over white rice with Broccoli on the side. Sorry,  but not a winner for me or my family.  May try it again with a different BBQ Sauce.  Traditional or even a Smoky Style.

Very moist and flavorful! Chicken was really tender. I like the sweet but it would probably be good also using different bbq sauces for different flavors. About any would go well I believe

judging  from the way this smells, I can already tell it's going to be as good as it looks. I used cut up leg quarter pieces instead of chicken breasts. also tweeted with a little ground cayenne pepper and cumin (to keep the blood sugar down). made some baked panko green beans with Jasmine rice & parsley....Never seen my 2 yr old son so contempt, and hes ASD-level picky lol!

I made this recipe as indicated but used Sweet Baby Rays Hawaiian Barbecue Sauce and pineapple tidbits, and I loved pineapple in every bite. The chicken was so tender, you could almost shred it and put it on a bun. Hubbs loved it.

This was better for than “good”, but not quite “great” - but I admit much of the reduced score probably is because of changes I made.  I started with frozen chicken breasts, and cooked on low for about 5 hours, and the chicken was more than done by then; I can’t imagine what 4 hours on high would be like.  I used mostly a honey and fig barbecue sauce, with some of my homemade to make the full amount called for, and used frozen pineapple chunks, because that is what I had.  My adult son thought this tasted great, but I think the extra flavor from some pineapple juice (as in from canned pineapple) would add a nice touch.  I shredded the chicken and served over rice - I felt there wasn’t enough sauce (even though I only used 2 large Costco-sized chicken breasts); next time I will double the sauce.  I thank you for a very good starting point!

We were not fans of this dish.  Followed the recipe exactly, served over rice.  Edible, but barely...   I did salvage the chicken the following day and made a BBQ chicken pizza with it- that tasted okay.

I made it according to recipe. I liked it but surprisingly my 10 year old didn’t. I will be making again for myself tho I feel it needs something else, maybe green bell pepper? Overall a good recipe for the simplicity and ease and flavor.

I used crushed pineapple and I had a little terriyaki marinade left and I threw that in along with the barbecue sauce. It was delicious! I also just guessed at 3lbs of boneless skinless chicken tenders. That worked great for my family.

It was awesome. The only thing different was added a little brown sugar and took the pineapple slices and cut them up smaller. Plus I only put about half can of pineapple juice because it didn't say whether to use the juice or not I didn't want to make it to liquidy.

Sitting for a couple of hours in a slow cooker didn't help to marinate the chicken. It came out pretty dry.

I won't be making this again.  The chicken seemed dry and the flavor was bland.

I made it per the recipe but with one change....i sliced up a fresh pineapple. Served it over white jasmine rice (with chuncks of fresh garlic) The family loved it....will make again with a few possible changes.

This was okay.  I used pineapple chunks instead of pineapple rings and served it over rice.

It was just OK. Cooking chicken breast that long made it dry.  If I make it again, will use boneless thighs for a moister chicken.
