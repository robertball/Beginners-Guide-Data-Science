I made this using 1 1/2 cooked chicken breasts I had left over. I used frozen corn beans and peas. (a great way to use up those partial bags of frozen veggies) I don't buy canned carrots so I used 3 fresh carrots diced and sauteed with the onion. (some diced celery would be a good addition to this too - next time) The method is fine as written or you can make the sauce and add everything to the sauce pan stir it up and then into the pie shell. Thanks!

better to use fresh carrots and green beans just steamed in the microwave also add sauteed 1 onion diced with 1/2 c. celery and some mushrooms.

This was fantastic! I made the following changes and it was excellent though I'm sure it would've been good anyway. First I used fresh green beans and carrots and frozen corn instead of canned and added chopped celery and minced garlic. Also I prebaked the bottom crust about 5 minutes to make sure it would cook thoroughly and not get too soggy. Finally I just cooked everything in one pot before pouring it into the crust instead of adding the chicken and veggies to the crust and then pouring the liquid over them. I disagree with another reviewer about it being dry; it could've been because of my slight changes but my husband and I thought the amount of gravy was perfect!

I made 4 individual potpies. It was delicious but a little too dry for our taste. Next time I will up the gravy.

I will definitely make this again! Instead of using green beans I used frozen peas that were fried with raw carrots instead of canned carrots. Even more delicious!

I made this the first time and it was lacking that little something and realized it was a bit of thyme and a whisper of sage. Made it again and added those two spices and what a difference! It's now my go-to recipe for chicken pot pies! Thank you AR.com

Great recipe!!   We augmented by adding one diced potato, 1/2 can of early peas, and an additional 1/2 can of creamed corn.  Scrumptious!!

This was great! A good base recipe you can adjust to your taste. We’re thinking next time we’ll add some mushrooms and cheese as well.

I wanted to make this with my first try at a homemade pie crust using my new Kitchen aid mixer. This was delicious and very easy to make! What I like most about this recipe is that it includes ingredients that most of us have on hand but is still a special dish that almost everyone loves. I will definitely add this recipe to my regular rotation.

Very good comfort food! I used fresh carrots and saluted with onion and used frozen corn instead of canned but stayedvtruw otherwise.
