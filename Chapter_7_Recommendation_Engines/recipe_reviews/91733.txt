I chopped the coconut in a food processor for a nice fine texture. Then I trimmed the crusts from 3 slices of cheap white bread, to make the bread crumbs in the processor. Omitted the nuts and mini chips, so these would taste like a Mounds Candy Bar. Guess what? These are BETTER! The fine texture of the coconut was better, and they were much moister...just wonderful! I tried these a second time, with a whole almond on top, and coated with milk chocolate [for an Almond Joy bar]. Not quite as good as the semi-sweet chocolate. One 12 oz. bag of chips is more than enough to coat them. Oh, and I used a small server [cookie scoop, available at Walmart] to form these and it worked great...made 38. I wish I could give them 10 stars...they are fabulous!

When I was a kid, our next door neighbors, an elderly couple, spent every winter in Florida.  When they came back every April, they brought us a box of wonderful chocolate-covered coconut patties that I pretty much ate all by myself, since nobody else in my family liked coconut.  When I saw these, I had to try them.  They were great and really similar to those I remember.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these and left out the bread crumbs, and used almonds instead of pecans. They suited my taste this way and came out very good.

My aunt from Florida always mare these.  I loved them.  I left out the bread crumbs and nuts.  For half of the batch I added some cherries from the jar.  I patted them down that way they wouldn't be juicy.  This year I'm going to put pineapple with the coconut.  Fun recipe.  Good Luck
