And again I'm rating another chicken salad recipe.  What can I say...you've found my weak spot.  Watch out on the sweet and sour sauce..some brands are pretty sweet.  Cut back if you feel necessary.  I love serving mine over shredded cabbage and carrots.  (pre-mixed of course).  I could eat this stuff every day.  Thanks JLWS.
