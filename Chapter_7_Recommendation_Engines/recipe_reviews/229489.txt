The novelty of this recipe caught my eye and when we found ourselves w/leftover pizza, I decided to give this a whirl and give it a "face".  I must preface this review by stressing our pizza was supreme pizza from a local pizzeria and was very flavorful, so plain cheese pizza would not have the same outcome.  I followed the recipe to a "T", with the exception of skipping the onion since it was already on the pizza and using an 8X11 pan, as I don't own a 9X9.  It was good, VERY rich (cheesy/buttery/greasy), but good.  While I can't see myself making this again for the two of us, I could see making it if we had a party w/overnight guests w/whom we'd enjoyed some late night pizza for breakfast the next morning.  THANKS for the recipe, Prov31woman!

So I used a chicken cordon blue pizza as the leftover pizza, it was amazing. Used cheddar cheese as that is what I had in the house. It was a bit greasy so I think the next time I will cut back on the butter. I normally don't eat leftovers but this might make me rethink recreating them.

So halve the cheese, skip the butter altogether, and use 'egg beaters' or 2 eggs, 2 egg whites if you're concerned about the fat and calories...still great taste and loads less fat! Great recipe, thanks.

I have yet to rate a recipe from this site, but over the years I have tried hundreds of 5-star worthy recipes from this site. I know this one is a winner because I have been doing this for years with leftover pizza. I thought that I was just being weird with leftovers so I never thought to share it with anyone. The only thing I don't do is add butter, it is fine without the extra fat and calories, especially since pizza alone has enough of both. Switch it up with whatever pizza and cheese you have on hand as other have posted- it will be great every time!

I was stuck with leftovers pizza and wanted to use it. I found this recipe and went to cooking mode right away.  I did not have 45 minutes to bake.  I greased a non stick pan, just in case. I cut the pizza to arrange in my round pan instead of a squared pan. It was easy crisscrossing the triangles. 
 I followed the recipe and pour all my ingredients on top of the pizza. I cooked on my stove top on low until the eggs were set, then to oven for a bit more firm setting of eggs and finished with a quick broil.  
It came out looking great and it was so good. I omitted the butter that recipe calls to add to mixture.  It was not greasy at all. I transferred to round plate and sliced with pizza cutter.  It was a hit!!!  
Thank you for sharing.

What a clever use for leftover pizza. I ordered one for dinner last night just so I could try this recipe. Mine had mushrooms and green pepper and it resulted in a most flavorful, delicious strata - like breakfast casserole! Thank you for a wonderful recipe. I'm looking forward to making it again and again with different pizza toppings.

I had slices from 2 left over pizzas, veggie and pepperoni, and I used both of them. I cut the crusts off and lined the edges of the pan first, then cut up the remaining pieces and filled the center. It made a nice crust to the casserole. Thank you for thinking outside the "pizza" box". I'll make this again.

I just made this for dinner and ate it. My father who is as picky as my two daughter said it was really good- in dad language that means awesome.  I did have to sub a few things- I only had 1.5 pieces of pizza so to make it 3 pieces I added 2 slices of wheat bread. Cut up a few slices of pepperoni I had for sandwich meat and added 1/4 cup of pizza sauce. I figured that equaled 3 slices. 
I omitted the butter since pepperoni has enough grease. 
I love cheese so added Parmesan and Swiss to the mixture and on top. 
I used Pizza Hut pepperoni pizza. 
Lastly I baked it in a 9" pie dish. 
The only thing I do wish I would have done was saut√© the onions prior, but next time.  But it was fantastic.  I can't wait to have pizza leftovers again.

I've made this a few times now.  The 1st time I left out a few ingredients because I made this on shopping day and was out of some things.  The 2nd time I made it almost exactly as written (leaving out the onions and some seasoning because I used a supreme pizza that already had those things.)  And this 3rd time, was the best because now I know what I like and don't like.  I use the 3 slices of pizza (supreme, crusts cut off) on the bottom of an 8x8 pan sprayed with butter flavored spray.  I mix the eggs with some salt and pepper (I skip the milk completely, just because I like it better without, the milk will make it more fluffy, but I'm not a fan) then I use whatever cheese I have on hand (today was shredded mozzarella and cheddar.)  On top of it all, I layered thin sliced potatoes, a little salt and pepper over the top.  And bake at 350 for 40 minutes, remove the foil, add a little Parmesan and bake uncovered for another 20 minutes to a half hour until the potatoes crisp up.  I love that this is so easy to adjust to whatever I have on hand.  Now whenever we order pizza, I bag up the leftovers and toss them in the freezer for a lazy Sunday when I want to whip this up.

This recipe was a great way to get my daughter to eat breakfast!  We just used the local $5 pepperoni pizza and it turned out alright, but I'd bet it would taste even better with a high quality pizza.  I would maybe cut out some of the butter, but overall my family really liked it.

5 27 16 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/229489/leftover-pizza-breakfast-casserole/ ... Oh, wow!  'Tried this for Christmas 2014.  'Had leftover yuck-$5 pizza & thought it wouldn't be much money wasted if it wasn't good - & then, the dog would be happy to help out; BUT ... what a surprise!  It's good!  'Sure with better pizza, it would be better (better sauce mainly); but even with only-okay-the-first-day pizza, it was good.  I think that 8 ounces of cheese is supposed to be one cup though.  I used almost all of the 8 ounces & it was quite cheesy.  With better pizza, it might not have been too much.  'Just a thought.  I didn't add the onion, since it got used up in the cornbread dressing, so added 1/4t onion powder.  Added 1/4t granulated garlic (laziness).  Since it was cheapo pizza (did I mention that?!?  :D), I added 2T melted butter.  'Didn't need it.  I oiled, not sprayed the pan.  (I'm not into scrubbing cooked-on eggs.)  I assembled this the night before & I'd recommend that.  If ya didn't, I think the crust would be a problem.  Mine was hard so it softened up overnight.  :)

Great way to use leftover pizza! What I love most, is, this does not require you to assemble this the night before! Works just as well made the morning of.  Like others, I left out the butter and the pepper flakes (taste preference). I have a husband with a large appetite, so I make this in a 9 x 13 in pan., double the eggs and the oregano and increase the milk by half. Turns out delish!

I saw this and had to try it.  Very simple and what a great idea for left over pizza.  I agree with others, I would skip butter all together and all the extra cheese is not needed.  I will definitely make this again.

Y'all,  I call this planning ahead. I always pull 2-3 slices of pie to the side so I can plan this yumminess for the next morning. Super quick, easy and is different each time depending on your pizza toppings. Cut pizza in to bite sizes pieces the night ahead to save time. Whip it up, dump in your baking dish and ...TaDa! Easy way to get the whole family to the breakfast table.

I used half a cup of milk and mozzarella, no red pepper, garlic or onion, sausage and onion pizza and baked uncovered for 35 minutes. My husband gave this a 10, we ate it all yesterday and I'm making a smaller one today with the last of the pizza! Delicious!

I made this with that pizza that has the little cheese bites baked into the crust and OMG was it ever good. Instead of arranging the pizza, I just cut into squares and mixed with the eggs milk etc.  I admit I order pizza more often thinking about making this with the leftovers. ??

I had unexpected guests, leftover pizza and didn't want to spend all morning in the kitchen fixing breakfast.  This was a complete hit, thank you.

I didn't have high expectations but this was really good. It's certainly better than throwing out leftovers. Thanks

Definitely don't need the butter.  I wish it was stated in the directions that this can be made the night before, rather  then just in the chef's intro.

Much better than anticipated. Obviously this recipe will vary greatly with the type of pizza, but overall very nice way to enjoy left over pizza for breakfast. I've made this several times and I've found that pizza with less sauce and thicker crust works best. I do add an extra egg as it seems it needed a bit more to moisten and incorporate all of the crust. Again, great recipe that I've used several time. Thank you for contributing.

This was a fun recipe and came out so wonderful. I only  had the plain pepperoni "$5 pizza" that turns to cardboard. So really, this was the best that pizza has ever tasted. Since it was a plain pepperoni, I did add some green pepper with the onion. I didn't use any butter at all. This is a great recipe to keep handy and can be changed up if you choose.

It was delicious!  I stumbled across this & we had exactly 3 pieces of left over pizza from last night.  The only thing different I would do would be to omit the salt.  It was a little too salty for me.  I will definitely make this again!

Used pizza hut pepperoni pizza and casserole came out too cheesy. Next time I'll add some pizza sauce on the bottom. My son loved it, but my grandson and I thought the cheese taste was overwhelming.

Ok again, super weird idea, but SOOOOO GOOD!  My fiancee is still raving!  I have made stratta for years, but never thought to use leftover pizza, in place of bread and cheese...I love that you did, and that I am crazy enough to try anything once!! I will be making this again and again!  (More toppings on the pizza the better! :-)

Loved the uniqueness, ease and flavor of this recipe.  Followed it exactly as written and used a combo pizza.  Served it to guests for brunch and they loved it. They asked for the recipe and were excited to try it out with their teen age boys.    Can't wait to try it with different types of pizza with pesto, etc.

Yum yum give me more Mum.  That's what I heard yesterday morning.  Awesome recipe.  We used our leftover Papa Murphy's pizza and it turned out great.  We actually wanted more! Thanks for sharing! :-)

This turned out just awesome! Had left over Benny's pizza and followed the recipe as written.  Made for a very very tasty breakfast.  Will try this again after pizza night.

We order pizza every Friday and usually have 3 pieces of pizza leftover and I always put it in the fridge. Most weeks I end up throwing them away (not that we don't like leftover pizza, we just usually forget.) So when I saw this recipe I knew I had to give it a try. Loved how it came out! We normally order an everything on it pizza, but the dish would work with nearly any pizza combination you could think of.

We tried this mostly because we always fight to see who gets to eat the last pcs. of cold pizza for a quick breakfast.(We get 2 pizzas for dinners & leave a half.)  Made it the night before to keep smackers away. (Our teens have a habit of midnight eating. but I wanted to try this.)  Fantastic.  And if Red Barren can make a frozen breakfast pizza I'd try freezing portions of any leftovers(HA!).  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is awesome if what you're looking for is comfort, taste, and a heart attack in a pan!
