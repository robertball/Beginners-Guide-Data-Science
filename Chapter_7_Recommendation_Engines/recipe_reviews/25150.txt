With a few changes, this recipe was a #1 hit with our family.  My 6 yr old had 2 servings, and my 3 yr old had 3 servings!  Here are my changes:  I used 1/2 cup each of brown sugar, soy sauce, and ketchup, 2 cloves garlic, minced, and pepper.  Left out the ginger and salt (soy sauce is salty enough).  Cooked in crock pot on high for about 2 hours, then on low for another 2-3 hours.  The sauce was so good over white rice.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch today!

Great recipe! I took the advice of others: I used 1/4 cup soy sauce and a 1/4 cup honey.  I seasoned the chops with seasoning salt but did not add additional salt or pepper to the sauce. I doubled the sauce recipe and cooked 8 bone in chops.  I sliced up two green peppers and added them to the pot about an hour before it was finished.  I did thicken the sauce with cornstarch. The meat was falling off the bone in about 4 1/2 hours.  It was very tender and moist, the sauce was terrific over white rice.  Definitely a keeper!  I will try this recipe with beef and chicken also.

I started with frozen solid boneless pork chops and started cooking for 4 hours on low.  I used 1/3 c soy sauce and a generous squirt of honey, based on others' comments.  They looked done after 4 hours on low, and I ate one after coming home from work.  The chops were dry, the sauce was thin, but the chops were good with the sauce on them. For my husband, who would be home 1-3 hours later, I added corn starch as others suggested and turned the crock pot to warm. Two hours later, I turned the crock pot off.  When my husband came home, soon after I turned the crock pot off, the pork chops were tender and not dry, the sauce was thickened and he raved about them.  Add enough corn starch and it's almost a barbeque type sauce or like the thick sauce Chinese restaurants sometimes serve.

These were the best pork chops that I have ever had that were not fried. My family and I love fried pork chops but they are not all that healthy for you so I chose to fix them a different way and found this recipe. I used pork with the bone and cut the bone out. I then put monteral steak seasoning on them and browned them to keep them from drying out. I then followed the recipe with adding garlic and honey. We had it over rice. The sauce was so good that next time I am going to double the sauce ingredients so there is plenty to go around. The meat was falling apart and smelled so good. Thank you for sharing the recipe and thank you cooks for the ideas.

I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and used 1/4 cup of soy sauce instead of 1/2 cup.  I added 1/4 cup of honey and cooked in the slow cooker on low for 3 hours.  I served it over white rice and drizzled some of the sauce over the rice.  It was great!

This recipe was amazing! I followed the advice of others and cut down to 1/4 cup of soy sauce. I also added a few squirts of honey. The results were fabulous! Tastes very good with brown rice and broccoli. This recipe is a keeper.

Our family REALLY loved this recipe...well tweaked recipe.  I combined a bunch of people's suggestions and it came out delicious!  Ok here's what I did:
Sauce
1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce
1/4 cup honey
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup ketchup
1TB minced jarred garlic
pepper
Appx.1/2 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup pureed pineapple (sooo yummy)
Some cornstarch to thicken it at the end

All that and then I  cooked 6 of the thick cut Costco porkchops on low for 6 hours.  By the time I got home it had been on warm for about 3.5 hours and was falling apart.  I steamed some broccoli and mixed it in at the end and served over sticky white rice...fabulous!!!

The sauce didnt smell yummy when i first made it but it cooked into some smokey heaven!! yummmmm Thank you so much we'll have this one over and over.

This recipe was easy and delicious. 

having read the reviews I did make some changes, I used fresh ginger, some chilli paste as we like things with a little bit of a kick, used low salt soy sauce, a table spoon of honey and added a cup of water. 

I never had pork as tender as this and the sauce was fantastic, dp gave it his thumbs up and was demanding seconds. Will be making again.

I thought this recipe was simply delicious.  I have just really gotten started on the crock pot kick, ad this was an awesome recipe for my maiden voyage.  I modified the recipe only slightly by mixing some brown-sugar based bottled bbq sauce in with the other ingredients.  I also used country style ribs, instead of chops, and they were so tender, and juicy!  My 3 year old kept asking for more, and husband was pleased that we could sit down to dinner BEFORE 7 pm on a week night, and enjoy such a tasty meal.

This recipe was easy and delicious! The pork was so tender and the sauce was very good. Just a note, I doubled the marinade recipe and used a pork tenderloin stip, this may be the reason why it did not dry out like other reviewers had stated. The recipe is great though. I make it quite a bit.

Tender, moist and delicious! This was super easy and had a nice Asian flair to it - definitely great for a "fix it and forget it" type of meal. I used low sodium soy sauce, added a couple Tbsp. of honey,a couple of splashes of rice wine vinegar and 1/4 tsp. of chili garlic sauce for a little kick. I found that this was done in 4 hours vs. 6 and there's nothing worse than the dreaded "dry pork" so watch your cooking time. I plated it and to pretty it up a bit I topped it with some chopped green onion - very good without a lot of effort.

Ok, for htose of you that didn't like this recipe, I have some suggestions. First, buy really thick boneless chops. At least an inch thick. Second, double the sauce. Third, cut back on the soy sauce and also add some apricot preserves and some honey to sweeten it up. Also if you have a newer crock pot, you only need about 4-5 hours on low to get juicy, tender chops. Lastly,I added cornstarch to the sauce which thickened it up nicely! Serve with brown rice and this meal is to die for!

I followed the advice of many and basically doubled the sauce but instead of doubling the soy sauce, I added honey.  So my ratio was: 1/4 c brown sugar, a couple pinches of ginger, 1/2 c soy, 1/2 c honey, 1/2 c ketchup, 4 tsp Tastefully Simple Garlic Garlic (equiv of 4 cloves), no salt or pepper.  The sauce was really good, big hit with every one.  As for the length of time, I had REALLY thick boneless pork chops (almost 2" thick) and they were just a touch overdone at 4 hours so watch the doneness carefully.  6 hours is way too long.  I'm giving this a 4 because the sauce was great, esp with everyone's suggestions.

This was SOOO good!  It was a huge hit with my kids.  I had at least 12 or more very thin bone-in pork chops left in my freezer that I had gotten from Angel Food Ministries, so I thawed them and trimmed off the bones.  Then I layered them in the crockpot and altered the sauce recipe a bit.  I used 3/4 cup each of brown sugar, soy sauce, and ketchup.  Then I added 1 Tbsp. of minced garlic, 1 tsp. of ginger, 1/2 cup honey, and 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  I set it on low for 6 hours.  Before the last half hour, I removed the pork chops and whisked in 2 Tbsp. of corn starch and let it simmer to thicken up the sauce.  Then I served the chops over brown rice and steamed broccoli and ladled the sauce over everything with a chicken egg roll on the side.  Fabulous!  My kids wanted more and more and more!  If I have sauce left over, I plan to serve it over some chicken breasts with noodles or rice.  That would be so good!  Great recipe...definitely a keeper!

A keeper!! My friend found this recipe here and we read through the reviews together.  I used two oversized chops with bones and two boneless cutlets.  Most of the changes I made came from prior reviews: quickly browned chops on the stove top, 1/4 c lite soy, 1 1/2 tsp chopped garlic, 2 tbsp honey,  1/4 c crushed pineapple (no sugar added), and chicken broth.  Yup, around 1 cup, enough to cover.  I wanted to add moisture and I was rewarded.  You could used veggie broth too.  It didn't add/detract from the flavor of the pork.  The meat was tender, fell off the bone or pulled apart on its own.  My husband swears the kicker to this recipe was the pineapple.   I'm looking forward to leftovers!

We did not like this.  I halved the soy sauce and added honey but  otherwise. Followed the recipe but it cooked on low for 10 hours so ihad added some water because I was worried it might dry out. All I could taste was soy sauce and it was just too salty. Thanks anyway, but we won't be making this again.

These pork chops were absolutely amazing! I only had bone-in pork chops and when i got home from work they were so tender they were falling off the bone! I served it over brown rice because the excess sauce was too good not to use.  Also i followed the advice of others and cut the soy sauce to 1/4 of a cup and used 1/4 cup of maple syrup (because i didn't have any honey).  Since the meat was so tender it was falling apart and i plan on using the rest for a sandwich for tomorrow's lunch.  I will definitely be making this again and will consider using chicken as well!

I really liked the sound of this recipe but modified it slightly before cooking it and enjoyed every bite.  Here is what I modified;
Soy Sauce: reduced to 1/4 cup, Ginger: used fresh ginger cut into thin slices, Cloves: used 3 instead of 2, Beer: I added 12oz. of Sam Adams Octoberfest, Onion: added 1 quartered onion, Apples: added 2 sliced apples, finished it off with two finger pinches of Hawaiian (rock) salt, and 1/2 tsp. of rice vinegar.
I chose to keep the sauce in it's natural consistency but you could add cornstarch to thicken and serve with hot white rice or baked mash potato.  Enjoy!

Winner for everyone in our family! For the sauce, I followed other reviewers and used 1/4 cup soy sauce (gluten free for us) and doubled the brown sugar and ketchup. I ended up adding 1 cup pineapple tidbits in juice and about 1/2 water so the sauce completely covered the chops. I turned the heat up to high the last half hour and added carrot and red bell pepper strips to the sauce. After the veggies got tender, we added 2 TBSPs corn starch at the very end to make the sauce a gravy which we served over rice. It was fabulous with a great sweat and sour vibe. The kids devoured it! Thanks for the recipe - it's going in our regular rotation

I love this recipe! Just mix it up and let it sit all day. My four-year-old son even loves it! I double this recipe and slice the leftovers in strips, put them in a Ziploc bag with the leftover juice and freeze it. It's great for a quick supper over rice.

I use this website almost everyday and have never reviewed a recipe, but this one I had to say something about!  This is one of the best pork recipes I have found.  I have to fight with both my 4 year old and 18 month old to eat their meat.  Tonight they ate seconds and thirds until there wasn't any left.  The only thing I changed was I cut back the soy sauce to 1/4 cup and squeezed a good amount of honey into the sauce.  We all put more sauce over our rice.  This will definitely be in our meal rotation from now on!

Good; definitely adjust the times for your slow cooker.  Newer ones tend to be hotter than older ones, and I was able to cook the chops from frozen (and I mean a block of frozen chops, no less!)  in 4 hours on low.  After about an hour I was able to pry them all apart and place in the sauce, but initially I just put in the pork chops as frozen, then poured the sauce over.  I adjusted the sauce by doubling it, increasing the ketchup to twice as much, and decreasing the soy sauce by half then putting in water to adjust.  The chops came out heavy on the ketchup--next time I'd leave the ketchup amount as called for, but it still was pretty good.  I'd still double the sauce.  I put in corn starch to thicken the gravy about 45 mins before serving the chops, and it worked pretty well.  All in all, pretty basic, good, and tasty along with rice and broccoli.  Thanks for the recipe.

I never realized how much I could like pork chops!  Careful on the time - you cannot just let these sit in the slow cooker all day or they end up too dry.

Very tender! The family loved them! Although I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup ketchup and added a little ginger. Will make again and again.

Instead of messing with flour or cornstarch as thickening agent, I add a tbsp of dry tapioca to my crockpot gravies.  It works well and you can't taste it in the final product.  For 3 c of liquid, I usually add 2 tbsp.

This recipe turned out fine for me.  My only change/addition was the tapioca.

I used what I had on-hand and also tweaked it a bit after reading some reviews. I upped the brown sugar and ketchup to 1/2 cup each, and instead of soy, I used teriyaki sauce (but only 1/4 cup). I added about 1 teaspoon of granulated garlic since I didn't have cloves in the house. Omitted the ginger and salt and just added a few dashes of pepper. It turned out simply amazing, and the entire family (including 2 young picky eaters) loved it! It was definitely a hit here.

This was amazing! Cannot say enough on the wonderful flavor, juiciness and just all around yumminess! I cooked it on low for at least an extra hour so it just kept getting more flavor. I highly recommend this recipe!!!

Very good and a great meal.  However followed others and change receipe by using frozen pork chops, 1/4 ketchup and 1/4 soy sauce and removed brown sugar.   Added spicy garlic red pepper sauce, 8oz sliced pinesapple with juice, and tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken.

ABSOLUTELY DELICOUS  BUT I USED A THINNER PORK CHOP CUT AND MADE MISTAKE OF GOING OUT FOR THE AFTERNOON AND THEY WERE A LITTLE OVERDONE. WOULD SUGGEST YOU WATCH THEM THE FIRST TIME AND SEE HOW LONG YOUR COOKER TAKES. I WILL REDUCE MY COOKING TIME BY 1-2 HOURS. OTHERWISE, VERY TASTY AND STILL VERY TENDER INSIDE...ENJOY!

My husband loved the glaze, as did I. I used only 1/4c soy sauce; a 'loose' 1/4c brown sugar; 1/4c Chipotle Ketchup; dollop of crushed ginger and garlic. I didn't use anything else. No additional salt needed. The sauce turned to a glaze that tasted VERY much like one that PF Chang's has. VERY good. I will use it for lots of other dishes now!

Revisions I made include using only 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup honey rather than brown sugar and adding a 15 1/4 ounce can of crushed pineapple in it's own juice and NO salt. This was after reading the reviews of it being too salty because of 1/2 cup of soy and also that the recipe called for salt. The pineapple breaks down the meat fibers and make them extremely tender. This was mmmmmmmmmmmm good, wonderful! I cooked it on Lo in the crockpot about 7 hours, then took the sauce out and thickened it on the stove before pouring over the chops. They were juicy and tender and got RAVE reviews! Served over rice. It tasted a lot like something you would get in a Chinese Resaurant!

We weren't fans of this.  The pork, on low, was dried out after only 3 hours.  They were thick boneless chops.  I won't rate this any lower because I never ended up serving this with the sauce.  Due to the dryness after 3 hours, I opted to dice the meat up, toss the sauce and will be using it up in soup to add some moisture back to it.  I opted to change the dinner plans to something else instead.

Very tasty.. followed some others advice and doubled the sauce.  Also did brown sugar/honey/ketchup/and soy sauce.  I didn't have any fresh garlic so I sprinkled in some garlic salt and added a cup of water to keep it very moist.  Excellent!

My husband LOVED these pork chops. In fact, he raved about how good they were. I think the sauce tastes more like an asian bbq sauce. I did change it up a bit...1/2 cup each of ketchup, brown sugar & soy sauce. I didn't add ginger (cause I hate ginger)or salt but I did add a couple squirts of honey, freshly ground pepper, extra crushed garlic, chopped up green,red & yellow bell peppers & sliced onions. I also added cornstarch towards the end because the sauce was a bit too thin for me. It was just perfect, cooked the full 6 hrs on low and pork chops were oh so tender. Next time I think I'll add pineapple chunks, yum!

I made the mistake of not reading the reviews before making this "4 star" recipe...so I followed the directions exactly. The result was extremely salty and dry. overcooked. hardly edible. Guess I learned my lesson. always read the reviews FIRST!

I did some changes to this recipe that were previously suggested and made some of my own additions.  It turned out beautifully and will be on my "to make" list when I have company.  I cooked this on low for 4 hours, 15 minutes...it was perfect. The chops were tender (but not so tender that the meat fell off the bones) they were juicy and full of flavour.  Here is what I used.  8 thick bone in pork chops (I brined them overnight...1/4 c salt in water to cover in fridge) rinsed. Sliced one large sweet Spanish onion and covered bottom of oiled slow cooker. Layered chops over the onions. Sauce: 1/2 cup each: ketchup, honey, low salt soya sauce, sweet Thai Chili sauce. 4 cloves garlic minced (or if purchased minced, 1 large table spoon), 1 table spoon minced fresh ginger or jarred. No salt was needed as the soya is still salty.  No pepper added.  I mixed the sauce ingredients in a bowl and warmed it up in the microwave so the honey would mix nicely then poured it over the chops.  There is a lot of juice left over and I strained it and used it as a gravy.  If you take 1/2 cup sweet red pepper jelly and mix with 1/2 cup cranberry sauce or jelly it makes a slightly spicy fabulous condiment to serve with the pork.  I served this with rice and it was a hit. I gave the original recipe 5 stars as it needed some changes and the amount of soya sauce was too much.  it did encourage folks to make adjustments and now we all ended up with changes that make it a good recipe.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe with my own little twist to it. For the salt content I stuck with the 1/4cup soy, did 1/2cup ketchup-honey-& brown sugar, left out ginger, my twist to it was one small chipotle pepper in adobo that I put in my small processor to chop with garlic & soy...mixed with the rest of ingredients & slow cooked for 6hrs. Served with mashed potatoes & corn.

This is a go to when I see pork chops on sale that week at the grocery store. The whole family loves them and I don't have to hear, "I don't like that!" at least for one night. I do make two changes. I do added 2 tbls. of honey and I only use 1/4 cup of the soy sauce. Make sure you use the low setting on your crockpot otherwise they will be dry.

I cooked these lastnight and they came out great and fell right off the bone! My husband doesnt like pork chops very much but had 3 helpings of these. I had to triple the recipe on the sauce cause it didnt make very much. I did add a little water to the bottom of the pot just so it didnt burn. I did leave the ginger out and seasoned the chops with garlic powder and onion powder. but i did fry the chops a little before i put them in the crockpot. But this recipe came out great!!  Will keep using this from now on!!!!!

The family truly enjoys this recipe.  It has become a family favorite.  It works great for skinless chicken breasts as well.  We double the recipe for better coverage.  We also took the advice of others and use 1/4 C Soy & 1/4 C Honey instead of the 1/2 C Soy.

Loved this. It does taste a bit like teriyaki, or chinese fast food boneless ribs. It's so easy, too. I would agree with other reviewers that it should only cook for 4 hours, otherwise would be too dry. I checked it after 4 hours and it was perfect, but just beginning to dry out a little.

Good flavor, I used 1/4 cup soy, honey, brown sugar, & ketchup. Threw in frozen chops, but one note--Use boneless pork chops because they are so tender they fell off the bones when serving & we were fishing for the small bones.

These were pretty good. The only problem i had was that it said to cook for 6 hours on low. They were done after about 4 hours on low.. and everyone wasnt home for dinner until they had been in for the full 6 hours so they were a little dry. Not as moist as I thought they would be. Next time I will plan on them being done after 4 hours. We put them over white rice and had it with vegeatable and cottage cheese. Was pretty good!!

Definitely a 5 star! I did follow recommendations and they turned out amazing. I am not the best cook but these made me look professional. My husband was in shock that I could make something so awesome. However I did cut out the bone which he did not like he likes the bone. I served with mashed potatoes and frozen veggies.

Based on other reviews, I doubled almost everything for extra sauce: 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 tsp ground ginger, 1 1/4 cups soy sauce, 1/2 cup ketchup, 3 cloves crushed garlic and 1/4 cup honey.  I used 4 frozen boneless pork chops, cooked them for 4 1/2 hours, and added cornstarch during the last hour of cooking.  Will be making again!

This is a great & easy week night dinner!
I added extra brown sugar, worchestershire sauce, and some honey bbq sauce. Served it over rice - would've been better if i'd made even more sauce cause it was delicious on the rice. Will make this one again!

Great slow cooker recipe! I'm not a huge fan of pork chops but my family is. We ALL loved this! I did change the recipe a bit by adding a little lemon juice and some sour cream. At the end I broke up the pork and put it over egg noodles and spooned the sauce (which I gravied) over all of it. If you've ever seen the movie Night of the living dead, you would understand when I say the kids ate like zombies! Good stuff!

This is my second review, I upgraded to 5 stars with the following changes:  bone-in chops didn't get tough like the boneless, season and brown the chops under the broiler about 3 minutes on each side before putting into slow cooker, add rice vinegar and honey.  Very tasty!

If I were going to make this again, I would cut the cooking time in half, as well as the soy sauce, and maybe use bbq instead of ketchup.  Maybe add some oj too.  The marinade just overrode the entire taste of the pork, but it could be because the pork was way too dry because it was overcooked.

My family really liked this recipe. Even my picky 13 year old son! I did 
cut back on the soy sauce some.
Thanks for a good recipe!

This was an okay recipe, I liked it, my husband didn't.  I butterflied the pork chops because they were so huge, and they came out kind of dry, even after being cooked in the sauce for 6 hours on low.  I don't think I would butterfly the chops next time, because the thicker parts tasted better than the edges.

I only used 2 pork chops that were extra thick and frozen. I just threw them into the crockpot and as others had suggested only used 1/4 cup soy sauce instead of the 1/2 cup. I also used fresh ginger and chopped up 1/2 an onion. The meat was so soft it just fell apart so I just shredded it up on the sauce and put it over rice. Might add some pepper flakes next time to spice it up a little.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe - I doubled the sauce to make sure I had enough to go on the rice. We like salty and this recipe is on the saltier side due to the soy sauce but it was delicious. I used a pork roast instead of pork chops

I thought this was excellent. As others have said the sauce was outstanding over rice. I did make one significant change. Since I did not have soy sauce in the house, I used Teriyaki sauce. It was still excellent, except that next time I would use less brown sugar to cut down on the sweetness. I also added onions and about 30 minutes before the end I tossed in some green peppers. Both the onion and green pepper added more interest to the rice. Thanks for the recipe.

I gave it 4 stars only because I did not follow exactly as written. I used 2 boneless pork chops as that is all I had. I added a pork loin. I reduced the soy sauce to 1/4 cup and added 1/2 cup teriyaki sauce instead of ketchup. I threw in a green pepper, large dice and chopped ginger instead of ginger powder. Also added a tsp of Asian chili paste for some heat. My husband said it was wonderful. Next time I will add more veggies to make it a stir fry type meal and add cornstarch to the broth that is left and cook it until thick. Definately a keeper!

Turned out a little too dry for me, at 5-1/2 hrs. cook time on low setting.  Next time I'll reduce cook time.  I used the 1/2 c. soy sauce, 1/4 c. honey, & 1/4 bbq sauce combination, & was satisfied with the turn out - just seems to be missing something (?).  Maybe, as someone else suggested, a spicier bbq sauce - open to suggestions.

I was worried how this would turn out after reading the reviews (so many people said it was dry) but I can't pass up a slow cooker recipe when I have all the ingredients in my pantry.  I took the advice of others and doubled the sauce, but not the soy sauce, and added a bit of chicken stock other wise I would not have had enough liquid to cover my pork chops.  I used 4 thick, bone-in pork chops and cooked them on high for alomst 2 hours then on low for 3 hours.  I served it with rice and drizzled the sauce ofver it.  My husband and I thought they turned out pretty good.  I had the leftovers for lunch the next day and thought they were even better then the night before because the flavors really came together.  The down side to the recipe is that you can't just let this cook in your slow cooker all day and leave it, it's almost not worth the work.

This is a terrific recipe.  Even my kids liked it!!!!  It doesn't really need 6 hours of time - 4 1/2 to 5 will do it.  I did cut the soya sauce to 1/3 cup and added a good squeeze of honey.  I also thickened with corn starch at the end.  Serve it with mash potatoes - yummy!  The only negative - there were no leftovers!!!

Love these chops!  Not a big fan of pork in general, but this recipes makes the pork chops melt in your mouth.  You don't even need a knife to cut them, they are so tender.  I have tried 6 hours on low and 4 hours on high and the LOW setting makes them much, much better than high.

I took the advice of cutting down the soy sauce by using 1/4 c. soy and 1/4 c. water.  My family really liked the flavor but six hours in the slow cooker was WAY TOO LONG.  The pork chops were very overcooked.  I will make this again but not cook as long.

This recipe is so delicious and satisfying. My (picky) husband loved it so much he wants to use the sauce as a  marinade for salmon before he smokes it. He called it 'candy pork'. We will be adding this to our regular menu. I added a pinch of jamaican jerk spice and cayenne, we like spicy sweet. When I set the table I left out knives and my husband got up to get the knives after I served him and I said 'oh no, you won't be needing a knife!' He couldn't believe how tender it was.(compared to his recipe!)A stunning success! Thanks!

VERY GOOD!  I used bone-in pork chops and this turned out fall off the bone tender!  I thought it's flavor was similar to Chinese spare ribs.   Hubby loved them, which makes this a "keeper".   I suggest to use thick chops and watch them after 4 hours.   I served with rice.   Thank you KOORBRUS for sharing this VERY GOOD recipe!

I made this using the others advice doubling the sugar and ketchup. I returned home two hours before dinner and was disappointed to find it very dull and the soy very powerful. To rescue the dish I added more sugar along with 11/2 tsp red pepper flakes and 1 tsp Chinese 5 spice. The additions kicked it up enough and 30 minutes before dinner I tossed in some green beans ( any veg would do). I served with chopped peanuts for garnish. I would make it again with these changes.

We loved this recipe! I followed the advice of other users and used 1/4 cup of soy sauce (low sodium). I also added a few squirts of honey and doubled the sauce. I served over jasmine rice and with broccoli. Will definitely make these again. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! I used 1/2 cup each of brown sugar, low sodium soy sauce, and ketchup. I also added a couple squirts of honey. and lemon juice. I cooked it on high for 2 hours, then on low for another 3-4 hours. I added sliced onions and pre-cooked mushrooms in the last hour of cooking. It was delicious! It's a keeper for sure!

Just made it today. 1/2 cup each soy sauce, ketchup and brown sugar. Added a dash of ginger and poured it over 4 boneless pork chops in a 5 qt. crock pot. After 5-5 1/2 hours on low the pork chops were falling apart. Not dry in the least as some other reviews mentioned- maybe their chops weren't covered with the mixture? This was very good with rice and as some others have mentioned would work great with chicken or beef. Thank you for posting!

made this with six thick boneless chops. followed others advice using 1/4 c. soy sauce, 1/2 c. brown sugar, and 1/2 c. ketchup. I also added 1/4 c. honey.I also added mushrooms, green peppers, and onion. I cooked 6 hrs. on low,then added cornstarch to thicken. Family loved it. served sauce over noodles. I loved the taste, but found it to be dry. But it was delicious cut up with sauce all over it.I will definitely make again, but will try with bone-in chops.

This recipe was delicious. I made a few changes to it, though.  Like others, I doubled the sauce.  Instead of brown sugar, I used 1/4 cup of organic aguave -- I did not want it to be too sweet; I used 1 cup of soy sauce, but it was too salty.  Next time I will use only 1/2 cup of LOW SALT soy sauce.  I don't like ginger, so I omitted it altogether.  I doubled the ketchup, but kept the amount of garlic the same (my  husband doesn't like too much garlic).  I cooked it on high for 3 1/2 hours. After 3 hours I removed the boneless pork chops, added approximately 2 tablespoons corn starch to the sauce and whisked it in. Then I added a can of sliced water chestnuts (drained), strips of fresh red and green bell pepper, and frozen broccoli and mixed it in.  I returned the pork to the crock pot, nestled it into the sauce, and cooked it the remaining 1/2 hour.  The flavor was excellent, the pork was tender, and the veggies were al dente.  I served it over brown rice.  My husband said that (with the change in the soy sauce) this recipe is a keeper.  Next time I will try steak instead of pork! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was so delicious and so easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly as stated, and then poured the sauce into a pot and thickened with cornstarch, otherwise it was too runny to use like a gravy. I'm always looking for ways to cook pork chops and have them be tender not tough, and this is one of the best I've found. A new favorite!!!

This recipe is not a five star as written. People have changed the recipe and then rated it a five star. Be aware. I followed the recipe and man oh man the chops turned out so salty we could not eat them. We ended up throwing them out and I didnt add any salt!

I made this incorporating many suggestions from the ratings of others.  I used Worchestershire sauce instead of soy and didn't season at all.  I added a bit of vinegar, water and ketchup about 1 hour before it was done and thickened it with cornstarch.  I also added peppers and onions and served it over rice.  the pork was fork tender and it had a nice flavor from the peppers.  Being a true winner with my oldest and husband, it'll be something I make regularly!

Absolutely amazing! Gah, I am so pleased with this (only thing I didn't do was the ginger), eating it right now :) So flavorful and moist, just as I'd hoped. Thank you!

I did what others suggested and upped the brown sugar and ketchup to 1/2 cup each and added a little less soy sauce to cut the salt. Flavor was really good my only complaint was that they were a little dried out. Could have been the pork chops or coulda been my crock pot. But will definitely try making them again.

I had to sub teriyaki sauce for soy since I never use soy...but it turned out really good!  I did have to add a bit more sugar at the end bc it was a bit bitter but that might have been bc of the change?  (I also used honey instead of brown sugar...until the end)

Delcious!  And even better with fresh chopped cilantro and green onion on top.... mmmmm.  I ommitted the ginger and salt, and used less soy sauce and added 1/4 cup honey.  Served with rice and the Asian Salad recipe from this site.

I thought this was really good.  My husband found it to sweet.  The flavour is really strong so you would want to pair it with rice or something bland.  I would make again.

We love these.  So convenient for a Saturday or Sunday lunch when we're gone all morning and it only takes 4 hours or so in the slow cooker.  I add a tiny bit of liquid smoke, worshestire sauce, and a bit of bottled bbq sauce.  Served over rice is definitely the way to go!

Wonderful recipe! I have made it twice already and the second time I used a little less than 1/2 cup of soy sauce so it wasnt quite as salty and 1/2 cup each of ketchup and brown sugar instead of a 1/4. There was plenty of sauce to put over sides. I had brown rice and broccoli and its a perfect and easy meal!

This was good, but the pork chops came out much too dry. Would make again with a different cut of pork. The sauce was delicious.

Very good.  It took 6 hours for the pork chops to get tender on 3 on high and 3 on low. I took the advice of the other reviews and cut the soy in half with the other half water.  I also added 1 cup chicken broth. At the end I put in corn starch to thicken.  A quick recipe for guests.

These were fantastic...I always struggle with pork chops a bit, so I love that this recipe is so easy- seems hard to screw it up!  I followed others advice and used equal parts ketchup and soy sauce, a little extra garlic and a few tablespoons of honey....then thickened it up at the end with cornstarch.  Yummy over rice and a side of broccolli!

I thought this would be a great dish and followed the recipe exactly. Unfortunately I think I should have followed what other reviewers said and lessened the soy. Otherwise, I think my sauce got much to hot because it just wasn't thick at all and that wasn't good either. Definitely not a bad idea, just need to change it up a little next time, thanks.

This was fabulous- and easy! I used half the soy sauce (too salty), left out the ginger (didn't have any), and added about a tablespoon of honey (sounded good). I did this with 3 thick boneless chops and the full sauce recipe. 3.5 hours on high and they were delicious! I couldn't even lift them with a fork- they just fell apart. We had plenty of sauce to pour over rice. This was a really easy weeknight meal that I'll try again for sure!

I followed the recipe almost exactly (just cut down the soy sauce as most reviewers had recommended) and it just didn't turn out.  I am trying to salvage the pork to turn it into something edible, but the pork is very, very dry.  As for the sauce, it turned black and is very bitter.  I'm thinking that if I had fried the chops, and cooked the sauce on the stove top then maybe we'd be enjoying supper now, but instead, I'm trying to come up with plan B!

AWESOME!!! This by far is the best recipe to use for porkchops in the slow cooker. I doubled the recipe but only used 1/4 cup of Soy Sauce and added a 1/4 cup of honey. I also didn't use the Ketchup and substituted it with BBQ sauce I had on hand. It honestly was amazing and the meat was very tender.

This recipe was very good. I lined my slow cooker and followed the recipe to a T. With the extra juice I added it on top of the rice. It had an oriental taste to it because of the soy sauce. Very good and I will definaltey make this again.

this is terrific! I followed advice of a reviewer-sprinkled with Montreal Steak Seasoning and browned before putting in cooker. Also am glad that I doubled sauce: so good. Thickened  with 1t cornstarch in about 1/4 c cold water. Ate with rice--very very good!!

I have never really felt compelled to rate or review a recipe, but MMMMMMMMM this was good.  After buying a mega pack of pork chops from costco I was getting sick of anything basic made with them, and this was anything but!  I was only cooking for my boyfriend and I so I halved the recipe, and like other reviewers, i halved the soysauce and replaced it with honey and also added garlic (two cloves for me).  I also omitted the ginger cause I was out, but I think it would be tasty with it as well!  This is by far the best way i have ever eaten porkchops, my boyfriend and i loved it!  I served over white rice and "asain medley" frozen vegetables, it was great!!!

Good and tender pork chops, sauce was good. We ate it over some brown rice. The kids weren't huge fans but everyone agreed that it smelled great cooking.

With a few changes, this is a five star recipe! After reading the reviews of a few others, I used 8 bone-in pork chops and doubled the sauce. To keep the chops tender, I browned them in a pan, and then layered the partially cooked meat in the slow cooker, covering each piece with some of the sauce. For the sauce, I cut the soy sauce and ginger amounts in half and added a couple tablespoons of honey. After the pork chops were done (I cooked them for about 8 hours, and they were falling off the bone; so tender!) I removed them from the crockpot and then thickened the sauce in a pan with some cornstarch. My family really enjoyed these. I would probably make these again!

This recipe was very tasty with a few minor changes. I used cavenders seasoning and browned bone-in chops first. I also used about 1/2 cup of ketchup and only 1/4 cup of soy sauce, and added 1 capful of cider vinegar and about 1/4 cup of splenda brown sugar blend instead of regular brown sugar. Very good.  I will definately make this again.

I found this recipe early this morning and its cooking right now. It smells great and the chops are already tender after cooking almost 2 hrs! I had to adjust a little bit tho. I didn't have ginger or honey but I did use pancake syrup. I also added a handful of chopped onions & a splash of apple cider vinegar to the sauce. I did rub some season all to the chops and lightly coated them with seasoned flour to help thicken the sauce during cooking. Instead of a slowcooker, I put them in my dutch oven and cooked them on the stove on high heat to boil, then down to simmer a while. My husband and I sampled a taste and it tastes great! It's hard to get him to say something tastes 'good' and was surprised with his approval! Thanks for this recipe!!

Not very good. My chops came out dry and tough, maybe it was the kind of chops I had but the sauce wasn't very good either. Tasted weird, the flavors of the ingredients did'nt compliment each other.
I don't think anyone in my family liked this. Sorry.

I used bone-in porkchops from Costco, they are a bit thick and it came off the bone-in. I only made 2 pcs. of porkchops and it was enough. My husband wants more!!! I followed the reviews and added a bit of honey and doubled the sauce, I also added white wine instead of chicken broth. Aside from that, I followed everything else in the recipe. I had it set at 6 hours, my husband decided he's too hungry to wait so I had turned it off at 5 hours. I thickened the sauce with rice flour in a small pan and poured it over the porkchops and rice. Wery good. Will make again!!!

YUM! I make this recipe usually once or twice a month to help get in our pork quota. :) I usually serve it with some stir-fried veggies or potatoes. I'm not a fan of ginger except in cookies, so I omit that ingredient. I also use garlic powder (a few good shakes) instead of the garlic cloves. I've done it both with honey and without, and it turns out well either way. I think I prefer it with a little honey but it's nothing to stress out about. I use the cheap pork chops (whatever's on sale!) and they turn out really tender and excellent. Thanks, Will, this is a keeper!

THe only changes I made in this was to use honey instead of brown sugar and I didn't add salt because of the soy sauce.  It was very good and I'll make it again.  Thanks Will.

This recipe was absolutely fantabulous. My fiance and his father both said that these were the best pork chops they had ever had. I used 6 chops, so I increased the recipe slightly to accomodate. Thanks Will!!

I was looking for a pork chop recipe online that I can cook in my slow cooker with the ingredients I have at home.. this was perfect.. I had everything minus the ginger.. so I read the reviews but decides to make the recipe as is but just leaving out the ginger and salt (soy sauce has enough salt in my opinion).. well what can I say, it was super delicious! It wasn't too salty nor too sweet.. it was perfect! Everyone loved it..Will definitely make again!

Very good - as the other reviews said, use half as much soy sauce. I also added some sliced onions. Looking forward to having the leftovers tomorrow on a roll with cole slaw!!

This was wonderful!  I did use low sodium soy sauce and reduced it to 1/4 cup. I had fresh ginger and added about 1-2 tablespoons, otherwise as instructed. I had two large chops and the sauce was the right amount. If I was making more I probably would double the sauce. I thickened the sauce with cornstarch. Instead of honey I used agave since that's what I had.

I think this would have been okay if I had cooked for a shorter amount of time but pork was super dry after cooking the 6 hours on low...if you make this use meat temp not time to decide when it is ready.  However this really defeats the purpose of the slow cooker.  Sigh.  The flavor seemed a lot like pulled pork.

Big hit with our family. I thought (hoped) that we would have a bit left over for a single lunch the other day. Unfortunately it was eaten straight out of the slow cooker with a spoon instead lol. Used the changes of 1/4 cup of soy and honey. Didn't add any extra salt and I also took out the pork chops and thickened the sauce a bit with some cornflour. I will definitely be making this again.

Enjoyed by everyone from 2 to 66!  I prepared the recipe with a few changes, half the soy sauce, no added salt and doubling the sauce recipe with 4 bone-in chops.  I was caught off guard when 3 more people showed up for dinner (total 6 with 4 chops), but this recipe carried me through.  After three cooking hours, I cut up the chops and added a red and green pepper, plus whisked in a bit of cornstarch.  Then back in the crock pot.  As the cooking was finishing up (another hour), I cooked up some brown rice.  When all was done I had a hearty pork, pepper and gravy mixture over rice.  My unexpected company raved and had lots of suggestions of how to embellish the recipe like, adding water chestnuts, broccoli, pea pods and so on.  Everyone loved it and it will become a regular for my family.

Adding honey, halving the soy sauce, frying first.  The soy sauce was too much, but it tasted okay -- my issue was that the pork chops completely dried out and were hardly edible.  Maybe pork doesn't have enough fat for such a long cooking time or this might be worth trying on a larger piece of meat.

I tried this receipe slow cooking baby back ribs.  Unbelievable.  They fell off the bone.  Soooo tender.  I slow cooked them for 6 hours.  I only used 1/4 cup of soy sauce and added 1/4 cup of honey.  Great sauce served over rice.  It is a keeper in my house.

I cooked on high and checked the pork chops at 2hours and they were dry. Maybe low at 2 hours or even 1 hour and half would be good. The taste was good and liked by even my children but the chops were too dry. I also added water chestnuts, green and red peppers and doubled the ketchup.

This recipe is delicious, tender, and juicy!!! To the reviewers that stated the recipe as being dry and/or tasteless, all I can think is that something was done wrong when making the dish. Two thumbs up!!! The only different thing I did was put the salt and pepper on the chops and not in the sauce. Maybe that's the trick that made them tender and juicy.

I followed the recipe exactly and found the pork to be dry afterwards.  The taste is five stars but will try to adjust it so that the pork isn't dry next time.

I actually liked this recipe and so did my wife, who doesn't like pork chops.  One thing...I only cooked 2 chops but used the same amount of sauce...and there was barely enough.  I would suggest doubling or more depending on whether you are using it as a gravy over potatoes or noodles.  Next time I'm going to add some mushrooms too.

Good idea to cut down on the soy sauce, & no xtra salt. The addition of honey also an added plus.

Easy, delicious, and tender pork chops that I will definitely be making again. I defrosted two boneless pork chops, then added them to my crock pot and pored over the sauce. As other users suggested, I used only 1/4 cup soy sauce and skipped the salt and pepper. After about five hours on low they were perfect. The sauce was very runny so I transferred it to a small pot on the stove and thickened it using cornstarch. I served the pork over white rice and the sauce was just great. Since I only had two pork chops, there was some leftover sauce that I am planning to have with some leftover Thanksgiving turkey and white rice.

Simple and delicious!  This is the 2nd time I made these, and for a family who is not crazy about pork chops, they devour them in no time.  I made a double batch, so I can freeze a meal for the future.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I just made this today. It was pretty good. My husband really liked it but he really enjoys salty things. It was VERY salty when I made it! I would definitely recommend following the advice in some of the other reviews and go lighter on the soy sauce and use some honey to sweeten it up. Otherwise, it was pretty good.

This recipe was so delicious!  Following the suggestions of others, I decreased the soy sauce to 1/4 cp and added 1/4 cp honey.  I cooked on low for 5 hours.  Then thickened the sauce with a bit of cornstarch and turned up to high for 10 minutes.  The porkchops and sauce over rice and stirfried veggies was amazing!

Outstanding recipe!  I doubled the sauce, followed others suggestions and cut the soy sacue down a bit and used 3 large boneless pork chops.  My husband loved it, not a bit left over.

I made this using boneless pork chops like the recipe calls for.  I also added honey and reduced the soy sauce like others suggested.  It turned out okay.  I will definitely try this recipe again though.  I think I will use chicken instead of pork simply because I'm not a huge fan of pork chops.  I will also use cornstarch like others suggested to help thicken the sauce.  I originally cooked it on high for 4 hours and the sauce was still runny.  I think I will also use even less soy sauce than I did-just a personal preference.  I think by making these  changes that I'll have a delicious dish!

Very good.  first time I made this, i followed the recipe as written and it was very delish and easy.  It is reminiscent of something nummy I would get at a Chinese restaurant.  The sauce is very very good over rice, but a bit overpowering without the bland starch to tone it down, so i highly suggest whilte or brown rice as a side for this.  I'm getting ready to make it again for the second time, I think I might cut back a tad on the brown sugar and see if it's a little less sweet.  no honey for me.

My entire family loved these pork chops, even my 8 year old daughters.  I also added honey and onions though and reduced the cooking time to only four hours.   The flavor was wonderful.  I made rice as a side dish and served the sauce over the rice.  Thank you for the recipe!

With a few changes, this was very good! First, I put my chops in frozen on high at around 2:30 in the afternoon. I mixed together 1/4 cup of honey, 1/4 cup brown sugar, about 2 tsp. of minced garlic, maybe 1/2 tsp. of ground ginger and about 1/2 cup of ketchup. I skipped over the soy sauce since I didn't have any and its just too salty for my liking. Instead, I added a good splash of worcestershire sauce. I cooked it on high until about 6:00 when I flipped it to low and added one chopped green pepper. At about 6:30 I set the chops and put the sauce (with peppers) on the stove and thickened with a bit of cornstarch. I then added everything back into the crockpot. We ate at about 6:45 but could have eaten sooner. I could have turned it on low a bit sooner too. I served it over rice and it tasted like...a sweet and sour pork chinese dish. The pepper made it! Thanks for the recipe! I will make again!

I was not a fan of this recipe.  I cooked it on low for 4 hours and the pork chops were very dry and not moist at all.  I took some suggestions of other reviews and cut down on the soy sauce and also added some canned pineapple and some of the juice as well.  The pineapple was the best part!!  I will not be making this again....

Excellent! I followed directions exactly and although it was a little salty, we loved it! I added a little cornstarch to thicken at the end and did shorten the cook time to 4 hours because my pork was not very thick.

This recipe is fantastic!  I make it with the big pork tenderloins from Costco so it turns out like a roast.  I double the recipe, the only change I make is I leave the soy sauce quantity as is and use the same quantity of honey as others suggested.  Use some corn starch to thicken up the sauce & use as gravy & rice topping!  Always a hit in my family, even my picky son goes back for seconds!

I made this this evening because i was looking for something different than the herb seasoned or fried chops we always have. I thought it tasted very good and so did my daughter, my wife on the other hand didn't like it much, she said it tasted too much like teriyaki. i made some adjustments based on other comments i cut back on the soy and added a few healthy squirts of honey and thickened with cornstarch. I'll probably make it again when my wife isn't home. Thanks for the recipe

I never write reviews but I had to for this recipe!  It was delicious!  I added about 2Tbsp of honey and only used 1/4 cup of the soy sauce.  But it turned out fabulous!  Will definitely be cooking this again and again.

Best pork chops ever!  The only thing I did different was follow others suggestions and used 1/2's instead of 1/4's.  Would have given it 6 stars if I could.

These were amazing!! I've been looking for another recipe to do with my pork chops and this was a hit. I used the pork chops with bones and the meat was falling off the bones. Amazing!

This was delicious and SO EASY!  I made with bone-in pork chops (trimmed), and followed some suggestions and added some corn starch and honey.  I just realized I didn't even add any salt or pepper - it didn't need it!

I just bought a new slow cooker, and the appealing low calories and fat brought me to the kitchen to give it a test run.  I used inch-thick chops, and they did turn out incredibly tender.  I thickened the liquid with a cornstarch slurry to a really nice sauce consistency, but we simply didn't like the flavor.  We ate two chops on noodles for dinner.  Definitely not going to try to tweak the flavors, just not making this one again.

These chops were so easy to make! I used low sodium soy sauce and cooked it on high because I started too late in the day. They were almost falling apart. YUM!

This was a hit with my family. They loved the sauce over rice. I followed the suggestion of others re the soy sauce and honey. Certainly a keeper.

ok  so i needed something fast and easy for Pork Ribs....I have used this recipe before on pork chops and so i thought why not use this recipe for ribs.....came out amazing!   I let the ribs sit in the crock pot for a few hours and then took them out  let them cool and when guests showed up threw them on the  grill for a bit more color and crispiness....  Who needs that stuff in a bottle , this is sooo much better!!! and yes i did tweak it ..1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup soy sauce, a few tablespoons of water (eased up on the sodium)  1/4 cup of ketchup...and some honey!   Can't wait for the leftovers tonight!!

I loved this recipe and so did my picky son.  Like others, I cut the soy sauce in half and added 1/4 cup of honey.  I also doubled the sauce so there were extra drippings for the rice.  I will definetly make this one again!

This is one of my favorite pork chop reciepes by far!  I took the suggestion of others and only used 1/4 cup of soy sauce and added 1/4 cup of honey as well.  The sauce didn't look to yummy when I put it all in the crock pot but the taste was so delicious.  We will definitely be having this again!

It was great will definitely do it again.  Did change soy sauce to 1/4 cup and added sliced onions.  At first it looks like you don't have enough sauce but you get more as it cooks.

Made this for my children, 1 -5 yrs old...  they loved it.  Probably b/c the flavor and there wasn't any "strange" textures like onions or fatty meats... it looks like chicken when cut up.  My husband and I liked it too.  The kids helped make the sauce, no messy dishes and little time... so a 5 star rating from a busy parent

My husband made this last night - it was a hit.  Took the recommendations and cut the soy sauce to 1/4 c, & used 1/4 c honey also used BBQ sauce instead of Ketchup.  Next time I would cook for 5 hrs not 6 - came out a little too dry but VERY tasty!

FABULOUS! Only 2 thick chops, followed others advice and reduced soy by 1/2, other ingredients as stated, and reduced time for small crockpot to 4 1/2 hours.  Removed chops and thickened sauce with approx. 1 generous T. of corn starch.  Husband and I enjoyed thoroughly and will be making again and again!  Thanks

I made this tonight and it was fab! Like the others, I tweaked it just a little. I doubled all of the ingredients except for the soy, that I kept the same. I also added a 1/2 tsp dry mustard, some diced onions, red and yellow peppers and because I have a little one, I also snuck in a zested carrot. To thicken it up, I added a cornstarch slurry at the end. I served it with white rice steamed in vegetable broth with grated carrot and sweet peas and it was absolutely wonderful!

Five stars from my family for taste, and from me for being easy to make. Lack of time made me try this on high for less time, but it made the outer edge a bit dry...still good, but if you have time, cook as directed!  I added some fresh basil and used fresh ginger because I had it.  Served it with rice and everyone ate up.  Good for leftovers too. Thank you.

These were great. My husband raved over them and my son liked them too. I was a little worried to make them because of all the negative reviews but they were wonderful. I seasoned my chops with Emeril's Essence and pepper and browned them first. I used lower sodium soy sauce -Kikkoman and a couple splashes Lea&Perrins worcestershire sauce.I used Heinz organic ketchup( the best!) and 1/3 cup brown sugar . I added in a sliced shallot with the ginger and garlic and 1/4 cup water. I cooked on low for 6 hrs and didn't need to thicken. Sauce was delish-I served with mashed potatoes, peas&carrots , and cresent rolls. Sooooo easy......what a keeper! Thanks.

This recipe is easy and turns out deliciously tender pork chops. The flavor is reminiscient of BBQ, but not quite as sweet. I thickened the sauce with TB corn starch dissolved in a TB water and it coated the pork chops nicely. However, the next day was a better hit when I shredded the meat and added a sweet BBQ sauce and served on buns. Very versatile recipe.

I'm giving this 4 stars because the flavor was really good.  I, as always made a few changes. I added some apricot preserves, and a tbsp of ginger sesame marinade that I had and then seard the boneless chops before putting them in the crock pot. I was in kind of a hurry and ended up cooking them on high for 4 hours and they came out dry.  That was most likely my fault though.  I may also use a little less soy sauce next time because it was borderline too salty and I love my food salty. That could have been the marinade that I added for flavor though. So overall not a bad recipe and I will probably try it again with a few changes.

This is the best recipe for pork chops that I have tried so far.  My mom never made pork when I was growing up, so I always have a hard time knowing how to cook it.  This recipe is FABULOUS! I only had 3 chops, but used the same amount of sauce and cooked for about 6 hours total - 2 hours on high, the rest of the time on low.  By dinner time the meat was literally falling off the bones, and it was SO tender.  We could have eaten it without a knife.  Highly recommend this recipe.

This wasn't a bad recipe, I just didn't care for it. I probably won't make it again, I'm sorry. I followed the recipe exactly, other than I doubled the sauce. While the chops were tender, I did find them to be dry, even cooking in all that liquid. They're very rich. We served over mashed potatoes. My husband liked them, too. He just wasn't wowed by them. Thanks for the recipe.

When I found this recipe I was actually looking for a recipe for a small pork loin roast.  After reading several reviews, it seemed unanamous that there was too much soy sauce, so I decreased the amount of soy sauce to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup pineapple juice.  I also prepared steamed white rice which we drizzled the strained sauce over (yummy) and broccoli.  We will definitely have this meal again.

I was looking for a quick, slow cooker recipe for pork chops. I liked that I had everything on hand for this recipe. I thought it was pretty tasty, although nothing super exceptional. I may make it again - I like the fact that it wasn't a cream soup base.

Wonderful...make sure to double the sauce, cut back on the soy sauce and only cook for about 3-4 hours.

4.5 stars. I cut the soy sauce to 1/4 cup as recommended by others, and added some water as well (less than 1/4 cup). Next time would cut down the amount of brown sugar used.

Chops were melt-in-your mouth tender, and the sauce reminded me of  southern style BBQ sauce. Shredded the leftovers with some sauce from the pot and had an excellent  sandwich the next day.
 
Watch your cooking time on your crock pot!! My chops were cooked after 4 hours on low, and would have been nearly ruined if left to cook the whole 6 hours.

While the sauce was wonderful, with the addition of the honey, the pork chops were very dry.  I will try this again and reduce the cook time to 3 hours instead of 4.

These were quick and easy to make. 12 yo son really liked them, even ate seconds. Husband was less than thrilled, but he ate them. I added about a tsp of honey to the mixture, cant say that it added much. Will definitely make again on busy day.

My husband and I just loved this recipe.  We love pork chops and to be able to do them in the crock pot is such an added plus.  Thank you for the recipe.  I have passed it along to anyone who would listen to me.  I did add 1/4 cup of honey but other than that I made it just the way it was written. I boiled the sauce and added a flour/water solution to thicken it so we could put it over the rice.  What a great meal.  Can't wait to make it again.

Sweet and tender!  I would skip salting the chops, the soy is plenty salty for this recipe.  I also added 1/4 cup of pineapple juice.  This recipe went well with white rice and stir fried vegies (with a little of the juice from the chops added in).  Next time I would add seasame seeds and cut down a bit on the soy--definetly keep the pineapple!

These were very tasty.  I also reduced the soya sauce to 1/4 cup and I added 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, also a chopped onion.  My family loved it.  Thanks.

WOW...is all i can say for this very delicious recipe.  It was so simple.  I have just returned to eating meat after 7 years of being vegetarian...and this was absolutely divine.  I made it for my husband thinking I couldn't possibly eat pork...but I had a little taste and I was hooked.  I used less sugar as another reviewer suggested and scaled everything down for 4 servings and cooked for 4 hours on low.  It was so moist and did I mention easy, easy easy!!!  thank you Will for this recipe..it's a definite keeper!

One of the best recipes I have ever made for pork chops.  They turned out so tender.  No need for a knife when cutting these.  They fall right apart.  My boyfriend didnt even know they were chops, because of how tender they were.

I thought these were just o.k. but my family raved about them and any time I mention pork chops they reminisce about how good these were the last time I made them. For that they get 4 stars :-)

It was awesome! My kids had seconds . I did tweek it based on other reviews... 1/2 c brown sugar and ketchup, 1/4c soy sauce a  big squeeze of honey,  2t minced garlic, and pepper. Omitted ginger and salt. Added  cornstarch to thicken the sauce at the end of cooking . They were thin boneless chops so 2 hours on high and 1 hour on slow  is all it needed . The best crockpot dish I ever made. Trying it with skinless chicken thighs next. Yum!

Followed the recipe exactly and it was okay. The texture of the pork was weird to me, and the sauce ended up pretty watery. I've never cooked pork chops in the slow cooker except when I later pulled them to make pulled pork, so maybe that's why. Maybe it was the pork itself, who knows.

This was amazing. I touched my fork to the pork chop and it feel apart. The flavor was amazing. I didn't have ground ginger, so I minced fresh ginger instead. I cooked it on high for 2 hours and low for 1.5 hours, then served it over rice with veggies on the side.

I should have read the reviews first.  I used three large bone-in chops.  It was very dry even though I turned the crock pot down to warm after 3 hours.  It was very salty, even though I used lower salt soy sauce.  I would like to try this again and use the honey as suggested, not add any salt, and cut back on the soy sauce.  I think it has potential to be very good.
I tried this this a second time.  I added brown sugar and left out the salt.  I only cooked it 3 hours.  I didn't like it.  It had too strong of a soy sauce taste.

Easy and delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, with the addition of adding a 1/4 cup of honey and cutting back the amount of soy sauce (I used low sodium) to a 1/4 cup.  I browned the chops in a little olive oil in a pan, seasoning them with salt and pepper on each side, prior to placing them in the crock pot.   The meat was falling off of the bones.  Wonderful served over rice.

Oh! When I saw the picture of this recipe, I had to make it, it looked so good!!  My Pork Chops did not come out looking like the picture and they did not taste like I wished they would have.  The color of my Pork Chops looked like chicken broth and tasted like rubber.  I'm not sure what I did wrong, I followed the recipe as written, maybe next time I will try using dark brown sugar and as for the Pork Chops tasting like rubber maybe I need to use a different cut of Pork.

So I made this with 4 pork chops and took the extra fat and bone off. It came out very salty and quite dry.  Maybe my pork chops were too thin and you should use the thicker version.  Not making this again

This was very good. I had to give it one less star, because I changed the recipe a bit. I used low sodium soy sauce instead, and doubled the brown sugar, ketchup. I also added a little bit of honey like all others who reviewed this. Also...don't add salt. It definitely doesn't need more salt. Even the low sodium soy sauce was a bit much.

Used the one inch chops that people recommended. They were ready in a couple hours even on low. The sauce is delicious but the pork was dry even cooking until they were done.

Sorry but this didn't work at all for me.  I used thick (1"+) boneless pork loin chops so they were pretty lean, but the sauce got very liquidy with little bits of fat in it.  I had to strain it and then boil on the stove with cornstarch to thicken, which takes away from the convenience of a slow cooker meal.  They also got too dry but that's probably my own fault for overcooking.

The long cooking time makes the chops dry.  The sauce is tasty, however.  Probably better adapted to quicker stop-top cooking.

Following others suggestions, I adjusted the soy sauce to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup honey. Served with rice and broccoli, was delicious.

Awesome recipe.  I used 1/2 sugar 1/2 soy 1/2 honey 1/2 ketchup and left out salt.  soy is salty enough.  I actually boil tofu noodles then simmer them in the sauce and excellent lo cal meal.

This turned out super good!  It was a little dry.  I would give this 4.5 stars but I don't think it will let me give half a star, so I will round up!  I will def make this again.  I ate mine over oriental ramen because I don't have any rice.  Yummy!  I cooked mine 2.5 hours on high and 2 hours on low to get the pork up to temp.  The sauce cooked down more than I thought, so you may want to add a little more towards the end.  Thanks recipe giver!

I tried it with the 1/4 cup soy sauce and added the 1/4 cup honey. I don't think there was enough liquid for the size of my crock pot. It may have been better if I had doubled or even tripled the recipe for the sauce.

I am rating this 3 stars because it was just ok. The pork was very dry. I used very thick pork chops and only had it in the crockpot for about 4.5 hours on low. Although it was tender it had no moisture at all. The flavor was alright but I've had better.

Followed recipe exactly.  Ran out of regular soy sauce so used Kikkoman that I usually reserve for sushi.  It was incredible!  We're a family of 3 and the 6 pork chops I made was not enough.

I was skeptical of ending up with dry pork chops at first, but the results were great.  I used fresh, thinly sliced ginger, minced garlic and added a 1/2 cup of water to the mixture.  Also added about 1-2TBS of honey.  I used reduced sodium soy sauce, so kept the ratios between sugar, ketchup and soy sauce.  Then added a 1/4 cup of cornstarch with water to the mixture during the last 1/2 hour of cooking.  I noticed that around hour 3, the porkchops were really hard, but then something happened around hour 4 that caused the meat to break down and begin to separate from the bone.  Definitely low and slow!  My kids loved it and used the sauce as gravy for the meat and rice.  My husband kept trying to find more food to dip into the remaining sauce!  This is a keeper, thank you All Recipes.

I used the entire sauce for 2 pork chops and we thought it was delicious.  If I were to make 6 servings I would at least double the sauce.  YUM

I've made this several times now and it's terrific. As many others have, I reduced the soy sauce (I'm not a fan of really salty food), and it works great. My DS is seven and loves it. I've been using jarred garlic as I had a giant jar in the fridge, that works just fine. 

More recently, I've used this recipe for a marinade for kabobs. I had purchased a large pork loin from Costco, cut some into cubes and marinated in the liquid, then put it on wooden skewers and BBQ'd. Delicious! Tonight we tried it with boneless skinless chicken thighs - the pork was better, but the chicken was still very good. A very versatile recipe!

I haven't tried the finished product yet, but the dish smells delicious cooking!  I made some changes based on other reviews: I'm Gluten Free and don't have any GF soy sauce around, so I used 1 cup of GF chicken broth and 3 Tb raw honey in it's place.  I seasoned the pork chops with pepper and curry powder before browning/searing them in a pan, and added more curry powder with frozen pineapple to the crock pot.  I'll make some brown rice to serve it with.  I can't wait for dinner!

I don't like pork chops very much, but the sauce was really good on rice.  Seems like it would taste good with chicken, too. My husband said it wasn't his favorite only because he doesn't prefer pork chops cooked with soy sauce/Asian cuisine, but my daughter thought it was pretty good. I might try it again with chicken.

I was really disappointed after reading all the positive reviews about this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and the flavor of the sauce was horrible--the soy sauce completely overwhelmed the other ingredients.  On a positive note--the chops were extremely tender.

This is one of our favorites!! I did double the ingredients for more sauce (left garlic the same and decreased soy sauce). If you add a sliced onion it is even tastier.

These pork chops came out very tender and moist. I took another reviewers suggestion and used 1/2 cup each on the ketchup, soy sauce (low sodium) and brown sugar. Made ample sauce.

Followed the recipe exactly as written.  6 hours was WAY too long.  The meat was dried out and bland.  The flavor never penetrated the meat, and the "sauce" separated.  Most of the flavor was on the bottom of the crock pot and the top was an oily/greasy mess from the fat rendered from the chops.  The only redeeming quality was the aroma and flavor on the bottom layer of chops in the crock pot.  They were almost edible.  We won't be repeating this recipe.

The pork chops I made were thin.  I know to watch & decrease the time when I make these again. They were a little dry but tasty.  Also, I added 1/4 cup of water & it was not necessary.  Served it over rice.

The sauce for this recipe was too strong and very thin. The pork chops were dry. If I were to try this again, I would follow other rater recommendations to cut the soy sauce to 1/4 cup and use honey.

I followed the recipe and advice of other cooks and the sauce still wasn't thick at all. My husband liked the taste of it but I wasn't satisfied. I'll try it again with some changes but so far, not a favorite.

Great Recipe! Just made a couple of small  changes. Added 1 small chopped onion placing it over the chops before the sauce went over and to the sauce added 1/4 cup of sherry cooking wine.

I haven't had pork chops in a very long time and they were on a super sale, so I found this recipe from Pinterest. I liked the flavor but I think I figured out tonight that I just don't enjoy the texture of pork chops. Overall a good dish, and I do love using my slow cooker.

Doubled the sauce and it was a hit with my kids!  Used 10 boneless chops, Served with white rice and broccoli.  I think I used too much brown sugar.  I will measure next time.  Made the house smell fantastic all afternoon!  Very easy recipe!

Great recipe!  I used thick cut boneless chops.  I did what the other folks recommended.  I decreased the soy sauce to 1/4 c, increased the ketchup and brown sugar to 1/2 c, added 1/4 c honey...cooked on low for 5 hrs....yummy!!!!  thank you!

This was delicious, even the kids loved it! I only used 1/4 cup soy sauce as suggested by other reviews, and I only had white sugar so I used that instead of brown. I also added 1/3 cup hot water to the sauce...covered with foil and cooked in oven for 6 hours at 250 degrees. The chops were so tender and flavorful served over white rice. Thanks for a great recipe.

Great family friendly recipe.  My kids loved it.  After reading other reviews, here are the changes I made.  Browned the pork chops first.  1/4 C low sodium soy sauce, 1/4 C honey, 1/4 C chicken broth.  (Added some corn starch at the end to thicken it up a bit.) Then I doubled the sauce so we would have extra with rice.  (Actually I quadrupled the recipe and froze 1/2 so I would have an easy slow cooker dinner in the future!)

I used some of the other reviewer's suggestions and this turned out great. We do not eat much salt so I thought the recommendation to lessen the soy sauce would suit our tastes. I also increased the brown sugar and ketchup to half a cup.

This was so quick and easy. To have this great dinner on a week night is such a treat. I used a pork roast instead of chops as it was a better price at my supermarket. Turned out fantastic!

I cooked for the recommended cooking time and had plenty of sauce, very tender pork.

This was very easy and a good way to make pork chops moist and flavorful, but I couldn't get over the extreme saltiness of this dish even though I heeded some suggestions to lessen the soy sauce; also my boys were not big fans. Probably won't make this again.

This was excellent! I used thin-sliced boneless pork chops and only 1/4 cup of soy sauce (to cut down a bit on the sodium). It turned out amazing - no knife needed!

Wasn't bad but nothing to rave about.  Followed the recipe but added 1/4 cup of water and a tbs honey, cooked for 4 hours on low.  Very dry.  Kids wouldn't eat it and they aren't picky eaters.  This one unfortunately won't make it in my recipe book.

Good sauce but it was too thin, reduce the amount of soy sauce.  Also, the meat was a little dry.  Probably won't be making this again.

I found this recipe to have a bit of an odd taste--perhaps due to my dislike of ketchup. However, there is no denying the chops were deliciously tender--will be on a mission to find another slow-cooker pork chop recipe that is more enjoyable!

Used the equal parts ketchup, soy sauce and brown sugar (no salt).  Best with thick cut chops.  I give it 4 out of 5 for flavor and 5 for ease.  Served over shortgrain brown rice - very good.

I have made these once. I plan on making them again. I followed recipe exactly but added 1/2 C honey. I cooked them from frozen about 8 hours on low. Meat was falling off but some was dry. I wouldn't cook that long next time.

Not bad but not great.  It came out of the crock pot gooey and thin so I put it in a wok and heated it.  Made it much better.  All I can say is my hubby hasn't asked for it again...

This was a big hit with my husband and kids.  I added 2 each red & white pearl onions, extra garlic and cut the soy sauce to a little under 1/4 cup.  I forgot to add the ginger but it was still delicious.  This is definitely going in my rotation.

I fixed this recipe for the family this evening, and it was a hit.  I had a package of 8 chops, so I doubled the sauce.  I would have preferred a bit more spice, but my family doesn't, so these were perfect.  The addition of 1 t of red pepper flakes would be good.  I heeded the warnings of the previous reviews about the chops being too dry, so I used my slow cookers meat thermometer feature to cook them to 160*, then it switched to warm.  They turned out tender and perfect.  We are going to have the leftovers, shredded, in lettuce wraps later in the week.

I followed the ingredients list and added some chopped onion (1 medium), chopped apples (2 small), 1/4 cup of rice vinegar, teaspoon of pepper, and 2 additional roughly chopped garlic cloves. All 3 kids (3, 5, and 7) loved this over brown rice with sliced raw cucumbers & edamame as side vegetables.

Great idea and not a bad dish at all, but I'd agree you could cut back on the soy sauce and I didn't include salt as there's plenty for my taste from the pork, ketchup, and soy sauce.  I also saved the sauce and used it with spaghetti and broccoli the next day. Awesome pairing.

I made this on Sunday and it was VERY good!  My husband loved that the chops just fell apart. I DID shorten the cooking time to 5 hours on low and then about 45 minutes on warm. Moist and yummy! I also added carrots and asparagus. I served it over mashed potatoes.

I'm rating four stars only because I fudged the recipe a little as I saw most people had. I used everything as was except for cutting the Soy Sauce back to a 1/4 cup ( I'm not big on all the salt ) and added 1/4 cup Honey ( I love the sweetness ). The Sauce itself was great and the porkchops were delicious!

After reading the reviews, I decided to double the sauce recipe - except for the soy. Others suggested honey as an additional add-in ingredient. I didn't have any, but I'm not sure it would have helped. We didn't like this at all.

I followed the recipe exactly and these were very yummy! I would say they were pretty dry, so I am giving them a 4... perhaps changes in cooking time would have fixed it, but I always try to make a recipe as it is written first. This is one of the best pork chop recipes I have had- thanks!

These are by far the best pork chops I ever had! I doubled the sauce (but used half of the amount of soya sauce) and added a bit of honey in the mix. I also added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce at the end. I served it over jasmine rice and it was delicious! The pork chops were extremely tender. I rarely eat pork chops, but with this recipe (which is super easy too) I will definitely be eating them more often.

These turned out great! I also added 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup ketchup. I had some pork steak that we I was not impressed with the flavor, so I decided to try them in the crockpot and found this recipe. My husband and little kids loved it!!!

This recipe came out great and it is so easy.  We only used 1/4 cup of soy sauce to cut down on salt and we cooked it on low for 5 hours.

I just tried this recipe and it has become my favorite for pork chops. I rarely make them and when I do they are usually fried briefly to get a nice brown color then baked with a can of Campbell's mushroom soup.  Despite my best efforts this results in finding them a little too dry and tough for my taste.  I jumped on this recipe because I love the convenience of my slow cooker and had never considered cooking pork chops in one.  I followed the advice in the other reviews and only used 1/4 cup of soy sauce and added 1/4 cup of honey to the other ingredients.  I didn't feel the need for the salt or pepper.  The soy sauce really is salty enough for my taste and after trying them after simmering on low for 6 hours I found they tasted great with no extra seasoning.  I found them as the other reviewers described: meat falling off the bone and delicious.  I also thickened the sauce with cornstarch and served over rice.  Great meal served with apple pie for dessert!

Family favorite! Have been making this recipe for a couple years now! We always lessen the soy sauce, use garlic salt/powder and add onion powder. We cook it on low all day and we don't have dry chops. I have never added cornstarch to thicken the sauce-but that is a great idea! We love eating this with extra wide egg noodles, we just put the chop and sauce on top. DELISH!

I didn't want this to turn out to 'asian' so I cut the ginger and soy sauce both by half, I also used half brown sug and half pure maple syrup. I only had 3 chops, but love sauce so made the full amount. Turned out really tasty and moist concidering I used center cut boneless.

I am in LOVE with this dish. (and so was my 4 yr old). I took the advice of others and only used 1/4 cup of soy. I also used thin, boneless pork chops and they took NO time to cook. My husband even smiled! Would definitely be wonderful served over rice. Next time I make it, I'm going to add red pepper strips to it. YUM!

I made this recipe as written. Mine also came out a bit dry as some others have written, however, the juice was good & poured it on the pork chops to take some of the dryness out. I made rice with it and broccoli. I wouldn't make this recipe again for pork chops, but would use the sauce for chicken.

Sorry guys, ewe, just ewe. The chops were dry, the sauce was too strong and no, I didn't change anything except what was widely suggested. Total waste of my time and thick center cut pork chops.

I thought this recipe was alright.  My picky 10 year old liked it and wanted seconds.  My husband said he liked it but didn't seem overly thrilled.  The porkchops were not really tender.  Some got a little dried out.

This was a very good recipe...unless you are watching your sodium intake. I really enjoyed the flavor and ease of the recipe. Here are the couple of modifications I made: I doubled all ingredients for the marinade, except the soy sauce. I replaced the brown sugar with honey. I, also, browned the pork chops before putting them in the cooker.  My family loved it and I will make this again!

I am giving this 3 stars, because my husband loved the sauce.  But the chops were so dry, that I didn't eat them and he only had 1, usually, he has at least 2 chops.

I wouldn't say this is bad, but I also wouldn't say it is good.. it's just kinda, blah.  I have rated many 5 star recipes on this site, this one doesn't come close to five stars.  It is very quick and easy, but the flavor isn't anything special.

Sauce was delicious! I also scaled the soy sauce back to 1/4 C. and added 1/4 C. of honey. My husband said he thinks this would be a great sauce for pulled pork, so I'll try that next time in stead of the pork chops. Thanks!

Yummy!  Even my picky eater enjoyed this dish.  I did cut back on the soy sauce as suggested by several.  I think it would be too salty for us as it is written.

this quickly became my family's favorite pork recipe (once i tweaked it a little bit). i used a 2-3 lb. pork loin roast instead of pork chops, because it tends to hold up a little better in the crock pot. i made more sauce by using 1/3 cup each of brown sugar and ketchup, adding about 1/4 cup honey, and reducing the soy sauce to 1/3 cup. it really is a big hit here.

These were good but nothing i would rave about. I read alot of complaints from other members that the soy adds a lot of salt..so i used 50% lower sodium soy sauce and found that the salt flavor was not overwhelming. I only used 3 small boneless porkchops and this recipes barely made enough sauce to cover those in the crockpot... so i added a little water. I browned the chops in olive oil before I cooked in crockpot on low for 3 hours. I found that they were not too dry but think they would have been if I cooked any longer. The sauce is very tasty and I actually enjoyed it more over jasmine rice than on the pork chops themselves. I would make the sauce again in the future but most likely will not use on pork chops again.

We really enjoyed this.  I used pork chops out of a large package which I had used half of the night before.  The chops, using the recipe from the night before, were dry.  This recipe made the chops fall-apart yummy and not at all dry.  We doubled the sauce so we would have enough to pour over rice (we ended up having way more than necessary)  but, according to others' suggestions, did NOT double the soy sauce.  Had a slight Korean BBQ taste.  Will definitely make again!

My family loved this dish.  I changed a little bit I used 1/4 of soy sauce, 1/4 of honey and 1/2 of ketchup.  No salt and pepper since the  soy sauce does the trick.  We ate it over a white  rice and grilled zuccini.

I followed some of the other reviewers and reduced the amount of soy sauce from 1/2 cup to 1/4 cup. I left out the salt and ginger, but added 1/4 of honey. I then cooked the pork on low heat for about 3.5 hours. Instead of thicken up the sauce the pork chops were in, I made an additional sauce. Which I cooked in a saucepan and added cornstarch to thicken. I served the chops over white rice and topped them with the sauce. The result..deliciously, tender pork chops.

I make this recipe all the time in my slow cooker. It takes no time to throw together. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is, I added honey, about 1/4 cup, and used a little corn starch to thicken the sauce at the end. It's now a standby for me.

These were so great and moist. Yummy. Next time I will use a bit less soy sauce and add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce.

This was not good, I made as recipe stated except reduced the soy sauce as others suggested. Turned out very dry and did not taste very good at all.

okay, admittedly my chops were small but they were thick. Cooked on low for 4 1/2 hours and they were dry as dust- cooking time is way to long. I'm giving this 4 stars though because the sauce is incredibly delicious. I increased sauce as per other reviewers. Will make this again (when I'm home and can moniter!) but probably on stove top.

We didn't care for this.  Somehow the meat was tender but VERY dry.  The flavor did permeate the pork but we didn't care for the taste of it.  I used low-sodium soy sauce due to reviews stating that it was too salty.  It was very easy to make, just not something we cared for.  Thanks anyway.

I took others advice and only cooked on low for 3 hours - they still came out extremely dry. Next time I will shorten it to 1.5 hours.   The sauce was awesome though! I added a 1/4 cup of honey and served over rice.

full of flavor...used fresh ginger, a few dashes of worcestershire sauce, and about a cup of homemade bbq sauce from this site (big Al's K.C.). i think i cooked too long in crockpot -- too much shopping!  tasty but pork too well done -- my fault.

I put the chops in the slow cooker in the morning before work and left them all day (about 10 hours) on low. The house smelled delicious when we got home. The chops were super tender and very flavourful. I found them to be quite salty but kids and hubby loved them. He said they had that "addictive-smokey-candied" taste. We think this recipe would be great on any cut of meat.

This is a good start, but it does not work as-is.  First, if your crock pot is large like mine, there is not enough liquid and your meat will dry out.  So add at least 1/4-1/2 cup water.  I also should have added the honey suggested by a previous reviewer (maybe 1/4 cup) and cut the ginger in half or used fresh ginger, as that was pretty much all I tasted in the end product.  Maybe the worcestershire sauce would have helped.  Everyone liked it (served over rice) but by that I mean that everyone ate it without complaining.  So I might try it again with much doctoring ... or I will more likely just keep looking for a good slow cooker boneless pork chop recipe.

Easy and delicious. The sauce is fantastic, smooth with a slight attractive bite. I removed the sauce from the slow cooker and cooked it on the stove with three teaspoons of corn starch, and brought it to a boil. That changed it from juice to a nice, rich sauce. One could double the sauce and use it as a topping for rice or for extra dipping sauce, on the side.

this recipe was awesome.  I made it twice in one week.  I did make a couple changes.  Like others I used only 1/4 cup soy sauce (low sodium) and added a few squeezes of honey.  I also used bone-in pork chops because I think they have better flavor and asked the butcher at the store to cut me chops that were 1 inch thick to prevent them from drying out.  Also to prevent drying I browned both sides of chops in a pan with olive oil with salt and pepper.  I also doubled the sauce recipe for 4 large chops to make sure the chops were totally covered in sauce and I added  a  jar of apricot preserves to the sauce for a little added chunkiness.  Sauce was not too thin but I addeda  litrtle corn starch anyway towards the end just to thicken a little.  Served with boil-in-bag white roce and broccoli and it was the easiest most delicious meal.  The meat was really moist and fell off the bone.

Very good and very easy.  I browned the chops before adding and since I had six chops I doubled everything but the soy sauce which I cut to 1/4 cup.  The sauce still came out very watery so I added 2 tsps of cornstarch and it thickened up wonderfully.  Served it with rice and peas and it was a big hit.

I had frozen chops, mixed the ingredients (1/2 the soy, no salt and 1 tsp. meat tenderizer)and made it a rub. Put in the cooker on low for 8 hrs. WOW. Very moist and tasty.

This was a good spring board to what turned out to be a delicious dinner that my family absolutely loved. I used a pork tenderloin, a 29 oz. can of tomato sauce and honey in lieu of the brown sugar. I wasn't completely happy with the flavor so I added in some sesame oil, my usual garlic and onion powders, black pepper and balsamic vinegar. That seemed to due the trick and the sauce was wonderful. In order to keep meat from shredding, I cooked it the day before so that the refrigeration would help it slice nicely. Thanks so much Koorbrus; this one has been ordered a keeper from my gang!

I made tis recipe last night for dinner.  I used a thicker cut pork chop and I doubled the sauce leaving out the extra salt. It was still pretty salty and the soy sauce was a bit overpowering. I only used 1/2 tsp. ginger because I am not a huge fan.  I wish I hadnt added any ginger at all. I cooked the pork chops for 6 hours on low and I dont know if I just over cooked them or what but they were not falling off the bone.  I wish this had been great but sadly it wasnt.  I wont be making it again.  Just wasnt for us.

These were very very good and so very easy to make!  I only made 3 pork chops but made the full amount of sauce.  I started late on these so I cooked them on high for 2 hrs.  The sauce was so yummy and tasted great over white rice.  I did omit salt as the sauce was salty enought with the Soy Sauce.  This has a great chinese taste and I will be using the left over sauce to make a beef and brocolli meal!

As advised by other reviews, I increased the amount of ketchup and added a splash of bottled bbq sauce.  The meat was very tender, although as I was led to expect from other reviewers, a bit dry.  All of us around the table loved the flavor nonetheless.

try 1/4 cup of soy sauce, 1/4 cup of orange juice and 1 heaping tablespoon of dry lipton onion soup mix w/the other ingredients. Other than that it's a good base, if the sauce is too runny like other cooks mentioned then stir a bit of corn starch in with the soy sauce or juice prior to cooking in the crock pot.  Easy Peasy !

I was so dissapointed with this recipe. I dont know why but they were dry and I had even doubled on the sauce....anyways, I ended up throwing 6 chops away so I was a little upset but I guess trial and error are bound to happen. Good Luck if you decide to try this.......

I didn't read the reviews and just went with the rating before I started this. After reading some reviews I ended up adding 2 cups of orange juice. Next time I will only add one because it watered down the soy too much but my hubby exclaimed this to good "even cold" the next day. I did add a 1/4 tsp of cayenne as we like things spicy and it was good. I rated it a 4 because after only 1/2 hour before I watered it down it would have had too much soy.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  I was looking for a different way to cook my pork chops in the slow cooker than the mushroom gravy recipe I usually use.  It seems as though a lot of people liked this recipe, so, maybe it is just our tastse, but, both my husband and I thought this was pretty bland.  The cooking time was off also - so mine were pretty dry.  I like a thicker sauce and this was pretty thin.  You could probably try to reduce the sauce on the stove for more of a glaze consistency.  I won't try this one again.

This recipe was quick and really easy to follow.  I didn't plan ahead, and used frozen pork chops...I did double the sauce to make sure there was enough...still didn't quite cover them.  I also turned the pork chops throughout the cooking time to make sure both sides were sitting in the sauce at some point.  A definitely quick and easy supper for a busy family!

I followed other reviewers' suggestion to reduce cooking time to 3 hrs on low for thin cut chops and to reduce soy sauce.  Pork chops turned out very tasty and tender.  I am a slow cooker novice, but I will definitely make this dish a regular.

Well this is the first time I've ever cooked in a slow cooker and the first time Ive ever made pork chops.. so i was a bit scared but it didnt come out too bad..I added 1/4 cup honey, and doubled the sauce recipe. I then marinated the chops in 1/2 the marinade for about 2 hours then I mixed about 3/4 of a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's hickory and brown sugar bbq sauce with the rest of the marinade and poured it over the chops. Mine were falling off the bone in about 3 1/2 hours. My only complaint is that they were a bit to sweet..but that was my fault because I added a bit more brown sugar and honey. Also when my chops were about an hour away from cooking, the sauce in the pot seemed a bit watery so I disolved about 2 tsp of corn starch in 2 tsp of cold water and added it to the pot and it thickened up almost to a nice glaze.. I will be making this again.. except this time I wont add the extra honey and brown sugar! Thanks for the recipe!

Well, I made these today, doubling the sauce and cooking them for 7 hours (I didn't have any choice - I was at work). End result, a charred mess. My husband is out getting dinner right now. :) But seriously, these smelled DELICIOUS and I am going to make them again pronto, but not on a work day - I'll make them when I can be home to watch them and make sure they don't cook for longer than about 3 hours or so, like the other reviewers said. I think they'll be a hit. Perhaps this recipe was based off of the older slow cookers that cooked at lower temperatures? Anyway, definitely try this recipe but DON'T let it go for 6 hours. Cheers! Note at a later date: I did make these again, and they're great! I used only 1/4 cup soy, increased ketchup to 1/2 cup, then doubled the sauce and cooked for only 3 hours. Yum! Served with coleslaw and brown rice.

These are great!  I've made them several times.  I noticed that if they are cooked too long or on high setting then they get a little dry, but if cooked like the recipe says, they're super yummy and moist.  I add fresh green beans in for the last hour and they soak up the sauce and taste great, too.  Enjoy!

My family thoroughly enjoyed this recipe! I double the sauce which still didn't cover 4 thick chops, added a can of beer, cooked on low for 3 1/2 hours and it was so tender you didn't need a knife to cut it.

Very tasty recipe.  The only changes I made were adding 2 tablespoons of honey and sliced onions.  Also, I cooked for three hours on low.  They were very tender and juicy.

My husband and I thought this was so-so, we weren't crazy about the overpowering taste of soy sauce. We loved how tender the pork chops came out though and it was super easy!

My husband and I don't care for too much soy sauce, so after reading the reviews I made some revisions. I doubled the sauce up by using 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/8 cup of soy sauce, 1/2 cup ketchup, a pinch of cloves and ginger, and 1/2 cup of water, The sauce was wonderful, but unfortunately the chops were dry, and they were only on low heat for 4 hours. The meat was falling off the bone, but like I said, it was dry. Maybe next time I will try 2-3 hours instead of 4.

The flavor was good, but the chops were very dry.  I made the amount of sauce that the recipe calls for, but only made 2 pork chops with it.  The recipe calls for 6, so I should have had plenty of sauce.  Onc ein the crockpot, the sauce didn't even come close to covering the pork chops and so they dried out.

Not bad at all.  I used only 1/2 the soy sauce called for and no salt at all, any more would have been incredibly salty.  I may try worchestershire next time.  I didn't have any honey as some have suggested and it was good, but I may try more brown suger next time.  I didn't think the chops dried out much.  I will make this again.

These were pretty tasty chops. I started mine frozen, and after they were partially cooked I drained the fat and then added the sauce. I added honey as per some other reviewers. Very tender and falling apart. Served w/rice which we topped w/ the extra sauce. Would make again.

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I only had a dash of dry mustard left so I substituted curry powder and added a bit of white pepper.  Also, I added some mixed veggies just before it was done and served the "gravy" over rice.  My kids loved it and we ate the whole thing!  I'll definitely make this again - it was sort of like a "budget curry"...

Oh MY!! This is excellent.  I used a pork roast.  Thru it all into the crock pot and then went out and worked in the yard all day.  Had to fight my husband and kids for the leftovers the next day.  Didn't really care for the soy sauce used half if what was called for, but think next time will use 1/4.  Also doubled sauce recipe based on other reviews.  Pineapple juice was great addition.  And so was cornstarch in the last 1/2 hour.  Meat fell apart.  YUM!  A real keeper!!  Thanks Will

Everyone loved these. I made a few changes to the recipe, though ~ left out the soy sauce and used Teriyaki sauce instead (1/4 cup), added several squirts of honey and lemon juice. Cooked on low for 5 hours and they were perfect.

These were delicious.  I followed the advice of some other reviews and added a touch of honey and used low-sodium soy sauce.  I browned the chops first and then put them in the crock pot for 4 hours on high.  We will definately use this recipe again!

I used bone-in pork chops because thats all I had. I also reduced the soy sauce as someone else mentioned.  I also cooked them longer then suggested because I am out of the house longer when I'm at work.  These were absolutely delicous!! So tender they just fell apart. Almost tasted like ribs I guess because I had the bone in.  Everyone loved them even my daughter.  I will definitely make again. :)

This recipe did made the pork chops tender and was easy to prepare, but I have to agree with a previous review that the soy sauce was overpowering. I suppose with the ketchup and brown sugar added, I assumed the sauce would be more on the BBQ side. Oh, well!

This recipe was great.  I added my own twist, however.  I don't like ginger so I didn't add that.  I didn't have soy sauce so I used Vinegar and I added some pineapple chunks.  It was a great base and they sure were "fall-apart" tender.  Thanks for the idea.

These pork chops came out very tender, but very dry. I don't know if it was the cut I used (butterfly) or if the six hours was too long. My family did not care for these. I use a very similar sauce as a marinade for pork tenderloins which I broil or bake. I think those methods of cooking suit the pork much better. I will not make these again.

This is a keeper!  They came out so moist and falling off the bone, no knife needed!!! I used two thick bone in pork chops, seasoned them with pepper, onion & garlic powder and browned each side in cast iron skillet.  I did chunk up a medium onion about inch pieces and layer on the bottom of crock pot and laid the chops on top. They caramelized great.   For the sauce (which I doubled and took others advise and halved the soy) using 1/2 cup low sodium soy, 1 cup ketchup, 1 cup loosely packed brown sugar, about 1/4 to 1/2 cup honey and a heaping TBS of minced garlic from the jar.  After pouring that over chops in pot, I poured in a little over 1 cup of chicken broth to be sure the liquid was over the chops.  Lastly I added about a TBS of better than bullion beef flavor.  I didn’t have any other flavor.  Cooked on low for 5 hours (keeping an eye on them so they didn’t become dry).  I did mix 1/4 corn starch/ 1/4 cup water together and stirred into pot (after removing chops) to thicken.  Placed the chops back in for about 10 minutes while rice cooked.  Served over brown rice, poured sauce over and with my boyfriend “famous” green beans (Allen’s beans, onions, bacon bits, garlic salt). We both cleaned our plates.  The flavor was just right.  Not too sweet, not to soy saucy.  We have a ton of sauce left over but I’d rather have too much than not enough, plus I believe that aided in the moistness of the chops.  We will be making this again, for sure!

I enjoyed these pork chops, but my husband absolutely loved them.  It makes a delicious sauce and tender pork.  No changes necessary.  This may become my go to pork chop recipe.

These pork chops were wonderful! My kids devoured them and even ate the leftovers the next day for lunch. I served these over rice. Prior to serving I took the chops out of the crock pot and thickened the gravy with some corn starch.

This is so delicious! Very simple and easy to do. I came home on my lunch break seasoned the pork chops with a little season salt, garlic powder and pepper. I doubled the sauce ingredients because I did have eight pork chops and plus I’m a sauce girl, always good to have extra! I did add some onions and green peppers with minced garlic. When I cake home they were falling off the bone, which was about 6 hours in. Added cornstarch to the sauce to thicken while the crock pot was on high. Husband ate it up wanting seconds!

I made this exactly as written. Mine was ready after 31/2 hrs on low. Good thing I checked them or they would have been over cooked. Excellent sauce. I made again but used chicken and added celery, carrots, onion, green pepper and water chestnuts  about halfway through. Served with steam brown rice and it was out of this world.

Will definitely make them again!  I cut back slightly on the amount of brown sugar, since there's sugar in ketchup and  I used fresh ginger.

I gave this recipe a 5 star because it looks so good. Now I am going to try to do the conversion to a pressure cooker. Any suggestions would be welcome. 
By the way I am 79 (next month) and still love to cook and get recipes from the internet. Just bought a electric pressure cooker a few months ago and still learning to use it. Love it so far! I wish this site would pay more attention to pressure cooking.

Used only 1/4 cup soy sauce and doubled most other sauce ingredients.  Also added about a cup of orange juice.  Very tasty sauce and plenty of it.  Thickened with tapioca starch during last hour.  Cooked only 3 hours on low.  Served with rice.  Used chicken this time but will definitely make again with pork.

loved them! did as others and doubled sauce ingredients. Kept all ingredients  but halved the soy sauce, left out salt and pepper, and added 3 tablespoons of honey. Slow cooked 6 bone in chops for 5 hours, it was perfect. Thickened sauce after with flour and served over white rice. A keeper for sure!

I added 2 t of dark roasted sesame seed oil and doubled the recipe.  Did not add any extra salt.  Only had a little ketchup so I use Heinz Chili Sauce to make up the difference.  The chops are cooking now and smell wonderful.  I tasted the sauce and YUM!  Will have it over white rice and some brussel sprouts. And Sweet Tea, of course!  :o)

Absolutely delicious! I doubled the given recipe and followed it exactly. I used 6 chops and after three hours on high (I started late so 6 hours on low would not work for us), I tasted the marinade. It was so delicious- due to my families tastebuds (not mine- were it just me, I would have left it alone), I added one spoonful of honey so it would be a bit sweeter. It was falling off the bone tender- my family called it 'meat candy'.  There was absolutely none left. Follow the recipe as is.. it is so good. Keeping for sure!

I've only made pork chops fried or with some lemon and baked. I wanted to throw some chops in the slow cooker and go out and let me tell you this recipe was perfect for it!!! As suggested by someone else, I put 1/2 cup of soy sauce, brown sugar, ketchup. I sprinkled garlic powder and a little ginger over it all, added some minced garlic and pepper and stirred it up! I also added a chopped onion in there and it was sooooooooo goooood!!! I also added some cornstarch to thicken it up but wow. Wasn't expecting something so tasty!

My family LOVES this recipe!! I have used boneless and bone-in pork chops. The thicker the chop, the better - because it cooks too fast for really thin chops and can get dry. I think I will try what others have suggested next time we make these~ half the soy sauce and add honey...sounds yummy!  We serve this with broccoli and a creamy orzo - big hit!!

I've made this several times. The first time I followed the recipe exactly . The second time   I added honey to the recipe  and the third time I used molasses  as an extra addition. All three are very good in my view but, the family loves it made exactly as written and asked that I add it to a regular rotation.

Made this tonight - meant to take pictures but we gobbled it up too quick! super easy, delicious, awesome for a quick meal that you forget about until you're ready to eat. I would suggest honey, as per previous reviews and you don't need a lot of sauce so if you're thinking of doubling I would skimp on some of the soy sauce - maybe a bit too salty. It's already been requested again! Thanks for the perfect pork chops for this house!

Really good, and very easy.  I added a can of crushed pineapple in juice and 2 tbsp cornstarch dissolved in water for the last 30 minutes.  Served over white rice.  Everyone loved it!  Thanks for a keeper recipe.

Great taste! My bf even called it amazing! I used 6 boneless 1 inch thick porkchops and cooked for a little over three hours on low. Like many other reviewers I doubled the sauce but only used 1/4 of soy sauce in total. I omitted the salt, pepper and ginger and added 1/2 cup of honey. I thickened the sauce with cornstarch and served over brown rice and with carrots.

Really good pork chop recipe! Actually the first time I have made pork chops and they didn't come out dry. Only change I made was to add 1/4 cup of honey to the sauce. I think the sauce would be a great rib sauce too!

Since I work 12 hour days, I am always looking for good and easy crock pot recipes, and this one is a keeper! The reason I didn't give it more stars is that it is a bit "soy saucy" for me. I still like it, but the taste of soy sauce is super strong. It cooked on low for 6 hours and then switched to warm for 3 hours and they fell off the bone and were very tender.

I thought this recipe was good. Next time I will cut the soy in half, as it was a bit salty. And definitely cut down on the cook time. My pork chops were a bit smaller and ended up being sorta dry. Great flavor though!

I enjoyed this recipe a ton! It had a great flavor, the meat was tender,  and made an incredible sauce. I will use low sodium soy sauce the next time I make this. Even though I used 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1/4 cup honey, it was a little too salty. Next time I'll double the sauce. It was great on mashed potatoes.

I loved them, my family loved them. They were AMAZING!! Only thing is that you need afterwords to be armed with real good scouring pads. I've soaked & scrubbed for a week and I can't get the burnt on stuff off my crockpot.

i had 4 massive pork chops that i was worried would be tough, so i used them in this recipe, along with the advice of putting honey in the sauce mix. I thickened the sauce at the end and it tasted great, the  chops just fell apart and melted in our mouths. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was terrible.  I even started with half frozen pork chops, added some water to the sauce to prevent them from drying out, and they were still dry after only 6 hours on low.  And they looked nothing like the picture.

Followed the recipe exactly as shown. The meat is dry and I didn't care for the sauce either. I was very disappointed as this is the first recipe I have made of this website that I didn't like.

My family loves this recipe. My five year old son, and two younger toddlers both adored it, and my husband did too. My favorite part? I am so sick of slow cooker recipes that involve cooking first! Browning meat, cooking sauce....etc. and then pouring all of it into the slow cooker. Nope. I bought a slow cooker so  I could pour uncooked things in it and they would cook. This is simple, tastes great, and I only cook it for three hours on high. I can never remember to put it in earlier. :/

I have been using this recipe for over a year now.I use a pork loin and not chops.  It is WONDERFUL.  It is my go to recipe when I take a "dinner" for someone at church. I tweak it here and there but is always mouth watering.

I liked the flavor of the sauce but, the pork chops were a little dry.   Since most reviews were saying that it was too salty, I cut the soy sauce in half.  I added a quarter cup honey and I also added a half cup beef broth.  The sauce was very flavorful but, I think next time I'll use a seared pork tenderloin.

Delicious!  I did use some suggestions from others.  I added pineapple, green pepper and onions.  I doubled the sauce and used corn starch to thicken at the end.  This is definitely a keeper and I will be making this again.

Took other's recommendations for the sauce...doubled it using 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 tsp ginger, 1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce, 1/2 cup ketchup, 4 cloves garlic, & 1/2 cup honey.  Added 3 green peppers and some pineapple tidbits during the last hour of cooking. Unfortunately I made the mistake of not checking on the dish while cooking it...6 hours is way too long to cook, maybe 4 hours next time.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was awesome!  This is a definite keeper.  The juice was excellent over white rice.  Definitely will be making it again for my family of 4 which includes a 4-yr old and a 2-yr old.

I cut the soy sauce in half and increased the catchup, eliminating the ginger because I didn't have any.   My boyfriend and I both enjoyed it. I will definitely make it again!

The sauce tasted fine, good even. I added a few things per others' recommendations (ginger, honey). But the chops were so far beyond dry. They would have been inedible if they weren't shredded and soaked in sauce, and even like that they were really dry and mealy and not meat-like. This confirms for me that you just can't do lean meat in the slow cooker. I won't make this again.

I would definitely omit the ginger next time I try this recipe. Overall I found the meat somewhat dry and bland. After reading the reviews I used only 1/4 cup soy sauce added 1/4 cup honey. I would tweak the recipe and go with the advice of DomesticEngineer2 and season with Montreal steak spice and brown. I have a crock pot with a temperature probe so they took 5 hours on slow cook.

I also used 1/2 c soy, ketsup and brown sugar and a few squirts of honey.  Taste more like BBQ sauce with a tangy kick to it.

With fairly thin, boneless chops, I thought 6 hours on low was a little much.  I may try going 5 hours on low next time.

Making this for the 3rd time today.   My son said I should make this every week.   You know it's good if your kids like it.   Only change was to add honey and omit salt.   For those that said the chops were dry....2 ideas.....Did you slow cook them ?   Low and slow = fall apart tender.   Also,  want a good quality pork chop,  you get what you pay for.   We raise hogs on our farm.   Have found it best to buy meats from the farmer / farm markets or reputable butcher.   It's amazing the difference in flavor and quality.

The pork chops were dry and overdone when they first came out of the crockpot - I'm new to slowcooking, but I did notice this recipe doesn't have enough liquid as written to meet the suggested amount of liquid to fill my crockpot. I watch my sodium intake, so I followed the modifications of others and did 1/2 soy sauce and 1/2 honey, and I did like the taste of the sauce. It was better after I reheated it the next day, using flour to thicken the consistency to what was shown in the picture. As others mentioned, sauce was good over rice, but the pork was best when I sliced it up and reheated in the sauce.

Overall it wasn't bad, but next time I would simmer the sauce on the stovetop and find a different way to cook the chops.

This was a huge hit! My family is not a big fan of pork chops in general, but they said if I made them like this, they would eat them every time! I was thrilled to find something everybody liked. I used 1/4 soy sauce, no ginger, no salt and pepper, 1/2 cup brown sugar and didn't have garlic cloves so I used garlic powder. Still delicious! I'm going to try this with chicken.

My whole family loved it, even my daughter who doesn't like pork!  I followed the recipe except did not add any extra salt and used reduced-sodium soy sauce and Splenda brown sugar blend to make it healthier.  Delicious!

We loved this! Made a few modifications: cut the soy in half, added about 1/4 of water to the bottom of the crock pot and added a dash of red pepper flake.  I didn't hae honey but I used a few squirts of blue agave.  It cooked for about 5 1/2 hours and was perfect!  Served with brocoli which made the meal perfect. Thanks for sharing the recipe.  We will be using htis again!

As I usually try to do my first time making any recipe I followed it to the letter. While the output was edible I was disappointed, as the chops were not as tender and moist as I would have expected. The pot juices, while thin, provided enough moisture and flavor to salvage the meal. Perhaps it was  the fault of my older crock pot - it was the smallest one of three, and seemed a good choice for my 6 chops, as opposed to the newest which holds 4 times as much - maybe it was too hot, I don't know, so I may try again using my larger newer slow cooker if I try this again. The flavors in the sauce are marvelous, so I may give it another shot. I'll happily update this review at that point.

This honestly is the FIRST review I've ever left! This recipe is AMAZING!! I didn't change a thing! It tastes as though I spent hours making it! I have made it twice in the last week ( Once in the slow cooker, and once on the grill) at my husbands request. I used bone in pork chops in the slow cooker, and steak on the grill. This would be great on ribs and kabobs! Thanks Koorbrus!!

Good chops. I made 2, not 6, I cooked them for 3 1/2  hours and were 145 degrees almost exactly. I added a dash of woshtshure sauce (probably not spelled right)I think that was a little much, maybe I'll try honey next time. Anyway good alternative to old dried out pork chops.

I had four chops and I doubled the sauce hoping there would be some extra for the pasta. All the sauce soaked into the meat and it was really good. Tasty and tender. Will make these again for sure.

Great recipe.   I doubled the sauce and made some changes.  I ended up using 1/2 c soy, 1/2 c ketchup, 1/4 c brown sugar and 1/4 c honey,omitted the ginger and added garlic and a 1/4 tsp red pepper flake and black pepper instead.   Thickened it with corn starch at the end!   Although we don't care for pork chops this made our cheap bone in chops edible.   Very easy!  Very good!   Family loved it!   Served it with rice and green beans for an easy dish!

I cut the soy sauce in half and added almost as much honey. Threw  in some peppers and doubled the marinade recipe. We loved it, especially with the ginger. Delicious!

With all the rave reviews, I'm thinking I made it wrong but hubby and I weren't fans at all. We found that our pork chops turned out really dry and the sauce was too sweet. Probably just personal preference.

Really enjoyed these! I put red peppers in for the last 1/2 hour of cooking and they were ready in 4.5 hrs. total on low.  Served them over basmati rice with peas.

I did it exactly as the recipe except I used 1/4 cup of soya as recommended by others. I was very disappointed with the flavour. The ginger was not a spice that went well with the other ingredients. I would not make this agian.

Absolutely loved this recipe,I'm glad because I have made some pretty crappy crock pot recipes that sounded great! Followed recipe pretty much but added 1 can of pineapple(with juice),1/4 cup of honey,corn starch at end to thicken. Used about 8 thinner boned pork chops but cut off bones almost like strips of pork. Had it over brown rice with green beans will definately make again

Sooooo good! Changed the amount of soy sauce to 1/4 cup. Still a little to salty for me (I also omitted salt). I cooked in on High for 2 hrs, then Low for 2 hrs. Meat was very tender and juicy. I will definitely make this recipe again!

My family RAVED over this.  Like others, I added a squeeze of honey and used less soy but otherwise didn't change a thing.  House smelled heavenly!  I served with brown rice and steamed broccolli and cinnamon apples.  A winner!

I gave this three stars because nobody really liked it. It was just ok to us. But I was thrilled that the calorie and fat in this was very low. Idk maybe I will play with it and see what I can come up with?

My kids really did not care for this one....."too soy saucy" was the quote from my almost 13 yr old. Hubby and I thought it was pretty good. Used a small pork roast .....kinda dry though.  Added extra bbq sauce to moisten it more. Probably wont make again if the whole family wasn't thrilled.  Thanks for the post.

Followed the directions and it came out almost too salty to eat...good taste but overpowering.  Will try again with LOW SODIUM soy sauce.  Other than that it would be 5 starts.  Adding a bit of honey sounds good too...next time.

Absolutely delicious, did follow the ther users reviews and cut the soy sauce in half. I added spicy sriracha chili sauce to give it a kick. Even my 4 year old loved these very tender chops.

I've been doing this for years!! Use only Campbells Cream of Mushroom Soup, No other soup tastes as good.  You can also make it fast in a skillet. Fry prok chops and pour the soup over it and heat..Not as tender, but very good!!

My husband and I loved this! I followed another reviewer and put 1/2 a cup of brown sugar, ketchup and soy sauce, 2 cloves of garlic minced and pepper. I marinated the pork all day while at work then once I got home, baked it in the oven for about 30 mins or until pork was tender. Served it with potato bites, bell peppers and mushrooms :p Yummo!!

I did not like this, I felt it was too salty even though I used low sodium soy sauce and omitted the salt.  My husband thought it was just ok.  While this was not entirely inedible, I will not be making it again sorry.

I made this tonight with the modifications that most suggested. 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1/2 cup ketchup and brown sugar, sprinkling of ginger, and because we love garlic I did four cloves instead of two. Unfortunately, the pork chops were so dry they were almost like beef jerky! I cooked this on low for 6 hours and had very think pork chops. Must have been to thin. This sauce is great though, and we plan to use it for ribs. Was great over yellow rice.

This was delicious! So easy to prepare and the whole family enjoyed it- even notoriously picky kids. My husband and I are glad to have a recipe that 'flavors up' pork chops, in a healthful way.

I know this had many good reviews but we found it much, much too salty - and I even used low-sodium soy and added no extra salt.  The porks chops were tender but the sauce made them almost inedible.

My husband and I did not enjoy this recipe.  I cut back on the ground ginger to 3/4 t and it was still way too over powering for me.  The pork chops were dry and not tender.

These were a hit with the family! I thickened the sauce with a bit of flour and water--rich! I also added sliced onions at the start of cooking and browned the chops on both sides after sprinkling grilling spices on them. The chops were done sooner than 6 hrs., but I had them on medium setting. I will definitely make these again, and I may try using honey instead of the brown sugar as several chefs have recommended.

Very good.  I did make some changes as some suggested.   I probably doubled ketchup & brown sugar....  I also added honey over the top because  I thought the soy seemed a little overwhelming.  I cooked on high for 2 hours and low for 2 and stired around a few times.   They came out very tender and tasty.   Everyone liked them.

Excellent recipe with very little prep time and effort.  As others suggested, did half soy sauce and half honey, a little more ketchup and brown sugar.  I used 2 bone in chops and 4 boneless, thought it gave it a nice extra flavor.  My husband and son raved. This will be a regular.

Very tender. I only used to pork chops, and cut the soy sauce in half but left all other ingredients the same.  Cooked on high 90 minutes then low for 2 hours.

My husband and I are not huge pork chop fans, so I was looking for a recipe that would make them more appealing, and this one definitely does! Like others, I omited the ginger and doubled the sauce. I added extra ketchup, red pepper flakes and chopped onion. I cooked an additional two hours (8 total), and served the sauce over steamed broccoli, carrots and rice.

These were delicious! I did alter it a little. I added some honey and 2 cloves of garlic. I also doubled the sauce recipe! When the pork chops were done I added a little cornstarch to thicken up the sauce. I served it over rice and it was excellent!

So easy to make and they make my house smell delicious! I changed the recipe a little bit to only use brown sugar and bbq sauce. I mixed a brown sugar bbq sauce and a honey bbq sauce together and just let them cook. My husband said they are the best pork chops he has ever had!

Excellent!!  The only thing I did differnet was to leave out the ginger becasue I don't care for it. Next time I think I will only use 1/4 cup of the soy. I served with rice and poured some of the sauce over, very good!!

I did not change a thing and this was really salty for me. I"m only giving this 2 stars bec of how easy this was. Maybe with low-sodium soy sauce it would have turned out better.

Great!  I only had two chops, so I made the sauce as is (except reduced the soy sauce to 1/3 C and added dried habaneros) and put a bag of frozen veggies in to help soak up the sauce.  Insanely good!  The chops were moist and tender after five hours on low heat.

I liked the taste of the sauce, but I found my boneless pork chops came out a bit dry.  I had to add water and vegetable broth to the slow cooker to make sure the meat was covered, but I used reduced-sodium soy sauce so I didn't find it overly salty.

I cut the soy sauce in half and it was still salty for my taste.  The pork fell off the bone but it was pretty dry.  Not a bad recipe but I don't think I'll try it again.

I used equal amounts of lite soy sauce, catsup, red wine, and brown sugar. I seasoned the chops with montreal steak seasoning and browned them before putting them in the crock pot. I left out the ginger and the extra salt. It was still too salty for my taste but made the house smell wonderful. My picky teenager loved it but picking out the bones was a bit much. If I try this again I will use boneless pork. The sauce was great with jasmine rice.

This was fantastic.  I broiled thick, boneless chops on each side for a few minutes, then placed them in one layer (oval crock pot) and poured on marinade.  When they were done I put them on a foil covered sheet and put extra marinade on top and broiled for a few minutes again so they got a really glazed finish.  Raves all around.  For a side dish, I laid long peeled carrots on top of the chops while they were in the crock pot.  So great - my daughter said we should have them for dessert!

This was a good recipe. A tad bit salty, and I typically love salty. If I make it again, I will reduce the amount of soy sauce. I'd recommend making this. Yum!

Other reviewers were correct about decreasing the amount of soy sauce. I decreased it by half, and still found the chops to be very salty. I will probably make this again, but with adjustments. It did go very well with the Restaurant Style Fried Rice (also on this site).

Made a few changes... added 1/4c honey and cut the soy sauce to 1/4c(used lower sodium). Make sure to use really thick chops... mine shrunk. I tried to thicken the sauce but it was still pretty thin, but very good! Next time I might use a pork tenderloin.

This recipe took no time to throw together -- a definite crowd pleaser and time saver. I used 1/2 C of each the soy sauce, ketchup and brown sugar, added garlic and omitted the ginger (simply because DH doesn't like it) and these turned out FABULOUS! The next time I think I will cook on low for the entire time, as I cooked on high for a few hours and then on low, and found some of the chops a bit dry. Those on the bottom of the pot, however, were just ridiculously yummy! I served these with candied sweet potatoes in a brown sugar/maple sauce, which went perfectly.

Very good...definitely a keeper!  I had 4 boneless pork chops that were not very thick, but they still turned out great and were done in 3 hours on low (my slow cooker is new and seems to cook things through quicker than expected).

Although I do not care for recipes that include ketchup, this was fantastic! I started off with pork chops that were frozen solid and cooked for 6 hours. I did follow the other suggestions as well. I made the following changes 1.)1/4 cup honey 2.) used low sodium soy sauce and only 1/4 cup 3.) decreased the amount of ketchup by half 4.) used the ginger, but forgot the garlic 5.) double the amount of the sauce 6.) added corn starch to thicken. I used thin sliced chops, next time I will definately use a thicker cut. My entire family loved it.

Delicious! I took the advice of others and cut the Soy Sauce in half (actually I used Worcestershire because it was what I had in the house).  I added about a half of cup of white wine, doubled the ketchup, threw in a generous squirt of honey, then topped it off with sliced pineapple.  I had not planned to cook it the full six hours, as others said the chops come out too dry.  Unfortunately hubby came home late.  I would really suggest cooking only 4 - 5 hours.  The sauce was marvelous over rice!!!!  This is a definite keeper!

I doubled the sauce (except for the soy sauce), only used 4 pork chops, added a little honey and these were great!  They were even better the next day as sort of a pulled-pork sandwich.

I had 4 boneless pork chops and they were done after 4 1/2 hours in the slow cooker on Low.  I followed the recipe as is, using low-sodium soy, and thought the flavor was good but the sauce turned out kinda runny.  I was going to thicken w/ water/cornstarch mixture but we just ate as is.  I would make this again...easy,no effort needed dinner for "the other white meat"!

This was ok. I made it for Sunday nite dinner and it's more like a weeknite meal to me. The sauce was a lttle to salty for my taste (I followed the recipe)but used 50% lower sodium soy sauce, and it was a little too sweet also.The meat was tender. Would I make again probably with adjustments for personal taste.

This was great!
  I cooked it for about 5- 5 1/2 hours on low. It really was tender and fell apart. YUM!
 Following other recommendations, I added some honey and cut down the soy sauce. I also added some sliced mushrooms an hour before it was finished- I might saute them first next time. I served it over some steamed rice and am happy to have leftovers!

I'm giving this 4 stars only because, for some reason, the chops were tender but dry. Next time I'm going to only slow cook it for half of the time & see what happens.

Fantastic recipe... not five stars because the chops were dry but I really think that it is next to impossible to get tender chops out of a crock pot.  I did double the sauce - had 8 boneless chops - cooked on high for about 1 hour and low for 2-3.  Followed the recipe except for:  added two big squirts of honey and halfed the soya sauce filling up the other half with water.  Will definitely make again and try with chicken too!

YUM! This was very good. However, next time I make this I will definitely reduce the amount of soy sauce as it was pretty strong for me. Also, I would suggest not adding any more salt. The soy sauce and ketchup are salty enough. And I think I will try some honey added in next time too, as I was wishing it were a tad sweeter.

I'll give this a weak four stars. I just didn't find it that appealing although my husband liked it more. I did use low sodium soy sauce. I added a bit of onion powder, garlic powder and worcester sauce.  It was ok. What bothers me is it is the same recipe as Peking Pork Chops other than this one has one extra clove of garlic.

Good! I followed the recipe to a T. The sauce was great, the meat was a bit dry inside after my 8 hours but dunking it back in the sauce for each bite was divine. Served with veggies and mashed potatoes, terrific dinner!

I used pork shoulder as opposed to chops. As others have reviewed - I doubled the recipe but kept the soy the same amount. I didn't use any salt and layered the bottom of the crockpot with onions. I kept the crock on high for 3.5 hours, continually flipped the pork over and basted it with the juices. For the last 1/2 hour it was on low. I served this over brown rice. This recipe is a keeper for my house.

Combination of a few things may have resulted in the chops being a little too dry. First off, I went with the only chops in the case - avg 1/2 inch thick. The liquid in the crock did not cover the meat and I cooked them on low for 6 hrs - resulting in dry meat. To fix this next time, I would assume thicker chops, a little more sauce (to cover?) and maybe check them at the 4 hr mark. Great flavor though - reminded me of baked beans..

I used 4 frozen boneless chops and cooked them on low for 4 hours. The flavors did not mesh well in our opinion. Althoug very tender these were dry (not moist at all); even after doubling the sauce. They look good but I wont make them again. I really wished this recipe would have worked out =o(

This recipe is delicious!  My husband is a very picky eater and he loved it!  I served it with egg noodles served with some of the sauce from the meat.  Very simple for a quick meal. It is not necessary to add any additional salt as the soy sauce gives it plenty. We will definitely be having this again soon!

delicious. doubled sauce but listened to others and left soy sauce at 1/2 cup and ended up adding about 1 cup orange juice and a couple of worcestershire sauce shakes of the bottle. also put bed of onions under chops. should be just enough sauce to cover everything. pork just fell off bones...did i mention delicious?

I'd like to thank you very much for your recipe.  It went very well for the people of my family.
The only thing I have writen (to remind myself) is cut back on the soy sauce.

I also doubled the brown sugar and ketchup. I did have to omit the ginger (I am pregnant and cannot stand ginger right now!) But it still turned out wonderful. I did use country pork ribs and they were so tender after about 2 hours on high and then 2 more on low. We will continue to use this recipe.

My husband loves it, and my 2 toddlers did also. I'll be using this recipe more often. I didn't have fresh garlic so I used a tsp of powdered, and I added a tsp of lime (lemon will do too) juice to add a little tang. It was great. Thanks a bunch,
Cheers
April!

Wish I read more reviews before making this recipe. I cooked the pork for 6 hours and they were horribly dried out. The sauce was overwhelmingly soy sauce. Couldn't taste any of the other flavors. Always looking for an easy slow cooker recipe, but will not try this one again.

I doubled the sauce like other viewers said. I thought that the flavor was good but a little too salty because of all the soy. Next time I will decrease the soy and add more ketchup and maybe some beef broth. otherwise-pretty good.

Good flavor.  Not really enough sauce/marinade and I only used 3 chops.  I cooked on low for 4 hours and they were borderline dry.  Next time, I'll cook for 3-3.5 hours and add some dark beer.

Very flavorful sauce. I omitted the ginger because I did have any in the house. I added a couple of tablespoons of honey and a splash of orange juice. I also added thinly sliced onions. The pork chops were a little dry..I think I will use a thicker piece of meat next time.

This was a really delicious recipe!  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and changed the recipe slightly.  I reduced the soy sauce by 1/3 and added beer instead.  I also cooked the chops for 4.5 hours.  They were very good!  Thanks for the ideas!

The whole family loved this, including the kids.  However I would recommend using a smaller amount of ginger,, but that's just my personal preference.  The pork chops had a great flavor and it was a very easy recipe to prepare.

Did what others said, cut soy sauce in half, added honey and a little EVOO.  I also cooked it only 3.5 hours. Served over cinnamon Jasmine rice.  DELISH!

Quick & tasty. I added a little extra liquid (beer) and some honey. It was a little too salty. I'll probably use less soy sauce next time.

The flavor of these pork chops was great but I did find they were dry, even though I added 1 cup of chicken broth to the slow cooker. Whoever came up with the idea to use honey was right on. It goes nice with the pork.

My family loved this!  I used 1/4 c. lite soy sauce and 1/4 c. water as Suzanne Largey suggested.  I omitted the salt and cooked it for 4-1/2 - 5 hours.  I made gravy and served it with mashed potatoes.  Thanks for sharing, Will.

I made this recipe and the taste was terrific but the pork chops were so dried out that it was a crime.  I cooked them on low for 6 hours and did everything the way I was supposed to but they were just incredibly dry. The taste was great, but I would not cook the chops for that long in the future.

I used very very thick chops and they were so tender. I served this with rice after I thickened the sauce a little. I also used the honey as the other poster had suggested. I will for sure be making this again.

It was good. The gravy is not thick so I added about a tablespoon of cornstarch to the crockpot in the last 30 minutes of cooking time.  Also, I reduced the soy sauce by half and added 1/4 c. of honey as others suggested.

I didn't care much for the soy sauce taste but the rest of the family loved it so I will make it again.

Per the other posts, I cut the soy sauce in half and we added 1/4 honey.  Everything else was about the same.  We used thick cut boneless pork chops, stuck them frozen in the cooker, on low for 6 hours.  They came out a little dry, needs LESS time, by about 2 hours in my book.  Flavor of sauce was very good, but (as noted) the sauce was VERY thin.  Added corn starch to thicken it, so we could cover the chops, it worked.  We will do this recipe again, but less time, and cornstarch in with the sauce for the last 30 minutes.

These were pretty good. Easy, no fuss recipe.  Like others have mentioned, the sauce DOES cook down quite a bit, so be mindful of that when/if you're planning to use it for any of your sides.

I guess I'm in the minority here, but these were pretty dry after only 5 hours in the crockpot and no one in our family liked them. The flavor just wasn't good at all.

This was pretty good. The only thing i didnt like was i served it with white rice and the sauce was so thin, it just didnt work together. The meat tasted good though. I gotta figure out how to thicken the sauce if i make this again. maybe it would be good served with boxed pasta on the side and just throw out the sauce.

I enjoyed this one, but my boyfriend LOVED it.  Raved about it!  Would recommend with rice.  We followed the recipe pretty closely, except I didn't have the ginger.  I added a little extra honey (as others recommended).  I used the recipe-given amount of soy, and it worked for us.  But, we are big soy fans!  I will definitely make this again, because it was a hit with the boyfriend.

Absolutely succulent!  The kiddos gobbled it right up.  Even my husband who eats out in a lot of fine dining restaurants for his work, said that this was definitly on of the top 10 meals he's ever had.  Goes well with the red skinned garlic mashed potatos on this website.

We really enjoyed this dinner. The only thing I did different was I added some chunks of peeled apple the last hour, very complimentary. I will try the low sodium soy sauce next time, it was a bit salty for me. I served it over brown rice pasta and salad. Thanks!

I was in a BIG hurry and did not have time to read the other reviews so I made the recipe just as listed - no modifications suggested by other reviews. Was delicious! I used (4) 1" boneless porkchops that were frozen solid and topped with the remainder of ingredients - used reduced sodium soy sauce as that was all I had on hand. Cooked on low for well over 8 hours. The chops were very tender - no knife needed. Loved the flavor. Will make this again? Got any chicken recipes Will???? Thanks!

Chops turned out great. I have a smaller slow cooker, so I halved the recipe. Didn’t have brown sugar, so used coconut sugar. Will definitely be making again.

Soy sauce and ketchup (actually, MOST condiments) are already really high in sodium.so I opeted for low sodium varieties. Since I actually wanted spice, ginger isn’t enough of a kick, so I added   Sweet Chili (Thai) sauce and BAM, there wa the kick. 

Generally I dislike reviews that say they made a recipe after messing it all up, but before this was even cooked it was just ok, but I already had the sauce prepped . 

Also, ALWAYS sear your chops before putting them in a slow cooker. You want that color, that sizzle fat, and the fond flavor which you just don't get by slapping them straight in the crock. This isn’t’ bad, but probably won’t go in my regular rotation,

This is simple and delicious.  Don't cook for the full time as they will over cook and dry out.  I cooked mine 3 hours on low and was still well over 145 degrees, but they were moist and tasty.  I also decreased the soy sauce to 1/4 cup.  I will be making these again.

Someone recommended to cook I t for four hours on high instead. But I put mine for three hours. It was still getting dry.  Looks like it only needs two hours. But it tasted really great, thank you.

WOW!  This was amazing.  I’m not a big ketchup fan so I cut that in half and used honey for the remaining 1/8 of a cup. It gave it a gorgeous glaze. I also added 2 tbs red chili paste as we like our food spicier. Strangely, it barely raised the heat...but that FLAVOR ??!  My husband asked me to keep this recipe!

This was excellent! Full of flavor, easy to make and fun to eat. The only change I made was based on the other reviewers and I reduced the soy sauce and added equal parts of honey. The only drawback with this recipe is that it didn't make enough gravy; once you taste it you will want more! I paired it up with rice, collard greens and fresh corn on the cob...yum!

OMGOODNESS!! I made no changes to this recipe other than doubling it.  It turned out so well, I fixed mashed potatoes for the men in my family and rice for myself.  I am not a big pork fan, but this was Super good and so tender I could cut the chop with my spoon!! Make this recipe without adding or subtracting and you will not be disappointed!

WE loved this recipe, I had 2 bone-in thick pork chops and was looking for something other than barbecue. I copied some other reviewers and reduced the soy sauce by half, added some honey and I used more ginger. Cooked 6 hours on low they were perfect, tender but not falling apart..I will definitely make this again, maybe with country style ribs.

I would not recommend these pork chops as a stand alone meal.  Put them over some creamy mashed potatoes (or starch of your choice) and then you have a winner.  The flavors are so strong that you really need something mild to balance it out.

I made very few changes from the original recipe.  I increased ketchup to 1/2 cup.  I didn't have fresh garlic so substituted garlic powder.  Pork chops were  boneless and thick so used only 4 rather than 6.  Recommend cooking for 8 hours if using boneless.  I served over stir fry rice.  Leftovers were just as good.  I cut up the pork chops into bite size pieces, covered with the sauce and heated in oven at 325 for half hour.  My husband and I agreed they were even better as leftovers because the meat soaked up more of the flavor from the juice.  A winner at our house!

We did not like the sauce at all!  I was very disappointed.  Could not even eat the pork chop and almost scraped the entire meal.  My husband grinned and beared it though.  This is the first recipe from AllRecipes I can never recommend.

I made this and it turned out great. I used 4 thick chops and cooked it on low for 6 hours. The only changes I made were I used less soy sauce and a little more brown sugar and honey. They were moist and were still great the next day as leftovers for lunch.

It turned out soooo good! I used slightly thin chops and I was afraid they wd turn out tough! They were so easy to cut.. very tender and I will try thicker chops and I now have a 6 quart slow cooker to spread the chops out.. my 4 qt , I had to make 2 rows of small chops. Delicious and easy to prepare!

Beautiful.  I used pork chops with the bone and it still tasted ok (just had to pick out the bones)  I put in a bit of my home made chilli to give it a kick.

My husband said it was a keeper.  I substituted half the soy sauce with honey as other reviewers did. It was easy and tasty.  We had rice with it.

Tasted ok but didn’t look anything like the picture!
It was creamy yellow not the brown as shown .  Using the cream of chicken soup, should have been a give away.  Will not be making it again.

Easy prep following the recipe. Flavorful and goes with a variety of sides. The only negative is that the end result is pretty dry.

I made this yesterday for the first time.  I used one half cup of soy per the recipe and one half cup of brown sugar and ketchup per suggestions.  At first bite I thought it was great.  But I soon realized that it was way to salty.  The proportions were wrong.  I intend to make it again using only one quarter cup of soy sauce.  I think that will do the trick

Yes...lower the salt and soy.  I used pork steaks [more marbled] and tougher,  but come out juicy and tender...also much cheaper.  Will not have the dryness others complained of.  Good recipe thanks, just tweak a bit.

I added chopped onion while it was cooking.  Best chops we ever ate!  I wouldn't cook it all day, even on low, as they were overdone, still wonderful.  Kind of like a chinese dish because of the soy sauce.......

I made this dish,  followed directions from some of the others, kids loved it. The only difference was i added a teaspoon of chopped jalapenos to give it a little kick. I will make again.

This was excellent, but way too salty.  I should have known to eliminate the salt.  The chops were very tasty, moist, and it was one of the easiest recipes I have ever made.

I only made 3 servings in a small slow cooker. I would only cook maybe 4 hours as they were a little dry. The flavor was great though.

I added honey and a little crushed red pepper. Doubled the sauce ingredients. When the chops felt soft I took them out and cut into bite sized pieces, threw back into the sauce and served over white rice. An excellent recipe!

Delicious!  served it with whipped potatoes and applesauce.  Would only cook for 4 hours on low.  Also, added about 1/8 cup of water to mixture.  Did 8 boneless 1" chops.

I made this one time for  new friends.  It was not at all a good choice on my part.  It was incredibly dry, and overly salty.  I was so very embarrassed, I would have taken it off the table and served sandwiches, but I didn't have any lunch meat.  I will NEVER make this again.  I do love this website as I have found so many great new recipes, this was not one of those.

I've made this recipe a lot. It tastes really good and very easy to make. I don't use the ginger; in my opinion, ginger has a lightness to it that goes better in desserts. Without it, the sauce is richer. I use the same measurement for all the main ingredients; the brown sugar, soy sauce and ketchup all get a 1/4 cup (or 1/2 cup depending on the number of chops). This recipe is great for using little effort, but getting lots of flavor.

This recipe is excellent as is with pork chops. Tender, juicy and great taste, enjoyed by our 2 and 4 year old grandchildren et all! We have also used this recipe for a small pork roast....with excellent results, again kept the recipe as is.

I followed the directions exactly. There was too much ginger. The sauce was too thin and not enough of it to add to the rice which I made to go with the porkchops. The chops still had to be cut with a knife and were not very tender.

My husband and son devoured it! I made slight changes.. 1/4 cup soy and 1/4 cup raw honey. Omitted salt and cut ginger to 1/4 tsp. Absolutely delicious! Thank you.

This recipe was really good!  I doubled all of the sauce ingredients except for the soy sauce, although next time I might use the full amount...One suggestion, use a good name brand Soy Sauce.  They tend to be less salty than some of the store brands.

Taste was ok, but OMG was it salty, and I didn't add salt at the end.  Suggest low sodium soy sauce at the very least.

Didn't know you could burn food in a slow cooker.  Leave it to me lol.  My pork chops were black as coal and all sauce dried up.  I followed recipe exactly except I swapped honey for half the soy. Not sure what went wrong.  Maybe I should have doubled the sauce recipe.

I made this over the weekend and it came out perfectly. I cooked in on low for 4 hours, which I feel like could have even been 3 to 3.5 hours. I also followed a previous posters suggestions and used the following: "I used 3/4 cup each of brown sugar, soy sauce, and ketchup. Then I added 1 Tbsp. of minced garlic, 1 tsp. of ginger, 1/2 cup honey, and 1/2 cup of chicken broth. Before the last half hour, I removed the pork chops and whisked in 2 Tbsp. of corn starch, put chops back in and let it simmer to thicken up the sauce." My husband also really enjoyed this dish, will be making it again.

Used 6 boneless pork chops and should have doubled the sauce, but still came out delicious!  Also, had to use tomato sauce instead of ketchup (I did not have any) and increased the brown sugar by about a tablespoon.   Thickened some of the sauce in a small pan on stove with cornstarch to put over chops.   Served with a wild rice, biscuits, and roasted carrots with honey-butter sauce.  Served 5 adults - comment: Really tasty!

The sauce was really good. I took some of the others reviews and added pineapple and cut the soy sauce down. I also got the thicker cut of pork chops, and only cooked it for 4 hours, but the chops were still super dry. Might try again with chicken thighs instead.

Would love to give this 5 stars, had to execute too many changes though. Omitted the salt,  used low sodium soy sauce, added apple cider vinager, molasses and white pepper. My tip; taste the sauce before you add the chops, that way you can control the taste to your preferences. Will make again, my way.

I added some carrots and leftover pineapples atop the pork chops, in the slow cooker. I then served it with steamed rice. It was absolutely delicious.

if I made it again (unlikely) I will use way less soy sauce and put a couple of tomatoes in the blender instead of ketchup.  even in the slow cooker it was dry and needed more moisture.

This recipe sounded great.  I followed it pretty much to the T.  The pork chops came out so dry, and the sauce/gravy looked nothing like in the picture shown.  It was less like a dark gravy, and more liquidy ketchup broth.   Also looks in the pic like the chop was browned or fried first.  So mine needless to say looked nothing like what I was expecting.  All in all, disappointed.

We loved the final product, however that was with some minor changes so this rating is based on the original recipe. I would give the original 3.5.  I added more garlic, used liquid aminos instead of soy, but only 1/3 of a cup.  Added the 1/4 c sugar, 1/2 cup ketchup, but some of that was sriracha to give it a little kick.  Used everything else but the salt.   I used thick frozen pork chops, so it need to cook on high most of the day.  The sauce was watery thin, so I did thicken it up with a TBSP or so of corn starch.  Served over rice.  The sauce was similar to bbq sauce.

I was hoping that this would solve the problem I have with pork chops coming out as hard as a deck of cards but no. The sauce was fine; a bit more soy than my taste cares for but that could be adjusted. Maybe chicken thighs would be a better choice for this recipe?

Delicious and best of all..my teenage son wants me to make it again. I added honey, cut back on the soy sauce and left out the salt and pepper. Next time I'll try cooking it for 5 instead of 6 hours as it was a bit dry. BUT this one's a keeper!

This was underwhelming. It's not "bad," but not likely that I will make again.

After reading some of the reviews I did decrease the soy sauce to 1/4 cup;  didn't have ground ginger or whole ginger so omitted that ingredient. I also added chili garlic sauce for some pop. This recipe turned out amazing as declared by my family! Don't be disappointed by the amount of the sauce as during cooking more liquid from the pork chops will add to the sauce. Will definitely be making this recipe in the future!

Delicious and tender! We did not have any ginger or garlic on hand so those 2 ingredients were omitted. Even without  these two items, this recipe gets a 2 thumbs up.

Used 3 frozen boneless pork chops, decreased the soya sauce to 1/4 cup and kept everything else the same. The white meat part of the pork chop was very dry but the dark meat was pretty good. My son suggested using ribs next time.

Makes tender pork chops with a decent sauce.  But it was pretty salty and the predominate flavor is the soy sauce.

Great recipe. Very quick and easy. The pork chops were so tender that I shredded them and stirred them into rice. When my wife took some leftovers to work, all the ladies wanted to know were she got the Chinese take out from. We'll be making this again tomorrow.

Made this for my boyfriend. He said the sauce was really good but he said the pairing with pork chops wasn't that good. He said he'd like to give it a try with beef tips or a beef stew and served with noodles.

I followed the recipe and wasn't thrilled with the outcome. If I did it again I'd use bone-in chops as the boneless were dry and not as tender as I expected. Also, cut back on the soy or use reduced sodium as it was too salty.

I followed other reviewers suggestions, and it was delicious! Will definitely make again. Here were my changes.
1/4 cup of soy sauce
1/4 cup of honey
1 tsp salt
1 tsp pepper
Everything else stayed the same. I marinated it overnight, dumped in the crockpot the next day, cooked for about 4 hours. 2 big, thumbs up!

Turned out great.  Super easy and tasty.  I followed the other reviewers suggestions to reduce the soy sauce, increase the sugar, and add honey.  Also didn't add any extra salt.  I even used frozen pork cutlets with no problems.  Do watch the time though, it was done sooner than expected.

I would add a little bit more garlic, to be able to taste that aspect a little more. I used lite soy sauce for a little less sodium.

I will definitely make this again.  I followed the instructions and after the chops were done cooking I transferred the liquid from the crockpot to a sauce pan and reduced it a little to thicken it.  Topped chops, rice and broccoli with pan sauce.  DELICIOUS!

The flavor was good, but it didn't really penetrate the pork chops, just coated the outside. They were also a bit dry. I omitted the salt because I thought salt plus soy sauce would dry it out, but just the soy sauce was enough to do it.

Followed the advice from the reviewers, and reduced the soy sauce by half and substituted sugar with honey. I'd reduce the amount of ketchup next time.
Cooking time needs to be significantly shorter. Mine was done (already a little dry in texture) in 3 hours, and any longer than that it would have been very dry.
I thickened the sauce on stovetop with flour and poured over the meat before serving.

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used 1/2 c soy sauce, 1/2 c. Ketchup, 1/2 c. Brown sugar. I also added minced garlic,  about 1T of honey and fresh grated ginger.  I poured it over 4 center cut loin chops in the slow cooker and cooked for about 6-7 hours on low. I thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch and served with steamed fresh broccoli over rice. I thought it was a tad on the salty side so next time I'll use a little less soy but all in all it was a very nice change of pace for a boring 'ole pork chop. Will definitely make again.

I made some adjustments after reading comments: I sauteed the chops  at first with a tbls of olive oil. I also used fresh ginger and added a pinch of chili. As I was out of brown sugar,  I replaced it with some normal sugar and maple syrup instead. I also halved the amount of soy sauce to 1/4. Instead of increasing the ketchup/sugar amount, I kept them the same and just poured a generous splash of red wine and a bit of water in the pot. The pork came out superb: tender and moist.

Made this on 2/6/16 for Dinner. Delicious. I did bone in and would suggest thin pork chops.

Everyone in the family really liked it, and we have a bunch of fussy eaters. The pork chops did remain a little dry, but we just put some of the left over juice on it, and it was wonderful.

I'm rating this a 3 because I made changes, but it is a good base recipe.  I used 4 large boneless pork chops, reduced the soy sauce to 1/3 cup (and used the low sodium kind), and added 3 tbsp of honey.  Everything else was as written in the recipe.  Cooked on low for 2.5 hours and they were all registering at 145 degrees already, so I turned off the slow cooker.  We ate about an hour later and the pork was not dry, but I'd say it was slightly over what I'd normally cook it to.  Sauce was delicious!

this recipe is really good. I've made it a few times. However, I've had to reduce cooking time and temp in the crock pot. the chops always come out so dry. next time I'm going to try marinating them in the sauce and bake them in the oven.

Made this, and made a few alterations.  First, I used 1/2 cup of soy sauce, 1/2 a cup of ketchup, and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I used the ground ginger as stated in the recipe, and added 1/2 teaspoon of sugar.  Came out really good.

I followed the recipe exactly. I use thick cut center boneless loin chops. The chops were tender, but dry. The sauce ended up tasting like a mildly Asian BBQ sauce and was OK. I will not make this again as it was not a hit at all with our family.

I made this last night for a family of 6. 3 out of six liked the sauce but 4 of the 6 did not like the chop. They are kinda  picky like that when I change menus up. The smell of it cooking was not all that great. The taste I personally think was okay but not to die for flavor. It was fork tender I give you that.

I followed the recipe exactly. Smelled delicious! Sadly, the chops came out stringy and dry, the sauce was too strong...kind of a vinegar like taste.  Would never make it again. Luckily the rice and broccoli sides were great!

These were very good. I was not able to use thick-cut pork chops so they became too tender and fell off the bone so munch they were hard to scoop out of the slow cooker in tact. If using thin cut chops,  the cooking time could be reduced. However, the sauce was incredible. I'll make this again!

I've only made this once but it is going in the regular rotation! I did take the advice of another reviewer and did 1/2 cup each of the soy, ketchup, and brown sugar.  I used 1 1/2 tsp minced garlic that I already had in the fridge instead of dicing the cloves.  And finally, I left out the salt and ginger.  We all loved this dish, even my extremely picky 6 yr old!  Served it with rice, vegetable medley, and apple slices.  It was delicious and incredibly easy!!

The only thing I did different was cook for 7 hours on low (I have a newer kitchen aid slow cooker and it doesn't cook as hot as older slow cookers) and I used Lite Soy Sauce. This was delicious, easy to make, and tender!!!

My husband loved this! I made it with skinless chicken thighs because they were on sale.  After reading the reviews, I decided to cut the soy sauce in half, and I used low-sodium soy sauce. I also added an equal amount of honey, and I doubled the entire sauce ingredients. I will definitely be making this again! It was great mixed with white rice, and steamed carrots on the side.

I liked it! I tripled the sauce rations because I like a lot of sauce and used 8 chops. Only thing I changed was I added a splash of mirin to add more Asian flavor and also cut up 2 small onions which was a good idea because they caramelized nicely with the sauce. Warning: it can be salty, so don't add extra, the soy sauce is enough. I think editing the recipe by adding water or substituting honey might not end in as good of a result, as it is really the marriage of the sugar, soy and ketchup that makes a good base for this sauce.

I made this recipe scaled down to two.  I was lazy and didn't add a minced garlic but put in garlic powder instead.  Also, I had no ketchup so I used Diana's sauce instead.  Oh yeah, I added some cornstarch to it an hour before it ready to thicken the sauce.  It was very nice!

I didn't read reviews. Reduced soya by half and subbed in sodium free veggie stockto make the amount of liquid equal. Instead of katsup I used the same amount of tomato puree, this gave me control over the salt. Then I checked the slow cooker after 4 hours they were done, then thickened the sauce with a bit of cornstarch. The taste was O.K.

I loved this recipe, but my husband and son were not wild about the sauce. It is very strong, and if you aren't a big fan of ginger, you won't like it. The meat was VERY tender though!

Sauce is very tasty. Took the advice of other reviewers and cut back the soy sauce to 1/4 cup, added 1/4 cup honey, increased ketchup to 1/2 cup and used fresh ginger.  I like this recipe and will try it with chicken next time.

I was worried when I read the recipe but I and my family loved this. I followed reviews and used honey instead of brown sugar and low sodium soy sauce.. I didn't have ginger. I seasoned boneless chops w/ garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper.   Cooked on low for 6 hours which was too long. That was their only gripe.

Too Salty! Was embarrassed but my family made it thru.  I even left out the Salt/pepper portion due to the soy sauce.

Try it with 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar instead of 1/4 cup ketchup.

I really, really loved this recipe! It was a great hit with the family! I did make some changes after reading reviews. I did 1/4 cup of 'soy sauce' instead of 1 cup. I was actually out, so I used a teriyaki (with pineapple) marinade. Yum! I also used 1 cup of brown sugar. I used minced garlic, 2 tbls. And I suggest DOUBLING the recipe if you do more than the 6 pork chops which, I had to do. I served them on top of white rice, and the sauce was an awesome flavor to it. I did cook it for about 4 1/2 to 5 hours instead of the six and it fell apart. I'm thinking of using this sauce the next time I make a pork roast :)

Oh my goodness these chops were seriously good! 
I used thick, bone in chops and 6 hours on low was perfect. I thickened the sauce and there was plenty of it. Served with mustard mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables. Yummy!

This was fantastic!! I have never been able to make a pork chop that you can cut with a fork, until now! I didn't change a thing except I cut the chops in half. Awesome recipe, i will use this often.

More like three and half stars. I used loin chops, boneless. I wish I used a sirloin chop because the loin was way too dry. The pork was completely submerged in the sauce, and it fell apart after being cooked, but chewy dry. It was cooked in two hours on low, so I kept the slow cooker on the keep warm setting for another two hours and ate early! The sauce was good, according to some reviewers they added water, but I would not do that! The sauce was a perfect thick consistency as written, the slow cooker adds moisture so no need for it! I added some onion slices, a dash of sesame oil and some hot chili sauce to taste.

Instead of brown sugar, I use 1/4 cup of peach preserves. Double the ginger and make it freshly grated. Used pork ribs instead of chops.

The most tender pork chops I have ever had! I should have listened to a few of the reviews and cut the soya sauce in half, I found it a bit too salty but not enough to give this recipe a bad review. We used boneless pork chops and cooked on low for 8 hours, incredibly tender! Great recipe but definitely cut the soya sauce in half and add the honey as recommended by others.

Followed the recipe exactly. We really enjoyed it, the chops did fall apart as some have said. The sauce was delicious, and feel it would be an excellent start to a meatloaf... I may try that next time, or perhaps a roast, as it would tenderize even a tougher piece of meat in a slow cooker. One thing extra I did, was slice some potatoes and carrots and put them in a steaming basket above the chops. They were an excellent addition and the sauce was excellent over the veggies...even my 4 year old ate them with the sauce.

My wife enjoyed it but I found the chops dry and overcooked. I used several suggestions from the reviews- honey, garlic, no salt, etc. Probably won't make this again.

I was a little worried after reading some of the negative reviews, but a few modifications (suggested by other reviewers) made this great. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup ketchup, a good helping of crushed garlic, no ginger, and no salt. I sprinkled pepper and garlic powder on the 1-inch thick chops and seared them, set them on a bed of coarsely chopped onions, poured the sauce over and set it on low for about 5 hours. The chops were tender and moist. The sauce is delicious and, as other reviewers have pointed out, very good over rice. Though I didn't try it, this would be very good with pineapple. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was easy and I had everything on hand to make it.  I did use 4 bone-in pork chops though instead of boneless.  I changed a few things.  I omitted the ginger and salt as suggested by other reviewers.  I used 1/2 cup each of brown sugar, soy sauce, and ketchup with the usual garlic and spices.  It had all the makings for a good meal but we didn't like it at my house.  The left overs were too sweet.  If I ever make this again I will use boneless chops and add some salt.

The flavors in the sauce were very good, but the pork chops were way too dry. I will try this recipe again because of the flavorful sauce, and reduce the cooking time.  Hopefully that will improve the results.

Tried this recipe a couple of nights ago.  I only had spicy flavored ketchup so I used that.  It was really delicious and I will definitely do this recipe again, but maybe with a few chopped onions.

Very good.  I did take one other reviewer's suggestion and added a little honey.  I would recommend however, to start checking the internal temperature of the chops after 3 hours on Low, because it won't take 6 hours for these to cook.

I used two 1" boneless chops and made the full amount of sauce - only deviation was I coarsely chopped the garlic otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  These smelled so good while they were cooking but probably should have served them after they cooked for 4 hours because after 6 hours they were really dry.  The sauce gave the chops a nice flavor but was not enough to get past the dryness.  Might try this recipe again but will shorten the cooking time.

I followed this recipe exactly.  It is delicious.  I used bone-in chops.  You just have to be careful not to overcook so that the chops don't fall apart.

I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1/4 cup honey.  I also used boneless chops, cut into 1 inch cubes.  After the meat was done, I added pineapple chunks and steamed broccoli to the meat and sauce.  Served with Easy Pilaf rice recipe from this site.  My family loved it.

The chops cooked nicely, but there was a taste we didn't like at all. We think it was the ginger. I might try it again w/ out the ginger.

I use this all the time for country style pork ribs. I sliced an onion up and put in with it as well, then use the sauce after cooking over rice to go with the meal.

I made this recipe exactly as i read it and the pork chops turned out dry and it wasn't the flavor my family savored. They were okay, probably won't make them again.

Overall not a bad recipe mine came out super tender to the point which they were falling apart which was good... They reminded me of the pork you can get at Asian restaurants.... But I still think the best way to eat any pork chop is grilled... Personal opinion though these are simple and easy and turn out great though

I thought this recipe was very good but my outcome was a little dry.  Maybe I should only cook until tender, but done.  Also, maybe a little less garlic.

This is our new favorite Pork recipe! I'm so glad I discovered it here. It's easy because it uses ingredients that were already in my kitchen. I did substitute "Gourmet Sauce" for the soy sauce. It is tender, moist and delicious!

This is definitely a keeper, and could it be any easier?! I made the recipe exactly as written except used fresh ginger, and slow cooked for 8 hours. I might cut down on the soy sauce a bit next time as suggested by others to eliminate some sodium. My boyfriend really loved this despite making a face when I mentioned pork chops. He was thinking of the dry, baked kind from childhood and these were anything but dry. Melt in your mouth delicious! May also try with a pork tenderloin sometime.

"Mama, I LOVE this!" Even super picky hubby said it was a make again. I followed the recipe exactly and was the only one in the family who thought it was a bit salty. I am definitely making this again, but reducing the soy sauce a bit next time as other reviewers have suggested. My coworkers raved about the good smell of my leftovers that I brought for lunch the next day.

I made this almost as written. I discovered I didn't have pork chops so I used a pork roast. I doubled the sauce, everything but the soy sauce, left that as is. Don't remember how long I cooked it as we had something come up and had to eat earlier than when it would be ready. So when we got back home, hubby discovered it was still cooking and we let it cool and put it in the fridge. 2 days later I reheated it for the family and served with rice and green beans. Everyone LOVED it. I will make it again, hopefully we will eat it same day I make it.

Yummy! But I did double the sauce recipe (except for the soy sauce. For that I kept it at 1/2 cup and used low sodium). I also left out the salt - it is definitely NOT needed since the soy sauce (even low sodium) adds more than enough saltiness. I have made this twice, once with the brown sugar and once using honey instead. While I personally love honey, I did prefer the brown sugar in this recipe - but that's just a personal preference.

Yum-yum! I prefer teriyaki to soy, so I used low-sodium teriyaki reduced to 1/4cup. Following the other earlier comments, I added a couple spoons of honey, and a splash of chili paste. DEFINITELY omit the salt shaker. I used a sprinkle of Montreal seasoning, but I may try a pinch of Chinese 5-spice next time. Next time will include some onion, perhaps pineapple juice-pack, and possible a big splash of rum. Saltiness can be reduced further by use of low-sodium ketchup.i

Great recipe! I pan seared the chops before putting them in the slow cooker and the chops were "Self Brining". I added a little Sirachi sauce to the mix and it was a hit! They only need 3 hours to reach 145*, keep an eye on them.

This is was just okay. The meat was fairly tender.  I did do what others said by using 1/4 honey and 1/4 soy sauce, but it still isn't something I would make again.

Taste-wise, this is just pretty good (as long as you cut the soy sauce by half and add honey) but it is so quick and convenient, and the meat was so tender, that I will likely make it again. It paired well with rice And steamed broccoli.

This was by far the worst meal I ever made.  Never again.  Meat was completely inedible.

This is the best pork chop recipe I have ever tried. I had three pounds of sirloin pork chops, so I doubled everything except the soy sauce. I also put in three teaspoons of ground ginger and a little liquid smoke. Amazing!

I did not care for this recipe. After reading the reviews, I had great hope for this recipe. The pork was so dried out and the sauce was too salty (with no added salt, only the soy).

Very easy! I cut down the Soy Sauce as others suggested to 1/4 cup instead of 1/2. I didn't have fresh garlic so I used a little bit of garlic powder. I used bone in pork chops and they were so tender after about 4 hours that they fell right off the bone. Definitely recommend this recipe.

Really easy, really good.  The soy sauce and garlic reminded me of adobo.  I may have cooked too high/too long, little chewy but overall moist with a nice crust.

Put these in the crockpot just before 9 this morning.  Even though they were still a little frozen when I started them, they were ready to eat about 1:30.
Didn't thicken the sauce.  Did double the sauce.  
Four people at our table choose to have porkchops, including a 6-year-old and a 4-year-old, who both had seconds.  And, now they are all gone.

The flavor was great, the sauce comes out like a water substance If you want to use it as a glaze you will have to thicken it up. The meat was fork tender and real easy to eat, but my husband thinks the center of the meat was still a little chewy. All in all a great recipie. I will definatly make this again.

Not bad! I added honey per some of the other suggestions & also cut up the chops into small cubes. I also added a bag of frozen broccoli to the crockpot for 2 hrs before serving. I serve over rice. The water from the frozen broccoli made the sauce a little thin, but I added some cornstarch to thicken it back up. I have made this recipe a few times & for some reason it always tastes a little different each time. Easy crockpot recipe for a lazy day!

From other reviews I opted to double the sauce, I added the soy sauce slowly and to taste (using reduced sodium ss) I did use less but not drastically less.  Its definitely needed to balance out the sweetness.  I also added a sprinkle of crushed red pepper flakes. We served it over rice and some edamame and a salad.  Good, easy supper.

This was a great recipe, quick and flavorful.  I doubled the sauce and halved the soy sauce.  Perfect.  I added a bag of frozen veggies at the end of the cooking time and served over rice.

We really loved this dish. I served it with brown rice and broccoli. I did double the sauce and I cooked 12 pork chops! I did use 1 cup brown sugar, 2 cups soy sauce and added 2 sliced green peppers and one sliced onion at 3 hours cook time.  I cooked it for 6 hours on low total..is probably cooked at 5 hours though. It was VERY good. I also seasoned pork with SYM (Slap Ya Mama) seasoning.

Excellent.  I did add honey and a bit of corn starch(to thicken) and doubled the sauce.  I used bone in pork chops.  Next time I will use boneless just because I have small children and the meat falls off the bone and leaves small pieces of bone in the sauce.  Very delicious!

I was very disappointed especially after all the rave reviews.  My pork chops burned and were very dried out after only 5 hours on low.  I only made 4 chops and used more sauce than the original recipe - i followed one of the other reviews that stated 1/2 c each ketchup, brown sugar and soy sauce.  I was not home, otherwise I could have stopped the cooking sooner and maybe they would have been salvaged...they smelled good, but ended up in the trash :(

Delicious. Cooked for exactly six hours and served over egg noodles w/homemade bread. Fall off the bone tender. I followed the directions except I used only 1/3 cup soy sauce. Thank you!

I thought this was just okay. The pork was tender....but the ginger was WAY too much!!!!! If I ever make it again I will skip the ginger.

We made this the other day -- doubled the sauce and made a couple changes as per other reviewers suggestions... and while I have to say this was SO not to my taste at all (and the pork chops were overdone, even though we had nice thick Omaha Steaks chops in this recipe) -- hubby liked the sauce enough that he shredded the dried out pork chops and saturated them in the sauce.  He claimed to really like it (but didn't bother putting the leftovers away for tomorrow -- which to me speaks volumes) - Probably a good recipe if you can get the right cook-time down, but for us this is one we won't be making again (sorry!)

We all really enjoyed this recipe. I doubled the sauce to make sure that the chops were all covered in the crock pot. I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of honey. I also forgot to add the ginger, but didn't feel that it was particularly necessary. The sauce was really thin, but delicious. I'll definitely make this again.

Pretty good.  My husband liked and had two chops.  I added some frozen green beans about an hour before it was finished and served it with rice.  Not the best I have ever had, but will definitely make again.

My 13 year old said it was the best meat I ever made.  I did make a few adjustments.  I cut the soy sauce back to 1/4 cup per other reviewers and I didn't use the ginger. I added about 1/2 cup of bottled barbecue sauce. I cooked on low for 3 1/2 hours.  I think any longer and they would have been dry.

Was very flavorful - my husband loved it! Used thinly sliced frozen pork chops and cut the soy sauce to 1/4 cup only.  Did not have any ginger on-hand, but it tasted fine!  The meat was very tender and fell apart when forked.  Tasted great with white rice.  Did not need the extra salt.  Next time I'll serve with some chilled pineapple.

This recipe was horrible. The pork chops were dry - my husband said it was like eating beef jerky. I am giving it one star because I didn't get the option for 0 stars.

Sorry - we didn't like this dish.  I am only so-so on pork, but thought this would be a nice way to prepare it.  It just wasn't my taste.  I thought the sauce didn't smell great, but it tasted slightly better.  My pork turned out a bit dry, so that was disappointing.  We won't be trying this one again.

I used this recipe for my first slow cooker attempt. After reading the reviews i used honey and added more soy sauce. It made my house smell great but my pork shops were very salty and hard. I'm not sure how to fix it as i'm just a beginner cook but I think I'll stick to the recipe next time. I'm giving 4 stars because I'm not sure what the actual recipe tastes like.

These were delicious but because my chops were on the thin side I cooked them  for 4.5 hours. Also I used only 1.2 the soya stated and the other half water and they were still a bit salty but was fine for me.

We loved this!  Bought super thick chops at Costco and simmered in slow cooker all day.  Resulted in a fork tender chop with a great sauce to pour over rice.

This was a good recipe for pork chops I added some veggies, onions, green pepper snap peas, carrots, peas, broc, ect and didnt use salt. I served with brown rice and as salad, poured sauce of rice and it was kind of like sweet and sour pork. Pretty good and easy to make.

This was an Awesome dish!!! I did tweak a few things though....I cut the soy sauce in half (!/2 cup low sodium by the way). I added 1/2 cup of honey and instead of plain ketchup. I used the new spicy ketchup by Heinz. Also I increased the brown sugar to 1/2 cup. The first time I made it I used bone in pork chops.....Not such a good idea!!! I had to make sure the bones weren't in the sauce by fishing them out when it was done cooking. The second time I made this I used a pork tenderloin......It turned out kinda dry. I think it was because I tried to cook it to fast. Overall....My Husband loves it and so does my 3 year old.....Will be a "staple" in my house.

I follow the recipe exactly and found that the sauce was way too thin for my taste,It would be better to just put a bottle of barbecue sauce on top of the chops intead, or add more brown sugar?? Although the runny sauce would be fairly good on rice. Chops were tender but dry.

If you are not feeling like putting in a whole lot of effort, this is a good recipe. Not great, but not bad. And it certainly is easy. Just not a whole lot that is really special going on here. Maybe fresh ginger rather than powdered would help... I may make this again if I am pressed for time, but it won't be in heavy rotation at my house.

I took some ideas from this recipe but didn't follow it exactly. I added the honey as suggested in the comments cutting back on the soy sauce, I also used a homemade tomato base instead of ketchup, added a bit of water and thickened the sauce with some corn syrup.

I used pork rib chops and it was moist and detaching from the bone by the time it was done cooking, I really don't know where some of the reviewers went wrong to make such a moist recipe dry.

Awful, sorry but true. So dry, I sliced them after cooking to drown each piece in sauce for some flavor. And the sauce isn't great either.

I took some other suggestions and decreased soy, increased liquid (used apple juice) added honey and more brown sugar - still WAY too much soy taste, for me.

Very yummy. The meat actually tasted like spare ribs with the sauce. I was actually in a rush and put them in mostly frozen and turned my slow cooker to high for 4 hours. I only did two large, thick-cut chops and they were cooked without a problem. However, next time I'd like to do them on low for 6 hours to see if I can get the meat to tenderize a bit more. All the same, a great recipe that I'll use again.

Absolutely great flavour. I removed the meat at the end and put the sauce in a saucepan and added 1 heaped tablespoon of honey and then thickened it over a low heat with cornflour and water. Once it was thick I poured it back into the slow cooker with the meat. Absolutely scrumptious.

My family and I loved the flavor of the sauce!  I used 6 boneless chops, lite soy sauce and doubled the sauce recipe.  I browned my chops in a little canola oil.  I sliced a small onion and put in the bottom of the crockpot, then put the chops on top.  I mixed the sauce in a bowl and poured over top of the chops.  I did not add water.  I cooked on low for 5 1/2 hours and...delicious!  My chops were not dry but fork tender.  The sauce even thickened as it cooked on top of the chops.  I served with brown rice and coleslaw.  It was a hit!  Thanks Will, I will make this again and again!

This was pretty good, a little on the salty side.  The chops came out tender and not dry.  I cooked them on low for 6 hours.  Next time I'll sweeten it a bit more.

I made this last night for dinner and the only change I made was doubling the liquid.  While the chops were very tender, they were way too salty.  I served it with white rice and sauteed pineapple chunks in a little of the sauce. I also poured some of the sauce over the rice which was a mistake. I would attempt to make this again ajusting the sauce using the suggestions of some of the other users.

This recipe was just OK.  I tripled the sauce since i was making 9 pork chops.  It was an easy recipe with common ingredients which I like.  The taste just wasn't great.

this recipe was not appetizing. The sauce was too salty. There wasn't enough sauce to make to make 3 chops so i don't know how the recipe makes 6. The time definately needs to be adjusted also. Needless to say the chops were dry, over cooked, burnt, and too salty. Definately read the review to adjust recipe and watch while cooking. DO NOT leave in slow cooker and go to work you will be disappointed.

This recipe is FANTASTIC and I have used it countless times and am always pleased with it!! I have given this recipe to many of my friends and family and they always love it too.

The only thing I do differently is I add about 2 tbsp's of BBQ sauce to the sauce and it just gives it that little bit of zing!!

I didn't care for this very much.  It seemed a bit bland and the chops were very dry.  My family seemed to like it more than  I did.  Sorry but I won't be making this again without adding a serious amount of seasoning.

I doubled the sauce recipe and kept a close eye on them as suggested by other reviewers. Still way too salty (and I reduced the soy sauce by half), and I just did not like the flavors personally.

Will not make again.

Really loved this recipe, my whole family did! Husband said were the best pork chops I ever made and my three old son asked for thirds! I did reduce soy sauce to 1/4 cup, but also doubled the recipe! The sauce was delicious, served it over rice! Is definitely one of my favourite crock pot recipes!

I made a few modifications which were delicious.  I sliced a red onion and placed it in the slow cooker, followed by the pork chops.  I also doubled the sauce, and used pumpkin pie spice because I didn't have any ground ginger.  The meat was very tender, and the onions really soaked up the flavor of the sauce.  I highly recommend this recipe.

I used only 4 pieces of pork, but it turned out very dried out after 5 hours. So I would defiantly keep checking for doneness. The sauce is good, but needs to make more.

We all loved this recipe.  I didn't have brown sugar so I used a couple of tsp of honey.  I only used 3 tsp of soy sauce.  I also used tomato sauce because of its high nutritional value and the ketchup.  Overall, I will definitely make this again.  The meat just fell off of the bone.  Very delicious.

Made this for the first time with company coming...making extra for leftovers...so much for that plan.  Did add a large onion sliced and subbed Splenda brown sugar for regular.  Had lots of juice to put over the brown rice I served along with veggies. The chops were fall apart tender and moist.  This is a keeper for sure...look forward to making it again soon.

Based on other reviews, I made some changes to the recipe.  I increased the ketchup to 1/2 cup.  I added 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce because I needed more liquid to cover the chops.  I did not add any additional salt, as the soy sauce is salty enough.  Finally, I cooked these on low for 3.5 hours.  They came out moist and tender.

Not as much flavor as would have liked.  Cut the cooking time to 3 1/2 hours.  Will keep as a back up recipe.

Sorry, I tried this but I was not as impressed as others.  My pork chops dried out, even when I doubled the mix.  I cut back on the soy sauce, but I think there was still too much ginger flavor.  I will not try this one again.

this was pretty good! but it didn't make enough liquid to cover the chops so i added water & chicken stock. afterwards i reduced the liquid to make a sauce. i would like to try this again w/ chicken b/c i am just not a big porkchop person but it did turn out tender and everyone liked it.

They were quite tender. My chops were thin so the cook time was slightly less. I, too, left out the salt (& pepper)but added a bit of water. It needs more liquid or they will dry out. I also substituted garlic powder instead of garlic cloves.

Our family did not enjoy this at all. I did not think the flavors blended well together and the taste was too strong. I also think the cooking time was too long as our pork chops were extremely dry. I won't be making this recipe again.

Very easy to make. Took the advice of others and used the honey and onions, very tasty however even though we cut the cooking time to 4 hours as also suggested the chops still came out a little dry. Will definitely make again but will cook for 3-3.5 hours instead. Thanks for the recipe.

These were o.k. but I was disappointed. I planned on 3 hours in the crock pot based on other reviews but mine were not even close to being done. I took my chops out & grilled them on the Foreman, thickened the sauce with cornstarch & served over rice.

I liked the taste of the pork chops, but the cooking time was a bit long. The pork chops were a little dry...I will definately use this recipe again and cut  the cooking time in half.

After looking at the previous reviews, I too cut the cooking time down, but after 2 hours the pork chops were already dry!  I also cut the soy sauce in half, added a cup of water and the marinade was great!

After reading the reviews, I used half soy sauce and half honey and cut the ginger in half as well.  I also doubled the recipe and it was barely enough to cover 6  chops.  Though extremely tasty, the pork chops were dry after 5 hours on low.  Will probably try it with ribs for a honey garlic chinese take out style rib next time.

my husband and i both liked the flavor of this recipe very much.  however, i made it with regular pork chops and shortened cooking time by an hour.  still, they were very dry.  i think you need thick-cut pork chops for this.  i'll try it again w/ those and get back to you w/ results.

I gave 4 stars for taste but the chops were very dry.  I know this was a complaint from some other reviewers but thought I'd make the recipe 'as is' the first time and then adapt if necessary.  Will definitely make again but will cook for much less time.  Thanks Will.

This was just OK, nothing great.  The flavor was good in the sauce, but the chops were very bland.  I might try again, but put the meat in the oven or use as a grilling sauce.

The family seemed to enjoy these tonight. I didn't eat any, therefore, I can't give my own personal opinion. I ran out of ketchup, so I used a small can of tomato sauce. I also used Teriyaki sauce rather than soy sauce. Everyone cleared their plate tonight!

This was great!  I used boneless pork loin medallions.  They were extremely tender & we loved the flavor.  I was leary at first, the combination sounded odd but proved to be wonderful.  The only thing I did different was cook them on high for 3 hours, then low for an additonal 3 hours.  This is a definite keeper!

My family likes this recipe. The only problem i have is that my pork chops always trun out too dry and we rely on the liquid to help.  I think I must be over cooking it in the slow cooker. I'll use low next time insteadof high. Taste like Chinese BBQ ribs.

MMMM!  Very tasty dish!  My kids LOVE it!  I wasn't sure of the combination of brown sugar and ketchup but I am definitely glad I tried it!  I will definitely make this again.

These were OK, but they turned out very dry.  Not as much flavor as I expected either.

I first made this recipe in a sauce pan real quick since I didn't have much time. I liked it. But when I tried to make it in the slow cooker it became much too concentrated and I really didn't like it at all. So I'd highly suggest the shorter cooking time.

First time I've cooked chops in the slow cooker and these were very good!  Even the children ate them up!!  Served with brown rice, cooked apples and green beans.  Thanks for a nice dinner.

This was a little salty for my family's taste, but it was a great recipe and the chops came out tender and moist.  Next time I'll try it with less soy sauce, or the lite kind.  Very good way to make pork chops!

I made this for my mother when she came to visit my fiancee and I. The pork was very tender; so tender that it fell apart in your mouth! But beyond that the recipe wasn't what we were expecting.  Everyone thought that it tasted heavily of the soy sauce, and I even cut back on the soy sauce after reading the other reviews.  Don't get me wrong...the pork was certainly edible, but the flavour just got to be soooo much! It was a decent recipe, just not something I'll be craving to make again.

I did not like this. Too sweet for my taste, although the meat was nice and tender. I will not make this again
