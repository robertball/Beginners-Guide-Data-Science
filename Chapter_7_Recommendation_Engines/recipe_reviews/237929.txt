Very lemony, so next time I will be cutting lemon juice at least in half and compensating with butter. But the flavor of the sauteed carpers in the butter sauce was amazing!

Delicious!  I breaded and lightly fried flounder to put this sauce on top. I made 4 servings of this recipe but used the juice of only 4 lemons. I added a bit of milk at the end with the cold butter and substituted dried thyme for the savory because that's what I had on hand. Yum!

Loved this sauce....  Used 1 lemon per reviewers and thought that 1 TBL of capers wasn't quite enough.  Will use more next time...  Used TJ's 21 Seasoning Salute in place of the savory....great flavor.  Now I can really enjoy cooking fish.  Much thanks to the chef for sharing.....so simple.

I made it with 1 large lemon since the mahi mahi was marinated in lime juice and it came out great! I didn’t have savory however I added dill. I will be making this for everything from now on!

Prepared this sauce for chicken. Based on others' comments, I used the juice of only 1 lemon, not 2, and added a tablespoon or so of sour cream.  It was delicious and received strong compliments!

Wow, way too lemony.  I don't mind lots of butter but it was too tangy for my taste but my bf liked it.  I think next time I will mix some sour cream in it for a milder flavor.

Perfect recipe - simple and delicious! I made it with swordfish accompanied by Jasmine rice and broccolini. My husband wants to put this in our rotation of great recipes.

Decided to tinker to make it a little less lemony. Tried a couple of tablespoons of sour cream doubled the butter and substituted thyme for savory.  Poured it over Halibut.  It was terrific and my hubby loved it!

Super yummy! The only changes I made were to substitute coconut oil for some of the butter and Bragg's Sea Kelp Delight because I didn't have savory on hand. Chef John is correct -- goes great with sole, which was exactly what I was looking for!

So easy and delicious on fresh, wild caught sockeye salmon! The flavors complemented the salmon and did not overpower it.  Also convenient because it uses ingredients we always have on hand.  I used a little herbes de provence in place of savory and it was just great.

I made this. Used it on halibut and liked it a lot. I'd probably dial down the lemon juice a bit when I do it next time.

Way too much lemon. Use only one lemon. I also used 1/2 cup of cream for a thicker sauce and 1/4 teaspoon of dillweed to give it a little kick. I used 2 tbps of garlic butter instead of regular butter and it was awesome! Great recipe on trout!

OH MY goodness this was delicious!! In the middle of a recipe I discovered my heavy cream toured sour i quickly searched for a caper sauce and came across this. I served the sauce over a lightly floured & seasoned chicken breast. I did not have savory so I used used fresh parsley. DEFINITELY making this again. Thank you Chef John.

Depending on how ripe your lemons are you may need to adjust the amount of lemon used to your liking.

Changes:
-Added more capers as I love them, and I did not smash them. I'm not sure why that would be required.
-Like others added a bit more butter, a full tablespoon (but in hind sight that may be why my sauce did not thicken)
-I added a couple tablespoons of mascarpone cheese to cut the lemon after a taste test. It really didn't do anything one way or the other, it just melted in like the butter.

Sauce has a great flavor but it was too runny, it never thickened. I'm sure there is an explanation from the butter I used to the changes etc. Probably the instructions to cooking the sauce need adjusted as well.

I made this recipe but then with less lemon juice-- I used about a tsp of bottled lemon juice.  I tasted it while cooking and just started adding stuff: I added a big splash of olive oil, some fresh thyme, and a splash of cream. It was big hit with the whole family. My husband and kids just had the sauce on fish, without the capers-- and my mom and I ate the capers :).

Very good, except as other reviewers said, way too much tart lemon flavor. I adjusted by halving the lemon juice, adding white wine, heavy cream, and sugar. Then it's so yummy, that I sop up all the rest with my French bread!

I have made this sauce several times following the recipe and it has become a favorite of my husband! The capers are the best part. It is especially good when served with chicken.

Love how simple, easy, and quick this recipe is to make. I use half the lemon juice and add white cooking wine.

Way too much lemon! Next time, I would cut the lemon in half or more. Otherwise, simple to make.

I thought this had about the right balance between butter and lemon juice, and the capers added nice undertone to the thing.
