I've been looking for and baking different coconut cakes for the past several months (including ones from FoodTV chefs) and I believe this one is the best. I did make a few minor changes, not so much in the cake but the frosting.  For the cake, I separated the eggs.  I added the egg yolks with the cake mix, but beat and folded in the egg whites once the entire batter was smooth.  It makes for a much lighter cake.  I also added a touch of coconut oil for a little more intensive coconut flavor.  I baked it in three 8" cake pans.  For the frosting, I used coconut extract and two tablespoons of the cream of coconut instead of the milk.  I added two cups of sweetened shredded coconut to the frosting.  Once it was set up (after refrigerating it overnight), I patted more coconut all over the top and sides.  It turned out so beautiful that my neighbors have put in their orders.  Thank you so much for such a wonderful recipe!

My first Coconut Cake. I felt like I was cheating with the cake mix, but I made this as a layer cake for my mom for Christmas. It turned out AWESOME! She said it was even better the next day. I used "Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting" Submitted by Tom on this website (LOVE this icing for many, many cakes) and I added the remaining cream of coconut to it. De-Lish!
Oh, by the way, cream of coconut is found in the mixed drink section of the grocery store. :o)
You should try this cake, you won't be disappointed!

People couldn't stop talking about this cake!  It's so moist (especially if you pour remaining coconut milk over warm cake)... I used only 3 cups sugar for frosting, and coconut milk instead of regular.  Also, added coconut extract to cake and frosting.  SO good!

This cake was absolutely divine with these changes:
4 egg whites, beaten (instead of 3 whole eggs) causes it to rise more. for the frosting i used 4 oz cream cheese and 4 oz butter so it wasn't too sweet. I also substituted the milk for leftover cream of coconut. You can never go wrong adding a little almond extract to any recipe. I baked it in 3 8" round pans. Came out perfect! Gone in no time.

What a delicious cake!  I made it for Easter and it was a hit.  I just made some minor modifications--I reduced the sugar in the frosting by a cup, used almond extract instead of the vanilla and put alot more coconut on top too.  I also added a little coconut to the batter too.  The cream of coconut and sour cream made the cake so moist and flavorful.  This recipe is a keeper!

I made cupcakes & they were wonderful. Followed the recipe except for adding 2 capfuls of coconut extract to the cake batter & one capful to the frosting. Had a noticeable but subtle coconutty flavor. Thsi was better than Paula Deen's coconut cake that I made last Easter...thanks! I was in a time crunch so I garnished very simply w/ a couple of jelly beans.

I made this as a layer cake for my 5 yr old's birthday.  FABULOUS. One of the best I've made, and I've made a lot!  This cake only got better after being in the refrigerator...(a great lunchbox treat).
Two things to be aware of:
  The batter proved a bit too much volume for the pans, so a little bit spilled over.  I cooled the layers and trimmed the lip that the spilling caused.
   After frosting, cake "settles" a teeny bit.  Probably because of the oil, coconut cream, and sour cream.  
   Since it was for my daughter, I left the top bare for a Barbie "frosting transfer", put the coconut on the sides, and added some Barbie pink and white heart sprinkles.  It was beautiful.

so, so, so good!!! I made this for an office party, and they cleaned it up! Definitely not for those trying to cut back on calories, but worth every bite as a special treat.  For a lighter version, instead of the frosting in the recipe, use Cool Whip Lite and stir in the shredded coconut.  Also, after taking the cake out of the oven, I poked holes in it with a fork and poured the remaining cream of coconut over the top, letting it soak in thru the fork holes.  Delicious!

Delicious! I made this as a 2 layer birthday cake and it was moist and still very light. I could not use the icing (too runny) so I made fluffy white butter cream frosting with almond and sprinkled coconut all over the middle layer, top and sides. Very pretty and yummy!

I followed the advice to add whites later and the cake is seriously light and moist, even on day 3!  While the cakes were still hot, I poked holes in it and spread on some of the remaining cream of coconut (found in the alcohol aisle at the grocery store). For the frosting, I used about 3 cups p. sugar, 6 oz. cream cheese, 1/4 butter, a little vanilla, about 1/4 cup cream of coconut, and 1/2 a container of Cool Whip.  It was great! It's calling me right now---I've got to go!

Very good! Super moist with a great texture, but not wet or soggy.  I think it is perfect with a bit of coconut extract added to the cake and the frosting. I use a slightly different cream cheese frosting with about half as much sugar and find that the tang compliments the sweet coconut very well. Makes very pretty cupcakes.

PERFECT! Now my official Coconut Cake [aside from Coconut Poke Cake]. The only subs I made was to add 2 tsp of coconut extract to cake batter as well as to frosting. I also LOADED the top of my 9x12 cake with tons of UNSWEETENED coconut which I just happened to have on hand. Soooooo delicious, moist, flavorful....it was hard not to eat more than one piece!

Cooked this cake for a family get together and everyone raved about it and they all had to have
a 2nd piece. The only changes I made was to add
more coconut on top of frosting and only used 3 cups
of confectioners' sugar. This cake is so easy to make and soooooo good! Thanks Corinne!!

This is truly a SCRUMPTOUS cake. My husband said he wanted a coconut cake for his birthday and this was succulent! For us, the icing was a bit too sweet and will change that a little the next time. This is my NEW FAVORITE.

Absolutly loved this cake! Im actually a bigger fan of chocolate cake,  but a coworker was having a birthday and her favorite taste is coconut. Yumm! I did as others suggested and used the rest of the cream of coconut as the milk in my icing. The only thing I will maybe add next time to make this recipe even more fabulous is a teaspoon of coconut extract for a little more coconut flavor.

Supper easy cake to make. I frosted it with the cool whip and pudding frosting from this site and substituted the left over cream of coconut for 1/2 of the milk in that recipe.

I followed some of the modifications suggested by others. With the cake part, I added the egg yolks with other ingredients and once batter was blended well added the 3 egg whites. It did make it much lighter. Once cake was out of oven, I made some knife slits and poured some of  the cream of coco over cake. Then, I used crushed pineapple on the bottom layer and frosted only top and sides. Cuts down on sweetness. I also used cream of coco in place of vanilla and only used 3 cups of confect sugar. Superb! People are still talking about this cake.!

Totally a five star cake. The only thing is I wish the cake had more of a coconut taste. I think the next time I will add coconut extract to the cake. This time I added almond extract which was good but next time coconut extract.

Fabulous cake in an 8" layer!  Chill frosting if it is too runny and it will thicken right up.  This is so fabulous that my son/DIL requested it as a tiered wedding cake.  It does NOT do well when you use a 10" or larger pan.  Add a few drops coconut oil to intensify the coconut flavor of the cake or frosting.  A definite winner in a regular size cake.  And absolutely super if you add a coconut custard filling!  Just don't count the calories!

I followed the recipe but I added an extra egg and made a rum glaze with some coconut cream and after the cake was done I soaked the cake in it. It was just amazing!!! topped it with chocolate ganache and shredded coconut. You should try the glaze, I used the glaze recipe from the rum cake recipe on this site, but added some coconut cream to it. Thanks!

This was the best Coconut Cake that I have had in a long time. The cream of coconut gave the cake a coconut flavor through and through. I recommend you try this receipt ... I certainly will be making it again.

This cake was easy to make and quick. I made it for a baking contest at work and decorated it with the limes as one of the pictures shows. I made 2 9 inch layers and they came out perfect. I also drizzled some of the leftover cream of coconut over the warm layers before they cooled. This cake won first place in taste AND in presentation. Great recipe!

I make this cake around the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays and fill it with the pineapple filling recipe from this site.  I always get rave reviews.  It even brought tears to my sister's eyes because it reminded her of Mom's coconut cake.

the cakes fell apart-thankfully the frosting glued everything back together.  I did not use cream cheese frosting-used buttercream which we all liked.

This cake fell into a million pieces when I tried to layer it.  For all of the effort it took, and for all of the shops I went to to try and find cream of coconut this recipe is NOT worth it.  I didn't even get to sample the whole thing all put togewther because the cake never made it that far.  Very dissapointed.

OOOOOH MY!!! This cake was a hit for me..I made it and then used the pineapple filling recipe in between the layers...TO DIE FOR!!! I didn't use the cream cheese frosting, because I was covering it in fondant.  What I did do, was put coconut extract in buttercream icing...:-)

Kinda disappointing. I made the recipe as written. I am giving it a 3 - lacked coconut flavor.It seemed all the flavor came from the frosting. Good for people who don't especially like coconut,I guess, but I love it & expecting a pronounced coconut flavor.It is a very moist & tender cake though. I wouldn't make it again.

I have to make this cake whenever there is a gathering. Everyone enjoys it!  I add the entire can of cream of coconut to the mixture. This cake is kid-friendly as well! When you make the cake, be prepared for people to ask for the recipe! :-)

Great cake! I made this for a birthday "luau" and it was a hit.  I did change a couple things to lighten it up a bit. I used a light coconut milk for the cream of coconut, and fat free sour cream. I baked it the night before and frosted it the next day. As another reviewer suggested I used almond extract instead of vanilla and used alot more coconut on top. Everybody loved it!

I made this cake in two 8 inch rounds.  I drained a can of crushed pineapple to put in between the to layers, then covered it with the frosting and the entire cake with coconut.  It looked beatiful and was great.  It even tasted better the next day.

I made the cake last night and put it in the fridge over night to cool it off.  But I also made three cupcakes with the leftover batter which were nummy!  The frosting was also delicious and very creamy!  I added a pinch of lime juice to the mixture to give it a little zing and I think it made it even better.  I havent' actually tried the two together yet (waiting for dinner tonight) but separately they are equally delicious so I know together they are going to be fantastic!  Thanks for the great recipe and my second successful cake! :D

Fabulous!  This is the best coconut cake I've ever had.  As another reviewer suggested,  I added a tsp. of coconut extract to the batter.  I will be making this cake again and again! Thanks Corinne for a great recipe!

Got rave reviews. I made one from scratch and this one. This one won the taste test from all who tried it. I did use a pineapple filling from this site and Rick's buttercream with coco lopez added.

I LOOOVE to bake and really dont like to use cake mix- i think it is kind of cheating ;) BUT i was in a hurry and figured that i would test this recipe out. OMG... it is FANTASTIC!  I used the exact recipe and used a whipped cream cheese icing that i added some coconut extract to make the flavor a little bit more intense.  it turned out perfectly!  and was quick and super easy!!!

This was delicious.  I fixed it for my husband to take to work and everyone loved it.  The only thing I would do different is the icing.  I would add butter to it and it would be like the traditional carrot cake icing and would cut the sweetness.  I loved the denseness of the cake--it reminded me of cheesecake.

Unbelievably good.  I made this for Easter and it went down a treat.  Be sure to get Cream of Coconut.  It's in the drinks aisle of your supermarket, it is used to make Pina Coladas.  Anyway, don't think you can sub out coconut milk because it's nothing like it.  Also the can of Cream of Coconut I got 16oz so after I used it in the recipe I brushed the extra on each layer before frosting.  Made for a bit of extra flavor as well as keeping the whole thing incredibly moist.  I made a 3 layer cake (there is more than enough batter here to do that with) and I toasted about a 1/2 cup of the shredded coconut and sprinkled it evenly between the layers and on top.

I am rating the cake only and it was excellent. I filled between the layers with lemon curd and frosted with Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting (on this site) sprinkled on top with coconut. Excellent. My standard coconut cake for now and forever.

We loved this cake!  I read a couple reviews and the one thing I changed was to use 4 egg whites instead of 3 whole eggs.  The cake turned out very soft and fluffy!  The icing is a bit sweet but it still tasted great!  I made 2 9in round cakes instead of the 9x13 as well.

I agree with the users who said this cake absolutely fell apart. Unless you just want to sit it on a plate and ice it and leave it at that, don't bother with this. It's more trouble than it's worth.

Very, very good! Followed the recipe exactly as written except I used coconut milk instead of cream of coconut (which I couldn't find anywhere). Added toasted coconut on top for a finishing touch. It was very moist, very delicate, and amazingly sweet. Perfect for families!

This cake was AWESOME!  For those of you that like light and fluffy cake, this is not for you as this cake is very dense.  Also, too much frosting overpowers the taste of the cake so I'd recommend starting with just a bit and adding more if you need to.  I did add about a teaspoon of coconut extract to the cake and substituted coconut extract (about 2 tsp.)for the vanilla in the frosting.  Fabulous.  Will make this one again for sure!

I made this cake for Christmas. Everybody loved it, but I was disappointed because I didn't taste any coconut. Because no one knew it was supposed to be coconut, they didn't know what to expect. The consistancy was great. I would make this cake again and pass it off as a white cake, not as a coconut cake.

I promised my father-in-law a coconut cake for Father's Day. I wanted an easy sheet cake recipe so I wouldn't be in the kitchen half of a day. This was the easiest coconut cake I've ever made and very moist & delicious. Everyone loved it...even the kids! My husband has already asked for another!!!

This cake was AWESOME! I made this cake for Christmas and it turned out really great.   I actually made 2 of these cakes. I made a regular 2 layer cake and then one with strawberry filling.  I followed the advise from some of the other posts and I am so glad that I did because it turned out delicious. I separated my eggs and added the egg whites at the end. I also used the remaining creamof cocunut in the icing. Everyone enjoyed this cake,  I will definitely will be making
this again.

Simple and amazing- It's a very "heavy" moist cake that was the hit of the party. I made 2 and layered- used the frosting and added dark chocolate chips, which were delicious- the sour cream and cream cheese ad a tartness that balances the sweetness.

This was a terrific cake.  Followed the recipe, except for following some others suggestions by adding vanilla to the cake, coconut extract to the frosting, substituting cream of coconut for the milk in the frosting and increasing the coconut and toasting it for the topping.  Took this to work to celebrate a co-workers birthday and it was a hit!

Wonderful Cake! Added 1/2 cup shredded coconut to cake batter and used whipped cream cheese frosting instead.  Made cupcakes with this recipe, and my family adored them.  Between sending to school / work and sharing with co-workers, they were gone in no time.

Delicious and Moist. Not quite enough coconut flavor for my liking however. I think next time I will add a touch of extract.

Cake was great, very moist. I added 1/2 cup flaked coconut and 1/2 t. coconut extract to the batter. The frosting was more of a glaze. I had to throw it out and start over with a different frosting.

Delicious cake!  Made this for my husband's birthday.  It's so moist.  I can't rate the frosting though (didn't have the time), I chose to use 2 cans of store bought vanilla and I added the rest of the coconut cream, coconut extract, almond extract and flake coconut.  That came out delicious.  Just the right amount of coconut.  I also chose to bake 2 8-inch cakes and then cut them in half (to have 4 rounds).  More space for frosting!

I'll admit it felt like cheating to start with a cake mix.  But this cake was wonderful.  I turned out of the pan very easy.  But, I did use a different icing from Coconut Cake I from Kathy.  It turned out beautiful and even traveled perfectly for an hour and a half car trip.

I made the mistake of using coconut milk instead of cream of coconut, thinking they were they same thing.  The cake was not as coconut-y as I was hoping but still incredibly moist and delicious.  Will definitely make again...with cream of coconut!

Perfectly Delicious. Took it out of the oven about an hour ago, and half of the cake is already gone. Made a change and used Coconut cake mix instead of white.  MM MM GOOD!!!

I give this one a 4 because it lacked a lot of coconut flavor. I used almost 2 cups of coconut cream in the batter but didn't taste or smell of the coconut flavor after it came out of the oven. Maybe I will use coconut extract next time.

As for making it directly from the recipe listed, this cake tastes no different than making it straight from the box. If you use just the coconut cream, sure it tastes good from the can, but it just gets so overwhelmed by the cake mix. I even tried putting it in the frosting (and I made a chocolate decorator frosting with some too) and I just couldn't taste it. I just don't think it's concentrated enough to use it as a flavouring in such small amounts with tons and tons of sugar just kind of ruining the flavour.

So, overall:  the cake was good, but hardly a coconut cake. Tastes nothing like coconut without modifications to the recipe.

I thought this cake was very average.  It tastes pretty much like the cake mix.  The coconut flavor almost disappears under the cake mix and frosting.  If you love coconut and want coconut flavor, use your cream of coconut to make pina-colodas instead.

Deliciously moist! I added 1 tablespoon of coconut flavoring to the batter and to the frosting. I also added chopped pecans to the frosting along with the coconut. I have been asked for the recipe several times.

my co-workers raved about this cake! I live at a high altitude, 7000 ft. so I added 2 TBS. flour and used 1/8 cup oil.  I used a bundt cake pan. made frosting with 1/2 butter 1/2 cream cheese, coconut extract and used left over cream of coconut instead of milk. I have made this twice with excellent results.

I've made this cake twice, most recently using a chocolate cake mix and coconut milk instead of cream of coconut. SUBSTITUTE COCONUT EXTRACT FOR THE VANILLA!It comes out beautifully no matter what substitutions I made. I made it in a bundt cake pan and split it and filled and frosted it. It made a really pretty presentation.

I used a different icing, but the cake was awesome. Great consistency, and the cream of coconut doesn't give it a coconut flavor, so it tastes like a great white cake. I will probably use it as a white cake from now on. I used a combination of light and fat free sour cream and baked in 2 9-inch round pans for a layer cake.

Awesome Cake!  FAST and EASY (My kind of cooking/baking.)  I have trouble with frosting cakes... so I made this into a bundt cake and drizzled the frosting over it (which meant that I had to cut the recipe in half for the frosting and used Coconut Rum instead of Milk... heeeheee).  I "SO" wanted to take the credit for this cake when all my friends raved about, it but I couldn't.......THANKS Corinne.

I thought the cake was very tasty, the icing was a little too runny.  I had to add more confectioners sugar & still had a hard time with it not running off the cake.  But it tasted very good.

Best coconut cake ever.  I made this for my husband for father's day.  The statement "Just like mama used to make" is the ultimate compliment and I got it for this cake.  A true traditional coconut cake.  My children, ages 8 and 5, loved the cake.  Flavorful, light, and easy to make.  I made it a two layer cake by baking in two 8 inch pans and it came out great.  The icing recipe gives way more than enough to give a thick middle layer.  I highly recommend it.

I have one question...why do all of the photos show round or square layer cakes when the recipe calls for a rectangular 9 X 13" pan?
Cake was delicious as a layer cake with icing inbetween the layers. I also made the switch of using cream of coconut instead of the milk in the icing.
Has anyone tried putting coconut in the cake batter?

Like so many recipes, the 5 stars are reviewing their own versions of the recipe, not the posted recipe.  As-is, the cake doesn't have enough coconut flavor, and two tablespoons of coconut  for the frosting turned out just as pointless as it sounds.  If you add coconut and coconut flavor to this, and better yet use a white cake mix (not yellow), you'll end up with a pretty good coconut cake.  But as is, this is not a great coconut cake.

This is the best coconut cake I've ever made. Made it twice already and today makes the third one in three weeks!  I made my own concoction for frosting of cream cheese, meringue powder, confectioners sugar and whipping cream and I must say it was some kind of good!  This recipe is a keeper!

I followed this recipe with the addition of a tsp of coconut extract. It was moist and dense, which complemented the coconut flavor. I also used Tom's whipped cream cream cheese frosting from this site. Will make it every year for my Mom's birthday. Everybody said it was the best cake they'd ever tasted.

I tried to make this cake for my daughter bday. We did make a few small changes. I added 1tsp of coconut extract to the cake and for the frosting we made cream cheese frosting with pineapple juice for a more tropical feel. I also made a pineapple filling from this site adding pina colada mix in place of the pineapple juice. I have been asked to make this cake repeatedly since. It was very moist and had a taste great for summer!!

This is a pretty sweet cake and I mean that literally, It was a little too sweet for me. Don't know if I will make this again. If you like really sweet desserts than this is for you.

I've made this cake a few times and it's been a hit. Yummy! It was a little tricky trying to find just "cream of coconut" so I bought coconut milk and skimmed off the cream, as best I could, and it turned out perfectly.

Ha!  I messed up and used coconut milk instead of cream of coconut.  It STILL came out perfectly!  Maybe not as sweet as cream of coconut, but very moist and yummy.

I dont know what I did wrong but my cakes didnt rise. It look like some one sat on them!  I cut the pieces up and called it a coconut bundt cake. The taste was great, but it didnt rise.

I really enjoyed this cake - it is light and fluffy and moist.  I beat 4 egg whites instead of the 3 eggs and folded them in at the end.  I did not like the frosting.  It was insanely sweet.  I'll use my own recipe next time.  I will probably add coconut extract to the cake next time as well since I didn't have a very strong flavor.

This was just ok.  The icing was slightly runny.  Had to refrig before using.  The coconut taste was mild.

The cake was great - good flavour and very moist. I didn't like the icing, but it's because of the modifications I made, not the recipe. I used the leftover cream of cocnut milk in the icing instead of reg milk and coconut extract instead of vanilla - tooo sweet! Way too sweet. Next time I'll stick to the recipe.

Really great, moist, rich cake. We had it for a birthday and everyone loved it - even my husband who is not a big coconut fan. (Didn't use the frosting recipe - made a lighter frosting.)

This recipe was excellent!! I made this for my husband's birthday cake.  He loves coconut so I made a couple of changes to the recipe.  I added coconut extract to the cake batter and to the icing.  I also mixed about 1/4 cup of flaked coconut into the icing and then toasted flaked coconut and put it on top of the cake.  I let it sit in the refridgerator overnight and it was perfect!!

I needed a quick coconut cake recipe since I didn't have the 3-4 days to make my usual recipe. Thought this was it, sounded great and thought I could pull it off with all the wonderful tips from reviewers, and incorporated a few minor changes myself. Was quite disappointed. If you like a real strong coconut flavor in your cake, this recipe is not for you. Even though I added coconut extract to the mix, and cream of coconut to the frosting and covered the layers with flake cocnut after frosting, it still only slightly resembled a potent coconut cake. It's a good idea, and very simple to put together but I will probably not make this again. I give it 3 only because the frosting was tasty.

Great recipe for cupcakes.  I made a few changes.  I used French Vanilla cake mix (it was all I had).  I added 1/3 oil, 1 cup Milk, 3 tsp. coconut extract in place of the coconut cream. It was yummy.

I am sure it is a good recipe, but I changed some things after reading some of the reviews.  What I made was great but didn't really follow the recipe.  I made the cake like the recipe said but also added coconut extract to the batter.  When the cake came out of the oven I poured coconut syrup on it.  Also I added coconut extract to the frosting.  So if you want more coconut flavor, that is what I did and it tastes like I am back in Hawaii.   I hope that helps.

I forgot the coconut cream so I infused evaporated milk with coconut.  This cake turn out great and the icing is fabulous.  I even baked it in a bundt pan.  Next time I will remember the cream but was just a very forgiving recipe and tasted great!!!

This cake was delicious. It was moist, but not too crumbly. I followed the other reviews and added about a teaspoon and a hald of vanilla extract to the cake batter. I also substitued the vanilla for the coconut extract in the frosting, and I also added about 1/4 of a teaspoon of almond extract. It gave the frosting a yummy nutty coconut taste.

This is a very good cake, however, several complained the frosting was runny. I used only 4 oz. of the cheese, added 2 T. of coconut cream instead of milk and 3 cups of the sugar,(sifted)  It came out perfect ! Also you can add some coconut extract if you want to. I added 1/2 t.

This cake was good but it does not store well.  I kept it covered in the refrigerator and it seemed to get very moist and heavy the next couple of days.  Maybe it needs to eaten up right away.
