I thought this was pretty good.  I did add some cream to the sauce at the end because there wasn't enough sauce for all of the pasta.  Even with that, I would probably double the amount of chicken stock next time and maybe thicken it a little to coat the pasta better.  The flavor combination of the pancetta, mushrooms, and shallots is really good.

After reading reviews, I still wanted to try this one. I rate it 4 of 5 because I , too, altered it but not as much as a lot of people did. I could not find Pancetta and did not want to travel across town to get it, nor did I want to use bacon (bacon makes everything taste like bacon). I did use a MILD, sweeter, thin-sliced country ham and that worked perfectly for the recipe. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly until the end. I didn't think the sauce would adequately cover 12 oz. of pasta so I added a tad more olive oil to the noodles and just before tossing the pasta and sauce, I added a can of Hunt's Diced Fire Roasted tomatoes, drained and straight from the can and mixed the parmesan with the pasta, too. I topped each portion with a little grated parmesan and crushed red pepper flakes. The pepper & tomatoes added more color and the oomph it was missing. I served it with a spinach salad and fried goat cheese and it was a great meal. I will make it again. I do have more advice--cook the noodles less than you would for al dente--do not overcook. This allows the sauce to mix well. Return the mix to the pasta pot (off the heat, of course) to let it rest before serving. Over cooking the pasta may be the reason many of the people are underwhelmed with the results.

This was very good! I don't think I cooked the pancetta long enough... I would reccommend cooking it all the way until crispy before adding the rest of the ingredients to the pot, but it was still good.

This was very good! I've made it twice and will make again. I also recommend twice the sauce the recipe calls for.

The flavor of this recipe wasn't bad but I ran out of chicken broth by the time the ingredients were finished cooking. I had to add another 1/2 cup of broth for this to be a sauce. Also, 5 shallots is VERY generous. I used 2 good-sized shallots & that was plenty.

Made it per the recipe and it was good but I think next time I will spice it up a bit and maybe add some diced bell peppers to add some color and some cream to thicken up the the sauce.  The pancetta was very tasty and my family enjoyed the recipe.  Its a good base recipe to then personalize for your own family's preferences.

Good but needed a few extras.Added more chicken broth and only used olive oil as needed.Also added a dash of non fat creamer and a squirt of anchovy paste.Decided to also throw in some cut up chicken thighs.I think red pepper flakes would be good if all of the people you cook for like spice.Save your pasta water to use instead of extra oil.

This was easy but, like other reviewers, just too much pasta for the amount of sauce.  To pep it up all it needed was a few hot pepper flakes (or to taste) and also a few chopped black olives. This, for us, is the answer so maybe someone else will try these additions. Otherwise it is a healthy pasta dish and a good submission. Thanks.

I added some broiled brocolli to it and served it with chicken in a sherry cream sauce with artichoke hearts and black olives. I agree that it doesn't stand alone, but an excellent side dish. Plus, adding some green makes you not feel so guilty about the pancetta!

I made this exactly how the recipe called for. I tasted it and I needed to alter a bit. Great basic recipe but it was too dry. I added in a bit more stock and some butter and some pasta water. That made a nice shiny glaze. It was so good.

I really liked this recipe.  There are a few things I changed...I didn't have pancetta, so I used some prosciutto that I had, which when added after the shallots and mushrooms were cooked a bit was awesome!  I also added red pepper flakes instead of regular pepper because i like my food really spicy :)

This is such an easy and delicious recipe.  I add peas at the end, and instead of adding more oil, I the liquid (not draining it). I also add a bit of salt. I just add the pasta to the other ingredients and it turns out great.  I make this once a week.

Pancetta has unique and bold flavor (and I don't care for it nearly as much as just regular bacon!) so I cut back drastically on it for this dish.  I used the rest of the ingredients "to taste" as well, rather than adhering to strict measurements.  I have to say it was the pancetta itself that was the only thing I disliked, but that is neither the fault of the recipe nor of the pancetta, just my own taste buds! I was to make this again, I'd use just a little bacon for flavor or maybe even none at all.

We made this tonight and it was excellent!  The only adjustment was I added more broth.  I also adjusted it to serve two which is a good thing or would have been tempted to finish it off!  My husband loved it and it was so quick and easy. Definitely will be making this again.

This was a great dish, while I reduced the olive oil & parmesan and used less bacon due to low calorie, it still turned out fantastic and is a quick and flavourful weeknight special we have once a month.

I made this recipe because I had the ingredients on hand.  WOW!  The first bite was okay, the second was better but left me with that "Something is missing. . . " feeling.  The third bite was better, and there was hardly any left by the end of it.  I think it could be easily jazzed up a bit if you added a few thinly sliced brussels sprouts, peas, or red peppers to it but that doesn't take from it being very tasty as it is.  Thank you for the addition to our "Must Make Again" recipe folder.

To reduce calories, I removed the pancetta after it was crispy, and cooked it in a new pan with the rest of the ingredients, adding sauteed garlic and onions to the broth. I also added chopped fresh asparagus to the pancetta while it was simmering in the broth. It added a subtle, fresh crunch to the flavors at the end--if you don't have asparagus, broccoli or green beans would also work well!. Simple ingredients but restaurant-quality flavors!

I didnt have pancetta so I used deli Ham, doubled the sauce and added a splash of cream.  It turned out great, though next time I think I will also add a little lemon juice and fresh parsley.  I felt like it really would have been more balanced with the acid.  Keeper!

This is so delicious and yet not overly flavorful. I doubled the bouillon an added milk to make more sauce as well as flour to thicken it. The bacon and mushrooms are delicious together! Oh and one last tip: sauté the mushrooms in butter first ;)

This was very good. Didn't have Pancetta so I used 4 slices bacon and 4-5 slices hot cappy , fried crisp. Sauted mushrooms then 3 shallots, 2 clove garlic. Added heaping teaspoon flour sauté couple minutes more. Then added chicken broth and pasta water. Then about 1/4 cup fat free half/half, 1pat of butter. I didn't have parmesan, but will use it next time.

I just made this...I used Brussels sprouts instead of the mushrooms. While the pancetta was cooking, I added red pepper flakes then the sprouts. I pretty much followed the rest of the recipe, except I just added the pasta to the pancetta and sprouts. I tried to make a recipe like a local restaurant's dish and it turned out great.

Love this meal. I sometimes tweak it by adding a little cooking sherry with the chicken broth. Either way, it's one of the family's favorites! (Eat with a crusty warm loaf of bread)

Loved this! Used turkey bacon instead of pancetta, added some cream to the sauce, and doubled the broth. I used red pepper instead of black. Delicious!

As a lover of mushrooms, I saw this recipe and had to make it. It didn't specify what type of mushrooms...I am assuming they meant white(?)ones, but I had a package of baby bellas (portobellas), so that is what I used.

The only change I made was to use 8 ounces of pancetta instead of 6 ounces. That is because the already cubed (yes, i am lazy)pancetta is sold in packages of 4 ounces and what was I going to do with the left over 2? 

It came out DELICIOUS. My husband, when I ask how something is, particularly a new recipe, will give me an "alright". So annoying. 

Well - He gave me a "really good".  Simple, easy and delicious.

On my second helping and will defo have to stop myself from having more[tonight anyway]!! Followed recipe almost completely... Had no linguine, so used fusilli. Think this turned out better because I also mixed the pancetta mixture in with the pasta; along with two chopped Campari tomatoes. Absolutely delish! The fusilli holds in the flavour better and I’m getting mushrooms, pancetta and tomato in the curls, with each bite! Yummy!

Recipe is very basic.  I sautéd the pancetta, shallots, mushrooms and spices in a good amount of EVOO.  I added garlic powder, dry basil and oregano.  Then I added 1-2 cups of pasta water to enhance the sauce.  Remaining drained pasta should be added to the sauce.  Mix and cook to coat pasta.  I then added a tbsp of butter to finish the sauce.  Plated and topped with grated Romano cheese.  Nowvitsvyummy.

I really liked this recipe. I did increase the sauce/toppings by about half and added some sun dried tomatoes. But, otherwise didn’t change anything. I will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

This was very good. My 93 year old mom loves pasta. I have never had pancetta. If I was prepared...I would have gotten some. I used reg. bacon.  This is a great recipe to add extra stuff to. Next time I’ll get some veggies in mom.

It was very flavorful, but the pancetta is expensive for 6 oz I paid about $23 just for the pancetta. I won't make it again because of cost. The pasta isn't out of this world so it was good to try, but not worth the cost for me.

It is a good base recipe, but I tweaked it for our taste.  I added zucchini and 1/3 chopped green pepper  to the sauté  mixture. Then added  16 oz can of fire roasted tomatoes  and about 1/8 cup of white wine  along with the broth.   I also used prosciutto instead of pancetta, because I had it on hand.   I cooked it covered as directed, then uncovered to let some of the liquid reduce, It had a great taste, but next time, I think I would add some tomatoe paste to make the sauce stick to the pasta better.  I thought about cornstarch, but that seems "wrong" when talking pasta. I used it as a side dish with pesto stuffed chicken thighs wrapped in prosciutto.  "Pesto Chicken" also on Allrecipes.

Usually use a 1 cup chicken broth just to give extra "sauce" and sometimes add 1/8-1/4 tsp of salt based on taste test.  Excellent recipe....we chop our mushrooms very small so as to "hide them" from some picky eaters in the family but the panchetta is so good, nobody minds if there are mushrooms.  We have also added shredded zucchini to the pan at the same time as the mushrooms to sneak some more veggies in there.

I used this as a basis to use up some things left in my fridge from the week. It saved me a trip to the store for supper and was very yummy. I had to make just a few substitutions and I did add some smoked sausage and asparagus. Yay for this app!

I made it with tiny modifications and it was AMAZING, but I can see why some people found it a bit bland. I added a generous pinch of spicy pepper powder. The spice brought out the proper flavors very wonderfully without making the dish actually spicy. I also used fussilli pasta; vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, and a different kind of bacon. I sprinkled some red pepper powder on top, as another reviewer suggested (okay, the reviewer suggested red pepper flakes, but I didn't have those). And I put the cooked pasta into the pan with the mushrooms and everything and left it there for the liquid to be soaked by the pasta, and the rest of it to evaporate. It was SO GOOD. So you should treat this recipe as a base to which you add things that you think are worthwhile - some suggested tomatoes, but for me spicy pepper does the trick.

Loved this recipe I definitely had to double the chicken broth but I used reduced sodium broth to make it a little healthier but turned out delicious

I made this dish tonight and LOVED it!  I had to omit the mushrooms, due to the family dislikes. Used 1 cup of chicken broth, added broccoli florets to the boiling noodles, so that we would have a veggie. Added two chopped chicken breasts after browning the pancetta, shallots, and garlic.  At the end, to make the sauce a little thicker, I added about 1/2 cup whole milk with a little flour. It was the perfect amount for a family of 4.

Just alright.  Not very flavorable.  Had to rely heavily on the parmesan for flavor.  I added peas for a little green.

My family really liked how light this dish was and yet exploded with flavor. The shallots cooked up so sweet. I used a full cup of chicken broth to ensure enough sauce. I am gluten free and thus must always cook up not only the regular pasta but also the gf variety. I wanted to have enough pan liquid for both pasta types. Definitely a repeat meal.

I agree with other reviewers that there's too much pasta. I used a tablespoon of dried oregano, twice the garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.

I love this recipe. Making it again tonight. Did not have scallions so I used some leeks. Still yummie. This will continue to be a favorite.
