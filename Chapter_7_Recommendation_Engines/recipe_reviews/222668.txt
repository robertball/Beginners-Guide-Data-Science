Note:  two 14oz cans of diced tomatoes works well in this dish (instead of the fresh tomatoes).  Lightly drain the tomatoes before adding.  The cooking time can be reduced this way.

My kids loved this and let me know we should have it again.  No complaints about the peas!  I went with the canned tomatoes, and I baked chicken breasts on the side and cubed them.  I went plus +50% on all the ingredients and that was way too much chicken, I ended up not using two breasts at all.

Very good flavours! The tomatoes lend sweetness to this dish that is very addictive. I ended up sprinkling a little more curry powder and garam masala because we like heavily spiced curries. Overall a very tasty dish and great for people who cannot take heat. But, we like spicy curries... so, if you do too, I would add cayenne pepper and possibly throw in some serrano chili or Indian chili powder for kick.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. My husband is allergic to onions, so we had to leave those out but it did not affect the dish at all. Served with aromatic white rice (a local Louisiana, made in the USA variety). I will definitely be making this again!

This was a tasty quick dish (I used cubed cooked chicken). This would be great served for last minute dinner guests and a quick family meal.

Yum. My toddler gobbled this up. This tastes strongly of tomato, but with a nice mild spiciness. I love the crunch of the peas against the softness of the chicken. Next time, I might add other veggies, like potatoes or cauliflower, and a touch of coconut milk or yogurt for some extra creaminess.

This was a very tasty dish.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added a dash of smoked paprika and used an 8 oz. can of Le Sueur peas instead of frozen.  I served it over Jasmine rice.  The dish definitely is better on the 2nd day.  I think it was missing something, but that could be because I really love spicy foods and was expecting more "kick" from the dish.  Next time I think I will add a minced hot pepper.

My husband and I both liked this a lot as written. It has a good mix of spices. A definite keeper. Glad to see itâ€™s easily made with canned tomatoes as well.

I followed the recipe using fresh tomatoes.  I added in sweet potato and some chick peas.  The smell was amazing however  it tasted a little bland.  Not sure what I did wrong.   I'll make it again but will have to play with the spices a bit to get more flavor.

I don't usually post but this is an awesome dish that the family loved! My husband, who would rather grill than follow a recipe, said it was easy to make (under 35 minutes)! Substituted chicken tenders (on sale this week); he added a few sprinkles of cinnamon and nutmeg; and served with jasmine rice; no cilantro (sold out). I found garam marsala for under $4 (4.25 oz from Badia) and I am sure it made all the difference - the house still smells amazing several hrs later.  Great to find a recipe that doesn't need any tweaking to turn out great - will make again & again!
