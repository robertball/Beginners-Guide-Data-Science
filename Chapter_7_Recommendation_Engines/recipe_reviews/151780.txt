I added 2 more slices of bacon and chopped ham. Because I added more meat I also added an egg. I topped it with shredded swiss cheese and chopped green onions on top after it was done baking and it was delicious!

I made this last night for a picnic dinner. It was very moist and tasty. Something that should be noted was that the puff pastry had to thaw for 40 minutes, so that threw off my timing, but it worked out okay. I used turkey bacon and skim milk to cut back on fat.

This was my 1st time making a quiche of any kind! My family LOVED it!  What I did different after reading MANY other recipes was I increased the two eggs to three, bacon to 6 pieces instead of 4, I added 1/2  TBS flour to the eggs and milk and added chopped green onion on top.  I made two at the same time and increased the final 30 minutes to 40.   These were devoured in 5 minutes or less and by extremely picky children (and one grown man as well!)  Enjoy!!

This was lovely and rustic looking. I wanted to prepare the puff pastry into a tart-like quiche, so I had to adjust the egg/milk mixture to a quarter (when using 1 puff pastry) and eyeballed the cheese but kept everything the same with an addition of green onions.

The sliced tomatoes on top gave it great flavor/texture.

I know this says its an English style quiche, while the inside ingredients are traditional of an English Quiche Lorraine, I have never eaten one with puff pastry.  The usual pastry is a shortcrust or whats know as pie cust here.  That being said this is delicious, the only thing I did find was that the mixture was not enough to fill my pan ~ so I did have to use 1 cup of milk and 4 eggs.  I did think that the oven was also too hot and in future I will cook this at 350 degrees for the full duration.  Ths is a great basic recipe and can be modified to use any ingredients you have too hand. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.

This was simple and a nice combination of flavor.  I plan on trying it with sausage instead of bacon for something different.  Reheated well the next day.

I've always been intimated by the idea of making a quiche, but this recipe was so easy.  My guests were very impressed (all French!) and it looked as good as it tasted.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe. My husband loves this recipe, and wants it more often than needed. The last couple of times we've made it, I added spinash and shredded carrots. The spinash caused it to be more moist than previously, but I've learned to leave it in the oven longer, as I like to feel like I am eating healthier. Yummy!  I plan to try some of the other suggested alterations as well. Can't wait to try it on guests. Thanks much!!!

So easy I made it in a 10” quiche pan just defrosted the sheet of puff pastry and pressed it into the pan. Pricked the dough. Had to make some substitutions: Didn’t have milk so I used sour cream and 3 eggs. Ditto cheddar so I used grated pepper jack and used  halved grape tomatoes just cut side up in the top layer of cheese. Delicious and puffed up beautifully. Don’t want to be one of those annoying people that does not  make the recipe my only point is using the recipe as an outline you can pretty much use up whatever is left in the refrigerator and it works great. Even the bacon I used was left over from the day before.
