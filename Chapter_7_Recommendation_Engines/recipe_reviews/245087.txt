The skirt steak turned out so tender and flavorful it really made the dish. I used castiron and sauted my onions and peppers and then removed. Browned my skirt steak to medium and removed. Then made the gravy in the cast iron pan. Made for less washing and likely improved the flavor of the gravy. I only wish My fries had turned out crispier but flavor wise, this is pretty high up there with poutine I had around Niagara Falls. Will definitely make this again and it may even be my new skirt marinade!
