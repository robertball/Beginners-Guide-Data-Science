Just not feeling it. I'm sure I did something wrong. Beans were mushy. Not like the picture.

This is pretty good, but could use some more flavor.  I added bacon bits, which definitely was good.

Cannellini beans break down too easily for a cooked dish like this, they go mushy FAST.  Cooking them for 25 minutes is WAAAAY too much and I had to adapt it quickly.  On top of that, this recipe was very bland.  I added more salt, some butter and I forget what else and it was STILL bland.  

I would not make this again.

Much better than expected.  Next time I'll add the tomatoes first then the beams as the beans becamea bit refried.

I really liked it! I just used less oil as I'm watching calories and it was still great.

Where did these flavors come from? There are so few ingredients, yet the dish is so wonderfully tasty! I doubled the recipe and made one exception. I used chicken base because I prefer its richness over chicken broth.  THE NEXT DAY, I added sauteed onions to the small portion that had not been devoured by my family. Lordy, Lordy... I will cook this dish again for the weekend --today is Wednesday! KUDOS to the contributor for this one.

Mmmm, sauteeing the garlic created a wonderful flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly and my beans turned to mush instead of looking like the picture.  It still tasted good, but I think I'll add the beans and tomatoes together and save myself 5 minutes of sauteeing.

This made a great meal for lunch. I made this along with a side salad. It was delicious! The only change I made was adding diced onions to the pan. Next time, I plan on making some garlic bread to go alongside this dish!

This is a great recipe.  I also added a shallot and some basil.  Delicious.  It is heartier than a soup, but not heavy at all!!  Next time I will use about half the amount of oil.
