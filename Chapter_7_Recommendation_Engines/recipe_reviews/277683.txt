My husband and I love it.  I added one more potato,  sauteed vegetarian bacon (I am vegetarian).  After all done I pressed the saute button again and added smoked vegetarian hot dogs.  Very yummy.  I love Sauerkraut, but never made it like this.  Very interesting flavor.

nobleredmond if you see this, yes the hard cider I'm referring to is the kind with alcohol such as Angry Orchard.

I am a HUGE fan of sauerkraut, and can't wait to make this.
However, I'm wondering what "hard cider" to use.
Is this referring to the alcoholic cider, such as Angry Orchard etc. 
Any advice is greatly appreciated.
Thank you!
