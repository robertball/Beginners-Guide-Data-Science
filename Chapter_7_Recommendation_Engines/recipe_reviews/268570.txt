Probably one of THE WORST recipes I have ever made. Did anyone test this before posting? I followed it to a "T". Even made the 3 ganaches twice because they were so bad: White chocolate was liquid, milk choc slightly more stable; bittersweet like mud.  Brownie cake hard as brick. COMPLETE WASTE of TIME and $$$.

Very good. I changed the type of frosting to Carolines Chocolate Fudge Frosting and it came out great.

I truly question how this recipe is on the back of a brownie box-it is seriously flawed.  If you follow the recipe, the whites chocolate ganache is like soup, the milk chocolate is ok, and the dark chocolate is too thick.  I was able to thicken the white chocolate by adding some powdered sugar while beating  it.  I added some milk to the dark chocolate to thin it while beating it.   Once assembled, the cake is extremely rich, no one could eat more than a few bites.  I would not recommend making this cake.

I'm a cake connoisseur and this cake was absolutely tops! Everyone thought it was exceptional and one guest (78yr old) said it was the best she's ever had in her life! There was definitely a difference with consistencies among the ganaches, but after refrigeration, they each worked out fine. I only had 9 inch cake pans so I increased baking temp to 350 and shortened time to 30 min. I wanted it real soft so, after chilled,  it would cut easily. It came out just so and I think the ganache even softened the brownie layers. I also reversed the order of ganache so I'd have white on the top to decorate. I wrote a happy birthday message on top with a bit of the dark chocolate ganache. It worked out great and looked fabulous. It was so divine but quite decadent and rich. Quite a simple cake but it will wow people!
