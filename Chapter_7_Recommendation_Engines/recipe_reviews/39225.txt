This was quite quick to make... I'd never made brownies before; it was 10:30pm and I wanted brownies with ice cream! Problem: no cocoa and only 1 egg!!! I came upon this recipe for which I, thankfully, had all the ingredients! It was a nice quick fix but these aren't the best brownies I've had. 

So, for a quick fix, with a limited ingredients: good!
