Really good! We'll be making this again for an upcoming family breakfast -- it would top pancakes or any breakfast breads beautifully.

I made 1/2 recipe to try this out. I didn't toast the pecans, because nuts usually come roasted anymore. And, I don't like the bitter or slightly burnt taste they get when toasted further. I used a hand emulsion blender for easier clean-up, and chopped the nuts by hand to a ground consistency. I wasn't able to get a strong "butter pecan" flavor. It wasn't bad, it just didn't taste like much more than the ingredients were butter and brown sugar with some ground nuts. Maybe, a drop of butter pecan flavoring may have given it that butter pecan flavor that I was expecting, not sure? This might be good on some pancakes as a change to regular butter, though, with some pancake syrup.

Served this today on waffles, and it was a nice change from regular butter/margarine.  I used ICBINB spread, and the only thing that I wasn't crazy about was the grainy texture from the brown sugar. I'm used to making fruit butters or adding honey, cinnamon or extracts where the texture is always smooth.  The graininess didn't kill it for me, it was just different, and the butter-pecan flavor definitely came through nicely.  Don't skip toasting the nuts, as it really enhances the pecan flavor in this butter.   Thanks Carrie Mae for this new variation on a flavored butter.

Great! Skip the sugar and vanilla and just use maple syrup. Really delicious and the maple syrup makes it silky and not grainy.

Fantastic!  I had fresh pecans from home in Ga, really good.  Only thing I did different is I sprinkled the pecans with cinnamon before roasting- awesome.  Adds just a small flavor...  Will make for friends!

While having breakfast at The Wave restaurant in WDW a couple months ago, I tried Butter Pecan Butter. It was so good I tried finding a recipe for it online when I got home. I came across this recipe. It tastes just like I remember from The Wave! It is delicious on biscuits and I can't wait to try it on pancakes and waffles. I let my mom and sister tr

I made this for a family reunion and it was an incredible hit!  I used pecan baking pieces which are already chopped very small to save a step in chopping the nuts.  I also only used a hand mixer and it worked fine.  Excellent quality vanilla does make a difference.
