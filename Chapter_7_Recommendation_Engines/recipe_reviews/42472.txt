This actually is a very good breakfast wrap, but you can easily cut out the step of frying the tortilla dipped in egg which is what I opted to do not just for time sake, but because I wanted my egg "inside" my burrito.  That being said, I scrambled one egg per flour tortilla and eyeballed the rest of the ingredients using light Cheddar cheese and leaving the salsa and light sour cream on the side. This was great for a "hand-held breakfast", not to mention a lot healthier and cheaper than fast food!

At first I was turned off by the mere thought of dipping my tortilla in egg, but I wanted to keep with the spirit of things and try the recipe as is. You know what? I was pleasantly surprised. It was good! Not that I'd go and fry my tortilla in egg every day, but I think I agree with my girl Kathleen in that the flavor is worth expanding on. This was definitely like a breakfast burrito, and I added salsa to mine. If the tortilla hadn't have been fried it would have been more like a wrap, and that's more to my liking.... but all in all I'm glad I tried it!

Good but not really burritos or even taco like... more simply like wraps.  Very easy to put together.

Didnt care for the tortillas dipped in egg although the flavour is worth expanding so I was thinking of scrambling up some eggs and adding it directly into the wrap instead.

Give this about 3 stars as is but I think there is a lot of potential.

Dipping the tortilla (I used low carb tortillas) in egg then frying was an interesting concept - but I wasn't that crazy about the outcome. I'll continue to put the eggs IN the tortilla rather than on the outside.  The bacon, avocado and sour cream additions, however, I really liked.  I also added fresh chopped green onion.  Not exactly low calorie, but at least it was low carb.  :)

Very filling. I used a homemade ranch dressing, a handful of shredded cabbage and added a couple shakes of Frank's Hot Sauce. Just what I needed today.

Made this for my husband and mom and they both really enjoyed them.  Did not fry the tortillas in egg however, I just don't fry food.  Instead I warmed the tortillas on a skillet and added scrambled eggs to the avocado/bacon filling.  Also added a splash of hot sauce when scrambling the eggs to give the burrito a little bite.

It was different (in a good way).  My husband really liked how the tortillas were cooked.  In the future, I will experiment with different ingredients to add more flavor.  You have to play around with the combination of condiments to fit your liking. Once again, frying the tortilla in egg is different, interesting, and a good change.

This is good without the bacon too. I use one egg per tortilla.

This recipe was easy to make and tasted wonderful! I cut the avacado into chunks, rather than strips, and used a about three instead of one. The egg-fried tortillas are absouletly wonderful!

My family did not go for these. Added diced tomato. I decided to forgo cooking the tortillas in eggs so it did taste like a wrap. The recipe says to thinly slice the avocado. I highly recommend that as the avocado's texture is so smooth that, IMHO, this recipe only needs a smidgen.
