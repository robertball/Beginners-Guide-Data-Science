I followed the recipe exactly, my entire family loved these! 30 minutes cook time is way too long, just check at 20 minutes, I think the most I left some baking for was 25. Make sure to chop everything well! Delicious and filling, I will definitely make this again next Christmas, thank you!

I have looked all over for this recipe, my Mother made them. She would freeze part of the dough in log shaped rolls and get them out and slice them, so we had them year round.  I am so happy to have found this, it brings back precious memories  Thank You

these cookies are delicious - just what I was hungry for. the consistency was great. I chopped the additions up very small and I usedvanilla rum instead of vanilla cream sherry. the cookies stayed in "balls" (I used a scoop), I think I might flatten them next time... cooked only for 20 min, too.

Great recipe, instead of using vanilla cream sherry I used Riesling that I had in the fridge and I also added some vanilla flavoring! They turned out great!!!

I tweaked this (as always)...made it gluten free & used dried fruits instead of candied ( no corn syrup) plus used 1/2 goat butter & 1/2 coconut oil & added vanilla. Soaked some currants (instead of raisins) in bourbon and threw the rest of the little bottle (airplane size) into the mix. My nut mix was peacsn, black walnuts, cashews & macadamias. And, yes, yummmm....grandma would be smilin'!

The Best fruitcake cookie. Moist, nutty, flavorful! Changes I made were 1 cupwhite raisin and 4oz citron 4 oz orange peel candies of course ,   In place of 2 cups raisins. The nuts were combo of walnuts and pecans only. And 2tsp vanilla in place of the Sherry. They are going to be a Christmas standard!!

I love these, I made a recipe similar to this one years ago and was upset when I misplaced it.  So glad I found this one. The dough stays nice in the fridge and freezer if you ever just want to do a few at a time.

This is a dead ringer for my own grandma's Christmas cookies.  The only difference is I substitute GOOD sherry for the cooking sherry, used only pecans and King Arthur gluten-free flour.  Also, the perfect bake was for 25 minutes at 300 in my convection oven.  Perfect chew with just a hint of crispiness.  I made two batches this season and still ran out!  These things are like crack.  LOL

Made these to give for Christmas. Could not keep them in the house.  I froze some, hid some, and they still disappeared.  They are certainly a hit!  I had to make a second batch!  Used bourbon instead of sherry.  Yum!

I exchanged half the brown sugar for superfine sugar to make the batter a bit more sweet. I added 4 T. of rum instead of sherry. I added more chopped fruits but left the total at 8 cups total.  I mixed walnuts and pecans and almonds  for the 7 cups of nuts. I topped each cookie with a pecan half for "show".  I put the batter in the refrigerator until
chilled well, to make handling the dough easier. They'll be tradition on my holiday cookie plate. They're as great as our family's fruitcake recipe!

Love these cookies. I didn’t have any alcohol to flavor them so I used vanilla only. Also had only 5 cups of nuts. The cookies were wonderful. I think this is a ‘no fail recipe’.

Fantastic! I had a bowl of leftover fruit from my fruitcake. So glad I searched for this recipe! I pared back the recipe by 1/3. I was a little concerned when I saw the amount of cookie dough compared to the rather large pile of fruit that I had, but they turned out wonderfully. The only quantity adjustment I made was to add extra cinnamon. The pared-down recipe called for 1/8 of a teaspoon.  I added a 1/2 teaspoon. Next time I will add a full teaspoon, also some ginger and cloves as well. I like a spicy fruitcake. Also, I didn't have sherry so I subbed with brandy. I used my small cookie scoop and ended up with 40 cookies. Twenty minutes baking time at 300 degrees was perfect.

I had completely forgot that my Grandmother made these, but oh my such wonderful memories with smell and taste.....now it really is Christmas !!! However,  350 15 minutes is plenty of time, 30 minutes is way to long and also I used 3 Tbls. of real Vanilla because I did not have Sherry, and they taste heavenly !!! Oh and a bit more cinnamon also :)
