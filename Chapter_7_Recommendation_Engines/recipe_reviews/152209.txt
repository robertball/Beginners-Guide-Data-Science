Wonderful chicken salad with a creamy honey mustard dressing!  I used leftover grilled chicken vs. canned and substituted chopped red delicious apples for the green grapes.  I also used fresh chives instead of dried. It's crunchy and sweet - a definite keeper.

Made this for a salad luncheon today and it was the only empty bowl when the party was over. Thanks for a great recipe. I followed the directions exactly.

Fantastic recipe!  I used 2 12.5 oz cans of chicken ... used 1/2 of the celery, added red onion and 4 green onions ... I didn't have green grapes so I addes a few extra red ones ... added 1TBSP lemon juice and 1 tsp curry powder to the dressing ... also added 1/4 cup of toasted almonds and 1/4 cup of toasted pecans ... this is a definite keeper!

Wonderful!  Dijon mustard?  who would've thought, but it really made the chicken salad delicious.  It didn't taste "mustard-y".  But it did add a mellow zing to it.  Just what I was looking for.  thank you for sharing~

I made this for our church potluck. It is so good, this is the one I will always turn to.  I boiled chicken thighs and used that instead of canned chicken, I used a can of water chestnuts instead of the celery, left out the salt, and I added some chopped apple.  Everything else stayed the same.

Very nice chicken salad - I cut down to basically one serving, using leftover roasted chicken instead of canned.  I used a soy mayonnaise substitute, which tastes great when blended with the dijon. I forgot to add the honey and didn't miss it, used fresh chives and added some chopped scallion.  Served over a salad of greens and sliced tomatoes.

This is the most amazing chicken salad recipe bar none! I made a few substitutions based on what I had... instead of cranberries I used raisens, instead of canned chicked I grilled some herb chicken, and added walnuts. IT WAS AMAZING!!!

This is a tasty and easy chicken salad recipe.  My only complaint is that it's a little too sweet.  I'll try leaving the honey out next time, and I might use fewer grapes.

This is absolutely delicious. I'd go with fewer grapes though as they tend to fall out if you eat the salad in a sandwich.

Great!!!  I doubled the recipe - there was just enough sauce - because the chicken absorbed the extra!  The only change - was I only had green grapes - but came out fantastic - thanks!!  Great for this hot-weather week!!!

This is yummy.  I simplified it by using honey mustard combined with Miracle Whip Lite and a couple teaspoons of skim milk.  I also added half a Granny Smith apple and put toasted walnuts on top.  Got rave reviews!

This is really tasty! I added tarragon...Ina Garden's secret ingredient for chicken salad. It gave it just the little flavor kick it needed. I also added 1T more honey b/c I thought it seemed too tart. Great recipe.

Very tasty and easy to make. I used fresh cooked chicken rather than canned.  Added cashews for texture. And added a 1/4 teaspoon dijon.

UN-BELIEVE-ABLE. Halve the honey and throw in whatever you have at home ... dried cranberries, celery, and toasted pecans worked woooonderfully. I made 1/2 the original recipe first, had it on whole wheat toast for lunch for 4 days, then when I ran out , I made 3 times (yes, 3 times) the recipe! Must I say any more?

I used cooked chicken breast rather than canned.  I didn't have dried cranberries so I used a little chopped apple.  This is a delicious recipe.  My husband loved it.  I didn't use all of the dressing, so just use your own judgement.  Yummy and easy too.

Outstanding. We've been making batches of this every week for 3 weeks and eating through the week for lunch. I omit the honey and add some celery seed. Great recipe!

VERY good chicken salad recipe! I only used a little over half of the grapes asked for, because I didn't have enough on hand, but I was very happy with the amount that I used. Thanks for the great recipe! Will definitely make again!

I made this for an office potluck-served with the wonder bread crostades described in the Chinese Chicken salad recipe...it was a hit, and people were really impressed with the crostades. I reduced the amount of mayo a bit-yum!

Made as directed this recipe is on the sweeter side.  I used a leftover fried chicken breast (crust removed), only red grapes, zero salt and light "real" mayo.  I served ours in a wrap. Next time I'll make it without the honey.

This salad is wonderful.  My husband and I love the diverse textures and tastes in this.  So much better than a traditional mayo only based salad.  I don't add celery, and use only dark purple grapes.

I followed the recipe with the following changes (the only thing I omitted was the red grapes b/c I did not have any): added garlic powder, added more chives, added 3 green onions, added sliced almonds, and added chopped pecans. turned out really good! I've been looking for another great chicken salad recipe - thanks for sharing!

I used poached chicken breasts instead of canned and ran it through the food processor with 3/4 of a vidalia onion to mince fine.  I really didn't measure anything.  I used green grapes and added some chopped cilantro.  No cranberries or celery.  I used Hellman's Olive Oil Mayonnaise with Black Pepper.  My darling husband can't stop talking about this salad.  Next time I will add some chopped nuts.  Thanks!

Good stuff!  I was a little afraid some of the ingredients would overwhelm the others, such as the celery or grapes, so I just made some very minor adjustments based on our tastes.  I also omitted the honey and added about 1/4 C. of chopped pecans.  Served it up on some nice wheat berry bread and it was a perfect blend of flavors!

This is by far my favorite chicken salad recipe. I use poached chicken breast instead of canned and cut back on the mayo. Chopped cabbage/coleslaw mix is a nice substitute for celery, and I like a bit of garlic powder instead of chives. Thanks for the excellent recipe!!!

I made this for a baby shower, and the guests loved it!  We had no honey, dijon mustard, or chives... subbed maple syrup, spicy brown mustard and scallions.  Tasted great even with the changes (I don't know if I would use maple again, but it was fine).  Thank you!

Yummy!!!!!  I have made this salad twice already. The first time I made it exactly as written and the second time I didn't have enough grapes so I used an apple. This salad is a big hit in my house.  We love the crunchyness and sweetness of it.

I made this recipe for Mother's Day and everyone loved it. Everything that was in it went so well together, and I really wouldn't change a thing. By the time lunch was over, there was none left- delicious!

I've made this using canned chicken or cooked chicken breasts.  It's very good, and I am making it now for a tea party.

Very tasty!  Even my young picky eaters loved it.  I replaced about 1/3 of mayo with low fat plain yogurt.  I did not have rolls for it so I added shell noodles to it.  I also did not have celery so I added peas and cucumbers. No craisins but added chopped apple and pineapple. The mustard provided a nice base for the sauce without being over powering.  Thanks!!!

A little drippy, but delicious. We stuffed ours in half a pita pocket. Great for a picnic lunch (but keep it in a cooler)!

I admit, I was very skeptical at first.  However, I would give it more stars if I could.  My fiance is a chicken salad-aholic.  He said it is the best he has ever had.  I made it for a picnic tomorrow, and I hope there is enough left to take!  I did use rotisserie chicken instead of canned, shredded in the food processor.  Good stuff!
