Packaged baking mix would be something like "Bisquick" -- a baking mix with multiple ingredients in it.

This looks absolutely delicious, and I'd love to make it. But what on earth is "packaged baking mix"? Is it just like a basic pastry dough mix, cake mix, what is it?

Very good, easy, and quick recipe.  I used apricot jam instead of raspberry and it was delicious.  I also tried it with cherry pie filling and sprinkled almonds on top of the glaze.  The almond extract and cherry flavors compliment each other nicely.

Very quick and very easy.  Just remeber to seal off the ends of your pastry or else you're going to have jelly everywhere.

I have made this several times, and it is easy and delicious.  I have never had a problem with the braiding part, and it looks beautiful when done.  The glaze, with the almond flavoring, adds a lot of flavor to this, and I wouldn't make it without.  I have only made this with raspberry jam, but I may try it with apricot or blackberry next.  Overall, this is a great addition to a breakfast or brunch.

Yummy!  I was tempted to add more jam because it didn't look like enough, but I'm glad I didn't...it would have been too sweet.  The icing is yummy, too.

I used homemade blackberry jam for a filling and substituted a mix of lemon & orange extract for the vanilla and almond.  The crust was light and flaky, and, as previously mentioned, the touch of cream cheese was a nice addition.  For some reason, I'm not too thrilled with the *braid* presentation method - - - I'd like to try this same recipe with more of a danish layout.  Will have to play around with it.

I thought that this was very easy and flavorful!  The cream cheese (I used low fat Neufchatel) is a very nice addition to the crust and it came out nice and flaky.  The almond icing adds a lot of flavor but make sure to get the good almond extract.  I made the braid the night before, refrigerated it, and baked it off in the morning. It came out perfect and all of the kids loved it!

Would never make again. I think it was gross. It sounded good but it just tasted like a Bisquik concoction with too much sugar (icing). Yes, it was easy, but I'd rather invest more time & ingredients and actually have a delicious pastry. I guess I was expecting something close to a Entanmnnen's  breakfast pasrty. Not even my sugar-loving kids would finish it. We all  felt a bit sick after wards... maybe we were all just on the brink of a diabetic coma, IDK.

I was very impressed that this simple recipe yielded such a delicious and delicate textured breakfast bread (Much like Struedal). Prep and bake time is very quick. Recommended for guests, brunch or just a yummy treat.

It was very easy, but pretty much just tasted like a very sweet biscuit with jelly.

There was way too much icing for this. I think that if I do it again I'm doing half of it. Also, the bread tastes mostly like the baking mix. Overall, this is just ok.

I LOVE this recipe. I've used blueberry preserves, raspberry Jam, and even apple pie filling. It always comes out delicious. Tip for anyone with soft dough...make sure your margarine and cream cheese is cold when you go to make your dough. It makes rolling out and shaping  A LOT easier.

The crust tasted like "packaged baking mix".  Which is what it should taste like however, this wasn't a favorite.

Had to make it my own ;) added berry cream cheese down the middle with half raspberry preserves and half strawberry. Oh and I added 3/4 cup sugar to the dough and used vanilla almond milk. Omitting the glaze it is spectacular!

I got this recipe ages ago from a co-worker and have made it ever since.  It's wonderful with apricot preserves instead of rasberry.

I have not tried this, it sounds easy, and delicious. I was wondering if anyone had tried it with a yeast dough? Would it even work?

Easy and looks fancy.  It does just taste like biscuits with jelly, which are good, so this is too.
