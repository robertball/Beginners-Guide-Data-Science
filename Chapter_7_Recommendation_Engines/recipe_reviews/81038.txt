This dip is excellent with a few additions: I used 8oz of shredded cheddar (instead of the swiss), 1 cup of shredded Parmesan cheese, 1/3 cup of mayo, 1tsp of garlic powder, 1tsp of onion and doubled the bacon. I kept the cream cheese, green onions and cracker amont the same. I then baked the dip for 20 minutes at 350. In the last 5 minutes I stirred the mixture and added the Ritz cracker topping. The dip was not oily at all (I think cutting down the mayo and adding the absorptive Parmesan cheese helped) and was delicious!

My mother-in-law made this after seeing Rachel Ray make it.  We thought it was good but missing something.  So the next time I made it I added just 3 artichokes chopped up.  It took the recipe from an 8 to a 20 on a 1-10 scale.  We almost didn't et thanksgiving because between just 4 of us we ate the entire bowl of dip!  We serve it with onion and herb flavored crakers or with garlic bread chips.  It is a favorite of ours.

Like Carolinc C, I had a nub of swiss and a nub of sharp cheddar in my fridge, so that's what I used. This dip is tangy, creamy, and rich--it was a hit at my house. We tried it with potato chips and on homemade bread--the bread won. I used bacon bits, cut the mayo to between 1/4 & 1/3 cup, and chopped up 2 Tbs roasted walnuts to mix with the club crackers to sprinkle over the top. I spread it in an 8 inch pie plate and baked in a 375 oven for 10 or 15 minutes, till it was bubbling. The crackers & nut combo crisped up and added a nice crunch. I am giving this 5 stars based on the raves of my husband and Mom; however I would cut the mayo waaaaaaaaaay back! Thanks Kamryn.

My friends and I have a nickname for this recipe: "crack cheese" because it's addictive like crack!  People go GA-GA over this and it couldn't be easier to make.  I use a 1/2 jar real Hormel bacon bits for the topping which is a huge timesaver.  I use about 1/2-3/4 a roll of Ritz crackers vs. 4 as the bacon/cracker topping is so yummy.  The best way to serve this is with Ritz Chips...they're perfect for it!

I have to give this 5 stars because it was a huge it. I  did make a couple modifications though. I used 8oz cheddar instead of swiss. 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream and 8 slices of bacon. This came out fabulous with no grease puddles like others mentioned. Fabulous...everyone at my party raved and it got gobbled up. Oh and to the post previous to mine, I love when people make little changes to recipes. Sometimes it's helpful if you don't like an ingredient and see that someone else substitutes it and it came out good. It gives you trust in trying that substitution.

As is, this dip is a 3 star recipe. I first tried this at a party several years ago, and thought it tasted great but was way too oily, and got worse as it cooled. I made some revisions and now I get requests for it for every gathering or party I go to! I use 1 cup light or fat-free mayo, an 8 oz block of neufchatel cheese, and 8 oz of shredded monterey jack. Blend together the cheeses, mayo and scallions and press into a microwavable pie plate or similar size casserole dish. Crush about 10-12 Ritz crackers, and add crumbled bacon bits into the crackers. Top the cheese mixture with the crackers/bacon, covering to edges. Microwave for about 7 minutes or until the cheese bubbles. This is AWESOME. Doesn't get greasy, it is gooey and delicious! I use breadsticks, melba toast, or bagel chips and it is ALWAYS a hit.

I doubled the recipe and added extra crumbled bacon.  I served it warm in a small 2 quart crock pot.  It was a hit at the party!  Everyone asked for the recipe and the crock pot was completely empty at the end of the night.  It's important to keep stirring the crock pot, otherwise a thick layer of oil forms at the top.

Love it!  I just loved it with twice the bacon and baked it in the oven.  It's a heart-attack special, but heck!  Who cares....you'll die with a smile!

I wish i could give this a 3 and 1/2 stars. My mom liked it, and i thought it was ok... but it was a little bland. i added some hot sauce and some onion powder bit it still lacked flavor. It is good but it needs a kick. next time i will added some jalpenos and a lot of red pepper.

This dip was very nice.  It reminded me of a fondu.  I liked it better with chunks of sourdough bread instead of crackers.

Killer dip. My whole family inhaled it.
(I did double the bacon, only because we love bacon more than life itself. We're pretty bacon-loyal.) I served it with 
melba toasts and Stacy's Pita Chips.

Served this with crudities and crackers last night, before a formal dinner. Totally irresistable and a huge hit.  It's so easy to make and full of flavour (although high in fat).  I'll definitely be making this again.

I made this using several suggestions from previous users. As someone suggested, I used 2 pkgs of reduced fat cream cheese and used 1/2 C light mayo and 1/2 C fat free sour cream. I added 2 cloves minced garlic and doubled the green onion. I used 6 slices bacon. I then used the 8 oz Swiss cheese and 2 oz of colby jack cheese. I omitted the crackers since I was serving with crackers. This was very good and everyone loved it. It is best made the day ahead and warmed in the microwave right before serving.

I always make this recipe for gatherings and it is always a big hit. My friends call it 'crack dip' because it is so addicting. I use Kraft's Philadelphia Chive and onion cream cheese and the crumbled bacon that comes in a pouch. I also use half of a sleeve of crackers cushed with a little bit of melted butter on top. I spread it in a glass pie plate and heat in the microwave (I do not stir it once I begin heating it). I always serve it with Fritos Scoops.

I served this dip at a jewelry party, and the ladies LOVED it! Several left with the recipe in hand. I did make few tweaks though. I used two pkgs. of cream cheese, instead of one, added a clove of minced garlic, and used 1/2 a pkg. of real bacon bits (because I did NOT want my house to smell like bacon before my party). I combined everything, then shredded an additional 4 oz. of swiss cheese on top and sprinkled it with some more bacon bits. I baked it in the oven at 375 for about 15-20 minutes. It was delicious served with whole wheat crackers and seasame sticks.

This was delicious and everybody loved it. It was very easy to make, too. The only issue that I had was that the cheese created an oil film on the top of the dip which needed to be drained off. The recipe still deserves a five star rating, though. Thank you very much for sharing this.

WOW!!!  UNBELIEVABLY GOOD!!!  Use about 1/4 cup less mayo, use 6 pieces of bacon (CRISPY) instead of 4, and stand back and wait for the compliments!!  Someone referred to this as 'Crack Cheese', more addictive than crack cocaine, and I can see why!  This will become my new party and potluck contribution, because it's so easy to make and too delicious to describe!!  Make it in the microwave, I cooked it for 2 minutes to start and 3 minutes to finish, it was perfect just that way.  Could add a dash of hot pepper sauce or maybe some chopped artichoke hearts to be fancy - but it's great as-is and will be a hit with any group.  I didn't have any butter crackers but had some cheese crackers and crushed those up instead.  I served it with the woven wheat crackers on the side, but this would be good with any cracker or even a crisp bread.  MAKE THIS, YOU WON'T BE SORRY!!

This was very good, but I put it in a small crock pot to keep it warm during a party and it got a little curdly-looking. It was still tasty, just not the most appetizing to look at. Next time I'll try oven-baking it. I added dried minced onion, garlic powder, dried parsley, and hot peppers to give it some extra zip.

This recipe is a Southern original. I think it was first seen in the Birmingham Junior League cookbook.  I'm originally from Jackson, MS and there is an addition to this recipe that makes all the difference.  A local cooking store drizzled Captain Rodney's Sweet Pepper Glaze (I think that's the name) on top of it. I've tried other pepper jellies on top and it's wonderful.  The added sweet and spice makes it even more addicting!  You can easily cut back on the mayo, or try different mayos. The whipped cream cheese is the way to go. I also use already cooked turkey bacon. Tastes the same, but is a tad bit healthier.

I always double this recipe. Use 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese, 2 pkgs of cream cheese, 16oz light sour cream, 2 3oz pkg bacon bits and a dash of garlic powder. stir, Bake 20 min @ 350. Put into a warm crock pot. Serve with  Ritz crackers. Easy to spread. Never brought any home after leaving a party, quite the hit!

I followed the recipe exactly and microwaved it for a total of 4 minutes (2 mins. stir and 2 mins).  It was a 4-5 in taste but a dead zero in looks as it kept separating.  There were pools of grease everywhere.  I ended up dumping it because it looked like a 'Heart-Attack-In-A-Bowl'.

This is a great dip.  I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup mayo and at least twice the bacon.  I also put it all in the crock pot which makes it so easy for a party.

I made this for a get-together with friends. Everyone loved it and there was none left at the end of the night. I only gave it 4 stars though because of the oil. There was so much oil in on the top of the dip when I took it out of the mmicrowave, I had to pour it all off. Otherwise, the taste was very good!

WOW - this dip cannot get any better...It's gooey, greasy and yummy...I applied the "extra bacon" and "baking" suggestions and all was beautiful!  Made this appetizer for a holiday get-together...and everyone stood around the dish stuffing their faces one cracker after another...even the pickiest and nutrition-concsious folks were diggin' it!

I made this for a girls night and it went over well!  It was easier to scoop up with the crackers once it had cooled a bit.  I couldn't find shredded Swiss, so I got 8 oz of sliced Swiss and then cut up fine.  Seemed to work ok!

This recipe sounded so good in spite of the reviews that it was bland.  It was indeed too bland but a half package of Vegetable Soup/Dip mix added just the right flavor and the dried vegetables gave it some additional texture.  My neighbors loved it!

The appetizer crowd gobbled this down quickly!  Based on some of the other reviews, I changed it and used 8 slices of center-cut bacon, 1/3 cup mayonnaise, 1/2 cup sour cream, 5 green onions, a little tabasco (maybe 1/3 tsp.?) and about 2 ounces of cheddar along with 6 ounces of swiss.  I left out the buttery crackers and used my small crock pot to heat this for about 90 minutes.  Several people asked for the recipe.

I made this for Easter dinner. I used a little less mayo (about 1/4 cup) and added about 1/2 cup of sour cream. I used a jar of real bacon bits and put the whole thing in my little crockpot.  It took about an hour for everything to melt together. I served it right from the crockpot. It was delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and my best friend LOVED this (I thought it was just so-so, but that's just me!)  I used 8oz of shredded cheddar, 1 cup of grated Parmesan cheese, 1/3 cup of mayo, 1 tsp of garlic powder, 1 Tablespoon of finely chopped onion and doubled the bacon.  I baked the dip for 20 minutes at 350. In the last 5 minutes, stir the mixture & add the Ritz cracker topping. (although I really couldn't see where the cracker topping added much, so don't sweat it if you don't have crackers.)  Oh! one more thing: It's really ONLY good while HOT -- so, if you have a fondue pot (with one of those little burners underneath), use that!

OMG! This dip was amazing! I followed some other review suggestions and only used 1/3c. lite mayo. I also used 6oz. swiss cheese, 1/4c. grated parmesan cheese, and threw in some garlic powder for good measure. My twin boys had 3 friends over, between the 5 of them and my hubby, it was gone in seconds and they were begging me to make more! This was EXCELLENT!

There are never any leftovers with this dip! Love it! I change the proportions to 1 block of cream cheese, 1 c. mayo, 8 oz of swiss, 1 pkg of real bacon bits and add more green onions.  We prefer to eat it with more of a plain, hard cracker such as bagel chips or wafers to get the full flavor.

Kids went crazy for this.  Before heating I set half aside or the next day - it was even better.  I recommend throwing it together the day before if you can!

Yummy! We enjoyed the left overs as a sandwich spread on a ham sandwich.

UPDATE: I made this in a slow cooker and will not do so again. It turned out very clumpy and oily. Tasty, but ugly : ) Still my favorite dip recipe.

I made this for the first time and took it to a friends "ugly" sweater party...by the way I didn't have green onions so I chopped purple onions up real fine and added 3x's the bacon...WHAT A HIT...you're not supposed to make new recipes for a huge gathering...I couldn't believe how many people asked how I made it and asked for the recipe....

Very good! I doubled the reipe. For double recipe I used 2 boxes of precooked bacon, 4 cups of shredded cheddar,  4 green onions, 1 cup Helmans, 1/2 cup sour cream and a few dashes of Tabassco. Hot sauce just heightens the flavour of the cheese and bacon and didnt add any real heat. Topped with crushed Ritz, another cup of shredded cheese and a bacon bits. Used a 9 x 13" throw away pan. Big hit for a crowd of 9 big eaters. Yum! Think I may try this as a middle layer between cooked shredded hash browns for a breakfast/ brunch side dish.

I made a few changes to this.  I used 1c. mayo, 1 package of cream cheese, 1c. sour cream, a bag of real bacon bits, 1 bunch of green onions, 1.5c. shredded cheddar cheese and a small tomato seeded and chopped. Baked it for 20 mins at 350 and served it with sour dough bread.  The rest of the meal wasn't even touched, everyone filled up on this and cleaned the dish completely.  Definitely a hit! Thanks for sharing! Definitely a recipe that can be played with to suit your family's taste.

This recipe is delicious and very flexible! I have made this as written (awesome dip!) and substituted other deli meats for the bacon with great results (my favourite is Italian salami).  Sometimes I sub Gouda or mozzarella for the cheese. Yum! This is a great recipe for cleaning-out-the-fridge-week. Thanks for sharing, KAMRYM!

Do NOT microwave this dip.  The cheese will be stringy.  And don't eat with crackers.  I've made this dip several times and can offer a few tips to make it good.  1) Bake dip at 350 degrees until bubbly.  2) Slice a french baguette in half and spread hot dip onto bread.  3) Put bread in the oven on the broiler setting.  Cook until lightly browned and bubbly.   With those modifications the dip is 4 stars.  Without, I'd give it a 1/2 star.

This is very good! I did use 6 pieces of bacon instead of 4, also I was a 1/4 cup short on the mayo so I added 1/4 cup of sour cream. Oops. And I baked this dip instead of microwaving. I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Good, but not outstanding.  My husband loved it, but I thought it was OK.  May make it again for him...but not for me.

I have been making this for years but add a little dijon.  I had some leftovers, and toasted english muffins, spread this on and topped with scrambled eggs.  Makes a yummy breakfast or brunch!

Everyone loves this dip!  I used 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I melted the cream cheese with the mayo and sour cream until it was smooth before adding the swiss cheese and also a little cheddar.  I added the bacon and green onion very last.  I did not have any problem with grease until I tried to reheat some the next day.  I think if you wait to put the bacon until very last it may help to keep it from getting greasy.  This recipe is good on anything from crackers to carrots, I will definitely make it again!!

My friend said "This is like spinach artichoke dip - but without the healthy stuff!!"  Hahaha, yes, it was a crowd pleaser! May actually add "healthy stuff" and see how it is - I don't think it is possible to mess this one up!

I don't know what went wrong but when I made this dip it had puddles of grease on the top.  I was so disappointed because the combination of ingredients sounded wonderful.

Wow.  This was amazing.  Used all low fat ingredients (except the bacon) and added garlic salt and chopped up artichoke hearts (about 1/2 can seemed to be enough).  Whatever cheese you have on hand will work - this is SO good.  Crack cheese dip is a perfect name!!

I followed the recipe exactly .  It was "stinky" after the first 2 minutes in the micro and after the second 2-4 minutes, it was oily, clumpy, and the entire house smelled.  I'm not sure what happened, since it received a lot of great reviews.  If I make it again, I might try a different kind of cheese instead.

Amazing!  I made the recipe mostly as directed (except I subbed dried diced onions for green onion, made the cheese mix half swiss/half cheddar, and used 1/4 cup mayo) and it was heavenly.  I'm surprised it wasn't super rich but it wasn't.  

I made another version by adding some artichokes and diced jalapenos - this version was very good also but not as good as the original.

I found this dip was best on toasted baguette slices.  I'm not sure of the purpose of the crumbled ritz crackers except perhaps for aesthetics; I didn't find it necessary to add them.

This recipe is just amazing!!  I get raves whenever I take it anywhere, and it is quickly becoming my go-to dish for parties.   I have used the "real bacon" pieces that come in a zipped bag instead of freshly-cooked bacon and it is fine, even though fresh is better.  I have also used sliced swiss cheese and layered it in the dish and that didn't work out as well, but I was trying to not have to shred the swiss blocks.  Sargento makes a shredded swiss, but besides that it is hard to find.   Also, I have now substituted the mayo for sour cream (can be light).  It isn't half as greasy and it is just as good!  I love this dip!!

Only ok, seemed to be missing something. We love cheese and thought there was too much in this. Crackers were too heavy so we tried tortilla chips and agree with another reviewer that corn chips would be nice. Ended up splitting it up and adding different ingredients to see what might help intensify the flavor. Hot sauce helped, didn't make it spicy, just added a little zing. Probably won't make this again but it was nice to experiment with.

I've made this twice now and both times it was a huge hit.  I use reduced-fat cream cheese, 1/2 c. light mayo instead of a whole cup and whatever kind of shredded cheese I have around, to equal about 3/4c.  I will use this often when entertaining.  Thanks for the post.

The flavor was good and it was very easy to prepare!  I used greek yougurt in place of mayo, cause I just can't do the mayo thing.  It was just lacking something, maybe a sharpness I don't know.

This was so delicious! The only thing I did differently was to add some grated extra-sharp Cheddar - just a little nub that was in the fridge, and needed using up. If I were to make it again, I would probably add a couple more slices of bacon. Anyway, thanks!

I brought this dip to a shower and it was a HUGE hit.  I opted to use cheddar instead of swiss and served it with french bread cubes and Frito scoops.  It's a good thing I made a double batch and refrigerated it, because the guests were asking for more later!

I used the recipes as a base and checked out reviews.  Used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream.  Remnants from fridge:  a little gouda, a little swiss, a little cheddar and some cracked black pepper white cheddar.  I also added shredded parmesan. 
I added a little hot sauce, a little garlic, and onion powder.  I increased the green onion and added a few artichoke hearts.  Doubled the buttery crackers and bacon on top.  I also added some pepper jelly on top before the cracker/bacon mixture for some sweetness.  I felt I couldn't give it a 5 star because I made so many changes but it was a creamy, taste sensation.  Best served on Ritz (bacon flavored) Crisp & Thins.

The only thing I changed was I used a smaller amount of mayo because I added horseradish(about 2 tablespoons worth) and used blue cheese instead of Swiss.  Yummy and easy!

I loved the recipe! I took some of the advice from other posters and used half mayo and half sourcream. I had no green onions so I sauted a small yellow onion and a tsp of chopped garlic and added that, doubled the bacon and only had havarti cheese. I baked in the oven in a pie plate. Heaven! it was wonderful warm and just as good cold, I think the creamy havarti kept it smooth and creamy even when cold. I had no problem with grease at all.

This is INSANELY GOOD!  I made it last night for a pot luck and it was the most popular thing on the table.  I gave it 4 stars only because I did make some changes based on the other reviews of the recipe: I used 1/2 c swiss, and 1/2 c mexican blend, replaced half of the mayo with sour cream, used 1 full package of pre-cooked bacon, and added  healthy shots of worcestershire and tobasco sauces.   I stuffed it in a bread bowl and baked for 30 minutes, then topped with the cracker crumbs and baked for about 10 more.  There was not even a CRUMB of that bread bowl left; all that bacony, cheesey goodness soaked into the bread and made it to die for.  I will definitely be making this again!

I tripled the bacon and cut back the mayo to 1/3 cup per other reviews. I also added cheddar along with 1 cup of swiss. I topped with ritz crackers. I found that this was a bit too greasy.

The dip was good, but just a little bland and had a lot of oil in it after melting the cheese.

Only three stars because this needs to be baked, not microwaved.  Very tasty and everyone love it but microwaving makes the oils separate from the cheese.  Next time I'm going to back at 400 for 1/2 an hour or so...should be perfect!

I doubled the bacon and added some parmesan, but it didn't have much flavor.  Maybe I did something wrong.

I made this for a party and it was gone right away. I followed other suggestions and reduced the mayo to 1/3 cup, I also doubled the bacon, and next time I will add even more (12 slices) as I was told it could be more bacony. I put it in a crock pot and served with french bread. Great recipe overall.

Wow, this is soooooo good!  I was a little nervous about the lack of ingredients & was temtped to add in some pepper or garlic or something but was happy I left it alone.  I did omit the cracker crumbs from the mix and only had 6.5 ounces of swiss & therefore added in a bit of parmesan as well.  This was the hit of the night at the holiday party I went to.  Thank you for sharing!!!

My sister and I halved the recipe and devoured this during a movie. Everything blended well to me. I saved some of the bacon to crumble on top. Next time I will add fresh diced tomatoes to the toppping. That's what was missing in my opinion.

Made this exactly as directed for 4th of July and everyone gobbled it up!  Next time though, will probably add a couple more slices of bacon, a little garlic and perhaps chop some pickled jalapenos for more kick.  Really easy to put together.

Great dip, everyone loved it. I added more scallions and about 3 cloves of chopped garlic. I also did swiss, cheddar, and parmesan. I used the bacon bits that come in the resealable bag and there wasn't a bite that didn't have a load of bacon in it. It started out as a dip but as it cooled, it became a nice spread. Great on celery and sourdough chunks.

This was very good and easy to make. The store I bought my ingredients from did not have swiss cheese, so I used Monteray Jack, but that was the only change I made. I took it to my grandma's house on Christmas, and everyone loved it. They all wanted the recipe.

I'm giving this 5 stars because it is a great base.  I really didn't make it exactly the way the recipe called.  I followed different ideas from other people and made it my own.  You can really do anything with this recipe.  The artichokes were a fabulous idea!  I used swiss and cheddar cheese and maybe shouldn't have used such bold cheeses because the dip was a little tangier then I would prefer.  I put it in a sourdough bread bowl with chips and crackers and it was a hit.  The next day we dipped celery and carrots in it and that was awesome too!

I made this dip on fun food night when the hubby was working and my daughter ate some of it. Not as great as I would have expected from some of the reviews but tasty anyway. Yes, it is greasy. I also was a tad surprised at the consistency, kind of like "curds", so don't let that surprise you. I would make again for a party or something. It was very easy.I am wondering how it will be cold.

I have made this twice now, two years in a row, for our family Christmas in July celebrations and it is always the hit of the party.  The only change I make is I use salad dressing rather than mayonnaise and I use 6 slices of bacon.  A winner for sure!!

I made this for a bridal shower. I did cut back on the mayo and added two minced garlic cloves and artichokes. I put crushed crackers on top, put it in a serving dish and heated 20 min. in the oven.I served it with crackers but noticed some were eating it with their veggies. Thanks for all the extra tips. Everyone loved it and was asking for the recipe. I must give this 5*'s.

We made this for a family Christmas party and it was a major hit!! We put it in a small crock pot and served with bacon flavored Ritz crackers and it was the first thing gone out of all of the dished that were brought by everyone. I am pretty sure that if we had made more it would've been gone too. The recipe itself was simple to make and the directions were perfect. The only thing I did differently was I added an extra 3 pieces of bacon (only because I really love bacon) and one more stock of green onion. We will 100% be making this one again and again,

I use this as the base to my Beer Bacon Cheddar dip. I use 3 blend cheddar cheese and I use half cup mayo, half cup sour creame, garlic and onion powder, double the bacon, add a quarter more of cheddar. And Instead of baking it, I make it on a pot on the stove and add a Lagunitas IPA to taste

Bacon is always a winner.  Mix in cream Cheese, mayo and Swiss and you have something better.  Recently, we subbed in Blue Cheese for the Swiss  - may have been even better .

As written 3 stars? I didn't like the idea of so much mayo and there were no spices, we like punchy flavour. Modified for us 5 stars! After reading other reviews I changed the recipe to suit my family's taste. 6 slices of bacon, 1/2c mayo, 1/2 c sour cream, 4 green onions, "old" cheddar cheese, garlic powder, hot sauce, fresh black pepper and some milk to thin it out to the desired consistency. This was DELICIOUS! I think it's a good base recipe but like a lot of recipes, just needs some tweaks to make it perfect for you.

Used spicy jalapeño bacon and cheddar cheese as I didn't have Swiss on hand. Guests loved it!
This is definitely a keeper!

It's so amazing. I have been consistent in the way I make it, but sometimes it seems better than others or holds on to the cracker better. Seeing the way other people have made it though, I'm going to have to try my own thing. I made this for my own birthday party! For a regular appetizer however, I constantly have a tough time finding an entree that fits my appetizer.

Made a variation for super bowl.  It went over very well! Read the reviews and was worried about the separation and the greasiness.  Tips:1.  cut the swiss cheese to 5 - 6 ounces otherwise it's overbearing.  2: replace half the mayo with sour cream. 3. add a teaspoon of garlic powder. 4. beat together cream cheese, sour cream, mayo, swiss cheese, garlic powder and onions on high. 5. chill for 20 - 30 min. prior to baking (NOT microwaving!) 6. Bake for 20 - 25 min. at 350 until edges are golden brown & bubbly. 7. last 5 min. of baking add the mixed, crushed, crispy bacon & cracker. 

Can be dipped with crackers or veggies

I love this dip! I also double the bacon and add a little garlic powder. I also add a splash of Worcestershire sauce before baking it. It's so yummy!

Delish!  Not a mayo fan so I used half mayo and half sour cream. Left out the crushed crackers because I just didn't have any. Might be a little thick to eat with chips but don't worry, you won't stop eating the fresh veggies until this dish is done.

I really didn't care for this at all.  The blandness could be remedied as others have said but the texture.....so oily and disgusting.

4 stars for flavor; 1 star for texture and appearance.  Had to pour off about a cup of oil after microwaving.

I'm not sure what went wrong but it turned out to look like a ball of dough in a lot of oil. I'm thinking maybe it was the Swiss cheese. One or two people ate it and said it tasted good but the appearance made it unappealing.

I wanted to make a simple dip and picked this one due to great reviews and needing little ingredients. This dip is awesome for the little of ingredients it uses. I literally did not put any other seasonings in the dip and it turned out super flavorful and easy! It was a huge hit at the party and I ran out in under an hour!

I made this for Super Bowl and it was a huge hit plus it held up great in a crock pot!  I made it with just Swiss cheese the first time and didn't like the strong taste. For the party I used a Colby Jack mix and it was much better. For ease, I use the precooked bacon bits from Costco. Not the bac O bits for salads! These are real bacon and a great thing to keep stocked in your refrigerator.  The only downside to this dip is it's not a great leftover. When reheated it separates and leaves you with a bowl of floating oil :(. Didn't stop me from stirring it and eating it anyway :)

After reading varies reviews, I wanted to try this recipe in its original form first before making adjustments. After the second microwave, it was very greasy. I had to pour out the grease. The mixture kept separating, and I was unable to use it. The taste was good though, but it wasn't something I could serve!

Sooo delicious!!!
I wanted the convenience of microwaving the dip for my crew, but I LOVE BAKED, CARAMELIZED CHEESE so, after I had mixed everything and it looked sort of Pimento Cheese-like, I spread some on a piece of pumpernickel bread and put it in the toaster oven!!!!  HEAVENLY!!
Will also stuff into jalapeño halves and bake!!!!! Potato skins!!! Let your imagination take this recipe even higher!!!
(I used half mozzarella/half Mexican cheese blend and hubbie enjoyed it cold -before it was cooked- just like pimento cheese)

This was ridiculously good. I didn't change a thing, but I'm sure you could play with the cheese type and it would still be divine.

I made a few tweaks to the recipe: used some cheddar with the swiss, cut back on the mayo a touch since it's not my favorite, and added a bit of bacon grease/drippings. Not surprisingly that added to the oiliness, but made it very bacony...which is always a plus in my book.  We served it with baguette slices as well as crackers and I really liked it on the bread. Everyone seemed to enjoy it. I'll try it again some time.

I put this in my little Crockpot, rather than baked it.  I cut up 7 pieces of bacon, and I also used 1/3 to 1/2 cup mayo as opposed to the whole cup.  Everyone really liked it, and I've made it a couple more times since, just to eat for dinner on hot, humid nights!
