I chose this recipe to as a side dish for carne guisada. I live in the San Antonio area and found that the ingredients sounded about right and the prep uncommonly simple. To my suprise not only was it delicious but impressed a hispanic dinner guest so much she took the recipe home to her grandmother! Honestly...I left out the mustard..I had never heard of that....all turned out well without it. Also instead of tomatoe juice I used a cup of prepared caldo de tomate (tomatoe bullion). If you love spanish rice this is your best bet!

My husband, the rice freak, LOVED this recipe and asks for it about once a week!  Very easy to make and flexible enough to sub if you don't have everything on hand.  I was out of tomato juice, so used a small can of tomato paste with equal amounts of water.  Worked just great!

This recipe not only got an "A" in ease of preparation, but the taste was outstanding as well. I was a little confused as to whether or not you were supposed to cook the instant rice first (you're not) but I will definitely be serving this again!

This recipe was good; I liked it better than the rice I eat out of many Mexican Restaurant.  Something to look out for:  When I increased the serving size to 20, it increased the number of vegetables:  4 onions, 4 red peppers, 2 green peppers.  It was too much, I used one green pepper, one red pepper, one yellow pepper, and one onion, and that was great.  I added chili powder, diced tomatoes with green chilies and chicken broth.  It was great. This is a keeper.

I was looking for an easy Spanish rice recipe that tasted somewhat like my grandmother's.  This one had far more liquid, too much for my taste. My family may have liked it better if I added more rice or less tomato juice as it seemed like the other ingredients overpowered the rice.  I doubt that I'll make this again.

I thought this was very good.  I'm not a very big spanish rice fan, but this was good.  I did have to cook it longer than the recipe called for in order to get the rice soft.  For all of the people who leave out the mustard or are scared to use it, you should try it!  I think it definitely makes it more flavorful.  I even added more than the recipe called for!  It gave it zest!

I really liked the flavor of this recipe but found it to be a bit too crunchy for my tastes when simmering for only 5 minutes.  I would recommend simmering for longer so that the rice, oinions and peppers have more time to soften.  I changed it slightly by foregoing the cup of tomato juice and adding two cans of diced tomatos.  With that in mind, I will definately make it again.  We enjoyed it and I always have the ingredients on hand which makes it easy to make.  And it hardly takes any time at all which is another bonus!  Thanks for sharing!

Very good flavor.  I used diced tomatoes with onions and peppers, so I deleted the green pepper.  Also added about 1 tsp taco seasoning.  Will definitely make again.

Great recipe!  I added a 4 oz. can of green chilis, omitted the mustard, and used 1 can of diced tomatoes with the juice (no tomato juice).  Also added a dash of cayenne pepper and 1 T of cumin.

This reminds me of my husband's spanish rice. He's Italian. When we have leftover made-from-scratch spaghetti sauce he adds some Taco seasoning, red & orange bell peppers-chopped and MIN--- Rice. It is wonderful. I love it better than any I have ever had at a restaurant or out of a box. Good way of using up extra pasta sauce too...

Great tasting rice!  I followed the instructions regarding the amounts for each ingredient and it turned out perfectly!  Rather than using instant rice, which I didn't have, I used par-broiled rice and instead of tomato juice, I used spicy clamato juice, which was a great substitute.  May I suggest, as optional ingredients, thyme (1/2 teaspoon for a serving of 4) and a couple of hot green peppers from Turkey for an extra kick to the taste.  Not that it needed it but still, for lovers of spicy dishes, those two ingredients could add some zip to this wonderful dish!

This is awesome!!  Sadly..I usually use the boxed stuff (for time reasons more than anything).  But this is worth the time to cut up the veggies.  I had leftover red, yellow, orange, & green bell peppers from the nite before so I used a little of each. Made it very flavorful and super colorful!! Also I only used a half of onion because that's all I had left.  I will definately put this in my recipe binder as a keeper!!

I thought this recipe was very good.  I used v-8 juice instead of regular tomato juice and also used regular rice instead of instant and it worked out fine.  I will make again.

Love this stuff!  I did add minced garlic along with the bell pepper and onion and used a mexican spiced tomato sauce.   Also added about a half cup of chicken broth (from bouillion) after i accidentally used more rice than I should have.  It definitely takes longer than five minutes to cook the rice using regular rice...you just need to check it after about 20 minutes or so.  Be sure to brown the rice before you add in the veggies.  It was absolutely delicious...good enough to eat all by itself!

Had someone give me a box of 'instant' rice which I never buy and stumbled on this recipe by doing an 'ingredient search' to use the rice up. Its a GREAT recipe. Followed precisely the first time, questioned the mustard,  but did it anyway, was not disappointed. Strange little zing it gives to this dish. The dish is very forgiving. Once I didn't have tomato juice so used chicken broth and was not disappointed. The recipe is very versatile.

being a poor college student with no food, i had to get creative. what i did have: chicken boullion cubes, salsa, tomato juice and rice. i made it as directed, adding the boullion for flavor,  the salsa for the tomatos, onion, green and red pepper.  it came out delish. i really wanted sour cream and didn't have any so i drizzled a little ranch dressing over it, and it did the job.

I made this recipe exactly as stated sans the mustard. My husband liked it fine but I thought it was too tomato-ee. Maybe the mustard would have given it that extra flavor.

Great! I used brown instant rice though.. silly me (I'm new to this cooking thing), so I ended up adding water to the skillet and it became really soggy. I also added sugar, salt, and spray-on butter and that helped a lot. Great recipe! Definitely will be doing this again.

All the ingredients together are really delicious.  I just found the instructions on this one a bit vague.  I think the rice should be cooked first and the onions should be sauteed by themselves for awhile before adding the peppers.  In the end I just threw everything into a big pot, added some water and let it simmer like a thick soup until the onions were tender and not so strong.  It tasted great in the end.

I used this recipe to make Spanish rice to put on Fajitas that I used the "Fabulous Fajitas" and the "Easy Guacamole" recipes. All recipes superb. My only comment is that the mustard I used actually made the rice taste like mustard, I added some hot sauce to balance the taste. I'll either skip the mustard or try a different kind next time.

'Absolutely delicious' is all I could say as I tasted this rice.  SO much flavor.  I made this thinking it would be mexican style rice, which we love here in Texas, but it was a pleasant surprise once prepared.

This is excellent. I adore spanish rice and hadn't found a recipe this good in the last twenty years. I did omit the mustard and didn't read carefully.I used two large peppers one orange and one green. I also cut up one roasted Chile.Yum. This was so good, I ate way too much. Thank you for submitting this recipe. Lal667

I was looking for a quick, easy alternative to my usual Spanish Rice recipe. This was quick and easy, but rather bland. I had to add some extra seasoning to make it more tasty.

I loved this rice, but hubby wasn't as impressed. He is more a Mexican rice fan (without the tomatoes).  I did have to change a few things up because of what I had on hand.  I used a 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes, added about a 1/2 tsp. of comino, and used a cup of water because I didn't have tomato juice.  I left out the mustard and had to use a poblano pepper because I didn't have a bell pepper.  Anyway, it was still delicious even with all my changes.  (I would definitely recommend cooking the onions and peppers first before adding the rice.)  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Yum! I was hesitant about leaving WHOLE tomatoes in this, but it was delicious. I'll be making this over and over.

It was simply great.  The only thing we changed the second time around was to use less tomato juice. It is now in our dinner rotation.

Absolutely loved the flavor, and adding in the peppers really gave it that extra kick! I ate the leftovers for days afterwards.

Just made this and it was GREAT!  We substituted 2 cans of diced tomatoes for the 1 can plus juice and it was fine.  I think next time we might cook the peppers and onion a bit more before adding the rice as they were a bit crisp for our taste.  Great recipe.  Will definately make again!

great recipe, I omitted the green pepper, added a chicken boulion cube and used a can of diced tomatoes with chilis.  We had friends over, who normally don't eat rice take second helpings of this one.

In the begining I was worried, beacause the last time I made spanish rice from a recipe it didn't turn out to great. This time it was way better! The rice wasn't all squashed together and it didn't have to much of a tomato flavor, it was very good.

Made this to accompany chicken fajitas . It would have been better if I followed the recipe closely, BUT I didn't ?? . I used regular white rice which I browned a bit before adding other ingredients; Added 1 can diced tomato and 1 can of mild Rotel, a little minced garlic, a sprinkling of chili powder, and salt and pepper. It seemed quite tomato-y so I left out the tomato juice and added 3/4 cup of chicken broth. Peppers and onion per the recipe, but sauteed for a few minutes before adding. Mixed well, covered, and baked for about 45 minutes until rice was done. It sounded good to me but did not have a satisfying taste....something lacking. When or if I try again I'll make sure to have the right ingredients.     j.david

I've made this as written and it's good, but it's also good if you need/want to make substitutions/additions. The last time I made it, I didn't have any instant rice, tomato juice or whole tomatoes, so I subbed regular rice, tomato sauce and Rotel. I always add a little sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes. Worth making, and flexible enough to come out fine if you make a few changes.

I made the recipe using instant brown rice.....I double the rice to 3 cups because of previous reviews. I still needed the rice to cook down a little..but I will make it again.

This was a good recipe.  Next time I make, I will look the veggies separately, and then add the rice afterwards.  I may try to add some heat too.

Absolutely the best! Flavorful and easy to make. I needed to add more tomato juice to cook properly. Serving estimate must be off because I had enough for 12 servings.

I accidentally bought Goya Yellow Spanish rice instead of the instant rice. It took a bit longer to cook but it came out great!!! I also added a can of chicken broth so that the rice could cook up faster. I used diced tomatos as others suggested. It had a great flavor and my guests loved it!

I was looking for a spanish rice with ground beef and minute rice (using what I had on hand) I lightly browned the hamburger, drained it, added it back to the pan with a lg chopped onion (I didn't have any peppers)rice, and 1/2 T. of oil.  Sauted until onion was tender, added the tomatoes & salt.  I didn't have tomato juice so I mixed 3/4 of a sm can of tomato paste with 1 1/4 c water (a little more than the cup of juice called for, but I thought I would compensate for the addition of beef) I also added a 4 oz can of diced green chilis, drained and 1/2 tsp of cumin.  Turned out excellent!  I've made this early in the day so I can refrigerate it and warm it later for better flavor as suggested by another review.  Next time I will make this recipe as it is called for to give it justice, but it sure was good like this.  Thanks!

I made this on the fly one night while family was visiting.  They were amazed that I found it quickly with the recipe search and had the ingredients on hand.  Tastes great.  Will definitely make again.
