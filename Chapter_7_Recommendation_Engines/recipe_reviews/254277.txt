This was really delicious.  Mine came out a little crispier on the outside than shown on the video, but we loved them.  I was using frozen shrimp, so I gave them a rough chop and put them in the colander for a few minutes, then blotted with a paper towel. They were still very moist inside. Served with the Thai-Style Sweet Chili Sauce and a cucumber salad. One pound of shrimp was more than enough to make a main course of this for two people.

Very tasty...made with prawns and substituted tomato paste (with a couple of pinches of red pepper flakes) for chilli paste.

This was delicious. Everyone in the house loved it. Made it exactly as written. Also made the sweet spicy chili sauce to dip. Everything was delicious.

Since we had 5 pounds of salad shrimp I used a pound and a half to make this wonderful dish. I put them in the food processor for a bit just to break them up. After that I pretty much went by the recipe except for me adding a little chipotle sauce to take it up a notch ????

I made this recipe with fresh/thawed shrimp. Neither one of us is a big eater but these shrimp paddies were GONE at the end of the meal with all the sides. I made  baked sweet potatoes and a mixed green salad. IWSG!!!!
