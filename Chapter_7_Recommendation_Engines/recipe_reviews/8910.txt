Made this last night and it was very good.  I read the other reviews and only cooked my chicken in the oven for 35 minutes.  Let's face it...you brown it on the stove first and that cooks the chicken at least half way through.  We added garlic and chopped onion to the sauce.  We found the amount of fresh thyme & rosemary was perfect.  It was very tasty; hubby loved it.  We will make this again.

This was pretty tasty.  The mixture of sherry and sour cream made a nice tangy sauce.  I added 2 cloves fresh garlic and 2 cups sliced (fresh) mushrooms to the butter after I browned the chicken.  I placed these on top for the last fifteen minutes of baking time.  I also cut the bake time down to 45 minutes.  A keeper! Thanks.

This is a great base to a fantastic combination of flavors.   I added a few things: shallots, garlic & mushrooms.  I also used 1.5 cups of sourcream and 1/2 cup sherry (Oloroso - Cream Sherry) so I could put this on a bed of rice with more sauce. I only kept this in the oven for 40 minutes (35 minutes and then 5 more with some parmesean/romano cheese melting on the top).

As per a previous comment, this is a good starter for dinner. The sauce definitely needed garlic and perhaps some shallots. Also, even reducing the cooking time to 40 minutes, the chicken was slightly overdone. Depending on how well the chicken is seared, the baking time should probably be reduced even more.

This was a terrific starter recipe! I added the following "tweaks". I assembled this to cook in my slow cooker. I sprinkled the frozen whole chicken breasts with lemon pepper and Rosemary. I covered them with swiss cheese. Then I sauteed some onion, celery and garlic cloves in butter. I mixed up the sour cream and sherry (using extra sherry) and added the Rosemary and Thyme.  I also added basil and chives from previous members tips. I stirred in the sauteed onions, garlic and celery. Then I poured the whole thing over the chicken breast and cooked on low for 6-7 hours. Served over Penne pasta. Awesome! Thank you so much for providing a recipe that is easy to tailor to the individual family!

Gave it a 4 cause it seemed like it lacked a little bit of oomph for flavor. Took the advice from others and I added some crushed garlic and diced onions when I browned the chicken.  Also added a can on mushrooms (didn't have fresh).  I deglazed the sherry in the pan getting up all the bits of garlic and chicken from the pan.  That helps take away the alcohol taste if you're worried about that.  I had to use up a sour cream container so this was perfect.  I did forget to add the butter in the mixture, so I added it in the baking pan in bits and pieces and did my best trying to mix it. Overall it's a good recipe, nice twist on the traditional cream of mushroom style.  Will try again with added veggies.

This was very good and smelled great while baking. Per other reviews, I added onions, mushrooms, and minced garlic to the sauce. I didn't have fresh herbs available, so used dried "Tuscan herb" blend. It was still very tasty. Served with roasted root vegetables and green salad.

This was a wonderful recipe.  I tried it last night but I used pork chops instead of chicken and it was very tasty.

Delicious and easy! It's wonderful with some nice basmati rice. My husband even raved about it, and this isn't usually his kind of meal.  The first time I made it, I used  the rosemary and thyme but didn't really like the way they went with the dish.    The second time I made it I omitted those spices and used garlic powder instead and liked it better.  I also skipped the step of browning the chicken first and added the butter to my sour cream/sherry mixture so that I didn't have to dirty another pan.  I think it tastes pretty much the same, but you just have to cook it in the oven a little bit longer.  Thanks for the recipe.

An easy and delicious recipe to tweak to your own tastes. I added fresh garlic, used 1 tsp of rosemary, sliced onions and mushrooms added fresh tarragon, doubled the sauce and included 2 Tbs of flour to tighten up the sauce. Since dark meat is my favorite I replaced the breasts with boneless chicken thighs 2 to 1. I'll definitely make this a few time a year.

This chicken is YUMMY!!  I'm a big fan of sherry, so it's only natural that I would love a recipe like this.  I also add onion and sliced mushrooms to the pan before the sour cream and sherry.  Thanks Charlene for a great recipe.

I usually only review when I don't make alterations to the recipe, but.....this is a keeper of a recipe.  I was really wanting the taste of tarragon, so substituted the fresh rosemary and thyme with fresh tarragon.  I sauted sliced mushrooms after browning the chicken, topped the chicken with the mushroom and sauce, baked 40 minutes and it won rave comments a dinner.  Simple, tasty and perfect with egg noodles

I really like the idea of this recipe, it's a different way to make chicken and that is always good!  I half it and make it for two.  I have made it twice now with the following alterations.  To lower the fat content, I use two Tbsp of light margarine. I use one Tbsp to brown the chicken, then remove from pan.  I add the other Tbsp and then saute garlic, mushrooms and a shallot.  Even though I half the sour cream I still use 1/4 cup of sherry.  When cooking, I used a cast iron fry pan to brown everything and then just put it straight in the oven.  I also covered the pan with tin foil to keep in the moisture and took it off for the last 5 minutes.  I only cooked the chicken for about 35 minutes.  This recipe is very tasty and still easy enough to make on a weeknight.

Followed other suggestions and added minced garlic and onions to butter while browning chicken.  Used the sherry to de-glaze the pan and the sauce came out great.  The spices were a great touch and with using a meat themometer, took the chicken out of the oven after 25 minutes when it reached a temp of 165 degrees.

Boyfriend went crazy for this! I doctored up the original recipe using 1/2 c diced celery, 2/3 c diced onion, 2 cloves minced garlic, and a small package of fresh sliced mushrooms. I sauteed these with the butter before browning the chicken. It added lots of flavor. I didn't have fresh herbs so I used dry bottled herbs and cut the amount in half. This dish was the best thing I've made in a long long time.

Pretty good although I think 1 hour in the oven was overkill (some of the sauce was burned around the edges).  The dish was easy to make, not complicated, smelled great while cooking, and tasted great.

I made this tonight and taking suggestions from other reviewers I sauteed some sliced onions and mushrooms in the pan before deglazing with sherry and adding sour cream and I sprinkled the chicken with garlic powder (I didn't have fresh).  I only baked the chicken 35 minutes, 1 hour would have been way too long.  I thought the rosemary taste was a little strong but I'm giving it 5 stars because my husband declared it delicious and worthy of a world class restaurant!

This is an excellent and very tasty chicken dish.  The sour cream / sherry mixture is very good; in fact, I doubled the amount of sherry for maximum effect!  
The proportion of rosemary and thyme is perfect as I sprinkled both spices generously on the chicken breasts before adding the sour cream / sherry mixture on top of them, as instructed.  I will definitely make this wonderful dish again and will add either chopped up green onions, garlic or chives based on the great suggestions made on this site.  I will try the sherry / sour cream mixture on pork tenderloin as I'm positive it will be a hit in the same way it is with chicken.

Surprisingly good, and very quick.  Also didn't bake as long as recommended, and it was fine.  Didn't have fresh herbs, so used dried.  Nice flavor.  Look forward to trying it again with the fresh herbs.  Will keep this one.

I made this for my parents in law when they came over for dinner. I added 1 chopped onion and 10 sliced mushrooms to the dish and cooked for 40 minutes. I would suggest doubling the sauce if you want to put this over noodles, as I found it a bit dry when placed on top of egg noodles. But the taste was really good!

This was really good but needed about 50% more sauce. I added sauteed mushrooms, and used only half the thyme. Also took it out at about 40 minutes, an hour is way too much. Served over egg noodles. Will make again!

Tasty, but the cooking time was too long.  The chicken came out a little dry, and the sauce around the chicken was burned.  I'd cut it to about 45 minutes like another reader suggested.  I also added a little garlic powder to the sauce, and a pinch of Cajun seasoning mixture to the chicken before browning.

This is a fantastic recipe. I've made it about 3 times now, including Mother's Day. My partner's parents don't eat dairy, however, so I simply substitute the sour cream and butter for their non-dairy counterparts. 

I also tend to use the dried herbs as opposed to the fresh 'cause - well - I'm lazy like that. Works just as well, though I advise using less thyme or the recipe gets overpowered with thymieness. :-).

For some reason we just didn't like this dish.  I can't even quite put my finger on why not.  Might have been the sour cream.  Thanks anyway.

This is an easy and tasty recipe that I make all the time for my family.  I double the sauce part since we like to use it as a gravy over rice.

This was a very good recipe! I used chicken thighs because they were what I had. I also followed some of the suggestions from other reviews, and added mushrooms and garlic powder to the sauce, which worked well. I also cooked it for about 40-45 minutes in the oven. My only complaints are that a 9x13 pan is definitely too big, at least for the size of the chicken pieces I was using, and that the sauce was a bit liquid-y when I removed it from the oven. I served it with egg noodles and veggies and used all of the extra sauce for the leftovers. My family loved this and I will definitely be making this recipe again.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! Has been my families fav for about a year now and I thought I should review it since I am making it again tonight...the only thing I change is I double the sauce...Its so very easy and it blends so well together. I always make mashed garlic potatoes and sauteed zucchini and yellow squash...Thank you so much!

This came out good - although I too made some changes.  I added a Goya seasoning packet, and since I didnt have fresh herbs, I only used dried.  I left out the additional butter, only used the sherry to deglaze then added the sour cream.  I didnt miss it - it was great over white rice.

I made this last night and my 3 kids, who are trying to get picky on me, and my husband loved it, as did I!!!!! I did take the advice from previous posts and added finely diced onions and 3-4 cloves of garlic. My husband isn't a huge fan of rosemary, so I just used and italian seasoning blend in it. We gobbled it up and I had some pasta too for the extra sauce. Will make again for sure!

Made this last night, and it was delicious! I followed the recipe for the most part. Browned the chicken in butter for 25 minutes or so and removed them from the pan. Followed the measurements in the recipe for sour cream and sherry. I don't measure my spices, but I did use dry rosemary and thyme, salt & pepper as suggested in the recipe; also added Red Robin's seasoning (my "secret" ingredient) & chicken boullion to the sauce. Right before placing it all in the oven, I threw in a can of mushrooms over the chicken and smothered it all in the sauce. Left it in the oven for 15-20 minutes (to let the chicken cook completely through), and "voila!" Served it with short grain brown rice. Boyfriend loved it, we practically licked the oven dish clean. Next time, I'll use fresh rosemary. I think I'll use this sauce for lots of other things as well (mmmm, like mashed potatoes) - it's THAT good!

I'm giving this 3 stars because the recipe isn't written well.  Overall this is a good tasting recipe but the cooking time is way to long.  I baked mine about 25 minutes, using a meat thermometer.  Also, there is way to much thyme, in my opinion.  I also added a teaspoon of minced garlic.  If you are serving this over rice or pasta, double the sauce.  

I served with egg noodles and steamed asparagus.  I will make this again with my changes!

a full hour in the oven dried out my chicken and made the sour cream sauce gummy and separated - if i try this again, i'll use creme fraiche (it handles heat better) and start checking after 1/2 hour

I thought this was a good change from the norm as far as chicken is concerned. I added mushrooms to mine, but I did not double the sauce. There was plenty to go around and it was pretty tasty. But the next time I make this (and I WILL be making this again) I will double it and add a little less cherry. It was just a little strong for us. I made six servings and it all got eaten. My son, mister picky eater himself, went back for seconds! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Loved the taste of this recipe and it was pretty easy too.  Took advice from other reviewers and used fresh herbs (didn't know how to "chop" them though), cooked for 40 minutes and came out perfect.  If I had more sour cream I would've doubled the sauce as suggested, sauce is AWESOME!!  Great way to use up extra sour cream.

This was sinfully good! I took other reviewers suggestions and baked for only 40 minutes. I also added mushrooms and onions as was suggested. I put in squash as well since I had it and it was great. I served with egg noodles. Rice would go well, too.

Thank you, other reviewers, for warning about the time!  Due to reviews, I checked at 40 minutes and it was done! It would have been dry and burnt, had I baked for the hour the recipe stated. I used a healthier butter substitute (Soy Garden) and the sauce still had great flavor. It does "cry out" for mushrooms or a veggie/s ie:brocolli, sweet onions,or anything you like.  I stir-fried thick-sliced zucchini and little squares of red onion and chopped portabellas in a garlic/olive oil, as a side, but will add to cook WITH the chicken next time.

My husband and I liked this very much--I skipped the thyme as I didn't have any, used chicken tenders which cut the cooking time by half, and also used light sour cream. The sauce had an incredible flavor and next time I plan to increase the amount of it so that it can be spooned over pasta or potatoes.

He is still raving about this one!  Such a nice change, when every chicken dish does not taste and look alike!  Be sure you like sherry, because that taste will carry though; and remember that sherry is rather salty, so don't overseason.  I made as-written (always the first time), and we licked the dish clean.  I agree that mushrooms would be a good addition (per other reviewers' suggestion), and I like the idea of doubling the sauce to serve over rice.  He is already asking if I'm going to make this again :)  Thanks Charlene for this great new family favorite!

Tried this the first time, exactly as written, and everyone at the table loved it. Since then, I've substituted whatever vermouth/wine I had on hand, including marsala, and cabernet--always good. I've also substituted other fresh herbs (e.g. tarragon), used dried herbs when nothing fresh on hand, tossed mushrooms into it--fresh or canned, depending on what was in the house at the time. My oven tends to run hotter than it should, so 30 minutes was just right. Never any leftovers! I'd have given it five stars, except that I try to reserve that rating for REALLY outstanding dishes. Four stars? Great.

As the other reviewers noted baking this for an hour gets it way overdone. That aside I tried a very similar recipe recently that had tarragon instead of thyme and rosemary which I likes.much better. I think that is personal preferance that. I like the flavor of tarragon more.

A good call I made was to search for and find a totally different brand butter and cooking sherry than what I'm accustomed to getting.  If you're low on sour cream--add in 1 and half cans Cream of Chicken / Mushroom soup.  Don't worry when you take dish out from oven and see sauce separation between it and butter. Remove chicken from baking dish onto a serving platter, and scrape clean ALL the sauce from the pan into a small saucepan and whisk or blender stir the sauce. THIS is where you can also adjust slightly more sherry, rosemary and/or thyme to suit your taste.  The family didn't leave leftovers---that earned the 4th star on this one.

My family loved it...I used EVOO instead of butter, and drained a lil of it off before making the sauce.  I just put a dash of the herbs into the sauce instead of on the chicken and I also only baked for 35 minutes...my 16 month old daughter wouldn't stop eating it...great recipe!!

Wow, simple, fast and easy to cook, and so good! I added a few mushrooms, but other than that followed the recipe. Sauce is delicious (a little thin, but full of flavor). We served it over wild rice mix and asparagus - perfect meal!

I made this tonight and it is perfect as is! The only change I made was to the amount of servings (2). Also, if you're looking for a side to go with it we just had it over minute rice, there was enough sauce to flavour both the chicken and rice.

I love this recipe and I have been making it for about 4 months now. I've deviated just a bit from the original recipe by adding about a cup of sliced button mushrooms.  I added a tiny bit of sherry to deglaze the pan that I cooked the chicken in, then sauteed the mushrooms and added the rest of the sauce mixture, and proceeded with the instructions from the original recipe. This really added more UMPH! to the meal, as well as a healthy dose of gasp! antioxidants!

I used 1-1/2 C Sour Cream and 1/2 C Red Wine as I didn't have enough Sherry. Didn't use Rosemary or Thyme...out of garlic and garlic Powder or I would have used it...did have onion, so browned chicken with onion. Covered in oven, not sure if I was supposed to? Very good - served on bed of rice and drizzled lots of gravy/sauce over. Mmmmm

I did make some changes but this was delicious!!!  I pounded the chicken breasts flat first and seasoned them before sauteing them. I used dried tarragon (in place of rosemary), thyme, salt and pepper to season the chicken. Browned the breasts on both sides and then continued cooking.  Added roasted garlic and onions to the pan.  Once I thought the chicken was cooked through (maybe 10 min) I removed them and deglazed the pan with the sherry then added the sour cream.  I put the chicken on top of egg noodles and poured the sauce over them.  Doing it this way made it quick as well as delicious and used less dishes.  I will definitely make this again!

With the addition of fresh mushrooms, this was delicious served with brown rice and broccoli.  I baked it for 35 minutes as suggested in another review.

Wow!  Yum!  I left out the extra step and just finished cooking the chicken in the sauce, rather than baking it the rest of the way, which saved me alot of time.  This also gave the oily sour cream a chance to separate (not sure how that would have turned out in the oven) and the sauce was plenty thick, the chicken juicy.  Thanks alot for the fresh and wonderful idea!!!!!!!!!!!!

I made this for my mother and father. My father raved about it.  And the best part was that it was so simple.  I took the advice of others and browned the chicken with some minced garlic.  Nice touch! Will def make again.

This is really yummy! I did add garlic and fresh chives per other reviews but would still be fabulous without changes.  We eat the chicken with basmati rice.  Wow!  A very delicious combo.  I am eager to try that sauce with other dishes, maybe fish.  Thanks for sharing.  FIVE STARS, BABY!

Wow. Yummers. Made this for a quick dinner when I had random things in my fridge. Didn't really measure the s. cream and sherry, just made sure it tasted zingy like others described. Accompanied with mushroom risoto. Did add a bit of garlic. AMAZING.

We had a terrible thunderstorm here this evening. I didn't have time to make the meal I was planning on, it took two hours to cook and everyone was hungry. I tossed this together and made some corn and a salad. It was very good. The sauce would be excellent with rice. I did put the sherry in the pan first and deglazed it well, and burned off some of the alcohol. Then I turned down the heat and added the sour cream. Next time it gets mushrooms added to it.

I did salt and pepper my chicken really well, before I sauteed it.

It's a keeper.

Delicious!  I sauteed fresh sliced mushrooms in the butter after I removed the chicken.  Then spooned them over the chicken before blending the sherry and sour cream.  Served this with rice.  Excellent!

This was a fantastic dinner.  My kids loved it making it even better. I agree with the cook time 30-40 minutes is perfect and I wish I had fresh mushrooms on hand I definitly would have added them. Wonderful dish!

This was great.  I did make some changes as some of the others had suggested.  I added onions and mushrooms and didn't cook it as long.  My husband summed it up the best - he said it tasted like something you would get in a restrauant.

Pounded my chicken breasts thin and added garlic powder. Used dried herbs and measured to my personal preference. Remember, if you use dried herbs instead of fresh, you need to reduce the amount. Very pretty presentation. Served with mashed garlic potatoes.

Thanks to other reviewers, I reduced the cooking time and made more sauce.  For my tastes, I'd reduce the spices next time, especially rosemary.

I made this for the first time last night and it was FABULOUS!  After reading the other reviews, I reduced the cooking time to 40 minutes and it was perfectly done, not the least bit dry.  My family loved it so I'll definitely be making it often.

The sauce was good but the chicken was way too dry.  I even cut the time down to 40 minutes per other suggestions and used thick chicken breasts.  Would probably not make again.

I made some modifications to the recipe, and it didn't suit my taste buds much, but my husband savoured it.  I was rushed on time and grilled the chicken while I prepared the sauce in a sauce pan, and poured it over the chicken when done.  I think my mistake was adding dried rosemary but will try this recipe again with some fresh herbs.  Three stars, but definitely worth giving it another try!

I admit I followed other reviewers' suggestions by adding a little chopped onion and garlic.  Also, because it is so hot and humid out, I flattened the chicken breasts and cooked it covered on the stove top.  It cooks faster that you think. I thought this was very good.  If you are looking for comfort food that is easy and delicious, you'll want to try this.

I loved the combination of sherry and sour cream.  I did add onion and mushrooms, and more sherry than in the recipe, but it was delicious.  Served it with Carrot, tomato and spinach Quinoa Pilaf from this site.

followed the recipe but we used whole leg quarters and I don't know how but a little extra sherry fell into the pan but it was no problem. We loved it and will make again and hope you will too. One problem I had was incorporating the sour cream, maybe I will temper it before adding because it didn't look great was a little lumpy but tasted great. Strangly when we reheated left over at high heat in the oven it smoothed out, so make it and enjoy!

Tasted good, and I would make it again. I doubled the sauce but it was not enough for me - not enough to use as gravy for noodles, so would triple next time.

We loved it as is!  I didn' have fresh herbs so I used dried.  My meat was very thick so I cooked it the full hour.  My sauce got extra thick but the meat was still very tender and moist.  So quick to get in the oven and so delicious.  We'll definitely make this again!

My husband enjoyed this. It is an easy recipe. We added sauteed onions and mushrooms to the sauce. Very good over rice.

I changed my recipe a bit..I sauteed some minced garlic, onion, and sliced fresh mushrooms in some olive oil and added that to the soup mixture. I also seasoned the chicken breasts with lemon juice and seasoned salt and pepper before adding the soup mixture. It was amazing.

This turned out great!  Like some others, towards the end of browning the chicken, I added a couple cloves of minced garlic and some fresh sliced mushrooms.  I didn't have fresh herbs, so sprinkled the chicken with some herbes de provence and then added the sherry/sour cream mixture.  Baked for about 45 mins (good size chicken breasts) and the end result was quite good...thanks for sharing!

Great and easy recipe!  I used bone-in breasts and thighs, baked for about 50 minutes.  Because of reader's comments that sauce was not visually appealing, I poured it around the chicken and not on top (probably not feasible if the meat was skinless).  I did not have any rosemary on hand, but a little extra sherry and fresh thyme gave it plenty of flavor.

I will definitely make this again.  My husband and company loved it.  I didn't bake it for the full hour.

This recipe is great and super easy.  The first time I made it, I didn't have thyme or rosemary and it was still really tasty.

Good recipe.  Made some of the changes suggested by others - added garlic and onion; doubled the sauce.  Served with basmati rice and the sauce was good mixed into the rice.  But I give it 4 stars because the sauce just wasn't that attractive - kind of curdled looking yet my sour cream was fresh.

After reading the reviews I also added garlic, and some green shallots. I also cut down the cooking time to 40 minutes. It did not look appetizing when it was done. The sour cream had curled, and I did remember to check the expiration date on the tub. Although I thought this was tasty, my husband thought it was gross. I will not make this again.

This had a slight vinegar taste to it which I enjoy but I'm not sure if a lot of other people do.  I served it over penne noodles but I think the sauce would go better with mashed potatoes.  I'll try it again by decreasing the amount of sherry and adding garlic and italian seasoning.

My family thought this was very good.  I addded diced shallots and garlic to the butter and sauted them before adding chicken.  I also added paprika to the spices, and only cooked for 30-40 min.  Next time I will also not add as much sour cream.
