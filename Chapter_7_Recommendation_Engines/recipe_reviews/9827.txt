These are EXCELLENT!!!  Some of the best cookies I have ever made.  I did make a few changes--half margarine/half shortening (I do this with all of my cookies...for some reason my cookies can turn out flat as frisbees, this prevents that from happening), and I did half brown sugar/half white sugar.  The end result?  OMG, cookies of divine chocolaty-ness, to die for.  Better than the local bakery's chocolate chocolate chip cookies.  I'd give it more stars if I could.  Happy eating!

Great recipe just as written.  Whenever a cookie recipe calls for butter I always chill the dough for an hour or so before baking as this prevents a flat cookie. The taste of butter can't be beat! The chocolate chips and nuts can be substituted with any variety of options...this time I used two King Size Hershey Bars with almonds, but vanilla chips, dried cherries, etc. could also be fun to try.  Great recipe, great cookie.  Thanks for sharing!

Ooo-ooo-oooh!  Marvelous little bites of chocolate heaven.  After reading previous reviews I was concerned about dryness after the first day so I used half butter and half butter-flavored shortening for the fat.  Since I was using a small cookie scoop, I used mini chocolate chips (baked for 8 minutes)...all I can say is they are perfect for a chocoholic like me.  For those who don't know this tip:  Line your baking sheet with regular old aluminum foil and you'll have no problem with cookies sticking.  Use a new sheet each time then slide the foil onto newspapers to cool slightly before removing cookies to wire racks.  Thank you for the perfect recipe!

A little update - it has now been more than three days, and the cookies are still wonderfully soft and chewy in my airtight cookie jar.  Also, if your cookies do dry out, try putting a slice of raw apple in there with them.  They'll soften up soon.  This apple trick also works for gingersnaps or any other cookie that gets hard quickly.  It also works for brown sugar that has hardened.  Don't leave the apple in there so long that it spoils, of course!

Long review alert!  Yes, even after 1000+ reviews, I am going to leave one!  Deep chocolate flavor, pleasantly (but not overly) sweet, soft texture but not too gooey, perfect height(not flat) and just downright irresistible!  I read through 100's of reviews and made the following tweaks to this recipe:  1/2 cup butter & 1/2 cup solid shortening instead of 1 c butter, 3/4 c white sugar & 3/4 c dark brown sugar instead of 1 1/2 c white sugar, 1 T vanilla instead of 2 t vanilla, used dutch processed cocoa, 1 t baking soda instead of 3/4 t, and added 1 t baking powder and 1 t instant coffee.  In addition I used aluminum foil to line the pans and that eliminated any sticking.  The dough was not sticky at all and it held together well without spreading (I didn't even refrigerate the batter between batches!).  Several tips for cookie novices (I learned from previous reviewers):  Mix the butter & shortening until fluffy, then add the eggs and vanilla and beat with a mixer until blended to death! When you think it's ready, do an extra minute.  Mix(by hand, not mixer) the dry ingredients before adding to the wet ingredients.  Mix the wet and dry ingredients with a wooden spoon until the dry ingredients are just mixed in.  THEN, using a hand mixer, continue to blend the ingredients until you don't see a speck of dry material!  At this point add the chips and nuts by hand.  I made 40 cookies at about 2 1/2 inches across. Death by Chocolate!  Whoo-hoo!

I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2c shortening instead of the 1 cup of butter and they came out similiar to the wonderful 'Otis Spunkmeyer' cookies!  Very tasty...be sure to use the lesser cooking time as they continue to cook on the sheet.

These cookies are great! They are very soft and chewy with a nice rich chocolate flavor. In fact, they taste just like little brownies. I was concerned they would not turn out because the dough seemed thick and sticky, but baking at 350 degrees for exactly 8 min produced a perfectly plump and shiny cookie! Using half chocolate and half white chips makes these so cute! I will probably add chopped nuts next time I bake these which is sure to be soon!

These are so chocolatey it's ridiculous!  Not a bad thing, but I'm definitely going to add more nuts next time.  They aren't dense, and they stay very soft.  The only change I made to this recipe was to follow the suggestion to use 1 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar (light brown, very lightly packed), and it's perfect.  Co-workers are giving thumbs-up!

I thought that these cookies were really good. Great flavor, my boyfriend loved them. Just make sure that you underbake them or they will get a bit hard.

These were just what I needed to satisfy the chocolate craving! They were more like cake than cookie and the faster you can eat them the better cause they do get dry and crumbly after a day
GREAT TASTE!

HELPFUL TIPS: I found no need at all to split this half white sugar/brown sugar especially since this is already perfect and sweet!!!  I've tried it both ways.  It's true that any combo of half butter/half shortening or all butter makes NO DIFFERENCE.  So if you're trying to decide what will make the better product, don't let this consume you.  Nice thick cookies = after mixing batter, stick it in the fridge for an hour+.  Take out and bake.  Took me 10 min and I usually use my batter the next day or two.  You can ALWAYS freeze whatever you don't plan on eating in a week.  Then just take out what you want the next week.  Will taste exactly the same and your family will love you! :)  I doubled the recipe because I freeze extras, and only used 2.5C of chocolate chips (mixed semi and milk chocolate) and it was PLENTY!!! I can't imagine putting more in.  SO... if I were to make 1 batch, I'd just use a heaping CUP.  This goes with any chocolate chip cookie recipe fwiw.

These cookies are to die for! I followed the recipe for the most part, substituting 1 cup of margarine for 1 cup of butter, using 1 1/2 cups white chocolate chips and 1/2 cup semi-sweet chips, and needed an extra 1/4 cup of flour (however, that's just because I use my KitchenAid stand mixer to mix the dough).  Instead of dropping by spoonful, I rolled into 1-ish inch balls and slightly flattened.  Let them bake for 10 minutes until the top started cracking. And they were heaven! Soft and moist and full of flavour.

These cookies are AMAZING! Even after they're cooled, they still have that melt-in-your mouth quality and the chips are still soft. They taste like brownies. Awesome awesome recipe just as it is!

These cookies are really good! I found it best to refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes before cooking--these makes the dough easier to manage and not quite as sticky. I used my cookies to make icecream sandwiches. Ofcourse to do that, just take 2 cookies and mash 1 scoop of softened icecream between them. Wrap up and freeze! :-)

This was a wonderful chewy yummy cookie.  I didn't find it to be cake like at all.  It has a very chewy fudgy taste. Like a brownie...but with cookie taste and texture.  I did change a couple of things though.  I used 1c. white sugar and then used 1/2c. brown sugar.  I also didn't have any nuts, so I decided I'd add 1/2c. coconut.  It was almost like a chewy chocolate macaroon, and the cookies stayed soft for as long as they existed in my house.

Great Cookies!!!  I made a double* batch.  I used 50% Butter and 50% Shortening.  2* cups White sugar and 1* cup brown sugar.  I baked them for 12 minutes (made 2.5 inch diameter cookie).  I also used walnuts.  Each cookie has came out perfect.

Whoa these are good! Definate keepers!
I only changed a couple of things: I used only half the butter called for and I also used 1 cup whole wheat flour. You can't taste the difference and they end up being a lot less greasy!
These cookies aren't cakey at all, they are very moist and fudgey...as long as you don't overbake them!

Very yummy!  I did make a few changes - I used all brown sugar instead of white (brown sugar will make for a moister cookie while white sugar makes the cookie crunchier) and 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract.    Other users complained of flat cookies so they integrated shortening...I didn't do this and my cookies came out great.  How flat your cookies are relates to how runny and sticky the batter is.    If you use slightly softened butter and beat the sugar/egg/butter mixture really well, the batter holds up and you get chewy, slightly flattened cookie but still holds it's shape very well.   If you nuke the butter in the microwave or bake on a hot day where your butter has melted to or almost to liquid form, the cookies will be thinner.    Try cooling the batter in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes then re-beating before adding in the flour mixture, and proceed as normal.    Also, I used 1/2 semisweet chips and 1/2 milk chocolate chips.  Next time I will incorporate white chocolate chips and milk chocolate chips to really give a variety of chocolate flavors.

If you're skeptical about this recipe, DONT BE!! This is by far the best cookie recipe I've ever made and tasted. I get all my cookie recipes on here and there has been soo many times a cookie recipe has had great reviews and they turn out horrible. But this is wonderful,especially if you love chocolate!!I did what many people said to do, use 1 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar. I can't say it enough,these are delicious!!!!:)MUST TRY!

These are very nice cookies.  My little sister, age 10, wanted to make double chocolate cookies, and this is the simplest recipe I could find, but we had to half it as we didn't have enough ingredients.  In particular, we had no semisweet chocolate chips--so what I did was chop up the bittersweet chocolate I had into small chunks.  The result were cookies that, because they weren't too sweet, were more grown-up than kids, in my opinion; but everyone loved them, especially my sister.  This one's a keeper!

This recipe was pretty good!  I took the advice of the people who didn't like this recipe and added a little more flour so that they wouldn't flatten as much.  I would also make half the sugar brown sugar rather than white.  (I didn't do that.  I was out of brown sugar, which is why I chose this recipe.)  They are a little brownie-ish, but not as brownie-ish if you bake them a little longer.

Oh my gosh!  These are the best cookies I've ever had.  I am a certified choc-o-holic and even I could only handle 2 of these cookies at a time.  They are so rich and so soft.  Even a week later they are soft.  This is my new favorite recipe.  
I didn't have any white chocolate chips (I don't care for them anyway, because chocolate isn't chocolate unless it's brown!) but they tasted wonderful and they didn't lack in taste in any way.  Everyone who tasted them asked for the recipe!

Good cookie. Good taste, but too crunchy.  Definitely the kind of cookie to eat right out of the oven if you prefer them to be good and chewy!!

This is an awesome cookie! It truly is my favorite.
Thank you for submitting this recipie!
Edited 11/15/2007: I still make these after all these years, it is one of my favorite cookie recipes of all time and I make a lot of cookies. If I could give it more stars I would. I never used nuts due to my nut allergies.

I used 1/2 chocolate chips and 1/2 peanut butter chips, and added pecans instead of walnuts.  My kids were crazy about them!

OMG !! These were soooo good!! I made these for a dinner. I ended up having way too much dough so I wrapped it in parchment paper into a log and then wrapped it in cling wrap and when I wanted cookies I would cut out a few and bake. Really yummy and the frozen dough stayed well for a couple weeks (didn't last long!! LOL!!)

Amazing, I would rate these higher if I could also. Unfortunately I am home alone and no one knows I have made them as yet, so it is taking a bucket of willpower not to eat them ALL.  Divine and thoroughly decadent. Thanks for this keeper Kathy.

Wow, almost 2,000 reviewers can't be wrong!  Marvelous cookies.  I used dark chocolate chips and cocoa on the second batch and they were even better.

Made these cookies several times and typically use half white sugar and half brown sugar.  Have used different extracts for flavoring (almond once, mint once with mint chips).  Always get asked for the recipe.

This is a good recipe on its own, but I substituted half a stick of butter flavored Crisco and 1/2 a cup of butter (to contain spread during baking). Added in both white and brown sugar, used Ghiradelli's dark chocolate chips, 3/4 cup of slivered almonds, and one packet of Starbucks VIA Italian Roast instant coffee. I had to beat off the kids with a stick (...translation: I had to make three batches)

Used 1/2 C shortening and 1/2 C butter.  Used a half/half mixture of brown and white sugar.  Moist inside, crispy out.  Very tasty.

These are one of my all time favorite cookies!!!  The texture is perfect, the taste is perfect.  The only think that I don't like is that every time I make them I never get any because they are all gone before I get a chance!!!

Wow! Unbelievable. Do not go near this recipe if you are on a diet! I used dark chocolate chips instead (they are "health food" you know). I should be super-"healthy" now ;)...! My kids said I was the best cookie-maker EVER! Thank you for the great recipe!

The batter was very thick and sticky, and didn't melt down into a normal cookie shape, the cookies pretty much just stayed weird lumps even after baking. I may flatten them with a spoon next time.

Delicious!  Definitely satisfies a chocolate craving.  I followed others suggestions and used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar.  Also, used a whole cup of chopped nuts - just didn't seem like enough compared to the choc. chips otherwise.  Used Ghiradelli's big semi sweet chips - they were great!  I've kept mine in an airtight container and they are just as fresh as the day I baked them.

Very good!  I had a huge craving for chocolate and these satisfied it!  I replaced 1/2c of white sugar with brown, as several people suggested.  I also only baked each batch for 8 minutes.  The batches I baked for longer we hard and crumbly the next day, while the 8 min batches stayed soft.

So I've been trying not to eat dessert lately after admitting to myself that I had A Problem. But today, I needed a chocolate fix. A VERY chocolatey fix.

I made these and they're perfect for what I was looking for. Soft, some crunch from the walnuts, gooey chocolate morsels in the center - delicious.

Changes I made:
1. I kept the amount of sugar the same, but divided it between white and brown sugar.
2. I halved the entire recipe because if I make 4 dozen cookies, I'll eat at least half of them.
3. I didn't have a cup of chocolate chips at home, so it was more like 1/2-3/4 cup of milk chocolate chips, and the rest were Ghirardelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chips.

The recipe yield was 17 cookies in the end (instead of 24), probably because I consistently make cookies a little bigger than they should be, and my boyfriend kept eating batter as I was plopping it onto the baking sheets.

Bake for 8 minutes exactly; don't worry if they look undercooked. That keeps them gooey + amazing.

I followed the recipe with the butter and had no problem with the consistency.  I have found that the main way to keep a cookie chewy is to completely melt the butter, whip in the sugar, and then let it cool down as much as possible without resolidifying before adding the eggs.  It keeps the fat in the cookie consistent instead of little melting pockets of fat in the oven.  My problem had more to do with the taste.  The beauty of a cookie is its simplicity but this still needed something extra-either an extract, cherries,  or caramel or SOMETHING other than chocolate chips.  Even my husband turned his nose up.  I did use dark chocolate cocoa powder because I prefer that extra depth but that didn't help.  I like chocolate chips in chocolate cookies but these were a little too much for me.  Thank you for posting (I enjoyed making them with my three year old) and I do suspect that it was a personal preference issue.

This is an outstanding recipe. Following other reviews, I did use 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, and because I used all butter, I chilled the dough for an hour. I also added dried cranberries, which is a great combination with the chocolate. Also, I was careful to underbake them (about 8 minutes) to keep them soft. After 3 days, the cookies remain soft, even the chocolate chips. If you happen to overbake an item, you can put it/them in a plastic bag and add a slice of bread. I usually place the bread on a piece of wax paper so it doesn't sit directly on the item. If it physically touches the item, the item will get very soft and a bit mushy. Thanks for the great recipe. Everyone loved them.

Fair winner!  My 9yo son made these as written and entered them in the county fair.  He won best chocolate chip cookie, and was a finalist for best of show out of all children's  cooking entries received.  We lvoed eating the left overs later.  Plus, since he only had to enter 6 cookies per recipe, we froze half of the dough.  It thawed and cooked just fine weeks later.

I had a feeling these cookies would be good when I noticed the unusually high number of reviewers who consider themselves "expert."  Such rave reviews from so many experienced cooks!  I was not disappointed.  I have made lots of cookies from this site and this is the first recipe I have written down and tucked away for future use.  Even though the ingredient list is short (I even used store brand ingredients!) and the method is pretty basic, they came out perfectly round, they didn't spread, they retained their nice shape after cooling, and they're still nice and soft the next day.  Just a perfectly wonderful cookie.

"MMMmmm!!!"  They are so delicious!  DEFINITELY let them cool on the cookie sheet before transferring them to the cooling rack.  I made the mistake on one cookie on the first batch and the cookie crumbled.  So, I left the rest alone to cool on there own before transferring them.

It's a shame there are not 6 stars available.These are totally fantastic cookies...I'm a bloke in England and like to try to bake things (much to the distress of my wife as I'm enthusiastic about the mixing but tend to be rather less than 100% on the tidying up).I used the reducer to make 20 and got 25 superb cookies although by the time they had cooled down I only had 22 and my wife was doing a good impression of a hampster and blaming Henry (our springer)for eating them !!!! Oh well,whatever. This was a fantastic,inexpensive and easy recipee (must be for me to make it!!!!)Congratulations to the author and many many thanks.

I made these cookies for my family and these are by far the best double chocolate cookies I have ever tasted.  I did the recipe just as it is written (I didn't think to look at the reviews first) and they came out wonderfully.

This recipe was included in the chocolate lovers cookbook that allrecipes sent me for free when i bought the "dinner tonight" cookbook. My husband actually baked these and although they tasted too chocolately right out of the oven ('cause the chips were melted and gooey) in my opinion these are best the next day when they are cooled down. I baked them for just 8 minutes, they looked undercooked but they'll end up nice and chewy. We used chopped pecans instead of walnuts.

These are fabulous!  I substituted the sugar with Splenda (cup for cup) and the chocolate chips with sugarfree baking chips and they are still delicious.  I can't eat sugar but my kids can, so I finally found a recipe that I can split in half and accomodate all of our needs!

These are so good.  I did use white chips and no walnuts.  The chocolate is almost brownie like but still a perfect cookie.  I'm almost sorry I found this recipe, it's absolutely perfect as written, but I want to eat a 1/2 dozen right now!  They are going to work tomorrow so we won't be tempted here at home.  * Update after taking them to work.  I got so many compliments, and one of my co-workers said it truly was the best tasting, best texture and best aftertaste that he'd ever had in his 50 some odd years!!  I take that as a high compliment.  thank you Kathy for such a wonderful, easy recipe that made me look good :)

DELICIOUS AND RICH! Added m&m's to some of the cookies per my son's request. Did not add as many chips as called for, may have only used about 1 1/4 cups or so. Did use nuts, they were good in there. Also used 1 c of brown sugar instead of 1 1/2 c of white sugar, turned out great that way, will do that again. 9 min was about perfect in our oven. Refrigerated batter when I wasn't using it to keep it from getting soft, but it was a really stiff batter.

These cookies are delicious and taste just like brownies!! Reading some of the reviews I did 1 cup white sugar, and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I cooked each batch for 8 minutes exactly and they were delicious. Also chilled the dough for an hour before cooking.

Great cookies, no complaints. a bit extra cocoa is nice and rich. Option: replace the vanilla with peppermint flavoring and they are nice and minty!

I've gotta say these are the stars of this years Christmas cookies, well these and the beautiful Chocolate Crinkles III because they look like they're covered with melting snow.   I upped the ante with a couple of ounces of chopped unsweetened solid chocolate and a few grains of course salt on top. WOW is the most common response after the first bite.

I gave this 5 stars for delivering exactly what it promises-a tasty, cakey, chocolaty cookie. My personal preference for a richer chocolate taste is to use bittersweet chips instead of semisweet and to use Ghiradelli cocoa powder instead of Hershey cocoa powder. We also used this recipe substituting mint/chocolate chips for the semisweet, and that was delicious.

These are chocolate truffle cookies...nothing less.  Very rich, great flavor when they are just slightly warm.  They are especially flavorful if you make them with half brown and half refined sugar (3/4 cup for both).

Incredible! The only change I made was to put 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup brown, baked for 8 minutes on a tin foil lined cookie sheet so they wouldn't stick. They came out of the oven looking very puffy, but quickly settled into the perfect cookie. Hours later, they are still wonderfully soft in the middle, with just a bit of crunch on the outside. I will definitely be making these again.

These cookies were PERFECT! Soft and chocolatey! I made a few adjustments. I used 3/4 cup white sugar, and 3/4 cup brown sugar packed. Also 2 TBSP of vanilla. I cooked them for 9 minutes and they are perfect! I just made these again and this time I used mini hershey's kisses chocolate chips and white chocolate chips and OMG!!!! If you are a chocolate lover...you'll pretty much orgasm in your pants.

Wow.... these cookies are just... well, the name says it all. I would like to share my own little take on these, which is perfect for anyone looking for the only possible way (in my humble opinion, anyhow) to improve upon these delights:
1. replace the chocolate chips with more or less the same amount of roughly chopped mexican chocolate, either bitter or semi-sweet (note: I'm not actually sure where you can find this... probably in food specialty stores, if not in your average super dooper market. For those of you who have never tried it, it is very grainy and sweet, filled with lots of cinnamon and spice) 
2. add in a touch of extra cinnamon if you so desire 
3. and for the ultimate twist... chop up 1-4 whole dried cayenne or other small red peppers very finely (remember to remove the seeds) and pop them in! It should add a really special and spicy note to the cookies that doesn't have to be overpowering. I understand that this isn't for everyone, but you should walk on the wild side and give it a go!

Came upon this recipe today while looking for another addition to my upcoming holiday baking list...I made two changes: used half light brown sugar in place of white, and didn't used nuts. This is a excellent recipe, not overpoweringly chocolately, just enough...they baked up crispy on the edges and tender inside, just like a cookie should be! I am definitely adding this to my holiday cookie list!

Delicous! The best cookies on this site. I followed the recipe exactly only without the nuts. Make sure you cook them for 8 mins, they will seem  underbaked at first but will firm up & won't be dry. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I was concerned when my first batch was so thick.  No need to worry as these cookies are amazing. Taste like little brownies.  The only change I made was 
1 1/4c white flour and 3/4c whole wheat(instead of 2c white) Cookies look a little underdone when they come out but are super moist when cooled.

I have tried this several times, now with wht. choc. chips as well.  I would say stick with semi-sweet choc. chips.  Conclusions I have made-Definitely add another 1/4 C flour.  Exchanging 1/2 C wht. sugar with brown is best.  These cookies actually turned out better on my air bake pan then on my Pampered Chef baking stone.  And add a piece of bread in with your cookies in an airtight container.  The cookies draw the moisture out of the bread keeping them softer, fresher longer.  This works with any cookie or pastry.

A week ago I took the top six Chocolate Chip Cookies from this website and made all of them.  I took the cookies to work and my church social, and asked people to tell me which cookies were their favorite.  This recipe got about seven percent of the vote.  Not terrible, but I didn't care for the cocoa-y flavor myself personally.

I could open a cookie store with this cookie!  They are so good.  I can't say enough.  I did put 1 bag of semi sweet chips and 1 bag of white chocolate chips and they are awsome!  I cooled them on a paper grocery bag because they are so soft, but cooled they stiffen up.  Thank you, thank you !

Wow - I've been looking for a good chocolate cookie recipe and now I've found it!  Soft and tastes like my favorite brownies!  I used 1/2 C butter and 1/2 C shortening, 1 C chocolate chips and 1 C peanut butter chips...they were great!

I made these for an outdoor summer potluck picnic, and people just gobbled them up! This is the first time I've baked in a long while so I was surprised how well they turned out :). A suggestion: half a teaspoon makes good bitesized cookies.

Definetely 5 stars.  A delicious cookie.  I just finished baking them and it's hard to stop myself from eating them all straight out of the oven.  The batter couldn't have been easier to make.  Perfect for chocaholics!

I made this for my wife and son last week, chocolate chip cookies are her favorite and they both swooned over these. I added 1 tablespoon of instant coffee to the batter which deepened the chocolate flavor more towards a dark chocolate cookie with semisweet morsels. Outstanding.

Made the exact same recipe from the Hershey's website. Made it as written, except that I substituted pecans for the walnuts, and used half white chocolate and half semisweet chocolate chips. This is an excellent recipe. I would give it more stars if possible. Thanks so much for sharing this!

Lovely cookies!  Totally satisfies the chocolate craving.  I made them as directed and they were great, very rich.  Now I cut back on the sugar (1/2 cup white, 1/2 cup brown) and I use 1 cup white flour and 1 cup whole wheat which hides well in chocolate. Still great!

I used a mint cocoa powder and added a bit of peppermint flavor.  My family doesn't care for nuts in their cookies so I left them out.

Very, very tasty cookies. This one's a keeper. The only changes I made to the recipe were halved butter (replaced with applesauce and veg. oil), Eggbeaters instead of egg, and 1 cup white sugar with 1/2 brown. When I took them out after 8 minutes or so, they were complete mush - THIS IS OK! It took me 2 batches to figure out that they would firm up after I let them cool on the sheet. They turn out chewy this way. For a more crunchy cookie, I cooked them just a little longer on a lower heat.

I would give these 3.5 stars - they were just OK to me.  I think next time I would make sandwich cookies with frosting in the middle to make them more exciting.

I took the tip to refrigerate the dough for a bit before spooning onto the pan. I also went ahead and sprayed the pan so it wouldn't stick. Eight minutes and VOILA! Delicious. They were a hit.

I dunno, these weren't bad, but if I'm looking for chocolate-chocolate chip cookies, I want them to be seriously rich and dark.  Since these only have cocoa powder in them, they turned out light and cakey, and kind of wimpy on the chocolate taste.  Guess I'll have to look for something using real baking chocolate.

Awesome cookies! I used half butter half shortening, the cookies came off the cookie sheet much easier than with just using all butter.  They also retained their shape better so keep that in mind if using shortening.  I didn't take the time to make the dough balls pretty, they look somewhat like dog piles but hey, they taste great! Used 1 cup white sugar and half cup brown. Will most definitely be making these again, thanks!

If you are a chocoholic, these are the cookies for you! They are so delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as it is written and the cookies came out perfect. I made them for a gathering and everyone is begging me for the recipe. Soft, chewy, decadent, delicious and super easy! I baked them on parchment paper just until set. Sure they deflate a little, but so do most cookies. They look just like chewy chips ahoy. Delicious even a few days later.

I'm sorry but this is truly the worst chocolate chip cookie recipe I've ever used.  I followed the recipe to a t- the cookies are dry and flavorless.  There is no salvaging this recipe, just try another one.

This was perfection!!!!! I would change nothing!!!! The only thing is the amount needs adjustment. I scaled the recipe to yield 72 and came out with 52. so those needing a certain amount should make the necessary adjustment to how ever many cookies they need.

These are definitely my favorite cookies and are always a big hit with everyone!  I make the recipe as is, which is the exact same as the one in my Hershey's cookbook (to a tee!).  I have substituted peanut butter chips for the chocolate chips before, and they are always a crowd pleaser!  Enjoy!

These are AMAZING cookies!  I used the half brown half/white sugar AND half butter/half shortening suggestions and the cookies came out gorgeous.  I also stirred in some Reese's pieces.   SUPER YUM!  I love this recipe!

Thank you for this wonderful recipe.  I made these cookies exactly as the recipe states and they were perfect; soft, chewy and the ideal size.  The recipe made exactly 48 cookies.  (I used a cookie scoop for uniformity.)  These cookies were such a hit with my family they only lasted two days in our house.  I asked my husband how many cookies he had eaten and he told me that he had lost count after 30.  I am going to make another batch today with one change.  I am going to use half white chocolate chips and half semisweet.  I think that the cookies will be more appealing visually.  Thank you again!

Very good.  I like to refrigerate my cookie dough.  It seems like they always turn out looking nicer and it makes them hold their shape really well.  Just scoop out a spoonful of cold dough and roll into a ball.  Also, baking on parchment paper ensures they won't get too brown or overcooked on the bottom.

pretty good.  i would stick with regular tollhouse chocolate chips.  i used the expensive ghirardelli chocolate chips and they didn't seem to taste very good for some reason.  and i think it needed a touch more salt because they seemed to be flavorless, like someone else had mentioned.  or maybe more sugar was needed.  still, not bad.

Did not turn out at all.  I ended up with barely baked cookies after following the directions exactly.  I had to increase the temperature 25 degrees and bake them for 11 minutes.  They taste all right, but not worth the mess.

11/1/11:  I made these cookies again and added amaretto and dried cherries.  They were delicious! So soft and rich and flavorful!  I can't wait to make them again!  I plan to add M&Ms next time and make another batch with the Andes Mint chips.  I can't wait!  This recipe is probably one of the best cookie recipes I've ever used!

These are really good!  I will definitely make these cookies again.  I used SR flour instead of AP flour, etc. and they turned out fine.  I made mint chocolate chip cookies using about half a bag of mint chocolate chips and one bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips...the mint flavor is not too strong.  I used the large pampered chef scoop and baked the cookies for 13 minutes or so.  I was really pleased with the creaminess and prettiness of the mixture before I added the cocoa.  I may use brown sugar and leave out the cocoa just to see how regular chocolate chip cookies would turn out using this recipe as a base.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for a chocolate chocolate chip cookie recipe one day and selected this one after reading some reviews.  I am so glad that I did!  They are awesome and so easy to make!  I kept them up on my screen until they were done in order to decide if they were worth keeping the recipe or not.  Well, they were!  I just made them for a second time in one week and had to become a member so that I could let everyone know that this recipe is totally worth making!  As someone wrote before, be patient and wait for them to cool before you enjoy!

Of all the cookie recipes I've tried (and I've tried about 20), these BY FAR is my favorite! My husband's coworkers have tried all of them too, and they vote this one as the best. I like to use half white chocolate chips and half milk chocolate chips. I also bake them for 11-12 minutes, or else they come out undercooked in the center. It helps to smush the dough balls down after dropping them on the baking sheet, too. Thanks for a super yummy recipe!

These were very good but not quite 5 star for my family.  Very easy to make.  My 10 year old made them with very little assistance.  They are very, very rich, and do get crumbly quickly.

These are perfect for those times when you need a serious chocolate fix. They are easy to whip up. I made them without walnuts, and I made one batch into about 46 cookies (heaping tablespoons). If you make them this big, you'll need to bake them for about 12-14 minutes.

If I have ever made a better cookie I can't remember when.  They were so good I felt compelled to say it after 3000 others have already.  I made no substitutions aside from one cup semi-sweet chips and 1 cup white chocolate because my daughter insisted they were too brown.  Who can argue with a 4 year old, I mean, really who can?

this recipe is awesome! love love love it!!! though i did reduce the amount of coco by a couple tablespoons, just based on some of the previous reviews. in the past my cookies have turned out flat (even when making sure not to over mix) but these turned out perfect and definitely NOT flat, which i loved!! Im glad to say i will never look for another chocolate chip cookie recipe ever again!

These cookies are very good. I recommend cutting flour by 1/4 cup as 2 cups of flour plus cocoa powder make for lumpy cookies.

At first, straight from the oven, these cookies are amazing! Like brownie cookies...

Then, when cooled, they smell weird and taste more like dry biscotti...

And then, after a few days, they smell funky.....
i don't think I'll be making these again....

Out of this world!!!!  Only changes I made were splitting the sugar...half white, half brown and used 1 cup chips and about 1 cup toffee chips.  Next time might try dividing flour...half white, half wheat.  Best cookies ever!

Someone said these were bakery quality, and I believe I have to agree. They are like a crisp and chewy chocolate chip cookie with a chocolate base. Only thing is I oddly prefer a cakey and not chewy cookie. These are quite sweet to. I can see why these have wide appeal though. I made 1/2 recipe and got about 2 and a half dozen using a standard cookie scoop. I was even 1/4 cup short on the chocolate chips and there still seemed to be plenty. I made them for a work office and I am certain they will all get eaten.

I'm not going to deny that they were tasty, but to be honest I am disappointed with these cookies. I expected something completely different. They taste like boxed chocolate cake... I hope that they will taste more like real cookies once they are chilled.

I decided to make these for my sick friend who said she was craving chocolate. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding M&Ms instead of chocolate chips (I wanted them to be a little more colorful!). She said they were the "best cookies ever!" I took the leftovers to other friends, and they all loved them, too. I got 5 dozen cookies out of the recipe, and I cooked each batch for 8 minutes.

Very chocolatey. I made as written but substituted some of the chocolate chips with PB chips. I put the dough in mini muffin cups then when cooled topped with home made PB frosting.

I made these as per the recipe once, and once using 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of all white sugar.  They come out soft either way, and we liked the batch with the brown sugar better.  Either, way, delicious!

I only put in about 1 cup chocolate chips and put in one cup of peanuts, and put in 3/4cup brown sugar, 3/4cup white sugar, instead of just white sugar.

These cookies are quite good but a bit ordinary - I used finely ground almonds instead of flour, since I try to avoid flour and often get very good results with the ground almonds.  I would NEVER use margarine as one rater substituted - any kind of vegetable oil that has been heated (whether in processing or in cooking) becomes hydrogenated and therefore a transfat. You are wreaking havoc on your bodies!!! Two oils that are safe to heat are coconut (buy organic virgin or extra virgin) and butter (preferably organic, but I know how expensive it is.) But PLEASE people, stop deluding yourselves with margarine!!! At least do it for the sake of your children.

This is a really good recipe. I did not use walnuts or any nuts. Put an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla, pure vanilla never the substitute in this house!  I also used whte/dark chocolate swirl chips. Highly recommend.

I've made a lot of cookies, and these just didn't work! Wouldn't flatten on pan, stayed in a ball, and bottoms burnt.  I modified with much better results by doubling eggs, and adding 1 tsp baking soda and cooked for 10 min instead of 8.  And they flattened perfectly without burning.

Perfect! Used margarine instead of butter and 1 tsp vanilla because that's all I had on hand.  Baked for 10 minutes on insulated sheet.  Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside and oh so chocolatey!  Need a tall glass of milk with these ones.  This one is definitely a keeper!

My choc-aholic boyfriend loved these. As I am not a huge chocolate fan, I thought they were very rich.  But, they were easy to make, and had a good texture, very moist- almost brownie like.  I will make again.

I usually find chocolate chocolate chip recipes to be heavy and dense, but this recipe is not.  Very yummy.  For anyone who wants to make bars out of it, I made 1 1/2 times the recipe, used half shortening and half butter, spread the mixture in a jelly roll pan, and baked in a convection oven for 20 minutes.  Less messing around than cookies.

these cookies are fabulous!!  I may never make plain chocolate chip cookies again.   Seriously phenomenal cookies!
 
i didn't add the nuts though, in my opinion the ONLY thing that could make this recipe better is using mint chocolate chips.  Adding the mint chocolate chips made this the best cookie I have ever eaten.

This was soooooooo good!!!!  I was looking for a cookie to make for my son's Christmas party at school and this is the winner.  I did add 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  Also used Nestle semi-sweet dark and white chocolate morsels and 1 cup of cocoa powder.  Definitely a keeper. Thanks!!!

These cookies are good but not exceptional.  I've made them before following the exact directions and they were way too sweet.  I gave them another shot and made them w/o the cocoa on another occassion and used half the amount of choc. chips and they still turned out OKAY.

Because of my boyfriend's egg allergy, I substituted 4 Tbsp water + 2 Tbsp vegetable oil + 4 tsp baking powder for the 2 eggs. The cookies still turned out great, though a little grainy, probably from the egg substitute. I also found 2 cups of chocolate chips to be far too much, especially since when the cookies were warm they were prone to fall apart because of the melting chocolate. Next time I make them I will use 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips instead of 2. These are great, though I still prefer traditional chocolate chip cookies.

I baked these cookies exactly as followed and they tasted like unsweetened cocoa! They also turned out with a "cake like" consistency. I prefer crisp on the outside & soft in the middle. I won't bake these again.

These are awesome. Soft and chewy,just the way my family likes them. I did use half dark brown sugar. I will make one change next time. I will use Milk Chocolate Chips instead of semi-sweet. Since the batter uses unsweetened cocoa powder, the batter does not taste as sweet as a traditional cookie. I think the milk chocolate chips would improve the overall taste. Of course, this is a personal preference. Either way, I think you will enjoy this very tasty cookie. My teen daughter said this was definitely a keeper recipe.

I make substitutions to make these gluten, dairy and egg free. I also leave out the nuts. This recipe lends itself very well to alterations as my family has multiple food allergies. I use Bob's Red Mill All-Purpose baking flour, Earth Balance Soy Free Dairy Free Buttery Spread. To replace the eggs I use 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/4 mashed ripe banana. I use EnjoyLife Mini Chocolate Chips. Everyone who has had these LOVES them and can't believe they are free of so many things :)

It was like eating cake; I didn't flatten my dough balls and they just poofed up and stayed there. Storing them in a glass cookie jar left sticky moisture residue on the inside which grossed me out, making me think they should've been refrigerated. 2 cups of chocolate chips is WAY too much on top of 1.5 c. of sugar and my head was dizzy after eating one, and I'd even reduced the chocolate chips to maybe 3/4 c., if that. My daughter liked them, comparing them to a brownie, but if I want a brownie, I want that crackled top and crispy corner, not an overly-sweet poofy cookie hybrid thing.

These turned out amazing!!! Used 1/2 brown sugar and made them about 1/4 C mounds so they would be nice and big and had to bake closer to 12 min. Definitely making more of these soon!

Chewiest chocolate cookies I've ever tasted and my sister, an insanely picky eater, gave them thumbs up . I didn't have chocolate chips so I just added extra cocoa powder and some almond milk, which gave them a nuttier softer taste.

These were incredible! I subbed butterscotch chips for chocolate, and wish I would have chilled the dough as a reviewer recommended, but they still turned out irresistible. This is going into the family recipe book. Thank you for a great recipe!

These are so amazingly good. I've made them with mint chips (delish!) and M&Ms (also wonderful). I freeze the dough in TBSP balls and then pop them still frozen in the 350 oven for 10 minutes. Great for surprise company or portion control (because it is actually possible to eat the whole batch in one night).

These are so good, but a little goes a LONG way. These are almost too chocolate-y, even for this chocoholic! Husband and son both just had one and said no way on the rest.

These hit the spot! Perfect for a chocolate craving. I halved the recipe and used slightly less sugar. I also goofed and used baking powder instead of baking soda, but they turned out lovely. I baked them on parchment paper so there were sticking issues. I'm definitely keeping this recipe for future use!

I made these with two friends and everyone wanted some! We didn't use walnuts, and I wouldn't recommend them. Overall, these were delicious and totally non-hassle.

Delicious!  The only change I made was the use 1 t of vanilla and 1 t of almond extract... I do that with nearly everything I bake.  I left them on the counter overnight (not on purpose, I fell asleep reading), and they were still deliciously soft this morning. Next time I might add just a little bit more cocoa, the cookie part could have had a little stronger chocolate flavor for me. Will definitely make again!

These cookies tasted delicious but came out very flat when I made them. I followed directions and read comments, but they came ou so flat it was kind of disappointing since obviously the appearance does matter too.

I followed the recipe closely. I did half brown and white sugar and left out the walnuts.  These were good but cakey.  I love chocolate cookies but its always hard to tell exactly when they are done because you can't see them brown.  I will try these again and cook them less.

Delicous, even the dough is sooo good. They were the perfect chocolatey dessert. I did change the recipe to 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 shortening. Also I added 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown. They were very chocolatey (not a bad thing) but I did cut back a little on the chocolate chips. They ended up being spectacular!!!

Added chocolate chips and mini m&ms. These cookies look pretty, taste great -- crispy on the outside, chewy inside.

In our oven, these needed 11 minutes to bake.

I only rated these a 3 because, they are really cake like. They are like miniature cakes, instead of cookies. They taste good and look good, but honestly way to cake like. I don't know how this could of been avoided.. but I wish I knew before I cooked them, maybe if I give them a day they will dry out a bit, but way to cake like for me.

I kept the recipe as-is, and I thought they were delicious and fudgy- exactly what I was looking for in a double chocolate chip cookie recipe!  I was diligent about taking the cookies out after only 8 minutes.  They do seem underdone at first, but I have a brownie recipe that is similar in terms of underbaking.  Sometimes you just have to trust the chef!

I made these for my chocolate loving son.  They were delicious.   A little too chocolatey for my taste, but I wouldn't expect anything different based on the name.  They were really easy to make.

Mine comes out crumbly and doesn't go together. I increased the butter and it helped a bit. This tastes awesome though. Great with vanilla ice cream. :)

CHOCOLATE ADDICTS BEWARE!

If you're a true choc-a-holic (like me!) you do NOT want to make this recipe!  One bite, and you're going to be going back to rehab!

Seriously, this is a VERY yummy chocolate chip cookie recipe.  I omitted the walnuts (don't like 'em and didn't have 'em), but other than that I followed the recipe to the letter.  The cookies came out soft and chewy, and oh so good!  I doubt this batch is going to last more than a day or two and there's only myself and my wife!

Thanks for sharing!  DEFINITELY a keeper!

Amazing! I added just about a tablespoon of oil to the batter to help moisten it and make it easier to stir. The cookies were super moist and gooey! LOVE them!

Perfect!!  

I used one cup chocolate chips, one cup butterscotch chips and no nuts.  

I also added an extra 2 tbsp of flour to have a rounder cookie.  

These are great!!!!

added the bigger, darker chocolate chips. These are like the best brownie, only in cookie form.  Took them to work & everyone wants the recipe.
BEST chocolate cookies I have ever eaten.

These are amazing!  Soft and chocolately perfection.  I chilled the dough for a few hours before I baked them, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  So very yummy.

These cookies were great! I looked at the reviews and made sure to use half butter and half vegetable shortening. Then I added some pecans. While I was making them I added a little extra salt on accident (I made it a heaping 1/4 tsp, probably closer to 1/2 tsp) and it was a wonderful mistake. The salty-ness and the chocolate and pecans and chocolate chips went together very well. My husband and people at his work LOVED it! :)

Great chocolate cookie recipe - the texture is almost like a brownie. I substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar for 1/2 cup of the white, and i used dark chocolate chunks and dried cherries. Wish I made more.

To scoop, I used a big ice cream scooper, and I baked for about 13 mins, and the inside was gooey and the chocolate was melting. Very rich, but great. Best cookies I ever made!! Made about 12 because each cookie was very big. Putting this one in my favorite!

I just made three different types of cookies using three different recipes I found on this website and I had to make an account just to say how amazing these cookies turned out! I followed the recipe exactly and shared them with at least 8 friends by now, all agreeing that these cookies came out absolutely great. They are so soft and chewy. !I don't usually bake and the directions were easy to follow as well. I didn't change anything except I used white chocolate chips and semi sweet chocolate chips.Also this made over three dozen for me so I had plenty to share.  This recipe was definitely the best one.

So wonderfully moist they remind me of two-bite brownies.  Substituted oil for butter and they still turned out wonderfully.  I will need to try adding some coconut sometime.

wonderful and easy!  They were a little chocolately/runny even after they sat on the cookie sheet for awhile so I stuck them in the fridge to cool them down before putting them in a container.  These are great when craving a good piece of chocolate with coffee or wine.

I am confident this recipe is spectacular as written. Of course, we all like to read reviews and put our own spin on things. I used half brown sugar, half white sugar. 1 tablespoon of vanilla, 1 t baking powder and 1 t baking soda. I used toasted pecans. I also added 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, which gave a nice kick that starts about halfway through eating the cookie.  It may have been a bit much for those who don't like spice and certainly not for children. However, my household and my neighbors thought they were amazing. Perhaps 1/2 t of cayenne would be perfect for those who like a little 'wow' but not too much.

These are delicious!! I used white chocolate chips instead, half brown sugar half white sugar, and no nuts. So yummy and they stay nice and thick. I baked 6 huge 3.5" cookies for 16ish minutes and they look like huge bakery cookies! And the rest made 3 dozen regular cookies. I'll be making these again!

Wowsers, I have never seen a plate of cookies disappear so fast before!  I found I made them too big and had to leave them in the over a bit longer.  They were great!  We made them without the nuts though.

Awesome recipe. Followed the recipe with one minor adjustment I used one stick of butter and one stick of margarine. I also used ghirardelli semi sweet chips which made the cookies taste even richer. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I just made these for the first time and they came out great! I actually didn't use cocoa powder because I accidentally bought sweetened powder and was too lazy to go exchange it, but they were still delicious! My only complaint is that 2 cups of chocolate chips might be a little much, but you can never REALLY have too many chocolate chips, can you?

These are by far my new favorite cookie! So moist and chocolately, its almost like a brownie in  a cookie! I didn't have any butter on hand, and so used margarine, so they are a little flatter than in the picture, but I usually use margarine in my cookie recipies anyway! I also didn't add any nuts (a few haters in my family) Otherwise followed recipie to a "T" and I have not had any issues with crunchiness, a very chewy cookie

My chocoholic husband declares these to be awesome. I followed the tips in the comments (replaced sugar with 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup dark brown sugar, replaced half of the butter with butter flavored shortening, cut vanilla to 1 tsp, added 1 tsp baking powder, and increased to 1 tsp. baking soda. I used Ghirardelli dark chocolate chips, and refrigerated the dough before baking. This one is a keeper.

These were so yummy! Made them this morning in a rush for a Christmas party and they turned out great.  Here are my changes:  1/2 c. apple sauce, 1/2 c. butter; 3/4 c. brown sugar and 3/4 c. white; 1 t baking soda and 1 t. baking powder ; added a splash of milk after chilling dough; only 1 c. of chocolate chips is plenty for one serving (I used green and red M&Ms on a different batch for Christmas spirit and those turned out great too!).  Solid recipe with the changes, thank you for a good bases!

The perfect cookie for any chocolate lover.  They were hard to tell when they were finished baking because they're so dark, but I managed to get it right and they were delicious!

Made these to give away during the holidays. I didn't change anything except I left out the nuts. My cookies turned out really soft and more cakey than I prefer. I like cookies chewy / crunchy if that makes sense! The flavor is good but the texture is not my thing!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  The only thing I changed was I put Andes Candies chips in them instead of chocolate chips to get that chocolate/mint flavor for the holidays!  Great work and fabulously yummy.

i love these cookies. soo yummy and chocolatey! i followed the directions exactly since i'm just a beginner and they were the best cookies i've ever tasted. i did put them in a little bit longer in the oven (12 mins) because of the airbake sheets i have. and used parchment paper. using one bowl to mix everything was convenient and clean up was also a breeze. thanks for a delicious recipe. people will think i've been baking for years!

Great cookies! I just made a few simply modifications and these cookies were a huge hit. I used about 1/4c more cocoa, used half butter and half butter crisco, used 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 dark brown sugar, 2 tbs of fresh espresso instead of the vanilla, used 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1/2 tsp baking powder.
12 minutes was perfect for baking, let them cook on the cookie sheet
For Christmas I dipped half of the cookies in almond bark and sprinkled them with festive sprinkles.
Perfect addition to our cookie exchange this year! :)

Great cookie. For my personal tastes I added twice the amount of walnuts and reduced the amount of chocolate chips to 1-1/3 cups.  Everyone loved them!

OMG they are amazing!!! First time I tried this recipe and it turned out great. I did make some changes from another reviewer and used half shortening/ half butter and used half semi sweet/ half white chocolate chips. I rolled them into teaspoonfuls and made about 70 cookies. Can't stop eating them. Thanks for sharing!!

This cookie is WONDERFUL! Some chocolate cookie recipes call for melted chocolate to add to the dough, but this cookie tastes fabulous and I think a lot of that has to do with the flavor that the cocoa powder adds. I followed this recipe exactly, except for one small change! I used white chocolate chips in a batch and Ande's Mint pieces is another. I will always use this chocolate cookie as a basic recipe!

This is a great tasting cookie, just like a brownie with a cakelike consistency.  I made no changes except for adding white chocolate chips.  The batter was very wet and I was worried about it spreading too  much, so I placed it in the freezer for about 30 min before using my small cookie scooper and they did not spread too flat at all.  I will be using this recipe again.  My kids really enjoyed it.

Fabulous cookies.  My family loves them!  I've made a few modifications - used Hershey special dark chocolate so they're to die for rich, plus I use at least 1 cup whole wheat flour (or whole wheat spelt) and sometimes 2 cups.  The cookies are so rich, no one can really tell that they're wholewheat!  I've also cut back to 1/2 cup butter along with 1/8th to 1/4 cup coconut oil.  This really gives a rich flavor but you will taste coconut if you do this.  Anyway, fabulous cookies, thanks for sharing!!

My new favorite chocolate chip cookies.  I was a little low on the chips, so I cut up some Hershey's milk chocolate bars to make up the difference.  Delicious!

Yum, Yum, Yummy! I used 1/2 brn and 1/2 white organic sugars, and half shortening and half butter. Next time I will try using all butter, cause I had to flatten these out with the bottom of a glass  dipped in water. They hardly spread out at all in the oven. Chocolatey deliciousness!

Oh my geez- WOW! These cookies are so freaking good. My 7 yr old said they taste like brownies- and they do. I did the half butter and half butter shortening. I also did half white and half semi-sweet chocolate chips. They came out soft and gooey on the inside. No need for me to ever buy pre-made cookie dough again. Love!

After 1800+ reviews, another is probably pointless, but these were so good that I just had to chime in!  I veganized these using Ener-G egg replacer and Earth Balance margarine, and I used whole wheat pastry flour and raw cacao powder in place of their respective counterparts.  The results were fantastic - a crispy, chewy cookie that no one would ever guess was eggless.  I will most definitely make these again!

I made the recipe as is only with white and dark chocolate chips and then chilled for about 30 minutes before baking.  Wonderful cookies!!  Everyone at work was also very pleased. :)

Delicious! I made these for culinary class and they were gone before the end of the period! XD they taste best if you mix white chocolate chips in with semi-sweet chip. :)

Excellent cookie.  Very easy to whip up and didn't change a thing about the recipe.  Omitted the nuts and didn't miss them.

This was EXACTLY what I was looking for in a chocolate cookie recipe!! Rich chocolate flavor, and moist and chewy texture. Didn't change a thing, they came out great. A great "chocolate base" to add any type of chips/nuts/coconut...anything you like. Thanks for sharing...will definitely make these at Christmas. A new favorite!

Just made these.  They are wonderful, but I guess the only complaint I may have is that they are more like brownies than cookies.  They are really, really rich!  If you like chocolate these are for you! I followed the recipe as written and omitted the nuts because I didn't have any right now.  Don't hesitate to make this scrumptious recipe!

Great cookies and very easy to make.  A group of about 12 friends made them all disappear in about 15 minutes.  If you cook them all at once, you'll need to leave them in the oven longer than 10 minutes.

These were so good!  I used pecans instead of walnuts, because we have allergies to walnuts and peanuts.  Otherwise made as stated and these are to die for! My kids are going to be so happy to eat these!  Thank you so much for sharing the recipe.

These are absolutely delightful! My kids love them! I was looking for a chocolate walnut cookie recipe and nothing caught my interest. Then I found this one and decided to keep the batter as is and substitute 2 cups chopped walnuts for the chocolate chips. I don't know how long I baked them for - I just waited till the tops weren't glossy anymore. I loved the mousse-like batter. I don't think I got 4 dozen cookies - I couldn't keep my fingers out of the batter! I will definitely make these again. Thanks for sharing for sharing your much loved recipe, Kathy!

Not bad at all!  Dough is very thick. Don't use Crisco in place of all the butter or you'll have a very dry cookie.

Nice flavor...chewy like a brownie.  Added semi-sweet, milk, and white chocolate chips.  Came out a little flat though.  Will try combo butter and shortening next time.

WOW! These are great!  I had a Cookie Making Party for some kids on summer break & this was one we made.  Super good, gooey, and chocolatey.  Rave reviews by everyone!  I followed the recipe as listed and refrigerated the dough for about an hour and it will be a keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies turned out great.  I did not use half shortening or half brown sugar as many reviews advised and had no problem with the cookies flattening or getting stale quickly. In fact, I forgot to cover the cookies overnight and they were still soft the next morning.  I did use 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1 cup semi sweet chocolate chips to add a little contrast, but I think all semi-sweet would taste better.  Trust the recipe as written!

I used half white sugar and half brown sugar as well as all whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour. I also used some shortening, some butter, some oil and some margarine. Also I only had 1 egg so I used 1T of water and 1t of oil and 1t of baking soda and a piece of banana roughly and it worked out great! :)

These were wonderful!!

After reading through some of the comments, I subbed 3/4 cup of brown sugar for half of the white...they were delish! My family gobbled them up.

Also--I only use real butter when baking, and the tip to chill the dough for one hour before baking worked wonders!! No more flat cookies--these turned out thick and fabulous!

I followed other reviewers' suggestions. I substituted some white sugar for brown sugar. Then to make sure they were going to stay soft and chewy, I added a box of vanilla pudding. Also, I used Guittard mint chips instead of chocolate chips and they tasted like Andes mints, but in cookie form. Great chocolate cookie base and the mint made it a wonderful combination.

Ohmygod..I LOVED these cookies!!!  I had a craving for something SUPER chocolaty, and this sure did the trick!  I used half brown/half white sugar, 1/3 c regular cocoa powder and 1/3 hershey's special dark cocoa powder, and a bag of choc chunks.  OMG these were so intensely chocolate and I LOVED them!! I will def be making these again and again :~)

So good!  Made as written and the dough was very thick. I cooked one batch but ran out of time so I had to refrigerate the rest and cook it later. Both batches cooked the same with just another minute on the refrigerated batch. This recipe is a keeper!

A stellar cookie! I substituted butterscotch chips for the chocolate chips (I think white chocolate chips would be awesome too!) and added a bit of coconut. Just eyeball it! Can't go wrong!

I must say, these are pretty delicious. I didn't use chocolate chips or walnuts, but instead opted to make white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookies with this. They were amazing! I did make a few small changes. I used 3/4 c. white sugar and 3/4 c. packed brown sugar instead of 1 1/2 c. white sugar. Also, I baked mine on 375º for about 10 minutes (though I line my sheets so it takes a wee bit longer than normal). Thanks for sharing this....just what I was looking for.

These cookies are excellent, but they should definitely come with a disclaimer:

**If you do not have mixing equipment, the batter is REALLY hard to stir!**

My arms are exhausted from stirring, even after I added almost a cup of milk.  The milk (which the recipe did not call for) also contributed to my cookies being flat as pancakes instead of nice and chunky like in the picture.
Bottom line- excellent cookies if you have mixing equipment or a really strong man!

Very good!  I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown.  Also, I creamed the butter and sugar together first before adding the eggs and vanilla.  Other than that, I followed exactly!  Baked for about 9 mintues.  Used white chocolate chips.

I don't usually say this, but this recipe really is good enough to give more than 5 stars.  I bake A LOT and I would say this is one of the best if not the best cookie recipe I've ever tried.  I tried it with mint and chocolate chips which were our favorite.  I also tried them with peanut butter chips (in my opinion, the only way to do this justice is to LOAD up on the peanut butter chips) and toffee bits.  The cookie has the perfect texture when cooked at 8 minutes and then cooled for several more on the cookie sheet.

These turned out so well!  They were moist and a bit chewy and oh, so chocolatey.  I froze them after cooking and they were also good, just not as chewy.  Got lots of complements on them.  Followed the recipe without any changes and it worked.  Would definitely make again.

All little bit of Chocolate Heaven! I modified this recipe in the following ways: I used 1 c white sugar and 1/2c brown sugar, rolled the dough into balls, baked for 10 minutes to allow for the extra thickness and about 3 minutes after I  pulled them out of the oven, I pressed a Hershey's Kiss into the tops of each one. Oh My Gosh!!! So good! So rich! So YUMMILICIOUS!!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe Kathy! I'm 100% positive I'll be making these cookies again and again and again! Great for sharing...I'm giving a batch to my mailman for Christmas!!

Very good cookie. Soft, chewy and chocolatey.  I used dutch process cocoa, and split the sugar between white and brown.  For Christmas, I dipped half the cookie in white chocolate and crushed peppermint. Overall..thumbs up.

These cookies are amazing! I followed everyone's reviews and suggestions and I used... 1/2 cup Crisco (shortening) w/3 tablespoons water 1/2 cup Margarine 1 cup white sugar 1/2 cup packed brown sugar I also used 1/3 semi sweet chocolate chips, 1/3 Peanut butter chips and 1/3 milk chocolate chips. I refrigerated the dough for 30 minutes to make sure they didn't come out "Flat" and they turned out PERFECT! If you love chocolate cookies this is the most delicious recipe to use!

Great and easy recipe! Didn't even use a mixer. Only advice is to chill them for 20-30mins before baking so to avoid flat cookies!

These were delish!  My 15 yr old daughter made them and we loved them.  We added a partial bag of Andes Mints pieces (hubby wouldn't stay out of the bag).  They tasted similar to a "Thin Mint" cookie.

I've made several batches of these cookies and everyone absolutely loves them!  To make them a little more festive for Christmas, I substituted red and green M&M's for the chocolate chips.  My husband really likes how they're light and fluffy and I like how they're super chocolaty :)

These are the best cookies on the PLANET!!! I use 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup dark brown sugar.Also a tablespoon of water before I add white chocolate chips, 60% cocoa chips from Ghiradelli, and 3/4 cup of chopped macadamia nuts to help make the batter more moist. Oh and HALF THE BUTTER!!!   My husband and father in law were blown away at how tasty these cookies were!!!

These are ridiculously good. I wanted to replicate the cookies from subway and tried these with white chocolate chips and semi-sweet chocolate chips. These turned out a million times better than the ones at subway. Not only that, but they're so chocolatey I can't eat more than one or two at a time before my chocolate craving is satisfied for quite a while. I had to bake them for s few minutes extra, otherwise they'd be mushy in the middle, but that was no problem to adjust.

Very, very good cookies!!  Two tips:  First, make small cookies.  These are rich chocolate cookies and they cook better if you do as the recipe says and make them “rounded teaspoon” size.  Second, if you add nuts (I prefer pecans but walnuts also work) chop them finely and take a couple of minutes to roast them in a skillet over a low flame.  Doing this intensifies the flavor and changes the comments from “Hey, are there nuts in these?” to “Wow, the nuts and chocolate really make a good combination!”  After roasting spread them out and let them cool before adding to batter or you will melt the chocolate.

These stayed wonderfully soft... but seemed to get a little dry after a few days, like all the homemade cookies I've ever made.  I can't figure out what's different about this recipe that makes them stay so soft and chewy, but it's good!  These are wonderful if warmed in the microwave for 5-7 seconds... makes the chocolate melt and the cookie even tastier.

I made these with white chocolate chips and they were great! Just be careful not to overcook them, its difficult to tell when they're done because the dough is so dark.

Excellent recipe!  They came out so soft and chewy.  I actually used 1/2 cup brown sugar (as other reviewers suggested) and 1/2 cup Splenda blend.  Other than that...as is!  Also, I baked these for exactly 8 minutes and they were perfect.  Thank you...

This was a great recipe but I did change it up a little bit.  I was trying to duplicate some cookies I had about a year ago.  I subed half the butter with butter shortening in a doubled batch.  Instead of choc chips I used snack size packs of Reeses cups, snickers and milky way bars cut into chunks. They were awesome!

These are the best, after reading a few reviews I did make some changes, first split the sugar, instead of all white I did 3/4 c brown, 3/4 white, next I did 1/2 & 1/2 of butter and shortening, and used 1 c milk chocolate chips, 1 c white chocolate chips,  once done, I used a med size scoop to form the cookies and put them on the cookie sheet, i chilled the whole pan and dough for about 1 hr while doing other things, then I baked them in the oven, they did not flatten out like some other people mentioned, it helps chilling the dough prior to baking. I'll be making these next christmas.. I only bake once a year and I go nuts when I do, these will be on the Christmas list for years to come. Thanks for sharing. Happy Baking!

I personally would have given these cookies a 4 because they were SO RICH..although the next day the flavors did blend a bit more.  I gave them a 5 because I sent these into work with my hubby to share and they were a HUGE hit.  I even got a phone call Thanking Me for these cookies...Be prepared to share this recipe!!!

Although this recipe was very chocolatey and I could tell it would be excellent if made as the recipe states...I am trying to bake a little healthier and replaced the sugar with granulated Splenda.  The cookies didn't really spread/rise much and after they were cooled they were pretty dry, but still edible.  I'll definitely try this one again with real sugar, I can tell the potential was there for this to be an excellent chocoholic's dream cookie!

I thought this recipe was just ok. These cookies tasted more like very sweet, homemade brownies. I think I was expecting something less sweet. Also, they were kind of cake like - not what I really wanted from a cookie recipe. Not bad, just not what I wanted.

Delicious! I did half butter and half shortening. And half brown sugar, half white. The cookies stayed moist even the next day! To make sure your cookies don't flatten put the dough as well as the cookie sheet in the freezer for a few minutes prior to baking.

I have made these cookies many, many times and everyone always loves them.  They are soft, oh-so-chocolatey and absolutely delicious.  I do usually have one small adjustment to the recipe:  I use 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1 1/2 cup white sugar.  I found this makes the cookies even softer, and it's more in tradition with a chocolate chip cookie recipe.  I have found, also, that you can substitue almond extract for vanilla (or a combination of the two) for a little variation on the flavor and it's still delicious.  I'm going to go enjoy one of these babies now ;)

I have tried 3 or 4 different cookie recipes from this site, and none of them turned out good. This one is the BEST! I did halve the butter(not sure how it would've turned out otherwise) and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Also,you should underbake them a tad so they don't dry out. Next time I'm trying this recipe w/peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips!

These were delicious! Definitely a bit tricky with bake time - half of my cookies came out burned on the bottoms, half came out fine. Definitely watch them carefully while you're making them. However, they are well worth it! I definitely plan on making these again.

WOW! Followed others' advice and used 1/2 c butter & 1/2 c shortening, 1 c sugar & 1/2 c brown sugar. Also used semisweet chunks & bittersweet chips. Lisa's chocolate fix was totally cured after eating these :-) Thanks for the killer recipe!

I made these two weeks ago and just now getting back up off the recliner to write about them.  I was going to take them to my neighbors pancake supper, but found them to be so good that I ate them all in one sitting.  I really would recommend these cookies for sure. Evelyn

Too good for words! These are the most chocolaty cookies ever! Substituted the nuts with mini morsels instead for extra decadence. Followed the rest of recipe as written. Used air bake cookie sheets and baked for exactly 10 minutes. Agree with earlier review that the cookies will look unbaked but don't let that fool you. Definitely let cool on the sheet for about 4 minutes before transfering to a rack and they will be perfect! My family devoured them.

I was a little skeptical about only cooking these cookies for 8-10 minutes. At about 10 minutes they still looked really soft but I took them out anyway to let them cool.  After letting them cool, I tried one and I have to say these are the best cookies I have ever had! Ten minutes is perfect!

By themselves, these were amazing. The second time I made them, I went a little nuts and added not only the semi-sweet chips, but some Peanut butter Chipits, chopped macademia nuts, and some all natural peanut butter. They weren't as fluffy, but I thought they were even tastier. These will be my contribution to the 10 or so guys here tomorrow for the Superbowl.

This recipe is wonderful! The cookies are very, very rich and chocolatey, so it is hard to stop at just one! I skipped the nuts (my sister is allergic) and used  1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips; I stirred the remaining half cup of chips in towards the end of shaping. I do this because the last few cookies are usually short on chocolate! My family really liked these cookies, and I will make them again. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

Made with King Arthur Organic White Whole Wheat Flour, these cookies were fabulous.  Even the most whole wheat phobic would never suspect that they were 100% whole wheat.  I did make them slightly larger (I got 36 cookies out of this recipe) but found that they were perfect after 10 minutes in the oven.  They look like they are not done, but will firm up and remain chewy and moist. I am looking forward to using other types of chips in this wonderful recipe.

very easy recipe!!! came out great on my first time doing choc/choc chip cookies.
delicious flavor, not overly sweet. if you bake for 8 min's, inside they keep the consistency of brownies, if you bake for 10 min's they get crunchier.
i used organic/natural cane sugar and a little less vanilla extract (because i ran out), but they were still delicious...
ALSO i made a few "Spicy" ones by adding a little cayenne/cinnamon spice. they were great!
so very versatile recipe too.

Yum! Very rich cookies so you can't really eat more than one but that's okay with me! My batter looked really dry so I added a smidge of oil but they probably would've been fine without.

Revised review after doing the batch in full--great cookie!  I tried halving the batter and for some reason the first batch came out dry.  When I did the whole thing at once (and sent the cookies to hubby's office lol) they were fantastic.  Adjusted add-ins to 1.5 c chocolate chips (kept walnuts the same) so I could add in .5 c dried cranberries.  Really good contrast to the sweetness of the cookie.

These cookies turned out perfectly! Do not listed to that last review about flat as pancakes...if they turn out flat as pancakes it's b/c your baking soda is bad.  Use baking soda that is not out of date and hasn't been opened and sitting in your fridge for more than a couple months and these will plump up perfectly! I used half brown sugar, half white sugar. Bake these!  They're good!

These cookies turned out GREAT! 

I made the dough with half butter, half margerine. Then, I wouldn't have to worry about the cookies spreading. I also used the miniature chocolate bars that I'd cut into bits in place of the chocolate chips, for a bigger chocolate flavor. When I was done with the dough, I covered it and stuck it in the fridge to firm up overnight.

When I made the cookies this morning, I stuck some extra chocolate chunks on top, for a prettier finish. 

These are great for a choco-holic like my husband and really aren't difficult to throw together. They make for a pretty cookie. These would go quickly at a bake sale.

I'll have to remember this cookie recipe the next time I have PMS and need a chocolate fix.

Man, I thought I loved chocolate, but these were almost too much.  Next time, I'll cut back on the chocolate chips and add more nuts, but that's a personal preference.  These would be good with white chocolate, peanut butter or chocolate mint chips.  I'm sure I'll make these again.

Wow!  These are great!   I added 1/2 cup chopped pecans instead of walnuts because I like the flavor better but otherwise followed the recipe.    Others are right - dough is very thick, thank goodness for kitchenaid stand mixers.

I followed the recipe exactly. Yes, the batter was thick as others said. But I used a handmixer and was able to mix it up just fine. Stirring in the chips was tough but worth it since the taste was fabulous! I had to bake these 10 min exactly.

This recipe is pretty spectacular, but it was WAY too thick when I made it as per directions (which I followed to a T).  I added a bit of vegetable oil until the consistency allowed me to mix in the chocolate & butterscotch chips and almond slivers I was using.

Other than that, they're amazing.  Took me a bit longer, 10+ minutes to get them cooked.

Thanks so much!  They have the best taste of any chocolate cookie I've made.

These are the best chocolate/chocolate chip cookies ever!  I followed the recipe exactly as written, except that I used dark chocolate chips and no nuts.  SOOOO GOOOD!!!  I did find that my oven took longer than the 8 minutes though.  It could be that I was using a scoop though, so the cookies were kind of ball like when I put them on the cookie sheet.  I had them in the oven for about 10 minutes.

These are absolutely wonderful cookies.  Even better, you can freeze the balls in ice cube trays, and they will stay well in the freezer.  To cook those, preheat oven to 350, put frozen cookies on tray, and bake for 10 minutes.  They will be delicious: crisp on the outside, and melting goodness on the inside.

these were to die for. i was making them as a gift for someone but ended up eating a bunch myself. i subbed out white sugar for brown and added an extra egg yolk. it makes for really chewy cookies. i also used margarine instead of butter and added white chips as well as regular semi-sweet. they were absolutely perfect.

My husband and I really liked these cookies. I usually make Chocolate chip cookies, but once I saw this recipe, I had to try it. Let me just say, they didn't last long in our house! Haha!

Great cookies! I'm a novice at best, these are easy to make and delicious! I followed the directions exactly except added 1/2 cup more walnuts and baked them for 15 minutes. I guess each oven will vary with cooking times. Thanks for sharing this!

These are sinfully delicious.  I almost wish I hadn't made them because I've eaten almost all of them!  My husband said they are the best cookies he's ever eaten.  I used peanut butter and chocolate chips and halved the recipe with no problem.  These will definitely be on our Christmas cookie list.

These cookies are so good!  I brought them to work, and everyone loved the soft and chewy texture.

I did make some alterations to the recipe.  I used 1 cup white flour and 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour.  I also substituted 1/4 cup of the white sugar for brown sugar and 1/4 of the white sugar for Splenda.

I think these are like brownies in cookie form.  Absolutely delicious!  The walnuts are a must.  I made these for a party and the entire batch was almost devoured.  The best part is that the few I took home stayed perfectly soft till the next day.

So delicious and rich!  These cookies disappear fast at parties.  I use chocolate chunks and sometimes add Heath Bar bits.  Lately I have been microwaving them and serving them with ice-cream on top.  Yum!

To die for!  I added a couple of tablespoons of instant coffee, in one batch, and threw blueberries into the next.  Even though I generally lust after the darkest chocolate possible, I loveloveloved these with mini chocolate Kisses.

I don't understand the 5-star reviews most users gave this cookie; they are not that good at all!  The amount of sugar makes them sweet enough, but they really lack flavor!  I didn't even enjoy eating the dough, and that's pretty much unheard of for me.  The only flavor is from the chocolate chips...I doubt I'd make this cookie again, but if I did, I'd try something other than just cocoa powder.  On top of that, I couldn't get the cooking time right...8 minutes they definitely were not done, 10 and they appeared done but wouldn't come off the cookie sheet without crumbling, 12 and they got a bit burnt.  Of course, they are edible, but I think I'd be embarrassed to put them out saying I made them.  Very attractive cookie, though.

Great cookies! I used half butter and half butter flavored shortening. My butter was salted so next time I'll either reduce the added salt or omit it all together. I also used mint chocolate chips. SUPER YUMMY!. Maybe next time I'll try peanut butter chips.

What yum-alicious cookies!  They are a bit sweet but I'm only blaming myself for overindulging on them (they were so good I couldn't stop myself from eating 4 of them).  I followed the advice of previous posters and used 1c white sugar and 1/2c brown sugar but did not up the cocoa as others had suggested.  These cookies are definitely keepers.

Yummy!  I used milk chocolate chips since that was what I had at home.  I added a bit of vanilla, and used half a cup of brown sugar instead the last half cup of white sugar.  My husband loved them.  I'm guessing they would be super with peanut butter chips as well!

This was a great cookie!  I used the tip of using 1/2 cup brown sugar and reduce white sugar to 1 cup.  They turned out great!  They are a little richer than the traditional chocolate chip cookie, but my kids don't argue with me when I only give them 2!  I will make these cookies often!

I made these last night and they are awesome.  I had some black cocoa powder that I had gotten from King Arthur and used 1/3 cup of that and 1/3 cup regular cocoa powder.  I also used the swirled milk and white chocolate chips.  These cookies didn't flatten out like most cookies that use butter and in fact I used a cookie scoop and then had to flatten them out with my fingers so they would bake better.  I have a convection oven and lowering the temp 10 degrees and doing them for 9 minutes they came out crunchy on the edge and chewy in the center.  These are definately a hit with chocoholics!

My husband is a chocolate chip cookie addict, but I prepared this batch and he was raving about them. You don't have to eat many cookies, it's a delicacy that you can fully enjoy in only one cookie.

Ultimate chocolate satisfaction!  Very nicely textured cookie -- soft & moist.  My only complaint is that after a day or so, they become hard & crumbly.  If they last that long, that is.  My kids love to help me make these; they're very easy and tasty.

These had a nice flavor, but for the life of me I could not get them to get done without burning!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I tried my regular oven, and my convection toaster oven.  I tried making them smaller and flattening them a little before baking, but they went from gooey dough to burnt on the bottom in seconds.  I wanted to give them to the neighbors as gifts but was too embarrassed.  I will not make these again.

Outstanding cookie!  I don't usually even go for double chocolate cookies, but my husband requested them, so I went to Allrecipes.com and printed out the one w/ the highest ratings.  Am I glad I did!  (So are my husband and son!  My son told me, "Mom, you really are the best, and I'm not even saying it just to make you feel good."  Ha, ha, ha!)  Anyway, as is my norm, I tweaked the recipe just a little...used 3/4 C. butter, replaced 1/2 of the granulated sugar w/ light brown sugar, increased the cocoa to 3/4 C., left out the walnuts, and accidentally added 1 C. Butterscotch Chips to the 2 C. milk chocolate.  Excellent!  I'll add this recipe to my "cookie rotation".  Wow!

I just finished making this recipe and it is terrific.  Very flavorful and chewey.  I also substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I think is the fastest easiest chocolate chip cookie recipe I've ever done.  I used parchment paper and didn't burn a single cookie bottom.

These were great - I used 1/2 c. brown, 1 c. white sugar as per other reviews and think next time, I'll do half and half.  I'll also use a full cup of cocoa to up the chocolate "shock" and use the nuts, which I left out this time.  Great recipe!

As close to Mrs. Fields' version as I've found!  I followed the recipe exactly and used dark dutch process cocoa.  They turned out perfect!  Just don't overcook them!  Mine were small so were baking in 6-7 minutes.

I WAS LOOKING FOR A CHOCOLATE COOKIE RECIPE THAT I COULD ADD PEANUT BUTTER CHIPS TO TO  MAKE REESES PIECES COOKIES. THIS IS THE FIRST ONE I PULLED UP . THE TEXTURE WAS NICE AND MOIST AND HAS A GOOD FLAVOR . WHAT I REALLY WAS LOOKING FOR WAS A MUCH RICHER CONSISTENCY . ANYONE HAVE AN IDEA ? I WAS THINKING OF TRYING EITHER A HERSHEYS CHOCOLATE SYRUP OR , MAYBE , EVEN AN ICE CREAM FUDGE TOPPING .

I tried these twice. The first time I followed the recipe and they came out way too dry, almost like cake or something (not good!). The second time I took the advice of some others and used 1cp of flour instead of 2. The cookies came out extremely moist and soft. I gave this 3 stars because they still weren't very sweet and required a lot of tweeking, including changing sugar to 1/2 white and 1/2 brown. I think I will look for another recipe and ditch this one.

You know how I know this is a good recipe?  I'm a college student and live with four other girls.  The cookies lasted approximately 25 minutes.  Lol, next time I'll have to double the recipe.  I did as other suggested and used both brown and white sugar, and the cookies came out great!  Thanks!

Fantastic!  I made several batches of these during the holidays and they were gone in a flash.  Definitely is a keeper.  Be sure to decrease white sugar to 1 cup and add 1/2 cup of brown sugar as mentioned in several reviews...makes such a difference.

YUMMY & oh so chocolatey!!!!
I added white chips & semi sweet chips along with the new swirled chips for a little color.
This recipe is most certainly a keeper.

I made these for my nephews and they were a huge hit.  I didn't have enough cocoa powder so I substituted with hot chocolate powder and they turned out great.  I later made them with only cocoa powder and I thought they were a little too intense.  Next time I'll stick with half cocoa powder and half hot chocolate powder.  A definite keeper!

These were excellent! Chewy, with crunchy edges, light, super tasty....  I used Reese's Pieces instead of chips, which I highly recommend- they made the cookie even better (if possible).

These are fantabulous!
I did alter the recipe a bit though: I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup lightly packed brown sugar. I also added 1 bag of Ghiradelli semi-sweet chips AND 1 bag of the Nestle Swirled chips (chocolate and caramel). They are gone as soon as I make them!!

These were great! We all loved them. And they aren't even dificult to make(even thought since I didn't have any chocolate chips I had to cut a chocolate bar to pieces myself).

I didn't have cocoa powder or vanilla extract, so I used both nesquick and ovomaltine(both chocolate mixes with vanilla aroma to add to milk) and it worked well.

5 stars recipe - Thanks for sharing ^^

I don't know what I did wrong but these cookies were way too flat and broke apart as soon as I took them off the pan. I used margerine instead of butter but otherwise I kept the recipe the same.

This recipe needs a lot of help.  It has too much butter, should have half white sugar/half brown sugar, needs more salt, and many less chocolate chips.

My husband and I have only been married a little over 9 months now.  We had a long distance relationship for a while, and I used to send him cookies.  He LOVED them, he said they were the best cookies he's ever had.  Well, since finally being together, and getting married, I hadn't baked any mind-blowing cookies for him.  Till I tried these ;-).  He LOVED these sooo much!  (How could I blame him! I think they're amazing too!)  We'll definitely keep this recipe close at hand!  They're absolutely delicious! :)

These cookies were really good.  I added a little less sugar, butter and flour than the recipe called for because I didn't have enough of them, and they still turned out great but I did notice other reviewers saying that they were chewy.  Mine had a more cake like texture, with crispy outside.  I prefer chewy so next time i guess I'll have to make sure that I have enough of everything but if you prefer crispier cookies, try adding less sugar, flour and butter. :) thanks for the recipe!

Very easy to make! A great recipe for chocolate lovers! It's true that they are better the 1st day, but there will hardly be any left after the 1st day anyway. I will be making these again!

I used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar. I also used semi-sweet chocolate chunks(cut up semi-sweet baking bars). They are so good! I made them a couple weeks before Christmas and had to put them in the freezer so we'd have some left for when Christmas got here!

These are good, soft and somewhat cakey.  The only change I made was instead of 2 cups of chocolate chips, I used 1 cup of semi-sweet chunks and 1 cup of white chocolate chunks. Overall, it is great.  I am still looking for a less cake-like cookie that is more on the chewy side.

My husband is the cookie maker in our family, and he made these for some friends of ours.  Everyone was complimenting me, so I had to look up the recipe.  These cookies are soft, and oh, so sinful.  I don't like many cookies, but this recipe is a winner.

Delicious recipe.  The chocolate flavor is greatly enhanced if you add more salt.  I've even tried sprinkling it on the top of the cookies, which seems to be the most effective method.

I'm very picky so 5 stars from me is big. This recipe worked for large medium and  small cookies. All were tasty. The cookies are very rich so I recommend eating them with milk or your favorite coffee.

Omg these are the best cookies I’ve ever made. I did use 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar just because that’s my personal preference but other than that I didn’t change anything else. This will now be my go to recipe for double chocolate chip cookies. Thanks for sharing

Great recipe. When reading the reviews I saw a lot of people who mentioned they were getting a "flat cookie" after baking. Chilling the dough only mildly helps as the "problem" is in the actual recipe as it doesn't specify the type of cocoa powder needed. It only calls for baking soda, so unless you are using natural cocoa powder as opposed to Dutch processed you'll get a flat cookie every time. My suggestion? Use the recipe as is but make sure to use natural cocoa powder OR use Dutch process and use half white sugar and half brown with a bit of baking powder (about 1tsp per cup of flour) AND the soda. Personally, I always use both soda and powder in my recipes for the extra "bump" when baking.

Good. Recipe, read the reviews and cut the sugar to 1 cup.  Only used 3/4 cup chocolate chips as dough was THICK  I rolled the dough actually (which freezes awesome as balls, then 8 min -pres down with fork, then 6 min more). Found the baking time too short- each ball I squashed with a fork, pb cookie style, and they baked great! 12 minutes at 350. 
My yield was 2 dozen for a 2" cookie (kid size)

These are very very very good cookies! They are quite sweet and I used semi sweet chocolate chips, but I'm sure dark chocolate would be more decadent and a bit more grown up. I used an ice cream scoop for half the batter and when baked, did not flatten that much. For the other half, I flattened the cookies, and they spread out more (which I perfer). I also added nutella in the middle for some and it turned out quite decadent and delicious!!! I will definitely be using this recipe in the future!

Tried these for the first time a few days ago and WOW...chocolate fix!   Friends and family said they taste more like brownie cookies...since it was more on the chewy side rather than hard and crumbly. I read some reviewers say their cookies dried out after a few days, but mine are just as soft and chewy as the day I made them. Maybe because I tend to ball my cookie dough a little bigger and make sure not to over bake them!! In fact, I'd rather take them out of the oven before they're completely cooked through!!  Storing them in an airtight container once fully cooled is the best bet.  Definitely a delicious choc choc chip cookie and plan to make again!

Amazing.  So nice and round too!  They taste so, so good.  I ended up substituting some brown sugar for the white sugar (I didn't do enough shopping beforehand), so I had 2 parts brown sugar to 1 part white sugar.  Fantastic!

I subbed a half cup brown sugar, and used half shortening half butter, but kept the rest according to recipe. Chilling the dough does help keep them from going flat. I got 3 and a half dozen out of a batch. The whole family loved them, Mom even called them decadent!

these are simple to make and delicious.  they taste like tiny brownies.  I was tempted to make them bigger, because we like big cookies, but they are so rich that the small size is perfect.  I was worried because the dough was very thick and dry but they turned out perfectly.  they don't spread much so you can put a lot on one pan.

I baked this a little longer than the recipe requested because my husband likes a crunchy cookie.  However, despite the added baking time, these still came out fudgy.  I added a little espresso powder to enhance the chocolate favor and added extra chocolate chips.  These were deliciously chocolate and perfect for us chocoholics.

The perfect impromptu comfort food- I had a very bad day so I didn't want to leave the house to pick up any fancy ingredients, but I needed a chocolate fix. I found these and whipped them up (sans walnuts) and oh WOW! These little drops of heaven melt in your mouth, perfect flavour for a chocolate fan. I strongly advise sifting the cocoa powder/flour mixture- it wasn't in the directions but I did it anyways and the dough came out beautifully smooth. I didn't make any other changes to the recipe, but when I make these again, I'm thinking chopped up hazelnuts or unsweetened coconut shavings might go really nicely in place of the walnuts... (You can't go wrong with chocolate and hazelnuts)

These are so easy and the ingredients are so basic, these cookies are a must-try for any chocoholic.

I reduced the original recipe by half and ended up with a dozen large cookies - perfect! I also used 3/4cup of raw sugar (not superfine) and 1/4 cup brown sugar. The sweetness is right in the middle, just enough and not too sweet. They also stayed soft the next day! Definitely adding this to the book!

My 4 year old charge and i made these one day. He said he could eat them all day long! Coming from a 4 year old that's quite a compliment! We didn't use two sticks of butter though. I'd say more like 1.

I usually don't review on things.. But this was to great not to!! I did what many other reviewers suggested and used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of light brown sugar and also used half butter and half shortening. They turned out AMAZING- thick, soft, and chewy! Like a mini brownie! I used half semi-sweet chocolate chunks and half semi-sweet chocolate chips as well just to give it a more chocolate feel. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

I was very skeptical about making these cookies based on the consistent complaints about the cookies not staying moist. I still made the cookies and followed the recipe. I added salt by just adding a pinch and mixing it in, tasted the batter to see if it needed more and just went by that(just made sure it didn't taste too much of salt).
     The cookies came out super tasty and moist, the cookies weren't as moist on day three but most cookies won't. However, if you're looking for a tasty chocolate chocolate chip cookie recipe then give this a try! I am going to probably make another batch today.haha

WOW.
I love baking and chocolate chip cookies have always been my go-to. This is definitely my new go to cookie recipe!! 
So chocolatey and delicious, they are by far the biggest temptation to me out of all the things i bake. Soft, rich, and not super fluffy but not flat, just right!
The only thing i did differently was just to refrigerate the dough for an hour as another reviewer suggested. Wouldn't make a single change to the recipe otherwise, they're PERFECT.
For further info, i didn't put in walnuts, didn't change the amount of sugar, and used the full cup of butter softened but not melted. I baked them for about 8 1/2 minutes so they would still be soft, and it turned out great that way. The perfect soft dark-chocolatey cookie.
This is a winner!

This was a great recipe and it tasted great! one of the problems that I had was the fact that it was too dry, but I solved the problem by adding a little bit of milk and the problem was solved.

These cookies are absolutely heaven. The only change I made was 1 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown. Even my daughter loves them and she's not a cookie person! I do put a piece of bread in with the cookies in an airtight container and they stayed soft and delicious until they were gone. Making them again tonight......thanks for a wonderful recipe!

this so hit the spot! i had been craving something sweet since yesterday and luckily found this.. i scaled the recipe down to 12 servings, worrying if i made the full yield i'd eat the entire thing in one sitting [i think i've eaten 4 or 5 so far!].. i used a full egg instead of "half" and used half white sugar and half brown sugar.. this came out light and fluffy rather than dense and chewy or crispy.. i'm sure bf [who isn't much into sweets either] will enjoy these when he gets home [if there's any left ;) ].. ty for the recipe

I take this recipe, and double it.

Half gets Hershey's Special Dark powder, and the other half gets milk chocolate powder.

Into a container goes 2 chopped up bars of baking chocolate (I use 1 bar Baker's semi-sweet and 1 bar Baker's German), and up to 5 full 12 oz bags of chips. I mix my brands, as each brand adds a different flavor. Ghiradelli white vanilla chips give a nice counter note as well. Shake them up REALLY well. You should end up with 8 cups of chips.

Put half into each batch of dough. You'll want to mix in this many chips by hand, as most mixers can NOT handle something this dense, even when using dough hooks. Use a spatula you don't mind breaking if you don't want to hand mix. I have learned these lessons the hard way. :P

Spoon onto cookie sheets (I let them sit covered in the fridge for a day or so, but that's me), sprinkling each cookie with a pinch of cinnamon. Depending on the number of chips, you may have to bake a couple half-dozen test batches first. I start with 8 minutes, then work my way up to no more than 15. These cookies will go from done to burnt VERY quickly!

These end up being incredibly rich, incredibly chocolaty cookies that melt in your mouth. They've been described as more chip than cookie. Thank you, Kathy, for an excellent base recipe!

Perfect recipe! Dough will be stiff when all flour and cocoa are added - need lots of muscle to finish the mix. Refrigerate for an hour. Used a 2" cookie dough ball scoop - made perfect size for a holiday party.

I didn't use any walnuts, and used 1 1/4 cups of dark chocolate chips and 1 1/4 white chocolate chips. I also did heaping two-tablespoons and increased the time to 13 minutes. I would also suggest the use of parchment paper, as they tend to fall apart when they have so many chips and are so large! The parchment allowed me to slide them off to cool completely (whilst on the parchment paper) on a wire rack. I sent them to work with the husband and his office gobbled them up!

This recipe was great! I subtracted half a cup of sugar so it wouldn't be too sweet and the cookies still tasted perfect. The cookies were a bit cakey and thick, even though I didn't refrigerate the dough.

I thought the recipe was OK. Other reviewers suggested it was the perfect fix for a chocolate craving, but didn't do it for me. It was a nice idea, but the only difference between this and my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe is pretty much just the addition of cocoa powder. I thought it was a little overpowering in the cocoa department and had the powdery aftertaste. Wouldn't suggest for use as a chocolate craving fix.

Made 56 small-ish cookies.  Followed the changes suggested by user TIAAKE and other reviewers.  They look really nice, but mine ended up being soft and not chewy at all.  Not too sweet, which is nice.

Fantastic recipe! I did what others suggested and used 1/2 shortening 1/2 real butter (no margarine in this house!) and 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. So soft and chewy.  Next time I will use different flavored chips, maybe mint chips for the holidays.  Thank you for the recipe.

Excellent recipe. Added an extra 1/2-cup of chocolate chips. Made sure to beat the butter and sugar for about 4 minutes with a hand mixer so it was extra light and fluffy. Chilled the dough overnight for ease in scooping. Will definitely make again.

We don't often make cookies at all. Or any kind of sweet. But I really wanted cookies... these turned out amazing. Mykids were able to help make them, which is always good. The dough was a little wet looking so we added about another quarter cup flour and a bit more cocao powder. Used Andes mint pieces instead of chocolate chips. They are chewy, soft, and full of flavor. Thanks for the great recipe!

We felt like eating choc choc chip cookies tonight and found this recipe with so many great reviews.  Excellent recipe.  Very rich chocolate flavor and chips add to the whole chocolate experience.  I try to cut down on sugar so I used about 3/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I usually make my choc chip cookies with more chips than batter but in this case, I reduced the chips to 1 1/2 cups.  Cookies turned out perfect for us.  Melt in your mouth drops of chocolate.  Next time,I might reduce sugar a little bit more though the salt might have to be nixed as well to balance.  The chocolate flavor is more accented then and the chips really pop.  Definitely a cookie recipe to keep.  Thanks.

If you put baking powder in like I did and use half brown sugar with half white sugar, it makes for the PERFECT texture. Also, I found no need for chilling the dough before baking. The end product was fabulous.

I make these cookies all the time my family loves them. We love walnuts so I use a full cup of largely chopped walnuts instead of a half a cup. I use organic & all natural ingredients like Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips & Valrhona cocoa powder. I follow this recipe exactly & the cookie dough has the thickest consistency I've ever seen. The cookies don't spread out too flat they stay a bit puffed up beautifully. When we want to change it up a bit I add 1/2 cup to a whole cup of dried cherries...mmmm so good. Love this recipe it will always be a staple in our house. Thanks for the great cookies.

Nothing special . Had no cocoa powder , maybe that's why it was tasteless. Won't make them again.

These cookies are a chocolate lovers dream come true! I wish I could give this 10 stars instead of just 5. They are so moist, creamy, and have a great texture to them. Followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out excellent. I'll have to watch out on how many I eat, because they're very addicting :) Will definitely be making this again.

Omg! I made these cookies last night and they were awesome!!!! They were moist and very, very chocolaty. I followed the recipe exactly and the results were amazing. I highly recommend this recipe to chocolate lovers. I made 24 cookies and I only ate 2. The next morning I found 13 left!!!! My family attacked them! That's just how good they were. I saw some people put the cookie dough in the fridge to chill for a few hours to prevent the cookies from flattening out. Since I really wanted this

I made the recipe exactly as written and we couldn't get enough of them. They lasted about 5 days and were still soft by the 5th day in a sealed container.  These were so chocolaty and good, whole family loved them.

YES! This is the BEST chocolatey chip cookie recipe that I have made! I did what other reviewers suggested and used half butter and half butter flavored shortening. The cookies puffed up a little bit AND stayed moist and chewy for the next day! 

I used dutch-processed cocoa and I really think that the higher quality cocoa made all the difference in this cookie. I also used REAL PURE vanilla. Yummy, yummy, yummy!!! 

I immediately wrote this recipe in my personal recipe book and will use this for YEARS to come!

Thanks for this amazing recipe!

And thanks to Allrecipes.com for emailing me this recipe this week! What a wonderful way to try new recipes without doing a bunch of work to get there! :)

Just made these and ey turned out sooo good!  They are definitely for he chocoholic- very rich and gooey!  Eat with a glass of milk! I loved how many cookies the recipe made.  I would suggest doing VERY small balls, they will spread to just the right amount!  After I separated out my balls I then cut them in half!  Also, I refrigerated after they were in balls for 15 mins or so.  Very glad I did.  Delicious recipe!  Definitely a keeper thank you so much!!

This is our favorite cookie! I like to add extra vanilla, and I use Ghirardelli chocolate chips with 60% cocoa content. Yum! Sometimes, we bake them for only 5-6 minutes on 375 so that they're a bit crisp on the outside but gooey on the inside.

It's perfect, my whole family absolutely enjoys them, they don't last more than 15 minutes at my house, and the word "leftovers" doesn't exist with this recipe. The one time that there WERE leftovers (5 cookies total, but only because I doubled the recipe), they stayed moist and tasted just as good the day after, but of course they always taste better having just come out of the oven ;)

To address some of the concerns noted below: I used to get flat cookies whether I used butter, margarine, or shortening. That changed when I started using a cookie scoop. Maybe it's because the heat from my hands doesn't transfer to the dough, or the cookie dough is nice and rounded so it spreads less. 

With this batch, I used butter. I didn't chill the dough for the first half, I put the second half in the freezer for 10 minutes, and I used both light and dark cookie sheets and they all came out the same -- Perfect! I didn't change a thing from the recipe, and I did take them out just when set (as the recipe says). Although I thought they would be underdone, they were wonderful after cooling on the sheet for 2-3 minutes then being transferred to a wire rack to cool some more. I got lots of compliments.

This recipe is perfect a written. Baked these for my family and they were  hit! I chilled them for half an hour and they didn't flatten out (which is great). They stayed well formed. No changes needed to the recipe.

I'm giving it four stars because when I made them as directed they came out very cakey and I didn't like them. However, when I used half brown sugar and half white and baked them at 375 for 10 minutes they came out like extra chocolatey chocolate chip cookies.

Used only 1 cup of sugar (1/2 cup white, 1/2 brown) they are plenty sweet. As written, I feel like they would be too sweet. I used a bag of dark choco and mint chips. Also added a bit of peppermint extract. Used a bit less flour. They turned out really well!

I mixed it up a little to try and save some calories. I used 1 c. butter and 1/2 c. applesauce, used spelenda instead of sugar and 1 c. whole wheat flour with 1 c. unbleached flour. Cacao nibs instead of chocolate chips and I can call these healthy :) I baked two batches for 7 mins for "mushy gushy" middles and 9 mins for cake like middles. Both were a hit in our house. And I can have two since they're sort of healthy!

My family and I really liked this recipe. Everything went perfect! I had some unwanted peppermint extract left over from a past recipe, and wanted to use it up, so I replaced the 2 tsp. Vanilla with 2 tsp. Peppermint, and made some delicious mint chocolate cookies. Definate will make again.

These are super yummy. I added an extra ingredient to mine though. Peanut butter!  I didn't have any walnuts so I just added the chocolate chips. Next time I'm going to add some strawberries.  There are just so many possibilities with these cookies.

I wanted to share a modification to this recipe that turned out heavenly.  I used 2 cups chocolate covered raisins from Bristol Farms instead of chocolate chips.  And no nuts.  It's what I had on hand.  Wow!  I loved the cookies and didn't want to share (but I did).  Moist, chocolate rich cookies.  I looked, and the ingredients on the chocolate covered raisins included chocolate liquor and chocolate butter.  I will definitely make these again!

With well over 2K reviews already, it isn't quite necessary for me to add my 2 cents, but I love these cookies SO much, it'd be wrong not show my support. Ok, so if you're looking for, not only an extraordinary Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe, but a recipe for just a "really, REALLY AMAZING cookie", this is it! I've made these twice now, and both times the only change I made was cutting the recipe in half, as I only needed a small amount of cookies each time. With some recipes, halving results in failure, but not this one. You can successfully make a 1/2 batch, and I'm sure it would double just as easily. Moving on, this is a super flexible recipe - use any type of chip you want: semi-sweet, milk or white chocolate, peanut butter, butterscotch, mint, cinnamon, etc. Also, if nuts are your thing, these would be SO good with walnuts or pecans - with the chips, or by themselves. Dried berries - cranberries, cherries, blueberries, etc. - would also be yummo and my next batch will be white chocolate chip with dried cranberries & walnuts. Additionally, the consistency of this dough is a dream to work with. It's pretty stiff, so it scoops nicely, although I DO suggest flattening the dough a bit prior to baking and again once they are done, as they do not spread much. Finally, I use my 2 tsp. scoop and both times I have made these, I have found that the 1/2 batch yields 18 thumbprint-sized cookies. Overall, these really are the perfect cookies... Easy, consistent & DELISH!

These cookies are officially my new vice...my daughter dubbed them "a bite of heaven in your mouth!!".  Only change I made was subbing chocolate extract for the vanilla & I left out the nuts (which were optional). Baked at 350 for 8 minutes, making 68 cookies out of this batch (we prefer small cookies for nibbling).  I had to flatten mine slightly after pulling them out of the oven, as the cookies baked fairly high (I think it 's because I live at sea level & cookies generally cook so quickly they don't spread very much in my oven). BEWARE... These are highly addicting even if you don't generally have a sweet tooth. Thanks Kathy for this wonderful recipe...It is definitely going in the recipe book I am building for my kids. :-)

I had a note from family to not forget to write this recipe down and file with my best recipes. Circumstances resulted in a few changes that I believe made this recipe even better. I used two sizes of chocolate chips - the mini and regular - because it was what I had on hand. I also had to put the cookie dough in the fridge (about three hours)because I cleaned my oven which took longer than I anticipated. I used half Penzey's Cocoa and half Hershey's Dark (again that is what I had.) I used margarine instead of butter to accommodate a food allergy. I always, always swap the baking sheet locations half way through cooking time when using two sheets. Because the dough was chilled, I did not chill again after shaping, but I would do this just like the video to keep the nice puffy shape. There is a crunch on the outside and soft cookie inside - like a chocolate soufflé. The chocolate really pops.

The cookies turned out really nicely. I have to say I'm fairly new to baking but this was easy to follow understand and made a good 36 fair sized cookies.
Thank you for the recipe.

My daughter asked if we could make chocolate chip cookies but all I had were peanut butter chips.  So I went looking for a chocolate cookie recipe that I had the ingredients for and found this one. After reading some of the comments I made these changes.  1 cup light brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. Then the dough wasn't thick enough so I added 1/3 cup more flour, and that did the trick. I left out the nuts and like I mentioned I only had peanut butter chips.  Then I chilled it in the refrigerator for about half an hour, and baked them for 8 - 10 min.  Let me tell ya...  these are sooo good.  I gave it 5 stars even though I changed it up a little.

Very yummy! I made a few alterations since I really felt like adding 1/4tsp cayenne and an ounce of kahlua, which I'm pretty sure was a WONDERFUL idea, as it turns out.  I also subbed brown sugar and whole wheat flour and almonds for walnuts and used dark ch. chips. The only thing I would do next time is reduce the amount of ch. chips since some cookies kind of fell apart out of the oven because of it...

My husband was craving choc. chip cookies and decided to have our son make them.  He used light butter, and they turned out as flat as can be, and stuck to to the pan.  We added more flour.  We had a better texture.  I suggest to anyone making this recipe, first make ONE cookie.  If it turns out flat, then add flour.  I think the light butter and margarines in general need more flour added to the recipes.  If your looking for chocolate, then use Brookes Brownie, they are EXCELLENT, and we've never had any problems.  They have the crunch and the moisture.  We make them at least once a month, they are so good.  In addition, we even tried them with white choc. chips, which gave them a different flavor.  We won't be making these cookies again.

Flawless.  Used half butter, half shortening as well as half brown sugar, half regular sugar.  They're like brownie cookies.

SOFTEN your butter, don't melt it, and your cookies will be perfect. I used all butter, no margarine like some reviewers said. Melted butter does not make good cookies. Even half melted will mess up your dough. This is why some reviewers said it works better if it's put in the fridge... they melted it too much. If you don't take your butter out in time to soften just put a stick in the microwave for 2-3 seconds per side and it's perfect. I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. Be sure to press the brown sugar FIRMLY when measuring. Dough was very thick and I used a small scoop and then pushed down slightly so it wasn't just a ball. They don't expand much nor do they flatten like a pancake. Once again, that's a too soft/melted butter issue. WONDERFUL COOKIES. I used Ghiradelli (sp) cocoa powder. You want to make sure to use a good quality cocoa powder; it really makes a difference. Remember, take your BUTTER out of the fridge ahead of time and your baking will be perfect. Thanks for the wonderful recipe :-)

Very nice! So chocolate-y and good! Made small cookies and they were done in 8 minutes exactly, and the cookies were a little crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Ten minutes and they were slightly burnt. I think I will try again at a slightly lower temperature and longer time.

I had some Andes Creme de Menthe Baking Chips that I needed to use so gave this recipe a try, a little on the rich side but delicious.  I used 3/4 cup each white and brown sugar, 1 t of vanilla, 3/4 cup of chopped pecans and of course the baking chips in place of chocolate chips.  The first batch I baked for 10 min, this was not enough so I baked the remaining batches for 12 minutes, perfect.  I got a total of 73 cookies, using a cookie scoop (the one that is like an ice cream scoop).

Delicious! I made it with the chopped walnuts, and they were so good! I may play around with the butter content next time. I think I may try the half margerine/shortening next time. But, very pleased :-)

I have used this website for years without signing up for an account. Yet, I made an account today because these were maybe the best cookies I have EVER made (and I bake about once a week.) So soft, so chewy, so perfect. 

The changes I made: used half brown, half white sugar, and instead of chocolate chips I used about half a bag of Heath toffee bits. Since I wanted it to have more of a toffee cookie flavor, I doubled the salt (which I tend to do in cookie recipes anyway since I love a salty/sweet flavor.)

These are awesome!  I didn't have any walnuts, but I did have some pistachios so I added them.  I think they melted into the cookies!  I was concerned about how to tell when they were done since they don't really brown (too dark already!) I baked in a convection oven 3 batches at a time for 8 mins at 325, had one pan left so baked that an additional 2 minutes, can't tell which is which!  The creaminess of the chocolate chips covers up any mistakes, and it's all chocolate, so it's all good!  Definately a keeper!

These are great cookies. I made these cookies before and I added in some white chocolate because I wanted to use up some leftovers. It was awesome. This last time I used a bag of Andes baking chips. Let me tell you these were the best cookies I have had in a long time. :)

Making these now and the first batch is delecious! Baked for exactly 8 mins at 350. Uses half cup butter/half cup butter-flavored Crisco. Used 3/4 C white sugar and 3/4 C lightly packed brown sugar. Used a 10 oz pkg of Andes mint baking pieces and about a cup of semisweet chocolate chips. Will be making these again for Christmas! Thanks!

Awesome recipie, I added dark chocolate and mint chips and it came out amazing, also i found adding a 1/4 cup of milk caused the cookies to spread more and not be so clumped.

Very easy to make.  Husband loved them.  A teaspoon makes a very small cookie but lots of them.  Don't overbake or they will be too crunchy but still good

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING COOKIES! i've made these so many times and they're always wonderful.  i make them with 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and 1 cup of peanut butter chips.  i also make them larger than the recipe says- i end up with about 24 cookies.  i just bake them for 12 minutes or so and they turn out great.  they stay soft for several days but do eventually get a little harder.  when that happens, i just throw them in the microwave for 20-30 seconds and they taste almost like they're freshly baked.

This was a really good recipe and we'll contineu to use it.  Instead of all butter, I use half butter, half shortening. For a oreo-like taste, use hershey's special dark cocoa and white chocolate chips. I use a cookie scoop to form the cookies and in my oven, these baked for 9 minutes and produced a cookie that flattened more as it cooled and was crisp on the outside and chewy inside.

These are delicious!  I did as some other reviewers suggested, and replaced 1/2 C of the white sugar with brown sugar.  These cookies are really tasty.  They are crispy around the edges and soft and fudgy in the center.  I baked for 8 minutes, and they are perfect :)

These cookies are AMAZING!  I'm kinda loving the chocolate w/sea salt thing...so I did a batch with coarse sea salt sprinkled on top.  YUM YUM YUM!  My family devoured them.  These are truly good enough to give as gifts.

These were exactly what I was looking for! I used 1 cup white sugar and replaced 1/2 cup with packed brown sugar. I also subbed 1/4 cup of the butter for shortnening. Cooked for 10 minutes on the top rack of a 350 oven. The end result was a moist, fudgy cookie that was full of chocolate flavor. Perfect! Definetly a keeper of a recipe!!!

Heavenly taste!!! I had made them the period I was on breastfeeding. These delicious cookies were the best company when I was awake these long and dark nights. Thank you!

I had no issues with hardness (in fact, I found that they crumbled easily.) I did use whole white wheat flour. 
Delicious and packed with chocolate flavor!

Love this recipe! Like others I used 3/4c white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar. I live a chewy gooey cookie so I also added 1pckg chocolate pudding mix.

This is a great base recipe for an amazing chocolatey cookie

Yummy! I substituted 1/2 the butter for butter-flavored Crisco. At Christmastime, Andes Creme de Menthe chips are available, so I made this recipe with 1 cup Andes and 1 cup white morsels. They were a hit!

These were very good, not great. I didn't include the walnuts and used half regular sugar and substituted with half brown sugar. My fiancee really liked them but I think there were too many chocolate chips.

These were soooo good. I have to confess something because this little mistake actually turned out delicious. I was just not with it the first time I baked these, I guess.. I put baking powder instead of baking soda. They ended up turning out like a homemade version of those brownie bites. Yummy!

I never do the full amount of butter in a cookie recipe (I did a half cup instead of a full cup) and they always turn out tasting delicious.  In this recipe I substituted the white sugar for brown sugar to keep them moist, and substituted 1tsp soda to help with the rise (brown sugar and extra chips!) This time I added creme de mint baking chips for the Christmas holiday.  They turned out great!

Amazing cookies! I followed the recipe exactly (added chopped pecans instead of walnuts) and they turned out perfect.  Made 3 dozen as I made big cookies and only baked for about 7 minutes which made them soft and chewy.  Family loved them, will make again.

I have made these cookies twice, and both times the cookies were completely flat and seemed to be missing something. I tried refrigeration of the dough, which also didn't work. Finally I began adding extra flour in small increments and eventually they turned out looking closer to the picture. Can't seem to figure out what I did wrong. Twice!

Delicious! I made mine exactly as it is written except for I used white chocolate chips and left out the nuts. It only made 3 dozen for me. I used a medium cookie scooper. I didn't refrigerate the dough and my cookies are nice and thick! I cooked mine for 9 minutes and they still weren't completely done in the center but the guys at my house LOVE cookies a bit undercooked. I will keep this recipe in my cookbook! Definitely a great recipe!

I'm not known for my baking, but I followed this recipe exactly, with the exception of substituting 1 cup of flour with whole wheat flour, and 1 cup of chocolate chips with butterscotch chips, and the result is fantastic!  Just made them, and when others taste them, maybe I WILL be known for my baking!

One word: "YUM!" 

I followed the recipe exactly as shown, and they tasted delicious. 

One thing that really amazed me is how long it could stay moist! The cookies were soft for about a good 4-5 days after baking. 
I just love the size of these cookies too!--It's just the right size to eat. Not too small that you'll have to share it with another person, and not too small either. BITE SIZE!
Some suggestions: I added some extra walnuts in and it turned out great. I really love the nut taste. The cookie may have turned out too chocolate-ey. I dont how to avoid the overly chocolate taste...perhaps less cocoa powder or less chocolate chips? Anyways, the chocolate was a LITTLE overwhelming, but can probably be fixed. 

Overall, I would give it five stars. Easy to make and fun to eat!

WOW!  This is the first review Iim writing, and I have used lots of online recipes.. this one is fantastic!  I used salted butter and omitted the salt, and did the half white, half brown sugar deal (just used to doing it that way, and we know everything is better with butter!).  Wow!  rich, melty, chewy, good!

These chocolate cookies are awesome! I have been looking for a long time for a chocolate cookie that doesn't get completely flat and spread a whole lot when baked, and I finally found it! Great chocolate flavor, but isn't too sweet. I will be trying this cookie in numerous ways, with peanut butter chips, white chocolate chips, etc. Great recipe, Kathy, thanks for sharing!

These are awesome cookies. I added a box of chocolate pudding mix for extra chewyness (but it made the batter very dry) and used dried cherries instead of nuts. OM NOM NOM!!

Very rich and chocolatey! I used mini-chocolate chips and will try regular ones next time. This is going to be my go-to chocolate cookie base. I plan to try adding all sorts of goodies into it (dried fruit, different nuts, marshmallows, peanut butter something, etc.)

Super yummy cookies, made per directions first time and had to make them again as soon as they were gone.  Second time left out chocolate chips, added 2 cups of oats and only one cup of flour.  Super great that way too.  Will make these many times I am sure.

I used agave instead of sugar and two table spoons of coconut oil (to reduce the bitterness of the agave).  I also added 2/3 cup more flour, but this made them more like small cakes. (I'd probably only do 1/3 cup extra flour next time)  They tasted great and were sugar free this way.

Got more compliments on these than any cookies I've ever made for a potluck!  I made these in advance, rolled the whole batch into balls and put them in the freezer; then the morning of, I thawed for a few min, flattened, and baked them -- but increased it to 400 for about 12 min.

I didn't have any butter so I used half margarine and half golden shortening, sort of following along with other reviewers.  Plus I used half white and half brown sugar because I once read that the brown sugar makes for a chewier cookie.  As I was adding the sugar I was worried that they me be ultra sweet but they are quite chocolatey and not as sweet as you would think.  I wonder what would happen if I reduced the sugar in an attempt to get an even more rich chocolate flavor?  Any suggestions?

These cookies are delicious. I switched mine up by using 1 cup milk chocolate chips and 1 cup white chocolate chips. The walnuts make these cookies out of this world!
I did have to adjust the cooking time though. My oven usually runs hot, but 8-10 mins didn't cut it. I had to bake them for closer to 15 mins. Also could be because I used a small cookie scoop and they were thick to start with so took a little longer to cook.

These cookies are so good!!!  VERY chocolaty.  I only used 1 cup of chocolate chips as I read that 2 was too much for a lot of people.... And trust me it is enough. I made 24 big cookies as I didnt realize it was for 48.  I   also followed a few reviewers when they said to chill the dough.   I threw the cookie pan with the dough on it in the freezer for 10 minutes.   The cookies were not flat at all.   I cant wait to make these again with other things thrown in. :)   Enjoy!

Good.  Not as fudgey as I like, but good.  Don't over bake!  8 minutes is enough or you will get a drier cookie.

These are the best! I took two batches of these cookies to school for an end of the year treat on only recieved outstanding feedback. Several people helped themselves to 5 or 9 cookies each (and one of them was diabetic)! No alterations needed for this recipe.

This recipe is on the back of the Hershey's white chocolate chip bag. My husband said that they were probably the best cookies he's ever eaten. Very moist and soft and delicious.

Yum yum yum! I made no changes to the recipe and they are delicious! Had to cook a bit longer due to high humidity. After they cooled I made cookie sandwiches by spreading a layer of Jet Puff marshmallow in between two cookies. So good!

Followed this recipe as is, and the cookies turned out SO good!! If you're a chocolate lover, then you'll love these cookies. I ate two after they had cooled down, and I wanted to eat more, but had the willpower to stop. I halved the recipe, but it still ended up making more than 3 dozen. I guess if you use tablespoonfuls rather than teaspoonfuls than it might've been closer to being two dozen. I also ended up baking them for the full ten minutes. I was afraid they might've been overcooked, but they were still nice and chewy! I didn't add the walnuts, and I used Hershey's special dark chocolate chip cookies. Oh yeah - make sure you have a glass of milk nearby!

These were delicious! I just made them and made a few changes but they were excellent! I used 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and used wheat flour instead of all purpose and they are a little crispy on the outside and filled with melted chocolatey goodness on the inside. Definitely recommend!

Oh my goodness, my taste buds just went crazy! These cookies are a buttery, chocolately HEAVEN! Rich and decadent, the amount of butter is a necessary step in my opinion. They are not too sweet, but due to how heavy they are I definitely recommend making small size cookies so as not to overeat and make yourself feel much too full. Definitely one of my favorite cookie recipes EVER!
EDIT:
To make them less bitter, more sweet, and much more rich (perfect for those chocolate loving sweet tooths!) I would use 1 cup white sugar with 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and also I would use 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips with 1 cup milk chocolate chips.

Best cookies I've ever had, period.  And not just cause I made them lol  I was seriously surprised at the amazing outcome of these cookies, mostly because I am not the best or most knowledgeable cook on earth, but these turned out AMAZING.  Make them.  Now.

Hard to stir in  the chocolate chips, I used my hands ; ) but worth the effort. We used a mixture of milk and semisweet chips.

These cookies turned out great! Although we forgot the butter until the very end - and because of this thought the consistency was too dry so added an egg, things got messy - just adhere to the recipe and all will be good.

a big thanks to momma for finding this for us!!!

These cookies, once I had gone out and replenished my ingredients, were SO easy to make! I don't bake very often, and I usually have help, but I made these from scratch with no help whatsoever and they were DELICIOUS!

Since I'm allergic to milk, I used milk-free butter and semi-sweet dark chocolate Ghiradelli chocolate chips and everyone I shared them with said they were scrumptious. Even two days later they were still gooey and chocolately.

Also, from my experience this recipe and ingredients list made about 60 cookies, not just 48--and I used larger dollops. Enjoy!

These cookies are awesome! I've made them several times. I sometimes do half white chocolate chips and half semi-sweet. I've also added M&Ms for a little color.

I needed a quick and easy recipe for cookies to take to work tomorrow.  Preferably a recipe that didn't call for fancy ingredients I didn't already have in my pantry.   I thought I'd try this one and WOW, they are delicious, and I got the approval from my 4 year old as well as husband (I hope they make it to work with me tomorrow...lol).  They taste like a cross between a brownie & a chocolate chip cookie.  They were very easy to make and I love that the recipe calls for butter because since switching to organic cooking I don't use crisco or other shortenings for anything.  I followed the recipe exactly (including the optional chopped walnuts) and they turned out wonderful.  I will definitely make these again.

They are great just the way they are.I think they taste better within 2 days of being baked. I chilled the dough overnight , rolled into balls and slightly flattened before baking and they were perfectly baked in 11 mins.

i actually spread this out in a greased pan(with a little help from some damp fingers but butter probably would have worked as well) and baked it for about 20 mins and they are GOOOOOOOD! make sure to let them cool completely before trying to cut and get out of the pan. i was impatient last night and wanted to try them and they completely fell apart but this morning they're perfect!

WONDERFUL very very chocolaty though, one will do your chocolate fix in!  I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar because I love what brown sugar does to cookies and I used a little more vanilla just to give it a serious flavor.. Love them! I will be making them again and again

I just made these cookies for the first time today and they were so yummy. I stuck to the recipe but instead of the semisweet chocolate chips I used dark chocolate chips and added heath toffee bar bits. They gave the cookies a bit of a crunch, I will continue to make these cookies for years.

I made these cookies following the recipe, except I used Crisco butter flavored shortening. I used a cookie scoop and when I baked the cookies for 8 minutes, their shape didn't change at all and they looked a little undercooked. I left them in for a couple minutes longer and they came out good! The cookies were still round, but this helped the inside stay moist and cake-like. I kept the cookies in a tupperware for a few days and they didn't dry out! It was a little difficult for me to gage the cook time because at first I couldn't tell if the cookies were "cooked" since they didn't change shape. Be careful not to overcook these or they might crumble! Overall, these cookies came out moist and they are good for those chocolate cravings!

I just tried this recipe with my children and it was just super yummy! My one son has some special dietary needs so I substituted the sugar with 3/4 cup sugar and 3/4 cup Splenda, and I also used 1 cup of all purpose flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour. This just makes it friendlier for his sugar. Even so, it was super tasty! We also used peppermint baking chips in place of the chocolate chips. Not only did they taste fantastic but they were really stunning too. Could have easily given them as Christmas presents!

These are a HUGE hit with the household!! Thanks for posting this. The last batch I made I used 2 cups of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 cup of macadamia nuts which I think made this recipe the best cookies I've ever eaten!   I also baked them exactly 8 minutes because they will set if you leave them on the sheet for a couple of mins before cooling and this way they don't dry out at all. Nice and moist days later (if they last in the house that long!).

Wonderful cookies, but I may make a few adjustments to the next batch. Something was a little off in terms of flavor, but it may have been the brand of cocoa powder we used. Very addicting all the same! Thanks for sharing!

Awesome cookies. I halved the recipe (I only had 1/2 cup butter) and I used 2/3 the amount of chocolate chips and then the remainder was peanut butter chips. They turned out great.

These are my favorite cookies EVER! I can rarely have anything ready by the time the oven preheats, but not in this case! They are easy to make and so quick! I bake them right on my pizza stone and they come out absolutely perfect. I use Baker's chocolate broken into bits because I never have chips in the cupboard. The chunks of ooey gooey chocolate are amazing. Yum! Thank you for the great recipe!

Great recipe!  After reading other reviews, I made a few changes.  Mine were not flat and were chewy in the middle with a little crisp on top and crunch from the added candy cane.  I used 1/2 cup butter Substituted 1 cup of the sugar for brown sugar  used a full teaspoon of baking soda Added peppermint abstract and 4 smashed candy canes. Added a cup and a half of choc chips.  Next time I'll use peanut butter instead of butter and still use choc chips:)

Delicious cookies! I used half butter half margarine as that was what I had on hand and the cookies as others have mentioned do flatten a lot so you do really need to chill the dough before dropping spoonfuls onto prepared tryas, to prevent forming one giant cookie!! I will try it next time with all butter to see whether that was what my problem was. Otherwise beautifully moist and chocolatey cookie one of my faves flavor wise.

An excellent recipe! They did dry out *slightly* by day 3, but really it was kind of a miracle that they lasted that long anyway! Believe it or not, I did not use white flour at all, and you would never have known it. I did 1 cup whole spelt flour, and 1 cup kamut flour (very fine grained, looks and acts like white flour, but it is a whole grain). For the sugar I did 3/4 white and 3/4 raw cane.  Next time I will substitute 1/3 of the butter with 1/3 cup of apple sauce. (That has worked for all of my other cookie recipes)

Easy & extra yummy!  These cookies are for the chocolate lover.  They turned out perfect; not flat, etc.  I did have to cook them a bit longer than what is suggested, but I made my cookies larger than what is described.  Great recipe!

These are delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and they taste great. Next time I might try other reviewer suggestions to use half shortening and half brown sugar to see if that improves texture or appearance. I followed reviewer suggestions and only baked 8 minutes to make sure they stayed soft.

My husband and I both enjoyed these - the flavor was good.  The only thing I would change next time is to take other reviewers' advice and use half butter/half shortening.  Even though I live at a low altitude, my cookies still came out flat - almost as flat as the cookies I made when I lived in Colorado, which is pretty darn flat.  I'd definitely try this recipe again, though!

I first made these for a family car trip to Colorado this past summer.  So delicious!  The perfect picnic cookie!  They stayed good in tupperware our entire week long trip--nice and soft.  I will be making these this Christmas for friends and family.

Yummy!! I had a bag of mint M&Ms that i wanted to use in a chocolate cookie, and they were so tasty in this recipe.  I followed the recipe except used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown as per some other reviews.  I did follow some other reviewers and under baked them slightly, so they turned out a delicious cake/brownie consistency. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Delicious! I added 1/2 cup ground flax seed in place of 1/2 cup of flour to add fibre. Does not change the taste and you can't even tell it's in there. Also, if you keep your chocolate chips in the freezer, after the cookies cool the chocolate chips are still a little runny....YUMMY!

I made these exactly as written. I used Guittard cocoa rouge. I'm not a huge cookie fan in general, but these were to die for! They're my new staple since they're ridiculously easy and a real crowd pleaser.

Oh wow! I made these for a bake sale at scool and they were literally THE FIRST thing to go. I had people buy a couple, then come back to get more. Then we ran out and still had people looking for them!  The only thing is that I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. YUMMY!

My family loved these cookies!  They were easy to make and were still soft and delicious the next day.  I used half shortening and half butter.  These were a lot like a recipe I have used in the past that used a brownie mix.  These were better!

Followed others directions and used 3/4 cup brown and 3/4 cup white sugars, 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup creamed shortening. Took them out of the oven just before they were done, so they remained a bit crispy on the outside and gooey chewy on the inside. Mine flattened out perfectly to the way we wanted them. Wouldn't say they were like brownies as some have said. I think mine really came out like chocolate chip cookies in chocolate batter. What a great combo! Oh, and dough was delicious, too!

Amazing!  Tried with mini M&Ms instead of chocolate chips the second time I made these, and they were equally as excellent, and had a little extra crunch.  Perfect for any chocolate lover!

These are very very good. The reason for the 4 star is because they are SO chocolate filled that you can't eat more than one without getting sick. But very good none the less. I found that using stoneware bakeware (with a sheet of parchment paper on) I had to bake them for 10 minutes and let them sit on the pan for 5 minutes. This seemed to be the perfect cook time.

I would give these a 3.5. We didn't find them especially great. The cocoa powder flavor was a little too strong. Maybe they'll be better tomorrow?? If so, I'll update!

Everyone loved these! I made a few changes based on past reviews. I used 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar, left out the walnuts, and baked them at 375 for 8 minutes.  They came out deliciously chewy and tasted like brownies!

I took these cookies with me to a dinner party and was told they were the best cookies they have ever had in Michigan, had some native new yorkers present.  This is an amazing base recipe, my advice in this recipe is to use high quality cocoa and high quality semi sweet chocolate chips..  It really makes a difference

Excellent cookies!  Took the advice of others and modified it just a tad.. I halved the recipe and did 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening and did 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4th cup of brown sugar. Also used egg substitute since my daughter has an egg allergy - used ENER-G egg substitute.  I'm pretty sure this is what caused the cookies to not "spread" and look like cookies.. they just remained as-is - so looked just like clumps of cooked dough, but nevertheless, they tasted heavenly!

WOW this is a great cookie. As with any recipe, I made some changes based on personal preference and on what I had in the cupboard.  I didn't have cocoa powder, so instead I replaced 1/2 cup sugar with a packet of chocolate pudding mix, and used 2 2/3 c flour to make up for the lack of cocoa.  Secondly, I always freeze my cookie dough before baking to give me thick, moist, chewy cookies.  With these two changes my cookies came about absolutely AMAZING, and they stay that way for longer. What a great recipe to use as a base.  My next experiment: pistachio chocolate chip cookies using pistachio pudding mix. yumm!!

These cookies are yummy!  I only made a half recipe.  I used applesauce instead of butter to cut down on the fat, and they turned out great!  Since the applesauce makes it a little sweeter, I only used 1/2 c sugar.  I also added baking powder in addition to the baking soda (1:1), and only used 3/4 c of chocolate chips.

These cookies are amazing! Instead of semisweet chocolate chip's I used white chocolate chips so they were more domino cookies and I also omitted the nuts. I found it worked really well to make really large cookies and to cook them for 12 minutes

If your not afraid of fat or calories (and why would ya be?), fold in 1 cup of peanut butter with your wet ingredients while keeping all the other ingredients the same. These cookies will melt in your mouth...adding that extra cup will yield 5 dozen.

With only 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of mini-chocolate chips (to better spread the chocolate goodness), these cookies are one of my favorites.  I freeze them and have one whenever a chocolate craving hits me.

I have used this recipe multiple times with various chocolate and nut mixtures and they always turn out fabulous. Very good basic cookie recipe. The dough freezes well which is great to have on stand by. I did change the the sugar to 3/4 a cup white sugar and 3/4 cup mixed light and dark brown sugar and they came out even better!

I just tried this today and my cookies came out very good. They were actually better after they cooled. I didn't follow the recipe exactly but substituted the coco powder for unsweetened strawberry coulis. A great base recipe that I'll use again!

Wow, these were super easy and better than I expected.  Kind of like a brownie style cookie, great flavor.  I ended up using mini dark chocolate chips and made them into ice-cream sandwiches.  A great treat in our 100+ degree weather!

I added maraschino cherries and cherry syrup to these. They are tasty but I may cut down on the cocoa powder next time as they are a bit TOO chocolaty.

These are awesome. I just made them gluten-free (with Jules GF Flour mix). I used 1/2 shortening (Spectrum palm oil kind- non-hydrogenated) and half butter, and also used 1 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar as recommended by another reviewer. They were so good out of the oven that even my non-GF family members raved about them. They are super chocolatey but fluffy at the same time. Will definitely make again!

Flavor was good, not outstanding. I gave this recipe 3 stars because of the dryness factor. I was thinking they would be more moist and chewy like a chocolate chip cookie.  Any ideas that can make this less dry? *********** UPDATE!******** Im changing from a 3 star to a 5! As I was nearing my last batch of dough to scoop and bake, I thought and thought what I could do to make these more moist. So I went to the one ingredient that I use in place of oil for cakes...unsweetened applesauce! I stirred in about 1/2 cup worth of unsweetened applesauce.  The dough then became very soft but not too soft that it didnt hold a round shape when I droped them onto the cookie sheet.  These came out AMAZING! Absolutly wonderful, still very chocolaty and delicious, but soft and chewy.  These altered cookies have more of a brownie like texture, so if thats not what you want for these, I wouldnt use the applesauce. Otherwise I HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMEND using ALL the ingredients listed, but also add about 1 1/4 C unsweetened applesauce. Trust me you wont be dissapointed!

These were delicious, but tasted more like cocoa powder cookies than chocolate cookies. They were very moist and chewy which I love, and all those chocolate chips were the saving grace for these cookies.

these cookies are really good. I made a half of batch for a gift. I used margerine (all i had) with no problem. I skip the nuts due to preference.  I did refrigerate the dough for easier handling.  I've never made chocolate cookies before and idk they're something impressive looking about these cookies. The baking time was right on. I think i'll use white chocolate chips next time to suit my tastes. Or even dipping one half  of the cookies in white chocolate.

Absolutely delicious as is--no modifications needed. The only thing that I always do when I use butter in a cookie recipe that isn't mentioned here is to refrigerate the dough for about an hour before dropping onto the cookie sheets. This seems to make them hold their form much better and not come out flat.

ETA: Just finished eating this batch, 5 days later and they are still nice and soft! Stored them in a rubbermaid container. Making another batch tomorrow!

These cookies are fantastic!  My cookies tend to go flat. So i used 1/2 cup REAL butter and 1/2 shortening. I also took the advice of another review and did half brown,and half white sugar. I won't be buying cookies anymore. :o)

Awesome! Made the following modifications: Used shortening, not butter. 1 C brown sugar, 1/2 C white. Added 3/4 t baking powder. Used 1+1/2 T real vanilla. These turned out perfect.  Heads up - they are a nice fluffly cookie, so if you prefer them to settle a bit, give them a gentle tap after you've rolled them into balls - push them to about 1/2-3/4" high.

This dough is VERY thick. My Kitchen Aid mixer handled it just fine though. The cookies are very good and worth the effort. They are very rich and chocolatey...Just the way we like them.

This recipe is one of my favorites! Simple to follow, I've made it dozens of times without the help of a handmixer and it still comes out great. I use a silicone baking mat which makes them come out even; the hardest part is pulling them out of the oven after only 8 or so minutes, as long as the edges are set and the middle looks done, the cookies stay chewy. Kudos to whoever added this recipe.

i was in the mood for chocolate and decided to give this recipe a try. i followed the advise of other reviewers and used 1c white sugar and 1/2c brown sugar and 1/2c shortening 1/2c butter. the cookies are amazing. just what i was looking for. i think they turned out a little too sweet with milk chocolate chips. thinking they might be amazing with mint chips too. great recipe.

These cookies are really really fabulous.  I am always on the lookout for the perfect recipe for each kind of cookie - sugar, peanut butter, chocolate chip, etc.  This recipe is definitely the PERFECT recipe for chocolate chocolate chip cookies.  I didn't have a lot of ingredients on hand, so I halved the recipe, and it came out great.  It is really really easy to make too.  I wanted to try the other readers recommendations of a white sugar/brown sugar combo, but I was out of brown sugar. I used all white, as the original recipe calls for, and I can't imagine it being improved upon with the substitution of some brown. One of my favorite things is the shape of these cookies.  They come out looking nicely mounded and chunky.  8 minutes in the oven = a perfect, soft, chewy cookie.  Amazingly.. I liked them even more the next day than right out of the oven, b/c they are so rich.  Straight out of the oven when the chips are all melty, is a lot of chocolate to handle!!!  Everyone that has tried these is super impressed.  Finally, the only difference I made is with the chips.  I didn't have a bag of semisweet chips on hand.  I did have, however, a bar of Ghirardelli semisweet and a bar of their 60% cacao bittersweet too.  So I chopped those up, and used them in place of standard semisweet chips.  I actually think I liked that better, since it made it more of a "chunk" cookie, rather than a "chip" cookie, and the chunk seemed better suited to this recipe.  5 stars all the way!!!!

Hit the spot.  Had hard day at work and came home craving chocolate!  I subbed semi-sweet for dark chocolate chips and subbed walnuts for macadamia nuts.  This is my new go-to chololate cookie recipe!

These cookies were delicious!  This recipe is a keeper.  I got 2 Silpat mats for Christmas and I've been dying to use them.  They worked wonderfully!  I changed a few things that made the cookies that much better: I too used half butter/half shortening and half brown/half white sugar like I saw in someone's review.  It made the cookies thick and very moist.  I used a heaping melon ball scooper and got 4 dozen cookies.  We added 1/2 cup of dried cranberries to half of the batter and the cranberries just put these cookies over the top for me!  My fiance prefers the ones without cranberries but he liked both and he usually won't eat cranberries.  8 minutes left the cookies a little too moist.  Just shy of 10 minutes seems to be right with my oven.  I added a teaspoon of butter flavoring to enhance the shortening and a teaspoon of chocolate flavoring since I was a little short on cocoa powder.  We will make these again soon!

Pour yourself a big glass of milk.  This cookie is yummy.  I even made some "healthier" changes including:dark choc. chips, smart balance butter, 1 cup wheat flour (and the other cup all purpose), and sugar in the raw.  My three children have devoured these cookies. They are superb.  Thanks.

These were very good, I did use 1/2 Brown Sugar. I added a special topping that made them even better though...about 2 minutes prior to being done baking.... I pulled them from the oven and squished 3 mini marshmallows onto them, popped them back in the oven to finish cooking. Once cooled I covered the tops with a chocolate cream cheese frosting...So good!

Incredible! Just the texture/flavor I was looking for but better. I halved the recipe, subbed 1/2 mashed banana for the egg since I was out, used 1/2 c. brown sugar + 1/4 c. white sugar, and left out the cocoa powder and walnuts. Yum yum :)

Made exactly as recipe states (without the walnuts), and they are super duper good.  Like a brownie, but in cookie form.

The first time I made these cookies they were amazing.  They had a brownie texture so chewy in the middle and a nice complimentary texture on the outside.  I have since tried to remake this cookie without success.  They still tast great but I couldnt recreate that chewiness that made me fall in love with them the first time.

These cookies have become my signature item! Everytime I get together with my friends, they ask my to bring "the cookies" I make them exactly as the recipe calls for but I prefer my cookies to be moist on the inside so i do not cook them as long!

Rich and moist! Puffed up nicely. I've always had a problem with flat cookies, but I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used 1/2 cup margarine and 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening, chilled the spoonfuls of dough on the pan for a few minutes before baking each batch, used foil and changed it each time.      Definitely bake only 8 minutes. Mine were moist, but I feel even 1 more minute and they would've started drying out.     I made the original recipe, minus the nuts and divided it: added 1/2 cup butterscotch chips to a quarter of the dough (tasty, but a bit too rich--next time I'll reduce the amount of chocolate chips when I mix the two); added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts to a half of the batter (still felt I could have added another 1/2 cup).

Wonderful!  Per previous reviews I used half/half shortening/butter and brown sugar/white sugar.  I also subbed 1 2/3 cups peanut butter chips then an additional 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  Delicious.  They came out thick and delicious.

I think these were so-so. I followed the recipe exactly except I used half sugar/half splenda, so I am not sure if that created a flat taste. I will try to make these again with full sugar and see.

For people concerned about flat cookies the solution is simple -- add more flour than the recipe calls for, form the cookie into a ball, and chill it sufficiently before baking. I guarantee your cookies will not be flat.

These were awesome. I used a baking margarine and a quality dark chocolate chip. This is enough chocolate for a true chocolate lover. They almost have a fudge brownie feel to them.

I just made these and they were just FANTASTIC! There are similar cookies at a bakery nearby that I wanted to copy and I thought it would take me forever to find a recipe that was close and yet I found them on my first try! I didn't change the recipe at all except for maybe adding slightly more chocolate chips to the batter and then I put a few more on top of each cookie before they went in the oven. My only criticism would be that it took a long time to beat the wet ingredients until the batter was smooth, and I found the dough very messy to work with but the result was well worth it!

I just made and ate one of these. They are probably the best cookies I've ever had, and I will definately be making these again! I followed the recipe almost to the letter, with the only change being that I substituted about a 1/4 cup of coconut inplace of that much chocolate chips. Adult & kid approved here! Thanks for the recipe!

Oh, these cookies are to die for! This makes a nicely sized batch, too, even if you go by rounded T's instead of t's. These all had to be given away as gifts (sadly), but of course I sneaked a few for myself! So very chocolatey and moist. Because I like less-sweet chocolate, I'd cut back on the sugar next time. Take them out of the oven after about 8min, 30sec. They won't look or feel done, but that is the key to a moist cookie. Let them cool almost completely on the baking sheets; that keeps them chewy. Thanks a lot! This is going in my recipe book!

I live in Switzerland where I have to chop up my own chocolate bars into chunks. My Swiss colleagues and friends love their chocolate and they can't get enough of this cookie! I sprinkled a little bit of candy cane on the top for Christmas and voile! Perfect holiday cookie and wonderful cookie overall.

Made these for the first time for a cookie exchange.  Very easy to make and delicious.  Sort of a brownie-like cookie.  Along with the chocolate chips and nuts, I added some white chocolate chips.  Delish!

These cookies were AMAZING!  My kiddos gobbled them up, and they were very easy to make.  Based on the other reviews I used half crisco, half butter, and half white half brown sugar.

This was good. I won't make them again, but I wouldn't say it was a waste. I think the chocolate flavor was less than acceptable, it just seemed a bit off.

I made some adjustments to the recipe. I halved the recipe since I only had 1/2 cup butter left, used 1 3/4 cups of whole wheat PASTRY flour, 1/2 black/brown sugar, 1/4 cane sugar, and 1/4 honey, used 60% cocoa chips (since I prefer dark>milk), and since I used pastry flour I also used 1/2 baking soda & powder. The outcome was very good, but I would use less black/brown sugar next time since it was a bit too sugary for my taste, and it has a distinct flavor to it. Overall 4/5, I would make this recipe again. :)

I added 1/3 cup extra cocoa and reduce the flour by 1/3 cup to make these even more rich.  I love that, because you can eat less and still get that chocolate fix.  Great with milk.  Simple the best cookie recipe I have ever found.  Baked for exactly 9 minutes.

These cookies are great!  The longer you let them sit in the fridge (within reason of course) the better they are!  I used 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups white and everybody loved them...I will get a pic of these when i make them this weekend....

I made these with PB chips, and everyone loved them....not my favorite, but that may be because I don't really like a chocolate cookie anyways.  They were easy to make and looked nice.

WOW!  This certainly hit the chocolate craving right on target!  I am a half brown sugar/half white sugar kind of girl, so I split it 3/4 each.  This produced a light cookie.  It doesn't seem like it will be light because it is DENSE, but when they come out of the oven...perfection!  Thanks for posting!

WOW!!!! These are AMAZING!!!! We are unable to eat dairy so I've not had choc chip cookies in a long time and these didn't disappoint! I made some modifications for our allergies and these were out of this world!!!!  I used spelt flour (1 3/4 c) and 1 c white 1/2 brown sugar as others had suggested.  I used all shortening, and used a bag of Enjoy Life chocolate chips.  I also had to bake mine for 10 minutes. THANK YOU for such an amazing recipe!!

OMG. Omitted nuts, and switched chocolate chips for peppermint chips. Replaced 1 tsp. of vanilla extract with pure peppermint extract. Subbed half white sugar with brown sugar. These were to DIE for. If you are having a chocolate fit, these will sooooo fix it. Yes, they should be a bit soft at the end, they cool and are perfect. I did 10 minutes and they were good. I did 11 minutes and they were even better - it gave the edges a chewiness that was awesome. Thanks for this recipe - will be a keeper forever. :)

My 8 year old son, and 4 year old daughter really liked these. My 4 year old who normally passes up any cookie, ate 2 of these! I did make a couple changes, I used half brown sugar, half white, half butter, half Crisco. I like the fact that this only makes 4 dozen, because I really don't like making cookies, so this was just enough.

These cookies were really good! The family loved them. I made them as bars, so I was able to use oil instead of butter. I also substituted 1/2 c. of the white sugar with brown, and used half white chocolate chips and half regular. Be careful not to overbake, these need to be soft.

Ahhh! These cookies were soft, chewy, and everything I could ask for. They disappeared in record time! There was the perfect balance of chocolate chips and cocoa flavor...I will make 'em again and again. And use mint flavored chips with this recipe too, it is astounding!

Delicious cookies with a texture similar to a brownie. I substituted the chocolate chips with white chocolate chips and added macadamia nuts. I also used half white and half brown sugar and butter flavored crisco. The texture and taste (not too sweet) were such a perfect combo that even my guy friends asked for more.

I used 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 baking powder, added 1 cup of oats instead of the nuts and baked 12 mins and it was good, crispy on the outside. Next time I'd try a tsp of instant coffee and use 1/2 brown sugar like others suggest.

I loved these so much I shared them with people all over my village, including the owners of the coffee bar. Great cookie recipe. I also used 1/2 c. white chocolate chips and 1 1/2 semi sweet chips.

I thought these were perfect! These are thick bakery style cookies which I prefer over the thin version. This is my new go to chocolate chip recipe! Thanks so much.

Exactly what you'd expect from a chocolate chocolate chip cookie - this recipe delivers! I made as written, subbing in some white chocolate chips or peanut butter chips to use up some of the ingredients i had in my pantry. I erred on the side of caution and underbaked slightly...chocolate cookies tend to dry out sooner, I think. All the coworkers enjoyed!

Fabulous! I also added 1 tsp instant coffee to bring out the chocolatey flavour. 4 days later, the cookies are almost all gone and still very soft and wonderful!

FANTASTIC!!!!  These were sooooooooooo good! I used 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar.  Instead of chocolate chunks or chips I added Peanut Butter chips... AMAZING! 4 people ate a full batch in one night, lol.  Also, they took closer to 14 minutes to cook... I think because I made them larger.

These were great! After a few minutes out of the oven they were rich and gooey, my brother loved them. I followed the recipe exact, except I didn't use nuts and I did half white and half brown sugar like everyone says. I put them in my convection bake oven for 6 min. Yummy!

these were so good. i went a little heavy on the salt and i think it made them even better. i upped the cocoa as everyone suggested. they came out great although i had to cook mine a solid 12 minutes. they were still chewy and everything.

Awesome cookies!! The only thing I did different was substitute 1 cup of brown sugar for 1 cup of the granulated sugar (I still used 1/2 cup of gran. sug). I make these for a group of college boys that come over every week and they continue to ask for more!

Delicious! I did half butter and half butter-flavored crisco, then substituted 1/2 cup light brown sugar for white sugar, and pecans instead of walnuts.  Cooked for exactly 10 minutes.  They looked just like the picture and tasted oh so chocolately!

AMAZING!!! I followed the recipe exactly as it is, and the cookies came out great! The dough was really sticky, but it didn't spread too much in the oven, to my happy surprise. (: I made a batch of these for my little sister's party, and they were gone within minutes, literally! I will definitely be making these little brownies again.

These are excellent and still soft and chewy a day later. I used 1/2 c butter and 1/2 c butter-flav shortning and didn't have enough cocoa so I put some nestle chocolate milk mix in. Absolutely delicious.

Made these in a 13x9 inch pan to save time. They came out like chewy brownie/cookies. Very good. They dry out quick so be sure to keep the pan covered. Will surely make again!

I made these almost exactly how the recipe states 3 times now. Every time they are excellent. The only changes that I make are the choc. chips - I either use white choc. chips, m&ms (they add color for holidays & are soo good after being cooked into the cookies). Everyone's favorite addition though were the Andes Mint Chips - soooooooo amazing - mint choc. cookies! Yummy, I highly suggest trying that if you like mint choc. anything! :o)

A-mazing.  I used one cup semi-sweet chocolate chips and one cup mint chocolate chips and they were wonderful (I didn't add any nuts).

Deep chocolate flavor!  WAY WAY WAY better tasting than the recipes that call for chocolate pudding. No nasty artificial flavors . We like these almost as much as homemade brownies and that's saying a lot!  :)

IT was a really good cookie. It stayed moist for days. These are the things I did to change the recipe. 1. I substituted 1 cup of white sugar for brown. 2. I used 1/2 cup of shortening and a 1/2 of softened butter. 3. I also did half semi-sweet and half white chocolate chunks. It was awesome. Although I think I should have sifted the dry ingredients because there was chunks of cocoa powder in the cookie.

Liked this recipe as I never have chocolate squares the other recipes call for.  Do not over bake, as it is hard to tell how they are doing with such a dark color.  The minute I saw cracking on the top I took them out for a chewy moist cookie.

The best chocolate cookie dough ever - only had pecans and milk choc chips but these cookies were awesome. Didn't change anything in the recipe. That picture above does not do them justice either - mine came out nearly black - yummy!!

This makes a lot of cookies.  I used 1/2 semi-sweet chunks and 1/2 white chips. If you want a brownie-like chocolate cookie, this is for you. I still prefer my standard doubletree chocolate chip cookie recipe - hands down.

Everyone LOVED these cookies.  The recipe made so many, that I took half in to work after they were 3 or 4 days stale and they begged for more!  These are chewy and wonderful.  Great for satisfying that chocolate craving.

I have been using this recipe for a few years now. A definite staple for me. You can change it up a bit by adding, a few white chocolate chips or macadamia nuts. They will impress anyone who like a good chocolate cookie. Thanks a million!

Oh my goodness, these are fantastic!  Best Choc-choc-chip cookies I've made by far.  I used the Hershey's dark cocoa and semi-sweet mini chocolate chips.  Not only are the cookies loaded with antioxidant-goodness, but they're fudgey and stick-to-the-roof-of-your mouth delicious.  I'm glad I made them small, because I can't stop eating them!  Definitely serve with a tall glass of cold milk.  OR with vanilla ice cream -- oh, yeaaah.  That's what I'm talking about!

I just made these and they were an absolute hit!  I didn't have cocoa available, so I used Ghiradelli's hot cocoa mix and it worked just fine.  Nice and gooey in the middle and ridiculously chocolatey!  Be sure to grab a glass of milk to accompany these delightful treats!

Awesome and easy recipe!  Thanks for sharing! The only ingredient I was missing was the cocoa.. so I improvised and used instant hot chocolate..  They came out light in colour, but still extremely moist and very tasty.  I used less chocolate chips than the recipe called for (about half) but it didn't compromise the chocolatey taste at all!

If you like a more cake-like cookie (which I don't but many others do) this is a great recipe.  They were a big hit at our bake sale at work (first cookies to be sold out).  I used white chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet because I like the contrast of flavor and texture.  This is also a very easy cookie dough to work with.

I made extra large cookies using an ice cream scoop and baked them for 16 minutes.  I got about 11 large cookies.  I'll have to make them again to acurately review them.  I used unsalted butter that I had in the freezer and they tasted as if perhaps the butter was freezer burned.  I will also use 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar next time to acheive a chewier texture.  These were almost cake-like.

Very good cookie!  I used 1 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar as many suggested.  I baked the cookies for exactly 10 minutes on an insulated cookie sheet.  I let them cool about 4-5 minutes before transferring to the cooling rack.  I must have a small teaspoon because I got 70 small cookies out of this recipe.  But I like the cookies small since I can never eat just one cookie.  Note - These cookies seemed like they were RAW when I took them out of the oven.  Don't keep cooking them, they really will firm up.  They cook a little longer on the sheet even after you take them out...  Yum yum!  Just tried them so I can't say how they will be in a few days. I doubt there will be any left!

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out lovely. I even added the walnuts and they looked great! The dough is really sticky when you make it so be sure to refrigerate it before you put it on the cookie sheet (if you're planning on cutting them into specific shapes)

This is the best cookie recipe and it's soooo easy!  I actually just put peanut butter chips in instead of nuts and I only cook them for about 7 to 8 minutes.  I've made these so many times and everybody loves them.

I halved the recipe but followed it exactly.  It has a fudgy texture, and tastes so good with nuts.  The cookie dough itself is not too sweet, but the chocolate chips counter that.  Next time I think I'll sub the white sugar with brown sugar.  I'll probably bake them longer too because they got too soft the next day.

I've been baking cookies from scratch for over 15 years, and these are THE BEST ONES I HAVE EVER MADE, HANDS DOWN!  Incredible right out of the oven.  I'm having people over tomorrow, and they will worship me forever once they bite into my new favorite cookies.  Big fat chewy chocolate chip cookie, you can bow down to these!!!! :-D

Sooo good!  Someone brought these to a get together and I had to make them because I wanted more (a hazard of being pregnant).  I think they're even better a day or two later.

Wow, did I get my chocolate fix or what after trying one of these. My friend and I made these and they were insanely addicting. We followed the recipe exactly and they were perfect. We did however take them out a bit early because they like their cookies chewier. I think I will try these with white chocolate chips next time, and then they will taste like the Panera cookies- but way cheaper!

This recipe makes fabulous cookies.  Although, I didn't use regular chocolate chips like it calls for, because I ran out.  I chopped up 2 squares of semi-sweet baking chocolate and used 1 cup of butterscotch chips.  With the 1 cup of chopped walnuts, these cookies were really awesome, better than any bakery.

This was absolutely the best cookie ever!  My kids and husband couldn't stop eating them.  They did stay very soft and cake-like.  They got the most comments on in all of the cookies I made for Christmas this year.  This is a definate keeper!

Wow, these cookies turned out great. I made these a few years ago, using Ghirardelli chips. This time, I used mint chocolate chips, as those were all I had. I also cut down the white sugar to 1 cup and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar, per other reviewers' suggestions. I used a fork to blend the eggs, sugars, etc., as I find that there are way fewer lumps. Bake for eight minutes, and you've got a yummy cookie!

OMG!!!This recipe is awesome!! I was shopping, seen in a cookie shop a chocolate cookie begging for me but I refused to pay the price for a cookie!! I found this recipe and it looks just like the cookie I seen and it taste as great as I knew that cookie in the mall would have. My 4 Boys love this and have requested it be made again and again(we are only on the first batch,just made them) Thanks so much for sharing this recipe it will be used in many years to come and for future grandchildren(hopefully I will have a few of those!!)Thanks again!!!!

Okay, so I am making the cookies and I followed a few or the reviewers advice to add half butter and half shortening....well, the cookies have been in the oven now for 13 minutes and are still raw inside.  I am not sure what I did wrong!

This is the first *chocolate* cookie i've ever made. It was fabulous. I was looking for a butterscotch cookie recipe and got bored with what i saw. I stumbled upon this. Used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar. 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flav.crisco. cooked exactly 8 min. They are beautiful, warm, gooey. Just sent some next door, they LOVE them. Thank you soo much for this.

Great Recipe!  I have made chocolate cookies for years and sometimes they held their shape and sometimes they were flat and it doesn't seem to matter if you use the tricks of chilling the dough or adding flour.  I used peanut butter chips and they were much more fun to bake when I did not have to worry about them holding their shape and they tasted great.  My son that requests the chocolate peanut butter chip cookies thought they were also the best ones I have made.  Thanks!

These cookies rock! The original recipe is fine, but I've made a few modifications to my own.  I use sliced toasted almonds instead of walnuts, and I use dark chocolate shavings as my "chips" that I then lightly fold in.  I also like to use white chocolate shavings.  MMM! Going to go bake some now!

This recipe was great! I did half brown and half white sugar and added just a little extra water to make the perfect texture. Then instead of regular chips I did mint Chocolate chips and they were a hit at the office!

These cookies were good, but I would bake them different next time. I followed some of the other suggestions and used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening. Every time I tasted the batter I thought, "Gross" b/c of the shortening flavor. It kinda ruined it for me even after the cookies were baked... it was like I could still taste the underlying shortening flavor. Next time I will use the 1 cup of butter as the recipe indicates. I also added about 1 cup dark chocolate chips and 1/2 cup white chocolate chips - this definitely saved the recipe and gave it the 4 stars.I also only baked the 8 minutes so they would remain a little gooey!

Very good, I used Dark Chocolate cocoa powder because that's what I had.  Very chocolatey.  I mailed some to my brother in Georgia, so we'll see how they hold up.  My Daughter (2), Husband, Mom, and Dad, loved them.  However my Nephews (10, 8) and Niece (4) didn't, they're pickier.  Will definately make again.  I got 5 dozen smaller cookies out of the batch.

These are wonderful!!! My husband & 2 daughters can't get enough....I've made them 2x in 3 days!! The only change I did was to take the advice of someone and use 1/2c. margarine & 1/2 c. shortening. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Fantastic!  Not too sweet and look and taste like they are store bought!  My bf couldn't resist eating a second one after they came out of the oven.

Excellent cookie! I too made some changes though. I did leave out the nuts, and replaced with 3/4 cup milk chocolate chips, 3/4 cup semi-sweet chips, and 3/4 cup white chocolate chips. A+ recipe!

perfecto!  
BUT i had much better texture (non-goopy-raw, even though who doesn't like brownie batter?) with 11-12 minutes of baking. perhaps because of my silicone baking pads? they became perfectly soft, chewy brownie-cookies - yum!!

i also used my usual mix of semi-sweet, milk & white chips

OMG!!!  Based on other reviews, I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored shortening.  I used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips to get a "peanut butter cup" taste.  These were awesome!  Soft, good texture, and amazing taste!  This is my new favorite cookie recipe!

I am 14 years old, and i made this recipe and thought it was delicous!!!! my siblings nicknamed them "brownie cookies" because i left them in the oven for about 15 minutes and for some reason they tasted and looked doughy but had a crunchy edge which we loved. We couldn't stop eating them!!!

These cookies were fantstic!  I followed the recipe exactly and they are moist and chocolatey.  9 minutes in the oven is perfect.  The cookies will be very soft when they come out, but they set up nicely.  

I brought them to work for a party and they were inhaled - the first things to be finished even though I brought a lot of them!

These are some of the best cookies I've ever made. I made no changes to the recipe. They're so soft and yummy, that I'm making a second batch to give away, cause I'm too greedy to share my own batch. :)

These were awesome! A wonderful "once a month" cookie for the ladies. =D~  I used mini semi sweet chips, peanut butter chips and some heath bits. I was cleaning out the baking cabinet and had a bit of each. I also used a half a cup of brown sugar in place of the white. Fabulous cookies! Thanks for sharing!

My family absolutely loved these cookies!  My 4yo actually asked me to make these again instead of buying a very popular chocolate and creme centered cookie at the store.  

I followed the directions exactly as written with one exception.  I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup vegetable shortening. 

The cookies turned out soft and oh so full of chocolate!  Absolutely delicious!  A recipe I will make again and again.

These cookies were just OK for me, but I experiment with a different cookie recipe almost daily lately, so I am little critical with cookie recipes. (I am on a baking kick). So in comparison with the other recipes that I have been making, this recipe was somewhere in the middle. It didn't really "wow" me, but I have to say that if you are craving chocolate, this will definately take care of it. I recommend the minimum baking time. I left mine in a minute longer, and they were a little more crisp than I would have liked.

These were great!  I used 60% cocoa chips.  I only got 28 cookies though.  I suppose if you made them small then you could get 48, but why make them small if you don't have to?  :0)  I baked them for 8 min and they were VERY soft.  Anything less than 8 min they wouldn't hold their shape.  These would be freaking awsome with peanut butter chips too!

Very very good!  Exactly 8 minutes gave a crispy outside and gooey inside.  I did half vanilla extract and half mint extract (1 tsp each) and used mini York peppermint patty baking bits instead of chips.  It's chocolate, it's peppermint, it's delicious, it's very refreshing!

These cookies were very good--came out soft and chewy. I used half brown sugar, half white, only because I couldn't imagine a chocolate chip cookie without brown sugar! I dropped each cookie by a teaspoon into a "chunky ball" and cooked them for exactly 8 minutes, every batch. They don't spread much--which makes them thicker and very tasty!

Flavor was chocolatey and delicious, however, I had issues with the actual structure of the cookie.  I followed the recipe as written (though after reading a few other reviews wish I had reduced the fat), and the dough was really sticky.  I baked the cookies for 10 minutes and let them cool on the pan, but they fell apart very easily (from being too soft).  After the first two batches I added about 1/3 C. more flour, then the cookies wouldn't spread (they just came out little half-spheres).  I think it's a recipe worth tweaking since the taste is so good, but as written I can only give it four stars.

I was a little worried about the amount of cocoa in this recipe. I thought that it might make the cookies taste bitter but when they came out of the oven, they were perfect! I also used half chocolate chips and half white chocolate chips which balanced out the chocolate taste. These are cookies that I will for sure make again.

these cookies are amazing!!! if you are craving a chocolate fix, look no further! the only thing i did different was added 1/4 c. of flour (as they seemed really runny), cooked on parchment paper, and used a cookie scooper as they were pretty sticky. try these cookies as you won't be dissapointed!!! thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is divine.  My lovely sister searched the internet for me and found it..  I played with it a little, trying to cut down on some fat, calories and carbs, so I used sifted soy flour, 1 stick butter and one half pint size promise, white chocolate chips, milk chocolate chips, chopped walnuts and baking powder.  I also used brown sugar, I really just threw ingredients in a bowl and came out with another version of this, it was so delish I couldn't resist eating a big honkin spoonful of batter with a big cup of low fat milk.  Spray your pan with Canola oil.  One of the best cookies I've ever had, I make them big so only two side by side on the cookie sheet otherwise they slide into each other.  Best thing about these cookies, I'm the only one in the house that eats walnuts.  Hehehehee

Made these for a party and guests were eating them off of the sheet as they came out of the oven.  Followed the recipe as written except I had refrigerated the dough so had to bake them a few minutes longer.  Once cooled they were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside with a great chocolate flavor - this one's a keeper!

The only real issue I had with these cookies is that 2 cups of flour was not enough. I added at least 1 1/2 cups extra. A decent cookie.

I make these all the time, for home, school, or any event.  They are delicious out of the oven, but don't keep for very long.  Best eat them in the first day or two.

These are the BEST chocolate cookies I have ever made or had!  I doubled the recipe and it made over 7 dozen! I used mini Reese's pieces in place of the chips.  I was a bit short on the cocoa, so I melted unsweetened baking chocolate for the difference.  (1 block + 1 Tbl shortening for 3 Tbl cocoa) I had to bake 9 min.  8 min was still a bit doughy in the middle.  Highly recommend this recipe!

These are really good cookies!! They are so simple to make, and they taste great!
I doubled the amount of vanilla called for (I always do – it’s just my personal preference) and I used M&M’s instead of chocolate chips, they look cute and very festive for Christmas cookies. I have also made these with white chocolate chips and walnuts and they look and taste like bakery quality cookies ? Thanks for the recipe !!

WOW. I jazzed it up for Christmas by using chopped dark Toblerone instead of chocolate chips, and no walnuts. They are the best chocolate cookie I've ever made. I'm sure with the choc. chips it would still be exceptional!!

Turned out VERY well!  I don't like chocolate chocolate chip cookies, but these were great!  Nice and fudgy.  My husband wanted white chips in them, so I did half white half semi sweet.  Turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe!

So delicious and chocolatey. I like crispy cookies so I had to bake them about twice as long, they definitely were still raw on the inside at 10 minutes. I also used all butter (no shortening) so they really spread out. But if you're a chocolate lover these really hit the spot!

Excellent. These taste like brownies. I lined my cookie sheet with parchment paper, then baked for 12 minutes. Let cool on the sheets for a minute or 2. 8-10 minutes isn't long enough baking time.

These were delicious.  I baked them on a stoneware pan and had to bake them for about 13-15 minutes.  Batches that were cooked with a shorter time were plump when I took them out, but then flattened and crumbled when cool.  With the longer baking time they were perfect.

This recipe is to die for! soo sinful. I ran out of white sugar, so I subtituted in 1/2 cup of brown and it turned out great. I also put in a mix of semi-sweet chocolate chips, chopped dark chocolate and milk chocolate as well the walnuts. They turned out moist just like the recipe said.  Best chocolate chip cookies I have ever baked.

Delicious.  I needed a recipe that didn't use brown sugar because I didn't have any at the time, and these cookies came out wonderful.  I followed the directions exactly, but of course everyone's oven is different... therefore, different baking times!  Just make sure to watch your cookies, and you'll be fine.  The cookies were moist, very chocolatey (which I loved, but some people said they were TOO chocolatey... pffft).  ;o)  Thank you for the recipe!  [Recipe Box]

I used Ghirardelli brand semisweet cocoa powder and semisweet chocolate chips along with plain margarine sticks instead of butter. THESE COOKIES ARE SO DELICIOUS THEY'RE STUPID!!! Best cookie recipe on this site, hands down.

Edit: All this time I've been using margarine instead of butter, but today I finally used butter and margarine at once plus chocolate chunks and these cookies are even better!!! Who knew that was possible? YUMMY!!!

very tasty. but i made a few healthy changes. i used 1/2 the amount of butter, 2/3 of the sugar, less salt, and about 1/2 of the chocolate chips.  and i also used mostly whole wheat flour rather than all-purpose.  and the cookies came out GREAT. next time, i want to use walnuts.

Very good. But not excellent. I got closer to 60 smaller cookies. They are pretty soft and delicate and very chocolatey, almost like brownies in flavour but certainly moist and tender after 9-10 mins in a preheated 350 oven on light non-stick pans. I only used half a regular sized bag of chocolate chips (maybe about 1 cup is all I had) and did not think it needed more. My daughter (2.5yrs) loved them so much  she stole a fourth cookie after I told her to wait until later to have another and refused to give it up and totally mashed it in her hand as I tried to take it away. Then she tried to eat the crumbs off the floor...

These are great. Similar to the Chewy Brownie Cookies...good when you don't have shortening on hand. These disappeared instantly! I put in semi-sweet and white chocolate chips and they were beautiful and delicious

I thought these were great. I cooked them on a stone and had to leave them in the oven an extra 5 minutes. I made ice cream sandwiches with them. They were delicious. This is the first cookie my husband gave 5 stars.

When I made these tasty cookies, I used all organic ingrediants and substituted the regular all purpose flour for Whole Wheat flour and it really gave it a nice and hearty taste!  I noticed that my dark cookie sheets burned these cookies much quicker than usual, just something to think about when making them!  This is a great recipe! No wonder all the great ratings! Enjoy them!  We did!

My kids would give these cookies 6 stars if they could. I was glad some people warned me about the extremely thick battter, if not, I too, would have thought I had messed up royally. I also did as others suggested and used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I cooked for the full 10 minutes and they turned out great!! I like them right out of the oven because then the middle is like a brownie. But they are still very good later too.

Ask my eldest son what cookies he would like me to bake this week for school lunches, chocolate chip was the one, stumbled across this reciepe, followed the tips about brown sugar.  This is cookie is yummy, I have already had two cookies to eat, just enough chocolate flavour to satisfy my chocolate cravings.  I am positive my kids will love these cookies and my husband , who loves chocolate just as much as I do.
Will keep this receipe

I took these cookies to a kids Valentines dance and served them another time to my hubby's friends.  The plate was cleared within 10 minutes of being at the dance and my hubby's friends comments were "mmmmm, is it ok if I have more?"  We love them!  Thank you for the recipe.

Soo good, although I made some changes :) First I used VERY good quality cocoa (from Williams & Sonoma), Decreased the flour by 1/8 cup, Used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Creamed the butter and sugar first then added eggs and vanilla. I then added about 1/2 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips. I then baked the cookie at 325 for 9 minutes.  It was like a decadent chocolate brownie in a cookie form!

These were just okay.  They actually tasted a lot like brownies.  Nobody asked me to make them again like they do with a lot of the 5 star recipes from this site so I was suprised.  I'll try tweaking the recipe a bit next time.

Ok, so until I make these as written, I can't fully give 5 stars.  Instead, I have to admit that I love the versatility of this recipe.  I only made a half batch and I substituted peanut butter for cocoa, and used butterscotch and dark chocolate chips...YUMMY!  Will keep making these (this is my 2nd batch in 2 weeks!).

These cookies came out really well. I got the best results when I took the cookies out of the oven appearing slightly underbaked. They were still soft for a few days in an airtight container.

I realized half way through making these that I didn't have any cocoa powder. I left it out and they still turned out like perfect chocolate chip cookies. I'm impressed!

Read the reviews and had to make them.  Wow!!  What a powerful punch of chocolate in a small cookie.  It's a great turn on the traditional chocolate chip cookie.

So good. They were fluffy and chewy, just how I love them. I did 1/2 c butter flavored shortening and 1/2 c butter just for fun. I am sure they would have been fabulous even w/ just butter, as in the original recipe.

Very good cookies. I deviated from the reciple a little; used 1 C sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar, omitted the nuts, and used some very pretty mint chocolate swirled chips.  They were quite good, soft in the middle and a little crunchy on the edges.

My husband said these were the best cookies he ever had!  Need I say more?  I would give these 10 Stars if I could.  I like to use the chocolate chunks instead of chips.  Also very good with peanutbutter chips or white chocolate chips & macadamia nuts!  Be sure not to overcook.

I followed this recipe exactly and they baked nicely, great texture and great flavor but after a couple of days of being stored in a zip lock bag they became very dry and crumbly.  I threw out half of the batch, they were falling apart.

These are without any doubt the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had. And they stay soft too! I skipped the walnuts. The cookies taste great without them.

I made these for my husband's coworkers, and they LOVED them. I personally thought they would be more chocolatey. I substituted half brown sugar and half white like many had written, maybe that's why I thought it wasn't sweet enough. I'll try it the regular way next time. These are great with a tall cold glass of milk!

These were delicious!!   It was like chocolate decadence!!  I did use white and brown sugar instead of all white like others suggested.  I also use 1 cup of cocoa, sweetens them up just a little more.  I baked for only 8 minutes and let them stay on the cookie sheet for 2 minutes before removing them to cooling rack.  They came out perfectly, not burned on the bottom and very moist.  Kept them in a sealed plastic tub and were still fresh 5 days later!!  My son pops them in them in the micro for about 10 seconds to get them warm again and eats them with a cold glass of milk!!    Delicious!!!

I also made this with half brown sugar and half white sugar. Also, peanuts make such a great addition to these cookies! I was bummed to pull out my walnuts to discover they had gone rancid. I desperately wanted nuts in my cookies, so I searched my pantry for any type of nuts I could find. The only thing I had was roasted salted peanuts, so I rubbed as much salt off as possible and added them to my cookies. I got rave reviews at my church picnic!

this cookie was not as "rich" as everyone made it out to be, as a chocoholic I was hopeing it was going to be as rich as a brownie the way people talk.  and its not..
but they still tasted good I saw many people say that they dry out fast, if you store them in an air tight container they will stay soft and moist for DAYS!!!!!!!!

I really like this cookie. But I used half sugar/half brown sugar, like my traditional c.c. cookie recipe. I also baked them at 375 degrees instead of 350, as I do not care much for chewy cookies. Will definately be making these again!

Excellent recipes. VERY chocolatey.  My kids loved them, and I loved them.  My husband said they were "too" chocolatey (as if!!). He thought they would be good with peanut butter chips in place of the chocolate chips.

I left the cookies in for 9 minutes and they were perfect. Chewy and soft!

I used half brown and half white sugar and might have used a bit more cocoa powder than needed. They were a real chocolate bomb, so rich even I couldn't eat more then one in one go. My friends ate them, but said they were just ok

These were delicious!  My 13 y.o. daughter, who never tries to cook ANYTHING came home one afternoon and wanted to bake storebought cookie dough, only to find out that it had been in the fridge too long, and gotten dry.  She asked for a recipe.  I found this one, printed and gave it to her. She made them all by herself.  I was really worried about how they would turn out because she wasn't worried at all about being precise with the amounts!  LOL!  I really believe this is the first time she has EVER made anything with a recipe by herself!  They came out wonderfully and she was SO proud of her cookies!  Thanks!

These cookies were a little dry and the chocolate flavor was not great - I used Hershey's cocoa.

In an attempt to soften the butter, we melted it.  We used it anyway and just added a little more flower to compensate.  The cookies actually turned out really good.  Soft and chewy.  We used white chocolate chip cookies.

Another hit at the fire academy!  The recruits ate them all, and the only complaint my husband heard, was that he didn't bring enough! Next time, I'll make them a bit larger, though - I dropped them onto the cookie sheet with a rounded teaspoon - and they came out "bite sized."  Next time I'll add a little extra dough!

One of the BEST cookie recipes I have ever made.  I used only 1 cup sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups.  I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown like other people suggested.  Instead of nuts I added coconut.  I also store mine in a tin instead of a Tupperware container.  If there are any leftovers to store that is.  These will sure dissapear fast!

This is a fabulous chocolate chocolate chip recipe!  I make it frequently.  

The only change I make on a regular basis is to substitute 1/2 c. of the white sugar with brown sugar.  I think this give it a little more rounded-out flavor.  

I also usually use 1/2 white flour and 1/2 wheat flour and don't notice any change in flavor at all (this is an easy way to add nutrients to any dish).

It's great as-is though, the whole family will love it!  Everyone in the house thinks these are great cookies.

After baking half of the cookies, I decided to add flour since they were so flat.  Next time I will add 1 cup to the whole batch.  The second half was much better.  These were good, but the I actually like the recipe I had better.  If I had nothing to compare these to, they might get a better rating.

Wow these were phenomenally good! I didn't have chocolate chips but was craving chocolate big time. I used vegetable margarine for butter and egg replacer for the eggs because I'm adopting a vegan diet (although I did use white sugar) and rolled them into balls flattening with a fork and they taste great! I ate 7 today! My two male non-vegan roomies loved them too! Thanks a bunch! :)

This is a great cookie recipe if you LOVE chocolate. It was fantastic. I did use milk chocolate chips because my husband doesn't like semi-sweet. I didn't think it was too chocolatey. I had to bake the whole 10 minutes and I let it cool on the baking sheet a couple minutes before transferring to cooling rack. It made 3.5 dozen cookies for me.

I only used 1 1/4 cup sugar and left them in for 10 mins and they still turned out super.  Next time I'll take them out at 8 mins so they're not as dry.  Somehow half the tray was gone b4 my kids got home from school!

The recipe I've been looking for!  These were delicious - soft, a bit chewy, very chocolately without being bitter.  They weren't overly sweet, and they did a great job carrying milk chocolate M&Ms.  They do seem a little sensitive to baking times, though, because a little too long and they get dry.  Take them out when they're set but still soft for them to be perfect.

Will make this again and again!  Thank you!

What can I say.....AMAZING!! I always use the "old stand by" recipes but wanted something new.  Well these will be made a lot!! Only thing I did different was I changed the chocolate chips to 1 1/2 cups and added 1/2 cup peanut butter chips. I didn't have enough chocolate chips on hand lol! BRAVO!!

very good! We used Halloween chips  (had orange colored white chocolate and chocolate chips) and they tasted great.  I can't help but wonder how the peanut butter chips or the new mini mini peanut butter cups would taste...i am thinking yummy!

Made the recipe as stated, scaled it to make half.  Nice dough. Did not care for the flavor though.  Too much vanilla falvor & over all they were way too sweet. Would not make again.

I am not sure if the consistency was right.  I switched the recipe to bake half and it came out too runny.  It sounded like a great cookie, I might have to try again for the full amount.

This cookie is quickly becoming one of my most requested recipes.  I've made it for a girls' softball team, bake sales and family get-togethers.  It tastes like a brownie.  Make sure to bake them long enough otherwise they fall apart.  I always add Mini M&Ms as well as the chocolate chips!  Absolutely sinful!!!

The best double chocolate chip recipe I've tried.  Cookies come out moist and chewy and they don't thin and flatten out too much like some other cookie recipes.  A keeper for sure.

Our favorite from now on. Per other reviews I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored Crisco, 1 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown, decreased the cocoa by 2 T. and baked 8 min. with 2 min. to cool on the sheet.  They were gooey and soft. Did flatten out some, just what we wanted.  We don't care for the more cake type that are mounded.  These won't last long, thanks Kathy.

I followed the recipe except for substituting some cocoa powder for chocolate powder. 

The mixture was very very sticky but not dry. When baking, the cookies starting expanding and deforming and soon all of them were stuck together. I find the cookies quite tasty but way too sweet and they're very flat and chewy like cake =(

We renamed this the PMS cookie.  Excellent for the chocolate craver or lover.  To those who are finding the cookie dries out, the secret is to bake them the least amount of time and then to immediately put them in an airtight container as soon as they are completely cooled.

I have been reading the reviews of this cookie recipe and can't believe some people thought they were dry.  I did have one problem when making them -- they were sooo soft when they came out of the oven and I tried to take them off the cookie sheet before they were cool.  Not a good idea, because they were too soft.  I found that I had to bake them a little longer than the 8-10 min. suggested, but every oven is different.  I was afraid they would be too chocolaty so cut down on the cocoa powder by a tablespoon or so, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I'll use the full cocoa powder amount, as they were not too chocolaty.  They were very easy, very moist, and were absolutely delish!!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

Excellent cookies.  The only alterations I made were to use 1 stick of butter plus 1 stick of Nucoa margarine and substituting brown sugar for 1/2 cup of the sugar called for.  These have a nice chewy/crisp texture - very rich.

These were great! I didnt think id like them, i usually dont like cookies, but these came out soft and chewy, aven after being in the fridge for a whole night. I added a 1/4 cup of brown sugar (my son insisted), and left out the nuts- were not big on crunchy cookies. I only make a dozen at a time and keep the rest in the fridge, its kept for 4 days very well.

These are wonderful!  I used 1/2c margarine, 1/2 butter shortening, as well as 1/2 cake flour since I ran out of all-purpose.  They are such an indulgence!  Great recipe!

I copied this recipe yesterday and then made them today. I read quite a few of the reviews and decided to use 1/2 c butter & 1/2 c butter flavoured shortening, as is my practice when preparing regular chocolate chip cookies. I also used 1/2 c packed brown sugar and 1 c white sugar. I remembered reviews that these cookies can be dry when I had finished mixing the batter and realized that even the batter is stiff and dry. I decided to add a heaping tablespoon of liquid honey, which I made sure to incorporate well. I was worried but OMG these cookies were excellent. I always get complements on my cookies, but just as Kathy reported, people said I should sell these!! Thanks Kathy!

I made these cookies for my boyfriend's office, and they were a HUGE hit. They wouldn't stop praising him (he lied and said he made them). They have an amazing brownie-like texture that stays moist. Simply delicious. 

When I made them, I ran out of bittersweet morsels, so I used up some peanut butter and butterscotch morsels I had. I would not recommend using the butterscotch because it was too sweet for such a rich cookie. Next time it will just be the bittersweet chocolate and some nuts. Also, be sure to let them cool completely before you move them around too much. They are very, very soft and prone to breaking apart when they first come out the oven. 9 minutes was perfect for my baking time.

These cookies are terrific. I have tried adding dried cranberries and white chocolate chips, which turns makes a somewhat sophisticated cookie, as well as reeces pieces and white chocolate chips - also very yummy!

Great cookies!  I made them with peanut butter rather than chocolate chips and they turned out wonderfully, despite using 1/2 c butter and 1/2 c vegetable oil spread (I'm a butter snob usually!).  Will use again.

Per previous suggestions, I used 1/2 c. butter-flavored shortening and 1/2 c. butter to try and retain moisture. I also used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1 c. white sugar. The cookies turned out great - wonderful taste! Be careful not to overbake (8 minutes was definitely enough). Also, eat quickly; they get just a little dry in the days after they're made - even if they're sealed up.

Being in the UK the ingredients differed slightly. I used a salted butter and ommited the salt. Then I had 50% more butter and then they were perfect. Soft and chewy! If any English people make these cookies I suggest you use anchor butter and  cut chunks of bournville © I found that worked well! I will definately add this one to the recipe book.

Very, very good! They were cake like and very moist.  If you don't like an all chocolate and soft cookie then these are not for you.  If you can't get enough of chocolate like me then try these.  Easy to put together in no time.  Next time I want to try adding peanut butter chips!

This is an excellent cookie recipe for chocolate lovers!  My 1 year old is a picky eater and absolutly loved it!  I added 1 cup chocolate chips and 1 cup of peanut butter chips for a different twist.  (Instead of 2 cups chocolate chips.)  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!  We will be making this cookie recipe again!

These cookies didn't meet my expectations. The were "ok" when they first came out of the oven, but after a few hours, they just weren't that tasty. I will not be making these again and continue searching for the best cookie recipe.

Funny story behind this...
Being new to cooking from scratch, I'm not yet familiar with what you can (or can't) substitute in terms of ingredients.  When I first tried this recipie, I didn't have cocoa powder, so I figured I'd use some vanilla malted milk instead.  Ouch.  I'm sure all the experienced cooks out there are rolling their eyes at my mistake.  For future refrence... don't use malted milk in cookies.
I then tried the recipie again when I got some cocoa powder and WOW!  Super soft, chewy, melt in your mouth good!  I love this recipie, especially now since I have a funny story to go with them now! lol
I have since used powdered chocolate Ovaltine in place of the cocoa powder and it was equally as delicious.  YUMMY!  Thanks :)

These cookies were "melt in your mouth" gooey right out of the oven.  They were best the first day but were still tasty the second.  They were a definite hit with my husband and kids.  Next time I will try milk chocolate chips.

I used 1/2 cup brown sugar in place of 1/2 of white sugar and melted the butter. I added 1/2 cup of mint chocolate chips. This is a great recipe. My boyfriend loves them.

Wonderful cookies!  They hardly spread at all resulting in a chewy, rich, thick, perfect cookie.  I used half butter, half margarine and they turned out great.

These are great. I had no chocolate chips, so did them without them and powdered them with confectioners' sugar when they were done. Looked nice and Christmassy :) A friend said they could have been sweeter and that he'd have added more powdered sugar to the batter, maybe that is worth a try -- I kind of liked them as a more dark-chocolate flavour though. Keeping this recipe, may try it with white chocolate chips some time.

MMMMMMM Perfect Chocolate Cookies!!  Tried these cookies with semi sweet chocolate chunks.  These cookies are definately for the chocoholic cookie monster (s) in your family.  Cookies were soft in texture and chocolatey, much like a brownie.  I rate these a 10+.  They were absolutly wonderful, even the next day if they last that long.  :)

I just made these cookies and they are like little brownies.  Mine didn't flatten out and they are very cake like.  The chocolate factor is right on though.  When I make cookies I want a cookie, not a little brownie. The flavor was good, but I will keep looking.

Absolutely fantastic.  I needed the chocolate chips for another recipe so I added Reese's Pieces instead.  Even better than they would have been I'll bet.  I found a time of 8 minutes just right for small cookies (level tablespoon) and a bit longer for bigger cookies.  For small cookies you can probably get 6 dozen out of the recipe, I ended up doing about 2 dozen small ones then making the cookies a bit bigger.  Ended up with a total of 52 cookies

I made these for the high school students I'm teaching and they were all very very enthusiastic about the cookies.  They just melt in the mouth!  I used Nestle Chocolate Chunks.  I also reduced the recipe by 3/4 and it worked just fine.  This recipe is a winner!

These are great cookies for chocolate lovers! I used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 cup white, and used whole wheat for 1 cup of the flour (NO ONE noticed!).  Try Ghiradelli double chocolate chips for a really chocolately treat.

Really good! I lined my cookie sheets with foil which really helped because these cookies are very delicate when they come out of the oven. It helps to let them sit for 5 minutes on the sheet before trying to remove them.  I used chopped large milk and dark chocolate candy bars instead of chocolate chips because that's what I had on hand.  These are like chewy, crispy brownies.  YUM!

OH MY GOSH!  These cookies are the tasting cookie ever.  I was concerned they were too gooey after 10 minutes of baking but I let them cool slightly before removing them from the pan.  They turned out perfect.  I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe.  I difinately will make them again and again and again.  You have to try these!

These cookies are good. I'm sure they would have been better if I had used real chocolate chips as opposed to the reduced fat ones with Salatrim. I added pecans to this recipe and they added to the flavor.  Perhaps next time I make these cookies I will add apple sauce or something to make them more moist--because they get dry after a day--which makes them taste like really good biscotti.

THESE COOKIES ARE THE ABSOLUTE BEST COOKIES I HAVE EVER TASTED!!! I bake a lot and these cookies were by far the best. Very chewy and moist but not gooey. Extremely easy to make. I added 1/2 cup sliced almonds instead of the walnuts. The cookies were gone in 1 day!! Thank you for this recipe--it is a definate keeper in my file. I wish I could give it more stars.

I found the recipe very good and will make it again . It gives the chocolate lover just enough of a chocolate fix to make one happy. My husband has a nice smile on his face. It also has a nice cake like texture inside. Thank you for this recipe . Ally 2

Great cookie! I used a full bag of chocolate chips (mini Kisses actually) and a full bag of Peanut Butter Chips... they're chock full of 'YUM!' I threw all the ingredients into my stand mixer, baked and cleaned in about an hour. I can't wait to make this again... perhaps I will tonight!

Excellent!!!  These were just VERY VERY Yummy! I almost forgot the butter (hehe left it in the microwave and was wondering why it looked real dry for a cookie mixture hehe)  I ended up adding it in the very end (after folding in the chocolate chips)  But they turned out great! It was VERY chocolatey.  These are for chocolate lovers out there!

I love this recipe!!  I substituted half of the amount of white sugar with Splenda to reduce calories a *little* bit.  Also, you can try using Ovaltine instead of standard cocoa -- I used "Rich Chocolate" flavor and it came out wonderfully.  Another favorite recipe in my book ... too bad I'm on a diet!  LOL.

Very easy to make, and they have a great cocoa taste - plus the chocolate chips add the perfect burst of crunch and chocolate taste without being overbearing.

I made 36 cookies with this recipe which came out very delicious. I could have made more by making them a little smaller probably. I used quality bittersweet chips, semi sweet and some milk chocolate chips also. I used parchment paper on my cookie sheets for easy peasy clean up. These are perfect for your Chocolate cravings

I made this with a few minor changes.  I cut the recipe in half.  I  replace half the sugar with light brown sugar.  I used half white chocolate chips and half regular.  With these changes, I had the odd experience that I had to bake them MUCH longer than stated.  I kept taking them out and testing every 2 minutes (after the 10 min mark) and probably baked them about 20 min all total.  My best guess is that the light brown sugar is "wetter" than normal white sugar, but I really don't know.  However, after they were finally done, they were awesome.

Wonderful, just wonderful - I made these with no changes to the recipe, but without nuts, and baked them for 8 minutes. I had greased the cookie sheet with a very small coating of butter but it didn't seem to effect the outcome. They were excellent flavor and baked just right. This is a keeper recipe!

My son loved these cookies.  Added a little more chocolate chips and used a combination of semi-sweet and milk chocolate.

Awesome cookies, added 1 cup of chopped pecans, that's what I had on hand. I think any kind of nut would be good. Do advice to add nuts, that's what really makes it especially good.

I made these and substituted andirs candies for the chocolate chips. The cookie was soft and tasty but a bit dry. I might pull back on the cocoa next time.

Almost too chocolaty, but very good. Only my brother complained about the lack of flavors that balance out the chocolate. He’s a tough critic though and I loved them

Forget the baking soda - you don’t knead it! LOL get it? I hope so. 

The cookies were pretty good. I’d like to thank everyone who has supported me throughout the creative process, especially Jasper, my cat.

Instead of chocolate chips I added peppermint filled baking truffles.  Delicious!  The baking time noted was not accurate at my elevation.  Had to bake these for 18 minutes.  Will definitely make these again.

Pretty tasty cookies.  I added white and dark chocolate chips to them. They were delicious! Next time around I'm sticking with white chocolate and adding crushed peppermint instead of walnuts.

First time making these. A number of review said to put the dough in the fridge for about an hour, they still went flat. Read a lot of reviews that said to cut the white sugar with brown, big mistake on my part for doing that. These were just ok cookies.  I’m not a terrible baker by any stretch but I don’t see what the fuss is about with these and will not make them again.

I took these cookies to a church social; they received rave reviews.  I did not make any changes to the recipe and they were great.   I am going to try peppermint chips in them the next time.  I believe you could use any type of chips or nuts.

OMG!
Just made a half batch of these cookies. Absolutely delicious!
The only thing I didn't measure was the chocolate chips.

My half sheet pans are thick aluminum, so I cooked them for 12 minutes. Next time I'll cook for 14 cause they were still a little under done.
That said, these were the best cookies I have ever baked!

Don't worry if you don't have a mixer, I mixed with a wooden spoon, fork and rubber spatula.

(Edit) I used margarine instead of butter. Was what I had.
Dough was kinda sticky, but made perfect cookies.

Thank you for this recipe; everyone who had one of these loved them! I tweaked it a bit by adding 1 cup each of semi- and bittersweet chips plus 2 T espresso powder. My new “go to” people pleasing cookie ??

These are fantastic. I always make a double batch and freeze half to bake at a later time. The only changes I make is to add some cocoa nibs and a little espresso powder.

I've made cookies many times before. Never have I ever had so many issues. First, they're still raw in the middle. Found that out after the first batch after I fought to get them off the pan once cooled. So because they're raw in the middle, they're just falling apart everywhere. After adjusting the temp about 20 degrees and time to 11 minutes, they're just.... garbage. I'm not serving these to my guest.

I just made these today.   I was leary at first.   I've never made chocolate chocolate chip cookies before, althrough I've made many other kinds of cookies.   I was afraid it would be too bitter with all the chocolate.  To my surprise they were delicious.     To those who said the cookies were raw,   I thought so too when I baked them for 8 mins. exactly.      But when cooled completely,  they are very chewy soft cookie.    I ended up baking them 9 mins. exactly in my oven.   I plan on making another batch tomorrow.   Thank you for the recipe.

These are awesome cookies.  I made one change - half butter and half shortening.  They turn out soft and chewy and melt in your mouth.  I also took them out about a bit early,  just before you think they are done.

I used the converter and made 75 cookies. The batter was a teeny little bit dry, but the cookies turned out delicious! I also used 1/4 cup brown sugar in place of 1/4 cup white.  I used the convection setting because I was doing two trays at a time. I increased the heat to 375. These cookies are just like brownies. I'll be making them again for sure!

Delicious Cookies, I used a whole cup of cocoa instead of 2/3 and I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar.  I also used Chilli Powder because this was for a grown ups party.  I didn't put enough in, I think its needs a least a few teaspoons.  
This recipe was easy to amend and super chocolatey!!

Great cookies!! From one batch you can easily get 24 cookies. I split the cookie batch with non-walnut cookies and regular ones due to my household preferences.

Wow. This one is a seriously good recipe. The best chocolate chocolate chip cookie I ever baked and had. I used 1/4 brown sugar and 1/4 regular sugar (considering other comments) and I think I could even use 1/3 cup next time. I also froze the cookies for 30 minutes before baking them. Texture is fantastic.

These are very good and chewy! I used 1 c brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. I also used 1 t of baking soda as my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe states to add (in spot on proportions to this recipe) the cookies are fabulous. This will be a great welcome home to my husband, who asked me yesterday "do we have anything chocolate stashed around here anywhere?"

This cookies were a big hit!  
I used softened butter as it calls for and, unlike a couple other reviewers stated, my cookies were not flat.  You just can’t beat the taste of butter.
I did swap the walnuts out for toasted pecans...yum!

This recipe is good as is in my opinion. Still, some reviews are good to follow. The first one: mix the butter and sugar until fluffy. I achieve this by setting my standing mixer on 2 and prepping the other ingredients while it beats the butter and sugar. The second: under bake them a bit. I baked mine for 6 minutes and it still dried out as it cooled off. The third: use a combo of butter/shortening for a thicker cookie. Fourth: Put it in the fridge especially if using butter only for the recipe. Fifth: use the aluminum foil trick to prevent them from sticking. If you have a silicon mat, wonderful! These cookies are crunchy, a bit flat, but overall very good. I made half the recipe and was in need of roughly 1 tbsp of baking cocoa. To make up for the rest of it, I used espresso which is known to boost the chocolate flavor. My suggestion would be to add bit extra flour and use cold cookie sheets with every batch if using butter only to prevent flattening. Also, lower the temperature to 325F especially if your oven is too hot. There are lots of things to play with in this recipe but fine tuning it with the above recommendations should yield very good results. I will make this again next time with my recommendations and following the reviewer's suggestions as I did. The advises are worth it. You can definitely reduce the sugar by 1/4 c or combine white and brown just try your chocolate chips and adjust to them. Store the cookies in an air tight container and they should stay sof

First, let me say, I made this recipe EXACTLY as written. I measured my flour the PROPER way, and followed all the rules of textbook baking (sifting, incorporating one egg at a time, etc).

Okay, this was such a weird recipe. First of all, the dough turned out the consistency of canned frosting. It was very soft, which I was wary of, but the dough was so dang tasty that I didn't care if they didn't turn out, because I would gladly eat the raw dough! I decided to trust the dough.

I chilled the dough overnight but it hardly set anymore than it did at room temp, so I used two spoons to drop it on the tray and put the dough in the freezer between trays.

At first, when baked for 10 minutes the cookies weren't even baked. They were raw except for rhe edges, which had set beautifully. I upped the bake time to 12 minutes. Now the cookies were what I call "chewy baked" meaning you're not going to get salmonella, but the centers are slightly raw and cool to a chewy texture. They were also very thin.

At first I pondered if I had made a mistake. I rechecked my methods and the recipe. Nope, I had done everything right. I thought next time I will add more flour, but many of the folks who tried this recipe talk about REDUCING the flour! (Which, btw, I do not recommend.)

Then, while a tray was in the oven, I got distracted and let the cookies go for 14 minutes on accident. I worried I had burned them, but when I pulled them out they were perfect. They had baked to a beautiful height, the

I just need to learn how to make it better

Love the flavor but the sugar content is way too high. I made these this afternoon and was very pleased at the simplicity and ease of the recipe. Next time though I will take the sugar down to one cup, I think that will still be plenty. Overall, very good recipe.

The dough is very sticky and a bit hard to work with.  I baked the first batch for 10 minutes and they were a bit too doughy but add 2 extra minutes and they were perfect. My family loved these cookies and i definitely recommend.  Super chocolatey and super yummy

Oh my god dont make a double batch. Theres so many. Also if you run out of eggs just use a cup of yogurt!

I did what one of the other posts suggested and used 1/2c butter and 1/2c shortening and then split the sugar in half as well between white sugar and brown sugar. Divine!!

These guys are pretty good but also really sweet. The chocolate flavor is definitely there and the cookies are a lot moister than most double chocolate cookie recipes I’ve made. To make them again, I think I would cut the sugar do sugar down to 1 cup. And while they are moist, these cookies seem a little grainy. I think if you replaced half or even a fourth of the butter with yogurt the cookies would be less crumbly. Overall though, these are pretty delicious and no one will be sad if you make them.

I have celiac disease so I converted this to be gluten free. They turned out great. I followed the suggestions by splitting the volume on the sugars using white and brown and the fats using butter and shortening. I used 1t ea baking soda and powder and 3/4t xanthan gum for binding. The flour is a mixture of rice, tapioca, and potato starch flours. I ended up baking for12 min as they came out way too raw at even 10 min. Maybe it’s my oven. A lot of recipes don’t necessarily convert well to GF but this one does.

I did 1/2 light brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar to get the chewiness texture of a chocolate cookie. If I make them again, I will use dark brown sugar instead of light, and melt and then cool baker's chocolate instead of cocoa.

Made a couple  of changes due to necessity.  I had a half bag each of peanut butter, chocolate chip and butterscotch chips so I used them all.  Also put in about a cup of chopped pecans. Also, I used Splenda since we have to watch out sugar where possible.  With the extra ingredients, my dough was a little dry so I added one egg.   Overall, great cookie and I am enjoying my fifth one since they started coming out of the oven.

AMAZING cookies. I went with the other comments and did half sugar, half (dark) brown sugar, and I think it really made a difference the second time around. Some have done all brown, but I’m a bit iffy on that.

Holy Moly...talk about knocking your socks off GOOD!! I just tried this recipe but altered it a wee bit for the kiddo's and hubby. Instead of adding chocolate chips..I did the Reese Peanut butter chips. I also added some dry powdered peanuts to the flour mix (perhaps approx 1/8 cup) just to bump up the peanutty taste! I think this overall taste's like a brownie infested with Reese Peanut butter cups! I am in LOVE!!

Taste phenomenal. A little on the sweet side so beware, but it was right up my alley. Only thing to note is that for me, these maintained the exact same shape coming out of then oven as they did going in so I had to mash them down into cookie form at my 9 minute mark. They came out soft and beautiful and stayed that way throughout the week. Going to keep this one in the books for sure

Perfect exactly as written. Needed to send some cookies to work with my husband and decided to give these a try. LOVE these cookies! Sent 3/4’s of the batch to work with him, the techs were raving and asking for more! Next time I’ll have to make 2 batches... send 1 keep 1.

This recipe has quickly become a favorite. It also works great as gluten free for those in my family that need it.

Thick, chewy soft baked cookies with great flavor!  The best double chocolate chip cookie I've ever had. If you're looking for a crispy cookie, they aren't for you.  I always substitute 1/2 of the sugar for brown sugar in all my cookie recipes.  These came out great but I had to bake them for 14 minutes because the dough stayed tall and didn't spread that much.  I'm wondering if people with super flat cookies used warm butter.  My butter was on the cold side of room temp which is probably why it was thicker.

Oh my goodness, were these delicious?  I didn't change a thing and I didn't need to.  They were chocolaty perfection.  I am partial to all things chocolate so may be a bit biased, but I will absolutely make these again.  They remind me of cookies my grandma made when I was a kid.  Thanks!

I made these with my stepdaughters. They loved them. I think next time I’ll put nuts in them. The girls wanted to sprinkle crushed mint candy on top so we didn’t put nuts in this time. They were good with the mint too. It’s a great recipe.

I will definitely make these again. We used 1/2 mini chocolate chips and 1/2 Andes mint baking pieces, then pressed the tops in more Andes pieces before baking. Baked 11 minutes - rich, delicious, and perfectly soft.

A year ago, I’m pretty sure I lost this recipe and I was devastated. I’ve been searching since, testing other chocolate cookie recipes, but none of them is as delicious as this one, hopefully. Everyone in my family asks what happened to my “brownie cookies” but they are devastated to hear that I lost my recipe. Making this for them will definitely make up for the time without these delicious cookies!!

LOVE LOVE LOVE these!  I froze the chocolate chips overnight prior to baking these cookies to prevent the cookie flattening issue other reviewers mentioned. These are soft, fluffy, bites of chocolate heaven. They aren’t too chocolately either; they have more of a chocolate whipped cream flavor. I will definitely by making these again!

These are amazingingly delicious cookies.
You don't even need to alter the recipe at all...just follow it exactly. I used salted butter (the Great Value brand from WalMart) and it worked just fine. I made the balls of dough a little under the size of a golf ball and the nice thing is...they dont flatten when they cook. They stay a nice somewhat firm shape.
I cook them for about 9 min. That leaves them somewhat firm when cool but soft in the center.
I think when I make these next, I might try adding some caramel and sea salt as well. Yum yum yum!

I make cookies all the time and have tried many different recipes and these are by the far THE BEST cookies I’ve ever made! Thanks to the recommendations, I also used half white sugar half brown sugar and half of the butter with vegetable shortnening. So so good and still soft the next morning! I also replaced a half cup of the chocolate chips with white chocolate chips and it turned out so great!

These are super chocolatey and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except I did not add salt or nuts, and I used a mixture of white chocolate, semi sweet, and whites chocolate chips. An easy, straight forward, no fuss recipe I will be making again! If you’re having a chocolate craving... make these!

Made these exactly as the recipe stated, and they turned out perfect! They are very chocolate-y obviously but not insanely sweet. We will be making them again!

These were pretty good but I used a cup of oil (per substitution instructions from AR) instead of butter... but the batter was soo thick and dry! Did a test batch and I then ended up adding about 1 more cup of oil and half stick butter, which seemed to fix things. I also omitted the chocolate chips, which may have been part of the problem.

I did not have enough chocolate chips so I added 1 cup of coco powder and a cup of chocolate chips and a little bit of milk so all the coco powder would not make it dry.

My favorite cookies by far! Instead of adding 2 cups of chocolate chips, I only did 1 1/2 cups. Just makes them a little more doughy. Anyway, this recipe is highly recommended!

Since I love the combination of chocolate and peanut butter, I used peanut butter chips. These came out soft and chewy rather than brittle hard.

These are really good! Crispy on the outside, and gooey on the inside. Instead of 2 cups semisweet chocolate, I added 1 cup semisweet chocolate, 1 cup white chocolate. Just as good!

After reading Diane McAfee's  review I went w/ her changes: 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening and 1/2 white sugar 1/2 brown sugar. Excellent rendition- for the first time ever my chocolate chip cookies didn't turn out like a flat crepe! D/t how intense the chocolate flavor was after adding 2/3 c of coco I opted to only add 1 c of chips. My husband isnt too keen on super sweet desserts but i had to give this one a try. He couldn't eat a whole cookie in one sesssion but loved the chewy gooey mouthful straight out of the oven! Next time maybe i'll try 1/3 c coco and 2 c of chips.

I’ve made these so many times and they truly are the best. My family and friends request these all the time. Anyone who is a chocolate lover will love these!!!! One correction, I put the dough in the refrigerator for 20 mins before baking. I also shape into round balls so that they come out looking round and pretty.

These cookies turned out great! My family loved them. I ended up upping the baking time by about 2 minutes as the cookies weren’t setting how I wanted them to. Other than that, this recipe worked out great for me!

“These taste like Heaven!” Words from my 7 year old son after he helped make these. We did make a few modifications after reading others reviews, but I’m sure it’s great as written as well. I substituted half the butter for shortening, used 1 c. White sugar and 1/2 c. Brown sugar, and chocolate chunks instead of chips. I also chilled the dough and had nice thick cookies!!! Absolutely a chocolate lovers dream cookie!!!

These are delicious!! I used an ice cream scoop and they were cooked in 13-14 minutes. I cooked them right away and also some after refrigerating them and there wasn’t a significant difference. These cookies definitely need some milk. I would reserve a 1/4 of the chocolate chips to put on top of the cookies after you portion them.

OMG good! These cookies are super yummy I have been batting off daughters and friends but this recipe makes about 3 dozen cookies at least the size I chose to make them IF you flatten out the ball a little you get a cookie that looks like the picture in the recipe but they are yummy either way! The chocolate chocolate chips (could be butter scotch or even better peanut butter chips) and walnuts give you a perfect flavorful taste in your mouth that says I want more of these!!!! Definitely going to be a favorite around here

These are my go to cookies.  I do swap some white sugar with brown sugar but the best step is sprinkling a little sea salt on them just as they are out of the oven.  My son LOVES that.

I    used these as Christmas gift cookies. I used half shorteningand  half butter and I added an extra 2 T of flour  as I usedDutch process for half the cocoa. I like  a mix of natural andDutch in these cookies. I think using white and brown  sugaradds depth of chocolate flavor. This cookies has a nice solid
Texture , chewy with crisp edges. I will let you know how they keep. You can change the flavor up by using different types of chocolate. I like a mix of Bittersweet and milk. Want to experiment with other kinds. Red and green  m&Ms..........THIS IS A KEEPER!

Great! I usually make it as written, but today I added one teaspoon of peppermint extract and two extra tablespoons of flour, and I replaced half of the chocolate chips with vanilla chips. Great Christmas cookies!

I made this for a Christmas cookie exchange.  I read the reviews and chilled the batter before baking.  I tried one of the cookies about 12 hrs after making it and it was very dry.  Very disappointed. ??

Easy to make, and to be honest, I haven't tasted the cookies yet (they look amazing), but I licked the spoon the dough is OH SO GOOD!  Chocolate heaven in a bowl.  I'm gonna be popular at work (soon...there's no way this batch will make it out of the house).

I followed the recipe but used white and brown sugar. They are really good, but exceptionally sweet.

I liked it as dough not as much cookies. When me and my family ate it as cookies it was extremely chocolate and sweet.

These cookies were delicious! I did half sugar/brown sugar and I also used half margarine/half Crisco flavored butter instead of following the exact recipe.

Love these cookies. I live in Virginia, I don't know if this has anything to do with it or not, but my oven has to be on 375 degrees. For 10 minutes. I also put a big heaping scoop of Nutella in the batter. if you're short an egg and happen to have some applesauce on hand you can always use about half a cup of plain applesauce to 1 egg. Tastes like a brownie cookie. My family just devours them.

The only change I made was that I used salted butter and added no salt, and also that I didn’t have vanilla extract so that was omitted. These cookies are decadent and I haven’t had a problem with them falling flat made just as the recipe says to.

After reading other reviews, I used half butter and half shortening, as well as half white sugar and half brown sugar. 1 cup of chocolate chips was plenty. They disappeared quickly!

This is a great recipe as is. In mine I used peanut butter chips and added a dash of cream of tartar to get the extra crisp. Very tasty, thanks for sharing!

Great googly moogly, these things are the bomb!  I’ve made them six times and they always satisfy.  ??  

I follow the recipe, with the exception of using 1/4 cup  less sugar, and 1/4 cup less chips (neither were missed).

Thanks for posting this awesome recipe! ??

Came out good. I had to adjust the baking time to 5min as the bottoms were more browned than I prefer. I will probably add some instant coffee just to bring out more of the chocolate flavor, but that just my preference. Overall tasty, soft cookies!!

I love chocolate so I thought this would be a perfect cookie to make. These cookies were way too sweet for my taste. I'm not sure if reducing the sugar would make a difference but there are many other recipes to try so I would not make these again

Really good overall, but not enough salt.  I make chocolate chip cookies weekly, so when I made this recipe for a change, I noticed it didn't call for much salt (a 1/4 tsp is virtually zero for this size recipe unless you're REALLY watching your salt).  Even the standard Toll House chocolate chip cookie calls for 1 tsp salt for the same size recipe.  Also, with a little more salt you can cut the sugar substantially (by half)!  I cut the sugar by half in nearly all cookie recipes and they all turn out delicious and nobody is the wiser.  Plus in this recipe, the chocolate chips have a good amount of sugar already.  Try this recipe with 1 teaspoon salt and reduced sugar and you'll be pleasantly surprised. These cookies are also really tasty eaten right out of the freezer!  Thanks for the previous reviewers who mentioned the cook time.  Less cooking equals chewier cookies (brownie-like inside), more cook time equals crisper cookies.  Either way, they're pretty darned good.

Really great recipe. I decided to use white chocolate chips instead and it turned out great! I ed the walnuts and the flavor blended with the chocolate nicely. Over all, great recipe and highly recommend!!!

I usually try recipes the first time as written but had to make a substitute because I didn’t have enough butter.  I used 1/2 bitter & 1/2 shortening.  I shaped them into firm balls and they turned out great. A fantastic way to satisfy a chocolate craving.

This is the family's favourite cookies recipe now. So easy to make, delicious, and gives a large yield. It's a back pocket recipe for sure. Cooking them on aluminum foil makes them soft and chewy. 
Something I've noticed, if you want really gooey and soft cookies, completely melt the butter. If you want firmer cookies, let the butter softened just enough to be used.

I made these for a family lunch last weekend. Without a doubt, the best cookies I’ve ever made. They remind me a lot of the brand Grandma’s which was my absolute favorite as a kid. I can’t wait to have another reason to make these again!

I didn't put the chocolate chips in so it turned out sort of like a brownie. Bake them for 3-4 minutes longer for a firmer cookie or 9 minutes for chewy. Perfect for ice cream sandwiches!

My 10-year-old granddaughter, who knows exactly how to navigate AllRecipes, actually made these  Before I realized it, she had melted the butter instead of softening.  But they turned out as a wonderful soft chewy cookie.  I'll melt the butter everytime.!

Wow!!!  Amazing!!!  I’ve made several different chocolate cookie recipes and this one is the best!  Tips: I made EXACTLY as recipe says.  By the way (for the baking soda) 3/4 teaspoon = 1 teaspoon + 1/2 teaspoon + 1/4 teaspoon.   Also, chill the dough for 1 hr at least before baking, this will keep your cookies from being too flat.  I baked mine for 9 minutes, they looked a little underbaked when done but just trust they continue baking as they cool off....sooo good!!!!  I added Ghirardelli caramel chips to mine.   And another time I did Andes Mint chips.  Enjoy these!!!

Better than famous amous! I made changes by using only 1 egg (to make it more crispy or less chewy) and using 1 cup of granulated sugar and 1/4 cup of icing sugar.

These are great! Like a brownie and a cookie made a baby. I saw some comments that said these cookies don’t stay soft. Those people are over mixing their ingredients...that is the case for any cookie recipe. We munched on these for a week and they were still soft and delicious. My daughters are chocolate crazed little girls, and they absolutely loved these cookies.

Followedtge recipe exactly.   Came out perfect and delicious!!!   Three days later and they are still soft.  I didn’t add nuts.   Next time I’ll try reducing the sugar and a few chocolate chips just to see if I can cut some calories.

Makes a very good cookie, especially for your chocoholics.  The cocoa we used is a very rich one, so I probably should have cut back on the cocoa slightly but they were still very good.  We also used white chocolate chips for half the chips to give them  little color and we really liked the mix of flavor.

I used half butter & half butter flavored shortening, one cup sugar, (1/2 white and 1/2 brown) chilled the dough prior to baking, and cooled on paper bags to remove excess oils. These turned out wonderful. My whole family gobbled them up!

I only added 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips, used margarine instead of butter, and made tablespoon sized dollops instead of teaspoon. Because of their larger size I baked them for 15mins.

They’re gooey, chocolatey heaven in a disk shaped baked good. Little tip: (freeze for a few minutes first) chop up Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups into small chunks and mix fold them into half of the dough. For the other half I recommend Ghiradelli chocolate chips.

These cookies received an "Amazing" from my very picky 11 year old.  That is a very high award.  The only thing I did different was added chopped up Hershey easter candy so that I could get rid of it.  So, I had a mish-mash of chocolate all in it!  Very soft cookies!

These were the best cookies I've ever made. I read comments and made some slight adjustments: substituted half a cup sugar with brown sugar and used a little less white sugar than recommended, I made them relatively large (made about 15). They were nice and fluffy on the inside and just delicious!!

No changes really, just used a different ice cream scooper (the one without the release lever) and followed the recipe to the letter. Then set the timer for 8 minutes saw that they were still "raw looking" then set the timer for 4 minutes then decided to set it for 4 minutes more.  They came out tasty and crunchy. Even my husband loves them and he prefers his cookies chewy!

I’m normally not a big fan of double chocolate chip cookies but these turned out beautifully!  Followed the recipe exactly for the ingredients. Between batches, I put the dough in the fridge to help ensure that they didn’t spread and turn out flat. These were the perfect combination of height, crispy outside, and soft, chunky, chocolaty, rich inside. Using a convection oven, these took about 12 minutes to bake, two jelly roll pans at a time.  They were very fudgy and I was worried that they weren’t baked all the way through, so I let them bake a little longer than the prescribed 8-10 min.  I forgot about one tray and I left it in there for almost 15 minutes... they didn’t burn and still tasted and looked great. I can’t wait to see how people at work like them.

Delicious! Made the dough exactly as written. Varied the recipe by refrigerating the dough for 1-2 hours, per other reviews suggesting this to prevent "flat" cookies. Also, for my family's tastes, we baked them for 5:30min for the teaspoon sized cookie sizes recommended by the directions, and 7min for bigger cookies. They came out soft and wonderful.

Found it very thick, worried I would damage my kitchen aid mixer...will try again with 50% shortening...wondered if I needed 3 eggs or 2 extra large to add more liquid? Great taste but they didn’t spread out hardly at all. Followed exact recipe. Made 5 dozen cookies

I wanted to make double chocolate mint cookies because I had some leftover mint M&Ms from Christmas.  I used Tollhouse cocoa powder, and probably ended up usuing a little more than the 2/3 cup suggested.  Probably 2 TBSP additional.  The dough seemed somewhat dry but I made the cookies into more of a ball shape than just a 'drop' on the cookie sheet.  I also made them fairly large.  They turned out big and DELICIOUS!  They had a thick, rich texture and great consistency.  Delicious flavor.  I would highly recommend this recipe.  Just maybe add 1-2 extra TBSP of cocoa powder beyond what is called for in the actual recipe!  (I also backed about 12 minutes (due to the thickness), on parchment paper.)

These are great!  I followed some of the other reviews and used half shortening and half  butter.  I also used 1 teaspoon of baking soda and added 1 teaspoon of baking powder.  I used half of the sugar as white and half as brown sugar.  They are moist, tender and have a perfect chocolate flavor.  Thanks!

My 12 year old daughter found this recipe and made it.  It is fabulous.  We dropped with a small scoop - about a rounded tablespoon - not teaspoon.  Made about 46 cookies.  I am deliriously happy after one cookie, which is nice because we have no problem making gift packs!

These cookies are really delicious! After reading the reviews, I made a few changes: used 2/3 C white sugar and 3/4 C brown sugar, reduced the vanilla to 1 tsp, increased baking soda to 1 tsp and added 1 tsp baking powder.  Used 1 C white chocolate chips and 1 C semi-sweet morsels.  I did not refrigerate the dough prior to baking, only refrigerated once it was rolled into balls between baking batches (for 7 minutes on aluminum. I used a small ice cream scoop and got 57 cookies.  Thanks for a great recipe, these will be the perfect valentine's day treat!

These are so good! I followed suggestions to use 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening, then I added 1 tbls. instant espresso to the batter. Before baking I sprinkled a small pinch of course sea salt on the tops for a salted chocolate taste. They were a huge hit for Valentine's Day!

I have made this recipe twice in one week & it always gets rave reviews!!! The only thing I change is combing equal parts of white sugar & brown sugar in the hopes that it makes the cookies more moist. I roll the dough into small balls (I just eyeball them & they’re maybe like half the size of a ping pong ball?) & get cookies reminiscent (in appearance) of Mrs. Fields’ nibbler-size cookies. I love these cookies & so does everyone else who has tried them (5 family members). Thank you for sharing!!!

FANTASTIC! So gooey and perfect! We made them big and took them out after 8 minutes, so they are like super rich brownies. Used 3:1 brown to white sugar ratio.

I used half white sugar & half brown sugar & no nuts. They turned out great but we’re completely unremarkable. As crazy as it sounds they had no flavor. They tasted like chocolate chips in a flavorless cookie.

Cookie was very yummy but we only added a cup of sugar and it was too sweet even for me and I have the biggest sweet tooth. If we make it again we will probably put even less sugar.

I was halfway in to making the cookies before I realized I was out of eggs. I subbed the eggs for water, oil and baking powder and crossed my fingers. These cookies are delicious! Even without eggs! My husband loved them!

One of my favorite  cookie recipes of all time, up their with my mom's normal chocolate chip cookies, and a snickerdoodle recipe I found.  I've been making this recipe for 4-6 years now (I've lost track), and have messed it up a few times (my fault completely, thinking sugar was a dry ingredient, and misreading the amount of called for baking soda), but, spare the time I added too much baking soda, these have always turned out wonderful. My 11th grade english teacher called them "Satan cookies" back in the day for their rich, tempting flavor, and were a bigger hit than the other deserts at a beach development Summer party a few years back. I forego the salt and nuts, but keep just about everything else the same.

I used winter chips with these, a mix of mint and dark chocolate chips.  The only cocoa powder I had was dark chocolate powder.  This made very rich cookies.  I will definitely make again with different chips.

These cookies are unbelievable.  I did make one suggested change in using 3/4 c of light brown sugar and 3/4 c of white sugar (that's just mainly force of habit).  Everything else I followed to the letter.  These are so chocolatey and incredible.   For success in attaining that soft height, pop the dough in the fridge for about 10 minutes before baking.  I even put the dough back in the fridge in between batches. I'm not entirely certain as to the chemistry-based explanation, but I believe this has something to do with the consistency of the butter.  Whatever it is, it always helps me avoid those flat, melted-looking cookies.  Enjoy!!

I liked it, but, at 350 degrees for 8 -10 min or until they set, as the receipe suggests they fall apart. I baked them for 12 min at 375 as the Nestle Toll House receipe  suggests. A little crisper but hold together better. Ten seconds in the microwave will soften them up if you like a warm softer cookie. My son likes to eat them directly from the freezer.  No account for taste I guess.

Excellent, moist, easy. I highly recommend that you put in the walnuts, though, unless you're allergic. I made them without because we were taking them to a group with one allergic individual and I swear next time I'll do it this way: Make the first batch nut free, carefully set those cookies aside in a separate container so there's no cross-contamination, then mix walnuts into the rest of the dough and complete the other 3 batches with nuts. These cookies are certainly not bad without the nuts, but there's a flavor and texture component that is lacking.

I love these cookies!  Instead of the full size chocolate chips, I used the mini chips and I cut it down to a cup of the chips.  I also added a teaspoon of coffee grounds to the dough and the flavor was amazing.  I will be making these again

Fudgey, chewy, decadent, and ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I followed the recipe precisely as written, but I used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips. I also used dutch processed cocoa rather than the cheap stuff and I think it made a real difference!

Made these cookies, which were very easy, even for a professed non-baker like myself.  I subbed the chocolate chips with Andes mint chips, and used more than the two cups in the recipe (I used two whole bags) because I wanted a really minty chocolaty cookie.  I just took the first pan out of the oven, and they look (and smell) delicious. Can't wait to try them!

The batter was drier than I expected, so I started to worry. However, the finished product was awesome. I topped them with homemade whipped cream. Btw, I used 1/4 cup less sugar.

These are great! I needed a dairy free version, so I used half shortening, half margarine. I do this with other cookies and it ensures they come out nice and soft. I also followed others' recommendation to use half brown sugar and half white sugar. Turned out perfect. I will make these again!

Exceptional cookie recipe!  I like my cookies a little softer and learned years ago that you can adjust the amount of white and brown sugar as long as the total stays the same. I used 1/2 c white sugar and 1 c brown sugar and they were nice and chewy! Great recipe!

This is a very good recipe -- I've made it twice and will make it many more times!!!  The only changes I made were that I used 3/4 c. white sugar + 3/4 c brown sugar; 1 Tbsp vanilla extract; dutch processed cocoa powder and 1 tsp baking soda.  I also used semi-sweet chocolate chips and white chocolate chips.  I used to make double chocolate chips with Duncan Hines cake mix, but these cookies are -- by far -- better, with the added bonus that I don't have to wonder what unpronounceable additives are int them!  Thanks for sharing.

I thought these were great! Super chocolatey. I replaced 3/4 C flour with oats for texture, and rather than nuts I added flaked coconut. Next time I will make according to recipe, but add 1/2 peanut butter chips! I baked at 325 for 15 minutes--perfect.

Yum!!!! Only changes I made were adding about a tablespoon of Trader Joe's 100% Colombian Instant Coffee and refrigerating the dough for a couple hours before baking.  Perfect little bites of chocolateness!  (Might use my larger cookie scoop next time though)

Delicious,  rich, and moist. Based on other reviews I used half butter and half shortening. I also split the sugar half and half white and brown. I would definitely make these again.

These are a chocolate lovers dream cookie. I have made them 6 times. The last batch I used an electric mixer for mixing the butter, eggs, sugar, and vanilla. Mixed on a slow speed for about 5 or 6 minutes. It really made a fluffy base for the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt. It gave the cookies a lighter texture with a smooth finish. That melt in your mouth feel. Ingredient quantities are perfect. Thank you Kathy for a great recipe.

These turned out great. My only problem---I put them in the frig for the time suggested, but they didn't drop at all after about 7 minutes. I just pushed them down with a spoon, cook for an additional 3 minutes and they were perfect.

I LOVE double chocolate cookies, but it has been awhile since I've tried a new recipe.  I made this recipe with only minor changes and they came out awesome! Kept the recipe the same, except I used mini semi-sweet chocolate chips  and per the one reviewer's suggestion, I refrigerated the dough for 1 hour (except I refrigerated the entire covered mixing bowl, not trays of prepared cookie balls).  I then scooped the dough with a 1" scoop and then lightly rolled the balls of dough in a bowl of granulated sugar.       
Still baked them at same temp, but for 12 minutes, checking them at the 10 minute mark.  Let them cool on trays for 5 minutes and then transferred to racks.  They kept a beautiful rounded shape and were perfectly soft (but done) in the middles.  Also, this batch produced 36 cookies with the 1" scoop.  Will definitely be baking these again!!!

These are teally good. Perfect at 8 minutes. They are super chocolatey. I made recipe exactly the same just added 1 whole cup of walnuts instead of 1/2 cup. You don't need to change anything.

These were pretty great!  
I added a TSP of almond extract and it was wonderful. Next time I will eliminate the vanilla and use 2 TSP of almond extract and maybe add some chopped up candied cherries if I have them on hand.

Everyone loves these cookies! Only thing I did different was add some Butterfinger pieces. So good I only have 7 cookies left because everyone that tried one had to try at least 3 more to make sure they were really that good, lol.

So good! I used half semisweet chocolate chips and half dark chocolate chips. I also used half white sugar and had brown sugar, but I do this for all cookies that  call for just white sugar. They're very rich so I think it will take me and my partner a while to eat these but I don't mind because they're so good.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I did only bake them for 9 minutes, not longer as the recipe indicated.  These cookies were oh so good..tasted much like a rich brownie....but better!!  I am Bringng them to a group of friends tonight and I'll bet they will be devoured.  I will keep these on my go to list when I want a yummy chocolate cookie!  Plus I'll bet they freeze well.

Great cookie! I chilled the dough about 45 minutes before scooping out and baking, which kept them on the puffier side. These taste like a cross between a cookie, a brownie and a truffle...delicious! I will def be making this one again~YUM!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

I use room temperature eggs and butter. I cream the butter first until it is a light pale yellow. Then I mix in the sugar. Also avoid overmixing the batter to prevent tough dense cookies. I use a silpat mat to prevent cookies sticking when baked. Excellent chocolatey cookies!

I have made these cookies twice now. I have a dairy allergy so we used Smart Balance and Nature's Balance for butter and the first time I used enjoy life mini chips- I don't suggest mini chips if you want the chocolate chip crunch because they seemed to mostly melt by the time they were cooked. The second batch we made 12 huge cookies by using a large scoop and cooking about 5 minutes longer. These are so soft and will definitely satisfying chocolate lovers!

After reading a lot of reviews, I made this using 1/2 tsp. of salt and 1 tsp. of baking soda. All else was the same. These cookies are wonderful. The next day they were still soft. Great with a glass of milk.

These cookies turned out great! Instead of white sugar, I used brown sugar and also replaced all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour. I also used unsweetened cocoa powder. I don't know if the substitutions are made any difference, but the cookies were the perfect amount of sweetness- not too overwhelming. I baked them in the oven for about 9 minutes and it left the cookies super chewy in the inside but crunchy on the outside.

Wow love this recipe. These are the best cookies u have ever made. They came out soft and chewy and we're absolutely delicious warmed up or strait out of the oven. The chocolate melts in your mouth like there's no tomorrow. Total win. Strongly recommend.

The cookies were great,the only change I made was I used less chocolate chips, and cooked them 15 minutes instead of 10, because I found my cookies weren't cooked all the way through. Any one craving chocolate chip cookies should totally try these cookies. I will definitely be making them again. ;)

These taste great, but are not as thin as they appear in the picture. I think I'd try half butter, half shortening next time, and maybe half white, half brown sugar next time.

These are more of a shortbread style cookie. Cooked first batch for the exact time given & 2nd batch less, but they both turned hard upon cooling. Taste is good, but not a soft chewy cookie at all.

I really like how these cookies stay moist and they mix well. However the cookie itself doesn't seem to be sweet so when making I personally suggest adding more sugar or maybe adding extra chocolate chips. I did white and milk chocolate because I like my cookies to be sweet not bitterish

Delicious, I only made 1 change. I used 1/2 cake flour and 1/2 regulars flour because I'm trying to use up my cake flour! They were great!

Perfect! We didn't have any brown sugar, so this worked perfectly! I did use margarine instead of butter, but it still tasted awesome! Turned out a bit cakey-er than expected, but that's not necessarily a bad thing!

A fabulous cookie! I used white chocolate chips and no nuts. These cookies turned out great! Very fudge and soft - I baked for about 12 minutes at 350.

This recipe turned out GREAT ! So many people have told me how great they taste and, I think they taste great myself. One thing I do differently is let the dough chill in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. That causes the dough to become more firm and the cookies come turn out soft and fluffy. They don't flatten out.

I made them starting exactly how said in the instructions but the batter won't flatten when baking, only sit as globs which won't bake in the middle. I tried turning up the heat (to 360)  so the middles bake then left them in for about 5 more minutes. Didn't help at all. I'm very disappointed, maybe im just bad at making cookies.

Love this recipe, the only changes I make are adjusting the sugar to 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white, and using white, milk and dark chocolate chips. Delicious! Just made my second batch in as many days as they keep disappearing!

Amazing and very chocolaty cookies!! Coworkers, friends, family loved these! Nice and soft and the chocolate wasn't overboard. I used half brown and white sugar as I saw in some other recipes I really liked. I also used some white chocolate chips along with dark for some variety which was good, but some people thought they were macadamia nuts (doesn't matter to me though :P). I also made some with mini-eggs instead of chocolate chips and these were fantastic and a favorite by most that tried both.

These are very good. Made just as recipe stated. Only slight change I made was after baking about 1/2 of dough, I decided to add about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of almond extract. I thought it helped the flavor even more. Will make again!

The dough got super dry right when I added the cocoa powder so I ended up using 3 eggs instead of 2, but they turned out great anyways! :)

PLEASE READ AS I TWEAKED THE RECIPIE AND IT MAY HELP YOU! -- Rather suprised that these turned out AMAZING despite all the substituitions i had to make.. I added 1/2 cup brown sugar ( didn't even have brown sugar so i just added molasses to castor! ) and normal castor for the remaining 1 cup. I used around 30g of margarine as other reviews said that it made the cookies firmer and not spread out ( and remaing 200g with salted butter ).
 Since the batter is brown( choc ) its difficult to know when they are done so you have to take them out and check and put em back. WHEN THEY COME OUT OF THE OVEN THEY WILL BE SOFT DO NOT WORRY LEAVE THEM TO COOL AND THEY WILL HARDEN AND BECOME NICE AND CHEWY!!! 
I also didn't have any chocolate chips so I used Lindt 70% chocolate in chunks, great but 1) i made the chunks to big 2) its quite a bitter chocolate so I wish I had milk or white chocolate to balance it out.

Absolutely delicious.  I used half shortening, half butter, and half brown sugar and half white sugar, with large Ghirardelli chips.  So so good - very rich, almost sinful!

I made these and immediately baked them. They are really really good although I thought I would taste more chocolate. I honestly think these taste just like chocolate chip cookies with food coloring. Highly recommend to try, just don't expect an extra extra taste of chocolate. I will be making these again!

This has become the cookie I'm known for. I make it more than any other cookie recipe I have. My one big alteration is to leave out the baking soda. It just means it doesn't puff up into an airy cookie. Instead it stays more the consistency of a brownie. People rave about this cookie, weeks, even months after having it. It's become the number one request for me to bake. It's also good slightly undercooked, to make it even a bit more like a brownie. Other reviewers have said it doesn't stay soft. I find that it does without the baking soda. Also, I use the age old trick of putting a slice of bread in my cookie containers if the cookies are going to be in there more than 2 days. I don't know why it works, but it does. Cookies stay soft, bread gets hard.

Made like previous baker suggested & I used 3/4 c. brown sugar, 3/4 c. white.   And, 1/2 c.  shortening & 1/2 c. butter.  I ran out of choc. chips, so I used 1 cup of white choc. chips & 1 c. of semi-sweet choc chips.  Yum!!   Hubby said "These are great, just like I like them...soft, chewy & very chocolatey!!"  I SHOULD'VE DOUBLED this recipe tho... as they will disappear FAST!!

For some reason my batter turned out a little too stiff so I added another egg yolk. I also followed the advice and used half brown sugar and half white.   I used a large cookie scoop, and the  cookies turned out great.   They are as good if not better than the ones sold at Arby's.   I will definitely be making them again.

I made a batch of these today.  The only changes I made were:
Used salted caramel chips, and pecans.  I used a large cookie scoop and got 24 cookies  that I baked for 15 minutes at 350.  I also shaped them into balls after scooping them.  They turned out crispy around the edges and soft in the middle.  Very tasty!  Definitely a keeper!

5 stars for the taste. These are one of the most delicious chocolate cookies I ever had. I followed the recipe exactly, including the walnuts. I chilled in the fridge for about 30 minutes before baking, to make sure the cookies won't be flat. To my surprise, they barely changed shape, from a ball to a dome ! I let the 2nd batch stay on the kitchen counter to come to room temperature and then flattened the cookie balls little, before baking and again they barley spread ! But, they were less thick this time. And, BTW, I keep the cookie dough in the fridge and just bake a dozen at the time, for 2 to 3 days and shape the rest of the dough into balls and freeze.

Made with Salted Caramel chips.  Saw new flavor of chips in the store and they just called out for a nice chocolate cookie to go into.  Left out the nuts (since I'm allergic).  Big hit at home and at work.

These cookies are FANTASTIC! I make them with Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder so they are especially rich, which helps to balance out the sweetness. I have heard only good things about these cookies, and they are always a hit at parties! They're super easy to make, and this recipe is an easy way to spruce up the basic chocolate chip cookie. No matter how many times I make this recipe, I still love it :)

I made this recipe with my mom! Instead f all white sugar, I did one cup of white, and 1/2 cup of dark brown. We did use all butter and the cookies were chewy and nicely mounded.  We did both regular and white chips, and they were so good! We also melted some white chocolate chips  to drizzle over top, and they look really cool! These are a new family favorite and we shall make them again!!!

Sweet dose, but that's ok! I added 1/2 cup chopped maraschino cherries b/c my son's fav is chocolate-cherry. 
Next time I am going to try halving the vanilla and substituting cherry extract for the remainder.

These cookies are great for adults (not overly sweet) and serious chocoholics of all ages.

I did use 3/4 cup light brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar instead of the 1 1/2 cups of white sugar. I also added 1/2 tsp of espresso powder to intensify the chocolate taste. Other than that, I made these as the recipe directs. I'm sure they would be very good even without these modifications, though.

I'm giving these 4 stars instead of 3 because when they came out of the oven, they were incredible! They were like little cookie brownie bites and they were to die for. My husband and I immediately went for a big glass of milk after half a cookie. With that being said, they didn't hold up well. They didn't dry out or lose the chewiness, but they fell apart within two days. I had hundreds of cookie crumbles instead of whole cookies, which is really disappointing, especially since one of the reasons I bake is to send dessert in my step sons lunch. I do tend to like my cookies slightly undercooked and while it isn't usually a problem, it could've been for these, so when I try them again I'll keep them in the oven longer. Other than that, they tasted great!

I really enjoyed these. They were soft and chewy and they were pretty thick. I followed the recipe, and they turned out great. I didn't have chocolate chips at my house at the time, but they were still delicious even without them! 100% would recommend and will make again

These cookies were amazing! However, even though I placed them on the tray as teaspoon balls, they flattened and spread out quite a bit a few minutes into baking. If you don't want such flat cookies, a quick fix is to first place your teaspoon sized balls on your cookie sheets, then refrigerate them for about 20 minutes. When you are ready to bake, take it out of the refrigerator and into the oven they go! That way, your cookies will have more shape and have better texture.

They were delicious, but not my favourite. Maybe that's because of the fact that I don't care for chocolate... Hmm.

Delicious cookies! Along with a lot of the reviewers; whenever a cookie recipe calls for only butter, I cut it in a half with shortening. I also use half brown sugar and half white.  Other than that, these cookies are always requested at gatherings and get rave reviews!

They were too chocolaty for me.  I replaced half of the cocoa powder with powdered milk and added peanut butter chips.  They were yummy.

My family loves these cookies! They are the best! Sometimes I use a little bit of brown sugar in place of some of the white sugar, but not always. This is my go-to cookie recipe when someone wants cookies. My husband asks me to make these almost every week, and my kids can't get enough! Sometimes I use butterscotch chips or white chocolate chips and they still taste marvelous. Make sure you store them in an airtight container. This prevents them from becoming too hard.

These cookies were excellent! They got a little flat, but not completely flat. They were really tasty. I planned on following some of the reviews, but forgot, so I made them exactly as the recipe described and thought they came out great! I did leave out the nuts (picky kids), and I always add a bit more flour when I leave out the nuts. Good recipe!!

These are awesome, chewy little cookies! I did use half brown sugar, and refrigerated the dough for an hour before scooping. But I'm sure they'd be just as good with all white sugar. My new favorite cookie.

I had a serious chocolate craving and picked these out. So glad I did, they were amazing.  I added a small splash of liquid egg white, a sprinkle of cinnamon and about a cup of  small diced cream cheese. Fridge temperature seems to work, and put the cheese in last. Definitely will make these again!!!

This will be on my favorite list of cookies.  They were absolutely fabulous.  Only change I made was half butter and half shortening, took Diane's suggestion and the texture, etc. were perfection.

I rated this a 4 as I did modify the recipe as per other reviewers but I will say this cookie delivered everything I wanted.  Crispy outside and soft and moist inside.  The only modifications I made were to use margarine instead of butter ( I didn't have any on hand) and I also used half brown sugar and half white.  As stated by other reviewers I believe the success of this recipe lays in the proper mixing of butters with sugars and the stirring by hand when adding the dry ingredients.  Definitely making these again!!

Let me preface by saying while I absolutely LOVE cooking, baking does not come as easily for me. That being said, I cannot recommend this recipe enough! I followed the instructions exactly as intended (though I did chill the dough for a bit due to my kitchen being warm) and was thrilled with the results! The cookies are perfectly chocolately, and stayed soft. These are super easy and I was able to make them no problem in my tiny NYC apartment kitchen. This was the first recipe that came up when I googled double chocolate cookies, and I am so thankful it did!

Everything you ever want in a chocolate cookie!  Deeply chocolate, slightly chewy, barely crisp on the edges -- addictive!  The cocoa makes them super easy -- no melting chocolate. My kids and husband (and everyone else who's tried them) loves them!  Do let them set up on the cookie sheet.  I find I need to bake a minute or two longer than called for.

Very soft and chocolaty cookies. I did make one small change after the first tray by tripling the size of each cookie (1 rounded teaspoon -> 1 rounded tablespoon) and baked them for 11 minutes which seemed to keep them from drying out for much longer. I also used fancy cocoa which helped the chocolate flavor and gave a decent aftertaste. Next time I'll add a small amount of cayenne or habanero pepper to help balance the sweet, pair with the chocolate, and provide an even better aftertaste. 

Overall, they came out to be the best double chocolate chip cookies I've made and will gladly use this recipe in the future.

I used half brown sugar and half granulated. I felt this added a bit more depth the the flavor. Cookies were perfectly chocolatey and not too overwhelming! I was skeptical before I made these, but so happy I did. The cookies did not last long!

These are delicious if you like a chewy, gooey cookie. The chocolate flavor is wonderful. I split this recipe in half, because I think that 24 cookies is a lot to keep in my house -- I'd eat them all!  I didn't refrigerate these, and they turned out just fine -- not flat at all. I had to bake my cookies for much more than 10 minutes in order to gain the texture I wanted, though. (I probably baked my cookies for about 25-30 minutes.) They're perfect to serve to guests, as well.  I LOVE THESE COOKIES!

Oh my goodness!!! These are the best cookies ever!! I followed the recipe to the T. I would suggest baking them for 9 min. MAX. they may still look gooey, but once they're cooled, they are the perfect texture!!! 
thanks for sharing!!!

Pretty good recipe. I used dark brown sugar which made them chewy and almost cake like which wasn't too bad. I've made them with and with and without the chocolate chips and they come out great either way.

These are some AMAZING cookies!!! Everyone that has ever tried one has usually come back for about 6 more! No joke at all!! The dough is so addicting I have ended up with a stomach ache before the cookies are even in the oven! I've never used nuts, and they bake to perfection in exactly 9 minutes every time for me. Also, I like to do at least 50% of the chocolate chips white (or using all white chocolate chips instead of regular works great too!) I've found that it makes the cookies pop and look more attractive. Hershey's dark chocolate cacao powder also takes these up a notch-- especially if you love dark chocolate. The shade of brown goes up about 10x. Thanks for this recipe!!!! All time favorite at my house!

Wonderful! I was hesitant about making home made cookies (I've only recently started to do more home-cooking instead of pre-made dough, and the like), but these were easy to do and tasty! 

The only change I made was something a few other people had done, 3/4 white sugar and 3/4 brown sugar.

I will definitely make it again! So, so, so good. I made it for my family and everyone gave it a thumbs up. It taste like a brownie cookie. I used milk chocolate chips which are great if you like your cookies sweet. I also only made 3 dozen because I made them bigger. Great if you love chocolate and more chocolate, and even more chocolate.

I made a half recipe of these following the ingredients and directions. No substitutions. No changes. Baked mine for 8 to 9 minutes and yielded half the original recipe so the cookie size is probably about the same as original. Bake time seems accurate. We think they are quite good.  We like the texture.  Not too cake-like and not too fudge-like.  Cookies spread only a little so we have a nice small, thick, chocolatey, nutty cookie.  2 days later, cookies remain soft and delicious. ETA: I did chill batter before and during baking.

These cookies are AMAZING! I followed other suggestions and refrigerated the dough for about an hour. I used dark chocolate chips which are my favorite. The cookies didn't flatten at all. Thanks for sharing!

These cookies are so good.   I made them for a cookie bake off and won first place out of 12 other kinds!  I did make some changes as others suggested, such as using half butter flavored shortening and half butter, as well as using half brown sugar and half white sugar.   I also ended up baking them for 7.5 mins and they came out perfect, more than that and the bottoms started to blacken a bit, not sure if this is just my oven though.  They stayed soft and chewy for days in an airtight container.   Next time I want to use peanut butter chips or white chips instead of chocolate and see how they turn out!  Great cookies.

These are very good, but I added a cherry on top and drizzled melted chocolate over that. They were a hit with the family and friends. Be sure to add these items before you bake.  It's very reminiscent of brownies, but the cherry adds a nice addition to it!!!!

These cookies turned out pretty good. I altered the recipe by adding coconut flakes and raisins to add more flavor. They are delicious. And they make a great amount of cookies. I will definitely make these again.

Followed recipe, used all butter. They retained their shape and did not turn out flat, as others said. They are not as chewy as brownies, but softer, melt in your mouth centers with slightly crispy exterior. Wonderful!

My preteen daughter made this just as directed and they were amazing! Super easy and great as is. No modifications were necessary. Be careful not to overtake these. They look half done, but firm up perfectly as they cool. These will be made again and again. Ummmmm.

I made these with scharffenberger Cocoa and guittard chocolate chips, and they were to die for! I put the dough in the fridge for 15mins before baking and they baked into perfectly round and puffed cookies.

Very good little cookie. I used all butter, stayed true to recipe as printed , didn't refrigerate the dough before baking and the cookies didn't flatten. They taste similar to brownies. Will be making these again. I may try the brown sugar next time but for the rating and review I wanted to make as printed.

I exchanged some of the ingredients for example I put a quarter cup of brown sugar and deleted a quarter cup of the white sugar .  I also exchanged a half a cup of the Whiteflower out for gluten-free flour . I added white chocolate chips pecans chocolate chunks and Garrett deli  dark chocolate chips.  I really love the flavor it's not too sweet and is very gooey inside !

Made half a batch as written and refrigerated the dough overnight to freshly bake in the morning. Uses all simple ingredients and comes together so easily. Very delicious, and perfect as written. I might experiment with half brown sugar next time though.

A real winner. When I make these I usually add a few less chocolate chips than called for. Personal preference. The full amount of chocolate chips gives you almost more chocolate than cookie. Which is yummy, but I prefer a bit more cookie with my chocolate ;)

We make these in double batches and freeze them.  They still never last long. I use a quarter bag each of white, semi sweet, and milk chocolate chips. But tonight, i will be adding some butterscotch chips in!!

Awesome recipe for a chocoholic!!   I did change it up some.  I used half margarine/half shortening like many others, but also went with real chocolate chips instead of semi sweet....melt in your mouth goodness!

These were great. Very easy and the cocoa hid the taste of whole grain wheat flour, whole soybean flour and whole grain oat flour. We even added chia in at the end. Tasted a bit crunchy in texture but was fantastic otherwise. Will definetly make again. W convinced me to make these and really liked them even with chopped walnuts. Not too chocolately at all.

Wasn't too fond of this. I found the cookies to be a little too dry and hard for my taste. They were not very moist nor soft. I am experienced in baking so it was not human error or lack of following direction. Unfortunately I will not be making these again.

I used half and half white and brown sugar, as others suggested. I'm not sure if it made a difference since I didn't try the original but these were fantastic!  I made them for my picky boyfriend and he couldn't stop raving about these being the best cookies he ever had!

I just made these cookies, and my whole family can't leave them alone. They are delicious. 

My only mods are: I increased the salt to 3/4 tsp for my preference. Also added 2 tsp of hot water to the dough when mixing in the chips, as the dough was very stiff.  I live at 4300 feet elevation, so I baked these at 380 for 10 min and they came out perfectly.

These are great cookies! First batch I would have given a 4, but I made a couple of tweaks and 2nd batch is a 5 for sure! Changes I made were I used butter flavored crisco in place of half the butter, used double the vanilla extract, and replaced half the white sugar with light brown sugar. I also used 60% cacao  chips. Result was a delicious dark chocolate soft cookie that wasn't too sweet and for days after, just gets better instead of drying out. They tasted even more like a store bought soft cookie 3 days after baking. I also froze the pre-scooped cookie dough so I could make cookies as we wanted them and they even turned out great!

Soooo delicious and sinful!!  I used semi sweet chips but next time I may try milk chocolate. They have an intense grown up flavor and not too sweet. I didn't change anything and they are  nice and tall, not flat.  I added chopped pretzels to half the mix..so good, adds a salty kick that pairs well with the chocolate.  Very great recipe..a keeper! Thanks.

I love making these! My whole family loves them. One thing that I do is I take them out when only  the top part of the cookie is hard when the rest is doughy. And than I let it cook on the pan for about 3-5 minutes. This lets the cookies to still be moist and chewy!

My niece made these amazing cookies for our Christmas gathering. She said the only change she made was to do 1 cup semi and 1 cup milk on the chocolate. And only bake for 8 min to stay soft. They melt in your mouth, very velvety creamy texture. The flavor was perfection. Everyone said they were the best cookies ever.

After trying several other double chocolate chip recipes and being dissatisfied with the results, I finally stumbled onto this recipe. Perfect! I use this recipe with  different flavor-filled chocolate chips; it's especially delicious with mint, caramel, or raspberry filled ones. These cookies will dry out if you do not keep them in an airtight container, however.

Delicious! I also tried these using mint extract instead of vanilla (and omitted the nuts) and they were amazing. Perfect level of sweetness and chocolate flavourful.

Followed the recipe and it came out as advertised. They're soft and delicious, although they were a little hard to shape. "Reindeer turds" are now a part of our family's Christmas cookie tradition.

Great. I changed a couple things. Did 1 cup of white chocolate chips, and 1 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. And I also changed the sugar to 1 cup of white sugar, and 1/2 cup of brown sugar to give it a more chewy soft finish. 

Turned out perfect

These are such a good cookie!! Everyone who has tried them, loves them! The recipe calls for a lot of cocoa, but it's well worth it. And if you make small cookies, the recipe really goes far! Try them!! You won't regret it!

These are a favorite at our house! So delicious! Rich and just the right amount of salty with the chocolate. I made them again last night and my husband was in heaven all over again. We leave the walnuts out.

Excellent cookie. The only change I made was 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1teaspoon of almond. The hint of almond complimented the chocolate.

These are so soft and better than bakery! I did half butter and half shortening like someone else suggested and they did stay nice and round ! Not flat at all. Unbelievable great. I used one cup chocolate chips and the other white.

House smells heavenly!!!!  Waiting for cookies to cool because they are very soft and hot right now.  I did 1/2 butter/1/2 shortening as usual.  Also 1c sugar and 3/4c Stevia. Instead of choc chips, I used a frozen milk choc Easter Rabbit, rough chopped and DARK cocoa powder. It is still the same recipe, but with my usual "tweaking".  Very stiff dough, so added 1 tbsp cold coffee also.  The dough tasted so good!  Thanks for this great recipe!

these are sooooo good. it was super messy to mix (should of used a bigger bowl) but they're worth it.  I used less chocolate chips and topped them with marshmallows in the last few minutes in the oven.

Even though I didn't chill the dough for one of the batches, it was the same as one of the batches I had chilled.
The cookies got slightly burnt at the bottom even though I 
had kept it in for exactly 8 mins.
Taste was good even though I didn't use shortening and actually, I had used 1/2 salted butter and 1/2 unsalted butter without adding salt separately because I didn't have enough unsalted butter

I love this double chocolate chocolate chip recipe! My only complaint is I find it a little rich and would cut back on the chocolate chips.

They are good, and my chocolate loving daughter is a big fan. Although, I agree with some of the other reviews (I made the recipe as is) and they are really, really sweet. After the first batch I was already planning to have the kids share them with our neighbors as 1-2 is about all you can eat before it's a sugar overload.

Delish! Perfect chocolaty cookie.  I'm usually terrible at making cookies, but this was soft and raise perfectly. I used someone's suggestion of half margarine and half shortening.  I'm so proud!  Great recipe!! Thanks.

Made the recipe exactly as written. Cookies turned out great and were a big hit! Everyone wanted the recipe! I made the batter a day ahead and refrigerated overnight. Some reviewers mentioned the cookies being dried out by the next day...I did not find this to be true. The cookies still taste great 2 days after being baked!

They turned out wonderful! Not only are they delicious, but they look delicious too! I did alter the recipe a bit by cutting down on the butter and sugar. This lack of liquid was covered by a few teaspoons of milk. I displaced the chocolate chips with the walnuts too. Overall, a great recipe that everyone loved!

My granddaughter & I made these and we LOVED them!  I did as so many others suggested, using half butter & half shortening and (with a halved recipe) used 1/4 c brown sugar, 1/2 cup regular.  Ours required no refrigeration, baked up beautifully in 9 minutes, and had just the right amount of chocolaty flavor.  Thanks so much for recipe!

Loved the cookies. I used white chocolate chips because I was out of chocolate chips and I left out the nuts. I was worried they wouldn't be done but they were and they were delicious. I had no problem with the cookies rising or sticking. Great recipe, will make again and again.

I like nice chunky cookies so I used half butter half shortening to minimize spreading. I didn't want those to be too sweet like some reviewers said so I only used 1 cup white sugar and half brown. These are the best.

these cookies are amazing. so sweet and chocolatey. I baked them a little too long and my cookies turned a bit hard. just remember not to over-bake them. these cookies are a little too sweet for me, I think I'll reduce the amount of sugar I use next time. but still, this is the best chocolate cookie recipe I've ever tried.

I think the people who gave it bad reviews must have done something wrong. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out great. I would make again, maybe with white chocolate chips next time.

The only adjustment we made to the recipe was using dark chocolate chips instead and that really set them off perfectly in my opinion. I made these for myself and for friends for Yule and they were so well received we're making them again already.

These cookies are perfect. Just what I was looking for... a chocolate drop cookie with real chocolate flavor. I couldn't bring myself to add 2 cups of chocolate chips... I used only 1 cup of chips and no one complained. Yummy.

Love these cookies! Well, they just came out of the oven, but I am sure I will love them in a day or two as well. (doubt they'll last that long!). They were easy and I had most ingredients on hand, Only had a cup of milk choc chips so I used half a semi sweet bakers bar chopped up. Also a cup butter and a cup shortening. They are so good, flat, gooey and chocolaty! Exactly they way I like them! The old mans gonna be so happy when he gets home! (again, if there are any left!) Thanks for sharing

Mega yummy. I chilled the dough for 30-40 minutes as suggested by reviewers. I also did 50/50 brown to white sugar. Really, really good.

Tried the recipe but I reduce the sugar to 1 cup instead of 1 1/2 cup. I prefer not too sweet. And I add almond instead of chestnut. Easy to made and it's taste fantastic.

These cookies really depend on your oven, and they are meant to be big cookies. I tried to make them bite sized, and they didn't spread. You really also want to make them room temp before baking. They were great, and not too much chocolate (which i don't like a lot of chocolate). I do recommend the walnuts, as they add a great texture!!

Great recipe though it was a little too sweet. I've reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cup instead and it came out perfect. Great texture, slight crunch on the outside and chewy on the inside. Just the way a soft cookie should be.

Awesome fudginess right out of the oven!  I did adjust but only out of necessity - I was short on butter by 1/2 cup so I only used 3/4 cup of butter but I figured it wouldn't matter because I always have to reduce butter so my cookies don't come out flat (must be my oven).  And I used white chocolate chip because that's what I had - these cookies were soft, chewy, not flat & yummy!

Yummy! I added white chocolate chips, skipped the nuts and used a gluten free flour mix so I could send the cookies to my kids school. They were a huge hit!

I was looking for a plain chocolate drop cookie recipe so I left out the chips and nuts. They were perfect. Beautiful cracked top, tender and chocolaty in the center, not too sweet.I used lard instead of butter and used equal parts almond extract and vanilla. Easy and delicious!

Love these cookies and my family is now officially addicted to them!  It seems like a bit of an injustice to simply call them cookies - they're more like brownies in the body of a cookie.
Underbake them a bit, for best results.....

Halved the recipe- and used 2 parts white sugar, one part brown.  I also used half mint chips, half regular.  In short, awesome, crave-able, not too sweet.  Delicious!

Super delicious! Did half white sugar half brown. Had to refrigerate the batter for about a half-hour so I could work with it otherwise it was way too sticky. Came out perfect texture and were not flat.

Just WOW. 

I used the following suggestions from other reviewers:

1/2 c of extra flour, instead of all white sugar I put: 3/4 c brown sugar (level, not packed) and a little less than 3/4 cup white sugar, a full tsp baking soda. I added 1 tsp of instant coffee granules (dissolved in a tiny bit of water) with the vanilla. I refrigerated the dough for about an hour.

A little improv of my own: I separated the dough and made 1/2 with mint chocolate chips and 1/2 with semi-sweet chocolate chips so that we had some variety.  I did not use a full 2 cups of chocolate chips. I am glad I didn't, because they would have been too sweet for us. Next time I will put more walnuts than the recipe calls for! 


They came out perfect: soft, moist, rich, like brownie bites - but not too sweet. This is going in the family recipe book :)


Edit: Still making these when I need a fail proof cookie. Yesterday I made them exactly as above but replaced the vanilla with 1/2 T almond, 1/2 T maple extract and they were fantastic. I did half the batch with semi-sweet chips and walnuts, and half with butterscotch chips and peanuts. Amazing.

I make these often, they are excellent! Sometimes I add pecans instead of walnuts! They're very soft when you take them out, don't overbake them and they'll stay moist. Just let them cool off for a long time and they won't fall apart!

I've used the recipe a few times.  This time I used mint chocolate chips instead of the regular chocolate chips & left out the nuts.  Boy-o-boy! They taste just like girl scout thin mint cookies. I'm sure I'll be making them again.  Soon!

I adore this recipe! Really easy to customize to anything you want.  I substituted an avocado for a stick of butter and it made it very creamy on the inside while still being crispy on the outside.  I also used Andes chocolate mint bits instead of chocolate chips, and it gives this such a nice touch.  I highly recommend this!

This recipe lives up to its name! Oh so yummy! I'm at day three and they are still scrumptious... Maybe even better than day 1. The ingredients may be too much for some because they are so rich, but my husband and I loved them! We uses them for a thanksgiving dinner and guests loved them! 

I followed the recipe with these exceptions: I used one stick of butter and one stick of margarine ( bc I ran low on butter). I used pecans because that's what I had in the pantry. And I let the dough sit in the fridge for one hour- this allowed the dough to RISE. I was impressed at how this trick works (followed tip from a fellow reviewer).

Thank you for sharing this recipe, I will use again and again!!! 
:)

I loved these I actually lost my recipe for mine and decided to try this one. It was really good and I didn't have to change it too much, the only thing I did differently is melt the butter alittle so it would be more fudgey like brownies and put a bit more flour in like I do with my old recipe.  My only regret is not making a double batch!

I loved this recipe!! They did not last long in my house. The only change I made was I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 granulated sugar. Next time I make it I will use even less. They were very chocolatey and really don't need much added sweetness.

I wanted a chewy chocolate cookie base for some mint chocolate chips that I had on hand. These seem good, the results taste a lot like a mint chocolate cookie you might get from Girl Guides/Girl Scouts. I only altered it slightly, as a few comments had suggested. I used 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup loosely packed brown sugar, 1 tsp instant coffee, and 1 tsp baking powder. I also used my electric mixer to beat it at multiple stages, to keep it fluffy, and chilled it a couple hours in the fridge.

These cooked in 9 minutes in my oven. DO NOT be afraid to take them out when they are still soft to the touch. They continue baking for 2-3 minutes on the pan before you remove them to a wire rack. I was worried that mine were still raw, but they firmed up perfectly after cooling. 

Overall, they are yummy and seem to be still chewy the next day. I think next time I might up the cocoa powder and reduce the sugar slightly, but that's just personal preference -- I like a rich, dark chocolate flavour, rather than a very sweet cookie.

These were great cookies! The only thing I changed was the sugar. Instead of 1 1/2 cups of white sugar I used 1 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown. I used a small cookie scoop and baked them for 8 minutes. Will definitely make these again!

These are my family's and boyfriend's favourite cookies now (and are now nic-named PMS cookies as they are so chocolate-y). I would like to try mixing the chocolate chips with white or peanut butter chips in one of my next recipes.  I have also found that I need to keep them in the oven for a few extra minutes, but it may just be the way my oven is.

Best cookies ever!!!!  Absolutely delicious!!

I did tweak it a little the second time I made them! I added a little bit of half and half (it made the dough gooey but not to gooey before baking) and I added 3/4 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1/4 mini reg. chocolate chips! Everyone at work absolutely loved them!

The next time I make them I may try adding a few white chocolate chips!

I am obviously a chocolate lover. ;) However, I am not as big on nuts so I didn't add those either time! I'll try and attach a photo if I think to take one the next time!!

This is my absolute go-to double chocolate chip recipe! I always get tons of compliments on it, and it gets two thumbs up from my brother, who's not a huge dessert person. I always almost completely melt my butter for extra chewiness, and that might be why I find this recipe not quite dry enough. A quick fix for this is to dip your spoon into flour before scooping out cookie dough. :) Go ahead, try to stop at just one!

Made these exactly as directed and they were very good, just like a brownie in cookie form.

Love, love, love! Easy to make. I didn't use walnuts, didn't chill the dough, and they turned out amazing. I like that they don't flatten like most my chocolate chip cookie recipes do.

The best cookie I have made.  I used Stevia instead of sugar and organic cacao powder.  Amazing chocolate goodness.

Fabulous!  Exactly what I was looking for!  Super soft and gooey.  As with any cookie recipe that calls for butter as it's fat, be sure to refrigerate dough for at least an hour before baking and throughout the handling process.  Followed recipe exactly...cookies are still soft and scrumptious 3 days later.  Baked for 10 min in my oven and came out perfect.

I exchanged 1/2 cup of sugar for a 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I also only had just over a 1/4 tsp of vanilla, and used 1 cup of milk chocolate chips and 1 cup of Andes Mint chunks.... Had to bake for 14 minutes but turned out AMAZING!!! Crispy bottoms and chewy inside.

Hands down THE BEST cookies I've ever made. So simple and so delicious. 
Usually I bake for pure enjoyment and to eat some of the dough (which I did, of course) but the cookies themselves were so phenomenal, I had a hard time practicing self-restraint.
Side note:I used crushed candy melts instead of the chocolate chips.

This was just AWESOME. Since I don't like mixing things around with chocolate, I got rid of the nuts and put more chocolate chips in! I made them first with white sugar, which was kind of too sweet for me, so for the second time, I made them with brown sugar which was better. As if I was making a scone, I didn't fully melt my butter but just chopped it into very small pieces and mixed it with the batter. Also, I added one more egg, which made the cookies so soft... The cookies are super soft and like a cake when you just get them out of the oven (which tastes WONDERFUL), and will become chewy but not hard at all when you cool it down. The best chocolate-chocolate chip cookies I've ever baked in my entire life!

I made this recipe and these cookies were delicious! I took the majority to work (much to the sadness of tmy children) and my co-workers raved about these. I did as I always do use 1/2 margarine and 1/2 butter flavored shortening. Instead of chocolate chips I used chocolate chunks, i felt this gave the cookie a better texture. The don't flat out a lot so keep that in mid. Overall I will make this again!

Wow, these are fantastic!  The only problem is the recipe does not make enough!!!  The only change I made was to substitute 1/2 cup coconut oil for 1/2 cup of butter.  They are thick/puffy & when you bite into or break them open, soft & gooey!

These cookies were DELICIOUS! They were soft and super chocolatey. I decreased the sugar to 1 1/4 cups because I didn't want it that sweet. Other than that, they were really good.

I love chocolate cookies! These are really good, but i changed some things. I reduced the sugar and the chocolate chips and added in more nuts. I use crushed almonds/macadamians. I sold them to my classmates and they love it!

We thought these were great. I made a half batch with the only deviation being chopped bittersweet chocolate instead of chips. I also made slightly larger cookies...yielding 15 instead of 24. Cooked as directed...10 minutes was perfect. Will make again.

I made to specs except I used 3/4 cup of white sugar and 3/4 cup of brown sugar.  I chilled the dough in the fridge for about 6 hours and I am baking them now.  I might have to tell husband that I "broke" several of the cookies in the first batch.  These are delicious!  A great decadent dark chocolate cookie.

These were amazing!Was craving a chocolate treat and these were the right fix. They're soft in the middle firm on the outside, not overly sweet. Left out the nuts and added white chocolate chips. Took them to work and they were instantly devoured by my co-worker.

These were disappointing. More like a brownie than a cookie, way too sweet and I don't think I have ever said that in my life! They didnt melt down like regular drop cookies and I could taste the baking soda! I followed the recipe exactly.

These cookis are delectably decadently rich, and stayed soft in an airtight container.  My alterations: unsalted butter because that is what I had, 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground sea salt because that is what I had (added extra salt to compensate for unsalted butter) and ghirardelli dark chocolate chips, because that was my inspiration for finding a great chocolate chip cookie recipe. They took the full 10 minutes bake time in my oven.  Things I will think about for next time: more walnuts, and swap out some of the white sugar for brown, as suggested.  Unfortunately I did not read comments prior to baking...but they were perfect just the way I made them!  Just a faint hint of sea salt, if you like sea-salted dark chocolate you will love the twist.

Excellent, Excellent.  Because of what I had on hand I made with 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening and almost all brown sugar topped up with white to meet measurement.  Perfect cookies.

A wonderful chocolaty cookie. Be sure to chill dough prior to baking for best results. I replaced 1/2 cup of white sugar with brown sugar.  Get ready to blast off as these cookies are the best with a nice cold glass of milk. Kids were speechless and just wobbled their heads in pure delight when asked if they liked them.   :)

My family fully enjoyed these cookies.  I usually just bake a sheet and then freeze the rest and make later.  I took a section and put the tiniest bit of peppermint flavoring - mmm.  That was good too.  I will definitely keep this in my rotation of cookies.

Wonderful cookies! I always tweak recipes, so please forgive me - this is whole wheat, coconut oil instead of butter, not quite 1 cup of sugar, fewer chips, and a few hazelnuts. Everything else is the same. Organic.

I needed a chocolate fix in a bad way so I decided to try these.  They did not disappoint!  I used half butter and half coconut oil that I softened.  To the flour mixture I added 2 teaspoons of instant espresso powder and that just added a nice depth of flavor.  I definitely didn't have the flat cookie problem that others had as mine didn't flatten at all.  They stayed in the same shape in which I placed them on the cookie sheet.  The next time I make them, I will decrease the sugar and flour a bit as they were a bit too sweet and dry after they cooled.

Wow! These cookies are delicious! They so chocolaty, they practically melt in your mouth. I'd suggest baking them for longer than it says on the recipe. I used convection baking, which is supposed to decrease the time, but still had to bake them for longer than 10 minutes. Even then,these cookies come out soft and chewy in the center, which is a actually positive for some people. Still, don't expect a crispy crunchy sort of cookie...

Good God Gertie, are these great!  Tried these for hubby for Valentine's Day and holy  are they great!!!I put in 1 cup of walnuts and LIGHTLY sprayed sheets with Pam (no parchment paper available here in Mexico, cooked them 9 minutes.  I also lightly formed dough into balls to keep theri form after reading other reviews and they held together nicely.  Let them cool 5 minutes after taking out of oven.  I would give this a 15 star if I could!

I have been making these for years. EXCELLENT! They really need to be slightly under cooked. I also used dark chocolate mint chips (Nestles Christmas Limited edition) and received even higher reviews. Bites of heaven!

Everyone loved them, like other reviewers, the first time I made them they turned out pretty flat. So cutting down on the margarine helps. I also added almond extract instead of vanilla. It made them pretty delicious!

Super yummy!  I made this recipe with 1.5 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of mint extract.  SO yummy.  It was  a nice complement to the chocolaty goodness of this recipe.

I tried this and LOVED it, the whole family did. Upon reading the reviews beforehand, I decided to edit the recipe slightly. I halved the recipe, so I put 1/2 a cup of sugar and another 1/4 cup of brown sugar. That made the cookies nice and soft! I also chilled the dough beforehand. Overall this was an amazing cookie recipe!

I didn't think they were very good at all. The cookies tasted "floury" and dry. I think they could use a tad more sugar.

Very yummy. I exchanged 1 cup of crisco in place of the butter so that the cookies would not flatten out. I also used 3/4 Cup of sugar and 3/4 Cup of brown sugar instead of 1 1/2 Cup of white sugar.

Awesome cookie! I followed the recipe exactly & got great results! I did mix up the chocolate chips because I had stray bags open of white chocolate, semi-sweet & milk chocolate(still equalling 2C.) Everyone loved these!

WoW! These are so good! Everyone loved them. I actually made half the amount and they were still so good! Half the amount made almost 3 dozen too!I made a couple changes though, I added 1teaspoon of baking powder and a tablespoon of vanilla. I baked them at 325 for 13minutes. I did, however, have to use my hands to roll them into a bit of a ball before putting them on the baking sheets. Such a great recipe! Can't wait to try them again :)

Flavor was ok, but more cake like than I would like. I did not change a thing except I did not add the nuts. I upgraded this to a 4 (my original was 3) because my husband loved these.

I was thrilled with these! I am an uber chocolate snob and they satisfied even me! I loved the idea of using half shortening/ half butter and the brown sugar/ white sugar combo was excellent. The brown sugar added a new dimension.Not for the faint of heart that doesn't love sweets!

We're calling these "My New Year Resolution lasted 5 Days Cookies"!  Wonderful!  Per other reviewers, I used half white sugar and half brown.  I used 3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, 3/4 cup milk chocolate chips, and 3/4 cup peanut butter chips.  Increased the vanilla to 1 tablespoon, and added some cinnamon.  Used a 2oz cookie scoop, parchment paper, and 8 minutes in the oven later: cookie heaven!

Great recipe. I've made it twice-No major changes except for adding white chocolate chips instead of the nuts. Oh, I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar after reading the other reviews.The cookie was chocolatey and delicious both times. It's my little boy's new favorite cookie.

This is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!!!!!!!! I did 1 c. White sugar and 1/2 c. Light brown sugar.I also cooked them for 13 minutes but I did big scoops. I made a huge mess and had fun in the process. The only bad thing is cleaning up :)

These satisfied our chocolate craving! They are delicious and chewy cookies. I used 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of 2 cups and I thought it was a nice amount. The batter made exactly 3 dozen medium-sized cookies. I think these would be great with or without the walnuts.

I tried this recipe exactly as written and live at 5,000 feet elevation band am always nervous baking at altitude, since most recipes are written for closer to sea-level.  These cookies came out perfect!!  They are absolutely the perfect little chocolate cookie beautifully balanced with an almost imperceivsble touch of salt.  DELICIOUS!!!

I used half butter and have shortening. Instead of 2 c choc chips I used 1 c of mini choc chi[s and 1 cup mini baking m&ms. They were great! They were gone pretty darn quick!

With this I made 11 dozen cookies and all of them turned out fantastic. The only difference is that I used less chocolate chips (and used white chocolate), rolled them in coconut before cooking and only cooked them for 5 minutes.

I love these cookies!  I needed a recipe for chocolate cookies because all I had on hand was white chips.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out wonderful.  If you over cook them they will get hard.  I baked mine for 8 minutes and let them cool on the pan about 3-4 minutes and they were perfect.  I just went to the kitchen to put them away and they are almost gone.

I was looking for a chocolate peanut butter chip recipe, but couldn't find one I liked. So I adapted this for my cookies. I read the reviews and took the advice and halved the white sugar and add equal amount of brown sugar, to keep them soft. I added Reese's Peanut Butter chips. OMG, these turned out so good. Everyone loved them. Friends want the recipe. These are one of our new favorite. -Wendy

These cookies are DELICIOUS!  I took them to my office where everyone always tries to be super healthy and they were gone within a couple of hours.  I followed other reviews and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  I also underbaked them a tad and cooked them on parchment paper so I could slide the paper directly onto the counter as soon as I took the pan out of the oven.  I will make these many more times!

I'm not sure I'd try this recipe again without a few modifications.  The batter is very sticky and difficult to work with.  Expect dirty, chocolatey fingers if you use a teaspoon to drop your batter on to the cookie sheet, or the need to rinse your cookie scoop between batches.  I had no trouble with the cookies sticking to my cookie sheet (I used heavy, non-stick jelly roll pans by Chicago Metallic), but the cookies did stick to the cooling rack.  

They were tasty (reminiscent of a brownie), but the butter flavor is overwhelming.  I'd follow other reviewers' suggestions to use 1/2c of shortening in place of 1/2c butter.  Unless you chill your batter before baking, your cookies will come out large and thin.  I highly recommend not only chilling, but using a cookie scoop and maybe even a touch more flour.

My husband left a dish of cookies sitting out for 24 hours, and they remained crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside, but the butter flavor comes through as stale. Bleh.  They're also not the prettiest things to look at, as you can see from the user submitted photos, but using 1 cup of white chips and decorating the tops with 3 white chips before baking improved the appearance.

Thanks for sharing this recipe. :)

WOW! These cookies are addictive! I followed the recipe with the exception of the sugar, I used 1 1/4 cups of sugar. I used Starbucks Hot Cocoa. I divided the dough into half with Dark Chocolate Chip the other half I used Costco Semisweet Chocolate Chips. I made half of each type without nuts, and half with chopped English Walnuts, essentially ending with 4 types of cookies. This will be a great variety for the cookie tray. Hubby said they are the BEST I've EVER made. I will definitely be making them again for Christmas.
High quality ingredients do make a difference! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them! (Made 5 dozen 2" cookies)

I have made many different cookie recipes but this is by far one of the best! The only change I made was to substitute half of the semi-sweet chips with white chocolate chips and they turned out great! If you are looking for a thick, slightly gooey and chewy cookie then this is it! This will be one of my "go to" favs for sure.

All loved this recipe. Followed exactly except used Hershey 's special dark cocoa powder and Hershey 's special dark chips. Accidentally baked first batch at 370 (didn't have  glasses on). Still turned out. Refrigerated all but first batch and only for length of time prior batch was in oven. Will definitely do again. Would love to try with little instant coffee.

Made the recipe exactly as posted using all butter, but I did half semi-sweet chocolate chips and half white chocolate chunks. These are soft, chewy and deliciously rich. They were a big hit at my work and I've been told it's a keeper.

A good recipe, these biscuits are a cross between a biscuit and a brownie, perfect for adding things like choc chips, peanut buttern, cream cheese. I like the recipe, versatile, not quite five stars but a recipe that is good and worth cooking a few times. I think it would work well iced with frosting.

I have attempted to make all sorts of cookies for years and regardless of my effort they taste terrible. This was the first time I was able to make delicious cookies! Thank you for sharing this recipe and for the great tips. I used 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and refrigerated dough for one hour prior to baking. The cookies did not flatten and they were moist and delicious.

These are seriously yummy cookies.  I used Kamut flour (it's a little easier on the tummy if you're sensitive to wheat) and anticipating that they'd be sweeter than they needed to be, I reduced the sugar to 1 C.  They turned out SO well.  The way I made the dough, it was easiest to form a loose ball and put it onto the cookie sheet that way.  They only spread out a little, so it was easy to fit quite a few on my cookie sheet.  I'm not sure if this would be the case if you regular wheat flour.
The chocolate flavor was full and the cookie was sweet.  Not TOO sweet, thank goodness!  They stayed soft and almost brownie-like, when stored on a plate with some press and seal wrap over the top.  
I will DEFINITELY make these again!

Really liked these cookies!  Hubby and I are trying to watch our waistlines (a losing battle), so I substituted with 3/4 cup splenda sugar blend and 1/4 cup splenda brown sugar blend, 1 cup sugar free chocolate chips, half whole wheat flour, light butter and DARK cocoa powder for a bit more intensity.  Even with all of these changes, cookies turned out great!!

Made this for my wife and girls and they loved it. 
The only thing that I changed with the recipe was the chopped walnuts. We did not have any when I made them so we used what we did have which was coconut. They came out beautifully. Chewing and delicious.

Love these! Super easy to make using a stand mixer. Based on other reviews, I used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar, next time I'd try 1/2 cup of each as they are sweet with the 3/4 of each.  I used 3/4 cup milk chocolate chips and  1/2 cup chopped dried cherries. Absolutely divine!!!

These are delicious! Very chocolatey and soft. Very rich though, I could only eat about 2 of them. I added some marshmallows just to have something in there other than chocolate.

These were very easy to make and came out perfectly.  They instruction about cooking them until they just set was right on the money.  Also, I substituted almond extract for the vanilla.  Delicious!

Excellent chocolate cookie!  No problem with dryness, they were still very moist even after five days.  I baked recipe as written except for the nuts, my grandson is allergic.  They are like little brownie bites.  I think I will try them with peanut butter chips.

These were pretty awesome. They were very brownie-like, fudgy and soft. I would probably add another 1/4-1/2 tsp baking soda next time because these hardly spread out at all so they were tall and a little cakey. The upside of that is I fit more on the baking sheet at a time. I wanted a dark chocolate taste so I added 1/4 less sugar and used half brown and half white. I also added a pkg of sugar free instant chocolate pudding as I do to all my cookies to keep them soft. I burned my tongue eating these because I couldn't wait until they cooled because they are so good!

I couldn't decide whether to make cookies or brownies, so I compromised with these cookies. I'm glad I did. I used half brown sugar, half granulated white, and used cornstarch in place of baking soda. Turned out soft, moist and delicious!

YUMMY!! these cookies turned out soft and chewy. After mixing the dough I put it in the frig. for about 30 mins. and I used a tablespoon scooper so that the cookies were all the same size.  I had to add five minutes to the baking time b/c I put the dough in the frig. But let me tell you- These cookies are SHOW STOPPERS!

Really great! Followed all of the ingredients perfectly, added a little bit less cocoa powder because that seemed like quite a bit and their soft, chewy, and double the chocolate. Who WOULDN'T love those?

I love them though I find them a bit too sweet (all US cake/cookies to be frank). I'll cut the sugar so the chocolate will stand out more.

My sister wanted me to make chocolate cookies, and this recipe seemed promising. The only change I made was half white sugar and half brown sugar. The cookies were just so good, and I'm not one for chocolate cookies. It was like a cross between a brownie and chocolate cake! Yummy!

Absolutely fabulous!  I didn't change a thing and they were awesome!  I decided to let my 11 year old try the recipe while I "coached" her through it and did the actual baking.  The recipe was easy enough for her to follow and all 6 of us were in choco-heaven!  We ate a lot, but froze the rest for that moment when we just need a little chocolate!  These will be a staple cookie in our home!

These are so good! I did change it to 1 cup white sugar and a 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Then refrigerated the dough for an hour. I am so glad I had to take them on my camping trip or my husband and I would have ate them all.

This was really great! Cookies stay soft and moist even after couple days! I cut back on the amount of chocolate chips by half when I made this recipe-that's just cause I'm not a fan of getting a large mouthful of choco chips when I bite into a cookie. I also used white chocolate chips instead to lessen the richness, and with these changes they turned out fantastic!!

If you are looking for a super sweet and yummy cookie this is a good one. It is not for those who like a light cookie by any means. I made it to the recipe with no alterations...well other than I only had 1/2 cup of chocolate chips so I used a chopped milk chocolate bar for the rest and didn't quite do the full two cups as the chocolate bar mad it quite rich.  I also opted out of the optional nuts. 

Pretty yummy :)

These cookies are amazing!  I used half shortening and half butter and made them with 1 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar.  I chilled the dough before shaping, and they stayed nice and puffy.  Baking just until the tops begin to crack, as another user suggested, is perfect - these are soft and delicious.

I tried this but made the following changes:  only use 1/2 cup of cocoa, and change the sugar to half white & half brown.  If you are using some shortening with the butter you need to add 1 tbsp. of water per 1/2 cup of shortening to equal 1/2 cup butter.  This will help with the dryness factor that is a problem for some.  Also, increase the salt to 1/2 tsp (you always want to use salt when you are using cocoa to make the chocolate flavour come alive).  I also increased the baking soda to 1 tsp to help with the rise.  The batter should be fairly moist when putting onto the cookie sheet (almost hard to shape) and they come out high and nice.  Good luck!

Delicious and so chocolatey!  The recipe is easy and also makes a good number of cookies.  They are soft on the inside, but have a nice crunch when you bite into them.  I HIGHLY recommend making these if you're a chocolate lover.  But, have milk on hand!

These are the best cookies. We tried several recipes and this is our favorite. My 10 year old son asks for them at least 2-3 times a week. He would be on a constant sugar high if I would make them that often!

Fantastic recipe for chewy cookies, especially if you and the peeps love chocolate. I followed the recipe to the T, only I used white chocolate chips instead, to give a nice color contrast. As a side note, would you believe my husband said they weren't very chocolatey? HA! Not only are his eyes and ears going, but his taste buds must be failing too;)

These cookies are really great! Made them exactly to the recipe (No ingredient changes) - just adjusted servings down to 2 dozen because it's only 2 of us. Dropped teaspoon size and baked exactly 8 min - Perfect! Such a good chocolate flavor and very moist/chewy. Definitely a keeper!

Mmmm just made these and they turned out very well, even after I healthified them. I substituted the sugar with a mashed brown banana, a few tablespoons of honey, and approximately a quarter cup of brown sugar. I also used whole wheat flour. Very impressive, I'm sure I will make them again when I need another chocolate fix!

These are fantastic! Followed the recipe to the letter-without the walnuts. **note-do not overbake these!! I experimented with different times, and these were perfect at 8-8.5 minutes. 9 minutes were overdone, 8 minutes are just a tad too gooey. Used a Tablespoon measuring spoon-level. I'm a baker-but cookies have always been my Achilles heel....not these! Perfect!!

The best chocolate chocolate chip cookie recipe hands down. Be careful not to over bake. I used 1/2 cup of salted butter and 1/2 cup of butter shortening. Plump delicious cookies!!!

Yummy!  I used mint m-n-m's and they were tasty!  I baked mine for 10 minutes.  These would even be good with no chocolate chips and a dusting of powdered sugar.

Very good cookies, but I think they could be a little sweeter.  I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored shortening, and they are soft and moist.

I'm eating them while still warm. Flavor is amazing-I did leave out the nuts as no one will eat them here but me. The cookies do fall apart while still warm (small price to pay) but I'm sure will be solid once they cool more. I did use 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening as recommended and they didn't spread out as much which I think is a good idea.

Followed Diane M.'s changes of 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar and subbed out half the butter with shortening.  Also used milk Choc. Chips instead of semi sweet.  Came out FABULOUS!!!!!!

MAKE THE ALL THE TIME, EVERYONE LOOOOOVES THEM!
Trick to make them soft is cook them for 7 minutes at 320, then let them sit for an hour then pack them up and they will be soft for days! 
MAKE SURE YOU MIX all the ingredients well or they won't turn out well, I mix for at least 10 minutes before I  put the chocolate chips in.

These were really disapointing. They turned out flat and rather dry. The egdes were burnt while the middel was still wet and runny. I gave them to my brother, who eats everything and he said they were okay. Also, they were really hard to get off the pan due to the flat-ness and ended up in pieces. They were aldo waaay to sweet. 

On another note, they were easy to repair and edible :3

I came across this recipe. Tryed it and absolutely love them. This one is a keeper and will definately make these again. I replaced the butter/margerine with plain greek yogurt which cut half the fat out of the recipe and kept them soft and moist. Very yummy.

Got great compliments at my book club meeting!  As recommended by a reviewer I chilled the dough for an hour before baking and the cookies did not flatten too much.   I rolled the dough in the shape of a 1.5 inch log wrapped in a piece of parchment paper prior to chilling, then I sliced into 24 cookies (I cut the recipe amount in half as 4 doz was too much for me) and baked for about 11 mins.

This is the most request cookie I have ever made. I follow the recipe ingredients exactly, but I have some suggestions to the prep to make this even better. First, do not use a mixer. Mixing by hand and not over mixing will create a tender moist cookie. Toats the nut first in a small pan with a dusting of salt. The flavors will be amazing. I bake by the teaspoonful at 350 for exactly 8 minutes the cookies will keep their shape so don't wait for them to flatten. Enjoy.

I did use half semi-sweet, half dark chocolate chips, and pecans. I also used 1 cup sugar and half cup brown. I felt the batter was real sugary tasting so I added in another 1/4 cup flour. Cookies nice and soft but did get hard after a couple days and we had to microwave them for that softness again.

This is a super sweet explosion of chocolately goodness in your mouth. In fact, a little sweet for my taste, even though I liked it. My kids thought they were amazing. Followed other reviewers advice with half buttery shortening and half butter, also half dark brown sugar and half white sugar. Did a little bit of a twist with dark chocolate chips and white chocolate chips. This made it really good, next time to make it a little less sweet will just use dark chocolate chips. For big teasponfuls on the baking sheet, I baked them for 10 minutes. In my oven can only fit one sheet on a rack, so bake for five minutes and then switch racks and bake for five more, this helps bake two batches more evenly. Oh, and the nonstick aluminum foil is amazing. Cookies didn't stick and is reusable for multiple batches.

I made these cookies just as the recipe reads (opting not to add walnuts) but I baked them as a bar (I hate babysitting the oven with cookies) and my family LOVES them. They were fluffy, moist, chocolatey and delicious. The whole pan only lasted 2 days in our house! Great recipe!

I made these in the kitchen at school last week, and everyone loved them! I added extra chocolate chunks to make them more chocolaty, and they came out nice and gooey! The only drawback was that they did tend to fall apart a lot, but you're eating it with your fingers anyway, so who cares?

With the exception of using peppermint M&Ms instead of chocolate chips/nuts, I followed this recipe to a T. Cookies were delicious and perfect for the holiday!

These cookies are amazing. Mine turned out crispy in outside and soft and very moist inside. I used dark chocolate cocoa powder, and the flavor was very rich but not overpowering. My dought was very sticky so I added 2 tbs of milk. That did the trick. Perfect consistency. I will be making these again. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I used "hershey's special dark reserve" for the cocoa powder and the batter turned black so i used white chocolate chips. i also rolled the dough out and used cookie cutters to cut them, they kept their shape very well. also, baked at 350 for 15 minutes and they were perfectly done inside. i'm not a huge fan of chocolate so i probably won't make these for myself again, but i would bet that my mom and other chocoholics will love them. 3 stars in my book.
In the photo the left cookies are without nuts and the right are with. I would definitely recommend adding the nuts, the cookies were kind of blah without them.

Fabulous! I added 1 handful of sweetened coconut. Delish! Also, I dropped by rounded TABLEspoon fulls, which got me cookies about the size of my palm (about a dozen) using half this recipe. Cook for 12-13 minutes for this larger size cookie. Definitely going in my recipe box...

I did some modification. 1) I use 1 cup brown sugar instead of the 1 1/2 cup white sugar. 2)I use chocolate chunks instead of chocolate chips.
It turned out to be soooooooooo good! It's melting in my mouth. Every body love it!!! Will keep this recipe!

Baking is always tricky for me because I live in Colorado.  But, the cookies came out perfect with no high altitude adjustements. These are yummy and soft and this is now one of my favorite cookie recipes!

Yum!  I did make some changes.  3/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup lightly packed best brown sugar.  2 1/4 cup flour.  1/2 cup cocoa.  I also used Reese's Peanut butter chips.  Yum.  Its still a very soft dough.  Chilling it first could help.  I also incresed oven temp to 375

These cookies are great!  I used 1 cup semi sweet chips and 1 cup white chips, plus 1/2 cup pecans and 1/2 cup dried cranberries.  I also mixed in about a 1/2 cup of melted semi-sweet chocolate chips into the batter.  Delicious!

Wonderful!  I split the butter and instead of one cup of butter, I did one half cup of butter and one cup of virgin coconut oil.  Also broke the cookie down into four batches:
-  cherries added
-  macadamia nuts added
-  orange zest added
-  little crystalized ginger chunks added
They were delicious!

These are awesome! Instead of butter and eggs I did coconut oil and flax (1 T. flax to 3 T. water for each egg) to make it vegan, and then I used whole wheat flour and evaporated cane juice instead of white sugar. I also threw in some flaked coconut with my chocolate chunks to draw out the coconut flavor. Definitely a repeat recipe.

Definitely delicious! They were at their best the very first day--especially warm out of the oven--but we're still yummy on day 2 and 3.  I just recommend a tall glass of milk to dunk away!

Delicious. Easy. Made as directed, only replacing 1/2 c white sugar with 1/2 cup dark brown sugar and adding some minced dried cherries. The colder the batter, the less flat these turned out. No matter, though: they are delicious regardless. Added a few grains Hawaiian red salt to a few and it truly elevated them - they rival the most expensive goodies out there. Will be making these again.

Best cookies I have ever made, and I have made a LOT of cookies. The only think I changed was splitting the flour half whole wheat and half all purpose. Still tasted AMAZING. I will be making these again.

Followed advice of others and replaced half of the white sugar with brown sugar. Used semisweet chocolate chunks and no nuts. Stayed wonderfully soft when stored with half piece of bread.

Yummy! My little boy and I made these with dark chocolate chips and mini marshmallows - the marshmallows were a little messy during cooking, but once cooled, the crispy bits on the outside tasted like toffee. I'll make these again for sure!

Very delicious...
I've cut the sugar to 1 cup and chocolate chips to 1 1/2 cup, just to be a bit healthier...and they tasted very good......

I thought these were a bit too dry. They did taste great, but still too dry. They are something between a cake and a cookie.

I took the suggestion of using 1 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I wanted to do something different so instead of using 2 cups chocolate chips and 1/2 cup walnuts, I used 2 cups of Reeses peanut butter chips and 1/2 cup chocolate chips. They were very chocolatey and peanutbuttery! I made my cookies really big so it yielded 2 dozen, not 4 dozen. Also because they were bigger, they obviously took a bit longer to cook. They were AMAZING. I would make them again!

Delicious. Don't overbake. Tastes and smell great. We snuck them in the movie theater and I could hear growling stomachs in the row behind us. Chocolatey Deliciousness.

The BEST chocolate cookies, period.
I can't say enough good things about this recipe- the texture is perfect, not too sweet, just chocolatey enough. 
I use Hershey's dark cocoa and milk chocolate chips- yum!

I made these cookies today (no changes whatsoever to the original recipe) and they are AMAZING! They certainly provide a satisfying fix for a gooey chocolate craving. 

It was very humid where I was baking, and I think my butter may have been a bit too soft; the cookies were incredibly soft and delicate--no crispy edges--, even after baking for 12 minutes and cooling on the baking sheet. No complaints here, the cookies are still wonderfully delicious; however, next time I will try refrigerating the dough for a little while and not softening the butter as much in hopes of yielding more stable cookie.

Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I made a version of these cookies and I loved them! I didn't have exactly the right ingredients, so I used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate, and some whole wheat flour.

these were very good.  Everyone loved them, although i prefer a regular chocolate chip cookie myself.  More walnuts would make it better.  They kept well for me in an airtight container for up to a week.

I also followed the recommendations of previous reviewers and used half white sugar and half brown sugar, as well as half butter and half shortening. These cookies are absolutely DELICIOUS! I brought them in to work, and everybody has said that they are amazing. Great recipe!

The cookies tasted incredible (how can they not when they're chocolate) BUT my brother and I felt it was tooo chocolatey, which made them dry (ur gna need a cup of water right after!). I didnt think much about the amount of cocoa in the recipe until i added the cocoa and got a very dark batter. Next time i will reduce the cocoa to a 1/2 cup.

Great recipe, with a couple of tweaks.  I had to add about an extra half cup of flour to make these more like cookie dough and not cake batter.  They were quite thin, even for drop cookies.  I noted that some had "rolled into balls" and I wondered how...lol.  In any event, they are yummy and I added some peppermint extract along with a little vanilla for "Mint Choc Choc Chip".  Mmmmmmm!!!!

I would put 1/4 cup more of the optional walnuts in the recipe.  We finished them all within 4 hours of making them.  Of course, that's between 6 kids and 2 adults.  The recipe was easy and they baked up nice.  The texture was soft and the cookies stayed together.  They went fabulous with a cold glass of milk.

These were great, I also used half brown sugar half white sugar, and half butter and half shortening. Makes for gooier flufflier cookies, perfect. I went one step further and coated them in chocolate! EXCELLENT for the chocolate lover in your house!! I know the one in mine is happy!

I thought these turned out really good however, the dough is very dense and became really hard to stir when i was trying to add the chocolate chips.  I had followed the recipe exactly so i'm not sure what was with the consistency.   

you HAVE to take these out of the oven while they are still not fully cooked (8 min) or they will be over cooked.  I baked on waxed paper and just removed whole sheet to drying rack (had to leave on wax paper or would have melted through the rack, as the first batch did).  After a few mins on the paper i removed it and finished cooling on the racks.

Theses are really yummy! I did use 1 c sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar, only because I prefer the taste and texture the brown sugar gives a cookie. I was also out of vanilla extract, so I added a couple teaspoons of French vanilla instant pudding and that seemed to work out pretty well! Definitely fixed my chocolate craving!

i used half shortening and half butter as someone suggested,and they turned out as "fat" as they look in the picture! i also substituted half a cup of brown sugar. I have to say these are absolutely the best double chocolate cookies ive ever eaten. I will use this recipe time and again :) thanks

Fantastic recipe.  I used 1/2 Cup Butter, 1/2 Cup Shortening and the bite and spread of the cookie was fantastic.  About 10 minutes in my oven worked perfectly.  This chocolate batter would work well for any chip, nut or dried fruit mix-in.  I will definitely make these again!

Delicious!!!  I added M&M's and used roughly chopped Ghirradelli semi sweet choc. chunks in place of the chocolate chips.  I also took these cookies out of the oven after 7 minutes.  Soft and chewy.  Got rave reviews from family and only lasted a day.  These are on my top 5 cookie recipes, for sure!

I made these EXACTLY as the recipe stated, but even after 15 minutes they weren't cooked all the way. I turned off the oven and let them cool completely in the oven before removing them and I still didn't get that chewy crunch on the outside. The flavor was great though, I love chocolate.

Delicious cookies, very chocolate-y!  I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the results.  8 minutes worked fine on my oven, they looked a bit undercooked when I took them out but finished cooking right on the sheet. I recommend chilling the dough as well, this kept my cookies from becoming flat.  Thanks for the recipe, I really enjoyed these cookies.

Great recipe! The cookies came out very soft and moist in the inside, crunchy on the outside and very chocolatey!Kids love them! Definitely a keeper, maybe with some nuts as well next time to vary the taste!

A Very good cookie!  A little on the dry side but not awful.  I used white chocolate instead of the semisweet to make it look prettier and hae a slight contrast in flavors.

Yummy! I made these for the 2nd time last night to give out for Christmas to my co-workers. I used brown and white sugar instead of all white, and I also used a package of crushed Andes mint chocolates. They are perfect for the holidays! Or year round! I made them kind of small, about 2.5 inches in diameter so that yielded quite a bit of cookies - approx 7 dozen! And they do tend to be a little flat, but they're perfect for stacking and giving out. =) I will try it again with nuts next time.

Delicious cookies! I topped the cookies with melted white chocolate chips and dashed a little bit of kosher salt onto it. (A tip I got from a Cooking Show) They turned out great and a batch was gone by the time they all got out!

I made these without the walnuts and a bit less sugar, probably used 1.25 cups instead of 1.5 and they were fantastic.   am about to make them for the second time, and will reduce the amount of chocolate chips because i thought there were a few too many. i'll probably use 1.5 cups instead  of 2 cups. also, i have walnuts now too so will add them.

This recipe is excellent just as written.  I used half margarine and half shortening, and baked for 8 minutes.  When I took them out of the oven, I thought about baking another minute.  I'm glad I didn't.  After they cooled, they were perfect.  I baked them for company coming the following day, but my husband and son almost finished them before the company got here!

Followed recipe to a T (but din add in the nuts). The texture of the cookie is amazing, crisp on the edges, soft on the inside. I like that it's not an overly sweet cookie... but overall, not chocolate-y enough! Next time, I'm gonna try using an entire cup of cocoa instead of just 2/3.    Great chocolate cookie with lots of potential! Might try using 1/2cup semi-sweet choco chips and 1/2cup white chocolate chips next time to give it a lil extra OOMPH and to up the sweetness factor too.    reminds me of a triple chocolate cranberry cookie i used to make back in highschool, but not as heavy. thanx for sharing dis recipe =)

The best cookies ever!  The only changes I made was I split the sugar between half granulated and half brown sugar.  And I put my dough in the freezer for about 20 miuntes before rolling it into small balls.  My Husband thinks these were baught at a bakery they are so good!

BEST cookies I have EVER had. Truly. A nice change from regular chocolate chip cookies. I made these 3 days ago and they are still wonderfully chewy and moist. My boyfriend and I cannot stop eating them. Brought them into work and my coworkers loved them as well. My boyfriend wants me to make these for the guys on his fire department. I will also be making them for Thanksgiving AND Christmas, thank you for the delicious recipe!!!!

These are SO scrumptious I can't stop snacking on them.  The only thing I changed was using some mini white chocolate chips to get to the 2-cup mark (maybe 1/3 cup), since I didn't quite have enough regular chips.  Added some more color.

Thank you for posting this recipe.  Just made a batch.  They are so soft and delicious, and very chocolate-y.  Just thing I needed for today.  I added a little more vanilla in my batch.  I recommend this to anyone, try it.  They turned out great.  My bf had about 4 or 5 now.

loved it!!! however, found a bit too sweet, how can I reduce the amount of sugar used in this recipe without messing up the consistency of dough?

I made these the night before our party and they were just as great the next day as they were right when they came out of the oven!  They were very moist & chewy and did not dry out in the slightest.  Everyone raved about these cookies!

Made this just as written. The second time used 1cup sugar, 1/2 dark brown sugar and added 1 cup dried cranberries. Also let the ingredients chill for an hour then rolled up ping-pong ball size and cooked for 11 minutes. Both are 5 star

I followed some of the previous suggestions -- I used one cup of brown sugar and one cup of white and also undercooked them just a little. I also used mint chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and the result was delicious! If your a mint chocolate fan like me, I recommend it!

OMG - YUMMMM.  I followed ingredients exactly.  I do chill any dough that has butter in it before baking.  It helps keep the butter firm and keeps the cookies from spreading/flattening too much.  My husband and I couldn't stop eating these.

My husband has officially dubbed these as the best cookies I have ever made! I used half butter and half shortening which gave them the perfect consistency. This may sound too sweet for a few of you - but I actually added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar to this recipe. I felt like it needed a little boost - and they turned out great! 10 minutes is the perfect amount of time. They are still soft and chewy with melt in your mouth chocolate chips the next day!

LOVE these cookies! I've made them several times and everyone loves them! I made a few minor changes such as I use 1 cup of Crisco instead of butter (it makes them softer), I don't use the walnuts and I use Ghirardelli chocolate chips, because they are delicious

Taste: Good. This dough was really tasty, although a little rich.  Texture: Not a fan! They're too light and cake-like. I expected them to flatten out like cookies normally do, but they were lumpy & ugly. I decided to refrigerate the remaining dough & roll it into balls. Didn't work too well. Very messy & still lumpy. The texture is why I left off the 5th star.  Not horrible, but not my favorite either.

a major hit with any self-respecting chocolate lover. No shortage of chips, and the dough itself has a good chocolate flavor.

My son loves this recipe.  I used super fine sugar instead of regular ground sugar.  As well,  I used 1 cup of Milk chocolate chips.  Then I used a meatball baller to scoop the cookies onto the cookie sheet and they did not go flat.

These cookies were pretty good! Very easy to make. They came out soft and brownie-like. I took the suggestion of others and made the cookies on the smaller side since they are rich especially with the chocolate chips.

This recipe is Great! I love chocolate!  With this recipe I make bar cookies and I like to use mini chocolate chips (1 cup instead of 2). Also goes really well with whipped cream on top- YUM. I'd recommend these cookies to anyone :)

OMG!  Whenever I make these now they last less than two days!  I make them small because they are so rich, but no one seems to mind.  the other day I threw pecans in a batch and loved them even more!

I baked these cookies twice now and they are delicious! I halved the recipe (Because it's just me and my fiance) but they were gone in a day or two! A few in the afternoon with tea or coffee is the perfect snack.

Wonderful cookies. Instead of using 2 cups of semi-chocolate chips, I used 1 cup semi-chocolate and 1 cup of milk chocolate chips. Also I added chocolate pudding and did half of the sugar with brown sugar.  They turned out great. Thanks for sharing.

Mouthwatering good! These cookies are wonderful. I made them with 1 cup of chocolate chips and one cup of cappuccino chips and they were fantastic!

4.5stars This is the first time I made cookies and they tasted great! Just like those you buy outside! It was really crispy and a little soft in the centre, a little like brownies in fact! But REALLY nice!  I used 250g sugar instead of the recommended 300g and it was a little sweet for me already.

These were great! I made some of the batter in cookie form and  made the rest into a cake pan, so I had a large cookie square. It was the best cookie/brownie fusion I've ever had. I used about 3/4 of the batter and put it into a 8X11 glass baking dish. Then I baked it for 20 mins. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream on top. YUM!!

So yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used white chocolate chips instead of the semisweet chips.  I also used a small ice cream scoop to drop the batter so all the cookies were the same size and baked them for 9 minutes.  The cookies turned out deliciously soft and chewy.

Amazing!  I used 1/2 of the butter and substituted applesauce for the other half. I think it made them more moist and almost brownie like and a little healthier.

I tried this cookie recipe this morning...I have to tell you these are the best chocolate chocolate chip cookies we have ever eaten!!   They are so moist and delicious.  I will be bringing these cookies to a barbecue later this afternoon and I know they will not last long!!!  I followed the recipe exactly as it was written...the only thing I added was about 2 cups of coconut which made them delicious.  Try this recipe...you won't be disappointed.  THANKS FOR A GREAT RECIPE!!

these cookies were fantastic! i took note at what one reviewer said and did half butter half shortening; they turned out perfect! i also swapped the semisweet chips for peanut butter chips. it was like eating a reese's peanut butter cup, only better. they were to die for, will definitely make again!

Delicious!! These are SO chocolately, gooey and soft - just like I like them! I used 100% natural cane sugar instead of white sugar and subsituted 2 oz bittersweet chocolate for the chocolate chips. They turned out excellent and I will definitely make them again!

YUM! They are soft and melt in our mouth goodness. I added semi sweet and white chocolate chips as well as dried cranberries. I didn't change anything else in the recipe. They came out great. Be watchful with the baking time since they are dark and you can't tell if they are finished just by looking at them. 8-9 mins.= perfect cookies.

I didn't like these that much, but my son did. I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet, and I only had 1.5 cups, which seemed to be enough to me.  They come out nice and soft if you don't over cook them.

Best cookies I have ever had--and I've heard this from others as well.  Use both semi-sweet and white chocolate chips for a beautiful cookie.  I've also put in peanut better chips, which were a huge hit.

I did as a few other entries suggested and changed the sugar to 3/4c Brown Sugar and 3/4c white. I also used 1/2 cups of both shortening and butter. Instead of just 2 cups of chocolate chips, I did 1 cup of Reese peanut butter chips, about 3/4 cup of dark chocolate and a broken up Hersheys bar. They came out FANTASTIC! YUM  :)   Thick, soft, chocolately. The perfect chocolate chocolate chip cookie

These cookies are amazing! No changes made to the ingredients. I did chill the dough for about half an hour before baking as recommended by another reviewer. The only problem with these, they are way too good and keep you coming back for more!

Delicious cookie! I didn't have enough chocolate chips so I used a milk chocolate bar cut in chunks. Best double chocolate chip cookie I've ever made.

What a super chocolately treat.  My four year old loved them, as did my husband and I.  I made the whole recipe, and froze them into little balls so I could just pull a few out and bake whenever I need (or want!) them.  It worked great.  My favorite double chocolate cookie recipe!

I will make these again and again. I used macadamia nuts, that was the only change that I made to this recipe. My husband was standing right next to me as the first pan came out of the oven. He couldn't stop "mmmmmmmmmmming".

Really great recipe! My husband is French and finds traditional chocolate chip cookies lacking (we disagree on this!) but he LOVES these.   I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used half white sugar and half brown. And then I also used half white chocolate chips and half chocolate, just to be fancy! They are GOOD!

I was nervouse to make this recipe after reading some of the negative reviews. When they first came out of the oven I didnt think I liked them much, but after a few hours I found they were really tasty! They are still moist today 3 days later. Good recipe. I used margarine instead of butter as I do for most of my baking and the substitution worked fine.

Not as chocolate-y as I would have liked, and a tad too sweet. I also used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter as others had recommended, but rather I wished I hadn't. Probably would not make again.

This is a good recipe, however I cooked it for 8 min. and the cookies burned on the bottom. I reduced the cook time to 6 min with the same effect. I think a 4-5 min cook time should be max.

These are AWESOME!!!  I'm a true chocoholic, and these are not for the faint at heart.  The only difference in my cookies were that I used Hershey's special dark cocoa instead of the regular cocoa to deepen the chocolate flavor.  VERY rich!  Love it! (I've made them with regular cocoa before as well and gave them as gifts.  We and our recipients loved those too.) Also, I gently rolled the dough in my hands to shape it out before putting on the baking sheet.  Made for perfectly round cookies.  They didn't really spread at all, so shaping them makes a big asthetic difference.  :)

WOW!  Finally, a chocolate chip cookie that doesn't look like a frisbee!  I did follow some suggestions and used 1 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown sugars and 1/2 cup margarine (one stick) and 1/2 cup shortening.  P-E-R-F-E-C-T!!!

these were very good. if you really like the taste that cocoa powder can give to baked goods than these might not be for you but i thought they were very tasty and beware: they look hard and crunchy from the outside but they are really soft and chewy inside. UPDATE: the second day and days after these cookies are very cakey but still delicious

Used coconut oil instead of butter, whole wheat flour, one cup organic sugar and one cup chopped dark chocolate baking bar.  Followed everything else.  Turned out great (don't like excessively sweet food).  Kids give it a thumbs up, say that warm they taste like a fudgy brownie almost.  Haven't tried them cold yet.  They hardly flattened when cooking, I had to flatten them with a spatula when they came out of the oven.

I made this with white chocolate chips, like the cookies you get at Subway. If you live with family/roommates, save yourself some work and make a full batch-my half-batch was gone within the day.

Best cookies I've ever made! The recipe calls for quite a few, so I made them on Valentine's day and took the leftovers out to visit some friends. Everyone was raving about them and ate almost all of them! I put them in a Ziploc on the counter and they stayed super moist and chewy for almost three days!

Very good.  I added some white chocolate chips as well.  I, unfortunately, did not read the other reviews before jumping into this recipe.  My cookies came out a little flat, so chilling it before hand should help (since I used butter).  Great flavor though!!

SO GOOD!!!  All I changed was subbing in a 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of using all white sugar based on other reviews.  So easy, and everybody loved these!

The cookies tasted okay, but they were incredibly crumbly and fell apart. They did not form like normal cookies, we had to flatten them with a spoon before sticking them into the oven.  Over all the consistency is not what you would expect from a cookie.

I made these with Reese's peanut butter chips instead of semisweet and they came out amazing!!! Didn't change a thing. It's a good idea to let dough sit in fridge for a while so that they don't come out flat.

Very Yummy!  I had to have a "CH" word for my son's sharing at school, we made these to share with the class and what a big hit!  We added 1/2 white chocolate chips, 1/4 regular choc. chips and the rest M&M's. (was almost out of reg. choco. chips) will definitely do it this same way next time! Other than the change of the choc. chips followed the recipe. Can't wait to make these again.

Used half butter half shortening. I used PB chips in half the batch and mint chips in the other half. These cookies were great. Nice and crispy on the outside, soft and gooey in the middle. Thanks for sharing.

Wow! Those really turned out fantastic!  I halved the recipe and ommited the walnuts.  I refrigerated them for a couple hours but they still turned out flat...However, this is a fast, easy recipe with a great taste so it deserves 5 stars in my book =)

Wow these are good. I did tweak the recipe a little. I used a tablespoon of shortening due to some of the reviews I read. I also added a 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder. I used dark chocolate chips and pecans. These are just great cookies. Thank you

I made this exactly as directed except I used 1/2 white chocolate chips and 1/2 semi sweet chocolate chips. I was a bit worried at first as the dough is rather thick. But WOW are they good! My family loved them. I will definitely make this over and over again. Thanks for the great recipe!

these are fab! They are like little brownie cookies. I used margarine (Stork brand as I live in the UK). I also used one pkg plain chocolate drops (Asda) and one pkg of Milk chocolate chips (Tesco)- because these were the ingredients I had on hand. I chilled the dough for an hour, and I turned down my oven to 150C because my oven tends to be very hot.  They turned out brillant!! I love the tip someone put about lining your baking sheets with foil - EXCELLENT IDEA!! I cannot rave enough about these cookies. My family loved them!!! thankyou

These cookies are fantastic!  I usually add reeses pieces to them instead of chocolate chips and it is an addicting combination.  So addicting that my friend nick named them crack cookies, because she could not stop eating them.

They are great. I had compliments from my friends. Bake for 9 mins for a softer texture or up to 10 mins for more crisp and dryer cookies.

These cookies are amazing! I am a die-hard chocoholic, so these were made for me. I only made 1/2 batch (so I wouldn't gain too much weight when I ate them all). :o) I divided the sugar - used 1/4 C brown sugar and 1/2 C white sugar. It didn't look chocolately enough to me, so I also added a little more cocoa and lessened the flour - to compensate. I used pecans instead of walnuts. I made the cookies with a small disher, so they were bigger than the recipe suggested. I cooked them 8 1/2 minutes, but they could have used another minute (being a bigger size). If I made them the suggested teaspoon size I definitely wouldn't cook more than 8 minutes. The recipe is terrific. Definitely a keeper!!!

Excellent recipe! So easy to make, as other reviewers suggested I did 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white. I also refrigerated the dough for about an hour before baking and they came out delicious. My oven had them done in about 10 min for soft chewy cookies.

Very tasty recipe.  I substituted 2 things: 1) I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar per another reviewer's recommendation and 2) I used 1/2 peanut butter chips and 1/2 chocolate chips.  Everyone seemed to really enjoy the peanut butter taste in there!

mmm...i've made these cookies several time, and they have been great every time!  The only difference is that I often use self rising flour and just skip the salt/baking soda. I have not had the drying out issue that I have seen in other reviews; didn't do anything special, just store them in an airtight container, and they stay yummy for a week!

i think it is a great consistency. it bakes up to make picture perfect cookies. I followed the additional salt and vanilla and baking powder.  The dough itself didnt have much flavor. I will try another recipe.

These were a huge hit with the family.  I used a hand blender at the beginning for the butter/sugar/egg etc. and then hand stirred the rest which was quit a work out for the arms!!  Otherwise very easy and will be making these again.  Thanks!!!

Delicious. My boys loved them. I am not usually a huge chocolate chip cooie fan and found them melting in my mouth. Will definitely do them again and make it one of my regulars for desert. Also did the 1/2 cup butter & 1/2 cup shortening (only had 1/2 cup butter on hand, so it worked out well). Other then that everything the same.

Very good! Turned out great! Very rich.. every time I pop one in my mouth, I cant stop eating and get sick because they are so sweet lol. I did what other people recommended and used half brown and half white sugar and also used half shortening and half butter. Really delicious and addicting!  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

I just loved the taste of these cookies, the only disappointment was they turned out flat (even though I did my usual trick and put the dough in the fridge for 60 mins).  I used 1/2 cup of oats instead of the nuts and used 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar.

These were AMAZING, the only thing that I changed was using half white sugar and half dark brown soft sugar. I also added 75g rams of melted cooking chocolate into the mixture. Absolutely fab!

These should be called...are you kidding me? cookies! They are incredible...chocolatey goodness. I had no trouble keeping them moist for the 3 days they lasted in the house. They were a little thin and required 12-14 minutes. I am making these again and trying to freeze the dough for 10 minutes so they may be thicker. I am also going to add dried cherries in some of them...can't wait!

I made these last night and at the request of my 5 y/o, left out the nuts and chocolate chips, " 'cuz nuts are yucky and you're apposed to eat chocolate chips, Mommy!"  Anyway, these are the best chocolate cookies we've ever eaten!  And this is saying a lot as I am addicted to the choc. cookies from Whole Foods!

Awsome cookie. The little ones loved them and so did the big ones. Used the recipe just as is, including the walnuts. Cooked for 10 minutes to be safe and was still moist inside.  Next time I'll use 1 and 1/2 cups flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat - they'll never know!!!!

This is a super simple cookie recipe (with no fridge time, a plus for me). I used Andes Mint chips instead of regular chocolate chips and these cookies are to DIE FOR!! In a good way, that is. They come out fluffy and have great flavor. I will make these again, and again, and again.

These cookies were excellent. I used half white sugar and half light brown sugar when I baked them. I added Nestle's half semisweet, half mint chocolate chips, and chilled the dough for about an hour. Almost all of them were gone within a day!

I ate waaaaaay too many of these already.  Excellent recipe.  Had to bake mine for a tad bit longer though.  Also substituted chopped up Lindt chocolate for chocolate chips (received chocolate overload this Christmas). However, if you do that, you've got to watch the cookies carefully as Lindt chocolate burns pretty easily!

YUMYUMYUM!  I was searching for a good Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe for so long and now I've found it.  These cookies are delicious and I'm impressed. Very rich mouthwatering chocolate taste.   The best combo for me are half and half chocolate chips (black and white), and I'm not using the baking chocolate chips because they don`t taste well in Germany. Thats why I'm chopping my favourite chocolate bars.  I chilled the dough for 2 hours to prevent flat cookies - like many other. It works fine!   Thank you for this fanstastic recipe!

Near perfect and definitely for chocolate lovers!  My cookies came out of the oven nice and puffy, but then became flat and chewy as they cooled.  I may try as another review suggested and refrigerate the dough for an hour before baking and see if they come out more cakey.  The flavor is awesome, though!

YUM! Super chocolatey and delicious. I had to cook them for 10 minutes though... even doing 8 and having them sit on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes wasn't enough in my oven.

As a quick treat this was perfect.  I threw these together in short order, since all the ingredients are pretty common was simple and effortless... maybe because I was eyeballing most of the measurements; but, regardless they were excellent!

We didn't want to make another trip to the store so we made it with what we had: light margarine instead of butter, egg substitute instead of eggs, and chopped Hershey's chocolate bars instead of chocolate chips.  The result was a VERY soft, brownie/cake-like cookie.  I could see them being too soft for some but they were delicious for us!

I've been looking for a really good chocolate chip recipe and I'm so thrilled to say I've found it! Like other reviewers, I adjusted the recipe to 3/4 C sugar and 3/4 C brown sugar, and 1/2 C butter and 1/2 C lard/shortening. I also beat the wet ingrediants for several minutes, until it was as light and fluffy as it could be. The batter was like a fluffy icing, I could've eaten it just like that. I baked for exactly 8 minutes, which was perfect--left them a bit underdone inside. I will SOOO be making these again. Thank you to whoever added this recipe.

Made these with half semi-sweet chips and half Hershey's Mini Kisses milk chocolate chips - beyond decadent. Make sure you've got a glass of milk ready!

A HIT!!!!!!! These taste so amazing!  They are fluffy, chewy, and VERY delicious! I only did a few things different, I added half white chips, and half chocolate chips. I also followed some other reviews and used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa. Then I split the sugars- 3/4 cup White Sugar, 3/4 cup Brown Sugar. I added a tiny bit more flour as well...maybe 1/4 cup more. MMMMMMMMM!!! The family ate them up! They even hid some!

Great recipe!The chocolate dough is the perfect sweetness, not too sweet, not too bitter. Instead of 2 cups of chocolate chips, I added an entire bag of chocolate chunks AND an entire bag of Andes mint chips. Yum!!

These were DELICIOUS after a minor adjustment. I LOVE chocolate but I don't like it too sweet, and to make it more healthy, I replaced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups brown sugar. MMM delicious. It even gives it a nicer aroma to it!

I did the 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening thing & my cookies still came out flat.  I have been trying to find a cake-like soft chocolate cookie, I'm still looking.  These have great flavor and the presentation is awesome, especially when you use the foil trick from another review.

They are our new favorite cookies. If you are as much of a chocolate addict as we are, then these are your cookies. ENJOY!

By far, these are the BEST chocolate cookies ever to come out of my oven. Super easy to make.  Instead of regular chocolate chips, I used some white chocolate chips mixed in with some mint chips- all I can say is "Mmmmm... awesome!"  I'd rave some more, but I have to go make up another batch to replace the dozens that mysteriously vanished from my kitchen!

I did as other reviewers suggested and did half brown sugar and half white.  That's the only change I made other than omitting the nuts (only because I didn't have any) and these cookies were delicious.

SOOOO GOOD. I mostly ate it in dough form. I made this really quickly, except that I had trouble with the butter--it was still cold when I put it in the mixer and crumbled. I fixed it by microwaving the mixture (in a different bowl of course)--perfect. I adjusted the recipe for 24 and used 6 tbsp butter, 1/4 cup applesauce--next time I'll try it with more applesauce to make it healthier. I used a little less sugar than called for. Besides that, pretty much followed the recipe to the t. It was nice and rich and gooey and soft--but not painfully sweet. YUM!

I followed the directions exactly, but I used a bag of mint and semisweet morsels instead (and no nuts), and these are hands-down my family's new favorite cookie!  These are really fast to prepare and when served with a tall glass of refreshing milk can't be beat!  THANK YOU.

OMG- If you like cake-like or brownie-like cookies then these are for you! These are THE BEST cookies I have ever had. The only things I changed were using half white sugar and half brown, and half butter half shortening. Simply delicious! Thank you so much! These are a keeper! =)

YUM!! These cookies were the easiest to make, and were a huge hit with everyone! I used holiday M&Ms for festivity. I had to leave them in the oven for a couple extra minutes, but other than that, no changes need be made :) Enjoy!

I recently made these cookies for a cookie exchange party at my office and they were a HUGE hit! The only thing I changed about the recipe is that I used mint chocolate chips instead of the semisweet chocolate chips! The mint was an tasty surprise to everyone and really pleased the palate! I will definitely bake these cookies more often!

LOVED these cookies, but made some modifications.  I sometimes get flat cookies like another reviewer, so I used 1/2 brown sugar in lieu of part of the white sugar.  Good call.  I also substituted chopped Andes Candies for choc chips.  Magnificent!  Next time will experiment with some dried cherries or cranberries with chocolate chips!    Very simple and tasty cookie.

These cookies are delicious. You can't go wrong with chocolate on chocolate. My friends call them "Feel Better" cookies and I'm always being asked to make more! I use chocolate chunks instead of chips, and I'm often baking them longer than 10 minutes.

My picky 16 year-old-daughter begged me for something sweet. So I decided to make her "comfort food" Chocolate chip cookies. The only problem is, I didn't have any brown sugar. I told my daughter I was going to try to make them without the brown sugar. She protested vehemently, we only had one (1) bag of chocolate chips and being that we were stranded in a blizzard in Iowa today with about 3 feet of snow piled up on our deck and wind gusts of 50 mph. I only had one chance to get it right. So I searched All Recipes and came across this recipe.I didn't tell her I was was just going to go for it. Anyway I made them, and added the first cup of flour the batter seemed pretty thick so I tested just one in the oven. I do that on recipes I find, so I don't waste the whole batch, the cookie was thin. So I added the rest of the flour as the reciped had suggested in the first place. The cookies taste excellent and they look perfect, just as another reviewer stated, just like something you would get from the bakery. The only thing I added was an extra 2 tsp of vanilla. My daughter was happy and I am still her hero. I saved the day in this crazy blizzard.

My cookies didn't turn out very well. They were horribly flat and even after baking them 10 minutes they werent cooked in the center. Next time I think I will try half butter and half shortening.

My husband gave them a five, I a four but it is a very good recipe. I do not care for chocolate chips, so I used double the cocoa powder. Any high quality dark cocoa powder will do. I used Dutch brand Bensdorp. Next time I would use no Vanilla extract, triple the cocoa powder and add one extra egg to keep the moisture in, then I would have the perfect moist cookie. I feel Vanilla, especially of the artificial variety, would and did kill this recipe. I won't add it again, it fights the chocolate for attention.

I've made these a few times now and the recipe as-is is excellent. Very chocolately, and soft and tender on the inside, which is the way I like it.   As some reviewers suggested I tried it with half sugar and half brown sugar and this gives a nice depth of flavour. I've also used 1 cup bittersweet chocolate chunks and 1 cup white chocolate chips instead of the nuts to make it a triple chocolate cookie! It's definitely worth a try for all you chocoholics out there =)

Loved them! I left out the nuts and exchanged one of the teaspoons of vanilla for a teaspoon of peppermint extract to give it a minty flavor, and they turned out really well! Definitely a keeper!

really tasty and easy to bake. i went with the half butter and half shortening and that really helped. but unfortunately i overcooked the first batch a little because they didn't look done at 8 minutes, but they turned out a little hard. i took the next batch out earlier and they were great!

my boyfriend is in love w these cookies!.... and so does all my friends. but for the holidays (and since he likes minty flavored stuff) i grind up some candycanes and sprinkle them on top of the cookies before sending it in the oven. the result is a nice soft/chewy cookie and when u get to the candy canes, u get a crunch! NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM!!!!! :-)

These were good cookies, super chocolatey, but they not as good as I expected them to be after reading all the wonderful reviews! They did stay soft for days though, so that was pretty good. I left the walnuts out this time, but if I make again I will be sure to add them. I think they would add a nice taste to the cookie.

Love this recipe! I make it all the time and my friends always beg me to make more!   I only change one thing though: instead of walnuts, I use about 1 cup of reeses pieces (more or less is fine - I don't measure it). The extra peanut butter kick is AMAZING.   My roommate even claimed that they were the best cookies she had ever had (she's a huge chocolate/peanut butter lover). Try them! They're so quick and easy to make too!

These are the most amazing cookies I've ever made. I did, however, take out the walnuts and make it half semi-sweet chips and half white-chocolate chips, to mimick Otis Spunkmeyer's cookies of this similar flavor. Everyone I make them for goes NUTS and becomes addicted!!!!

These are so good! I didn't have large egg so I use jumbo and I did 1 cup semisweet chocolate chip and 1 cup white chocolate chip. they came out moist.I lower the oven to 325 since; I had a dark nonstick baking sheet (i also use parchment paper). This is my first time baking chocolate chocolate chip cookies and they taste better than at the store!

I tried this recipe with White Chocolate Chips. It was excellent. Also if you drop the cocoa powder, I found that they result is also very good, not too sweet but just sweet enough so that you don't regret it later ;P. Still though simply amazing! I could barely manage to have one when I served them to my friends.

Love them, love them, love them.  This made enough to last our family at least for a week (since my husband is on a diet)otherwise they would have been gone in 2 days.  Great for kids school lunches, etc...  Will definately make these again.

These are awesome!  They aren't my favorite since they are SO chocolatey, but the chocoholics can't get enough.  I baked them for 10 minutes and they were still perfectly chewy--more like a brownie than a typical cc cookie.  I did use 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar but forgot to try 1/2 shortening for the butter.  Next time I'd like to try white chocolate chips for a change.

Ok so I am completely confident this recipe would be tops without any changes.  Due to limited ingredients, I did make some adjustments.    As suggested I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 crisco.  Then with limited sugar, I used 1/2 cup granulated and 1 3/4 cup powdered.  I omitted the nuts and made these with 2 1/2 cups of mixed chips (semisweet, butterscotch and white chips.)  They came out soooo good, that I would make them with the strange sugar combination again next time, but look forward to trying them again with another combination of chips.  Maybe chocolate and peanut butter.  YUM!

This is a keeper! Tastes like a cookie version of a brownie. I used crisco instead of butter, because I always do in cookies, and I used 1/2 C brown sugar, and 1 cup white sugar, just because it seemed like a good idea. I will be making these again. Thanks for the recipe!

OMG - chocolate!  I cut the sugar with Splenda, that's the only change I made.  I could only eat one and everyone that knows me knows I love all that is chocolate so these are really rich.   Taking them to work tomorrow as I'm afraid most will go to waste since a little goes a long way (good for satisfying your chocolate craving without adding to much to your waistline!).

These cookies were yummy! I made the recipe the same except I added a cup of white chocolate and a cup of dark chocolate chips for a little different taste. I recommend it...tastes so good!

Delightful cookies. The semisweet chocolate chips and the chocolate from the cookie give it a dark chocolate flavor for any dark chocolate lovers out there. It was extremely easy to make and definitely worth repeating.

Very good!  I made exactly as written.  At first they had a bitter cocoa taste to them, but the next day they had mellowed and the right amount of chocolate to sweetness...yummy!  Thanks, Kathy!

I made these vegan by substituting Earth Balance shortening for the butter and 3 Tbsp applesauce for the eggs and they came out great!  Super easy recipe with very satisfying results; can't wait to make them again

Meh. Not a bad recipe by any means, but I found them too cocoa-ey. I'll keep using my double-chocolate cookie recipe which uses melted chocolate instead of cocoa.

These were very rich and chocolaty. I followed prev. suggestions used half-brown and half-white sugar, and baked for only 8 minutes to keep them soft. Personally, I prefer a more chewy texture, but these were still a great chocolate fix. If I make them again I'll double the nuts - I hate it when you only get one or two in a whole cookie.

I live in Denver, Colorado (high altitude). My teenage daughters and I made this recipe and we followed all the directions and ingredients exactly. These are some of the best cookies we have had. My brother and his girlfriend also loved them and they are very picky about their sweets.

Really tasty cookies. They have a nice balance of chocolate and aren't too sweet. i took the advice and put the dough in the fridge for an hour before baking and the cookies didn't flatten out. super moist too, people called them 'brookies' b/c they were brownie-like cookies. I'll definitely keep this recipe.

These cookies are just simply amazing. These are by far the best cookie I have ever baked.  I made these with my 2 year old and she loved helping and enjoying the result.  I kept the sugar the same, I used half Crisco and half butter and I only had half the amount of chocolate chips available so I used a broken up Ghirardelli chocolate bar too. Absolute heaven.  I plan to impress and bribe with these!

I made this because I needed chocolate right away, but after starting to mix it up I realized I only had whole wheat flour in the house.  Decided to make it that way anyway, and they tasted great!

These are amazing, especially when you make them as chocolate chocolate chocolate chip chocolate chip.  To do this, use both semi-sweet and dark chocolate chips in equal amounts to meet the chip requirements and use Penzey's natural and Dutch Process cocoas in equal amounts to meet the cocoa requirements.  In my oven they come out at about 8.5 minutes and I put the sheet on the cooling rack to cool it down as quickly as possible.  The cookies stay moist for up to 3 days, if they last that long.

I followed a previous poster's instructions and did half white half brown sugar and half margarine half vegetable shortening.  Turned out great!  Update:  I made these again following the previous notation (except butter instead of margarine).  I also replaced the cocoa with flour this time.  THE BEST CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES I HAVE EVER HAD.

Edited 10/11  Just made these again, this time all butter and actually cut back on the cocoa a bit and added two healthy squirts of Hershey's Syrup and they were AMAZING.  Still 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar.
Previous review:
Amazing.  I did 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening, and 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  I think mine were a little big, made 3 dozen, so I cooked them 9 minutes. My husband, who doesn't have as much of a sweet tooth as me loved them!  That says a lot, will make again.

We made this vegan, with egg replacer instead of eggs.  We also used splenda, not sugar.  We made them a few times and each time they turned out very well!  They were super delicious!  The cookie dough was also really yummy cold/frozen.  We'll definitely keep making them.

Everyone who tried these cookies loved them.  They were thick and chewy, not flat and/or crispy.  I halved the recipe, and instead of using 1 cup of chocolate chips I used 3/4 cup and 1/4 cup white/vanilla chips and no nuts.  I also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar to make the cookies more chewy.   Another reviewer suggested using half butter and half shortening to avoid the cookie flattening out - I used only butter and my cookies turned out fine (I did not chill the dough prior to baking).  They took exactly 10 minutes to bake perfectly.  Also, I don't use vanilla extract for personal reasons - so I just used 1 tsp water.  The next time I make these, which will be soon, I'm going to add coffee - another nice flavour might be orange juice as oranges go nicely with chocolate.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good cookies. I added a little more cocoa and a tad more vanilla for my tastes. They came out perfect!  A little crisp on the edges, nice and soft in the middle.

So tasty! It was hard to stop my family from eating them...I made the recipe exactly as followed, and baked them on parchment paper for easy cleanup. On parchment at least they took at least 10 min.

Good but not great.  I prefer chewy cookies with a little more flavor.  Not sure what this recipe needs, but if I need a chocolate cookie fix, this would probably do the trick.

Made these cookies on Father's day and they were a hit. Followed recipe to the tee and came out with super moist cookies. Just enough chocolate but not overwhelming, will definitely make again. Thank you for the recipe.

Rich, chocolatey flavor!  I substituted as follows: 1 cup sugar + 1/2 cup Splenda; 1 egg, 1/4 cup Egg Beaters; 1-1/2 cups butter + 1/2 cup applesauce.  Also threw in cranberries instead of nuts.

These cookies were great!! Tried to use half shortening and even put the dough in the fridge so prevent having flat cookies but this still did not help. Cookies were still delicious!! They should rename this receipe to "gone in 60 seconds"

These are great!  I didn't have my normal recipe and I found this one.  I used 1/2 c brown sugar and 1 c white sugar.  My old recipe requires the dough to be refrigerated so I put these in the fridge for awhile.  They came out perfectly!  Everyone has been raving about them.  I also noticed that people have had their cookies dry out.  I store mine in tupperware and they are still extremely fresh.  You can also freeze them.  My only complaint is that the recipe doesn't make as many as it says.

First time making cookies- not bad! I used a hand wire whip as I dont have an electic mixer yet, so cant say I mixed the butter and sugar mix to 'light and fluffy'... I put lots of space in between the spoonfuls on the cookie sheet, thinking they would spread out and flatten, but they never did, they stayed nearly exactly as I plopped them out. Keep a good eye on them and dont cook them entirely, undercook, so they cool down soft. Much like a brownie, very chocolately, great with milk...

Mine did NOT turn out flat and I still used unsalted butter! I changed the recipe to 1 1/4 cup of white sugar, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, and added 1 teaspoon of baking powder.

These are very good cookies. My daughter is allergic to milk and eggs and I was able to make these cookies with all of the necessary substitutions (fleischmann's unsalted margarine & shortening, ener-g egg replacer, and Ghirardelli chocolate chips) and they still tasted great! Baked on a silpat for 8 minutes.

VERY CHOCOLATEY AND DELICIOUS. I'm not a big fan of chocolate and i love it. My choco-lover friends can't stop eating these cookies. Made these several times, tried substituting 1/3 of the sugar with brown sugar produces extra 'moistness?' to the cookies and really complements the chocolate. Also love to add white chocolate chips. YUM. Have been succesful cutting the recipe in half. I find that 8 minutes in my oven makes perfect cookies.

Yum! Tastes like a great chocolate chip cookie. Very moist and the perfect amount of chocolate and sweetness. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used mini chocolate chips and cut the recipe in half. I got about 30 cookies.

Taste like brownies! I cooked them for 8 minutes then pulled them out of the oven and let them rest on the aluminum foiled pan until the next batch came out.   Amazing with half marg and half butter.

I am writing more in hopes to get help. I can't get the cookies to be soft, chewy or at least have a shape of a chewy cookie. My cookies always flat out, the moment they get hot in the oven I Just watch them get as flat as a disc. I try to put more flour but didn't help much. Can anyone give me suggestions? What am I doing wrong? Help!

These are awesome! The only thing I did differently was substituted 1/2 cup of the white sugar for brown sugar to make the cookies softer. They almost have the consistency of a brownie, so good!

Quite the tasty cookie!  I didn't add the nuts as I didn't have any and they turned out delicious.  Will add white chips next time for a nice contrast.

These were very good.  I halved the recipe and ended up with 14 cookies.  Cookies were very rich, very chocolaty, very soft.  I took some other advice listed here and cut the sugar with brown sugar. The only detraction was that the cookies came on really strong.  Milk to cookie ratio was 1 glass to 1 cookie.  I might reduce the cocoa powder, sugar, and butter in the next round.

This is now my 14 year old daughter's "signature" recipe!  Best cookie i've every tasted.  My daughter omits the nuts and uses vanilla chips instead of chocolate. YUMMY!

I just made these and love them. They came out a little soft - just the way I love my cookies. I also appreciated a chocolatey recipe that didn't use melted bakers chocolate which can add up.

I made this recipe tonight, and it was AMAZING! The edges were chewy and the middle was soft and chocolatey.  I did not use walnuts and I substituted half of the semi-sweet chips for white chocolate chips, which was a perfect complement to the semi-sweet chocolate.  A definite keeper!!

Amazing! Everyone loved these - even my friends who "hate chocolate" loved them. I used 1/2 C brown sugar and 1 C white sugar. I also substituted half whole wheat & half regular flour, and I used half butter, half margarine. They even stayed soft for days!

I wasn't too fond of the texture....I used Margarine maybe if that's why but everything else was the same....although I omitted the walnuts didn't think that would make a difference....it was too bland so i added a cup of white chocolate chips.....a bit too soft...

Awesome. Seemed a bit too soft still after 10 minutes so I left the first batch in 13. Those turned out good, but crunchy. I followed the directions for the rest and they turned out soft and chewy. Great recipe! I already printed it out and put it in my recipe box.

I followed this recipe verbatim, and I think that the cookies were probably the best I have ever tasted! PERFECT! The chocolate chips that I used were white chocolate chip, though. So I guess I did change something :/! Oh well, they were still AMAZING!

These are spectacular. My sister made these cookies for me and wow they were delicious, so I went ahead and got the recipe and made some myself. I baked them for 8 minutes and they were nice and chewy. They didn't get hard. I've read a lot of reviews of people saying their hard, maybe they should cover the cookies after their baked so they don't get hard. I did the recipe exactly as it says.   Thanks!

I decided to try this recipe because of the high rating, and because I am a chocoholic.  The recipe was followed exactly, except for the addition of chopped dried berries. (Love them with chocolate!)    I am somewhat disappointed, as ours seem "dry" in the mouth, though the cookie is not overbaked or stale.  It also has an aftertaste that we can't quite place, but it is slightly bitter and unleasant.    The real statement came last night.  I wanted a snack, and knew these were in the kitchen, but opted for a piece of candy instead.  Never happens with me and cookies!  I don't think we'll make these again...

these are VERY rich, but very good! they tend to work better when made smaller, and i actually used a bit less butter than the recipe calls for, but the cookie didn't suffer from it due to the added chocolate chips.

Mexican Chocolate Cookies: I wanted to bring dessert for a Cinco de Mayo dinner at our church, so I took this basic recipe and added 1 tsp. cinnamon. I didn't have chocolate chips in the house, but I had 4 squares of semi sweet chocolate, which I chopped up and mixed in. I left out the walnuts (I don't think they eat too many walnuts in Mexico). Anyway, the cookies came out very good...with just a hint of cinnamon, which is how I like Mexican hot chocolate. This is an interesting variation on a great recipe.

Perfect for my chocoholic husband; he could not stop oooh-ing and ahhh-ing! I followed the recipe exactly and they were anything but dry, even days later. Delicious, delicious, delicious. I have already passed this on to friends and will certainly be making these regularly.

Awesome! For all you vegans out there, I used vegan margarine (Smart Balance) and Ener-G Egg Replacer with Ghiradelli choc chips and these were to die for. They even spread out and looked like a "regular" cookie!:) My hubby had no idea these were vegan!

My daughter and I renamed them brownie cookies because they are that goooooood!!! I used shortening instead of butter and I went 3/4white sugar and 3/4 brown. I found it most helpful to use the beaters when blending the dry into the wet a little at a time. It went in my recipe box :)

I have made these cookies at least 3 times now and they are wonderful! I follow the recipe exactly, then bake them for about 7 minutes. A friend of my husband's was over the first time I made these and he still talks about these cookies months later! This recipe is now in my own favorite recipe book.

Excellent.  I did not change a single thing and they turned out perfect.  We also made a batch to use for ice cream sandwiches.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

ten stars!! these cookies are so AMAZING! i followed someone's suggestion and used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 brown. i also used one cup white chocolate chips. it came to about 60-65 cookies and they sure went fast! i kept them in a airtight jar witha  slice of apple and they stayed so chewy and soft!! love love this recipe and cant wait to make it again! thanks!! FOR ROSE: are your baking trays warm or hot when you put the cookies on? once i made cookies and as soon as the tray came out of the oven i removed the cookies and put the next batch on and they all went very flat..so maybe that could be it? also it might help to chill your cookie dough in the fridge?

unbelievably delicious, these were the best cookies I've EVER had, I'm not even exaggerating I would wake up in the middle of the night with a craving for these, chocolate dough with choc chips with nuts...i added walnuts AND slivered almonds...the most heavenly combination!

these were really easy to make, but my dough seemed kind of dry when all mixed up. The cookies themselves are not bad, but not the best either. I think I may add less flour next time...??

I'm not a chocolate person. Made these during my visit to my boyfriend's, not quite sure what I did different, but the ones I baked kinda spreaded out, not quite anything like the picture showed,  but they still turned out great! Boyfriend and his parents love it, it's all gone in less than a day! Thanks alot for sharing this recipe! =)

There aren't enough stars in the universe to rate this one!  WOW!!  I was out of butter so I used margarine, fearful that would have a negative affect. (It didn't.) Absolutely wonderful in all areas! (taste, texture, ease, convenient ingredients, etc...)  Shame on me if I don't share these.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

Not particularly thrilled with these. Way too cakey. More like a chocolate scone. But chocolate is chocolate so they weren't bad, just more like mini cakes.

Chocolate Heaven!  These were extremely simple to make and turned out fabulous. I did what some of the others suggested in that I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening and 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and they were amazing.  My only suggestion would be to be sure you have a nice big class of cold milk to go along with them!

These cookies are unbelievably good!  I didn't add walnuts, because I was too lazy, but I bet they'd be amazing with them.  I also want to try it with peanut butter chips.  They took a few extra minutes to bake than the recommended 8-10 minutes, and they came out perfect.  I like my cookies soft and chewy, and even with the extra couple of minutes they were still perfect with no crisping.

My family and friends love these cookies. They are especially good when they're warm when the chocolate chips are still gooey. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out wonderful. Just make sure that when you're mixing in the chocolate chips that you don't clump them in one area, else some cookies would be exploding with chocolate while others lack the chocolatey goodness.

This turned out to be a very good cookie. They were sweet and- if you like them like I like them- good and goey. They hardened after they cooled, so don't go over what the time limit was. Even my gooey faliures turned out to be a chewy sucess!

Awesome recipe.  After reading the reviews I used half butter and half shortening.  In an attempt to make this a little more healthy, I used half whole wheat flour and half unbleached all purpose.  I also cut the sugar down to 1 cup and added 3 tbs of milled flax.  As opposed to chocolate chips I used the peanut butter and chocolate swirled chips.  Rave reviews from my health nut hubby and our 4 and 6 yr old niece and nephew.

These cookies are delicious!  If I can make them, anyone can.  I have always been a better cook than a baker.  I have found that if you change the servings to 24, they turn out much better.  If I do the full amount, I have to add a little more flour or they are more like brownie mix than cookie dough and are too runny to get off the pan.  Thank you for the recipe, it is now a family favorite.

Terrific recipe. First time i tried to make cookies and had them work out! I halved the recipe and used hot cholocate mix instead of cocao (most likely just made it more sugary).  Excellent!

I loved these cookies! I didn't use the Walnuts, I'm not a big nut fan. And I was about 1/4cup short on the cocoa but they still turned out awesome!

Excellent cookies!  I cut the butter to 1-1/2 sticks and it turned out great!  I also added 1/2 cup white chocolate chips to make them triple chocolate chip cookies.  Best cookies ever!

I followed the recipe exactly - although I added a few more chocolate chips than absolutely necessary - and these cookies turned out delicious!  They were very, very chocolatey and chewy. Definitely a good chocolate cookie recipe.

I made a half batch and still got over 2 dozen cookies. I also lowered the amount of sugar and chocolate chips and found them still sufficiently sweet. This recipe is a keeper!

These cookies are AWESOME!!! I did sub. 1/2C. of brown sugar instead of all white. I also used all butter. I put the batter in the fridge for about 2 hours before I baked them. 
I made these for my son's 1st grade class so I used M&M's instead of chips. Wow, they are so good, they have the brownie texture! Wonderful!

Got lots of good reviews on this one. Used a double dutch dark chocolate cocoa powder for it which made the batter very rich and dark. It was a little sweet for my taste, but that must just be me because everyone else seemed to think they were awesome.  Thanks for sharing.

These are the best cookies!  I added 1/2 tsp. salt instead of 1/4 and I also used 2 cups milk chocolate chips, 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1/2 cup miniature semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Absolutely AMAZING!!!  I also had some left over buttercream frosting from my daughter's birthday cake and made a few cookie sandwiches...very good!  I used the recipe for Rick's Special Buttercream Frosting on allrecipes.

I substitued the butter with one cup of mashed banana and the sugar with half splenda, half powdered suger. The cookies came out great! And it was nice having a lower fat version of such a tasty delight.

This recipe was amazing.  I made it exactly as written, except I used Andies Chips instead of chocolate chips, so they were chocolate-mint chip cookies.  I made them over the holidays, and people are still asking for them!  GREAT.

Perfect for those days when you just NEED chocolate, because this cookie has plenty of it, and it's quick and easy.  I love that it has cocoa in it instead of melted chocolate, because I always have cocoa powder and never have chocolate!  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and changed half the sugar to brown sugar, and it turned out great.

Great tasting cookie! I may have overcooked them a bit (thinking that they were undercooked at 11 minutes..wasn't thinking that they'd harden up) but they are still perfect! Lots of chocolate flavor!!

LOVE THIS RECIPE!! The cookies lasted a day in my house.  I substituted the butter for shortening and used leftover toblerone chocolate bar (shredded 1 3/4 cup) for the chocolate chips.  The result was incrediable,  Highly recommend this recipe.

Really great super chocolatey cookies!  They're very different than a typical cookie, almost cake-like.  To cut down the fat and calories, I used half splenda, half sugar, and half butter/ half applesauce, but be sure to beat in the applesauce later, just before you add in the dry ingredients.  Applesauce will only create a weird texture if beaten too much.  I made one batch with white chips, and the other with dark chips and mini M&Ms.  Delicious!

This is my favorite cookie recipe!  I love to make them with the mini York Peppermint patties instead of chocolate chips.  They're hard to find, but if I look hard at Christmas time I can find a few bags and stock up for these cookies.  Otherwise, Andes mint pieces would be great too!

*WOW!!!* These are amazing! I followed the recipe exactly, except I substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of white to make them extra chewy.  I also underbaked them to make sure they were really gooey. I had to flatten them down with a fork a bit when they were about halfway done, but they turned out fantastic!  This recipe is really decadent and delicious. Highly recommended.

I'm not even a fan of chocolate chocolate chip cookies, and I loved these. I made a batch of these and another of regular chocolate chip cookies, and these were so much better that although I started out with the same number of both kinds of cookies, my friends plowed through these much quicker. I am going to make myself another batch, and may or may not share! 

I didn't make any changes to the recipe, and had no problems at all. The dough seemed oddly sticky when I was getting ready to bake (after having chilled for a day), but they came out fine and rose beautifully.

Very delicious recipe!!! Highly recommended. The cookies are very soft, moist, and chewy. They go great with a tall glass of milk or even coffee. They certainly satisfy any craving for chocolate!!! Great Cookies!

These cookies are crazy good- I make them 2-3 times a week. They're great plain, but they're even better with chocolate pieces and pecans mixed in. I took a sweet chocolate bar and crumbled it in, and reduced the sugar by a fourth of a cup to offset the chocolate's sweetness. They're perfect. I usually put about 1/4-1/2 tsp more of vanilla, or add in almond extract. The almond extract gives them a subtly different flavor which I l-o-v-e. Happy Baking!

Wow!! These are awesome! I used .5 cup brown sugar for part of the white. I also used .5 cup shortning and .5 cup butter instead of all butter. I also used 1 cup choco chips ans 1 cup toffee pieces. These were a great rich chocolate flavor and didn't last long. They really do taste just like a store bought cookie.

Double stacked them in the oven and burnt those on the bottom rack.  Turned down the heat a little and extended the time.  Cookies were delicious.

These cookies were incredible! I've only made cookies from scratch once before and these turned out sooo good. I used dark chocolate chips and peanut butter chips instead of just semi-sweet chips and had to substitute baking powder (looked it up on about.com for conversion). They were so moist for days afterward! Even leaving the bag open (oops). They did need to baked longer than the 10 minutes suggested though.

I followed the other suggestions to do half brown and half white sugar and the cookies were kind of flat, but chewy in the center.  Definitely better after a few hours rather than right out of the oven.

I've experimented quite a bit with this recipe changing up the chips, sugar, butter/margarine/shortening, and choice of cocoa.  I have to say it is incredibly flexible!  My personal favorite is all butter, white sugar Ghiradelli Unsweetened Cocoa and bittersweet chips with a tall glass of milk! I know they stay perfectly chewy for 2.5 days, but never had any last longer than that!

Really great, basic chocolate cookie recipe! It has a pretty fine crumb and a very rich, chocolate flavor. I used milk chocolate candy bars chopped into chunks, so it ended up sweeter than it would have been with semi-sweet chocolate chips, but it was still great. They don't spread much at all, so you can pretty much crowd the baking pan, leave them about an inch and a half apart, and you can use a tbsp rather than tsp for those big, chewy "Starbucks" cookies that everyone loves. Yum! I'll be making this recipe for my chocolate-loving mom soon, but I'll add some toasted hazelnuts to the batter (Nutella impersonation =D).

Since you can make this recipe with ingredients most cooks typically have on hand, it's a quick and easy remedy for a chocolate fix.  I also liked the "cakey" rather than crunchy texture.

Update.  Made these again, using Hershey's Special Dark cocoa.  WOW were they chocolaty!  I used all the left-over chips in my cupboard, white, dark, butterscotch.  Yummy, but WOW - Maybe use 1/2 dark and 1/2 regular cocoa.  Original Review: These are great cookies.  Like others, I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  I found caramel chips, intended for melting for caramel apples, but used them in place of chocolate chips and they were yummy!  I think they'd be great with any type chips, or none at all.  The next day they are still chewy and good in my cookie jar.  I did have to let them sit on the cookie sheets to cool quite a while, but that could be the caramel.  This cookie is a keeper!

Followed the recipe as it is. This was full of chocolate and very very good! Will keep and make again! I did add 1 C semi sweet and 1 C white chocolate chips because I ran out of the semi sweet, but of course it was still amazing! Chocolate lovers will love this cookie! Very soft and great warm.

These were fantastic!  I, too, substituted half shortening/half butter, and used part brown sugar.  I also added a splash of super strong coffee instead of vanilla.  I made these for about 30 coworkers for Christmas, so I chopped up some peppermint bark and threw that in instead of chocolate chips.  Will definitely make again.

I used 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar. I also used 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips and 1 cup white chocolate chips. The multicolored chips made the cookies look even prettier. Instead of making 48 small cookies, I made 18 large cookies, which I baked for 15 minutes at 350 degrees F. They turned out perfect: chewy in the middle and crisp on the edges. These cookies don't spread much if your butter is fairly cold. Make sure you beat the butter and sugar together long enough so that the mixture becomes light and fluffy; this step ensures that the texture of the cookie will be perfect. Overall, this recipe is wonderfully easy and produces delicious cookies. I'll definitely be using it again and again.

These are the best chocolate cookies I've ever made, and I bake a lot!  Texture is perfect, 8 minute baking time is perfect in my oven.  I did remove them immediately from the pans, otherwise they stuck a bit.  But delicious and a bit hit with my husband who said "ummmmmmm" when I asked!  Make 'em!

These were awesome!!  I couldn't find the time to bake them, so they ended up refrigerated for 2 days, but they still baked up wonderfully.  Everyone loves them!!  Also, I did do 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening as suggested and took them out at exactly 8 minutes.  These are perfect cookies.

I have a family of chocoholics and was tired of paying so much for some of the great store cookies ($4 per dozen).  Made this batch of cookies using 1/2 Cup of brown sugar and the remaining in white sugar.  WHAT A HIT!!!!!!  I intentionally left them out overnight to see if they would remain moist, chewy and so delectable.  At 5AM today, I had 2 with coffee - how wonderful.  Other than the change in sugars, I followed the recipe exactly and baked for 8 minutes.  Came out just perfect.  This recipe will be a "keeper" in my collection.  Thanks.

Delicious. I used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate, and omitted the nuts. They did not spread out much and came out thick and plump. They are so soft and chewy. Yum! I have a feeling these are gonna disappear quickly.

These were ok.  Not as soft and chewy as I like.  I also didn't have baking soda so I used powder and used white chocolate chips.  I'll have to keep messing with it.

Wasn't overly impressed after such high ratings. But, found out that if you eliminate nuts and double the chocolate chips they come out MUCH better!

These cookies have an excellent flavor; however, they did not turn out chewy and soft but more like a sugar cookie in texture - very thin and crisp due to spreading while baking.  I added white chocolate chips and peanut butter chips, and they tasted great, too!  My only complaint is the texture and spreading - other than that, perfect!

Really good cookies.  I used half white chocolate chips and half semi sweet would have been better if I used all semi sweet chips.

Whoa! Super Chocolaty! (Never a bad thing!) Incredibly addicting. Almost brownie-like texture.  The only thing I did differently was half brown sugar / half white sugar.  Will make a wonderful addition to the Xmas cookie platter!

Excellent cookie!  Followed suggestions and used half butter, half shortening.  Also, half sugar and half brown sugar.  I also subbed in cake flour for the all purpose and they were very light and well shaped.  Thanks for sharing!

Every time I make these cookies (which is more than I should), I am amazed. They get eaten too fast. One of the recipes where the actual cookie tastes better than the dough. We sometimes keep a frozen roll, and when the need arises, cut off a few pieces and bake them in our toaster oven! So fresh and delicious! Thank you!

Now I know what to make to cure a chocolate craving! These are FANTASTIC! The whole family gobbled 'em up in no time! They are extra yummy with good quality cocoa powder and white chocolate chips.  I would give them more than 5 stars if I could.

Awesome!  I love cooking but baking is a challenge for me...I bought fresh soda for this and it rocks.  BF insisted on butterscotch chips (ugh...way too sweet), but I'm still eatin em!  Gonna try with dried banana chips and white chocolate chips...thank you much for a cookie that I can actually serve without apologizing for something!

yummy, cakey chocolate cookies. Just what I was looking for. =) only change I made was to decrease the sugar to 2/3 cup and halved the chocolate chips b/c it seemed like an awful lot.

These cookies are amazing!! I used spread instead of butter because I didn't have any. Also, I used white chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate swirled chips instead. The result? A deliciously rich chocolate cookie.

These were AWESOME.  The only thing I changed was to use 1 c of white sugar and 1/2 c of brown sugar.  I also used white chocolate chips instead of chocolate.

Made them this morning and they're almost gone already!  They're sweet and buttery, so so so good.  I'll definitely make them again.

This recipe turned out perfect. I was looking for a quick super chocolately cookie for my boyfriend, and they were just like making chocolate chip cookies. They even looked extra amazing. I cooked them exactly as described. They stayed soft (even sitting out on the table) for days.

Very chocolaty! Very good. nice and soft & chewy. But I had a problem with the batter being so thick I couldn't mix in the chips. Had to add a little bit of oil & water. Also, they were very good, but something seemed to be missing.

This is one of those awesome cookie recipes.  They were great even without the nuts but will add them next time.  It was like eating the most mouth watering piece of yummy chocolate sensation in just one cookie...of course who could eat just one!  Thanks so much.

I took the suggestions to use half butter/half margarine and half white sugar/half brown sugar. I also used half semi sweet/half white chocolate chips and one cup of walnuts. THESE ARE FABULOUS WITH MILK!!!! I actually cooked them for 9-10 minutes, and they were perfect, not hard and have stayed perfect for several days (in container).

OMG!  I love them!  I was looking for a festive looking cookie so I baked mine with reese pieces on the top instead of the choco chips.  The batter smelled so good while I was baking it that I couldn't resist nibbling it.  The oven I am using is a little off kilter so the ones that I didn't bake on a baking stone turned out a little too done on the bottom.  That said, this is the first thing that I have baked in this oven that came out so well!

I omitted the nuts, but the cookies were awesome!  I served them warm with vanilla and chocolate ice cream.  The cookies are chocolaty but not too sweet.  The whole family enjoyed!

Delicious!  I'm not so big on chocolate but these are irrestistable.  I stayed true to recipe, and they came out perfect first try.  I just hope they stay soft and chewy.

Yum! I used white chocolate chips, and they turned out great! The only change I will make next time, if I again use white chocolate, is to decrease the sugar by maybe a 1/4 cup.

as it says under 5 stars, these were "the Best" cookies i've ever made. i thought, as a beginning cook, that they might not turn out quite as good on the first try, but they were totally amazing. i also substituted half of the butter for crisco and that worked great. take them out after 8 minutes! they'll still be soft, but then when they start to cool they won't get hard even the next day. i highly recommend these to any level cooking enthusiast

Excellent!  Just what I was looking for in a cookie. Wonderful flavor, moist and chewy.  

I actually didn't strictly follow the recipe.  I didn't have the coco powder so I omitted it, but I did use everything else exactly as the recipe stated.  

In case others want to know, I used this recipe to make cookie bars, instead of individual cookies and it came out great!

I just put all the batter into a 9x13 pan and cooked for 3o minutes.  It did come out a tiny bit undercooked, but I actually like it that way so I'm not complaining.  :)

WOW! I am not done baking these and have already eaten THREE! They are divine. I was looking for a chocolate cookie to add Andes mint chips to and this was perfect. I almost subbed peppermint extract for the vanilla but changed my mind last minute and am glad I did-they are nice and chocolatey with plenty of mint from the chips. I followed other reviewer suggestions and baked for exactly 8 minutes and removed them from the pan immediately. No problems with sticking or anything. Can't vouch for how long they keep but I can assure you it will be a non-issue. They will be gone within 24 hours.

These are very, very good right out of the oven. They seem to get stale fast. I'd suggest freezing the dough and baking just a few at a time.

These cookies are dangerous. I can't stop eating them. They are SO good, so much better than I've ever had from any bakery. I subbed 1/2 C. brown sugar for white sugar, and used 1/2 C. Criso to replace 1/2 C. butter.
10 minutes and truly amazing, the best cookie I've ever had.

This is a great chocolate cookie recipe. I used shortening in place of butter & I used 1 Cup Semi-Sweet chocolate chips and 1 Cup Reeses Pieces candy. The peanut butter and chocolate are great! Peanut butter chips would work too but I used what I had at home. I will keep this recipe to make again. It was quick and easy to whip up a batch. I also got 60 good size cookies out of this.

these cookies need a little more flattning.beacause you only need to bake the for 8 to 10 minets.so here what you do,get all the dough and put it on the cookie platei thingi then before you put it in the oven,get a flat edged cup. then SMOOSH IT ALL UP but not too much. and then bake 14 minets.

These cookies are AMAZING!!! As a lot of people seem to have, I also used white choc chips. I have made them three times this week for various people and every time they have been eaten within minutes! I have been asked for the recipe so many times already! Will definitely be making them again!

Very nice and easy to make cookie, and very very soft. Although not the best looking cookie, it certainly is tasty! UPDATE: I have come to realise that soft cookies come from cookies with higher butter contents and by 'undercooking' the cookie. You must also remove the cookie from the heat source immediately. I bake my cookies for 8 minutes exactly and they are like store bought soft batches!

These cookies were by far, some of the BEST cookies I have ever made. I have my stand-by best ever chocolate chunk cookies but really wanted something different for a farwell party. These didn't make the party..the were gone way before the party started. I used about 1/3 c. white chocolate chips, about 1c. of milk chocolate chips and some dark chocolate bar that I chopped up. So this was the chocolatiest cookie ever. My hubby said the were dangerous because they were so addictive!! That is HUGE coming from my hubby. Thanks for this...it is a keeper!!

Really good recipe!  Instead of regular chocolate chips, I added all the remnants of fancy swirled chips and peanut butter chips that were in the freezer.  Also, being that I live in New Mexico, I had to add 3/4 tsp of Chimayo Chipotle Red Chile to the batter...for a subtle hint of spice!

Brilliant! I have finally found the perfect cookie recipe for my chocoholic boyfriend. These are like little brownie/cookies from heaven. I followed the recipe exactly, and everything turned out swell. I'm thinking next time I might throw in some dried cherries and walnuts- although I'm sure chocholics will love this recipe just as it is.

My husband tasted these and said "These are the best cookies I've ever had!"  Not bad for a REALLY picky eater!  Personally, I would have liked a sweeter taste to them, and will probably use milk chocolate chips next time.  The biggest thing is that he liked them!!

Fabulous!  I did not use any nuts and threw in a combination of milk chocolate and semi sweet chips (about 3 cups total).  Very good!

I made these for my Spanish class for a project, and everybody wanted more! This is probably my favorite cookie recipe. 
Also: somebody made similar cookies to these but she added both milk chocolate and white chocolate, and they were so good! I'm going to add white chocolate next time!

These are truly outstanding! Since we like chewy cookies around here, I will be sure to only bake them for 8 minutes next time. We left the first batch in an extra two minutes because they didn't look done. Big mistake! The first dozen was too dry. Eight minutes should be perfect.

These are absolutely delicious!!  The only thing I changed was lowering the amount of white sugar to one cup, and adding a half cup of brown sugar.  The cookies came out perfectly after eight minutes. Very chocolate, moist, sweet, and brownie-like.  My kids and I love them.

Sooo yummy!  Rich, lucious flavor - definitely for the chocoholic!  I experimented with half choc chips and half white choc chips, and they turned out really well, it helped to cut what could have maybe been too much chocolate -- although, can you ever really have too much?

Fantastic recipe. I went a little overboard when spooning them out so they all merged together into one giant cookie in the end, hehe, but still a brilliant soft cookie taste that I'll be sure to make again.

These are very good.  They are moist with a bit of crunch.  I did have to press them down a little. They didn't flatten at all when baking.

You can't go wrong with this much chocolate flavor!  I omitted the nuts and used a good cocoa powder and Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate Chips - heavenly!  I made mine a little on the large size and ten minutes baking time was perfect.

My personal opinion on these cookies was that they were disgustigly rich and overpoweringly sweet. But I brought them to a 4th of July event and they were a hit (especially with little kids), so I'll give this recipe 5 stars. Something I would definitely make for company, but not for my family...we don't have a taste for incredibly rich and sugary things. Thanks though.

These brookies or crownies, as we call them at work, are the best cookie we have ever had. We can't decide if they are cookies or brownies, but either way...i bake these for everyone's birthday and have become the greatly anticipated birthday treat.

Good, but I would quite say amazing.  I wasn't quite happy with the texture of the final cookie.  (I used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate ones.)  I will try it again, though.

I was looking for a recipe I could adapt to make mint chocolate chip cookies, and this worked perfectly.  Add 2 tbsp creme de menthe liqueur, and two packages of chopped up Andes mints instead of the chocolate chips.  They might need to cook for an extra minute with the additional liquid.  Both the original version and my doctored version got rave reviews!

I was short flour, so mine turned out flat.  The flavor was great, and next time I'll make sure I have enought ingredients!  Thanks for sharing.  Second time I had enough flour--these taste like the best brownie you've ever had.  YUMMERS.  Total keeper recipe.

Absolutely wonderful cookies. No changes needed. One time I didn't realize that I was out of chocolate chips until I was ready to add them, so I went without.  My husband acted like I had broken some kind of law, but he still ate half the batch.  I take these cookies over to friends houses and they request them over and over again.

These are the absolute best chocolate chocolate chip cookies EVER. I've been making them for about six or seven years now and people ask for the recipe every time. They also turn out wonderful with mint or peanut butter chips.

I used whole wheat flour instead of white, decreased the cocoa powder by a bit, and used dark chocolate chips mixed with semi-sweet, but my boyfriend has declared these the best cookies that I've ever made.  Great recipe!

Mmmm! These are AWESOME!! Very rich and chewy! Just how I like 'em. These cookies are very yummy with white chocolate chips added. I bet they would be great without anything added as the cookie itself is really, really good!

The texture was great but I have to say, even as a chocolate lover, this had way too much cocoa. I dont know if I would make this recipe again but if I did, I would probably cut the cocoa by 1/3-1/2.

This is a great one!  The dough is so soft.  I switched things up a bit by replacing sugar with 'splenda' (same measurements)and used mint chocolate chips (2 1/2 cups).  They turned out excellent.

There's no denying that these are good, but whoah, they are so rich! I mean, so rich that I couldn't enjoy an entire cookie! I didn't have walnuts, so I skipped that. I did use 1 1/2 cups semisweet chips and 1/2 cup white chocolate chips, but that was just because that's all I had in my cupboards. :)

Pretty faultless really. Easy to make, and not as stiff to mix as I exected, but a little thick. I only had about 100g or so of chocolate chips left, so just used that. Next time I will add a little less cocoa. Easy made more than 24 cookies, but I like them small. Great cookies, nice texture! Thank you.

I made these cookies exactly how the recipe said, they came out perfect. Everyone that tries them can't stop eating them, even the ones that don't like sweets. I would recommend them to any one.

Excellent cookies. I did not expect them to turn out as good as they did, perfectly chewy and chocolately.
I will make these for the rest of my cookie baking life!

Thank you so much for this amazing recipe. My boyfriends family was in town and they had a big family bbq. I figured since they were doing all the cooking, why don't I make some sort of dessert. Since my boyfriend loves chocolate chip cookies I decided to be brave and try making them from scratch for a change and your recipe was so easy to follow that I was done in no time. 
They loved them!!! I added one ingredient to your recipe which was  some hershey's chocolate syrup and I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. The cookies were all eaten up by the next morning. I barely had one myself lol. I didn't mind though because it was such a big hit with the family that my boyfriend gave me some sugar of his own. So thank you again :)

My son wanted me to make these for his birthday but wanted peanut butter chips instead.  Everyone loved them.  I used less butter and they turned out great.  I used my mixer since the dough it thick.  I would definitely make these again...and again.

These were really tasty, no doubt. But the batter is another story! Mine was so thick that I couldn't even stir it, so I had to blend with a hand mixer for a minute just to get it mixed up. My arm got a workout for sure. They also don't spread, but come out sort of thick and chunky. As someone else wrote, they are almost like a brownie. They are very tasty tho and definitely the answer to any craving for chocolate you might have. They are rich, chocolately and decadent. Served these at my sister's wine party, and everyone loved them.

this is the most amazing cookie recipe ever!! Everyone ive given them to begs me for more.  A while back someone suggested using white and brown sugar 2 to 1 which is what i do everytime.  Also for the person who had a problem bcuz they were too soft...while one batch is cooking i put the next batch(on the sheet)in the fridge until the timer goes then i just keep switching the cookie sheets up till done.  This should be done with all chocolate chip cookies.  It makes them even chewier and they hold together better abd longer.  Thx for the GREAT RECIPE.

Wow!  These cookies are wonderful!  The boyfriend LOVED them and said they're even better than his favorites at a local bakery! They don't keep well and are best eaten within 24-36 hours...don't worry, they won't last that long!

This is an amazing recipe!  Everyone I shared the cookies with were amazed at how soft and delicious they were. 

Instead of the walnuts, I added the same amount of toffee chips instead--it gives them a great crunch!  This last time I also added some dried cranberries for some extra chewiness...and so I can pretend that they're healthy.  :-)

To deal with the stickiness, I just put the dough in the fridge between batches--it hardened up enough to work with, but it didn't compromise the flavor or consistency.

Overall, these cookies are the best.  Both times I've made them, I've done a double recipe...and they're still gone within two days!

At first when the cookies came out of the oven they were absolutely great, and they tasted chocolaty and delicious. However after only a day the cookies turned hard a began to crumble away into something that the kids I baby sat and my friends just wouldn't eat. These are better to be eaten with in a day of making them...

I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate chips instead of semisweet and used half brown sugar, half white. Took longer to cook, I'd say about 15 minutes. I halved the recipe and it made 17 good-sized cookies. Delish!

These cookies were awesome... I made them for a weekly morning meeting we have at our house and they had many compliments.  By noon, nobody wanted to eat the lunch we served because they had eaten too many cookies!  I will definitely make them again...

I made a reduced-fat and healthier version, which I absolutely love!  I use only 1/2 cup of butter and then a 1/2 cup of water (I'd like to try applesauce too).  I also did not add chocolate chips the first time I made them because I did not have any.  My roommates and I love the cookies without the chips as they are not overly sweet and contain a very low calorie content for cookies.  We make them frequently now!

THESE WERE ABSOLUTELY DELICOUS!! yummmm! They came out so perfect....just the right texture and everything! They come out really dark (and taste better in my opinion) if you use Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa. I love this recipe!

These cookies are the best!  I made them for the first time the other day and am in the process of making more.  They were eaten quickly!  They're like brownies in cookie form.  I also subbed half the butter for shortening.  Delicious!  A new favorite in my house.

These were fantastic, I used a bit less butter, maybe 2/3 cup and they still turned out beautiful. It makes so much as well!! I  took a dozen or more to work and they got wolfed down!! Thanks for the fantastic recipe. I also used chopped up Nestle Melts instead of chips (might be a New Zealand only ingredient?)

The cookies were great, just not what I (nor my husband) are used too. I decided to try a different recipe than the one that I usually use to make Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookies. Since this one had such high scores I fugured, what the heck. Nothing wrong with them in general, they were tasty, just a a little more dry (crisp, I can't really say hard, but they were crunchy.) we prefer chewy and a little more dense. I used M&M's instead of chocolate chips. I doubled the batch and took a ton of them to work and they never lasted long!

I added white chocolate chips and pecan chips.(Don't care for walnuts) I wanted the brownie-like cookie so I cooled the dough as suggested on a previous review. Great cookie! Next time I'll try without chocolate chips. They would be perfect with a scoop of ice cream and a little chocolate syrup for a brownie sundae.

Good !
A lighter version of a brownie. Not too sweet which is what we prefer.
A nice variation from just the simple chocolate chip cookie.

Amazing!!!  I made these using Ghirardelli cocoa and used about 1 1/4 cup Andes peppermint crunch baking chips and 1 cup chocolate chunks for the chocolate chips.  Absolutely delcious!  Mine also made about 5 dozen cookies.  Great to share and very festive!

Excellent cookie-but I should have read the reviews first. I learned the hard way that these (at least in my oven) take much more than the 8 minutes...probably the range for my oven is 10-13 minutes. Great cookie though-absolutely delicious!

These cookies are so easy and yummy. I use those dark - non stick - double layer cookie sheets and I had to cook these for 11 min. Everything else was the same. Fantastic! Will definitely make these again.

I debated whether or not to give this recipe five stars.  I ended up taking one off because they don't keep well.  They're best served the day that they're baked.  That said, my friends raved over how good they are. Just be sure NOT to over-bake them!

Great cookies!!!  We doubled the recipe (using half butter and half shortening) and added a bag of York Mini Peppermint Patties and a bag of vanilla chips instead of chocolate chips.  They smelled delicious and baked up great.

These cookies are amazing! I used all vegetable shortening instead of butter since that was all I had onhand, and I beat the shortening, eggs, vanilla and sugar for probably ten minutes to get it as creamy as possible before adding everything else. I put them in for 8 minutes, because I like a softer cookie, and my fiance and I have eaten about half of them already -- and the last batch is still in the oven!

Thanks for a great recipe -- this one's a keeper.

We love this recipe - kind of like brownies, only cookies with a bit of crunch on the edges when they are fresh.  I used a bit less sugar - about 1 1/4 cups and a bit more salt - about 1/2 teaspoon.  They got rave reviews from the employees at my husband's company.

I enjoyed the cookies but they weren't eaten up as fast as I expected. I also experimented and added coconut to half of the batter, but that did not really work out so I would not recommend it.

Raw ingredients to in my tummy in less than 30 minutes!!!  WOW!  these are great.  I had all of the ingredients on hand and I whipped them up in no time.  They have a wonderful flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly except no walnuts.  I also made them big and cooked for about 10 minutes.  I am going to store the dough in the refigerator and make some more tomorrow.  If I make them all now they'll be gone by the time I go to bed!

Easy and taste great.  I went a little heavy on the coca powder.  Mine did end up flattening as they cooled.  I think they were cooked perfectly at 9 minutes…maybe I went too light on the baking soda.  I was out of vanilla so I used almond extract, I think this helped give them such a great flavor.

Fantastic! I made these following the recipe exactly and they are awesome cookies. They are very fudge like and the dough is very thick to work with... but the results are totally worth it. Next time i will add a teaspoon of espresso powder to the dough just because i like coffee with chocolate- but they are perfect as is!! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Very tasty recipe, works well with mint chips or alone as just a chocolate cookie! A big hit, my husband loved them.

I have been using this recipe for ages now - just love it.  Today I added some crushed chiles after the chips.  Wow!  I am addicted to a local restaurants chocolate chile dessert, and I always look for chile chocolates when I am in specialty stores.  Finally I can get my fix at home.

I made these last night and they are amazing. I cut the recipe in half and I added white chocolate chunks and raisins. I also added a drop of water at the end as the mixture was so dense.
Had to cook them for 12mins, think that was probably my oven though! 
They turned out lovely and moist, perfect! Thanks for a great recipe.

THese cookies were so undeniably rich and delicious that even my health-nut mother, who is usually only interested in things if they're healthy, asked for the recipie. They are very much like brownies, so are best if left very soft, a little underdone.

Wonderful cookie for chocolate lovers.  You need some big biceps to stir in those chocolate chips and nuts!  I ended up with 60something cookies.  My only change was I used 1 cup white sugar and half cup brown sugar.  I cooked them 9 minutes, at 8 minutes they were a little too soft for me.

These tasted too much like cocoa powder to me and I love chocolate. The texture was nice and soft once baked but the dough is pretty hard to mix by hand.

Delicious!!  Mine didn't come out quite as fluffy as the ones in the picture but I think it's because I took them out too early.  Still incredibly delicious!!!  Better than any you could buy in the store.

Excellent!  I used 2 cups (200g) of chopped, 72% cocoa chocolate and 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips instead of the walnuts.  Half raw sugar and half demerara (loose).  They taste awesome!

These cookies are delicious! However, I added about 1/4 cup more flour than the recipe called for. I also had to bake the cookies for 3 minutes longer than the recipe stated. Overall this recipe is great.

I loved these. Pumpkin is my favorite muffin flavor and the glaze gives it just the right sweetness.  I followed the recipe exactly except the glaze I didn't measure the ingredients I just used the sugar and orange to my own consistency.

Good cookies! I was craving brownies, but didn't want to wait for them to cook, so I made these and they gave me the same taste in less than half the time. Yummy!  - I omitted the chocolate chips, as I didn't have any, but I can imagine they would've been even better with!

Yummy!  Very chocolate-y... almost too much (and this is coming from a major choco-holic).  I've made these several times and I cut the amount of chocolate chips in half, and double the walnuts which seems to balance the flavours  better.

These truly were A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! I made them and within a few hours, every one of them had been eaten. I had guests for souper and each guest ate about 10 cookies each, loll... They're actually "dangerous", this is deffinatly a keeper... But I won't be making them too often; not unless intend on gaining 100 pounds or so... =P One word describes them best: irresistable.

These cookies are really wonderful.  Nice and soft.  Great chocolate flavor.  I used mini chocolate chips instead of large chocolate chips. I think they made the cookies even better. They tasted just like a brownie!!

These are my boyfriend's absolute favorite cookies!  I think I make a batch every week for him!  I've also tried them with skor pieces and also with white chocolate chips (so that way they're triple chocolate cookies!)

Sooooo good I serve them to my friends at bring-a-plate parties. They love them andso do I, I almost can't bear to give them away. I like to make them with white chocolate chunks instead of plain choc chips. A beautiful contrast and extra tempting.

If you need a good dose of chocolate, these cookies are for you!  We make these regularly using 1/2 white chips and 1/2 chocolate chips.  These cookies are very rich, almost fudgy.  They sure are yummy.

i made half the recipe, put extra cocoa, white chocolate chips, and macadamia nuts in it. i guess the extra dry ingredients stopped my cookie from spreading at all. they weren't that chocolatey flavored,  was it because i used nestle baking cocoa?

Totally awesome recipe! I took a batch to work and they were gone in the first ten minutes. I must say that near the end they are a little hard to stir but they make for a wonderful, not too sweet cookie!
Thanks

This is the best chocolate chocolate chip cookie recipe I have found! I like to use peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips from time to time, they are to die for! Also, white chocolate chips are good.

Wonderful!!!  Used Hershey's Cocoa, baking 9 minutes on the middle oven shelf was perfect timing, and they remained moist for days after.  Single-layer store in a sheet cake-sized tupperware container to avoid crumbling - NOT ZIPLOC bags!! My only complaint..... cannot eat just ONE!!!

These cookies are GREAT and I followed the recipe almost exactly.  The only changes I made were that I unknowingly was out of vanilla and had already started making them.  I was going to just leave it out, but the batter is very stiff and was difficult to stir by hand (I'll probably use a mixer next time) so I added a splash of milk.  The other change that I made was I used 3/4 C chocolate chips & 1 1/4 C Reese's Pieces!!  Delicious!!  I will definitely be making these again- family & friends LOVED them.   I also noticed that they didn't seem to spread very much, so I could fit 12-15 cookies on a tray (although it didn't quite make 4 dozen).  Great recipe- THANK YOU!!  :o)

Wonderful recipe for chocolate chocolate chip cookies! The cookies are soft and yet still have a bit of crunch, and they're very tasty. These cookies were a hit with my family and people at my husband's office when I made them for an office party. They were also excellent when I tried them at the holidays with peppermint chips instead of the chocolate chips. (As a side note, I don't use the optional walnuts when I made these.) I would highly recommend this recipe!

I have been using this recipe for 2 years now. They are a favorite in my family. I usually make them as directed, but this year I have a request for white chocolate chips.

5 star recipe!

This is my favorite cookie so far.  The first time they were made, was by my 11 year old daughter, it was her very first batch of cookies, and she beat me in the cookie department big time.  We all love them, this recipe is a keeper.

THis recipe gives me new hope in making cookies, I goofed on the first batch making them much too large. Future reference always use a teaspoon to put dough on cookie sheet. Second batch came out perfect. I cut the recipe in half as there are only 2 of us and it was great.

I loved this recipe! I didn't have cocoa powder, so I substituted two ounces baking chocolate, melted. Also, I don't like chocolate chips or nuts in my cookies, so I used two cups of oatmeal...chocolate oatmeal cookies! They were gone as soon as they came out of the oven..great recipe!

Awesome recipe!!!  The chocolate flavor of the dough isn't too powerful, which is what i've run into in the past.  Makes a very "chubby" cookie that the whole family will love!!!  I will continue to follow this recipe for years to come!

the taste was good and had a strong chocolate flavour, but they are rich, it is good for young children mostly who like sugary taste. I did 1 cup white sugar, and half a cup brown, and i also added 1/4 cup flour, and reduced the chocolate chips. They took more than 10 minutes to be cooked, and seem like they were not cooked enough. They were chewy and i did not like their texture. 

Netx time if i do them i will reduce the cocoa, and reduce sugar and chocolate chips! But i don't think i will do them again

These were great, for a chocolate craving they hit the spot.  Did not have any nuts in the house, but i think they would taste better with them, I will add pecans next time.

Came out great with 1/2c sugar and 1/2c brown sugar as others have suggested.  Also used mini M&M instead of chips and left out the nuts.  Refrigerated dough for a few hours before baking.  These were a big hit!

I used 1/2 c Crisco & 1/2 c Fleischman's margarine.  On the sugar I used 1c of brown sugar and 1/2 c of white.  I cut back on the cocoa to 1/3c and added 1/4 c of flour.  I upped the soda to 1 tsp and the salt to 1/2 tsp.  With 5 little kids, I dont have time to make 'cookies', so I put the batter into a jelly roll pan to make bars and baked for about 15 min (I like them gooey).  They were absolutely d'lish!  I guess this could be a new recipe, but the one Kathy had was a good base!

Great recipe. I substituted 1/2 cup of the white sugar with brown sugar and it turned out very flavorful. My kids and hubby loved the cookies and gobbled them up!

Perfect for someone with an overactive sweet tooth like me. I accidentally picked up peppermint extract while I was looking for the vanilla but decided to put it in anyways. It added a nice hint of mint flavor mixed in with the chocolate.

Like a truffle in cookie form :)  I made the following changes: substituted 1/2 cup of the white sugar with dark brown, used salted butter so eliminated the salt in the recipe, I used a cookie scoop that was heaping, so I baked for 10 minutes, didn't add nuts.  Came out very chewy, gooey, rich and yummy.

I made these for my Bible study, and they loved them! I used pecans instead of walnuts. I wish there were some way to get caramel blobs in there, too; that would be AWESOME.

hmm couldn't tell if the cookies were done yet since i tried to make them huge... so ended up making the first batch sort of hard. halved the recipe, added white chocolate chips, and replaced some of the white sugar with brown. the bf didn't like them as much as the best chocolate chip cookies on this site, but they were a bit different from the usual.

Wonderful! They don't flatten out too much, and look and taste like chocolate chocolate chip cookies: not too light or darkly colored/flavored. I used smart balance in place of butter and brown sugar in place of white sugar. The result... incredibly soft cookies that stayed soft for day (or would have, had they lasted that long).

I made these cookies for my honey & brother in law.  I substituted 1/2 a cup of brown sugar for the white sugar & used peanut butter chips.  I baked them for 12 minutes.  They turned out incredible.  Nice & soft.  Great chocolate flavour.  This recipe is a keeper, to add to my collection of thousands,lol.

yum! halved the recipe and it worked just fine - used shredded coconut in place of optional nuts (used a full 1/2 cup even though I was halving the recipe) and also used part brown sugar for the white sugar - so chocolatey and good texture...

So good! I too used 1/2 brown sugar and they turned out great. I think these cookies would be great even without the chocolate chips, maybe with a little powdered sugar on top. Either way, these are a hit!

This is the absolute best cookie recipe ever!  I made them by the tablespoon because we like our cookies BIG!  Even so, it still only took 10 minutes to set, and they are chewy and gooey after they cool down a bit.  Next time I'm using I Can't Believe It's Not Butter sticks to cut the calories.  By making these big, the WW Points Plus was 5 per cookie, but if you make them by the teaspoon it will cut them to 2 or 3 PP.

I would give these 4.5  stars. They were very good, but mine were NOT done after 8 mins. It took the full 10. I also used 1 stick butter and 1 stick of margarine.  Based on other reviewers' suggestions, I used 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Very good for a different kind of cookie, but definitely cook them the 10 minutes! Ally

Intensely chocolate-y!  I've used half butter/half transfat-free marg., a combination of white and brown sugars and have even substituted some of the white flour w/finely ground whole wheat flour - they disappear quickly no matter which variation I make.

Excellent recipe.  For a spicy treat, add about 1 teaspoon of ground cayenne pepper.  It may sound weird, but it just adds a bite to the taste, and goes surprisingly well with chocolate.

These are a great treat - I don't make them very often because I can't stay out of them... I've usually eaten my weight in dough before I can even get them into the oven.  Rich and chocolatey.  I usually make them with white chocolate chips - makes them a bit prettier.  Good recipe.

These cookies were very good, but were not the best chocolate chocolate chip cookies I have had.  I thought they could have been more chocolatey. I think next time I will use  a whole cup of cocoa powder.

Wow! These are awesome! My 15 year old daughter has made these twice this week because of family demand! But instead of making cookies she spread the batter onto an oven pan (14x13) and made brownie-like cookies. We live in Africa so the sizes of pans are different from the States, but I'm sure it would work with a 9x13 pan. I'm just not sure of the cooking time. They've turned out great each time and fun to make with kids. But they don't last long in the house! Very yummy!

These cookies are soooo good,soft and chewy-yummy. Only problem I have is that I make them for my grandsons and I can't keep their grandfather out of them.  By far the best chocolate-chocolate chip cookie I have tasted.

Wonderful recipe. I did as some suggested and traded 1/2 cup of the sugar with brown sugar, and I only used half of the suggested chips, because we don't like to overdo things in our family, and they were fantastic. They taste like little brownies. Hubby, who generally hates chips in general, pretty much ate everything left after the kids had their shot. 
Gooooood cookie....

This is an excellent recipe!!  Soft, rich, and moist.  I used 4oz 60% cocoa bittersweet chocolate bar (chopped) instead of 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips because that was what I had.  It turned out great.  I will probably use the same chocolate next time.  Thank you Kathy.  I think I will give this recipe to my family in Japan!

This is the BEST Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe ever!  So far I've given this recipe to my mom, my grandma and my sister.  My husband refuses all other cookies, except this one!  The only thing I do slightly differently is add about 2 Tbsp of milk alternating with the dry mixture.  Makes it a little easier to work with...

I was quite worried when I was making these cookies. I had read some of the negative comments on the page, and was thinking about a different recipe.

However, I made these cookies with the greatest ease. I made these at school for a class project and they turned out beautifully!

I made a batch of 20 and by the time I got home there were only 4 left! They were delicious and the perfect texture. Everybody loved them. Mmmmm... 

A*****!

Delicious! They were gone so quick I tried baking another batch to put in the freezer (they do freeze well) but that didn't stop them from defrosting it themselves and gobbling it all up!

These cookies were pretty good.  I took the advice of another reviewer & substituted 1/2 cup golden brown sugar and instead of the white sugar I added 1/2 Splenda for Baking.  I also used Reses Peanut Butter Chips instead of chocolate chips.  They came out very cakey, but good still.

Probably the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever made - I had to halve the recipe so I wouldn't eat them all!  Good for kids, but the cocoa powder gives it an extra touch for adults as well.

Amazing. If you are going to not eat them right away, I would suggest cooking them less than you would if you were eating them fresh. They stay gooeyer that way, and don't seem over done.

After all the previous reviews I couldn't wait to try these. That being said, I didn't think they were excellent- but they were good. I found that they tasted better a couple of days later. My family really loved these so maybe it was me. The batter was really yummy, and they turned out beautiful. I would make these again if they were requested- but not on my own. :)

Absolutely fabulous.  No nuts, and I used Nestle Semi-sweet/white chocolate chips (a  new chip from Nestle) and a some semi-sweet Hershey chocolate chips, also instead of butter I used shortening. Turned out perfect, I will make these again!!!

This is a FANTASTIC recipe!  I've made these no fewer than 5 times in the past two months...  I found these Andes Mint chips last week and thought they would go nice with these - - they are wonderful, if you like mint.

These are awesomely delicious!!! These cookies pass the test when it comes to an easy cookie recipe with little prep time & quick bake time as well. I used Nestle Cocoa Powder, because it was the least expensive one ( the unsweetened brand in my local vons was $8.39 opposed to $3.99 for Nestle. I also substituted the chips & used White Chocolate Chips to make an excellent Black & White Chipper Cookie. I didnt use nuts because I prefer the cookies without them. Love this recipe!

Great recipe and a no-brainer. I'm no ace when it comes to baking, but I made these cookies for a party, and they turned out wonderfully. The cookies were really moist and super chocolaty. My only mistake was not making enough. People quickly attacked my plate of cookies (foregoing even the tiramisu and cake that the host of the party served), and I ended up staring at an empty plate 5 minutes after I set the cookies down. I'd say that's a good sign.

I followed the recipe exactly and these really are wonderful cookies.  Most choc chip cookie recipes require brown sugar but I realized I was out and too lazy to go to the store.  This recipe really gives a cookie that is just perfect.  Thanks.

the yummiest chewy cookie ever!slightly crispy edges chewy middles.everyone loves me for baking these cookies!
I increased the flour by 1 cup,baking soda from 3/4 teaspoon to 1 teaspoon and cocoa powder from 2/3 cup to 3/4 cup.I chilled the dough for 2 hours.I rolled them into 4cm balls and baked them for 15 mins.
it turned out well.they r not falt n they taste so chocolatey n nice!but they can only keep for 2 days or they'll get dry even though u don't open the cookie jar.
I'll definitely bake these again.=)

Not the most attractive cookies... I added mint extract and Andes mint chips...not bad, but not overly chocolatey.

Absolutely fantastic.  Need to search no further for any other chocolate chip cookie recipes.  Too bad we don't have six stars, only five.

This is the best recipe for chocolate chip cookies I have ever tried!!! I omitted the walnuts and added a little more chips, the cookies were absolutely delicious, and addictive.

This is a great recipe. The cookies are soft and very chocolatey! I got great results by using Ghirardelli cocoa. I also think the cookies turn out better if you refrigerate the dough for a few minutes, roll into balls and then immediately get them into a hot oven. I will definitely keep this recipe handy.

These cookies were a hit with my friends. Used about a third less butter and only 1 cup of sugar and they still turned out chewy and chocolately.

These cookies came out great. The only changes I made was use 1/2 peanut butter chips and 1/2 milk chocolate chips. I also put less cocoa powder in. They were still very chocolatey and yummy!!  I think these are the best cookies I have ever made!

I've been using this recipe for over a year now, and I love it.  We omit the nuts, but this is my new favorite cookie recipe!  Really hits the spot when I need a chocolate fix!  Try replacing 1 c. of the chocolate chips with white chocolate chips for a different taste.  YUMMY!

I made these cookies last night with my daughters, and my oldest mistook the measurement of 14tsp of salt for 3/4 tsp..We cooked them anyways and they came out still delicious!! These are the BEST choco-choco chip cookies that I have ever tasted!!! They are soft on the inside with crisp edges. I wouldn't divert from the recipie at all! Use butter not margarine, and I used a bit more extra choco chips! This recipie is a DEFINATE keeper! Kudos Kathy!!!

Really good cookies!  My boys and husband love them and I can't stop eating them.  After reading reviews I did use 3/4 cup Blue Bonnet stick margarine and 1/4 cup Crisco.  Also was careful not to overbake, only 8-9 minutes.  Like any cookie they were very soft when they came out but firmed up nicely and have stayed soft and delicious!  I will save this recipe.

Delicious! Very chocolatey and scrumptious, these were what I was looking for and more..I had been searching some time for a chocolate chocolate chip cookie recipe, one that would turn out like the cookies in the store, and this was perfect!!! When they came out of the oven, they were so dark...Yum!!Just a question, where did you find this recipe?

Very delicious and rich...oozes chocolate when they are fresh from the over, and later become a soft inside/crunchy outside cookie.  I followed this recipe to the T and didn't see any reason to expirement with it. This will cure even the worst chocolate craving.  If you loooove chocolate, these are for you!

These were good and chewy.  Very sweet and very chocolatey!   I would make them again for sure.  We like to add Reese's Pieces instead of chocolate chips and make them in the fall.

Our basketball team is having a Christmas party next week, so I decided to choose a recipe from this site to use to make chocolate chip cookies.  This is the one I picked, and I'm very pleased with how the cookies turned out.  They're delicious, I can't wait to see how my team likes them next week.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious recipe! We made these cookies tonight and they are fantastic. This is the first time I have successfully made cookies (after many attempts), though I think the change came because I used a mixer instead of going by hand.

Wonderfully yummy!

These were amazing! The first time I tried them they turned out like I couldn't believe. The amount of chocolate was perfect and when they were added to the intermission refreshments table for a play I was in they disappeared within the first 10 minutes. Since then I've made them once more and they're still as good as ever (and they disappeared just as fast!)

Wonderful!  I substituted peanut butter chips and they were delightful.  I also like really big cookies, so I make 1/2 as many and added 4 minutes to the baking time.  I also switched all purpose flour for whole wheat flour and it tasted just fine.

This was an excellent recipe. I received rave reviews from my pre-natal class. I only used 3/4 C of butter, 1 C of sugar and no cocoa, and they were great!  The walnuts really add to it.  Will definitely make again.

Yummy!  I baked these a little longer, as I like to have a little crunch to my cookie.  I also used 1 cup granulated sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Awesome taste and will make again!

This recipe was excellant! The result is a very moist and delicious and verrrry chocolaty cookie. This is my first time making a chocolate chocolate chip cookie. I ususally make the regular kind. The only thing I did different with this recipe is used only 1 C. of the chocolate chips instead of 2. I found it to be plenty.

Excellent recipe! Best Chocolate chocolate chip cookies I've ever made. They cook fast, 8 minutes is plenty. I used milk chocolate chip instead and they tasted great. I will keep this recipe for the near future!

I too cut the recipe in half and even baked them in my Oster toaster oven, though it took 12 to 14 minutes to bake. Man these are great! I used a size 30 ice cream scoop, which makes 14 cookies.  So the calories per are about 250.  Thanks

I omitted the cocoa powder and substituted 4 1 oz. squares unsweetened chocolate.  I reduced the baking soda to 1/2 tsp.  I'm sure the reviews were right and the recipe is FAB as is, but I've been on a "melted chocolate" kick recently and thought it might be good.  It is rich and chocolatey with the right amount (for me) of sweetness.  My 5 year old loves it, too.  Thanks for the recipe!

FABULOUS!! Read most of the reviews first, the good reviews were absolutely true.  Any bad reviews came from those who either don't know how to bake a cookie or don't like cookies to begin with!  Didn't change a thing, this recipe works and is as good as everybody says it is!  Way to go Kathy Brandt!!

Excellent cookie recipe.  I could not even get them to cool long enough because everyone was devouring them.  The ones that were left were very soft and full of chocolate flavor(exactly what I love in a cookie).  This recipe is a keeper!!!

DELICIOUS!!  Just what a chocolate cookie should be!  I omitted the nuts (but will try slivered toasted almonds in the next batch).  I also sifted together my dry ingredients because my cocoa powder seemed awfully lumpy, and used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening instead of all butter.  These would be good with a variety of chips, and even maybe a bit of chopped dried cherries... yum!  They were chewy with barely crisp tops and sides after baking for 9 minutes.  My only complaint...they don't make enough!  Thanks for sharing!

An excellent cookie. I'm not a fan of chocolate chip cookies, but this hooked me. My husband, a cookie-freak, loved them! Easy. Only omitted the nuts. Will make again and again. If you or someone you know needs a chocolate fix, this is it!

Very tasty, but maybe a little too sweet.. I think I could have used a little less sugar and they would have been just as good.  I made exactly as written. Be sure to let then cool until they are room tempature before you touch them. If you don't, they will fall apart when you try to pick them up. I made the cookies a little larger than called for so I only had 36 cookies.

These cookies are sinfully delicious! And so easy to make too! I'm a novice baker and still thought this recipe was easy. I didn't have vanilla so didn't add it and it still came out great. Will be making these cookies over and over and over! Thank you Kathy!

Great cookie!  Easy to whip up, fairly small ingredients list, and they come out great as advertised.  I sprinkled a little confectioner's sugar on top, and left out the walnuts, but otherwise followed the recipe, and they came off without a hitch.  And I'm a total newby when it comes to baking.

Definitely a keeper...second only to the peanut butter chocolate chip cookie recipe I found here.

These REALLY are just like brownie/cookies!!!  Yum!  Really moist, crisp edges, just the right amount of ingredients!  I had to substitute 4 T. of margarine for part of the butter since I ran out of butter, but they were still wonderful!!!

I found these cookies to be very moist with fudge-like flavor (although I used white choc chips). Still good on second day, too!

Quite possibly the perfect cookie.  Crispy and perfectly crackled on the outside, cake like and chewy on the inside.  I am just packaging them up for co-workers right now...and I know they will be crazy about them.  Thanks for sharing, Kathy!!

These are great cookies!  Soft and chewy.  Like others suggested I used milk chocolate along with some semi-sweet chips, which worked out well.

Not bad, but not the best I have ever had.  Batter looked a little dry and I was worried the cookies would be as well.  I was right.  They were nice and soft on the inside but after one cookie I felt parched.  Taste was good but the dryness overwhelmed, will not make again.

I baked these a few days ago and ended up with about 60 cookies!! I ate 10 myself... :D and then brought the rest to swim practice for my team! 50 of them were gone in 5 minutes! This is a wonderful recipe. One hint to beginner bakers: remember not to use your mixer with the powdered ingredients, it can get quite messy that way. Use a wooden spoon ;)

Be sure to have a big glass of cold milk to go with these!! I just made them and they serve every chocolate craving I can muster up. The recipe as written made 36 medium sized cookies and the only change I did was add half semi sweet chips and half chopped up hershey bar. Very good, we'll have to see how many are still around when school lets out today.

Wow!  These cookies are amazing!  I only made half the recipe, which yeilded 2 1/2 dozen cookies more than the recipe said.  Also, for a quarter of the semi-sweet chips, I substituted chunks of a large Hershey's milk chocolate bar to add variety and sweetness.  These were triple chocolate-ity good!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I would actually give these a 4 and a half stars.  They were quite yummy.  Be careful to not overcook as they do dry out.  Great recipe.  I think real die-hard chocolate-lovers would give these a 10-star rating!

Awsome cookie recipe, but instead of butter, I used butter flavored shortening and not as much chocolate chips.

Excellent and easy recipe!  I didn't have walnuts, so I used chopped peanuts instead - still were very good.  Stayed soft after a few days in an air-tight container.  It's hard to find a great recipe that always gives you good results, but this one will not disappoint you.

Definitely a yummy cookie and just what I needed for my chocolate fix tonight:).  I did not put the nuts in and used a little less cocoa (not by choice).  Added a few peanut butter chips as well.  My husband LOVES them.  Will have to take some to work tomorrow otherwise I will eat them ALL!

I make cookies all of the time...but these cookies were the best I have ever made.  I used half butter and half butter-flavored Crisco.  I also used some mini-kisses as well as semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Everyone loved them and begged for more!!! Enjoy!

I was a little short on eggs and flour, but I was dying for some cookies. Thank goodness we found these - AWESOME! It's just my husband and I, and I had read these cookies don't last long. We halfed the recipe and chopped up bittersweet baking squares. Left out the nutes, but next time (and there definitely will be a next time!) we are going to try subsituting the nuts for chunky peanut butter. I don't think we will ever stop eating them, we have already each had 3 and counting!

These cookies turned out great. I left out the nuts and instead of chocolate chips, I used raspberry chips (can be found during the holiday season at some grocery stores).  They were a big hit when I brought them to work!

I used Hershey's raspberry flavored chocolate chips instead of the regular semi-sweets.  The cookies tasted AMAZING!!   I also did as one reviewer suggested and substituted 1/2 c. shortening for 1/2 of the butter and had no trouble with the cookies drying out.  I will definitely make these again!!

WOW!  I can't make enough of these.  They are not so sweet as your regular chocolate chip so they make a great 'adult' cookie.  Add more cocoa for more of a  bittersweet cookie - my favorite!

These are for the chocoholic only!  Boy what rich deep flavor!  I made them with freshly ground whole wheat flour and they came out perfectly even after freezing in little cookie dough balls and baking fresh from the freezer.  They were a little to chocolatey for me, but my husband loves them.

I tried several of the here published cookie recipes, but I definitely liked this one the best. I did not use as much caocao. (I am not that brave!), but they turned out more then rich enough! I fixed them for my (American) husband, who was going on chocolate chip cookie withdrawl. He loved them. "A face-flusher", he said. Extremely yummy. Thank you for sharing and thank you for having a metric standard calculator!

Oh my goodness, these cookies are WONDERFUL.  Nice soft, rich chocolate cookie.  Instead of semi-sweet, I used half milk and half white chocolate chips, although I'm sure they will be good either way.  These are my new favorite chocolate chip cookies!
