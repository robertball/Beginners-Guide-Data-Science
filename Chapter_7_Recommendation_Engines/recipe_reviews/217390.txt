This is my favorite recipe I've ever made!
I cut the red velvet in half at it's diameter, drying out the cake in the oven then blending it into fine crumbs with a food processor. I added about a tablespoon more butter to the crust and packed it into the bottom of a 9 inch pan instead of 10. I then cut the other half in half (so if I used the whole cake I would have had quarters) and then I cut those down the middle as if I was making a layer cake instead of cubing it. After I put my first layer of the cheesecake in the pan, I arranged the sliced cake so it covered the surface completely and then put the remaining cheesecake over it.
The only problem I had was that it didn't really set in the fridge, but I was using light cream cheese so that may have been the problem. I would definitely make this again, as it got eaten in two days!

This was perfect. A friend of mine's two favorite desserts are cheesecake and red velvet cake. Together they are heavenly. Strongly recommend this recipe to anyone who loves the sound of two amazing dishes put together.

This was very yummy.  i used a red velvet cake mix instead of making one from scratch.  The cream cheese mixture is what makes this though.  I would like to try it with some other cake flavors as well.

For a no bake cheesecake this was awesome and very fun!  I loved the crust and would never have thought to use cake for one.  I am going to experiment with this recipe with other flavors.  Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe!

This was fun to make. I sliced the cake like a reviewer suggested so that I had 4 quarter circles and so had a nice layer look when sliced. But the taste was only average to me. I had some neighbors over to eat it and they seemed to like it.  It got nice and firm in refrigerator. Thanks Debeland.

My homeroom cooking teacher let my class make this for my birthday and it was amazing, we didn't use the food dye for the crust though.

I used dark brown sugar instead of white and added 1/3 cup of coffee liqueur to the cake mix.  I also used 10% fat plain yogurt instead of milk.

 I also added 1/4 cup coffee liqueur to the cream cheese mix.

It turned out great--very moist.  The liqueur did not overwhelm the other ingredients.  Everyone at work wanted the recipe.

This is complicated, I just used the cheesecake portion of this recipe, and it's a 5!!! Where I changed this recipe, is that I made the bottom a layer of red velvet cake, not a crust. I used this recipe - http://allrecipes.com/recipe/9295/red-velvet-cake/, made it in two layers and used the other layer cut in pieces for the filling. This cheesecake is so light and fluffy, and not really sweet. I'm not a huge fan of no bake cheesecakes, but this filling is great

This cheesecake was awesome! It is time consuming but worth it. The only think I did was add 2 tablespoons of sour cream to the cake. Great recipe!

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday. We loved it! Even though I didn't have the right amount of food coloring, I combined the red and the blue and had a purple velvet cheesecake instead. It was still amazing.

Delicious!  Wife & I loved it. I didn't have a 10" spring form pan, so I used a 9" & was fine.  I had a little extra red velvet cake left over I could use for decoration. Plan any possible red velvet cake shapes you may want before cutting the half with the strips.  Wife loved the fact this desert light tasting and not as "heavy" as most of the "death by chocolate" type cakes I tend to make.  Be sure not to overcook the red velvet cake (I almost did by cooking a little longer than called for).  Personally, I didn't think of cheesecake when tasting it, but it IS very good!

Yum!! This is a fantastic cheesecake, and it's not "too cheesy" like my brother thinks other cheesecakes are. I will definitely make this again!
