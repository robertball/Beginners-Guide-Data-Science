This is good. Next time if Iâ€™m making just for me I will skip the skewers and just broil it loose since the first thing I did to eat was slide everything off the sticks. The honey mustard sauce is great and I will use as condiment for other things as well.

Simple and delicious! This comes together so quickly which makes it perfect for nights you are short on time. Not only is this meal delicious, it's colorful and very pleasing to the eyes. I've tried other brands of sausage in the past but always come back to Hillshire Farm. None of the others even come close in comparison. This is an excellent recipe and one I will make again!

A nice change from Christmas leftovers and more veggies than I usually eat.
