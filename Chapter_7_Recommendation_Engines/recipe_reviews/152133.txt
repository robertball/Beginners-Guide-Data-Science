This salad is great for a hot summer day here in North Queensland Australia. I did add finely chopped Vietnam mint and fresh mint.Served with spiced chicken and cold steamed rice and yoghurt mayonaise

This is a good basic recipe.   I customized by adding some fish sauce mixed with water, garlic, sugar, olive oil.  Everything else in the recipe stays the same.

My wife used to make a recipe similar to this which called for tuna instead of chicken. We both liked Vietnamese Chicken Cabbage Salad a lot. It's curiously habit forming, particularly when one is really hungry. My only modification was using extra virgin olive oil instead of regular olive oil. I was generous with the salt and pepper, which makes a big difference in the flavor. Over 50% of the calories are fat calories, but I'm okay with that: 1) the fat calories are "good fat" from the olive oil, and, 2) when paired with other healthy dishes, the fat percentage of the meal will reduce. I recommend this one!

Great summertime cabbage salad. It does need a little more lemon. Knowing that Vietnamese cuisine uses cilantro (ngo) I chopped some up and added it to the recipe which made it 5 stars. Either way it's good.

This was great and really easy.  I used some left over grilled chicken and then followed the recipie as written.  My husband is trying to eat better and constantly complains that the food does not have enough flavor.  He didn't even add extra salad dressing to this - Amazing!  He asked for it at least once a week!

This was pretty good. I used one large, juicy lemon but would recommend that you use two. This was crisp and cold and perfect for summer, unfortunately I am currently surrounded by about a foot of snow. Which got me thinking that this would be really good heated up on the stove top for about 5 min. I didn't try that though. This is also nice because you can make it ahead of time.

This is wonderful and so easy to make.  I used 2 small red onions and added a green pepper.  I also had some leftover carrots, so I shredded one with my shredder and added it.  My dh said, "it's coleslaw!"  LOL!

Two unions is very over powering! If they were cooked, then added, it would be a great flavor.  We had more union on each fork full then anything else!  Over all, it was OK, but not great.  My husband found it tastes really good heated in the skillet, with some fetta cheese. Or with a scrabbled egg (tastes like an eggroll).   I wont be making it again.

It's more of a chicken cole slaw. It wasn't very filling.

So I am not sure what happened but this salad was so spicy we couldn't eat it raw. I used napa cabbage instead of regular and sesame oil instead of olive and I only used one yellow onion and a little bit of a green one. I had to add other stuff to it and cook it to make it edible. I added bean sprouts and scrambled eggs and that tamed it down a bit. I tried it the day I made it and thought maybe if I let it marinate overnight it would be better but nope, it was still just as spicy.
