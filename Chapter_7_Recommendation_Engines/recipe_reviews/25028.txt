Fa-reeking awesome. Tossed a little lemon juice in with the filling and made a thin lemon icing to drizzle over the bars (1 c. confectioners sugar, 1/4 c. softened butter, little salt, fresh lemon juice until it's thinned down enough). You do have to use a little muscle with the crust if you don't have a Kitchen Aid to get all the ingredients evenly mixed. This one's a keeper.

This is a good blueberry recipe. It took abit in making the crust, when forming the dough,you will have to use your hands to combine the ingredients. A utencil will not work. Very good taste, I would make these for a holiday. The two textures compliment each other.

The Zing of lemon cookie nicely offsets the blueberry filling.  Not overly sweet but very delicious.  As previous posters have mentioned, the cookie base can be difficult to work with, but I recommend saving the lemon juice from the zested lemon and add as needed if the mix is too dry.

**Holiday Update**I won the cookie contest at work with a modified version of this recipe using fresh cranberries and orange zest.  Double the sugar you add to the berries since cranberries are so tart.  Also added extra juice from the orange and orange extract to the cookie base

These bars are very tasty! The only thing I did differently was add the juice from half of a lemon along with a 1 tsp of cornstarch to filling. I used my hands to mix up the course crumbs before forming it into an 8x8 pan. The crust was done in 10 minutes at 400 degrees. I added the filling and baked the bars at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. The crumb topping was a nice golden brown color and evenly covered the bars. I could also see the blueberries bubbling with it's purple juices oozing out on the sides.  I cooled the bars before tasting them. The lemon works beautifully with the fresh blueberries balancing out the tart with the sugar in the filling. This is not too sweet or too tart either-just right. The crumb topping has a nice sweet crunchy texture and works great with all of the blueberries. The crust is the perfect thickness just the way I like them. And I am glad I baked these in a 8x8 pan otherwise I would have ended up with thin crusts. The lemon zest adds a nice subtle lemon flavor to the crust as well. I cut these into 9 large bars and they were gone -just like that! Delicious and a great treat.

Used 1/8 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp cinnamon.  Should have only baked the min. amount of time.  Used fresh blueberries.  Added an extra 2 Tbl. flour for topping due to very high humidity day.  That really helped get the correct texture.  Family enjoyed it with vanilla ice cream.

I found this quite easy to assemble, a lot easier than making a pie IMO.  I cut the recipe in half, so a pint of blueberries was perfect for an 8x8 pan.  Cuz I wanted to really taste the lemon, I added lemon juice (along with a dusting of flour) to the berries and some more zest in the topping.  Only problem is the oven temp and/or bake time -- my crust was done at 10 min at 400, so I lowered the oven temp to 350 to finish the baking and the bars were done in 15 (would have burned at 20-25 min at 400).  Thanks for the recipe.

Yummy! I was in the mood for a pie or something blueberry - this satisfied both cravings. I used a bag of frozen blueberry instead of fresh ones. My husband and 3-year-old loved it, too. We all had some for breakfast the next morning.

Good with some extra lemon zest in with the berries based on reviews, I also added an extra cup of (frozen) blueberries and some lemon juice to the crust.

This recipe is pretty good, my only suggestion is to make it in a smaller pan. I found the crust to be very thin, as well as the filling, otherwise, it's really yummy.

My husband, parents and friends all loved these bars. I thought that they were very sweet and rich. You definatly need to work the dough with your hands. I used 1/2 nutmeg and 1/2 cinnomon for the spice. It is important to let these cool completly before slicing or they crumble (it was hard to wait!). I will make these again for afternoon tea.

This was delicious! The subtle lemon flavor in the crust adds a special touch. I agree with another reviewer that the crust took some work (with hands, definitely not utensils), but it was worth it.

The crumb topping is a very good crumble to use over fruit in coffee cakes.  My family wasn't crazy about the bars though, because the crust was a little denser than what we like.  It was a crispier, denser crust, versus a lighter cake-like crust that we would have preferred.

I thought the cookie base was pretty dry and not very lemony - I will keep playing with this recipe, but as written, it did not meet my expectations.

Great recipe! As is, I thought they were perfect, not too sweet with a good blueberry-to-crust ratio although they might look a little thin in the 13x9 pan. You might want to use an 8x8 pan if you want a thicker bottom crust. The only changes I made to the ingredients was to use lemon juice instead of zest and to leave out the nutmeg (didn't have any). I don't have an electric mixer so I did everything by hand and it still came out great. For the crust, I actually melted the butter a little to make it easier to work with (10-15 secs in the microwave) and I didn't have any trouble mixing the ingredients or getting it into the pan from there. For the filling, I mixed the blueberries, sugar, and some lemon juice together first before pouring into the crust, instead of sprinkling, to more evenly distribute the sugar. For the crumb topping, I think I would cut in the butter next time as indicated for the crust since it came out more doughy than crumbly by creaming the butter & sugar together (still tasted good though!). As other reviewers have said, I would also cook everything on the min time.

I think that this is my only 1 star rating, ever. I made them exactly as written and the they turned out looking pretty good.  But the crust has no flavor, and the sugar on top of the blueberries just sat on the blueberries.  I wished that I could have scraped the berries off and re-used them in a different recipe.  What a waste.

Pretty good bars. The blueberry and struesel parts were delicous. The crust was "eh." It didn't have much flavor and I think that 12 mins was too long in the oven. Would try this recipe again but with lemon juice or something in the crust and putting it in the oven for only about 10 mins. 
Nevertheless, the bars were a hit :)

I should have listened to the other reviewers.  Great ingredients, added a lot more lemon, but still got a bar that was more like biscotti - crunchy, dry, and sadly disappointing.

I wish these had more flavor. It's strange to think they don't.. maybe 3 cups of blueberries would've worked better and I think the crumble topping could use a little something extra. I used Splenda instead of regular sugar (I did still use the brown sugar though) so maybe that has to do with the non-sweetness of it.. but I don't think it's entirely responsible for the blandness... I even added lemon juice to the filling.

I agree with the others, cook in a smaller dish, i used my biggest casserole dish. But what I did like about the thinner squares, you can eat more than one! loved the lemon crust, had to squeeze a bit of juice into the dough, to make the dough more wet. Tasty recipe!

Tried to make 1/2 the recipe and was not successful.  I had an overdone bottom crust BUT the top half was SO delicious!  I'll just have to make it right next time because it is a superb recipe!

These were absolutely delicious just after they cooled down a bit and were still slightly warm. They didn't taste so good the next day however and I was pretty disappointed. Something about the blueberries the next day seemed to turn more to taste like dates. Much better for serving immediately.

These were great!  I didn't add the lemon zest.  I added lemon juice but I still couldn't taste the lemon so I added lemon glaze.  The glaze made them even better.  I only cooked them on 375 and they still cooked well.

My family and I loved these bars!  I used lemon juice b/c I didn't have a lemon to zest and added an extra cup of blueberries...took barely any time and effort to make them!  Great recipe!

Yummy recipe!  I did not find the dough at all difficult though it does require more liquid...another egg or lemon juice.  I also added more zest than was called for and squeezed lemon juice over the blueberries.  The lemon flavor was still very subtle though. Definitely use a much smaller pan also.  Overall very good and I love the fact that they have fewer calories and less fat than many other bar recipes.

I didn't think there were enough berries to cover the crust. The crust did not rise for me, it was really flat. Maybe it was because I had an old box of baking soda? I may try this again (not anytime soon)next time with a fresher box of soda, and more berries. I couldn't serve it to my guests.

The crust turned out well. I added extra blueberries and they still barely covered the crust. I thought the dessert was kind of bland and needed a sauce or something.

The crust was so crumbly, even though I doubled the amount of egg. I even doubled the sugar and used brown sugar instead for more flavor, and it was only passable. Also, the crumb topping would have in no way held together if I had added the original amount of flour. Not making this again.

I liked this recipe, and so did my family. I added an extra egg, though, because the crust didn't hold together as well as I wanted it to.

These bars were just OK.  I probably will not make them again, however I took them to a picnic and most everyone else seemed to think they were good.  Not enough flavor in the crust and crumb topping for my husband and I.  I did add pecans to the topping - those tasted good - a little toasted from baking.  Just not our thing, I guess.

These turned out pretty good. I made the crust in my Kitchen Aid mixer and it never really turned into a dough. I added 2.5 Tablespoons of ice cold water for it to form. I ended up baking mine for the full 25 minutes, and it was perfect.

Not enough berries.  I increased it to 3 cups and still didn't really like these bars.  Not much flavor and too crumbly.  I think I also just wanted a dessert with more lemon flavor.  Will not make again.

Made exactly as directed, this recipe was "just okay" according to me and my family.  If I make it again, I will use a little less lemon zest and nutmeg, which is easy to adjust  to personal taste. Also, we found the crumb to filling ratio to be a bit off, as we would have preferred much more blueberry filling and less "flour-y and crumb-y" texture.  It needed to be served with ice cream to mitigate the dryness... not the worst thing in the world! LOL!

I absolutely loved how this turned out! I tweaked the recipe a touch (according to a review in the comments) by adding lemon juice into the filling and on top I added confectioner sugar + lemon juice. It was very fruity!! However, because I put a liquid inside the filling, the crumble was a bit liquidy on top, but when you take it out of the oven, it continues to bake. Delicious and definitely making again!

I added a glaze made from powdered sugar vanilla butter and milk because I thought this was pretty plain and Doughy tasting. I also served with vanilla ice cream which added flavor and sweetness. Maybe next time add more blueberries.

I had a 2-3 cups of blueberries left from our berry picking trip and wanted to make something fast instead of freezing them.  I didn't have a lot of time to read the reviews like I usually do to look at others' suggestions and changes., so I made it exactly as written.  We loved it and went through a 9x13 pan and everyone asked for more! My kids may have added a little more powdered sugar than it called for - but otherwise it was exactly as written and it was perfect sweet/tart.

I veganized this one and substituted thus:  almond flour, raw cane sugar, flax meal+h2O for the egg, Earth Balance margarine for the butter. It turned out  well and I took them to a party where they disappeared quickly. Too good to have in my house, so that's always a relief.

I don't have a sweet tooth that's what drew my attention to this recipe. However, this recipe has good flavor but desperately need sugar. 2 cups sugar to 2 tablespoon of sugar??? I added 1/3 of a cup and still thought it was bland. The brown sugar topping was rather tricky to add to the top of the bar. I ended up adding 1/3 of a cup of oats to give it more texture. Then I took small amounts of the topping and flattened to make it easier to top the bar.  After 20 mins of baking it didn't brown so I turned on the broiler on low for a few mins and that have it a beautiful golden color. This recipe does need to be topped with powder sugar. Btw, I separately made the dough and brown sugar topping in the food processor and it made my life a lot easier. Good luck.

Pretty tasty! I was concerned about the "cracker crust" some mentioned so I made this in a 7x11 glass pan and liked the way it turned out. I'm not a fan of nutmeg, though, so I think the next time I make this I'll either leave it out or perhaps substitute with cinnamon. Also - I personally thought they tasted better the next day. They were more of a crumb-cake dessert the first day, but there were a handful leftover and I stored them covered in tupperware overnight and they were moist and had a nicer consistency in my opinion.

Delicious, my only problem was that in a 9x13 pan the crust was stretched a little too thin, but as I'll definitely be making it again I'll make a little more next time. I also added a some lemon juice to the crust, as well as a few sqeezes of lemon juice and a little more zest to the filling. Using fresh blueberries was well worth the money it cost when I made these out of season! Perfect with coffee and when I brought them to work they disappeared before my eyes.

Good, but not memorable.

I did not care for this recipe. The top half (cobbler - blueberry ) was just okay....a little sweet.  The bottom "cookie" crust was bland.
