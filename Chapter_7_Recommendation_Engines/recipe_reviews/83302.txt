Hmmm, trying to think how I can help those that didn't quite get this recipe. 1.Unless you're used to cooking "soul" food, this aint no weeknight dish! I can whip it up quickly and have shortcuts, but don't attempt this on hump day if its your first time. 2. Smothered chicken is basically semi-fried chicken and pan gravy. If you can make decent fried chicken and a good pan gravy, put the two together and that's the gist of this dish. 3.To solve the soupy gravy problem, start with the rioux first: add the flour to the pan drippings and cook/stir constantly for about 5 minutes or so, then add the veggies to that for another 5 minutes. It will look a mess, but when you add the liquid and stir it good; your gravy will appear. Add about a cup of liquid at a time and stir between so its not too soupy. Then TASTE IT before you add the chicken. If it's bland, add more salt/pepper/garlic powder/dried thyme/cayenne or whatever till it tastes the way you want. THEN add the chicken. Hope this helps!!!

I just don't get all these people who insist on using boneless, skinless chicken breasts for everything.  A dish like this screams out for bone-in, skin-on chicken.  If you're afraid of a whole chicken, buy an already cut up chicken.  The skinless, boneless breast is the driest, most bland of all the cuts of chicken.  I would never use it for a dish like this, which was wonderful, by the way.  I just increased the spices a tad, and we loved it!

After watching Anita Baker prepare her Smothered Chicken on Oprah, I decided to try hers.  It was very bland.  So I searched and found this recipe.  Just what I was looking for! Several years ago I ate a similar dish and haven't been able to find the recipe until now.  Thought 3 cups of onion would be too much, but I gave it a try and that amount was fine.  Thanks so much for the recipe!! Flavorful, old-fashioned comfort food!

This is one of our absolute favorite recipes. I make it exactly as instructed and it has become the ultimate Wow! meal to make for company or family gatherings. It's easy, inexpensive and just melts together beautifully. I suggest serving with sweet yellow cornbread to really feel your southern roots. Thanks for a great recipe, Veronica!

This sounds great!  I can't wait to try it!  I'm 'reviewing' in response to the June 22, 2007, review which asked why people try to use boneless, skinless chicken breast in a recipe (especially this one) that calls for whole chicken, white and dark, including skin.  Well, to each his/her own...  Maybe some folks use chicken breasts for convenience.  But maybe some use chicken breasts (and don't use the butter and make other modifications) because they've had quadruple heart bypass surgery or otherwise MUST maintain a certain diet.  On the other hand, those who make major modifications to a recipe and then enter a low, critical review?  Not good...

This was absolutely delicious as written. It tasted like buttery chicken pot pie, without the pie or peas. Any skin-on bone-in chicken pieces will work great, so I used 8 drumsticks. After adding the broth, you should bring it to a boil, stir, add the chicken, bring to a boil again, and then reduce heat to low for simmering. Otherwise, the chicken will sap the heat out and you won't get a good simmer. I followed the recipe as written and after 30 minutes I still needed to bring it to a boil to cook the chicken and thicken the sauce. Another slight improvement is adding salt while the mirepoix cooks (the carrot, celery, and onion). Plus I used Tony's (creole seasoned salt) when flouring the chicken pieces. Thanks for a great comfort food recipe! It's absolutely the best thing on this site that I've been able to execute with ease. Thank you!

Really good! I used just over a pound of chicken breasts cut into strips and went light on the salt, but kept everything else the same. For whatever reason, it took me a lot longer to cook than the time said, but it was worth it in the end. However, I think this would be better with mashed potatoes instead of rice.

Thank you all for reating my recipie. Please keep in mind to use seasoning to cater to your own taste. AllRecipies.com cut down my seasoning mix a lot probably for sodium purposes. Also it may now be clear in the recipie, but add the flour after saute of the vegetables. That way, there are no clumps of flour in the gravy. Also use bone in PLEASE.

Happy Meals
Veronica

Made this for my husband, because it's one of his favorite dishes. He LOVED it! The 3-year-old gave it a thumbs up also! I used 8 thighs instead of a whole chicken and slightly modified the recipe for somewhere between 4 and 8 servings. I also omitted the cayenne pepper. This was a great meal and I will definitely make it again!

A fantastic recipe.  The only thing I altered was the amount of salt and cayenne, to suit my own tastes.  Otherwise, everyone loved it.  I served it with brown rice and green beans.  **Update: I've made this many times, and it's versatile as far as the vegetables.  Today I put a chopped turnip and some mushrooms in it, just to increase its nutritional value.  Very tasty.

This is an easy recipe to prepare and is very good. Except for slicing the carrots rather than chopping them, I followed the recipe exactly. I fixed rice to go with it, but I think next time I think I will try mashed potatoes. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

This is amazing. My husband told me I better put this in my recipe box right now so I dont forget about it. I saw that some people had a hard time with the directions so this is what I did. I seasoned my flour with Tonys and left out the salt and pepper. I browned my chicken in the butter but did not drain it before I added the veggies. Then I added my flour 1 tbsp at a time then stir until it makes a paste then add chicken broth slowly 1/4 c at a time then add chicken and bring to a boil. Cook about 45 minutes. Also for those of you that dont like meat on the bone I would suggest buying split breasts and removing the breast and skin yourself and add the bons when you start the gravy that way you still get the flavor the bone gives off. It really does make a difference.

Absolutely delicious!  Been making smothered chicken for years, and this is simpler and better tasting than my recipe.  Plenty of gravy from this for mashed potatoes, very flavorful, and great to feed a large group.  Its a hit everytime!  I am having 14 people over tonight and guess whats for dinner??  Always a hit!!  I always slice the onion in rings-it adds a nice look and gives onion haters the option to remove them from their portion.  Carrots and celery are optional and will not take away from the yumminess if omitted.

It's true. You will need to add your own seasoning to this recipe. If you're a a truly beginning cook, don't rely on your chicken to be done in 30 minutes like the recipe says. I left my chicken on for 1 1/2 - 2 hours because I like my chicken to fall off the bone. Don't worry about the 3 cups of onions. This is an onion gravy and they will dissolve. The flavor was so, so, good! I also picked up the butter flavor in the gravy which I really enjoyed. I followed the recipe to the tee, and added additional seasonings to my taste. Make sure you like the flavor of the (soon to be) gravy before you add the chicken to it. That's the key. Great recipe.

This recipe is definitely a keeper! I am on a strict diet and was planning to only serve this to my family but once I tried it I couldn't stop myself! LOL! It's so delicious, and the cayenne pepper gives this little hint of spiciness that is not overwhelming but that definitely takes the dish to a higher level. I wouldn't change a thing! (except for using the salt and black pepper to your own liking) just delicious!

so delicious!  I was expecting this to be a bit bland but it was so full of flavor and the right amount of heat.  , I'm one of those people who insists on using skinless chicken breast (also i cut the amount of butter in half) and this still turned out fantastically.

Comfort food at it's best Veronica! I cut back on the butter and used more seasonings.......garlic and onion powders and dill and added in a touch of Gravy Master to add more flavor. I served this over mashed potatoes and my S.O. and I thought it was just delicious. Thank you!

I actually LOVED this but found the browning of the chicken to be a waste. Once you place the chicken back in the gravy, cover, & simmer, the skin turns soft & mushy. Once you start serving this, the skin falls off & you end up w/a mouthful at some point.That's the ONLY reason this gets knocked down 1 star. Flavor is AMAZING! Getting a mouthful of chewy chicken skin is disgusting, so I definitely want to try it w/blsl chicken next time....or at least pull the skin off...altho the bones got in the way also....yep, blsl will be the way for ME to go next time :)

Followed the recipe to a tee, except used creole seasoning instead of cayenne.  I had way too much chicken, so ended up cooking it in a roasting pan for like 3 hours.  It turned out goooood!  The chicken was falling off the bone tender.  Served it with rice, and it was a huge hit.  Good leftover too. Will definitely make again.

Loved this! Used baby carrots and chicken thighs and it worked out great. The baby carrots were not mushy and were cooked to the right amount of tenderness for my family which means we could still chew it. :) Thanks for this recipe.

My family and I really enjoyed this meal. However, I did add some mushrooms and green pepper. Instead of 3 cups of chicken broth I added 2 cups and 1 cup of water. To cut back on salt. I used chicken breast and legs this was great!

This dish came out great!  The gravy did not come out as thick as I would have liked (I'll have to add a little more flour next time), but it tasted delicious none the less.  Would definitely fix again!

Excellent dish!!  I used boneless chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken, sauteed the chicken in a combination of butter and olive oil, added fewer carrots than indicated, and added a few dashes of worcestershire sauce & liquid smoke.  Definitely a keeper!

As written, I give this four stars because I felt that it was lacking flavor.  I added garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and celery salt.  These seasonings make this a 5 Star recipe.

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! I'd never made smothered chicken before so I wanted to try something new. I didn't use the celery or cheyene pepper but I used everything else and my family absolutely loved it. My neice couldn't stop talking about it. This recipe was defintiely a hit for me I'll be using it again and again!

So good!  I added garlic powder and paprika to the flour to season the chicken.  Don't use boneless chicken, it just gets tough and stringy and it doesn't give this dish enough flavor!  Mine did take longer to cook all the way through, closer to 45-50 minutes.

So so good!! I doubled the seasoning and I only used 2cups of broth and added a cup in a half of milk!! I looked at the reviews about it being soup so the milk thickened it! Make sure to slowly pour in the liquid then mix the flour!! It was so good and seasoned!

This was so good. We had it with rice and peas, and buttermilk cornbread. I think I was a bit heavy handed on the cayenne and the garlic was really fresh and the cloves were huge but we like spicey food so no foul there.

I used bone in chicken pieces and as I dont like standing and stirring things I cooked in a moderate oven for an hour once everything was combined. It's on our roster for repeating

Absolutely fabulous! I wish I could give it 10 stars! I agree completely with others that said that for this recipe you MUST use bone-in, skin -on chicken. I would just not be the same without it. I followed the recipe pretty much as written, however I used quality ingredients. The chicken broth I used was homemade stock that was boiled on the stove for 3 days, yummm! Very, very flavorful! The rest of the ingredients were organic, some of which came from our garden. Oh, and I also added green beans and extra carrots and celery. I only put in a dash of cayenne (personal preference). I too was a little nervous about the 3 cups of onions, but you didn't even notice they were in there as noted by other reviewers. I also mixed a little olive oil with the butter so that it would not burn. I cut back on the butter just a tad to make up the difference. I buy 20-30 chickens a year from a local farmer so I am always looking for different ways to cook chicken. This recipe will be a standard in our house. Thank you so much Veronica for the recipe!

Looking for something to do with a cut up chicken besides fry it- my family enjoyed this chicken! I took off the skin and reduced the butter. My teenager didn't like being able to see the vegetables (he's anti-healthy right now) but he ate his fair share. The toddler liked the gravy it made, and hubby had to have his plate moved from in front of him before he exploded. Thanks so much!

Oh my gosh...this was soooo yummy. It took a little longer to cook and we used baby carrots because that's all we had. The only thing was-there wasn't enough veggies. Next time, I'm going to put twice as many veggies in because they were sooo good!

This is the best smothered chicken recipe I've ever tried! When I invite people over and they ask what I'm making and I tell them,"smothered chicken" they kindof roll their eyes. But when they try this chicken everyone begs me for the recipe! Absolute comfort food for me as well!

This dish is awesome. I added more veggies to mine. I added broccoli and green beans because I had them on hand. I have moved to Ireland and miss soul, southern cooking. I am from Texas. This reminds me SO much of home and my grandmother. This is a wonderful full meal with a wonderful sauce that makes the whole dish. I served with homemade mash potatoes and it was huge hit.

I make this all the time...the secret is to brown the chicken  very well, before adding veggies & broth.  I'm French, and my family has cooked this for many yrs.  I don't put carrots though, I add chopped red or green peppers, I find this is even more flavorful.  I sometimes use sliced mushrooms for a more special occasion.  I also sometimes use dried herbs..Italian mixed blend is very nice.  Delicious!

I've made this dish about 5 times already and it's a hit in my house! When I'm being lazy, I'll use cream of chicken instead of making the roux but this specific recipe is a favorite on Sundays! I usually like to use thighs and legs but have also used chicken breasts...still damned good. We like gravy so I add another cup of broth and also another tablespoon of flour. All in all, you really can't go wrong.

Made this dish for dinner tonite and it was absolutely delicious. I kept to the recipe except I have my own special seasonings that I always use when frying  chicken. Otherwise everything stayed the same.  I served it with rice and string beans. Can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Not impressed. The skin started crispy after I fried it, but after sitting in this broth for 30 minutes it turned it back into slimy slippery skin.  I think this would have tasted better to cook chicken separately and get a nice crust and make a gravy separately to drizzle over.

I did not care for this recipe.  The gravy had way to much of an onion taste for me.  I will not make it again.

Way too timing consuming for the chicken to come out bland. Medium-high was too high to brown the chicken, the butter ended up burning. Cooking time was off, after 30 minutes the chicken was still pink.

SO good. One warning though, use your very largest skillet. Mine bubbled all over the place and made a big mess. Worth it though, because this was delicious.

Overall good if a slightly bland but pepped it up by adding a little paprika, celery seed and celery salt and more garlic powder.  Also used a little medium sherry to deglaze the pan after sautéing the vegetables and chicken before adding the flour.  Fairly easy to cook, just be organised in your prep. Good family week day meal.  We served with mash potato and green beans.

This is a good solid dinner. Its easier then it looks and I had everything in the house to make it. I do think next time I'll use boneless skinless breast. Personal preference.

Outstanding!  There were a few changes but it was for personal taste and convenience.  I put the salt, pepper, added garlic powder to the flour and put in a plastic bag.  I halfed the recipe and used 3 large chicken thighs.  The celery was left out but extra carrots added but next time I'll still omit the celery and skip the extra carrots. I let it cook closer to an hour and it was falling off the bone tender.  I made this for a date and he had three helpings so I'll call that a hit.  The gravy was wonderful over mashed potatoes.  This will definately be made again.

This was delicious! I used 5 huge skin-on chicken thighs, and I didn't have any cayenne, so I used a teaspoon of Browning to give it a Caribbean flavor--and it still turned out great! I will make it again with the listed ingredients!

I cut the salt and cayenne a bit to taste, and use cut-up skinless chicken or bone-in thighs.  Always a hit.

If you love soul food, you will love this dish.  If you are like me, and not so crazy about soul food, you will still like this dish.  I made this for my husband for father's day.  He is crazy about gravy over fried meat.  He said it tasted "good."  In his limited use of adjectives, this actually means "outstanding!"  The only thing I changed in the recipe was I used red onions instead of yellow.  Even though not much dry spice is used, the combination of the celery, onions and garlic, really add a lot of flavor.  I also believe browning the chicken in butter instead of oil adds a bit more saltiness to the meat.  I had side dishes of lima beans cooked in chicken broth and fried okra.  My hubby was in soul food heaven!

I wasn't sure about this, but it was getting late on a Sunday and I had to make something.  All I had was chicken breasts so I cut them into long chunks and followed the recipe from there.  Didn't have celery, and eliminated the cayenne pepper b'c we don't like spicy.  OMG...THIS was the best recipe ever!  I was still thinking about it the next day and couldn't wait for dinner to have the leftovers!!  Really good comfort food.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!  Will definitely be added to our rotating schedule of recipes.

Veronica......your recipe was featured on AOL as part of a recipe collection for soul food.  It just jumped out at me, as I could taste it in my mind, so I had to try it.  This was sooooooooo delicious, and my whole family loved it, including my 19-month-old grandson, cayenne kick and all.    Even though we mostly eat boneless, skinless chicken breasts, you'll be happy to know that I used bone-in, skin-on thighs, and it was perfect.  After the frying step, I scraped up all the bits in the bottom of the pan, saved them, and threw them back in when I poured in the chicken stock.  Thanks so much......this is a keeper and it will be served here often.

This is a great recipie that I plan on making again because it was so simple and tasty.  I omitted celery (hate the veg) and carrots (raw only for me) from the recipie.  The other changes were using onion and garlic powder, paprika, and pepper to marinate the chicken and then I coated it with flour.  For the raters who stated that the chicken was bland maybe this tip will help.  Besides those changes I kept to everything else.  Thank you for providing the recipie.

This was a little bland for our taste.  I added a little olive oil to the butter to keep the butter from burning, used a little less butter.  After tasting the gravy I added some salt-free Greek seasoning and it was better.  I am going to make this again, omit the carrots and add mushrooms.

I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts, and a little less butter and this came out DELICIOUS! :] It was a big hit and I'll definitely make it again! I served it w/ garlic mashed potatoes and used the sauce as gravy... Perfect!!

Thank you, Veronica, for this recipe. It was superb! It is much tastier than the similar chicken fricasse I usually make. After adding the chicken back to the veggies, I cooked it about 1 1/2 hours longer. By the time it got to the table, the chicken was falling off the bone. I served it over rice with cornbread, purple hull peas, and squash casserole. We topped off the dinner with an easy banana pudding. My husband and children loved it.  Just good ol' Southern comfort!!

It was better the 2nd day. I didn't think it was worth all the time that went into it. My significant other thpight it was great, and he doesn't like to try anything new. The first day the sauce reminded me of chicken gumbo soup, but it did thicken up the mext day. It took forever for the vegetables to cook, and I chopped them up small, so pre-cook the carrots before you add them or be prepared to stand there for 2 or 3 days. If I'm begged, I'll make again, but I won't volunteer

Not what we had expected. The sauce was too soupy, and it was on the bland side. Husband said it didn't have the flavor he thought it should have.  Children would not eat

This was really delicious! Hubby gave this 6 stars... Family definitely wants this again! Easy to make, most of the work was prep. I cut up 2 good sized Texas sweet onions, 6 carrots, and about 4 stalks of celery. Talk about some good eats. Thanks Veronica for sharing this!

I had 2 lbs of chicken tenderloins to use up so I made this and served it over brown rice...yummy.  I did add 1/2 tsp of dried thyme because I like that flavor with chicken. I found 4 inch disposable pot pie tins and used the leftovers with Pillsbury pie crust to make the BEST pot pies.  Whenever I can make two meals out of one cooking session..I'm happy!

I made this for dinner (just for my husband and myself, thought it might be to hot for the kids) and it was wonderful. Kind of like a Pot Pie filling with a spicy flair over rice. I will be making this again.

This is good, but it is a lot of work. I'm not sure that it is quite worth all the work it takes (and all the mess!). I followed the directions exactly, only adjusting the amount of cayenne pepper to my personal taste. I think next time I will try it with chicken breasts to save some time. It is a great recipe, nevertheless. Thanks!

Excellent! I didn't have carrots or celery so I used a can of Veg-All. This was so good, even my 2 year old ate it (he doesn't eat anything!). So creamy and flavorful and the cayenne pepper gave it just the perfect kick. Thanks for this one, it will be a regular!

Great recipe! I cut back on the salt a lot, and next time I will use less onion. After I added the broth I let it boil for 5-10 minuets to thicken up, then added the chicken. the chicken was done in 30 minutes. It was a 3lb chicken. I have a picky eater(Onions ,yuk!) in the family so i strained some of the sauce and it looks just like chicken gray. She never knew the difference. Happy cooking!

Very disappointing.  Can't help wondering what all those other people did to warrant the great reviews.  Very bland.  Curious to see if any better as a leftover.

This was delicious! The chicken was so tender and the flavor was great! I followed the recipe as is down to the bed of rice. The only thing I would change would be to leave out the Cayenne Pepper - even that little bit made it a bit hot! However, my husband loved the little kick it gave so I guess I'll be keeping it in! We both really liked this dish so two thumbs up!

When I first saw this I thought of my Mom's Sunday chicken dinners. You can not imagined how disappointed I was to see the recipe called for brown gravy. Everyone knows chicken is smothered in white milk peppered gravy.

So I made the chicken determined to use the brown gravy, but when it came time to add the brown gravy, I could not do it, I relented and made a pot of white milk peppered gravy that was Oh So Good.

Delicious!  I cut the recipe in half, as this was going to be way too much for my family of four. Worked perfectly with 6 chicken thighs. I had no celery so I doubled the carrot, and used chicken bouillon for the broth. It was really good over mashed potatoes or rice (as I made both as half of us like rice and half of us like potatoes).

Solid recipe. The gravy could have been thicker and the recipe could have used a little more seasoning and maybe a sprinkling of fresh herbs, but it was otherwise very good. I used drumsticks because that was all that  I had on hand. Great dish, stick to your ribs comfort food!

This is so simple and such a comforting dish. You do have to make sure you have time to stay around the stove to commit to  constant stirring  for the rue to be made, but the end results are totally worth it. I did use more butter then required for the frying, and the directions were not real clear as to how long to fry or brown the chicken.   So I browned each side for about 4 min just al little over med, but not med/high. and then when the gravy was made cooked for another 30 min constantly stirring or the gravy would get sticky. Truly a dish that requires attention and a true southern comfort dinner. I server with rice and green beans. This is a keeper,! Thank you for your recipe.

I've made this 2 times now and love it! I skipped th cayenne pepper, didn't have any but didn't miss it. The gravy is delicious, goes well with masked potatoes and rice. I used bone in, skin on chicken thighs. I can't imagine making this without as a majority of flavor comes from skin and bones.

This recipe is both simple and delicious. Prepared it just like the recipe said, only difference being at the end I blended the liquid and veg into a nice, thick gravy to go over the rice. Kids and wife said they could taste the cayenne, but I couldn't... either way, everyone liked it.
The recipe made a LOT of gravy, so this might be something you make the night before you make something you need some good gravy to go with it.
Next time instead of rice, we're gonna do it over fresh, hot biscuits.

Simply delicious! I changed it up a bit since I didn't want to run to the store for cayenne and celery. I substituted red pepper flakes for cayenne and a can of French cut green beans for celery. I also added some fresh spinach to the top and let it simmer the last 5 minutes. I was heavy handed with the butter and flour. My family loved this dish!

Pretty much followed recipe exactly except for using a little Creole seasoning on the chicken instead of salt and pepper, and some extra garlic, and it was great. I did end up thickening the gravy just a little more at the end but that's just personal preference.

Absolutely delicious!  The only changes I made were using a lower-sodium broth, and skipping the 2 tsp. of additional salt.  (I did use a light sprinkle at table, which was perfect.)  This has so much flavor!!  Down home cookin' at it's best.  Thank you for posting, Veronica Rockett.

I followed the directions and ingredient list as stated, but it just didn't suit our tastes. The chicken was really tender, but the gravy was greasy and unappealing. Would have loved to enjoy this one, as it is simple and affordable. Unfortunately, it's a no go in my books.

Really good sauce but way too much butter. The chicken itself was bland but everything tasted great if there was a lot of sauce with every chicken bite. i would make it again but try to cut calories and butter.

I'm not very practiced at browning and pan frying, but thought this recipe looked interesting and sounded good. Best part...I had all the ingredients on hand. I was very pleased with how this turned out and it tasted great! I didn't really measure my onions, carrots and celery, just kind of eye-balled it. I was nervous about the cayenne pepper because my kids don't really like spicy foods, but it was just enough kick without being too much. I added a little more roux to the sauce at the end to thicken it. Served it with rice pilaf and used the sauce as a gravy for the rice. Thanks for the recipe!!

I couldn't add a photo because it was eaten so fast! I made about triple the original recipe. My husband and four kids all loved it. I used 14 legs and 14 thighs for 6 people and there was nothing left over. I personally prefer more seasoning so I added some stuff I had in the cupboard. And to be honest, I'm a guesstimator so while I used all the ingredients called for I can't say that I followed the recipe exactly....I'm not one to measure anything. This was an easy, affordable meal that I was able to throw together last minute. We loved it!

as written, I probably would not make this chicken again. "Medium-high" was much too high a temperature to brown my chicken- it quickly browned the butter, then burned the flour on the chicken and in the pan instead of producing flavorful browned bits on my chicken (I should have listened to my instincts). Also, I had to add more butter than was called for to cook the veggies until they were "softened". This dish is similar to other ones I have made- if I'd followed this recipe as a guideline for flavors while using my own cooking knowledge, it would have been a more successful dish.

Sooo delicious!  I was surprised I could cook something this good!  I followed the directions pretty closely.  I added green peppers and mushrooms to the vegetable mix, and I also threw in some pork tasso with the veggies, just for good measure.  I cooked this for 2 friends from the US South, and I was nervous about meeting their high standards, but they loved it!  I served it with my special mashed potatoes (extra rich, with lots of butter, heavy whipping cream, and cheese mixed in) instead of the traditional rice, and it was heavenly.  I also used the same spices, but to my own taste, and put a pinch of dried basil in, as well.  Can't wait to show off this recipe to others!

This soul food dish was  excellent and  very rich!  Carrots were brilliant, adding color and depth of flavor; they make this version stand out. Pleasantly spiced. As with all simmered dishes, thorough browning is  essential for a savory dish. Will certainly make this again.  Thank you, Veronica!

delicious. served over mashed potatoes. I didn't have cayenne pepper so I tried equal parts cumin and chili powder (about a teaspoon to tablespoon depending on how much strength you like). I also dusted the contents of the pan with ground sage.  tasted wonderful! we'll make this part of our regular regimen, though I will try subbing in some healthy alternatives to the 1/2c butter :)

It was just okay.  The gravy was good after some seasoning, but next time, I wouldn't use the recipe's directions for frying the chicken.  I'll probably use different seasonings (like Season-All) and fry it in oil.  I'll make again, but with more of my own flair.

I forgot about the carrots but thought this turned out good. The only thing i dont like is that the skin of the chicken ends up soggy. My sis and boyfriend pulled the skin off and didnt eat that part, so i might make it in the future minus the skin or just not let the chicken stew in the gravy so long. But the flavor was great.

Made this for dinner for my husband. We both loved it! He said it was "just like my Grandma used to make." I loved the way the chicken browned in the butter, though I added a couple tbsps of canola oil to keep the butter from burning. I used the chopped seasoning my husband buys at HEB (onions, bell pepper, celery, garlic and parsley) and added the chopped carrots. I will definitely make this again.

No doubt I would pay a pretty penny in a restaurant for this. To make at home is so cheap and easy. I was really excited to make my own gravy as I never had before. It turned out so easy and fun! Can't wait to make this for my hubby.

I absolutely LOVED this recipe. I couldn't stop eating it and the crowd loved it too. Kind of a mix between a stew and a soup. The broth is delicious and the chicken was tender. A fantastic cold-weather meal that you will want to repeat over and over again.

Delicious recipe, esp after some alteration: added 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp dried garlic flakes, 1 tsp garlic salt, bay leaves.  Cooking the chicken in the gravy for another 15 min would have made it fall off the bone, which I will do next time. I also substituted olive oil for the butter as my healthier California alternative.  Otherwise I followed the recipe very closely. Really yummy over jasmine rice.

Tastes like a homemade stew! I had a whole chicken and am tired of always making beer can chicken with them, so found this recipe, happened to have all the ingredients, and WOW! Great, down home meal with a little kick. We loved it and have enough leftovers for 2 more meals. This is worth cooking up again or sharing the recipe with friends. Next time I will use less carrots and add small, quartered butter potatoes.

This recipe is fantastic. I have my own recipe, but decided to try something different. I followed the recipe as written except that I used seasoned salt instead of plain salt. It came out perfectly. Seriously. I'm going to have to share this one with my Mom. Smothered chicken is one of her faves.

Really liked this recipe! Took a chance and made it for company, and everyone loved it!  I did use the best parts of a whole cut up chicken, and served it with "smashed" redskin potatoes - yummy!  Will save this recipe and make again and again.  Thanks for sharing.

Cooked it exactly as the recipe calls for and my husband LOVED it! We had it with rice. It's almost a lighter version of a chicken pot pie and without all the work.

Very nice dish.  My husband recommended serving it with waffles and mashed potatoes.  This surprised me since he isn't a fan of chicken and waffles.  We loved the gravy.  I used chicken breast with bones and skin on.

This was my first time making it so I followed the recipe exactly, except I only had chicken breasts,and it came out great!  Even kids loved it (which is rare), so I definitely plan on making this again.

There were so many comments about this recipe that I had to try it!  I was nervous about it after I started taste testing it, but my husband loved it and kids liked it.  I didn't add as many onions - just one large.  And I added parsley for color and a bit of flavor and chili powder for more umph!

Great dish, easy to make. It will become a part of my "rotation". My only regret is that I only had boneless/skinless breast at the time and although I know it's the healthier choice (and it was yummy)but I'm sure that it would be off the charts with fatty thighs. Mmmmmmmm!

This turned out great and looked impressive. I used chicken thighs. I should've browned them more because the skin and breading wanted to come off at the end. It was still wonderful and the chicken was so moist and tender!

This is really good.  I spiced it up a little bit more because it was bland.  I also reduced everything because I didn't use a whole chicken.  Next time I think I will not use carrots, they were a little to hard.  The recipe has a wonderful texture.  I will be making this a lot this winter.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is always a hit- I've made this about 5 times now. Its a great winter comfort food. The thing I do differently is that I use 1/2 the amount of butter and skinless, boneless chicken thighs. Other than reducing the fat, this really doesn't require any other changes! I serve it over mashed potatoes... its just perfection!

This was really good the first time that I made it. I used 3 large frozen pieces of chicken from a bulk bag at Sam's Club for the chicken, and instead of chicken broth I took 4 bullion cubes to 3 cups boiling water, and omitted the salt from the recipe. 

When I made it the second time I used chicken thighs and deboned them, and used regular chicken broth. There just wasn't as much flavor. 

So I definitely recommend using the bullion and not thighs.

And serve over mashed potatoes. Yum!

Tried this for my family (three guys) and they all loved it.  Very flavorful and easy to make.  My only addition was sliced baby bella (portabella) mushrooms.  Gravy was delish!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

I didn't think it had much flavor.  We ate the left overs because it wasn't bad, but I wouldn't make it again.  With the lack of flavor it's not worth all the work.

This is a wonderful base recipe (thanks so much) but it I tweaked it to get my desired results. Seasoned both my chicken and dredging flour w/ Greek seasoning, garlic salt, and cracked pepper. Omitted the carrots. Used 3 heaping tbs of flour the make gravy thick, used one can of chicken and one can of beef broth for deep flavor concentration. No cayenne instead I added some Tony Chachere’s. I had to cook it 30 min longer and it was worth the wait. Very flavorful, moist, and tender. Served gravy over mashed potatoes and had to be rolled upstairs to bed b/c I ate way too much. lol. Thanks for sharing! I will make this again!!!

Only using 3 pieces of chicken I halved the recipe.  I used jarred roasted minced garlic and baby carrots along with the celery and onion. I didn't have to remove any butter after browning the chicken and the vegetables sauteed very well in under 5 minutes.  The sauce thickened while the chicken finished cooking and was a delicious alternative to the bland juice from chicken and dumplings.

Great recipe!  I'm always looking for main course meals to prepare on top of the stove.  This tasted just like my Great Aunt's smothered chicken that I remembered from my childhood.  I'll make this again and again!

I was excited to try this recipe. I chopped the onions, celery, and carrots in the food oster. I seasoned the chicken with my usual seasoning...being salt, pepper, garlic powder, parsley, and season all I also use the same seasoning in the flour. Because I like a lot of garlic I put about six cloves of chopped garlic and omitted the caynne pepper due to little ones. Everyone loved it and are ready for left overs. My side dishes were asparagas and ranch style beans. It was just an awesome meal. REAL rich!!!!

Great tasty recipe!  Soul Food places will use Accent (MSG) in place of salt.  That is the secret ingredient that sets this recipe apart from the one you make at home.  Give it a try.

This was a big hit and it was plate lickin' good! I used half the salt,  as the broth I used was salty. Found this was plenty for flavor.  Anyway, a good comfort food meal and we will definitely make it again.

The video said add chicken and cook 5 minutes more covered....the chef said 30 minutes to let it season, simmer, and cook the rest - cook for 30. I’m feeding toddlers for dinner so I pop it in the oven after browning, but the flavors are on point! I serve with white rice and bacon sautéed spinach.

I've made this several times.  I'm not a fan of chicken breast but if you cook it right this Is amazing. I've also tried wings cause that's all I had and it was still great. Make sure your gravy is the right consistency and seasoned how you like before adding the chicken. Not too thick.  Remember the gravy will get thicker as it cooks. The celery does something wonderful to this dish.

My family absolutely loved it! I will make this again and again! The gravy is absolutely delicious and the chicken is soooo tender. This reminds me of when i was a little girl for Sunday dinner. I used more than just salt and pepper. I like to use the slap yo mama seasoning for a little spice. yummm!

Very good and very different. I didn't have celery but I did have leaks. I still like it but will try celery next time....maybe. i I'm a bit afraid it might taste a little like a chicken pot pie once I add celery but either way that's good too

Easy to make I made a few changes. I used chicken breast instead of bone-in.  I also opted out of the celery and used only 1/4 stick of butter and olive oil to pan fry the chicken. When making the gravy I used the left over seasoned flour mix to add with the chicken broth.   This dish is all about seasoning to taste. Taste your food as you go is they key. The family really love it and everyone had seconds!

This was tasty, but.... It's not at all "gravy-like" and I am indeed a  pan gravy girl from waaaay back.  I made a roux and, in fact, a little extra that I put aside in case it was needed. But if you use skin-on chicken--and yes, you SHOULD--you're going to get more drippings as you simmer, thus, making whatever gravy you have getting soupy. Good flavors, but expectation of fried chicken in gravy didn't happen.

Soul Smothered Chicken is probably my favorite chicken recipe. I make this when I have time to play in the kitchen. I never make it the same, and I no longer measure ingredients. we raise our own chickens and this recipe is good for those really big tough chickens that went twelve weeks before we butchered them. The cooking time in this recipe cooks the toughness out of the tough older chicken. I might do this recipe today since it's a rainy Saturday in January.

This has become my family's favorite..I did make a few changes that include taking out the carrots and addiing mushrooms. I also find that the onion and celery cook down so I remove them and add them back in the last 20 minutes.

Really good meal.  I followed the  recipe very closely, except I gave my vegetables a few spins in the Ninja so they were chopped really fine.  Also, I reserved 3 tbsp of the fat (not just 1) to mix back in with the 3 tbsp of flour and the vegetables to form the roux.  This time, I also left out the cayenne, and I think that was a mistake, as it needed a little more "oomph."  Very tasty all around, though.

I used 7 trimmed bone-in skin -on chicken thighs, seasoned flour with Old Bay Seasoning. Used only 2 T butter and olive oil.  Cleaned skillet after browning chicken to further reduce fat.since I reduced the fat and salt, I added other herbs such as sage, thyme, paprika, basil, about a teaspoon of each.

In the west end of Charleston, SC, where I grow up, my mother made a stewed chicken dish that I loved. Unfortunately, I could not remember how to make it and came looking in all recipes for a recipe.  Well, I did not find the stewed chicken recipe, only because I got side tracked by this smothered chicken recipe!! 
My husband can be a pretty picky eater and I wasn't sure how this was going to go over but, he enjoyed it. I did tweak it just a bit as I prefer the dark meat over chicken breasts and used petite carrots (what I had in the frig). I pretty much followed the recipe from there and was really pleased how it turned out. Will make again--great cold weather dish.

Delicious! I halved the recipe and used boneless skinless chicken breast instead. I did 20 minutes for the final simmering. It worked out great! I loved the taste of the sauce, especially with the cayenne kick.

This dish is delicious and I can't wait to make it again!  I did use boneless chicken breast because that's what I had on hand, next time I'll try it with bone in. The left overs didn't last long and I was sad to see them go!

I made it with oven-fried coating and used Golden Mushroom soup (instead of regular mushroom)adding a small can of  mushrooms. My family loves it!  
We use it for ground beef with noodles or rice as well.

I made a few changes only because I can't have calcium. So I used chicken broth mixed with Publix Non-Dairy creamer for the gravy. My husband who's picky about chicken loved it and so no leftovers!

This is a great recipe.....and as with any other recipe, season to your taste!!!! I used garlic powder, sea salt, onion powder, pepper, and a little New Orleans seasoning to season the chicken first and put it in the fridge overnight. I added multi-color bell pepper and onions (no carrots or celery), and used an extra tablespoon of flour to thicken the gravy. And it was DELICIOUS. This recipe has all the basics you need to make a great southern-style smothered chicken. And if you let the onions brown a little your gravy will be dark.

Best gravy ever! I am a terrible homemade gravy maker but this came out foolproof. Made mostly as written subbing berbere seasoning for cayenne pepper. Goes great with everything. Kudos to the author

This one is going in the recipe book without a doubt. If a light meal is what you're looking for this isn't it. It was much easier to make than I had anticipated and the flavor is amazing. Definitely a crowd pleaser. I'll be making this again.

This was a huge hit with everyone in the family!
I will be making it again.  I prepared it exactly as stated. I always do when I am cooking something for the first time.
Then I can alter it to our taste, if need be.  There was no need to change a thing.  Really delicious.

I used coconut oil instead of butter and I reduced the amount. (Just another option; I love butter too). I used all drumsticks. The only  veggies that I used were celery,  yellow onions and green onions.  I cooked it 30 minutes covered on low,  then I saw it and decided to uncover and cook it for 20 more minutes. Although the onion soup that it makes is really tasty by itself.

My husband loved this! He specifically said that this is one is a keeper and is one of his favorite chicken recipes!

I made a few adjustments - I used a ton of garlic powder in addition to the garlic in the recipe.  I added beef bullion because I wanted a deeper flavor and I did not use carrots because I didnt have any. I also didnt use a whole chicken but instead 8 thighs and 8 legs.

The mean was delicious - just a bummer that I didnt make more!

I followed this step by step and was very pleased with the result.  My husband (who isn't a fan of anything smothered) absolutely LOVED this dish. My 2 and 3 year old (very picky eaters) asked for seconds. I was hesitant at first because I had never made a gravy before but I'm glad I tried this recipe. Simple, low cost and delicious.

This is comfort food at its best.  My husband the picky eater ate without a complaint.  I made this  pretty much to the tee, I just used less onion.  Next time I'll add some different seasoning, just to make it my own.  However it's delish as is, thanks for the excellent recipe.

I make this for my hubby and 4 boys. They love it. I have made it with bone in/skin on chicken and boneless skinless chicken breast and they enjoyed it both ways. There is less grease when you use only white meat. The only modifications I make are: I use onion powder instead of onions, add a little garlic, omit pepper, and sometimes I add peas. Great dish

I made this and it was absolutely delicious. I made it along with some potato pancakes. I only had chicken thighs and I omitted the celery and carrots.  I also let it simmer for about 45 minutes. I will definitely make this again.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because it's simple, delicious, and you can create it to your tastes. On my way home from a long day, I was trying to figure out what to do with a family pack of drumsticks (8 pieces) and this was the winner. Use the seasoning measurements as an estimate, but go for a little more salt when seasoning the chicken if you want to avoid a bland dish. To make prep/cooking a little quicker, chop your carrots/celery/onion and garlic while the chicken is browning. I chopped the veggies roughly - a little more than half an inch - as the long cooking time could make small pieces too soggy during the simmer stage. I used some of the leftover flour from dredging to add to the pan for thickening the broth (no need to waste flour). You may want to add a bit more if you're interested in a thicker gravy/sauce. I also added a few extra pinches of cayenne, because I like a little kick to my food. 

I used a cast iron skillet which worked well, and since I had no lid, placed aluminum foil over the top during the simmering stage.  It made the house smell great while cooking and my boyfriend had to talk himself out of a third helping! It was so good. Packed some for lunch the next day and was not disappointed. Served it with mashed potatoes and peas. Will be going into my recipe rotation. :)

This was very yummy!!
I DID change a couple of things though. I used chicken breasts (I don't  like having to pick meat off the bone. ..JUST give me MEAT!!) I also left out the cayenne  peppers (not a BIG fan of spicy foods), and I used Ms. Dash" Table Blend " instead of salt.  Oh yeah.....and I only used (a little over) half of a large onion .  This was VERY GOOD.......and I'll  DEFINITELY  be using this recipe  again!!!

This is delicious! I lightly seasoned chicken with Lawry's seasoned salt prior to dredging in flour so I reduced salt in broth by half. I also simmered for an hour rather than 30 minutes and chicken was fall off the bone tender and so very tasty. Served with baked potatoes mashed with butter and sour cream. This was a great Sunday dinner. Thank you for the recipe!

Pretty good. Against my better judgement, I cooked it exact to the recipe the first time. Took a lot longer and didn't quite come out how I wanted. Cooked it again last night and changed the following things.

First I cooked the veggies for about 10 minutes and set them aside. Browned chicken, set it aside and kept ALL of the butter. Added the flour and cooked it over medium heat until it started to brown some. Added broth, seasoned a bit more, then replaced chicken and veggies. Covered and cooked about an hour on low.

I seasoned my chicken with Zatarains Creole Seasoning and my flour.  I also did not drain any butter after browning my chicken, in fact I added a little more when I added my vegetables. I also added Thyme and Rosemary to my vegetables. Once I let cook for 30min, and gravy was thick. I placed in oven and let the top of chicken get a little more brown, slightly crisp at the top. Overall, great recipe.

The chicken turned out average (I want to try it again).  The gravy though was amazing!  Full of vegetables and flavor.  I'm going to make the gravy alone and eat with rice on poor/vegetarian nights.  The household loved it.  The gravy also tasted wonderful over stuffing.  

It all did take longer to cook than the recipe said though.  Also the gravy seemed really thin when I cooked it.  I was convinced I botched it.  But it thickened up A LOT overnight.

This chicken dish is Delicious!! My husband loves it! I made them couple times in the past month, and my husband is asking me to make it again! I did add in potato the second time since my husband likes potato and it came out just as good! I'll be making it very often!

I used boneless chicken breasts and cut them into smaller pieces so they would cook faster.  I cut back significantly on the butter, and just used the veggies I had on hand, which probably wasn't as much as was called for.  I thought this was really good, but should be served over rice or potatoes.  I tried the leftovers with mashed potatoes the following day, and it was really good!  The sauce almost serves as a gravy.  I"ll definitely make this again.

This was a pretty simple recipe to follow and it turned out very good. I did add additional seasoning to the gravy such as ascent and creole seasoning because it did taste a tad bland. I made this recipes with white rice and cornbread for Sunday dinner and will be making it again.

Excellent recipe!
I took off one star only because I've consistently found that the cooking time it's too short. To get the chicken cooked to the point that I'm comfortable serving it to my kids, it needs to a full hour at the end

I agree with the people who called it a little bland.  That is not a problem.  I added more spices: lemon pepper and garlic to the flour.  I also soaked the chicken in butter-milk before dredging in the flour mixture. For the gravy rue: the flavor is in the celery leaves, not the stalks. I like the fact that the recipe is so forgiving and I can add my own flare.

Want to impress your friends? Throw this down and they'll swear you were raised in the South! We had a soul food cook off at work and us white guys took home the gold. Never had so many sisters coming to me for tips in my life. Don't be afraid to tweak this one to your tastes. This is very durable.

This was so good! I could eat this gravy with the rice like soup! YUM! I, unfortunately, had to use chicken breast because it was all I had. It was still really great, but I could imagine it would taste better with the whole chicken. It was very very easy to make (though there is a lot of prep work with the chopping). Thanks!

This recipe was delicious and flavourful. My only complaint is that the bit of batter got kind of soggy after simmering in the gravy. Otherwise it was great! I used boneless, skinless chicken breast, as that's what I had on hand and it turned out moist and tasty! Will make again.

I contemplated giving this four stars because I honestly didn't like the dish very much. Especially because of all the hassle for a mediocre dish. However, my family enjoyed it and said that it was like the filling of a chicken pot pie so I stretched for four stars. On a sidenote I used skinless chicken breast for the recipe and added freshly chopped garlic.

I made this last night and it was wonderful! I used sea salt and just put some on each piece  along with the pepper. I definately used more than the recipe called for. But omitted the salt and pepper at the end since I used plenty in the first part of pan frying the chicken. I used one extra clove of garlic and added some mushrooms that I needed to move. Put in the correct measurements of carrots,onions and celery. But added extra cayenne pepper for a little extra kick. It turned out perfect and husband was extremely pleased. I cant wait to make this again.Thanks for the great recipe!

Great comfort food. Reminds me of a chicken goulash or cacciatore. I substituted chopped summer squash and white mushrooms for the carrots and celery because it's what I had on hand. The flavors worked well with the recipe. The "gravy" didn't thicken much after simmering so I added some corn starch at the end to thicken it a little. Excellent over white rice as suggested.

Great Recipe!!!!  For months my husband had been saying that he wanted some old-fashioned smothered chicken the way they used to make in the South.  I tried to follow the directions to the letter and let me tell ya', this smothered chicken is "the BOMB!!"  I used chicken thighs and legs only because I didn't have time to cut up a whole chicken.  This chicken is moist, flavorful and just dang good.  The gravy that it makes is incredible.  This recipe is a keeper.

Where did I go wrong? Why didn't I have brown gravy? The recipe was pretty bland also. I've added some additional seasoning but not sure how it will taste.

How did my Texan ancestors manage to bring grits, hominy, chicken fried steak and greens to Arizona with them but not this? This was my first time even eating smothered chicken. So, so good. I used boneless, skinless thighs because that's what I had. I also added a portobello mushroom to the veggies because I love them in just about anything. Ate it without rice or taters to avoid any more carbs. Will definitely be making this again.

I used leg quarters for this recipe and it took twice as long to cook as the time stated. I really didn't care for the way the skin was so slimy either. The flavor was good, but I doubt I will make this again. It just frustrated me.

I've cooked this dish a few times and it's always a winner! I like to use a pre-made roux vs. just adding flour to veggies to make a thicker roux. That's it and I also double or triple the veggies cause I love 'em.

It was a great recipe..I used chicken breasts and red onion instead - omitted the celery. I tasted the gravy in each step to make sure it was seasoned properly...and I cut most of the ingredients by half except the butter. It came out amazingly moist and tender...I left the chicken a little longer in the butter and it was brown and formed a very nice crust so when incorporated with the gravy - it wasn't soggy turned out just right! Absolutely loved it!

This is simply delicious.  I served it over quinoa . I did not have cayenne pepper or celery so did not use.  I used olive oil instead of butter and just a couple of tablespoons.  And I used leftover chicken from both chicken soup and baked chicken.  Amazing for leftover chicken.

Made this receipe for dinner last night and my husband just loved it.  Only change I made was to use boneless chicken thighs as he does not like bones in his food.  Flavor was great and I would diffinitely list this as a comfort food.

This is a great recipe. I like the simple yet perfect ingredients. Followed as written except for I used a red onion simply because I didn't have any other kind. I'm disappointed, however, not in the recipe, but in my lack of ability when it comes to browning. All the crust floated off in the gravy and I can't figure out what I am doing wrong (happens with other similar recipes)! Any expert advice would be appreciated! As for the recipe...it's a keeper for sure! Thank you!

This is one of my favorites from Allrecipes, and I have made it many times over the years. I follow this exactly as written, only I use chicken legs instead of a cut up whole chicken. It's great served over rice with a side salad!

Best smothered chicken recipe that has ever been made in my kitchen!  Mine took a little longer because I only had split breasts.  Even my 3 yr old ate it :)

Excellent! My first attempt at smothered chicken.  I used boneless chicken thighs as I don't like eating meat from the bone unless it's fried chicken (a weird quirk I know).  Will definitely make again.  Only problem was no leftovers!

This was scrumptious!  I made it with white rice, green bean casserole, and corn bread muffins and we were in hog heaven!  I was a little wary of all the onions, but I am glad I followed the recipe exactly as it was, I couldn't even tell onions were in there once it was cooked and we ate it!  Yum! I think the leftovers even tasted better the next day.

This was delicious!  However, if you use chicken bouillon to make the broth, omit the 2 tsp. salt.

My husband really liked this.  I modified the recipe to use left-over chicken.  It was wonderful.  I'm going to make it again tody.  I made a rost chicken and have leftovers.  This time I'm adding mushrooms.

This was a great chicken dish.  My husband and I both love Cajun food, so I doubled the cayenne pepper.  It had just the right "bite" to it.

Recipe had flavor but I did not like the taste of the gravy.  Took longer than 30 minutes to get done.  I would try again, but maybe play around with different seasonings for a different taste

I have to say did not follow this one completely as hubby was sent for cayenne pepper but returned with just ground black (bless him for trying) I added a little chilli and paprika and thought it would be just as good, as others loved the recipe without the cayenne. Unfortunately for most of us apart from hubby (just being kind I think) really thought the flavour was not there and thickening gravy with so much flour just really doesn't do it for me (tip for others quickly dip your chicken in the oil to coat then the flour - not with your fingers though!!) Although saying that it did state in the recipe two portions of flour and was not clear at all as to when to use each and no doubt I got it wrong but that can happen when people don't give you the correct and clear instructions. Once again most people like it and our family doesn't. I really hadn't considered myself to be that picky but perhaps I was wrong.

Fairly easy, and pretty tasty.  I cut down the recipe, and used boneless chicken breast cut into bit size chuncks.  If I make it again, i'll add a bit more broth and vegetables, to increase the amount of sauce.

Yes, the chicken was tender and juicy, but the flavor was lacking.  Family thought it was just so-so...probably won't make it again.    Followed directions exactly...sorry it didn't work for us.

This is absolutely great.  Tried it a couple of weeks ago and been thinking about it ever since so I'll make again tonight.  Easy to make and so flavorful.
