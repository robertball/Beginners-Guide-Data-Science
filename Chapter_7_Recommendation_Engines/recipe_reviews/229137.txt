How fun! The recipe submitter suggest to use different food coloring to get the desired color but don't get hung up on that. I started experimenting and my end results wasn't any better than what it started out as. Plus, once the "grey" sherbet goes on it takes over and it really doesn't matter what color the punch is below. The "soap suds" (sherbet) stay on top the entire time and that is really all you see.
