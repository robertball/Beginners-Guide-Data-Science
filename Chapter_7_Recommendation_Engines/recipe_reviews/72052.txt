This was recommended to me by a woman who's husband was stationed in Guam years ago. I needed to make it for a party that I was attending and used it with Kalua Pig from this site and steamed rice. It was delicious. I made it exactly as written. We did have some party goers that I was not familiar with their taste buds so was unsure if the spice/heat was going to be too much or not enough. For this crowd it was perfect. Next time I make it for us, I will increase the pepper flakes as I like spice. Otherwise, just wonderful. Thanks for submitting.

Ten years ago my husband and I were stationed in Guam through the Marine Corps. Finadeni was one of our favorite native recipes.  We add fresh diced tomatoes to the recipe as well.  To this day, my husband can't eat rice without making Finadeni!

I love finadeni and make it all the time.  You can use either lemon juice or vinegar.  Portions of soy and acid depend on personal taste--I prefer more acid.  Start with less and work up to your liking.  I also use chopped (not minced) white onion and finely minced Thai peppers (AKA boonie peppers).  This is great on so many things--rice, chicken, beef, potatoe salad, etc.

This is a great sauce.  A neighbor showed us how to make this initially and we use white onions instead of green.  LOVE it, especially with grilled elk or venison.  After awhile we started tweaking it to our tastes, but these measurements are probably a good place to start. Thanks!

On Guam, every family has its own brand of finadene, and each and every one is "the best".  I like mine "gof pika" very hot with lots of lemon juice to cut the heat -- not!  Whoever finds the best recipe to bottle -- while preserving the essential crunchiness of darkened onions, will be a millionaire!  Biba Chamoru!

I love finadeni and this is the perfect recipe!  Goes perfect with both white and red rice.  We also use leftovers to marinate chicken in.

We love Finadeni! We use cayenne pepper though, and chopped onions, and usually half soy and half vinegar, depending on how much we're making, but usually for our family, we use 1/2 a cup of each.  I will also replace lemon for vinegar when I'm making chicken, any other meat however, I use vinegar.  We also eat Finadeni over our baked potatoes!!!

There are so many variations of Finadene, this is a good one. I use fresh red Thai peppers and chopped white onion.

My mom is from guam but she uses vinegar instead of lemon plus she adds boonie peppers, green onions and sweet onions. My boys eat it with rice and makes a good dip for your meat.

Lived in Guam 13 years and this is a good recipe. I personally prefer vinegar to lemon juice but either choice makes for a good Finadeni. I add diced regular onions to mine.

Finadeni is the best of all sauces.  I agree with some of the other reviewers...the amount of lemon juice is a personal choice.  I use 1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce and 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice.  I also prefer jalapenos that have been roasted... seeded (with the ribs removed).

My mother's Guamanian and like another reviewer, she adds chopped tomatoes but also uses jalapeno peppers, which she scorches over the stove, cuts up & adds.

HAFA ADAI ! It's nice to see a Chamorro recipe out here.  Usually all the measuring is all done by eye so sometimes its hard to share our delicious foods. p.s. yellow peppers are alot less hot-my kids love this but sometimes a little too hot :)

I thought the lemon juice flavor on this, was way too dominant. I had some store bought chicken and cilantro dumplings, that I was looking for something to dip them in. This popped up at the right time. I ended up adding a little more soy sauce and about 1/2 tsp each of minced garlic and sesame oil to cut through the lemon flavor. I think, the recipe would have been fine if I just would have used rice wine vinegar. I am not sure, but will try that next time. ty

The only thing I did different is use 1 Lemon and 1 Lime. The strange little Lemon in Guam tastes a mixture of lemon & Lime, yet the citrus is green on the outside and orange inside. Wish we could get them in the US. The Wild Boonie peppers used in Guam, are pretty close to a Thai pepper. But it you try using a different kind of pepper. It "must" be fresh.

I'm not Guam but I grew up having both soy sauce and lemon as a common condiment. I usually mix it in my rice depending on the dish such as fried fish, grilled steak or thinly dry-fried pork. Though, I've never had it with green onions...thought it was a nice change.

This is such a nice sauce which I served with homemade egg rolls a few weeks ago. Using low sodium soy sauce is definitely a benefit. Thanks Cinnamon!

Back in 1991, we lived in Guam for two years and absolutely loved this sauce.  I had forgotten how to make it.  It was more lemony than we remembered, however, I will try it again with half the lemon juice.  Thanks for the trip down memory lane.

I have made this dozens of times... sometimes with vinegar and also with lemon juice. Either recipe is great! 
We usually marinate pork chops or country style ribs in it. Also we cut pucks of white or yellow onions to ~ 1/4”  and grill them all! The onions turn out savory sweet and the pork ends up rich tangy and spicy... yummy delish.

This is one of my faves in the household I learned to make it in we'd use both lemon juice and a bit of distilled vinegar and use a lot more veg like cucumbers, carrots, and jalapenos  it's amazing over rice or my fave was putting it over drained ramen noodles. But it's so good on meat... I personally could eat it on anything  : )
