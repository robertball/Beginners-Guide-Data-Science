key ingredients that are missing: fresh ginger: cut into matchsticks: 2 to 4 tablespoons fresh cilantro 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup  Haldi powder (turmeric): yellow spice common to pakistani and indian cooking. 1/2 teaspoon white vinegar: 1.5 teaspoons Tomatoes... for 4 pounds of chicken you need at least 8 to 10 large tomatoes  fine ground black pepper: adds real authentic flavor  to start off with blend all the tomatoes in a blender till its fully crushed in a saucepan or large frying pan heat oil till hot and add tomatoes coook till fully reduced and the color of your tomatoes is a deep red.   this step will reduce your cooking time.  now that your tomatoes are simmering take a large pot and heat oil in it. when mostly hot add the fresh ginger paste, 2 tablespoons are enough for 4 pounds of chicken.  stir the ginger around in the oil so that you can release the flavours of the ginger. after one minute, add all the chicken... your ginger should not burn or change color.   stir the chicken till its no longer pink on all sides using a large wooden spoon. add salt, Turmeric or Haldi powder, and black pepper. A few splashes of water can be added to give a light gravy... cook till meat is 3/4 cooked. stir in the cooked tomatoes to chicken. add chilies whole,cover and cook on low heat about 10 minutes. uncover and add ginger and cilantro. stir till combined. add vinegar, stir, remove from heat and serve. NOW its a 5 star recipe... all pepers can be adjusted to liking, jalapenos r better.

I made several mistakes with this recipe.  My pepper grinder broke so I tried to use a mortar and pestle to grind the peppercorns.  That's not a great idea, let me tell you.  My peppercorns stayed virtually whole so I had to pick them out while I ate it.  That would of course be my fault, and not the recipe.  I used one serrano and tasted it.  IT WAS HOT!  To save the meal, I threw in a can of light coconut milk (my cure-all for asian recipes that get to spicy).  It was very tasty.  Next time I'll have a pepper grinder that works and I'll start with less hot pepper.  Of course, it was quite so delicious that I may add the coconut milk anyway.

It had a nice flavor from the pepper and ginger but it was a little too plane for me.

This in one of my favorite recipes.  I tried this in an Indian restaurant and it was really yummy!  So I came to all recipes and this one fits really nice.  I also serve this with rice (spanish works well) and I also added some cabbage to mine!  Totally yummy indian recipe!  Try it!
