I've made this with some friends a couple of times. The second time we made this with only two servings, and used a tablespoon of cayenne instead of the pepper flakes. It was crazy hot but so delicious and flavorful. I love spicy foods and I can't get enough of this.

This was an outstanding Winter chicken stew! It is spicy but there is a hint of sweetness. The potatoes and carrots offset the spiciness and lend heartiness to the tasty broth. We made it exactly like the recipe and would change nothing!

Very authentic! My boyfriends mom owns a restaurant in Korea and it tastes the same as the one she makes! We doubled the recipe for the sauce as we like it a bit soupier/saucier!

Followed the recipe but with 1# chicken breast & 1# thighs plus 1 tbs corn starch slurry. Really nice flavors and heat. Was confused by bone-in chicken "cut into small pieces" hence the breast & thighs. Fed 2 people with enough left over for another meal that we want to serve over rice. A keeper & do again.

Probably the worst recipe I’ve tried, and I’ve tried many (maangchi, Korean bapsang, etc.).  I was left with a lot of dark colored liquid instead of a red one. Had a feeling it wasn’t going to turn out very good, especially when the directions had you put most of the ingredients at the same time... as a Korean, was very disappointed with this recipe. :(

Definitely spicy and I didn't even use the full amount of red pepper flakes. The broth is interesting - a hint of sweet - the more I ate, the more I liked it.

Thank you! It worked great. I didn't use rice wine, onions, scallions, sesame seeds or oil. Still tasted great! Used an Asian seasoning. Thank you.
