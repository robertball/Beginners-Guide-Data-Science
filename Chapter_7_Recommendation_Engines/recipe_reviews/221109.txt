Makes a very large cake that is absolutely yummy. I have been searching for a good coconut cake and I have now found it. It appears to be more of a pound cake. Will make this again, and again and again. Made recipe according to directions which were very easy to follow.

This cake is a hit for many reasons. It is BIG and with the addition of a tad bit more salt - it would be perfect. I increased it to 1/2 t. and will do more next time.  3/4 or 1 teaspoon seems about right. Other than that I made it as directed and it came out fine. My oven seems a bit slow so I did 310' and it was perfect right at the 90 minute mark. I did use coconut oil with unsalted butter in the frosting and it is superb.  If I can next time I would like to bake it a couple days ahead and let it develop its best flavor before frosting and serving.  Thank you for sharing this gem!

This cake was absolutely amazing!  I did not frost the cake, just ate it the way it was.  Yummy!  I will definitely make this again.

Fantastic recipe!  It is super moist, I only used a 1/2 recipe and made it in a bundt pan for 60 min came out perfect!  Served with fresh berries and whip cream it is a hit.  So far we have made it twice, next time we are going to try it as muffin tops :-)

I was looking for a coconut cake and found this recipe when looking through an old Allrecipes magazine.  This is a coconut pound cake not a traditional layer cake. I loved it and did my office.  The cake is moist and flavorful.  I did add a tsp of coconut extract to the batter and frosting (decreased vanilla in icing to 1 tsp) to ramp up the flavor of coconut.  The icing whips up light and fluffy.  It's the perfect contrast to the sweetness of the cake.    Will bake it again.

This cake was delicious! Not overly sweet and a wonderful coconut flavor throughout. The cake batter itself was addicting! It made a perfect Easter cake, which I brought to my family gathering and everyone loved it. I had to bake it about 20 minutes longer because the batter was still gooey inside after the 90 minutes. The only actual problem I had was that my cake stuck to the pan and so the outer crust didn't look very pretty when I got it out. I just completely covered it with frosting and no one new the difference, but I think the recipe needs to include flouring the bundt pan. I'm assuming that was my problem since I didn't do that. I'll keep this recipe for the future and I've already passed it onto my mom.

I made a few changes to speed up the baking time because it was such a hot, humid day.  I made half the recipe, baking it in my Nordic Ware Bundt Quartet Pan and in a 325° oven.  The baking time was significantly reduced to 50 minutes.  The cake had a wonderful texture with a buttery, subtle coconut flavor.  The frosting was the perfect concoction for highlighting the coconut.

I think this is the best cake I have ever tasted.  I made the recipe as written, except that I used frozen coconut (thawed), and increased the oven temperature to 325 degrees.  The cake is heavy like a pound cake and the frosting is light and fluffy.  Great flavor - refreshing and sweet, but not too sweet.  Perfect!  Thank you Diana for submitting this awesome recipe!

Except for using plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream (it was what I had on hand) and 1/4 tsp salt in the frosting to cut sweetness, I completely followed the recipe.  I was surprised how much the cake rose, though at my house it took 2 full hours. It didn't fall after I took it out of the oven like a cake sometimes will.  
I loved the consistency of the frosting, I thought a long time against using solid Crisco and using butter instead (will use all butter next time), but used the shortening after all.  
I tried to stick the coconut on the sides of the cake, like with a butter cream, it didn't stick as well, so I would put the coconut on top next time.
My family enjoyed the cake, my husband loved it; to me it was very heavy.  It reminded me of muffin texture and there was an under-taste  I can't figure out.   Don't get me wrong, it was very good, I would make it again, maybe topped with fresh strawberries or other fresh fruit.  
This cake is hearty and will travel well, I plan to take it to a pot luck affair in July. Maybe I'll frost it on-site.
I am an experienced baker, if you are a patient newby, you can do it, but this was a time-consuming recipe and might be overwhelming to try without confidence.  Using a mixer is your best bet.

Coconut cake is my favorite, so I decided to make this for Christmas. Should have tested the recipe before making it for company. Followed the recipe without any changes. Not sure what went wrong, but it was awful. Not only was it too dense, but it was also dry. Won't make again. Loved the icing though and will use it again.

I really liked this cake. I made mine in a 9x15 pan instead of a tube pan suggested. I was a little nervous baking for that long but at 300° I figured why not? It was surprisingly not very sweet to the taste buds considering how much sugar was in the batter and frosting.

This is a wonderful cake.  I use unsweetened coconut which makes it less sweet.  I like the dense texture and rich taste.  You could even eat it without the icing.  This is a Easter staple in our family.  It does make a very large cake.  I've recently started making a half batch and it works fine - only shorten the baking time.

Delicious! The only change I made was adding a half tsp of salt instead of 1/4 tsp based on another review. Also, added the sour cream and vanilla after I’d added the coconut because I’d forgotten to do it with the last egg. Baked for exactly 90 minutes and it was amazing. Yes, makes a big cake. I added way more coconut to the icing because I kept trying to get it to stick to the sides. Husband LOVED!

I was so looking forward to a good coconut cake. This cake didn't have much flavor. It was very dense , heavy and barely any taste at all. I would not recommend this unless you want a pound cake. I was very disappointed.

Looks good and going on the to-do list. Giving it 4 for potential since I haven't actually made it yet.

Question: The recipe says tube pan, but the picture is of mini bundts. Anybody know how many mini bundts, or approximately how much batter, this recipe makes? I can see festive little holiday cakes...
