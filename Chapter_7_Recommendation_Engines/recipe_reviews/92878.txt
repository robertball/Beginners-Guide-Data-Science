I have to say that when I saw this recipe I thought "Eh, nothing more than glorified rice krispy treats..." but boy was I wrong.  The mixture of tastes in this recipe is outstanding and the texture is, in my opinion, much superior to RKTs.  I did go ahead and add the miniature chocolate chips while the mixture was still warm so they melted about halfway as I stirred and this made a nice look/flavor in the finished product.   I didn't make any other adjustments other than that my box of cereal was 16 oz instead of 12 oz and I adjusted the other measurements in proportion.   When we tasted them we were very surprised at how good they were... I mean, I didn't expect they would be bad or I wouldn't have made them.  I chose the recipe, however just because I was making rich brownies for something, needed another dessert, and chose this because it would be slightly different.  I was making an extra pan of one and let my husband choose by reading the recipes to him.  He chose the brownies; but after tasting both he said he wished he had chosen these.  He kept sneaking in to steal more of them before I could take them to our event.  I will absolutely make these again.  Probably tomorrow!!

My kids and husband loved these! My oldest son and I made these together and after we'd assembled them, we scooped them up with an ice cream scoop and dropped them on wax paper. We then melted some semi-sweet chocolate chips in a makeshift double boiler and drizzled it over the top. Took it up another notch. They loved it. This one's a keeper.

I made these with Special K Cinnamon Pecan Cereal and it was delicious. I added a little extra cinnamon. I got a lot of wonderful reviews on this. I am sure you can use different types of cereal like Corn Flakes or Bran Flakes.

These were just too sweet for me.  No one in the family thought they were very good.  I think we will stick to the traditional s'mores over the camp fire.

WOW, thanks so much for this recipe. I was looking for the classic recipe and came across yours. I had a mix of peanut butter chips and milk chocolate chips that I added to the butter, peanut butter and marshmallows and followed the recipe the same. My family will devour these! Thanks so much!

This is a pretty tasty treat. I did as another reviewer and used an icecream scoop then drizzled with chocolate.  My family liked these a lot. I will probably be making these again in the future.  It still did not top my all time favorite graham cereal treat though, Indoor Smores which you can probably find on this site somewhere as well.

Very impressed that all the healthy ingredients produced such a yummy treat!  My daughter has enough food allergies that most recipes have at least one ingredient she cannot have (or has too much sugar for what I deem appropriate for a 2 yr old to have), but honey and peanut butter - I can see this recipe being in our family for a very long time (not to mention my husband LOVES peanut butter).  The only thing I omitted was the chocolate chips.  Thank you for this tasty, healthy recipe.

Yum Yum Yum. I have made these several times and they are very tasty. I forgot the honey once and they were still good. This is my new favorite no bake dessert. Thanks!

Honestly, I wasn't sure what honey graham cereal was, so I asked one of the clerks who was stocking the shelf in the cereal section at the store.  He said the only thing with that name was Quaker Honey Graham Oh's, so I hope I used the right cereal.  They really are yummy/sweet, but they also are equally sticky/messy.  Guess you have to take the bad with the good.

I used Cheerios but the flavor was still good. Also used mainly almond butter to use up a container that was almost empty.

Lots of substitutions, but I think that's the beauty of this recipe. I used the basic marshmallow base as described, but wanted to use up some dry items in my pantry. In place of the 12-oz box of cereal, I used about 2 cups graham crackers (chopped bite size), 3 cups oat O cereal, 3 cups wheat square cereal. It hasn't fully cooled yet, but I just tried some and its delist!

I made these exactly as written, using Golden Grahams for the cereal.  The flavor was good, but the majority of the marshmallow/peanut butter mixture sunk to the bottom of the pan, making the bottom of the bars extremely sticky.  A nice alternative, but a tad messier than the standard rice crispy treats.

AMAZING!  So easy but decadent!  I added chocolate chips & more mini marshmallows as I stirred the PB mixture in the cereal, then topped with additional mini mallows for decoration.  The kids got a kick out of the marshmallows & everyone loved it!  Will definitely make this again!
