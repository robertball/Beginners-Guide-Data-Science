The best peach cobbler I've ever had! I used almond milk instead of soy the second time I made it, and noticed no difference in flavor :).

This is absolutely delicious! My family ate almost half of it in one evening. Definitely serve it warm. 

(also, canned peaches work great!)

I had to use canned peaches with a few spoonfuls of the liquid as they werenâ€™t in season, but other than the peaches not being fresh, this cobbler was exactly like the old-school gluten version. Yum! My gf friend ate some and she loved it too!

I made this for a birthday treat and was disappointed. The peach filling was wonderful,  however, the topping was spongey and chewy. It tasted okay, but the texture was not pleasant to me.  Any thoughts why this is so?  I did use almond milk rather than  soy or regular milk.
