Perfect, I hate paying a lot for a small thing of seasoning blend.  I always have all these ingredients at home, just needed the formula to put it all together.  Thanks

I love this.  It is so convenient to make a seasoning from spices I already have on hand.  I love roast chicken and this is perfect.  The smells fill the house, tantalizing, before tasting the chicken.

This blend reminds me very much of Lawry's seasoning salt without the salt. So far, I've used it to spice up home baked french fries which were really good with it. Thanks for the recipe.
