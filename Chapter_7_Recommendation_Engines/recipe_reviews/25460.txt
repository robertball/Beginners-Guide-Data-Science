This is a good sauce, a tasty marinade, but not hot what so ever.  The chicken came out very tender.  I will spice it up next time, thanks Nancerini!

I used this for a "pulled chicken" type of a dish. It was great with lettuce, tomato, and avocado. I will make this one again.

Very average.  Perhaps I needed to marinate it longer than I did (90 minutes), but it just didn't add much to the meat.

This is a great BBQ sauce base.  I say base only because we always add our own touches to things like this.  I actually double the amount of BBQ sauce and use it with already grilled or leftover pork and cook it all down together on the stove.  The sauce gets nice and thick and the flavor is great!!

If you don't think it is hot, use a habanero pepper sauce or Dave's Insanity Sauce for the pepper heads.  Very Good. Will make it again!

Not spicy at all but super great bbq recipe. The thing I don't like about most bbq is that the meat is drowning in sauce.  This recipe gives a nice bbq flavor without the mess and you can still taste the meat.  Superb!

I added rooster sauce since I didnt have hot pepper and the sauce had plenty of kick. I made 36 servings and ended up with enough for my chicken and a full quart jar. I used some on my husbands chicken sandwich today and its better the longer it sits. Its not sweet at all so if you want it sweet add some brown sugar. A great sauce.
