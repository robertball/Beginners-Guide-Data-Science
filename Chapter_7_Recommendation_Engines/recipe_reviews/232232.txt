I was a bit skeptical to try this but drawn and curious at the same time. I followed the recipe except I used crunchy peanut butter and instead of cooking bacon I used real bacon bits. It was delicious!!!! Great bacon flavor, not too much or too little, same for peanut butter. I also rolled the balls if dough in more sugar than just a spoonful. It was a bit like a sugar cookie on the outside. Made this about 3 times. My family was also a bit iffy. Needless to say, cookies were gone in minutes lol

Flourless peanut butter cookies are some of my favorite things, and these are a great if decadent addition to my recipe box. The only thing I did differently was that I used regular bacon instead of maple, and I'd add that it should be fairly well done and then patted dry of grease. That's how I treat my bacon for most recipes, but I found that it still softened up a little in the dough while baking though it had been crisp enough to crumble (rather than chop) going in. 

With all that said, I found that this recipe was a great balance of sweet and savory, even smoky depending on the type of bacon used. The texture is melt in your mouth, and I'm dying to see how they go over at Sunday football and Monday meetings.

I was skeptical about these because of them having no butter and no flour.  I used crunchy peanut butter because that is all I have in the house.  I doubt that makes a difference.  I really didn't expect them to come together, but they did.  They look like regular cookies.  My first impression is that they taste like sweet bacon flavored peanut butter.  I'll see what others think.  Right now, I doubt I'd make them again.  Quick and easy though! **Update** I have now made these a second time.  I had some bacon leftover from breakfast and since these are so quick and easy and I was in a cookie baking mood, I decided to give them a second try.  I still think it is a weird combination but DH seems to really like them as do his coworkers.

I am going to have to concur with the two preceding reviews. I did not find the flavor itself off-putting; it was mostly the grease factor that ruined it for me. The cookies themselves were so greasy that they formed one massive cookie when baked and the flavor of grease left on the palette after eating was not appetizing. It was more of a grease node than actual bacon for me. But perhaps this could be remedied with turkey bacon instead although I will probably not make these again.

I did not have a problem with the grease, but I did make sure to soak up grease off the bacon with paper towels before I added it to the mixture. I also added 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tsp baking powder to try to make them cakey. They were a big hit with my friends.

To anyone who thought their cookies were greasy - the last step in frying up bacon is - drain it and pat between paper towels or newspaper until the grease is gone. Can't make the cookies greasy if you get rid of the grease first.

I was not able to add my change to the recipe on here. 		To deal with the grease and get delicious, crispy on the outside soft on the inside cookies, fry up your bacon bits in a cast iron or other pan, once crunchy and dark, scoop them onto a plate with a paper towel on top to soak the majority of the grease up. I waited about 7 minutes or so to use the bits. Once folding them into the batter I got another few paper towels and squeezed more of the grease into it and used the remaining grease in the batter and rolled the cookies and rolled the cookies in the sugar. 		I cooked mine an extra 2 minutes in the oven after turning the oven off. The result was delicious. My cookies turned out the way I love

I made these for a potluck at my husband's work.  They guys liked them.  I added some peanut butter chips.  I wasn't impressed with the bacon but the cookie part was good.  Will make them again but with peanut butter chips instead of bacon.

I made a batch of these cookies for Superbowl.  They were fantastic.  I did cook my bacon till crispy and blotted it really well with paper towels.  My son said they were better than "better than sex" cake!  I will definitely be making them again.  They were nice and sweet and chewy, and the bacon flavor was really subtle.

These came out wonderful. I didn't have an issue with grease. I made the bacon in the microwave and the paper towels absorbed so much of the grease, it turned out great. I also added some chocolate chips ( per the hubby's request). Needless to say they were wonderful, had to hide them or he would have eaten them all in one night.  Great recipe and very easy and quick.

I was looking for a peanut butter and bacon type recipe. The flavor is good but they are chewy and flat. I love my sweets but this was just too much of a good thing!
