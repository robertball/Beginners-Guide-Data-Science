This was a nice basic vegetarian sour cream that comes together in a jiffy. The lemon taste is fairly pronounced which was perfect for topping the zucchini "crab" cakes I was making. For Mexican dishes I think I'll sub lime juice for the lemon.

I found this recipe really vinegary and too sweet. I couldn't eat it. My kids liked it though

I liked this. I used lime instead of lemon and added some Sriracha to add it to my tacos. We also used it on salad. As a straight substitute for dairy sour cream I suggest reducing the amount of acidic ingredients as it is quite tangy. In the future I will use three tsp citrus and one tsp vinegar then go by taste from there. I will definitely make this again. Thank you for the recipe.

This is a good vegan sour cream recipe. Don't expect it to taste exactly like dairy sour cream and you won't be disappointed. To better suit my personal preferences I reduce the amount of lemon juice by half omit the oil and use the tiniest pinch of Stevia instead of sugar.

This is a good, and useful recipe.  Of course it's not a dead on duplicate for dairy sour cream; but, it does well as substitute.  It is excellent where sour cream is part of the dish.  I have not tried it in a situation where sour cream, or its stand in, is meant to play a central flavor role.
Full disclosure wise, I am omnivorous myself; but, I have friends who are vegan.  Not to mention friends, who have friends who are vegan.  I try to accommodate people's dietary needs, and desires.  Though, please don't wait until the last minute to tell me.  I give this recipe very good marks.
