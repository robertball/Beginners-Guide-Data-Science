Just based on how my kids inhaled these AND loved them, I give it a five. I didn't have sliced pineapple, just crushed pineapple. I used a 1/2 cup of crushed pineapple that I drained the crud out of and mixed it with the cream cheese. I did end up adding just a little more cream cheese, but not much. My kids fell in love with this, as did I because it used what I had on hand.

This is AWESOME!  I did change it a bit personal taste, but I'm rating it anyway because it would work w/any personal preference cheese/bread combinations. I'm not a fan of cream cheese, so I used provolone for me (and American for Mr. LTH).  I used 12 grain bread for mine (and pumpernickel for Mr. LTH).  Outstanding!  I've been on a ham, pineapple and onion pizza kick, so this was a much more figure friendly way to feed that craving (and I'll add some onion next time, too!).  THANKS for a great recipe!

Very good, thanks for this! To make things even easier you can use the pineapple flavored cream cheese.

Good. Kinda rich. Don't know how often I would have them because of that.  Instead of pineapple rings, I mixed 1/4 drained crushed pineapple witht he cream cheese and spread that on the bread.

Did not like the cream cheese in this. It made the moist pineapple even more moist, making for a soppy sandwich, even though it was toasted. Would try a differnet cheese.

Don't be fooled by how simple this sandwich is, it's fantastic!  I used whipped cream cheese to keep from tearing up the bread but other than that I made them exactly as written.  Served with the Topical Salad from this site which also has pineapple in it and it made for a wonderfully flavorful and light sandwich and salad dinner.  Thanks!

Gave me a great idea for some leftover ham but knew we would not like the cream cheese with pineapple.   Anyway, for us extra old cheddar is our choice - more zing and less moist sandwich.   Thanks for a great creation

I will definitely make it again.  I did modify it by making it more french toast style.  Just whisk up an egg w/ a little milk and dip the bread in... not too soaked though!  Very yummy this way!

I don't know how you came up with this combo, but I am so glad you did!  I used sourdough bread, but did everything else the same.  This was melt in my mouth delicious!  I will be eating A LOT of these!

This is my new favorite thing to eat when I need a quick meal.  I've been using cold meat ham because I don't have leftover ham.  I don't measure the cream cheese, just cover 1 side of 1 piece of bread.  I also use whipped cream cheese after reading some other reviews here.  I've already had this 3 times in 4 days!

Boy oh boy, this was good!  I used "Texas Toast" style bread (white bread, very thick slices)and to be honest, I didn't measure the cream cheese ... just smeared it on each side of the bread.  The I added ham and pineapple, buttered the bread and grilled it like grilled cheese. OMG! SO SO good.  A GREAT way to use up ham.  Very filling, too!

Not bad, but not quite as good as I had expected. I think the cream cheese was what put me off. It was really rich and creamy and was good with the pineapple but somehow it just didn't work with the toasted bread and the ham too for me :(

Great sandwich, interesting taste, but in a good way!  Used wheat bread, as I don't keep white bread in the house.

I love ham and I love pineapple but I felt that some flavor or spice was missing in this recipe. Bland in some way, I wish I could put my finger on what would make this better.A lot of people at the party asked for this recipe, though, so it was well received.

These are SO good! Next time I might use pineapple tidbits to make it easier to eat. I will be making these every time I have leftover ham.

My family really liked this! I dried the pineapple rings on paper towels before placing on the sandwich to avoid sogginess. It was great when you got a bite of all of the ingredients.

After reading the reviews, I made several changes to adapt the sandwiches to our own tastes.  I used soft cream cheese with chives and smeared it on dark Rye bread, then I put on a layer of crushed pineapple which is all I had on hand, sprinkled just a little Worcestershire sauce on that.  Next the ham, sprinkled a little sharp cheddar cheese and spread a thin layer of Dijon mustard on the other piece of bread.  Grilled until toasted and cheese was melted.  Not bad and I think the mustard and Worcestershire sauce gave it a nice depth in flavor.  Not the best sandwich I've ever had but it's a nice change when you have lots of ham leftover.

We used leftover grilled (fresh!) pineapple, cream cheese and ham on cinnamon-raisin bread.  Did not grill or toast, and hubby loved it!

I was served this sandwich at a tea room a few times and they used lightly toasted raisin bread.  Verry yummy!  I sometimes substitute pineapple marmalade for the pineapple pieces.

I will probably try it again.  They were tasty, but I might try BBQ sauce to give it a little further boost.

I thought this would be good since we like Hawaiian pizza and the ham and pineapple sandwiches would be very similar.  Neither of us cared for it. I wished I'd just made ham and cheese sandwiches instead. I won't be making it again.

I made these with rye bread and toasted them in my panini press.    They were really good and weren't sloppy at all.  Great way to use leftover ham.

Yum!  I added a slice of Provolone to make sure it was melted-cheesy enough, and didn't really measure the cream cheese... just covered one side of the bread.  I was concerned about it being soggy as one reviewer had said, but didn't really have that problem.  Granted, I happened to have part of a fresh pineapple so I was able to slice a piece that was probably thinner than a canned slice, so maybe that resolved the issue.  I ate this 5/7 days this week to use up my ham and pineapple.

Not a fan.  Although we like the individual ingredients, together the sandwich was not a hit in our house.

My husband and I love Hawaiian pizza and so I thought this would be the perfect sandwich to make when we need something quick and easy.  Nope.  Not going to make this one again.  I used shredded pineapple and drained it, but even after that the bread was still soggy.  We did not like the taste of the cream cheese, and we both LOVE cream cheese.  I tried this with swiss cheese as well, and although it was better, I still will not make this one again.

This was a delicious morning after Christmas brunch. I think everyone in the family would love them. The only change I made was adding some onions to the sandwich to give it a little bit more contrast in flavor from the sweetness. And beware, it is messy to eat as there is nothing in it to make the bread stick together so be prepared to eat it with a fork and knife.
