Loved this recipe! My husband said just like his Omaâ€™s. He  preferred no diced tomatoes, I loved the tomato (I made two batches one with and one without)

Recipe was delicious except for the amount of nutmeg. One whole tablespoon of nutmeg is way too much. Next time I would use 1 teaspoon at most.
