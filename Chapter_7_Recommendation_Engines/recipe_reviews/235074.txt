This makes a fluffy and moist cake with a yummy pumpkin flavor.  I made cupcakes instead of a 13x9 and used cinnamon chips because I realized too late that I had run out of chocolate chips.  I made an icing for these as well, which I liked, but I personally preferred them more without any icing or frosting. If you are looking for a fast and easy pumpkin cake, this recipe is a good choice.

This is fine. I might make it again when I'm feeling lazy but want something sweet.
