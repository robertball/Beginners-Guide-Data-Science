It was pretty dry. If one were to reduce; half cup marsala wine mixed with a cup of chicken broth, a pinch of corn starch, a pinch of chicken boullion and add a cup of heavy cream then drizzle over the bell peppers it would give it more depth as well as take its flavor profile to a greater height!

Not a fan of stuffed peppers, I was looking for something different than the usual beef/rice/tomato sauce version when I found this.  A-MAZING!!!!  My husband, who is not particularly a fan of veggies, has claimed this to be in his top ten list of dinner selections now.  The only thing I would change is the amount of green onions; I increased from two to four and one to two, along with the mushrooms...2 is not nearly enough!  But that could be because I love them.  All in all...I was SOOO happy with these!  I can't wait to make them again!

These were delish! My kids and husband loved them. I gave 4 stars because I added red pepper flakes to the recipe to make it a little spicy.

This was very good. I took the advice of a couple of other reviewers.
First advice I took was to cook the pepper a bit first if you like a softer pepper. Second, I made the marsala sauce by review hunter blake. I actually sauteed the mushrooms and green onions per the recipe and added the marsala, chicken broth, milk and cornstarch to that. You will need more than a "pinch" of cornstarch if you like your sauce a bit thicker as a pinch leaves it very watery. I will make these again. It's a great option for using up your leftover chicken. Also, I had a lot of chicken/orzo mix left because I didn't have enough peppers so my son made a wrap out of it.

We really liked this. I gave it 4 stars because the peppers were undercooked. I would advise boiling the peppers for 5 minutes instead of baking them for 10.

Made this last night. It was excellent. I did read comments before making, so I followed the one reviewer's suggestion for a marsala cream sauce. We felt this really gave it the extra taste that would have been missing otherwise.
    To recap , in last step I quickly sauteed the onions and mushrooms and then added 1 c. Chicken broth, 1\2 c marsala, almost 1 cup heavy cream, and added cornstarch to somewhat thicken. I had initially hoped it would thicken more but the more fluid texture was just fine over the peppers.
I also used leftover cut up grilled chicken thighs instead of raw breasts.  Because they were already cooked I added them just before the orzo finished cooking in order to heat the meat but not cook it too much more.  I used 4 medium peppers and used up all the filling.  Great recipe for leftover chicken and much easier to cook than other stuffed peppers recipes that I've made.

There were really good! This was my first time making stuffed peppers because they always seemed so complicated. I was really pleased with the results. My filling seemed to be lacking something, though. I took the advice of other posters and boiled the peppers first.

Thank you for the delicious recipe! I added more cumin by accident because the spice came out faster than I thought, but it still tasted great. I think next time I will either cut the chicken into smaller pieces or shred it so it fits in the peppers a bit easier. Also I think this recipe would work great with baby Bella mushrooms. This recipe is so versatile and delicious, I can't wait to make it again.

This is a five star, but I made a few changes so will rate a four.  Three changes I made: 4 bell peppers, 3 chicken breasts and button mushrooms.  Mixed all of the stuffing ingredients together and baked for approximately 30 minutes.  Both hubby and I loved this recipe and it will be part of my rotation!  Nice for leftovers and lunches too.

Great recipe!  Everyone I have served this to, loves it.  Leftovers are even better. I followed the directions the first time. Since then, to save a little time, I cut up the peppers and sauté them with the onion and mushrooms. I put the chicken- orzo mixture in a casserole dish topped with the cheese. (or if you have a skillet that you can put in the oven).  After the cheese is melted I spoon the mushroom pepper mixture on top. It’s not a stuffed pepper but it tastes the same if not better. Plus it shaved off the time it takes to heat the oven and roast the peppers.

This was a great recipe! I used a cooked rotisserie chicken for ease, sautéed chicken,onion and garlic in chili oil for some spice and added a can of corn and some crushed red peppers to stuffing mixture. Fantastic!!

Made this a few months back, we loved it. Finance is begging for it for dinner tonight - round 2! Thinking of cooking mushrooms in with orzo and chicken instead of adding on top.

These were good as I made the stuffing again the night after which I preferred over the stuff bell peppers. 

1: I did follow the recommendation by using more chicken broth for flavor - I did edit the recipe for serving size for 1/2 c of orzo used 1 c of chicken broth. 
2. Used cayenne pepper rather than cumin (made it spicy)
3. Cooked the chicken with more seasoning to add flavor as I read the other reviews that lacked some flavor. 
4. Added the caps of the bell pepper by dicing into the chicken/orzo stuffing and half of fresh jalapeno
5. Rather than use the steps for  the mushrooms from the original recipe I followed Superb Sautéed Mushrooms which can be found on allrecipes.com, I used white wine, soy sauce and balsamic vinegar since that is what I had on hand. 
6. The 2nd attempt I made the filling instead used the same steps of what I did the prior night but this time - I added the mushroom mixture to the stuffing and I LOVED IT. I liked it way better.

This is a pretty good recipe.  I made a couple of changes, firstly, I didn't cut the peppers in half, I cut the tops off, cleaned out the seeds and stuffed them.  Then set them upright in a bread pan and baked them 20 minutes more.  I also didn't have any orzo so I used rice, and added pepper flakes.

Very good will definitely make again. More seasoning could be used, I thought the flavor of the chicken  was a little bland.

OMG it turned out amazing. I did deviate from the recipe and used ground beef and beef broth instead. My boyfriend hissed at having chicken again. Could the chicken be better than this?  I’ll find out next time.

My wife makes this a lot. It’s very good. She adds a Marsala gravy to pour over everything, and it really wakes up the flavor! We tried the original recipe first. I think it’s important to try the original first. Respect thing.

It was a little bland, but I forgot the garlic lol.  We also left out the mushrooms because we don't like them. Also I wouldn't cut the peppers in half, I would just cut the tops off. My pepper halves didn't hold too much the way I cut them. It was a super easy recipe and I may make it again.

The orzo and chicken mixture was a little soupy. I would probably use less chicken broth.  I would omit the peppers and eat the orzo/chicken mixture with the mushrooms. It had a very good flavor.

I made several changes to this recipe. I didn't want to use chicken. I used tofu. I was out of cumin so I used greek seasoning. Actually, what I made is nothing like the recipe! I forgot the sun dried tomatoes. I used Athen Feta Cheese and it would have been WAY better with a better feta. I was kind of bland. I will make it again according to the directions and use a GOOD feta.

Very good! With outside temp at 110 degrees, I didn’t want to use a hot oven so I tried the slow cooker, using a cooking bag liner.  Instead of cooking the chicken I chopped up some store  bought roasted chicken and poured a bit of chicken broth on the bottom of the pot and cooked on high about 2 hrs. Worked out well and the family really enjoyed it. I forgot mushrooms so just omitted them altogether. Only 5 pepper halves fit in the large pot so cooked the remaining three halves after removing the first batch. In winter I will definitely prepare these in the oven as per original recipe.

Very tasty. When I make again, I’ll probably add cheese to the sauce as well as topping the stuffed peppers, because I love me some cheese.

Delicious. A really nice twist on how I usually make stuffed peppers. Will definitely make this recipe again.

Excellent recipe!!  Only thing I did differently was bake the peppers for 20 minutes instead of 10 minutes based upon what others suggested.  Added a little more cumin and red pepper flakes.  Great taste and not heavy dish at all.  Will definitely make again and again...thank you for the recipe!!

I love this in part because it reminds me of the chicken and rice my mother would make when I was a child.  The first time, I made the recipe as written and it was good.  The second time, I used more chicken and less orzo to lower carbs. I also doubled the mushroom and onion mixture simply because I love mushrooms and onions.  I also mixed everything together, including a bit of parmesan  in one bowl and then filled the peppers with it all at once.  I topped it off with more parmesan and also a bit of mozzarella.  I baked until melted and browned to my liking.  YUM!  It was even better the next day.  Oh, I also did not do the prep to the bell pepper in the beginning.  I like my peppers crunchier so I fill them after removing the seeds and washing.

I came across this recipe about four years ago and it is still my favorite. I made a couple of changes for my tastes:

-when everything is cooked, just before filling the peppers, I mix 1-1.5 cups of shredded cheese into the mixture so the whole thing is cheesy, then top the filled peppers as well.
-I'm not a mushroom fan so I just leave those out.

I've made this for friends and it never surprises my husband to come home and find this is what's for dinner. It's fantastic.

My family enjoyed this meal.  It was very filling, no need for sides.  I added an extra fourth cup of broth because the orzo was not cooking well.  Also, you should continue to stir the mixture after you add the orzo because it will stick to the pan. We didn't really taste the small amount of Parmesan so if you are not a fan, you will not miss it. Other than that, the added mushrooms on top is really good.

Add a stalk of finely chopped celery to first step. Used 2 leftover chicken breasts and a cup of cooked rice instead of orzo and heated it with a 3/4 cup of chicken broth. Quick & delicious.

Made it just as the recipe read. Next time I will add a little bit of zip. A nice change from beef/rice/tomato styled peppers  - and at this time of year I have peppers from my garden! I prepared them, wrapped them in aluminum foil and tossed them into the freezer.

Very good! We had ground beef on hand, so I used that and I made a few other changes. I followed Blake's advice and reduced his delicious sauce. Also, since we are on Atkins, I replaced the orzo with finely diced cauliflower. I sautéed four cloves of garlic with four green onions, and half a container of mushrooms, the spices listed, PLUS a tsp. of crushed red pepper. Then I added the browned ground beef and the Marsala cream sauce, covered and simmered for 10-12 minutes. Last, I stuffed the peppers, added cheddar cheese and popped them back in the microwave to melt. Even my picky son loved them (although his were just seasoned ground beef and cheddar cheese inside a pepper.) Very, very tasty!

I thought this was just OK, but my husband really liked it.  I'll probably make it again to give it another shot.  We ended up with much more filling that could fill the peppers though, so maybe I'd add another pepper to the mix.

Excellent!  Don't skimp on the last step with the mushrooms & green onions - this really elevates the dish.  I only substituted 2 items:  I used 1 lb ground chicken and I used fregola sarda instead of orzo because that's what I had on hand.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  It was also just as good as left-overs the next 2 nights.

As a lazy cook (supremely. sometimes mac n' cheese box style is too much), this meal was a bit too much work for me, but BOY did it taste nice! Huge A+ from the family, and they are very picky! My 16 month old even ate it! It's a great Sunday dinner for our house, but I wouldn't recommend it for a quick weeknight meal.

I used ground meat and added a Serrano pepper (seeded and finely diced) to the orzo mix. I charred the peppers on the gas burner and put into a ziplock bag as I prepared the filling.  I also used whole wheat orzo. I added the broth, Marsala, milk (didn't have heavy cream) and corn starch (kept adding until thick enough) to the mushrooms and green onions as a previous reviewer suggested. It was delicious! I watch the sodium when I cook. I used no salt added chicken stock, unsalted butter and omitted salt when called for, and was very generous with the fresh ground black pepper. My husband never reached for the salt shaker! Oh, I did add a packet of sodium free chicken bouillon to the mushroom sauce. Will definitely make again!

I made this as described, and added a tablespoon of shredded mozzarrella on top of the peppers along with the parmesean cheese. It was very good, but I couldn't help but think that there's no reason for this to be a stuffed pepper dish. The filling is delicious and putting it inside a pepper didn't really add anything to it. The pepper doesn't do any significant baking with the stuffing inside, so the flavors didn't seem to affect it meaningfully. Next time I will retrofit the delicious filling into a regular orzo dish with additional vegetables, and omit the stuffed pepper element altogether.

Yummy, quick and my husband loved it! I made a few revisions for what we had in our house...we didn't have mushrooms or regular bell peppers, but did have mini peppers, which I cut in half and laid as a base instead. 
It was the perfect amount for my husband and I to both have seconds, and our 1 year old got a little too :) thanks for this recipe!

As I was making this, I thought sure that it was going to need a sauce, but it was actually pretty good as written. I needed to roast my peppers for about twice as long before they were soft enough for my liking, but other than that, no changes made, and none needed.

Good overall recipe but did make a few changes, rubbed the outside of the bell peppers with olive oil and sprinkled with salt and pepper while they baked marinated the chicken with soy sauce, balsamic vinegar and pepper. Then followed recipe as written. I did add more fresh parmesian to dish, more green onion and had to use a Tablespoon or two of cornstarch to thicken. Maybe less chicken broth next time. Very delicious my Husband and 3 year old loved it.

Used whole peppers instead of cutting in half and made 6 so doubled the ingredients except for the broth and ground pepper. Left the peppers in 20 minutes to soften, and added grated cheddar cheese and a whole can of canned mushrooms instead (all I had on hand). The boyfriend really enjoyed them, had 2 each and we were stuffed (pun intended) and had 2 left for lunch tomorrow. Was pretty easy and enjoyable, will make again for sure.

Delicious. Huge fan of this recipe. The peppers were filled to the brim, nearly spilling over, but I managed to use up the total quantity.  I also added the sauce over top after serving.  I made the marsala sauce by review hunter blake. I sauteed the mushrooms with green onions per the recipe and added the marsala, chicken broth, milk and cornstarch to that.

We had some bell peppers we needed to use up, so I tried this recipe. It's a definite keeper! We used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, instead of breasts. I will pre-cook the peppers a little longer next time. They were not tender enough, after only 10 minutes.

I was going to make this recipie  as written, but ended up making some additions and changes, not having the right ingredients,  I had leftover oven roasted turkey and no Orzo so replaced with Rice-A-Roni Rice Pilaf.   I added approximately 1-2 tablespoons each, parmesan cheese, Asigio and Romano cheese to the meat mixture. Baked about 10 minutes and then sprinkled mozzarella cheese and cheddar cheese to the top baked another 10 minutes, added the mushrooms and topped with a little more Parmesan cheese baked a few minutes more while I set the table.  
My husband loved it.  
Next time I make it I will make it all in the microwave  and add Panko crumbs to the top for a little more texture. I think I will save recipe this for leftover Thanksgiving turkey.

This is super delicious! My 6 year old even loved it!  I only used half the pepper and I made the marsala cream sauce recommended by other reviews.

Very good although I had to cook the peppers for 30 minutes and the orzo also 30 minutes.  Maybe because I am at a high altitude (8,000).

I followed the original recipe and it came out really good. It has very delicate flavors, the combination of which makes it really special. My husband and son enjoyed it, and I intend to keep it as one of my favorite recipes.

I loved this.  It was easy and very tasty.  I read in another review that the peppers were undercooked and they were right.  After baking in the oven they  were still a little crisp.  Perhaps boiling  a few minutes before would help.  But they were still extremely tasty.

It was definitely not a bad dish. I do like the way the garlic and green onion flavored together. I like garlic ; it just seemed like the  two together was a bit overpowering. I felt the need to add more seasonings to this dish as well. After reading the reviews, I decided to try the Marsala route especially because I am not a real fan of mushrooms. That was definitely tasty.  This meal is definitely feeling. It even inspired a one year old to eat all of the filling out of a pepper. The pepper itself was too much for her. At least now we know she eats mushrooms. I must have missed where it said I need fresh Parmesan cheese so I ended having to use granulated. I used a little cheddar cheese.

This was really good my wife and I really enjoyed it. Next time I will use a little more cumin as suggested by one reviewer and salt and black pepper the peppers before baking. Also, we like the peppers  a little crispy, but for those who prefer softer peppers, you could bake for 5 or 10 minutes more.

This was great. The chicken orzo mixture is SO ZESTY AND DELICIOUS.  USED GREEN PEPPERS AND ADDED ANOTHER HALF TSP CUMIN.  EVEN THE LITTLE KIDS LIKED THIS ONE.

Boiled the peppers first, instead of baked. Good recipe! The mushrooms and green onions are a great touch.

This is one of our favorites, the flavor of the filling is great when you pull it out of the oven and just as good the next day.  I use ground chicken or finely chopped chicken breast.
