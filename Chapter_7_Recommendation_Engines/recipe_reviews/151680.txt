I will not make this again.  Not that it wasn't good, but the sauce was neither sweet nor tart--good, just not very impressive or distinctive.  My husband and I tend to like more bold flavor, which is what I expected from this.  However, if you're looking for a relatively quick and different, very safe meal (for picky eaters), I imagine this would be more creative and yet still acceptable to many people's tastes!

I thought this recipe was fantastic & just submitted a photo for review =) I used Clementine oranges & my 3 & 5 year old loved them. Definitely a good way to make pork fun for little kids. I made a 1.83 lb pork roast, so I added about 20 minutes to the time in the recipe and it came out perfect. The molasses/onions/broth/brown sugar/oranges au jus was delicious.

I had to modify this recipe because I had variations of the ingredients. I used thinly sliced pork chops, seasoned with a citrus seasoning mix from the grocery store. I used juice from some mandarins I had on hand, and used agave nectar instead of molasses. While the shallots were cooking I added a pinch or two of red peppers to kick it up a notch. Otherwise followed it to a T. Very delicious recipe! As a side I made soba noodles and after draining, added argula leaves and some of the citrus sauce. Thank you for this recipe!

I liked that this recipe was fairly easy, though the chicken took much longer than the recipe indicated (15-20 min longer) and I used pounded chicken so I would have thought it would have cooked faster.  The molasses was too strong for my family and none of us liked the oranges (too warm and too much molasses flavor).  We did like the pork without much au jus and none of the orange segments.

I liked it and thought it turned out pretty good. However, I don't have picky kids but they would not eat this. My 2 year old said, "nummies yucky" and spit it out. Recipe is good for adults but not so much with the kids.
