This recipe was pretty decent.  The aroma it gives off is amazing!  It was unbelievably simple to make.  Although I was originally looking for a potluck dessert & this wouldn't be good in that situation.  It would be a great side dish @ dinner or a nice after dinner dessert.

I had some wrapped caramels for making caramel apples so I melted those in a sauce pot with some almond milk (did not have regular milk in the house). Also added some chopped walnuts I had on hand. Delicious!

Quick, easy and tasty. I used about a teaspoon of cinnamon. Used 2 Granny Smith and 1 red delicious, because thats all I had. Baking the apples is a nice twist to plain caramel apples.

I thought this recipe was too sweet.  It could have been my fault however, because I used light caramel and granny smith apples. I thought the tartness of the sour apple would help, but the combination tasted processed. I probably will never make this again even though the bad result could have been my fault.

I made this because of the short ingredient list and easy recipe. My 4 year old child asked if we could have it every night. I think the adults would want a little more kick but it is definately a kid-friendly recipe.
