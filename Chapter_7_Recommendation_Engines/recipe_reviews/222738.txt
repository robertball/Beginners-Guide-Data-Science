I picked this recipe for gumbo because it was "rouxless".  We're trying to go as low carb as possible and it appealed to me that I didn't need to add flour.  I used chicken breasts because I didn't have a whole chicken on hand, but prepared and shredded them as directed in the recipe.  Since we skipped the rice (to serve over) I let it simmer/reduce for a little longer than directed to thicken.  It got four out of four thumbs up, picky eaters included.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Just a post-script (2 years later):  This is still a 5-star, often used recipe in my house.  I have since adapted this recipe for the crockpot by tossing in everything but the okra and file powder (and shrimp, if using) at once.  I usually use frozen chicken breasts if preparing this way.  Cook on high 6ish hours or low 10ish hours (you'll know it's about done when it starts to smell soooooo good), then shred the chicken and return to crockpot.  Add okra during the last 30 - 60 mins, and shrimp at the end, maybe 15ish mins... keep your eye on the shrimp.  Add file before serving.  I've also swapped out the andouille sausage in a pinch for whatever I had on hand and it's great every time.  We really LOVE this recipe, thanks again for sharing it!

This was delicious but I made a few changes from what I learned through my mother. First, I used chicken thighs instead of the whole chi ken, then I seasoned the chicken and coated it with flower and browned it in the pot I was going to make my gumbo in before adding water. This adds a little more flavor and color to the gumbo. But besides those few changes it was great. I'd make this again in a heartbeat!!

I made this for the New Orleans Super Bowl.  I thought it was good, although family members missed the the thickening the roux provides along with that nutty flavor.  I'm giving it 4 stars for including file powder an absolute must for the dish and I've seen so many recipes without it.  This is a good soup,

Thank you!! No more gumbo mixed in a box for me. I skipped the chicken and used only chicken broth. The only thing I added for more flavor is crawfish boil seasoning (I bought the Louisiana Crawfish and Crab Boil). OMG makes a big difference! Then added some cornstarch to thicken the soup. Few dash of Louisiana hot sauce...my mouth was in heaven!!!

Hunter, thank you so much for this easy delicious recipe. My husband made this gumbo and it was superb!  He is a decent ‘follow the directions’ sort of cook and he did with this recipe, even making a quick trip to the grocery store to pick up a couple of things.  He followed the recipe and the outcome is well worth bragging about. It made a big potful and unless our grandson (the bottomless stomach)shows up in the next day or so, I am going to freeze some of it for another delicious meal.
I could rave on a bit more, but I hope it is enough to say thank you again and please submit some more lovely meals like this one for us to enjoy.

Love this recipe!  Tried to lower fat further by using chicken breast and chicken-apple sausages, which are somewhat healthier than andouille. Next time I'll omit the butter (tho I love butter)& use cooking spray.  Also used brown rice.  Makes a big pot of gumbo.  Very satisfying and tasty.

Thank you for posting this recipe!  I love gumbo, but because I have a gluten allergy, I thought good gumbo was not in my future - I'm glad I was wrong!  I can't wait to make this again - thank you!!!  I really like how this recipe can be easily customized based on spice preferences. (Note: I don't have file powder, but I didn't miss it!)

I find the shrimp lost in the flavors and why corn?  I also find it best to let each diner add his/her preferred amount of file at the table as if you add the file while the gumbo's cooking you may lose the file flavor in the leftovers.  Our guests have differing tastes for file and many do not like adding file to gumbo with okra (generally the gumbo thickening agent) already in it.

Also in NOLA more than a few like their gumbo with a scoop of potato salad instead of rice or just plain with a healthy side of NOLA-style French bread.

Turned out great. You gotta use the right sausage to get the correct gumbo flavor.

I didn't have Bell Pepper, and I used chicken thighs rather than breast meat. I'm used to my mothers old Time recipe using a roux!! When I first finish this recipe I was a little disappointed, but fortunately didn't really need it till the next day. Overnight in the fridge, the flavors mingled, and everyone, including myself, gobbled it up without any hesitation. I'll make it again!

I've scrounged for good low-carb recipes, and this one was GREAT!  For the chicken, I microwave boiled a mongo 15oz breast with some garlic salt, and it shredded perfectly and tasty.  I used 2 cups of chicken broth plus another 1&1/2 cups of water.  I also followed reviewer Mrs Harte's addition of about a 1/2 tsp of thyme and 1/2 tsp of oregano.  I added 2 tsp of "Ragin'  Cajun" brand seasoning (mild version).  Along with the cayenne pepper in the original ingredients, the heat level was just right.

I prepared it just like the recipe. It was great. Some people commented there was too much oil but I didn't think so. Just keep stirring, it takes a while for the chocolate color to appear.

I halved this recipe: I boiled 5 chicken legs, and added 2 tsp of chicken broth seasoning to the pot. I boiled them for about an hour, then pulled all the skin & fat off. I wasn't sure exactly how much broth to reserve, so I saved 2 cups and ended up using 1 1/2 cups. I omitted the green pepper (it's a migraine trigger) and replaced it with more celery. Instead of using the cans of diced tomatoes & chilies, I used fresh - 2 small jalapenos and 2 tomatoes. I used about 1/2 tbsp of Cajun seasoning and added 1/2 tsp each of crushed thyme and oregano. I used a lot more shrimp because we love it! In the end though, the okra was still slimy, and it ruined the dish. If I make this again (or anything with okra), I will saute the okra first (by itself) until it is no longer slimy, or rub the sliced okra with vinegar.

Wow, great dish. Okra used to be the only veg I didn't like. Now I really like it.  I think the trick is to cook it long enough to loose the slimeness. My step son's favorite dish is Gumbo so I followed the recipe exactly,--almost(added a tsp of cumin, paprika, and a bay leave. He said it was great and asked me to please keep this recipe.  Thank you very much for sharing your delicious recipe.
