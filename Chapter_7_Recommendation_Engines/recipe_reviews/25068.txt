Add cardamom!  It will take your gingersnaps to a whole new level, I promise!  1/4 tsp per batch (or more if you're brave).  Cardamom is somewhat peppery, and is the perfect addition to any gingerbread/snap/cookie recipe.  I used margarine and butter because we like our cookies chewy.  Happy Baking!

This gingersnap recipe is a DELIGHT! I have been looking a long time for the perfect gingersnap, and this is the one!  I did make a few changes:
I added 2 tablespoons of flour, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, and 1 teaspoon of allspice.  Also, I always use real butter in my baking, instead of margarine.  I chilled the dough overnight, but I don't think it was necessary.  Don't skip the rolling of the cookie dough in sugar, it provides a nice coating that keeps the cookie looking beautiful.  Thank you, Ruth Ann!  Good job!

Excellent cookie! Comes out thin and crispy on the outside, chewy in the middle. Baked them for exactly 8 min and they came out perfect. Be sure to follow the directions and leave them on the cookie sheet for 5 min before transferring to a rack (or else they will fall apart!). And they spread out A LOT, so don't make them too big! Delicious!

this is a ginger cookie that even people who don't like gingersnaps love. I have had marriage proposals (co-workers), offers to clean my house and just down right begging for these. If that doesn't get 5 stars then nothing does

Lovely cookies, but just narrowly miss a 5 star because they're far more delicate than a true ginger snap. To those who are wondering what went wrong when the cookies come out as flat discs, the answer is absolutely nothing! Ginger snaps are supposed to be flat and very crisp. If you are looking for a puffy, soft ginger cookie recipe, I can heartily recommend "Big Soft Ginger Cookies" from this site. Even though I upped the baking time to 12 minutes, the edges were properly crispy, but the centers still remained chewy. The dough is extremely soft. I chilled it overnight, but it was still too soft to roll into balls by hand. So I scooped them out with two spoons, and rolled them around in the sugar. They spread out a lot while baking, so allow ample room on your baking sheet. Excellent, tasty cookies, just not crispy enough to be called gingersnaps. Edited to add: By evening, all had lost any crispiness and become chewy, which underscores the appropriateness of the 4 star rating. Again, delicious cookie, just not a true gingersnap, without any "snap." Edited to add: I discovered how to make them properly crisp. Use vegetable shortening in place of the margarine, bake for 12 minutes and you'll have actual "snaps." Also, in order to get that proper warmth that we associate with gingersnaps, add a few shakes of cayenne or white pepper. Perfect then!

Very yummy!  I followed the reciped exactly.  I baked them for 12 minutes and they turned out perfect.  The right amount of chewiness (for me anyway!)  The only thing was I found the yeild was closer to 2 dozen than 3 dozen.  They are so good, next time I'll double the recipe.....they won't last very long!

Very tasty cookie but nothing like what I expected. There was no way that dough was the right consistency to roll and so they were drop cookies. They spread out a LOT. I don't know why this happened as I followed the recipe exactly. I'm searching for an answer to that very predicament. They do taste good though.

I made these for our family Christmas Cookie Day this year, and found a new favorite! My only substitution was butter for the margarine, and they still came out beautifully--thin and crispy! This is a wonderful recipe that will be added to my list of regulars. Everyone loved them!

These were delicious. I added 1/4 tsp cardamom and extra cinnamon. Also I ran out of molasses, so it ended up being 1/8 molasses and 1/8 honey. I think it was better that way though. Eat them warm.

I followed this recipe almost exactly, except I used margarine and instead of sugar, half Splenda and half brown sugar Splenda.  These turned out great!  I rolled them a little bigger than 1 inch and baked them for 10 minutes.  Nice and soft, and just the right amount of ginger.  I also used Black Strap molasses... it really is better than any other kind.  Thank you for this recipe, I will definitely be adding this to my collection!

These gingersnaps rock!  If you're debating on which recipe to choose; this is the one.  I followed this recipe almost exactly except instead of rolling the dough in cinnamon sugar, I chose to use sanding sugar.  It gives the cookie a bit more texture and it looks really good too.

Mmm! These were delicious! Made them for a party and they were gone in an instant! I baked them in a toaster oven, so it took a little bit longer than 8 minutes, but they turned out great. I used butter, so they were on the chewier side, which is how I like them.

These are the best gingersnaps I ever tasted!  I made them today, with no changes except that I used Canola Oil instead of oleo.  Used my 1" melon baller to scoop, rolled them in white sugar and baked them 8 minutes at 375 degrees, a little above the center of the oven.  As directed, I let them sit in the pans for 5 minutes before removing them to racks to cool.  There were a few that were a little smaller, and they turned out crispy, but still fairly soft in the centers.  The larger ones were soft & chewy, with some crispiness around the edges.  No matter how they turned out, they were extremely good!  The dough was quite soft and I debated using a bit more flour, but since it was my first time making them I decided to go as specified this time.  It turned out to be very easy to handle, not sticky, came right out of the melon baller.  The cookies didn't hold the shape, but melted down to thin, round cookies...just what I wanted.  NOTE:  I just realized I set my oven at 375 instead of 350, but I think it runs a little lower than it shows, so probably was closer to 350.

These cookies are so tasty! They are not at all sticky and really fun to roll and drop in sugar. They also don't stick to the pan when they are coming off. I bake them for eight minutes flat to get a semi-soft cookie, but that is just our taste. I made no alterations to the recipe, and it was delicious!

This recipe matches my Great-Grandmothers' recipe exatcly!  8 minutes is the trick, pull the cookie sheet out when they don't look quite done...  and they'll be amazing!

Yummy!  I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening because that's what I had, and an extra 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon because we love cinnamon.  I also added an additional 1/2 cup of flour because the dough looked very sticky.  It ended up being very soft dough, but not at all sticky so was just fine to work with.  Also, because I was feeling especially lazy, I just dumped the dry ingredients into the mixing bowl without stirring them together first.  Thankfully, the cookies did not seem to suffer for it!  I got 20 cookies out of the recipe (we like big ones!) and they were perfect and soft after 10 minutes in the oven.  My cookies actually did not spread more than any other cookie dough- I suspect the extra flour and the shortening helped (cookies baked with shortening do not spread as much).  In the future when I make these delicious, soft, spicy cookies, I will use part shortening and the additional 1/2 cup flour.

These are great!  However, if you, like myself, enjoy a "bite" to your ginger snap, you definitely need to add some pepper!

Great cookie for fresh out the oven with a glass of cold milk.

5 stars as "gingercrips" - ours turned out quite flat and delicate, so we let them sit a little longer in the oven to crisp them out. This was successful. We used our usual alternatives: whole wheat flour, sucanat (dehydrated organic cane juice), always use butter. Followed others' suggestions and added extra flour, ginger, cloves and nutmeg. I tried refrigerating the latter half of the dough, and had the same results. But next time I would add more flour, because I do enjoy full-bodied gingersnaps.

Holy cow these are delicious!!  I'm a DISASTER in the kitchen, so if I can make these taste good anybody can!  I like my ginger cookies with an extra bite so I added another tablespoon of ginger and threw in some allspice as suggested by fellow reviewers.  I'm not sure how much of a 'snap' these have as they were a little cake-y in the middle, but that's how I like them.  If you want them more crispy I'd make the dough balls slightly smaller and bake the full ten minutes...and they DO spread, so six per sheet is all that will fit.
The taste is delightful and would be perfect with a cup of tea.  Absolutely yummy!  Get yourself in the kitchen and make these now!

Mine turned out exactly like the picture and are currently enjoying pride of place on my cake stand!  I did make a few minor changes, but I'm sure the recipe would be just as good without them, as it was mostly personal taste that prompted the modifications rather than any fault in the recipe itself...  I used (unsalted) butter instead of margarine and added just a pinch of black pepper and allspice.  I also added some ground ginger to the decorating sugar, as I didn't find the dough quite "gingery" enough for my liking.  I've had nothing but compliments on these, the first one being "best ginger snaps ever!"  Thanks so much for sharing :)

Very nice, chewy cookie with the perfect amount of spice. Holds up well on holiday trays, keeps well and freezes great, both in dough and baked form. I rolled mine in turbinado sugar... they were beautiful.

I used butter instead of margerine, that was the only change I made. Using butter made no difference in the outcome of the cookie only just a butter flavor. Excellent. Exactly like Grandma's. Not only are they a beautiful cookie, they are soft and spicy as well.

This has to be the very best cookie I have ever baked or eaten. (I did add the cardomon as I read in one of the other reviews. 1/4 Tsp per recipe and it makes a million dollar difference.)  This will stay a favorite at my home.  Recipe makes 5 dozen and enough for one big cookie. Here in Las Vegas,Nv. it takes 7.5 minutes in a perheated oven. (I always use unsalted butter also)

Very good cookies.  I used half regular flour and half whole wheat flour and they turned out great.  I didn't find it necessary to let them sit on the sheet for 5 mintues before transferring to cooling rack though.

People at work really loved these.  I accidentally used butter rather than margerine, so I had ginger chews rather than snaps.  A very good recipe!

These turned out fantastic! They were the last on my list and I baked them just minutes before my christmas work party. I actually had people begging to take the remainder home. I'm showing up at work tomorrow with another batch & the recipe card! Thank you for sharing :)

Awesome cookies!!!  If I could I would give it 10 stars.  The only adjustment I did was add cinnamon to the white sugar for coating the cookies and used butter instead of margarine.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!!!

Delicious. But I like a SPICY cookie, so to this recipe I added 1/2 tsp cayenne, 1/4 tsp allspice, and 1/4 tsp cardamom. **Roll the cookie dough in TURBINADO SUGAR before baking for added taste/texture.**

Old Fashioned Flavor. Just what I was looking for in a gingersnap. I did add a bit more ginger.

I read through everyone's reviews and made some adjustments to the recipe.  I added 1/4 tsp cardamon and doubled the amount of ground ginger which added a nice spice.  I added extra flour since I used butter.  I also used an organic sugar with bigger crystals.  I think using this sugar to coat the cookies looked nicer than plain white sugar.  If you coat the cookies with a sugar like this, only roll the top part in the sugar when coating.

Oh wow, these were good... and I normally don't like gingersnaps! The only change I made was to use 1/2 a cup of olive oil margarine, and a little over 1/4 cup of unsalted butter (leftovers from previous xmas cookie baking). I added about 1/8 of a cup of extra flour to make up for the extra butter. Turned out wonderfully chewy instead of being hard and crisp the way so many ginger snaps are... lovely!

The best gingersnap I have ever tasted!! Crispy but melts in your mouth, and beautiful to look at-- the top cracks perfectly in the last few minutes of baking and the sugar gives it a crystalized shine. These cookies spread a lot when baked, so space them wide on the cookie sheet.

I needed gingersnaps for a cheesecake crust so decided to make them myself and used this recipe.  I baked the cookies longer than suggested because I wanted to make sure they were crispy.  I used butter instead of margarine.  Initially, DH and I both thought they lacked ginger flavor and I nearly threw away the ones I didn't use for the crust.  But then with time, DH kept eating them and declared them to be the perfect gingersnap.

Even people who didn't like gingersnaps liked these cookies.

Recipe Modifications:
- I used butter instead of margarine
- I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg

Prep Modifications:
- I chilled the dough for a few minutes, rolled it about 1/4" thick, then used a cookie cutter. 
- I cooked for 6-7 minutes

They were beautifully crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. You do have to watch them to make sure they're not too crunchy :)

I followed the recipe as written, besides adding an extra tablespoon or so of flour for high altitude. They were chewy, but not too soft, and delicious! You can't just have one.

I followed these directions exactly. I don't know if I'll be able to go back to eating the ones from the store! Fantastic cookie! Pay close attention to the 1 inch sized balls and 2 inches apart, part of the directions.

OMG these cookies are AMAZING! They were so easy to make and came out so soft. My boyfriend ate half of the batch the same night I made them. My only suggestion would be, where it says 1/2 cup of white sugar for decoration, scoop out a 1/4 cup first so that the sugar isn't wasted if you are not making a second batch of these.

Great cookie!  I baked for 12 minutes and they came out crispy but not crumbly.  One problem, too much salt!  I'd reduce down to 1/8 tsp instead of 1/2 next time I make these.  The raw dough was a bit salty but I thought after rolling in sugar and baking this would go away, but it didn't.  Still really good though!

These were pretty awesome. I crushed the heck out of them to make a crust for my double-layer pumpkin cheesecake. It was out. of. this. world! I do recomend that you use brown sugar instead of white, it tastes much better!

Great recipe! I also used cardamom as suggested by others- I like gingersnaps with a kick! I topped my cookies with crystalized ginger- You can find it at import markets an natural food stores. It is a really intense, though sweet ginger. If you use it, chop it up before you top your cookies with it, it usually come in chunks.A little goes a long way. I used butter too, it made the cookies chewier, but not greasy.

I followed the recipe but my batter turned out more along the lines of cake batter when I used margarine.  I switched to butter flavored crisco and the next batch turned out perfectly.  I'm not totally sold on the ginger flavor.  I'm not sure what this recipe is missing but it's missing something.  Also, I had to bake them for 12 minutes to get them cooked.  It's probably my oven.  Overall, the flavor and texture is good but I'm still searching for my "go-to" recipe.

I followed this recipe minus the molasses, I figured it was going to come out a little odd. But to my surprise it came out wonderfully! I substituted maple syrup, I doubled the portion. Let me tell you, I was shocked at how good it was! Just enough gingery goodness and a touch of maple syrup! Wow!

The first time I made these my friend came to my house and told me it smelled like Christmas and her grannies house.  I figured out how to make the balls small enough before I spread them out using a little finger pat.  I made them a second time for a potluck and I did something wrong because the cookies flattened on me, but my co-workers went to town on them and said they were divine.  I like making them with Splenda and then rolling them in Turbinado (raw) sugar before they bake.  Definitely a keeper!

These were really,really good.My nephew even made Gingerbread Men out of the dough & they came out really good. (10 minutes at 350) The only thing is they were just a tad salty-maybe a 1/4 tsp instead of a 1/2? Still 5-star tasty,though.

I followed the recipe exactly, except for subbing butter for the margarine (equal measurement).  I also put the dough in the fridge overnight.  My end result was a nice, flat cookie that was neither too crisp nor too chewy.  My husband and I agreed that it was a very good cookie.  HOWEVER it was definitely very mild in flavor.  It was a spice cookie but, in our opinion, not spicy/gingery enough to be considered an actual "gingersnap" (and I don't really normally like them too spicy at all).  I'm going to try another recipe in hopes of getting more of the traditional gingersnap flavor.  

As a cookie, 4 stars, but as a gingersnap, only 3.

This recipe tasted okay, but the cookies were so flat--I don't know what went wrong! I don't know if I messed up the ingredient amounts a bit or if something was old, but it wasn't quite a 5 for me. I'll try to make them again and rate them again!

I followed your recipe and it is One of the best ginger biscuit recipes I have ever done. Thankyou. The Dough is the best I have made yet, the texture and taste was creamy. The biscuits doubled in size and looked devine (I love how they look gingerly). They made a rich set of 3 dozen like you said.
 My only doubt would have to be the salty strange aftertaste I got with them. That starts to fade after a night in the fridge. Anyhows, I think my only changes would be to Half the amount of Baking Soda and add another half a tablespoon of ginger. I enjoyed the experience and I thankyou for sharing your wonderful recipe. xx

I made these just according to the recipe, and they were phenomenal!  I've never had such rich, spicy gingersnaps.  I'm a fan of the texture-a bit of crisp on the outside and chewy in the center-but if you're looking for something that breaks with a snap, this isn't the recipe for you.  This one is going in my 'favorites' book!

This hurts, but I'm giving this recipe a 3-star rating.  The cookies were fun and easy to make.  The dough tasted FANTASTIC!  I had to stop myself or the cookies never would have made it to the oven.  I also made the dough the day before and refrigerated it overnight.  It was very easy to roll into balls.  Anyway, the problem was the finished product.  They did puff up a little in the oven, and even crack on top, just like the recipe says.  But they flattened out really fast - are they supposed to be completely flat when done?  They were also raw in the middle so I had to lower the temperature and cook them longer.  They're not bad, but I don't really like the chewiness.  I always thought the "snap" in ginger Snap meant that it snapped when broken in two.  These just kind of bend.  I'll rate the raw dough a 10, though.  That was fabulous!!

Very good cookie - I'd followed the reviews below and added roughly 1/4 c. more flour to make up for using all butter, which made the cookie rounder and less spread out. I also added more ground ginger (1/2 tea) and 1/4 tea. ground cloves.  I set the timer for 7 min, and check them each minute later than 7, everyone likes them better when they're slightly undercooked in the middle.  Great cookie!  I got rave reviews at the in-laws huge Thanksgiving gathering!

I made these exactly according to the recipe.  I made a double batch (which gave me almost 8 dozen!) rolled the dough into balls, rolled it in the sugar, then placed the balls on a tray and froze them.  When they were frozen, I tossed them in a freezer bag and have been taking out a few at a time to bake.  SO.  GOOD.  !!!!  I've been experimenting with the temp and time - I think a little higher temp for a little longer (375 for 10-12 mins) makes them slightly crunchier while retaining their melt-in-your-mouth quality.  My kids and boyfriend can't get enough of them!  YUUUUMMMM!!!!

These are SO good! I tripled the recipe to give away. Everyone loved them. I used all whole wheat flour to make them healthier, and I needed to add about an extra cup at the end to make the batter thick enough to form into balls. Then I just dropped them into the sugar to coat the tops, not the entire cookie. They were sweet enough. Mmmmmmmm

five star all the way. I took the advice of some of the previouse posters and added cardimum and extra ginger. I also added nutmeg and about 1/4 cup extra flour, baked them for about 10-11 minutes, and covered them with a thin glaze and let them set before serving. They go GREAT with tea.

Good cookies...I added an extra half cup of flour and an extra 1/4 teaspoon of ginger as well as 1/4 teaspoon of allspice.  I cooked them for exactly eight minutes and they turned out perfectly, with just the right amount of chewiness!

DELICIOUS!!  The recipe is perfect as is. Wonderful combination of flavor and texture. Cookies are crispy on the outside, yet chewy on the inside. Be careful not to overbake.  Thanks for sharing!!

these are great.  I took another reviewer's advice and added 1/2 tablespoon ginger and they were perfect.

Gingersnaps are my dad's favourite cookies, so I make these every Christmas.  I like my cookies soft, so I only bake them for 8 minutes.  These cookies are nice and moist, and have a great ginger flavour.  My grandma even asked me for the recipe!

Wow, I just made these today (actually, I haven't finished making them since my oven died ). I couldn't resist eating some almost straight out of the oven. They are soft, puffy, and really yummy. I used one stick of margerine and 1/4c butter since that's what I had available. Next time I bake these, I think I might add a little more ginger (or try adding alspice like some other people suggested). I think I only have enough dough to make 2 dozen rather than 3 dozen.

if you like them big like me it won't make as many.

These are delicious and so easy. I never liked Ginger Snaps until I tried these.  We used a melon baller to portion the dough, and 10 minutes gave us a wonderful chewy cookie.

The cookies were very good. I cooked them a little longer than 10 minutes because I like them crisp, like store bought cookies. I also put the dough in the fridge after making them. It made them much easier to roll and I think they turn out better. Great recipe, I will definitely be using this recipe again. ?

I had to make them for our bowling team, so I doubled the recipe. I didn't have molasses, so I used Log Cabin syrup. Had to add a little flour to make dough hold together, and followed the recipe otherwise.I rolled them in brown sugar before baking.  
I'm calling them Ginger-Doodles because they came out wonderfully chewy with just a hint of crispy outside. They are delicious and I'll  make them the same way next time.

Perfect chewy gingersnaps at 8.5 minutes in my oven.  Used unsulphured molasses (Grandma's brand), and the cookies turned out beautifully with only a hint of the molasses flavor.

I thought the flavor of this cookie was delicious. And I did enjoy the crispy edges of the cookie. However, the dough was very sticky and difficult to roll into balls. I also prefer a thicker, puffier cookie. I believe with a few adjustments this recipe would be more along the lines of what I enjoy in a gingersnap. I probably won't make this recipe again -  though they were tasty - I prefer thicker cookies.

I subtituted unsalted butter for the margerine and added a tsp of cardamom. they tasted very buttery, so much that any other flavors were overwhelmed. They looked beautiful, and my husband who doesn't like the gingery ness of ginger snaps liked them a lot. Maybe my butter substitution ruined them.

Delightful. I used an entire cup of Land O' Lakes Unsalted Butter for this recipe and came out with a dough that is easy to work with and cut shapes out of. These are one of my brother's favorites. He'll be so pleased and surprised!

I made these using Better Batter Gluten Free Flour, and egg substitute, and feared for the worst. Man was I surprised! They are delicious! You can't even tell they are gluten and egg-free! Everyone just gobbled them up! I actually used some of them crumbled up to make a pie crust for pumpkin pie. Delicious!!!!!

This was an excellent recipe. I made these cookies at the same time I made a batch from a gourmet magazine. The gourmet recipe took twice as long and tasted very similar. I did use 1/4 tsp cardamom. In the future I might roll the cookies in raw sugar and I might add crystallized ginger (the other recipe called for this, and I enjoyed it; my boyfriend did not). Altogether an excellent recipe.

I've had to drastically increase the amount of ginger in a lot of recipes I've used in the past, but here the amount is perfect. I didn't have any molasses, so I just subbed honey instead, and I used half brown sugar and half white. My Dad is in his 60s and he likes to hark back to the days of truly 'gingery' biscuits and cakes, so it's a great compliment when he liked these biscuits, saying they matched up to his memories.

The first time I baked these I cooked them as recommended, but after the first day they went a lot softer. Dad likes these to be crunchy so he can dunk them in tea. So I did cook these for a few minutes more the second time round - they're better the original way to be eaten on their own IMO, but my dad adores them crunchy with tea and is gladly chomping his way through the second batch at the moment. 

The second time I accidentally used half a tablespoon of cinnamon instead of a teaspoon. Still came out good.

I love, love, loved them the first time I made them.  So much that I gave some to the neighbors to show off.  The second time I made them, I decreased the size of the cookie and they were more gingersnappy than before - as they tend to be pretty soft.
My modifications: I added tiny bits of sliced candied ginger to the top for an extra zing.  Also used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all-purpose.

Great recipe! But I prefer a crispier cookies so I experimented with the baking time. I found that if you bake it for 15-17 mins the gingersnaps will come out perfect.

These cookies have a good taste but they are not like the gingersnaps I'm used to. The margarine taste is pretty strong. I would have expected the spices to be stronger.

Great recipe! Absolutely fantastic. I used half butter half margarine and added one more tablespoon of ginger. Cooked for 9 mins max they make the PERFECT gingersnap.

I am not a huge gingersnap fan, but I am running my own baking test kitchen this wk and I wanted to find some out-of-the ordinary cookies to add to my repertoire.  These were amazing!  I thought the dough smelled awful and was sure they would be gross, but it tastes so nice and spicy, but not too much.  I used butter instead of margarine.  I was surprised at how thin they came out, but they were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  They do spread out, so you may want to roll smaller balls to see how you like their size.  Other reviewers are right, be sure to leave them on the pan for five mins once you take them out of the oven.  The 8 minutes were perfect.  This is a nice cookie to bring to a more sophisticated person, someone who likes drinking tea!  I like this as much as I like my snickerdoodles, and that's saying a lot.

My review is based on my version (my aunt's, actually, based on the version from her/my mom's childhood).  It is identical except in two aspects:  we use Crisco instead of margarine, and we chill the dough before rolling.  I suspect that just makes the dough less sticky to the hand rather than making it impossible to roll.

This is a FANTASTIC, slightly spicy true-to-grandma's house kind of gingersnap. I have made this cookie a few times, varying the amounts of spices occasionally, always with great results! I added some cardamom, as suggested by another reviewer and it really brings out the flavor. I rolled my 1 inch balls in 'sugar in the raw' and due to the large crystal size, they came out looking just like store bought, maybe better! The cookies flatten out quite a bit, so space them a little wider than you think on the first batch. A definite keeper for the recipe box; my family keeps asking me for them again and again!

DELICIOUS.  moist, thin, spicy, and sweet!  plus, they were really easy~ only changes were to sub in butter for marg., and add a tsp of vanilla. the cookies do spread a bit, so make sure to keep them 2" apart (or whatever's good for the size of cookie you're making).

Excellent! I usually use imported Swedish gingersnaps for the crusts on my pumpkin cheesecakes (which have placed 1st in competition), but I ran out.  I made these instead (very thin) with the following adaptations to mimick the Swedish Imported ones: add 1/2 tsp ground cloves, and instead of 1TB ground ginger, I used 2 tsp ginger paste (bought from the produce section). These are excellent-just what I was looking for!

These were delicious!  I added about 2 tsp of ginger to it, and I also added a little more flour because somehow the 2c made mine very very thin.

This is the second ginger snap recipe ive tried. The first one I got from a betty crocker cook book, it was ok, but  it didnt turn out as good as i expected. about two weeks later my friend came over and we made these together. they are AMAZING cookies. We added about 1/2-1tsp of cloves, and doubled the cinnamon. great cookies!

Perfect! Tastes like the Pepperidge Farm version.  I used butter instead of margarine, which probably helped give it a little more "snap."

First, let me say that my cookies were delicious.  Now let me say, they were not chewy, but more like fluffy in the center. Also they did not flatten out much. I used a mixer, perhaps that is why and  I used “Splenda” and that may be why they were different. Maybe I should have flattened the cookie instead of leaving them in a ball.  I have to work on this!  Nothing wrong with the flavor though.

The dough was on the messy side but the cookies came out well. I found that if you make them on the smaller side you get more of a snap. Ones that were on the larger side were softer & less uniform (therefore the baker ate those 
;-) ).

Mine look just like the photos and taste awesome!  I didn't notice when I first read the recipe (before printing) that it says sift 3 times -- sift twice, then when adding the dry to the butter/sugar it says sift in dry ingredients.  I think this makes a big difference in the texture of the cookie - yum! Thank You for the recipe!!

These are a bit more like a molasses cookie than a gingersnap, but whatever you call them, they are absolutely delicious! Great easy recipe, easy to whip up on a moment's notice. I like mine soft so I bake them about 8-9 minutes. I didn't have any of the problems some of the other reviewers did with the dough being too soft - mine rolled into balls perfectly. I make mine vegan by using Earth Balance instead of butter and a flax "egg" (1T. ground flax + 3T. water) and no one who tries them can tell the difference! I've made these several times now and always get requests for the recipe.

These tuned out great. I did add a dash of ground cloves and rolled them in raw sugar instead of refined white, but that is due to personal preference than any issue with the recipe - a tasty one!

My husband wanted me to make something other than chocolate chips. I had my 15 year old son helping and even he thought it was real easy to make. The cookies look just like the picture,I also doubled the ginger and cinnamon,and baked them at 350 for 8 min with my double ovens it was a snap!We already decided to make them part of our Christmas cookie collection.

An awesome cookie.  I used butter.  I used half whole-wheat flour and used half brown sugar.  I added a pinch of cloves.  The cookies were slightly crispy on the edges but very soft in the middle, while still not falling apart.  A big hit with kids and adults.

I loved these and so did my whole family.  I doubled the batch but was too lazy to bake them as cookies.  I decided to just pat the dough into a jelly roll pan, then sprinkled the dough with sugar and cooked them about 20 minutes.  They were wonderful.

Good, I was going to give these 4 stars because the appearance/texture was a little off-- but considering they were all devoured by my boyfriend and friend before I could have a second cookie to verify my opinion-- guess it has to be a 5 star cookie.  They loved 'em.

I've never really liked gingersnaps but these are delicious!  I swear I ate about half of the cookies on each cookie sheet as they came out of the oven. I will certainly be making them during the winter holidays and might even take the suggestion of KJD79 to add cardamom.  Thanks for sharing!

These cookies came out the perfect texture and flavour! I'm not much of a cook, but I managed to fool some people! 
These cookies are perfect for giving as gifts, and the dough stores easily.

This cookie recipe is wonderful!  My husband had requested that I make gingersnap cookies and I had never made them before.  He loved them!  In fact, I made them yesterday, we gave some away to family, and he requested I make them again today! I think they are great, too.  I love that they stay so soft.

I made these to go with Pumpkin Dip for an office party and was asked several times for the recipe.  I chilled my dough first before baking.  It was easier to handle chilled.

Excellent recipe. Made a batch to give as a gift but my family devoured them!  I added an extra tsp. of ginger  and it gave them that extra zip. CAREFUL, they're very soft, may want to add cooking time or add small amt of flour to dough(?).

These turned out great! I brought them into work and got rave reviews. I'm going to use them for my pumpkin ice cream pie crust this year.

This was the first time I'd made gingersnaps, so the gooiness of the batter was a little hard to get used to, but the cookies were well worth the mess!

Absolutely amazing. Delish texture and taste!  Only altercations was a little bit of flour to make more of a dough, otherwise you can't shape into balls.I also cooked it for about 12 min instead.

I found that you only need 1/4 cup for dipping. And just under 1/4 cup for the molasses or it is a bit bitter, but not bad.

Very good recipe. I added some grated fresh ginger to give it an even more “gingery” taste, and about another 1/4 cup of flour. Even with that it still turned out to be a drop cookie. I will have to make some again because they’re almost all finished !

I used 1/4 C butter and 1/2 C light olive oil for the shortening to reduced saturated fat with very good results.  They took 10 minutes to bake in a convection oven at 325.  I liked the taste and texture of these.

I just made these today and love them! I will admit that when I saw this recipe calls for a tablespoon of ginger while others I’ve read only used a tsp, I was a bit leary. However I love ginger and thought I would give it a try, and I’m glad I did! The only changes I made were using shortening and brown sugar in place of margarine and white sugar. I will be making these again for sure.

These are really delicious and a lot more gingery than my grandmas, which I surprisingly like! Mine ended up crispy on the outside, and really buttery and chewy in the center. Great recipe for fall!

I love them!   They're sweet (without being too sweet), soft on the inside, and crunchy on the outside.  I might mess around with adding a few spices or changing the amounts, but that's just me.  (By the way,  to those who said it wasn't the right consistency to roll into balls, I added just a dash more flour and it turned out great!)

Used 83% soybean oil margarine and not the watered  down cheap stuff. No problem with excess spreading.

Made 28 large cookies using a two tablespoon scoop.

I thought they were great!  I used butter, added 1/4 tsp cardamon like someone suggested, and a touch of cayenne pepper (less than 1/8 tsp). Baked them 12 minutes and they are delish.

This recipe is perfect on its own- never fail. I like to add a dash or 2 of Nutmeg and substitute 1/4 cup of brown sugar for the white- it gives a chewier texture.

These were deemed the best cookies I've ever made. I kept them in 11 minutes and baked at 375 degrees in a convection oven and they turned out great. Soft on the inside with a little crunch on the outside! Definitely a new fav recipe!

I followed recipe except for ginger.  I added 1 teaspoon ground and about 2 teaspoons fresh grated ginger.  These are delicious but next time I will double or triple recipe and freeze some.  The cookies were flat and spread. I think maybe refrigerating the dough after mixing might help.

Great recipe. We are watching carbs so substituted Low Carb Baking Mix for half of the flour, Swerve for half of the sugar, and egg whites instead of egg and only used 1/2 cup butter and it still turned out beautifully. Hit with the Hubby and the grandkids.   per cookie, Cal 75.2, Fat 4.8, Carbs 9.6, Sodium 74.5, sugars 6.1.  Enjoy with a steaming cup of coffee!

These are awesome! Only change I made was 2 Tbsp of ginger and a little ground cloves.  Other than that I made as the directions given.  I may add the cardomon next time just to try it   as some suggested.  Will be making these often!

These cookies are AMAZING!  I used butter instead of margarine and put each stick in the microwave for 15 seconds to soften.  Other than that I followed the recipe EXACTLY!  The dough was a bit soft but I used a pampered chef scoop then rolled and sugared.  They came out perfectly when I cooked them for exactly 8 minutes and cooked for 5 in the pan.  They are crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle!

I made two versions of this recipe.  One with regular flour the other gluten free flour.  While neither are as gingery as I like, they were both good.  The Gluten Free version was dry right after making but seemed to moisten up after storing in air tight container.

These were very good.   I've never made ginger snaps so I have nothing to compare it to but I do have my friends..AKA taste testers and they thought these we great.  I read a couple reviews and did change it up a bit.  I added th 1/4 t cardemon and 1t black pepper.  The rest was following the recipe and this is a good one to save in favorites.

This recipe was perfect and I stuck pretty close to the original. They weren't exactly "rollable" but I came up with a method that worked quite well anyways (cookie scooper + spoon). I found that after they were coated in sugar, I could easily roll them into better balls. The cookies did thin out quite a bit, but I expected that and was hoping they weren't going to be too puffy anyways. I came out with a perfect (had to scrape the bowl down) 36 cookies, so to those who only produced 24, I think they were making their cookies too big. I also tend to measure out my cookies to ensure they all stay uniform in size.

I made these for my husband, the first time I followed the recipe exactly and they came out pretty good but the cooking time was a little too long and they were very hard. The second time I used half the amount of sugar and cooked a couple minutes less and they were absolutely delicious! And I have never even liked gingersnap cookies now I'm addicted

Great snaps and so easy to make. They are a family favorite. I tripled the quantity of dry ginger powder this time, along with 1/2 tsp black pepper powder and a couple of powdered cardamoms. I also used jaggery instead of molasses since it's difficult to source molasses in India. It tastes and smells wonderful.

OMG if you bake for the right time it is perfectly balanced between chewy and crispy! Also, I coated them in powdered sugar instead of granulated, and that was amazing. So overall, maybe some of the best cookies I've ever made/had.

makes picture-perfect tasty gingersnaps BUT if dough is over-mixed you get sticky sweet ginger pancakes.  If you cream the butter and sugar to the airy fluffy whipped texture like you would for a pound cake, the cookie dough will go floppy souffle in the oven - puff up and then flatten out (yes, this happened to me several times before I wised up and started mixing the ingredients *just enough* to combine).  For this reason,  even though I usually prefer to use butter, I'll use shortening in this recipe because it doesn't require as much time mixing to combine evenly with the sugar.

This is a perfect,  fast,  easy and old fashioned tasting cookie.   Don't alter the recipe at all.   
A note to Ms. Starla: with all due respect,  no where does this recipe call for the dough to be rolled out.   It calls for the finished dough to be  "rolled into small balls".   This is perhaps the reason for your cookies spreading more than they should have.

Everyone who tried these cookies loved them!
Initially the dough seemed a bit too soft, so I added flour, then sugar and molasses to taste.
No addition I chose to bake it 2-4 minutes longer.

Love, love, love LOVE! I am not a ginger person but I made these for my friend for her birthday (it's her favorite). She loved them, I loved them! I was a little hesitant about the shortening, but you only live once!

These cookies are very tasty, however the dough was so soft it needed to be refrigerated. Even after 1 hour it was very soft and hard to manipulate. The cookies spread out a lot. The taste is good, there are a moist chewy gingersnap recipe.

I cut down on the amount of butter by like 3 tablespoons(I replaced the margarine). I also cut down on the sugar by about a quarter cup. Delicious. I've made this recipe over a dozen of times. Flavor is always amazing.  I usually add a bit more ginger and put in a generous amount of cinnamon

Awesome recipe! I Easily adapted it to gluten-free(using 1-1 gluten-free flour with xanthum gum already added). I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening & added clove, cardamom, nutmeg, & a touch of vanilla for extra zing. Yum! Thank you!

Used three cups flour and added the 1/4 teaspoon cardamom that someone else suggested.  Not thin like gingersnaps with the extra cup of flour but more like an archway cookie than any other I have tasted.

Great gingersnap recipe. These cookies are chewy, which i love, but if you are into crisper cookies maybe seach for a different recipe. Also, i have found that you need to add a little extra flour to the dough to make the consistancy easier to roll.  I like my cookies to be spicy, so i usually double the spices and possibly add in some cloves or allspice. I also use blackstrap molasses instead of regular molasses.

I made my dough balls a little larger, so they came out soft (which is great too).  I baked it for about 13-15 minutes.  The whole family loved them, and it's so easy.

Very tasty cookie! I used salted butter instead of margarine and I didnt add the salt it called for. I also added about a tsp of cloves. The dough was way too loose to roll. I spooned it out and sprinkled the sugar on. It worked. They are really easy!

Best gingersnap recipe! I used butter instead of margarine and these came out exactly like a gingersnap should- crisp around the edges and a little chewy in the middle. And spicy! Loved them and so did everyone else I made them for! They went great with the pumpkin dip I made too.

Although it was a little messy rolling into the balls, once I rolled them in sugar, it helped. Hubby loved them. In fact it's a very good thing I opted to stick with the "makes 36" ingredients, as they're nearly half gone in 24 hours!

The cookies tasted really good! I reduced the white sugar by half and increased the baking time to 21 minutes. I also used butter instead of margarine and increased the ginger by 50%. You have to bake them for a lot of extra time if you want them to actually snap.

I followed the recipe but I used butter, soft whole wheat flour, organic molasses and organic raw sugar in place of the margarine, all purpose flour, molasses and white sugar. The cookies were delicious!  I even used some of the batter to make gingerbread men for my kids!! Thank you for posting it!

These are the all around favorite at my house and at work. Three helpful hints:1.Cooking in a gas oven takes considerable adjustment, I had to add flour when I used gas to get the consistency right. 2.I only use Brer Rabbit molasses as it is thicker than the other brand common in my area, and the thinner molasses makes the cookies flatten out too much. 3.The recipe is written for margarine and doesn't turn out well if you substitute butter. The cookies turn out chewy rather than soft.

I made them exactly as the recipe called and they are perfect. chewy inside with a very thin, slightly crusty outside. I used earth balance vegan buttery spread and baked them on parchment paper. They turned out just wonderful.

These were delicious, and got raves everywhere I've brought them.  I used sweet cream butter instead of margarine, a heaping half tsp salt, and vanilla sugar in place of regular white sugar.  I also usually mix in about 1/2 cup of candied ginger chips.

For a bit sharper taste, grind candied ginger (in a small blender jar) to heighten the ginger spice, sprinkel in a bit of cayenne, as well. 
I used white whole wheat flour in place of enriched white flour. For
a more chrisp cookie, roll the dough into a log, wrap, refrigerate for 2-3 hours or overnight, and slice thin. These cookies can quickly overbake.  8 minutes is just about right.

This is a good starter recipe. I doubled the cinnamon and added a teaspoon of allspice, which greatly enhanced the flavor. I also used butter rather than margarine. The cookies were perfectly chewy / crispy. Everyone loved them!

Oh wow, these were fantastic!!!  Only sub I used was butter for margarine.  Results were crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, thin, uniform, delicious cookies.  My only regret is that I didn't make a double batch, because these bad boys were hard to leave alone after they were set on the cooling rack. :o)

Too salty when I doubled the batch - I really like a gingery cookie so I took out the salt and reduced the baking soda and added extra ginger, cinnamon and some cloves - much better.

This recipe is dynamite!! I have tried the true recipe, then some little changes. 
Change 1 - I used vegetable oil and butter to make the 3/4 of a cup. Awesome.
Change 2 - I used brown and white sugar to make the one cup. Awesomer!
Change 3 - I use minced garlic that you can find in the asian cooking section of your local grocer. It gives it a nicer sharper ginger taste. 
Change 4 - I always add in some flavouring syrup (gingerbread or cinnamon brown sugar) to the dough before rolling.in the sugar. Gives it just another little flavour profile. 

I love these cookies, and have added them to my holiday recipes!! Thanks for the recipe!!

Cheers

I had the same difficulty as some others, where the dough wasn't the right consistency for rolling so I made drop cookies instead. I'm curious if the white sugar is supposed to be confectioner's sugar? I assumed it meant granulated sugar.

We love Ginger Snaps, and these are the best recipe I've found. My son says they are little meteorites from the planet Yum.  And they are!  I doubled the batch, which worked perfectly.  I did add a tablespoon of VERY finely chopped crystalized ginger.  I weighed the dough to get evenly-sized cookies... 18 grams is perfect. Baked in the covection oven at 325 degrees.    Thanks a bunch!

THE BEST!!!  I did use butter, of course, and did add the cardamom.  I had doubled the recipe, and instead of adding 2 cups of butter, I had used 1- 1/2 cups butter and 1/2 cup crisco.  Exceptional recipe!

Delicious! I added a teaspoon of cardamon to the recipe as I'd seen in the comments and I baked them nearly twice as long as the directions suggests to have a crunchier cookie and still a somewhat chewy middle. Perfect with a cup of tea!

Yum! I made these with gluten free flour and they were delicious.  I didn't have molasses, and they would be better with it, but still good. Added extra spices but no other changes.

I've been making these for several years now, and LOVE them.  A couple of notes...

I find that the texture of the dough is better for dropping if I let it rest for at least half an hour first.

Also, I've found that these come out just right (flat, but not too flat, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside) when I make them in coastal Maryland, but they are way too flat and it is difficult to achieve a good level of doneness when I make them in upstate South Carolina.  Maybe elevation or humidity accounts for the complaints of "flat" cookies that seem to be common here?

This recipe will make me famous. :) Seriously, this is better than my grandma's recipe or my mom's. I made these this past Christmas and they were great. Then I made them again today and instead of margarine and I think butter flattens a cookie to much, I used butter flavored shortening (the major brand). I changed the serving to 144 and also added a teaspoon of cardamom (as someone here suggested) and leaned a little heavy on the ginger and cinnamon. These cookies are the best! Thanks for a great recipe RAMB!!

So yummy! I followed the recipe to the letter (cooking them for 8 minutes worked perfectly), and the turned out wonderfully. 
I don't even like ginger snap cookies (I made them for my fiance), and I've been eating them non-stop... I'm going to have to get him to hide the cookie jar... ;)

These gingersnaps are AMAZING! My father said he didn't like gingersnaps...until he had one of these! I used real butter instead of margarine and they came out beautifully. I do recommend being very generous with the size of your dough-balls. Some of my smaller ones came out a little too crispy for my taste. If you want good-sized soft gingersnaps, go big!

AHH so yummy! :)  I ended up adding more flour to mine because I wasn't able to roll the dough into balls because it didn't stick! But having added more flour, they turned out SO AMAZING. Baked them for exactly 8 min and they turned out beautiful and ever so chewy.  Truly delightful!  Will probably try these again!

Added 1/4 tsp of cayenne, 1/4 tsp of green caramom, a dash of allspice,  increased to 1.5 tlbsp of Ginger and still not spicy enough for me.  Going to decrease butter/shortening next time and double spices, min..  These came out chewy vs crisp, but think I can get to where I like with some modifications

I followed the suggestions of previous reviewers and added allspice, cardamom and black pepper.  To finish the cookies I put about  2 tablespoons of crystalized ginger into the mini chopper until finely ground and mixed it with my sanding sugar before rolling the dough balls.  An exceptional cookie!!

I think I should change the name of the ones I made to Honey Spice Cookies: my kids came up with the idea to bake gingersnaps, and I said "yes" before checking the pantry.  I was out of molasses and ginger!  We used honey, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and cardamom (and sanding sugar on top) instead...FANTASTIC!!

These are already pretty  good but by also adding the extra spices recommended by SHORTIE93003 (2 tablespoons of flour, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, and 1 teaspoon of allspice), these cookies really come out spectacular.

I've been question for the perfect ginger snap recipe, and it seems I'll continue. These cookies are good, but not snappy like a gingersnap should be. I substituted 1/2c butter and 1/4c shortening, as I don't keep margarine around, and read other people had done the same. They looked fantastic coming out of the oven, cracked and raised, but then flattened, and were far too chewy. Also far too buttery. I should have learned by now to ever use more than 1/2c butter for any cookie recipe in which I'm making a standard amount. I only made a dozen, and have left the rest of the dough to chill in my fridge overnight. I'll probably leave them anonymously in the lunch room at work. 
If only I could find something even remotely close to Trader Joe's triple ginger snaps.

perfect. I dont know how other people's came out 'flat', mine were kinda puffy. I ended up burning the first batch because yeah, my oven in ancient so of course oven times vary and now I keep a very close eye on them. DELISH!

Delicious.  My mom had bought some store bought ones from the bakery and these ones actually turned out better than hers.  Will definitely make them again.

These are one of my classic cookie recipes. So soft and chewy. My friends and family love them! My only changes to the recipe include using butter instead of the margarine and blackstrap molasses (the really dark stuff). I've tried making them with whole wheat pastry flour, but the cookies were not as soft and chewy.

These cookies were excellent.  I baked them for 10 minutes as we liked them a bit more crispy around the edge.  They stayed soft for days.  Really Good!

I cut the ginger down by about 3/4 tsp (personal preference) and substituted pure maple syrup for molasses because it's what i had on hand.  They are heavenly!!! Cooked for 8-9 minutes and they are crispy on the pan side and chewy in the middle.  Yum.  Mine came out quite flat though, but maybe my baking soda was too old.

This is a very good, simple ginger cookie.  I used shortening instead of margarine and these turned out perfect for me.  An extra special touch is to 'paint' each cookie with a glaze using a pastry brush.  The glaze: powdered sugar, lemon extract and milk.  Yum, yum!!!

These cookies are delicious! I made them a little too big by mistake so they didn't turn out crispy or hard like traditional gingersnaps, they were quite soft but this made them taste just like the cookies you buy at our local Spicers (except Spicers have raisins or dates in them). They are fantastic!

We made these over christmas (really my sister made them) and followed the recipe to the letter. They were by far the favorite cookie of the weekend. The cookies came out crisp and thin. My husband and my father both love gingersnaps and both agreed these were better than what we normally buy.

These have real personality! It's very strong, but not overpowering. I used 1 stick (1/2 cup) butter instead of 3/4 cup, and they came out perfect. Thought it would be a little healthier and didn't seem to compromise the final outcome!

I've had this recipe passed down to me from my Grandma Klein and it's always a hit. We also add cloves and a teaspoon of vanilla to the mix as well as adding cinnamon to the 'decorative' sugar. YUM! (Another top tip... If the cookies get too dried out, put a piece of bread in your cookie tin and it will soften them back up.)

gingersnaps have always been my favorite cookie but nobody but grandma can ever make them right. i thought i'd give it a try anyway and i had to substitute 3T of fresh ginger but it was more than fantastic - as good as or perhaps even better than my grandma's gingersnaps.

As I was cooking the Gingersnaps, my husband said the cookies smelled really good and he's not a cookie fan.  This recipe is outstanding and I'll be making more of these during the holidays.  

Note:  I nearly bought Bear Rabbit mild flavor molasses but I bought the full flavor instead.  Glad I did because the cookie flavor packs a nice punch.

Excellent recipe! don't worry about making sure the cookies harden while in the oven.. to achieve the best consistency, bake 8-10 mins as instructed and take the cookies out while they are still soft. The cookies will harden on their own after cooling.

These were totally delicious! My family hoovered these up quickly. I will definitely be making these for Christmas this year. I agree with the previous suggestion of adding 1/2 tsp cardamom.

Excellent recipe. I used canola oil rather than margarine, but everything else I kept the same.  Was DELICIOUS!!!  Co-workers kept raving about how good they were and how "picture perfect" they turned out.

taste was amazing, but I will follow others' advice next time and add more flour as they flattened and spread out a lot....still fantastic taste though.

These went over BIG!  My husband surprised himself by preferring these to chocolate chip.  They were also extremely popular for the coffee hour crowd at church.  The only change I made was using margarine instead of shortening, and if I'd known how popular they were going to be I would have doubled the recipe.  I baked them 12 minutes because I like my cookies more crisp than soft.  The dough was stiff enough that I didn't have to chill it, but it might need it on a warmer day.

YUM! I used butter instead of margarine, golden syrup instead of molasses as that's what was on hand.  I also doubled the ginger as I love the stuff.  Great bickie

My husband just loves these cookies! I find that the best results is to bake for ten and a half minutes, six cookies to a tray, for the right amount of crispness. Again, excellent!

These are awesome!  I used butter instead of margarine and added 1/2 teaspoon more of ginger.  My family loves ginger snaps and we love this recipe.  I will never go back to store bought.

LOVE these cookies!!  I always add a tiny bit more ginger for that not-so strong, ginger after-bite.  I let them sit on the pan for 2 minutes before taking them off.  Crispy outside.  Chewy inside.  YUM!

What a wonderful recipe!  I followed other suggestions and added about 1/4 c. extra flour to the recipe which really helped to keep the dough firm enough to easily roll out.  I kept the rest of the recipe the same.  My fiance (who doesn't like gingersnaps) has eaten three already this morning!

These cookies were so good.  I originally made them to use as a crust for a cheesecake, needless to say, I never made the cheesecake.  I couldn't stop eating them.  I will be making these cookies at each holiday.  More often if I could just keep away from them, but it's impossible.

these were DELICIOUS!!! I substituted the sugar with 1/3 cup each white, light brown, and dark brown sugar, and added 1/8 tsp cloves. Next time I would probably cat down the sugar to 3/4 cups.

It didn't quite ball up to roll in the sugar per the recipe, but I plopped it in the sugar and rolled it which worked great. No mess on the hands that way too! Wonderful cookies!

These were a hit with my boyfriend and his brothers.  Crispy outside with moist chewy centers makes for an awesome cookie.  I used butter instead of margarine.  And used half brown sugar and half white for a chewier cookie.

These were soft & chewy which is how I like them.  Gingersnaps aren't my favorite but these were good.  The first pan was really flat & ugly so I added a couple tablespoons of extra flour and the next batch come out much prettier.  Maybe it's because I used real butter instead of margarine, not sure.  I also added a dash of ground cloves which I don't think affected the flavor much.  I made these for my inlaws who are anti chocolate and they loved them.

Excellent cookies!  It's hard to stop eating them!  I think I would actually increase the amount of ginger next time, although they have a definite ginger taste.  I also think 1" balls are a little too small and I made the later ones larger.  A great fall treat.

These cookies were easy to make and tasted delicious!  I used butter instead of margarine, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the cookies had a chewy texture and I like mine a little crispier.  If you like your gingersnaps chewy, this cookie's for you!

I added the black pepper and alspice as mentioned in a posted review above... IMO, it really overpowered the cookie.  I'll try this recipe again leaving out the black pepper... I hope his helps! I also baked them 10-12 mins...and they still don't "snap".  I hate to say it but as far a Ginger Snaps go, I love Archways... I haven't found a recipe that has the same taste...

Great recipe! Quick and easy to make with good tasting cookies. They spead a lot when cooking so space more than 2 inches apart on sheet.

These are awesome gingersnaps. They are chewy just the way i like them. However they could be a bit more flavourful.
