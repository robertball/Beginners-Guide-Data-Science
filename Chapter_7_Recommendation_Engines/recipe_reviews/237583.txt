I'm not vegan so instead of the non-dairy cream cheese I used 1/4 c of grated Parmesan/Romano and a touch more butter.  It was the perfect consistency--I used a small greased ramekin as a mold and the polenta held its shape beautifully without being too dense. My family absolutely loved it and I will definitely be making it again!

I used a little over a half a cup of polenta. I added about a half cup of regular grass fed low fat milk in addition to one can of coconut milk. It came out well. It had form but was still semi soft. I will make it again.

used instant polenta and adjusted time - still came out great! Nice and creamy. Would consider adding nutritional yeast or a touch more coconut milk for a smoother polenta.

Will make it again.  Just made it plain, with no extra herbs or spices.  Served with Chili beans.
