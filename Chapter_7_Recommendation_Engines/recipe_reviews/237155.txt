I would half the ginger unless you really like ginger. I threw in a Banana to thicken it, but I think I'll try an avocado next time. Also, it is easy to swap out the agave for honey.

I didn't have all the exact ingredients on hand, so I substituted frozen mixed berries for the blueberries, Fuji apple for the green apple, red grapes for the green grapes, and everything else the same. It was more like a slushy. Next time I think I will peel the apple as I did not enjoy the chunky pieces of skin.
