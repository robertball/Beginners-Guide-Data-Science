I just finished making a batch of this and was fairly pleased with the results. Next time, I think I'll go easy on the liquid smoke and cumin. Cutting both in  half. I can always add more! Also, if it's to be used as a salsa, it should be a bit thicker. A couple of hours in the refrigerator, however, ought to stiffen up the molasses and honey.

Author's note: we've modified the recipe slightly and feel it is much better with only 1/2 tablespoon of cumin.

I used 8 habaneros (instead of 6) and added 6 fresh figs (that I just picked and needed to be used up) and this came out great.  There is a lot of depth and lots of flavors.  It is great on tortilla chips.  My boyfriend really liked it a lot as well.  I made it in the food processor instead of the blender and it was very easy to do.  Definitely worth trying.

I did make a few mods to it.... 1/2 amount of cumin just because im not a big fan and no liquid smoke as I did not have any. I also added one or two extra habaneros. This sauce is great with everything! Reminds me of a commercially available "grillin sauce"...I grill several times a week and its sweet with a nice warmth that finishes out the flavor. AWESOME.

Ridiculously awesome sauce.  I substituted plums for the peaches because I have loads of them.  I made two batches.  One at regular heat, and one with 4X the habaneros.  Both were phenomenal.

Thank you for this unusual and delicious sauce.  This is my first time to use habanero peppers.  I used a food processor instead of a blender with great results. Since I usually do not like too much of a sweet taste, I reduced the molasses and honey by half and added slightly less than 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Per another reviewer's suggestion I used only a 1/2 tsp of liquid smoke.  I assembled all the ingredients in 2 cup measure (except peppers and garlic) first.   After mincing the garlic into the processor,  I  used disposable gloves for cutting up the hot peppers.  I may have to start growing these peppers.  I plan to try this sauce for chickpeas and chopped onions.   For a chunky salsa, I plan to try mixing it with chopped peaches and onion.

WOW - I made a double batch and only used 1/2 the liquid smoke as others mentioned, otherwise made it exactly as written.  I added some of the sauce to a turkey chili and hubby couldn't stop raving.  Had some of our Mexican friends over that love hot stuff and they kept saying how great it was in the chili and kept adding a little more.  I'm going to try and use it as a marinde, too.  Delish!

Awesome!!!!!!!   Just reading this recipe I knew it would be delicious. It is wonderful. As a dip, as a marinade. I'm currently dunking apple slices in it! 
The only things I did a little different, was just cut back a little bit on the sugar, and honey. I figured I could add more if I wanted to.  I did add 9 habanero's cause we like hot. Thank you so much for such a great recipe!

This was way to sweet, and REALLY runny.  Maybe it would be better if you used another type of pepper. We only put in 3 habanero peppers and it was still to hot to enjoy. I won't be waisting my money on the high priced ing in this recipe again. Sorry!!!

To much Garlic... 4 cloves is way to much. It over powered the sauce. This should be named sweet garlic habanero sauce. Very disappointed in the out come, not to mention it was about 20 bucks to make. Just to much going on in general.

Great recipe. I did half the amount of cumin and liquid smoke like others. Didn't have molasses, so added a little more brown sugar and honey to substitute. seems hotter by itself, but once on food it is great.

This sauce is AMAZING!!!! This hot and sweet combination is so addictive.  One of the boys wanted to just drink it out of the container.  We served it with fresh grilled Mahi Mahi tacos.  A keeper for sure!

I forgot the liquid smoke and I think it's really optional.  This is a great recipe, I use it on lots of things.

This was a great addition to our summer hot sauce selections.  I used it as a dipping sauce for chicken or to add a bit of fruity heat to other grill sauce recipes.  It worked great as a marinade for chicken tacos.  Very easy and very versatile.

I took the advice of others and only put 1/2 TBSP cumin. LOVED it! It will take me quite a while to go through all it made but I will be making it again.

I made this recipe the first time and it turned out great. Depending on how hot you like your sauce well depend on how many habaneros you add. I used 4 habaneros and my kids (10 & 8) loved it. Any more habaneros and I think it would have been too hot for them. I did cut down on the liquid smoke and it works perfectly. I also forgot the garlic and I didn't personally miss it. I will try it next time with the garlic. This goes great on chicken and Mexican food. Also, for those wondering, the sauce does thicken up in the fridge. Great recipe, I'm making this again. I also used ni sugar added canned peaches and between the molasses and brown sugar was the perfect sweetness and heat.

OMG this recipe is fantastic! You would think the habaneros would make this too spicy hot for a lot of people but it's very palatable. I did lessen the liquid smoke and cumin as others have suggested and find the flavors blend perfectly. I'm so hooked on this sauce that I use it on many different dishes and even spread my sandwiches with it - gives it an extra kick. Yummmmm!

I made this last week and was very pleased with the results.  A word of caution: This was my first time using habanero peppers.  I wore disposable rubber gloves to protect my hands, but when I was finished touching the peppers, I removed my left glove using my right hand and my gloved thumb rubbed my left wrist as I was getting the glove off.  It resulted in a burn.  Back to the recipe.  The sauce is thin and runny.  Today I had the idea to mix cream cheese with the sauce to make it a consistency more suitable for dipping.  The results were fantastic.

Very good.  I'd like it a little thicker: maybe peach pie filling or jam?  We would have been better with three habaneros instead of six for my family with young kids.  Sauteed chicken in this for burritos, and then adults added more sauce on the burrito. Everyone seemed to like it.  It makes plenty.

I think this is a great base to start with knowing you plan to modify it to fit your specific taste.  I put in half the sugar but pretty much everything else the same.  The smell of the habaneros maybe a bit intimidating at first, but push through, it will definitely be worthy it (if you like sweet heat!).
