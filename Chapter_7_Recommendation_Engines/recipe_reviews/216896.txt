Hubby and I both prefer a beer batter fried green tomato...but I made the zesty sauce and was blown away with flavor.  I'm sure it would be fabulous for the more traditional just as written.  Sauce would be great on other items as well!!!!

I didn't use this recipe for my tomatoes, perhaps I should have as mine were boring. I was looking for a dip and came upon this recipe, love it. I added the amount of hot sauce to my liking. Turned bland fgt's into a delicious delight.

This is my first attempt at making fried green tomatoes myself and I thought it went well.  They were tasty.  I used canola oil instead of the shortening to fry but followed the directions for the coating to the T.  I did not make the sauce as we already had one made that we wanted to use.  I will use this again!  Thanks!

These were wonderful and the sauce was the perfect addition. It was my first time making anything with green tomatoes and I can't wait to make them again.  My husband, who is not much of a tomato fan even liked them.

Made as written except for the butter buds. I have never seen those but the recipe was good without.  I'll admit that I used more hot pepper sauce than the recipe called for but the sauce turned out great.  I really liked the flavor the crackers gave however they did hold their crunch. By the time the tomatoes were cool enough to eat, the coating was already starting to get soggy.  This was a nice change but I will be going back to my cornmeal/flour mix. I will most definitely use this sauce recipe again. It complimented the tang of the tomatoes perfectly.
