This was excellent.  I only used white onion because Vidalia are not in season now, I didn't have the chicken bouillon so used about 1/2 of the 3 cups milk and 1-1/2 cups chicken broth.  I also sauteed a little celery along with the onion.

Ive made this recipe before. Its great folks and don't change a thing except maybe your seasoning preference. Serve with some steaming hot rolls with real butter (butter is more healthy) and you have a cold weathers night winner.

I wish I could give this 4.5 stars. While it was very good I feel like something essential was missing. I added some celery that I cooked with the onion and also some garlic. I think next time I make this I'll take the suggestion of another reviewer and stir in some cheese at the end. Thanks for the recipe Kristin. My husband really loved this and I loved how simple it was to prepare.

Very tasty! I made a half a batch for lunch for my husband and I as I was looking to use up leftovers not create more. But I sure wish I'd made a whole batch because now I want some for dinner too. I made it mostly as stated except added some celery and garlic with the onion a little extra milk (about 1/8 cup) and about 1/2 cup of water when I put the ham and veggies (broccoli cauliflower & carrots) in as I like my soup just a bit thinner. I also stirred in 2 handfulls of shredded cheddar cheese at the end. Toasted up a little sourdough for the dipping Mmmm good!

I changed it just a little for my husband who had a tumor removed from his stomach and is on a liquid diet for a least two weeks I cooked the potatoes and then pureed them with the milk I did not use the flour since the puree thickened it. and I did not add the vegetables

I had to triple the recipe to get about 4 quarts for my family. Original would not have been enough. I added sour cream salt and more pepper. Even with those extras it's a little bland and I need a substitute for the flour. I don't like the flour aftertaste. If I use again I will be modifying more. Just too bland.

I made this chowder following the recipe exactly. I used leftover ham from Easter half a bag of frozen carrots and a can of corn and served it with a loaf of homemade bread and butter. Both my husband and I really enjoyed it and I can't wait to have more! I wouldn't change a thing!

Great! I did as it said but I didn't have a fresh onion so I used dried. Also I used a whole bag of frozen vegetables but I should have only used half. Would maybe add another potato. Grated garlic and cheese made this incredible. It turned out wonderful! Thank you for sharing!

Ive made this monthly and its always great as directed or with mods.. I usually make it with powdered milk a bit more butter and pepper and I follow the directions on my chicken base.. Ive used canned ham baked ham smoked ham and left over boiled ham from ham n beans. It all works good. Ive used sage instead of thyme and its great too. I always add garlic.. Its a great ham chowder. We love it.

Perfect for a cold winter night. Easy quick and you can vary the recipe to suit what you have on hand (besides the ham of course!).

I would give 3.5. I'll try this recipe again using less pepper and a little more chicken bouillon and maybe some other spices. It was just a little bland for me.

This turned out to be a big hit with my family. the first two times I made this there was no left overs. There are 8 of us so I make a much larger batch. I did add more potatoes and used carrots rather than mixed veggies. I make it up a day or two in advance to take it camping with us & serve it with Texas Toast. Making a 3rd batch right now. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I thinned it with another 1 1/2 cups milk and 1 tbsp flour. I like my soup a little more saucy. Definitely a do over

Delicious! I added gnocchi to this as I didn't have enough potatoes. I was worried that 3 cups of milk wasn't going to be enough but I was proved wrong. Glad I didn't add any more liquid as it would have been soup consistency rather than chowder. I served this with homemade bread and butter. Family loved it! Double recipe to make enough for leftovers

Delicious!! However, it was more like a stew; not enough liquid. Mixed melted  butter/ flour( 2 tbsp. Of each) then added a cup of whole milk and an extra tsp. Of chicken bullion powder. Added it to mixture and more like chowder now!! Awesome! Highly recommend

I used frozen hash brown potatoes since I was in a hurry. I think they made it better
