Great! I substituted quite a bit here... I used two hot sausage links for the meat, kale instead of the pasta (to cut back on the carbs) and extra garbanzo beans. Topped with a little sour cream. Yum! Would definitely make again!

I followed the recipe almost to the letter.  My only changes were I chopped the onion, and I used canned diced tomatoes with chilies.  I needed to add another can of chicken broth when adding the chickpeas.  Very full flavored and balanced. Definately a Keeper!

Bf really liked this.  I thought it was okay--it's very flavored by the sausage, so choose something you like!  I'm thinking the difference in our opinions has more to do with bf liking the sausage I used more than I like it.  I changed this a bit bc bc didn't want me to do the roux, so I didn't, and I wanted to put it in the crockpot.  So, I put everything except the chickpeas and pasta in, let it cook for several hours, then added the chickpeas about 45 mins before, and the pasta about 10 mins before serving.  Worked perfectly, although I accidently dumped in more pasta than it called for.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made it pretty spice, but we loved it. I made cornbread muffins to accompany the stew and it made a great dinner.

I absolutely LOVE this dish it has become a bi-weeekly meal for us. I did make a few changes though i don't add the bell pepper or the pasta, I use 2 cans of diced tomatoes w/garlic and herbs, and i use a 1lb dinner sausage-beef summer sausage and 1lb of italian sausage. I also cook my garbanzo beans in the crockpot overnight on high to get them as soft as possible. Also i never add any salt or ground black pepper because it's got enough spice with the crushed red and the chicken stock has plenty of salt. Hands down one of my favorite meals

My family and I really liked this recipe.  I used Polish Keilbasa and half the basil and omitted the red pepper.  Very hearty and flavorful.  I used the penne pasta that I had in the cupboard.  I also did not simmer it for 3 hours-- I just threw it all together as directed and it turned out fine.   Highly recommend!

The fiance loved how healthy of a dish this was, he said it made him feel good all over. I think it had way to many garbanzo beans.

I made this tonight, with a few adjustments, and we loved it.  I diced onions, green pepper, and 6 cloves of garlic, sautéed onions in leftover grease, then added garlic until soft, then green peppers.  The recipe was great for instructions on rue- no trouble there!  I added diced canned tomatoes with juice and would let the liquid cook off some before I add the stock next time.  I only used three cans of stock because we wanted the liquid to stay thick and creamy.  After it started to boil I added the garbanzo beans, sausage, and herbs, brought to a full boil while stirring and then added the noodles.  I let that boil while stirring until the noodles were done.  We ate it right away and it was great! I used ground sweet Italian sausage from a local farm.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Really good, but definitely highly dependent on the flavor of the sausage. I used "ardelenesc" sausage that you can find here in Romania and it was awesome. I don't think it would be as good with italian sausage, but maybe that's just a personal thing. It probably would be really good with kielbasa.

Loved it.  Used Northern Beans because I did not have any chick peas on hand.  Also used tortellini for the pasta.  Don't add extra salt if the sausage is salty.

Didn't turn out looking like the photo but it was still tasty.  I'm only cooking for myself so I divided it up and froze it.

Delicious and comforting without being too heavy. I followed the recipe using some of the suggestions from other reviewers. I liked the idea of substituting kale for the pasta and prepping the beans in the crockpot - low and slow. My bf added a dollop of sour cream and was in heaven. It could've been a bit more spicy for me, so I'll add some jalapeño next time.

Yum!  This was tasty!  Used polish sausage and 1 can of garbanzo beans (drained & rinsed).  Did need to add additional chicken stock (maybe 1-2 cups more).  Will make again.  Delicious!
