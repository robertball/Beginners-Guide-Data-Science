We loved these cookies.  The only thing I will change next time, is to crush the corn flakes into crumbs, so they aren't so distinguishable in the final product.

Kids, wife, coworkers and I all loved this one!  You can substitue applesauce for 1/2 the oil and oatmeal for the coconut flakes, and rasin bran for the cornflakes. Healthy cookies! Doesn't get better than this!

The cookies were very good, but I agree they were a little dry. I added another egg to the mixture, and that fixed the problem. I did crush the cornflakes, and they came out wonderful!

I was having a craving for that melt-in-your mouth coconut/oatmeal type of cookie, so I decided to try these...and they fulfilled my needs!!! :) 

I reduced the amount of oil to about 3/4 of a cup, added an extra egg, no cream of tartar, and a little less chocolate. I did not use nuts, as my husband is quite picky, and I substituted corn CHEX cereal, crushed, for the corn flakes. The results were lovely!

Great recipe, I used to have one almost just like this. I rated this only 4 stars because it was a little dry. Next time I will not use as much flour. Great Flavor!!

Everyone at my house loved these.  I used Rice Krispies instead of the corn flakes and the cookies were light, and the edges crispy.  Will make again.

This is a fun recipe to play with!  I substituted Kashi cereal (that I ground) for the corn flakes. For half of the regular flour I used whole wheat flour.  Intead of walnuts I used pecans, instead of chocolate chips I used chopped apricots.  FABULOUS!  They were lovely and crisp on the edges and didn't last long in my house!  They are forever fresh cause they only last about 5 minutes!

tasty, easy, and good texture.  I crushed the cereal and added raisens.  I would probably decrease the oil a little next time though.

Delicious!  I did change the recipe a little bit, due to allergies and suggestions on this site, but these cookies are wonderful!  I doubled the eggs, crushed the cornflakes, and left out the chocolate.  They were still amazing - sweet, flaky, crunchy, and delicate but satisfying.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Following the advice of other people who rated this recipe I added the extra egg and changed the oil to applesauce.  I also crushed the cornflakes slightly. The cookies turned out perfectly without any other changes.  The cookies are both moist and chewy, with the added crunch of cornflakes and coconut.  I will definitely make them again.

YUM! I left out the coconut because we aren't big fans at my house. I also put rice krispies in instead of corn flakes (because we were out), and they added a great crunch to the texture.  Definitely a keeper!

I really enjoyed these cookies.  I didn't have coconut or nuts so I doubled the oatmeal to compensate.  I had to half the recipe but I still added one whole egg after reading the other reviews.  I also agree that these cookies are more oily than necessary and less oil probably wouldn't hurt.  Halving the recipe still gave me 24 hefty cookies.  My family will love them for the chocolate chips and the cornflakes make a nice twist.

These were dry as others mentioned, however it was more in that "buttery" dry than too much flour.  I did omit the nuts and added raisins instead.  The recipe made exactly 64 cookies using the 1.5 T. ice cream scoop measure.  These cookies maintained much of their puffy, ball shape and didn't really flatten out too much.  They were pretty tasty, but if I am going to put that much butter in a recipe I want the cookies to be light and crisp, not puffy and dry.

Definitely tasty, my only complaint/concern is that the batter was SO dry I practically had to force the ingredients to stick together. All in all though, they turned out yummy and really, you can't go wrong with the creativity in this hodge-podge type recipe.

Wonderful crunch inside.  I made a half batch and used only an egg white to cut the calories.  Yummy.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and made a few changes, I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce, 2 eggs, crushed raisin bran (minus the raisins) and no nuts (allergies). I didn't think that we could possibly eat 7 dozen cookies, but we did!

Delicious! Didn't add walnuts and cream of tartar, and used store-brand frosted flake cereal. The cookies did come out crumbly at first, however they "firmed up" to a light, crunchy texture after cooling on a rack. These don't spread while baking, so suggest flattening the dough slightly. I'm not a big coconut fan, however it's a critical part of the recipe, as it adds chewiness and a subtle sweetness. Will make this again for the holidays!

Good recipe, but in my husband's words, "I'd really like the regular chocolate chip recipe better".  I liked the additional fiber content, but as an earlier reviewer noted, my first attempt was a bit dry ... I'll try some adjustments on the next batch, but will definitely try again.

This was a tasty, delightfully crunchy and sweet cookie.  I used frosted flakes and reduced the amount of white sugar.  I also chopped the coconut and walnuts so they were fine and used three different flavors of chocolate chips.  Mine baked for 10-11 minutes and came out just lightly golden and finished cooking on the baking sheet.  Don't skip the 5 minutes, it really makes a difference.

I want to make something with my mixer that I just aquired and found this recipe. I mostly used all the ingredients except subsituted the oil for applesauce, 2 eggs, and used cocoa rice crispies instead of corn flakes since I didn't have corn flakes. I thought it was unusual to have 3 1/2 cups of flour. They were a little thick and bready for my taste. Maybe next time I'll cut the flour down by 1/4 or 1/2. Other than that, they were pretty good.

I should have read the reviews to know to crush the corn flakes.  They are quite distinguishable and chewy.  The cookie as a whole holds together long enough to lift from the pan but completely crumbs apart after one bite.

Yummy!  I halved the recipe, used applesauce instead of oil.  After reading reviews, I cut down a little of the flour, egg substitute equal to 2 eggs, rice crispies instead of cornflakes and white chocolate chips (I can't eat regular chocolate chips.  Awesome!  Loved them.  Well definitely make them again.

Mmm...moist, chewy goodness!  My family loved these.  I substituted 1/2 c. peanut butter 1/2 the butter and 1/2 c. applesauce for the oil.  Following the advice of other reviewers, I crushed the corn flakes.  I also omitted the walnuts (family preference).  The texture was delightful...almost like muffin tops rather than cookies.

Cookies were dry, crumbly, and not very sweet. They were very fluffy though and tasted like they should have been a lot healthier, but since I made them I know they weren't.

Ok- I cheated A LOT!! I have to give the recipe 5 stars because I had never thought of coconut or corn flakes as an add in to oatmeal cookies.  That said, I used oatmeal cookie mis from a bag and added about 1/2 of all the add ins.  They were perfect. You can taste a little cinnamon from the mix still so I don't think it over powered anything else. Yummy to me!

This was SO NUMMY!! Made this for a neighbor and loved them.  So did my family. I've made them twice and plan on making them for my son's kindergarten graduation tomorrow.  
You can use almost any "flake" cereal.

Crispy yet melt in your mouth. I revised to make gluten free. Result was wonderful. I did 3 1/4 cups GF flour, 3/4 tsp. xanthum gum, and added another egg. Only had peanuts in the house,so they were crushed and used instead of walnuts. Thumbs up, this is a keeper and I'm picky.

These taste just like cookies my grandma used to make.
 I made  couple of changes though. 
I added crushed pecans, and since I didn't have corn flakes I used the same amount of granola cereal. 
Also, I found that after the 12 minutes the tops were still not cooked, so I broiled them on low for an extra 1-2 minutes until golden. Turned out great!
I wouldn't call them dry, more of a thin crispy oatmeal cookie.

as per suggestions i added a second egg, reduced the oil by 1/3, didnt have coconut and used whole grain cereal flakes. Also didnt have enough butter so substituted with 50% shortening. Turned out very nice, melt in your mouth. I think the coconut would have made this even nicer

This is one of the best cookie recipes that I have tried  They were good freshly baked and a coupe of days later.  I think the key to making them is to take them out of the oven immediately when you see the edges getting brown. The center will still be shiny and moist looking.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great cookies!  I found they are similar to the Neiman Marcus cookies I made in the past, except much easier.  Mine had a shortbread consistency which was good with the crunch from the cereal and the oatmeal.  I also substituted the corn flakes for crushed chex cereal, to use what I had on hand.   I made a double batch of these!! Big Mistake!  The single batch is plenty!  Luckily I have neighbors who love when I drop off baked goods.  These cookies are a great treat for neighbors at Christmastime.

I don't know how long they stay fresh because my whole family devoured them in just a couple of days!  So good!

Loved this recipe, partly because I always have all these ingredients on hand!! I substituted raisin bran as suggested, and used raisins for the chocolate and apple sauce for half of the oil and butter. Delicious!

I made this recipe leaving out the coconut and nuts and crushed the corn flakes.  They tasted okay, but the resulting cookie had a "sandy" texture that my kids and husband did not like.

These cookies are so good. I followed the recipe.  They're fluffy.  I used Special K Cinnamon pecan cereal and I didn't use the cream of tarter only because I didn't have any in the cupboard.  I will definitely make this again.  My recipe made 6 dozen large cookies.
