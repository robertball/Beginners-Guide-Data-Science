This can be a tasty low-fat soup.  I omitted the butter and added chicken stock instead of water and used skim milk.  Also, increased the onion and added 2 cloves of garlic.  I, then blended the whole thing.  Don't forget salt, though because it needs it. The carots and cheese give it a pleasing golden hue.  The result was a 200 calorie, 6g fat soup with very good flavor.

I gave this 5 stars because I used this recipe in addition to another to get a fabulous result. I used 4 c. chicken broth and 1 c. fat free 1/2 and 1/2 as my liquids. I used 3 ribs of celery with their leaves, one whole carrot small diced, 1/2 large onion diced, a whole large head of cauliflower cut into florets and left out the potatoes completely. I used salt, pepper and thyme leaves as my seasonings and after cooked until everything was very tender, I processed in batches in my food processor(leaving some chunks for texture). I then returned to my soup pot and slowly stirred in about 1 1/2 c. of cheddar. Delicious!!!

This recipe was great! I did, however make some additions to it which made it even better.  I added chicken broth instead of the water.  I also had some leftover brocolli, spinach, and half of a tomato which I also added.  In addition to that, I minced my veggies in the food processor instead of chopping them, which cut down on the cooking time of my soup.  All in all it turned out just wonderful. Thank you for such an easily adjustable and yummy recipe.

A truly wonderful soup. Recipe makes just enough so it doesn't take long to make.  I added 1 chicken boullion to it for extra flavor. The best soup I've ever made. Thanks Jane.

I gave this recipe 5 stars. My family loves cauliflower and cheese...so I tried to please everyone. It was absolutley the best. My son had some friends over and it was dinner time and they helped themselves to 2 bowls each...My husband...who eats whatever I make no matter how horrible it was...just kept saying how delicious it was. I did tweak it a little...I didn't use any water I used 2 cans of chicken broth...no milk and no flour...I also didn't put the carrots in...I didn't want to over do the veggies. But I cooked this in my crock pot all day and the aroma was so tempting all day. Thankfully they all left me some too. I will definetly make this again.

This soup is very similar to one my mom makes and has passed on to me. In fact, its my daughter's favorite soup and she requests it regularly. I make a few changes: 1) I omit the potatoes 2) instead of putting the onions in the water to boil, I slice up a lb of smoked sausage (ie: Polska Kielbasa) and fry the slices with the onions. 3) Add the onions and drained sausage when the cauliflower and other veggies are tender 4)After adding the roux, use velveeta (and a little more of it) and stir until melted. Very good and creamy soup! This works as a great way to warm you winter nights!!

Fantastic soup for cold weather. Used vege boullion for more flavor, left out celery, and added way more cheese. We use frozen cauli and it comes out fine. Overall a great soup and it whips up in a flash!

I'm not crazy about cauliflower, but this soup is fantastic!  You'd never even know it's cauliflower soup.  Every person who's tried it, loves it!

I swapped the 1 C of water for a 14.5 oz can of broth (and used 1 C less of milk) and used 2 C cauliflower and no potato.  YUM!

I never start off my soups by boiling. Boiling to me waters down flavors.You don't extract flavors from onions by boiling them.  Sauteing is the way to go. Here are my changes. Cook cauliflower separately in water. Don't OVERCOOK. Separate a few florets for garnish. I sauteed my onion,celery (with leaves)in butter substitute. Added 2 cloves of garlic, 1/2tspn. of nutmeg(trust me on this one),and flour.  Cook for a few minutes Add chicken broth,fat free half and half and about 1 cup of water.  Simmered for a litle bit. Added cauliflower in with 3 sprigs of thyme continue to simmer and add cheddar cheese.  Allow the flavors to develop a little more and remove the thyme sprigs.  Using an immersion blender I blended it all. Garnished with the reserved florets and some lemon zest and fresh parsley.  I also sprinkled some chopped walnuts to give it a bit of crunch. Delicious ! I left out the potato and carrots.

Excellent!  Actually this tasted a lot like a baked potato soup we love.  I doubled the ingredients so we would have some leftovers.  I subbed chicken broth for the water after reading reviews. I also sauteed the onion with some minced garlic in the butter, then added the flour to make the roux.  I mashed the veggies with a potato masher, and combined everything without using a blender-the soup was a little chunky, the way we like it.  I then added some cayenne pepper and cajun seasoning.  The seasoning was perfect-just a little bite and enough salt.

This is such an excellent, easy, and versatile soup! I made a few changes. I used one can of chicken broth to cook the veggies in + 1/2 can water. I sauteed the onions in butter with thyme, garlic powder, salt, white pepper, and onion powder. Instead of using milk, I used half and half and a little bit of heavy cream. I did not measure out exactly three cups.  I added nutmeg, onion powder, salt, pepper, and Velveeta, 1/2 slice of swiss cheese, and shredded Mexican cheese to the Roux. Great basic recipe, I just prefer more spices. will definitely make again!

I've never low rated a recipe before but this was very bland and tasteless, I think it may work better by omitting the carrot and potato, using more cauliflower, a little more celery and definitely onion, a cup less milk, a cup of chicken stock and a teaspoon of mustard powder! I'm a big fan of Cauliflower Cheese soup but this was nothing like it - sorry.

I love how quickly this comes together--a great way to use leftovers from a salad bar meal.  Using Pepper Jack cheese for part of the cheddar adds a wonderful flavor.  This is thick enough to work well over biscuits (especially when the veggies are done in the food processor.)

Mmm-Mmm Good!  I made 2 small changes with this recipe.  I added chicken bouillon to the water & veggies then pureed it using an immersion blender.  Picky eaters didn't even know it was made with vegetables.

This was a VERY good soup. I too saute'd up the onion and some garlic and boiled the veggies up in chicken broth. I also used up some 1/2 and 1/2 I had in the fridge instead of milk. This made it VERY good ( and rich). Instead of the 4oz Cheddar cheese, I topped it off with some grated MacLarens Imperial Sharp cheese and some bacon bits. This soup is restaurant quality!!

This soup is phenominal!  It's thick, creamy and cheesey.  My girlfriend doesn't like cooked cauliflower but she loved this soup and was sad when it was all gone.  I added 1/4 cup dry vermouth, white pepper and black pepper, and used reserve white cheddar aged 2 years.

I will be making this soup again and again as the requests come in.

Good and easy to whip up.  I used frozen cauliflower that I defrosted for a couple mins. in the microwave.  I took others' recommendations and used 1 cup of chicken broth instead of the 3/4 cup of water.  The soup was still quite thick.  I also used shredded carrots instead of chopped.  I used skimmed milk and didn't notice a difference in the taste.  Also, I used Kraft "Mexican" blended cheese because that is what I had on hand.  I think next time, I will add some cooked and crumbled bacon.

This soup is exactly what I was looking for.  I doubled the vegetables and cut the milk to 2 cups.  I doubled the cheese.  I like a chunky soup so I made those changes. The potato gives it the body other cauliflower soup lacks.  Absolutely delicious.  Great on a cold day.

Best soup I've ever made!  I added 1 cup of broccoli, 2 chicken bouillon cubes, and an extra cup of water.  My family loved it and I will definitely serve it to company! Mild fresh flavor.

I modified this recipe a little. We don't care for celery, so I replaced it with broccoli. I also used cheddar and mozzarella cheeses. I used the hand mixer so the chunks of vegetables weren't so large. This has got to be one of the best soups I have eaten. Thanks for sharing it.

Although this soup is very good, it needs a little help with seasonings.  I too added 2 chicken bouillon cubes, but something still is missing.  Next time I would substitute chicken broth for the water and use a little more than a the 3/4 cup, the soup was a little too thick.

This is so easy.  I make a big batch once or twice a month, but it doesn't last a week.  I made it for a formal dinner party.  I was perfect because I made it a day ahead of time and everyone loved it.

This soup is wonderful! I used chicken broth instead of water, added extra cheese, and also added a little sour cream. My husband said it is the best soup I have made. Thank you for the great recipe!

This is an an easy, basic soup, it took me 15-20 minutes to make. Since I'm always looking to make foods healthier, I decreased the butter to 2 tbsp and accordingly did the same with the flour. You could use any vegetables you have on hand.

Made exactly according to recipe and it was absolutely delicious! Used lite milk instead of full-cream for a healthy version and still ended up thick and creamy and full of taste. Definitely a keeper.

We agree it needs some vegetable or chicken broth, garlic and some spices, but other than that, an awesome soup.  Will enjoy often.

Made this soup as directed with only 2 alterations. After reading other reviews I added about 1/2 Tablespoon chicken boulion for extra flavor. Being the only person in my household I never have milk in the 'frig, but I always have canned milk in the cupboard which I use primarily for soups. Instead of 3 cups milk I used a 12 oz can of evaporated milk and 1 1/2 cups water. I also didn't stir cheese into the soup in the pot, but chose to sprinkle it over the soup in my bowl. I added some crackers and had a very satisfying meal.

Put together with a combination of ideas from other reviewers. Used a 1 lt box of chicken broth, instead of water, and added garlic and onion sauted with the flour/butter.  Seasoned with a bit of cayenne, white pepper and a touch of salt (would leave out this bit of salt next time).  Lightly pureed about 3/4 of the mixture, and kept some chunks for body.  Used a sharp cheddar.  Very nice soup, and will certainly make again.

This rating is based on the changes that I made to the recipe (which is a good starter recipe by the way): 3 cups low sodium chicken broth/1 head cauliflower, chopped/1 large carrot, diced/1 large russet potato, diced/2 cloves garlic/1 cup fat-free evaporated milk/1.5 cups shredded sharp cheddar/salt and pepper to taste.  I boiled all the veggies in the broth until softened, about 10 minutes.  Then pulsed 3/4 of the mixture in my food processor (be sure to let heat escape if using blender) until smooth.  I left the last 1/4 a little bit more coarse for some added texture.  I then returned the mixture to the stovetop, added the evaporated milk and cheese, until warmed and incorporated and seasoned with salt and pepper to taste.  The result was something that my family enjoyed very much.  Thank you for starting with a great recipe---it's allowed me to adjust to my family's personal taste.

This soup was tasty and very easy to make. I also threw my cooked veggies into the food processor so it wasn't so chunky. I also substituted one cup of whipping cream for one of the cups of milk. You can easily add your own spices and herbs to dress it up. Cayenne pepper, ginger, basil or sage, chopped garlic, any of these would be a great addition.

I don't care for soup much but this was awesome! It was like a thick chowder with very tender veggies. My changes: added chicken bouillon to the water; subbed sweet potato for regular potato; eliminated celery; used one cup lite soy milk and 2 cups lite vanilla soy milk. It was all I had on hand and never mind what it sounds like, it was delicious. Obviously a very adaptable recipe and definitely worth trying in whatever incarnation you care for.

Very great, comforting soup that helped use up some Thanksgiving leftovers! I normally hate cauliflower but I didn't even notice it in the soup so that was wonderful! I doubled everything except the butter and milk, and ended up with 4-5 good sized servings. (Next time I'll probably quadruple it so I can freeze some.) I used chicken broth instead of water and also sauted the onions, carrots, and celery with butter and parsley before adding the broth, etc. Since I was worried about the cheese not reheating well, we just added cheese to taste in the individual bowls. I've added this soup to our regular rotation and also plan on making a variation of it by substituting broccoli for the potatoes so it will freeze better. Thanks for a great recipe!

It was a 5 star with some changes. Per some suggestions I used chicken broth (bullion dissolved in water) instead of water. Added a few cloves of minced garlic. Didn't have fresh onion or celery so I used dried minced onion and celery salt. I used 8 ounces of potatoes and cauliflower... I can never measure exactly 1 cup. Cooked them until they were VERY tender (about 20 minutes) then mashed them up a lil bit before adding the thickened milk mixture. I doubled the cheese and added a VERY healthy amount of salt (you really need it, but almost all good soups are high in sodium). I got lots and lots of compliments! The reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because you really do need twice the cheese to make it really cheesy and you have to add quite a bit of salt.

Wonderful.  The only thing I did differently was that I pureed the cauliflower and potatoes after they were cooked.  I was trying to copy a soup from our local restraurant and I did it, thanks so much.

Even though it always bothers me when people say "Oh I loved it!" yet they made a bunch of changes, I'm going to do something similar. I added extra potatoes (on accident; I peeled too many), added extra cheese (I LOVE CHEESE), and cooked the vegetables for some extra time because I don't like to chew my soup. It was so cheesy and excellent!

Great recipe!! I used a whole cauliflower and also used a can of chicken broth instead of water.  Next time I would cut down on the butter/flour and add more liquid.  Will definately make this again.

this was perfect for a cold day!  i substituted 1c chicken broth for the water, added 2 cloves of garlic, and threw in some broccoli rather than celery, per my husband's request.  i also used a little over 1 c of sharp cheddar.  towards the end i used a potato masher on the whole mixture, which helped break down the potatoes and give smaller chunks of the other veggies.  this got my 18 mo old AND my husband to eat all of their vegetables.  that's how i define success in my house!  i will be making this regularly.

I took the advice of others and used chicken broth instead of water, used more vegetables (omitted the potatoes), and more cheese (Velveeta, cheddar, mozzarella, and a generous amount of parmesan), and a teaspoon or so of garlic powder.  I also blended half of the vegetables in the food processor.  Great taste and a nice change of pace from other soups.  Surprisingly filling, too!  Got rave reviews from my parents, who are particularly tough soup critics.

Wow! I used a garlic and parsley buillion cube with the water and veggies. I added 3 cups of cauliflower, 3\4 cup shredded carrots and 2 cloves of garlic (and no celery). Next time I will use at least 4 cups cauliflower and 1 cup carrots, and only 1 clove of garlic. It was amazing, especially for a cauliflower soup. Thanks so much!

This soup was excellent, I will definitely make again. It tastes similar to a California Medley that you can get at some restaurants. I made a few modifications to the recipe.  I used 1 cup of water with 2 chicken bullion cubes to boil the veggies in, I substituted brocolli for the potatoes and I used half cheddar cheese and half low fat Velveta.

Just tried this today! Delicious. I made a few variations with ingredients as well, just playing around. I made adjustments to the amounts - I didn't use carrot or celery, I used more cheese at the end, I added a little bit more potato (**used red skin potatoes; so good in everything!) and cauliflower and adjusted liquid until it was right, ended up using less milk than instructed which was okay as I feel more would give it more of a chowder-feel than I wanted it to have. I threw some sliced garlic in with the milk and added crushed red pepper at the end. Also some left over spinach I realized I had even after it was done, just stirred in. 
Over all, a good soup! The downside is it is bland, even with adjustments, which not everyone would be a fan of. I do think if I had used chicken broth as the other reviews had, I would have had some more flavor in there, but still delicious, nonetheless. 
Will try vegetable or chicken broth next time for sure, and will be making this again.

Sooo good. I altered it for our family used 1.5 c almond milk coconut oil and water instead of butter and 2.5c water with chicken b cube and minced garlic. Used hand blender added a little more water at end to make less thick. Verrrry good would be good just as is I'm sure just don't do certain products in our house

Very nice, comforting soup.  I used veggie broth instead of water and used the whole can to give my veggies enough room to simmer.  Added more cauliflower and 2 cloves of garlic.  Used my immersion blender before adding the cheese.  Used extra sharp cheddar, and finished with a couple of dashed of cayenne and paprika.  We really enjoyed this, will make again.

A lot of the reviews mentioned that this soup was bland. I used veggie bouillon, lots of onion and garlic, a bit more water and a bit more cheese. Fresh jalepeno pepper, Extra salt, extra pepper.This soup is THICK but not bad. I was worried about the texture not having a blender but during boiling everything broke down a bit and had a decent consistency. Got cauliflower haters to love it!

This soup is phenomenal. I add broth instead of water and a put a small hot pepper in at the beginning to give it a little zing.  Everyone I serve it to loves it!

Needs more cauliflower.  Cut back on carrots as it overpowers the cauliflower.

Very tasty!  I took other recommendations and used chicken broth instead of water.  I also added a little extra veggies and used whole milk to make it more creamy.  I went with sharp cheddar instead of mild which was a good move.  Delish!  Next time I may add extra onion or try garlic to add pizzazz.

This was amazing! My husband, who is not a soup person and likes his food piping hot, ate this cold and couldn't stop snitching! Definitely a favourite in our house now.
I followed this recipe almost exactly, except I used vegetable stock instead of water and margarine instead of butter and I puréed most of it at the end (leaving some chunks for texture). So good!

Loved it!  I was looking to use up cauliflower and someone from "thebuzz" suggested this recipe.  I made as written; only doubling it.  I made it 2 days early to take to my in-laws.  The results were a nice thick and chunky soup, just what I was looking for.  It was not thick after making it, but I think sitting in the fridge for two days thickened it.  The flavors blended together nicely.  You could easily sub chicken or vegetable broth in place of the water.  I went light on the salt and pepper and let everyone season their own bowl.  Soup was enjoyed by all and will be made again.

What an unexpected delight!   I used this as a base, though I did tweak things a bit:  I sauteed the onion (and garlic I added...what's a soup w/out garlic/!) in a bit of EVOO before adding the veggies and chicken broth (instead of water). While it simmered, I made the roux and then added it to the pot. I used a whole head of cauliflower, an onion, 5-6 carrots, and 4-5 smallish white potatoes. I reduced the butter/flour/milk by about 1/2 (just looking to "save" a few calories) and used about 1.25 C of a shredded "mac & cheese" blend. So good, though not the most appetizing looking. I also blended most of it, trying my immersion blender first and finally caving and using a blender for the larger chunks.  I'm already looking forward to leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  THANKS, janiebear925!

This was very good. I made a few adjustments after reading other reviews. I used one cup chicken broth, 1 1/2 cups of milk and 1/2 cup of half and half.
Also, I sauteed the onion, carrots and celery in butter first until tender, then added the flour. I think this gives extra flavor.
Also, I added 1 tsp garlic salt, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp white pepper and 1/2 tsp thyme.

overall a good recipe. I've made this twice, the first time following the rcipe exactly,and it was ok. The second time I made the following changes, I used chicken bulion when i cooked the veggies, and I cut back on the amount of potatoes,using more cauliflower. Because i like food spicy I used cheddar and pepper jack cheeses to add just a little bite.

Delicious soup.  I did as the first reviewer suggested and left out the butter, added chicken broth instead of water and used skim milk to cut calories.  I didn't use any potato, just added extra cauliflower instead and used low fat cheese.  I used the immersion blender to blend everything together in the pot on the stove.  It was yummy.  I didn't know if it would freeze well due to the cheese and creaminess of the soup but I froze the leftover soup and it was perfect a couple of weeks later.

I just made this, it's very good.  Will have to come back once DH tries it for his comments. I did tweak it. Used small whole head cauliflower(approx 4 cups) kept all other measures the same & added 2 bouillon cubes to veggies as cooking and another when soup was done.  Added a bit of Italian spice, garlic/onion powder & 1 t Worcester at the end.

I thought this was very good and tasted very rich as if it were made from cream and not skim milk which is what I used.  Like the others, I also used broth instead of water and I used the food processor to chop veggies very small before boiling.  I can't imagine the fat content listed is right since the only real thing with fat would be the better and that doesn't seem like much better for a full batch of soup.  With that said, I think you could easily leave out the cheese b/c it was plenty tasty without it.

I too, made some changes, so the rating reflects the soup after I fiddled with it. I didn't use water or milk, but 1 and a half (or so) 946ml cartons of chicken stock. I chopped a whole head of cauliflower, 1 bunch celery hearts and 1 white onion, simmered them in a small pot with enough broth to cover until soft. Then I put it in the blender till smooth, in the meantime made a roux and added a carton of broth to it, then stirred in the pureed veggies. (I totally omitted the potatoes and carrots. )Then I added 1 cup shredded asiago and 1 cup shredded parmesean (no cheddar) and served it up with some fresh crusty bread. Delicious! The broth made it salty enough for us and the cheese kept it tart. It was very creamy and smooth, even without milk or cream. I should also mention that my husband hates veggies, but loved this soup.

This is a good soup for people that like plain stuff, with not a lot of spice.  I spruced mine up a bit and it was a hit the first night, but it doesn't reheat as well... so don't make a bunch extra thinking it will get eaten over a couple days.  I would make it again if I had cauliflower to get rid of.

Good soup! It is very creamy and rich. I made some variations -- used veggie broth in place of water, tossed in some broccoli, and used whole wheat flour. I also blended everything before adding in the cheese, to make for a creamy consistency. I found it needed quite a lot of salt at the end, which usually I am hestitant to do. However, in this case, it did make the soup very delicious.

This definitely needs more cheese than the recipe calls for. I used extra-sharp cheddar and also a little parmesan. (Next time I would include some blue cheese such as Stilton for extra flavor.) I followed others' advice and used chicken broth. A cup of half-and-half provided extra creaminess.

Mmmmmm..  This may be my new favorite soup. I had hernia surgery a little over two weeks ago. They told me to start doing normal things. What's more normal than making a big pot of soup?  I followed the recipe exactly and it's perfect. I may have boiled the veggies a little longer because I accidentally didn't set the timer. I used a potato masher and it worked perfectly for the consistency. 


I loved the mix of the potato with the cauliflower and other vegetables. It was creamy, delicious a just a little cheesy. Thank you so much!  I used half a bag of cauliflower florets so I'll be ready to make it again;.

Update:  I made my 2nd batch which included less potatoes and no cheese. (Sadly). Still delicious.  One thing I don’t understand when people say something like “it needed chicken broth”, no it doesn’t. You might prefer it but it shouldn’t change your rating. You realize when you use the broth from the veggies, that is a veggie broth of sorts. That was all I used. As a vegetarian, I use veggie broth quite a bit but so try not to use unless absolutely necessary. The water/broth that the veggies cooked in worked out great and included starch. I don’t always want extra preservatives and stuff from vegetable broth.

Followed another reviewer's advice: Used a whole head of cauliflower, put in extra carrots, celery, and onion, added garlic, omitted potatoes, sauteed veggies in butter  before cooking in 4 cups chicken broth, added less milk to roux,  blended veggies before adding roux and cheese to pot. Delicious!

I left the potatoes out & used an immersion blender, just before serving, to thicken a bit. I would make this again.

I was really surprised at how easy this was to make. All you have to do is chop up the veggies, boil them, make a quick roux, and you're all done. If you're efficient, it could take as little as 30 minutes. 

I'm not much one for measuring, so I guessed at the vegetable amounts. What I ended up using was: 1 whole russet potato, 3 whole carrots, 5 celery stalks,  1 head of cauliflower, ~1/3 of an onion (that I had left over from something else), and 5 green onions (to supplement). I also tossed in 2 cloves of garlic, which was a great addition! 

I had to use quite a bit more than 3/4 cup of water (but I didn't measure, so I'm not sure exactly how much). Most of it boiled out while cooking the veggies, so there was probably only about 1 cup left when I added the sauce. 

Like the recipe said, I added salt and pepper to taste--then added cheese to taste as well, since you can never have enough in my opinion.  

It turned out great! It's a very creamy, comforting dish, and I have enough for at least three large servings, maybe four.

Like many others, I thought it had to much mustard.  Will try again with a little less mustard or a different kind of mustard.

I think this is a very good base to start from, and like several others, added a few things.  I used vegetable stock in place of water, using a full cup and let it boil down. To the milk and roux, I used sharp cheddar, a few slices of American cheese, 1/2 cup of leftover "cream cheese sauce" from a local chain pizza joint, which is basically garlic and whipped cream cheese, and then I added a teaspoon of mustard seasoning (dry) and a pinch of cayenne. I also salted and peppered to taste. This going to be a staple here in this house! Yum!

This was a great recipe!  After looking at the other reviews, I also added chicken stock instead of the water, 2 minced garlic cloves and a dash of thyme.  I did not use the butter but simply add 2 Tablespoons of flour to the vegetable /chicken broth mixture after it was cooked and then added the milk.  Reducing the flour from 1/4 cup to 2 Tablespoons ensured that the soup was not too thick.  This soup had great flavour.  I had so much cauliflower on hand that I made 4 batches and froze it before adding the flour, milk and cheese.  It will be so easy to pop it out of the freezer, add the remaining ingredients and finish the cooking process.  This is a great soup for that cold wintery day and since cauliflower is one of those new super foods, it has great nutritional value and is  low on fat as long as you use lower fat milk and cheese.

Starting off by saying the end result was ok, but I added a lot to spruce up the bland flavor. I think for me next time I make it you have to have a meat base and not water and as well I would add meat. I took one suggestion from another rater who said to bled half of it, I wouldn't do that again as it gives a grainy texture to the soup. As well I found myself spending two hours to make this soup slow chopper I guess, just way to many steps. I'm glad I tried it tho and will do it again just with my spin on it. Thanks for the base tho i'v never made cauliflower soup before and this was not too bad!

I doubled this recipe and added extra cheese. It's a pretty good soup, very creamy and reminiscent of clam chowder. My girlfriend added New Orleans seasoning to her bowl to give it more flavor.

My Husband LOVED this soup! He kept raving about it and how I should make a massive batch to put in the freezer so he can have it anytime. I added a bit more cauliflower 1-2 cups more and added sausage per someone else's review as well as used the immersion blender on it a little. It had a great consistency and felt hearty.

This is a great recipe! I did have to alter just a bit due to low carb and what I had on hand. I had lots of cauliflower, so I used 1/2 cup butter and equal parts flour. I steamed the cauliflower and celery in chicken broth. I only added a little bit of chicken bullion and pepper. No carrots (didn't have any) and no potatoes (stupid low carb). I bet it would have been great with the carrots and potatoes. Thank you for a great recipe! Also used 2% milk. :)

Give it 7 (yes7!!!!!) stars.   Of all the recipes for cauliflower, this is my husband's favorite.  He says it is THE BEST SOUP I HAVE EVER MADE and I make a lot of soup.   I really did not change a thing - except that I did not have celery (so I will never add it now) and I always add a pinch of thyme to this kind of recipe so I will keep doing that!   Make this soup and you will love it.  Frozen cauliflower works fine, too.  One more thing -  garnish with toasted chopped almonds for a heavenly treat.  Jack really loves that!   Thank you janiebear925!!!!!

This was a good starter recipe, however I made some changes.  I cooked the chopped up vegetables in 2 tablespoons of olive oil for 5 minutes before I added the liquid.  I added a bit of garlic and used vegetable broth instead of water.  I also added some chopped fresh parsley, finished it off with a 4 year old cheddar.  Very good!

This was exactly what I was looking for - a quick and easy soup that did not have to simmer for a long time.  Using stock instead of water, as others had recommended, I had this soup ready in fifteen minutes or so, and my family ate it up!  I would definitely consider doubling, even for my family of four, if using as a main dish.

I loved this soup! Like others, I used a whole head of cauliflower but left out the potato. I also used veggie broth and added more cheese and even leftover blue cheese that I had in my fridge. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and put all of the veggies in my food processor first, so it cut down on cooking time. Turned out delish!

I thought this recipe was Fantastic! i made it for my family and they all loved it. The only thing i changed was to add more cheese and to double the portion size. While the original quantities worked for 3 people we found with 4 adults, doubling the recipe was better for us since it allowed for leftovers. Serve this with fresh buns and its filling and satisfying. :)

this was wonderful----added a chicken bullion cube to the water.  This recipe is a great base for any cream soup---Im going to make corn chowder using this recipe.  Today I made it with broccoli ---used about 3 times broccoli more than called for.  Added 1 1/2 tsp of dry mustard, a few shakes of hot sauce, and thickened it a bit more with a handful of mashed potato flakes.   Needs sale and pepper to your taste.

we loved it. My 2 year old son helped make it and gobbled it up. we had to add quite a bit of salt and pepper for flavour and I doubled the recipe and added almost 4 cups of shredded cheese.
I will definitely make this again.

With the couple of changes I had a tasty, simple lunch that cleaned out the fridge.I needed a cup more liquid(weak broth rather than water) to boil the veggies, so I used evaporated milk instead of regular and lessened it by the same amount. I also had some leftover mashed taters(nothing added) that I used instead of cubed potatoes which thickened the base some so I only needed half the roux.  The broth surely added a little flavor but probably no more than additional salt.

Great recipe and so flexible. I live in Thailand and want to find recipes that I can find local ingredients (so it's still cheaper to make) and this is very easy to do here (even though I did bring my own cheddar from the states this year). I've made this two times now and both times didn't use celery because I couldn't find it at the local out-door market. I simply added more cauliflower, potatoes and carrots. It turned out great both times. I've been tempted to add some Thai chilli's to spice it up, but made it for guests/children both times. I've used a thicker cream for half of the milk and then water for the other half. I feel like you can't go wrong with this soup, and it's a hit every time! Thanks everyone for all the insight/ideas for this recipe!

YUM. I pretty much made as is but I used more cauliflower instead of potatoes, and omitted the celery (I simply forgot it!). I did add 2 tsp chicken bouillon granules, and subbed half the cheese for frito lay mild cheddar cheese dip to cut down on the calories. The recipe is delicious, and I don't believe subbing half dip on my doubled recipe made any difference in flavor. Thanks so much!

Loved this! One of the best recipes off this site! I used chicken broth instead of water, and next time I think I will add more of the veggies, but overall it was wonderful! Served it with croutons on top. Husband and son both loved it.

So tasty! I will be making this again for sure. Was easy to make and tastes wonderful & healthy.
( I didn't add the celery however because I forgot to buy it).

The recipe works.  I thought it a little bland so I added a garlic clove pressed into the sauce a few minutes before it was ready and some chopped ham.  I also added quite a bit of salt and pepper.  It would be excellent with some chopped smoked sausage too.

Easy to throw together, I use chicken broth to simmer the veggies.  And seasoned with salt and pepper when it was done.

I made this soup last Saturday and my family loved it. Since I used a whole head of cauliflower I doubled the recipe and it came out wonderful. The only other change that I made was that I didn't have celery, but I will add the celery next time, which will be soon. Thanks!

This soup is fantastic!  I made it almost exactly as written, only I substituted the water with chicken broth and I used broccoli instead of cauliflower since my kids prefer broccoli.  I pureed it before adding the milk sauce to the cooked veggies and it turned out just perfect!

This soup was excellent.  I used chicken stock because I had it but I don't believe it made any difference.  I will definitely make it again, and will use this as my base for clam chowder.

Thanx for the recipe ! My soup turned out very good even though, in my attempt to kick it up a notch, I added garlic and then it tasted like Alfredo sauce a bit so I wont be doing that again! I fixed this problem by adding some white wine vinegar, cayenne pepper, Tabasco and a spoonful of sugar and really it turned out delicious ! next time I also wont be adding celery because mine turned a dark green and didn't look too nice in my soup lol but will definitely be making this again

Excellent recipe.  Added cornstarch in place of some flour for a faster thickening process.  Also included chicken boullion & 2 cloves of garlic for better flavor. Could use a lot of different vegetable combinations in this depending on your taste.

I agree with the other reviewers that chicken stock should replace the water for more intense flavor and I also agree that fat free 1/2 and 1/2 is a super choice. Very rich tasting that way. I also use Velvetta  and sharp cheddar with a generous spoonful of sour cream for a nice tang and a few drops of hot sauce for some zip. My picky kids and even husband like this if I leave out the potatoes. He's diabetic.

My husband LOVES this, but I'm just not too impressed... I probably just did something wrong LOL, but it has an odd consistancy, and there was really not that much flavor to it... I added a LOT of pepper, salt, garlic, & herbs, and it's still just ok. Might've been better cooking the veggies in chicken broth instead of water. Not sure if I'll try this again...

Wonderful soup! I had some roasted califlower and put that in. I also had a little half and half (1 cup) as part of the milk measurement. I followed the other reviews and added a chicken broth instead of water. My family loved it!

This was exactly what I was looking for to use up vegetables in my fridge that had seen better days. I used a small head of cauliflower instead of a cup,  skipped the flour and added a bit more cheese. It was already so thick with the extra cauliflower. DELISH!

I used almost a full head of cauliflower and left out the potatoes.  I added a chicken boullion cube to the 3/4 cup water.   But that wasn't enough water to cover all the vegetables so I added extra chicken broth.  We like spicier foods, so I added some red pepper flakes to the boiling pot.  

I didn't want it to be too chunky so I mashed a little bit with a potato masher after boiling.  As someone else suggested, I added a pinch of thyme.  Also I used garlic salt instead of regular salt and I doubled the amount of cheese.
Turned out great!

Great soup with a couple changes..Saute veggies in olive oil and 2 cloves of garlic before you add water (chix broth is better.) Run the solids through the food processor or blender after you add the cheese.  Delicious!

Like many others, I didn't follow the recipe due to taste and "what do I actually have in the house now"? My differences were I used chicken bouillon broth, as I reflexively drained the boiled vegetables. Also, I used habanero jack cheese. YEESSSS!!! I highly recommend that "adjustment"!

Delicious! I tripled this recipe and it still came out perfectly. The only thing I would comment on, is if doubling or tripling, you will need to double/triple each cooking time. And I noticed this needs a lot of salt and pepper, but when you get the seasoning right, it's delicious.

To my surprise, my whole family loved this soup.  However, my husband made it once and didn't chop the veggies up small and the kids wouldn't eat it.  After reading some other reviews, I left out the butter to make it a little healthier.  We didn't miss it all all.  I also used chicken broth instead of water, used a little extra onion and added some fresh minced garlic.

Yum!!! This was just what I was looking for.  I made exactly as instructed except I cooked the vegetables in chicken broth.  Also, I took about 2/3 of the vegetables and blended them until smooth and the soup had only some small pieces of vegetables in  a puree soup.  Very good!!

Not bad, but for a good flavor I use half chicken and half beef broth, little of vegeta spice and fresh parsley. As for a milk, I use 2/3 and the rest I used water. Also, I fried onion before adding to a pot. I made a huge pot, so I did everything x6. I like to freeze leftovers and have it for another day, so I don't have to cook when I'm too busy having fun with my kids.

I wanted to give this 5 but couldn't because I tweaked it.  I used beef broth for water, doubled the cauliflower and no potato.  I also added about 2 1/2 strips of bacon, cooked and diced.  Also, 3 slices american/jalapeno cheese in addition to cheddar.  Added diced green onions at end when serving, no onion at beginning.  Big hit with both teenage sons!!

Yum!  Used broth instead of water and omitted potato as suggested by others.  Skipped the butter and flour and just used a hand blender to puree about half of the soup.  Also used up a chunk of Velveeta with this.  Will make again!

This was a fantastic dish.  We served it with pierogies on Christmas Eve, the whole family loved it.  I did make a few changes: used vegitable broth instead of water, doubled the cauliflower and doubled the cheese.  I will definitely be making this one again!

Very good flavor. It tried to cook this in a crock pot (with whole pieces of veggies) and it ended up seperating and looking nasty. So, I pureed the whole batch to make it look edible. Then it was very tasty.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  Basically, if you like vegetables with cheese sauce, that's what this is...  I think this would be a very forgiving recipe where you could add many kinds of veggies and it would still be yummy.

Following other reviews, I used chicken broth instead of water and I pureed the veggies in the blender before stirring them into the roux. Delicious, filling, not too fattening.

This was a great soup, I gave it 5 stars even though I made a few changes.  Mostly healthwise, much less butter and less cheese.  It was still wonderfully tasty.  Thanks!

Excellent, creamy, tasty soup. My favorite comfort soup! I use celery salt instead of actual celery, since I never use celery if I buy it. Other than that I use the recipe as it's written. Super tasty on a cold day with a bit of home-baked bread!

This soup has potential, but doesn't quite live up to it. Despite using  chicken bullion cube and being generous with the spices, it was still very bland. And the milk/water ratio seemed off, it was too heavy. The family seemed to like it, but I'm going to keep looking for a good cauliflower soup,

This was terrific w/a few changes.  I cooked the cauliflower and potato in chicken broth until tender but lumpy.  Separetely I cooked the celery, carrots and one pkg Lipton onion soup mix.  After tender I put through my blender to make smooth.  It didn't need any additional salt w/the Lipton soup mix.  I did add a dash of nutmeg and added Tostitos medium cheese dip.  Yummy.

Excellent...... I trippled this recipe (I never know how many I'm feeding). I had to use a shallot I had no onions. It ended up to be only four of use eating. It was gone......gone.

My family really enjoyed this comforting soup.  I added a chicken boullion cube to the water and veggies.  I also used 7 slices of Kraft american cheese instead of cheddar chz.  Make sure to season with salt and pepper otherwise it could be pretty bland.

Excellent! My only comment is about the cheese...I'm from Wisconsin, so I felt the need to add about a half cup more cheese to make it cheesy enough for my tastes...if you want it cheesy, plan on adding more. Otherwise delicious!

This recipe was delicious. We made only two changes - using vegetable broth in place of water and omitting the celery. The veggies were tender and creamy and the 5 year aged cheddar we used gave it a great flavor. I'd definitely make this again!

Ok...so I doctored it up (I find everyone has a little of their own flare to jazz it up) and I listened to some of the tips : I doubled the cheese, used chicken and veggie broth instead of just water (added a 1/4 cup white wine) and more veggies and presto!  It's a yummy comfort food for those rainy days or cold winter nights :)

This is a wonderful soup. I have made it several times. I followed the recipe exactly the first time and liked it. To get a more chowder-like consistancy I lighty mash half the veggies after cooking.

If I could give this a 'tip' of one star, I would. The only terrible receipe I've come across in the multitude of recipes on this website. The name is deceiving, as Cauliflower Cheese soup this is NOT. Bland, even with making adjustments. Tasted more like flour based chunk chowder than anything else. Do not waste your time.

I ate so much soup... altered the servings to 6 and it worked out perfectly. Husband ate seconds but kids wouldn't touch it. More for us... Really really good. We will have this again, just put veggies in blender instead of chopping all by hand, not much work.

Awesome recipe--followed others lead and substituted chicken stock for water, and WAAAAYYYY more cheese.  Also subbed broccoli for Cauliflower and cut out the celery.  Tasted great--just like the stuff we used to get at a restaurant where I went to college!  Throw a little bacon on top for garnish--dirty it up a little.

This soup is delicious! I added more cauliflower, and some broccoli, and used lowfat chicken broth instead of water. Also, 2% milk. I'm afraid that I added too much cheese though, although that's what made it taste so good. It was a little bland, so I added some hot sauce and some crushed red pepper. My husband also loved this soup and he's a tough critic.

Use vegetable broth instead of water.  Celery is optional.

excellent! I did add a tag more cheese, cooked the veggies longer and then blended them a bit with a hand blender.  Perfect for a winter, snowy day! Thanks for the recipe!

Just a little bland for my tastes. I agree that using chicken broth in place of water would add flavor.  I think I  will make it again with additional spices.

well, i was not too impressed with the soup made by this recipe, but added 1 t garlic salt and much better! got a little thick on me so i believe i added another 1/2 c milk so it seemed more like a soup vs a cheese sauce.

I don’t know if I did anything wrong but I followed directions to a T. This is more of a vegetable milk based soup, not cauliflower. The amount of cauliflower was minimal.

I always replace water with chicken broth in soup recipes - and I did that here. Also, once the soup was all together I added chicken boullion until it was at the flavor level I wanted. This. Soup. Rocks.

Delicious!  Great flavour of cauliflower and cheese.  The reviews have lots of good suggestions, but most aren't necessary.  In my second make,  I sautéed the onions and celery and doubled the cauliflower and omitted the potatoes because I needed to use up some cauliflower.

I probably would have given this 4 stars but the baby liked it so that's enough to boost it up an extra star for me!  He has been very picky lately so this must have been good :)  I blended it with the hand blender until there was still a little texture but no big chunks.  I think I liked it better that way than I would have if I hadn't blended it.  It was very easy to prepare so that is another big plus.

Pretty good. I made 3 times the amount because I had a whole head of cauliflower to use up. So 1 head of cauliflower, 5 carrots, 5 to 6 small russets, 1 onion, 4 stalks celery. I also added bacon and doubled the cheese. It was a bit scary when adding the milk to the flour and butter as it got very thick at first. However, it thins out after all the milk is added. I am fairly happy with the end result; however, it could use more seasoning of some kind. Next time, I'll try it with chicken stock instead of water and add garlic as some other reviews suggest.

I am a 15 year old vegetarian. It is very hard to find good soup recipes,  being vegetarian and all, but this soup recipe is by far my favorite yet! As a vegetarian we all know that most of our meals will not be as tasteful as meat-eaters, but given the circumstances this soup is wonderful tasting. You can not judge this soup based off of the soupy flavor. You have to eat the vegetables with the soup and it taste amazing!! I did add garlic salt to my vegetables when i was boiling it with water. The taste is wonderful! Thank you for this splended recipe! Well deserved 5/5 rating!

Besides healthiness, this base recipe doesn't really have much in terms of flavor. I even followed suggestions on chicken stock and garlic, but it just wasn't very tastful.

Great base recipe! From the recipe ingredients, I gathered that it didn't have a lot of seasoning going on for it. I added garlic salt to the veggies during the boil and a little chopped fresh sage and parsley and a sprinkling of crushed red pepper flakes just before taking it off boil. I also added about half a cup more potato for the family members who are kind of "meh" on cauliflower.

It came out really delicious, but I also love that I can play around with different seasonings on it. Very creamy and filling!

This was actually the first homemade soup I've ever made. I did use chicken stock, I also had to use gluten-free flour, and lactose-free milk. And it still turned out wonderfully! Love it! Thank you so much for the recipe!

Great base recipe. While bland on its own, with 1 cup fat free half and half, liquid smoke, cup of sharp cheddar, cup of low fat sour cream, and 4 cubes chicken buillion.....oh and pepper, onion powder  garlic powder..... 2 potatoes made it creamy without more added fat.....I boiled the veggies i  the broth until mushy then blended smooth. Then i added the creamy stuff and extra flavor....after I doctored it I gave it 4, and when my veggie hating daughter scarfed it down I decided to rate my version a 5!

I sauted the onions, garlic, celery and carrots first.  I also had a leek so I stuck that in too.  Then I added the rest of the veggies and I used chicken broth.  I am not going to make the roux next time because of the faint "pasty" taste it took on.  We all really liked the soup though.  So next time:  Puree after all the veggies are soft with the hand blender, then add some milk and half/half plus seasonings.  That should bump it up to 5 stars.  1/12/16
I made it again with no roux and wow, you really don't need the extra calories from the butter and flour.  It is 5 stars now!

This recipe was excellent after a few changes.  I doubled the recipe, but halved the milk and replaced it with vegetable broth. I also added a teaspoon of Italian seasoning and a dash of garlic powder.  At the end of cooking, before adding the cheese (sharp cheddar), I pureed part of the soup with an immersion blender.  I added salt and white paper to balance the flavors as needed.

I made this exactly as shown, except I used vegetable broth instead of water.  It was fantastic!    It took a while to chop the vegetables and thicken the milk, but well worth the time spent.

Didn't add any potatoes, just doubled up on the cauliflower.  You could get away with a little less  milk. Delicious flavor! Thanks so much for sharing!

This soup came out great! Following the reviewers' advice, I did make lots of changes to enhance the flavor. For starters, I also added chopped broccoli with the cauliflower and used chicken stock instead of water. I omitted the celery and carrot while including an herb bundle of rosemary and thyme with scallions instead of onion. I cooked up lots of cripsy bacon beforehand  and added that in after the soup cooked for 20mins and let it sit a little. Before adding the roux, I used a hand blender to make the soup a little creamer like split pea soup; leaving some chunks for texture. I also added a lot more cheese.  Top with fresh chopped scallions and this soup has quickly become a fave of me and my family!!

Have never made cauliflower cheese soup before so I was happy to make this recipe.  I used chicken broth instead of water, but I think I used too much.  I didn't have potatoes or celery and it still tasted great!

It was good, though a little bland. I took the suggestion of cutting down on the milk to 2 cups for that reason. It's a comfort food and I loved the texture of the veggies. However, the flour overpowered it all. I suggest using half as much or even less. It'll still come out creamy; just let it simmer with the milk a little more.

This was a delicious way to use up leftover steamed cauliflower and cheese sauce. I added a pinch of cayenne and tsp of cumin for my own taste. I sauteed the onion, celery and carrot, then simmered with the potatoes in vegetable broth instead of water. I warmed the leftover cheese sauce to the same temp, then gradually added the cooked veggie mixture and broth. Added the already cooked cauliflower near the end. I used an immersion blender for a few seconds at the end.

As is, I think this is a 3 star soup. It is significantly bland and is missing some necessary acidity. I was able to pull it up from a 3 star to nearly 5 stars by substituting the water for veggie broth as other raters suggested and then adding to the mix 1-2 TBS of vinegar, a half a cap full of lemon juice, 1tsp of garlic powder, and about 1/8tsp to 1/4tsp of cayenne pepper. I then served it with some egg knot rolls and garnished it with chopped scallions. YUMMY!!

This is a delicious, hearty soup! Turns out so rich even using skim or 1% milk. Very easy to make too. I used more cauliflower and potatoes than the recipe called for so I boiled them with much more water than the recipe states. When they were tender I ladled most of the water out and kept it aside. I added the milk mixture and added the reserved water until it was the consistency I wanted.  Delicious!!

Excellent Soup! I blended the ingredients in a blender and it gave it a beautiful smooth consistency. I forgot to add the celery though and chose not to add the cheese. It needed lots of salt and pepper. Next time I will add some chicken broth to give it a bit more flavour.

This was a really wonderful soup. I made enough to feed a small army and took some suggestions of other reviewers as one can rarely have TOO much flavour, right? When I made the roux and the cheese sauce I added garlic and followed the same ingredients I use when making a rich cheese sauce to pour over veggies. Worcestershire sauce and mustard powder, bay leaves, and 'Season All' (souped up salt ;) ) gave it a nice kick. I also did half cauliflower and half broccoli because that's what I wanted to use. My friend brought roasted garlic bread and crusty French and we filled up a big bowl with cubes of bread for dipping in the soup. I could eat this all winter. Thanks!

This recipe turned out great for me w/the modifications from other reviews. I used chicken broth instead of water, omitted the potatoes & celery (did not even miss them), used 1 1/2 cups of cauliflower, half an onion, and doubled the cheese (definitely needed). I also only used 2 cups of milk (subbed FF half & half for 1 cup of it) and added 2 minced garlic cloves. Other modifications included sautéing the garlic, onions, & butter before adding it to the veggies and using my Vitamix to blend everything a little more. The only change I would make next time is definitely cut down on the butter! There's no need for 1/4 cup.

I made some alterations to the recipe by using my nutri bullet.  Instead of using water, I juiced some lettuce and cooked all the vegetables in the lettuce "water".  After the vegetables were cooked, I returned them to the juicer and pureed them.  Add the milk, flour butter, and cheese mixture, stirred together added Mrs. Dash and a little seasalt to finish.

This is an okay base recipe. I used 4 cups in total of cauliflower in place of any vegetables. I also used 2 cups of milk and 1 cup of broth as other reviewers suggested. I also used 4 cloves of garlic, 1 cup feta cheese, and smoked paprika to garnish. It came out sooo good! There were no left overs. Next time I may reduce feta, top with sour cream, and some bacon bits!

I found a fantastic price on cauliflower this week so I bought two heads. I will certainly be buying it more often after trying this recipe for the first time. I cooked 2 full heads together after removing the green and the core. I simmered them doen till thdy were very tender. I then added sea salt, black pepper, onion, fresh garlic, chicken stock gells 4) some thyme, parsley etc.this came out fantastic! And I made almost a stockpot full. It is soooo good!

Comforting and delicious. Easy to make your own variation. This time I also added broccoli, turkey bacon, cheddar & gruyere, and instead of sea salt, a couple dashes of Herbamare (check it out if you don't have it in your spice cabinet!). I doubled the recipe too because leftovers are even tastier!

I wasn't disappointed, but it was ok, just ok.  Maybe I need more flavor in my recipes -it's a constant challenge.  I doubled the recipe, added about a cup more cheese, one of the comments about the carrots is correct, it colors the entire dish-but cute for Thanksgiving. Also pureed half the vegs and chopped the rest - that gives it good texture.  Garlic and more salt kicked it in a bit.  And I also added more califlower bits for more texture and crunch.

I made this exactly as written, except that I subbed homemade stock for the water and I pureed the soup after I added the veggies back into the milk mixture (before adding the cheese).  I thought it was very tasty and my husband liked it with a little hot sauce on top.  My two year old liked it okay, and amazingly, my 4 yr old confirmed veggie-hater actually ate a few bites of it!  I used all fresh local organic veggies from our CSA and it was very good and made for a quick dinner.  I will most likely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I *love* this soup - it is now officially my favourite cauliflower cheddar recipe! I swapped out the water for veggie stock but stuck to the rest of the recipe.  Put all veggies through the food processor so they were chopped into wee bits.

Perfect texture - something that can be hard to get right with cauliflower soup. However, I added quite a bit more in terms of flavour - two minced cloves of garlic, which I sautéed with the onion at the beginning; and I added fresh thyme and sage from the garden when I simmered the vegetables, as well as a little hot sauce.

I made this for dinner yesterday, and it was a huge hit! I would have given it five stars, except for the fact that the seasoning was WAY off--without a few modifications, this would have been very bland (but this is a great starter recipe, as long as you taste and season as you go).
We didn't have cauliflower, so I used a package of frozen vegetables in a steam bag (including broccoli, lima beans, carrots, and celery), steamed it in the microwave, and added it to the soup with the cheese.
I increased the amount of cheese to include a mixture of Sharp Cheddar:Monterey Jack at a ratio of 2:3. The Monterey Jack REALLY made the recipe! 
I subbed in chicken stock for the water, and boiled some frozen hashbrown cube-cut potatoes and frozen onion, which I then added to the roux, along with the steamed veggies and cheese.
The whole recipe took less than a half hour to make, and still tasted like a full, flavorful soup that had been simmering all day! I did have to add massive amounts of kosher salt, some garlic and onion powder, and a dash of oregano and terragon in order to round out the flavor profile.
The carrots gave the soup a beautiful hint of color, and the lima beans added a nice textural contrast. It was a lovely soup! Thanks so much for such a great starter to a cheese soup!!!

Use chicken broth instead of water (a whole can) use sharp cheese, a little garlic, no potato and more cauliflower. Run it thru food processor.

I just made this recipe and OMG how good.  I didn't have carrots, so I added a can of them at the end of cooking the vegetables.  I also used 1 Tblsp of chicken base in the water for added flavor as someone suggested.  I emulsified the vegetables but left it kind of chunky, then pour the sauce over the vegetables.  Only had Velveeta on hand so I used that.  I don't like to change recipes, but that is all I had on hand and my cauliflower was starting to look bad.  I don't like giving 5 stars with add-ins, but I don't think I hurt this recipe by using canned carrots. Very Very Very good - will make this again and again.  Thanks for the great recipe.  It really does make alot.  Got pretty thick as it cooled, so will use milk to thin it when I reheat tomorrow for lunch.

I wasn't sure about making this, but so glad I did.  This soup is sooo sooo good!  My husband, 18 month old & In-laws all loved it.  Its a keeper.  I didn't have celery or carrots on hand, but the soup still turned out great without.  I doubled the cheese, which i'd definitely recommend. I also added a dash of garlic powder. Yum!

Excellent, easy soup.  I also used 1 lg onion, 3 carrots, 3 potatoes, 3 stalks celery, 3 cloves garlic, minced, and 3 chicken bouillon cubes. I utilized 1 1/2 c. milk and 1 1/2 c. half-and-half.  I had good results sauteeing the onion and garlic first until translucent and then adding to the pot, which I had added an additional 1/2 c. water as well as the bouillon cubes.  I also used an immersion blender to puree the vegetables and then added the cheese as well as good amounts of salt and pepper.  It had a thick, chowder-like consistency and was a huge winner both immediately as well as leftover.  A must-have for your winter soup arsenal!

This is great soup! I was skeptical at first but upon tasting I found it to be very filling and quite tasty! I did add 5 cloves of garlic minced, I used a full large onion, 3 large carrots, 3 medium potatoes, 2 large shallots sauteed in the butter, and I exchanged the water for chicken broth. I also used corn starch in place of the flour and swapped on cup of the milk for light cream.

I made this twice, once with potatoes and once without. It came out too rich with the potatoes, next time I will leave them out. I puree this soup lightly in a food processor before adding the cheese and serve with warm bread.

We all know how hard can be to get veggies in kids but this did the trick.  My boys and husband really liked it.  I used already seasoned potato pearls instead of cubed and just omitted the salt.  Also, I used Mozzarella cheese because that's what I had.  Sooo good.  Monterey Jack would work nicely as well. Not sure I'd want to try Cheddar.  As one of my boys suggested, I might add peas next time or maybe corn.  I doubled the recipe to make it a full meal all by itself (for family of 6.  Very filling.  Will make this again.

Very tasty...left out the potatoes, and doubled up on cauliflower and carrots to compensate. I also used chicken broth to give it a little more flavor instead of the water, and used only 2 cups of milk, instead of 3. I also added more cheddar since we love cheese. Word to the wise (I am a beginner cook), DO finely chop your celery because if you only dice it like I did, you will have to cook the soup longer, even if the rest of the veggies are soft. All in all, a yummy soup!

Solid recipe.    I like a lot of flavor so I did add 3 minced garlic cloves.  I also used chicken broth.  Toward the end I thought it needed even more spice.  This is a very mild soup.

This was really very good.  My meat n' potatoes boyfriend liked it even better than I did!  I feel like it's missing something, but I can't put my finger on just what it is.  I added some fresh garlic and some salt & pepper but other than that I didn't make any changes and it turned out good.

Followed SLJ6's advice.  More chicken broth, less milk.  More cheese, whole head cauli, more veggies.  Thyme.  Blend in blender to make real smooth.  YUM!

The soup was very good! My brother really loved it. He ate it all (after I had a small bowl) The soup went to a blender for a smooth texture. :) Will make it again!

I made this for dinner last night. I pureed the whole thing and wouldn't let my husband or daughter in the kitchen while I was cooking it. My husband who hates cauliflower had 2 bowels before I told him what was in it. Loved it Thanks!

This soup was fantastic! Almost restaurant style.  The only alteration I made was using 1 cup of chicken broth vs. the water.  I also added the salt (sea) and pepper with the boiling vegetables, and added dried parsley.  Excellent recipe!

This was pretty good. I made it exactly as written, and I actually wasn't that impressed with the soup the first bowl I had. I thought it was just okay and wasn't planning on making it again. Well, the next day I decided give it another try and reheat some while taking the advice of some of the other reviewers (to puree some or all of the soup). So I added a very small amount of milk to a hand blender to the soup and pureed it, and I liked it MUCH better this way. For some reason, it made a HUGE difference whether or not to leave it "chunky" or puree it.

I really liked this recipe as a starting point; after making it exactly as written I give it three stars.  However, before eating it I tweaked it to push it up for five stars.  Like some other reviewers, I found it bland.  I added garlic powder, onion powder, a little cayenne pepper, and more cheese.  I think it would be even better if one subbed a cup of chicken stock for one of the cups of milk, and threw some garlic in with the veggies.

As written this is a 3 star. As others have mentioned it needs some flavor. I tried making adjustments and it improved it remarkably. Instead of salt I used vegetarian bouillon cubes. I added some garlic and doubled the vegetables. I used skim milk and substituted olive oil for half the butter. I was trying to make this a bit healthier. With the changes it was a 4-5 star if you like creamy soups. In the end, I decided I am just not fond of creamy soups, so will not make this again. Others will likely enjoy it very much.

Loved it! Since I was in the mood for green onions I added two...mmmm! I can see that this might be even better with double cauliflower and no potatoes. Every bite with cauliflower was a delight.

Easy, fast and super tasty. I just added more cheese since I looove the cheesy taste. I make huge pots and send it to my Mom who is a cauilflower cheese soup fanatic. Now she wont eat it at any resturant. She says this is the best. Great on those cold winter nights.

Pretty good soup. I definitley went by the reviews...I used veg stock instead of water. I also boosted up the veggies with broccoli, spinach, jalapeno pepper (we like heat) and garlic. I omitted the celery. I doubled the cheese too. It turned out great. This will be keeper!

I have to admit, this was pretty good! the only reason this recipe is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was a bit bland and I had to add more spices then just salt and pepper. I think nex time I make it, I'll use chicken or vegetable stock to cook the veggies like some other reviewers did. All in all a pretty good recipe!

This was great! I just made it to get me through a cold night.  The only modifications were to mash the vegetables a little before combining with the milk.  I also doubled the cheese and served with fresh parsley.  I'll definitely make again!

This soup is very tasty! I accidentally forgot the onion...which may be why I was slightly disappointed. I will definitely be making this again though! (I found this recipe only made enough for 2 adults, so if you're cooking for a group make a little extra)

I agree, it was good, but I found it a bit bland, and the texture of the cheese totally changes when reheated, even on the stove.  I can see it being great for kids though who don't usually like overpowering flavors.

Yum! This was good.  My whole family liked it.  My husband said it was the best soup recipe yet.  The only thing I did different was to cook the veggies in 2 cup chicken broth and add only 2 cups milk (still 4 cups total)  This could be a good base for clam chowder.  Just add clams and some bacon.  Yum!!

Great soup for cold nights.  We followed the recipe closely and absolutely loved it.  We will definitely make it again.

This is really good.  My husband even liked it.  It's really good if you butter some french bread and put it in the oven to get crusty and then dip the bread in the soup.  Yum.

Overall, this recipe was good.  I think that next time I will make the vegetables a little bit bigger.  I added some garlic powder (about 2 tsp.) which made the soup really tasty.

A great recipe to start with, but needs some more flavor. I tried again with more cauliflower, a tsp of salt and nutmeg to give it more kick. Turned out ok.

Yummy soup.  My husband and I really liked this one.  I would cut the veggies bigger than suggested.  Also, watch the salt.  Mine turned out a little on the salty side.  I would use less than suggested at first.

Yum! I did alter this recipe quite a bit- the only veggies I used were cauliflower and broccoli, and adjusted the amounts to my taste. I did add more cheese- I don't think I would've liked it as much with the amount of cheese called for in the recipe. Will definitely make again.

Great soup. I don’t like celery so I substituted 1 chopped yellow bell pepper. It was great! I think red or green bell pepper would work as well. Also, I added spinach with excellent results as well. The potato in it was ok, but next time, instead of potato I might add broccoli.

I made this soup the other day; it was great.  The only things I changed was that I didn't add all the vegetable water, as I like thick soups!  I also added more cheese and more veggies.

Wonderful recipe!  It was so delicious, but when I made it today (the first time), it was rather time-consuming... I think it was just me though so don't let me deter you from it.  I decided to leave out the potatoes for fear that they would get too soggy, and my sister and I added more cornstarch (almost two tbsp) to it to compensate for the extra chicken broth we used.  (chicken broth was taken from previous reviews in place of water, and we found it worked very well.)  EVERYONE liked it.  My mom asked that I save the recipe.

I mae this soup last night. It was great. AAfter it was sone I transfered it to a slow cooker because my husband works 2nd shift. I kept the crock pot on warm and it was just right for him when he came home. I omited the carrots however only because I didn't have any in the house. It was still awesome.
