This recipe was really different, compared to any casserole I have made. It was almost like pasta and tacos mixed together. My favorite part of the recipe was actually the bison. I will definitely buy ground bison again. It cooks up quickly and has very little grease compared to other similar ground meats I have tried cooking. As far as the recipe, I followed it as is except I used low-sodium canned products, reduced fat dairy, and whole grain pasta I had leftover from another dish. I found the recipe requires 3 cups cooked (2 oz of dry pasta, equals 1 cup cooked). On the bake time I also had to reduce it by almost 10 minutes, so it did not dry out. Lastly, I blended the sauce after trying it. It looked and tasted too much like just sour cream with some green onions and cilantro mixed in. I added the sauce ingredients to the blender along with juice from half the lime I had grated and a pinch of garlic salt. It turned out very well that way. ty

I made half a recipe of this which served us not only dinner but several lunches for me as well.  While it was tasty, it was mostly the result of my having added more spices to the pasta part.  The cream sauce was excellent!  I made mine using rice.  You can use any pasta or rice with this that you happen to have on hand.  I would make this recipe again, changing up the spices again.  Thanks!

This recipe is very good. I jazzed up the cream sauce (which I made with parsley instead of cilantro for personal preference) with a bit of lime juice and some cumin, but I think everything was pretty fantastic. I made the casserole more mild to share with the kids, but I think it would be even better kicked up to full spice. A very easy, very satisfying meal.

This was my first time eating Bison.  I served this to my guests tonight and everyone liked it. We all agreed that the dish was better with regular sour cream instead of the Cilantro-Lime Cream though.  I made this according to the directions except that I doubled the spices and added Salt and pepper at the end.  Next time, I will mix cheese into the mixture as well as on the top.  Although it wasn't dry, I would have liked a little bit more moisture. Perhaps I would have saut√©d some chopped onion, in a little EVOO and add that into the mixture.  But that is just personal preference.
All in all, I think this was a nice meal and the bison was very good. It's a little time consuming to make which would make me want to make this more on the weekends or an occasional weeknight when there's time. Although I think that it could be easily prepped in advance. 
This is worth making. Try the Bison as it had a nice flavor and texture.  I liked the dark, cooked meat,it has a nicer color than ground beef has. 
I served this with a green salad, corn on the cobb, cornbread, and a mixed fruit salad
The leftovers would make a nice lunch on the following day. I will make this again.

Great tasty and easy recipe! I used spaghetti squash instead of penne pasta and greek yogurt instead of sour cream to make it healthier. The spaghetti squash added some time to the recipe, but it still was so easy! Just put the spaghetti squash in the microwave for a couple minutes, cut it in half and baked the halves for 30 min until I could use a fork to pull the spaghetti squash apart like pasta. Everyone loved it!

this was really good, really simple and delicious. I put the cream off to the side just in case I didn't like it. It was surprisingly really good. Only thing I might have changed was the amount of beans. I would have only used a half of a can but I'm also not a bean person. Other than it was delicious!

I used all organic ingredients plus used chickpea penne pasta for added nutrition.  This has become a regular used recipe at our house and a favorite.

My family and i really enjoyed this meal! I'm definitely making it again. I made mine with kidney beans instead of black beans.

Following the suggestion of one reviewer, I made mine with rice instead of pasta. Rice seems more fitting with the Mexican flavors. I put it in the oven for only  15 min, plus the five after the cheese and tortillas.
