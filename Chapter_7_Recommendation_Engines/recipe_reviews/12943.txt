Yum! I added some kielbasa and caraway to the soup and that really made the flavor. Without those additions, I think it would have just been sauerkraut in broth. I followed the rest of the recipe except I skipped the flour and butter roux, but this soup is still plenty thick without it. In fact, I had to had an extra quart of water.

Loved this!  It is great on a cold day like today.  The flavor reminds me a little bit of the hot and sour soup you get in a Chinese restaurant.  This makes a ton so I froze portions for later.  I would make this again - very inexpensive to make.  Thanks!

Great recipe! Nice to have one that is vegetarian. (all the other ones I've seen for sauerkraut soup seem to contain meat!) Simple and good. I used rice in place of barley and sauteed FRESH mushrooms with the onion in butter instead of using dried mushrooms. Other than that, i followed the recipe as is... I really like this. It's a keeper and will make again. Thanks for posting.

For one jar of sauerkraut with juice I would use extra juice from a second bag/ jar. Makes soup taste more tart.
You can also  add as much mushrooms as you like. I trippled the ammount. I also added about 4 cloves of garlic into onion mixture.
Enjoy!

This was ridiculously good.  All of the tart flavors mellow upon cooking and blend to create a buttery-ish flavor (i.e. in the French onion soup family).  I will definitely make this again.

I am loving this soup.  Very velvety tasting.  Perfect for a dreary fall day watching football.  Love the way the mushroom-onion-sauerkraut flavors meld.  No changes to the recipe necessary.  Wonderful original taste.

Fantastic! I was looking for a 'veggie' alternative to the traditional New Year's pork and sauerkraut and this is definately it! I ended up adding an extra quart of water and it was still plenty thick. I didn't have dried mushrooms so I added 2 TB of mushroom boulion base to the soup and then sauteed fresh mushrooms with the onions. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm surprised, but I did find this too tart.  I will rinse the kraut next time and likely also add a bit of plain green cabbage to mellow it out.
I also found that I was missing a bit of a smokey flavour.  I would consider adding some bacon or something similar.

My grandpa used to make this soup every Christmas Eve. When he passed away I decided I would take up the task, but I had no idea how to make it. Many other recipes include kielbasa or some other sausage, but his was always meatless. So this recipe is perfect and I use it every year.

This soup was okay. I know many people who fancy Eastern European ethnic foods and would be delighted with this, but it was kind of weird for my family.  Too much sodium, and the the fat can be cut in half. I probably won't make this again, but if I did I would add more mushrooms, fresh cabbage, and caraway seeds.  I think sliced bratwurst or a smoked sausage would be an excellent additon. This recipe makes more than 6 servings.

I am so happy that I found this recipe!!! It was very close if not the same in taste as the one my Polish grandma made for Christmas Eve dinner. I loved the using the dried mushrooms (that was different than Grandma). And I used lima beans instead of the barley because that is what Grandma used. I think next time(already made twice since Christmas Eve) I will add additional mushrooms. Thank you for this recipe most I found were made with meat. I needed one vegetarian in nature so this was perfect.

This is very similar to the soup that we serve on Christmas Eve.  We add potatos and yellow lentils and do not add barley.  Very similar flavor.

I definitely did not expect to like this, but the flavors do mellow quite a bit... Still a little too "kraut-y" for me, but my parents and a Polish friend loved it.

Party of 5 enjoyed this soup poured over fresh pierogi and a spoon of sour cream. Very easy to make. Made the soup the night before so next day barley had absorbed alot of the liquid. I added a cup of beef broth and the soup had a great texture - creamy and smooth. The flavour of the dried mushrooms came through - wonderful taste/memories of dinner at Grandmas.

Not for the faint of heart. I've never had sauerkraut soup before and figured I'd give it a shot. Wow. It's good. But wow. First, I used sauteed fresh mushrooms like one of the other reviewers suggested but other than that I stuck to the recipe. I used Boar's Head sauerkraut.  I'm going to get some thick crusty bread, put a thick slice in the bottom of the bowl, and the soup on top of it to cut the sour. I love sauerkraut but I grew up eating with stuff so having it on it's own like this is a little bit of a shock but the soup is really good.

Need a bit of brown sugar...caraway seeds and bread dumplings using pretzel rolls as the bread..then it's a full vegetarian meal! Thickens best with cornstarch slurry instead of flour. I put in fresh sautéed mushrooms instead of dried too

This recipe made a large quantity of soup.  It made much more than six servings.  My husband and I did not care for it at all, thus have lots left over.  Will drain it and eat the sauerkraut.

I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious this sauerkraut soup is!  I made it for the first time today (a cool crisp October day). Loved the tang of the sauerkraut, and the earthy-ness of the mushrooms as well as the sweet richness of the onions sauteed in butter!   I did add 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes because someone stated it reminded them of Chinese hot sour soup.   The soup was smooth and silky from the barley.  It is quite filling as well.  This will be a regular in our fall and winter soup meal rotation.  Thanks for the very tastey recipe with simple everyday ingredients.

Didn't really care for it.  Was too sauer tasting.  Would be good thickened over mashed potatoes or with more meat..maybe boneless pork chops.  Disappointed.  Very thin liquid.  I thickened using lots of cornstarch....it was better but wouldn't do it again.
