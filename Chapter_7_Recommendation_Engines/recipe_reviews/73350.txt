really lovely dish, could be prepared with chicken or veggies for vegetarians. the one bit i didn't like was having to dirty so many pans. next time, i would just throw the refried beans in with the cooked rice and mix those together instead of using a separate pan to heat up the beans.

These were good. I think the best part was the Chipolte sauce. 
Long version-make the original recipe. Long short recipe-buy some spanish/mexcian rice, sautee the shrimp in garlic and make the Chipolte sauce. SHORT version-Make burritoes your way but make the Chipolte sauce.  I would also add more cumin if you do cook the onions.

Knowing I needed to save some calories for a Cinco De Mayo margarita, I set about to lower the fat/calorie count of these burritos. I used Sargento reduced fat 4 cheese Mexican shredded cheese, fat free refried beans, and fat free yogurt in the sauce.  I used brown rice, using a little more liquid and extra tomatoes, and whole wheat tortillas to make them even healthier.  Even with these modifications, they were great.  I used uncooked frozen shrimp that I sauteed briefly with the garlic and, as we were putting them together, we decided the salsa was overkill, and skipped it. I would make these for a Mexican themed gathering, without a doubt!

I have been searching for a recipe for Shrimp Burritos from Rubios restaurant. Love those! This is a reasonable substitute. I used sour cream instead of the yogurt/mayo mix; hubby and I enjoyed the spicy kick of the chipotle peppers but had to tone down the mixture for my kids. Also used the Best Spanish Rice recipe from this site in place of the version shown here, only because that is my tried and true spanish rice recipe. These burritos were very enjoyable and I would make them again.

My husband and I really enjoyed these! Nice spicy kick. I used whole black beans instead of refried, and sour cream instead of yogurt, which I didn't have on hand. Will def. make again.

Amazing! I halved this recipe and threw it all together last minute with frozen shrimp I thawed out while warming everything up. Adding pepper and garlic salt to the refried beans was a stroke of genius and now I'm using this mix all the time. I highly recommend this. You don't have to be exact - it will still come out great. Thanks for the recipe!

Too much work for a burrito, I didn't have a clean pan left! I tried to be economical and use baby shrimp, bad idea! Didn't really care for the chipolte sauce, I like chipolte but the combination of mayo and yogurt was bad for me. I think I would switch to chicken and add the chipolte to ranch and it would be great.

This is a wonderfully delicious homemade mexican meal!  
Thank you for the recipe! If you think you don't have enough time, then prep the chipotle sauce and refried beans in advance then refrigerate them this will save time. Or just ask your spouse to help. Mine did! My husband doesn't like refried beans but I just added less and the rest of the ingredients made up for it. The chipotle sauce gives it a nice kick. I wouldn't change a thing.
Definitely will make this over and over again.

This was very good. I've never used chipotle peppers before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. As I don't have a food processor, I just chopped the peppers as finely as I could with a knife. I only used two peppers out of the can, so I looked up other recipes that use them so I don't waste them. I'm trying Emily's Chipotle Chili. Will also use the leftover tomatoes in it-you only use about 1/4 of the can.  I was surprised by how spicy the sauce was. (FYI, the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce are found in a can in the Mexican food section of the grocery store-one smaller stores I went to and a Wal-Mart did not carry them. The rice was good. I only had minute rice, so I just didn't cook it quite as long as called for. Just kept an eye on it and turned it off after about 10 minutes and let it sit covered. Added beans and spices to the cooked rice as suggested by another reviewer. I'd like to try the Spanish rice suggested by another reviewer sometime. I waited until the LAST minute to warm the shrimp-since they are already cooked, it is easy to over-warm them and make them tough. It only takes a couple of minutes in the skillet. (C shaped is cooked, O shaped is overdone.) So, I would do this again, just maybe chopping the peppers even finer so you don't get any bigger chunks in a bite since they are so spicy. Good flavor though, just have to be careful. Finally, I measured 1/2 cup of shrimp into each burrito and only had enough for 3 1/2, though I could have spread it between 6.

A  bit of work (spanish rice from scratch) but oohhhh so yummy. Rave reviews from the whole family.  Only problem was not enough shrimp!  Next time will use a bigger bag (or eat less while cooking!) Also, be sure to get burrito sized tortillia vs "soft taco" otherwise you have well, shrimp tacos!  Even the leftover rice and beans made for yummy leftovers.  The sauce is yum too!  A little tip since the peppers come in a can of more than two... take them and freeze them two to a snack bag. Then thaw them and use!

A nice change from the usual burritos.  We had enough for two meals and the second time we had the rice and beans as side dishes which we both preferred.  The burritos are very full otherwise.  We also used flour tortillas the first night and preferred them with corn the second night.  Thanks for sharing!

This was the best burrito I've ever made!  My kids and husband loved it.  My teenage son said I should open a taco stand and sell these-guess he doesn't see a difference between tacos and burritos :)
My only additions were some cilantro to the rice after it was cooked, and a lime squeezed over the shrimp after they were cooked too.
I will make these again.  Lots.

Used a lot of dishes, but it was worth it! Loved these burritos! I marinated the shrimp overnight in a quick, thrown together marinade with Worcestershire, lime juice and Old Bay.

Delicious dish!  Got rave reviews from everyone that tried this dish.  Making again tomorrow night.  Will be doing both chicken and shrimp this time.  The chipotle sauce was great.  Couldn't find any chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, so just used chipotle seasoning and still turned out wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe--even by making healthier substitutions-whole wheat tortillas, brown rice, and nonfat plain yogurt it was great.  The only thing I would change would be to not add garlic salt at every step because it is salty enough.  I also added a little bit of shredded lettuce at the end to top it off.  It will be made again in my home!

They were good, but, the mayo/yoghurt mixture was not so good, and without it, the burrito was dry tasting, so I don't know what would have worked instead, maybe I'll do sour cream instead next time? That's if my husband will even eat them next time I make them after trying these one's.

Definitely a keeper! My changes were as follows. Used black beans instead of refried, and also added diced mild green peppers to the beans and then simmered. For the rice, I used a wild rice and white rice mixture. Gave it a nice presentation and texture. Topped it off with cilantro and Pico de Gallo. Enjoy!

Something was missing in the burrito and there is way too much salt in this recipe... Other than that, it was pretty good.

Super Delicious!!! The chipotle sauce is very basic but it's good. I used instant rice so once that was cooked I just added the can of drained diced tomatoes with green chiles. I sauteed the chopped onion with the shrimp and seasoned the shrimp with a homemade zesty seasoning. Very good and very filling, kind of like a meal in one with the rice and beans right inside the burrito!

These are delicious!  Everyone agreed - the sauce is what makes these extra good.  The second time I made these I used black beans instead of refried and I added them to the cooked rice and tomatoes.  We preferred it this way and it was one less dirty pan!  And that yummy sauce - we'll use it on other sandwiches, tacos and wraps.

This is quite good!  For you cilantro lovers out there, adding a few teaspoons of chopped cilantro to the yogurt sauce added a delicious twist.  And I think sour cream could be an easy substitute for the yogurt/mayo combo that would taste just as good. Great recipe!

I like this recipe. I've made it several times. I especially like the rice. I usually cook the shrimp ahead of time by bringing some water to a boil then turning off the pot and then throwing the shrimp in for about 5-7 minutes and then continue to saute them in the garlic as the recipe calls for. Also- I have not made the sauce but instead usually use spicy ranch which works great! I also skip out on the salsa when I don't have it.

Awesome!  I didn't have refried beans so used a can of black beans instead.  I don't think I'd switch next time, seems like refriend would make them too heavy.  The Chipotle Sauce is sooooo good.

Like cookin'mama, I used brown basmati rice, fat-free beans & low fat yogurt but I used white tortillas. I used low-sodium chicken broth & minced garlic instead of garlic salt. (in both the rice & beans) I heated my beans up in teh microwave & skipped the step where I put "the shrimp in a bowl & add garlic"...I just tossed both in the skillet. Make sure the  heat on your skillet is hot enough to quickly burn off the residual water in the shrimp. I thought mine was but it wasn't & my shrimp were a little overcooked before the water was even gone (& they had been draineing for an half an hour). All I had was grated swiss so I went w/ that...sure wish I had had a more flavorful cheddar. I garnished w/ chopped cilantro & serverd it w/ margaritas, watermelon fire & ice salsa & chips (from this site) & Southwestern Summer Salad. Thansk for the recipe!

My wife and I loved the recipe.  I used chicken for myself and shrimp for her.  Instead of  the pureed chipotle peppers in adobe sause I bought adobe sauece and seasoned it with cipotle pepper seasoning to my taste using salt and garlic.  We will make this again...excellant flavors!

One of the best burritos I've had! I only made two small changes to the recipe. Instead of diced tomatoes I used lime/cilantro Rotel, and where it calls for garlic salt I used Adobo with pepper. The sauce definitely brings the whole thing together. Excellent!

Love this recipe.  The flavors are outstanding.  The rice and beans taste really good with the spices that are added.  I also as other reviewers suggested, used sour cream rather than mayo and yogurt for the chipotle sause. really good! I did not have enough tortillas so i decided to serve this on a plate placing the rice on bottom then beans, shrimp a layer of cheese and topped it with the chipotle sause.  thanks for the recipe.  Will use the rice recipe as my new rice recipe, full of flavor!!

I made these tonight and they were a big hit with the hubby and sons!  I didn't have any cumin, so I substituted 1/2 tsp. chili powder + 1/4 tsp. smoky paprika.  I think it worked, because it turned out delicious!  I also forgot to buy plain yogurt so I just used sour cream.  Tasted perfect!  These burritos are a little bit of work, but well worth the effort!!

They were very good.  I didn't realize so much would be going on at once, so for not the most experienced cook in the world like me I did sort of burn the rice, but still, everything tasted good!

IF you only put in 1/2 tsp. of garlic salt in the rice and 1/4 tsp. in the refried beans and use langostino (crawfish) instead of shrimp, this is an excellent recipe that I will make over and over and over.....again!  The sauce is heavenly!

These were pretty tasty. The only change I made to the main recipe was to use small amounts of actual garlic instead of garlic salt to cut the sodium. When serving, I added cilantro and lime juice. Added a great flavor to it. Next time, I think I will use a little more shrimp, but only little.

We were not impressed with these.  The cheese didn't go well with the flavor of the shrimp and they had a funny aftertaste (Probably from the sauce).

This recipe is so good!  The shrimp is really simple to make and the sauce is SO good!  My boyfriend and I kept adding more sauce onto burritos- we couldn't get enough!  I added more chipotle puree than the recipe called for until it got enough kick to my liking and used low fat yogurt.  We didn't have any cheese on hand and it didn't need it.  Will def make again

I made this recipe a couple months ago and the family loved it so much we decided to have it for Christmas dinner this year.  The chipotle sauce is so flavorful it's hard to stop eating it.  I am so glad I decided to try this recipe as it is so full of flavor, it truly is addicting.  I've been a member for a couple years & this is the only review I've written.  That is how much I love this recipe.  Kudos!

These were good, but I dont think I would make all the mess for burritos again.   I did as another reviewer suggested and added the beans directly to the spanish rice rather than make another dish.  (We did enjoy the refried beans mixed with the spanish rice on our tortillas as leftovers since my husband polished off the leftover shrimp right away)   I tried making the sauce both ways as some people just made it with sour cream instead of the mayo/yogurt mix my whole family said they were both good but the sour cream was a little smoother.  (They still ate the mayo/yogurt mix one too) But really in all honestly, this was essentially, refried beans, spanish rice, shrimp and chipotle sauce on tortillas.  No magic here.

These were great!  I used corn tortillas instead of flour and added a slice of avocado on the side to cool down the heat of the adobo sauce.  I also grilled the shrimp instead to cut down on the fat.

The chipotle  flavoring is awesome in this. This recipe would be good with chicken and beef too!  I added in some sliced bell peppers when I sauteed the shrimp. Next time, I think I will saute some onion with the bell peppers to give it that "fajita" burrito taste.

This was good but oddly enough, I did not think the shrimp added much. I could have left them out entirely and enjoyed it just as much. I might, next time.

Overall, my family thought the recipe was alright, not exciting.  But the rice and sauce were outstanding, and good to keep and use again.  In fact, we kept the leftovers and mixed them with ground turkey and sausage to make enchiladas - the additions made them the best ever. We also mixed in some sour cream and chicken broth with the refried beans, makes it creamier.  To increase the "wow" factor for the recipe as is, it might benefit from battered cod instead of shrimp, and turn them into tacos with some shredded cabbage or iceberg. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!  I prepped things a couple hours ahead.  Right before serving I filled the tortillas, topped with a little extra sauce and salsa and microwaved to warm up.  Will definitely make again!!!

Sorry, but these were pretty bad.  I made the recipe exactly as presented, with all the ingredients that were listed.  Besides all the pans, which another reviewer mentioned, I just couldn't get past the taste of refried beans and shrimp!  The rice was good, there was way to much garlic salt for the beans. They only need perhaps half as much.  I think I would have rather had a shrimp taco instead of this.  It was just way over the top.  My husband only ate half of his! Sorry :(

Loved it! Just a few changes though like using sour cream instead of yogurt, used black beans frioles instead of refried, and grilled shrimps.

This was really good. But the chipotle sauce was very spicy! I'll use half the peppers next time. Also I made it with fat free sour cream and low fat mayo.

These burritos were some work but were a big hit by all. We all agreed that these are the best burritos we have ever had.

The chipolte-adobo sauce was absolutely divine and I will certainly use it again. The rest: so-so. A lot of work and dirty dishes for what you get back.

i LOVED the sauce recipe and modified with sour cream because i hate mayonnaise and it MADE the dish ! i sauteed the shrimp with oil, garlic, bell peppers, chili powder, cumin, salt and pepper (the shrimp and garlic just seemed too bland) and it came out amazingggggg. will definitely make again and i'm not even the hugest fan of chipotle ! you should definitely try it -- you can buy a can of chipotle in adobo for under $2 and it gives the sour cream that extra kick. delicioussssss !  p.s. i usually stay true to recipes but this was the only shrimp burrito recipe on here so i had to modify it. sorry !!

this has become one of my all-time favorite recipes. it's so simple and delicious. it's a great change from the usual chicken or beef. i add just a touch of lime juice to the shrimp and garlic mix when i cook it and i also add a touch more of the chipotle/adobo to the yogurt/mayo. LOVE THIS DISH- THANKS SO MUCH!!

It was okay...the chipotle sauce was great...I was expecting the shrimp to have more flavor but your flavor comes from all the parts to your burrito: rice, beans, chipotle sauce.  Nice break from chicken.  Good but not amazing.

Good - My husband said it was pretty good.  Not what I was expecting.  BUT I didn't mess with the mayo and yogurt mixture and just used sour cream.  It was alright but I am going to keep looking for a recipe that I want to keep making over and over.

Just made this tonight. Wow, that Chipotle sauce is fantastic.I totally agree with the poster who said" make your own style of burrito if you want but make this sauce to go with it".I'm so averse to hot spices, I don't even pepper my eggs.;o) but this never got uncomfortly hot.Just deliciously smoky with a Jalapeno taste but not heat? It might've been because I used the adobo sauce instead of the actual Jalapeno but it came out great.Kudos on this sauce, Shackl. All the other components were good but the sauce was the boss!!!!

Oh, yes! This was delish! The only things I have to say about this meal are that I would personally add a little less oil to the rice, a little less garlic salt to the beans, and add a 1/2 - 1 tsp more of the chipolte adobo puree to the mayo and yogurt. I expect that beef or chicken can be substituted for the shrimp and it will still be marvelous. Oh, and I used a roasted garlic salsa (not chunky - ew).

These were so yummy! I nixed the beans (hate any bean but green beans) and the cumin (didn't have any) and used sour cream instead of yogurt. I will be making these again. Thank you!

The best part is the sauce!  I made it super spicy by adding 3x the amount of required pepper puree.  Afterwards, I had a bunch left over, and I used it on egg and cheese burritos, nachos, etc.  Yum!

I don't generally have good luck cooking with shrimp, so I switched from shrimp to chicken with these burritos and it worked well.  For the garlic salt, I substituted 1/2tsp of it with granulated garlic and I used low-fat yogurt for the chipotle sauce.  Made everything else as written.  Served with Garden Tomato Salsa from this website.  Thanks for the recipe, Shackl!

Really lovely!  I changed it to shrimp tacos, used a pound of fresh Gulf shrimp, and subbed lowfat sour cream for the mayo and yogurt, and reduced fat monterrey jack for the cheddar.  I also used local "southwest" tortillas which are a little spicy.  Definitely a do-over!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was so good.  To simplify things, I made rice in the microwave, added salsa to it, and then cooked it in a frying pan for a few minutes to crisp it up.  It saved a lot of time.

I first made this for a party last fall and it was an amazing hit.  The flavors combined to make a surprisingly complex dish.  Now when I am invited to parties I am asked to make my shrimp burritos.  I would really recommend that everyone try this recipe.

Really a very, very good recipe.  I'm not as fond of the chipotle sauce as all of the other reviewers, but still "liked" it, just didn't love it.  Went over well with the family and is definitely a "keeper" recipe, thanks!

Not too bad....the sauce was a lot spicier than I thought it would be though.  I really didn't anticipate it being too hot, so I added some green chilies to it.  Very spicy, but good.

Really Good. Not as time consuming as it looks. While the rice is cooking you can prepare the other ingredients. The only thing that confuses me is the tomatoes. Are they drained or undrained? I drain them a little bit. Also I have made a few little changes. I add a spoon of canned chopped green chiles to the rice, Used homemade refried beans, raw shrimp fried in a little oil with the garlic. Also I don't use the salsa. The sauce makes it the best. Thanks for sharing ShackL

Was not really sure, but we really enjoyed it.  I did however use lowfat everything just to cut fat and calories where I could.  I loved the sauce, used fat free yogurt and reduced fat mayo.  I did add a little more of the chipolte peppers.  Will make this again and would probably try fresh shrimp and grill them. Not a fan of frozen shrimp

These were excellent.  I added black beans to the rice to save a few steps.  I used sour cream in place of the yogurt in the chipotle mayo. Very easy and very good blend of flavors.

Insanely great! One of my new favorite recipes - only difference I made was to add fresh cilantro to the rice and saute raw shrimp - not so chewy, but I love this recipe!

Wow! This was SOOOOO good!  I thought that the recipe was just perfect as is but my husband felt that maybe a little less mayo in the sauce would be good.

Wonderful!!! We're dieting around here, so I made this with brown rice - still cooked with tomatoes & broth, boiled the shrimp then mixed shrimp with rice. Used corn tortillas, fatfree yogurt, and low-fat olive oil mayo. The chipotle sauce still tasted very rich. Also, used fatfree refried beans. Kind of a lot of steps but so worth it. Making it again tonight for guests!

Yum! This may just have become one of my all-time favorite recipes (with a few substitutions). I don't like shrimp, so I grilled a chicken breast, shredded it, and added it to the tomato/onion mixture and let that cook a few minutes so the chicken would tenderize. I love the flavor of the refried beans - what a great idea to add garlic powder and black pepper directly to the beans. Genius! I also included some chopped romaine lettuce for the burrito assembly. No need for extra salsa. This burrito is flavored just right without it.

I absolutely loved this recipe!!  I used the full can of chicken broth and tomatoes since there was only a bit left after measuring.  Rice came out great.  I used frozen raw shrimp, thawed them and removed the tails, then sauteed them with the fresh garlic. The sauce was perfect!!  I'm reheating everything for lunch today... I can't wait!!  The only thing that I might add is cilantro but it really doesn't need it.

These were great.   I used chicken, but look forward to trying shrimp soon.  I added some green onions and avocado as well, but served the salsa on the side. Wrapped them up like a burrito and covered the rest in foil to eat the next day.  They stored well.  Thank you.

I have a serious legume allergy ... so, I replaced the beans with cream corn.  I also used Knorr Spanish Rice.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  This was my Thanksgiving dinner.   It is terrific.  My wife decided she'd pass on the turkey and had one of the burritos.

I made a mess of my kitchen, but it was worth it! I added extra chipotle to the sauce and sprinkled garlic powder on the shrimp for extra flavor. Make sure you are ready to have bowls, pots, and pans. It's a great meal for not wanting to go out to eat. Add some extra freshness with lettuce, tomatoes, cilantro, etc.

I made this recipe for me and my fiancé and her two sons. The two boys don't eat much Mexican food, so I wasn't sure how this would play for them. Well, it was devoured. By everyone! No substitutions this time, but I decided to mix all finished ingredients together (except for the creamy chipotle sauce). Will definitely make again, maybe with brown rice!

I made this tonight and really loved it. Very simple but delicious. The chipotle mayo is very good and I typically dislike mayonnaise. I made mine with Greek yogurt and it turned out well.

Loved it. Didn't need nearly all that chipotle sauce. Maybe 1/3 of it. You could stop with the seasoned rice and make a delicious side out of that! I recommend cutting medium shrimp into fourths.

Holy moley, super good.  I used sour cream in place of the yogurt and mayo and had a little cilantro on top.  Next time a little less garlic salt in the beans (just too salty) and some diced tomato in the burrito.  Served with some pan cooked yellow squash and zucchini .

Delicious.  Like, really delicious.  I am going to attempt with using pre-made spanish rice to cut down on amount of dishes and work.  This one is so good though, I'd deal with the mess.

i am a horrible cook but these tasted like restaurant quality shrimp burritos. i did use the 'best spanish rice' recipe for the rice though. i love the chipotle sauce, i even added a bit more chipotle for more of that flavor, not spicy at all. I used mexican crema instead of mayo/yogurt. don't really need the cheese. at Rubios they don't add cheese and I was looking for that same taste in their shrimp burritos. thank you for this recipe.

I took great liberty with this recipe, mostly because that's just what I do.  Here's how I changed it:
1.  For the rice, I did not start with raw rice.  I always seem to have leftover cooked white rice in the house, so for this recipe I sauteed some chopped onion with the cumin, then added in about 1-1/2 cups of cooked rice.  I made sort of a "fried rice" out of this.  I omitted the tomato because I did not have any in the house.
2.  I substituted black beans for the refries just because I prefer them over refries.
3.  For the sauce, I used plain greek yogurt and sour cream instead of the mayo.  Seemed more authentic to me.  And I was very generous with the chipotles in sauce because we like our foods quite spicy.
4.  I assembled six burritos as outlined in the recipe but I lined them up in a cake pan and put it into the oven at 350 for about 45 minutes.  
5.  When I served the burritos, I offered more of the chipotle sour cream & yogurt sauce, more grated cheese, and some jarred salsa as toppings.
It was a hit!

Very well done. But at 866cal/serving I would not call it healthy. The Spanish rice is fantastic!  The sauce is fantastic! I would suggest eliminating the mayo from the sauce and adding so thinly sliced cabbage for a slightly healthier alternative.

Fantastic!!  They were worth all the dirty dishes!  I put in a whole 7oz can of the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (didn't realize until the next day that the recipe called for only 2 teaspoons....too many beers while cooking.)  My husband and I love spice, so we thought they were amazing and will be using the whole 7oz can again.  Other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  Delicious!

THESE ARE AWESOME! But here are a few suggestions: DON'T use so much mayo and yogurt. I only used 3 tablespoons of mayo and 2 tablespoons of yogurt and 3 tspns of chipotle/adobo sauce and that make PLENTY. Anymore and you will waste a lot of mayo/yogurt!!! I also suggest getting 12oz and additional 4oz of baby cooked/frozen shrimp! (extra shrimp makes a big difference!) and to use "Rosarita" - no fat traditional refried beans :) My entire family LOVED this! Almost as good as Rubios!

a little too much garlic salt/pepper in the bean mix for me and the overall sodium content in this is HUGE....salt in the broth since I used canned, quite a bit of garlic salt in both the rice and beans, sodium in the pre canned beans...persoanlly I would cut back the salt and pepper in the beans,but other than that I liked it.

Make your rice a day ahead and store in the fridge, gently  reheat in Chef Mike (micro). Also for easy assembly use Kraft Chipotle Aioli found in your store by the mayo.

I cooked up some black beans instead of using refried  beans, and I made soft corn tacos, because they are gluten free,  instead of burritos. No other changes.  A couple of tips to make it all a bit easier: just purée the yogurt and mayo along with the chipotle peppers in adobo... which mixes the sauce and purées the peppers in 1 step. And no need to get a bowl dirty to mix the shrimp and garlic, just put them both in the pan and stir while sautéing the shrimp.

Increased the amount of chipotle peppers in the sauce for more of a kick. Of course, increasing the amount of garlic is mandatory.  This recipe was absolutely delicious.  My daughter and her friend loved it.

I should start by saying that any recipe that makes me do this many steps usually isn't a keeper for me.  But this one was soooooo good that I will definitely make it again!  In fact, I'm making it for my Mother in Law who is the Queen of the Kitchen.  It's one of the few recipes that I feel like can measure up to her!

This was ok. Next time I'll add some more spices to it. The tacos are better I thought with some cilantro and jalapenos.

Loved how this came out.  Every flavor mixed well in each bite. The only substitution we made was for the yogurt/mayo sauce. Being in a little of a pinch we used Taco Bell's Chipotle  Mayo which we found at our local store. It worked great!  Would/will make again.

Excellent recipe.  Most definitely restaurant quality!  I made minor adjustments. I substituted  sour cream for the yogurt and used bagged rice (because some how I can never cook rice right -unless it is in a bag!!).  This now MY recipe that I will try with other meats like chicken and beef.  A big THANK YOU for sharing!!!!!

YUM! I'm going to have to make this again next week because I know my boyfriend will LOVE it. Very, very good. The only down side is I had to add about a cup more of water for the rice. But not a big deal at all! My whole family loved.

These were great! Really unique flavor. Used black beans and did as others suggested and just mixed beans and spices with rice mixture. Used whole wheat tortillas and pan fried them after they were rolled up to get a nice crispy shell. Will be making these again.

The idea of a shrimp burrito sounded wonderful, as I love...fish tacos. So in that seafood mood, I made these in my 80 degree kitchen tonight. I used Oregon's cocktail cooked shrimp, as they aren't farm-raised w/ antibiotics. I put half a red and yellow bell pepper in with the onion when I sauteed it. I forgot to add the spice to the rice, but it was still flavorful. The 1/2 tsp black pepper and 3/4 tsp. garlic salt was way too much for 16 oz. of refried beans...cough. I'd half them next time. The sauce was okay, but I don't care for the mayo taste. Maybe just sour cream or plain yogurt w/ some of the chipotle peppers and adobo sauce...or not, and some lime squeezed on it. Maybe some cilantro like someone else used, also. Great basic recipe.

I made these burritos without the beans and enjoyed them tremendously. They are just like the burritos down the street at the local Mexican restaurant.  I used half a small can of chipotle chili peppers in adobo sauce and mixed them with plain greek yogurt and lowfat mayonnaise. I defrosted frozen shrimp and sautéed them in a frying pan with a little garlic...I melted the cheese on the tortilla by microwaving it for about 15 seconds before applying the other ingredients.  I did not omit the salsa on the burritos as others did.  Great recipe....

Found this a little bland. Sautéed the shrimp (fresh) in garlic and oil and omitted the beans. Next time I will add more spices to the rice mixture.

Not a fan, it made a huge mess, took forever, and I didn't really like the flavors. I had a hard time getting the rice to soften, which may have been the plan since they had me brown the rice for a full 5 mins. I cooked it for an hour and it was still crunchy. The chipotle sauce was way too spicy for me and the refried beans were too salty. Maybe add garlic powder not garlic salt to everything?

Pretty good! While I really enjoyed this, I wish I would have viewed the "how to" video first. The video instructions do not even come CLOSE to SHACKL's instructions. The layering order and layering quantities of each ingredient are completely different. I was disappointed that I was short on shrimp and a TON of rice, beans and chipotle sauce left over. I thought I must have done something wrong, so I decided to watch the video. After doing so, it all made sense (but I shouldn't have to watch a video first in order to find this out, IMHO). You are to SMEAR 1/4 c. of beans over your warmed tortilla FIRST, then top that with 1/2 c. of cheese (not 1/4 as directed), 1/4 c. of shrimp (not 1/2 c.), a 1/4 cup of rice and a dollop of sauce. There is no mention of adding salsa to the burrito itself. I added salsa to mine and wish I wouldn't have.... Reserve your salsa for the side! If you use fresh salsa as I did, It will make your burrito watery and M-E-S-S-Y! If you must add salsa to your burrito, strain it very well! Other than this mishap, I REALLY enjoyed these and found the combination of flavors to be SPOT on. My hubs even commented that the rice would be fantastic on its own and I thought the chipotle spread was absolutely superb, albeit a tad bland (I had to add a touch more chipotle to mine). Chips and guacamole rounded out our casual meal. All in all, these are darned good - just watch the video first lol! Thanks for sharing your unique recipe, SHACKL! :-)

I did a lot of tweaks but used the original as a base. I cooked the rice as written in the original recipe. I cooked the shrimp with garlic powder, a dash of garlic salt, and 12 oz of corn. No beans, no sauce, no salsa. Just put rice, shredded cheese, corn, and shrimp in a tortilla and wrapped that sucker up. It served its purpose and it seemed much faster than it would have been if Id gone with the original recipe, though I'll have to try it as written some time, too.

this is a pretty tasty burrito but it is kind of a lot of steps for a burrito. i realized while i was making the rice/tomato mixture that it was spanish rice and i had a quick make box in my pantry i should have used up. i probably would have been less upset if i had saved that time. but still, it was pretty delicious.

I needed a last minute recipe and I knew we had shrimp at home. I didn't have everything to make this recipe and it still turned out delicious! I didn't have the cumin or the chicken broth, so I used garlic powder and after simmering the onions for a little bit, I added the tomatoes so it would have more time to make more flavors. Added the rice and let it cook down and did the shrimp as said. No beans and no sauce - I didn't have the ingredients. Added the cheese and some sour cream - so tasty!
