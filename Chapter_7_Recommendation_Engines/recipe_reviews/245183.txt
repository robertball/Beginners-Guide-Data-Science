I made these for a soiree in my condo, my first time meeting my new neighbours. I was very excited to attend this party, but I never went, as these Salmon Pinwheels were so delicious I did not want to share them. I ate them all!

I have to admit, I went to the store and forgot the spinach! But, I really wanted to rate this because I wanted guidance. I didn't want to waste the beautiful smoked salmon I got. Since I couldn't go back to the store, I chopped green onions (that's what I had, ok). Everything else I had. This was very good, and was inhaled! 4 thumbs up! I will do it with spinach someday; it also sounds good!

Fantastic! I tried to make these myself but way overdid the filling and they just fell apart. These have the perfect proportions!

I doubled the recipe and took these to Thanksgiving dinner. They were a big hit.  I will definitely make these again.

Very easy to make. I made it exactly as the recipe said and my family loved it. I think this is a new easy option for potlucks.

Everyone loved it and it was easy to make. I made it last week for quests and they liked it so much that I’m making again this week for another group.  I usually make changes to recipes but this one I followed the exact ingredients and measurements and turned out great.

This might now be our new roll up recipe. Hubby liked it that much. I did add a little Greek yogurt to make it easier to mix and spread. One batch I chopped the peppers but won’t do that again.

Very good, I didn't adjust anything.  I wasn't  really sure about rolling it and would probably try chopping the red peppers next time, but was a big hit at the party.
