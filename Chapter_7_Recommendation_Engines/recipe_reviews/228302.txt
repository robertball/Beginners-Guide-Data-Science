This is one of our favorite quick treats. I almost always double the recipe. This also works with any kind of chocolate chips you have OR butterscotch chips instead of peanut butter chips. EXCELLENT recipe for beginning cooks/little hands who want to make something in the kitchen.

I never tried this exact variation, but I followed the recipe as written with the exception of using milk chocolate in place of semisweet. Turned out great!

I changed chips to butterscotch chips and omitted peanuts and added 1 cup extra chow-mein noodles due to peanut allergies. Also, I melted chips in microwave, 2 minutes on high seemed just right. I would stop and stir after 1 minute and then every 30 seconds. They almost got to stiff so be careful!

These were a staple on my mom's Christmas cookie platters growing up! Now I usually make them w/ my son and nephews and we decorate them w/ holiday colored sprinkles...they get a huge kick out of it. We even sometimes will make them for Halloween, decorate them and call them spiders. Super simple, but delicious treat, and one that the kids love to help make (and eat)! :)

I love this recipe, I made this awhile ago because it was too hot to put the oven on to make anything, therefore this was great....I put them in the fridge to harden so that I don't have to eat too many!!!

We have loved these for 3 generations- only we use butterscotch chips instead of peanut butter, and Spanish peanuts instead of regular dry-roasted...and we call them "porcupines". Since we live in a colder climate, we can store them outside and save space in the fridge/freezer!

These are really good! I'm a big fan of peanut clusters and the addition of the crunchy chow mein noodles is great! I would probably leave out the peanut butter next time (chocolate doesnt get hard).  Maybe add some cashews?

These were always on our Christmas cookie tray when I was growing up.  We made both the butterscotch and semi sweet flavors. We always called them "haystacks ". 
Around the holidays it is sometimes hard to find chow mien noodles at our area stores. I figure everyone must be making haystacks.

Yummy!  I was out of peanut butter chips so used half the amount of crunchy peanut butter and they turned out great!

Amazing.  I didn't have peanut butter chips so I used a cup of peanut butter.  Next time I will use less but the taste is amazing.  A real hit.

In all truthfulness I did not eat any of the cookies. They were for my hubby whose mother used to make them for him ( she has been gone almost 40 years) I made two changes I used semi sweet chocolate chips and butterscotch chips and I used cashews instead of peanuts. He was very happy to have these cookies again and said they tasted as good as he remembered.

My mom always made these growing up, it's now a staple at our Christmas desert table.  I only ever knew them to be made with rice crispies...we also use butterscotch chips instead of peanut butter.  They are quick and always the first to go!

I doubled this right off the bat. My family is not crazy about peanuts so instead of 2 cups I used a cup and a half and an extra half cup of noodles. Next time I may omit the peanuts or substitute something else. I did not use the microwave shortcut to melt the chips and it set up just fine. Even after coming back to room temperature after the refrigeration time, they were perfect-no problems with the chocolate getting melty. This will be added to my Christmas baking repertoire. It's nice to have a great recipe for something unique!

Great, easy, recipe.  The chocolate and PB flavor along with the crispiness of the chow mein noodles, make these a crowd pleaser.  I didn't change a thing.
