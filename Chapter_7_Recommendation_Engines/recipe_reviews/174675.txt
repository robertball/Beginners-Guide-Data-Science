This was really good.  My husband and I both loved it, and I didn't change a thing other than not using red pepper.  I do think it would be better to add the Italian seasoning to the meat while cooking next time, but otherwise I will keep things the same :)

This turned out ok but it was kind of a waste of ground lamb (you couldn't taste that it was lamb at all. Next time, I'll stick with ground beef). The only changes I made were to stir the Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes into the meat mixture, and I also added a little ricotta cheese that needed using up. This was a quick and hearty meal on a chilly evening. Thanks!

This was a good ziti recipe.  We had some ground lamb given to us by a friend and I couldn't figure out what to do with it.  Since this ziti recipe was similar to my own, I figured I'd give it a shot.  My husband and kids enjoyed this.
