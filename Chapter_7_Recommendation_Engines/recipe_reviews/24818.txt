This is a must if you have guests who don't like the typical potato salad.  This is tangy and robust and has tons of flavor!  I ended up using roasted red peppers from a jar (fresh REALLY expensive and these were great - Vigo brand).  I also sliced up a vidalia onion and roasted it along with the potatoes.  Everyone loved this and requested the recipe!  Thanks for sharing, Holly!

I love this recipe as written, but I also played with it a bit.  I added a few cups of steamed, tender-crisp green beans and, like another reviewer, roasted a diced sweet onion with the potatoes.  Yum!

Excellent recipe.  I have made a couple of times now.  I did reduce the amount of oil and don't think it negatively effected the taste at all.  I also used jared red peppers rather than roasting them fresh.

Amazing recipe! Thank you. I was looking for a non-mayo potato salad, I made it exactly as written and it came out delicious.

everyone loves this recipe! i used 2/3c lite italian dressing (my husband doesn't like balsamic and the dressing had the spices and red peppers in it already) and roasted garlic from the jar. we both hate regular potato salad so this is the ONLY one we serve at our cookouts.

Wow WoW WOW...and this dish was way easy...I did two differences here though...instead of the peppers being done in the oven I actually put them out on the BBQ to be ready around the same time the potato's were ready...Also I used new potato's instead of the red potato's (as those were looking right back at me) and I minced the garlic and had them roast on top of the potato's...OMG it was amazing...this dish was fabulous and I will definitely make this a side dish I'd regularly do in the future.

My husband and I LOVED this!! We ate it warm but I think it might be good cold too. The dressing is AWESOME! Will definitely be making this a part of our regular meal.

Great Stuff. Tried it for my wife and kids - and they loved it.  Can reduce the amount of oil. Will definitely make this for a party.

Really, really good!  We "auditioned" it tonight to see if we wanted to serve it at my big birthday bbq -- it made the cut.  Followed another's suggestions by adding onions and substituting jarred roasted red peppers.

I served this at a BBQ and everyone loved it. I don't like peppers so I left those out... but it was still great without. :)

Tasty, but I halved the amount of oil (both times) and the balsamic to make it a little lighter.

We really enjoyed this. 

I used jarred peppers but it would have been great with fresh as well. 
Instead of the heads of garlic- I used already peeled roasted cloves.

I didn't really change anything- this was a great dish and very different in a good way. :)

I didn't like it as much cold but my husband and kids did. I heated it back up and was great even the second day.
Thanks for sharing- I will definitely make this again.

I really liked this... left out peppers (although I think I would've liked them in hubby doesn't like them) and added green onions at the end. I had 2 servings and couldn't stop picking at them. If you like balsamic this is a great alternative to mayo based potato salad.

I really wish my kids had liked this better because I personally found this to be a delightful recipe for potatoe salad with ZIP and appeal. It made my mouth water just MAKING it... eating it was the reward. It doesn't taste as wonderful after it sits overnight but as far as it goes when FRESH... out of this world!

The flavor was wonderful. The only reason I didn't give it a full rating is because its kind of a pain to make.

Delicious!  I used 1/4 cup each vinegar and oil for the dressing and it was perfect.  I also used jarred peppers and fresh oregano from my garden.

Nice tangy flavor I mixed the oil balsamic and garlic in my food processor made the dressing nice and creamy. I served it with the kielbasa and Brussel sprout stir fry the paring was fantastic.

I thought this recipe would be good because I like all the ingredients, but it was surprisingly unpleasant. Potatoes swimming in too-sweet sauce. I may try this again with a german potato salad type dressing. Thanks for the roasted red pepper and garlic suggestion. Those turned out great.
