I can't say enough about this.  Boy is it good.  My twelve-year-old helped make most of this and she wants to take all the credit!

I thought this was a great side dish. I used Cool Whip as well and it was perfect. We loved it!

Easy and delicious. I used Cool Whip and it was just fine. Add chopped roasted pecans to make it even better. But don't skimp on the sugar or you might pucker too much.

I tried serving this as a side dish, but its really too sweet.  It would make a nice desert to supplement your regular holiday pies.  I don't think I'll be making it again, but it was very good.

I've been making this at Thanksgiving for years.  I make it the day before, use cupcake tins (with liners) and freeze.   Just pull out about an hour before the meal and it is defrosted enough to eat.  The cold is a nice contrast.  Very easy side dish.  My kids LOVE it and I generally can't get them to eat cranberries.

Made this for a pre-Thanksgiving pot luck for work. It was a hit! Sweet and tart, but not too much of either. It was super easy, too. I'll definitely make this again!

I haven't tried this variation, but I've been making it for 40 years with (a) no nuts, (b) no apples, and (c) raspberry jello (pre-chilled before mixing, and (d) drained crushed pineapple. 

I guess that's kind of a different recipe.    ;-)

I did not make this but a relative did. It is excellent if you like cranberries but I am still looking for something to take the sweet/tart edge off. Makes a great spread or you can just spoon it in your mouth.
