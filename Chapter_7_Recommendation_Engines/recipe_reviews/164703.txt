VERY GOOD. It has a slight egg flavor which I love. If you don't like eggs please don't try this recipe. I love this recipe and I make it several times in a week. Sprinkle some cinnamon on it before putting it in the oven, and you are good to go. Also, to make it low cal use just egg whites and less sugar.

I was not to happy with this.  It tasted like eggs with Rice Krispies on top.
