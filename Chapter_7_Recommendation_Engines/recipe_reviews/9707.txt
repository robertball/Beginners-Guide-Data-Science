I own a small bakery in Charleston SC.  I was looking for a pumpkin cookie and came across this recipe.  Did a test bake and was absolutely floored.  These cookies are amazing and now I can't keep them on the shelf.  After they have cooled I dip the entire top into a milk and powdered sugar glaze.  I allow that to dry overnight and this seals the moisture into the cookie.  Thanks for sharing this formula.

Reading other postings I decided to try and make half with craisins and half with fresh cranberrys to see which I liked better.  I'd definetely go with real cranberries - it's such an interesting, tangy taste that you don't get too often and the real cranberries look GORGEOUS in the cookies.  I felt the craisins got lost in the cookies and you didn't taste them as much.

Also, I did half a teaspoon of cinammon, half pumpkin pie spice.  And per someones recommendation I sprinkled cinammon on top of the cookies - nice touch.  I didn't have walnuts - used hazelnuts which were fine, but I'm betting walnuts would go better.  Sometimes you make pumpkin cookies and you don't taste the pumpkin - you do here.  You could even serve these along with your Thanksgiving meal instead of as a dessert if you were so inclined.

I made a double batch for card club on Saturday, and they were such a hit! I can't eat sugar, so I used 1 cup of Splenda instead of sugar. They were so moist and delicious that everyone asked for the recipe and took baggies of them home with them! Great as a sugar free food.

These cookies are attractive, moist and delicious -- the perfect fall cookie.  The fresh cranberries elevate the cookie to something truly different, perfectly tart.  I'd avoid Craisins -- they are neither as pretty, moist nor tart.  I sweetened the cookies and boosted the flavor with a 1/2 cup shredded coconut (if you don't like coconut, I'd add 1/4 cup of brown sugar) and added 1/8 tsp. of cloves and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  I also substituted pecans because I prefer the taste to walnuts.  I found there was no good substitute for the orange zest -- it adds a tremendous amount of flavor.   Lastly, I drizzled the cooled cookies with powdered sugar mixed with milk, vanilla and cinnamon.  Note that because much of the moistness of these cookies comes from pumpkin rather than butter or brown sugar, these cookies do not spread.  As a result, round balls of dough will yield puffed golfball/haystacks as noted by another reviewer.  To avoid this, when rotating my cookies at the halfway point of baking, I quickly flatten them down with a spatula (much easier than trying to flatten down sticky raw dough).  By the time they finish baking, they are nicely puffed but in the traditional round, flat shape of a cookie.

I didn't have an orange, so I substituted in grated ginger. I wish I could bottle the smell of this batter! Great cookies - can't keep my roommate off them!

This cookie is absolutely delicious!!!  It is everything it claims to be; light, fluffy, moist, and yummy.  I like that I can taste the flavors of both the pumpkin and cranberry in this recipe.  The sweetness is not overpowering, just enough.  I'm a cookie maker, and this will definitely be added to my list of "go to" cookies.  I did substitute whole wheat flour for the white flour (for health) and concentrated frozen OJ for the orange zest because I was too lazy to zest the orange. Also, I used my food chopper to chop the cranberries in batches.  Not only was this easier, but the cranberries were more even distributed throughout the cookie. Still YUMMY!!!  In the last 12 of the batch I added white morsels to trick my youngest daughter into eating them -- these were great too; still not too sweet.  I already told my mom she needs to make these too.

I love pumpkin. These were beautiful. Worth the work. I added a little bit more sugar the second time I made them. They are very moist, cake like cookie. Just perfect for the Holidays.

These are awesome!  I use half white flour and half whole wheat flour which I think makes them even better.  I also use dried orange-flavored cranberries (Craisins).  They're so moist and cakey - I don't like hard cookies.  The guys in my office always ask when I'm going to bring in more.

Extremely soft!  WARNING:  You may eat all the cookies yourself!  After I tasted the first cake-like puff of deliciousness I had to have another!  My first bite was mild and lightly pumpkiny and the next bite was fun and tartness with the dried cranberries I used.  I made my cookies with fresh flour, fresh pumpkin (not pureed-I still had teeny bits) and substituted allspice for the cinnamon.  I didn't have nuts but these are very yummy anyway and they look beautiful-they came out perfectly round and full!

This recipe is a real sleeper. The cookies don't look all that impressive, but WOW - what a flavor you can get with a few adjustments! I make a similar pumpkin cookie, and have always added halved cranberries. So when I found this one, I just had to try it to compare. I knew after reading the recipe that this one would be a little too bland to suit our tastes, so I added 2 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp cloves and increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp. Also added 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper to give a nice, warm glow. The counterpoint offered by the tang of the cranberries against the sweet spiciness of the cookie was absolutely outstanding! I substituted mashed, cooked sweet potato for the pumpkin, which I do frequently in recipes that call for pumpkin. I find the two vegetables are pretty much interchangeable, but I like using a fresh, newly-cooked vegetable rather than a canned one. The texture of these cookies is decidedly cake-like as others have noted, but we appreciated the soft, moist, spicy little pillows with a cup of tea. Also made a glaze using 1 Tb softened butter, 1-1/4 cup powdered sugar, 1/4 tsp cinnamon and enough orange juice to make it easily spreadable. I brushed it over the slightly warm cookies. The glaze dried with a festive sheen. Be sure to flatten slightly before baking, or they'll come out shaped like golf balls! Obviously, I had to do a lot of tinkering to get this recipe where I wanted it, hence the 4 stars. The additions I made, however, launched it easily into 5 star

These are the best fall cookies! We loved them! I was a little scared to make them because it seemed like people had to make a lot of adjustments to the recipe; however, I only made one and I thought they turned out great!! Here are some tips people may find helpful. 1.Make sure you grease your cookie sheet.2. Adjust your cooking time.I cooked mine 9mins in a gas stove.3.You have to flatten these cookies for the perfect shape. I used a tablespoon to spoon them out (which I sprayed with Pam, so they would just pop right out.The dough IS a little sticky).I then took the bottom of the tablespoon (mine is flat) and flattened them. I also formed them a little to get the circular shape. The adjustment I made was I added 1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice. Another thing I did, which is completely optional, was I added a orange juice-powdered sugar glaze.I used the juice from the orange I zested and added powdered sugar until it was the right consistency. Add this once they've cooled. I had one without the glaze and it was really good, but I think it's even better with the glaze. LOVED these!!I got 41 cookies out of the mix.

Great holiday cookies!  I had a Cookie Exchange on my birthday and shared these cookies with everyone.  They loved them as much as I did.  My husband also enjoys them since they are not overly sweet.  They are perfect with morning coffee and afternoon tea or as an 'in between' snack.  I didn't ice them until the following day since they get very moist in the storage container.  I read another review where their batch turned into a gooey mess overnight.  Not airing them appropriately and/or icing them prior to storage adds additional moisture so don't ice them until day 2 if you're not going to eat them right away.

I made this once as the recipe recommends and it was good.  I made it again with my own adjustments and it was 100x better.  first I used 1 1/2 cups of flour and 1 cup of old fashioned oats.  I more than doubled the cranberries and it could still have more to make it better.  I also tripled the orange rind.  I took 1 1/2 cups of pecans and crushed them into different sized chunks to add more texture and omitted the walnuts.  I increased the pumpkin to 1 1/2 cups and added a few dashes of pumpkin pie spice and a bit more cinnamon than called for.  finally, I added a generous handful of coconut.  Next time I will try substituting applesauce for the butter and possibly honey for the sugar to make these into a yummy on the go fall breakfast rather than a cookie.  Our whole family LOVED these with these adaptations.

These are fantstic!  I did tweak the recipe to make them a little healthier and lower in fat (incorporating whole wheat flour, using applesauce instead of butter, etc).  The results were outstanding.  They were very soft, cake-like and just wonderful.  I will definately make these again and again.

These cookies are amazing!  I love to bake with fresh cranberries, so I as excited to give this recipe a try - I was not disappointed. :)

I made a double batch - half with pecans, half without (I have several friends with nut allergies).  Based on some other reviews and some experience, I made the following tweaks: 

*used 1 15oz can of pumpkin puree for the double batch - it was just short of 2 cups, but it worked out fine
* added 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice
* used heaping tsps of cinnamon
* baked on parchment paper rather than a greased cookie sheet
* drizzled just a little glaze (powdered sugar, milk and cinnamon) on them
* baked at 350 for 10 min (my oven tends to run a bit hot)

I'll definitely be making these again.  Very good recipe!

I baked these cookies this morning. They were very good and even passed the test with my picky 3 year old.  They mix up beautifully and the only thing that I changed was the cranberries.  As others had mentioned, I didn't have fresh cranberries so I used the "Craisins" with an orange essence, they were awesome in the cookies.  The only reason I am not giving this a 5 star rating is that you have to take the extra time to flatten out the cookie.  I use a cookie dropper,(small ice cream scoop) so my 1st batch of cookies were like little round meatball looking cookies (do not spread on the cookie sheet).  Next batch I flatten with my fingers and baked.  Turn out GREAT! This is truly a taste of autumn.

Really soft, fluffy cookies! although lacking in the spice department. Wanted to try them EXACTLY as written - next time I will add more cinnamon and probably some allspice/cloves or just throw a tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice in, that would be good. I made a dozen cookies, then got a brainwave to make bars out of them. They are so soft and fluffy, almost cake-like that they turned out really good! I baked them for about 45 minutes though until toothpick inserted came out clean. Overall - a great cookie recipe for Thanksgiving!

Yummy! Cake-like but light.  I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and increased recipe by 1/2 which resulted in 52 cookies.  Be sure to grease your cookie sheets!

These are a fantastic cake like cookie, they also freeze well. I made them as is except I used sliced almonds in place of walnuts (not a walnut fan) and they turned oud so light and fluffy. I know some reveiwers used dried cranberries, but I think you are missing out if you don't use fresh. Now with that being said, I always make a batch just for me with some changes for dietary needs. First I sub the sugar with 1/2 cup splenda brown sugar blend,and I use 1 & 1/4cup AP flour and 1cup multigrain flour. I really like the multigrain flour in ths cookie, it gives it a wonderfull nutty flavor.

my friend made some pumpkin cookies and everyone said it was the best ever... obviously, they haven't tried these.  (a sugar glaze makes these cookies better.)

This cookie is great if you like pumpkin and you are looking for a cakey cookie.    I added fresh ginger, nutmeg, and a tiny bit of ground cloves in addition to the cinnamon.  I also soaked the dried cranberries in some orange liquor to soften them up.  I used a powdered sugar/milk icing drizzled on top.  
The first cookies I made, I used a small cookie scoop and they came out like little balls.  The next batch a gently pushed down to flatten the cookes with a spatula.

Mmmmm they certainly are soft and cakey! The tartness of cranberries goes so well with the moist pumpkin taste. I used a little less butter since I had to use canned pumpkin pie stuff which already had oil in it. I didn't have orange zest so used apple juice and left out the nuts. This could be a very adaptable recipe. I got exactly 36 good sized cookies. Thank you! :)

I'll start with my son's review -- "this tastes like pumpkin pie" -- and it does. Of course, I always add nutmeg and ginger to anything with pumpkin in it, and it worked for these cookies as well. For the taste of the cookies, I have no complaint, they pass the test! But I kept them covered for two days and the pumpkin is so moist it kind of makes these feel and look like dough balls. I made them Saturday to take into work Monday, and this morning (Monday) they have some bluish-green mold growing on them :( So, be warned, put them in the refrigerator if they're going to last more than two days! Also, the cookies will retain their shape while baking, so if you don't want malformed balls at the end of it, you may want to smoosh them down a little. All in all though, these are a tasty treat, and I will be making them again :)

What a FANTASTIC recipe. I added white chocolate chips instead of walnuts- and a can of pumpkin instead of just a cup. They are soft and tasty! Made a perfect giveaway to friends for Thanksgiving.

Because of the high ratings I chose this recipe as a bake sale item at work. I wanted something new and interesting, yet promising. I wasn't quite sure how the texture would be when I saw the review that it would be "cake-like" I was a little nervous. After baking my first batch, I tried a cookie and my was it delicious. I will be making these again in the future.

These would probably be called drop scones back in the UK and they were delicious. It was lovely to be able to actually taste the ingredients instead of having them masked by the typical mountain of sugar that I unfortunately come across all too often here in the states.

Yummy!  I used butter shortening instead of butter and they were super moist and fluffy.  I'm taking them to a cookie swap tomorrow and I couldn't be more proud.

Makes a stiff sticky mixture, you need heft to mix in the (extra!) cranberries and one cup whole walnuts.  Made no adjustment for 5000 ft altitude. Kept making bigger cookies as I went on, cooked them about 2 minutes longer, they didn't seem to mind. As others suggested, used pumpkin pie spice and ginger too. Used orange extract in placed of zest.  Wonderful cookies, thanks Lucy!

This recipe came out great. I even messed up and used only 1/4 cup of butter and they still came out great. I also added some ground allspice to them. I will definitely make them again.

Everyone at work loooovvves these cookies. In my experimental batch, the halved cranberries were too tart, so now I coarsely chop them in my food processor and stir in a bit of sweetener--perfect!  Just the right blend of tart and sweet and spicy.

These were a HUGE hit!  Sweet and tart, and quite good.  If you have a major sweet tooth, you may want to substitute dried cranberries.  But most will appreciate the sweet/tart combo of the pumpkin and cranberries.  My mother brought a batch of these in to work, and before lunchtime I had a call asking if there were any more!

These cookies were absolutely great, even my 2 year old devoured them! They were easy to make since I had leftover chopped cranberries from another recipe. Unlike some cookies, these aren't overly sweet or greasy. The texture is light and cakelike  which makes them addictive. All I had was a mandarin orange, which squished and fell apart rather than letting me grate the rind so I substituted a little orange juice for the orange rind. I left out the nuts. Thanks for a great recipe, it is definitely a keeper!

These cookies are great for the holidays! I don't care for cranberries or walnuts in my cookies so I added cinnamon chips instead and also a little more sugar than called for. Very tastey!

I liked the cookie, but my friends liked it more. I put too many cranberries in which for me was too much, but everyone else loved the extra cranberries. I think this recipe is very good but it's very subjective to taste.

I use this recipe with persimmon pulp in the fall in place of the pumpkin and it is AWESOME.  It's so hard to find good persimmon recipes and I tried this on a whim and it has gotten rave reviews from everyone.  I do use pecans instead of walnuts and add 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  I have tried it with both dried and fresh cranberries and it is definitely better with the fresh.

Wow, these are moist, soft, delicious cookies! After reading the reviews I did add extra cinnamon and a bit of cloves and nutmeg. The orange zest really enhances the flavor! These are not too sweet, so the various flavors really stand out -- pumpkin, fresh cranberries, walnuts, with the touch of cinnamon and orange zest. I ran a bake sale at my church today and these cookies were a big seller.  Thanks for a great, unique recipe.

Add 1/2 cup extra chopped fresh cranberries.  Make glaze: 1 tsp soft butter, 1 cup powdered sugar, cinnamon and orange juice for spreading consistancy.  Put on warm cookies.  Bake longer than 12 mins. or they will be mushy.

The flavoring was a bit bland so I added additional cinnamon, all spice and ground cloves and made a wonderful flavor.  I'm afraid the cranberries were a bit to tart and over powering to make this part of the cookie very good.  I will definately use again with raisins instead of cranberries.

These cookies are tasty when they first come out of the oven, but they become bland after a while and they are too too soft for my taste. They taste like a cake instead of a cookie. I like a little crunch to a cookie.

These were yummy!  The only change I made was to substitute white chocolate morsels for the walnuts. The only reason I'm giving them four stars instead of five is that they were a little too soft - very cakelike.  If anyone could help me make a chewier batch, I'd be very grateful!

Great recioe! I needed to get rid of some fresh cranberries I had and this recipe turned out perfect. I made it as stated but added some candied walnuts and almonds for extra sweetness. They're definitely cake-like in consistency.

These cookies are delicious and easy to bake. The orange zest does give the pumpkin more dimension, but if you had to do without it, I'm sure they'd still taste great.  The 2nd batch I made, I cut 1/4 cup of flour out of the mixture. This helped the cookies spread out more during baking. I baked them for 12 minutes and they still have that great soft texture.   Word of caution...If you use salted butter, omit the 1/2 teaspoon of salt called for. I used salted butter for both batches and accidentally added the 1/2 teaspoon for the first batch, and they are a TINY bit salty...they still taste great though.

Definitely a good, yet lighter cookie.  I froze half the recipe for later and they almost tasted better after freezing.

My husband and I didn't think these were really anything special, but other people thought they were the best ones out of the nine varieties I baked for Christmas cookies.  We thought they didn't have much flavor and weren't sweet enough, so I made a confectioner's sugar/orange juice glaze to put over them, which helped, but still wasn't enough.  It also helped to disguise the gross green color they turned out to be.  Maybe it was because I used frozen cranberries, but after diligently cutting them into quarters it was frustrating to mix the beautiful red berries with the lovely orange dough and get a puke-green mixture.  Next time I might try craisins or just toss the cranberries in the food processor.  Definitely I'll add more sugar.

In my opinion, these are too cakey to be cookies, but they are very good.  After my first batch as cookies, I changed to a mini muffin pan.  That lent itself better to the texture of the batter.  Since they were now muffins, I made a quick glaze of powdered sugar and milk and drizzled it over.  I would make them, again, that way.

Wow, were these good!  I found it easy to flatten slightly as I spooned them, which made for a prettier cookie.  I would definitely drizzle a glaze on top (mix 1 cup powdered sugar + 2 Tbl. milk).  Thanks for the recipe!

My kids absolutely love these. I've made them several times now, and the best way seems to be after I've made a few adjustments. (not because it's bad the original way, just because I try to use less sugar and fat.) I doubled this recipe, and used half sugar, and half splenda. I cut half the butter as well, and used applesauce in it's place. I didn't have fresh cranberries on hand, so instead I used dried. Rather than throwing them in as they were though, I soaked them in boiling water for about 5 minutes, so that they softened and puffed up. Then I drained them, and threw them in. I've done this before when baking other cookies that called for cranberries. It does a LOT for bringing out the flavour of the cranberries.  We also used lime once instead of lemon. Just as good:) This one is a keeper!

I LOVE these cookies.  I love anything pumpkin and the cranberry in these adds the perfect zing.  I have made them without the orange zest and I will try not to do that again - it really kicks up the flavor.  I have made them with dried cranberries and fresh choppped cranberries and the fresh ones make a huge difference.  Too bad my grocery store only stocks them seasonally, because I love these cookies all hear round.  I also like to make cookie dough and store it in the fridge so I only make a few a day and eat them fresh.  That is the best thing with these, because they are too moist to store well.  They just don't taste the same the next day.  Having said that, I could almost eat an entire recipe by myself.  I really hate when things are super sweet, which these aren't.

Thought these would be a bit weird. SOOOO delicious. Some of the best I have had in a while. Followed the recipe to a tee, no nuts though. Orange zest really gives it a little something.

so good! I forgot the orange zest but they're still completely yummy - I'm eating them right off the cookie sheet right now! keep in mind though that (unless I did something wrong) these don't spread out at all so it's best to roll them out smooth and squish a little rather than just dropping them off the spoon. they're just prettier that way!

I realized that I don't care for cake-like cookies.  I like my cookies to be chewy and a little crunchy.  I think I will change it to get the cookie I want.  I took them to work and only one person like them.

These were delicious.  I did not have orange zest so I used 1/4 tsp. orange extract. I also used pecans since I did not have walnuts and I added 1/4 tsp. each of ginger and nutmeg.  I used craisens since I usually find fresh cranberries too tart for my taste.  My husband loved these cookies because they were not overly sweet...he usually tells me I should cut the sugar down, but these were just right.

I kinda tweaked it to make it more like a cake-like cookie rather than a scone just b/c that's what I was looking for. I reduced the butter by half, added an extra egg, added 1/2 tsp pumpkin spice, and substituted orange juice for orange zest.  The result was a VERY cake-like, light, fluffy cookie (a little too cakey, so I overcompensated) but the taste is fantastic!!  This was my first time baking with fresh cranberries, & they are SO good.  I also used fresh pumpkin b/c I had some.  Next time when I'm in the mood for drier, denser, more scone-like cookie, I will follow the recipe exactly.  I think my changes only changed the texture, not the taste, which is just delicious.

These are great...even my 2 year old, who only seems to like chocolate, can't get enough of them!  The only thing I would change is the baking time.  I found that 9 minutes is plenty of time.  Any longer seems to dry them out.

I loved these! The flavors are good together, and the texture is unique. As others have mentioned they are different then a normal cookie. Co-workers liked them, and complimented them. As others may have said, the cookies do form exactly how you drop them on the cookie sheet, so make them look OK before throwing them in oven. I did as the picture and mixed powdered sugar with some milk, and drizzled over the top. That helps to add some sweetness to them, since they are again more cake like, and less sweet then typical cookie. Also, I did use dried cranberries, (could not even find frozen or fresh in grocery store) and used a full cup without cutting them, and I thought they were great. Cranberry, pumpkin, walnut was a good mix in this recipe! I will make again for holidays.

These cookies are more like drop scones--they're cakey rather than chewy or crisp like a cookie and they are not overly sweet--which is a nice change.
I made the recipe as outlined and baked them on parchment rather than a greased pan. 
They were fine fresh out of the oven but personally, I thought they tasted far better the next day--the extra time allows the flavors to more fully develop. I did not use any icing on them as I felt it was unnecessary.  These would be excellent served with an afternoon tea.

11.14.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/9707/cranberry-pumpkin-cookies/ ... True, I'm not a cakelike-cookie-lover so I'm not basing my review on that factor; only the flavor.  Well, not very cranberry-ish or pumpkin-y.  :(  'Wasn't really enough cinnamon to really tell it was there.  Pumpkin is pretty bland by itself.  This needs, my opinion, more pumpkin & more spice(s).  It may be one of those that's fabulous with the glaze, but I want to base my judgment on the cookie, not the great glaze.  'Fair?  :)

Loved the recipe. I made some changes to make the cookies "healthy".  I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of the regular white stuff.  I used expeller pressed canola oil instead of butter.  I used 1 cup of UNPACKED light brown sugar instead of the white stuff. And finally, i used pumpkin kernels instead of walnuts.  The pumpkin kernels deemed appropriate since the cookies were made from pumpkin. The cookies turned out FANTASTIC.  Just so the readers know, vegetable oil is better for you than animal fat (butter) so the canola oil works best.  Olive oil could be used but it has a distinct flavor but does not keep its heart healthy fats at HIGH temperatures so it's not good for baking or cooking.  But if you DON'T care about the heart healthy fats then you most certainly CAN use olive oil as a binder (but remember the flavor!).  Also, the whole wheat PASTRY flour is low glycemic and has fiber so it makes the cookies filling without the sugar high (along with using UNPACKED light brown sugar).  Whole wheat PASTRY flour is

I've made these many times, and they're always really popular! Today I doubled the cranberries, added some lemon zest and orange juice concentrate (lack of an orange made me follow other reviewers' experience), and added more cinnamon and some all spice.  Even without these additions, these are still incredible.  Just the right amount of sweetness - and so cakey!  Many people have asked for the recipe!  Thanks for a great cookie :-)

They came out very moist just as advertised but I thought the flavor was a bit flat.  I think they could use some white chocolate chips to give them a bit of crunch and added sweetness.

These were delicious! Light and fluffy, they were more like little cakes than cookies. Will definitely be making more of these in the future :)

Very unique cookies. The cranberries definitely have a little bit of a punch but the pumpkin mellows it out. I also added chocolate chips just because I love chocolate. Overall a great cookie for the fall.

YUMMY!!!!! I am amazed at how good these turned out. I did however tweak the recipe a little. I cut down the white sugar to 3/4 c and added 1/4 c brown sugar. Also added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice. I did follow one persons hint about half way thru cooking pressing the cookie down slightly. It's hard to eat just one!

A little bland on the first go round. I think I'm going to add some mini chocolate chips for the next batch. Chocolate makes everything better.

I made this recipe exactly as printed. These are my observations.  First, I dropped mine by well rounded teaspoon full and I got at least 45 cookies. Second, when I baked them 10 full minutes they were a little too done on the bottom (I have a gas stove if that makes a difference) so I baked for 8-9 minutes and they were perfect.  I think next time I'll use pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinnamon.  All in all they were delicious and the ones I brought to work didn't last very long.

as we love the tartness of cranberries, i doubled the amount of fresh cranberries.  i don't think they need to be cut in half - and i wouldn't waste my time next time.  (just sifting through fresh cranberries to get rid of the icky ones is time-consuming enough!) additionally, i topped the cookies with a fresh orange glaze made from powdered sugar, fresh orange rind and fresh orange juice.  next time i would double the recipe - all that work for only 32-38 cookies is silly.  the batter is a little tough to work with -- it is a thinner moister batter than most cookie doughs.  my 13 year old daughter decided they were a great "breakfast cookie".  it was hard to argue with her!  i would definitely make them again!

Amazing seasonal cookies!! I refrigerated the dough overnight, and the orange zest really made its way into the flavor.  I used half whole wheat flour for a more textured taste and added a teaspoon of nutmeg. Delicious!! No one could stop eating them.

Awesome cookies!  They are moist, chewy and totally delicious!  I sometimes add white chocolate chips to the batter...yummy and a nice punch of color!  A powdered sugar/milk/melted butter drizzle is also excellent, but not necessary if you add the white chocolate chips.  Thanks for the great recipie!  :-)

I used dried cranberries, plumped up in a little hot water, then drained.  I didn't have an orange on hand so I added 1/4 tsp orange extract, and I subbed white chocolate chips for the nuts.  Very nice, soft, mild-flavored cookies!  I think next time I'll add 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice in addition to the cinnamon, but still, no complaints about these.  One note - mine burned a bit on the bottoms at 375 degrees (could have been my cookie sheets, though), so I baked them at 350 for 12 minutes and they were perfect.

These cookies tasted okay, but the consistency was kind of strange - like a moist, spongy muffin. Also, I covered them with foil and after a day on the counter, they turned very sticky. I won't make these again...

These are so delicious!  I agree that you can't scrimp on the cranberries.  They must be fresh!  I added cloves and nutmeg as well as the cinnamon for a more 'holiday' flavor.  I omitted the nuts as we have allergies in the family.  Also drizzled a simple icing on top and that was a HIT!  These are definitely going into the Christmas rotation! EDITED to add that I recently made these in mini muffin tins and they are SO cute and a perfect addition to the holiday dessert table!

My father inlaw absolutely goes nuts for these cookies unfortunately he has to wait until the cranberries are in season.  They are soft and cakelike.  Only thing that I found is a must is using half whole wheat and half all purpose flour and unsalted butter.  I also sprinke with cinnamon sugar before I pop them in the oven.  I put them on a greased cookie sheet about 2 tbsp of dough and it makes roughly 24 cookies.  About 5 minutes in I get a greased spatula and push them down so they are more uniformly shaped.  I also end up baking about 18 minutes at this size. Because they are so moist you must let them cool and better just left on the counter than something airtight.

This cookie is delicious, my whole family loved the cookies...I didn't have any butter, so I used a 1/2 cup of Crisco Butter Flavored sticks.  Instead of the fresh cranberries, I used Sun Maid Cape Cod Cranberries and 1 cup of fresh pumpkin puree.    Thanks for sharing this recipe, like my boys say, "It's the BOMB!"

This was an excellent recipe. I only made a couple minor tweaks. First I doubled the cinnamon. Second, I used half turbinado sugar and half granulated sugar. If you've never baked with turbinado sugar, you should try it. It adds an extra texture and makes baked goods more moist. Delish! The fresh cranberries were a must, and I also popped them in the food processor. I put white chocolate chips in some and the others I made a white chocolate glaze. Both were fantastic and could go either way.  I didn't have any issues with mine looking like golf balls - they flattened just enough. Love these!

We replaced the cranberries with semi-sweet chocolate chips and didn't add the nuts.  We also added 1/2 tsp Nutmeg.  Yum.  My super picky kids loved them.

These are some of the best cookies I have ever put in my mouth.  The consistency of the batter made me nervous (almost bread dough like)...I didn't think they could turn out but they did.  The are not attractive but make up for it in taste.  I followed the recipe exactly as written minus the walnuts as I didn't have any in the house.  Oh, and I used thawed frozen cranberries which did wonderfully.  Next time I will add some finely chopped pecans.  I had to take them to work to get them out of the house...else I could eat every single one myself!

They are good not great. I like the pop of the cranberry and the softness of the pumpkin. I should have added pumpkin spice cuz tey weren"t all that flavorful

Loved these, I didn't have any fresh cranberries but will definately give them a try with those another time, just used crasins a generous cup, so yummy, my little girls liked them too! The hubby not so much, he likes his with chocolate chips :)
update: tried these again with fresh cranberries even better than the first time, however I think I will chop the cranberries next time, the big halves were pretty tart. So yummy, my new fall favorite!

I made these last Halloween (2008) and this Halloween when I asked a friend what I should bake, he remembered these! That's how much everyone loved them! Unfortunately at the time I couldn't find the recipe but I finally have! I will be making them in the near future for sure! though I do remember adding extra cranberries, and that made them turn out extra amazing!

I made this for a Christmas potluck...I barely got them there because my family wanted to eat them all.  The ladies at work loved THEM!  I used cherry flavored cranberries..but normal cranberries would be good.

I absolutely love these cookies!  The only addition I made was in the spice department.  I added ground ginger, cloves, nutmeg, cardamom, & allspice!  Next time I will try adding some oats!  Great recipe!  Thanks!

I use cranberries, pecans and chocolate chips and eliminate the orange zest. After cooling, I dip half in melted dipping chocolate and let cool on waxed paper. They're a hit everywhere I take them.

I just finished making these cookies.  Very good recipe! I only gave it 4 stars b/c i made a couple of changes based on other reviewers having problems with it being too moist.  I squeezed out the moisture from the pumpkin puree and omitted the baking powder and increased the baking soda by 1 teaspoon.  Added a little bit of flax just for some extra nutrition.  Thanks for the recipe!

very cakelike, they are good but the 4 stars come from the fact they are not "impressively" good... I also used dried berries, and the cookie didn't suffer for it, I think

Delicious, super-moist cookies! Be prepared to eat more than one!
I added a bit more sugar at the suggestion of previous reviewers. I also used a Tbsp of lemon juice instead of orange zest because I didn't have an orange or concentrate. I think the cookies would be better with the zest but they're fab anyway. I drizzled a vanilla glaze over the top of the cookies as well. Yum!

Just what I was looking for in a pumpkin cookie. The texture was light and cakey. I loved the zing of the cranberries. To save time, instead of halving the cranberries, I put them in a zip-lock freezer bag and crushed them with a rolling pin. It would be even faster to pulse them a few times in a food processor if you have one. I also added 1/4 t. nutmeg. I glazed them with a glaze that I made with orange juice (from the orange I zested for the dough) and powdered sugar. My kids ate them up as fast as I could make them. This is a tastey, festive recipe I'll pull out every holiday season.

I made this as a Thanksgiving dessert this year, and it was absolutely amazing and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe exactly, but instead of using orange zest, I used orange juice. I also added a sugar glaze overtop the cookies to give it an extra sweetness. I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe makes THE BEST cookies I've ever made!  Every where I bring these cookies, I'm asked for the recipe.  People love the cake-like texture of these cookies.  I used craisins instead of fresh cranberries.

Super moist and very good. I have made these multiple times and each time they turn out great. Rarely do they last long as the kids/co-workers gobble them up! They also take additions well and I have added white chocolate morsels or different spices such as ginger or nutmeg. These cookies always stay soft and aren't too sweet. Excellent recipe!

I made these one night b/c I had left over pumpkin and had to take them to work the next day b/c I kept eating them!  However, I took them to class before work and there weren't that many left for my co-workers.  Nice cakey texture, very light.  Great recipe!

Is it a stale little cake or a too soft cookie??  This is a cookie with an identity problem.  There has to be a better recipe for pumpkin and fresh cranberries.

These cookies are GREAT. I used fresh pumpkin left over from a pumpkin pie I had made which gave it a great, fresh taste. I also added in some white chocolate chips to make up for a lack of craisins. After the cookies had cooled I glazed them with a powdered sugar & milk glaze, which gave them just the amount of sweetness they needed. SO tasty. Make them. Right now.

Had to frost these with powdered sugar/milk glaze.  I thought the flavors worked together great.  They baked up much better on a regular cookie sheet vs. my stone.

We loved this recipe!  The cookies are cake-like and very moist.  Took them to a holiday bake sale and they were gone!  I did subsitute Craisins in place of fresh cranberries as someone else suggested.  I cut the Craisins in halves so they were well distributed throughout each cookie.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

I couln't wait to make these cookies, but the first two cookie sheets I put in, the cookies were flat like pankakes. They taste great, but I made the rest of the batter into muffins. I double checked the recipe, and I added everything like I was suppose to, so I don't understand what went wrong.

Awesome!  We had to use craisins because fresh cranberries didn't make it to our stores yet.  They are delicious and we can't stop eating them.  Will definitely make again when the cranberries come in.

This made a great cookie! Very moist and perfect for the Thanksgiving season. The pumpkin and cranberry pair well - I omitted the walnuts. I learned that the cookies didn't flatten as they baked, so they came out in whatever mishappen form I rolled them in. Next time I might make it as a bread or bars.

I would have given these a 5 if they had been called scones. They're very good, but not sweet enough or the right texture to be considered a cookie.

Decent cake-like cookies, but they need a little more flavor.  The pumpkin was not strong enough (my husband didn't even know they were pumpkin until I told him)! They also need more sugar.  I think it would be wise to put some sort of frosting on the top like I noticed on the photo.  Maybe I'll try it again with a few modifications.

These were delicious....very puffy and cakelike. I used more cranberries than called for- and they have to be fresh (frozen thawed)- it makes a difference. I'm also glad I did NOT use the pumpkin pie spice. Doesn't need it, the touch of cinnamon is plenty. Very nice seasonal cookie.

This recipe is AMAZING!  More like mini-cakes than cookies.  VERY light and fluffy.  Like I said, the recipe is GREAT as it is, but next time, I might use dried canberries, or even add a few more spices, like another reviewer suggested - a little more cinnamon, some nutmeg, etc.  

I will make these again and again and I will give the recipe to EVERYONE!

So Good!  I too was worried about the tartness of the cranberries, but they are perfect, so good!  I also used all whole wheat flour and they are still light and cake like!  Wonderful!  Thank you!!!  My 2 and 4 year old like them too!

Yum! My family and I love this cookie! I was looking for a lower fat pumpkin recipe and this one was a hit! I left out the walnuts(I'm allergic to them) and used golden raisins instead of the cranberries since I didn't have any. This is a real keeper!

Did I do something wrong? I keep reading great reviews and I was disappointed with these cookies. The cookie itself was very cakey and soft, with a good flavor, but the cranberries were WAY TOO BITTER/SOUR!!!! I read the recipe again after I made the cookies to make sure it didn't call for dried cranberries (much sweeter) or a can of cranberry sauce but nope, cranberries. Hmmmmm.

I didn't have any cranberries to add to the mix but these cookies were awesome even without them. The only thing I added was about a 1/4 teaspoon of ginger. I'll definitely make these again. They're a great fall treat.

I love pumpkin and cranberries so this was a natural winner for me.  I did chop my cranberries in small food processor to speed up chopping and added a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg as one reviewer suggested.  My new go to Christmas cookie.  Great texture.

I doubled the recipe and used craisins instead of fresh cranberries since I had a ton of craisins in my pantry already. I reduced it a little since craisins are already dehydrated. It came out great! They remind me a lot of scones. If there are any leftovers, I will likely enjoy these for breakfast with a nice cup of coffee.

I stock up on fresh cranberries and freeze them in one and 2-cup quantities so I can make these muffin-top like cookies all year. Most requested cookie I make. Recipe is great as written but I double the cinnamon and cranberries because I love extra flavor.

This recipe was phenomenal!  With it being right after Thanksgiving, I had a whole pumpkin pie leftover, I scooped the filling out of it and used it in this recipe.  I also had leftover homemade chunky cranberry sauce that I used.  A dash of almond and orange extract, really added an awesome depth of flavor!

One of my favorite cookies!  I usually make 3 small changes though I'm sure they're excellent as written.  
1. Leave out the nuts because too many people I serve them to have nut allergies. 
2. Use craisins instead of fresh cranberries.  I can only find the fresh ones few a weeks in the winter and I need to eat these for months and months. 
3.  Add chocolate chips.  No explanation needed.

It was delicious but slightly bland. Next time, I'll add more spice.

Great recipe! I substituted dried cranberries for the fresh but still cut the cranberries in half. I drizzled a little orange glaze to finish.

Definitely will keep this one and will make it again.  Great recipe, soft flavorful ciokies.  I added pepitas and didn't have an orange so substituted lemon zest.

I added 1 tsp of pumpin pie spice, a little squeezed orange juice and sprinkled the tops with cinnamon sugar before baking. You definitely have to compress the cookies half way into the cooking time unless you like golf ball shaped cookies.  I found them to be too bland and cake like for my tastes.  If I make them again, I would definitely add more spices.

Due to my mobility, i make muffins instead of cookies and substituted ordinary canned cranberries. Kids munched these before dinner as it was delayed. Parents took baggies of these home. Totally successful recipe. It made about 30 muffins

I have now made this recipe twice.  Fabulous recipe.  Last year I made it using dry cranberries.  This  time I used frozen cranberries.  I had to use more flour, and bake for 13 minutes.  They are great.  Light and cakey.  My husband who likes to complain, loves it.  Last year 's cookies were much denser yet excellent.  Served them during a Studio Tour to rave reviews.  I like both versions and will bake these again.  I have a freezer full of fresh pureed pumpkin to use.  First time I used the spice listed , this time increased the cinnamon to two tsp., and added about 1/2 tsp allspice, and a 1/4 tsp cloves.

Delicious cookies! Very light and fluffy! I couldn't find any pumpkin at the store, so I used sweet potatoes in place of them. I think I would like the pumpkin more, but it still turned out great! I'll definitely be making these again :)

Excellent flavor and easy to make.  I cut back on the sugar a bit as I love the tartness of the crans.  You have to try these!

These cookies are great! I just pulled them out of the oven, and my first thought was "Well...these are an odd color." The color wasn't like other pumpkin cookies I've made, it has a purplish hue. But I couldn't wait to try a bite, and when I did all my worries went away. I think they are just fine as it, but I added a glaze to the top (1 1/4c powdered sugar, 2-3tbl orange juice, 1tbl orange zest, dash of cinnamon) and for us it made them GREAT!

Excellent, thanks.

Modifications:  
Doubled the batch. 
Used orange flavor oil in place of zest.
Added a bit of nutmeg (because I love it!).
Replaced one egg with ground flax.
Had no walnuts, so skipped nuts.
Used unsweetened dried cranberries and raisins in place of fresh.
Modified the flour to my intolerance needs:  1 C coconut flour, 2 C almond flour, 1 1/2 C white rice flour, 1/2 C Tapioca flour.

Nice flavors. A texture that is both dry (from the coconut) and moist (from the others and baking to just the right brownness). The first batch disappeared in minutes!

These were the first cookies that I ever make completely from scratch. What an adventure! I omitted the nuts and the orange zest (didn't have any oranges) and then forgot to add the ginger another reviewer had used. Despite being a novice, these cookies turned out tasty! They are not sweet and they do have a cake consistency. I followed another reviewer's suggestion about using my spatula to flat them half way through baking. Good tip! The original picture shows icing on the cookies but I had no idea how to do that. I bet they would be even tastier (and a bit sweeter) with the icing.

Great cookies.  Moist and not too sweet with a light pumpkin flavour.  Instead of adding cranberries to the batter I  used left over cranberry sauce from thanksgiving dinner and added a 1/4 tsp to top off each cookie.  Would definitely recommend these and I'l make them again!

The cookies turned out great!!! I followed the reviews and added 1/4cup brown sugar as well as some nutmeg, clove and a little ginger with the cinnamon. I will also confess I added a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips instead of nuts. I had to cook them longer than the 10-12 minutes - more like 15-16. They turned out great though moist and cake like and great flavor!

Delish! First time I've used fresh cranberries,  between that and the orange zest, fantastic and I don't usually like pumpkin much. I added fresh ginger cos I had some and substituted pecans because that's what I had. we used the bigger cookies to make ice cream sandwiches . Wowzer! I'll glaze the rest and happily take them when I go visiting with ladies who are amazing bakers

These are very tastey and moist cookies. They capture the flavors of the holidays in a bite. I did not alter the recipe except to add just a hint of ginger. Next time I make them I may try adding a hint of cloves instead. Delish!

I've made these a couple of times and just LOVE them. I use the fresh cranberries. They create this lovely pop of tartness that is fantastic against the sweet pumpkin.

This cookie is good! It is not totally necessary but I did make a glaze with milk and powdered sugar to add to the tops of them. This really takes them over the top. Thanks for this great holiday cookie!

Absolutely incredible! They are beautiful and melt in your mouth! It's like a cross between a cupcake and a cookie.  Already wrote the recipe down to put in my booklet. I made a few minor alterations to call it my own but the basic recipe is amazing!

Loved these!! Made a double batch to take some to work and freeze some for the holidays.  Love the sweet and tart flavors.  This will be a staple recipe for me for the holidays from now on.

I made these cookies a few times. Reading reviews one person chopped cranberries– 1st time I put cranberries through a slicer-didn’t like result. Next time followed recipe totally – cranberries were SO GOOD whole and fresh - next time used 2 ½ cups of cranberries. I used a 1½ inch scoop for cookie size. Small number of cranberries leftover- I simply stuck on cookies – then used sliced almonds topping cookie dough and press the cookies a little wider, and baked at 375 for 18 minutes. The cookies do not spread at all – so they can be close together on cookie sheet for baking. One review used milk and powdered sugar frosting after cookies cooled. First few times I used normal consistency for powdered sugar frosting. This photo I used a thin frosting (enough milk the frosting was a runny consistency) using pastry brush covered cookies lightly. The cake like cookies with the crunchy almonds – oh – what an improvement, I simply used the almonds because they were ‘on hand’ (I’d over purchased sliced almonds for another cookie use!) 10/2015 update - these are big favorites this time of year. My addition of almonds on top - is labor added, simply folding almonds in after the cranberries is less work and adds the enhancing crunch. Great cookies!

These turned out really good! We used white chocolate chips instead of walnuts :) We used Craisins instead of fresh cranberries.... big mistake. They are so fluffy and yummy! I will definitely make these again.

I did not care for these cookies.  I thought they were rather 'flour-y' and somewhat tasteless.  They weren't very sweet, so if you want a sweet cookie, pass on these.  I followed the recipe exactly.

Absolutely delicious! To add more of a pumpkin pie flavor I also added 1 Tbsp Ginger and 1 Tbsp nutmeg. I think next time I will add a little extra cinnamon. Turned out great!

I thought it needed more sugar and a little more cinnamon.  And I had to cook each batch about 13 minutes.  Husband loved them after I got them tweeked.  I will make this a Holiday cookie in the future.

These cookies are awesome. I love that they aren't too sweet. Some key ingredients are definitely the real cranberries (I used frozen cranberries and cut them in half), and the orange zest. I love to bake, and found at the last few functions they were the first gone.  I topped them with a cinnamon glaze and a cream cheese frosting.

I just made these for a kid-friendly Thanksgiving dessert, and they are fantastic!  I omitted the walnuts and added an orange juice and powder sugar glaze over the tops.  So far, my parents and I haven't been able to stop nibbling on them, so they should go well with dinner!

I'm a baking rookie and I followed this recipe making no changes. I think using fresh cranberries is critical.  I found the cookies were kind of plain and not quite sweet enough- so I added a drizzle of sugary glaze I found at this recipe- "Old-Fashioned Soft Pumpkin Cookies" This saved the cookies and made them very, very good. Don't add too much glaze though otherwise it'll be too sweet! Next time I'll add more pumpkin, cranberries and add pumpkin spice, maybe some nutmeg. I'd still make these again!

After the holidays, I decided to try to make a "lighter" version of this wonderful cookie.  I used 1 stick of butter and a whole can (15 oz) of pumpkin.  Also sub. 1 c whole wheat flour.  Delicious!  My husband likens them to muffin tops.

I did not care for this recipe.  It tastes more like a scone than a cookie.   Not fit to eat without icing.  I used fresh cranberries cut in half.  Perhaps if I'd used dried they would have been even a little bit sweeter.  Also, it stayed in the shape of when dropped- so it was bumpy, not nice and round.  It is definitely more cake like in texture.

We really enjoyed this cookie.  Better the next day.  Do not skip the orange zest and use fresh cranberries. The flavors meld beautifully.  I topped with a little icing as the cookie alone is not sweet.  I think it made them "perfect"!  Thanks for the recipe.

As explained, these are VERY "cakelike" and might be better spooned into a cupcake pan.  Ours came out with a very strange color which, at first sight, made them unappetizing.  They are palletable, but will not be in our cookie rotation.

Loved the tart cranberries in a sweet, soft cookie!  I did pour a warm butter cream glaze on half of the cookies to try that out, and people seemed to like them both ways.  I will definitely make this every fall - a nice change from the typical overly sweet cookie. Thanks for a great recipe!

These were very tasty.  I did not have fresh cranberries, so I used a cup of Craisens instead.  I also added about 8oz of white chocolate chips, and dipped 1/2 the cookies, 1/2 in melted chocolate.   Everyone thought they were very tasty.  I will make these again.

The base of the cookies were good. The bitterness of the fresh cranberries ruined the cookies. The weren't sweet enough. There has to be a better recipe out there don't waste time tweaking this one

These cookies are incredible!  I made them today and followed the recipe exactly, except for using orange juice concentrate in place of the orange zest.  They came out great, and will be a hit at Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow!

Loved these! You may want to err on the side of overbaking a little if you are in question because they fall apart if they are even slightly underdone. I glazed with an orange juice and powdered sugar mixture, although they really don't need it!

What a great winter/fall cookie! With all those flavors everyone is sure to comment with every bit about the orange zest, cranberry, pumpkin and walnuts. I found that I needed to use quite a bit of extra flour, but that I had best results when the dough was still quite sticky when I baked it (less flour). I used pecans in place of walnuts, and it worked fine. I think that it would have been nice to have the stronger walnut taste, however, as the pecans blend into the background (but provide some good texture though). Next time I'll up the cranberry content as some cookies didn't seem to have even one and they're such a nice addition. The whole family liked them! Not too sweet, and very comforting with a cup of tea! :)

This is a keeper!! These are so good! I used dried cranberries but will be trying fresh ones next time. Do not omit the orange zest! These flavors mingle well. I am serving these tonight at my OES meeting along with Pumpkin Fluff Dip from this site. Also cinnamon graham crackers. This will be my new Holiday favorite goodies!

These were really good.  I didn't have quite 1 cup of pumpkin so I didn't put in a full cup of the cranberries.  I didn't want it to over power the pumpkin flavor.  They turned out very yummy.

If you like the taste of fresh cranberries, then these were fantastic!  I found them to be more muffin-like and almost wonder if the batter would bake well in muffin cups.  Anyway, five stars!  I made the recipe just as it was.  I did use fresh pumpkin instead of canned, though.

A real crowd pleaser! Turned out better than I'd hoped they would. Used Craisins each time and changed the spices a little....1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2  tsp. pumpkin pie spice.  For a glaze I used another reviewers suggestion of icing sugar, melted butter and orange juice.

Instead of putting the cranberries into the cookie dough- because I do not like them all that much and I didn't think it was needed, I put a half on the top of each of them and it still turned out great. I noticed they didn't spread out like most cookies do, but that they rise, so next time im going to spread all the dough onto the cookie sheet to bake then, cut them into bars. Thank you! We love the recipe!!!

These were delicious!  I did forget to add the orange zest and I changed the walnuts to white chocolate chips.  I used fresh cranberries right out of a cranberry bog in NJ (my husband works for Ocean Spray)and used a little more than a cup chopped in a food processor. Can't wait to make these again!

I love pumpkin recipes -cookies, breads, etc- and the fact that these have fresh cranberries makes them rise above the usual pumpkin fare.  I had some frozen cranberries that I used and the recipe turned out great.  I used a cookie scoop so the finished product wasn't perfectly smooth or uniform but that doesn't matter to me.  I also don't like orange zest nor walnuts, so I skipped those ingredients.  These cookies were very moist, chewy, and dense -  characteristics I really enjoy about baked pumpkin goods.

i made these without the nuts and added some pumpkin pie spice and fresh ginger. the first one i ate was bitter and i didn't think i cared for them at all. the second one was much better, and i was pleasantly surprised that my 19 month old LOVED them. my husband liked them so much he requested a second batch be made to take to work. i thought this was a 4 star winner ( 4 stars because i had added spices ) but while i was making the second batch i ate another of the cookies from the first batch and it already tastes stale and strange. they have an odd texture anyway, but i couldn't believe how quickly they turn to mush. i iced the first batch with a cream cheese icing my toddler loved. the second batch i drizzled with a sugar/milk/corn syrup glaze (i threw in a pinch of cinnamon) and my husband and i liked those better. i wish they were crunchier, but maybe it's the pumpkin that give them their texture. i don't think these will even be edible by morning, too bad i made so many thinking they were good.

These cookies have an odd texture - very cake-like, but moist and delicious nonetheless. I love them. They have a great, unusual flavor and almost seem healthy? Well, maybe not healthy, but less like a cookie and more like a trail snack or something. Good stuff.

This was a wondeful recipe. Pumpkin is not often used in Australia for sweet baking so this was a real treat for all of my friends and family. I have now done three batches. In the last one I threw in some white chocolate chips... definately worth a try. I also prefered mine without any icing but they taste great with a little natural yoghurt with them.

I followed the recipe exactly.  These were very tasty fresh out of the oven.  Very slight crisp to the edges & very soft everywhere else.  I was very happy with them until I tried one the next day.  It was so soft, almost soft & moist enough to break apart.  I took a bite.  No taste.  Bland.  Not appealing at all.  I gave it to the chickens.  My husband says he likes them but it's taking him a long time to eat them...

This is a wonderful, cakey cookie.  I substituted half the flour with whole wheat flour, and allspice for the cinnamon.  Also, I used craisins because I did not have fresh cranberries.  They still came out great!  You definitely can't stop at just one!!

These turned out very cake like and very moist and stayed soft.  I drizzled icing over them made of powdered sugar and orange juice.  I felt like the pumpkin was lost in this cookie, the fresh cranberries were wonderful, but I could not taste the pumpkin.

Excellent flavor. I noticed a lot of reviewers added frosting or some other sweet topping, and when I tasted the cookies I decided that extra sweetness was unnecessary. Some reviewers suggested the various pumpkin pie spices (nutmeg, cloves, ginger) yet the very non-pumpkin-pie flavor and consistency of these cookies made them great. Very tasty as written!

These have a really great flavor... I love the fresh cranberries and walnuts and you can definitely taste the pumpkin... but I am not sold on the consistency. They are more like very moist blobs of cake than they are cookies. They came out of the oven with a *slight* crispness to the outside, but by the time I served them for dessert that night they were more like dense sponges. Too moist, maybe? I still think they were very tasty, but I would want a crispier version of this recipe if I were to try it again.

Nice for fall...more of a cakey cookie then a chewy one. Kind of like a pumpkin bread taste...with cranberries.

I loved these cookies but my husband didn't like them at all.  They do seem more like a muffin and I used dried cranberries.

The recipe didn't really taste like pumpkin but it was still tasty. It needed a little more sugar and the texture from the walnuts really added to the soft, cake-like texture. Next time I would probably find another pumpkin cookie recipe.

I found it extremely difficult to handle - the dough was gummy like and I couldn't even get them to drop into circular shapes!  I also found I had to bake an extra minute or 2.  The recipe calls for a very full cup and/or more pumpkin and I wouldn't do that - I think it contributed to the gumminess of the dough.  I'd stick to just 1 cup of pumpkin.  Also, for an extra kick, I added nutmeg and cloves (1/4 tsp of each) to give it that spicier flavor it needed - I found the cookies too bland without it.

Ewww~  What did I do wrong?  Are you supposed to use fresh cranberries or canned/sweetened cranberries?  The bag of fresh cranberries were SO SOUR and made the cookies taste too sour for my liking.  
I was SO hoping that these would be tasty.  
SO?  What do you use?  Canned/jellied/sweetened cranberries or FRESH?

These are phenomenal! To be fair, I added white choc chips, and didn't do a glaze, but these are so good! Soft and cakelike, which i normally don't like, but these are so yummy! Chopped the cranberries up small so there wouldn't be big bites of tartness. So good!

These cookies were a HIT! They will definitely become a yearly holiday cookie made in our household. One great tip I followed was making a simple icing of powdered sugar and milk. Topping them off with the icing was a wonderful sweet contrast to the fresh tart cranberries.

I didn't have any oranges or orange juice...etc, so I used lime zest instead. I was a little nervous about the tartness of the cranberries but you have to eat more than one just to figure out if you really like them...and I do!

I will be bringing them to work tomorrow and I'm known for my great baking. I just hope that everyone else likes them.

I will be glazing some of them with a simple powdered sugar glaze like some comments suggest and maybe that will balance the tartness for some people!

Great little cake-like cookie recipe!

Great cookies, went over really well at work! Someone even paid for me to make them more! I made them with pureed sweet potatoes the first time and no one knew! The glaze on top was perfect with the cranberries! A KEEPER!

These are delicious!  I made a few very minor adjustments and also made two batches...one WITH nuts for me, and one without for my husband and daughter.  I added extra orange peel to brighten up the flavor. The first one out of the oven that I tasted did not impress me...it seemed VERY dry.  But as the batches came out and cooled, they became more moist.  Also, the next day they become SUPER moist. YUMMY!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I've made these several times now and just really love them.  This time I added some chocolate P2B (peanut butter powder) when I added the flour.  I think I should have added a bit more of that and left out the cranberries, but the possibilities are endless!

wasnt a big fan of these - company didnt care for them either.  i put a powdered sugar/milk frosting on the top of them - wouldnt want them without it.  too much going on for me with the nuts, cranberries, and orange zest.

These had good flavor but I'm in the firmer chewier cookie preferring camp.  I'm not sure what I expected but I was really disappointed with the texture. I almost thought I'd done something wrong due to the softness.  That'll teach me to not read the reviews .....

The cookies were great as is. After reading some of the reviews I made just a few minor changes to suit our taste. i used orange and vanilla extract, real cranberries chopped up and soaked in oj, 3/4 white and 1/4 br sugar. I  made the cookies, flattened them before baking and I also used a mini muffin tin. Worked great!! I used a small dough scoop and put in buttered mini tin then flattened just slightly. I made an orange glaze and put on half of cookies/muffin. I like the extra oj taste and really enjoyed biting into the larger pieces of cranberries so don't chop too fine. Muffins stored better than cookies, less soggy a day later.

This recipe is beyond amazing.  I baked the cookies last night and took them to school with me today.  It's 10 AM and I only have a few left.  The only thing I would recommend is be sure to make the cookies small because everyone will want them! 
I also would want to make them a little bit prettier.  I guess that will come with practice. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Like some other reviewers, glazed with powdered sugar/milk. I think that it added just the right amount of sweetness.

Yummy, soft cookies -- loved the tangy cranberries. A nice change from the usual cookies I make.

These were very good, but a little too soft.  The only change i made was 1/8 t. of lemon extract since i didn't have an orange to zest.  The flavor was very nice.  Very easy to make, too!!!

Yum! This is a good pumpkin cookie recipe. The texture is very soft and fluffy -- almost too soft for my liking. I was tempted to bake them longer to take away more moisture. The cranberries add a great pop of flavor.

These were excellent. Friends suggested adding coconut, which would be interesting, but possibly overkill. I drizzled a sugar glaze like the photo and it gave it a nice touch.

Very good! I don't even like pumpkin but I like these especially with a penuche frosting from another recipe. Perfect! I cut the sugar down when I make them for the kids and don't frost them. They still think they're great.

Very good, light and fluffy cookies! Used pumpkin pie filling instead of puree' and left out half the sugar. Used dried cranberries and omitted walnuts. Wonderful start to fall!

Quite tasty! I added an extra 1/8 cup of sugar because the batter wasn't quite sweet enough. If you don't, I would recommend a light icing; otherwise, the pumpkin taste is a bit too dominant.

This is a delicious cake-like cookie.  Needs the icing to help sweeten it up.

Soft cakelike cookies! Not too sweet. I used fresh cranberries but canned or even dried may make it a little sweeter and add more texture.

I hate to do this, but they came out of the oven great, but then I put them in my cookie rubbermaid, and the next morning they had become like dough, gooey and gross.  I had to toss them out, but initially these were very good.  I used grated ginger instead of orange zest, and half brown/half white sugar.  I added about half a cup of oatmeal that I briefly pulsed when I was chopping the cranberries in the food processor for that extra texture and health benefit.  Next time I think I might add some nutmeg to them.

Fantastic! They turned out better than expected. I added a bit of Grand Marnier to the batter and made a cream cheese glaze using Grand Marnier for the liquid which added a nice flavor. Great recipe for the holiday season!!

This recipe was fantastic. I tweaked it a little bit and it was amazing. My boyfriend doesn't have a sweet tooth and therefore typically doesn't touch anything I bake, but I had him try these cookies and he is now on his 5th cookie. Thanks so much!

This is a very very good cookie. Moist with little burst of everything in it. It is mouth watering. Only thing different is I added slightly a little more suger and one packet of splenda and a few more nuts.  This recipe is a keeper. Thank you for who ever invented this recipe or tweeked or what but it is delicious.

Excellent recipe. Ran out of sugar so used 1/2 splenda and 1/2 brown sugar and still came out wonderful. Definitely needs a small drizzle of powdered sugar glaze though--if you have more of a sweet tooth, also wonderful coated in the glaze. Great find!

These were really good and I love that they aren't overly sweet. I put a tiny bit of powedered sugar glaze on them just to offset the very tart cranberries I had. I will definitely make these again.

I didn't put any nuts because I was sharing with unkown people, only 3/4 cup of sugar and used one cup of spelt flour to replace white. I also iced like picture with cream cheese icing. Will make again.

Making some more! I am not a huge pumpkin fan but wanted to make a fall like cookie so I tried this out. WONDERFUL! Perfect amount of flavor to each thing. I used craisins instead of cranberries beacause I was lazy but still good. Also put a 10x sugar and milk drizlle on them cause the picture looked pretty and it just really complimented the cookie. I recommend to friends and strangers alike!

This is the second time I've made these "cookies."  As some others had noted, these don't have the right consistency to be called cookies.  Nonetheless, these were wonderful.  They aren't overly sweet and come out really soft.  These have become a quick favorite in our house.  I will make these again and again.  I followed the recipe exactly adding a little extra cinnamon.

I used this recipe for a cookie swap last fall, and everyone loved the cookies! For some of the younger kids who thought the cookies were too tart (That's the best part, though!) I added in some chocolate chips, and there was no more complaining. I love these cookies and can't keep my family from begging me to make them.

I really wanted to like these cookies.  I think they would taste better as a loaf instead of cookies, but that's from someone who prefers crispy, sweet cookies.  These could possibly be salvaged with some frosting on them...but it's highly doubtful I'll make them again.

My husband is Eastern European, and he prefers only slightly sweet desserts - I had to hide these cookies so he wouldn't eat them all at once!  I loved the texture, almost like little cakes.  Will definitely make again.

Not only were the cookies delicous, they are healthy.  (Pumpkin is one of the 14 superfoods in a recent book I read)  I packed some for my grandson's snack at daycare - he was happy with the cookies and I was happy knowing he wasnt' eating junk!  Thanks for this wonderful cookie recipe!

Excellent taste.  I used dried cranberries instead of fresh.  I do wish they were just a bit more chewy than cake-like however.  Nevertheless, I'm sure I'll make them again.  Thanks for the recipe.

These cookies are a hit with young and old alike!  I took these to a family function and everyone made me promise to make them for our holiday get together.  I did add a bit more sweetner than was called for as the fresh cranberries do make this cookie a bit tart - but soooo good.

I love these cookies. They are very soft. I gave some of these cookies to very picky children and they ate all my cookies.
