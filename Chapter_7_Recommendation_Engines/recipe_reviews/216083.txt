Made this dish last night.Doubled the sauce recipe, my husband has a thing for sauces and gravies..served it with rice and asparagus. My 21 yr old and husband LOVED it!! I thought it was pretty good, i ended up sprinkling parm. cheese on it. Think the addition of Basil ( preferably fresh) would add something.Will be making it again.

I'm rating this a 3 because I omitted the chili-garlic sauce. Can't have anything too spicy for medical reasons-Bummer! I needed to whip something up fast, and this was great. I had IQF chicken breasts which were very large, cut them in 1/2, used alot of garlic and reg.onion(no shallots on hand). Sauteed onions and garlic, browned chicken in pan, removed chicken to a plate and made the sauce in the pan using tblsp. of italian seasoning and 1 tsp. oregano. returned chicken to pan and simmered a bit more, added more than 2 tblsp. of cheese. I didn't have no-salt tomato paste either. For what I had on hand, this was a great meal. Served with rice. Thanx, JK

Super easy and tasty.  I also skipped the chile-garlic sauce since I had everything on hand except that.  I also used Italian seasoning instead of separate spices since I was out of thyme. I was expecting the sauce to be runnier but its actually pretty thick and coats the chicken well.

I made this dish almost exact. I used the same amount of everything but used only two chicken breasts and used 2% milk instead of heavy. It was very yummy!  I would love to make this for guests as it was only my boyfriend and me. Very good though!

I thought it was really good the only thing is it was a little too tomatoey. I added more cream and a little vodka to the sauce to thin out, seasoned it with salt, pepper and some italian seasoning. I placed the chicken breasts (i made enough for 8) in a baking dish sprayed with cooking spray in a 350 oven for 25 min. I placed the shredded mozzarella on top and baked until melted. To me it was like a mock chicken parmesan without the breading. I served the chicken with some italian herbed rice that I made and a salad.

If I could give this recipe a 10 rating, I would. I fixed as written and it was incredible. Of course, it is due to the butter and cream, but the flavor was outstanding. Just the right amount of heat. I definately would fix again! It will go into my favorites folder.

I changed the recipe so it would suit my taste buds: used chunks of skinless boneless cooked chicken breast that I added at the end of the sauce recipe.  Used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream.  (If you're on a gluten-free diet you might be lactose intolerant too, so remember to take a lactose pill.)  I used a prepared organic g.f. soup instead of tomato paste and added just a dollop of milk.).)  In short, I used the bare bones of the recipe but thank you though for the recipe's basic structure - it a good one.

The family loved it. My daughter who is a really picky eater walked into the other room to tell me how good it was. And my mother in law said it was great comfort food, she slept like a baby after eating it.

This was easy to make and turned out good.  My husband thought the sauce had a pizza-like flavor, which he was happy about.  I followed the recipe with two minor changes: regular tomato paste instead of no-salt-added, and half and half instead of heavy cream.

I added sliced fresh mushrooms, fresh diced onion, and grilled the chicken for less fat.  Delish
