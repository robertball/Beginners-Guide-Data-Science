Followed the recipe to the letter except I used black beans instead of light red Kidney Beans. They pretty much disappeared. Next time I would add more Cumin to the spice mix and maybe try adding some Masa to thicken it up a bit. Needs more salt and possibly a pound and a half of turkey instead of just a pound, but a solid place to start for homemade chili.

PRETTY SPICY! could cut out the chipotle or the jalapeno pepper. But definitely a lively dish. And warming on a cold winter night. Used leftover diced Tgiving turkey instead of ground turkey. And black beans. chili beans.

This was delicious! So quick and easy to make. I left out the coriander (simply because I didn't have any) and jalapeno, and I replaced the chili in adobo with a couple of tablespoons of Trader Joe's Italian Bomba Hot Pepper Sauce. It was plenty spicy (and I like spice) and super flavorful and yummy. Will be making this again.

Followed the recipe,  but the timing seemed off. After release, the chilli was more like soup. I ended up turning the saute on low and cooking it down.

We followed the recipe and it was great.  It had a nice heat to it and the cocoa gives the Chile a nice depth of flavour.

Did the spices as is and it has a great flavor! I used a quart of frozen Roma tomatoes from last summer in place of the 2 cans of tomatoes. Also used 1 T chipotle powder in place of the Adobo because I didn't have any. Next time I would add an additional quart of tomatoes or 2 more cans tomatoes to add more liquid and make it less spicy.

Loved it. Used 1 lb. Ground chicken and 1 lb. Ground Turkey. I don't like spicy chili so left out the Adobe and jalapeno.  We will definitely make it again.

I used two chipotle peppers out of the can with the adobo sauce...that's plenty spicy!  Good thing I didn't use any more!  But jeez, the flavors in this chili amazing!  If you want any more for leftovers then definitely double the recipe.

I am always looking for non-beef recipes to make in the new Instant Pot.  Tried a few other turkey chili ones and this is our favorite so far.  Thanks!
