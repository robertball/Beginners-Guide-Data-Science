This is so easy and yummy!  I have made it as written (very yummy) and also tried it with alfredo sauce instead of the ranch dressing.  Very yummy as well!

This was simple yet tasty.  I used my own homemade ranch dressing and added a little more of that and a tad more cheese.  There are a lot of possibilities with this for add-ons too!  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks!
