This is nearly identical to one of my favorite dessert recipes. My technique is a little different, but the basic idea is the same--and really delicious! I spread about 2/3 of the oat mixture in the pan, bake for 12 minutes, then cover with the caramel and a mixture of the leftover oats and the chocolate chips before baking another 15 minutes. This gives a nice firm base to the bar, and a gooey blended top layer! Yum!

These are excellent! Something to make the recipe even easier is to substitute caramel sauce for the wrapped caramels (omit milk too!). They turned out just as delicious with this change. I also double the oatmeal base as it is much better with a thicker bottom.

I brought these bar cookies into work and everyone raved about them. At least ten people asked for the recipe. It was very easy to make and assemble.

The taste was awesome but I too had a problem with it being very gooey. I tried the hint about baking the bottom for 12 minutes first but it still came out too gooey to actually cut into bars. However we will eat it even if we have to use a spoon! I have it in the refrigerator now hoping that I will be able to cut it when it's cold but not too sure. I probably won't make this again because of the messiness of the finished product.

The taste is great but the consistency is total mush - way more than just chewy. If I make these again I might double the amount of the crust (oat mixture) for a more solid base. I also might soften the butter instead of melting it.

I made this for a 4th of July cook-out and they were gone within a couple hours. I didn't have an 11x7 pan so I used an 8x8 and it turned out perfect. My husband is already begging me to make this again. Simple and delicious!

The recipe I have for this is doubled and bakes in a 9x12 pan. Also pecans are added with the chocolate chips and caramel. The caramel are melted with evaporated milk. Very rich and very good.

I have been making this exact recipe for years. I don't change a thing and they come out perfect everytime. They are always quick to go when on an assorted cookie tray. Great for the chewy chocolate lover!

These are SO good!! They are very rich but delicous. We have nick named them "Ewey Gooey Bars". Everybody loved them. Even the hubby who is not too big on sweets had seconds! Said they had great flavor.

Easy and delicious. Lots of requests for the recipe and the people at work yelled at me for breaking their diets.:D The crust seemed way too greasy with melted butter during prep but once it's baked it's fine. You definitely don't need to grease the bottom of the pan but the sides are probably smart since the caramel might stick.

I have made this recipe for large groups such as potlucks. I triple the oatmeal mixture and double the caramel. Place it in an 11x17 pan. I also omit the chocolate chips and add mini m&m's and chopped walnuts. They are absolutely delicious!

I used fresh pureed cherries in place of the caramel and chocolate chips. They are delicious! Any fruit could be substituted. I also covered with a Vanilla Glaze (recipe also on this website) to add a little more sweetness and also to help keep it from crumbling as much.

This was good. We added nuts to ours and liked it. Highly recommend letting it cool completely or it is very mushy and not that great. Once set it tasted like a giant cookie.

I made these and they seemed to be missing maybe an egg. The recipe also says makes 3 dozen! In a 11x7 pan? These bars taste good but they aren't bars more like a blop. Would be good on vanilla ice cream.

My grandmother used to make this on special occasions and all the grandchildren looked forward to it. We never had a name for it so the grandkids called it "Marcy" bars (after a combination of names of grandchildren Mark and Tracey). Since her passing I received her handwritten recipe and now make them for all family and neighborhood occasions. As others stated I baked the bottom crust for about 8 minutes (or until slightly brown) and 1/2 up the recipe. I also microwave a jar of Mrs. Richardson's butterscotch caramel topping to soften and mixed with 2 TBLS of flour add chips and then bake again. If you prefer less caramel you can adjust to taste. Same with the layer of chocolate chips. I always make a 9 x 13 pan because they always go so quickly. I made these for my son's school theater program and they were the first to go (and I made 3 pans!!). So easy and so good. I may try this with using dried fruit a little less caramel and whole wheat flour for a little healthier but still fun and sweet children's snack.

super sweet. I added walnuts but they'd be even better with coconut. The possibilities are really endless... I can see these with dried cranberries and white chocolate chips too... Will make these again!

These are the greatest bars I have ever made. Kraft makes caramels that you don't have to unwrap now. Just dump in the whole bag with the same amount of milk. Also I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup vegetable oil. This made the oatmeal mixture a little softer and chewier. I've made it both ways and I prefer a little oil.

This recipe has gottn me compliment after compliment! They disappear so quickly and they are super easy to make. I would like to try doubling the oatmeal mixture like some have suggested but haven't gotten around to it...everytime I make them I figure why mess with success. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

I agree very good! I started this recipe and then found out I had used all my oatmeal when I made granola last week. So I used the granola in place of the oatameal. It turned out even better I think becausee of the coconut vanilla and cinnamon in the granola. I'll be saving this one.

I brought these into work as a treat and they were gone in less than 2 hours! Someone said it was a new record. I also had requests for the recipe. I can't believe they are so easy to make! (The hardest part is peeling all of the caramels!) Thanks so much for the recipe.

I liked these but my coworkers LOVED them. I also found that doubling the oatmeal mixture worked much better for me. I live overseas so I have to make my own caramel as wrapped caramel squares aren't available here. That makes this recipe more effort than I usually want to expend but as my coworkers love to request this recipe I make it every couple of months. I've tried making it with less butter in the crust but then I get a weird gritty texture. I haven't found a butter ratio that I'm really thrilled with.

This recipe is wonderful!! My boyfriend can't wait when he finds out that I am making them. I like to double the oat mixture for a thicker bar. I also throw in some walnuts and peanut butter chips for a little different flavor.

Awsome!! I made this twice and the first time I used ingredients as stated and they were good. But the second time I used the "chewy caramel" from this site and they were awsome! I also followed another reviewer's advice to bake the bottom first and then add toppings and 1/3 of batter on top and bake again. We liked this way much better there is a little more texture to the bottom that way. This will become a definite staple goodie recipe in our house. Thanks!

These are totally addicting! The second time I made them we couldn't wait for them to cool off so we put it in the freezer. BAD IDEA! Putting it in the freezer made the caramel way too hard even after leaving it out on the counter for two days afterward. One time I didn't have enough chocolate chips so I did half chocolate chips and half white chocolate chips. Tasted just as yummy!

Yummy! Followed the directions to a T. Unwrapping all the caramels was a little time consuming but so worth it. Next time I think I will double the oat mixture since we like a little thicker bottom. Thanks Kim

The flavor was amazing however I decided to switch to an 8 x 8 pan at the last minute and I'm glad I did. My mom made this using an 11 x 7 pan like the recipe called for and it ended up being too thin which resulted in "hard" everything bars. Other than that we loved it and we will be making again soon!
