This came out quite delicious.  I did have to make a few changes to mine.  For instance, I used a Tbsp of Italian seasoning instead of the dried herbs, I also added a bit more salt than it called for since my soup came out a bit bland.  Finally I had to thicken up my milk more with roux (mixture of melted butter and flour) before I added it to the tomatoes but my tomatoes were very watery.  Besides that ;)  The recipe came out delicious and was definately the best tomato soup I have tasted!

I left the marjoram out only because our family does not care for that spice. I made no other changes. Nice basic cream of tomato soup. The kids raved about it. I paired this with homemade italian grilled cheese sandwiches. GREAT comfort food meal.

I loved this wonderful recipe (very similar to my mother-in-laws) using 2 - 14.5oz canned whole tomatoes that I just mashed up with a spoon.  I also only used about 1 and a half cups of milk.  It was a big hit, even with my 3 toddlers who have never had tomato soup before.

Very good, basic recipe!

My toddler son refuses to drink milk, so I have to sneak his calcium in where ever I can.  Someone had suggested canned tomato soup, but it is packed with corn syrup, so I thought I'd make some homemade.

He loves this soup and I do, too!  Easy to make and tasty.  I didn't have any marjoram, but it was great without it.  In a pinch, I make this soup with a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes and it is wonderful.  Excellent!

I've been searching for a tomato soup recipe that tastes like it took hours but in reality is simple and quick. Finally I found one! I like my tomato soup thick and a little chunky, so I used 4 cans of diced and peeled tomatoes. When heating them I added a Tbsp butter, lots of salt/pepper, and tsp sugar. Once it was hot and lost most of its liquid I blended half the tomatoes and added a small can of tomato paste, when that was smooth I barely blended the rest of the tomatoes in. I did not have marjoram and could not find the basil in my spice drawer so I used an Italian mix that had the three spices a long with garlic... It was discusting! Since then I dont add the spices and it is great. Thanks for this EASY recipe that is flexible to meet anyone's taste!!!

This was the best tomato soup ever! I upped the servings to 10 since I was making it for a playgroup. I used 7 fresh tomatoes and one 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes (no salt added) since tomatoes are so expensive this time of year. I used 1% milk, FRESH HERBS (SOOOO TASTY!!!!), and added one can of tomato paste. It came out amazing! The kids even loved it! They put fishy crackers in theirs and us adults had it with Feta cheese (per another reviewer) and it was sooooo good. I recommend using fresh herbs and letting it simmer for a while. It smells amazing. I made mine the night before and then heated it back up on the stove - even BETTER!

This is a great light soup to make.  I used the canned tomatoes and slightly pureed them.  With grilled cheese sandwiches it was a quick and easy meal!

i found the most beautiful heirloom tomatoes at the market, and decided to try using a variety in a tomato soup. i added a bit of minced garlic to the stewing tomatoes, and a bit of cayenne at the end with thyme substituting in the role of marjoram. Absolutely Delicious! and so easy.

Okay recipe.  It's definitely missing something though that I can't put my finger on.  Still shopping around for a great tomato recipe though.  Note: I would definitely blend the tomatoes.  Not blending is the difference between creamy soup and chunky soup.

I'm not sure what I didn wrong, but this turned out tasting like warm milk with a hint of tomato.  I doubt that I'll ever make this again, but if I do I'll only add one cup of milk and probably use canned seasoned tomatoes.

i will totally agree with one of the reviewers on here. whatever you do, make sure you DONT use the tomatos that have already been seasoned. i didnt think it would be all that bad because you add them in eventually but boy was i wrong!!! it was ineduble. a whole pot of soup down the drain. it smelled good but you really couldnt add anything to it to make it better.

this is an amazing recipie. i made it for a school health project and it turned out great.  to peel the tomatoes, just stick them in boiling water until the skins begin to come off. it makes peeling tomatoes a world easier.

I was not a fan of this soup.  I had to keep adding salt to get any flavor at all.  It barely had a tomatoey flavor... and it was pink!  I was looking for a homemade alternative to Campbells and this was not it.

I used the last batch of fresh summer tomatos.  Taking a hint from other reviews I sauteed 1/2 an onion and 2 cloves of garlic in 2T of butter and added that to the tomato mixture for extra flavor.  I also added more salt and increased the spices to my families preference.  Without those changes, I think the soup would have been quite bland.  I put the onions and garlic in the food processor so except for the taste they were not noticeable in the soup.  We enjoyed!

Good but MUST simmer for at least 2 hours for best flavor.  Next time puree only 1/2 tomatoes, leave some diced.

This is a good recipe but I added 1 Tablespoon minced garlic and 1 Tablespoon sugar.  Also extra salt and pepper.  I just thought it needed a little more flavor.  Great base to add to.

5 stars for ease and taste. I used up the 1 fresh tomato I had on hand with canned ones. I used Italian seasoning, which is practically the same as the ones called for, because I didn't have any of the individual spices. I also pureed the soup, and ate my second bowl with grated cheddar cheese on top. Both were GREAT, I will be making this again soon :)

Justlooking for tomato soup to have crackers with, this is a winner. Used a roux instead of a slurry. Used boiling water bath for fresh tomatoes, peeled them then quartered them, cooked with the baking soda. (Great idea there, also, if you put a pinch of baking soda in the water you make your japanese "dim-sum" dough, the dough has a "sweeter taste).  Only 1/2 cup milk into roux, poured that into tomatoes, maybe 1/2 cup water for right consistency. Also sfox, its "disgusting" not "discusting". Am keeping this recipe in my recipe box, no seasoning except salt and white pepper, eat with crackers. Delicious.  Lana Guinn

Made this last night with fresh tomatoes--with grilled cheese sandwiches, it was the perfect meal for a cool fall evening. The soup is very flavorful and pretty easy and beats the canned stuff hands down!

I didn’t have fresh tomatoes so I used a can of crushed tomatoes.  Also I used 1 cup of nonfat half and half as a substitute for one cup of the milk.  In all, I used 3 cups of milk and 1 cup of half and half.  We loved it and it will definitely be a lunch staple.

I blended about 8 fresh garden tomatoes and added curry powder (because I love curry) instead of celery powder (never heard of it) I don’t like to chew my tomato soup so I did add the celery and onions and carrots (yum) but blended the entire soup and added about a half cup of plane Greek yogurt for more of a creamy soup. It was delicious.

this soup is absolutely fantastic just the way it is.  My husband does not care for tomato soup but loved this one. Thank you, Lise

I think it would also be good with shrimp or other seafood.

I just made this soup.  It was easy and fast to make.  It looked VERY good, however it did not taste as good as it looked.  I agree with another viewer, "something is missing" from this soup.

Im giving this recipe 2 stars because it was so bland and flavorless. I added chicken bouillon, garlic powder, more pepper and doubled the herbs. I also poured in an 8 oz can of plain tomato sauce. This gave it more flavor and color, it looked pink. After a few alterations it tasted much better. Although, I wonder if this recipe would benefit from a few hrs on low heat (or crock pot).

I started by sauteeing one onion in butter, used high quality canned tomato puree instead of fresh tomatoes (fresh tomatoes are grown for long-distance, damage-free transport, not eating), and ditched the baking the soda. The whole family loved it.

I used home jarred tomatoes to make this, and it came out wonderfully! I plan to use this recipe again and again!

I too found this recipe a little "blah".
I doubled this recipe and added more spices,1 can of tomato paste,1 can of tomato soup and 2 undilluded vegetable boillon tablettes. It picked it up nicely!I will make it again soon.

I used this recipe as more of a guideline for my soup.  I used canned tomatos because they're more flavorful and ripened on the vine.  I just substituted molasses for sugar.  It was delish I'm on my 5th bowl (I'm pregnant) and I just wish I had some crackers!

It was missing something.  I had to add some sugar and a bit more salt for it to come out the way I liked it.  Give it a try.  With a little fiddling it's great.
