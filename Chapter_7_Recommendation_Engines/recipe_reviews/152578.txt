I really liked this recipe. The texture was very nice. The only problem was the salt measurement, it was extremely salty. I'm guessing 1/2 tsp. or possibly less. I did add about 1/3 cup more flour while kneading a few times, but this is normal for making biscuits. I wouldn't change anything but the salt. Very simple recipe, I will definitely make these again. Who would of thought using spelt flour could be so good!

I was thrilled to find this recipe.  My husband is on a very restrictive diet due to a host of health problems, including a Candida yeast infection.  He hasn't been able to eat any type of bread for months because he can't have wheat flours or anything with yeast or any type of sugar in it.  Spelt is one of the few things he can have.  Since he also can't have any dairy, I substituted the milk with rice milk and used aluminum free baking powder and they are wonderful.  I've made them twice and will be adding them to our regular diet.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

Very nice! After reading other reviews, I too halved the salt, but, to add a little flavour, I used celery salt instead of the regular. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder. They came out perfect.

These were awesome!  I used salted butter and then just a shake of sea salt. I find that spelt flour is very soft and I enjoy the gentle crumble these biscuits have.  I ate mine hot out of the toaster oven (that's how I cook everything) and loaded them with butter.  My 15 month old went crazy over them.  I will definitely recomment these to my clients (work as a nutritionist.)

These are fantastic hot and fresh out of the oven! I used coconut milk and vegan butter and they turned out absolutely delicious! And spelt doesn't stick to my waist like white and wheat flour so now I can have my biscuit and eat it too! :)

Easy to make, great taste.  I only used 1/2 tsp salt, and I used soy milk in place of regular milk.  Excellent! Thanks.

This recipe was a HIT!! for Sunday breakfast. Easy to make and bake and  what I did like about these biscuits were that they were not too buttery flavored and heavy for the stoamch. I would defintly do them again.

These were delicious!  They disappeared quite quickly.  As per the advice of previous reviewers, I too halved the salt.  Also, I only needed about 1/2 cup of [whole] milk rather than 2/3.  Next time, I'm going to have to make a couple dozen.

First time- the last 3 minutes of the spelt biscuits baking, my smoke alarm went off. 
Second time- Used less butter. Smoke alarm STILL went off :( they are still too good to resist though! 
thanks for sharing

These are the first biscuits I've ever been successful at making! These are soooo good! Who knew spelt flour would lend itself to such perfect biscuits? I halved the recipe and it was perfect for our family of four. The texture is wonderful, the taste wonderful (I did cut the salt in half), and so easy! This is my biscuit recipe from now on!

These biscuits are suprisingly good, and my family loved them.  I was expecting a "wheaty" taste, but it is very, very slight and closely resembles a regular white biscuit in flavor and texture.  I used buttermilk in place of the milk and they were excellent.

I made them with soy milk and otherwise kept the recipe the same.  They were tasty right out of the oven with organic honey spread on them but did not stand up well to the freezer.  If I make them again I will probably make a half batch since I normally bake just for myself.

These are now my go-to biscuit recipe.  I used 3/4 tsp of salt and felt like that was perfect for our family.  I also brushed the tops with butter and right at 10 minutes turned the broiler on and very lightly toasted the tops.  They were crusty on top and fluffy inside.  They did not rise well, but the taste and consistency more than made up for their appearance.  Thank you so much for posting this.

I just made these biscuits and the are delicious!!  I used almond milk instead of regular milk.  Mine turned out the same color as the ones pictured, but they split apart into flaky layers.  Not sure why because I expected them to be dense and heavy, but they are light a flaky and we didn't even need a knife to open them~YAY!  We ate them with butter, honey, and both together.  Any way you have it~YUUUMMMM!  I will ABSOLUTELY make these all the time, and they were so easy.

These are really good fresh out of the oven...plenty of butter. I love the nutty taste.  They do taste very thick but I like that.  My grandma said that she likes them better than regular biscuits because of the nutty flavor of the spelt.

I halved the salt like many others and used Earth Balance vegan butter and soy milk in place of the dairy. They came out perfect. I used a food processor to mix the dry ingredients and butter so they were incredibly quick to make. I also just scooped the batter with a disher and patted it down since I was in a hurry and they were still incredibly flaky without the work of rolling out the dough.

Going off on all the reviews saying these biscuits are so tasty, I got excited. Now, I've never used spelt flour. Followed the recipe (only reduced the salt like other reviewers said) but I wasn't impressed with the taste. It definitely taste better than whole wheat though but the biscuits taste very, very plain!!!

Excellent - crispy on the outside.  My only problem was they fell apart when I tried to split them.  I patted them into shape so maybe I didn't knead enough?

because I used oil instead of butter, these made into drop biscuits!  Great taste!  They were not as heavy as whole wheat biscuits, and had a great texture.  I'll be making these again!

I definitely got more than 6 biscuits from this recipe and I used a large circle cutter. They were decently puffy (make sure you actually roll the dough out an inch thick) and I used soy milk and coconut oil which is thick like butter. I also added Italian herbs and minced garlic to make them more savory and exciting. A good biscuit is one that can be eaten with nothing on it.

This recipe was very easy to follow and the biscuits came out great. I increased the recipe by 50%, used small cutters and baked for 9 minutes.  Spelt is a much heavier, nuttier flour so don't expect these to be flaky but they have great flavor!

I crack the spelt in my blendtec and also blend some almonds and water for my own almond "milk" mixture in place of milk. I think they are delish! My family loves them. I also cut the salt in half, otherwise they are pretty salty.

Super easy and very good recipe. I use regular AP flour because i make it in large quantities for our cafe. Also we like a sweeter biscuit to go with our gravy so I use less salt and add sugar.  Even if you don't want a sweeter biscuit I would still use less salt they can be a bit salty if you don't. This one is definitely a keeper, very good biscuits.

Great taste and great chewy texture. I could eat the entire batch...as with most biscuits, best fresh out of the oven!

You are right, this is the best spelt biscuits I've ever tasted, & I've tried several! I did cut the salt in half, though, & I used almond milk instead of regular milk. Thanks for the recipe. I hope you don't mind but I've added this recipe to mine at http://5fffffs.blogspot.com/   where I have other spelt recipes, & I have given you the credit. Please check out my site everyone that is interested in spelt recipes &/or diet recipes for Blood Type Os. Thank you again, Joy!

sooo easy. I did it all with my hands (no rolling) and they were fine. I also subbed vegan margarine and Silk brand coconut milk to make them vegan. I put in 1/2 tsp salt as other reviewers suggested. THEY WERE PERFECT. Best biscuits I have ever made. Don't even need to look for another biscuit recipe. Hubby said they were very tasty and didn't mind them, even though he is not vegan.

I haven't tried these yet, but the recipe looks good. I just wanted to warn the gentleman who can't eat wheat that Spelt is in the same family as wheat and does contain gluten, if he needs to avoid this.

I made these last night. It was my first experience with spelt flour. The first try went bad, I don't really want to admit why (I forgot the baking powder) so I made it again and added a bit of flaxseed for the nutritional benefits. In previous reviews I was reading that the bisquits are light and fluffy, but mine were still pretty hard (even when I remembered the baking powder). I will have to try it again and tweak the recipie a bit to make them fluffy.

I had never used spelt flour before I tried this recipe.  I had a 2 cup package of it and I wasn't sure what to do with it.  I decided to make these biscuits and I'm so glad I did!  I used less than 1/2 tsp salt and would not add more than that next time.  I poured in a little more milk than I meant to (still using less than 2/3 cup) and ended up with a very wet dough even after kneading.  Since I didn't have any more spelt flour, I added a few tablespoons of whole wheat.  The dough still seemed quite wet to me when I put the biscuits on the pan but they baked beautifully.  They have very good flavour even without adding any type of spread (butter, honey, etc).  We had ours with tomato soup.  Four stars because I reduced the salt.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yes I will make them again. They were good. But your picture of the biscuit was nothing like the real spelt biscuit. Spelt flour is brownish not white but they tasted great!

Love these! I don't have a gluten problem, but I don't like modern wheat, which has been so altered in the past 20some years. I use regular, not light, spelt flour and sift it before measuring. I also use unsalted butter and have cut back the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. The results are light, flaky biscuits. (Bob's Red Mill is a great source for spelt flour.)

This recipe turned out delicious. My husband said he could eat these every day and he would even give up bread if he could have these! I'm not sure if it's the kneeding that I did, but I could taste a lot of salt in some and others not so much. May recc reducing salt a tinge.

These were easy to make and tasted great considering they are made from spelt flour! I didn't tell my family that they were healthy biscuits and they really liked them. I only had almond milk in the house so that's what I used. Not sure if it was the milk but I needed to add more than the recipe called for and it still almost felt too dry but they baked quite well. I cut the salt in half as recommended and actually used sea salt. I have since made a second time and added a very small drizzle of honey on the top prior to baking and it enhanced the flavour. I would do that again.

I had some spelt flour I needed to use up, I always buy too much as the health store is so far away! Going to keep this recipe and play around with it. I could add sugar to make them for strawberry shortcake, add all kinds of herbs, or even just cinnamon and sugar. My best guess on the salt discrepancy is maybe the poster used UNsalted butter and the rest of us don't? I use salted butter for savory, unsalted for desserts, so that may be why, but I used 1/2 tsp too. Next time I'll double to have some to freeze.

Excellent.  Much better than I was expecting in a whole grain bun.  Following other's advice, I halved the salt and only needed 1/2 a cup of milk.  Turned out great.

I have never baked with Spelt before and so I was a little leary. This was an easy recipe and tastes really good. I love the nuttiness of the biscuit. This will go great with the corned beef and cabbage dinner I am making for tonight. My 3 daughters loved them also, so this is a plus!

I made these using whole spelt flour, and they turned out perfectly (I had also cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp.). I cut the biscuits out using a round 2 1/4" diameter jelly jar and made 10 biscuits. If you sprinkle flour over the top of the disk, the cut biscuits remove easily from the jar with a little shake. Thanks for a great recipe!

simple and delicious. Even works with coconut water in place of milk. Thanks for sharing.

I trippled the recipe, and ended up with 37 biscuits, and used regular white and wheat flour...average of 12 biscuits per batch. Other recipes, I get less...including my mom's recipe.  Love recipes that give more than what I'm expecting.

I made them this morning. Soooo good. I have been trying to stay away from regular flour so it's a welcome treat. I used a Tbsp. of salt so it had a cheesy flavour.

They taste good, but they certainly don't look like the picture.  They are a bit too salty so when I make them again I'll cut out the salt and just use the baking powder.

These came out perfectly. I added about two teaspoons of lemon juice to the milk to sour it up a little, otherwise I made no changes. They were flaky, fluffy, and the bottoms were perfectly browned after 12 minutes. I  definitely will make them again!

Thank you so much for this recipe. I made the biscuits this morning for breakfast and they were absolutely  delicious. I used 1/2 tsp of sea salt  due to previous reviews, I used vegan butter (Earth Balance soy-free) and hemp milk  with 1 tsp of apple cider vinegar  for that buttermilk appeal.  I am looking forward to using this basic recipe to make cinnamon raisin biscuits. Thank you again for taking 5 simple ingredients to create a masterpiece.

First time making biscuits, and I realized I didn't have enough butter, so I cut the recipe in half and shifted all dry ingredients.  They turned out GREAT! No need to try any other recipe.

Since my family is vegan, I made a few switch outs with the ingredients based on what I had: The butter Coconut Oil
The milk Coconut Milk
And though this is just because I want to be more healthy I switched the regular table salt out with Himalayin Pink Salt. The biscuits turned out great! Despite our last fail a couple of months ago it was a great victory! 
 (Though it was a little more on the salty side it wasn't bothersome) 
My family really enjoyed it with some Rasberry Perserves, Honey, and Coconut oil.  Hope you are successful in your cooking!

Great start for spelt biscuits, after making a few times I made the following changes.


Decrease the salt by about half.

Planning on making 12 biscuits?  Why not, it's not much more work to make a few extra.
Increase the entire recipe (including the new amount of salt) by about half.  This will create a thicker moister biscuit.

When they're fresh out of the oven either lightly brush water, or butter on the top to keep the biscuits from getting hard and crusty.

Easy to make and tasty, definitely a whole grain flavor.  Not tough at all, and I thought I overmixed in the food processor.  Sat kinda heavy in my stomach, though, so I may not  be able to digest this grain well.

I used whole wheat flour because I did not have spelt. You could reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp especially if your butter is salted. They  came out great.  I'm having these with scrambled eggs.  Thanks for the recipe.   Happy Halloween!

I made a quite a few changes, but turned out quite nicely! Wholesome and flakey! Great with soup we were having.
Doubled the recipe, but instead of 4 cups spelt flour only used three, and replaced the last cup with almond flour. Used margarine instead of butter, and only a couple grindings of ground sea salt. Also threw in 1tbsp pea flour and 1/4 cup tapioca flour, as well as about 1 tsp xantham gum (just happened to have all those on hand). Mixed the dry ingredients. Mixed in 1/2 cup margarine until incorporated. Pre-soaked 1/4  cup ground and added that, then 3/4 cup almond milk. Rolled out between sheets of parchment paper & sprinkled with more spelt flour, fold, repeated several times. Wow, more changes than I realized! Cut out with a cup and placed on parchment paper on a cookie sheet for the full 15 mins. Browned nicely! The ones that started out thicker turned out better (about 3/4 inch raw).

These biscuits worked for my biscuits and sausage gravy, and My family liked them as well. I would have preferred a more moist biscuit if I weren't pairing it with a gravy however. 
I accidentally added a teaspoon of sugar when I was adding the salt and they had a lovely flavor nonetheless . I also added in an extra tablespoon of butter, but had been using the 'light' kind and so I'm not sure how much, if any, difference it made. I will be using and tweaking with this recipe because it's easy! I, too, only used 1/2 cup of milk. I used skim to make it a little lighter when it came to fat content.

These would get a five star rating for taste, but I had to take a star away because they were very dense.  Any advice for making them fluffier would be appreciated.

This is a great recipe for spelt flour, and actually using white or white whole wheat, too. Sometimes I use sour cream for part of the milk for a change. Also, a good way to add your butter is by grating it. It is then already in small particles, no need to cut it in.

I used light spelt flour and followed the recipe exactly. My biscuits came out a little flat and not white like in the picture, but the flavor was great and they were soft and yummy. I made them as a base for chicken pot pie filling--they will be perfect for that! I will be using this recipe a lot!!!

These are really good. I grind my own spelt flour from whole spelt berries so mine didn't look like the picture, but I'm guessing maybe some people use refined spelt flour. They tasted just fine, though I wish I had reduced the salt a bit like others have said. Mine were a bit denser than a typical biscuit, but I am used to that with the whole grain einkorn and spelt that I typically use for bread and everything else. feel I should mention that spelt is in fact wheat (some reviewers sounded like they may not know that.) Important to know if you have celiac or gluten intolerance of some sort. Overall a good biscuit recipe! It's in my recipe box now.

I have not baked these yet; however, the batter is EXTREMELY salty. If the rest is okay after baking, I will definitely cut the salt in half next time and try again.

These biscuits are very tasty and easy to make.  I was surprised how much they rose.  I am using a White Unbleached Spelt flour from my health food store.  And Almond Milk.  Spelt makes great pancakes as well!

Light and nutty, this recipe is great just the way it is. That being said, the second time I made it I added a sprinkle each of basil, oregano and granulated garlic, along with 1/2 tsp sugar. Once cut out, I brushed them with melted butter and lightly pressed spelt flakes on the tops.  I then served them with a little butter and a drizzle of honey. They made a great accompaniment to a bowl of hearty chicken/pumpkin soup. Even the non-biscuit eater in the family loved them and had two.

Just made this for dinner and it was perfect other than next one I will use less salt.  I used sprouted flour and they were soft and had a great crust.  Will make again.  Key is never overwork dough and if you see chunks of butter the better.

I give this recipe four stars because I think it should be emphasized that it would be best made with unsalted butter with this amount of salt added. Otherwise, you will probably want to cut down on the salt a bit, for the sake of flavor. Also, I'm not sure that you should go through the trouble to cut these. Mine were much more like drop biscuits, and I followed the ingredients exactly.

All that said, however, I really liked them anyway.

I haven't really made biscuits before, and was looking for something to have with homemade turkey soup. After reading some of the comments I made sure to use unsalted butter in the recipe and they turned out really great. The texture was perfect and they tasted great!

I wanted to try spelt since it is a healthy grain.
I fell over this recipe and thought I would try it since it is so simple.  
Made them.  
So easy to make!
Excellent!

I did not use any salt, as I am trying to lower my salt instake, but they tasted great without the salt.

Highly recommended recipe!

They are really light and fluffy. A kind of melt in your mouth biscuit. I just can't decide if it is too much salt or not as the salt adds a lot of flavor.

These are really good biscuits and this is from someone who isn't terribly fond of biscuits as a rule.  I usually find biscuits dry, rather tasteless and overall unappealing - even when they are nice and fluffy, all that white flour has no real flavour.  These biscuits are yummy and actually have flavour which is so nice!  This recipe has become a staple for my family.  Thank you for the great biscuits!
