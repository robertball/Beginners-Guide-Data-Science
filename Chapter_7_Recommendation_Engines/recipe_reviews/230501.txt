This was so good...and versatile. Also good as leftovers! I substituted mushrooms for cauliflower - delicious!  I didn't know what deglazing meant and googled it after it was too late. I just threw the wine in with the vegetables instead of taking the vegetables out like you are supposed to when deglazing. It was still good. Also, I remembered I was supposed to save a cup of the pasta water as I was watching it all disappear down the drain! I ended up not adding any liquid and it was just fine. Also, since the carrots were not in the instructions, I forgot to add those. You probably just add them in with the other veggies though, right?

Super yummy and simple! Reheats really well. I left out the cauliflower and added in more sprouts and carrots I also left out the butter and used a bit more oil, and it's still quite flavorful. I've made this deglazing with wine, but I also made it one night with beer and it was delicious! Just a little different flavor. Last addition that I sometimes throw in if I've got it is a little Kielbasa sausage...I think it goes well with the other flavors rather than using chicken or beef. This is a keeper for sure.

I brown a couple of cloves of crushed garlic with the onion.  As a final step I top with bread crumbs browned in olive oil.  It adds a bit of extra crunch and an extra layer of depth.

I sauteed 1 lb ground turkey & garlic,  1/4 tsp red pepper flakes and added it to this recipe.  No elbow pasta, so I used Penne other than those changes I followed the the recipe as written.  Great flavor and we loved the textures.  I'm going to try it with rice g/f pasta this weekend

Used Barilla gluten free pasta. Simple and authentic Italian flair.  Delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

I tried this recipe last night and loved it! It's really tasty and my husband enjoyed it too. (He usually hates Brussels sprouts.) I followed the recipe closely, just splitting it in half because there's only two of us. You really do need the pasta water at the end to make the sauce. Also, the recipe fails to mention adding the diced carrots to the mix, so I added those at the same time I put the Brussels sprouts and cauliflower into the pan.

I used half a box of whole what elbow mac, and it was plenty for my taste.  Also, I added one more carrot.  Delicious!

I browned lb of 96% lean ground beef and then cooked onion in the fat from that & 1T butter, left out the olive oil.  I then added the other veggies and some crushed red pepper flakes.  I didn't have a whole cup of white wine, only 3/4. used it and added a bit of apple cider vinegar, balsamic vinegar, and lemon juice.  I also only used about 7 ounces of pasta. It filled up my huge pan and total calories was about 2000 which would make 3-4 decent sized servings. It was very good. I also added a little extra cheese.

This dish is very good. However,I did take advice from some of the other cooks. I used olive oil, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, half the pasta, and and red wine. We thought it was very good and my husband says "it is a keeper".

Good recipe that's easy to adapt to personal taste. I was trying to use up leftover pasta and this made it taste "new." I shredded the sprouts instead of quartering them so that they would brown more quickly and they are easier to eat. A little squeeze of lemon juice and some garlic were a couple of other minor changes. Also, we didn't have any cauliflower on hand, but it was still very good.

Excellent! Just added garlic, a little fresh thyme, paprika, and red pepper. I also added chicken and deglazed with equal parts white wine and chicken stock.

Easy, but very, very bland. We hit it with some garlic salt at the table, which helped a little, but overall this was just really boring.

Can't believe even my picky 4 yr old gobbled this up!  I don't think I'll use as much butter next time.  It wasn't necessary.  Might also add more wine.  It added a nice light flavor, but was barely perceptible.

Ok so this sounds really good, we love brussel sprouts, aka, baby cabbage in my house to the little ones. I will add garlic an probably chicken cuz my husband can't eat a meal w/o meat (which is so annoying btw) but I am curious, what's the carrot for? Its listed in the ingreidients but never mentioned in the recipe. I'll prolly just omit it but jus wanted to bring it to ur attention. I cant seem to follow a recipe w/o puttin my spin on it.  Thanks for the great recipe thou.

I followed the recipe except I used only half the amount of pasta, but it was plenty in proportion to the amount of other ingredients.  I added 2 cloves minced garlic.  But it was very bland.  Amount of salt & pepper is not given in the recipe.  I added 1 tsp to boiling water before cooking the pasta,  I added 1/2 tsp each salt & pepper to the finished dish.  Needs more seasoning.  Perhaps crushed red pepper flakes.

Made this as written and while I liked it I found it a little bland. I will make it again and think I would add some garlic, maybe some other things like olives (because I like olives on about everything). I may try adding some additional spices to get a little more flavor.

I added diced red peppers and substituted cilantro for the parsley. Excellent main course for vegetarian company.  No one missed the meat.

extremely easy to make especially on a time crunch. had a sleep over with 6 kids and wasn't sure they would like the cauliflower and brussel sprouts but it was a big hit and they asked for seconds. I would add much more freshly grated cheese when I make this again.

This was a yummy meat free meal! I added garlic to the onion saute and upped the wine to 1/2 cup. I cooked the vegetables for about 15 minutes. I added just a splash of lemon before adding the cheese. I used half the pasta and that was more than enough for 4 generous portions. I would make this again in a heart beat!

Made it using another brand of pasta:) Added red pepper flakes and it was delish.
