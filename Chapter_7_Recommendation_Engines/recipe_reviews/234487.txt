we make versions of this all the time.  Place the tortilla in a lightly oiled pan and put the stuff on half, fold it over and press down. Add another tortilla  and fill half, fold it over. The first might be ready to turn. It's like an assembly line. It's much easier to flip a folded one.

Excellent! I did not have leftover steak, but I did make this using flat iron steak that I had marinated in worchestershire sauce, salt, pepper and garlic. These were so simple to make and very satisfying. I served them w/ sour cream, salsa and mexican rice. Great way to strech a small amount of meat. I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I've been making something similar to this, out of leftovers for years and we love them! Nice to have a guideline, extra suggestions and some validation!
To the person who wrote, "Missing important step. Need to cook the steak." You are missing an important ingredient description... "1/2 pound COOKED steak".

Quick, easy and delicious.  I used chicken breast rather than steak.  Grilled them on a quesadilla maker.  Served them with 'Quesadilla Jalapeño Spread' and 'Rice Elena', both from AR.

Really good! I made this tonight and my husband & I both loved it. I exchanged the steak for black beans to keep it vegetarian and it was great. We topped with salsa, sour cream & guacamole -- so yummy. Thanks!

I used fresh chuck tender steak which I marinated in a blend of 1/4 c veg oil, 1 Tbsp vinegar and  a few tablespoons of fajitas seasoning (in ziplock bag for several hours.). We grilled the steak and sliced it into very thin strips.  I sautéed the onions,and peppers until half way cooked then added a cup of sliced mushrooms and continued to sauté the veggies.  After cooking the quesadillas as suggested, I sieved them with sides of sour cream, avocado and salsa verde as options.  I used the large flour tortillas which were too large and not as easy to flip over.  I will remember to used the smaller 8  inch tortillas.  This made two large quesadilla. Will make this again.

I had some leftover steak and some onion, no bell pepper, but I did have some sliced mushrooms. I also used some sliced pepper jack. It held up deliciously to the substitutions, and took this disorganized cook only ten minutes from conception to table!

I used this as the base for Johnsonville's (R) Six Ingredient or Less challenge, subbing sausage in a 6 ingredient recipe.  I made per the directions, using chopped cooked mild sausage in place of the steak (because sausage, peppers, and onions are perfect fit, right?!).  I don't care for sausage, so it's tough for me to gauge, bit it was good w/the sausage and I'm sure would be prefect w/leftover steak, too.  Leftover sausage, leftover steak....no matter what the protein, this is a great, quick, simple weeknight meal.  THANKS for the recipe!

LOVED this and so did my 5 yr old and husband. I used chicken cooked in olive oil instead of steak. I made vegetables on the side and I only ate two quarter wedges, which surprised me that I was full. I didn't use salt and I expected these to be bland but they weren't at all. I used baking spray instead of more oil and just sprayed my pan for the tortillas. Worked great! Also used whole wheat tortillas. Can't wait to make this again.

Myself and the hubby loved it! I didn't have green pepper, but as a pepper lover I used 1 whole red pepper and 1 whole orange pepper. I also had extra steak that needed to be cooked and a lot of cheese, so I had enough stuff to make 3 Quesadillas. Had some corn as a side dish. That was more filling then we expected so we have some extra for lunch today! :)

Great! Made it with leftover rotisserie chicken. Saute' peppers, onions and a shucked ear of corn. Mixed together with a shake of chili powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, cayenne, oregano, garlic powder with a pinch of sugar. Yum!

I made this recipe tonight.  I changed it a little.  I used yellow peppers and also added a couple tablespoons of taco seasoning.  My grandkids ages 17 months, 4 years,  7 and 10 years, along with me and my husband loved them.

Very good results for minimal effort!  I scaled it down to 2 servings and used the pre-cooked chicken breast strips that I cut up in place of the steak (will try with that another time).  I added a few good handfuls of frozen chopped multi-colored peppers and onions (what a time-saver!), cooking briefly in a little olive oil. I didn't have Mexican cheese on hand instead  I used a few slices of processed American cheddar cheese and a piece of pepper jack cheese. I wanted to flavor/spice this up a bit, so I topped the onion layer with a little cumin, smoked paprika, onion and garlic powder and black pepper. Thanks for this great recipe which I'll surely make again!

very easy to make especially if you have leftover meat.  My 14 yr. old loves to make these.  I left my tortillas on a little longer so they were crisper to our liking.  Overall great recipe, Thanks!

So yummy! I failed at flipping it over in the skillet so part of it looked like more of something else than a quesadilla, but it tasted great! Like something you’d eat in a restaurant. Both the hubbs and children loved it and wanted more. Served with sour cream and guac.

Only slight changes in ingredients, we used thin cut sandwich steaks cut into strips and sautéed since we didn’t have any leftover steak. Added some fresh jalapeños to the veggies too. And rather than use 2 tortillas, I used one, and folded it like an omelette  to make it easier to turn. But we essentially made it as written. This is one of those dishes with a lot of versatility. I’ve done similar things with shredded Buffalo chicken and even pulled pork bbq. Definitely a keeper.

Excellent! We never have leftover steak so I grilled a couple of small sirloins rubbed with taco seasoning . I let them rest, covered with foil.  Proceeded as directed.
Be sure to cut the steak across the grain.
I served this to my husband's golfing buddies, accompanied with all the usual garnishes and our favorite Mexican saffron rice pilaf with vegetables.
I will certainly serve this again!  
Thanks for the great recipee!

Excellent way to use up leftover steak. I felt the filling itself was rather bland and could use a tablespoon or so of fajita seasoning. Overall a great fast easy meal. I topped ours with homemade quacamole and Pico de gallo (from this site).

This was a nice change from my regular chicken quesadillas. I used thinly sliced flat iron steak that I marinated overnight with some onion powder, garlic powder, and steak seasoning. I used a whole green bell pepper and half an onion and cooked the steak peppers and onions for 10 minutes on the stove on olive oil. I then but everything in the tortillas and added lots of shredded Colby jack cheese and put each one on the quesadilla pressed and they cane out great. I served with chips and fresh pic de gallo and guacamole

They were really good. I did not make any changes. I make it as the recipe stated and it was delicious.

I made this last night. My family loved it! I made it exact, according to ingredients.  Other family members added more to it as they wished. (hot peppers more cheese,salsa on top , etc. They all said they want me to make this again.  Thanks!
