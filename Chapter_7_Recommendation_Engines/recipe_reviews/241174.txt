they did turn out more dense than bisquick dumplings, but this worked in a pinch when we were out of bisquick. Would use again. Thank you!! :)

I found these dumplings to be dense and they didn't rise, perhaps it was user error. I would probably add more baking powder and a little butter to the mixture if I were to make them again.

Just what I was looking for-- didn't have Bisquick on hand. This recipe made nice dumplings.

I added salt and parsley to make them a little bit different. They were very easy to make.

Great recipe.  I was out of bisquick and this was a great substitute!  I didn't make any additions or changes. Perfect just the way it is. Simple and good!

These are great, I put all the ingredients in my kitchen aid and mixed up much faster.  Rolled them out instead of how recipe calls for and they were perfect.  I will be making these again and again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with us.

A basic, straightforward dumplings recipe. Fully cooked, buoyant, tasty dumplings that were easy to make with few ingredients and little extra effort. My family gobbled them up! Thanks!

I've always made dumplings with Bisquick, but my mix was expired.  I couldn't believe how quick and easy this recipe was, and how well the dumplings turned out!  I'm never buying mix again!

Easy recipe and maybe I cook them to long but they were really doughy tasting. Probably won't make again.
