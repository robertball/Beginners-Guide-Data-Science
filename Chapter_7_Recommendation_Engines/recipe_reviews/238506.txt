Excellent flavor! I have to say I was skeptical about the ingredients for the marinade, but Chef John nailed it! My steak marinated for about 10 hours. Once I put the steak on the grill I sauted some sliced mushrooms in butter and then added leftover marinade and reduced it for about 10 minutes to top the steak.
Thanks Chef John! I will make this again and again!

OMG This is an excellent recipe,  I used this on a chuck steak grilled med rare. I followed the recipe exact, but the next day i took the left over beef cut it into small pieces then put them in a bowl with flour, garlic powder, salt and pepper then browned the meat in a skillet with olive oil. I then added the mushrooms and onions (also left over) 2 potatoes cut into small pieces 3 carrots and 3 stalks of celery, covered with low sodium beef broth cooked until vegis were done. Great beef stew i will always use this marinade for beef stew, it was perfect. Thank you chef John. What flavor!!!!

Well this was just OK. I marinated it for 7 hours and the flavor was SO INTENSE. In the video chef john says he only marinated it for half the time. That may be the key to this recipe. I didn't think it was that bad but my Fam did.

EXCELLENT marinade. I have tried dozens of skirt steak marinade and this is by far the best. I left off the rosemary because my family doesn't care for it. Marinated overnight and grilled 3.5 minutes on each side (it was pretty thick for skirt steak) and it was perfectly rare on the thicker part and medium at the other end. So tender too!

I've made this several times with either flank or skirt steak. I marinate it overnight and while it does have a strong flavor, I think it's just right. No sauce needed!! I usually use a grill pan on my stove top. Thank you Chef John!

Loved it. Only marinated for 4 hours and added a splash of olive oil to the marinade. I only had fresh Rosemary and used about a tablespoon ( fresh is less intense so use more.)  Also added a splash of Tabasco. I love a good rare steak but skirt steak, in my opinion, needs to just be pink inside.  Went just over 6 minutes on each side.

I enjoyed the flavor of this.  I was SO committed to using skirt steak, but then sirloin was buy-1-get-1 free, and I couldn't resist that deal.  It wasn't the same tenderness I was hoping for when I found myself salivating over the video for this recipe, but that's probably my own silly fault for not using the correct cut of meat.  However, I wonder if I had marinated overnight, perhaps the tenderness I was shooting for could've been achieved.

Excellent marinade!  I've used it for both skirt steak and flank steak.  Grilled very rare.  Heated leftover marinade and poured over sliced steak.

This recipe was good and had lots of flavor. The skirt steak was fairly tender and I will definitely make it again. I wasn't sure about the ketchup but I made the recipe exactly as it was written and it was good.

Followed directions to the letter on the first go around and it was darn good, but slightly on the salty side. Will reduce amount of salt the next go, but this is good enough to get added to the recipe book. Meat was juicy and tender just as advised and even my toddler downed a couple slices (and meat usually isn’t their thing). Flavor was overall delightful. I’ll try reducing the extra marinade with butter and mushrooms like another reviewer stated as I would have loved more meat juice with this, but the good sear locks in the juice, so there just isn’t much as stated in the video.

Although I marinated for double the time and even added marinade, I still didn't really get a marsala taste. Although the steak itself turned out juicy, the outside was burnt from the sugars of the wine itself. Somewhat disappointed.

OMG!  Made the marinade in a seal proof plastic bag sealed it and shook it all up.  Added the steaks and shook them up some more.  They sat in the refrigerator for 24 hours flipping the bag every so often.  Made exactly to the recipe.  Grilled them in my new grill  pan on top of the stove.  Fabulous flavor and melt in your mouth tender.  Husband did not even use steak sauce because he liked the flavor so much.  I will make this again for sure.  Definitely a keeper.

A keeper for sure.  We used a sirloin steak for this & the meat was very tender & flavorful.  As it turned out we only had 1/4 c of marsala wine & that did seem to be fine.  We'll try with the 1/2 c next time.   I would suggest marinating over night, that is what we did.
