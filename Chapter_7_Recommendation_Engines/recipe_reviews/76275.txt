I was hesitant to try a recipe that used Splenda-so I recalculated the recipe down to 6 servings,so if I had to dump it,I wouldnt be wasting as many ingredients....however,I was pleasantly surprised at how well these came out!You would not guess that they had anything other than real sugar!The texture was really great!Soft and fluffy-actually,better than most of the recipes-from-scratch that I've baked!I used mini-muffin pans and baked them for 12 minutes...it seems that these dont brown as much as regular cupcakes,so you do need to be careful not to overbake them....the tops are still kind of shiny when they are done...What's a cupcake without icing??I used the "Wedding cake icing" (cut down to 8 servings and using the new 0 trans fat Crisco)and used a pastry bag with a star tip to top the cupcakes (tinted the icing pink)..I will be making these again....and not telling anyone my "secret"

Good flavor, but a little on the dry side.

this cake turned out great considering it was made with splenda. i would definitely keep a close eye on the baking time since these cakes dry out so quickly. next time i might bake a little less and add something just to add a bit more of the moisture that it needs.

Excellent recipe.  Dries out easily so check them before they're supposed to be done.  Nobody noticed they were splenda.
