Great southern-style recipe, but no need for potatoes and refrigerated canned biscuits work great for dumplings.  Adding the flour at the end to make the gravy is the key to this being a GREAT chicken and dumplings recipe.

Very good recipe.  My family (even my 15 month old!!) really liked it.  I made a few small modifications: used chicken breasts cut into bite-sized peices, only used 2 potatoes, threw in a few handfuls of frozen peas and a diced onion, subbed stock for water, and I threw in a pinch of poultry seasoning.  I also added a little marjoram to the Bisquick before cooking the dumplings. It was really really good.  Thanks for the recipe!!

An O.K. recipe. Takes lots of time, needs much more salt than the recipe indicates, and it makes a huge amount - more like 15 servings, definitely NOT 4!

This is a delicious recipe . . . and we enjoyed every bit of it!  I used chicken broth instead of water to cook the chicken.  Thank you!

Parboil 2 chicken breasts while broth is cooking, chop into pieces and drop into boiling broth, add canned veggies keep at low boil, make bisquick biscuits and spoon drop on top, cover for 8 min. flip biscuits and cover for another 3-4 min. served with a salad, this was a quick, delicious and hearty meal. served 6 with a little leftover.

I didn't really care much for this dish. I cut the potatoes down to three, and wished I had only used one. Toooo much potato/starch. Mine actually ended up a little dryer than I like them, after adding the dumplings with all the potatoes already in there... I say put this in the scratch file. Sorry....

Good recipe. Adding the dumplings makes its own gravy. There is no need to add the flour to thicken it.

Great recipe. I do suggest adding a can of mixed veggies and a small amount of seasoning, but other than that, perfect!

Awesome on a cold, wet Louisiana day!  Easy to make and very tasty.  I added a couple of chicken boullion cubes to my stew while I was cooking the chicken.  It gave it a more robust flavor.

Ok but needs more spice and to cook the chicken in another pan because they fell apart without it. Next time I'll try adding some thyme and rosemary as well as some chicken stock to add more flavor.

WONDERFUL! A friend who stopped by commented that it made the whole house smell delicious, and all three children (plus fussy hubby) devoured it and wanted more! I used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken since that's what I had, and it turned out beautifully.

This recipe was fantastic!  I had never made chicken & dumplings before but this recipe was very easy to follow.  I had enough to feed myself, my husband, my parents, and my grandfather.

This was the BEST!!!!  I have been looking for a good dumpling soup since Moses was a child, and I found it.  Thank you!!!!  We did not add the flour to the soup and it turned out fine.  We also found that using chicken breast instead of the whole Chicken was alot easier!!!  Again Thank You!!!!!

I give this 3 out of 5 stars because the instructions are lacking for someone trying for the first time to make dumplings!  Maybe someone who's done it before would know how long to cook them!  The recipe doesn't specify....  I used the canned biscuit mix like another reader suggested and perhaps that was my mistake, but after letting them cook for about 5-7 minutes, we pulled them out and they were uncooked in the middle.  Just doughy and gross.  We threw everything back in and cooked it longer and then when we served it the dumplings had all but disappeared in the broth!!  It was so disappointing.  I really would like to try this recipe again some time, not using canned biscuit dough--Please let me know what to do after I add the dough!!!

All I have to say is...Yum! After reading the other reviews, I didn't put potatos in and I added a couple different spices like garlic, celery seed (didn't have celery) and parsley to give it a little color.  For lack of having some of the ingredients I also added some frozen peas.  Came out awesome...almost like a pot pie stew!

Great recipe!
It looked so easy I was tempted to try it. I must admit I made a few changes. I cooked my vegis and chicken (I used bone-in chicken breasts) in the crockpot when almost done I moved them into a pot and added the dumplings. I didn't use the flour for thickening either. Tasted great. Thanks for making such an easy recipe!

This was really good. I put 2 chicken bouillon cubes in the boiling water. I agree that it needs more salt, but other than that it was yummy.

Not bad, but needed more "salt" and like others next time I make this I would add "chicken boullion" instead of water for more flavour!

My daughter was able to make this herself and she is only 12. Like another review said, the whole house smelled delicious! I had never heard of adding potatoes but they hit the spot! My daughter added a few more spices and chicken broth the second time she made it and it was still so great!

Very bland. I added probably close to a dozen bullion cubes and a canned of condensed cream of mushroom soup to get any sort of flavor, and then sprinkled parmasan cheese on top of each serving. It was still a very loose soup, not gravy like at all, not even after adding a can of condensed cream soup. Two thumbs down.

I give it 5 stars because its the closest I have found to truly homemade. Forget the boxes of msg laden, chemical ridden broths and use what you simmer your chicken in! You can't beat the fresh flavor. I add savory herbs with carrots, potatoes, celery, and lima beans and make my dumplings from scratch.

Very good but takes lots of time to get everything ready.  Make sure you use a good dumpling mix and make small dumplings, about 1/2 size of a cookie ball.

I cooked this for my friends and they have not stopped asking for it again since! It was a huge hit. I did substitute water for chicken broth for a little extra flavor. Wonderful dish! It makes great leftovers too!

Good base recipe... A few changes I made/would make in future: First of all, instead of using all water, I used half water and half chicken stock (the boxed kind). Next time I wouldn't use as much though, it turned out a little too soupy. Also, I knew it would have turned out pretty bland if I hadn't of thrown in some extra herbs and spices. I used: thyme, parsley, coriander, and a little extra seasoned salt - turned out wonderfully! As I said, this is a good base recipe to go off of, you just need to tweak it a little bit to suit your tastes!

Great base to start from. I have made this recipe a ton of times, but have altered the recipe to meet my family's tastes.

Very good. Someone else suggested using chicken broth, I did.  I think it may have been a little bland without it. I did use additional water to finish covering the chiken. I wish I hadn't. Two large boxes of Swanson broth was plenty.  Very good and easy recipe.

I felt this soup needed a lot more seasonings because without them, it was quite bland. Instead of thickening with the flour and water mixture, I mashed half of the potatoes. Cleaned out my fridge and threw in every leftover vegie I could find from this past weekend including chicken gravy. With these additions, it turned out quite delicious. Thanks for a good start tho.

It tastes really good, but it's a bit bland. Add more salt and pepper.

Definitely not a recipe for the Novice cook.  Forget the 40 min cooking time.  The carrots never got done and I cooked it for 1 hr and 40 minutes!  I was so dissappointed as this was my first time making chicken and dumplings.  I had way too much water stalk, and it was a huge pain to get the gravy to thicken up.  If you are making a flour paste for gravy, you don't need 2 parts water to 1 part flour, that defeats the purpose.  Just use enough water to make it a runny paste.  Next time I'll try a cream of soup recipe.
