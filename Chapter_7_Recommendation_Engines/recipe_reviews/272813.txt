Winner winner chicken and gnocchi dinner!  I made this before I realized who the recipe submitter was and it is no surprise this was a 5 star recipe. Her recipes are always great and this is just more proof. Simple yet bursting with flavor. Thanks for yet another great recipe Bren!

It was great I really liked the fact that there wasnâ€™t  cream added to it. I will make it again
