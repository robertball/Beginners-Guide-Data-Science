My mother makes a variation of this recipe. It is very similar but it has a bit more cheese and is seasoned well.  This recipe is missing the flavor.  We use 2 cups of cooked grits mix with 4 cups of cheeder cheese.  Add in 5 beaten eggs 2 tbsp of worchestire sauce, 1 tsp of Thyme, 1 tsp of garlic, and salt to taste.  Then add in 2 lbs of sausage.  It is great.  This one is good but a bit bland.

This recipe was a huge hit at a faculty breakfast.  The trick is to season the grits with lots of salt and butter until the grits taste good before adding the remaining ingredients.  After reading some of the reviews, I decided to use eight eggs, instead of (12).  I will definitely serve this dish again and again.

This was very good.  I threw it all in the crockpot once combined and it turned out great.  Made it again 2 weeks later and added crumbled bacon.  I think that was better than the sausage.

This is one of my familys favorites & we don't normally like grits.  I do, however, cut the eggs to 6 and the milk to 1/4 cup as IMO it's too eggy with 12.  But other than my personal taste, this casserole is a keeper.  My family eats it with a good shake of tobasco sauce - YUM!

I have made grits casserole as a Christmas tradition for two decades and my family agreed that this recipe was even better than the one I normally use.  I strongly recommend using stone-ground grits if you can find them; the difference is remarkable.

I made this recipe as written to serve 16 and I barely had a full spoon of left overs. I was feeding only 10 people and had 3 other large dishes just in case this one didnt workout. I prepared the recipe as listed and next time I will take the advice of other reviewers and half the amount of eggs from 12 to 6 a little too eggy for my liking. I also want to add something spicy like cayenne or red pepper flakes for a little heat. The GREAT part is that I was feeding a bunch of southern grits eaters and the dish was a huge hit at Easter Brunch. Old dogs can learn new tricks.

This is simply delish with the following changes (based on other reviews) I used bacon, one onion browned, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, 4 cups sharp cheddar, 8 eggs instead of 12, added milk to substitute some of the water, be sure to salt and get the grits tasty (with the sauces and spices if you choose) before adding all the ingredients together and instead of baking I put mine in crackpot to keep warm....FANTASTICO

For an easy potluck brunch dish, this is a winner. Got rave reviews and no leftovers! The key is to salt the boiling water before adding the grits. Once grits are cooked, you have to add tons of salt to get any flavor. Also, I accidently overscrambled the eggs, but adding a touch of milk to the casserole seemed to correct the problem

LOVED IT!! I grew up on grits! My husband grew up in the south too but has never really cared for grits. I made this for breakfast this morning he LOVED it as well. I made the servings for 4, added precooked bacon in place of the sausage, I just threw the cheese in (we're cheese lovers) and used 2 eggs instead of 3 and it turned out perfect. My husband even requested the leftovers for his breakfast tomorrow! Can't wait to try this with ham in it after the holidays. My 14month old even loved this.He kept asking for more and more! Thanks for the great recipe!!

My family LOVED this recipe, and a few who didn't think they liked grits were its biggest fans :)  I did make a few alterations; I really seasoned the water the grits were cooked in (salt & pepper) and added a small can of diced green chilies when I stirred the butter and cheese in.  I used bacon instead of sausage, but the bacon gets soft and is not as appealing, so I would definitely use sausage next time. When scrambling the eggs, I would leave them chunky so you would have discernible bites of egg in the casserole.  I also added a can of diced green chilies to the egg mixture, and used pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar.  The dish was medium-level spicy, but everyone loved it.  It doesn't re-heat (say in the microwave) with the same consistency because grits keep absorbing available moisture, so you need to cook and stir it in a pot on the stove top with a little added milk or butter to make it creamy again. VERY yummy, love love love it!

This was really good.  I did use egg beaters in place of the eggs as well as reduced fat sausage & cheese.  I also added some minced garlic & a can of green chiles.  Served this at brunch & everyone loved it.  They never even knew that I had "lightened" the recipe...and I didn't tell, either!

Very good breakfast casserole.  I recommend that the grits have a thick consistency before adding the other ingredients. Mine turned out a little runny, but the taste was good, nevertheless. Recommend for company.

I halved the recipe to decrease the portion size, except did use almost the whole pound of sausauge. Only mixed one raw egg into the grits to help them set-up. The rest of the eggs I scrambled separately (be sure to season them with salt and pepper).  I layered half the grits in bottom of a large oval slow cooker.  Added layer of cooked sausage, layer of scrambled egg, layered rest of grits and topped with the cheese. Left in slow cooker on low for 20 mins or so for the raw egg in the grits to cook and set-up. I was very pleased with the result.  Putting it all in a crock-pot was key to keeping the grits nice and creamy, and would work well for a brunch buffet, or if everyone can't sit down and eat together right when it comes out of the oven. Otherwise the grits will get cold and yucky. Layering the ingredients makes it look more like the above picture, and we liked being able to actually taste cooked scramble egg in the casserole. If not the egg just dissapears when you mix it raw into the grits. *Note- you must heavily salt the water when it comes to a boil before adding your grits! Otherwise, you will never get them salty enough. Taste them before building your casserole. They need to taste good on their own too. Only drawback to this recipe is the number of pots and pans that you have to dirty :(

Very good.  I too suggest cutting down on the eggs.  I also didn't scramble them beforehand, but mixed in with all the other ingredients last before putting it in the oven.  Some green pepper and onion sauteed with the sausage really adds to the flavor as well.

I'm giving this 4 stars because of the changes I made. But, with those changes, the opinion here is that it is 5-star dish. I used 8 eggs instead of 12. I added 2 Tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce and 1 teaspoon of garlic powder. I assembled the casserole, except for the last 1 cup of cheese, and then froze it. When it came time to serve it, I pulled it out of the freezer early in the morning and heated it in a 325 degree oven until warmed through. I put the final cup of cheese on top and put back in the oven for a few minutes until the cheese was melted. It's a definite keeper!

I made this without reading the reviews and everything cited was going to be in this review. Although I had the quick-cooking grits on hand, next time I would go for the stone ground or old-fashioned grits (healthier: higher glycemic index). Other healthier alternatives that I used were low fat cheese, turkey sausage, half the eggs, and low fat milk.

After several years of my mediocre breakfast casserole, I tried this recipe and FINALLY have a go-to recipe that everyone loves :) 
The first time I made it, I accidentally forgot to lightly scramble the eggs (just poured it in with the grits right before transferring to pan). It was AWESOME. The next time I did the scrambling step and was surprised I didn't like the texture as well. So I plan to always skip the scrambling step.
Also, I think sharp cheddar goes great in this recipe. The second time I used wahtever cheese was on hand (no sharp) and I could tell the flavor was a little different (but still really good!).
Love love love this :)

Very good! I made this for a MOPS meeting and everyone was raving. I used kielbasa (browned) instead of ground pork and 10 eggs. Agree with other reviewers that the key here is seasoning and I used a fairly heavy hand, adding onion & garlic powder and Tabasco generously.   I also prepared it the night before and baked the morning of so it would be hot for the meeting. I added a touch of milk before heating it up to ensure it wouldn't be dry.

Besides being pretty, my co-workers LOVED this for a breakfast potluck. It has now been added to my go-to list for meals everyone will eat!  I did think it was a little bland tasting the first time I made it, so I added a little very finely grated yellow onion to the sausage grease, cooked it until soft, and then added to the grits mixture. The trick is making sure the grits are seasoned well prior to adding anything to them. I prefer to add kosher salt to the boiling water (not sure why but they always seem to taste better).

I love this meal!  The recipe I use is very similar but uses smaller amounts and isn't nearly as bland as what this one is.  Mine has a few minor changes such as using beef bouillon instead of water.  I posted the recipe....look for Sausage Grits Casserole.  It's kind of unfair to rate a recipe and then list all the changes that one makes to make it a 5 star recipe so I gave this recipe only 3 stars for "needs improvement".

Love it, Love it, Love it! I used italian pork sausage and the spiciness added a wonderful unexpected zap! I made this for my family during a recent visit and everyone raved over it. I thought my brother was going to eat the whole pan! Will definitely make this again. We are from Alabama, so grits are a staple in our cupbards!

I've made this recipe twice. The first time, I halved it, and used only 4 eggs based on other reviews. I added a lot of garlic salt and hot sauce, because I wouldn't make any other egg casserole with out adding some seasonings. Also, I used a really delicious sausage that has bacon in it. I'm from Iowa, and we love our pork! My husband begged me to make it again. The second time I used all the eggs, and we didn't like it as well. So, a very good recipe, but we liked it better with a few alterations. We enjoyed trying something different than our regular breakfast casserole!

Great recipe!  I make it for dinner and my picky eater 14 year old eats 2 or 3 servings.  My only change to the recipe is I use 8 eggs.  The hubby loves it with lots of hot sauce!

Great casserole!! I used precooked sausage patties and just diced them up to speed up the process...worked great!

I halved the recipe.  Used turkey bacon instead of sausage (just what i had on hand), used 1 less egg than called for.  Season generously.  We loved it!!! I had more servings than I should have ;-)  Soooo good!

I used this as a base recipe and made a few subtle, yet amazing, alterations. I personally have never even tried grits so, this was a first for me. After simmering the grits I added butter, salt and pepper until it tasted good to me and then I added about 1 1/2 tsp sugar as well. Then, instead of 2 I added 3 cups of cheese and blended all that together. While I was browning the sausage I decided to chop 1/4 of an onion and add to it, along with 1 tsp minced garlic. After I mixed the meat mixture into the grits mixture I tasted it and decided to add 1 (4oz) can of chopped green chilies. With my own little alterations I have to say that this was amazingly delicious and I cannot believe I have not tried grits until now. But, glad I found this recipe, thank you.

Didn't change anything in this recipe. Was a test run for a huge family gathering coming up and my sister makes a version of this. However, her eggs are scrambled but added to the mixture raw and then baked. We liked the recipe very much and even when it got cold. The only thing negative I might add, is that I could have reduced the butter on the last step to half the amount it suggested. Because it was slightly oily. I used an 8x10 baking pan but could easily used an 11x13 because the ingredients were to the brim of the baking pan. It was nice to fix on the whim and was a great dinner when I didn't want to have anything traditional ;-) It's keeper.

The men in this household raved about this casserole. Season your grits and eggs as you cook them (prior to combining) and you will have a winner. I also added garlic powder, cut the eggs back to 8 and added bacon bits along with the cheese on top.

The foundation of this recipe is great but after reading the reviews, I decided to make a few changes.  I used Old Fashion Grits, Pepper Jack cheese instead of Cheddar, sweet Italian sausage instead of pork and 6 eggs instead of 12 and 1/4 cup of milk.  I also added some Tony's to my grits.  It was a HUGE hit!!!

So yummy!  Do yourself a favor prep cheese and cook sausage before you start the grits. I'm going to add bacon next.time. I also added chives on top

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!  I made this for my Sunday School class and everyone loved it! I even had a few tell me they've never like grits - until now. I reduced the eggs to eight, and accidentally doubled the butter.  Even with the extra butter, this dish was awesome.  Super easy and seems flexible depending on different appetites. (IE: more/less eggs, substitute ham or bacon for the sausage, different cheeses, etc...)  This one is definitely a keeper and I can't wait to try it with different ingredients!

These were a hit!  
I made this casserole for a ladies breakfast, and all the southern ladies dove right in!  Even the northerners ate it too!  
I had reduced the servings by 1/2 and it turned out wonderful.  I would however, add more cheese into the grits/sausage mixture.
This will be a keeper.  I've eaten some leftovers with a salad & roll for lunch.  This would make a nice light supper dish too!

Only my 3rd time ever cooking and tastes great, easy to make for beginners! Only 2nd time having grits. I used turkey meat for replacement of sausage!! I also added a lot of spice. I like the recipe.

This was a FABULOUS recipe! Seriously, SO good--definitely becoming a staple in our house! My husband loved it, too. However, I did make two small changes. One--I only made 8 eggs, because 12 seemed like too much, but I think in the end, it would have been fine. Eight seemed a little skimpy; the grits are very overpowering. Secondly, I only cooked it in the oven for 15 minutes and that came out great. I think 30 would have been too long--everything was already cooked separately and I didn't want burnt eggs, so. Anyway, it was great!

Loved this dish! To give the grits a little more flavor I ended up doing 3 cups water and 3 cups milk for the grits. And I also added a pound of turkey bacon. I fried the bacon and then shredded the bacon in a food processor. I also used turkey sausage instead of pork. I made my own turkey sausage. Its really easy.
 
My kids loved the dish and went back for thirds!

Quite tasty! Use a wooden (or other sturdy material) spoon for mixing.  I also recommend a Dutch oven rather than a saucepan. Also, I would recommend seasoning with salt and pepper as you mix in the scrambled eggs... a lot less messy.

Just out of oven all steamy and bubbly!   I made a few additions with seasoning.  But ingredients are great.  I did not add everything together but instead put layer of grits, then sausage (Italian sweet sausage), then eggs, remaining grits topped with cheese.  I used cheddar and mozzarella mixed.  I added salt, pepper, touch of garlic powder and some parsley.  Baked up perfectly.  Let it cool for 10 minutes.  Then...  OMG YUMMO!!!    Thanks for sharing!

I made this with a few changes. First, please , please don't make any kind of grits with just water ! It's a no no ! I use half milk and half water or broth .it makes grits 100 percent more creamy and way more flavorful.  I also seasoned as I went , instead of st the end.  The grits need salt while cooking so it absorbs into the grits. I also added onion for flavor and some crushed garlic.  I used 8 eggs instead of 12.  It came out great and the family loved it.  I'd make it again

I love grits! This recipe is nice because it can be easily altered to fit your taste. For creamer grits add sour cream, and for a little kick add a sm can diced green chili's. Very yummy and satisfying!

Very yummy dish...but as usual I didn't have all the ingredients so I improvised.  I omitted the meat and added sliced mushrooms and chopped onion.  I didn't have grits so used polenta, and didn't have cheddar so used monterey jack cheese.  I only used half the amount of eggs.  I can tell this would be very good as written and will try it that way when I have all the ingredients.

This is sooo yoummy! I just wanted to say to a previous reviewer that you are right when you say this dish is a bit time consumming. But in the south, a lot of times this is a dish that is normally made from leftovers. After a big breakfast of sausage, eggs and grits, and sometimes bacon, all is mixed up together and reheated as a casserole the next day. It is fantastic!

Best ever grits casserole!  The light scrambling of eggs prior to mixing into grits makes for great texture.  No doubt a 5 star recipe!  Thanks!

Easy, good enough to serve company for dinner with whole grilled sausages thrown on top, salade and/or roll.  Leftovers I used for breakfast.  Needs a bit more salt I think than recipe calls for.

I make breakfast for the crew on Saturdays.  Always looking for new ideas.  I've made this twice now and it's such a big hit.  The only changes I made was caramelizing a yellow onion and I added a small can of diced green chilies.  This is a keeper!  Thank you

It was raved about by co-workers for a "Farewell Breakfast".  y niece loved it and I used turkey sausage, (spicy).  I was just so-so about it, but apparently it was great to others.

When I cook grits, I use chicken broth instead of water, and add a little onion powder.  Makes world of difference.

Yum! I've made this several times because it's so easy and yummy. I typically use a Mexican cheese blend and spicy sausage, and add in a small can of green chilis to give it some kick. Delicious! Thanks for this one - it's already a go-to!

It was greasy, salty, and heavy. It seemed to have all the right elements, but they didn't total up to a good dish for us.

The taste is awesome, and I love grits and eggs very much, but the only issue I had was that it didn't set up very well.  I'd hoped to wrap "bars" to take with me to school for breakfast, eliminating the need for a container, but it's just too wet and won't hold a shape to do it.  I'll still  make it again, because I absolutely love how it tastes, and I need a good, non-Starbucks purchased breakfast :)  This was altogether less for 16 breakfasts than I pay for ONE at Starbucks :)

I just tried this and loved it.  I've been looking for a breakfast casserole for Christmas when my family will be at my house, and this is the recipe.  For my trial run, I added some chopped onions and bell peppers and it was delicious.  It's a good basic southern recipe, and I plan to serve it with a big fruit salad.

This is a huge hit everywhere I take it and everyone wants the recipe! I also cut the eggs down to 6,but kept the milk the same. I use monterey jack and sharp cheddar cheeses, added fresh garlic and a small can of green chilies. Gave it a nice pizazz! Nnever any leftovers! One of my favorites!

Family loved it.So simple, but so good.  You can alter it to suite your family's tastes.  I tried it as written and it was super.  I change it up a little every time I make it.

We didn't care for this.  It was no easier or more convenient than one of our regular Sunday breakfasts which serves the cheese grits, scrambled eggs and sausage separately. I thought doing this in casserole form would make it easier while being just as tasty for my family of hearty eaters.  Couldn't have been more wrong.  Having to cook the grits and sausage before hand didn't save ANY prep time at all and the finished product was barely edible.  No one in my family had seconds which is a VERY bad sign.  I will not be making this recipe again.

Prepared this for a church breakfast and followed recommendations of other reviews. Works really well in  crock pot to keep dish hot. Also used bacon and only 8 eggs.  It was a hit and had just enough left-over to bring some home to hungry teen-age son.

Delecious! I made for a group of friends who had never eaten grits and they all loved it. I only used 7 eggs and about 1/4 cup of milk based on other reviews. Other than that I made as written. I also seasoned my grits before mixing with other ingredients.

I've made this recipe on Christmas morning every year for the past 5 years. This Christmas will be no different! All of my children's grandparents and cousins and aunts /uncle come over and everyone loves it and looks forward to it every year! Takes me a little longer than an hour as the prep and cook time states, but it's worth every second extra.

This was fantastic!  The texture and flavor are so much better than an egg casserole that uses bread or croutons and I think the leftovers will keep better as well.  I used 10 eggs instead of 12 (simply because that was all I had) and it turned out just fine.  Took the advice of the other reviews to make sure the grits were seasoned to my family's taste before I mixed them with the other ingredients, I think that probably made a big difference.  You could season with whatever flavors you enjoy.  I did simply salt, pepper and tabasco.

Made this for my family and they loved it. I have small children so cut recipe in half. I used half the number of eggs rec'd. Season the grits as you usually would. Had some extra sharp white cheddar left over from Christmas and added some of that as well along with some dry mustard.

I make this in the morning when all the men are out hunting and keep it in the oven so when they come in at different times it is warm and I'm not in the kitchen all morning.  I also add a can of green chili peppers.  Give's it a little more flavor.

My husband is from the south and he loves grits. He usually only eats grits with a bit of cheese so I thought I'd surprise him by making this recipe for him. He absolutely loved it! I prepared all of the ingredients in the morning and let the casserole sit in the fridge until lunch time. My oven tends to cook things slightly faster and I found the casserole was good and brown in just 15 minutes. My husband gave this casserole his highest rating. This one is a keeper!

Even though the flavor of this dish is good,it was time consuming to make. After making the grits,sausage and scrambled eggs in pans separately,it seemed silly to mix together and dirty another dish,then wait for it to bake. Maybe I was just hungry.

Very good a big hit at the office. I did make a few changes however.I use light velveta rather than cheddar and topped with pilsbury biscuits. I then adjust the oven temp and cooking time to that suggested in the biscuit directions. Serve with homemade jam or preserves on the side.

This was good, quick recipe, and if you like grits, you will love this.  I cut the recipe in half, and it turned out well.  The grits were light and fluffy with a buttery taste to it, and it kept hot for a while (so it's good for brunches and the like).  In place of the sausage, I used some leftover ham steaks that I had fried up. Thanks for the recipe!

I was a little disappointed in this.  It was okay, but not as good as I'd hoped it would be.  I halved the recipe for four people and still had enough for one of my guests to take home, and for us to eat the next day.  It makes a LOT!

This quickly became a family favorite. I was even asked to make it for Christmas morning, foregoing a 25 year tradition of serving a different egg casserole.  People not fond of grits like it, and leftovers are great.  My youngest daughter claims it is even better the second time around.

This was a good recipe, it tasted like cheese grits with sausage in them, but not something I would call extraordinary.  The only warning is that is completely fills a 9x13 pan and it is alot of food, so scale down the recipe if you are making this for only a few people.

Good flavor but very greasy. Next time I'll use turkey sausage and one less cup of cheese. Be careful because this will fill your casserole dish to near spilling out.

I  made this for Christmas breakfast along with another yummy  casserole dish . I used Jimmy Dean sausage which 
has a lot of flavor and pepper jack cheese . This I think  made
this dish a hit with my family. I will make again.

I totally messed this up and it still turned out great! I salted the boiling water twice by mistake, layered ingredients in the baking pan instead of mixing, and used only 6 eggs because I forgot to buy more. Also chose the wrong pan and had to use 2 pans to accommodate, it makes so much! This was really good, thank you Miss Ella!

Made it for 6 people and cooked it the next morning. Delicious.  My mistake was not buying a national brand of sausage, so I had to doctor it up. Other than that, I will definitely  make it again.

I halved this recipe for just the two of us.  USING 4 EGGS, fits perfectly in a 8x8x2.25” casserole dish.  I salted water for the grits liberally, as some have said, get the grits to your taste and all will be well!  My husband raved about it, and we will have enough left for tomorrow’s breakfast IF it reheats well.  I think I will use the oven rather than the microwave.   Now, will I tweak the recipe next time with jalapeños?  Chopped tomato?  Rotello? 
It’s so good just the way it is...

I think it's probably a good idea to say "cook the grits according to package instructions," because there are many different kinds requiring different cooking methods.  I'm not too familiar with grits, and my  2 cups of grits in 6 cups of water were still crunchy and not close to done in 5 minutes.  It took a LOT more time and effort, and, long story short, the whole pan (minus 2 portions) ended up in the trash.  A waste of good ingredients, sadly.

I've been eating grits for decades but mostly plain.   I made this for a brunch and it was a big hit.  I followed suggestions of other reviewers and cut the eggs to 8.  I cooked the grits in half chicken broth, half water and a little milk.  As suggested, I heavily salted the water and made sure the grits tasted good on their own before adding the sausage and eggs.  I very lightly scrambled them and the texture was perfect.  As one reviewer suggested I added a little shaved onion and garlic powder. 
I baked itin a 9 x 13" pan .  This is definitely a keeper.

I made this for two different occasions—one for a celebration at work, and for a special coffee hour at church when our bishop was visiting. I made it just as the recipe states, but here’s some great news—-both tines I made it the night before, and baked it the next morning!  Turned out great, and it got RAVE reviews from both gatherings!!  The scrambled eggs really lighten up the grits, which can be a little heavy. And the cheese and sausage provide great flavor!

As the recipe is written I give 4 stars provided you are using a well seasoned sausage. The 1st time I made this I followed the recipe exactly and it was good but I knew I'd play around with it to make it better, at least for us.  1st major change is how I prepare grits. I normally use milk for breakfast dishes and chicken stock for savory dishes. For this one I used half milk/half chicken stock. 2nd major change, I did not drain the sausage instead using the drippings in place of the butter. I added garlic and onion powder. I added seasonings after combining the grits and sausage because I did not want it too salty.  I then stirred in softly scrambled eggs and cheese. Put in the fridge for the night and baked in the AM. Yummy!

I make this recipe whenever I need a breakfast casserole as it is fabulous every time.  I eat the leftovers (if there even are any!) for dinner.  I know a lot of these reviews have ‘fixed’ the recipe but it is tasty AS IS!  It’s a winner every time!

Wonderful blend of flavors and definitely on the comfort food list! I made it as recipe is written and it is delicious! I gave it a four star because of prep time as there is no way I could make it in 15 minutes since grits must be stirred constantly to prevent clumping, sausage had to be cooked, and eggs had to be constantly stirred to maintain soft scramble, cheese had to be stirred and melted, etc, and then all combined. Will definitely make again and will try Velveeta jalapeño for extra spice and easier blending.

I made this for my husband and he absolutely loves it. I bake it in a casserole dish and he takes whatever he wants for breakfast. Fast and easy for me and delicious for him.  I think I will try bacon instead of sausage the next time but either way, he will love it.

I changed it up a bit although I liked the original ingredients. I used 7 eggs instead of 12. I added green onions across the top, and Mrs.Dash spicy to jazz it up a bit. I also put the egg mixture into the oven without scrambling them first because I feared they would become too dry. It turned out great! I’ll definitely make it again.

“LIGHTLY SCRAMBLE...” to me means to mix or stir lightly.  It did not mean lightly cooked! I wish it had read, “Cook and lightly scramble until almost well done... “  Shucks, I wish I’d watched the video 1st and then read the instructions.   I added a DOZEN RAW EGGS TO INGREDIENTS!!!  To fix this, I’ve thrown it back in the oven covered with foil to bake another 50 minutes.   It’s no wonder my casserole was all shaky!!!

Added more salt and butter to the grits like told.  Cut in half for a 8x8 dish since it was just 3 of us for breakfast. Served with hot sauce for those who like a little kick. Thanks for sharing.

This is a great foundational recipe -- as-is, or with added veggies.  It keeps well and can be breakfast for several days by-the-serving.  Salsa is a great topper.  I'm adding chopped fresh spinach, onions, sliced mushrooms today.

OMG!! Ok so I decided to make this for Sunday Funday breakfast since it is comprised of all the things we eat for breakfast anyway and it was soooo good. I also seasoned the grits the way we normally would and added some butter. This came out so good!

I made this recipe for my husband to take for a breakfast meeting. After reading several reviews, I took the advice to taste & season the grits before adding the cheese and sausage.  A few splashes of tabasco was added and Italian sausage was used (picked up the wrong package). Lots of good flavors came together.  This recipe is a keeper for the holidays.

I like 1/2 milk 1/2 water
I also add a tablespoon of garlic powder and a splash of Worcester sauce. 
Salt the heck out of the Grits!  Makes a huge difference!
Thickens up overnight in the fridge.  
Makes a lot!  13 X 9 pan fills up.  Leftovers are incredible and easy to microwave.

No changes except I mixed grits and sausage in large baking pan and poured eggs and milk mixture over without starting in skillet; added 10 minutes to cooking time. Pretty dish, very tasty.

Next day - made again. used Pepper Jack when I mixed cheese in the grits. Game changer. Used sharp cheddar on top. That's really the only difference. It was excellent the first go around and unbelievable the second time.

Made this for a weekend at friends’ lakehouse and it was a hit.  I made a few modifications: used slow cooking grits, increased cheese to 4 cups extra sharp cheddar, increased sausage (used hot breakfast style) to 1.5 #; and added some crispy thick cut bacon.  I also added a few shakes of hot sauce. Per other suggestions I reduced the eggs to 8 and next time I think I’ll increase to 10. I prepped the day before and poured it into a large covered baking dish. Did not dot with butter. Next day I popped it in the oven covered. People went back for seconds. Love the fact it’s gluten free!

This was great served with collard greens for dinner.  The only change I made was adding 1 tbsp of chicken base to the water for the grits.  Excellent recipe!  Going to add some maple syrup and eat it again for breakfast.

This is a wonderful recipe as is but, a little bland. I followed some suggestions and only used 8 eggs and I took the time to season the grits with salt and butter before adding the cheese and sausage. I have never had grits until I tried this recipe for the first time and it turns out I really enjoy grits. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Used the proportions stated, but added sautéed veggies in 1 TBS olive oil: 2 large cloves fresh garlic sautéed 20 seconds, whole diced sweet onion added for 5 minutes, whole sweet pepper & 1 seeded jalapeño for another 3 minutes,  which leave them with just enough crunch after baking to add contrast to each bight. Used small cubes from a sharp cheddar cheese block only because I didn't feel like shredding. 

Delicious! Thank you for such a great base to which all manner of taste ideas can be added!

I read the very useful reviews, then made a half recipe.  I baked it for 25 minutes, but 30 minutes for a half recipe would work.

I used a commercially available spice blend of; salt, black pepper and garlic.   

The next time that I make this, I'll add even more House Blend and onions.

I made this exactly as directed. I always  do that with a new recipe so I can know what it's supposed to be like. I was a little disappointed because it didn't have enough flavor. Next time I'll add some chili powder or hot sauce or something to spice it up a bit. It was also greasier than I l expected, so next time I plan on using reduced fat cheese.  Overall you can't go wrong with these ingredients though.  Pretty darn good!

Only change I made was to cut recipe in half.  Definitely not worth the time to make this one.  My husband and I easily came to the conclusion that we would rather eat our grits,  eggs and pork sausage separately...and with a lot less fuss.

I had a doz egg whites left over from preserving yolks and some vegan sausage.  I'm not vegan but it was great and everyone can eat it if you use GF grits.

If I could give it  4+ star I would.  It didn't have enough seasoning for us but for a couple with young kids it might make a great dinner.

We loved it. I took Cheri's recommendation and added thyme and Worcester sauce. I think without those additions it would have been bland. I also reduced the eggs to 8. Next time I'll try it with bacon.

It is very good, but I fail to see the point of making a casserole if I have to cook each ingredient separately first. I would just as soon have a lovely plate with sausage, scrambled eggs and grits arranged attractively on the plate. But maybe that's just me.

This is delicious! I made the grits the way I usually do (I used finer ground polenta and cook in chicken broth and milk. When adding the butter and cheese once it's not watery I also add some sour cream, salt, pepper and garlic powder) I baked 20 minutes in a convection oven. Let it sit to set up for awhile if you want it to serve it in a solid piece. Or if you can't wait, spoon it immediately for casserole like goodness. This would be perfect for a group brunch!

Great brunch dish. I followed some of the suggestions and added salt and pepper,  and minced garlic to the water before bringing it to a boil.  Cooked it on low in my crock pot until we were ready to eat. At least 2 hours.

I made this last week for DH and myself. I love grits, DH hates grits. So I was truly surprised when he said he liked it! He even said it was a "do againer"! I never did tell him there were grits in there, although I think the texture would have been a dead give away. Anyway, having said all that, the recipes was terrific as written, hubby was happy and I am secretly enjoying the fact that I got him to eat grits!

I made this Christmas  morning and it was great!   I cut everything  in half and it was more than enough for the 3 of us.  Contrary to others, I thought the amount of egg was good.  I did think it could have used a little more sausage.  I will  definitely  make this again.

This was a tasty dish.  Made it for Christmas Day.  I followed others advice and cut the eggs to 8.  Added some herbs to the sausage and cheesy grits for a little extra flavor.  Put some crumbled bacon in as well.  I think the butter on top before baking added unnecessary calories.  I will leave that off if I make it again.  My husband said this was good, but it was a lot of work for basically a regular breakfast of eggs, sausage and grits.  I supposed he is right, but the redeeming factor is that you can feed a crowd and it is all done at the same time.

This was really good. I gave it only four stars because the recipe didn't include how much salt/pep to use. The grits need to be salted while cooking. I added 1/2 tsp and it was not enough! So, I over salted the eggs to make up for it. That did the trick. 

Because I knew my morning would be too busy, I threw all the ingredients in the crockpot on warm the night before and then bumped it up to high for an hour in the morning. I also used only 8 eggs. I did not scramble them before adding them to the crockpot. I only used half the butter. It turned out great!

Definitely great flavor, I'm from the south and this is breakfast! I invite family over for breakfast every Friday and this is requested a lot. Only thing is that I've attempted this twice and feel like I'm doing something wrong. I thought that it should be thicker, more solid. But both times I just got normal grits with eggs, sausage, etc mixed in. Nothing wrong with that at all, just not what I was expecting.

I thought this was really delicious!!  I did 8 eggs instead of 12 per other comments but wish I had done 12.  Also, next time, I wouldn't add the butter to the top.  It made it a tad too rich.  Easy recipe!

Made it the night before Christmas put it in the fridge overnight and cooked it a little longer and it still came out wonderful. Only thing I changed was I added salt to the water I boiled the grits in and Asiago cheese to the top after it came out of the oven. Everyone loved it Christmas morning.

Big hit for brunch. I used bacon instead of sausage. Added a few drops of hot sauce to the grits before mixing everything together. Only added 8 eggs because it was all I had.  Held up great on the buffet table. I will make this again and again.

Made for 20, but used three lbs of sausage (one HOT pork and two breakfast turkey) that I had cooked the night before.  I had "odds and ends" from a cheese plate (brie-cut off rind, gouda, white cheddar, orange cheddar & bleu) and I mixed ALL of it  with the grits. I also added two small cans of diced green chiles, and sauteed chopped-up onion. I assembled all into a big crock-pot and never put in the oven.  It was a definite crowd-pleaser!

Just made this and it was really good, a keeper. I added onions & garlic to the sausage and a handful of Pecorino Ramano cheese along with sharp cheddar to the grits.I tasted the grits several times to make sure they were seasoned properly before adding the eggs. I only made a 1/2 recipe using 4 eggs because My husband doesn't like grits at all and didn't want me to make this. Good thing I don't listen to him, he loved it and said make sure to keep that recipe!

I might slightly decrease the amount of grits, but this is a delicious dish.  To help reduce the fat content, I used a stick of I Can't Believe It's Butter, 2% milk shredded cheese, and skim milk.

My husband HATED grits, until I made this for him.  Now he eats it all the time!  I love this recipe.  It's chock full of great southern flavor (fattening!  ;)) and was a real hit at my house.  I made a large batch of grits the day before for breakfast, so I just went ahead and used the saved grits for this meal (to lighten my load) and it still tasted superb!  Great recipe!

Very good!  Brought it to a Christmas party and was asked several times for the recipe.  Will most likely make again and it is fairly easy to make.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was great, but I prefer just plain old grits...

This was good. I substituted the ground pork sausage with ground turkey sausage.
