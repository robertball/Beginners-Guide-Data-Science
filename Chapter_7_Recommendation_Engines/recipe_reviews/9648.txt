Ok... here are the secrets to making this recipe good.  First, you have to toast the almonds.  This brings out the flavor.  Just toast them in the 350 oven for about 7 minutes, let them cool, and then grind them as instructed.  I added more almonds as was recommended, but if you do I would cut back on the flour.  Second, these cookies are basically pecan shortbread cookies, so like all shortbread cookies they should be rolled out, cut/stamped out, and then baked as instructed.  The other reviews were right they dont spread, but neither do rolled out shortbread cookies.  Third, I think that 400 degrees is too hot to bake these cookies.  Mine were pale white on the top and dark brown on the bottom.  They still taste great, but I think you will get a better browning by baking them at 350F.  Hope this helps.

After reading the reviews, I altered mine.

I used double the almonds (1 full cup ground). I used 2 teaspoons almond extract and 1/2 teaspoon hazelnut extract instead of amaretto (which I didn't have). The cookies are very tasty! NOTE: These cookies DO NOT SPREAD. Whatever shape they're in when you put them on the sheet is the shape they'll wind up in, so be sure it's an aesthetically pleasant shape! And that two inches apart is silly; I fit 24 cookies per sheet with great success. An excellent little cookie!

I LOVE these cookies.  They are a great little treat and if you love almonds you'll love their flavor.  I made these for a Christmas party and they did not last past the first half hour.

I didn't have amoretto so I used almond extract, approx 1 1/2 tsp (I just poured it in LOL)   They do not spread but I liked this fact. I scooped the dough up with a teaspon then rolled it into balls I got about 18 on a small cookie sheet.  Then I used sliced almonds and pressed them into the middle.  These made little half dollar size cookies that are wonderful!!!

I think next time I will try making it with Splenda for a low sugar version that even my diabetic brother in law can eat.  Thanks for sharing this!!

Following advice from others, I toasted the almonds - 3-4 min at 375F, doubled the almonds in the original recipe and cut the flour to 1 cup. I also added about 1/2 tsp cardamom for a little different flavor. I baked them at 375 for about 12 mins, though I might let them go a little longer next time. (I made the cookies larger so longer bake time needed - yield 18).

Very tasty cookies. I didn't have armaretto liquer so I used Kahlua instead. Turned out wonderfully. I also decorated with a raw blanched almond on top of each cookie. Makes wonderful presentation.
Don't worry about not finding ground almond in the grocery store. I ground mine with a coffee grinder--very convenient and fresh.

This recipe was extremely easy and quick. The cookies turn out very light on the top, but watch the bottom so that it doesn't burn. I doubled the amaretto and it added a bit more flavor, but they were good with just two tsp as well.

They were delicious.  I had to increase the batter because I wanted more cookies.  I also used pure almond extract instead of Amaretto.  I also dusted them with a sprinkle of powdered sugar/cinnamon mixture.  They looked too boring as is.  Overall, very good!

I used half whole white wheat flour and half unbleached flour, baked at 350 for 8 minutes, used amaretto, vanilla (1t), and almond extract (2t), toasted my almonds, and added extra sugar. Cookie was still not very sweet or flavorful. Not like the ones at Chinese restaurants, mmm. The thinner cookies tasted better, lighter, so making them thin is my suggestion.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I used my coffee bean grinder to grind my almonds, and used Amaretto as directed.  They didn't spread at all, though I hadn't expected them to, since I had read other reviews.  The first pan, I left in the shape of the spoon.  The second pan, I flattened with a fork dipped in granulated sugar (like you would a peanut butter cookie).  They aren't bad - but they are not what I was expecting - they don't have enough almond flavoring, though I wouldn't call them bland.  I am going to try dipping some of them in chocolate.  
Also, I believe that the alcohol cooks out of them in the 400 degree oven, so I think they are fine for children.
I am not sure if I will make these again.

I also tweaked the recipe according to other reviewers. 3 tsp almond extract, 3/4 cup almond meal, and 1 cup flour. I found that refrigerating the dough and then making little balls helped make these cookies prettier. I finished them off with powdered sugar and shared them as holiday cookies. My young kids loved these. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

These cookies are amazing!!!  I didn't have any amaretto liqueur so I used almond extract instead. I added 1/2 cup of canola oil instead of butter and they came out crumbly and delicious!  As one reviewer suggested I toasted the almonds before grinding them.  I increased almonds to 3/4 of a cup and decreased flour to 1 cup.  I flattened the cookies slightly with a fork before baking.  They baked great at 350 for 15 min.  I think next time I will try adding mini chocolate chips.  Chocolate and almonds, you can't go wrong with that combination.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe.

So delicious! I used two tsp of almond extract, brown sugar, a tiny bit of baking powder, and spiced it with a little cinnamon. Very yummy.

Ground the almonds in a food processor, used Kahlua instead of Amaretto (which does affect the taste, I imagine, but it was good), and used only 1 cup of flour. My cookies spread...

Light and crisp with a delicate crunch, the center is slightly chewy and the almond flavoring gives a delightful aroma when baked.  I gave them an egg white wash and they glistened!  Easy and quick to make, they will become a regular.  I used half butter and half crisco - they turned out simply delicious!

I gave this recipe a 5 star overall rating, but it wasn't what I was expecting.  The cookies turned out small, and the really young kids didn't want to try them because they didn't look like a typical cookie (they came out in the same shape they had when dropped on the cookie sheet, not round or flat).  But everyone who tried them loved them.  I adore almonds, and with this being so easy to mix with such few ingredients, plus a baking time of 5 minutes, this will be used many times over.

Simple yet delicious!  I followed others reviews and used 3/4 cup almond meal and 1 cup of flour.  Also added an easy glaze made from powdered sugar and almond extract. Cookies do need to be very small to get 24 out of the batch though.

I used blanched almond flour, I toasted them and used 1 cup, I cut back the flour to 1/2 cup and used vanilla instead of amaretto.  I too reduced the heat to 350 F and baked for 10-12 mins.  They were perfect!!  I topped them with a single almond each!

Don't over-think it - these are easy to make, tasty cookies.  If you want them to come out looking like they're ready for a magazine shoot, sure, go ahead and roll out the dough.  Mine spread a little bit anyhow...

My husband and I loved these cookies. I used 1 1/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour and 3/4 cup ground almonds and 3 Tbsp of Chocolate Amaretto Liqueur (that's what I had).  And as others suggested I rolled dough into balls sprinkled tops with a bit of sugar and pressed with a fork.

The recipe turned out pretty well, but I would recommend adding cinnamon and vanilla extract to bring out the natural nutty, bittery-sweet taste. All in all, loved the cookies! I used a sugar substitute to cut down on calories, which made the cookies a bit sweeter than I expected, but the addition of cinnamon really came through.

I followed some of the reivews and changed the recipe accordingly:  substituted 2 t amaretto with 2 t almond extract  used 1 C ground almonds  toasted almonds before grinding  baked cookies at 350 for ~8 min  I couldn't find ground almonds in the store, and I don't have a coffee grinder (more of a tea drinker), so I used a mini food processor on the dull blade setting to grind the almonds after toasting.  The almonds came out as kind of a crumb size- not extremely fine like flour.  Perhaps for this reason I was not able to roll out the dough and shape the cookies as others have described.  I had to use the full amount of flour in the original recipe and scooped the dough into balls on the baking pan.  The batter was too sticky to roll, and the cookies ended up being chewy and not crunchy.   Added some un-toasted almond slices to the tops of the cookies before baking.  Perhaps next time I would add another 1/2 t or so of almond extract.  I didn't mind having my cookies turn out softer and not cookie-cutter shaped, but for those who can't grind their almonds down to a fine powder, you might be faced with the same scenario.  Still tastes good!

Not what I expected. I used almond extract instead of amaretto and I did not like the flavor it added to the cookies. To me, it didn't taste like almonds at all.

These were great almond cookies and so easy to make.  I took a teaspoon of dough, rolled it in a ball, placed it down on parchment paper and flatened it into a dollar shape with my thumb.  I placed half a marishino cherry in the center of it.  With my gas oven, I found cooking on 375 for 15 minutes worked best.

I am generally not a big fan of cookies, but these were great!! I took the advice of some of the other reviews and increased the ground almonds to 3/4 cup and decreased the flour to 1 cup. I used pure almond extract and I think next time I will increase that to 3 teaspoons. I made these cookies 3 days ago and they are all gone, so I will be making more today! :)

These cookies were excellent! I took the advice of another reviewer who said they don't spread and rolled them into little balls and then pressed them flat. I also pressed a couple of sliced almonds into the top of each before baking and then sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar when they came out of the oven. My hubby called them "almond snickerdoodles" and we devoured the whole batch before the evening was over. Definately will be making these again and again!

I just made these cookies and they are pretty good. As I am only 18, I could not purchase the liquor to put in them so I used almond extract instead(about 2 tsp). I took advice from other reviews and lowered the heat to 350 and baked for about 9 minutes.  I also reduced the flour to a bit more 1 cup and added cinnamon for some extra flavoring. My whole house smells like almonds now and I love it! These cookies look plain but taste delicious. I will definitely be making these again.

Followed the recipe to the T and was not impressed.  I felt it needed more of an almond taste...2nd batch I made I added a little almond extract and a tablespoon more butter and flour with a pinch of salt...more of what I liked. But still a simple good recipe

Not enough almond flavor. I made a 2nd batch and replaced the amaretto with 1/4 tsp. almond extract.

I also didn't find the dough thin enough to cook through at that temperature and time.

I used almond extract instead of amaretto, and it was too strong in the cookies. They were still pretty good, next time I'll use amaretto or less extract.

I loved this too!  What I did differently, was shape the cookies into half moon shaped- and baked at 350.
I have tried similar cookies that were Iced.  Therefore, I iced about a dozen with powdered sugar Icing that I made, and added a little Almond extract.  I took the other dozen cookies and dredged in powdered sugar when they were warm.  Yummy!!  You can't eat just one...

Doubled the amount of almonds,  used raspberry vodka instead of the amaretto liqueur, added vanilla extract and dipped in hardening chocolate (after they were baked). Great cookie

I have to admit I added a little almond extract.  But I gave this overall a 2.  I didn't like these cookies and they were really bland.  I will not make these cookies again but will continue to look for a good recipe of almond cookies.

I toasted the almonds before I ground them & used 1/2 t almond extract because I didn't have Amaretto. I doubled the recipe & it made 3 dozen small to medium cookies. I topped each with a toasted almond. I think I'd love them even more with a dusting of powdered sugar or a drizzle of powdered sugar glaze with a drop of almond flavoring.

I made some changes based on other reviews, and these cookies were awesome.  I toasted about 4 ounces of sliced almonds then ground them in my food processor which gave me about 1 cup of ground almonds.  I also decreased the flour to 1 cup. I used a small scoop to portion out the dough which gave me 24 cookies then flattened them with the bottom of a glass dipped in white sugar. I then sprinkled them with sliced almonds which I pressed down lightly.  My cookies did spread a little so definitely space them out at least an inch apart.  They came out perfectly with just enough sweetness and a little chewiness. I will definitely be making these again.

Almost perfect dough...
However it was a bit too loose for my taste. I had to add a few extra hearty dashes of flour for me to roll them without them being soooo gooey. Also I'm an adventurous baker... I omitted the amaretto mostly cuz we didn't have any. Added vanilla extract, rolled them all in cocout (they didn't need an egg wash cuz they were still pretty sticky) and made half of them coconut vanilla almond raspberry thumbprints by thumbing a shallow hole in the middle of each cookie and adding a half tsp of raspberry preserves inside! YUM YUM

I really was craving a delicious almond cookie.  I followed all the directions from the reviewers to achieve that end.  I increased the almond meal, I increased the amaretto, I toasted the almonds, I put a whole blanched almond in the middle of each cookie. I decreased the heat a bit.  But you know what? mediocre.  Yes, I will eat them, but would not make them again. I want a scrumptious almond cookie!!! Boo hoo....

Good flavor. Could be a little sweeter, but great if you toast the almonds prior to adding. Also, I dipped them in melted semi-sweet to add a little flair. Thanks!

I just pulled these out of the oven.  This was such a simple recipe.  Once everything was mixed together, I kept thinking I was forgetting something, but I wasn't.  Simple, simple, simple.  I, too, did not have amaretto, so I substituted almond extract.  Considering that my spatial ability sucks (not thinking one tiny little teaspoon was enough dough), the cookies turned out very well.  I also doubled the recipe - allowing me to make a bit bigger cookies.  All in all, an excellent and yummy recipe.

These are fantastic. Used almond or amaretto extract instead of liquor. Toasted the almonds as everyone said. I've made these about 4 times now and everytime they go quickly. Place the three almonds on top for deco and presentation is complete.

I followed the recipe exactly since it was the first time I made these cookies and they weren't bad.  They had a nice mild flavor.  I think next time I will follow the advice of others and add a bit more amaretto and toast my almonds to bring out the flavor a bit more since that is what I am after.  They also weren't exactly a pretty cookie, perhaps they could be rolled into balls and pressed down with a fork to give them a nicer shape?  They are definitely worth trying again.

I also had to lower the temperature to get these to cook through without burning the bottoms.  Toasted the almonds to bring out the flavor better.  Recipe has too much flour so cookies are dry. I started with the Ammeretto but after tasting added an additional teaspoon of Almond extract and the flavor still wasn't quite strong enough.

These were very good and had a nice almond flavor.  I made a few changes to make them more healthy, which in turn may have caused them to spread out when they were cooked. Instead of all-purpose flour, I used one cup of whole wheat pastry flour and 1/4 cup of almond meal flour.  Both of these can be found in health food stores.  I didn't have any amaretto liqueur, so I used 3 teaspoons of almond extract. I used a tablespoon to scoop out the dough. After I put the scoop of dough on the cookie sheet, I then pressed a whole almond into the middle of it. Then I baked them at 350 degrees for 8 minutes until they got brown around the edges.

This recipe was definitely easy and great texture, though maybe a little shy on almond flavor... so I took my sons medicine dropper and added a few drops of 'Disaronno Italian Liquer' (Amaretto) on each cookie - YUM!  Everyone LOVED them.  Please remember though that this must be 'Adults Only' cookies due to the alcohol.

I added an extra Tsp of amaretto and a tsp of almond extract and they were still a little on the boring side for me. I didnt dislike them by any means but I don't think i will make again. Also, I flattened the 1st tray with a fork before putting in the oven and didnt flatten the 2nd tray. The ones that I flattened turned out much prettier and symmetrical. I put in the oven for 4 minutes 30 seconds and they were perfect. Otherwise, i think they would have been boring And dry.

Tastes like an almond shortboard cookie - used almond extract in place of the alcohol because I didn't have any.

If you love the flavor of almonds, you will heart this recipe. This aromatic, almond cookie comes together quickly and bakes even faster. The most difficult part is: what to drink with these cookies?! :) Almond flavor truly is delicious, even better than vanilla at times.

Way too sweet. Cut the sugar in half and reduce the flour as well by one third. I also added a teaspoon of almond extract in addition to the amaretto. Of course, toast the almonds first. Not a pretty cookie either.

This recipe is a good start! I followed the suggestions by increasing the amount of crushed almonds, added a tablespoon of the amaretto instead of the 2teaspoons, I also added a tablespoon of shortening to soften the dough. Then I doubled the recipe and baked them at 350F. I was going to share the cookies with the neighbors, but I think my husband will consume them all before that.

Great simple, quick recipe!  I did not have any amaretto on hand so I did 2 tsp's of vanilla and I added choc chips to some of the cookies!  I did a pinch of baking powder as well and I flattened the cookie with a fork before baking.

this was just what I was looking for! almond-y, just the right amount of sweetness, soft, but not chewy, not crumbly but still buttery rich!

I used almond extract instead of amaretto and formed cookies on sheet. I made some about 1 1/2 in diameter and some just larger than a quarter- true silver dollar for my 3 year year old. I used Trader Joe's almond meal to make my life easier- and cause i had it on hand.

new family fave- and they were so quick to make.

Oh & i baked at 400 for about 6-7 minutes, delish!

FYI-These are not the Chinese almond cookies- those ones are usually made with lard and a LOT more sugar,

I wanted a nice almond cookie and that's what this recipe gave me.  Not too sweet, which I like.  Other reviews are correct - these don't spread (and I'm glad).  I would have given this a higher rating, but the yield on the recipe is totally incorrect.  You don't get anywhere near 4 dozen!  I got a a few cookies over 2 dozen.  Don't shy away from this recipe if you don't have the amaretto - I used vanilla and they came out great.  I toasted the almonds and increased to 1 full cup.  I did NOT cut back on flour as other reviewers did.

These are the perfect cookies to impress! Excellent flavor and really pretty. I toasted my sliced almonds before grinding them in the food processor. I used 2 tsp. of almond extract as a substitute for the liqueur. I placed some of the toasted almond slices on top before baking. Couldn't be happier with the results!

Super easy to make and very delicious! My only qualm with this recipe is that it says "yields 4 dozen" - it does not. It does not even come close. I get about 30 cookies from this batch and I use a measured teaspoon scooper for each cookie. I also have to admit, I never tried the original recipe, just automatically made the adjustment that many have already made in their reviews - that is - 1 cup crushed almonds, and 1 cup flour. (The second batch I made I used a little less than 1 cup of flour with the 1 cup of almonds, and I think those were even better.) Also, I baked at 375 for about 11 mins. I'd definitely suggest waiting til you see color towards the bottom of the cookie, otherwise it will taste very doughy. Still pretty  good, but not as perfect as when the bottom is a bit toasted. Basically - you will love these, and if you manage to make them and mess it up - I'd be impressed.

If you are having a case of "i need a sweet treat" these cookies ARE NOT for you. I liked how these cookies weren't very sweet, but you are obviously wanting a sweet treat if you are baking cookies. You could try adding more sugar to the recipe if you'd like.I made these cookies with my sister. We baked the first half of the dough and the cookies came out raw in the center after 8 minutes of baking in a preheated  400 degree oven just like the recipe says. The dough was extremely sticky so we ended up having to add more flour to the second half of the dough before we baked it. We switched the amaretto liqueur for pure almond extract which gives a better flavor. My suggestion would be to just add 1 teaspoon of almond extract if you want to use it instead of the amaretto.After we tried baking the second half of the dough although the the cookies were throughly baked they were too chewy in the center. CAUTION: the cookies stay in the same form you put them on the baking sheet. The first time around i just dabbed them on the cookie sheet and they stayed in the same shape after they were ready. The second time around i had to flour my hands and form the dough into balls then i gently flattened them out with the backside of a spoon.Overall they were decent but i would not make them again.

These were a bit bland, but looked a lot like Russian tea cakes when coated with powdered sugar.  It is a good filler cookie and somewhat expected as an assortment on a holiday cookie plate.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. It was dry and didn't have much almond flavor. I dipped one half in chocolate and brushed them with amaretto liquer to doctor them up. I will not make them again.

Nice little cookie! I also made some adjustments - 
Gluten free version: 
1 cup almond meal
1/2 cup almond flour
3/4 cup gluten free flour King Arthur
I substituted the butter for 1/2 of ghee which made these puppies a little more oily than planned but now I know! 
I substituted the amaretto for hazelnut liquor instead and poured a whole tablespoon! 
1.5 teaspoon of almond extract 
Kept everything else the same but baked at 13-15 mins at 350. Delicious cookie with tons of flavor! 

I could see experimenting with other goodies like the comments. Easy cookie and hard to mess up.

These were great! We subbed almond extract for amaretto (direct substitution, 2 tsp), used almond flour in place of ground almonds and made them bite sized so a single whole almond fit perfectly on each one. Will make again!

I made these for my guest one night and they were devoured fast. Simple to make and not overly sweet. I didn't have amoretto so I subbed with almond extract. Perfect end to an Asian meal.

Accidentally doubled the sugar (had already doubled the recipe, so it was twice what that should have been). Needed to bake much longer -around 14 minutes - but they were still excellent! Might add a glaze to make them pretty but taste is excellent.

Almond cookies just sing Christmas carols to me.  Three sliced almonds on top make it complete.  Love this recipe.  Again, I use a tiny cookie scoop to measure the dough balls.

Very Scrumcious!! They are worth the time!! For mine, I made more than 24!! I got up to like 30!! But I really recommend these cookies. You don't have to roll the dough out you put it straight onto the cookie sheet spoon by spoon. They are easy to make and they taste even better if you toast the almonds. I pre-heated my oven to 375 F because 400 is too hot. Other than that they are great hope you enjoy eating and making them as much as I do.

Nice cookies!  I had about a tablespoon extra of the ground almonds so I added it in and used pure almond extract as I didn't have Amaretto on hand.  These are the most delicious cookies!  I used my small cookie scoop which is a wee bit larger than a teaspoon and used a fork with icing sugar on it to slightly flatten the cookies.  I baked them at 350F instead of 400F which seemed awfully hot and baked them on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet for 14 minutes.  They came out light golden on the bottom and very slightly golden on top.  They are tender and delicious!  The almonds I used are roasted, non-salted and have a lovely flavor.  I notice the recipe doesn't mention "roasted".

I substituted the almonds and flour for an equal amount of almond flour. The flavor still didn't come out as strongly as I'd like, so I'd recommend doubling the amaretto. Also sometime through the baking I patted down the tops of the cookies wth a fork so that the middle was fully cooked without burning the bottom.

Loved this recipe! I omitted the crushed almonds and added another 1/2 tsp of the amaretto. I then formed small ball cookies and pressed glassed cherries in the centres. Those candied ones for baking that come out every Christmas in red and green.  It was amazing!

This recipe is very good. I followed the suggestion of baking at 350F, add extra almonds (about 1/4 cup) toasted in the oven, and decorate with a slivered one on top. My personal choice was adding amaretto until I could taste the flavor (at about 4tsp). With the latter said, you would think this recipe would be too strong. Well, after baking the taste is so delicate and downright delicious. I tested my recipe cutting back on the flour and they started spreading a bit, so I used the amount the recipe calls for and they came out great. Will make it again.

Just made these- very good cookies! Not overly sweet but good & light. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is recipe makes just about 2 dozen cookies- not many so I just turned around & made another batch! I will double recipe next time. They do not spread out much when baking. I sprinkled some leftover ground almonds on top before baking.

Recipe made about 30 cookies.  Some of the cookies I left as drop cookies and the last batch I flattened a little, they were crunchier.  Either way, these are delicious cookies.  Will make again often.

This is a good treat if you like cookies that are a little less sweet. I took some advice of the others who made this so I toasted my almonds first, used just a little over 1 cup of flour, added a little more sugar and amaretto, and baked it for 8-9 minutes on 375. Very tasty.

I made some modifications because I like more almond flavor and less fat. I reversed the portions of flour and almond flour (added 1 1/4 cups of almond flour and 1/4-1/2 cups of flour). I halved the butter to 1/4 and added 1/4 vegetable oil. The rest I kept the same. Every oven is different so keep an eye on the cookies to make sure you turn off when they turn slightly golden brown. I started at 400 for 10 minutes then 350 for 20 minutes. NOTE: these don't spread so shape them right, toast the almonds before putting them on the cookies to bake, and these will turn out gorgeous and delicious!

Variations for flavours - I was out of Amaretto but I used creme de cacao instead for a hint of chocolate - wonderful. As the others all said - toasting the almonds first is a must. Thanks for a great one for amaretto lovers!

I toasted the 1/2 cup of almonds .  Also added 2 teaspoons of almond extract plus I probably used 1 Tablespoon of amaretto.   I did place an almond slice on each cookie before baking.  Very tasty and cute little cookies!   

They were the perfect  accompaniment to homemade peach ice cream!

This recipe is fantastic. I have made it several times and I have done many variations. The cookies come out delicious each time. I have substitute the all purpose flour for all purpose gluten free flavor. I have added cocoa sometimes with pistachios, I have added pecans, walnuts, almond pieces and even substitute once mapple syrup instead amaretto with pecans. I have followed the recipe and they're delicious too. I have added more almond flour as someone suggested and they worked too. Definely a keeper. My only comment is that you may have to bake them at 350 F for 15 minutes more or less 400 F is too much.

Pretty tasty. After reading reviews, I used 1 cup of ground toasted almonds (used VitaMix dry blade), 1/2 cup bread flour, 1/2 cup all purpose flour, a 2 tablespoons of Amaretto (that's about what we had) , a splash of almond extract, a large pinch of cardamom, and a pinch of salt. I kept butter and sugar at 1/2 cup each. Oh, and I used a stainless steel scoop to scoop them onto a baking stone, pressing blanched almonds onto the top in various configurations. Baked them at 365 degrees for about  12 minutes - just until golden. Not too sweet, just right.

So easy and delicious. If you don't have amaretto on hand you can substitute almond extract.  I've made them both ways and they're equally yummy

Love this recipe! We modify it just a bit because we eat very little sugar. We use 1/2 cup of almond meal/flour, 1/3 cup of honey and almond extract instead of amaretto. Amazing!

Very simple cookie recipe! I substituted liquor for almond extract and they tasted pretty good. I like this recipe because it was very easy and quick.

This is the first time I am making cookies and I am new to baking. My cookies tasted great. I used 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup xylitol because my son is on a sugar restricted diet. Even then it was a bit too sweet for me. But my son liked it!

I love almonds, so this was perfect for me.  When they first came out of the oven, I was a bit disappointed because I thought they were too bland.  After they cooled for a while, though, the flavor really came out.  I brought these to a potluck, and everyone seemed to love them!

I made this recipe to the note but added a teaspoon of almond extract. The cookies were good, but very light in flavor. For the second batch, I added more almond extract, more amaretto, and more nuts. Instead of grinding the second batch of nuts, I just threw in some almond slivers to give the cookie some crunch. Even with the additions, the second batch was still pretty bland. It's a nice tea cookie with a lovely texture, I just wish it had more almond flavor.

These were bland and virtually flavorless. My family's are so much better. It is really sad that some people just don't know that there are wonderful traditional cookies unlike the ones that everyone eats now. People just don't know that there is better stuff out there. My almond cookie recipe has been in my family for 210 years this year, and it is very traditional and flavorful. Next time you are looking for a good cookie recipe, look it up under a specified search and bring up 'traditional'. Cookie recipes that have been around for a very long time are so much better and lots more flavorful. Old recipes are the best kind! Don't recommend this recipe, sorry!

YUM! These are delish! I did not have Amaretto, so I used almond extract (in equal measurements to the amaretto). I've made these twice, the first time I accidentally doubled the amount of amaretto (plus I added a tsp of vanilla cause I thought I did not have enough almond extract for the recipe!! (bad math)), so they came out VERY almond-y, I LOVED THEM. I just made them tonight using the proper measurements, and I think I prefer a little more almond. It was a happy mistake for an almond lover.

WOW!  These cookies lasted 30 minutes in my house.  They are delicious!  I had to use hazelnut liquer (didn't have amaretto) and I also put a couple sliced almonds on top of the cookies before they baked.  Great, EASY recipe!  Thank you!!

Awesome cookie! I made them into little thumbprints and added peach preserves to the tops after they were cool. Yummy!

The reviews about doubling the almonds were right on.  I also substituted toasted hazlenuts in one batch (still used the amaretto, but did not use the almond flavoring).  I've also made them with a bit of orange glaze on top - very tasty.

Simple look, simple ingredients, good taste. Mine looked a bit rough on top, so I put chocolate glaze (bit of butter and semi-sweet chocolate), and it complements almond taste nicely. Will definitelly bake again.
