This Pie is really good. I added my twist. I chose the recipe to bake because it sounded simple and I could dress it upfor company. I love the combination of caramel, chocolate and pecans! I used semi sweet chocolate chips in place of the milk chocolate to cut the sweetness. I used a homemade pie crust with 1/4 cup Carmel spread over a baked crust and 1/4 cup chopped pecans. I than put in the filling. I frosted with whip topping and drizzled another 1/4 cup caramel sauce and sprinkled 1/4 cup chopped pecans. A small serving brings a satisfied smile!

This was just pretty good.  It was pretty rich - and normally, I like rich.  Even though it was extremely easy, I would not make it again.  NOTE:  The instructions said "cool for 30 minutes."  I let it sit out on the counter - that was not enough.  I guess I should have put it in the refrigerator.  Definitely do not add the cool whip until the chocolate mixture is at least cool.

I added whipped cream to the top and sprinkled shredded chocolate on top of that.
It was simple to make and even easier to eat.

This was a really quick and easy pie.  I skipped the marshmallows and used 2 (6oz) Hershey bars with almonds.  I melted my chocolate in the microwave rather than the stovetop.  My husband, who's not a sweet eater even enjoyed this one.  Thanks Jason.

I got asked for the recipe by one of my dinner guests after I served this pie, so that earns it top ratings! I did use a cup of heavy cream whipped to a stiff consistency rather than whipped topping because I didn't want to use prepared ingredients. I also used a homemade chocolate crumb crust. The filling is rich yet not heavy, making it an ideal dessert for a big meal. I used Hershey bars for the chocolate, but in future I think I'll try a different brand, there is somethng about Hershey's milk chocolate that has an almost sour-milk flavor when melted that I don't taste with Lindt or Ghirardelli.

I made this like the directions stated except I melted the chocolate and marshmallows in the microwave instead. It was so much easier and faster too! I then cooled the mixture in the refrigerator which also saved time since cooling it on the counter would have taken hours in June. Super fluffy and delicious!!

Made this for Thanksgiving! It was just ok. I think I was expecting a more chocolate taste. Probably won't make again!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving. Everyone who tried it loved it.  My sis in law declared it her new favorite pie.  I made it pretty much according to the directions.  Delicious and deceptively simple.  I will make it again, because I am sure it will be demanded!
