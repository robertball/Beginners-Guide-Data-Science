Fabulous recipe! In place of the vegan mayo I added a pureed avocado and a large spoonful of plain greek yogurt and extra water to thin. It was fabulous, low cal for a dressing and super healthy. Thanks!

Was sooo excited to find a recipe for this!! I tweaked the recipe for what I had at home. 1/2 mayo and 1/2 plain greek yogurt instead of vegan yogurt, honey instead of agave nectar, regular white vinegar, lemon juice (though I'm sure lime would be a little better), and I know it's weird, but I used the vinegar water from banana peppers instead of water to thin. I also added about a teaspoon and a half or so of sriracha! It tastes great and I'm sure after sitting over night it will taste even better tomorrow :) Thanks for sharing.

My family loved this!  We are not vegan so we used regular mayo, and put it on a chicken salad.  We liked it so well that we did another salad with steak.  A yummy dressing for any summer salad.

Amazing. My boyfriend is in LOVE with it and can't stop raving. Made me look like a champ. I served it with organic brown rice and a southwest salad... We are vegan and it is a new staple! The sauce really makes it!

YUM! I made this with vegan low fat mayo and it was amazing!  Put it on a salad of romain, corn (fresh or even frozen), black beans (canned) and top with a few tortilla chips.  Amazing and guilt free!  Thank you for the great recipe!

Excellent! Jamie Lang, I thank you for working on getting this "right."  I used regular mayo since that's all we had and honey since I couldn't find agave at the store. Otherwise, everything else exactly the same. SO happy to find this recipe and it will become a regular staple.

This dressing is absolutely delicious! I used it on a gluten free pasta salad. I want to put it on everything! Weâ€™re not vegan, so I used regular mayo.

Very Good -  I mixed this dressing into a Southwest type salad adding crushed tortilla chips just before serving. I topped salad with grilled Fajita Chicken. It was delicious!

I really like this.  I pretty much double the spices then adjust the mayo and water to taste.  I substitute sour cream for part of the mayo, again to taste.  I use sugar instead of agave nectar as I always have it on hand.  I tried it with a tablespoon of sugar but will cut that in half next time.  Although I made changes to suit my taste, this recipe provided the basics of what is now a favorite.

Yum! I made a south western salad and everyone really liked it.  My hubby had two bowls!   Incentive to eat more veggies is always a win! Thanks for submitting!

I did add extra water because it was a little too thick for me but it was amazing! I was a little worried with the large amounts of seasoning it called for but it turned out to be PERFECT!

This was very good.  I did have to use reg mayo and subbed honey cuz no agave nectar.  Made half the recipe.  Used to top a bed of spinach topped with black bean and roasted sweet potato cakes on top with tomatoes and Cheddar Jack cheese! yum!

Very good. I did not have the agave so I added an additional tsp of lime juice and apple cider vinegar.  I also added 1 tbsp of minced garlic because we LOVE garlic :)

This was great!  I didn't have white apple cider vinegar, so I just used regular.  Makes a really zippy, thick dressing.  I put it over a salad with greens, black beans, avocado, and crushed tortilla chips and it was the perfect dressing.
