I took this dessert to my sister-in-laws house on Father's Day. It was a great hit and I 
plan to take it to my daughter's 4th of July party.

This is a very tasty trifle! I used white cake mix instead of pound cake and orange juice instead of rum. The flavor combination was a winner!

What a wonderfully easy and tasty trifle.  Perfect for Christmas season, the bowl was empty in no time.  I will definitely make it many more times.

This trifle got rave reviews at a family gathering - all ages loved it.  I will add a tiny bit more milk next time.
