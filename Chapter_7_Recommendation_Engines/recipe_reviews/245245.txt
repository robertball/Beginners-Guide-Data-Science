Instead of following the directions for the sauce, I just made a basic white sauce and added cheese (brown 2 T butter with 2 T flour and whisk in 2 cups milk, when thickened I added extra sharp cheddar and parmesan).  I poured the sauce over the kale, sausage, and sweet potatoes and baked uncovered for 30 minutes.  It came out bubbly, cheesy, and absolutely delicious.

I added onion and used ground italian sausage instead of links.  I also sprinkled some garlic powder over the mixture before pouring in the cheese sauce.

It was okay but needs more flavor...maybe oregano and/or garlic.

The whole family loved this!   I did double the Kale and added an extra sweet potato.  Next time I'll add even more Kale.  Make sure you use heavy duty foil.

I noticed recipe didn't mention any seasonings , so I tossed 1/4 of a red onion in while the sweet potatoes and sausage was browning  along with sea salt.  Then chopped 2 cloves of garlic and tossed the kale,  cooked sweet potatoes, and cook sausage together before adding it to the pan.  Substituted Progresso Tuscany chicken broth for more flavor.  My 9 year old vowed not to ear it until she tasted it. This was a big win!

Not having the exact ingredients I improvised. Johnsonville Italian Brats, yellow gold potatoes, mozzarella & cheddar. My kids devoured it! Even my picky 7 year old. I sliced and fried the sausage, sliced and baked the potatoes, combined potatoes, sausage and kale. Made a white sauce with mozzarella, poured it over the top and sprinkled with a bit of cheddar. My family of 6 + an 11x15 casserole = a great dinner!

I'm one of those that never follows a recipe exactly.  So, I used yellow potatoes, added some cauliflower, used cheddar and parm instead of gruyere. I also added a little tomato paste to the sauce because there was an open can in the frig!  I used what I had on hand.  I put it all in a greased 9 x 9 baking pan without the foil.  It was delicious and hearty.  A very flexible recipe that I will definitely make again.  Bon appetite!

I used ingredients I had on hand, which included ground sweet Italian turkey sausage, sharp Cheddar, and Parmesan. Since some reviewers stated it needed seasoning,  I added chopped onion, salt, black pepper and garlic powder. I made the same cheese sauce as gthang, using 1 cup sharp Cheddar and 1/4 cup of Parmesan. I cooked the sweet potatoes, onion and sausage on the stove just until the sausage was no longer pink. Therefore, I baked it for 30 minutes. I will make it again. However, next time, I think I'll add an additional seasoning (like Basil or Rosemary)?

Wondra  flour would help make sauce prep easier ( no lumps) 
I took easy clean up route of cooking in foil pan.
