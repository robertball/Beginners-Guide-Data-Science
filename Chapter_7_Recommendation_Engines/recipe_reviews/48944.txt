For a real Long Island like at the bar, reduce amounts to 1oz. And increase Tequilla to 1oz.  Mix with 5oz of sweet and sour mix and shake well. NEVER,NEVER shake carbonated ingredients.  Strain into tall glass and top with cola.  My neighbors love it when I make these.

I was a bartender for many years, and the review "Chef daddy of 4" added is the only way I have ever made them.

CD 4 has the right idea - I've tended for 7yrs now and the perfect way to do it (IMHO) is equal pts vodka, rum, tequila, gin (1z per) 1.5z triple sec, 3.5z sour, splash of cola, transfer from pint to tumbler back to pint.  garnish with a lemon.  The cola/sour ratio is key in this drink.

These were grrrrrrrr8. I did mix equal parts of all four liquors, to make it easier to make a big batch.  I also added a splash of sour mix in too for more froth when  shaking.  
I multipled the whole recipe by 4 and made a pitcher, leaving the cola out. Then as my guests needed on, I used a cocktail shaker and shook the 6 ounces of "tea" mix to 2 ounces of cola with crushed ice, shook and served.  I do have a touch of a hangover today :-)

This is a very good drink, although I prefer not to use tequilla and instead of orange juice I use a homemade sweet and sour which is half simple syrup and half fresh squeezed lemons.

The real way to make one is equal parts of all the liquors, most times it's 1/2 oz. I say most times because if you are mixing them in big mason jars then you would use more! NEVER use orange juice or sweet and sour. Just make fresh sweet and sour with lemon juice and simple syrup. I will echo other reviews and say that you should never shake anything carbonated. This is how I make mine behind the bar.

1/2 oz Vodka
1/2 oz Tequila
1/2 oz Triple Sec or cointreau or similar
1/2 oz light rum
1/2 oz Gin
1 oz Lemon Juice (Fresh)
1/2 oz Simple Syrup (1:1 sugar and water)
Splash Coke

Add all liquors, lemon juice, and syrup into a cocktail tin. Fill a collins glass with ice then your shaker with ice. Shake ingredients for about 10 seconds and strain into the collins glass with ice. Top with coke. Garnish with a lemon and cherry.

WOWWW! This tastes exactly like what I used to get in college! Make sure you use a tall glass for this one! A very potent mixer! I used 1 (1.5 fluid ounce) of tequila to match the other liquors. This is such fun - one serving can cover two people nicely! Thanks for the post! We enjoyed this for a change!

I tried it as listed, but it came out too strong but tasteless.  What I did was add lime juice and it was a success.

I used 1 oz amounts of all liquor (as 'Chef Daddy of 4' recommended) and more cola to suit my tastes. Excellent.

I too was a bartender, and I have to agree with chef Daddy of 4, this is how we made them at the restaurant/bar I worked at.If you make them heavier, they loose the "Iced Tea" taste.

This was nice to try, but a little strong and not as smooth as others I have tried.  I guess I prefer long island iced tea made with sweet and sour instead of oj.

I LOVE Long Island iced teas. Mostly because I can order 1 and be done, okay maybe 2. I have never made one because of all the alcohol I would have to buy but for a weekend getaway with my hubby we decided it would be cheaper to make them than to sit and order $15 ones by the pool. Also, we live in utah so it's impossible to get a real LIIT. 
Made it. Followed the directions to a T and WOW. it tasted more like a shot or 3 than a LIIT. I added triple the Diet Coke and triple the OJ. It was perfect. 
Thanks for a goodie and thanks for adding to our kid less  weekend

Taste mostly like a citrus drink but very good with the sweet & sour change.
