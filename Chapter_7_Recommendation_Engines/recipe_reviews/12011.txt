Very good. Indeed, the amount of cheese mixture is WAY too much for this recipe. I used 1 15-oz. containter of ricotta with same amount of eggs, mozzarella, parm, and replacing dried parsley with about 4 tbs fresh, and I replaced the 1/2 c. water with 1/4 c. water and 1/4 c. red wine. Very rich and tasty. However, a word to the wise: I unwisely chose to use 1/2 lb. lean ground beef with 1/2 lb. sausage. I think this would be a good decision if.. and I do mean ONLY IF... you have access to good spicy Italian-style sausage. Do not use "country" sausage or any sausage with a sweet base. Our local store had sausage, but it's flavored with sage and maple. Good with eggs. Bad with lasagne. Other than that, very simple, comparatively quick, little mess and rather tasty. I would, in the future, try it with a little garlic, some fresh basil, a dash of oregano, and maybe some cooked shrooms added in. I wouldn't use fresh shrooms, as it may make the dish too squishy and cause it to not "stand up" as a lasagne should. Definitnely worth a try with some tweaking.

My husbands absolute favorite thing to eat is lasagna and I've been looking for an easy to make lasagna recipe- paticularly one where I didn't have to boil the noodles and one I could use store bought sauce. He's a pretty tough lasagna critic and he liked it alot. This was so easy to make and I'm glad I finally found an easy recipe to satisfy my husband's lasagna needs. The only change I made to the recipe was using ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese- it turned out great!

This recipe saved the day when I had 5 college kids drop by for dinner unexpectedly.  I used the "no-boil" lasagna noodles, mild Italian sausage instead of hamburg, and 60 ounces of spaghetti sauce, leaving out the water.  I also layered in some fresh baby spinach leaves.  It was a big hit!!  Thanks!!

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe, but I recommend adding about 50% more spaghetti sauce, because otherwise, it's a little dry.  With that suggestion, it is the perfect lasagna!

This recipe was a fantastic starting point!  My husband as of late has been a very picky eater had two servings!!!  When browning the ground beef I added some lawrys seasoning salt, freash onion, 2 freash chopped cloves of garlic, some parsley, oregano, garlic powder, and some italian seasonsing, then with making the sauce, I added minced seasoned tomatoes, seasoned with garlic and oregano.  I drained most of the juices from it, not all, I added the sauce, and added about a quarter cup of water to it.  Then for the cheese mixture I changed out the cottage cheese for riccotta cheese, and since I am a cheese freak I added a bit extra for good measure. It turned out fabulous!  I didn't know that you didnt have to cook the noodles, and I was a bit skeptic, but Thank you so much for showing me the way it should be done.  Oh and with other comments to it being soupy, i still added a bout a quarter of a cup of water to the edges of it, but for the last 10 minutes while it was covered i turned the heat up to 400 degrees, and then when i took the foil off, i only put it in for ten minutes at 375, just to be safe.  I served immediately and it was great.  I  am so thankful for this recipe, it was a wonderful romantic dinner!!!!Thanks!

The easiest and best tasting lasagna I've made, including authentic Italian recipes that take twice as long.  This takes 30 minutes to prepare, only because I add mushrooms and onions to the meat.  I scale it down for a 9X9 pan.  The amount of cottage cheese is too much - I used 12 oz. for a 9X9.  I still used 2 eggs, 8 oz (2 cups) of mozzarella and used lasagna sheets.  The sheets are slightly thinner than regular lasagna noodles and fit perfectly in a 9X9.  
Allow a full hour for baking.  Although it looked soupy when I took it out of the oven, after 10 minutes it was fine.  I used regular (not no bake)lasagna noodles and Ragu.

I am a novice cook and I have always wanted to make lasagna.  This recipe was perfect, it was so easy and it was delicious! It made me look like an expert, thank you! I substituted some of the mozzarella with cheddar, it was so cheesy! And I was so impressed with the way the noodles came out even after not being cooked first, excellent recipe!

This is the tastiest "Fast" recipe for lasagna I have found.  My family loves it, and since my husband is a garlic fanatic, I mince two cloves of garlic into the hamburger when it fries.  Its an easy way to enhance the flavor.

This lasagna was great!  I was looking for an easy lasagna recipe and I've found it.  I did use more spaghetti sauce than the recipe called for.

This is a good, quick lasagna.  Not the best lasagna I've ever had, but good for a busy weeknight.  Not having to precook the noodles is a great time-saver.  They come out good in the end-- not too mushy, not too hard.  I use ricotta cheese instead of cottage.  Better the next day when it dries out slightly.

For those of you who have never made Lasagna...read this.  My Wife and Mother-in Law are both Italian.  Annually, my Mother-in-Law makes Lasagna from scratch...noodles, sauce from tomatoes, grates her own cheese...you get the idea typically spending hours the day before Christmas Eve.  This year, my wife and her mom had a disagreement and it looked like we were not going to have Lasagna.  (My three boys look forward to Lasagna on Christmas Eve.)  Due to the confusion, and to make peace, I said, "fine...I'll make the Lasagna." to which my middle son said, "Dad, you burn water." and my "Mother-in-Law" laughed at me.  Determined, I looked for an easy recipe.  I tried this one!  It turned out GREAT! and I was complimented and told I would be expected to make it again.

I made the following changes:
1) Instead of Cottage Cheese, I used Ricotta.
2) I used 1/2 Pork and 1/2 Beef and seasoned.
3) I used homemade sauce...What can I say..I already said that my wife and mother in law are Italian.  There is always ususally some sauce around....(Relatively thick compared to store brands.)
4) I used no boil noodles...worked great.
5) We like a "Dry top"...therefore, I did not add as much water around the edges.

I cooked per the directions.  It was just about as good as my Mother-in - Laws in much less time.

Thank-you....

I thought this recipe tasted great and was easy.  One little note though...shouldn't the ingredients say 12 lasagna noodles??  You start with 3, repeat that process twice, and then put 3 on top...3+3+3+3=12.

I will never boil lasagne noodles again! I made this with a few changes and it turned out wonderful.  I used quite a bit more sauce, probably 58oz or so.  I like my lasagne saucy.  I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, and a little extra mozarella. About the liquid, it depends on the sauce you use. If it's  watery sauce like Ragu brand, you probably don't need extra water.  But if it's pretty thick like Prego, you should add some extra water. Thanks for the great recipe; it was wonderful!!

This was amazing! I never make lasagna because it's too much work but this was easy and so delicious!  After reading the reviews, I used Italian Sausage instead of the beef, 1 1/2 jars of sauce, 1 container of cottage cheese and the no bake noodles. I also used a 4 cheese Italian blend in place of the parm cheese.

This was a complete disaster for me.  Followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a soupy mess. 1 hour before serving dinner to 25 people I had to scramble to find something else to serve.

Best lasagna I've ever made! And easy, can't beat that. Even my food critic husband had nothing but good things to say! I added garlic powder to the meat, used less cottage cheese (3 cups instead of 4) and used two 24 oz jars of sauce. Also ended up with extra mix so I added one more layer. This one's a keeper for sure!

I give this recipe 4 stars because the quantities are off. I made this recipe once following it exactly and made adjustments the second time. If adjustments are made this is definitely a 5 star meal! The recipe makes waaay too much cheese mixture (and I like cheese). I substituted ricotta and used about 15 oz with all other ingredients in the cheese mixture at the same quantities. I only added about one cup at a time where the recipe says to layer 1&3/4 cup. I still had a little left over. The second time around, I had only good reviews from the judges! (aka kiddos) So get cooking, this is as easy as it gets for homemade lasagna!

Great recipe!  One thing to note--recipe calls for 32 oz spaghetti sauce and 32 oz of cottage cheese.  The standard sized containers of these products is not 32 oz so you need to be careful when shopping.  I used a jar and half of spaghetti sauce and it worked great.  I only used 24 oz cottage cheese because I did not catch the size of the container but it still turned out well.  I compensated with a little extra cheese.  ;)

Great lasagna.  I added 2 cloves of garlic & 1/2 onion when browning beef.  I also used about 40 oz of Classico tomato & basil sauce. Then added a can of 6 oz. tomato paste w/ italian herbs.  Oh yeah...and used 1/2 ricotta & 1/2 cottage cheese.  This was my 1st time making lasagna and it was a success.  My fiance says he's eating this all week. =)

I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious! I've been searching for an easy lasagna recipe for a while now. I've tried others but they didn't turn out as good. I halved the recipe (since there's only my hubby and me) and used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. It was so delicious I'm throwing out my other lasagna recipes and just keeping this one :). It was really easy to make too. Thank you so much! Hubby complimented it often and is even taking some for lunch! (Which is a big deal since he drives all day for work so he normally just has cold sandwiches but he wants to eat this lasagna cold!)

This was GREAT and so easy.  I substituted ground turkey breast, put in a little (just a little) bit more sauce, and added some of my own spices to the sauce.  Used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  It didn't taste like store bought sauce at all, once you doctor it up.  Thanks Joanie.  We all LOVED IT!

I cut down the cottage cheese by going 50/50 with ricotta. Runny, not enough noodles, too much cheese.

This is great recipe.  I was nervous that the noodles were not going to cook properly but they did.

As a first time lasagna maker, this was a perfect recipe.  After viewing other recipes, I altered it a bit.  First I doubled it, then added a couple teaspoons of oregeno to the cheese mixture and I also took four Johnsonville Sweet Ialian brats (less the casings), and fried in with the burger.  Delicious!  My family loved it!

This was a really simplified lasagna recipe that tasted great. The sauce and cheese mixture were simple and delicious, the using the water to cook the noodles is a great time saver. Everybody liked the flavor, and there are picky eaters here.

True to the name, this is very easy lasagna and it tastes pretty good too. I'm new to cooking and I've never made lasagna before, so this  was perfect for me. I seasoned the meat as well as the cheese mixture and it turned out great. Also, this is a lot of cheese; it might be too much for some. My only problem was that it turned out really watery for some reason. I'm positive it's due to the fact that I used a cheap, generic pasta sauce which probably just turned to soup in the oven. I'd recommend investing in good sauce, even if you're a poor college student like me.

This recipe is not only a home run, but a Grand Slam! After a long exhausting day, my daughter and I put our best efforts out there for a comforting dinner using this recipe and we were rewarded with this absolutely delicious "quick" lasagne. I used jarred sauce and uncooked noodles, which is the BEST PART!! I only had and used 24 oz of cottage cheese and only 2 cups mozzarella cheese and added all the rest of the ingredients, as indicated, and baked it. When it was ready, we eagerly settled in with our dinner and were delighted! My sweet husband went back for seconds! Great recipe! Thank you, Joanie!

This is delicious! Soo easy and quick. I actually made it the first time around using ricotta (it was cheaper) and It was good, but a LOT of cheese. I now use the cottage cheese and it's delish! I still cut it down by half, but left the same amount of the egg, mozzarella, seasoning. I also used a jar and a half I pasta sauce and no boil lasagna noodles. So simple and has become a staple in our house!

My husband is an executive chef and he went nuts over this dish.  It was my first time making lasagna and it was so easy!!  I added a little garlic powder and basil to the cheese mixture.  I will definitely be making this again!!

I rarely follow a recipe to the T but I did this time. It was sooo easy to make and the clean up was soooo easy. I'm huge on clean up because I hate it so much. I prepared this in probably 10-15 minutes. And last but not least the taste was really, really good. I was hesitant to use cottage but I had to use the ingredients on hand - it turned out awesome! And the pickiest eater EVER - my husband LOVE LOVE LOVED it. We were both really suprised at how much he liked it. I also even forgot to add onion and garlic and it turned out well. Oh yeah I also preboiled my noodles a little and still added water. I probably won't add the water next time.

I have very little experience at making Lasagna. My son wanted lasagna for his birthday dinner. I was looking for an easy alternative to Stauffer's frozen lasagna.  I found this recipe to be easy. We like cheese so we did not think it had too much cheese. I used 1 1/2 pounds of italian sausage in place of the ground beef, 1 pound of mozzarella (don't know if that's more, less, or = to 3 cups), ricotta cheese (in place of cottage cheese), and 11 "oven ready" lasagna noodles (because that's what was in my pantry) I broke the 2 extra noodles into pieces so that the noodles stretched end to end in the 13 x 9 pan. It turned out perfect! The edges were not over done and hard like we've had in the past. I will make this again. Homemade is SO much better than Stauffer's Lasagna!!!!!!  (and I used to like Stauffer's lasagna :p).

Easy, wonderful and I did alter it a bit.  I used Italian Sausage instead of beef because I had it and I poured white wine around the edges instead of water.  Good garlic bread and a toss salad and I had dinner for 8 on short notice.

My family loved this meal. I actually seasoned my ground beef with garlic powder and soul seasoning(seasoning salt). I also used parsley flakes-2tsp.  I did the 42oz ragu sauce with tomato/garlic/onion and the 32oz ricotta. Very good. Will fix again.

This is delicious.  I didn't think it'd be this good because it was so simple/easy to make.  This will now be my lasagna recipe!  I did substitute 15 oz. low fat ricotta for the cottage cheese.  I wouldn't mind trying it with cottage cheese sometime.

Awsome! Family loved it... I give it 5 stars because it is really good for how easy it is. I used Hunts garlic and herb sauce and dried italian seasoning in lieu of parsley. Also added additional layer and cooked for 1 hour total.

This was good for being so easy but seemed like it was lacking something.  I ended up using 12 lasagna noodles (enough to fit across the pan on each layer), a 32 oz container of low fat ricotta (my family doesn't like cottage cheese), two 24 oz jars of Newman's Own Sockaroni spaghetti sauce (just because 1.5 jars didn't seem like enough sauce) and 4 cups of mozzarella total.  I also diced and cooked one whole onion and some diced garlic with the meat as it just seemed like it would need more seasonings.  I soaked the noodles in warm water while I prepared the meat and cheese mixtures and they turned out soft enough after baking without needing to add any water to the pan.  Everyone enjoyed it and it was easy enough to make, just not the best tasting we've had.

This recipe proves the importance of reading other recipe reveiws before you decide to make something.  After reading them all, I decided to use ricotta instead of cottage cheese, not use as much of the total cheese mixture, and to use at least half as much sauce as it called for.  I think that if I had not taken these measures, that my lasagna would not have turned out as great as it did.  PERFECT!!!!!

The family loved it. I removed the parsley from the cheese mixture since my youngest son wouldn't eat it that way. I also made the following changes which added a punch of flavour. : 1) Removed the browned ground beef with a slotted spoon, leaving the leftover grease in the pan 2) In the leftover grease, sauteed 1/2 large onion until soft 3) Added 4 garlic cloves (chopped) and sauteed until soft 4) Added the browned ground beef back to the pan and combined well 5) Added one tablespoon of oregano, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper, combined well 6) Replaced the spaghetti sauce with   1 1/2 28oz cans crushed tomatoes and simmer for 10 minutes 7) Replaced the cottage cheese with ricotta 8) Held off adding the top layer of cheese until the cover is removed (once the 45 minutes of baking is complete) 8) After adding the top layer of cheese, baked for an additional 15 minutes 9) After removing from the oven, let stand for 15-20 minutes before cutting/serving.

This was my very first time making lasagna and it came out AMAZING. Made me look like a pro! Only thing I did different was I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese & used about 40oz of sauce.

I have never ever made lasagna before.  This was my first recipe and after dinner my mom told me that this lasagna was better than hers (and she is a pretty good cook!)!  I did like everyone advised and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese (500g more so by accident than desire to scale down the content).  I also used about 800g of pasta sauce but then got worried that it wont be enough so I added 400g of chopped tomatoes.  Of course garlic a-plenty in both the meat while it was frying and the pasta sauce while it was simmering.  I also added pre-cooked onions and mushrooms (as advised).  Completely improvised with dried basil and herbs de provance (the pasta sauce was not particularly tasty so I improved it).  TOTALLY making this one again!!  

PS: I compromised with water - recipe calls for 1/2 cup and everyone advised 1/4 so I went 1/3 instead and it was great not too runny and not dry, as Goldilocks would say - just right!  ;)

This was the easiest lasagna ever! I modified by only using 12 oz of cottage cheese, and I used 2 24 oz jars of sauce.  I also only used about 1/8 cup of water--just a little on the sides.  It was great!

This recipe only got the job done. I substituted the cottage with ricotta and I think it came out waaaay better. Also, instead of dried parsley I used fresh parsley. THERE IS WAY TOOO MUCH CHEESE IN THIS and definitely not enough sauce. If you want that amount of cheese, make double the amount of sauce. Also, add spices to the sauce; it makes it way better.

I love this recipe and so do my friends... they ask when I making it again.  I use ground turkey instead of beef and add onion and green pepper to the sauce.  I also like to add steamed spinach as a layer.

A great beginner recipe for lasagna.  Agree that it needs more sauce. Easy to double and triple and then I can freeze the extras. I have never boiled the noodles first and it always comes out great!

I make this for my husband all the time and he loves it! I made some changes to the recipe though. Instead of cottage cheese I used ricotta cheese and I didn't use 32 oz. probably only about 1/2 that amount. It comes out great every time!

This was EASILY the best tasting lasagna I've ever had. Not too many ingredients, and really easy to get set up. HOWEVER. If you're not using non boil noodles, you need to prep the lasagna (up to panning) the night before you intend to bake/serve. My noodles didn't cook down to an eating consistency until 2 hours after I intended to serve it. So either prepare ahead of time, or use non boil noodles!

My first time making Lasagna and I followed this recipe and it turned out great!
I did sub the beef with ground turkey (I don't eat beef) and sub the cottage cheese with ricotta cheese. 
Bit time consuming to prepare but rewards of all the yummyness is worth it !

This lasagna was so easy to make and was very good! I didn't mix the cheeses together though and I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. I added the parsley, salt and ground black pepper to the ricotta cheese and layered the cheeses separately.

As promised it was easy, and quite good on top of that.  I think the recipe could have been easier to understand in a couple places.  
I used wheat noodles instead of the classic white.  They came out good, but I think they were smaller than normal.  They didn't fill as much space in the pan as I expected, and it was a bit watery at the end.  I think next time I'll use 12 noodles instead of 9.

Made this for a birthday party for a big group and got RAVE reviews.  I did add 1/2 lb sausage and substituted ricotta for cottage cheese.  Also added extra cheese because you can never have too much cheese in my opinion.

I used 1 650 ml jar of spaghetti sauce and 1 400 ml can of tomato sauce. As well, I used turkey instead of ground beef. I used 1 percent cottage cheese which might have made it a bit too runny because of the water content. I also used a bit more parmesan to cover. I also added about a cup of chopped basil to the spaghetti sauce mixture after it had simmered down. I found it to be rather runny and would likely drain the cottage cheese a bit the next time. As well, I probably had 1 1/2 - 2 cups of the cheese mixture left over. I would not use as much cottage cheese next time as it seemed plenty cheesy enough without it.

Awesome recipe!  Only thing I changed was to add 1/4 cup, instead of 1/2 cup, of water around edges.  And I used oven ready noodles.  This is a keeper!

THIS WAS SO GOOD!!!!!  Not too time consuming as far as lasagna goes.  I did not use water.  It was moist enough without it.  I have made this twice so far.  And both times, it was eaten up very quickly.  Everyone loves it!

My boyfriend had a long day at work, so I thought I'd surprise him with a hearty meal. When I saw that the other lasagna recipes called for such extravagant ingredients, and required much more time to prepare than I really had to spare, I was bummed. However, this Easy Lasagna II came to my rescue!  Tastes just like the lasagna my mom spends hours preparing. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe--it's perfect, and my boyfriend raved about its awesomeness. Maybe that diamond ring will come sooner than I think, thanks to this recipe ;D

Great lasagna!  Made it for family that was coming in - mainly b/c I figured I could leave it cooking for a little longer if their flight was delayed. Turned out great!  One tip when making an Italian dish w/ store-bought sauce: Use a good sauce, not a cheap one.  The dish is only as good as the sauce you use.  I did add dried onions & garlic to the meat, increased the mozz to 4 cups total in the dish & 1 cup on top, and added dried parsley to the top (mainly for presentation.)  Also, used 2 jars of Newman's Own Sockarooni spag sauce (48 oz total.)

This recipe was so easy to make!  I have tried lasagna before and it never turned out, but one try with this recipe and it was fantastic!  I did add more water than it called for since the spaghetti sauce was very thick.

I found this to be a quick and easy Lasagna to make, and the flavor was excellent. On the downside it did not set up well and after 15-20 minutes to cool it was more like a thick stew in consistency than a lasagna.  That did not bother me, but my wife did not like it being runny.  I suspect the cottage cheese may have been guilty.

Great recipe! After reading other reviews I made a few changes. I added fresh pressed garlic and 1 tsp Italian seasoning to meat mixture, 1/2 cottage -
1/2 ricotta cheese - a little less water cooking covered for a hour and uncovered for 10-20 min. ***Love it***

I always use ricotta cheese instead and instead of 32 ounces, I use about 30.  I add italian seasoning instead of parsley, salt, and pepper.  It is always a big hit!

Found this recipe and used it for dinner tonight. Wonderful! Made some slight changes... used a combo of cottage and ricotta and added mushrooms & onions to the beef. So good! Kids are still eating. :)

This recipe is wonderful just the way it is, however, I am one of those people that has to constantly tweak, change, try or wonder "what if I..."  Well one day I added about 3 ounces of shaved pepperoni to the sauce.  Wonderful!  Just added a little more depth to the taste.  You can also grate or chip the pepperoni.  Also try adding about 1/2 tsp ceyenne pepper and a little cheddar cheese.  All of these just enhance an already wonderful recipe. (pssst  make more sauce than called for)

This was super easy! Make sure you have plenty of sauce on the noodles, otherwise they are bit tough. This will be my new recipe for lasagna.
Thanks for this recipe!

This recipe is super easy! Midweek I realized that I wanted to have something delicious, but I didn't have the full amount of ingredients on hand so I had to substitute. Even then my this recipe was delicious!! My husband had thirds and he's not a big eater! Here's my how my tweaking came out to a total of 287 calories per serving (12 total)
2 cups cottage cheese (4%)
11 oz of part skim mozzarella
1 egg
32 oz of barilla tomato sauce
.40 cup of parmesan
12 lasagna noodles
1 lb of eggplant instead of meat
1/4 c water
I followed the instructions on how to prepare. It was delicious! It was super cheesy and very flavorful! I will continue to make this lasagne my way because I'm trying to lose weight while being able to eat! Thank you!

It was very easy, but a little bland. For being my first time making lasagna, it was great. I will be making this lasagna again, but doctoring it a little. As a base lasagna recipe, I love it!

I modified this recipe to make it more flavorful.  Substituted a 24 oz. jar of Chunky Ragu Mushroom and Green Pepper.  Sauteed 1 small onion with ground beef.  Decreased the cottage cheese amount to 16oz. Substituted 2-8oz packages of Kraft Italian Five Cheese rather than using mozzarella and Parmesan.  Next time, I am going to add 1/2 lb. ground pork to the beef.  Served this with crescent rolls and stir-fried sugar snap pea vegetable combo.  Very easy and nutritious lunch or supper.

I haven't made lasagna in a while so I thought I try this one.  Prepared it ahead of time. Noodles got a little gummy.  But not horrible bad. Overall was delish!  My 17 yr old son ate 2 large helpings along with my hubby! I did use 2 jars of sauce, threw in some pepperoni for a spicy bite! This is a keeper.

The taste was pretty good (added Italian seasoning, garlic, and onion to the sauce as others had recommended), but unfortunately everyone at the table agreed that it was way too cheesy. It was barely saucy because the cheese absorbed most of it! I think 16 oz of cheese instead of 32 oz would probably be sufficient. 

Also, I used regular lasagna noodles and had to bake an additional 15 minutes with foil on for the noodles to be soft enough. Probably won't use this recipe again, but thanks for sharing anyway.

So delicious! I'm a broke college student and made this for under $10! Substituted the cottage cheese for ricotta for personal preference. Can't wait to make it again! Thanks a bunch!

Love this recipe!  Quicker, easier, fewer dishes with not having to boil the pasta first.  I made a few modifications, from some suggestions of others.  Used half ground beef and half Italian sausage and added a chopped white onion.  Used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  Added basil, garlic and oregano.  Used 1/4 cup red wine and 1/4 cup water instead of 1/2 cup water.  Also I made extra sauce to have on the side and to put on leftovers, which get dried out.  Yum!

I only have this recipe 4 stars because I had to cook it an extra half-hour to get the noodles to cook and when it finally cooked it didn't hold it's form like a regular lasagna probably because it was VERY watery. So the second time I boiled the lasagna noodles for a few minutes just to soften them and I didn't put the water in at the end. Even though I used a smaller jar of sauce te lasagna came out PERFECT. Delicious! This will be a regular in our home!

I have tried many recipes for lasagna. They can be time consuming and often disappointing results. This recipe was fast, easy, economical and although I was sceptical about the uncooked noodles....it was fabulous! No burnt edges, no crusty top, nothing sticking to the bottom....wow, loved this recipe. It will be the one I go to first for lasagna to take to family gatherings. Everyone raved about how tasty it was and it cut like a dream....only thing different I did was to add a bit of spice to the sauce as we love our spice! Otherwise, don't change a thing. Thanks so much for this winner!

My family loved this.  I added some italian seasoning to the sauce to give it a little extra flavor.  I liked the use of cottage cheese instead of ricotta like most recipes because it kept it really moist.  Will make again and again!!!

This dish came out delicious!  I pretty much followed the directions, but I seasoned the meat with seasoning salt, onion powder, garlic, and pepper, and used prego traditional sauce.  I also added a dash of sugar because I like a sweet salty combo. I then combined the cheeses and replaced ricotta with cottage and used shaved parm. This recipe does call for extra sauce and I used 1 and 1/2 jars which allowed me to do four layers. My boyfriend loved it and it's really simple!  DELICIOUS!

Great easy lasagna!  I tweaked it a bit by adding fresh sauteed mushrooms and oregano to the meat before adding the sauce.  The lasagna tasted great but I made the mistake of boiling the noodles before baking in the oven which gave it a more mushy texture than what I like.  I do wish it had a little more kick.  I will make it again adding green peppers and garlic.

This was a big hit with my family. Leftovers went to the office and got wonderful compliments. I sauted onion, green and red peppers in a bit of minced garlic and browned meat in to the mixture for added flavors. Will make this again!!!!

Easy and good lasagna...I used mild Italian sausage instead of hamburger, ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese and some extra sauce.  I'll probably try a different easy lasagna recipe next time though.

Great recipe and very easy! This will definitely be my go to recipe for lasagna! Only made a few minor adjustments: used ground turkey instead of ground beef, used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and added frozen chopped spinch (added this to the cheese mixture for layering).

I'm not really sure what I did wrong with this recipe but I was somewhat disappointed with the end result. I followed it exactly and probably added a little bit more sauce than called for, and half the noodles were way too hard- definitely not al dente. I assembled the layers evenly and even added the 1/2 cup water to the edges before putting it in the oven, a decision I thought I'd regret thinking it would come out too soggy and mushy. I will definitely use a recipe that calls for precooked noodles in the future. The flavor was good but chewy noodles ruined the whole meal. I've never had a problem cooking noodles thoroughly before LOL. I'm hoping the leftovers will be better reheated :(

I forgot to add the water (although I did soak the noodles first) and it was still delicious! Thank you!

This recipe was excellent!  This was my first time making lasagna, so I really appreciated that I didn't have to boil the noodles seperately. I would suggest using a little less water than the recipe calls for.  I also used ground turkey and whole wheat noodles to make it a little healthier.

Very good, and easy if not a little time-consuming. The other reviews said to half the cottage cheese, which I did, and it turned out to be too little; stick with the recipe as-written for best results. Also, make sure ALL parts of the noodle are covered in sauce and/or cheese, otherwise that area will be crispy instead of tender. All in all, I'd make this again if I had a need for lasagna and was lacking a frozen Stouffer's version.

I was so pleased with this recipe! I added more seasonings to our liking..red pepper flakes, oregano, garlic, dried basil. I was able to freeze half of this into a smaller casserole pan.

I made this for a birthday dinner last weekend.  I was able to put it together the night before & bake it the next night.  My pan is a little larger so I used 2 lbs. of ground beef and added Italian seasoning to the beef.  I also added fresh sliced mushrooms while the sauce was simmering.  It was delicious!

love this recipe, it's become a staple in our home. Usually just do canned/jarred spaghetti sauce and if I don't feel like browning meat I just throw in some cut up spinach and make it veggie lasagna - I prefer rocatta cheese, as well, not a big fan of cottage cheese :) Deelish and VERY easy to make.

My husband loved this recipe, as did my picky 3-year old!  Older kids are cheese-lovers, so the amount of cheese mixture was perfect for us.  I used a jar and a half of spaghetti sauce and next time will use the full 2 jars. Not enough sauce.   I also used minced garlic and chopped onion while browning the beef, and sprinkled garlic powder in the sauce. I think next time, I'll use red pepper flakes.

Great dish for my maiden voyage in the lasagna world! The picky boyfriend approved! After reading reviews, I made a few key changes to add flavor and cut *some* fat. Also, the directions for layering made it confusing with the "repeat layers twice". I used a total of 9 noodles.  I minced about 1/2 a head of garlic, a few shakes of dry crushed red hot peppers, and one small onion into my beef as it was browning.  Instead of 32oz cottage cheese, I used 16oz (1% fat), and 16oz ricotta (lite). I also used 2% fat shredded mozz cheese that comes in 1.75 cup bags. One was mixed into the cheese mix, and one was sprinkled on top.  I did not add any water, but used 40oz spag sauce (2 24oz jars, but not all of the 2nd one). I splashed a little white zinfindel in order to clean out the first jar--for a little sweetness.   I also upped the temp to 400 degrees for the last 15 minutes of baking (5 covered, and the 10 uncovered).  This was great and worth the slopped up oven I have! :)

My husband loves lasagna so I have been searching for a good recipe so I could make it for him. Since finding this recipe a few months ago I have made it 4 times. My husband loves it!!! The only changes I made was adding chopped onions and minced garlic to the meat while I browned it. This is so yummy and worth trying!!!!

Good and easy recipe for lasagna.  I used a 24 oz. container of cottage cheese and cut back on the mozzarella.  On the advice of another reviewer I just used regular lasagna noodles but they came out chewy.  Next time, I'll use the no boil-not the fault of the recipe.

I was looking for an easier way to make lasagna and came upon this recipe...it turned out GREAT with a couple changes.  I used 48 oz of sauce (mixed traditional with sauteed garlic and onion)  I also sauteed onions with the ground beef and added some garlic salt.  Other than that I kept everything the same.  I only used a little bit of the water suggested after reading previous reviews of the lasagna being soupy.  Also, I made this a little bit ahead of time so it sat in the fridge for about 3 hours before baking...not sure if this helped it to "set up"? After baking it as suggested, I let it sit for about 30 minutes and it cut and served PERFECTLY.  Very proud of myself!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a basic recipe for lasagna.  I followed the recipe but used both ricotta and cottage cheese, using one jar of Classico Tomato and Basil sauce.  I did not add extra salt to the cheese mixture, thinking there would be enough in the sauce, cheese mixture, and salted water to boil the noodles already. I did boil my noodles and so I did not add water to the edges.  

I personally felt there was not enough sauce to accommodate 12 noodles (there was enough cheese mixture).  Next time, I would definitely add a second jar of sauce or reduce noodles to 9.  It was more of lasagna "pie".  I guess I missed the addition of oregano (and it lacked salt ironically), but that is a function of the Classico sauce I used, plus I am biased by the two lasagna recipes I have used for years.  I did not find the use of spaghetti sauce to be that big of a time saver.  It simply saves you from opening a few cans of tomatoes, especially if you "doctor" your jarred spaghetti sauce anyway.  I guess I will stick to my two tried-and-true recipes, thus my giving 3 stars for "average", nothing special.

Good lasagna! My husband, a very picky eater, commented that this is the best lasagna he's ever had. "It's not too ricotta-y," he said. This is easy (for lasagna, which is always messy for me) and very tasty. I may add a little garlic next time. I also substituted non-fat ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese, and it was still very tasty.

Absolutely delicious!  As suggested by another user, I added garlic and onions to the meat while browning and used extra spaghetti sauce.  Lasagna was still very watery after 45 minutes covered and 10 uncovered, so I baked it for an additional 15 minutes uncovered.  Turned out great and everyone loved it!

This was easy and delicious.  I did make a few changes though.  I used half ricotta and half cottage cheese, with a little extra cottage cheese, I also used two whole cans of sauce (I think they were 24 oz each).  Instead of putting it in one big pan, I cooked it in two bread loaf pans (I was taking it two different places).  I also used italian seasoning instead of parsley.  It turned out really tasty and delicious, it was a bit runny though, probably since I used to much sauce.  Also make sure you let it set for 15-20 long minutes before digging in otherwise its really runny.

This recipe was excellent.  I was a little scared not boiling the noodles but it came out perfect.  I used ground turkey instead of beef, added 2 cloves of garlic and onion to the sauce, and used italian seasoning rather than the parsley.  Served it for guests and it was all gone.  Everyone went back for seconds.

I had a similar recipe at one time, but it was vegetarian.. So for this recipe, I used zucchini as a layer. I agree that ricotta or a ricotta/cottage cheese blend is best, but when on a tight budget or just have cottage cheese then cottage cheese is just fine.. I also used fresh parsley.

This lasagna turned out delicious, fast and easy!  I changed it up a bit...I used ground turkey and added fresh onions and fresh garlic.  Also, all of my ingredients were low fat...fabulous!

Cooked in 9x12 disposable pan with 3" sides. Tall pan allowed for expansion of liquids (no spills). I kept the foil on top for 50 mins - making sure the noodles were done - and they were. Left foil off for 10 mins at 400 deg to brown. Left on counter for 10 mins where it tightened up considerably. I added 1/2 chopped yellow onion, and 3 cloves crushed garlic to heated pan, added 1 lb hot Italian sausage for a mellow kick. I used 8oz organic ricotta (no carrageenan) for cheese mix and it sufficed for two thin layers - could use more.  Poured 1/4 cup red wine along edge. Result was delicious - everyone commented on flavor and said noodles were done! I'm a harsh critic of my own cooking and I liked this lasagna.  Will make it again.

as far as the taste of this dish went it was delicious. My rating though was only two stars because the portion sizes of the ingredients are all way off. And I thought the video said one thing and the written recipe said another when it came to how sauce to spread in initially and then the amount on each layer. For instance, there is no way in hell you can get 3/4 of a cup of the sauce mix to cover a 13 by 9 inch pan.  It took about  two cups of sauce on  each layer for me. plus the preparation time was more like 30 minutes not 15. But like with every recipe you got to make adjustments.

I used what I had on hand which was a healthier version and came out amazing.  I used whole grain lasagna, ground turkey instead of hamburger, 1.5 oz tomato basil spaghetti sauce, 15oz ricotta cheese in lieu of cottage, frozen parsley/basil cubes instead of dried.  I added onion, garlic, season salt/black pepper & some parsley/basil cubes to the meat and after browned added spaghetti sauce and simmered for 30 min.  Boiled lasagna for 8 min, drained & dried.  Mixed ricotta, 1/2 cup of parmesan (on accident didn't read i was only supposed to use half...but glad i used all of it) and the 2 eggs in separate bowl.  Layered as instructed and skipped the water.  Baked at 375 for 40 min and uncovered for additional 20.   Major hit with everyone! No one knew it was a healthier version until i told them.

Love it!! Iput half of cottage cheese and half of ricotta, and in the pasta sauce I put mushrooms and turkey sausage. Delicious!! Also made it veggie, with a mix of frozen vegetables and mushrooms in the pasta sauce instead of the ground beef.

I'm still a beginner when it comes to cooking and this recipe was pretty straight-forward, which I appreciate! I'd add more spaghetti sauce instead of water, but overall very yummy, hard to go wrong.

I love this receipe as is! Sooo great! Though I don't use the water, I just make sure the noodles are completely covered by either cheese or sauce so they don't get all crunchy in the oven. It's super cheesy, and the noodles come out al dente. The only other suggestion I have is to use a top quality sauce (we use Rao's marinara).

this lasagna is great! I made a few changes. added some fresh garlic and italian seasoning to the meat as it cooked. Used Prego tomato, basil & garlic sauce. Used half ricotta and half cottage cheese. Instead of just mozzarella I used the Kraft Italian five cheese blend. The cheese mixture was perfect for our family! actually added quite a bit more to the top! Left out the water, mainly because I cooked the noodles before hand.

A few people said the uncooked noodles did not get done. I found that covering the noodles with very hot tap water in the baking dish while I prepare the other ingredients really helps. Cover with foil and use the same foil when you bake it. No boiling and no sticking together. I add some extra water around the edge (maybe 3-4 Tbsp) and the dish MUST be covered with foil most of the cooking time. I pair the cottage cheese with Swiss cheese which has a lot more flavor than mozzarella.

My first time making lasagna and I loved it! I followed the advice of other reviews and reduced the amount of water to 1/4 cup and also added another half jar of spaghetti sauce. I had a ton of the cottage cheese mix left over so next time I think I will only use 24oz so I don't waste so much of it. It was super easy to make and tasty!

I followed the recipe pretty close and really enjoyed this lasagna, but would make a few changes next time. I substituted the cottage cheese for ricotta cheese because that is what I had on hand. I had read several reviews that suggested cutting the amount of cheese in half and next time I would do that. The cheese took over the lasagna and was too much for my taste. I also would use more tomato sauce because I did not have enough to cover the top and I did not add too much for the layers. I also did not add the water around the edges and it cooked just fine. I did make this with extra lean ground beef and low fat cheeses and it was really good.

This is perfect!  I really like the World's Best Lasagna on this site and it's not TOO hard, but sometimes you just want the basic lasagna that your mom used to make.  This is just like Mom's, down to the cottage cheese and the jarred sauce.  I made 2 smaller lasagnas and had to use more noodles because of it, and I cut the cottage cheese down to one 16 ounce container..  Update:  To turn this into 2 8x8 lasagnas, I use one full box of noodles (I have one and a half left over) and one giant jar of sauce (45 oz).  I used one full carton cottage cheese plus about 1/2 c. ricotta, and I steamed up some fresh spinach and chopped it for the "green" instead of parsley.

This was a great recipe! It was a super delicious lasagna. I tweaked the recipe slightly by using large curd cottage cheese, adding spinach and when adding the water I added the water inside of the pasta sauce jar to make it water pasta sauce.  Overall, this was very easy recipe and it came out fantastic. The whole house loved it.  Thanks for the great recipe I'm sure we'll make this again.

My Minor for my Bachelor's degree was in the Culinary Arts.  I tried this recipe because of the quick prep/cook-time & was very disappointed.  It tasted OK but the water that is "added around the edges", turned the top into a soupy mess

We cooked this in our nutrition lab and it was delicious.It packed flavor but at the same time it wasn't as fattening.

This recipe is divine! I make lasagna very rarely and this one was so easy! I used the exact amount of cheese it called for, but used 2- 24 oz jars of sauce (Classico) instead of the 32 oz it calls for, and used all of it. I also added minced garlic to the sauce b/c my husband loves garlic, and used the "No Boil" noodles, which worked very well. I added Italian seasoning to a couple layers as well because we love our food very seasoned! The recipe is fantastic though and was very easy to make. It was the perfect consistency as well. I would recommend to everyone! (I also used the parchment paper/aluminum foil by reynold's wrap to line the pan and it made the cutting and cleanup so easy!) enjoy!

OK, the lasagna is in the over, baking.  First off, I want to say that it took me 45 minutes to prepare it, not 15 minutes, what were they thinking!  The changes I made were pretty much like everyone recommended:  2 24-oz tomato sauce, a 24 oz. carton of cottage cheese, and added onion, mushrooms, and garlic to the meat mixture (ground chicken, in my case).  When I saw how much sauce and cheese mixture I had, I decided to use a larger pan (9x16), and I was able to make more lasagna layers (I used 16 lasagna strips). The cheese mixture and sauce tasted wonderful, I can't wait to taste the finished !product!  I think it will make about 16 servings, which is just right for tonight's meeting!   Update: I baked the lasagna for 1 hour, it was delish, and it was all eaten in one session.  Next time I will leave out the water at the end, it wasn't necessary with two jars of sauce.

Great Recipe.   I did use a 16 oz jar of 1% cottage cheese instead of two of them.   I also added extra pasta sauce (without meat) to the bottom of the pan instead of wasting the sauce with the meat to the bottom of the pan.  I didn't measure the sauce, but instead eyeballed the sauce added to the meat and the rest was added to the bottom of the pan.   I used the X-LARGE jar of ragu pasta sauce. It worked out great.

I'll admit it, I was skeptical. But being a mom of 2 wild boys under age 4 who both decide to get totally crazy from 5-6 every night, I need fairly easy and quick meals to save my sanity. The meat can be browned ahead of time and you can skip the simmering step. It was easy to make (no veggies to dice!) and turned out delicious. Try it with the cottage cheese. I am sold. I altered it by using the standard large cottage cheese size (24 ounces or so), two jars of 24 oz sauce, and 4 cups mozzarella. I threw in 2 cloves garlic with the meat. Mmmm, can't wait for leftovers.

I only used 24oz of cottage cheese. I also added sharp cheddar cheese to mix as well as topping. Turned out great! My man went for seconds. Oh, more sauce.

Easy and will be making it more often. I used two jars of sauce and fresh sliced mushrooms. I did add a little water around the edges of the pan once assembled. Using raw noodles worked fine and it was not dry at all. The lasagna held it's shape very well.

My two year old and I made this together, it was so easy! I did sub ricotta for cottage cheese and Italian sausage for the beef. Next time I think I will use more sauce and a little more meat. Very Tasty!

Really delicious! I've been looking for a good lasagna recipe and this is definitly it. Only thing is that I forgot to put water around the edges so that part was a little hard, but that was my fault. Everything else was perfect!

It was delicious! Everything was in the right proportions except for the sauce. I added more and more meat (we're meat lovers) and it was perfect for our family. So easy and yummy. My son asked for thirds!

My husband and I LOVED this!  We used 48 oz of spaghetti sauce and only 24 oz of cottage cheese.  The noodles were a little underdone, but we think it's just based on oven differences.  Cooked it a little longer and it was GREAT.

This lasagna is super easy and simple. I like to add zucchini, mushrooms, etc to fill it out a little. I actually like my lasagnas loaded with cheese, so I found this to be a pretty good amount. I use more mozzarella and less ricotta (instead of cottage). In the cheese mixture I add some Italian seasoning.

I loved the recipe. As for other reviews, I used 1/4 less cheese and it was a bit to cheesy anyway. Didn't use any salt and it was fine. I found the spaghetti sauce was too much too. NExt time I'll add more water and less sauce.

Fantastic! I didn't add any salt/pepper (but that's to my taste), and prepared this for a friend who just got home from having a baby, plus an extra one for my family. Paired it with homemeade french bread & Salad. I only hope that my friend was able to get enough because my husband and I ate half the pan by ourselves!

I love that you don't have to precook the noodles in this recipe. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and it turned out great. Also freezes and reheats well  for leftovers.

Awesome! I have used this recipe several times. I never measure it out for each layer as the instructions say. I just make sure to have extra sauce so I won't run out, and then just assemble the layers generously. As some other reviewers mentioned I also end up with extra cheese mixture, so I recommend that you either spread it very generously or reduce how much you mix up.  This is very yummy as-is, but to put some WOW into it I like to sauté fresh chopped onions in olive oil before cooking the ground beef, and adding either fresh or canned diced tomatoes and some additional Italian herbs. The chunkiness of the onions and tomatoes makes it so delightful and satisfying, and still very easy! Putting the Parmesan on the top before covering it with foil is pure genius! Besides tasting good it keeps the mozzarella from sticking to the foil.

Very easy and everyone loved it!  I did use ricotta cheese and mixed with the shredded mozarella, which was perfect.  Also, I left sauce out so folks could put more sauce on if they wished, since some like it saucier.  Great and easy!

This was my first lasagna and it came out great. I used turkey instead of beef, although this could easily be a vegetarian dish as well.  I layered spinach between the cheese & the sauce.  I also used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, and fresh parsley because we had some laying around.

Not perfect but definately will go into my regular rotation.  Quick and easy to prepare.  Good taste and texture.  I added a little more liquid and baked about 10 minutes longer.  Thanks so much for the post.

This was so yummy! I have made it twice in the past 2 weeks. It taste delicious after refrigeration and freezing, as well. I am cooking at high altitude (7200 ft) and put about 1/4 cup more water than the recipe called for. As other reviews said, the cheese mixture was too much. With that in mind, however, just load up the layers with more cheese mixture than you'd think you would need to. I replaced the cottage cheese with ricotta (I'm a purist) and added minced garlic and basil to the sauce and let it simmer with the added spices and beef for about 30 minutes instead of five. Fantastic!

5 stars for ease of preparation and good taste/consistency. I've also made it subbing 1 cup thawed, drained spinach for the ricotta/cottage cheese--very nice and not as rich.

PERFECT.  That's all I have to say.  I followed the recipe exactly (with cottage cheese) and our guests LOVED it!  I've never enjoyed a lasagna as much as this one before!

Ok, so I am irish wih an italian husband, I was so nervous to try this lasagna, but I had to simply because of time, MIL birthday (italian mother in law)OMGosh! This was a huge hit! With italians! HOWEVER! I could not possibly have made lasagna without these much necessary changes--->1. Couldn't bring myself to use cottage cheese, I used low fat ricotta. 2. What is lasagna without fresh cut minced garlic and basil!?!? So I chopped up 3. garlic shallots and added to sauce, I added the basil under the top layer of cheese. 4. I had some sweet italian pork sausage on hand and threw that in the mix, I think it made the whole thing! All in all, my husband was beyond impressed by his irish wife ;0) MIL was also! BIG hit! Also on a side note, you can easily cut the cheese mixture in half, this is WAY to much!

Six of us ate Lasagna last night at my house. I used the Easy Lasagna II recipe and it was wonderful. There wasn't even any left over for the dog to lick the pan. This morning I talked to one of the couples and they commented that it was the best Lasagna they'd ever had. They went so far as to say that if they were going out to eat and wanted Lasagna this recipe would be what they were willing to pay a good restuarant to eat.

A super easy and flavorful lasagna!  I was very pleased at how this lasagna turned out considering how easy it was to make!  The things I changed were I sauteed onions and garlic and then I browned the ground beef with them.  I also used 1/2 cottage cheese and 1/2 ricotta cheese instead of all cottage.  I thought it gave it a nicer texture and flavor.  My husband really like this dish and was happy to have it as leftovers for the next 2 nights as well.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

The entire family liked this one.  I like that you don't have to cook the noodles before assembling.
I did use only 24 oz cottage cheese and it seemed to be plenty.  Also, had left out the parmesean.  
Will definately make this one again.

Not enough flavoring in this recipe to rate it a perfect 5 stars... needs Italian seasoning, extra garlic, etc.  Other than that was TOTALLY easy and quick to prepare.  It seemed to have enough liquid by the time it was all assembled, so I only added 1/4 c. water around the edges.  It still turned out slightly runny, so next time I'll probably use even less than that.  I will definitely make this again, maybe tweaking it to my own tastes a little more.

This is really good I added mushrooms and onion to mine. While I ground the beef I added 2tsp of apple cider vinegar this kicked the flavor of the meat up a notch.  Thank you!

Amazing! So easy! Made it almost exactly as the recipe states but I only had one egg so I used only one egg and added a little oil to help with the binding. Everyone in my little family ate more than 1 helping and over half of the pan was gone. This is going in my regular dinner rotation schedule!

This lasagna recipe is great, and a real time saver. I sub ricotta for the cottage cheese and use 12 lasagna noodles. My family really likes it, and I love how quick and easy it is.

Great recipe! I found it was kinda runny with regular cottage cheese so I used dry curd cottage cheese instead ... turned out awesome. This is now our favorite lasagna recipe.

AWESOME lasagna (according to my boyfriend who's a SUPER picky eater).  He said it was the best lasagna he's ever had!! And it's SUPER DUPER easy to make!! (This was my first lasagna attempt!)  I added a lot more sauce to the layers because he likes sauce -- and I accidentally added too much cheese to the filling (1 cup too much) -- he said it was a bit too cheesy for him but otherwsie GREAT (he's not a super cheese lover)!  Because I used so much sauce, I didn't add any water.  The noodles were perfect!

We made it again yesterday (still not adding extra water).  This time we didn't add enough extra sauce tho for my boyfriend's liking but for a conventional lasagna, it looked perfect!!!  (His Brother Loved it!!)  My boyfriend said it tasted AWESOME (yet again) even tho it wasn't saucy enough for him!!!  (I think this is a tough recipe to screw up)!!  

We added a layer of sauteed, sliced portabello mushrooms; used 1 container of cottage cheese combined with 1 egg, etc. for the filling (we didn't add any other cheese to the cheese filling); and then grated marble cheese for the top layer.  He loved it!!!  

I can highly recommend this recipe to first time lasagna makers.  (I used Ragu original spaghetti sauce, which is actually surprisingly good here.  I also used garlic salt in the cottage cheese, and seasoned the beef with a bit of onion powder and garlic salt.)

i used to buy frozen lasagna because i thought it would be too much work to cook it.  this was my first time attempting to cook lasagna and it was very easy and this recipe came out surprisingly delicious!  much better than what i've been eating out of a box.  i only needed half the recommended amount of cheese.  i used ricotta cheese instead of cottage.  i browned the beef with onion and garlic.  i used oregano instead of parsley.  i didn't add any water in fear of it becoming too watery and my lasagna turned out perfectly fine.  one more thing, don't worry about not boiling the noodles, they will come out nice and tender.

Very good and easy to make.  I used the suggestions of several reviewers to add extra veggies and sauce and switch to ricotta cheese, and had no problems with the no-boil lasagna noodles.

excellent recipe.  this is only my second recipe i have tried, and it was just excellent.  i even screwed up the layering, and had to add the mozzarella as a layer by itself twice between the sauce layers at the top, and cover with the mozzarella... i don't think one can screw this up.  enough for a couple meals and frozen leftovers (two person family).  thank you for this special recipe. robbie

This lasagna is perfect! Notice the full amount of mozzarella and Parmesan does not go into the cheese mixture, the instructions have you set some aside to top the lasagna at the end. I wonder if those saying there is “too much cheese mixture” added all the mozzarella and Parmesan to the mixture by mistake, because it came out perfectly for me when I followed the instructions exactly. To those saying it’s dry, I wonder if they used “oven ready” lasagna noodles instead of regular, which absorb more water and might make a dryer lasagna unless you adjust other parts of the recipe for that.. When followed exactly as written, my family and friends always compliment this recipe. It’s the best!

While this isn't a complicated recipe, I do think it requires a fair bit of prep work to get it done... But what lasagna doesn't? 
IMHO, this recipe would be bland without the changes I made, per the recommendations of other reviews.
Here's what I did, and I will add even more seasoning next time.
1 jar pasta sauce & 1 can fire roasted diced tomatoes w/ green chiles (with juice), and I did NOT add water bc I soaked my noodles while I prepped everything else. I added the following to the sauce: a hefty tsp of crushed red pepper, 1/2 small onion diced small,  and a tsp of prepared minced garlic (I will use more garlic next time or maybe some garlic powder). In the cheese mixture, I used 16oz ricotta, the rec amt of mozzarella (I used a 6 cheese Italian blend & mozzarella), eggs & parmesan, and added a big pinch of dried basil, oregano,  and some fresh parsley (minced) bc I had it already. Next time, I will use more of each seasoning in the cheese. I seasoned the cheese mixture with some kosher salt & fresh cracked black pepper.
Note: I think using half sausage would work nicely here to add a flavor boost (as others have done, but I didn't do this time).
I baked mine at 375 for 45 min, then uncovered and baked 15 min more. I let it rest for a good 10-15 min before cutting, and it was the perfect consistency (not runny and the noodles were cooked). 
For my taste, next time it will be a 5 star with the additions I mentioned and some sausage.h

This was absolutely delicious. I have a very bland palate, but my boyfriend (who enjoys tastier food) also said it was very good. I made a few small tweaks - I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, added seasoning salt to the beef when it was cooking and no additional water. Will definitely make again!

Well, I took a chance and I was sorry for it. The uncooked noodles were fine(I do it with my Manicotti), but don't ever substitute cottage cheese for Ricotta. It is NOT the same and it is NOT a substitute for any reason. And it is an easy recipe so how is it different if you dumped a carton of ricotta vs. a carton of cottage cheese. Makes all the difference in the world. Sorry. R.I.P. Chef Cosmo

I've been making this version of lasagna for years when I wanted a little something different from spaghetti.  It's quick and easy, but also comforting.

You do not need to use no-cook lasagna noodles, and those taste awful anyway. I make all lasagna recipes with regular noodles (usually whole wheat). Just assemble it a couple hours ahead, refrigerate until baking time, and noodles will be soft. No need to add extra water to pan.

Fried the beef with 2 tsps of garlic and one finely chopped onion.  Added 2 teaspoons of Italiano seasoning when I added in 1 1/2 bottles of spaghetti sauce (1 bottle is not enough to soften noodles).  I added a generous amount of fresh spinach on top of the final layer of sauce.  Topped it off with the final layer of noodles and sprinkled mozzarella generously on top. I omitted the salt and the pepper; with the Italiano seasoning and the garlic it wasn't necessary.  I also added the half cup of water poured around the sides - a must!  To keep it from bubbling over I tore a large piece of tinfoil and placed the pan on top of the foil and then brought it all up to wrap it  like a present, that did the trick and the little juice that bubbled out caught nicely in the tinfoil.

Such an easy and great recipe. It really does not take more than 1.5 hours and the recipe is so easy to put together. Like many others i replaced cottage cheese with ricotta and did not use water since I like my pasta dry.  Made this for a dinner party and everyone love it so much that I had to whip up an extra lasagna for them to take some home.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

For being a simplified lasagna this was great. It set up well (wasn't soupy) and wasn't dry. I used what I had on hand which meant all the cheeses were reduced by half - I liked the end result so much I'll keep it that way in the future.

Per other suggestions, used 15 oz ricotta cheese and left over meat sauce from World's Best Pasta Sauce! Came out great. and super easy to make. Thanks to OP and other reviewers. EDIT: Made 2nd time w/ cottage cheese as listed and may actually like this better. Either way, terrific and bumping to 5 stars.

This is the easiest lasagna ever, so I was worried about how it would taste. Fortunately, my family and I loved it! The only downfall for me was that my kids actually liked it better than the lasagna I normally make. ??

Made this today. So yummy. I altered with 50/50 lean ground beef and sweet Italian sausage. Didn't end up using all of the cheese mixture that the recipe called for.

To make it better: throw in a jar of sliced black olives and a jar of artichoke hearts into the cheese, and use the can liquids instead of water. And use herbs de provence instead of plain parsley. And either use spaghetti sauce with mushrooms, or else sauté some fresh ones in olive oil and add to the meat mix. 

Used ricotta instead of cheddar cheese.. Make all cheese low fat and this is a nicely healthy dish as well. The best part is that the leftovers get better and better, up to a week!

I followed the recipe exactly and my husband said "best lasagna I've ever had", and that is AMAZING coming from him. He is an extremely picky eater. This was no more difficult than any other weeknight dinner so I'm sure it will be added to our rotation!

I've made this recipe multiple times and have gotten nothing but positive feedback. I love it, it's better than the ones you can buy in the store. I don't use the parsley but other than that I follow the instructions and it comes out perfectly. Absolutely delicious, my family loves this recipe and is always asking me to cook it again.

This lasagna was pretty good. It did seem like it took a little longer to bake than my usual lasagna, but I always pre-boil my noodles. I think that my lasagna really needed to set the whole 10 minutes to firm up, but with hubby and hungry kiddos hanging around the kitchen 10 minutes is forever. I will definetely make again. I did add one and half jars for the sauce as I made it pretty meaty and only used 16 oz of cottage cheese as that is all that I had, but those really was the only alterations that I made to this recipe. I'm sure it's great as written without alterations. Thanks for sharing.

This was a soupy disaster.  Too much cottage cheese that I don't know what to do with afterwards - half amount is enough.  I didn't even bother to add water in the end, as it was obviously watery already, AND the outcome was still nothing better than something in the water.  Maybe using spaghetti sauce is not right. It's just toooo loose & watery.  .. or maybe it requires 2 hours or so to cook something decent. This is the worst lasagna I've ever made.  I'm not impressed with this recipe at all.  Just two stars, as it's still edible if we have to.

This was a very easy lasagna and it turned out great. I took some of the other review's advice and used Ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. Next time I'm going to use more meat and a little less cheese.

My family was skeptical of the cottage cheese and were refusing to try it. Then it came out of the oven and everyone tastes it. Empty plates with seconds for all . I did reduce the cottage cheese to 24 oz. but kept everything else the same. This will be repeated in my house!

This recipe provides very good basic proportions for lasagna. I used browned, crumbled Italian sausage rather than ground beef. I used no-boil lasagna noodles to ensure that they would be soft after cooking. Also, I used parmesan shreds instead of powdered grated parmesan. When I use cottage cheese instead of ricotta in a lasagna, I always run it through my food processor to break the curds. No one will know it isn't ricotta and it's a lot cheaper!

Very, Very Good !!!! Followed the recipe, but felt I needed 1 extra can the spaghetti sauce and added chopped frozen spinach for colour. I made this recipe the night before, covered in frig. When I took it out a few hours before cooking, I found the noodles already soft to the touch. It baked up beautiful and was a great treat for my company. Don't be scared to use this recipe, because you and your family will fine it fantastic and very tasty. Marlene VanKatwyk (canada)

Easy delicious recipe. Only thing I changed was added more sauce. And used only half the cottage cheese and added ricotta.  ENJOY!

Amazing recipe.. I only used 28 ounces of spaghetti sauce and thought that was more than enough! Also used a blend of provolone and mozzarella shredded cheese.

This was really good! I served this at a dinner party, and everyone loved it. I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese only because the ricotta was on sale. The ricotta was a bit dry for this recipe, so I'll definitely be using cottage cheese the next time I make this. I might try adding some italian sausage to the meat mixture next time, but honestly, the original recipe is very good! The best part is that this really was an easy lasagna!

This was my first time making lasagna from "scratch" and I was skeptical about it coming out right.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it definitely needed more sauce (which I added, I used about 1.5-1.75 jars of sauce).  Unlike other reviews, I found the cheese ratio to be fine, I eyeballed the amount of parmesan and used an Italian mix cheese bag instead of just mozza.

Instead of putting a layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of the dish, I just put some of the spaghetti sauce instead.  I was generous with both cheese and meat sauce layers (compared to the recipe) and I used express noodles so I did not use the water portion of the recipe.  I also added in some arugula to the cheese mixture (I didn't have spinach, but would have used that instead).

The lasagna came out absolutely PERFECT (I did put it under the broiler on LOW for 10 minutes to brown the cheese).  But it held together beautifully, with just the right amount of flavor and cheese was perfect.

It was an absolute hit and was so easy to make!  This is definitely a keeper!!

Absolutely fantastic and easy! Although like other reviewers i think there was way too much cottage cheese. I cut back on that significantly and only used 16 oz. It was still plenty. Very good and easy recipe

This was perfect (imo) after an adjustment in cheese and amount of sauce in the recipe. I used 15 ounces of Ricotta cheese instead of cottage because of personal preference and increased the sauce to 46 ounces (jar). The brand of sauce that I feel makes a delicious lasagna, out of the many I've tried, is Prego Traditional. After assembling the lasagna I baked it for 40 minutes, removed the foil, then continued baking for 20 more minutes (I like the cheese on top to be browned and bubbly). **Additional notes: I omitted the water completely and the noodles still turned out perfect (not crunchy at all! Lol) but I think it's because I used more sauce than the original recipe called for and made sure every bit of noodle was covered well by the sauce when I layered it. 

I also did a couple things to the jar sauce and ground beef to make it more to my liking, adding 1 Tbsp of sugar, 1 tsp garlic powder, and about 1 1/2 tsp dried italian seasoning.

I am no expert cook at all, so I followed this recipe exactly except I think she meant 12 lasagna noodles instead of 9, so I used 12. This was by far the BEST lasagna I've ever made! This was the first time my lasagna was not runny, soupy, or sloppy. It was actually a solid form like you'd get at a restaurant!  I didn't mind using cottage cheese because it's cheaper than ricotta.  It was so delicious.  And my husband said that this lasagna makes him wish I was a stay at home wife, so I could make more dinners like this!

Made this recipe, not only is it easy but it's DELICIOUS, my son even said it's better than his friend's Mom's Lasagna(the woman is a great cook, so it was a HUGE compliment). I did use 2 jars of sauce, and all of the cheese mixture, it is REALLY filled my 9 x 13 pan, I would reccommend putting a pan under it so it doesn't get all over your oven.  Definitely fantastic and a go to recipe.

This was a good basic lasagna recipe. I follwed the recipe almost exactly. subbed ricotta for cottage cheese and used 2 24 oz. jars of sauce rinsed out with water.  It could have actually used a little more sauce imo as the noodles soak up the sauce.

Just finished this for supper and everyone loved it. Even the picky eater kids. It was fairly easy to make but a little labor intensive with the meat sauce and cheese filler being made simultaneously. The best part is the different flavors that come through. Of course you have the cheeses but then there is the flavored meat sauce and the noodles which cooked perfectly. I followed it to the letter and it is one of the best lasagnas we have ever had. Will definitely make it again, that is as soon as the leftovers are gone. I highly recommend this.

This recipe was really good! The only thing I did different was use 1/2 lb of lean ground beef and 1/2 lb of Italian sausage. I also added 1/2 tsp each of garlic salt, basil, and oregano to the sauce. I also used a 15 oz tub of ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. I needed two 24 oz jars of Prego because I ran short of sauce using the 32 ounces the recipe called for. My family loved it and I will definitely make this again soon!

This recipe was just OK flavor wise and it did not cook the noodles fully - not even al dente. I will probably take my own recipe and craft it after this recipe by adding water in a little greater quantity than this recipe called for and also cook it a little longer under foil.  I really like the idea of not cooking the noodles beforehand.  That is a great time saver!

Husband (former chef) says this is the best he's ever had.  And I used no-cook straight-to-the-oven noodles; ran out of mozzarella so used extra parmesan, bottled marinara sauce, and added baby spinach to the meat mixture.  baaaaahaaaaaa!

This was a great recipe.  I did add my own twist.  First, I added 2 mild italian sausage links with the hamburger-drain fat and set aside. I then sautéed onion, mushrooms, 3 garlic cloves and a bay leaf and then added the spaghetti sauce to the pan.  I let that sauce simmer 15min and added fresh herbs:  basil, italian parsley, oregano and thyme to the sauce.  I layered it up like the directions, fantastic!

I've never made Lasagna before (my wife usually made it) so I took a shot at it with this recipe.... pretty darn good if I do say so myself :)
I did chop up a medium onion and a  large green pepper and saute them first before adding the ground beef and browning it.
I also had an opened package of Provolone cheese so I didn't want to open up a new package of Mozzarella, not knowing what I would get, it worked out great too! My wife and I loved the flavors and I loved how easy this was to make and that my first ever attempt at making one worked out so well! Thanks!

Delicious and SUPER simple to make!  We added a few cloves of garlic and an onion when we were browning the ground beef - what lasagne doesn't get better with those flavors!  It freezes well, and turns into a delicious, easy meal, upon thawing and reheating!

We thought this was a good lasagna recipe - fairly similar to the one I normally make, but a little overboard in the cheese layers. I pre-boiled my noodles for about 8 minutes and only used a 24-ounce container of cottage cheese and it was still too cheesy for us. I'd cut the cheese filling portion to about half (1 1/2 cups of cottage cheese, 1 cup of mozzarella, 1 egg, 1/4 cup parm, S&P and parsley). That would have been a better ratio for us, it still tasted fantastic! I also subbed Johnsonville Italian Sausage for the ground beef which was a wonderful addition, it added great flavor and a hearty texture! ETA After heating leftovers I would actually probably not change the cheese amount - it reheats really well and the cheese layers aren't overly gooey after it has a chance to fully set. My son requested I make this one "more often". :)

It's very resilient - I made multiple simultaneous mistakes and it still came out great.

I was expecting house guests and wanted to make up several meals in advance. I gambled on this recipe and it was a huge success. I made the recipe as instructed except for adding the water at the end and baking it. I put the unbaked covered dish in the freezer. 2 weeks later, on one of the days my guests were here, I took the covered dish out  early in the morning before we went out for the day. That evening, I added the water and cooked the meal as instructed. It took 30-45 minutes longer as the lasagna was still slightly frozen and very cold. I admit I was nervous as I had never made lasagna without precooking the noodles. My guests raved about the meal. I  will be making this again.

I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. It came out amazing and was even better as leftovers.

Honestly, this works in a 8x8 square baking dish. I just cut the cottage cheese amount in half and made a mozzerella cheese layer. I actually needed seven lasagna noodles, cut in half they layered five across and two lengthwise at the end for a full layer. I also cooked my lasagna noodles and skipped the water step. Very simple lasagna that my oldest could help me make. Keep in mind that this needs spices and personal touches to give it some oomph.

Awesome and tasty even with healthy adjustments!  Love that the noodles do not need to be cooked separately. We used whole wheat noodles and substituted ground turkey (we're watching cholesterol) and added more (heart healthy, low sodium) sauce since turkey is drier than beef. Also added fresh grated garlic. We used all low fat or fat free cheeses and it turned out fabulous! Definitely a new go-to recipe!

This was my first attempt at making lasagna.  It took me about 40 minutes to assemble, instead of 15.  I followed the recommendations to use 16 oz of ricotta cheese.  I used 2 15 cans of tomato sauce, and half a jar of pasta sauce.  The tomato sauce was a mistake (it was way too runny).  That combined with the extra water resulted in lasagna soup.  It still tasted good, but I think next time I will try a recipe where you boil the noodles first, so don't need as much liquid.  And I'll definitely look for a thicker sauce.

The taste was great, but unfortunately, my noodles were still crunchy.  I followed the cooking instructions and the noodles weren't even close to being done.

This works perfectly.  I make a few changes when I prepare: substitute half the cottage cheese with ricotta, used Italian seasoning instead of parsley, added some crushed red pepper, and used 1/2 C red wine instead of water.  I've made this with ground lamb instead of beef for a richer version.  This always turns out and is delicious!  Thank you, Joanie!

As other reviewers have said, I used this as a base lasagna recipe.  I omitted the beef, added a sweet onion, 2 cloves garlic, mushrooms, and some fresh basil to the sauce.  I did not use the water.  The lasagna set up nicely and was very tasty!  I will definitely make this again.

What a huge success this was... I did change two things.... I used 15 oz. Ricotta Cheese instead of Cottage Cheese & used 3/4 cup Parmesan Cheese instead of 1/2 cup.  Love how you don't have to cook the lasagna noodles first!  I let it sit after baking and it stays together beautifully after cutting.  I will be making this for my family for many years.

We loved this! I was even a little short on the cottage cheese and had to substitute shredded american for some of the mozz, but it was still awesome. I also seasoned the ground beef with garlic and italian seasoning before combining it with the sauce. Next time I will add some of the other fun stuff people have mentioned, like the mushrooms! Thanks for the recipe!

I used this recipe to make my very first lasagna 4 years ago(2006) and it's the only one I've used since!! It was a huge hit with my in-laws and one of my husband's favorite dinners! I agree the cheese mixture is too much so I just cut down on the cottage cheese. Other than that, I love it, yum!

This was very easy and yummy!  I had never made lasagna before, so I was really hoping it turned out.  It tasted wonderful!  I did add quite a bit of extra sauce.  I made the recipe in two 8x8 pans and needed to use extra sauce once I made it to that top layer.  :o)

This is definitely the best recipe if you're looking for the classic meat and cheese lasagna.  I took it to a holiday party this evening and it received rave reviews.  Every last bite was devoured.  Personally, I prefer the cottage cheese -- keeps it more moist and cheesy than the ricotta.

Loved it,  made it just as directed.  Only problem I had was that there was just not enough meat sauce for me.  Flavor was fab and the kiddos loved it too.

OK....I tried to listen to the advice of others. I made sure that I added extra sauce so it wouldn't dry out. But then it turned out pretty runny. And there was no way that only 9 noodles were going to cover it all. So I had to use 12. It fell apart pretty easy but no one really complained much. I would try this again with a tad less sauce than I used this time. ((It was wonderful the next day though!!))

UPDATE: I did this recipe again and used a large can of sauce along with a small can of tomato sauce with seasonings added. It turned out wonderful the night of. The leftovers were a lot more dry but I guess you have to decide which you prefer. LOL...I will keep it runny the day of ((as no one seemed to mind anyway)) That way my full pan of leftovers will stay amazing!!

This lasagna recieved rave reviews, "best lasagna I ever had!" I used fat free cottage cheese which made it a bit runnier. I also cooked the noodles al dente beforehand. Delicious!

So easy! I used ricotta cheese except for cottage cheese, and also used ground turkey for ground beef.  We both loved it! I also used a lot of fresh garlic.

Nice, simple, easy. I am married to a picky eater who swears that my late mother tried to kill him several years ago when she made lasagna. He loved this recipe and said it was tasty. I did substitute 15 oz of ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese and added two cloves of garlic and two teaspoons of italian seasoning blend to the hamburger while it was browning.  I also put 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and a generous splash of red wine into the sauce mixture. My husband says his faith in lasagna has been restored. Can't wait to have leftovers.

Super easy recipe! Since I used a much smaller pan (for only 2 people) I  eyeballed some ingredients, but this turned out great. Another reviewer's remark about adjusting the amount of water used because of the consistency of the sauce was a huge tip. I used cottage cheese, but would like to try ricotta next time and had ground turkey instead of beef, but you couldn't tell the difference. I also followed some other tips and added onion and garlic to the meat when frying. Thanks for the recipe!

Score!!! Easy, convenient ingredients around the house. I strongly agree with some suggestions below... 1. change the 1/2 cup of water added just before baking to 1/4 water mixed with 1/4 red wine... GREAT flavor!! 2. To avoid a soupy consistancy, turn up temp to 400 for the last 10 (and leave it in the oven for an extra 5-10 min if you have the extra time before dinner) PERFECT lasagna... one of the easiest and best I've made! Hubby loved it!

Really good and quick for lasagna. I added more sauce as others suggested and a touch of brown sugar to tame the acidic taste from jarred sauce. Great recipe as is or easy to alter to your taste.

I thought this recipe was really good but I did make a few changes. I used home made sauce and ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese and I omitted the eggs due to allergies. I thought it was very good but that the noodles were a bit firm, but were still good. Thank you for a great recipe!

This is a great basic recipe.  I made some changes by using 1/2 lb of gound beef and 1/2 lb italian sausage.Canned spagetti sauce and cooked my noodles(too nervous about not cooking the noodles) and omitted the water. My parents and family said this was one of the best lasagnas they ever had!

I loved this recipe, it was very easy and pretty quick.  I had to feed 5 airman on the last minute notice, they all loved it.  Next time I would add more sauce and meat and a little less cheese though.  Very cheesy, and even when I added 44oz of sauce instead of 32, it still wasn't a lot of sauce. That's the only thing I would change, Very Good!

I thought is was great. I added a few things though. I added a layer of corn and a layer of french style green beans. I also added a pound of pork sausage to the sauce mix. My family absolutely loves it.

I like this recipe a lot. Easy to make, tastes great. I did have a problem with it being watery. I am going to try mixing the extra liquid with the sauce next time and use a little larger pan to see if that makes a difference. It seemed that it just sat on top and did not reach the bottom of the pan because there was no room for it to get there. With a more even distribution, I am hoping that it will take care of the soupiness.

I'm really not at all confident with cookery, but I've made this twice now and it makes me feel great when it comes out of the oven. The first time I used up some chopped large mushrooms. this time I've stuck to the recipe, put some grated red cheese on top as I'm a bit of a cheesaholic. Anyway, great recipe to build up some confidence!! and p.s. it tastes divine!

This was great the first day, but the next day left-overs weren't good at all. We love next day lasagna and the flavor of this had changed by the next day.  It did taste somewhat better warmed in the oven as compared to microwave warming. Won't make again.

I made this for our restaurant's Christmas party.  I wanted somthing easy that would feed a lot of people.  It was a big hit.  I did make a few changes:  I added about 3 cloves of garlic, 1 onion, 1 shredded zuccini and split the cottage cheese with ricotta.  I also made a vegetarian version and just substituted more shredded zuccini for the beef. I will make this again.

This is my family's new favorite lasagna.  It was a hit with everyone.  I used oven-ready noodles, and they were nice and tender.  The amount of cheese and sauce was balanced very well and the dish tasted great.  No problems for me.

Like some of the others I substituted ricotta and I added some garlic. I have been wanting to add a lasagna dish to my bag of tricks for potlucks. The real trouble for me was with the noodles. I think I'll take the time and trouble to cook them first from now on. Oh yeah - the family hit it hard for seconds.Using the ready made sauce did make it quick and easy.

This was my first lasagna and I have to say it lived up to it's name, it was very easy to make. And the fam loved it! I did make a few small changes. I doubled the meat, added 16 oz. of ricotta cheese and used no boil noodles. But it went over great. I had always heard about how tough lasagna was to make, but now I have the confidence to try more complicated recipes.

We had friends over tonight, one of whom is known for her Italian cooking. Well, she was practically licking her plate. I made a few changes: I do not like meat in my lasagna so I skipped that step. I did bring the sauce to a simmer and added a couple of cloves of garlic. Also, I used 1/2 non-fat ricotta and 1/2 low-fat cottage cheese along with low-fat mozzerella. I used 4 cups mozzerella though! I used about 1/4 cup of water rather that 1/2 cup. To make it even easier, I put it all together earlier in the day while the kids where napping and then baked it covered for an hour and 20 minutes uncovered. This was so great and not hard at all!! I would highly suggest to anyone looking to feed a crowd but not wanting to cook for hours.

I really like this recipe.  I didnt havwe any ricotta.  I used 2 680ml cans of pasta sauce and 1 28oz can of diced tomatoes and no water.  I cooked the ground beef with onions, garlic and green peppers, then set that aside.  Then I heated up the tomatoes and sauce.  I covered the bottom of my dish with the sauce mix, 5 lasagna noodles(4 across and one at the edge), meat and veggie mix, sauce, noodles, etc..topped with marble cheese.  Was soo good and took no time at all.  Next time though I will use more meat and add the ricotta and spinsch.  Thanks for a good recipe.

This was fantastic!  I was cooking for someone that does not eat meat, and the recipe was just delicious, even without the beef.  I used a little less cottage cheese than it calls for (one 24 ounce tub was enough).  Also, I used the "oven-ready" variety of lasagna noodles, but I'm not sure if this is necessary.  This was a huge hit with my family and I am making it again tonight!

This lasagna came out great!  Like some others, I was nervous about not cooking the noodles but that was not a problem at all when it was finished.  I added some red peppers, squash, onions, and mushrooms which I sauteed with garlic and layered in after the cheese.

I will never slave over my old recipe again!  This lasagna tops them all.  My kids absolutely loved it, even the youngest who says he doesn't like lasagna.  I followed the recipe, but I'm always generous with the cheese. Definitely a "keeper".  Thanks!

I made this recipe last night, with just a little modification.  First, I was feeding 8, so i doubled it, except for the cottage cheese.  I used Ricotta instead, and did NOT double that ingredient.  Sprinkled garlic pepper and Italian spice over that layer, and again on top of the top layer of cheese. Added shredded carrots, chopped zucchini and some fresh spinach leaves. This got RAVE reviews, even from the picky 9 year old girl, and my 11 yr old son who does not like zucchini or spinach.  I simmered the sauce for about 15 minutes, then baked it in a 15x10x2 glass baking dish for the time indicated in the recipe.  I did not double the water either, used a bit more than 1/2 cup but not too much more.  Steamed green beans, lettuce salad and garlic bread, fabulous meal.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

Yum! Yum! Yum! Best Lasagna I've ever had!  This was my first time making Lasagna, it turned out beautiful!  I only had 24oz of Cottage Cheese, so I added 8 more oz of Mozzarella, turned out perfect!  I also diced half an onion and sauteed it with the hamburger.  Yummy!

We all enjoyed this one a lot! It is largely dependent on the jar of spag. sauce used though. I used Newman's Own Marinara sauce for test purposes. I used 15 noodles (5 layers). I was short a cup of mozarella and used monteray jack - it came out fine. I didn't have any cottage cheese, only had a small tub of ricotta and a small tub of sour cream. My hubby said this was the best lasagne I have made to date. I did use parmagiana reggiano (sp) cheese and I am convinced it is worth the cost! It has a much stronger and sharper flavor than the kind in the green cannister. This was so easy to fix and pretty quick. I loved that you didn't have to pre-cook the pasta. It is so much easier to work with the dry pasta noodles! A very forgiving recipe even with the substitutions I had to make.

Good. If I make again, I will add more sauce as it was abit dry, less ricotta cheese (I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese) and maybe some Italian seasoning and garlic.

Great for a quick and easy dinner, but I ended up with too much of the cottage cheese mixture.  Perhaps a little less cottage cheese?  Otherwise really good - definite hit!  Thanks!

My kid liked it! The kid that ONLY eats mac n' cheese! A brilliant recipe for working moms. Easy prep time and excellent end result. Will definitely cook again, would love to add some onions next time and maybe cook a little longer. I like the crispy edges! Thanks so much!

Yes, this was super easy, but that's all it was.  Flavor was ok, I'm not sure if it's because of the spaghetti sauce I used (Ragu traditional), but it was just average, maybe worse.  I made this for lunch and all of us were starving (7), only 1/2 of it was eaten.  No one took seconds...they opted for the mornings leftovers donuts...

This was very delicious.  I used the no-boil noodles, and you couldn't tell the difference.  It was a big hit!  Will definitely make it again.

I usually don't like cottage cheese in my lasagna, but this one was  delicious! We made a half recipe, but it was still so good! The half recipe called for 4 1/2 lasagna noodles, but we made it with 9 and it was delicious! I definitely recommend this recipe for a quiet night at home :)

My family loved it!  I didn't add salt because I find cottage cheese and Parmesan Cheese make it salty enough and I run cottage cheese in a food processor briefly just to get more of a traditional ricotta-ish texture.  So far the best recipe I found for lasagna without precooked noodles is a spinach lasagna so my family was so happy to finally get a "meat" lasagna with no green stuff lol!  This was delicious.  I did add a little garlic and onion to the meat while browning but I always do that and I'm sure this would have been just great without it.

Loved it! I haven't made lasagna in years. When I did make it, I never boiled the noodles. Fast forward to this Christmas eve and a request from my youngest who was flying in from AZ. My favorite brand of gf pasta is Tinkyada but I saw a rice/corn blend from Barilla, which I picked up instead. I used 1/2 ricotta and 1/2 cottage plus two jars of sauce. I look at recipes for suggestions and break off with what I have on hand and what I know from past experience. I season the meat and add the water into the sauce. I found a shaved blend of asiago, parmesan, and Romano with which I am a little heavy handed. I ended up having more cheese blend so I made a second, smaller dish. Everyone loved it. Today is the 3rd time I've made it and I'm using beyond meat and since I'm low on noodles, I have a two layers of baby spinach. Hoping it is just as good!

I like this one, and I love the cheesiness. My family likes a little more chunky, so I added a can of diced tomatoes, undrained. Honestly, I think it helped with the moisture issue too. I always doctor my sauce, since we like garlic a lot, and today I plan to use Italian sausage instead of ground beef. This recipe is my go-to for the technique, but I never make it the same twice.

The recipe was good and easy to make.  I added garlic and oregano to the cheese mixture.  I did not use the water.  Instead, I added about another cup of pasta sauce to the pan.  My family enjoyed it.

This turned out great! most meals I make last two days, got home from work and had about 1/4 left. My family loved it! I used a tip from someone that left a review and used a little white wine on the edges instead of water. Deeeelish!  Will definitely make this at least once a month. Took half the time than my normal recipe. Added sausage and a mixture of cheese with the ricotta.

EXCELLENT LASAGNA!  Easy or not, it still turned out to be one of the most delicious lasagnas my family of 5 has had, and rivaled my grandmother’s “secret,” 5-layer, 8-million-ingredient, “true Italian” lasagna!  Like many of the others, I subbed out the cottage for ricotta cheese (28 oz), probably 1.5-2.0x the mozzarella, and used Italian seasoning in the cheese mixture, versus just dried parsley. I also substituted “meatloaf mix” (1/3 beef, pork & veal) for just beef, and added 1/2 a package of sweet Italian sausage (minus the casing). I DID cook the noodles first so, with the additional marinara (probably ended up using 1.5 32oz jars of Rao’s), there was definitely no need for additional liquid at the end. A+ recipe, which I’ll make many more times in the years to come!

Excellent and easy to make.  I did not change anything on the recipe and it was very good, everyone loved it and wants it again!  It was even better the second day!  The best part was there was no need to cook the lasagna noodles.   Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

This was exactly what I was looking for. My entire family loved it. I used the no boil noodles with success. I have used them before on other recipes and it was disastrous. This had the good amount of sauce we were looking for as we don't like a too dry lasagna. Instead of a 13x9 pan I used two 8x8 pans and froze one for later. Definitely using again.

I add chopped onions and mushrooms when sauteeing the ground beef.  I also add spinach in between the layers sometimes.

I made this with sausage, added mushroom and onion. Used 2 cups of mozzarella. Didn't bother with adding water, just made sure there was plenty of sauce.

I added a tablespoon of oregano to the sauce because I did not have enough parsley and it was out of this world. My husband, my company and family loved it---so did I. It was the best I ever made.

I needed to cook it longer than stated. The noodles were not all done. I reheated it the next day and added a bit more water and it tasted nice. I’d like to add more vegetables and maybe just do ricotta, pork sausage and more veggies next time.

This has become my go to recipe to rave reviews from my family (even my picky son who usually hates anything with tomato sauce). The only change I make is using half cottage cheese and half ricotta.

Easy but not good for 2 people who have to have it as leftovers. That's when I really noticed that it did need more sauce like other reviews. Maybe ok for a potluck or party with many people to serve. I used whole box of lasagna noodles, not just 9 but didn't have very much sauce for the 1/4 cup layers and the meat didn't help it spread thinner so definitely need more for those layers. I used Costco brand maranara which had basil and garlic and may have been a larger size than was called for. I also added 1/8 tsp nutmeg to ricotta mixture for a light added flavor, but not overly seasoned. ( I tried a different lasagna recipe that had 1/4 tsp which was good but a little too much for me after a few bites.)

I ended up making pretty good lasagna with this, but made some modifications to do it. I thought the idea of quick, throw-together lasagna was a great idea. I still do, but the quality of ingredients makes too much of a difference.

I like cottage cheese, but the flavor marries with the pasta sauce in a way that isn't nearly as satisfying as with Ricotta. And I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef, which was a large improvement. Putting uncooked noodles in worked just fine. They hydrated from the sauce, and probably work better that way than putting them in cooked.

I ended up cooking this well over an hour to get it cooked all the way through.

This was my first attempt at lasagna and I am so glad I found this recipe. I pretty much followed it exactly except I used slightly less cottage cheese and slightly more mozzarella in the cheese mixture. I also used a bit more sauce. Finally. I only used 1/4 cup of water at the end. Oh! I also used ground turkey instead of beef. It ended up beautifully cooked and my kids said it was the best thing they ever had. It was an easy to follow recipe that produced a delicious family meal. I will definitely make it again.

Very yummy. I cooked the meat with some minced garlic, onion powder, and dried oregano leaves for some more flavor.  Not quite as yummy as lasagna with ricotta cheese, but this is definitely just barely below it. (personal preference probably).  I will be using this recipe again because of its simplicity.  Easy to put together, comes out great looking and tasting!

I did not make any changes other than using 1.33 LB of hamburg because this is how my supermarket packages it, and I will make it again.  the speed to make it was great and following the directions was very easy.  the leftovers were also excellent.

I did some upgrades to the recipe but it was so good! I doubled the amount of cheese and got rid of the cottage cheese. I also added mushrooms and lots of dill instead of parsley. My boyfriend (who is very hard to please when it comes to food) gives it a 10/10! Definitely recommend

I added some spicy tomato sauce in with the meat as well as added ricotta cheese to the cheese mixture. Both additions worked wonderfully although I’m sure it is as delicious to follow the recipe.

The only change I made was I substituted jarred spaghetti sauce for my own homemade. I’ve never made lasagna without boiling noodles before.  This was so simple and absolutely fabulous!  My only suggestion...mpo, I like my top cheeses a little browner...mostly for aesthetic purposes. After 10 minutes at end, before setting, I would put under broiler for 2-3 minutes...or until it’s the eye pleasing color of your choice.  Best lasagna ever!

My family gobbles this up and I love the simplicity of this recipe, but it is very... saucy. I already add water to my spaghetti sauce in addition to the water around the edges, so I'm not sure what else to do. I'd like to include more veggies, but will have to read some more recipes before trying it.

This is one recipe i have been asked to make at least once a week by my kids. I use 1 1/2 cans of Hunts traditional pasta sauce for the spaghetti sauce and small curd Walmart cottage cheese. I didn't feel like the amounts suggested in the recipe for how much sauce and cheese to add were quite sufficient for each layer so I just made sure the surface was covered rather than measure exact amounts. I'm looking into what veggies i can add to make it a bit healthier and have more variety and substance. I also spray some tin foil with non-stick spray and put it on top for the cooking time and when that's done I put it back in for 5 minutes or so just to melt the top layer of cheese. This recipe has made lasagna not so intimidating to make now, thanks!

Great basic recipe for lasagna.  I gave it 4 stars because I followed the advice of some reviewers and adapted it a bit.  I used a 15 oz container of ricotta and dried oregano and kept all the other cheese mixture ingredients the same.  That yielded plenty of cheese mixture, so I recommend not using the entire amount of cottage cheese that the recipe says.  I used Prego spaghetti sauce.  I couldn't find a 32 oz jar so I used 1 1/3 of 24 oz jars with about 1/2 cup of water added.  I used about 1/4 cup water around the edges.  My lasagna came out perfect.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

Really not sure where the cheese quantities came from as that is WAY too much cheese for the 9x13 casserole dish. Otherwise, good recipe, but I learned the hard way with quantities and ended up using about 14 noodles and 2 casserole dishes (one small one normal) so as not to throw any of my cheese mixture away.

This recipe calls for a LOT of cottage cheese. But I does make the lasagna delicious (if you like cheese) Since I had a lot of cheese, I made extra layers. Just be careful of the brand of “no bake” noodles you buy. The ones I had make the lasagna taste doughy. I added more spices and mixed hot Italian sausage with my ground beef. The family loved it. Otherwise, it’s a pretty simple, straight to the point recipe that’s pretty good.

My go to lasagna recipe! Love it! Super easy. Big hit at my house. The main tweaks I do is switch the cottage cheese for ricotta cheese as suggested by other users. I also add more sauce vs water.

It came out perfect! I used whole wheat lasagna while omitting meat and eggs. I also substituted salt for more seasonings, but despite the few differences from the original recipe, it turned out incredible. Lastly, use half the amount of cottage cheese as the original recipe suggests.

My first try at lasagna , it turned out really good.  I, too traded ricotta for the cottage cheese and ended up adding a little less cheese.  I also added onions and garlic to the meat.  It's difficult sometimes because I have to triple all the ingredients (six kids), but it turned out really good.  Used beef from a local farm.  : )

The whole family liked it! I used Ragu for the spaghetti sauce. I would definitely use a thicker sauce next time, Ragu is just too thin. It was so easy to make and again, the whole family loved it.

This was very tasty, and I plan on making it again. only downside was that it came out dry. I am a beginner cook so I don't think I added enough sauce but I will be sure to add more next time.

REALLY good!  I made a couple of changes when I made it:
- I needed to cook mine 15 minute extra 
- needed 2 jars of sauce instead of 1
- made it with only 24 oz of cottage cheese, because that's all I had.  It was still great.

I followed this recipe pretty much as instructed but used ground turkey and mild Italian sausage.  It was really good!  I sprinkled shredded Italian cheese on top of the ricotta cheese mixture every time I layered.  I also did not add water and it turned perfect!

I added mushroom and onion during the ground beef cooking time. It turned out great. I think I’m not a big fan of cottage cheese so I will add less next time.

I've made this recipe several times now and it gets great reviews from all who eat it. It's super easy to make and has basic ingredients. Nothing fancy, but delicious. I like to use regular noodles, so I don't do the step at the end of adding water to the pan. I feel like the ratio of the cheese mixture to sauce might be a little bit off... I think next time I'll make a little bit more sauce and a little less cheese.

This Lasagna is wonderful. I didn't change a thing. I will defiantly make it again. There is no frozen lasagna with cottage cheese in it. So if you like it with cottage cheese, this is the one to make! Thanks for the great recipe.

Its been 32 years since I made Lasagna, and I couldn't remember the recipe. This was a good and simple recipe and my taste testers loved it.

This was the first time I ever used cottage cheese to make lasagna and I would have replaced with ricotta cheese as many reviewers suggested but the market that I went to didn't have any (they were out!) and I didn't feel like going to a 2nd market.  So, I decided to use the full amount of the cottage cheese and the lasagna ended up soupy.   So, I'm guessing I should have used half the amount of cottage cheese or just used ricotta.  I used sweet Italian sausage instead of ground beef.  So, the taste was quite good but the texture was off which is why the four stars.

So thankful to have finally found a recipe for lasagna that uses uncooked pasta! We’ve tried the no cook pasta previously and do not care for the texture of it. This recipe allowed me to use my standard lasagna noodles, without cooking them first, and they had an incredible texture in the end result! Not overcooked like they can sometimes turn out if noodles are cooked ahead of time. I will admit that I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese only because I had pre-shopped for the ingredients before finding this recipe. I will try to cheese next time. I also added some fresh garlic…because we love garlic! Ultimately, this recipe is a keeper and a major timesaver… Thank you!!! I will no longer deprive my family of lasagna on a more regular basis.

Based on other's suggestions, I used ricotta and only about 25 ounces. Still ended up way too much and overpowered the dish. Also added Italian seasoning to each step (total of 1 1/2 Tbs), but it still seemed a little bland. Used Prego.

Yum! I opted for 1/2 pork sausage and half ground beef, used half ricotta and half cottage cheese, and used no bake noodles (omitted the water). I used about 3/4 to 1 c of meat sauce with each layer and it turned out great!

This was the easiest lasagna recipe ever and it was delicious! I did add a 1 lb. of ground pork and 1 lb. ground beef along with onions. I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese also. Other than that I loved the way it came out! Thank you!

This was amazing and easy! I doubled the recipe, because I have a large family...When I realized I did not have enough lasagna noodles for the top layer, I improvised and put a cup of dry elbow macaroni noodles in the last of the sauce. I then topped it all off with more of the cheese. It turned out delicious! Thank you for a quick Italian meal fix! :)

Delicious, easy recipe.  I added a pound of Italian sausage to the ground beef and used two jars of sauce.  Otherwise left everything else the same.  This gave plenty of sauce.  Will definitely make again.

I've made this recipe a few times and it's delicious every time. It's a very good base that you can tweak to your liking. I use 1lb Italian sausage and 2 jars of sweet Italian sausage flavored spaghetti sauce.  I cut the amount of cottage cheese down, used only 1 1/2 cups of mozzarella, and the same amount of eggs. Comes out amazing every time.

I've made this a number of times now and it is always fantastic!!!  If I even suggest making this for my kids when they visit, its instant "Yeah, lasagna!"  The ingredients cost a bit, but the meal you get from it is always well, WELL worth it. :)

Really GREAT!! I skipped the mozzarella cheese and used only  parmesan mixed in with the cottage cheese , one egg, and the parsley. Modified for an 8"x8" pan so we could have one great meal without too many leftovers. 

Wonderful idea to first brown and drain the beef and then mix in with the spaghetti sauce to cook for another 5 minutes. Wonderful!!! 

I also added the 1/2 cup water which I have never done before - that made everything so tender and moist. This recipe is five stars all the way - never had a lasagna so good. 

Be sure to cook covered for the first 45 minutes and then without a top for the remaining 10. Then I waited an additional 10 minutes before serving  - everything cut very nicely - so was beautiful to serve.

Fantastic! I cut the recipe in half and made it in 8x9 dish, I also added Italian seasoning to the cheese mixture. I still used a lb of hamburger and also added 1/2 lb of Italian sausage to it along with chopped onions. I forgot to add the eggs to the mixture, but it turned out fine. I also used  store bought sauce "tomato/basil 25oz jar, and I didn't add any water, I topped it with Parmesan & mozzarella cheese covered it tightly and cooked for the recommend time.

Soupy mess with uncooked noodles. As I was making it, I realized that the recipe made no sense. When I took it out of the oven, the soupy mess confirmed that the recipe made absolutely no sense.

I used EZALDERE's suggestions and used a 15 oz container of ricotta with the same amount of everything else, as well as using 1/4 c. water and 1/4 c. red cooking wine, and 1/2 lb ground beef with 1/2 lb ground italian sausage. It was very good, 7 year old and husband loved it so that's a win in my book! Husband said hot sauce ruined the flavor and that doesn't usually happen so you know it turned out good if he says that!

Delicious, simple, classic!  This one was a definite crowd pleaser.  I agree that lasagna can be a bit soupy - be sure to let it cool & set up for about 10 minutes before cutting/serving and you shouldn't have a problem.

Was easy.  Changed it a bit and used ricotta and cottage cheese.  Also used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 sweet Italian sausage.   No ledtovers.  Was a bit bland but that is how I like my meals.   So was great.  Just seemed to be missing a little something.  Was good.

I followed this recipe almost exactly except that I cut the amount of cottage cheese to half (16 oz only). I also used Bertolli's sauce and used 4 lasagna noodles per row (instead of only 3). It was a hit with the family and I'll definitely make this again!

Delicious! Made it pretty much as the recipe, except I cooked the pasta just until a few bit soft, but not done, because I've had poor experiences with not cooking the pasta at all. Because I did that, I didn't put in the water. The dish was perfect. Next time I'll do it the same way as it wasn't too juicy or dry. Perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

So I'e made this several times, and I love it, but I've always thought there there is just too much filling. I tested this last night with subbing 
24 oz cream cheese
24 oz sauce
2 cups total mozzarella. 
1 egg instead of 2


And I was right. Tastes just fine, looks just fine, and noodles cooked great. I also have NEVER used no boil noodles, and never needed to add the water before baking, and it always comes out great. Usually once it's done cooking, my lasagna is almost dripping out of the plate and we usually have too much left over because it's too stuffed. Think I will definitely switch to the lower quantities from now on. This recipe is great and so easy, and often uses things we already have at home! Definitely great for a beginner, or someone who just wants to take it a little easy.

This easy lasagna was so delicious!! I was worried the noodles might be hard without cooking first but they came out cooked  just right. However, i did use 2 JARS of spaghetti sauce, ricotta instead of cottage cheese, used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 italian sausage, then added sauteed garlic, onions, mushrooms and riced broccoli to the sauce. I would strongly suggest the 2 jars of sauce. I decided to add more from reading the past reviews and they were absolutely right on being short on the sauce. I would have added 1/2 red wine and 1/2 water but didn't have the wine so just used water around the edges. I am not the most confident cook, so was a bit surprised at how great this lasagna turned out on my first try. Def a keeper recipe!

Best lasagna I've ever made! Made it for a church dinner and everyone loved it! The only change I made was adding a little more sauce than it called for and less cottage cheese mixture(only because I couldn't find the bigger containers) and it turned out perfectly

Loved it! Turned out great for a nice college kid Valentines Day dinner! Substituted the parsley with basil because we are poor???? we also cooked the beef with onion and garlic to give it more flavor. It tastes just like a Stouffers lasagna with even more flavor!! Thank you so much to the person that submitted this recipe!!

Easy and delicious. I did add a little onion in when I browned the hamburger and used a little ricotta for some of the cottage cheese.  I also used the no cook lasagna noodles--about 13 of them (they were smaller than regular ones).

Super easy base- Best part about it is how easy it is to modify based on what you have in the pantry.

I used 1/2 Italian Sausage, 1/2 ground beef and added sautéed onion and garlic to the meat sauce.

Very good and easy.  I made a few changes -  used 1 pound spicy Italian sausage  and 1/2 pound  ground beef.  I added 2 tsp Italian seasoning,  6 minced garlic cloves and a light sprinkling of red pepper flake to my sauce and simmered it for 5 minutes. Omitted the water and added 1/2 cup  extra sauce.  Cooked 90 min covered,  15 uncovered. A little soupy  but after sitting a few minutes, it was perfect !

Because the noodles do not had to be cooked, this is a very easy lasagna to put together. I often make it the night before and then bake the next day. I always get rave reviews whenever I make it.

It was my first time making lasagne and it turned out great. Used riccotta as suggested by other reviewers. Reduced ricotta to 550 grams and used 3 cups mozarella. This proved to be plenty. Forgot to buy parmesan so went without and it was still great. Although a little dry, so i'll be sure to add parmesan next time.  Used 750 grams bolognese sauce and 500 grams of beef mince. Think I could have done with more meat sauce so will definitely use 2 full jars of bolognese sauce and add a bit more meat next time. Can't wait to make it again!!

For the first time making lasagna from scratch, I have to admit-this came out Absolutely Awesome!
 Made a few additions in ingredients (not many) but it was definitely worth it!
I used a very lean ground beef, chopped andouille sausage and bacon mixture plus added some  sautéed white and green onion, and lots of GARLIC!  I used the Oven Ready lasagna noodles and a 45 oz jar of Ragu (we like our lasagna w/lots of gravy), and a 15 oz container of RICOTTA cheese. Used the same amount of mozzarella and eggs, but had a small chunk of Velvetta left in the fridge, so I sliced that and layered it across my first layer of Ricotta, and added a mozzarella topping  mixed with crushed red pepper flakes, parmesan cheese, and parsley . Baked covered in oven at 325 for one (1) hour, then took off foil and continued to bake for an additional 20-25 minutes! Served it with garlic pull-a-part rolls and a tomato-avocado salad!

I have some TRIPLE-PEPPER JACK CHEESE in the fridge and when it's time to warm the leftovers, I think I'll lay a slice of this pepper jack over the top of the lasagna, and warm it just until the cheese melts. Mmmmmm!

Super easy for lasagna. Certainly not a complex flavor, but it was just what I wanted for a weeknight dinner. I used fresh parsley and added some of my own seasoning to the sauce as well as some chopped veggies that I had on hand. I ended up using a 24oz jar of sauce plus a half of another.  And I cooked the noodles, omitting the extra water. The (maybe?) longer prep time was made up for with a shorter bake time. I did not use foil as I wanted a nice, crispy top. Did not dry out at all.

Delicious! I doubled the meat, 1lb lean ground beef and 1lb sweet Italian ground sausage. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. I had some left over cheese mix but just enough sauce / meat mix.

I made this for the first time a few years back. This is a great basic recipe to follow, but to be honest I did feel like it needed tweaking. I subbed ricotta in for the cottage cheese and it is WAY too much cheese! I honestly think my boyfriend ate it to be nice because I was newer to cooking and we just moved in together. Being apprehensive to make it again, I waited about 4 years before trying it again. This time I tweaked it a bit more and it turned out perfect! I purchased a 15oz package of ricotta instead of 32oz. I used the same amount of other cheeses and eggs though in the mixture and added garlic powder to taste. I also cooked the noodles for about a minute under the package instructions for al dente as the noodles don't cook fully if you use uncooked ones. Even cutting the ricotta if half, I still only used about half of that mixture during assembly. Since I only made it for a few people, I tossed the extra cheese mixture, but I think I will save it in the freezer next time to save money. Serve with garlic bread and it's perfect! I would recommend using some sauce without meat on the base layer and the meat sauce in the rest of it. My boyfriend now requests it and my granny said it was heavenly. Try it and tweak to your preferences but definitely a good starter recipe if you love lasagna but have never made it.

I used a package of sausage instead of ground beef and added a clove of minced garlic while cooking. I used a 300g tub of ricotta, only one egg, added a dash of nutmeg, salt and pepper to the cheese mixture. I used a can of tomato sauce and a small can of pizza sauce to equal 32oz. To the sauce I added some basil, oregano and thyme. I also used just over 2 cups of cheese on top and omitted the Parmesan cheese altogether. 

My boyfriend loved it, I on the other hand didn't care for it. On to the next recipe!

If I want lasagna in the future I will make my "long" recipe which is tried and true and I love.  This was just okay.  I had never used uncooked noodles before and they were just so-so.  I found them to be a little gummy in places.  Flavor was okay, but not as good as my homemade sauce.  Not making this again regardless of how easy it is.  Some things just take some time and effort to get what you want.

I usually use my homemade spaghetti sauce (1 quart jar), but if I can't I add spices to the store bought stuff. Italian sausage is much better than hamburger. I brown it with olive oil, onions and a clove of garlic.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband made this and he didn't complain about it being hard. He said the pasta sauce came in a 26oz jar instead of 32. He also only needed 7 noodles, not 9. It wasn't enough for 3 layers, just 2. It tasted great though. Our 6 year old spaghetti lover couldn't get enough. We also use ground turkey.

Wonderful flavor!  My entire family LOVES it.  I did follow some of the recommendations from the other reviewers with respect to the cheese ratio.  The only problem I've had is that it can finish bit wet.  I'd recommend reducing the amount of water added.  I use a homemade pasta sauce that's a bit thinner than most canned sauces so I don't even add water.  Bottom line...it's EASY and delicious.  It may take a few tries to "get it right" (or not) but it will be worth the effort.

Made this for lunch today for 7 of my 10 grandchildren and a Momma. There was none left. It was delicious! I did make some changes though. I used Barilla no pre-cook noodles, Almost 2# hamburger with a lilttle sausage, onions and garlic. I used 2 jars of spaghetti sauce & some extra spices in the meat. Used all the rest of the ingredients as the recipe stated. Baked it for 25 minutes covered & 15 uncovered and broiled it part of that time. It was awesome and will be making again, soon!

I added some extra sauce and less cottage cheese, as a couple different reviewers suggested. The extra sauce was good, but I think the cheese would have been better if I'd used the amount that the original recipe suggested. Otherwise though, it was quite good and surprisingly easy to make!

I cut the  meat layers in half and added a layer of spinach in the middle.  Made both my husband and me happy.  Used McCormick Italian seasonings in the meat as the only seasoning     at all, cut the recipe in half and had plenty for the two of us and still had leftovers.  Great flavor.  Great idea

It was a very easy recipe and my roommate and sister enjoyed it! The things I did different was that I used one 16 oz can of cottage cheese, one bag of shredded mozzarella and shredded Parmesan for the cheese sauce, then I sprinkled more mozzarella and Monterrey jack cheese for the top layer. I also did not cover it in the oven I just let it bake for 45 mins and then it was done!

This is the first lasagna I've ever made so I can't compare it to others,  but I thought it was delicious!  I did make a few changes though, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. I'm vegetarian so instead of beef I used two bags of Morningstar Farms Grillers Crumbles (found in Walmart's "healthy" frozen section), heated in the microwave for 4 minutes first.  They are pre-flavored so no need to add anything extra. I also used a chopped onion and some fresh spinach. I only used 2 cups of mozzerela, plus a little sprinkled on top. I used about 1 1/2 jar of sauce and layered my meat instead of mixing it with the sauce. I forgot to use the water but I'm glad I didn't because it ended up a little watery after baking. After sitting for a while though it firmed up and I just had my first piece.  Yum! Will be making this again!

It was very good and was easy to make.  Didn't change much. I used 24oz of cottage cheese, 2-24oz cans of Hunts traditional sauce, and 1/4 C of water and no boil lasagna noodles.  I also added garlic and a little chopped onion to the ground beef. Turned out great. Wasn't watery and the noodles were just right.

Use a small ricotta and small cottage cheese to blend those cheeses. As for the marinara sauce, buy Pregos Spicy Sausage so it has that sausage flavor (and no need to buy ground sausage).

I've made this twice now and both times I only had the 24 ounce container of cottage cheese and it's plenty.  I probably used a little more sauce than was called for because I didn't want it to be dry.  I also used a mixture of mild cheddar and mozzarella cheese because I didn't have enough mozzarella.  Anyone can pull off this recipe and it's so pretty and delicious to eat!

I followed the recipe exactly. I didn't have parsley so that was the only thing I couldn't add. I seasoned the meat with oregano. This was a very fast and easy recipe. It was was very tasty. My lasagna did come out a little too watery so I will not be adding the 1/2 cup of water next time I make it. Other than that, it was a very good recipe.

It's not often I'll make the same recipe twice.  But, tonight is my second time I've made this lasagna. It's so super easy, there's no way to mess it up and I'm so thankful for that!  Yes, you can dress it up a little more, but it really is delicious just the way it is. thank you thank you for this recipe :)

This recipe definitely calls for seasoning as you see fit! If you follow exactly, it might turn out bland, but if you know what you like, season this puppy up and you won't be disappointed!

YUM!!!!! This was a hit!! The only change I made was that I added a can of black olives and cooked the noodles beforehand. The noodles came out tender and moist!

First time ever making lasagna and I am extremely satisfied. Some modifications: I added salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, salt seasoning and parsley salt to the meat while cooking. I also added onions, garlic, mushrooms to the meat for a quick 2 minutes. I used ricotta cheese instead of goat cheese. Added half of the water that was suggested and on top I put slices of provolone cheese. AMAZING! Next time I will try adding zucchini.

Very good! I used ricotta, 32 oz for a double batch mixed with the other ingredients. Will make it again. I also used extra sauce & some more water to make sure the noodles were cooked not hard all the way to the edge. Also needed some extra cooking time covered to completely cook those noodles. Family loved it!

This is such an easy dish, and everyone loves it! I make both the meat version as well as meatless. Both versions come out delicious. I've received many, many compliments on this lasagna. It's definitely my go to lasagna recipe.

It was my first time making lasagna and I was a little skeptical when I saw that I didn't need to cook the pasta first. I followed the suggestions of adding more sauce and less water, but I found it a little watery and too saucy so next time I'll readjust. I'd also another layer of pasta because I felt like 3 layers wasn't enough. Nevertheless, it is a good recipe and it was pretty simple to make!

I've made this a few times and I keep tweaking it and make it better and better. I cook the lasagna noodles first and don't add water. My noodles ended up soggy with the original recipe. I double the spaghetti sauce and substitute half the cottage cheese with Ricotta cheese. I have also added a 10 oz package of chopped spinach to the spaghetti sauce with excellent recipes.

Great recipe!!! I added Italian seasoning and garlic powder to the meat instead of salt and pepper.  I used Prego meat sauce because my husband prefers it to Ragu.  I bought a 24 ounce jar by accident and it worked just fine. Next time I will add garlic cloves and a little onion.

This was a big hit!  I was nervous because I've always been afraid of making lasagna... either too messy or too complicated.  This was a simple recipe, easy to fix, and delicious!  The only thing I may change next time is maybe not quite as much water, as mine seemed to be a little soupy on the sides right after coming out of the oven.  Once I spooned that out and let it sit the 10 minutes, it was perfect!!

I followed to advice of other reviewers and used about double the sauce and ricotta cheese instead of cottage. I also only used 16oz of ricotta instead of the recipes suggestion.  It was very soupy on day one, but the next day it was perfect. Next time I want to add sausage to it for more meat  & I'll cook one day and eat the next.

My family and I loved it.  I only had ricotta (a good one), so I used that.  I added fennel seeds (1/2 tsp) to the cheese mixture.   I also did cook the noodles al dente beforehand and glad I did - I think it would have been really dry if not (perhaps because I had used ricotta which has less moisture than cottage cheese).

This a fantastically easy lasagna.  I have only made lasagna once before in my life and vowed "Never again!" but this recipe changed my mind.  The only criticism I have is that the consistency was more like lasagna stew---it was very loose, and even tho I rested it for 25 minutes it remained quite liquid.  Great taste tho---I adapted it to be vegetarian by using meat crumbles and it turned out terrific---yay!!  I can make lasagna!!!

Very good- especially for how easy it was.  My 10-year old daughter made it almost on her own.  I probably won't make the traditional version again.  I used about 7 oz. of ricotta with 20 oz. of cottage cheese.  I also added diced onions and mushrooms with the ground beef.  The kids (who hate mushrooms and onions) loved it!!!  Excellent!!!

Made this last nite... Family loved it... Agree with previous review, cheese mixture made a bit too much...will do less next time....had leftovers so anxious to get each piece wrapped with Saran Wrap, put in a freezer bag and be ready to pop in the microwave when I'm ready for a quick bite again!

Cut the recipe in half.  Was skeptical about using regular noodles but they came out perfect.  Added garlic to the ground beef.  Will add a little more seasoning next time.  Kids loved it too!

I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and maybe that's Why i didn't like it that much. I prefer to use one different simple recipe with tomatoes sauce (just pelati/ tomatoes in can) with garlic and scamorza and parmesan and little butter for the cheese layer

This recipe is so easy and quite tasty.  I subbed Italian sausage for the beef... Yum!  It was cheesy, easy to cut... But the top didn't get that cheesy crunch like most lasagnas get.  Trial and error I guess.  Great dish though... Makes a lot!

Turned out great! I did make a few changes: I added a little bit of salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder to the ground beef as it cooked, I used 1.7lbs of ground beef (85% lean), I used 24oz of cottage cheese and 8oz of Ricotta, 4 cups of mozzarella divided evenly, only added 1/4 cup water, and the jarred sauce I used was Michaels of Brooklyn marinara sauce (very tasty for jarred marinara and is my go to from now on when I don't have the time to make my own). I think this will be my go to lasagna recipe. I prefer ground beef to italian sausage (just not a fan of italian sausage in general). I think as long as you season well and get a good jarred sauce, or make your own, this lasagna will taste good!

This tastes great but really it was WAY too much cheese for the recipe.    The only change I made was I added onion while cooking the hamburg and a little oregano.

Family loved it, including my picky 2 yo.  I added sauce, mushrooms, onion and a splash of red wine to the sauce while it was simmering, and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  Will make again!

Since we like slightly drier lasagna that cuts neatly for serving, I have never pre-boiled the noodles; and I never pay extra for the so-called "pre-boiled" noodles. 
I favour reducing the cheese content and adding sautéed diced veggies (mushrooms, peppers, onions, celery) to the sauce to make this a bit healthier. 
Thanks for sharing!

Found this recipe bland and had an odd after taste.  Maybe it was the Barilla Oven-Ready Lasagna noodles.  Not certain, but won't make it this way again.

Lasagna is one of my favorite foods. But I always thought it was too sophisticated for my cooking skills. Well this turned out amazing! I made this with garlic bread (a recipe from this site) and a side salad. It was perfect. I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. Also I used 2 jars of tomato sauce instead of one. This lasagna was soo cheesy and heavenly. Also I cooked my noodles stovetop first. Baked everything covered for about 30 minutes and uncovered for about 10 mins.

There are only 2 1/2 of us, so I halved all ingredients except the sauce, meat, noodles, and water. I used a 7x9 pan. Perfect proportions. So if you're making the full recipe, I would recommend more sauce.  Otherwise, it will be dry. And I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  
Wow. So easy and so good. This is a basic lasagna without all the fuss. Anyone can make it. Fantastic!  Family has requested that I make it weekly!  Thank you for the recipe.

Very good lasagna especially since its quick and easy. I add mushrooms and use more sauce. Also use Italian sausage instead of burger, but essentially the same. Good recipe.

I have made this many times, family loves it!   I tend to always make it larger and add in a pound of ground pork and double up the sauce and cheese mixture.    Always a hit?

Big hit. I didn't have exact amount of all ingredients and instead of ricotta cheese I added sour cream. I also added mushrooms, oregano and garlic salt.

Thank you for this recipe!! It was my first time making lasagna. I used this recipe as a starting guide and it was perfect! The changes I made were adding 48 ounces of sauce instead of adding water, used about 15 oz of ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, added an Italian blend seasoning and used 1 pound of mild Italian sausage instead of ground beef. I also used the "no boil" noodles.

I made this last night for my family! I have never made lasagna before so I wanted a simple recipe that I could use to try this out. I changed up a few things since the measurements are a little weird ( I don't understand oz as a measurement because I am not from the usa.) anyways, I used a 500g tub off cottage cheese, 2 jars of spaghetti sauce, one tomato and basil one parmesan and Romano flavoured, I figured those would both give flavour to the lasagna as I didn't plan to use paramesen shredded cheese. The box of noodles I used was oven ready so they didn't have to be boiled (I have a feeling those with non cooked noddles didn't use the correct ones) my pan fit 3 noodles lengthwise and I broke 1 to fill the end, I repeated the layers one extra time as I had left over noodles, I  almost ran out of cheese after about the 2nd layer  so I would probably use another tub of cottage cheese next time. As we are cheese lovers here I think double the amount of the cheese would be better. I still had the reserved cheese for the top (I used a marble cheese instead of mozzarella) all in all it was a pretty decent lasagna, with a few tweaks I think it will be a family favouritve. I did increase the cooking time to 1 hr 25 to accommodate the extra layer, (1 hour 15, 10 uncovered) although I think I could have probably went a little less, I wanted to be sure it was cooked. The only other change I would make is to double the meat and maybe use 1 more jar of sauce! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe needed some help. First off, I had to cook it about 20 minutes longer so that the noodles would cook all the way through and the proportions of sauce were off. It needed more. Other than that, it's great!

Easy and delicious!  I was a little concerned that using all the cheese mixture would have been too much so I didn't use it all.  Next time I wouldn't hesitate to use it all :) I also pre boiled my noodles but not as long as the package recommended and used 1/4 cup water instead of 1/2 cup.

I've made this recipe so many times I can remember it by heart. I LOVE  this! My family gets excited every time I tell them I'm going to make it. The only thing I changed is the cottage cheese. I hate it. So I switched with ricotta and it came out FANTASTIC! 5/5 stars!

LOVED it! Used 12 lasagna noodles, and about 10 oz. of shredded Mozzarella cheese. It was still very rich. Sometimes I get tired of Lasagna leftovers, but not this one!!

Very easy, very cheesy, and super good. Next time I will probably add some veggies, but it is amazing as is. Definitely make again.

Great basic recipe..... So much potential to add your own herbs and seasonings to your liking.  The texture was perfect;  not overly dry or wet.  I added basil, minced onion (to the cooking hamburger), and italian seasoning.  Every person in my family (husband and kids) ate it all.

This is my go-to lasagna recipe! It's easy to put together and very easy to tweak to your tastes. I like to swap the cottage cheese for ricotta, use fresh parsley if I have on hand, and use a very flavourful pasta sauce (my favorite is Eden Organic brand). I've also swapped gluten free noodles for standard ones when making for celiac family members, and even myself sometimes but make sure there is enough liquid and also note that if you cook it too long the noodles will go soggy so make sure to take it out when they feel cooked! I make this one in bulk and freeze (before cooking) for later or to give to family/friends.

Really easy lasagna, and delicious too.  I love how you can just use the store bought sauce, and it's ready in no time.  I added fresh chopped garlic to the pan before putting in the meat (and used ground chicken to make it slightly heathier), as well as onion, kale and mushroom. I also put in chili flakes to give it some kick.  I used ricotta cheese for the cheese mixture - yum!  I also put it on broil for 10-15 minutes and removed the aluminum foil so that the cheese could get crispy!

The is so easy and delicious.  Most of the ingredients I used came from Trader Joes.  I love the California Style Friendship cottage cheese, but the Trader Joes one does the trick - just use the full fat one (I think it's 4%.)  I also chopped an onion and sauteed it, mixed in the beef to brown, and then added the sauce (Trader Joes marinara.)  Sometimes I add a handful of chopped spinach to the cheese mixture.  If you use frozen chopped spinach, make sure you defrost it and drain (squeeze it out) really well so that it's as dry as possible.

I leave out the 1/2 cup water in the recipe because I don't drain the beef and with a not so thick sauce, once I put the ingredients together in the Pyrex dish, I could see the liquid off on the side.  It came out perfect, so I think the water would have made it too wet. 

I just made it last week (without spinach), and my friend's kid (age 4) said it was the best lasagna she's ever had.  My children and husband love it as well.  Really such a great meal for the whole family and leftovers.

Followed the recipe to a tee. I loved it. My husband loved it. My daughter said it was fantastic. It was great! I recommend baking it on a baking sheet in the oven as it overflowed.

I made it with Ricotta because I don't like Cottage Cheese, but this was a good recipe. Not having to boil the noodles made it faster.

I've always been skeptical about not boiling the noodles first, but I hate that part of making lasagna!!  I also swapped ricotta for cottage cheese.  I had a package of shredded Italian cheese that included asiago and used that in addition to parmesan and mozzarella. Didn't realize I was out of eggs, but I used some mayo instead. I had whole wheat noodles and used 9.  The noodles were cooked al dente, so I would probably bake it longer next time.  Other than that, it was perfect!!  I will never cook lasagna noodles again!!!

This was a great recipe.  I made it last night for my girlfriend and i and it came out wonderful, although i did tweek it a little.  Following other suggestions i used about a half a jar more of sauce instead of the water, and i used mild italian sausage instead of hamburger.  I also only used half of the cottage cheese and substituted ricota for the other half.  i actually forgot to get parmesan cheese so i left it out altogether, but the result was still fantastic.  the noodles left a little to be desired, they were a little chewy, but i chalk that up to the other things i did to it and i'm sure i can figure it out.
wonderful, easy setup, great food. lots of leftovers!

Really enjoyed this recipe, my fussy 8 yr old boy had 2 servings! I also used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  I did find it quite a cheesy lasagne so next time I'll cut back on the cheese quantities. Thanks for a very quick and tasty recipe.

Followed directions to the letter but turned out too soupy. All the water poured around the edges wound up on top and we had lasagna soup. LOL! 

I had a recipe years ago that called for assembling lasagna the night before so the noodles could soak in the sauce. I thought this may be a shortcut. But live and learn I guess. 

Won't be using this one again.

Good recipe although I did add my own little twist - my husband said this was the best lasagna I've ever made.  I used mild pizza sausage in place of the hamburger (approx. 3/4 lb), and used only about 22 oz of cottage cheese, only 1 egg, and approx. 2 cups of mozzarella.  I sauteed some onion and green pepper, both chopped, with the meat as it browned, then added the sauce and some dried basil, oregano and garlic powder. SO GOOD!

We thought some changes would make it more to our liking. To cut back on calories -I cook my noodles and drain to remove some of the starch, and only use 2 cups of shredded mozzarella - mix one cup of mozzarella in with the cottage cheese, and sprinkle one cup on top. I also use one egg which is enough in the cheese mixture. We like to add some salt, pepper, garlic,onion, and Italian seasoning to the meat mixture to jazz up the jar sauce. Also good to use 1/2 beef or turkey and 1/2 Italian sausage or add some diced pepperoni for fun!

I tried this recipe and it was great and pretty easy. I did make a few adjustment. Here are some changes I made and enjoyed: 1/2 pound of hot Italian sausage and 1/2 pound of ground beef, 1 container of cottage cheese and one container of ricotta cheese. I added garlic powder and oregano to the ground beef while I was browning it and added it to the cheese mixture. 

I used more sauce instead of water. It came out a little runny (due to the amount of sauce but I think the leftovers will be perfect once it sits in the refrigerator.

I doubled this recipe so we can have one tray for dinner and another to freeze.  I thought it held up very well, everyone was happy with the flavour and consistency.  I threw in some mushrooms because I had them in the fridge and I like them.  :)  I would make this recipe again.

I had never made lasagna before. I thought it would be complicated and too expensive. This recipe was perfect for me. My family loved it!  I followed the recipe except I used no cook noodles and skipped the water. This truly was easy and delicious.

Great tasting and very easy.  I tripled the meat and it seemed to work better.

My daughter referred me to this recipe.  I have been making traditional lasagna for years and couldn't believe this easy method could work.  I tried it and was made a believer.  My family Loved it and so do I.  I also made it with ricotta cheese although my daughter has made it with cottage cheese and said it's great.  Incredibly easy and quick!

Delicious lasagna! I did reduce the ricotta to one 16oz container. I used about 1 1/2 jars of sauce (24oz jars). Super simple assembly and cook time was perfect. The noodles turned out great - even without pre-cooking. A definite keeper!

Agree with way too much cheese!  I also added more spaghetti sauce but still lacked flavor!  Needs more spice!

Absolutely the best lasagna I have ever made.  So simple.  It is tempting to add onions, garlic or additional spices but don't, it's great just the way it is.  I've made it many times and get raves every single time!!!  Recently I have started doubling the grated cheese and it is even better!

Loved this recipe.  I use more layers of the noodles because we prefer it firmer, not so runny and about three-quarters of the cottage cheese (we use the 1%).  The girlfriend and her parents love this.

This was a very simple recipe to follow.  I made adjustments to make my favorite spaghetti sauce first, and did 16 oz of cottage cheese and 16 oz of ricotta.  The lasgna came out perfect, but did not brown during the additional 10 min.  I put the brolier on low for about 8 mins and watched carefully as not to burn my masterpiece :) Thanks for simplicity!!

Loved it but made two changes. I used ricotta because it was actually cheaper at my store, and added italian seasoning, oregano, garlic powder, and onion powder in with the parsley, salt, and pepper. This was simple and delicious. Also make sure you add in the 1/2 cup water to the sides. I thought it was weird but it worked out wonderfully. Very good recipe!

Really easy to make!  Instead of cottage cheese I used 15oz of ricotta.  I also added minced garlic to the meat after it was cooked.  I did not use the parsley. I had never put water in my lasagna before but it was a difference maker!  The noodles didn't get crispy and burn on the top.  It turned out fabulous!

This was so easy!! I used pork sausage instead of ground beef and half the amount of cottage cheese (only because that's what I had in the fridge). I also used 3 different types of leftover spaghetti sauce and 1/2 c. crushed tomatoes. I felt like there wasn't enough sauce so I kept adding until it "looked" right. :) It was a little saucy, but I prefer that over dry. If you like a lot of cheese mixture I would use the full amount of cottage cheese, but mine turned out fine with just half. Will definitely be making again and teaching my kids to make too!

This was definitely easy. I didn't think the flavor was that special, but I would make it again just because it does hit the spot for a lasagna craving and was much easier than making a "proper" lasagna.

This is the first time I have successfully made a lasagna. My last one was dry (followed the recipe on the pasta box), this one was outstanding! I used Bertolli Arrabbiata spaghetti sauce and 3/4 of a pound of Italian Sausage with 1/4 lb lean ground beef. I added some minced garlic to the meat as it browned. Other than that I followed the recipe with the exception of putting more  sauce in the layers than the 1/4 cup called for (about 3/4 cup per layer). Also, I baked uncovered for about 20 minutes instead of 10. Very flavorful and the pasta was excellent, cooked just right. A big hit at our house!

Delicious!  I added 2 jars of spaghetti sauce and a little water to the sauce and around the edges after I put it all together, the noodles  turned out great.  I also added a little worcestershire sauce, about a cup of sugar, minced garlic and some cayenne pepper to the sauce as it was simmering.  The sugar takes that bitterness out of the tomato sauce I always use it for spaghetti.  I also turned the oven up to 400 for the last 10 minutes of cooking.

While easy, this lasagna needed more depth of flavor.  Maybe it was the jar of sauce I used, but it seemed too sweet.  I added two big cloves of garlic to my beef mixture, but still didn't get great flavor.  Still - for a quick weeknight dinner - it satisfied my hubby!

A very good lasagna! Prepared this for some picky friends and all plates were clean!! Since I had about 1.5 lbs of ground beef, I used two 24 ounce jars of spaghetti sauce (tomato basil). Didn't quite use all of the cheese mixture, and there was plenty of cheese! For fewer calories next time, will use less next time and layer in some baby spinach.

Great, EASY recipe!  My family loves this.  Mine came out a little soupy at first with the noodles not completely done, so I put it back in the oven for another 10 minutes.  Came out perfect after that.  This makes for wonderful left overs.

Awesome recipe.  I replaced the cottage cheese with ricotta and it worked perfectly.  I freeze my leftovers in single portions and it reheats incredibly well.  I do add some basil, oregano, as well as a few fresh mushrooms when I add the sauce to the meat and I've had great results.

Great, easy recipe.  I added onion and garlic powder to the beef while cooking and also sprinkled some Lowry's on the beef.  I used  an additional cup of sauce but only 22 ounces of cottage cheese.  I reduced the water to 1/4 cup.  Easy and my kids and husband loved it.

I added 1/2 red wine, 1/2 water and I think it made it richer. My husband said now he'll never have to buy frozen lasagna again and he's right this is a lasagna recipe I will definitely make again. OH-SO-EASY, and perfect for omitting and adding. Next time I'll try vegetarian!

My hubby's mom makes the most awesome lasagna. I tried this recipe and found all four of us ( me, him and the 2 kids ) making an awesome meal. They were begging for leftovers the next day. Super easy and tasty.. Yum!

Deelish. I added 2 cups ricotta rather than the 32 oz. and 1 1/2 cups water rather than more sauce. Also put in some thawed spinach.

This was pretty easy lasagna. I did have a hard time following the stratification of the layers, but it turned out very good. This will definitely become my staple lasagna for when I want a no fuss lasagna.
Thanks a lot for the recipe!

This recipe was very good for a simple lasgna. I wanted something quick and easy and this was it! I actually used a can of meat spaghetti sauce instead of cooking ground beef since it would just take more time which I didn't have. I'm sure the cooked meat would make it taste even better but it was still delicious with the canned sauce with added meat.

LOVE Lasagna! This is easy and now a regular menu item for us. I added garlic, pepper and italian spices to our taste. I use ground Turkey and the the Prego brand Meat sauce, larger jar and omit the water. IT IS AWESOME!

Very good and easy, but I found it a bit too meaty for my taste. I substituted fresh parsley, which gave it good flavor.

Yum!  Made a few changes...on purpose and accidentally.  Added chopped onion and garlic while browning the meat.  I accidentally bought CHIVE cottage cheese.  Still turned out great!  But definitely ended up with way too much of the cheese mixture so will reduce the amount the next time.  Enjoy!

This was simply the best lasagna recipe my family has ever had!! I used the no boil noodles. They worked great. The only change I would consider making is to not put the water along the edges. Or at the very least check the moisture in the pan before adding. Leftovers were super. The first time around the lasagna was a little soupy.

Every summer we have many "batches" of tomatoes with which I immediately make a thick and meaty sauce.  Then I freeze it in quart-sized Ziploc bags for future reference.  I thawed 2 bags of the meat sauce and made up a big lasagna pan basically following this recipe's protocol and I was amazed at how you could use plain old lasagna noodles without cooking them first. It was definitely an easier process ----- and with homemade spaghetti sauce, it was top-notch! With about 40-plus quarts in my freezer, I'll definitely do this again!

Good basic recipe.  Just make sure to bake it long enough.  Seems to be too much cottage cheese mixture for my taste and I add more sauce to mine just to make sure there is enough liquid.

I love lasagna, but i have never cooked it.  So i tried this recipe a few months ago and it turned out amazing.  The only changes i made were boiling the noodles (just because i wasn't in a rush so I'm not sure if not boiling them will turn out just as good).  Also i used a little more meat because i like a meatier lasagna and i just about doubled the cheese. 

I've cooked it several times now for several groups of people.  Everybody has loved it !

I give this 5 stars because it was easy to make and the flavor was great!  Next time, I might try adding some fresh vegetables just to take it up a notch.  Oh, I took the advice of another review and made it with ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  It worked just fine.

This was fantastic!!!  I did make the following changes, added Italian seasoning, garlic salt & powder, minced onion, & sugar to the meat sauce. I also used a 26 ounce can of spaghetti sauce & an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce.  My carton of cottage cheese was only 24 ounces, but that seemed like plenty.  I used 4 noodles per layer (breaking off the end of one to lay the opposite way). I also probably used more cheese on the top, as I didn't measure, I just eyeballed it.  Next time, I will cut back on the water a little bit, as there was a little bit of "watery" sauce in the bottom.  Everybody raved & wants me to send them the recipe.

I only used 16oz of cottage cheese and sauta some mushroom and onions in butter and garlic then threw that in the mixture. It come out wonderful. So easy and cheep to make thanks for posting this one its a keeper....

This was delicious! The whole pan was devoured in ten minutes (but I do live in a dorm so that's normal). However I did boil the noodles, because it freaks me out not boiling noodles.

i cannot cook. but this turned out wonderfully! i didn't use cottage/ricotta cheese, as i dont like them; i just used noodles and meatsauce. was worried about using uncooked noodles, but it turned out fine. i used 2 bottles of spaghetti sauce instead of one.

THIS WAS SUPER EASY TO MAKE AND REALLLLLLLLLYYYYYY GOOD!  I THINK IF IT IS TURNING OUT WATERY YOU MAY WANT TO USE LESS COTTAGE CHEESE AS ITS WATERY TO BEGIN WITH, I USED THE NO BOIL NOODLES AND I DIDNT ADD THE WATER TO THE EDGES AS CALLED FOR BUT IT TURNED OUT WONDERFUL AND I WILL USE THIS ONE OVER AND OVER!!!

This was a great recipe.  My sister said that it was way better than her favorite restaurant's lasagna!  :)

I only used about half of the cottage cheese and replaced the remaining half with ricotta cheese.  I also added some minced garlic to the sauce mixture.  I ended up having to use 12 lasagna noodles as well.

I recommend this one!

The noodles are a little more firm than what I'm used to, but they're definitely not undercooked.  I changed the recipe to use more Parmesan than Mozzarella.  Other changes included leaving out the parsley but putting in Italian seasoning.  Very tasty!

So easy to make, really good recipe. I always make extra sauce because my family likes the meat. I also add a can of roasted garlic tomato paste.
