These are amazing. We kept some warm as suggested, and it was great. We didn't make the sauce out of laziness, but they are so crispy and delicious.

I made them according to the recipe for dinner and they were amazing! They were ever so slightly too salty for my taste but i will adjust and make them again. They were so crispy and tasty.

I made this tonight,  with no changes to the recipe.  They are fantastic.  Wife and daughters all loved them.  My wife and I liked the sauce. One daughter liked it, one didn't.

Great recipe.  I will definitely be making this again...several times.

I had a dinner event and made this as an appetizer, super easy and I didn't have a single one left within 5 minutes! 

I made a second batch with almond flour as a gluten free option but they weren't as good as Chef John's recipe.

These little things are awesome. As someone relatively new to cooking, I've never deep-fried anything before, but these were super easy to cook. I might try this recipe with other cheeses some day just to see how it comes out.
Only thing I changed was that I doubled the ingredients. The amount of dough that came from the list here made enough for about 4 balls, not 8, but I may have just been making them too big. Either way, they taste amazing.
