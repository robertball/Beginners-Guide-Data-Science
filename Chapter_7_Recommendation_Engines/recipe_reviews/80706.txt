These were fantastic, but I modified the recipe a bit.  I used the frozen scallops from Costco.  I defrosted them, and then let them drain on paper towels.  Based on other reviews, I made sure that I used extremely thin prosciutto.  I combined olive oil and 2 large cloves of crushed garlic with some butter.  Once the garlic browned, I cooked the scallops for a total of 5 minutes. I did not use the wine.  They turned out fabulous!  A simple recipe with a great "wow" factor.

Very good. Note: Proscuitto is very strong and must be paper thin to avoid overpowering a delicate flavor like scallops. My Italian MIL's idea of paper-thin was "you should be able to read the paper through it!" I, too, added garlic to the olive oil.

My mom and dad loved this, liked the sweet vs. salty, but i didn't like it at all.  I didn't use any wine, but followed everthing else.  I found for me that the prosciutto overpowered the taste of the scallops.

I used bay scallops and took another reviewer's tip of adding a dab of cream cheese between the scallop and prosciutto. I couldn't find the white wine, but added parmesan cheese from a can during the last couple minutes. They turned out wonderfully and were gone in no time!

This same recipe was on TV just last week..I use the olive oil and butter mixture called "fortified"(by Emeril)..and if you want to use Bacon/try a rapid boil on the Bacon for 10-minutes--then fry(saute')in butter/then wrap and finish the scallops..Scallops-Prosciutto..fantasic.

We thought this needed a little garlic so when I make again I will infuse the olive oil with garlic.

This was great.  It had the flavor I have been looking for, but haven't found when using bacon.  I served it with steamed broccoli and bernaise sauce.  The sauce was good with the scallops as well as the broccoli.

I normally make this with bacon, but had some prosciutto and thought "what the heck".  It turned out really well.  The prosciutto didn't crisp up as much as our bacon does, but was still good.  Thanks for the post.

This was a very simple recipe, and it was good, but I can't give it 5 stars because it's so simple and there's no room for innovation.

I love prosciutto and thought it would be a better option than bacon. But it had less flavor than I would expect.
