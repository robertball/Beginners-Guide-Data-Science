This was a very good Passover lasagna with some minor modifications:)  I browned and seasoned a 1 lb. of turkey meat and added that to two jars of sauce.  I also seasoned the cheese mixture with basil, oregano, salt, and pepper.  It came out more beautiful than a traditional lasagna.  I will definitely be making this for future.  Thank you for providing a base recipe!

Love this recipe.  The result was a cheesy, vegetarian dish which everyone enjoyed.  I did not have 4 eggs in the house so I used 3/4 cup of egg replacement.  Also had only a 16 oz. carton of cottage cheese  into which I mixed the leftover ricotta cheese (about 1/2 cup or 4 oz), I had on hand.  I also used 7 Matzo sheets instead of 6 to make sure I covered all the layers.  I wish I had taken a picture because it looked so good when it came out of the oven.  Tasted even better after sitting for a bit.

Terrific! My girlfriend was confounded and asked me if it was actual lasagna and I was slipping her chametz.

Made this recipe for my chavurah (friends group).  I hadn't tried it before, and was wary of how much cottage cheese vs shredded mozzarella.  It was fantastic, and everyone loved it!!  I need to use 1 1/2 pieced of matzah each level to fit a large casserole dish; this worked perfectly.  Also need more marinara sauce, about 1/2 more jar.  I will use this recipe forever!!

This turned out great! I loved the cottage cheese and mozzarella combo and was thrilled (and a bit surprised) by how tender the matzo got. As a little bonus, I sauteed some spinach and garlic and added it on top of the cheese layers just to add a little vegetable. It was a hit, not only with my vegetarian seder guest, but with the whole crowd. I will definitely do it again.

Has a mild flavor, needs punching up with basil, oregano & garlic to taste. I thought was okay, hubby disliked it. Did look like the real thing after baking.

Excellent! Didn't taste like passover at all! I am a cheese freak and added 8oz of cheddar to the top as well as a can of mushrooms. The matza is surprisingly like a noodle. Very very good. Will be making this for years to come!

Perfect for vegetarians at Seder! Not very traditional, but it was excellent.  I scaled down the recipe and served it last Passover and everyone enjoyed.

I made it with Fat Free Cottage Cheese, Fat Free Mozzerella and Francesco Rinaldi or Barilla Pasta Sauce. I have been making it for several years now. It is DELICIOUS! It tastes just like Lasagna.

I used a 16 oz container of cottage cheese (because that's what I had) and about 12oz of shredded mozzarella) and 3 extra large eggs (because they looked very big).
I also only had a 26oz jar of  pasta sauce, so that's what I used, and it was the perfect amount for my 9x13 pan, but I did need about 8 matza boards....

The basic recipe is wonderful, basic and easy to adjust to individual taste.

Great chol hamoed lunch and breakfast.
For those who none-Gebrach, I recommend making for issrue chag or motzei yom tov (instead of waiting in line to buy raw pizza or bagels)
  Pesach matzao is also much  "cleaner" then noodles because it's made from clean, unprocessed wheat. 

Wondering dish!

This was a great recipe. I slightly modified it - three eggs instead of four, and less cottage cheese than called for, and that didn't cause problems. I also added sliced zucchini in each layer.  I will say it was a bit bland, salt & pepper and/or other spices are helpful here.

This is how I make it every year.  The one change is, do NOT soak the matza first.  Start with a thin layer of sauce, then the one piece of dry matza, continue with the layering (using 1 matza per layer) until you reach the top of your pan.  The sauce and other ingredients will moisten the matza perfectly.

This is a very basic outline of a lasagne. You must doctor it up to get any flavor. I used half ricotta and half cottage cheese plus added pecorino romano to egg mixture.  I also added a fresh parsley and basil.  I finished the top with fresh mozzarella and basil leaves. It still didn’t have much flavor. Next time I will add more fresh herbs, crushed red pepper, and kosher salt.

I didn't even realize I was eating matzah! This is good anytime, not just for Passover. Next time, I'll add some chopped spinach :)

Delicious! I was worried that it wouldn't taste like real lasagna. You couldn't even tell that it was matzo! The matzo tasted just like lasagna noodles! I added basil, broccoli, and mushrooms! I substituted the cottage cheese for ricotta. Add lots of Parmesan! Great recipe!
