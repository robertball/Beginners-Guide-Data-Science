My 17 year old Boy Scout wanted to make beer battered fish for his cooking merit badge and I came across this recipe. He followed it almost to the letter; adding a dust of flour up front and then a dip in batter, repeat on flour, double dip in batter before pan frying in a cast iron skillet. He used a mix of halibut and cod and both came out spectacular. I was concerned the Sriracha might be a little spicy, but it was not. It lifted the flavors perfectly. Served with tater tots instead of mashed potatoes, it was a really tasty meal. 5 stars well earned.

Easily a 5 star recipe! How can you go wrong with potatoes, beer and Sriracha.  Not being a fan of instant mashed potatoes, I must say, the Idahoan Signature™ Russets Mashed Potatoes are the real deal. Here's how I made mine: Dredge the fish in flour, shake off the excess and dry on a wire cooling rack for approx 15 mins. or until dry to the touch. Add only enough beer until you get the right consistency to the batter. The oil temp is important so make sure you check it with a thermometer. 365-370 degrees works best for me. A deep fryer is highly recommended.

Perfectly crispy fish. I seasoned my fish with smoked paprika, Mrs. Dash(original) and cayenne pepper. I’ve tried literally 50 other battered fish recipes and this one has ended my search for the best.

Can you go wrong with beer and Sriracha? No. This recipe rocks. Had to go gluten free so,  I used gf flour and gf beer and had to use chicken instead of fish-due to allergies, but the recipe worked all the same. If you use gf flour, be aware that you will probably need more beer. My batter needed a little over 1/2 cup more. Add the beer, mix and wait. Then adjust as needed. It will depend on your flour blend. I also shook the chicken with some flour before putting it into the batter. I didn't have any issues of the batter sliding off. Thank you for the recipe.

nice recipe and all, but it's kinda lame when a a company infiltrates on a certain platform just to promote their one product for a recipe. I understand that it's all recipes but it would b nice if they keep the recipes open to all general product/food item in the sense that you don't have to use a specific brand for the recipe.!

This has wonderful flavor and using the Idahoan instant potatoes are surprisingly tasty. Much better than your typical instant potatoes. My only problem was I couldn't get the batter to stick to the fish.. The only was I was able to make it work was to get some extra flour out and dredge it in flour then the mix.. However... it was awesome tasting. I will make again and hopefully it works out better next time

Really good fried fish recipe. It had a little spice and a straight forward technique. I can't wait to make it again. My family did not have leftovers.

Ive been trying to make homemade fish n chips for many years.. It always came out soso but never as good as the restaurants.. this recipe changed that.  I think the key is dont think the batter is too thin.. thin is ok.. they were so juicy and crunchy. perfect

I skipped the instant potatoes and made French Fries, so it was a delicious fish ‘n chips dinner. I also used much less sriracha, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.

It didn’t turn out well.  It stuck terribly to the wire basket in the deep fryer and we didn’t like the overall taste.  It was a mess.

We made this for supper and loved it. Although not so much a fan of super heat I used half the Sriracha Sauce as the recipe calls for. For us that was perfect. I will make this again. 5
