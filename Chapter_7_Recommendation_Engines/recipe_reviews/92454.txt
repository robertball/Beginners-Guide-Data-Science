I agree that the recipe, as is, is bland. I changed the 1 c water to chiken stock since I saw that as part of the sauce on a different web site. Much more flavorful. Also, I added a T of fermented black beans which I rinsed before adding after I stir fried the shrimp. This was much more like the flavor I get from restaurant take out. Good basic recipe.

I was reading the review by Ms. Bowes. Maybe the reason it tasted a little on the bland side is that there is a discrepancy in the amount of water to use in the mixture. It probably should be 1 cup of water and not the 2 cups you are instructed to use. The tablespoon of water to a tablespoon of starch is correct.

This was very quick and simple to make - took almost no time at all actually!  It was OK tasting, different and pleasant but I thought it was rather bland  - needed some more flavor.  Also, although it was OK in it's own right, this isn't at all like the shrimp in lobster sauce from our local Chinese restaurant.  I'm going to keep looking.  Thanks for the recipe.

there is way too much pork and not enough sauce. Cut the pork to 1/4lb and add a little sherry instead of water. I always stir fry the shrimp, remove them and then make the sauce. Mix shrimp back in when you get that sauce you want. Shrimp don't get overcooked that way

I made this recipe and it is a little bland so I substituted 1/2 lb pork sausage for the pork and also instead of a pound of shrimp I did half pound lobster tail and a half pound shrimp turned out really tasty. Thanks for the recipe.

After reading the reviews I decided to liven this dish up by substituting sesame oil for the vegetable oil and chicken broth for the water. After tasting that I still felt it lacked something so I added a splash of Sherry and that did the trick. Overall good but I do feel it needs some changes to get a boost in flavor.
