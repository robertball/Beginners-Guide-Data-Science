I'm really torn on how to rate this recipe so I'm compromising on a 4. I thought the top & the sides where it got crispy were AWESOME...easily a 10! The middle, however, wasn't very flavorful. Not sure if it was the cheese choice or the 2 cans of celery soup instead of the typical chicken soup...maybe the lack of onion...I don't know. I'd make it again, tho, but spread it out in a bigger tray/pan to get it all crispy-yum :)

I sauteed an onion, half of a red pepper, some portabella mushrooms and a jalapeno in olive oil and then added the other ingredients to the pot and combined.  I also added some garlic salt, pepper and onion powder.  I add these items to just about everything I cook.  The casserole was excellent with a lot of taste.  It did cook quickly and was done in just about an hour.  Will make this again!
