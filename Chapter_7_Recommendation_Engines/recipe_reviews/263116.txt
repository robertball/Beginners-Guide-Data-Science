This worked but the eggs were "done" on the outside but not on the inside.  So when they peeled the "done" layer came off and I had a mini poached egg in the middle.    I get a much more consistent result doing them for  3 min in the instant pot for the eggs as shown in the picture above and 4 min for a slightly more done (not quite runny but not dry and flaky) yolk.

This recipe taught me, educated me, on how you get my "boiled eggs" to come out the way I'd really like. Thank you!

Perfect recipe!  When I put my 6 eggs into the initial boiling water the temp dropped enough that it took the water a minute or two to return to a boil.  I was not sure what to do about the time, so I split the difference between when I put the eggs in and when it started to boil again.
