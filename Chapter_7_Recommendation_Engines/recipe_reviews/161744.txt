This was SO good.  Our family loves it.  I substituted plain Greek yogurt instead of mayo and it was fabulous!!  I also used about 2 T of sugar instead of 1/4 cup.  YUM YUM

I used EVOO, only had miracle whip and only used a tablespoon of sugar. The dressing turned very good and is a keeper.

Very good...a version of French dressing.   EVOO is a healthy choice for oil in this recipe; however, the olive taste tends to overpower the other flavors.  When using EVOO, be sure to refrigerate for at least several hours to help mesh and mellow the flavor.  I will try grapeseed oil or canola next time.

yum!  I used EVOO instead of vegetable oil.  I would def. make this again.  Cost effective, tasty, and no preservatives or funny sounding additives.  Thanks!

I also slightly reduced the sugar and replaced part of it with honey, 1T honey and 2 T sugar for half a batch.  Replace a fourth of the vinegar with apple cider vinegar for extra tang!

This is a nice, simple dressing that uses ingredients readily available in your pantry.  I reduced the amount to four servings resulting in a half cup of dressing.  It was easy to make the lesser amount in a one cup measuring cup using an immersion blender.  I may decrease the amount of sugar the next time, but it was still very good.

Love this dressing! I grated the onion so wouldn't have to use a blender; much easier to clean a grater than to wash and dry a blender bowl and lid ;-)

Wow - great tasting and easy, easy, easy.  ONLY because I wanted it less sweet, I cut the sugar in half.  And tried a variation of substituting the ketchup with plain yogurt, and added a 1/2 tsp of dill.  This variation is terrific.  I used it for salads and over baked potatoes.

Super simple, quick, and delicious. I subbed red onion and olive oil, used slightly less sugar,and eyeballed other ingredients, and whirred it in a mini processor. Took about a minute start to finish, all with ingredients that are on hand. A slightly tangy French dressing that I'll be using again and again.

I have made this recipe for 30 years or better. It was in my husbands family recipes when I met him. To avoid the tinny taste it may have due to the onions being juiced, so to speak, after it sets a few days in the fridge, I use onion powder. If you are using it all right away, use the real onions. Just my opinion.

Too sweet. I really don't see the point of adding sugar in this recipe. It takes much better without it and as commented, by replacing mayonnaise with yogourt.

This was extraordinary!!!! We all loved it. I followed the directions with the exception of adding more onion, as we all love onion. We used it right away as a fry sauce then chilled it. It thickened quite a bit, so I may adjust for that. But thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!!!

I made a small batch for dinner with my family. Found it to be a delicious and easy recipe to make when dressing is needed in a pinch. Would also make it for family events or lunches. Would do again.

Without the mayo, a variation of the measures and adding raw egg, this is used in all Southern Oregon Chinese food restaurants for fried shrimp and Mar Far. I would never think this should be used as a salad dressing, but whatever. It's to DIE for with Chinese, though. You can't run a successful Chinese restaurant here without this sauce. That's what a big deal it is. You won't be welcomed of it's not in the menu. It's a cult following and even has its own Facebook page.

My family loves this dressing. We use it for a dipping sauce as well as salad dressing. I cut back the sugar to 1 Tbsp and have used a variety of vinegars..such as Rose', red wine, champagne...my favorite is red wine.

This has quickly become one of our favorite salad dressings. Easy to make and quite tasty! Only change we made was to use Greek yogurt instead of mayo (a standard replacement in our house).

OMG you are a salad life saver. I am in Australia, French dressing is not available here and it's my favorite dressing! Thank you sooo very much for sharing Chef Joe!! Love it. 

I only used 1 TBSP sugar for a half batch and subbed Veg oil for Canola.

This is delicious.  I didn't change a thing.  I used a wand for blending.

Very Good and easy dressing. Used EVOO instead of oil and low fat cottage cheese instead of mayo

This is okay. It's basically Thousand Island without the pickles. I reduced the oil, as I always do, and used onion powder. Totally fine but not distinctive enough to bother making from scratch. Thanks anyway!
