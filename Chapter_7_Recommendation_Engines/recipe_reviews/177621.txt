Easy and good. IT actually taste better w/ homemade meatballs. I also used regular hoagie bread and added garlic butter and mozarella and it also tasted great.

This was very easy to make and tasted great, but a little hard and messy to eat. I always have frozen garlic bread and there was a sale on frozen meatballs so I decided to make this. I baked the garlic bread then added an italian blend cheese and baked a little longer. I cooked the frozen meatballs in jarred spaghetti sauce but added onion, red green and yellow bell peppers. These turned out great, very easy lunch. I did run out of garlic bread so also had to make my own for the rest of the meatballs.

This RECIPE IS AMAZINGLY GOOD!  The ONLY reason I gave it a 4 star rating is because my ENTIRE family got a horrible gut ache afterwards!  It was WAY too much fat, I believe!  They are SO worth eating...VERY rich!  Be prepared to chase these with Pepto Bismol! =)

I liked these.  My husband didn't.  He thinks the idea of using garlic bread for the bread is ridiculous.  I think it's genius, it added so much flavor!!  I didn't have garlic cheese bread, so I just used garlic bread and put slices of provolone on it before putting it into the oven.  I would love to make this again, but maybe with homemade meatballs.  Maybe then it will get better reviews.
