As written this turns out pretty thin. I like it that way but if you are looking for thick and creamy I suggest not adding all 4 cups of the reserved water at once. You're going to need some but I would start with 2 cups and go from there. I think using reserved bacon grease instead of olive oil would add a lot more flavor too. Overall a good recipe.
