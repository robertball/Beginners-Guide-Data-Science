Delicious!  I also used blueberries (no local blackberries here, yet) and it turned out great!  I changed the serving size to 8, which was the perfect amount for a 9 x 9 dish. I also added a big pinch of course salt to the crumble mix and then topped the finished product with another shake of sea salt before baking... I felt this kept everything from being too sweet for my familyâ€™s taste. Great recipe- will definitely use again with all kinds of seasonal fruit!

I will make it again! This time I used a combo of blackberries and blueberries. I substituted coconut sugar, which has a similar texture to brown sugar.

I used blueberries instead and still turned out awesome. Next time I may use more oats.

This is a keeper recipe! My husband and I both loved it. I made a slight change - I used 3C of blackberries and 2C of peaches (because it's what I had on hand) and I used Almond flour.  The fruit was really sweet so I would reduce amount of sugar next time . But it was delicious just the same! Thank you for this recipe:-)

I cut this down to 4 servings and used individual ramekins rather than a baking dish. I used regular AP flour, as I didn't have a need to make this gluten free. We really enjoyed this! It is tart from the blackberries and sweet from the peaches and crumble. I had made this earlier in the day, so we ate it at room temperature, but this would be even better served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yummy!

I make a lot of fruit desserts but this one was amazing. I used Bobs Red Mill Gluten free flour and oats. No one could tell. Serving it in ramekins was a terrific way to make it special. Topping it with bourbon whip cream was the final touch.

This dish was amazing! Got 5 star reviews from my kids and co-workers. I did change a couple things. First I changed out the fruit. Instead of the peaches and blackberries, I used pluots only.  Secondly, I used almond flour instead of the gluten free flour. Everyone absolutely LOVED it!. Thank you!

Absolutely delicious. Kids get to eat the fruit they would normally not ear.

Like a few others I also used only blueberries - and so reduced sugar a bit as blueberries dont have the same tart taste than blackberries. I think it is a great recipe whatever berries are used anyway ! Served in individual ramekins with a little scoop of French vanilla icecream.

We loved this recipe. My husband and I are diabetics so I made a few changes. My first swap was to steel cut oats, we love them.  I used stevia instead of white sugar, switched out brown sugar for a mixture of stevia with coconut palm sugar (which has a low glycemic index) and instead of white flour I used almond flour for the topping and just a little corn starch with the fruit to thicken the juices. 1/2 cup servings are an awesome breakfast or 3:00pm snack.

I had to change it up. I used 1c peaches and 3 cups blackberries  (they're in season right now). Then I tossed in another handful each of oats and brown sugar into the topping mixture, think I'll just cut back a bit on the butter next time. Delicious! Will be making it again!

I made this with 5 cups blackberries only, and AP flour. The topping I used 1 stick butter instead of 1.5 sticks. I had a thawed pie crust I needed to use, so I did this in a 9 inch pie pan. This was suuuuper tasty! Loved the oats in the topping. It gives a little chewiness. Definitely making this one again!
