EXCELLENT!  I recommend going on ebay and buying the "Great American Steakhouse Onion Machine".  Its really cheap and makes it soooo easy to make the blooms.  It works great!  Otherwise if doing by hand, here is some major tips.  First, a big "no-no" is to cut both ends of the onion off.  DO NOT cut the root end.  Just cut the top.  The root holds it all together, so when you cut your petals they will not fall apart.  Also when coring it, just core it about 90% of the way down, leaving the root intact.  This is easiest with a corer utensil.  When you are done, put it bloom-side down into a bowl of ice water for an hour.  This really helps it to hold up and easier to work with.  Now you are ready to bread and fry your bloom.  When frying I recommend to put it in root side down first.  Then half way thru cooking time flip it over, so that the bloom is on the bottom, and push down on the root.  The pushing down on it will help to open the petals up. When it is done you can go and cut the rest of the core and the root out of the middle.  You will have a perfect blooming onion everytime!  Sorry so long, but I really wanted to help some people that are scared of making them.  My first blooming onion just didnt work and I never wanted to make one again, until I did these steps and it turned out perfect.  This recipe is great.  The sauce is soo yummy!  I slightly warm the sauce before serving, bc it just tastes so much better than serving it cold.  It tastes just like the restaurants

I've combined a lot of the wisdom from other reviewers and added some of my own.  Firstly, I think it's important to do this in a LARGE fryer.  I use the turkey fryer at 375 F. The onion is large so it will drop the oil temp immediately upon dipping it into a small fryer, and if the oil temp drops too much, you will have a soggy, greasy onion instead of a crispy one. I cut the onion and dump it in upside down into ice water for 30 min. to spread the petals.  I also double the dry ingredients to ensure  full coating of the onion.  The first time the dry ingredient amount didn't suffice.  I leave the core intact to keep the onion from falling apart, and then I cut it out after I fry it. At 375 F, it takes about 6 minutes (with core intact) to fry properly.  Keep watching it!  It will overcook pretty quickly and there is a danger of undercooking it.  The middle takes longer to cook than the outside petals, so when you remove it, check the inner petals for doneness.  Towards the latter end of frying, I flip it upside down and push down on it to let the buoyancy of the oil spread out the petals. Of course, the sauce can be adjusted to taste.  I increase the horseradish sauce to 3-4 T, quadruple the oregano, increase the salt to taste, and of course the cayenne pepper, because I like it spicy.

I cut the onion into petals to make it easier on myself after seeing some of the other reviews.  The sauce was amazing.  I have been looking for something like this for a while.  That alone is worth the 5 star rating.  Thanks....I can't wait to try this one again.

No one at my GNO party could believe I actually made this - it turned out beautifully!  I took a previous reviewer's suggestion and put the cut onion in simmering water for one minute, then in a ice-water bath for an additional 3 minutes.  It was hard to get the batter inbetween the layers, but even the ones at the restaurant aren't always that perfect:)  The sauce was terrific.  I have a Fry Daddy Jr., so could only use a medium-large onion, which was perfect after about 7 minutes in the fryer.  Anyone can make this, no kidding.

I don't get the craving for these often but when I do...look out! This recipe is amazing! It rivals that of Outback or any other steakhouse company that have this on their menus! Since I realized that the "bloom" part is just for show, I took so many other's advice and just made these into onion rings. Hmmmmm good! They were the first to dissapear from our dinner table tonight and I will make these again very soon! Highly recommend! Thanks Jackie!

We loved this!  I used the batter mixture to make onion rings instead of the blooming onion and then we dipped the rings in the sauce.  It was a hit!!!

If you like the taste of this dipping sauce, try this; Thousand Island dressing and creamy horseradish sauce! I used to work in a popular restaraunt and this is how we made ours. People loved it! They requested it for their onion rings, onion petals, and even a dip for their shrimp, and as a salad dressing. Last night I tried the dipping sauce in this recipe. Making it exactly as written, it was way too much mayo for my familys taste. I threw that batch out and started over cutting the mayo in half and we all enjoyed it. In the past I have made a dip very similar to this using sour cream instead of mayo and it was very good also.

This is awesome.  So much fun to serve.  The sauce is perfect.  It's definitely not an appetizer because once you start eating them, you can't stop!  Then, there's no room left for a meal!  Great for football season. Go Pats!  I bought this little device from one of those magazines of wierd home things that come in the mail.  I think that's the reason mine come out so well.  It's idiot proof.  It has slots that tell you where to slice, a corer, and it stops the knife before you get to the bottom of the onion.  If you like the bloom, look into it.  Thanks for sharing.

We made this for an appetizer Saturday night and it was really good. I had my hubby do the cutting as I don't have the best relationship with knives. He seemed to think it was pretty easy though. I'd like to make this again, however, I think next time I'll use this flour coating as a base and then coat the onion in a beer batter and see what happens. Thanks Jackie!

The onion part of this turned out really well.  I had an onion cutter sitting the basement so we pulled it out and that worked very well.  I did follow other's advice and put it in an ice bath for about a half hour. We used our little fryer to fry onion and I started it root side up and switched it to petal side up about half way through.  The only part of the recipe that didn't come out so well was the sauce.  Note that this does not call for regular horseradish.  I put about a tablespoon of regular horseradish in and it was way too strong for out taste.  I tried adding more ketchup to mellow out the flavor and it just ended up tasing like cocktail sauce.  I would definitely try making this again, but make sure that you have cream horseradish.  Thanks for the post!

Exceptional! I am really looking forward to making this again, however I think I the amount of cayenne was overwhelming for me. Next time I plan to reduce it for both the onion coating and the sauce so that of my child will like it as well. We had a device to slice the onion into the right shape that I bought a couple of years ago, but had only used twice. We used a baked recipe and it just was not what we really wanted. With this recipe, I think we will be using that onion slicer more often. We placed the onion in ice water for one hour and did not cut off the root end until after it was all done. It was very easy to handle and stayed together well. For the second coat, instead of trying to dip it, we set the onion blooming side up on a sheet and drizzled the batter and flour mixture on top of the first coating. It worked well for us.

Very yummy, just time consuming. I am guessing the more you make it, the quicker it gets. Great dipping sauce, I used it for wraps too.

The perfect party pleaser, we found this recipe is recipe similar to the Blooming Onion from the Outback Steakhouse, and everyone loved it! Took a bit of time to assemble, sure, but it was well worth it. Served it with this sauce recipe, as well as a Hollandaise sauce for dipping, and everything went pretty fast.

This tasted just like the real thing at Outback!!  Especially the sauce!!  Just like other reviewers though, next time I will try it with onion rings. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was the petals and shape of the onion were really difficult to work with and my husband and I were covered in the flour mixture by the end, and the onion didn't get as coated as we would have liked.  Still tasted great though!  Definately will make again cutting the onion into rings first.  Leave the professional cutting of the onion to Outback.

Very tasty but not the easiest to make.  I don't have the onion cutter so I just made onion peddles.  I had a tough time keeping the coating on the onion when frying but they still tasted good!  The sauce was perfect, just like the one at the resturant and fairs.

mmmm yum!  Been thinking of this for a long time.  It's not so hard as it works!  Follow the directions, but don't cut off the root! I also did not hollow out the center as I used some very small onions I had on hand which made excellent personal sized blooms! I left out the cayenne pepper to favor the less spicy-oriented in our family. (If you're spice-paranoid, don't worry, this horseradish doesn't kick too much to enjoy, if you like it hotter, up the cayenne!) I made eight of the mini onions by doubling all other elements of the recipe.  One sauce recipe would have still been fine, and I probably used a third of all the milkwash I made. Excellent recipe and tasted authentic! A little tip - use your corn-on-the-cob grippers and tongs to keep a hold of them while opening and battering, just remove plastic ones before putting the onion in hot oil.

So here's the thing - if a recipe can stand up to being royally screwed up by two teenage girls, it gets a five star rating from me!!! :) This recipe is awesome and I will absolutely use it again and again. We had all the right ingredients, just mixed all together and it STILL worked out fabulous and tasted even better. Very close to my favorite appy at TL steakhouse; definitely close enough to keep me making it over and over again! Thanks for sharing, Jackie!!!!

Had a blooming onion maker that I'd never used & I thought I'd give this a try.  I followed the instructions in the book that came with it, which included soaking the cut onion in ice water for 30 minutes (makes the petals larger & stronger & helps them to maintain their shape during cooking, at least that's what the book said :), dipped in dry then wet then dry, & fried root side up for 5 seconds, then pushed the root down deeper in the oil & fried for another 5 seconds (it said this allows the petals to expand), allowed it to fry for 3 min then turned the onion over so petals were upright & fried for another 3 minutes.  Other than this, I followed the recipe exactly & it came out great....a lot of work, but great!!!

This recipe is great! As far as the blooming onion part the trick is dont cut the root side of the onion off and cut onion face side down into 4ths then 8ths then 16ths but be sure to leave some room between the root and cut so it wont fall apart. We didn't soak or anything and sprinkled flour in between petals before dipping in batter.

Excellent recipe. If you don't have a handy onion cutter and have issues with cutting all the way through....try a jar lid ring. sit the onion on the jar ring (if using a smaller onion) and you will only cut down to the ring. If using a larger onion that wont fit in a jar ring...try something similar, like a cutting board on each side of the onion for a "knife stop".

I actually want to give 4.5, because I just can't bring myself to give 5. I haven't put my finger on exactly why I don't want to give full marks; as others have said, there is an elusive something "missing". That said, this is very, very good indeed. The sauce is very good, and others have done this with onion rings, so it is worthwhile keeping it! The "blooming" part is quite labour-intensive, and I got it right 3 out of 4 times!

The sauce is AWESOME! Just like the Outback Steakhouse type sauce. When making the onion, don't let too much batter drip off before you put it in the flour mixture. I also let it sit in the flour mixture for an hour or more. The batter sticks to the onion better and you have a thicker crust.

Absolutely delicious.  Like some of the other reviewers, I had some problems with the execution, getting the petals to spread and the batter to stick evenly.  I recommend looking through the comments for tips (or maybe even check youtube for video instructions) if you are a deep-fry novice like me.

This batter and dipping sacue were awesome.  even though it is a pain make sure to double dip the batter.  It really does make a huge difference.  I did rings and not the blossom.

Tasted great but not really easy to make due to the size (unless you have a huge deep fryer).  Would work better as onion rings.  Te sauce was out-of-this -world!!!

Dipping sauce is great!  Tried to make onion petals, but I, like others, had difficulty keeping flour mix on.  Onion rings is the way to go.

absolutely great - just like the restaurant version but "blooming" the onion was a huge pain -next time I'll just make it in spears or rings - much easier and still as tasty

This was not nearly as difficult as I expected. It was a big help to have the onion machine that my 13 yr.old gave me for X-mas. This was better than the recipes that came w/ the machine. The sauce was delicious, but spicy. I will make this again with Aussie chicken for a dinner worthy of a popular Australian Restaurant.

If you want the batter to really stick to the onions, place battered onions in the freezer for 10 min then direct into the hot oil.

This is an authentic recipe and produces a Bloomin’ Onion that rivals any restaurant version!  The sauce alone is amazing and can be used for so many things!   I left the bottom of the onion on and did not remove the core.  I use the hard bottom and core to stick a fork into so I have a handle.  This helps when dipping the onion in the hot water and in the batter.

I loved this, ended up doing petals last time. A little on the spicy side though. I'd cut back on the Cayenne pepper.

Yum.  I agree with some of the others about the coating. It is delicious but doesn't stick...so next time ill try dredging them twice.  Perfect otherwise.  Accidentally bought grated horseradish and not creamy horseradish...couldn't tell the difference in taste.  Just make sure to mix the sauce ahead of time and let rest in the fridge so the flavors can mingle.

This was awsome.  Tastes just like the resturaunts.  I wouldnt change a thing about the ingredients.  I would not boil the onion though as specified in recipe. I left mine in the water for 1 min and it went very limp.  Cooked too much.  Altho this is my first time frying an onion, I think next time I will cut the onion then leave it in the fridge over night or for a day.  Onions separate after you cut them and put them back in the fridge for a while.  The sauce was incredible.  We had left over sauce so we used it on breaded catfish too.  Sooo good.

I did not like the sauce at all.  My boyfriend is a huge fan of the chain restaurant's version and it did not taste at all like that.  The onion itself was very good but I will not make the sauce again.

I followed the recipe exactly as it is written. I did however, double the amount of dry ingredients (as was suggested) and it was just the right amount for my large Texas sweet onion! Thank you "pink" reviewer for your tips on preparing the onion- I couldn't have done it without them! The dipping sauce was not to our liking but it is just an opinion and nothing against the recipe. This was a hit with the mister! I will be adding this blooming onion recipe to my collection. Thanks for sharing!

This was fun to make-and so yummy!  Make sure you read other reviews for some great tips on how to cut the onion, make it stay open, etc.  Also, make sure your oil is hot enough, otherwise you'll end up with a slightly crispy but mostly soggy onion.  Enjoy!

This recipe couldn't come to anything closer than the real thing!  I don't like to mess with doing the bloomin onion so much unless it's for show but for just the two of us, onion rings are perfect. No more running out for a 30 minute drive when I get that craving!  
Just wanted some fried veggies, so I tried this recipe with veggies (cauliflower, broccoli, carrots and yellow squash) and I can say that it's just as tasty!  Just let them sit after you have coated them for a bit so that the coating sticks while frying.  The dipping sauce goes great with those too! Now....I can't get that from The Outback!  Thanks Jackie!

I did this for my hubby and me for a snack and it turned out really good. I put less horseradish in it bc all I could find was extra hot. next time Im going to just cut it into petals kind of like fries so its easier.

Excellent. I did do the bloomin' part. Just stick to the petals and it is just as good and tasty. For the sauce I didn't haven any horseradish, so I left it out, it wasn't missed. Make sure you season up your flour really well. That's the flavor you are going to have.

This sauce made an excellent dipping sauce for my onion rings. I made the recipe as stated but cut the horseradish by 1/2..this was perfect for us and kept it from being overpowered by the horseradish.

I did almost exactly the recipe directed
EXCEPT add oregano.I also added a bit more cayenne, as I wanted it HOT. Really close to the Burger King zesty sauce than anything else I tried. This sauce
is also great with homemade chicken nuggets and deep fried fish. I'm hoping to try this as a burger sauce, adding in chopped jalepenos OR pickles.

Fabulous recipe.

I love this recipe!! I make onion rings with it, i found it too hard to cut the onion and it takes longer to cook. I would make it a blooming onion for company, but for family dinners, always rings. The dipping sauce is my new favorite, i love it with french fries too. My husband doesnt like it, but i LOVE it.

We were so hungry for onion rings, and I came upon this recipe...what a great find!!  This is great, it tastes better than the steak houses in our area!  First of all, I didn't have Cumin, so no big deal, and secondly, after slicing the onions, I put them in an ice water bath for about half an hour before dipping in the batter and frying.  And they turned out great, crispy, and not soggy!  This is a keeper!  Thanks!

Perfect, just what I was looking for the other night. I don't have any cumin on hand but I don't think it made too much of a difference. I took the advice of others and chilled the sliced onion beforehand, it came out beautiful. Thanks a lot- I'm in the process of making another one right now.

awesome. as recommended, i made onion rings with the batter instead of a blooming onion (i didn't trust my abilities to make a great bloom). i cut back the cayenne to 1/2 tsp. (batter) and a pinch (dip), and it had just enough heat. delicious, delicious. the result was definitely worth the work of double battering the rings.

I rated a 4 only because of all the work and mess.  The taste was WONDERFUL!!  I used half the mayo and the sauce was so yummy.  Like others, we'll make as onion rings next time :)  Thanks!

Good recipe! Quick and easy...everyone just stood near the fryer and waited for the onions to come out. To make the onion bloom a lot easier, just dip the onion in simmering water for a minute then quickly put it into a ice water bath for about 3 minutes and it'll open up all by itself. I will definately make this one again.

This was delicious, but definitely hard to make. The "bloom" is purely for show, if I make this again, I'll just cut up the onion and use this batter and dipping sauce.

Here's a trick for cutting these great onion treats & also fanned potatoes. Place the handle of a wooden spoon on either side of the onion/potato. When you slice you won't accidently cut to far.

We really liked this one.  I used a jumbo onion and everything still turned out great.  Next time I won't double dip in the batter, I don't think it was needed.  To make the slicing easier, I cut off the bottom and then used an electric knife to cut into 16 wedges.

I wasn't very happy with how this turned out. It was to thick and caused my onion to turn into a big blob. The batter was extremely thick and caused the onion to not bloom even though I put it in the oil petals down so that the oil would help them spread.

I used a apple slicer and corer to cut the onion, I put some butter knives around the onion to not cut all the way through then cut again to get the 16 cuts.

We had recently received a large bag of Vidalia onions, so I was looking for a recipe to use them. This recipe was absolutely wonderful.  A couple of the onions I used had a bad spot, so I had to improvise and forgo the "blooming" technique and just go with onion rings.  The batter for the onion and the dipping sauce were both amazing!  The only change I made to the batter was to use buttermilk instead of sweet milk.  Try this - you won't be sorry.  If the "blooming" technique seems intimidating, you could always make onion rings!  YUMMY!

This dipping sauce is delicious, I will never buy it in a jar again. And it's so easy! I did replace the ketchup and horseradish with an equal amount of shrimp cocktail sauce, as I didn't have horseradish in the house. No matter, it was amazing!

This review is for the dipping sauce only.  I made the sauce to serve with onion rings.  It was good, but it definitely needed more pizzazz.  If there is a next time, I’d up the cayenne pepper and possibly the ketchup for a little added sweetness.

This is so beautiful. This is my new favorite kind of flower... except that we don't have a deep fryer so I just cut my onion into rings and pan fried.  Still- the batter is outrageously delicious and yummmm- they are so sweet and crunchy... do you think this would make a good wedding bouquet?

I made this as onion rings. My husband asked for onion rings for his birthday dinner. I have never made onion rings before—never *fried* anything before!. I followed the recipe pretty closely, only substituting sour cream for the mayo (cannot stand mayo) and horseradish for the horseradish sauce. It was a big hit! Will make these again for another party.

I really loved this recipe.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated except I did not have the time to mess with the blooming technique and instead sliced rings, dipped in the batter and deep fried.  They were fantastic as was the dipping sauce, and they disappeared as soon as they hit the plate.  Thank you!

I thought this recipe was spot on. Loved it. I made the mistake of using giant onions the first time but realized that small to medium size onions work best and they really open when you slice and dip them in the coating -- it's much more manageable to do two small onions than one large one. The sauce was perfect too!!

I only made the dipping sauce. I didn't have the cream-style horseradish sauce, so I used the regular stuff that was in my fridge. I tweaked it here and there, adding more horseradish and cayenne pepper.   I cut the onion into petals, and used my own dry mix. This sauce was very good. Have to try it again with the cream-style sauce!

This tasted awesome! Seemed kind of labour intensive, but I imagine that with every one you make it will seem less complicated.  I used extra hot prepared horseradish because that was all I could find at the supermarket.  I made one sweet onion and one spanish onion and they were both equally good.  I can definitely respect the price of one of these from the Outback Steakhouse!

Made just the sauce.  YUM!  I used 1 1/2 TBS of extra hot horseradish instead of creamy.  Perfect.  Had this with Old Fashioned Onion rings also from this site.  OMG...

Wow! My husband loved the dipping sauce and asked for another batch of onion rings to be made because he wanted more sauce.  Definately adds a kick to just store bought onion rings.  Yummy Thank you.

I'm giving this 2 satrs for the great tasting dipping sauce.  My onion had great promise as I cut it with ease, dipped it into the milk/egg mixture, then coated it real good with the dry ingredients mixture, but when I put it in the hot oil the coating seemed come off the onion.  My oil was plenty hot enough as it was heating up the whole time I was preparing the onion (about 30 minutes).  I wish it would have worked out for me since I LOVE these bloomin' onions!

I did not try the blooming onion, however I did make the dipping sauce to serve with the old fashioned onion rings found on this site. A fantastic combination that tasted exactly like I remember from the restaurant! Don't make this sauce too far ahead of time, we had some leftover and it tasted way to 'horseradishy' the next day.

My entire family loved the onion, as we always enjoy this treat when we are at a festival.  The sauce, I thought, tasted a little too much like mayonaisse, but it was still pretty good.  After we fried the onion, we saw we had bits and pieces of onion left over, so we batter dipped those, and fried them, too!

Made these just as directed.  They turned out great!! Huge hit at my cookout. I have an apple corer that I used to slice the onions, just stopped before I got all the way through and that seems to work well. I chilled the onions before dredging them. Make sure you made extra breading as you go through it quickly. I poured the egg and milk mixture over the onions while spreading the petals. Same with the flour mixture, I sprinkled it while spreading the petals.  Then turned the onions upside down and gave a little shake to remove excess. I repeated this until I had a nice even coat on the onions. Cooked right side up and flipped upside down half way through cooking. Took about 8-10 min and came out perfect!!

I just made this for my husband and I and we both gave it a five!  I made it exactly as the recipe is written except I dipped it in boiling water for a couple of minutes and then let it stand in cold water until ready to cook.  Thank you for sharing.  I've tried making these before but this turned out the best by Farr!

taste was good but the coating got chewy - didn't fry well in oil.  Perhaps need to dry out onion more before coating.

The 3 stars is for the dipping sauce.  Great sauce will make again for other things maybe some calamari or something.  The onion turned out nice, and bloomed (I did the boil method that was suggested).  The onion breading to me was not good, and after 10 minutes the onion was still not cooked all the way through.

I was looking for a simple recipe for the dipping sauce to use on crab cakes or fried fish and thought of the dipping sauce that is served with the Bloomin Onion.  I have not attempted the onion yet but this sauce is great. I did make a few slight changes.  I reduced the salt to 1/8t, (1/4 t. was way too salty!)eliminated the black pepper since the cayenne provides plenty of heat, and added 1/2 t. lemon juice.  I also used ground oregano as I didn't recall seeing any flakes in the sauce at the restaurant.

I made it with a small onion just as it says, except I cut it 10 times (2, 2, 6) and fried it for 4 minutes. The onion was a little less than tennis ball sized. 

As it seems to be said on every websight, the onion was a bit bland, but the sauce was grand. 
The flavor issue can be fixed with some salt, but Outback definitely has some trick they keep well hidden.  
Worth making, but man, will it leave a mess if you're not careful!

Yum! This was tasty. I didn't bother making it into a blooming onion. I needed onion rings to top a hamburger recipe. I did the 1 large sweet onion and just sliced it into thin like rings. They have a lot of flavor, but a slight hot kick from the cayenne. So, have a large glass of iced tea nearby! I didn't bother with the sauce, because I didn't have any horseradish. I have made a similar sauce though and it is good, but not neccessary.

This was fantastic. I didn't even bother to make the sauce because I don't use dips or condiments of any kind, so I can't speak to it...but the onion was excellent. I used an apple slicer tool to core and make the petals. So simple, worked like a charm and my onion looked exactly like the kind you'd find in a steak house. The breading was excellent, although I did have a lot of trouble thoroughly breading all of it. I didn't take a photo to post because it wasn't pretty!! It did taste amazing though and with a little more practice and trial and error I'm sure I'll find a technique that works for me to get it breaded correctly. 
This recipe is great. Will become one of my regulars.

Just like at the restaurant, Our onion was too big for the fryer so we cut it into sections and we've also made it with rings of onion.

This was an excellent recipe! We made a few minor changes. First, instead of cutting the onion into "petals," we simply cut it into rings. It worked just as well. Second, we didn't double dip the cut onions (so the batter/coating would be a bit lighter). Third, we only used a pinch of cayenne instead of 1.5 tsp (we wanted something not quite so spicy hot) and we omitted the thyme (more by accident than by design). Better than the restaurant version!

I only tried the sauce b/c I already had another recipe for the onion (which I failed at making correctly) but the sauce was very good and close to what you typically find in restaurants.

Outstanding! I'm not sure why other reviewers said the sauce doesn't taste like Outback, mine sure did! I used regular horseradish and used less than 2 tablespoons. I made it the night before I served it. The onion cutting was easy, I did not cut the root. The battering was a mess and kind of a pain, but worth it in the end. The batter tasted just like Outback. This was SPOT ON Outback's version!

The onion ring part of this is fine, but the sauce recipe has got to be wrong.  If you use 1/2 cup of mayo, the sauce will taste like mayo, which isn't how the Blooming Onion sauce tastes.  I would switch the amounts for the mayo and horseradish--use much more horseradish than mayo, and it should turn out well.  To make it spicier, add some more cayenne pepper.

Yummy!!! this sauce was great.  I didn't have any oregano, but this still turned out delicious!  I only had hot cream-style horseradish so I only used 1 tblsp of that and omitted the cayenne pepper cause hubby doesn't like spicy food.  I used this dip with the "Old Fashioned Onion Rings" that is on this site, and that is a great recipe.

I feel like a rating of 4.5 would better represent my opinion of this recipe. The sauce is excellent and I have made it a few times now, but I think there is something missing; however, until I figure out what it is, I will continue using this recipe! I decided to just make onion rings instead of the actual blooming onion, and they were really great. The seasoning was wonderful! I think I might try to do the whole onion the next time though! I'm just a little scared to try it!

Yummy!  I did onion petals because I did not think is was worth the time to go thru the steps of a blooming onion, I tried battering just once, did not turn out that great, but on the 2nd batch I did the double batter and those turned out really good, so I recommend that highly.  For the dipping sauce, I only used 1 & ½ tablespoons of horseradish sauce and that was plenty for my taste (it was still strong), I also added an extra ½ tablespoon of ketchup after tasting and an additional 1/3 teaspoon paprika for more color.  REALLY GOOD STUFF.

I made this for the first time last night. I messed it up because of my poor cutting skills. The onion was crispy, loved the batter, but I still didn't get it coated or cooked into the middle. Again, probably because of my poor cutting skills. Luckily, I bought two vidalas and will try this again soon! I also made the dipping sauce, a big hit. Update. Made petals last night and also soaked onion for 30mins in cold water as suggested. Still forgot to let them rest, but were even better the second time around! Thanks for posting

I cheated (like always) & tweaked a bit. Instead of individually using ketchup & horseradish (plus seasonings) I had some extra hot cocktail sauce that I used. I used the additive amount of horse radish/ketchup. I didn't add any more cayenne or other hot spice. However, I did add the oregano & other spices. We used it for fried mushrooms. Everyone *loved* it. The spice was a good kick & it was nice & creamy.

We've made this recipe 3 times in less than 3 weeks!! My family is just crazy abt this bloomin onion recipe and the Dippin sauce recipe is to die-for!! I ordered from ebay the " GREAT AMERICAN STEAKHOUSE ONION MACHINE" and it really does make beautiful onion bloomers!Very messy and lots of work - but the results is worth it!This recipe will work just as great with onion rings - so on lazy days, will just cut onion into rings and ditto with the rest of the recipe!

Absolutely awesome recipe! I did not have the time nor the patience to make the blooming onion shape, neither did I want to get the deep fryer out and pour a ton of oil in it. I simply cut out onion rings and proceeded as mentioned in the recipe. The onion rings were hit! The sauce was very good, too. Just make sure you get the plain horseradish paste: I made the mistake of using the horseradish in vinegar paste and my first batch of dip got tossed. I went back to the store and got the plain kind and the result was simply perfect! I did not and would not change a thing!

This recipe is awesome.  We tried to cut the onion to look like the bloom and it was a complete failure so next time we will cut it in pieces instead.  Even though it didn't look good, it tasted great.

I love the sauce for this, although I do cut back on the horseradish a bit, after having made it as written too.   I have a hard time getting the onion to batter properly, the outside gets done beautifully, but the inside tends to stick together and not get crispy.  So last night I just cut it into petals and battered the chuncks individually and fried like that.  Perfect!

I tried making the blooming onion, but when I dipped it into the dry mixture the onion didn't fully get covered...it was a disaster.  I tried the recipe again, cutting the onion into rings and it worked MUCH better and was ten times easier. Also, I only dipped it in the wet mixture once because when I did it a second time, all of the dry mixture came off. Its also easier to coat onions by putting them into a ziplock bag with the dry mix and shaking it. Very delicious recipe, next time I might add more cayenne to make it spicier.

I just made the sauce here and it is an exact replica as the sauce served at Lone Star Steakhouse.  Yummy!!  My kids are addicted to it and eat it on everything. They especially love it on french fries and fish sticks.

This is so good.  I had some problems getting the onion to fry properly, but the taste is amazing.  It only needed to fry for a couple of minutes and next time I will try to push the onion into the oil with the petals facing down to try and force the oil to push the petals open.  Great recipe, I halved the horseradish in the dip and that was plenty.

I loved this recipe my boyfriend said it was even better than outback. the real secret is the double dipping. it wasn't plain tasting and i added a little garlic salt to mine before serving. but i will definitly make this one again.

I only did the sauce (I already had an onion & just needed more sauce) but it was PERFECT.  I've tried other recipes for this sauce & this is the first and only one that comes close to the original.

PERFECT

This is so close to the appetizer served in restaurants its amazing!  I absolutely adore the dipping sauce and will use it often for other fried foods.  However I didnt add the horseradish because I didnt have it and it was still great.  The bloom didnt turn out as good as it should have but it really doesnt matter, I like the smaller pieces rather than the rings but I'll try that next time!  Great recipe!

We just made the dipping sauce to go with some onion rings (see: Spicy Onion Rings) very good.  Didnt have any regular mayo so we used fat free, looks kind of weird but tasted very good without all the fat!

AWESOME!!!!  Just as good as the ones from the resturants and it was easy to make.  It took me, at most, 15 minutes from the time I printed this off the internet till the time we were putting the finished onion on the table.  We will definitely be making this one again.  Also, the sauce is so good.

Very tasty. We liked it. I messed up ad added the amount of Cayanne for the batter into the SAUCE. Woops. I added some bleu cheese dressing to calm it down.. waaaay down. Also, I heeded the advice of others and just cut it into rings. If you do cut it into rings, be sure to either double your batter amount or do not double dip the rings. I ran out of batter since the wetness was mixing with the flour too much. I also addedd a tad of Guiness to the milk and egg mixture. Thank you for sharing it!

The sauce was FANTASTIC! Oh so good! The batter, not so great. I suggest doubling the dry batter mix, I ran out after half of the onion had been battered and I hadn't even had a chance to rebatter as the recipe says. That may be the reason the onions didn't turn out well.

These were pretty good.  I made onion petals instead of a whole flower just to make the process easier.  I also left out the oregano and added some garlic powder and a little salt to the dry ingredients.

Dipping sauce was very good. I would probally use a little less mayo next time and a little more horseradish sause. I ate this with onion rings also.

This was absolutely delicious.  It's just as good as the recipe says.  The sauce might be too spicy for some kids, however.  We served it to ours with a side of BBQ sauce and they liked it that way.

To help with having your eyes tear from the onion, cutting the root end FIRST eliminates the tears.
This was incredibly easy and it turned out perfectly!

It came out very well . I have tried several ways to prep onion, if you freeze it after cutting the petals spread when you set them out for about 30 min. And if you freeze it again after coating the mixture sticks to onion better. These methods take a lot of time unless you do the steps eat of time.

The first time I made the sauce I followed the recipe and made no changes.  My husband thought that it tasted fine, but I thought it tasted too much like mayo.  I decided to cut back the mayo a small bit, and add a little Thousand Island dressing. Need to work on our onion a bit. Either got too little or too much batter.  Practice will help improve. For trying for the first time, I think it turned out pretty good.

Awesome Sauce!!! And the batter too. Granted, I am deep-frying-with-oil challenged (it's messy and it scares me... don't ask), I still pulled off a successful analogue using a deep pan and an inappropriate amount of butter. I only had half an onion leftover from a small pasta sauce batch, so I didn't bother blossoming it, I just did traditional onion rings, and also used some green and yellow squash slices. I didn't have  a 1/3 or 1/8 teaspoon (or they were buried in the back of the drawer), so I used a 1/4 teaspoon and eyeballed the measurements. I also was lacking thyme. Nevertheless, with all the situational substitutions, this was a really good recipe. The breading batter was nice and spicy. I like spicy, but when I realized how much cayenne was called for, I raised an eyebrow. But I still liked it (more sensitive types might want to scale the cayenne back a bit). The sauce was great too.  If you're not able to deep fry or blossom the onion, you can still give this recipe a try.

Very close to the popular restaurant chain that makes this. I did add an extra tablespoon of ketchup to the top and felt that made it a bit better. Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful!!! A tad spicy for my 7 year old but everyone else devoured it! Make sure to get into every crevice when breading. Don’t cut the root-end of the onion- that holds it all together. Cut stalk side off, then turn onion cut-side down and slice. Fry upside down 4 min first, then flip and fry another 4-6 minutes. I cut the mayo with sour cream by 1/3. Next time I’ll do half mayo and half sour cream as I never solely rely on mayo in anything I make.

I rated it a 5 because I hate giving anything less to something I have not tried. I just wanted to say this sounds waaaaay too involved just to make what will basically be sloppy onion rings for most folks because this recipe is not very easy to accomplish, even with the suggestions of other cooks here. If you have a hankering for a truly good Blooming Onion, just go to Outback Steakhouse...the folks who created this awesome appetizer!

The recipe makes a great onion .  I made 2 onions for New Years Eve. They were  a good imitation  of the famous one .  I don't think I would make  it again , however.  the first one I made ,  was a problem. As I was slowly lowering  the onion into the hot  oil, the last  inch of the  onion  caused the oil to boil violently and overflow  onto  the stove top .fortunately, it is an electric stove. I had drained the onion carefully. The  second one was ok.   I feel this too dangerous for the average home.   BUT, several reviewers  mentioned that they prefer  to make onion rings  instead.  Since the batter recipe and dipping sauce is so Good, I agree. I think it would be faster and less dangerous. And I am sure ,  every bit as delicious!   
     But  for those  who want to do the whole onion, please  be very careful , and ENJOY.

Best recipe I've found for this item. The family loved it. The batter recipe was perfect (if you are trying to match "that" restaurant), and the dipping sauce is pretty close.

wow! This was delicious!!  I cut back on the cayenne pepper, just because very spicy foods don't agree with me! But my husband and I both thought it was amazing and will definitely be making again.

I only made the dipping sauce (for another recipe).  Sauce  was decent, but not great.  Mayo was overwhelming... will cut back a tad on it next time.   I added a little more ketchup, and some hot sauce to compensate.

Really good. A couple tips: MAKE SURE you get breading in ALL the nooks and crannies and open it all the way up. Works with any size onion. Didn't have any horseradish, so we just added extra spices and a bit of whole grain mustard to the sauce and it worked.

2nd time's a charm.  Omitted the cayenne pepper in both the flour mixture & the dipping sauce because I found both too spicy with it.  Easier to make than I thought.  It's ready when the onion is golden brown & it floats in the oil.

Made the dipping sauce, only, to go with onion rings.   Had the perfect "kick" to it and was fantastic!  Will make many more times.

Excellent recipe! Restaurant quality. I did not go to the trouble of boiling and cooling the onion and it was hard to separate. Next time I will try the additional steps.

I made onion petals with this last night. Next time I will make rings for simple fact that it is easier. However, this was really good. It is just like what you get out at the restaurant. I will make this again.

Wow! That was difficult! I let it fry for 10 min. But some of the batter was still raw in the inside of the onion. I probably need to buy a blooming onion cutter.

I needed a quick recipe for a dipping sauce for my fried mushrooms and onion. I used a different batter so I'm only commenting on the sauce. It was great. It really accented the mushrooms and onion. Top rated.

I cut back on the cayenne just a little bit & I didn't have any dry dill, nor did I make the suase. But needless to say, I love this recipe. I've already made it 3 times & my wife & I can't get enough!! Thank you so much!

Awesome....I did soak the onion in ice water for an hour.  After battering we set it in fridge for awhile as I read somewhere this will help the batter to stick better.  I also fried it upside down (petals down) first then flipped it.  We tweaked to sauce a little by adding some sriracha sauce.

I made both as single pieces and the whole onion, the pieces were much better and easier to cook, we snacked on them while we made the rest of our meal.

Exactly like the OutBack Blooming Onion dipping sauce! I doubled up on the  Cayenne Pepper and Horse Raddish to give it an extra kick. Its a great sauce for chicken tender and french fry dipping as well.  Great recipe share!

Most definitely 5 stars worthy!!!!  I used an apple corer to cut the first 8 slices I then did an additional 8 cuts with a sharp knife.  I submerged it in ice cold water also for about 45 minutes. Make sure to not pull the core out until ready to serve. Another note make sure to have enough oil to submerge the entire onion in oil at once.

I didn't make the onion, I just made the dipping sauce for some store bought onion rings. I used 4 packets of Horsey sauce from arbys for the horseradish part of the dip. I did add more hot pepper powder and very hot because I like spicy. This was really really good

This was great! My whole family loved it. On the breading and egg mixture though I doubled. The onion couldn't be coated twice without doubling all the ingredients. Other then that it was awesome!!

I was in a tight spot to try to get dinner on the table in less than half an hour.  The sauce from this recipe actually saved the day!  I didn't have any creamy horseradish sauce - in fact I had no horseradish sauce of any kind!  I used hot mustard sauce in its place, and it was the BOMB!  I was serving burgers, onion rings and fries.  People were dipping both fries and onion rings AND they were saying, "Mmmm" and putting it on their burgers too!  Tasty!  Thanks, Jackie Smith!

BOMB.COM. Wow!  These were incredible!! I took the advice of other reviewers and did petals instead of blooms for ease. Worked perfectly. The texture of the batter was incredible. YUM!!! Only took 4-6 minutes in my little fryer and I did three small batches at a time. 

The horseradish I had was expired :( so I improvised with  the sauce, adding Franks buffalo, Worcestershire, and garlic salt. Was weird tasting on its own but it was MADE for those petals. 

Incredible recipe, will definitely make again!!!!

I thought it was a super great recipe. I cut the onion per your instructions, because my onion was too big for the plastic cutter that I had.  Their recipe was very similar to this one. So I used this recipe, added more cayenne pepper and a little garlic powder, soaked it in just a cold ice water bath for 15 minutes.  I didn't take out the bottom of the onion, used the plastic core cutter after it was done. The problem I had was getting all the egg and flour in between all the petals.  Jackie, what if I mix the egg, milk and flour all together to make a thick batter (or use pancake mix) and dry off the onion and then let it sit in the batter?  Have you or anyone tried this approach? I tried so hard some of my petals fell off.  Really though it was a great recipe, the crunch was there and the dip was really good, I love horseradish sauce so I added more, to each his own, right?  The other recipe, like others in the reviews said sour cream and mayo, will try that next.  I love onion blossoms from T.R. and this recipe is really close, but it could be something I did, not your recipe.  If I use pancake mix I would put in corn starch to make them crunchier. I'm being too picky, really mine turned out great, taste, crunch, spicy but not every petal was covered, some stuck together.  Must be an easier way to get all the petals covered. Will make this recipe again and again. I am really hard to please so thank you for sharing.

This was delicious!  The cutting of the onion was a bit tricky and I don't think I separated the petals enough but the batter was awesome!  I did not have mayo or horseradish so I subbed sour cream for the mayo and hot sauce and worcestshire for the horseradish.  It tasted just like the restaurant! We will make this again.

OMG. So good. So, so, so good. I didn't have cumin so I used a hefty dose of chili powder. This tastes very close to the "real" thing.

The sauce isn't fantastic, you can taste the mayo and its quite thick. I added a bunch more horseradish sauce and a tiny bit of lemon juice to loosen it up. Still not like Outback, but very good.

This receipe is spot on...for the onion I followed the directions to a tee, no changes what so ever. I have already made this twice this week. My kids love it! I was a little confused on how to cut the onion, looked it up on YouTube and got it right the first attempt. It really is easy to cut once you actually watch it being done.

The only change to the sauce I made was 1/4 cup sour cream and a 1/4 cup mayonnaise . The dip was really good. It is missing something that outback has in theirs but still close  enough.

This will definately become a family favorite.

Very good - cutting the onion is difficult and it's a bit of work but it's very good.  Will be buying the "Great American Steakhouse Onion Machine" soon and will make this again and again...very good!

The flavor of the batter and the dipping sauce are great, exactly what I was looking for.  We particularly liked the cayenne pepper, and thought the dip might be good on burgers.  But I had a devil of a time getting the blossom to stay together.  I'm sure I just need practice, but next time I'll probably use this recipe to make onion rings instead.

Sauce came out really good. had some trouble with the temperature of the oil, was nervous when the onion was frying because it looked soggy after a few minutes, but once it came out of oil it wasn't as soggy as it looked. good recipe!

I absolutely LOVE onions rings, and this recipe was perfect to my palette! Just like another reviewer noted, I used Krustez pancake mix, not just because of it only needing water but because it does not use corn syrup, and added spices to the batter to my own taste (McCormick Steak Seasoning grinder, chili powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper). Next time I will be using this to make a blooming onion!

Awesome! The only suggestions I have are skip the blooming part and just do thin onion rings as it was a bit easier and less messy. Also in the flour mixture, I may cut back on the cayenne  just a tad next time. But all in all very close to restaraunt recipes! Now we can eat this at home in front of the tv! yay!

I only used the sauce for some frozen onion rings, but the sauce is spot on.  It is really easy to adjust to different tastes too, as I ended up adding less horseradish to mine, and more horseradish and cayenne to my husband's. Tasty and zippy!

Wow!  I've made this twice now...the first time substituting the onion w/ zucchini & yellow squash slices, and the result with absolutely fabulous!  This is the first thing I made in my deep fryer, and without a doubt, this is the only coating & dipping sauce recipe that I'll use for all my veggie frying in the future.

I made only the dipping sauce to go with the old-fashioned onion ring recipe from this site and it was fantastic - I may cut the horseradish to 1 tablespoon next time though.

Dipping sauce only--We use a different recipe for onion rings so we did not try this one but the recipe for the sauce is great!  The perfect touch.  Just like in restaurants.  I did not make any changes.  I may try cutting back on the horseradish a bit next time but it is excellent as-is.

5 stars for the sauce only (i was using packaged onion petals and didn't realize the sauce came with it).  I made this sauce, then found the petals came with it, put both sauces out, my family actually preferred this recipe more than the one that came with the petals!  Next time I'm going to try the full recipe, as it looks awesome, and my family seems to love them!

I didn't make the blooming onion but used the dipping sauce with some onion rings and everyone loved it. I did add a little extra cayenne and this will be a regular.

I only made the dipping sauce.  I used it for a grilled blooming onion.  The dipping sauce was great.  I thought it could use just a little more horseradish.

Okay, the taste was good and the sauce was good, but I am only giving it 3 stars because... it was hard to cut, hard to coat, hard to handle, and hard to cook.  I found that when I took it out of the oil, some of the coating deep in the onion was still uncooked.  I think I will stick to onion rings, which are much easier to make.  I might keep the sauce recipe, however.

I just used the sauce to coat chicken in quesadillas, I was going for the outback sauce. Boyfriend said it turned out good, maybe a little less mayo and more of the spices next time. thanks for the recipe!

LOVE IT!!!!! I agree with the other poster about doubling the batter if you cut up the onion in rings or petals. Great recipe. We went out and bought a fryer so we can make it more often.

This was really very good and very easy. I think next time I will either leave out the cumin or cut back on it.

a little too much horseradish for me, it got a little overwhelming after a while, but overall wonderful. i also took the advice from others and just made onion rings. i will definitely use this recipe again.

I did not make the dipping sauce but I did everything suggested to make the onion "bloom" and it didn't work.  I left it in boiling water one minute then immediately put it in ice water.  I dipped and coated it twice, then let it sit for a few minutes before putting it in the oil. Next time I'll make petals and not try for the "blooming"

This recipe was great especially the sauce.  I used chili powder instead of cumin b/c that's what I had.  My onion fell apart.  It's alittle tricky with opening it.  Once again, awesome recipe!!

DELICOUS!  I didn't use the blooming onion step, just the dipping sauce for another onion ring recipe on this site, and it was divine!  Now my children, who are all under 8, weren't huge fans of the dipping sauce, but my DH and I loved this!

I only made the sauce and made and onion ring recipe that I got on this site to go with it instead. My husband and I used to go to the Black Angus to eat and I always ordered a sauce that tasted just like this to go with my onions. I didn't have the oregano but tasted great without it!

This recipe does not work with small onions.  If you make it, be sure to use a large onion or it will not come out correct.  I give three stars because it tasted ok, and it does specify a large onion.  I will attempt to make this again with a large onion.

Ok. I have only made the sauce but it is wonderful. I can't wait to try the onion rings to go with them. I used frozen. The sauce has just the right amount of kick to it.

I made this last night and it was great! The sauce tasted just like what they serve at OUTBACK and the onion did as well. I had the onion slicer and it was easy; didn't look as nice as they do at the restaurant, but tasted the same. Thank you for posting this for us to use.
