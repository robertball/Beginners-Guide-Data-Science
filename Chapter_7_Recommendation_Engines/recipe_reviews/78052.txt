Original recipe is 5 star and perfect for my vegetarian friends.  Personally, I am a carnorvoire and have tried variations of this soup and all have been wonderful including the original posting.  Try the following suggestions if you'd like to change it up:  1.)  1/2 vegetable and 1/2 beef broth to replace all vegetable broth.  2.)  Add diced red meat - if using a tougher cut, let it simmer in the broth until tender making sure your liquid doesn't reduce down much before adding the carrots and celery.  The beef imparts a much richer flavor.  3.)  1/2 cup cooked barley is sufficient for this recipe, otherwise the barley soaks up the liquid.  Enjoy!!!

i should have warned about the pepper!
you should only use the very fine black pepper that most stores sell... if you use  fresh coarse black pepper it will ruin the recipe! if you're not sure, omit the pepper and season to taste later.

Great soup! Very easy to make and quite tasty. I used 3 cloves of fresh garlic and didn't have any parsley to add, but I don't even notice it. I also used low-fat, low-sodium chicken broth. For those whose soup came out very thick, try using non-instant barley...it takes more time but is well worth it!

This is a great hearty soup with lots of flavor!  Perfect for a cold day.  I omitted the Worchestershire sauce since my household is vegetarian and I couldn't find the veg variety.  Since I didn't want to leave out that tanginess, I added a splash of red wine vinegar instead.  It came out nicely.

Wow!  This was delicious, I added tomato paste instead of the diced tomatoes, more broth and less barley, and prepared it in a crockpot for 10 hours on low while I was at work.

Will definetly make again!

Wonderful hearty & healthy soup! I feared it would be too thick, so I cooked the barley separately.  I also added red pepper & parsnips.  It seems any veggie would be great in this, as would any bean type--though I would add softer beans late in the cooking so they don't disintegrate.  The barley & spices are what sets it apart from other veggie soups.  Will make again & again! Thanks!

This is my first review, though I've tried lots of recipes from this site.  Beaker, this is a hit with us.  I make this about twice a month and do not change one thing! It's one of the tastiest, healthiest soups we've ever had.  I wish Allrecipes had a category just for reviews of dishes prepared exactly as written, instead of a rating along with someone's detailed explanation of ALL the changes they made to it.  What exactly are they rating?  The original or their version of it?  Thanks for sharing, Beaker!

What a wonderful, satisfying, hearty, feel good soup!  I substituted chicken stock for the vegetable broth and sauted several cloves of chopped garlic with the chopped onion in a little olive oil before proceeding with the recipe and omitted the garlic powder.  This is truly a keeper!

A very tastey, hearty soup.  Very filling.  I did make some changes - I used a clove of minced garlic instead of garlic powder and 1/4 t crushed red pepper and 1/4 t chili powder instead of curry plus added some spices like basil and oregano.  I will certainly make this again soon!

This recipe has the best of many worlds - it's healthy, easy to make, inexpensive and the end result is a huge pot of yummy soup. I added a large container of fresh mushrooms and a 6 oz. package of spinach - this increased the moisture levels, so it wasn't as thick as others posted. I also used fresh garlic and threw in a teaspoon of savory by accident - it was still good!

This soup was so flavourful and hearty.  I too cut back on th barley to 3/4 cup and the leftovers continued to thicken as the barley absorbed more of the broth.  Loved the seasonings and textures.  This is going into our favourites and will be a regular feature through the winter!

This is a phenomenal recipe as written, and I have made it many times. My meat-eating boyfriend loves it! I make certain modifications depending on my mood and how much time I have to prepare. When I'm in the mood for a soupier consistency, I add extra veggie broth and precook the barley. I read a review several months ago that suggested swiss chard, so I've been adding that and love it! One thing that I feel is very important (at least, for me) is that you add the zucchini and swiss chard toward the end of the 90 minutes. It keeps the zucchini from disintegrating. Curry is so amazing in this soup, and the aroma is so great when it's simmering on the stove. I can't say enough good things about this recipe. I'm actually coming down with a cold today, and I'm going to head straight home and make a batch of this soup to cure me right up. Thanks Beaker!

This soup was absolutely fantastic! Added a few more sticks of celery than written but kept it the sane otherwise. Made it in the slow cooker as it's my biggest pot. Stuck everything in and cooked on high for 5 hours. Will make this again and again!

This soup is SO good! I followed several reviews - cooked in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours, used 10 cups of veg. broth (2 cups extra than recipe calls for), added a can of V8 instead of tomatoes cause I don't like tomatoes, and threw in a bit of cabbage.     I also used fresh parsley (since I had some that was wilting), chopped garlic instead of garlic powder, and crushed bay leaves. The spices in this recipe make such a great combination - thanks for sharing!

I don't often give a recipe five stars but the great flavor, simplicty and economy of this recipe deserves it.  This is perfect soup for cold weather!  I've made this several times and found that using 1/2 veg. broth and 1/2 beef broth gives a better flavor.  I also add a few extra cups of broth because we like it more soup-like than stew-like.  Also, I use frozen green beans in place of the zucchini because they hold up better.  Unless you put the zucchini in about 1/2 hour from serving, it gets mushy.  I like to make a double batch and freeze half.  It's wonderful to come home to after work and the freezing doesn't really affect the taste.

This is a delicious, hearty & healthy soup that is so easy and makes a huge batch!  I made it the first time exactly as is and it came out great.  I'm not a vegetarian so the second time I made it I used chicken broth instead and it came out even better.  The combination of spices is very yummy, with a little kick!

I LOVE this soup! I have made it twice in the past three weeks. Each pot makes a heap and lasts me for several lunches and dinners. Amazingly, I still enjoy eating it day after day. So healthy, economical, and tasty! I used half a head of shredded green cabbage instead of the zuchinni and it was delicious. 

This is truly winter comfort food at it's finest.  For such a humble looking recipe I was completely surprised by how delicious it was! Yummy. I'll be making batch no. 3 very soon…I honestly crave it!

All I can say is WOW!!!
What a GREAT recipe to make on a cold December day.
My son said, "I pay $3 a can at the store for a soup
that is not half as good as this."
I stuck to the recipe exactly as stated. Try it.
You will LOVE it.  Guaranteed!!!

I skipped the pepper and reduced the amount of barley from 1 C to 1/2 C. I used 4 diced tomatoes rather than canned.  I cooked this soup in a crock pot set on high and it was completely done in about 4 hours.

I've made this twice and it's wonderful. I do add more veggies than this calls for. Added green beans and parsnips this time. Very flavorful. Didn't add sugar - not sure why soup needs sugar. Followed recipe otherwise. Very yummy comfort food.

This is NOT vegetarian.  Worcesterchire sauce contains anchovies, so please do not pass this off as vegetarian or vegan to your friends.  Omit the worcestershire and season to taste.

Excellent.  You don't even miss the meat!  Used low sodium chicken broth, added som additional water, used only 3/4 cup of the barley and added a sweet potatoe.  Kids and adults liked this soup - smells wonderful while cooking, too!  Will put this on the Winter soup rotation.

This was not a thick soup, which was fine, though the leftovers will be thick as the barley continues to soak up liquid.  I really liked it and the vegetable soup haters in our family really liked the flavor of the broth.  The only changes I made were to use dried beans I'd previously cooked/frozen and to use a handful of chopped, fresh parsely instead of dried.

This recipe was fantastic. Easy to prepare and cook; heartily appreciated by my friends during the winter.  I made a few small changes the second time I made it. I increased the amount of celery, added a can of kidney beans (in addition to the chickpeas) and slightly decreased the amount of barley. It is a very versatile recipe: definitely a keeper.

Recipe was tasty as originally written, so don't quite understand why the contributer felt a need to add an additional comment, stating her recipe would be ruined if course pepper was used?  I used course pepper (it's the only kind I buy) and it was perfectly fine.

This was great!!!  One bit of warning for the vegetarians, Worcestershire sauce has anchovies in it.  You can find anchovy free sauces though.

Yum!  I altered this recipe based on what I had on hand.  I sort of combined this recipe with the Bean Soup with Kale recipe (also found on AllRecipes).  Here's what I did:  I sauteed chopped onion and celery in olive oil until softened.  Then I added about 6 cups washed/chopped kale, sauteed until wilted (it cooks down like spinach).  Then I added chopped carrots (3 large), zucchini (2 medium), and garlic (5 cloves).  Added sugar, parsley, curry powder, and paprika; cooked another 10 minutes.  (Left out salt because I'm watching sodium and can add it later as needed.)  Once the onions started browning and the other veggies became tender, I added the diced tomatoes (w/ juice), garbanzo beans (drained), a splash of red wine vinegar, 1 quart of mushroom broth, 2 cups veggie broth, 2 cups water, and 3/4 cup uncooked barley.  Brought to boil, simmered (covered) for 90 minutes.  Did not blend.  Added salt and pepper to taste.  Delicious!!!

The best!  I made this yesterday, and amazingly had all the ingredients!  It was so good that I will make it again very soon!  It  makes a lot,  about 3 quarts, but it's certainly worth freezing if you can't eat it all right away.

I can't stop eating this! I followed other people's reviews and sauteed the onion and spices with some minced garlic before adding chicken broth and the rest of the ingredients. We added some sprigs of fresh cilantro before serving which also added a little flavor kick.

I run a small catering business, and this soup is a huge hit every time.  I cut way back on the barley though, as it really absorbs all the stock and is just too thick for my taste.  Really delicious though & so hearty!!

Absolutely excellent soup!  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly, only modifying the amount of barley I used (3/4 cup still makes a pretty thick soup).  I wouldn't change a thing about it!  Organic broth and veggies are definitely the way to go!  This is also a great crockpot recipe!  I threw everything in and let it cook on high about 4 hours and then reduced the heat to low for serving.  Thanks for a great soup recipe!

Delicious and hearty soup. With Triscuits or garlic bread it is a full meal. I left out the bay leaves as I didn't have any, and replaced the Worcestershire sauce with soy sauce. I used a whole bunch of chopped fresh parsley. I did not have canned garbanzo beans so I added a can of black eyed peas with japapenos and bacon, which added to the rich flavor and spice. I used tomato paste instead of the diced tomatoes. The barley ratio needs to be reduced a little, unless you want a very thick soup. Will make it again, next time with garbanzo beans.

This is so good and good for you.  I used cannellini beans in place of garbanzo.  Omitted the sugar and salt.  I also added an additional can of RoTel tomatoes with green chilies.  This recipe makes a lot of awesome soup to take in my lunch.

Amazingly tasty for a veggie soup, and my kids both asked for seconds.  This never happens.  I did halve the amount of barley (we like brothy soup), and it only took about 60 min to finish.  Suggest starting with only barley and stock, and then cut and add the other veggies in order of required cooking time (e.g., carrots, onion, celery, tomatoes, chickpeas, zucchini)  Looking forward to trying it with other fall veggies like kohlrabi and parsnips.

As I sit here eating the leftover soup for the 3rd day, I had to comment.  This soup was wonderful!  The only thing I did different was I cooked the barley and garbanzo beans (I bought a bag of beans rather than the can) separately because I wanted to make sure the soup wasn't too thick.  I added them and cooked it all together for about 10 minutes.  It was delicious!

This soup is perfect for meatless Fridays during Lent - nutritious and easy on the budget, too. I don't like curry dishes, so I was a little wary of putting it into the soup, but the curry powder gave the soup a really nice, full flavor. I did leave out the sugar and used three cloves of garlic and kidney beans instead. Thank you for sharing!

This was great!  It was my first attempt at cooking a meal with barley in it.  I used pearl barley, not realizing it was a less healthy and more processed variety.  I will try pot or scotch barley next time to increase the nutritional value. I am on the weightwatchers core plan and it fit in perfectly without the sugar.  I used chicken broth and added chicken to it.  I also added some salt and realized that the broth has added salt and will omit it next time.  I also omitted the sugar and parsley.  It tasted really great and my 3 year old even ate it:)

This is an excellent soup!  It has been put into my favorite recipe file!  I have made it several times and it is wonderful, especially on cold winter nights!  I became a vegetarian only last year, and you don't miss the meat at all in this soup!  I have followed this recipe as written (with one exception that I usually add some mushrooms).  Last night, however, I tried one reviewers' tip to use 1 tbsp. red wine vinegar to replace the 1 tbsp. Worchestershire sauce.  It came out too vinegar-tasting, and I had to add another quart of broth just so it was edible!  I wanted to replace the Worchestershire sauce as it contains high fructose corn syrup and anchovies--which do not correspond with my diet--however, the vinegar was the wrong thing to put in the soup.  I think next time I will make it without the vinegar or the Worchestershire sauce and see how it works out.  BTW, to make it taste less tomatoey, use stewed tomatoes instead of crushed tomatoes.

This soup is absolutely incredible! It has great flavor for such few spices and herbs. The only thing I did differently was reduce the amount of barley by half because I like my soup to be thin. Also, next time I make this I plan to simmer for only 60 minutes because I thought the barley was too mushy.

This soup is the absolute greatest!  I hate making my own vegetable broth (seems wasteful to me), so I used 2 cups of Campbells prepared broth, and 2 1/2 vegetable boullion cubes mixed into 6 cups of water.  The result is very flavourful, but make sure to omit the salt if you're using boullion cubes!

Wonderful, thick and hearty. Small changes I made:  used 3 large cloves garlic intead of powdered, used chicken broth so decreased the salt called for, and didn't have any celery or zucchini, so tossed in a bag of fresh baby spinach leaves and a cup or so of frozen corn. Great flexibility, awesome flavor and texture.

I have made this recipe several times, always a winner!  I like to add the thinly sliced squash after the soup is done cooking.  When it's cool enough to put in the fridge, the squash is done to perfection.  I hate mushy squash!  I like to use zucchini and summer squash for extra color.

Mmmmm yummy delicious soup!  I made this today and seasoned exactly as the recipe stated.  As far as the additives, I put in the onion, carrot, celery & bareley. I didn't have zucchini but instead used some left over green bell pepper that I had on hand.  I used spicy petite diced tomatoes and a six bean mixture as opposed to just garbanzo beans- turned out excellent!  A nice hearty warm flavor to compliment and very cold and snowy day!  I will definitely make this soup in the future!

Wow! This soup was so delicious! I'm sorry, I did use chicken broth instead of vegetable because, I didn't have vegetable but, I feel like I could almost mix this combination of ingredients with water and, it would be good! I actually used measuring spoons while making this and, the combination of the herbs and spices are just AWESOME!

We are trying to eat healthy at my house, and this certainly fits the bill. My husband thinks a meal MUST include meat, but this soup has so much flavor, he didn't miss the meat. We both loved it! I left out the sugar and added the zucchini the last 10 minutes so it would retain a little crunch. I made no other changes. Will definitely keep this recipe handy.

Followed the recipe as written. Was a very good and hearty vegetable soup. I only gave it 4 stars because it lacked a "wow" factor. It was good, but not particularly memorable.

Thought this was great! After reading all the variations, I made it w 4 cups veg broth, 2 cups water and added 28 oz can diced tomatoes. I used 1/3 C. Barley (the long cooking kind) used cannelli beans instead of garbanzo. I eliminated zucchini and added 1 - 1 1/2 c. fresh chopped green beans after 1 hr of simmering. The added apprx 6 oz chopped mushrooms for the last 20 mins and a bunch of fresh baby spinach for the last 10 (5 would have been better). Spice wise, I eliminated sugar and added a teaspoon of dried basil and dried oragano and a lg pinch of cayenne pepper. Delicious!

OUTSTANDING!  Here is what I did differently:  I added 4 quarts veggie broth, chili paste instead of curry, fresh garlic instead of powder, small kidney beans instead of garbanzo, added mushrooms, a can of green beans and 1/3 package frozen chopped spinach.  Finally I added fresh chopped Italian parsley instead of dried.  Truly one of the best soups I have ever made, thank you for the recipe!

I used chicken stock and fresh mushrooms. It was very tasty. It must be the spices since I've made barley soup before and it wasn't this good.

We have enjoyed this soup several times so we obviously like it very much, but it's missing something that I can't quite put my finger on. I'm not very good at experimenting so I keep making it the same way, and we like it every time, but there's just something missing ...

Yum! Loved it. I sauteed the veg in olive oil first. Also, I added one diced portobello cap to the stew. I used 6 cups of water and 1/2 cup of barley which was the perfect consistency. Very, very yummy.

We loved this! I used beef broth because that's what I had on hand, omitted the carrots because I don't like cooked carrots, and added 5 cloves of minced fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder. It was excellent and a definite repeat.

Very good for a simple soup. Flexible recipe - throw whatever leftover veggies you need to use. Add quick-cooking vegetables near the very end to retain color. This turns into monochrome mush if overcooked.

Loved this soup! Used 3 cloves fresh garlic, softened the onion and garlic in a little olive oil. Used 10 cups of water and some vegetable broth mix. Used smoked paprika and skipped the Worcestershire sauce. Wonderful! Will make it again and again. Sooo good. Thank you!

Very flavorful soup!  The curry flavor was just enough to spice it up, but not overpower the veggies.  I also used chicken broth instead of veggie as some others.  I omitted zucchini & onion and added fresh mushrooms.  I will make this again - simply excellent & so easy!

Used 3/4 cup barley, 1/2 cup small pasta, leek instead of onion, a 28 oz can diced tomatoes for extra liquid, 2 fresh garlic cloves instead of powder, chili powder instead of curry and paprika. Added thyme, crushed red pepper, and turnip. This recipe is very adaptable. Yummy.

I served this to a crowd and everyone loved it (well except one person who doesn't like curry). I followed the recipe except I added extra broth because I wanted a thinner soup. It was awesome.

Excellent soup.  Must try!!!!  Have made it twice in two weeks.  I made few changes.  First, I sauteed the carrots, onions and celery, then added other ingredients.  Used half vegetable broth and half chicken broth.  Also, used white beans in place of garbanzo beans.

This was very good. I too used 3/4c barley and replaced the garbanzo beans for navy. I found it a bit salty but that might be due to using less barley. Spinach would be a good addition to this soup. Thanks for sharing, will make again.

This worked best with 3 quarts of broth, and 3/4 c barley. That way it was more of a soup, as opposed to the first time I made it, which was more a stew. Due to personal taste, we omitted the tomatoes, curry, and paprika. We also used beef broth since we didn't have vegetable. Good stuff, thank you!

Very good!  My comments mimic everyone else's except I used Navy white beans instead of garbanzo and it was a perfect match.  Also had no paprika so used cumin instead, gave it a little heat but mixed well with the curry.  Would make again, could see cooked chicken added in the last half hour.

This is excellent.  I made this for lunch for 50 people.Very Easy. I sauteed the onions, carrots and celery until the vegetables are limp before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I followed the previous ratings by not using all the barley asked for in the recipe, I only used 4 cups instead of 6-1/2.  Added 2 extra 14oz cans of vegetable broth.  Everybody raved about it.

I didn't change much about this recipe - I omitted the Worcestershire, because I didn't have any, and I substituted two packages of Knorr Spring vegetable soup mix and water for the vegetable broth. This makes an excellent thick soup that is very filling and delicious. Even my meat-loving husband enjoyed this soup; he took it to work and had some for lunch and for dinner yesterday. This one's a definite keeper.

I like all the ingredients in this recipe, but was very disappointed in the outcome.  The amount of curry plus the black pepper made it too spicy for us.  I ate it both when first made and the next day and there didn't seem to be an appreciable difference.  My husband didn't care for it at all.  I hardly ever waste food, but I had to throw the remainder out, as neither of us could face eating it again.

Wonderful soup!  I would have never thought to add curry powder to a vegetable soup.  Did you know curry powder, specifically, the spice curcumin helps prevent Alzheimer's disease?  I will be making this delicious soup often for my mother.  I also precooked the barley, which left lots of broth for my soup loving daughter.

Delicious soup!  I don't usually follow recipes for soup but I'm glad I did, for the most part, on this one.  The curry added a wonderful layer of flavor, not at all overpowering.  I did add some extra vegetables (sliced mushrooms and a little swiss chard) and I sauteed the vegetables in the bottom of my soup pot before adding the barley and broth (I used 2 quarts of water and 4 chicken cubes).  I left out the sugar and used a little less than a cup of barley, probably about 7/8 cup.  I had a great ratio of broth to vegetables, so I think that little bit less barley took care of the "too thick" problem.  Lastly, I made sure to simmer with the pot covered so that I didn't lose the liquid.  The recipe made plenty!  I froze about four cups worth and we've had it for lunch two days in a row.  There's still a bit left for tomorrow.  Thanks!

This soup was great.  After reading the reviews, I decided to cook the barley separately and add it before serving.  This made a HUGE difference, and the barley still managed to absorb some of the liquid.  I would recommend this idea, though.  It made the soup a bit looser.  The soup was a big hit!

This was really delicious.  I omitted the curry and zucchini because I didn't have them.  I used dry beans and a home canned quart of tomatoes and did it in a slow cooker on high for 4 hours.

my husband is vegeatarian and I'm not, so finding recipes we'll both enjoy can be difficult. This was an amazing soup, it had full flavor and an intensely rich aroma. Not being a big fan of curry, I added another indan spice in place of it called gharam masala. This is a decadent soup, sure to please both palates!

With a few additions this was colorful and tasty!  Instead of garbonzo beans I used black beans (drained), one can of corn (drained), cubed potatoes (cooked then added to pot at the end), and one chopped green pepper.  I still wanted a soup-like consistency so I thinned the soup by cooking the barley before adding it to my pot and used three quarts of vegatable broth (also tamed the spicyness of the soup to my liking).

I made this recipe using suggestions listed by other raters.  Thank you for adding your "touches".  I thought the soup was great.  I did use chicken broth instead of vegetable.

I agree with those who said that the soup was too thick.  I had to add 3 extra cups of broth to make sure it didn't burn while cooking!  I also think that a little less barley might make it a tad better.  When I reheated the leftovers, I added corn and peas and I liked it better.

Really hearty, comforting, and nutritious. I used celery seed instead of celery to get some of that flavor. I also didn't have zucchini, so I skipped it. I used both garbanzo beans and dark read kidney beans. I followed every thing else. It is great for a crisp winter day. It made a lot, so I think I am going to freeze most of it. Also, it is thick, but you can always add more stock (I used beef stock). Delicious--great seasoning.

Excellent soup. I made this totally vegetarian by using vegetarian Worcestershire sauce, no anchovies. I will probably omit the sugar next time as I don't think it needs it. Used about 1 clove of chopped garlic and omitted the garlic powder. Used tomatoes that had garlic in the juice too. Omitted the  black pepper when cooking as I read a previous review that mentioned something about the pepper, added it to taste at the table. Omitted the parsely since I didn't have it on hand. Simmer it for about 30-45 minutes until the veggies were tender but not mushy. I'll be making this again.

Good soup and easy to make.  I didn't have the zucchini, so I used 1/2 bag of corn instead.  I also used white beans in place of the garbanzo.  Soup did have a little zip to it with the pepper and curry, but I liked it that way.  Good soup for a cold day.

Wow, this was a really tasty soup!  I was surprised - somehow the combination of a bit of curry powder and paprika gave it such a nice flavor. I do admit that I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, but I bet it would be great either way!

My family loved this soup.  I reduced the barley by half because I didn't want the soup as thick as it is in the picture.  This was the perfect amount, in my opinion.  I served it over mozzarella balls (pearl size) and let the hot soup make them all melty.  My daughter and husband loved this addition.  I served it with meat pies from our local Middle Eastern bakery.  It was the perfect meal.

This soup is so delicious! Thank you to the person who suggested adding spinach and mushrooms.  Somehow these spices come together and this soup has a lot of rich flavor. I added another cup of broth, about a cup of frozen spinach, and in the last half hour I added a small package of sliced mushrooms. Comfort food.

This is an excellent vegetarian soup! I just recently started trying to cut out meat from my diet, but love soup. This is thick, hearty, and excellent - not even missing the meat. I'm on a low sodium diet, so I used 2 q unsalted chicken broth, low sodium garbonzo beans and rinsed them thouroghly, no salt added diced tomato, no salt peas instead of the zuchini, 3/4 cup quick cook barley, and everything else as directed. Super yummy! Will be making again for sure.

This soup came together quickly with the ingredients I already had in my pantry. I found it to be a very substantial soup. It will be great for fall and winter when I need something to warm me on a cold night. I used vegetable broth, an extra carrot and two zuchinnis because I like a thick soup. I may use some extra onion next time. The seasonings work great in this. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

The best barley soup ever!  Loved the little bit of curry flavor, all the healthy vitamins and minerals from the variety of vegetables and the great texture of the garbanzo beans and the barley.  A keeper of a recipe!

This is simple, filling and healthy! I was out of a lot so....  substituted a can of white beans for the chick peas, beef broth instead of veggie, frozen Italian green beans in place of the zucchini.  It is the kind of recipe that can be made with substitutions that you have in the pantry or fridge and it still tastes great!  I also added some red pepper flakes to give it a little bite.  I used no sugar at all!!!  Great veggie meal!!!  Also, might add that I read and followed the advice about the pepper and extra garlic!

This is quite good.   I followed the recipe except I added some turnips that I needed to use up. I noticed a few reviewers commenting that this is a vegetarian recipe.  It is not.  Worcestershire sauce is not vegetarian unless you specifically seek out a vegetarian version at a specialty/health food store.  Please do not make this with Lou & Perrins (or chicken/beef broth) and serve to your vegetarian friends.

Loved it! Made it exactly as directed and it was perfect! I may substitute the chickpeas (garbanzo beans) for something else next time but that's just personal preference. You can play around with the veggie content on this to suit personal preference but the STOCK is to die for.  First time I've ever used curry in my kitchen and I fell in love! I also used pearl barley and had no issue with it being too thick at serving. Thanks for sharing this recipe, I'll be using it often.

This tastes fantastic and is easy to make. The recipe doesn't skimp on the spices so it's very flavorful right off the stove, unlike some soups which require a day or so for the full flavor to permeate the broth. I wouldn't call this a soup, though -- more like a barley stew. You would need to add about three times the liquid to make it a soup proper. If not, it is a good idea to watch it and make sure it doesn't dry out while it is simmering, and add more water or broth if necessary (I used about 1 1/2 times broth than called for; I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable). I added sundried tomatoes and used fresh parsley which worked well. I will definitely make this again. Thanks!

WARNING!! THIS IS NOT VEGETARIAN.  Unless you use vegetarian worstershire sauce, which we do.  This was fantastic.  So hearty and so much flavor.  I did have to add 4 more cups of broth and it was still stew consistensy.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  This' a keeper for our family.

My family loved this recipe!! It was by far the most delicious vegetarian soup I have ever made! The only tip I followed from all the reviews I read was to put the zucchini in towards the end of cooking to keep a firm texture. Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing. We will be using this recipe as a staple in our house from now on! Thanks Beaker!!

*Update: still one of my favorite recipes! I actually lost the recipe card and came back to get it. Just wanted anyone curious to know that this recipe stands the test of time!!!

I do love this recipe, but I've noticed a couple of reviewers mentioned serving it to vegetarian friends.  Most worcestershire sauce is made from fermented anchovies, including Lea and Perrins, which is not vegetarian friendly!  Just a word of caution, though, and it's easy enough to leave out.

Very good soup.  I threw all of the ingredients into the crock pot and just let it simmer for several hours warming the house with it's fragrance on a cold day.

Made it today and it is totally awesome!  The only changes I made was to use chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and I cut the amount of barley down to 3/4 cup and I used 1/2 cup frozen mixed veggies for the zucchini.  Thank you for posting this delicious and healthy soup recipe!

Have been making this for years and love it.  I have made a couple of changes.  To bring out the taste of the barley, I saute it in a bit of olive oil (3-4min)  before adding the liquid.  I use 1 qt. water and 1 qt. vegetable broth.  I also add a can of black beans as my family likes them.  Near the end of the cook time, I saute a package of baby bella mushrooms in butter and add them to the soup with about 10min remaining.  This is my favorite winter soup recipe!

This is the best vegetable soup I have ever had. Not a boring soup. The elderly lady next door raved about it too! The curry and paprika add the kick it needs. It won't get too thick if you slowly cook it with the lid securely on the pot, that or add a bit more vegetable broth!

Good basic recipe that's healthy. My 4 year old and my friend's 2 year old ate it up. Love that it's so easy to make. I soaked the barley for a few hours to speed up the cooking time. Only took 30 mins of simmering.

This was fantastic! I doubled the ingredients, added parsnips, threw in spinach about 15 minutes prior to finish and used about 2/3 veg broth & 1/3 beef broth. I did add 2 lbs of stew beef, as I knew DH & DS would want meat in it! Phenomenal!

Very good! I halved the recipe and subbed a couple things for availability, low sodium diet and personal preference- 3 cloves finely chopped marinated garlic for the powder; halved the barley again (1/4 cup); skipped the salt and sugar; used hot curry and smoked paprika; frozen organic mixed vegs instead of fresh carrot and zucchini; and a couple of finely chopped sundried tomatoes that had soaked in hot water for a few minutes instead of 1/2 can tomatoes. I sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil with a cup of thick-sliced baby portabellas, added 1/4 cup white wine and cooked it down a bit then added a quart of low sodium organic broth, the seasonings, low sodium chick peas and continued as directed. The barley took about an hour to cook so I threw in the frozen vegs about 10 minutes before it was done. The seasonings worked perfectly and the Worcestershire and mushrooms gave it a nice 'beefy' taste. The soup stayed soupy and never got too thick. Carnivore hubby loved it and complimented me several times. Neither of us missed the salt! Great vegan meal too, but be sure to sub liquid smoke or vegan Worcestershire for regular- it contains anchovies.

I make this in my crock pot. This is a great recipe. I have made it with 1 cup of dried lentils in place of the garbanzo beans and that works nicely.

YUMMY! I followed this very closely, omitting the celery (personal pref) and I realized I had barely 1/2 tsp of curry and no paprika, so I had to omit that. But, its pretty tasty despite that. Can't wait to add the paprika and curry when I make this again!

I substituted some ingredients by using my own beef broth, mixed dried beans/lentils and fresh organic corn.  I did use primarily organic ingredients and simmered the soup in the crock pot overnight. It turned out great.  Will be making this again.

This is my favorite vegetable soup! I usually substitute quinoa for the barley and pinto or black beans for the garbanzo beans. I really don't think you can mess the recipe up by adding or taking away anything! That's what I mostly love about it.

Excellent recipe!  I used 1/2 cup of barley and it came out perfect. This is a hearty soup with a great flavor, my husband prefers beef barley but he was halfway through the bowl before he noticed there was no meat.  I know we will make this often!

Ok, but has an odd taste that I could not pinpoint.  And it does need more liquid or it resembles a goulash rather than a soup.

I made this exactly to the recipe and it was great.  Hearty and delicious.  And very easy too. It's a little on the peppery side, which I love.  But if you don't like too much heat you might want to cut back on the pepper.  Otherwise I think anyone would enjoy this.

I'm giving this 4 stars (but wanted to give it 4.5).  The only reason is that I used the amount of water stated in the recipe and my soup came out brothy & not think like the picture.  I even used a bit more barley than called for.  Otherwise, this soup is very very good & makes a huge amount--I've been eating it for lunch every day this week.  I'm keeping this.

I made this to freeze, so that I would have quick healthy meals after our baby comes in the next few weeks.    I added extra broth, since it said it was thick and I wanted a thinner soup.  I also had an extra zucchini hanging around, so I added that as well.  Something about it tasted SO familiar, and it was calling for more tomato flavor, so I added what was left of a can of tomato paste I had in the fridge.  So really what I'm trying to say is, this recipe is super adaptable.    With the additions I made, I was able to freeze 10 servings.    I'm sure its been said somewhere with so many reviews, but if you're looking for a vegetarian soup, Worcestershire sauce isn't vegetarian.  But its pretty easy to find vegetarian versions (which is what I used).  And if you can't find it, don't let it stop you from making this, it'll be fine without it!

Outstanding!  So easy and so yummy.  Perfect for a cold night and perfect for the diet.  Even my husband gave it a thumbs up (although I had to add chicken for him).  Thanks for a great recipe!!

We made this yesterday and followed the directions almost exactly - just adding a bit more curry powder and Worcestershire sauce. Both my husband and I thought it was very good but could use a little more heat (we like our food spicy) so we added a bit of tabasco and it was perfect!

This is a great recipe which can be adjusted pretty easily to what veggies you have in your house! I do agree however that the pepper is FAR TOO MUCH. It can ruin it with an awful bite. I did add extra broth and did a 50/50 of vegetable and beef. Used real roasted garlic, didn't really notice the worchestershire or sugar as taste goes but I put it in there. I also love carrots so I put extra in as well as parsnips. no zucchini so I added a bit of spinach. This was great today for our first measurable snow here in 288 days! My tummy is happy!

Delightful soup.  Used beef broth (at the request of my Husband).  Did not have zucchini, so I added fresh spinich.  Sauteed onions, fresh garlic, celery at the beginning in olive oil. After one hour of simmering, I added two diced potatoes and cooked an additional 20 minutes.  The flavors come together nicely.

Great soup.  I added 1 lb of beef stew meat that I cooked in a Tbl of oil.  Also substituted beef broth for the vegetable broth.  And near the middle of the simmer time I added some chopped kale ... wonderful.

Ok Beaker here is a carnivore's review or your soup - in a word "WOW". Thank you for a deeply satisfying and healthy meal. I followed your recipe with the following changes due to ingredients I had on hand. 1) I added a can of white beans as I didn't have garbonzo in the pantry 2) 1/2 teaspoon curry powder because I wasn't sure how the family would like it. Well, let me just say the soup made the house smell heavenly and my 18 month old and 3 year old ate as much as mom and dad! Heated up the next day it was really good - and just by chance - I got a really bad head cold. This was better that Chicken Noodle for sure:) I will be making this for my family many times in the future, and even for company! This soup is THAT Good! This recipe is a keeper!

Very good soup!  I think I would cut the worcestershire in half next time - it's a bit strong.  Also I definitely agree with a previous reviewer that slow-cooking barley (not instant/ fast-cooking) would be better.  Given these minor things,  very yummy soup recipe!

Very good, but overpowering veggie taste.  Next time I will make with beef base instead of vegetable.  Switched beans to navy and it worked great.

I used the broth from a crockpot roast as the base for this soup. Wonderfully delicious stuff and you can sure play w the ingredients. More of this, less of that, and it still comes out good.

This was so good, BUT, two days down the road and the leftover barley in the soup will blow up, become gross, and be very nasty.

Hmm..I did not like this soup at all. It's basically boiled barley in a tomate-esque broth with a splash of steak sauce? Weird.   I would suggest sauteing some aromatics before dumping all of your ingredients into the pot, like rosemary and garlic (or something like that).  This tasted like the types of soups my dad would make me eat during lent! Bleh! In fact this ought to be re-named "Lenten Soup" because that's exactly what it is.

Good basic recipe with a different slant on taste.  A teaspoon of curry powder is way too much as it was overpowering.  Definitely too much barley too cause it was more like vegetables with a little broth than a soup/stew.  If I made it again I would sprinkle just a bit of curry and cut the barley to 1/2 cup (or add more broth).

Beyond delicious! I ommitted the sugar and  Worcestershire sauce and used fresh garlic (3 cloves), added some olive oil, two potatoes (diced large) and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  For the vegetable stock, I used Starr bouillon (you can find it in any Italian market/grocery).  I'll make this again and again.  Thanks Beaker!

I only have canned beans so instead I opted for non-canned barely and lentils. Was very good, upped the Worcestershire and spice to taste. Mushrooms sound like a great idea too!

OK, I'll be the first to admit, I've always considered vegetable soup to be sort of like the anemic,plain-jane cousin of more "dinner-worthy" soups such as a full-bodied minestrone, corn chowder or cream of potato. However, this soup is phenominal!  I made it yesterday evening for tonight's dinner, and when I went to taste-test it, I couldn't stop eating it!  It has a very deep, rich taste to it, maybe helped along by that teensy bit of Worcestershire in it. Don't change a thing in this recipe---you don't need to;  other than, as others suggest, possibly cut down on the amount of barley (I used only 3/4 cup).  The flavoring is PERFECT! I will definitely be making this often.

This recipe is great!  I've made a few alterations, which makes it even tastier.  I use chicken broth instead of vegetable, and I also make it a bit spicier by adding white pepper, red pepper flakes, and garlic salt. For vegetables, I use cannelloni beans instead of garbanzo and just also throw in a bag of mixed frozen veggies.  I also add 2 bags of frozen shrimp for protein, and it’s delicious.  Try it this way- you might like it!

It is a very good, healthy soup.  I did everything as per the instructions, my only change would be to add the curry powder, paprika powder, etc, about 3/4 of the way through cooking.  I found the flavour a little bland. I ended up adding a touch more of the spices at the end.  Otherwise, very good.  Will make again.

Delicious...I have served this even to sceptical carnivores and been successful. I think it is the curry and paprika that make this recipe and I always add a little more since I like it spicy! It is very thick so keep an eye on it while it cooks and add more water if you want to thin it out. There is more than enough flavor to take the extra water though!

This is a wonderful soup, easy to make and very filling. I made it exactly as per
instructions, but it was too curry tasting, to me. I made it again leaving out the
curry, and substituted oregano for the parsley and it was perfect. Made a loaf
of roasted garlic bread to go with it and it was heaven! 5 out of 5 stars.

My family LOVED this recipe. It is a little rare to have everyone excited about the same meal but this recipe accomplished that!I added a leek and only put in about 2/3c barley. I also used fresh garlic minced instead of the powder. This recipe has already become a regular dish in our home. I am senitive to hot spices so I only used 1/2 the amount of curry. This was still really warm. The family liked it like this but I may used just a little less next time. This is definately worth a try!!

We used this recipe to make "Stone Soup" for our children's literature group. It was a hit with kids and adults, alike. I had to sub chicken broth for veg and used pasta (cooked, added at serving) instead of barley, both due to supply in the pantry. The only other alteration was one large quartz stone, of course! 
It's a great recipe! Thanks alot!

This was very good! It is nice and healthy. I have been looking for new things to take to work for lunch so I don't eat junk, and this one is a winner. I have leftovers from tonight's dinner packed up for my lunch tomorrow. The only thing I did differently was saute the onions first, and then added quite a bit of fresh garlic. I made some cornbread to go with it, and it was a perfect combo.

Beaker, this was delicious soup!! Changes: 1/2 c. of barley instead of 1 c. I added a squirt catsup (there are a lot of good spices in catsup!! Added some oregano and a little beef bouillon. Didn't have any curry but it turned out very well.  This is a soup recipe that is as good as any soup with meat in it. I will be making it often.

I leave out the Worcestershire sauce and substitute red kidney beans for the garbanzo (started out as a mistake, but I decided I like them better in the end). It is a meal in itself and it's both very tasty and filling.

This recipe was easy and delicious. I used soy sauce as a substitute for the Worcester sauce.

Gosh, this is just the best soup ever!  I only came across it because I was looking for healthy and low-calorie recipes - I wasn't expecting it to be this good!  And it is very filling, too!  The one change I made was to add some chopped up green bell pepper and whole mushrooms.  They made a really great addition to the soup, especially the mushrooms, which really soak up the flavour of the rest of the soup.  Also, instead of using canned chickpeas I just soaked some dry ones overnight and then cooked them with the barley.  Fantastic!  And couldn't be easier!

I love this soup!  I don't like curry, so I omitted it.  I added double the amount of tomatoes and chickpeas, and the soup thickened up to almost a stew consistency.  Great with a little bit of grated parmesan cheese on top.

Perfect for the winter!  I bought (2) packages of KNORR brand VEGETABLE RECIPE MIX and added 2 quarts water for the broth.(each box costs $1.89 and makes 1 quart...much cheaper than the organic @$3.49 per quart)  Very wonderful flavored broth w/bits of dehydrated veggies and can be found in the dry soup mix area of grocery stores.  Also added 2 cans of beef broth.  2/3 cup of barley from hubby's family farm and added 1/3 cup masoor dal(split red lentils)  All the other ingredients I kept the same measurements and then tweaked to particular taste but used a handful of chopped fresh parsley. Added 1 tsp. more garlic powder and 1 clove crushed, and 1 tsp. tunisian harissa pepper powder for zing.  Lovely flavors that blend nicely and after it sits for a while it tastes even better.  I would definitely not add the full cup of barley if only using 2 quarts.  This makes a nice potful and plan on freezing some for whenever I don't feel like cooking.  A snap to make and an opportunity to clean out the veggie crisper.  This is Valentine's cookie bake day so didn't want to fuss but yet have a wonderful meal.  Going to have w/some baguettes and it will be perfect.

A new family favorite!!! This tastes just like the appetizer soup at my favorite Italian restaurant, not I can make it at home. I added a couple beef boullion cubes for flavor and sprinkled with parmesan. Served with garilc bread... yummy.

I love to cook, but I normally do not bake or make soups. Well after making this soup, I am on my way. I received raves for my first soup presentation. Next time, I may add a little more spice/veggies depending on the crowd on hand. Good recipe Beaker!

I've never had barley before, so I really didn't know what to expect.  Yum!  My only change was to use a green pepper in lieu of the zucchini, add minced garlic, and saute the veggies (except tomatoes) before adding the other ingredients.  A keeper!

This was a great soup. I think I had just as much fun cooking it as I did eating it -- the house was filled with incredible aromas! 

It is quite filling...totally satisfying, and wonderully nutritious!

I didn't use broth -- just water, as I was concerned about sodium content. I also used fresh garlic. Try sauteing vegetables to soften prior to adding water. I found that this helps to make the soup a bit more brothy, as it is quite thick. For a bit of kick, add some grated ginger - it definitely added something interesting to the mix.

Excellent recipe! I will be making this again. Thanks!

Broth tasted great.  We added red potatoes and a frozen mixed vegetable pack.  We omitted the garbanzo beans.  We also sauteed garlic and onion instead of the garlic powder.

Great for a cold winter's day!

I followed all directions - except for- I had a half bag of stir fry veggies that I added.  I am a soup snob, but this was soooo good!  I also used one can of beef broth, and a 2/3 quater package of LeGout Au Jus mix.  Unbeatable recipe.  The curry scared me, but I am sooo happy I included it.  Next time I have some Prime Rib leftovers, I will definetely add them.  Thank you so much Beaker1.  I love great vegetarian soups, and the choice to add meat.

I will definitely make this again.  I did do minor changes, in accordance with our vegetarian preferences.  I made my broth from Better Than Bouillon Beef; vegetable broth is too sour for us.  I eliminated the sugar and salt.  We don't really care for garbanzo beans, so I used red kidney instead.  I have now decided that if I can use barley instead of pasta in a soup recipe, I will.  The pasta gets too mushy.

Very good recipe!  I made a couple of changes to my own personal preferences, but that was really only on the seasonings.  Omitted the sugar, used Bragg's Liquid Aminos instead of Wuerstishestishirestisheeshtishire sauce to go in a more vegan direction, no zucchini available, accidentally used a can of diced tomatoes peppers and onions instead of just tomatoes, and used about double the amount of curry powder.  All in all, this had a wonderful flavor to it.  Very minor amount of spice to go with the curry, but my spice averse family members still professed to love the flavor, and it wasn't too much for any of them.  Still, the extra curry spice didn't overwhelm the dish, and I'll definitely be doing it again.

I have just made this and it is delicious!  I did a few things differently.  I omitted the sugar.  I started the broth (I use Imagine NO chicken broth)and hulled barley boiling while I sautéed the onion, carrot and celery.  I added those veggies in after the onions were clear.  I also used 3 fresh minced garlic cloves and about 2-3 T fresh chopped parsley.  I put the minced garlic and dry spices in a dry frying pan on med-low to heat them up and bring out the flavors before adding in.  I added the parsley, tomato and some chopped leeks (I happen to have some lying around) after the soup had cooked for 30 minutes.  
It was the perfect ratio of barley to broth.  I'll bet that people who think it's too thick have used pearled barley instead of regular hulled barley.  Pearled barley absorbs more water and also leaks out carbs that thicken the soup. 
Thanks for a wonderful, healthy recipe.

This was a fantastic recipe.  I used the exact ingredients in the exact proportions, but (please don't yell at me for the variation) I sauteed the onion, celery and carrots before adding everything else, since I do not care for the taste of the onion otherwise.  Thank you for sharing!

I have made this twice and both times it is fabulous! The second time I used yellow squash instead of zucchini because I didn't have a zucchini it worked out fine. Both times I did not use curry because no matter how little I use my husband can tell and he hates curry... Weird guy

Very good as is, or as close to as is that I could get with what I had on hand.I did not have zucchini so I substituted fresh mushrooms. I used the basic vegetable stock recipe from this site to start with. Everything came together very nicely even though I didn't have fresh herbs. Great flavor and added a dash of red wine vinegar at the end with some fresh grated Parmesan on top. I also actually only had coarse ground pepper, but did not ruin it at all. Thanks for the recipe, definitely would make again.

We were not impressed with this soup.  I did use 1 quart veg and 1 quart beef stock for flavor but it did not help.  There is no real flavor maybe more beef stock or actual beef to enrich the flavor would work.  Lot of chopping for nothing.

This was such a delicious recipe!  With the temperature at 2* and the wind chill making it feel even worse here in NY, this was the perfect dish to make last night. I kept it vegan and subbed red wine vinegar for the Worcestershire sauce as another reviewer suggested. I had diced tomatoes with jalapeño in the pantry, so I used that.  It was wonderful and got rave reviews!  So simple to make and a wonderful, warming dish. Don't forget the crusty bread and a glass of red wine!

We all loved it! I didn't have any meat in the house and noticed I had lots of garbanzo beans. I plugged "garbanzo beans" into the search ingredient feature of Allrecipes.com and this was one of my choices! I didn't have vegetable broth, garlic powder or canned diced tomatoes, so I used chicken bullion, 1garlic clove crushed and 2 large tomatoes diced. There are lots of spices in this recipe which I love! Other than my notations, I followed it exactly!

Okay... Try this again.  The soup is amazing. I am transitioning to a plant based diet. I still have a lot of chicken and beef broth in my pantry, so I used one quart of chicken broth and one quart of home made veggie broth. I misread my spice, and dumped in some cumin instead of curry powder. I decided to go ahead and still add the curry. I used fresh parsley instead of dried. I also used cannoli beans, because that's what I had on hand. It was delicious. My family of carnivores raved and went back for seconds!

The curry and pepper give this soup a lot of flavor. It's hearty without being heavy. Great with crusty bread. Reduce the barley or increase the broth if you plan to have leftovers as the barley sucks up a lot of liquid.

Delicious! Great as a vegetarian soup, and with the leftovers I added some coconut milk and shrimp broiled with butter and smokey paprika.

Very hearty and healthy soup, perfect for a cold evening. My family are meat lovers so I have added diced rotisserie chicken in my first two batches, most recently, diced leftover Thanksgiving turkey. It gets eaten quickly!! I have used cannellini beans rather than garbanzo and use no salt added diced tomatoes and low sodium fat free chicken broth. I also add a cup of diced fresh mushrooms. I LOVE soup but find the store bought ready made soups too high in sodium.  Definitely saved this keeper to my recipe box!

Absolutely the best. He asks once a week when we are having it again even in the hottest part of summer. I didn't alter the recipe the first time and even now about the only change is to experiment with the amount of curry powder.

This has been a staple of ours for several years now. Making it exactly as the recipe states, it's delicious! However, it's also very forgiving if I use the veggies that I have on hand or fresh from the garden. Our young kids love this, too, so added bonus that it's healthy.

This was pretty good for a vegetable and barley soup. It was nice and hearty. It does have an ever so slight heat kick to it and the undertone of the curry can be tasted. I would not make if curry is not spice that is liked. I loved how thick it was and it used what I had in the house, for the most part. I didn't have celery, so I had to leave that out. When I went to add the diced tomatoes, I realized that I only had canned stewed. It had celery in it, so it ended up working perfect. I added the stewed tomatoes and half of a large fresh tomato to the blender to puree it for a few seconds on low. It cut through some of the green pepper taste and lack of tomatoes in the can. I had cooked some dried chickpeas, the day before, in some onion and carrots and just used those. For the broth I used 2 cups of organic store bought low-sodium vegetable broth and then for the rest of the 6 cups of water I added 3 no-sodium vegetable bouillion cubes. Using a low or no-sodium broth alternative probably cut back on the 39% sodium. I did not find the soup too salty at all. My barley was also the quick type, and it did not seem to be a problem. Adding everything to a pot, at once, I found very handy. I cooked it 1 hour and 20 minutes, stirring 2-3 times. I removed the lid the last ten minutes and turned off the heat. I garnished with a little parmesan cheese. Edit note: After it was just made, I have a ton, and the leftovers are not getting eaten. I am highly dependent on the leftovers.

In general, I like this recipe - the ingredients, the texture,and the fact that it is healthy. But it needs more flavor - some herbs and spices. I think if I got the right mix of herbs + spices this would be a 5 star recipe.

I have never liked vegetable soup but had some barley and nothing for dinner, so I decided to try this.  What a pleasant surprise!  This is hearty and very delicious.  Definitely the best veggie soup I have ever had and love the barley in it.

Wow, this recipe is AMAZING, and I am very picky eater especially when it comes to grains.I did make slight changes, I half the dose for pearl barley, added 4 small potatoes and did not add tomatoes. I cooked it in slow cooker on high for 4 hours, it was YUMMY

I made this earlier in the week during a tummy bug recovery.  This stuff is AMAZING!  The only changes I made was to use 1/2 veggie broth and 1/2 tomato juice (because of what I had on hand); briefly saute together the onions, carrots, and celery before adding the rest; and I used quick barley and added it about 30 minutes before serving.  The curry powder made this.  The flavor was out of this world!  My husband ate FIVE bowls, FIVE!  And he's usually the firs to ask where the meat is.  He didn't even miss it!

1.7.13 - This was a very good and easy soup.

I discovered too late that I only had one carrot and no zucchini (which I don't like anyway), so I increased the celery.  Per the advice of other reviewers, I added two additional cups of broth.  I used the full amount of barley.

This is best with additional freshly ground pepper added to each bowl.  Due to a slightly off taste, I may replace the garlic powder with fresh garlic next time.

UPDATE:  This is even better as leftovers.

This is delicious. I have made this several times already. After the first time, it was a touch too peppery for my taste, so I started making it with less pepper. I also started making only half the recipe, as the full recipe makes ALOT of soup for two people.

This was a hit with everyone in my house. I loved it for several reasons:
a) Makes a lot of soup! For two adults and one toddler we had enough for dinner one night and lunch leftovers for two days. 
b) One-pot meal, which means hardly any dishes.
c) It's healthy.
d) It's even better as leftovers.

I made a couple of changes. I added ground beef. I just threw in a pound of ground beef that was still partially frozen, and by the time the soup was ready it had cooked through. I also discovered at the last minute that I was out of diced tomatoes, so I used a can of condensed tomato soup and added an additional can of water instead. 
I'm sure I would have loved it as-is, though, because my favorite things were elements I didn't change: the curry powder makes the flavor special and somewhat unusual, and the garbanzo beans are amazing after 90 minutes of simmering. They get all buttery and delicious.
I'll definitely be putting this into our winter rotation.

Thank you for sharing, wonderful recipe and very, very easy.  I did as suggested and used more broth and less barley. I also added 1 diced potato and used a fajita marinade instead of Worcestershire sauce (vegetarian). I cooked it all day in a slow cooker. This one goes in my recipe box!

Just made this.  It's beyond great.  It's also so healthy.  I followed the recipe exactly but next time I would put less barley or add more stock so it's thinner but it's an easy recipe to make.  Just put everything in and let it simmer.

This is a great all-around veggie soup - love the addition of barley, cause a) i like barley and b) it slightly thickens the broth, which I also dig :)  This had to be one of the easiest soups I've ever made and it's sooo good.  You just dump it all in a pot and cook for 90 minutes!  I also omitted the Worcestershire sauce because I'm vegan and didn't have a veg sauce around...also added some shredded cabbage, some smashed up dried mushrooms and lots of crushed garlic.  Made a big old pot so I could freeze a bunch and still have lots to eat this week.  This is one I'll make again!

I am definitely not a soup person. But tonight was damp and cold and I needed to feed three guys in this house. I did a general search using terms "barley" and "soup." This recipe came up first on the list, I read it through, had almost all of the ingredients, and went to it. I followed it exactly except I didn't have celery. As soon as it came to a boil, the house smelled delicious! After an hour and a half, the soup thickened wonderfully and the seasonings and veggies melded well. And guess what--my three guys loved it and  so did I! Thank you, Beaker, for the best veggie soup ever! (P.S.--Follow this recipe exactly. It really turns out perfect

This soup was great! The only changes I made were to sautee the chopped vege in 1tb of olive oil before adding the stock and spices, add a can of kidney beans, omit the salt and sugar (the vege stock I use has plenty of sodium in it), use a quarter cup of fresh parsley instead of the dried, and replace the Worcestershire sauce with low sodium soy sauce and a bit of apple cider vinegar (to make it vegan). I also put a few drops of chipotle tobasco in my serving. Delicious!

This is super yummy. I had to use vegetable bouillon, so my came out too salty, but it was still so good. I did not add the chickpeas or the curry because I didn't have them. Mine did get way too thick, kind of like a stew, but it doesn't matter. I will try more broth next time, and of course, regular broth.

A unique and delicious tasting soup!  I used water and chicken bouillon instead of veg. broth since it is what I generally have on hand.  Cut down to 3/4 cup of barley and omitted salt.  (Tasted too salty to me - maybe due to the bouillon - and adding water easily fixed this without taking away from the flavors.)  Seasonings are excellent and give this soup a serious punch of flavor.  Very versitile and forgiving as any vegetable or bean would go nicely here.

I'd say this was pretty good. I just made this today but I didn't add the garbanzo beans or the tomatoes and I replaced the onions with shallots. It still came out really well. It's very hardy and I'd recommend this. Personally I believe it needs a little more salt and pepper though-- and I'm generally light on both.

The recipe came out as it should have, I'm just not a fan of the taste. I'm sure it's just me though, based on the other reviews. I think this would be much better as a chicken broth-based soup.

Love this soup! Made it last night and it was delicious.  Had it for lunch today. Needed to add more broth as it was so thick but it was just as good.  I will be making this often.

Great Recipe.  I've made it several times now, and I find that it's a solid base that lends itself well to playing around with different seasonings.  It's a definite "make at the beginning of the week and eat it throughout" kind of recipe.  I usually add a few more veggies to it, and throw a clove of garlic in with the onion and sweat them a little.

Pretty much followed the recipe except i didn't have barley, so i substituted buckwheat groats.  Also added a yellow squash and sauteed all vegies in a bit of olive oil before adding the rest.  Additionally, i added in some hot turkey sausage.  Really, excellent flavor.  Very healthy!!!  Thank you!!!

I am not a big soup eater, and this didn't really excite me at all by reading it, but it sounded healthy and decently tasty.  And I had everything on hand...turns out that it tastes very similar to something I used to eat when I was little :)  What a wonderful taste.  I wasn't too fond of the stewed tomatoes - taste was good, but the chunks were quite large.   I will also admit that I didn't have 2 vegetable broths, so I used one beef and one veggie, but it was still really great.  Thanks so much!!  Will definitely make it again!!

Enjoyed the ease and health of this.  I also enjoyed that I was running low on groceries and still could make this!  I didn't have any regular barley so I threw in almost a cup of quick barley 20 min. before the soup was done.  It definitely did not thicken the soup like regular barley would have.  There was plenty of broth.  Next time I will use regular barley.  Didn't have curry so I put in chili powder like one reviewer did.  I will be making this again.

I was thinking of looking for a good barley soup recipe when this one popped up in my email.  I just finished making it and it is SO GOOD!  The few things I did differently:  1/2 cup of barley - makes the soup a perfect consistency; I used a combo of vegetable, low-salt beef and low-salt chicken broths just 'cause I like all three.  I hate that it cooked down as much as it did, but that's ok... I'll just have to make it again.  It's one of the best soups I've ever made - BRAVO, Beaker!

Love this! Not soupy, but thick like stew which I prefer. I sauteed the onion, celery & carrots with some diced red & green bell peppers. Then added 3 cloves of chopped garlic instead of powder and let it cook a minute while I opened all the cans.  I omitted the curry (hate it) & didn't have any parsley or zucchini.  Subbed pinto beans for garbanzos which I dislike, and added some chopped broccoli, & cauliflower.  Delicious! Healthy, low-cal, low-fat, and vegan for those who care.  What more can you ask for?  Will definitely make again and again.  Thanks for a great way to eat more whole grains as barley is one of the very few I like.

Really enjoyed it despite having to modify for what's readily available here in China. No W sauce, so I used organic soy sauce, no zucchini - used cucumber, added 2 types of beans (one resembles the navy beans from pork and beans, the other looked like dried peas, but were some sort of green colored beans, rather small-sized), then no paprika -used red pepper and chili sauce, added garlic, ginger and Italian spices (presumably, basil, oregano and garlic) then used 2 fresh tomatoes, no vegetable broth, so I added more celery, carrots and dried chicken stock, fresh cilantro, quadrupled the black pepper and doubled the curry powder. Replaced sugar with organic honey. All of this was just put into the crock pot and cooked on high for 5-6 hours, then I added more seasonings and reduced to low to simmer all night. It was fantastic! Sometimes I get lucky when I have to use makeshift ingredients-this time it was rewarding. (May times it isn't ;)

What a perfect soup for the fall.  The spices simmering away in the soup will fill your house with a wonderful aroma.  I used chicken broth in place of vegetable and towards the end of cooking added some fresh baby spinach.  WOW!!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this tonight and it was so good. Even my carnivorous boyfriend enjoyed it!! I substituted chicken broth for veg. broth. I left out the celery (ew cooked celery). I used fire roasted tomatoes and the result was awesome!! First time actually recommending anything on here!!

This is a vegetable barley soup that has travelled the world.  The spices are so unexpected, but make this soup into something special!

This soup is awesome! Like everyone else I made some minor changes: I sauted both a yellow and red onion with garlic then added the rest of the ingredients minus the garlic powder and I used only 1/2 cup of barley. I will be making this again!

I started to make this thinking I had barley in the pantry but it turned out all I had was lentils so I used those in place of the barley.  The soup is not as thick as the picture shown here but it is still very tasty.  I also added some green peppers, jalapeno, corn and peas.

Very good!  I've made this a couple of times now.  It freezes well in single servings to take to work.  I've added a scoop of miso to the broth too, yum!  Thanks Beaker1!

this was my first time cooking with barley, and I am hooked!  this soup was wonderful!  The only substitutions I made were that I used whole garlic cloves, chopped, instead of the garlic powder....also, I had a russet potato that wasn't getting any younger, so I peeled and cubed that and added it in the soup...was so good!  I will definitely make this again!

This soup was excellent.  We made just two adjustments. We left out the sugar and we added a potato.  We also topped it with Romano cheese when we served it and included homemade garlic bread on the side.  Highly recommend.

This is a yummy one! I made this with a few tweaks: black beans instead of the garbanzos, chard ribs instead of celery and no curry. Still came out fantastic! :)

This was just perfect for a cold winter's day! I was looking for a healthy non-tomato based soup. I am following the phase II of South Beach and this fit the bill! High in protein and fiber, low in added crud. I added spinach and substituted the garbanzo beans for cannellini (white) beans. I used low sodium broth as I feel that we can always add our own salt if needed. I see many reviewers thought it needed more kick but we don't particularly like spicy foods so this soup was just the right flavor.

great recipe but I found it needed some kick so I added a bit of hot sauce (tabasco) - also next time I might use chicken or turket broth.  Does this recipe need to be vegetarian?

SOOOOO yummy!  I never review anything on here, but this is definitely one of the best broth based soups I have ever made.  I made exactly as is, other than adding a yellow squash, 3/4 C. barley, and chicken stock.  Definitely will be making again soon!

Very good. I added some potato and left out the zucchini (I'm just not a fan). I will most likely add vegetarian "beef" crumbles in the future. Will make again.

i made this without garbanzo beans for my husband, mom, and grandparents and they all loved it!  without the garbanzo beans, it was not too thick at all (it had a nice broth).  the barley is fun.  i also used some bouillion cubes since i did not have enough vegetable broth handy.

Great soup.  Easy to make.  I also use fresh grated garlic - 2 or 3 cloves.  I start by putting the garlic, onion, carrot and celery into a hot pot with a little olive oil and butter.  After the vegetables are tender, I add the rest of the ingredients.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good flavor, but I left out the curry and sugar.  I added some stew meat.  Definately too much barley.  Next time I'll only use 1/2 cup.

We didn't have celery, so I put in diced sweet potatoes - soooo yummy with the seasonings.  Beef broth instead of vegetable and I added instant barley in the last 12 minutes.  It was more of a soup than a thick stew, and we LOVED it!

This is such an easy soup to make! I followed the recipe exactly and could not have been more pleased with how it turned out. Even my meat-loving husband enjoyed this soup! It is a thick soup...much more of a stew, but you could easily add more broth if you wanted to.

I've made this recipe several times and I just love it! I omitted the Worcestershire sauce and sometimes add an extra cup of barley to make it more filling, just as a personal preference. Thanks for a great recipe!

This had absolutely no flavor. It was the sensation of eating nothing.

I expected this to be much tastier due to the great reviews, I thought that it was quite bland and boring. It was ok but I won't make it again :(

I have made this soup several times and it is excellent! I use home canned tomato juice or tomato and canned vegetable juice. Also I have never used the zucchini, mainly because I never have it on hand. Also, if you use 1/2 the barley it won't be so thick. I use the quick cooking kind and just put it in later. The last time I made it I added some shredded cabbage. It is always good. Yum!

This was interesting. I made it as written and it is very hearty and filling as the recipe suggests. You could easily take lots of liberty every time you make it as far as what veggies to add. It's the curry I'm not sure about. It gives it a unique flavor, but I'm not sure I like it. Doesn't mean it should get a bad rating from me though, as that's a personal preference. Everyone else really enjoyed it! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Would rate this 3.5 stars.  I used the full amount of barley, and while it was thick, there was still a decent amount of liquid left over by the 4th night.  I would probably do 3/4 cup next time to reduce the thickness.  I used chicken broth, no celery/zucchini/white sugar/salt/Worcestershire sauce.  I thought the combination of paprika and curry was interesting, though not necessarily complementary.

I was looking for a recipe to use up leftover roast. Wow, this was fantastic! I saw it recommended by Fit & Healthy Mom on the recipe exchange & had to make it. I only had 1 qt of Organic Veggie Broth so I added a qt of water & a bit of Sprouts Veggie Broth powder. Only used 1/2 cup of Barley. Toward the end threw in the leftover roast with some of the juice. Followed the rest to a T except for not adding sugar, hubbie has diabetes. It's rich, filling & delish, thanks!

easy and tasty. I used fresh beans that I had previously soaked and cooked and I didn't have the tomatoes, instead used some tomato paste. Other than that I did it all as stated and it came out very good. make again!

I am adding this recipe to my regular circulation. I thought it was delicious. I had to make a few adjustments: I omitted Worcestershire sauce to make it vegetarian, I omitted tomatoes because my son has an allergy, and I omitted curry because I didn't have any. I thought the tomatoes would have been a nice touch but even without them, this soup was outstanding, and had the perfect consistency. I served it alongside grilled cheese sandwiches but really, the soup was hearty enough to eat by itself.

I made a few changes, but it is excellent! I didn't have garbonzo beans or zucchini so I left them out. To make up for it I doubled the tomatoes and added green beans, corn, and peas. Very yummy.

This soup turned out really well. My husband has asked for it twice since last week. I would have given it 5 stars but i made a few changes to suit. Like a previous reviewer, I did not have curry so i used 1/4 tsp each of chili powder and crushed red pepper. I also used organic vegetable broth and 1 cup of brown rice instead of barley. It has a thicker consistency, more like a stew but it is wonderful. Thanks for a great recipe!

I make a lot of different soups and this is a wonderful addition to my collection of recipes! I made exactly as instructed, using super low sodium organic broth.  It came out hearty and rich - more the consistency of stew, which I love!  The heat is wonderful, though next time I'll probably use 1/2 the amount of pepper.  I'm really looking forward to eating this as a comfort food in the winter. YUM!

My favorite foods to make and eat are soups and I'm always looking for a new recipe to try out.  My old recipe for vegetable barley soup was sort of bland so I was excited when I came across this recipe which included some unusual ingredients I'd never thought to add (curry powder - who'd a thunk it!).  I tried the recipe as written the first time and then decided to tweek it to my liking.  I like a hearty soup, so I added 1 1/2 pounds of lean stew meat, cut into small cubes.  I eliminated the beans since I already had enough protein with the addition of the meat, and used beef broth rather than vegetable.  I also waited until the last 30 minutes of the cooking time to add the barley so it didn't get overcooked. My daughter took some for her lunch and my son-in-law said he'd pay me to make a pot full just for him.  A very big success, to say the least.  Thanks for a great recipe.

i used chicken stock instead of veggie, didn't have zucchini so substituted more celery in place, doubled the tinned tomatoes, used barlotti beans instead of chickpeas, added fresh garlic instead of powdered, didn't need any extra salt (the stock was salty enough), and i doubled the worcestershire sauce. i also sauted the veggies first to bring out their sweetness a bit, then simmered the lot for an hour, adding instant barley for the last 15 mins. served with baguette & herb butter, and sprinkled with parmesan.  tasty soup, but i think i'll up the spices a bit more next time to suit my taste.

Decent vegetable barley soup. Extremely flexible recipe (you can pretty much add any veggies you want), but the taste was just okay. Not bad by any means, but nothing that made me feel inspired to make this again.

Delicious! I adjusted the spices a little to suit my tastes (1/4 tsp black pepper and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes instead of all black pepper, added 1/4 tsp marjoram), but for the most part made the recipe as-is. I used a quick barley, which made the cooking time a lot less. And I always saute the veggies in olive oil before adding the broth - it really brings out the flavors this way. Great recipe!

Just made this and I am eating some right now.  Much better then I thought it would be.  I did substitute frozen lima beans for the chick peas (I don't like chick peas) and I added peas and grean beans.  I can't wait to try it tomorrow, usually soups like this taste even better the next day.

This was absolutely wonderful. My husband (who isn't usually a soup person) loved it and asked to have it again.  I followed the recipe exactly. It had just the right amount of spice and flavor and it wasn't too thick. Looking forward to having it for lunch today!  Oh, and it made much more than 8 servings (and we had big bowls full). I would say closer to 12.

The curry gives it a kick that keeps you coming back for more.  Like another review said, this is a wonderful "everything but the kitchen sink" soup.  Added green beans, didn't have and garbanzo/chick peas on hand.  Very easy to make, only simmered about 1 hour.

This is a fast soup to put together and I absolutely love it!  I substituted some of the ingredients, however followed the spice recommendations to the letter (except cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp).  It will be my future "everything but the kitchen sink" recipe, the one I make when I loathe going to the grocery store.   My alterations: cut barley to 3/4 cup;  used 1 qt. of beef broth + 1 qt. veggie broth; used cannelini beans vs. garbanzo (rinsed them first); used frozen green beans v. zucchini; used minced garlic in jar v. garlic powder. Only simmered an hour v. 90 min.   Awesome soup!

Very warming and satisfying!  I couldn't imagine a soup starting with raw onions, so I sauteed them in a little EVOO with some garlic first, then sauteed the rest of the veggies with them for a bit before adding the rest.  Fabulous!  Omitted tomates, and substituted celeriac for the zucchini and navy beans for the garbanzos to no detriment.  Add more or less stock to your desired thickness (I made this like a stew, with only 6 added cups of broth).  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a really healthy and tasty soup.  The only reason it's getting 4 stars is that we thought it would taste better with beef stock, rather than vegetable.  Otherwise, it was great!  Thanks.

This is super delicious! The curry powder is such a good addition to this vegetable soup. I used just one quart of veg. stock, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, omitted the Worc.sauce and used cooked bulgur wheat for the filler. Just yummy! Thanks, Beaker.

Great recipe.  I didn't have zucchini and substituted peas for the garbanzo beans and it still turned out great (added near the end so they wouldn't break down)!  FYI you need about 8 cups veg broth (2 quarts).  I was out and actually made my own using the same veggies I needed for the soup!

Oh my goodness! Sooo yummy! It was supposed to be as a starter to a meal, but I just ended up eating two big bowls of it and aborting the rest of the planned dinner. AMAZING recipe.

This was really easy to make.  The only reason I gave it four stars is because it tasted more tomatoey than I expected.  My guests loved it and it was incredibly filling.  I added cumin and red pepper.

Excellent soup, I added parsnip and put red wine vinegar instead of the Worcestershire sauce.  This is a new family favorite!

This was delicious, despite my substitions (one if which was the main ingredient!).  I was out of barley, so I substituted lentils in its place.  I also used low sodium beef bouillion instead of vegetable broth and my can of tomatoes was "no salt added".  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME! This is the best veggie soup you will ever taste! These are my variations: used chicken broth, more zucchini, 32 oz can of chopped tomatoes (with juice) no chickpeas (didn't have time to make) so 1/2 lb chopped mushrooms, kernels from 2 ears of corn. Upped the curry to 1 tbsp and added a little more pepper. Added 1 tbsp of chopped garlic. Next time I will add more barley. I never had barley before and I really like it. I will make this soup for the rest of my life!

Hearty soup that tastes very good.  Missing some pizazz though, not sure what would make it better.  Might try something different next time.

This was great!  I first sauteed fresh garlic, onions and celery and then added everything else.  I questioned using curry, but it was yummy and subtle.  I added additional veggies to clear out my fridge, and it was great!  Really hearty and satisfying soup.

SO GOOD! I added plantains and red pepper, two things I personally like in veggie stews. I loved the consistency and final flavor. Will definitely make it again. Good served with french bread or toast.

I had never made a soup with vegetable stock before, but since we were having a soup/salad potluck at work for a guy who is a vegetarian,I decided to try this recipe. It received rave reviews & was eaten down to the last spoonful of my crockpot! Excellent soup! and Healthy!

We are soup lovers at my house and my partner's comment about this recipe was that it was "the near perfect soup." 

I followed the recipe farily closely, using only fresh organic ingredients and omitting the worcestershire sauce and curry powder. I even used white sugar (which is a rariety for me!). 

I simmered it slightly less than called for (about 1 hr, 10 min) because I prefer less tender veggies.

It was absolutely wonderful! It goes directly into my "favorites" file.

I made this in the crock pot on a snowy day (which doesn't happen a whole lot around here).  I used my own chicken stock since I didn't have any vegetable stock and also had to substitute dried white (navy) beans since I didn't have any garbanzos, but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  It was delicious and very hearty.  I served with homemade rolls, and my 8-year-old son almost licked his soup mug clean.  I did follow the advice of a few others and added the zucchini toward the end of the cooking time.  

Great meatless meal for a cold snowy day!

I was looking for a good vegetarian soup for my family, and this one was a homerun.  It has delicious flavor. I read many of the reviews, and made some of the modifications suggested: I sauteed the onion and celery in butter before adding, used 3/4 cup of barley and increased the broth by a can, and I used mostly Swanson chicken broth, but also used Swanson vegetable broth.  This will be a winter staple in our house. Thank you so much for the recipe!

Enjoyed making and eating this soup.  I increased the veggie broth to 3 quarts and substituted frozen green beans for the zucchini.  It was better the next day and even better after that.  Thanks for the recipe!

This soup is so yummy and hearty.  I have made it so many times for friends and family and have passed on the recipe a dozen or so times.  I add more broth and a little less barley for my husband.  This is definitely one of my favorite soup recipes!

Excellent!  I am already looking forward to leftovers tomorrow!! It was a perfect healthy cure for turkey hangover after Thanksgiving! I added two extra celery stalks and one extra carrot.  I added the beans and zucchini when there was a half an hour left and added escarole 5 minutes before serving.  I left out the curry powder and didn't miss it at all with all of the other flavors.  Next time... and there will be a next time.... I will omit zucchini and add green beans instead.  Excellent meal!  Thank you for sharing.

First off. I made vegetable stock from a recipe on this site.  Then I made this soup.  It had that richness usually only found with chicken as the base.  I also cut the barley in half because I like my soup soupy and it was awesome!  I will make this again very soon.  We couldn't believe how good it really was.

I loved this recipe but I did do a couple of things different.  To start I sauteed three cloves of garlic in two tablespoons of butter, added onions, then celery.  I then added two tablespoons of flour and after that the broth and tomatoes and seasonings.  I added parsnips,turnips,and squash instead of barley, and upped the amount of curry by a quarter teaspoon.....delicious!

We really liked this and will make it again.  I made a lot of changes:  left out celery, worstechire sauce, sugar, and tomatoes, added broccoli, more salt, and some water, and at the last minute i realized my barley was no good so i used brown rice instead.  Ok, so I totally changed the recipe, but it's a versatile dish that you can adjust to your taste, and it came out really yummy!

This review is from a "meat and potatoes" girl....(ok junk food too).  I was looking for a healthy snack/meal like when I was doing WW and ate the "free soup".  This recipe is absolutely delicious.  I wouldn't change a thing (although I also added 2 cups more veggie broth at the end).  The curry really made it special.  It was simple to make and will definitely be a family classic in years to come.  I've already sent the link to my family and friends.  Thanks Beaker for sharing.

All I can say is WOW! I was looking for a simple veggie soup and this was WAY beyond my expectations.  My girls ate it up (1,4) without hesitation and I look forward to eating it for lunch and dinner today.  Delish! Into the dinner rotations it will be!

I was amazed at how hearty and filling this soup is for being so low in fat and calories.  I followed others suggestions and used only 3/4 cup barley and 2 cups more broth.  Very tasty with just the right amount of spice.

This is a delicious soup and is so simple to make (not to mention being very healthy)! I've made it many times now and it has become a staple dish in my home. As other reviewers have said, I would suggest using less barley (3/4 cup)- mushrooms also are lovely in this if you like them. Don't be afraid of the spices/Worcestershire sauce- they taste great together! I highly recommend trying this one out. Enjoy!

Excellent!  It was a big hit with everyone in my family.  It is just the thing to warm up with on a cold winter day.  The spices are perfect.  The soup is thick, but I love it that way.  Leftovers are even better the next day.  Definitely a keeper!

Simple and delish..
I changed it a little. I fried the onion and fresh garlic in some olive oil and then added other ingredients. I used 1/2 barley and 1/2 cracked buckwheat and had some red swiss chard to use up(chopped it up). I also used a mixed tin of garbonzo/kidney ect.
I didn't use the sugar(we get too much in our diets as it is) or the curry(just didn't feel like curry).

I love this soup! What's great is that you can substitute the garbanzo beans for any meat substitute you have hanging around like lentils or even tofu. I like to add more broth because it has a stew like consistency at the end if not. Even better the next day.

Honestly, this was a little disappointing. I'd give it a 3.5, but I will round up and click on the 4 stars for a rating. I substituted green pepper for the zucchini and black beans instead of garbanzo. This was only ok tasting until I added a sprinkle of parmesan cheese and some balsamic vinegar to my bowl. It was better than other vegetable soup recipes I have made on here, but it was not the best.

Excellent! This is the first thing I ever cooked for my boyfriend 2 years ago and I came across the recipe recently and made it again the other night.  He remembered it and loved it just as much now as he did then.  It's healthy and delicious! Definately a comforting dinner on a cold fall/winter night.  I served the soup with fresh french bread and butter.

Not bad, but I don't think I'll make it again.  Too peppery and too thick for my personal taste.

super(super)easy and tasty as well! i only used 1/2 cup barley and added potatoes, more garlic powder and quite a bit more salt... it's a vice.

great recipe!

Wonderful recipe!  Will be a staple, I already called my mother to tell her I'll drop some by tomorrow.  I'm planning on making a large batch this weekend to freeze and bring to my Nana.  I made a few changes, just becuase I always tweak recipes a little bit.  After reading that other reviewers cut back on the barley I decided to add one 8 oz. package of sliced mushrooms (we love them in my house and I figured they would add some water).  I also used a 28 oz. can or stewed tomatoes which I broke up with my hands over the pot.  Added a few extra dashes of each spice and worcheshire to compensate for extra ingredients and didn't use any curry becuase I am not a fan.  This recipe is a great way to eat a filling, healthy meal without meat and wonderfully incorporates two of my favorite hearty ingredients, barley and garbanzos.  I can't wait to email it to my vegetarian sister!  THANK YOU BEAKER!

Cut barley to 3/4 c, omitted zucchini and garbanzos, reduced sugar to 1/2t.  My tomatoes may have been slightly too acidic, and I think I could have done without the W sauce.  I thought this was just ok, but my husband thought it was great (turned into a burrito with some cheese).  I'm thinking this might make a good stuffing for bell peppers...?

This was delicious. I agree with others who have suggested that the barley be cut back to approximately 3/4 cup.

I made this for a church "SoUUPer Sunday" lunch with the vegan crowd in mind, and it was a huge success. I was making a fabulous french onion soup (department store onion soup from this site) at the same time, and was really afraid that this soup was terribly bland. I did make a huge batch (6x?), and ended up adding a bit more of all the spices. Despite my worries, I received a ton of compliments on it. It did sit refrigerated overnight before being reheated, so perhaps the flavors blended. I've made it twice now for catering events and it has been a big hit. Nice and healthy, too. Thanks!

I put this in the slow cooker and it turned out just fine.  I kept all the ingredients the same --even the liquid--and cooked it all day (8ish hrs) on low.  Added 3 T tomato paste for depth of flavor.  The barley creates this creamy consistency that is very yummy.  This is a good Lent recipe and also good for Weight Watchers.  Tasty leftovers, too.

this soup is AMAZING. the curry powder made my house smell absolutely irresistable. i'm pretty new at cooking, so i haven't been very creative and delicious with soups. but my mother, who used to critique my soups endlessly even said that this was ver delicious. it's a total comfrot food b/c it is very warm, and thick.

pressed barley also worked really well, and i didnt' have garbanzo beans, so i subbed them for lentils.  and i forgot the pepper. 

this is a very filling soup. i had it at lunch today at noon and still arne't hungry at 5 pm! =) adding a bit of frozen and thawed tofu is also a nice addition. dont' stop with the curry powder!

Very Good!! Lets see, I used more carrots, more zucchini, added a parsnip and some corn. Used diced tomatos with roasted red peppers. Not as much broth as called for, but I like it thick. The hubby really likes it too. What a great winter meal!

The best soup we've ever had! I used 3 quarts broth (water and 6 veggie boullion cubes) and the next day it was still thick. Also I didn't use sugar or beans, and didn't have a can of diced tomatoes so put about 10 large cherry tomatoes in the blender for a second and used that. Absolutely excellent! Only thing was I added green pepper. It wasn't good - may have been a bad pepper I don't know, won't add it next time. Still EXCELLENT soup!

I was expecting a thick soup, but not this thick! My sister thought she would be funny and eat it with a fork.  That said, after I added several cups of vegetable bouillon, this was a very delicious and hearty soup, easy to make and especially good for cold winter nights. I only had half a zucchini, so I substituted with some corn and spinach. The one thing I would change is not to add the chickpeas; I didn't think that the taste or texture went with the rest of the soup. Will make again!

My husband dislikes anything that lacks meat- BUT he really enjoyed this! He went back for seconds and thirds. It was a bit mushy left over the next day, but still had excellent flavor. Thank you for sharing this very flavorful and healthy recipe!

This soup was great!  I made a couple changes...I had to add a potato, I am from Idaho.  I followed someone elses advise and added about half a pound of browned rinsed ground beef.  I also did kidney beans instead of garbanzo beans, and only put half of the curry powder.  It was delicious!  Thank you for my new favorite soup recipe.

This is delicious.  I love the thick, smooth texture of the soup.  I did cut the barley back to about 3/4 c and would maybe use about 1/4 t pepper as I felt it was a little overpowering.  All in all a delicious recipe!

This is by far my favorite soup recipe.  I have used whatever vegies I happen to have on hand.  There have been times I didn't have canned tomatoes so I used fresh or tomato sauce.  I can't even count the times I've made this and each time it's a little different.  I love bringing it to potlucks, I never have to worry about taking any home!!!  The next time I make it I'm adding roasted chicken.  Thanks for an extra special recipe!

I LOVE this soup! My "version" of it strayed a little from Beaker's.  When I first made the soup, I was living abroad, and didn't know the local language that well.   I also don't cook very often.   So I ended up buying cucumber instead of zucchini.  I couldn't find parsley anywhere in the grocery store, so I omitted that as well.

BUT it was still amazing.   I made it for a friend when he was sick in April.

Very good with bread&butter, and you'll happily have a lot of leftovers.

This soup is wonderful.  The only changes I made were that I used fresh tomatoes from the garden to equal the 14 1/2 ounces of a can and omitted the dried parsley.  So good and great flavor.

We made this recipe for 80 people.  It scaled up great.  We used instant vegetable broth, and used a combination of garbanzo, kidney and canellini beans.

This was wonderful! My husband and children loved it. I used beef broth instead of vegetable. Next time I might use a little less barley. I will make this often. Thanks for the recipe.

Wow, this soup is amazing!  I read the reviews before I made it, so I knew to only use half the pepper (it was still a bit too peppery for me, but the rest of the family loved it).  Also, I do not like garbanzo beans, so I substituted a can of corn, and instead of the zucchini, I used fresh cut mushrooms.  This was one of the easiest, tastiest, and most filling soups I've ever made.  The soup is VERY thick, so after about an hour of cooking, I added 2 more cups of water to make it a little more soupy, then let it cook for 30 more minutes...  PERFECT!

VERY GOOD!  Made a few changes, used beef broth instead of vegetable, decreased the pepper to 1/2 tsp. (have 2 small children in our home) and added 1 lb. browned hamburger that needed to be used.  Also left out the zucchini, didn't have on hand.  I was pleasantly surprised with the blend of spices.  Thanks for a great soup.

I was so looking forward to this soup. It was way to peppery tasting for my family. I ended up having to throw it away. I will probably try making it again with less of the spices.

Healthy, flavorful, inexpensive & easy....this is my kind of recipe.  I followed the instructions with the exception of adding broth to thin.  I shared it with unexpected dinner guests hoping it would live up to previous reviews.  I was not dissappointed.  I sent three copies of the recipe home with my guests.  This is a "keeper"!

This soup is fabulous!  I used beef broth instead of vegetable, but kept everything else exactly the same.  The soup is VERY thick, just the way I like it.  I will be making this soup again, soon!

Thank you for sharing this wonderful aromatic hearty soup. I had everything on hand except zucchini so I used one green pepper. Also added one cup of V8 juice to thin it out just a little. This one is a keeper.

Tasty! I used turkey stock I had on hand for the broth. Only ended up cooking it on simmer for 60 mins rather than 90 as I like the veggies a little less mushy. Used pearl barley for the barley.

I made this recipe as shown,  except I omitted the zucchini. Cooking time of 1 hour was adequate. When I make this recipe again, I plan to double the chickpeas and diced tomatoes while using only 1/2 cup barley.

I used 1/2 barley instead  of 1 cup, but I Loved this soup, tweaked it a bit by adding 1/4 tsp white pepper instead of black and green beans instead of garbanzo
beans.  Thanks for this recipe!

Everyone loved it, my vegan friends (I subbed Bragg Liquid Aminos for the Worcestershire sauce), my pancreatitis suffering friend who can't have fats beyond a certain percentage, my vegetable hating boyfriend (for whom I did leave out the celery). I liked it too. Very easy for the host.

Love this recipe. I followed direction; except I made only 1/2 the recipe as I wanted to be sure I liked the flavour - and I do. I love the fact that there isn't any oil used, just throw everything into the pot and leave it to simmer. I did add kale only because I had some in the fridge. Excellent, easy, healthy recipe. Thank you BEAKER1 for sharing.

I made this per directions and it was super easy and delicious!
I did use chicken stock instead of vegetable but that was the only change I made.  I'm not a huge tomato soup guy and I think using the juice from the chopped tomatoes was a little to 'tomatoey' for me so I think next time I'll just drain the tomatoes before adding.  It does thicken when cooled so just add a little more water or broth to get the consistency you desire.  Will definitely make again!

This recipe is the perfect recipe to use as a jumping off point and with a little creativity you can make a delicious and flavorful meal! Here are my modifications: Add two cups of water/stock. Sauté garlic and ginger first. Add parsnips. Double the carrots. Double the spices at least. Use Anise instead of celery. Cook for 60 mins. Add chopped kale leaves at the end. Yum!

Tasty and very easy.  As the recipe says, it is a bit thick - the second time I made it, I did cut back a bit on the barley and that was perfect.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used just 1/2 cup of regular medium barley.  The soup was very good but the combination of seasonings seemed to be just a little off.  I think I will try again but tweak the spices next time.

Used potatoes instead of chickpeas and skipped the zucchini, upped the water, lowered the barley. Pretty sure the intended flavor came through anyway, and was yummy.

Changes: I used low sodium chicken bouillon and only half the salt because of restrictions. Used dried, cooked garbanzo beans instead of canned. Also, I made mine in the instant pot... 30 minutes on soup setting. Natural release.

Pretty great, healthy hearty soup. I especially liked biting into a garbanzo bean. It was like a mystery each time, as I am not used to garbanzo beans in my soup!

Nicely balanced, but as a new cook, I was wondering why there was sugar in it in addition to carrots? I thought, like in ragu, you used the carrots for sweetness. Oh, well. It all worked out and tasted great. Next time I will put garbanzo beans in dry and add extra water to see what happens.

This is very good soup but I did make a few changes: I used broth made from pork shoulder bones, used only 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1/4 tsp. fresh ground black pepper, substituted Cajun Seasoning for the curry powder, and simmered it only 45 minutes so it wouldn't get too thick.

This soup is an explosion of wonderful flavors!  It's a keeper.  I tried to stay true to the recipe but modified it based on what I have on-hand.  I added kale and green pepper, but no zucchini.  Instead of diced tomatoes, I had a can of 6 oz tomato paste. I also spiced it up with 1/2 tspn of Fuegorita.  It'll be delicious with any vege.

Yummy and easy to sub with other veggies. Used cauliflower and green beans instead of celery and zucchini. Solid vegetable barley soup recipe! My husband loved it and he’s a meat n potatoes kinda guy.

Sooooo good with really fantastic flavor! I made this exactly as the recipe is written, with only one adjustment; I used only a half cup of barley, rather than one cup, since I like to have some broth. I will definitely make this again!

Delicious! I cooked this 30 minutes less and added 2 extra cups of vegetable broth. Also substituted Braggs liquid aminos for the worchestershire sauce to make this vegan. Thanks for the recipe!

I liked this recipe and so did my family.  I intended on making this straight up as it was written but found out too late what I was lacking!  I didn't have zucchini so used peas instead. I also didn't have garbanzo beans so used other beans to replace.  Another ingredient I didn't have was the tomatoes so used salsa! Overall, this recipe has a very nice  flavor and the fact that my substitutions worked well makes it a five star recipe in my book.  I will make it again!

I  like that this is a meatless soup and is still very flavorful.  A few things would improve it in my opinion. I like garbanzo beans but there were too many in this soup. I would cut the amount in half and add more vegies.  More celery and carrots and maybe some green beans.  The flavor is really good, no changes there!

Made as instructed; it’s ok, came out more watery than thick. May‘ve been a misstep on my part. Still is good and something nutritious for my dad and I to eat during the week. Thank you!

I make this exactly as written (maybe a little more carrots and zucchini if I’ve got them on hand) and it is delicious. It’s a family favorite and has entered comfort food territory in our household.

I made this with some modifications. I didn't have a zucchini but I did have a red bell pepper and 2 jalapenos. I roasted them in the broiler, chopped them and added them to the soup which gave it a little kick. I also caramelized the onions first before adding the other ingredients. After it was cooked, I sprinkled some fresh, grated Parmesan cheese on the top. Absolutely delicious!

This soup is delicious.  I did make a few changes:  I added about a cup of frozen green beans, about a 1/2 cup each of corn and edamame.  I used fresh tomatoes and added about a 1/2 cup of water to compensate for not using canned. I did cut the barley to 1/2 cup and didn’t put the Worcestershire in only because I was out.  We have been trying to eating basically a no meat, dairy, bread diet and this was really filling and tasty.  I usually don’t like curry, but per other reviews I went ahead and added it.  We loved this soup and this is a great addition to our new diet.

I love to clean out my fridge using this recipe. I put every veg you can think of in there, thus having to use more water.  Very versatile.  I also add a splash of red wine vinegar instead of the worschestir. I also add turmeric and cumin powder.

Made this for the family, since my son recently became a vegetarian. I'm completely obsessed with this soup now! Hearty flavors and super healthy! I cooked it 25 minutes in the instant pot instead of on the stove. Veggies came out soft, but the barley adds enough texture.

Absolutely delicious.  

I did make a few minor changes:  1) Used a teaspoon of honey instead of sugar;  2) Eliminated the garbanzo beans;  3) Added a handful of chopped cabbage and;  4) Used smoked paprika.

Upcoming cholesterol test so looking for anything barley when I found this recipe.  This was delicious and very hearty. Used Penzeys minced garlic in place of garlic powder, cilantro in place of parsley, Penzeys Bavarian seasoning in place of bay leaf, a bit of McCormick Pub Burger seasoning,  28 oz diced tomatoes,  more celery and carrot and 1 qt  beef stock in place of 1 qt veggie broth.  Sauteed veggies and garlic in small amount of olive oil prior to adding stock, etc.  Added canned green beans and a bit of frozen water chestnut and mushroom last half hour.  Added another cup of water and beef bullion.  Was very afraid of a teaspoon curry powder but after 90 minutes, all seasonings were nicely blended.  So tasty. Made huge amount. Looking forward to leftovers tomorrow!

Loved this, but had to improvise between grocery trips. Subbed beef broth, fresh garlic, & a small bag of frozen veggies for the veggie broth,  garlic powder, carrots and zucchini. Subbed dashes of smoked paprika, cumin, and cayenne in place of curry powder.

This is absolutely going in the rotation. The combination of tomato, barley, garbanzos, and Worcestershire is wonderful when it's cold out.

When I saw the combination of spices I thought this would be great.  While a hearty soup, still bland.  I'll make it again and play with the spices.

I didn't have celery, so I used a cup of frozen corn. I added another can of chicken broth at the end, because the soup is really thick.  The flavor is so good and obviously super versatile on the vegetables. Great recipe! I will definitely be making this again.

Such an easy and delicious soup! I added peeled and chopped yukon gold potatoes for extra heartiness. It was fantastic  the first day and as leftovers served along side rustic bread. If you enjoy a kick, add a sprinkle of cayenne pepper.

Made some changes: Used Pinto beans instead of garbanzo. Used 2 zucchini's not 1. Used 32oz of chicken broth and 32oz of beef broth instead of 64oz of vegetable broth.  And used 1/2 a cup of barley instead of 1 full cup. I cooked turkey sausage in a separate pan at the 1 hour mark of the soup cooking, then sliced them and added it to the soup.  This was delicious!!!!!!

Made this for dinner tonight, following the recipe almost exactly (only used a 1/2 onion because that's all that I had) and we LOVED it. The spice combination is just right. This will be added to our regular rotation.

Delicious and easy to make.  Didn't have any zucchini or garbanzo beans but had fresh green beans so I cut them up and used them instead.  Also didn't have any vegetable broth so used beef broth.  Simmered while I was out shoveling snow.  What a nice lunch to come in to!!!

I have made this several times so far and it seems to be enjoyed by vegetarians and meat eaters alike. As written, the recipe is very good and flavorful. I've also varied the recipe depending what ingredients I had on hand and have found that it's very forgiving. I've tried different vegetables, seasonings, beans, and grains, and am consistently happy with the results. Last night, we were in the mood for this dish and I was disappointed to find that I was out of both barley and curry, however; I did happen to have a box of curried couscous. I added the seasoning packet in with the other seasonings, and added the couscous toward the end. It turned out great. The five teens I was feeding went back for seconds and loved dipping in their crusty bread that I served on the side. A great recipe! Thanks, Beaker!

Love this soup! I made it with beef broth as suggested in a previous review. Also only used 1/2 cup barley. Added one cup of chopped cabbage, then a little red wine at the end. Waited on adding the pepper as also suggested. Didn't end up using - the cabbage made it peppery enough --- yum!! Will definitely make this again. Very easy to vary depending on what you've got on hand.

Exceptional! I'm not a vegetarian, but have been trying to find another great soup to add to the winter soup staple list, and this one had such great reviews, I figured I'd give it a whirl.  WooHoo! I finally found a winner! This one is a keeper! Where has this soup been all my life?!  My partner really loved it and said it was the perfect blend of textures and flavors. Even better on day two. I followed the recipe pretty much as written...  used 1/2 cup of barley instead of 1 c. (based on reviews) and 1/2 vegetable broth and 1/2 beef broth...both of which I made with Better than Bouillon. I'm not too big on curry, so used a scant teaspoon. I would probably do less next time, but my partner loved it as is. Since curry is a personal taste thing, use your judgement. I do think it adds a nice component. I believe those changes didn't alter the original recipe enough to make me think it wouldn't have still been a 5 star if I'd not made those minor changes. I got the barley at Whole Foods from the bulk bins and had 2 choices...I got "hulled". Not sure if that was why, but I ended up having to simmer this forever so they would plump up. No problem though...more simmering, more flavor. The flavor profile, the textures...superb! It is quite hearty for a meatless soup. Oh...I threw in a parmesan rind towards the end. That is my secret ingredient. If you haven't tried that little trick, it will take your soup and stew making to the next level!

We are really Health conscious and I don't like using stock due to the added preservatives most of them contain. So to increase flavor I made the following changes and it turned amazing. 

Added:
 3 cloves garlic, teaspoon of cumin spice, tablespoon of sea salt,  2 tbsp Olive oil. Balsamic vinegar, pinch of cayenne for kick (preference). 

Omitted: Worcestershire, stock and sugar

Method:
Used a food processor to bring onions celery and garlic to a fine chop. Added about 2 tbsp olive oil to pot and sautéed the veggies for a few minutes. Then added the balsamic vinegar, cumin, paprika, Currie and cayenne.  Meanwhile I added the diced tomatoes to the food processor and pulsed a few times to keep some texture.  Added the tomato sauce to the pot and stirred. 

At this point I added the rest of the ingredients and topped with water.

I only cooked the soup for 60 minutes stirring here and there.  This gave the barley a texture similar to an al dente pasta which my wife loves, and the soup had a perfect balance of liquid and vegetables. 

If you like the barley softer then cook for the full 90. You will also have a thicker soup.

Hope you enjoy!

Excellent soup! I sauteed the onions, carrots and celery in a little olive oil first. I used navy beans I stead of chick peas too..personal preference only. I also left out the sugar.
Definitely making it again!

Read the reviews.  Decided I would follow the swiss chard addition, but didn't think it would hold up based on what I saw in my store.  Added kale as this was my original thought.  CHANGE:  zucchini (and kale) were added at the end.  That suggestion I found in other reviews and it really made a positive difference.  Taste was wonderful!

This was a pretty easy recipe to make.  Although I bought the wrong barley, and had the quick 10 min ones so I cooked everything but the barley first.  Added the barley towards the end.  This recipe makes a lot.  If you look at the serving size it says it's for eight people.  It worked out great for us since we cooked it over the weekend, and had dinner for the whole week.  The curry powder gave the soup a nice touch.  BTW we used chicken broth and also added lamb stew meat and Italian sausages.  You could pretty much use this recipe as the base and add practically anything.  We even added mushrooms!

I was not a huge barley soup fan, until I tried this soup!  Excellent!!  A tap spicy for my little kids, but I just added a few sprinkles of sugar to their serving.  Will make again, no doubt!!

Healthy and hearty.  Great flavored broth with the curry and paprika combination.  Serves as a meal because it is so thick.  Add in some chicken sausage for protein, if desired.  No need for any substitutions (except hot sauce for Worcestershire due to shellfish allergy).

Love this soup! I make it to use up all my garden vegetables, so sometimes I change up the mix a bit, but keep the basic proportions the same and the spices the same.
Sometimes we eat "as is" for a vegetarian dish or put  extra protein like chicken into it for a hearty meal.
Yum! Double thumbs up!

I'm vegetarian, so I left out the Worcestershire sauce. The soup is great without it anyway. Buy more than 2 quarts of vegetable stock, as you may want to add extra; the soup indeed turns out really thick (it's more like a stew than a soup).

the barley soaks up alot of the broth by the next day so i tend to add an extra cup or two. I've used frozen green beans or okra in place of the zuccini simply because of household tastes, either were great substitutions.

This was yummy and I'll make it again.  It's a bit on the hot spicy side, I'd tone that down a little next time I make it.  I didn't have canned garbanzo beans, but I had dried ones. I threw those in first and with the 90 min cook time there were soft and ready to eat by the end.

Was a good hot meal on a weeknight to toss on the stove and let cook.  Was a little bland for our families taste.

My family loved it and so did I.  I was frankly surprised, the ingredients are unusual, esp. the sugar and cumin. But it all just blended together so well, we devoured it. I will add that even my picky 8 year-old loved it, so we're making it again today.

Fabulous soup.  I didn't have any zucchini but I don't think it made any difference.  It is very thick though and I added quite a bit of chicken stock at the end.

Very tasty.  Loved the little bit of curry which gave it a great flavour.

Followed as per instructions. Easy, delicious, healthy AND cheap to make. With food prices going up the way they are, time to start thinking more about lentils. May whole family including two meat loving men, loved this dish. Thank you for posting.

Perfect veggie soup. Versatile. Added Lima beans because had no zucchini. When really hot, add spinach and/or kale just before eating. Melt a scoop of unpasteurized miso for extra flavor and probiotics. Perfect.

I'm not a soup guy nor a vegetarian but this soup was spot on when I was looking for a flavor filled alternative to chicken noodle soup when I had the flu. I used San marzano tomatoes I had laying around and I'm sure they added to the excellent finished product.

Fantastic!  Love the barley and all the vegetables.  I think if you don't like this soup you may if you add 2 cups of chopped cooked chicken or beef.  It is cheap and VERY healthy and loaded with flavor.  NOT watery, boring vegetables your mother used to make!

Really good.  I would suggest a 1/2 - 1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar to give it a little acid kick, but otherwise great soup for a cold fall/winter day.

I did not have zucchini, celery or chick peas but I used frozen roasted corn, 1 can of black beans and frozen paper and onion medley (all Trader Joe's). I also added some Smoke seasoning from TJ and it was absolutely delicious!

Tried this recipe for the first time afew years ago  and what a great beginning to my soup!. I like to look at reviews before I get my ingredients together so I can tweak the recipe to my liking. I left out zucchini  and garbanzo because I'm not a fan and added great northern beans. I added a pinch of sage, & beef bouillon cubes to my taste and replaced curry with chili powder that I had on hand. I had no diced so I substituted a can of stewed tomates & so no need for the sugar. Tastes great while cooking at the moment!

I halved the recipe, except for the garbanzo beans and tomatoes I used the whole can and I used one bay leaf..  I didn't have worcestershire sauce or zucchini, but added about a cup of frozen mixed veges. the last 20 minutes.  Very flavorful soup that I will make again.

I thought it was an excellent recipe, full of veggies and very filling! I followed other reviews and only put in 3/4C of barley (I used pot barley.... I had no idea what the difference between pot barley and pearl barley, but the "pot" kind worked just fine!).  I also used chicken broth, as I didn't have any vegetable broth.
My family of 5 gobbled it up - and two of my three kids want to have it in their school lunch tomorrow. (that's when I know it's a keeper!) 
The curry powder made me nervous- but the flavor in this soup was amazing!!
PS - For the Canadians out there, 2 quarts is equal to 8 cups (or two boxes of Campbell's 900ml boxes of broth!)

I love this soup! I sautee the veggies first, and omit the tomatoes and zucchini.  I also use vegan Worcestershire sauce.  And I didn't know about the pepper, have been using fresh ground course black pepper and it's been fine.

Very good! I used 4 tsp of Vegetable Better Than Bouillon (I always use half the recommended amount - too salty otherwise imo), no zucchini so stirred in fresh spinach once the soup was off the heat, reduced the barley by 2 TBSP. I had no curry powder so replaced it w/generous pinches of: cumin, ground chili, turmeric, coriander, ginger. My soup was done in 80 minutes, it was still a "soupy" consistency however did thicken upon cooling, as expected. I thin the leftovers with a small amount of stock or water. I'm sure this recipe could take a lot of variation, I would like to try more vegetables, different beans, thyme in place of curry spices etc.

Made this for hubby and myself for lunch today, it was amazing! Lots of veggies, I did add chopped mini potatoes as well. Fresh chives and garlic fronds from the garden and a sprinkle of grated parm finished it off. It's a keeper!

Best vegetable soup ever!  Even my picky kids like it.  My son says it's addictive.  Tried this as is, but my kids like it better without the chickpeas and barley so I just leave those out. Occasionally, I add parsnips.  Delicious!

I added a lb of stew beef, used half veg broth and half beef broth. Used the whole c of barley. Very thick. stew-like consistency, but we loved it! Perfect for this time of year and those single digit temperatures. I love barley so this hit the spot :)

I tried this recipe and was very pleased with it. I did use 2 10 oz cans of diced tomatoes with mild chiles. If you want more of a liquids soup, then cut back on the barley. But I liked it just the way it was. I also added a bag of peas.

Very tasty and a meal all by itself. I was surprised at how this looked more like a stew than a soup, so I added another quart of broth as it simmered in the crockpot. Prepared it for a New Years celebration and had several folks rave at how delicious they thought it tasted. Had to tell them the recipe came in on my inter-webs ;)

Love this recipe.  As a note to those who serve it to vegetarians - please use an alternative to the Worcestershire as this ingredient has fish in it and is NOT vegetarian.

Ok so before you judge, I tweaked this quite a bit b/c of what I had on hand. But, for the record, it was this recipe that gave me the inspiration and my "version" turned out great!!!! I used 2 cans of chicken broth, about 1 cup of V8 juice (my subst. for the veggies since I had none), 1 can of garbanzo beans, 1 bay leaf, salt, pepper, paprika, curry powder, garlic powder (all to taste) and the 1/2 tsp. of Worcestershire sauce. I put all this in a pot, allowed to boil, turned down to med/low-low for about 50 min. poured over white rice and had kielbasa slices fried. This was a quick, easy meal and all 4 kids (2yrs-8yrs) loved it!

I love it! So hearty and flavorful, and easy to make. I used beans that I had on hand, so I substituted kidney beans. And 10 minutes before serving I rolled and chiffonaded fresh baby spinach then added to the pot. This soup was a big hit with family and my friends at work.

This is a great recipe and lends itself to all sorts of interesting variations; I read many of those offered in the reviews and came up with my own version, based on what I had. I made stock from a leftover smoked pork shoulder bone, adding onion, carrot, celery, bay leaves and some dried mushrooms. I chopped the mushrooms and added them back to the (strained and defatted) stock along with chopped carrots, red bell pepper and zucchini. Then I added canned tomatoes and canellini beans, some leftover barley mushroom pilaf, and seasoned it with hot curry powder, paprika, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, salt and pepper (I omitted the sugar). It tastes delicious, has a nice kick and I have lots of leftovers. Thanks, Beaker!

This soup is so easy to make and delicious! Great recipe. I'm making this for the second time today, and the only mod is adding a shake of crushed red pepper for some zing!  This will definitely become one of my standard vegetarian soups, along with Ina Garten's Split Pea Soup (made veg style) and Inn at Little Washington's red pepper soup (made veg style)

Great Recipe!!  I used 1 quart chicken broth, 1 quart water with 8 beef bullion cubes for the broth.  I added 2 cooked cubed chicken thighs, and a yellow squash and eggplant to the recipe.  I think the combination of the curry powder and the worcestershire sauce is what makes it.  So interesting!

I love this hearty and healthy dish. I rinsed the barley a few times before and it did not get overly thick. I also substituted the veggie broth with beef broth and added a teaspoon of cayenne and a tablespoon of chili powder.

I have made this many times and it is delicious.  It has become a go-to soup for me. I typically cook it in the crockpot on low all night.  The zucchini will break down if you cook it that long in a crock pot so mixing those in at the end works better.  I also add whatever veggies I have on hand, usually broccoli and mushrooms.  Also add 1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes to give it a little kick.  I absolutely love this recipe. Thank you Beaker1!

This recipe was so easy and the soup turned out perfect! This recipe makes enough that my small family of 3 could eat it for lunch and/or dinner for several days and we enjoyed it every day Also, I was skeptical that cooking the barley in the soup would make it turn out mushy, but it still had that delicious chewy texture I love. I used fresh parsley, a half jar of left over tomato basil spaghetti sauce instead of chopped tomatoes and added mushrooms and peas to mine leaving the chickpeas out. Yum!

Great recipe!  I love when I have everything in my kitchen for a recipe!  I sauteed the onion, carrot, celery and a clove of garlic (minced)for about 5 minutes.  I used 4 cups water and 4 cups vegetable broth(pre-warmed in microwave) and put everything in my slow cooker on low for about 4 hours.  I bumped it up to high in the last hour to finish off the barley.  We all love it, including the kids!!  Thank you!

This was a very good and simple recipe. Soup came out very good....very rich and tasty....I modified slightly by using mushrooms, yellow squash instead of zucchini and I forgot to add the garbanzo beans..(i think the beans would have been over kill.

Also, i rough cut the vegetables for the stock and then discarded them after 90 minutes and added fresh diced veggies after....I hate mushy vegies in my soup. (also forgot the worchestire sauce...but the soup did not lack at all for taste and aroma.

I  loved this recipe. It was packed with so much flavor that we did not miss meat. I could hardly wait to make it again!

I made as is, including all the spices.  I did not have bay leaves nor parsley.   I added green & red pepper, as well as a hand full of green beans.  I first sautéd the vegetables in a bit of olive oil to make them sweat and bring out flavor. This recipe is a keeper.

I made this soup for a family dinner which has one vegan and the flavor of the soup was great with out celery. I made some changes to it the second time because well I don't like cooked carrots and im not vegan. I used chicken broth, parsnips, turnips, and rutabagas. Also i didn't put the zucchini in till just before i served it so that it wouldn't be mush. yummy

Excellent seasoning--and you can add or leave out whatever you choose without sacrificing flavor, in my opinion! I use chicken broth and Great Northern or white kidney beans if I don't have garbanzos. Also added a few drops of Louisiana hot sauce the last time I made it--we loved that addition! Easy to throw all ingredients in the crockpot, set it on high for 5 hours and you've got a healthy and tasty meal. Thank you for the recipe!

This soup is SO GOOD. I followed the recipe exactly and I won't change a thing next time either. Since I became vegetarian one of the things I always really miss is beef barley soup, but this soup is even better! It does have a bit of a kick so if you're really averse to spicy you might want to cut back on the black pepper/curry powder/paprika, but it was perfect for me. So delicious, simple to make, and filling and nutritious too. I really can't rate this highly enough.

Ah-mazing. Can't believe a soup can have so much flavor in just a small amount of time. Per other reviews, I put less barley in (or more broth) because I don't like my soup toooo thick. Made it a few times w/out the curry powder bc I didn't have it, and I must say I think I like it better that way. But even as is....still delicious!!!

Made this is the crockpot using what I had around the house so did not use carrots, celery, zucchini or curry powder.   Since my husband simply can't eat anything vegetarian I added some diced Hungarian bacon and used about a cup of beef broth mixed with Italian herbs that I had leftover from making Italian beef sandwiches. I added another cup of broth later but that's all the liquid I used.

This is an excellent soup.  I substituted the zucchini for extra carrots and celery.  I also eliminated the tsp of salt, used no-salt vegetable broth and low-salt worcesterhire sauce. The other flavors were strong enough that salt wasn't missed in this soup.  So healthy and tasty!

This soup was great.  I love barley and the combination of barley and chick peas is excellent.  The recipe looks great as written, but I made a couple changes, since I am not vegetarian.  1) Used beef broth - Swansons  2) Used fresh garlic and lots of fresh parsley 3) added one pound of browned, thinly sliced sweet Italian sausage.  Also, I had no regular paprika on hand, and used smoked paprika, which went well with all the other flavors.  Note: with the addition of sausage, there is no need to add extra salt.

Really good! I was surprised at how much flavor this soup had. I added some chicken for protein and a little extra garlic and used pinto beans instead of garbanzo beans since that was all I had. It was thick and filling. Loved it!

I made this with beefstock & added celery & baby bella mushrooms. Made it in the crockpot & cooked on 8 hour setting. About hour 6 it got nice & thick.  I thought it needed a little something, so I added a glug of dry sherry...mmm just right!

I've made this soup twice the past month, and everyone (including my friends at work who are not vegetarian) said it was good and filling.  One change I made was to add a can of white beans for a bit of extra protein.  We're having a cold snap here in Arizona, so I decided to make soup tomorrow.  I asked my husband what he wanted and he said to make this recipe...it's a hit!

Used 1 pkg beef broth and water as out of veg stock. No zucchini or garbonzo beans so used leftover green&yellow beans, and rinsed chick peas. Also used 3/4 c barley, 1/3 c each of rice and macaroni. Left all other spices the same. Excellent soup! Had to be watered down some b/c of thickness but great. Comment was correct re pepper - don't used fresh ground -- too hot so use ordinary. Loved this one!

We liked this for a think soup. I cut the recipe in half, except for the tomatoes, and I used chicken broth and threw in the shredded breast meat of some left over chicken. It was a simple "meal-in-a-pot" dinner.

This came out really good.
I changed the veggies to what I had on hand and followed the rest of the recipe. I used potatoes, kale and turnip. I used 3/4 cup barley and there was plenty of broth. I will definitely make this again.

This was way better than I thought it would be.  I was expecting my kids (ages 4, 6 and 9) to reject it, but 2 out of 3 really loved it.  The little one didn't love it, but she ate it.  Anyway, I made it exactly as written and give it 4 stars.  I think there's way too much salt and I would skip the sugar altogether.  I would also add more veggies next time.  I might even back off on some of the other spices.  I would definitely make it again though!

Holy cow this might be my new favorite soup!!! I followed the recipe to the letter but I did add about 5 oz. browned ground beef just for some extra texture and protein.

I took a fairly loose approach to this recipe, using the vegetables I had on hand. Very good soup. It was thick, but I just added water each time I heated some up.

Very tasty.  I added a bit of cut up yellow squash and zucchini to add a few more veggies.  A few minutes before taking it off the stove I also added some swiss chard to add some greens.  I'll definitely make this again.

Delicious! I learned that I don't absolutely love barley, but that is just me, and it was still very, very good. I may substitute the barley for kidney beans next time, however.

Very easy, even for this inexperienced cook.

This recipe is great as is, but I did make a couple of changes the second time and liked it even more. Like other reviewers, I used real garlic instead of garlic powder. I also added in about two teaspoons of dill and that seemed to really kick up the flavor.

This was awesome! I've already made it twice and it's my husbands new favorite! The second time I made it I altered the recipe by adding red peppers to the veggies and used fresh sauteed minced garlic instead of powder. I also used 1/2 paprika and 1/2 hungarian (spicy) paprika and left out the sugar to give it a little kick.

Wonderful flavor. Very hearty - perfect on a cold winter day! I added some chuck roast for my non-vegetarian family members.  I also added more broth, so a touch more of the spices to keep the full flavor. This one will bring the cook compliments!

This soup is FANTASTIC!!! I made it as directed the first time but made a slight change the second time: I sauteed the vegies in olive oil until the onions were translucent prior to adding the broth and spices (just started adding the veggies to the pot as I chopped them - starting with the onion and ending with the zucchini). Also I used frsh garlic rather than powder, more celery and carrots, 2 zucchini,  and used No-Chicken Broth (it's a vegan version of chicken broth) instead of veg broth.
This makes a ton but freezes really well and just tastes better the longer it sits. Great recipe!

I love this recipe! What a hearty, filling soup. I altered the recipe a tad for my liking, adding two diced potatoes and subbing out the Worcestershire for balsamic vinegar so the recipe would stay vegan. I also added 1 tsp of red pepper flakes to add spice. And instead of using two carrots or celery sticks, I used four large carrots, sliced, and an entire stalk of celery. I also sauteed the celery and onion in the bottom of the pot before adding the rest of the ingredients. Like a lot of the other reviews, I also found the soup extremely thick, so if you're looking for something more broth-y, either add an extra half quart of broth (or water) or sub out some of the barley. Also, this makes way more than 8 servings - I'm going to be eating it all week. Five star recipe! I can't wait to experiment with it.

Made this recipe almost as written.  Substituted one minced fresh garlic clove for the garlic powder.  Also in addition to the vegetables listed, I also added one turnip and about a fourth cup of rutabaga (neither of which I have ever cooked with before....when I was shopping I confused this recipe with another and so had bought a turnip and rutabaga - so threw them in).  Also I am so used to cooking the aromatics first that it seemed wrong to me  to just boil them all.  So I cooked the garlic, onion, celery and carrot in some olive oil first, then added the rest of the fresh veggies and cooked them a while, then added the remaining ingredients.  After cooking as indicated it wasn't like soup any more.  It was like a solid! Maybe the extra veggies I added.   So I stirred in about 8 oz more water to make it soup-like again, and cooked it just a little bit longer.  When I tasted it I was unimpressed.  It smelled a lot better than it tasted, and the flavor was bland.  Then I figured out that the extra glass of water has diluted it, so I added about 1/2 tsp of all of the spices, including garlic powder.  That made it taste really, really good.  I especially like the combination of curry and worcestershire sauce, sugar and salt - made the flavor very different than anything I've ever tasted.  So for my attempt at cooking with Barley, I would say not bad at all.

Loved this soup and so did my teenage daughter.  As you can tell by my user name, I'm not a good cook, but I followed this precisely and it was awesome.  I did not have curry powder and used fresh garlic, but other than that, to the letter.  I did not have an issue with it being too thick, it was a good soup consistency.

This soup is awesome! I left in all seasonings as written but added 2 extra cups water. I had a chayote squash and a sweet potato so I threw those in and it was great! It's really the spices and seasoning that give it flavor so any veggies will do I'm sure. It yields quite a bit so I froze the extra for another time.

Made as written and my mouth was burning after eating. Spice overload! It wasn't terrible but I think I would need to leave out 3 or 4 spices next time!

It's quick, easy, and so delicious. We use 3/4 cup of instant barley and it turns out great and thinner (which we prefer). We serve with fresh oven-warmed bread from the bakery. You can't go wrong.

All 4 of us loved this vegetable barley soup!  I left out the garbanzo beans (because I didn't have any) and it was still wonderful...will definetly be making this more often.

Very good soup.  I actually put everything in my slow cooker and let it cook all day.  It was a great meal at the end of the day and took very little effort to make.

This soup is so simple but it is DELICIOUS!  My husband and parents loved it.  I've made it twice now, once with quinoa instead of barley which made it even more nutritious and yummy.  This is our "go-to" veggie soup from now on - thanks for sharing!!

I was sick and I found this recipe and it was perfect... I've never made soup before so I just used it as a guide, didn't follow it exactly. So tasty, filling, healthy, and soothing when you're sick. I'm actually making more now because the first time I made it it went fast!

This was a great base recipe!!  I didn't have a can of diced tomatoes, so I threw in a jar of salsa  instead.  Gave it a kick that I liked!  I also threw in random veggies, but the seasoning and ratios are perfect.

Not bad but not one of my fave's. Soup was too thick and I needed to add a fair bit of water & stock to thin it to a soup like consistancy. Flavour was ok but not really for my tastebuds.

Great soup with a nice flavor!  I liked how thick it was.  I didn't have celery, so substituted red pepper, and it was great.  I might use fresh garlic next time and maybe a little more curry (we like curry at our house), but the taste was really good as printed.

This is great and a staple for us now! I usually do halve the amount of barley because I like to have leftovers and the barley absorbs so much broth if left in the fridge. Otherwise, perfect!

This recipe is excellent just the way it is! I've tried it with bigger pieces of veggies and also with very tiny (food processor) veggies. Both ways is awesome. We like to eat it with some lemon juice. It is very filling and makes a very healthy meal.

Very good and hearty soup. Perfect for a rainy day. Its very thick and filling. I did do a few things differently. Instead of a can of tomatoes ( I really don’t like cooked tomatoes) I grated 2 tomatoes and added a ½ a can of tomatoes sauce. I used ½ a can of garbanzo beans, and 1 TB of minced garlic instead of the powder.  In the beginning, there was a lot of foam on the top of the soup ( I am not sure if this is because of the grated tomatoes or garbanzo beans), I Used a slotted spoon to remove it.  I did not cook it for 90 minutes. It was ready in 40 minutes.

I didn't have curry so I made up my own (coriander, turmeric, cayenne, & cumin).  I also couldn't use Worcestershire because my husband is a vegetarian, so I substituted some balsamic vinegar.  It was delicious!  This is one of the best soups I've ever made.

great soup, perfect as is. You can use chicken stock if you aren't too fond of vegetable stock. We used dried chickpeas which I find have a lot more flavor, but a pain, you need to soak and cook in advance which is why canned is so much more convenient.

So, I didn't have vegetable broth so I ended up putting a bunch of stuff in the food processor and letting it cook in the water for a hour. I then strained to make a nice clear broth. I then started the cooking process, the only thing I did different was I added the barley the last 30  mins of cooking and also threw in some leftover shredded turkey. This soup was so good, it was my first time cooking with barely and I am surprised by it. I was expecting a oatmeal texture in my soup, but it was more like rice. With the addition of turkey this soup is a 5 stare recipe. Tasted like a really good chicken noodle soup.

This was super easy, so hearty and tasty.  I used tomato paste (lazy -- we don't have canned tomatoes where I live).  I also used cabbage instead of zucchinie since that's what I had on hand.  I forgot the garanzos and wouldn't put them in next time, I think.

This soup is absolutely fantastic! I made a few changes accordingly to our taste: I sautéed 3 gloves of garlic, onions, celery and carrots with olive oil. Once done, I added the chicken broth and all the other ingredients. Some reviewers advised that this soup was too thick, so I reduced the amount of barley to 3/4 cup and still was very thick. Next time I will add only 1/2 cup of barley. Thanks for this wonderful recipe, BEAKER1!!!

I made this soup over the weekend and it was SOOO great! I was a bit skeptical with the unusual combination of spices, but this was terrific! I did add a bit more broth, as suggested by others. I would like to try it in the slow cooker next time. The smell was amazing!

In an effort to eat healthier I thought I would try this soup.  It is good for what it is.....a "healthy" soup.  I would compare it to a good diner soup.  That being said, I will probably make it again but I just wasn't bowled over at the taste.

It smelled so good cooking that I burned my tonge tasting it when it was done!  Other than substituting brown rice for the barley (thought I had some so I didn't pick any up at the store), I made it as directed.  Will definitely make again, possibly with different veggies and maybe add beef or chicken.

I make 2 batches at a time and bring it to work for my lunch. As it thickens up, it makes for a very good reheated lunch. I also make usually an amish white bread to dip in it.

First of all, don't try this as a slow cooker recipe.   That probably contributed to the poor outcome.  I often improvise a little with spices, but for this one I had all the right spices so I actually took a measuring spoon out and followed the spices exactly.  I did use chicken broth as opposed to veg. broth.  Other changes -- no zucchini, no celery, no garbanzo beans.   Added kidney beans and small chunks of chicken.  But it's not the soup "chunks" that I worry about -- it's the broth that usually makes the soup for me, and this broth was just very strange.  Very non-flavorful, and the flavor it did have was odd.  I managed to eat one whole bowl with a heap of shredded mozzarella stirred in.  Husband didn't eat more than a few bites.

Wonderful recipe. I would follow directions precisely except: use fresh garlic, fresh tomatoes, puree the veggies and add fresh cilantro.

Wonderful flavor, we used cannelli beans since we  don't care for garbonzo's in soup.  Delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

This soup was a hit! I subbed the diced tomatoes with mild salsa, and added chili pepper and extra curry. The perfect balance of heat and flavor!

Easy and yummy.  Slight variation as I substituted the garbanzo beans with Pinto due to an allergy.  Great northern white bean would also be a nice choice.  I also opted for fresh garlic over powder.  Thickness of soup gave me little trouble although I did use closer to 3/4 cup of barley due to the warnings.    Very good.  My vegetarian friend gave it 5 stars!

I thought this recipe was excellent!  My family even liked it, and they loathe anything that doesn't have meat in it.  Changes I made included replacing the powdered garlic for fresh, adding mushrooms, taking a more liberal hand with the spices, and only using 1/2 cup of barley.    This will definitely become a staple of mine this winter!

Made soup as is and it was delicious!!  After a couple of days in the fridge, the curry brings out a little (very little) bite, which might be too much for little ones, but eaten right away, there's not problem.  Am adding this to our regular winter menu!

Not a bad soup, but I wasn't in love with the flavor.  It has some ingredients that are a little different from what I'm used to in soup (curry, worcestershire sauce, sugar).  I added an extra can of vegetable broth and the soup still came out super thick.

Awesome... I did add about 3 extra cups of water... based on other reviewer's recommendations, I used the crock pot, put it on high for about 5 hours.  It really is an amazing, soup.  Fed me and my boyfriend for 2 days, and there's still some left.

I had considered giving this soup 5 stars, (because it does turn out great) but I didn't because when I made it, it was missing something..then I found it. It needed some depth to the flavor. In the past I would add wine or sherry to my soups to kick it up a notch. Since I did not have any, I added some jelly, about a tablespoon. (an old trick of mine..sometimes I use fruit juice). Try it, it is what this recipe is missing. Add wine or a bit or jelly. I used Blackberry All fruit.

really great, it's nice to not have to saute the vegis first.  For a soup with no oil or butter, it was really great.  I did add a parmesan rind to the soup and it gave it a little more depth.  I also did 1 quart vegi broth and one quart chicken.

Thanks, Beaker, this is a very good barley soup recipe! I used homemade chicken stock instead of vegetable broth, and skipped the zucchini because I didn't have any around.  I had to add an extra quart of broth because the soup was extremely thick. This was very good and very flavorful. Even so, I'm not sure I will make it again; it was very good, but not "the best."

I rated this a 5 out of 5 in the soup category. It was a little high in sodium-- but other than that it was quite healthy and yummy! I used quick cooking barley and popped it in there about 15 minutes before the soup was done. Came out perfectly! I had plenty of broth! It was great with a mini loaf of artisan bread. mmmm.

This soup was excellent. I thought it was a bit thick but we didn't mind that. I made this recipe exactly as written and it was really good. I will however leave out the garbanzo beans next time becuase we didn't like the texture of them in the soup. Will make this again.

Verryyyy good. I did make some changes, however. I used chicken broth (this kind of defeats the purpose of "vegetable" soup), omitted the garbanzo beans and added potatoes. This is the second time I've made this, and it's still really good!

Having grown up on beef barley soup, I was looking for something with barley but without the beef. This recipe fits the bill. I made a few changes. I added extra veggies - green beans (freezer leftovers), mushrooms and yellow squash; made a few substitutions - pearl onions (freezer leftovers), 3 cloves of fresh garlic, and fresh parsley; used 3 quarts of broth to accommodate the extra veggies; left the barley the same but upped the spices to match the extra broth and veggies. I threw the whole thing in the crock pot (filled to the brim!) and let it simmer away. My family loves this soup.

This recipe is awesome!  As suggested I used 3/4 cup barley, I instead used kidney beans, and I didn't have curry powder, so I tossed in a handful of fresh cilantro.  It was perfect.  This recipe is very versatile and I look forward to making it again!

Absolutely delicious soup. To much pepper for my taste though. Just a pinch is enough or it over powers the rest of the tastes.

A really great vegetable barley soup recipe. I enjoyed the kick from the different seasonings. I cooked the veggies plus a little minced garlic in olive oil before adding the broth and only used 1/2 cup of barley. I wanted a soup-like consistency and I got it. Great tasting vegetarian source of protein. Will make again.

Very tasty.  My daughter is a vegetarian and she loved it.  It's a good source of protein and a great "heart healthy" soup.  I didn't have any zucchini so I left it out, but it would have been even better with it. I only used 3/4 c barley as suggested and it was the perfect amount.  I will make this again!

This was very hearty and good. I put everything in the crock pot on high for a 5 hours. It makes a lot and so simple to make.

This was really easy, shopping was the toughest part.  The barley absorbs a lot of liquid, so the leftovers are not really soup but are still wicked good.

This was very easy to make & my husband & I love it. I'll make it often. I used mostly organic vegetables  to make it & organic low sodium vegetable broth (low Sodium) Very filling & satisfiing.

I've made several 5-star rated recipes lately and they have all disappointed me. This one as well. Was not as flavorfully balanced as I had hoped. I made it exactly as written. All I could taste was pepper. The base seems very bland. My family ate it but didn't particularly love it. Probably won't make it again.

This soup is okay, but nothing special or amazing. It's easy to make, and quite versatile. I followed the recipe exactly, except I only cooked it one hour instead of 90 minutes. It makes a LOT!!!!

I'm so glad this recipe was featured for the recipe of the day. I was going to make pasta for lunch this week and really didn't want to. I saw this on the home page and thought I'd give it a try since I am a vegetarian. I just finished trying a bowl and it was really fantastic! I didn't have any curry or parsley flakes though, so I used cumin and dried basil. Probably bad substitutions, but it still came out great! Next time I'll try it exactly as the recipe says.

I love this recipe - it's one of our "standards" since finding it here at least a year ago.  It's SO filling and naturally low fat - an excellent vegetarian meal.

One of our favorites. I added extra broth (mushroom & chicken stock) and a bag of frozen mixed veggies. Also, when soup was ready before serving added I lb cooked sauage, 1 carmelized onion & 8 oz. can mushrooms.

We really enjoyed this soup!!  I used stewed tomatoes and left out the curry and it was excellent.  I even shared at work and got rave reviews.  Great for a thick soup that isn't cream based for healthy eating.

This soup is AMAZING.  Perfectly filling on a cold day.  I used chicken broth and threw in random leftover veggies to clear out the fridge.  The whole family loved it.

Absolutely fabulous on a cold day. I made a few modifications: no curry, paprika, worchestershire sauce or zukes.  I added 1/2 dried lentils and a cup of extra water.  I used brown sugar instead of white.  I also added 3 cups of frozen veggies and some Spike seasoning. I had some extra canned pumpkin so added a bit to the soup and it added a yummy new dimension. Thanks for the great soup, Beaker!

I've made this recipe many times using chicken broth or stock.  Was wondering if anyone has tried adding some cooked diced chicken.  Would like to make it into a hearty meal for company, but not sure how it would turn out.

Absolutely delicious and easy barley soup recipe.  I increased the amount of garlic powder, black pepper, and curry powder.  I also added more salt right before serving.  A nice way to top this off is to shred some fresh Parmesan over hot soup.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great soup.  We love our soup thick and full, it did not disappoint.  The only thing I omitted was the extra tsp of salt (we like to watch our intake). It does improve with time...so we were able to enjoy it for a few days.  Thanks for posting!

I had to makesome adaption since I live in Africa. Use more carrots than recommened since I had plenlty of them on hand. Had no squash so I used eggplant.  ALso added some coursely chopped cabbage.  About 2 cups. Added 2 tablespoons sunflower oil to it. Did not have the W. Sauce but the soup turned out great!  Seems the recipe says it is enough for 8 people but three of us finished the whole pot. We ate it with Southern Corn Bread.  it made a very satisfying and filling meal. Ummm! Just finished eating it now. Ummm!

A very tasty soup.  I thought that I would be unsatisfied without meat, but I didn't miss it at all.  The only change I made was that I substituted Chicken broth instead of the Vegetable broth.  Very good.  I will be making it again.

This is a very nice and very easy soup to make. Just put everything together then enjoy. You don't have to wait the full 90 minutes. 60 to 70 minutes should do the job. The salt was too much for me.. Next time I'll put less salt and everyone can season to taste when its served.
Some complains about thickness, it was no problem for me, I even put double the carrots and double the zucchini (skipped the celery, though.) Very filling this way, a satisfying dinner on its own. Froze the leftovers for later.

Excellent soup!!!  I froze tons of it for later.  It makes a really thick soup though, and I added 1 more cup of vegetable broth.  I suggest using a bit less barley, or use a lot more broth.

Very good soup. I tenderized some stew meat and cooked in a fry pan for 1-2 hours (brown w/flour then add hot water).  Used Navy or Great Northern beans. Extra water and beef bouillon need to be added.

My carnivore husband loved it, so it's a permanent addition in my collection!  I've made it several times with variations in veggies, and it turned out good each time.

A great jumping off point! I did 3/4 cup of barley and it was still too thick! I did 4 cups veggie stock, 1 can beef broth and 1 can chicken broth (low sodium for both). 

Could kick it up a couple notches on the spices - more garlic, curry, maybe some chili paste next time. 

Thanks for a hearty, healthy starer recipe!

Delicious soup!  I used only 1 bay leaf and that was plenty.  3 would have overpowered the rest of the soup for my tastes.  Delicious, this recipe will definately come in handy!

Really good soup!  I would even give it 5 stars but after it was all done, I didn't think the sugar was needed - a little too sweet.  Next time and there will be a next time, I will omit the sugar.  I forgot to add the zucchini but added it in the last 30 minutes and it turned out soft and perfect.  The next day this soup is more like a stew and just as good or better but thicker.  Our 15 month old loves it and it's easy to feed to him when it's thick.  Thanks for the recipe!

I doctored the recipe slightly, swapping green beans for the zucchini, adding mushrooms, and cooking for just over an hour....the soup turned out absolutely fantastic! I will definitely be making this again, thanks!

This is a fantastic recipe!  It's easy to prepare and very filling.  My husband, who is a meat lover, didn't even notice his favorite ingredient was missing!  I did use vegetable stock instead of broth, and I forgot the curry when I went shopping...still delicious!  Thanks for the recipe...it's now in my permanent collection.

I really liked this and have made it twice now. The second time, I added some mushrooms I had in the fridge. I also added an additional three cups of water/broth to thin it a bit. Next time I might saute the veggies before adding them to the pot to give it  deeper flavor.

This was really good-my dad doesn't like overwhelming tomato flavor, so that was good...not like minestrone (which, btw Jamie's Minestrone is the BEST)...I don't like Bay Leaves so I skipped that. Also omitted the Worc. sauce out of sheer laziness, but still thoroughly enjoyed. It's going into the repertoire. Thanks!

I love this soup! It is very hearty. I sub cabbage for celery and have used both kidney beans and lentals instead of garbonzos. I also added a pinch more of all of the spices and used chicken broth as it was what I had on hand. I puree a portion for my 16 month old and he loves it, too. Great with buiscits.

Fabulous Soup! I made this to cheer up some "nothing to do this weekend blues" and wow! The only thing I changed was it didn't need 90 minutes to simmer and I added 1 tsp of vegetable seasoning as an after thought. Thank you Beaker!

I followed the recipe exactly, and unlike others, I thought this was bland as written. I added another can of tomatoes and 1T of crushed red pepper flakes at the end and then it suited my taste much better (worth 4 stars this way). Also, I found that the barley was cooked after 1 hour of simmering, so I took the soup off the heat then so the veggies wouldn't get soggy. All in all, very good, warming, and easy! I love that you don't have to saute the veggies first. Next time I might throw in some shrimp or beef per other reviews.

This soup is so good and easy to make. The touch of curry really gives it great flavor. The only change that I made was to substitute fresh green beans for the zucchini.

I really enjoyed this soup!! I sauteed the onions, celery and carrots with a few cloves of garlic in a tablespoon of olive oil. Then I added the rest of the ingredients. I used beef broth instead of the vegetable broth. I threw in some fresh parsley and spinach. YUM!

This soup was easy to make, and definitely yummy. Very thick, almost like a stew, so use more broth if you don't like thick. I used chicken broth and it still tasted fine. Didn't use the Worcestershire, but I'm not really a fan to start with. Overall a great, easy soup. Will make it again and again.

I love this - it was my soup of winter 2009.  I made it 4 or 5 times.  I ate it for lunch, for dinner, my husband enjoyed it, even my 6 year old ate it.  I follow the recipes almost exclusively.  Thanks Beaker!

After reading the other reviews, I was ready to add additional seasoning to spice it up, BUT DON'T! I used Indian curry and fresh-cracked pepper. It was plenty zippy and really very good! My kids (who can take spicy foods) thought it was a bit too spicy, but I loved it! Will definitely be making this again.

Delicious!!  Great to find a hearty & filling meatless meal - I served it with crusty bread for dinner.  (We eat meat but this is a nice change.)  I was out of bay leaf and curry, but it was wonderful without them.  I used an extra can of veg. broth and it was still a very thick soup.  My 6-yr old helped me - she basically made it by herself except for some of the chopping.  It makes a lot, so now I have several individual portions in the freezer to take to work for lunch.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

Fabulous recipe!  I made very minor changes--more garbanzos, more tomatoes, etc.--and it tasted great with plenty of leftovers for work lunches.  My only criticism is that it was a little on the salty side for my taste, but that can be easily remedied the next time I make this.  Will also try in the slow cooker.

Tasty and DELICIOUS!  :-D  I loved this recipe--the blend of spices was perfect and it was very easy to make.  However, I do agree that it was almost a stew because it was so thick (I personally like it this way!) so if you want more of a soup, add more broth or water.  Thanks for the recipe!

This soup was fantastic! Easy to make and very tasty.  I sped up the cooking time by using a pressure cooker, it only took 12 minutes to cook.  I didn't have tomatoes but used green beans, and it was great.

This soup is hearty, healthy and excellent. The only thing I changed was I eliminated the curry.  At first I thought the spices were too dark, but as it cooked --- excellent!

This was a fantastic recipe! I substituted one part of the veggie broth with beef broth & used green beans instead of zucchini (none at the market!) - the soup was a little salty, so I suggest adding a little water to the broth to cut the saltiness. Overall, I loved this soup. It was filling & hearty and great on a cold winters night!

I made this great soup today and thought it was so easy and quick and good. I left out the zucchini and used l/2 cup barley so it would have lots of broth. I grated some fresh parmesan cheese over the top.

I recommend 25% more broth and 25% less barley.

Good soup, but next time I will use less barley or more broth.  It's a bit too thick for me, but good flavor.

Another 5 star recipe, a real compliment from my husband!  I made very few changes, used canned greens instead of zucchini, omitted sugar, used half Jamaican curry powder and half Garam Masala.  Also used barley and orzo cooked separately, and threw in some chinese take out rice that was in the fridge.  Made small meatballs and let them simmer in the pot.  A real winner, the seasonings are excellent, this was a meal in itself.  Thanks!

Very unique soup.  We enjoyed it a lot.  I used 1/2 cup barley successfully.  Next time I make this I will add a splash of soy sauce and a a little more broth.  Very good!

This was my first attempt at a vegetable soup and it was delicious! As suggested I sauteed chopped garlic and chopped onions first and then added the chicken broth to the pot. I also used 3/4 cup of barley and it was the perfect amount, not too thick at all. I eliminated the curry because I didn't have any, and replaced the zucchini with corn and added sliced mushrooms near the end of cooking.  It really was very simple and very tasty. My husband and sister both enjoyed this very much and can't wait for me to make it again!

I used quick cooking barley and added it during the last 10 minutes of cook time.  Delicious and great for a dreary afternoon.  Would be good with ground red pepper to make it a bit spicier.  I will make this again.

This was absolutely the best soup I have ever made.  I didn't change a thing.  I have never used curry before and was a little leery about it but I'm glad I got some.  I will make this soup many times.

This soup is very good, thick and tasty!  I made the following changes:  Used 3/4 cup of barley, omitted the tomatoes, celery and sugar, used 2 cloves of fresh garlic and added a can of yellow corn.  Instead of the spices, I used Emerill's Essence spice.  I omitted the Worcestershire sauce since I didn't have any on hand.  I'll sure  make this soup again.  Very, very good. Thanks!

I made this today and it was great!!! I didn't add the onion and i used some butter beans instead of garbanzo beans. It doesn't even need beans at all though. This soup tastes similar to what my grandmother from Pennsylvania used to make. Thanks Beaker for bringing back old memories. I'll be making this again!

Thanks for the great recipe.

This soup is wonderful!!! I didn't make any substitutions or changes and it was delicious, although perhaps next time I will add slightly less barley just to make it more broth-y.  Thanks for a great recipe, Beaker; I will definitely be making this again!
