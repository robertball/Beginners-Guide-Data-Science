good soup for a cold night. i had beef broth, carrots, and celery i needed to use and did an ingredient search. it is- simple, and delicious, as the name says. i made as is and tasted, mmmmm. then i added the other veggies i had- carrots, green beans. then some sausage. topped with croutons. there was plenty of broth. endless possibilities.

my fiance and i really enjoyed this simple soup.  i didn't have croutons, but they're not really necessary.  i will definitely make this soup again.  and remember...you add one cup of broth at a time.  that should help alleviate the problem of it not being soupy enough!

A decent basic soup to use as a starting point for creativity. The only change I made was the parsley (dried instead of fresh, since it is what I had). Thanks for the inspiration.

We substituted mixed vegetables for the celery and used brown rice instead of white, and it was delicious!  We intend to cut the butter by 1/2 Tbsp (or by 1 Tbsp for four servings), but this one is definitely a keeper, especially for cold nights!

Turned out to be more of a rice recipe than soup recipe.  Although it had a good taste, there wasn't enough liquid to make it soupy.

I agree with other reviews. This is a great base soup just add whatever you have in the fridge. I added carrots, green onions, roma tomatoes and some summer sausage. It ended up tasting like a jambalaya. The other reviews made me brave enough to try anything and it worked!
