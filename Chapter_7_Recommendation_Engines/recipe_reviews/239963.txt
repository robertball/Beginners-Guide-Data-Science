Four and a half stars if I could make that happen!
So easy! So tasty! Glad for the brown sugar option in the crust as I didn't have any powdered sugar. Such yummy googy goodness! Next time I will make a double batch!!

Mmmm! I was intrigued by the brown sugar in the crust, as well as the soaking of the raisins in the hot water to plump them up. My mother's recipe for butter tarts does the same thing with currants. This recipe was easy to put together, and the result is so good. It almost has a caramel undertone. I did have to bake for an additional 10 minutes to get to the bubbling point, but that could be my oven. Thanks for the great recipe!

Deliciously Yummy!  I have 4 very picky nieces, and they gobbled these down.  Very tasty.  I did add an additional egg and 1/3 c of corn syrup to what was listed, based on a current butter tart recipe that I use and love.  Everything else the same and soooo good!

The brown sugar in the crust is a great idea; it makes the crust moist and sweet. I did not have a 9 x 9 inch pan so I used my 8 x 8 but set the oven at 350 and the bubbling happened at 25 min. I loved the nutrition facts and I made sure I cut the squares in the same amounts as in a 9 x 9 pan.
Many thanks for this wonderful recipe!

Yummy,  I  covered the raisins in Marsala, brought it to a boil, once plumped up, I added a bit of water to cool them down.  I also substituted two teaspoons of Marsala for the vanilla.  Worked great.  Next time I will not add the water to the raisins after plumping with Marsala, but will just let them cool down naturally before draining and adding to the batter.  The Marsala I used was American, Cribarai, not the real Italian which would probably not work.

I really enjoyed this.  It tasted great but the middle was soft and liquidy and the edges were much chewier.  Hard to cut into squares but tasted great.

I made it with the addition of maple syrup(2Tsp) and no raisins.  It needs more cooking time. First 2 batches were puddings (with ice cream YUM) but the 3rd was cooked longer and a grand success. be careful to eat one is to eat and eat...

Dangerously delicious! And ridiculously simple. I made several batches for our church and they were all gone in record time -- everyone confessed to going back for seconds, thirds, ...

My goodness these are addictive and yummy!  I made them with my 4 year old and we had a blast.  The cooling at the end is definitely needed for them to "firm up" .  They first appear to be a gooey mess right out of the oven .  I will perhaps make them a day ahead for events to give them proper time to set and meld together into their ultimate awesomeness.  Thank you for the recipe!  I'm adding it as one of my "go-to" recipes for potlucks and brunches :)
