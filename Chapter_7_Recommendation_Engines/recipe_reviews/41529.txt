I cut back a bit on the sugar added, as most dried fruits have extra sugar in them to start with. Making this compote made the whole house smell wonderful. I served it with a fresh pound cake, and dollop of whipped cream...rave reviews!

I found this recipe to be very good and easy to make, especially as it does not call for cornstarch to thicken it, which I never have.  However, it is very, very sweet.  My brother, who is a much better cook than I am, suggests only using 1-2 tablespoons of brown sugar to cut the bitterness, and substituting water for the apple juice.  I'll try this next time.  Also, chopping the figs will make it easier to eat.

I had to modify this recipe to the ingredients I had on hand, but we loved it.
I used 1 cup fresh figs in place of the dried figs, pear nectar in place of the apple juice, and dried mango in place of the apricots.  I added lemon zest and served the compote over chicken cutlets.  It was fantastic.

This is a great dessert recipe for the winter.  I made it for a dinner party (without the sugar), served it over french vanilla ice cream with a biscotti and garnished with sprig of mint.  Everyone loved it.  

Thanks comments about the added sugar.  I made the recipe without any added sugar at all and it was still very sweet.

I used this as a template for apple compote. Basically for however much of the other fruit it called for, I just used apples. I also used water instead of the apple juice as recommended by another person, and I always add more cinnamon than it calls for. I did find that it was taking a long while to thicken so I added a bit of cornstarch to help it along. It may have been cause I used fresh apples instead of dried. I thought the end result tasted really good.

Serve warm over ice cream.  The fruit flavors complement each other perfectly and I can't imagine a better Winter blend of fruits!

Served warm with ice cream. Boyfriend raved about it, although we agreed less sugar would be better.
