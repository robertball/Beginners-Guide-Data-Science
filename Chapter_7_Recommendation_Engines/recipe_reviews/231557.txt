Didn't have zucchini & limiting potatoes...but I did use green peppers, corn, carrots, broccoli, shredded cabbage & homemade salsa.  Also added a little lean ground beef, browned first in oil w/onions, chopped cremini mushrooms & seasonings, added some homemade beef broth for extra flavor. Served w/a tsp of sour cream & some homemade corn tortillas...Great recipe & love the versatility.  Really hit the spot on a cold snowy day! Thanks for sharing this!

4.5 Only had 3 cups of  mild salsa so adjusted ingredients accordingly.  Didn't have chili seasoning so added cumin.  VERY nice indeed!
