I really liked this recipe, only I changed a couple of things. I had my pork in the slow cooker on high for about 5 hours. The pork was easy to pull with 2 forks. I tasted the sauce, and it was good, only I found it was a little on the sweet side. I added a little bbq sauce to it at the end, and it was perfect! Served on Kaiser buns - yummy! Oh and I omitted the oil, it wasn't needed.

Delicious. The only suggestion I'd make is to make it the day before. Since the cooking sauce is rather thin, I'd take the meat out, shred it, and with just a bit of the sauce, refrigerate it overnight. Then the next day, skim the fat off for a healthier meal. I served mine on buns with, if desired, a bit of KC Masterpiece barbeque sauce. For a great meal, serve with this site's Sweet Restaurant Slaw. The combination can't be beat!

I used a 4 1/2 lb. boston butt pork roast and cooked on low for 8 hrs. and it shredded so easily and tasted good but a bit too sweet. I skipped the step of browning it first and don't think it made any difference. But this isn't a BBQ Pork sandwich which is what I was going for. So after shredding the roast I poured the liquid out of my crockpot and put the shredded pork in with a bottle of BBQ sauce, stirred, and cooked till warmed through. MM MM MM good. My husband was so impressed. This tasted just as good as anything we could get at a BBQ restaurant. And it reheats easily and tastes just as good the next day. As for this recipe, it makes a good pork sandwich but I prefer something a little zestier. And I would reduce the brown sugar to 2 Tbs. since the sweetness was too much. I would highly recommend this recipe.

This pulled pork recipe was awesome! I've been looking for a way to clean out my pantry and when I saw this, I realized I had all the ingredients on hand. But I added a little bit of liquid smoke to this to help it out and when I browned the pork I added oil with lots of salt and pepper for flavor. The sauce is a sweeter BBQ sauce, but I thought it was perfect - so good! The directions say to take the meat out and cut it but I couldn't even take it out without it falling apart on me! I cooked it for about 6-7 hours on high and wow it was amazing. And since I couldn't take the meat out of the crockpot, I just used a knife to shred the meat right in there instead of having to dirty another dish.

Great recipe! I took out the meat after 8 hours and pulled the pork apart. Then put it back in the juices for another hour. This kept it very moist because the sause is very thin. I then drained most of the juice and added a half bottle of BBQ sause and a 1/4 cup of Franks Hot Sause.  Best pulled pork i have ever made. Will be making this again very soon!

I made this for this year's superbowl party we hosted.  Let's just say I didn't have any left overs- or even get to try it myself!!  Everyone raved about it and said it's even better than Famous Dave's.

Delicious! I added a few splashes of liquid smoke to it. It was done in about 6-7 hours on high. My husband loved it and asked to add it to our regular rotation. Thanks  :)

Excellent pulled pork recipe!  The shoulder roast came out so tender I barely had to work to shred the meat.  I like a little smokey barbecue flavor in my pulled pork, so after shredding the meat and placing it back in the crockpot, I added about a 1/3 C. of my favorite barbecue sauce and then let the mixture continue to simmer while I fried my potatoes for french fries and set the table.  It was to die for!

De-lic-ious.....
Wow, great recipe.

I cooked it on low for 8 hours, pulled the pork apart and put it back in for 1 hour with about half a bottle of BBQ sauce.  Very tasty!!

I'm going to try cooking it on high for 4 hours next time to see if there is any difference.

Even our young children who are picky eaters enjoyed it.

This recipe was amazing when I added the bbq sauce - just 1/4 cup did the trick. Without the bbq sauce it was a little bland. My family loved it!

I made this for my husband, father in law, and a friend one day. It took just about 9 hours to cook, and it's worth the wait! Delicious and easy.

WOW!  Couldn't be simpler and oh-so-tasty!  I could only get a pork butt roast at our store and that was just fine.  I didn't brown my pork first, and it seemed just fine to me.  Added a tablespoon of garlic and brown mustard, just for some tang.  Next time I want to add a bit of Liquid Smoke for some depth.  This is not your typical BBQ pork - DH still put BBQ sauce on his sandwiches - but this gives it such a delightful seasoned flavor.  We'll be making this all the time!

I have made this recipe several times as it's written. We all LOVE it! However, I have just found it on here & see many people add a bit of BBQ sauce to it, so I'm going to have to try that tonight....as I'm making this for dinner. Have not found it to be too thin of a sauce, except for one occasion. I do use a larger shoulder roast then it calls for, but leave all other measurements as written. My family likes the sweet flavor of it too.  This is a very easy recipe, and me & my family love the flavor of it! Have even been asked for the recipe several times from others.

I am lazy and skipped the browning of the meat in the pan and it tasted just fine.  I couldn't find the condensed french onion soup at the grocery store so I substituted an envelope onion soup mix.  I figured that if I used half the water that the onion soup called for it would make the soup "condensed".  Well that ended up being WAY too much water.  If I made it again this way I would probably add somewhere between 1/4 -1/2 cup water instead of the 2 cups that I tried.  My butt roast was 5 1/2 lbs so I put 1.5 times all the other ingredients.  The flavor was wonderful but a little milder than I was looking for.  It probably would have had a fuller flavor if I hadn't watered it down so much.  I will look for this condensed french onion soup at a difference grocery store before making again, but if I can't find it, I will still make again using the packet and less water.  I made Uncle Earl's NC BBQ sauce to go with the meat and that tasted really good because the sauce ingredients were similar to what the roast was cooking in.

Great recipe - but had to make a couple changes, as recommended by others.  
I did not cook the roast first, just put it in the crock-pot with the sauce and let it cook on low overnight.  Then I set it aside until the crock cooled, and put it in the fridge about 6 hours while I did other chores.  It was easy to remove all the hardened fat then, and the pork was still tender enough to pull apart easily with forks.
The sauce is VERY runny, I left the pork in it but added BBQ sauce for serving it to the guys.
Flavor is great, it went over very well.  I fed 5 guys after a day of working on the ranch and had enough left for about 2 sandwiches the next day, it re-heated very well.
Thanks for sharing!

This was really good even if it is a bit sweeter than we normally like for pulled pork. Instead of sandwiches, the pork was so tender and there was so much liquid, we ended up spooning it over rice for our main dish.

So Good!  I made this for my hubby as a surprise to try something new. We both loved it so much that I made it for his family the following weekend.  I love how easy this recipe is.  We added Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce on the bun for the BBQ craving.  The second time I made it I cooked it the day before with a little less vinegar and a little more brown sugar.  I also scraped off the grease from the top that settled in the fridge over night.  My hubbies family was impressed.

WOW!  I just recently starting eating pork so I've been looking for yummy and easy recipes to try.  This was AMAZING!  I slow cooked mine on LOW for 12 hours then added some BBQ sauce before serving.  I will cut this recipe in half next time though.  For now, my family only consists of me, my husband and our two-year-old.  We would have to have this for at least four meals to eat it all.  I served it with baked beans and potato salad.  YUMMY!

I made these for a bachelor party with about a dozen guys and they ate it all, so I didn't get to try it other than a quick sample to make sure it was okay before putting it out.  My husband told me the next day they were awesome, though, and he's usually extremely honest with recommendations for making our recipes better.  I doubled the meat but left the rest of the ingredients the same.  When it was done there was still a lot of extra juice, so I ladled out about 2/3 of the juices (and an amazing amount of fat) and then served it in the crockpot with barbeque sauce on the side for the boys to add, since they really like bbq pork sandwiches a little more.  It worked great and was super easy without a lot of prep.

Took a long time to be able to get the pork "pullable".  But other than that, the recipe for the sauce was excellent.  My husband was a huge fan and couldn't wait to bring the leftovers to work with him today.

I made this with a 4.6 lb. pork shoulder roast and cooked on low for nearly 9 hours.  It was very tender.  The sauce was thin though and not really a pork barbecue but then it never said it was.  The sauce was fatty too even though I browned my meat first.  I did as others suggested and refrigerated overnight in the juice.  The next day I threw away the juice and added a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray and 1/2 bottle of Open Pit Original to reheat the shredded meat.  It was very good and easy so I will definitely make it again.

Made this recipe EXACTLY as stated (hate it when people rate a recipe that they've changed drastically) and in a word - AWESOME! So easy and oh so good. The meat literally fell apart (barely had to shred it) and it was delicious. The only thing I would change the next time I make it, which will be soon, is to add a little salt. But that's it as this was perfect as is. Make this reipe...you won't be sorry. Enjoy!

This was OK, but not great. The flavor was kind of bland for my tastes. I think I'll spice it up a bit next time. Plus, using a shoulder roast left the final product pretty fatty. I might use a pork loin next time to cut down on the greasy slime. Definitely a work in progress.

I made this today for a family gathering.  I purchased 7 lbs. of pork tenderloin; the butcher told me the tenderloin would fall apart better.  I did not alter the amount of the other ingredients.  Because I had 2 large pieces, I put them in a large roaster (the old blue speckled one) and put it in the oven at 250 degrees.  I thought that the cooking time would be 8 to 9 hours.  After 6 1/2 I checked, and the meat was falling apart.  I transferred it all to a 6 qt. Dutch oven and put it in the fridge overnight.  I pulled out the pan a couple hours before I needed it and heated it on low.  When it was fairly well heated, I added a bottle of barbeque sauce.  Just thought I wanted that flavor. 
   It was well received.

This is so easy and the end results are fabulous!  As a previously reviewer suggested, I omitted the brown sugar and added a bottle of my favorite BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's) to the pork after shredding as we like a thicker sauce.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Absolutely delicious! I used only one tbsp of brown sugar as others had said this recipe was too sweet but I think I will use more next time. Excellent for a crowd - I will definitely make again.

I did not use pork shoulder.  I used pork loin because that is all my grocer had.  I cooked on low for 8 hours.  It turned out very tender.  I did not really like the flavor.  It was to ketchupy.  If that's even a word!  :)  To remedy that I added liquid smoke and about a quarter cup of white vinegar.

It was very runny and not really sweet. Ended up adding ¼ molasses to see if that helped, it didn't. Added 3Tbsp of corn starch to see if that would help thicken it up, it didn't. With the molasses, it was almost sweet enough, maybe with more brown sugar and no soup, it might be ok. Looking for another recipe now.

I love this recipe. I've made it twice for parties and it was a big hit. I didn't skim any fat out of the broth, just put some, not all, of the same juices back in with the meat. I would agree w/ previous post, if you want to skim the fat out make it the day before because it takes a while for the broth to cool and separate.

I gotta be honest, I was expecting this to be good, but not THIS good!  Holy cow - this is perfectly seasoned, fall-apart-with-the-touch-of-the-fork yummy porkness.  I purchased a Boston butt roast because all the shoulder roasts were way too big, and it turned out amazing.  I would highly recommend this recipe, and it was SO easy!  I made some coleslaw (pkg of coleslaw mix, some mayo, cider vinegar and sugar) to go on the sandwiches as well, and it was the perfect complement.  You will not be disappointed with this recipe, as written.  Oh, and I also cooked mine at high for about 6 hours.

The sauce came out pretty thin after I left it in the slow cooker for 12 hours. I shredded the pork, took about 2 cups of the sauce in a saucepan with a bit more ketchup and some sea salt, then added a tablespoon of cornstarch. PUt the pulled meat back in the sauce and let it sit/marinade for another four hours until it cooled off. I placed it in the fridge and served it hte next nite. It was to die for!

We all enjoyed this. The kids ate it "as-is". My husband added some more BBQ/hot sauce when making his sandwich. I followed advice from other reviewers and was sure to add all the liquid  (minus any fatty chunks) from the slow cooker back into the meat after transferring it to the serving dish. We enjoyed it for several days until having to freeze some of it for future enjoyment.

I made this recipe twice.  I like recipes that I can take to work.  This recipe is difficult to take to work b/c it is really greasy.  At least 1/2" of grease sits on top of the pulled pork.  The first time I made this i pulled the pork and there was very little grease/sauce remained in the crock.  The second time I made it I decided to not pull the pork.  Then I decided to pull the pork later and the grease did not absorb as well.  When I opened my pyrex dish from the microwave at work and looked inside I had to spend much of my lunch time pouring the grease off, then wiping outside of the pyrex dish and being careful not to break it.  I will probably not make this dish again.  Ours had a good flavor b/c we added chopped: habeneros, red onions, and green & red peppers.  The one thing that is good about this recipe is that it is easy to prepare and it uses simple ingredients and Luis could make this dish w/o having to have patience w/ something a little more difficult such as a roux.

Good. Hard to pull meat apart, but tasted good.  Maybe needed to cook it longer or on high.

This recipe makes and keeps the pulled pork so moist. it is absolutely delicious, this will be my go-to recipe for pulled pork going forward. I do highly recommend to put some barbecue sauce on the top of the pork before eating.

Made this for family weekend at my parents and followed the recipe closely.  I added extra onions because that is a family preference,  but i thought it was very liquidy, but the family said it was perfect.  Mom even went back for seconds on my cooking.

My family and I loved this recipe!  I cooked on low for 8 hours and it fell apart! The few changes I made was: only adding 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and then a couple dashes of liquid smoke. After it was finished I drained half of the liquid out and added 1 cup of BBQ sauce. Mixed the shredded pork back in and WOW! The perfect amount of sweet and BBQ!

I replaced the ketchup with BBQ sauce and didn't bother browning the pork before it went into the slow cooker and it came out great!  I shredded the pork after having it on low for about 6 hours, then let it continue at that heat for another 2 hours.

This recipe is great because it is so easy and uses ingredients I readily have on hand.  I add some salt to help bring out the flavor and mellow out the sweetness.  The cooking juices can be cooked down and thickened to use as extra sauce on the sandwich.  It's also great served with Jack Daniel's Barbecue Sauce!

My husband and I really liked this recipe.  I used a pork loin trimmed of fat, did not brown the meat, and it was perfect.

I love this recipe! I made a couple of changes to the recipe by grilling the meat, adding liquid smoke and spices, and adding BBQ sauce on the sandwiches. See my custom version for details!

I serve this nearly every time I have a large gathering at my house. I also add barbecue sauce near the end of cooking to give it more barbecue flavor. I serve it on small hamburger buns and can usually get 16 servings out of one roast.

This recipe was phenominal! I cooked exactly as instructed and added some BBQ sauce before serving. It was delicious before adding the BBQ sauce! Thinking about using this recipe for a pot roast as well.
