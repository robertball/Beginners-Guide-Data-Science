I followed the recipe as written, but it didn't turn out as well as I'd hoped. The chicken was bland and a bit dry on the edges. I also didn't care for the butter flavor, but I usually use olive oil. Broiling caused a lot of smoke, and the end result wasn't worth the trouble. This is a good recipe to tweak, though,  so the next time I made it, I replace the butter with olive oil and mixed it with double the amount of garlic cloves (crushed). I then pounded the breasts to a uniform thickness and marinated them in the oil and garlic mixture for 30 minutes at room temp. I then used fresh herbs but doubled the amount except for the rosemary (used recipes's original amount as I'm not a big fan of rosemary) and added that to the chicken marinade and mixed well. I wrapped the chicken in aluminum foil and baked at 350 for 20 minutes, then opened the foil and broiled on high (my oven doesn't have broil temps, just high or low) with chicken on top rack to add some color. I then squeezed fresh lemon juice over the chicken just before serving. With my changes, I would give this five stars. The chicken was VERY juicy, and almost fall-apart tender. The lemon juice "brightens" the flavor. Garlic is a great tenderizer, and the marinating really gives it time to work, resulting in juicier, more tender chicken.

This chicken turned out absolutely wonderful! I took a few of the other reviewers suggestions. I used 1/4 cup of butter, melted it and then added the spices.  I punctured holes into the chicken so that the juices could really get inside.  It smelled wonderful coming out of my oven and was so very tender! The taste was incredible and it was so very easy and fast to make! This will definately become a regular in my house.

I've found the key to baking and broiling chicken and not having it dry out is to create a "roof" for the chicken by adding your herbs and garlic and then laying another vegetable over top; I always use onions.  If you top the whole thing with a tad of olive oil and a couple drops of worchestershire, the onions will caramelize and will also let their juices soak into the chicken.  Comes out awesome!

I've been making this recipe for years with a few differences - I use chicken breasts with skins and bones, dried spices from my spice rack and I skip the butter (decreasing the fat content of the dish) -  Just sprinkle the spices - garlic, sage, rosemary, thyme and parsley (salt and pepper too if you like) over the top of each breast (adjust the spices to your family's taste - this may take a few times to get it to your liking), then pop in the oven on a broiler pan sprayed with non-stick cooking spray with about 1 inch of water in the bottom, bake at 350 for about 1 1/2 hours (adjust cooking time for the size of the chicken breasts- tops should be deeply browned and crispy).  Remove from the oven and cover chicken, still on broiler pan, with aluminum foil for about 10 minutes and serve - you should have one of the most moist and delicious chicken dishes you've ever tasted.  The water in the bottom of the pan serves two purposes - one: it will decrease the chances of a grease fire in your oven and two: it evaporates ensuring an extremely moist piece of chicken.  The skin gets nice and crispy - I don't eat it but my kids can't wait to get their "crispy" -  I have also made this with boneless breasts - but my kids prefer the ones with skin.  This is an excellent way to cook chicken and the left overs make a delicious chicken salad. The house smells so good when you bake this chicken!!

I read the other reviews and altered the recipe which seemed to work well.  To lower calories but save flavor I mixed 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 melted butter instead of all butter.  I also warmed the garlic in the mixture so it infused it.  I baked wrapped in foil for 30 min. at 350 and then broiled for 7 minutes for color.  It turned out quite well!

I followed previous reviewers' advice and used 1/4 cup of butter which I melted and mixed with the herbs and garlic.  I used this mixture to baste the chicken regularly and it was delicious!

I originally looked at this recipe and thought "Ugh!  Way too much fat", but you can reduce the fat substantially without sacrificing flavor.  Simply take 2 TBSP butter, add the garlic and seasonings and place in microwave until butter is melted, then stir.  This "cooks" the seasonings into the butter.  Brush mixture onto chicken with basting brush, brush again when chicken is turned over.  A tasty recipe made more health friendly!

This recipe is similar to one I've been using for over 40 years.
Instead of mixing butter and herbs and then broiling the chicken.
I melt the butter, add herbs, then marinate the chicken for a few hours, then place on foil-lined pan and bake at 375 degrees for 45 min to 1 hr.
Absolutely great for a crowd, just increase chicken, etc. to fit the number of diners.

This recipe didn't go very well.  It created a whole lot of smoke and was not very flavorful.  If I HAD to make it again I would marinade the chicken overnight and cut the butter in half.  The only change I made was to add 2 tsp. of italian seasoning.  I highly recommend "Chicken Breasts With Herb Basting Sauce" instead of this recipe.  I will not be making this recipe again.

This was really wonderful! I used it on a whole chicken that I roasted. I placed some of the butter under the skin of the chicken breasts and spread the rest on the exterior of the chicken. It turned out very flavorful and juicy, and the garlic flavor was delicious, mellow and sweet. Thank you for the recipe, Heather!

I really enjoyed this chicken. However, I did make a few adjustments. First of all I didn't use any butter to make it healthier. I used 1/2 cup of e-virgin olive oil instead. I added about 1/8 cup of balsamic to the oil mixture along with 1 tsp of onion powder. I George Forman'd the chicken for about 5 minutes turning once. It was excellent. My boyfriend ate 2 big peices of this chicken. I served alongside freshly steamed green beans. Will definitely make this one again!!!! Oh and next time I will let it marinate for about 24 hours.

Yummy!!!  I too added less butter (actually I used Smart Balance) and I also squeezed some fresh lemon juice on the chicken as well as in the butter mixture.  I think lemon enhances the flavor of chicken tremendously!!  The chicken breast went so well with my sauted spinach in olive oil and garlic.  This is a great recipe for South Beach Diet as well as Atkins.

The taste was pretty good, but unfortunately the butter continually popped and splattered all over my broiler until my house was filled with smoke.  I'll try this again, but I think next time I'll bake it rather than broil it.

The butter sauce created was delicious!  But NOT for chicken.  More suited to lobster or shrimp.  I'd recommend making the butter/garlic/herb mixture again, but only for seafood.

My family really enjoyed this recipe!  I used a 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil instead of butter (for health reasons) and did 5 cloves of garlic instead of 3.  Before broiling the chicken, I poked it like crazy with a big fork so that the oil and herbs would seep into it.  I also salted them which helped to enhance the flavor.  Will definitely make again!

I took others' advice and cut the butter amount in half and melted it first and then poked holes in the chicken.  This is absolutely a wonderful, easy dish and smells so good cooking.  My boyfriend and I both loved it!  Thanks, Heather.

This was fantastic! I added salt, pepper and garlic salt. I made it in my toaster oven, VERY easy recipe for 2. The only thing I didn't notice anyone say, is be sure to use real butter, not spread or it will separate and nOt have the same taste. I am going to make broiled sirloin filets tonight and make it like this again! I may even use some of the butter to sautée the mushrooms for the steak!

I pounded my chicken to an even thickness (I always do) then marinaded it in Italian dressing for several hours. Then I took the advice of some reviewers & poked holes in it. I cut the butter in half, melted it & used fresh herbs (doubled the amount since they were fresh), poured it over the chicken & again on the advice of a reviewer, allowed it to sit for a few minutes before popping in the oven. Baked it, uncovered at 350 for 30 minutes, then turned the oven to 425 broil & broiled until it had a beautiful golden cast to it (about 7 or 8 minutes).  The chicken was very juicy & herby...which was good. I was going for an herby taste & who would complain about juicy chicken. ;o)  I started off w/ a Poisoned Apple cocktail, Butternut Squash Bisque as the first course, then served this dish w/ Smushed Apples &  Sweet Potatoes & steamed green beans... w/ Hot Scotch Cocoa for dessert. Thansk for your contribution to a great meal Heather!

I used powdered garlic and added powdered onion to, I also cut slits in the chicken before adding the butter mixture and let the mixture sit in the slits for a few minutes before grilling. The chicken came out really nice and was very tender and moist. This was great for a quicky meal, thanks.

the chicken was alright, i used olive oil instead of butter, twice as much garlic, and twice the herbs. i marinated the chicken in the olive oil and garlic for about 30 minutes, then added the herbs. if i made this chicken again i would marinate the chicken in the olive oil and three times as much garlic for a longer period of time to make sure it really got in there, then add in twice the herbs the recipe called for, cook without the aluminum foil then broil for some color on top :)

Very delicious! Although I found it called for more butter then necessary resulting in a grease fire in the pan. This added a nice flavour and the peices that had the fire close turned out the best!

This is a delicious recipe.  I add a bit of salt and pepper to each side of the chicken breast for a bit more flavor.  One word of caution.....butter will catch on fire in the oven if you are broiling so BE CAREFUL!

This chicken was great! I added salt and pepper to the butter, and grilled it on the barbeque. I brushed with a little more herb butter each time I flipped it, and it turned out great, soft and juicy! My husband said it tasted just like something you'd get at Olive Garden. Made me think that maybe next time I'll serve it with pasta and white alfredo sauce...

Thank-you Heather, this turned out great. I served with rice that I made with herbed chicken broth; steamed broccoli and carrots and; sauteed mushrooms, asparagus and garlic. Our dinner plates looked picture perfect(all we needed was to light the candles). PS: You dont need the whole half cup of butter i used 1/4 and it was fine. I also used fresh herbs. I may try to add bit of lemon juice next time as well. Delicious

Thought the seasonings were really good-next time will add more butter and may cook in skillet or covered casserole dish. Had trouble with the oven smoking from butter and broiler.

This was a good dish for a busy weekday supper.  Hubby was so surprised how fast I got dinner on the table last night.  You have to watch the temperature on your oven though as mine tends to be higher than most and halfway through I had to turn the temp down a bit to prevent everything from burning.  I also followed fellow reviewers' tips on poking holes in the chicken prior to pouring the butter on top...thank goodness!  It made quite the difference.  Served it with steamed parisienne potatoes and warm dinner rolls.

really easy and really good.  i was in a terrific hurry, so i used a skillet on medium high for about the same amount of time (9 mins one side, 7 on the other).  delicious and i agree with the rater who recommended to use with shrimp.

This is a very good broiled chicken breast. I onlyhad three breast halves so I just halved all of the other ingredients. I melted the butter first, added the herbs and brushed onto the chicken. I did make some slits in the breast as someone else had mentioned doing so the butter and seasoning get into the flesh. I think next time I will still halve the butter, but keep the seasonings the same as called for in the original recipe. This was quite tasty and very moist. Don't overcook!!

This was an amazing recipe.  I broiled on High on the 3rd rack for 15 min flipping once to season the other side of the chicken.  Then I moved it to the top rack to brown each side.   My Family loved it, even my 3 year old ate all I served him, and my husband couldn't get enough.  It's great for guests or for once a week!  Moist tender and great leftovers!

I used boneless skinless breasts and took advice to "tent" them to keep juices in.  I used sliced white onions on top.  The garlic and herbs were Great!  The chicken was a titch dry still, but my husband and I were happy.  I covered it completely for 20 min. and broiled it for 7 minutes.  Pretty and tasty.  Thank you for this simple recipe (without cheese or cans of soup!)

This recipe was very yummy. I had to substitute the rosemary and and thyme with oregano and basil, I also used dried minced garlic instead of fresh (1/4 tsp = 1 clove).

My fiance' liked it.  I thought that there was a little too much flavor from the thyme and rosemary.  I If I make it a gain I will put a little less herbs.

Quick & easy!  After 10 minutes, I turned the chicken and basted it again.  Be sure to pound the chicken breast  to 1 inch thickness for even cooking.

Very good.  I used a whole double breast of chicken.  To keep it from getting dry I added a "roof" like one of the other members suggested by adding a sliced zucchini on top-covering the whole chicken breast. I also cooked it in a round oven safe ceramic pot that was only a bit bigger than the breast itself to keep the juices from evaporating.  I also used 1/4 butter instead of half and added the juice of a lemon.

I found other reviewers comments helpful when making this dish.  I used olive oil instead of butter and marinated the chicken for about an hour before cooking.  I also wrapped it in foil and cooked it for about 30 minutes at 350 degrees and broiled for about 5 minutes to add color.  The chicken was a little dry.  May want to cook for 25 minutes and broil for 5.  I also topped with an Italian shredded cheese blend, nice addition.

People: The ONLY reason that chicken is dry is because it is OVERCOOKED.  Doesn't matter how it is cooked or what is applied to it, if you take it much past 165 degrees, it WILL be dry.  Check the USDA's website for recommended temps for all meats... and use an instant-read thermometer!    Now, that said, this recipe is nice, with a good herby flavor to the chicken, but didn't knock my socks off.  It did smoke a little, so I lowered my broiler temp and also the rack.  I served it with buttered sesame noodles and green beans with almonds.

This chicken came out amazing! I melted the butter, garlic & seasonings together in the microwave, cut slits in the chicken, brushed the butter mix all over both sides and into slits, and broiled for 10 mins, added shredded cheese and broiled another 5....so yummy! We make this all the time now!

Instead of using this on boneless chicken breasts, I used this on skin-on, bone-in breasts.  I put the butter inbetween the skin and the meat.  Roasted for 45 minutues basting with the pan juices every 10 minutes.  Came out extremely tender.  Served with Bella Rosemary Roasted Potatoes.

Smelled divine in the oven, but none of that flavor was imparted to the chicken. Left alot to be desired, but good if you like a little flavor.

15 minutes?!  Have you seen the size of chicken breasts lately?  My 4 chicken breast halves weighed 4 lbs. so they took about 35 mins.  They were still moist inside, fortunately, because my husband always knows when to pull them out of the oven. My oven didn't smoke at all.  I had the broiler set to 450, as there is no specified temp.  Broil can range from 400-550

As indicated, this was a pretty easy recipe to make.  I found that 1/2 cup of butter was too much, probably only needs 1/4 or so.  This might be a problem of mine only, but the melted butter produced alot of oil that sat on the pan and gradually burned under the broiler.  The result was some sparking and a fair amount of smoke.  Just a word of caution.  Overall it was pretty yummy, but I did find it a little bland and ended up adding some soy sauce at the table.

This was a good recipe.  I failed to read the reviews before making and should have reduced the butter amount to half.  I also used fresh herbs and it turned out very moist and delicious.  The house smelled wonderful.  Thanks for posting.

Awesome!!!!!! My family loved it. I pounded the chicken breasts and it was perfect. Even my queen of picky daughter loved it, she asked for seconds (history is being made). Thanks for the recipe. I took the suggestions the other reviews made and it was quick, easy and taste. The 3 things to great cooking and happy bellies.

This was really great!  I put all of the herbs together with the butter and then microwaved it to melt the butter.  I then injected this into the chicken and brushed the outside of the chicken with the remaining sauce and cooked the chicken in my rotisserie.  What a wonderful smell when cooking and the taste was just marvelous.

I'm a vegetarian so I didn't try this recipe myself, but I made it for my family (parents and younger brother; I'm in college) and it was a big hit.  The butter-herb mixture adds flavor without displeasing picky eaters (kids would probably like it a lot).  I'm trying to learn how to cook meat even though I don't eat it, and this was a good recipe for a beginner.

I made it home just before the winter weather struck our area. I needed a dinner that I could make with ingredients that I had on hand and stumbled upon this recipe. I made the recipe with the exact meaurements listed, the only things different was that I used chicken breast tenders and I baked it at 375 for about 37 minutes covered with foil. The sauce is very good. It would go great on top of brown rice. I served it with brussel sprouts this time for a low carb dinner and it was great as the brussel sprouts soaked up some of the butter sauce! Yum! Will defintely be worth a repeat!

Changed this a little. Used a packet of Italian Seasonings salad packet. This took much longer then the recipe called for - over 30 minutes. I would instead pound them much thinner and then they would probably take the said 15 minutes. This was not bad, but not amazing. My husband thought it was still too dry although I thought it was just right. The flavor should be more intensified and I would marinate the spices on it and then put the butter on top instead.

I didn't have a lot of success with this dish.  Didn't get much taste from the herbs.  Just tasted mostly like cooked chicken.

Easy and delicious! I used thin pieces of chicken breast so broiling it worked just fine. Can't wait to make it again.

I liked the taste of the butter and herbs and that this was so quick/easy to make.  The chicken was a little dry though and I thought it needed some salt.  I will try this recipe again and follow the other reviews to bake first and then broil for a few minutes at the end.

I tried this recipe because I had the ingredients on hand and the chicken turned out pretty good, I marinated it in oil and all the spices for 24 hours, and used fresh garlic, the chicken was very very tender and juicy but could have used a little more flavor.

Delicious! This was so good and really simple to put together! I used 2 tbsp. of olive oil instead of butter and I let it marinate overnight and I made it on my indoor/stove top grill pan. Fantastic!

cut butter not quite in half, and accidentally dumped in a bunch more rosemary than the recipe called for but it ended up being very tasty! With the broiler on, it started to smoke and pop a bunch so I covered the chicken in the tin foil and baked for a bit before uncovering and broiling at end. It takes a little longer this way, but you don't have to worry about the smoke.

This was a good recipe, but I would follow other posts by cutting down on butter (I used Smart Balance and it tasted fine) and the suggestion of baking first, then broiling - covering up at first with tin foil - is a smart choice. Chicken was tasty but a little dry. Next time I will do suggestion of wrapping chicken entirely in tin foil with slices of lemon. Should come out a little juicier.

I've made this chicken a few times for my family and friends. It is wonderful. I tend to make it over a bed of steamed jasmine rice with french cut green beans. I'm asked to make this dish for dinner constantly and is a favorite in my household.

This is super easy to whip up while making dinner to freeze for lunches for the week.  It smells awesome, and the only alterations I make is I add some kosher salt and onion powder and minced onions to the butter baste.  I also make a few slits into the chicken to make the baste soak in better and it turns out great and super juicy every time.

I am usually good about preparing dinner a day or morning in advance. Tonight I was so busy I forgot to think about dinner. This was the perfect last minute meal! I made on big chicken breast (only 2 of us) and broiled for 10 minutes. It came out nice and juicy.  I served with rice and left over broccoli.

Very, very good! I usually don't do well with broiled chicken but this time I baked it for about 15 minutes first then broiled. Extremely flavorful,juicy and easy preparation. Seasoned with Lawry's Seasoning Salt and Pepper first, then put in fridge for about an hour. Combined butter, garlic, parsley and thyme and put in microwave for 45 seconds then brushed mixture over chicken and under skin.(I used chicken pieces) All I can say is Oh my this is good!!

This chicken is fabulous - I add different herbs everytime and it is always delicious! Another good variation is to make this with the skin on as it makes the skin nice and crunchy.

Simple, quick and pleasing.  I'm not particularly fond spices that overwhelm, particularly rosemary, but the flavor was just enough for to appreciate and not overwhelmed.  My son thought it was tasty but not good enough to make him lick his lips or ask for seconds.  Maybe with the right accompaniments this would be perfect.  Definitely good enough to add to my favorites and make again.  Thanks.

i did not think it was as juicy as some say but the flavor was definitely good. i put small slits in the tops of the chicken (like someone had suggested) to help hold some of the juice and help it cook a little faster.  it was very quick and easy, i pre-made it and let it sit in the refrigerator untill it was ready to be put in the oven. very convienent

I added about 1/4 cup soy sauce and 2 tablespoons of sherry to the pan, added the garlic and herbs, then just put the butter in the pan, melted it in the oven, added the chicken, turning to coat, baked instead of broiled and basted often with a baster.  The soy and sherry kept the butter from burning.

I made this with two skin-on/bone-in breasts---a rarity for me, a boneless/skinless devotee (noting the recipe was for a whole chicken, but couldn't bear the commitment, I settled for bone-in breasts). I first marinated the two breasts with the juice of one-half lemon and one-half lime for 5 hours (it gave it a slight citrusy tang, next time I'll do one whole lemon or one whole lime). For the butter, I used half a stick and just slightly more than the 1/4 tsp. of rosemary and thyme, 3 cloves of garlic as suggested, plus a dash of garlic powder and onion powder, as well as a pinch of salt and pepper. I let the butter refrigerate (for ease of placement) and put most of it underneath the skin of the breasts. I generously paprikaed the bottom of the breasts, as well as s&p, then baked for about an hour. Halfway through baking, I put approx. 4 pats of butter on top of each breast and basted every 10 min. throughout as the chicken looked parched. Bottom line: good recipe, add some salt, baste throughout. Served it with sauteed spinach---good for South Beach dieters. Feel free to experiment with this one, it's very forgiving as long as you keep the chicken moist.

This chicken turned out great!  It cooked very quickly and turned out quite juicy.  I like a lot of flavor in my food, so I marinated the chicken for a little bit with lime and salt and I also added 1 tsp. of dried cilantro, because I love it so.  I will definitely make it again!

Good chicken.  We used a butter spread, which made it easier stirring the spices in. Very moist!

This was so easy to make and very tasty, too!  It was a terrific change from the usual herbed chicken recipes.  Broiling the chicken gave it a nice flavor.  I used bone-in but skinless chicken and they came out great!  This is definitly a do-over at my house. Hubby really liked it and my finicky 14-month old gobbled it up!

Found this recipe when looking for quick and easy.  I used about 3/4 the butter and added one clove of real garlic instead.  I also melted the butter ahead of time.  Chicken was wonderful.  I even used reduced fat ritz crackers.  Very easy too!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was very easy and delicious.  I forgot to add the garlic and even though I love garlic, the chicken was nicely flavored.  An easy dinner when you don't have alot of ingredients to worry about!

Found this when I was searching for something quick and easy.
It was exactly that and absolutely delicious! The kids loved it also.
I tried it again and substituted rubbed sage for rosemary and it was
great. This is now a family favorite. Top recipe!

Very tasty.  Broiled in pan instead of broiling pan and poured leftover butter over chicken before serving.  Recipe similar to the chicken breasts stuffed with garlic butter that you buy at grocery store.

I took suggestions from various reviews and created my own. I baked the chicken in foil at 350 for 35 minutes. I also punctured the chicken to allow the herb/butter mixture to soak in more. 
In addition, I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup olive oil. As we didn't have any thyme, I doubled the rosemary (we love rosemary!). 
Next time I'm going to try marinating the chicken in the herb/butter mixture as well.

Have done simular to this, but slit and stuffed w/prosciutto, swiss & fresh spinach. Used herb butter to keep moist on outside. Trick for not drying out is to "tent" with alum. foil until last few minutes, will be nice and light brown, moist and tasty.

This was alright, a little bit too much herbs though. I like the taste of herbs, but not so much them grinding in my teeth. It was alright though, not bad. But I would probably opt to make chicken another way instead.

I can't find my broiler pan so I made this on the stovetop. Flavor was excellent but chicken was a tad dry, which is my fault. Thanks for the recipe.

I really liked the herbed butter, but for some reason it didn't make the chicken taste all that spectacular.  I think it would be better if the chicken marinated in it.  I put some of the butter mixture on mashed potatoes, which I would wholeheartedly recommend.

I have been looking for recipes that I could use pure olive oil instead of butter. My husband is trying the Mediterranean Diet, so I've been looking for ways to cut the butter out AND still having a favorful meal. What I changed: used 1/4 cup olive oil instead of butter. I didn't have boneless chicken breast so the bake time increased. I also covered pan with foil. I think that really help keep the chicken moist. Thank you very much for this recipe!

Read reviews so I wrapped chicken in foil & put under the broiler. Some butter must have leaked out so as I watched, within two minutes of putting chicken in, smoke and actual flames in oven. Shut off oven but kept chicken in it. A half hour later took it out and it was cooked thoroughly and very moist and yummy!  Won't do it again as the flames scared me!

This chicken was nice and juicy and had good mild flavour. However, it took 35 minutes on broil to cook. Even though i cooked it without foil it barely browned on top.

Easy and good.  I marinated a few hours and baked for 45 minutes at 375.  However, next time use olive oil as butter hardened when returned to fridge.  Doubled garlic (maybe a bit less). Made 11-13-08

This recipe was delicious. I melted the butter and used about 1/3 cup butter and then used canola oil to get to one cup. The recipe only gets 4 stars instead of 5 due to the smoke that was created, but I found that there is less smoke if you broil on low and turn/baste the chicken every 4-5 minutes.

We had this and thought it was really good, my daughter and I are both fussy eaters but we thoroughly enjoyed this chicken. When she says we should make it again then it has to be good. It was so juicy and flavourful. It did make the smoke detector go off a few times but nothing a tea towel couldn't take care of.

A good chicken recipe. Fairly easy and quick, plus it smells very good while in the oven. However, it's true, as some other reviewers mentioned, that the chicken itself seems to lack a bit of flavour.

I didn't want butter splattered all over- so I baked instead. I put half the butter mixture over the chicken, covered with foil, & baked at 375 for 20 minutes. Then flipped them over & repeated. I did broil them for 5 minutes after that. I would recommend using salted butter- I used unsalted, & even though I added about a quarter teaspoon, it was still pretty bland. Smelled great while baking! A very low carb choice.

This recipe was fairly bland and way too buttery for my taste. If I would make it again I would add more herbs and about half the butter.

I made this chicken almost exactly as the recipe says, just added dry onion flakes and a little salt to the buttery mix.  I found this very tasty, and easy, and fast! My kids 4&6 said they really liked it too!  I would make it again, it is something different to do with chicken.  I made little slits in the chicken breasts to stuff the buttery mix into, otherwise it doesn't stay on top too well.  That also helps it cook quicker. It dosesn't say in the recipe to broil on high or low (my oven has 2 broiler modes) I chose high, and that worked right. It was tender and had plenty of flavor.  I gave it a 4 star rating because it calls for so much butter.  This is not low cholesterol/fat chicken!  But Yum nonetheless.

The smell it gave off while cooking was absolutely wonderful.  Next time I'm going to poke holes in the chicken because it was a little bland.  I pounded the chicken so it would cook evenly.  As suggested by other members, I added salt and onion powder.  I also melted the butter with the seasonings in it so they were "locked in."

so moist and yummy.  Not as garlicky as one would expect...in fact, my stepfather who detests garlic liked it. So garlic lovers may want to add more (I used 3 cloves as it is for 6 chicken breasts)

This was so simple to put together and was ready in no time.  My husband loved it, he didn't even have to dunk it in anything(which is his normal routine with chicken).  My children went back for 2nds(Hooray!). I am a vegetarian so no taste rating from me, but a top rating for simplicity and family happiness I will give.

This was my first time using the broiler, and I am not sure I will be using it again.  The smoke detector went off twice!  Maybe I wasn't doing it right.  I thought the chicken was an okay low-carb meal, but nothing spectacular.  Not too much flavor.  If I make this again, I may just bake it or else wait until it is warm enough to use the grill outside.

Pretty good.  I didn't have the thyme when I cooked it so the taste was probably off a little bit.  I also never seem to be able to tell when broiled chicken is done enough.  But, over all it wasn't bad.

Hi, this chicken came out extremely juicy!! That was surprising.  I do suggest cutting down
on the butter just so that you can reduce the fat content.  The herbs gave it goo
flavor although I was looking for something more.  My husband thought it was great
so I'm sure I'll make this again.

This recipe was excellent to my three adult children and very good to myself and husband. He and I are not chicken lovers, so you may want to take that into consideration. Pan fried instead of broiled or oven baked. We all prefer that method.

Wow turned out amazing. What I did is melt the butter with all the herbs and garlic and poured it in the pan. Set the over to 375 for 45min and it turned out perfect. I cut into the chicken and stuffed them with the ingredients. Juicy and tender and very flavorful.

This was super easy and very tasty! I followed others suggestions regarding forking the chicken, and I did cut larger breasts in half because I had a lot of different sizes. I added more garlic because you can never have too much. I have a heat sensing smoke alarm that kept going off, but this was very delicious and I will be making it again!

Followed the recipe but cooked it in a skillet cause I'm lazy. Too hot to turn on the broiler. I used small breasts and it turned out great. I rubbed the chicken in the spices and then browned in butter then turned down low and let simmer added a little chicken broth cause I didn't have any white wine which I also think you could add. Husband loved it and it was SO EASY especially for the lazy cook like me!!!!!!

I made this two nights ago,looking for something to go with half an Acorn Squash. Followed the recipe used (Squeeze bottle garlic),but followed the
recipe except for that, It was delicious, very easy and will make again,
especially on those nights I need to fix something in a hurry.

I used 8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs, removing most of the extra fat. I grilled these on a low to medium heat on a pre-heated grill. Since some reviewers thought this recipe was a little bland, I doubled the parsley, rosemary, garlic and thyme. I left the butter the same. It took about 15 minutes to grill. These were extremely tender and juicy with great flavor. This was a big hit and will definitely be used again for another meal in the near future.

I tried the recipe this evening.  It came out a little tough for my liking but it had a good flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I cut the butter in half.  Because I liked the flavor, I will incorporate some of the comments submitted by other raters.  Thanks for the tasty recipe!

With changes (olive oil instead of butter, baking instead of broiling), this is really good.

For an easy meal, I thought this was okay, but the rest of the family wasn't quite as thrilled.  Everyone seemed to agree that it was missing something.  I might give it a try with some lemon juice (as one of the other reviewers suggested,) or with a white wine marinade.

My family really enjoyed this dish.  I lightly dusted the chicken breasts with flour before cooking.  Otherwise I cooked it according to directions.  It's a hit.  I will definately be making this again and again.

This was ok.  I used frymama's suggestions regarding the olive oil, and broiled it (tastes great that way).  It tastes similar to another recipe I use for garlic chicken, and that one is tastier.  I think I may just combine the spices of this one with the original recipe of the garlic chicken and call it a night.  :)

I want to say this dish is excellent. I added a little parsley, thyme, and rosemary. And I added some paprika. Keep turning the chicken so it doesn't dry out.

Good recipe. I used frymama's recomendation and wrapped in foil and cooked at 350 for about 30 minutes and than opened the foil and cooked under the broiler on high until it was a deep brown. I also used a mixture of butter and olive oil for the recipe. Was very, very moist and flavorful. Will be making agian soon.

This didn't come out quite as juicy as expected. Maybe my oven broiler is off and I can blame that. It seemed kind of bland too. I might try it with more herbs and baked instead.

I didn't feel like making dinner, so this was fairly quick and easy.  The butter smelled fantastic.  I cooked the chicken in a foil packet, and it came out super moist.  Will make again.

This couldnt have been any better in my opinion. It got double thumbs up from the whole family (except my 5 year old who is a fruitatarian righ now :-)The chicken breast that I used were still pretty frozen when I put them in on low broil, so I just made more of the herb butter and kept basting it until it was done. VERY YUMMY!! Oh..and the smell was driving everyone to drooling while it was cooking..

I made this recipe with leg quarters, had no chicken breast at the time.  Had a great smell but do recommend to add salt cause it didn't have much of a flavor.  My family still enjoyed it and was served with broccolli and califlower.

I gave this a 3 because that's how my family rated the original recipe.  However, I made this and baked the chicken at 350 for 30 minutes, then broiled for about 7 minutes and they loved it.  The broiling used in the recipe turned my chicken dry and tough around the edges.  The only change I made to the seasonings was to add a little salt and onion powder.

You might need to double the recipe if the chicken breasts are large.  This recipe will smoke a lot if you are not careful!  Make sure you have good ventilation!  It comes out very tasty and nice and moist as promised!

This was a great recipe to experiment with. I sprinkled some lemon pepper on the chicken breasts first, and then coarsely chopped a medium onion and threw it on top. Then I followed the butter/herb mixture exactly, although I scaled down the rosemary a bit and added a pinch of crushed red pepper to it before spreading it onto the chicken.  I sprinkled a tiny bit of seasoning salt on the dish before broiling it and it came out great!  I can't wait to try this recipe with tilapia instead of chicken!

Made a whole lot of smoke.  Not very flavorful.  Wouldn't make again, but edible.

This was very bland!!! On the postive side, it was a very moist chicken breast, but just lacked flavor.  I don't think I will make this again.

Very tastey and simple. Just watch out for little fires while broiling- the butter liked to ignite.

Although I don't eat chicken, I made this as part of my Valentine dinner for my boyfriend and he loved it! I marinated the chicken for a few hours in Italian dressing first, and then broiled it with the butter/herb/garlic mixture.  My boyfriend said that it turned out perfectly juicy and spiced!

This recipe was very easy to prepare, tasted wonderful and my husband loved it! I would have given it 5-stars, but my only complaint is the "butter" (or margarine).  It tasted greasy to me. If I make it again, I will use something else. I don't know what exactly, maybe low fat yogurt or something.  Any suggestions?

I grilled my chicken rather than using the broiler, and thought these flavors were awesome together.  It was a great low carb dinner that I plan on making again and again!!

I used theighs and legs instead of breasts, so I increased the cooking time to 35 min. I also added some cayenne, about 1 tsp. A trick is to put the mixture under the skin as well as on top.It was overall good though.
