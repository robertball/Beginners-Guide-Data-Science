Absolutely delicious! I made a half recipe, but then regretted not making the full amount! Wasn't sure about the "chorizo, chopped" - I'm assuming it is supposed to be Mexican chorizo, but that kind needs to be removed from the casing and cooked/crumbled in the pot, so that's what I did. It can't really be "chopped" before cooking.  I didn't have garlic juice on hand, so I just used 3 garlic cloves, minced. The only other changed I made was to add in the onions to the pot as the ground sirloin was almost done browning.  The chorizo, cinnamon and chocolate really  make this chili, so don't leave them out! So much depth to the flavors. I can see why this recipe one so many chili cook-offs! Looking forward to leftovers!
