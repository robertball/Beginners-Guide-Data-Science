WOW, I'd give this recipe more stars if I could!  I made this in the crockpot.  I browned the bacon, pork, and onions the night before, and then threw everything else in the crockpot.  The next morning I set it on low while I worked all day, my house smelled amazing when I got home!   The flavors of this chili are amazing, it has a nice smoky flavor!

Everyone loved this! The smokiness of the paprika with the flavorful marinated pork and bacon gave this great flavor.  The only change I made was to cook this in the slow cooker all day, so that we could have it immediately after our apple picking trip.  Served it with buttermilk cornbread. Yum!

The perfect chilly night recipe! Easy to make, cheap ingredients, and not a drop of leftovers.

Some reviewers said this was more a soup than a chili. With that in mind I ...
Cut the water in half & replaced it with boxed beef broth.
Put the tomatoes in a food processor & gave them 7 or 8 pulses before adding them to the pot.
Upped the simmer time from 40 to 60 minutes.

This resulted in a good chili consistency. I also added 2 teaspoons of cumin, because I think that's a basic chili flavor. It turned out great & we'll make it again!

Delicious!!!!!  Will make it again and again!  I thought it would be too spicy, but not at all....if you like spicy, add more than the recipe says.

I loved this but made a few changes as I didn't have the pork only sausage and made them into meatballs and browned first I did add a can of green chilles with pork and this was amazing. I think you could add lots of variations as this is such a good, simple recipe.

My husband loved this chili and he's very picky when it comes to chili, as he considers himself a connoisseur.  My kids weren't big fans of this recipe, however, neither one is a big chili fan period.  I'm giving it 4 stars for my husband loving it and for how easy it was to prepare.

This was a tastey dish. It stretched my imagination a bit though to think of it as chili. The fire roasted tomatoes were the star in this recipe. It was more of a pork soup or stew than a chili dish IMHO.

Through and through...recipe was really easy to follow. I doubled the recipe (because of my family size) and tried to stay true to every detail from being to end, but by the time I got to the end, the recipe was really watery for my liking. Normally I would thicken with cornstarch or flour but I chose not to, so I added an additional can of white beans, drained, rinsed and then mashed before a incorporating into the chili. Doing this....was totally worth it ;-) family really said I rocked out a great dish. So I guess that means it will be a repeat offender.

My husband and I both enjoyed this hearty chili with it's unique smoky and bacon flavor. Simple recipe resulting in a complex flavor explosion for the taste buds! We will definitely make this again.

Delicious, hearty chili that is full flavored and needs twice the amount of beans and tomatoes to make a closer meat/other ingredient ratio as my pork loin was nearly 2 1/2 pounds. I also used chicken stock and added garlic for greater flavor. Our grandsons devoured this chili, so yes, I'll be making this again.

This was a different take on chili altogether! Not too spicy and not bland at all! I will probably make this in a crockpot next time.

My family loved this chili. The pork was tender and very flavorful.  We topped with a little shredded cheddar and ate with a side of cornbread muffins. Will make again ;)

This could easily become a 5 star recipe with a few tweaks. subbing chicken broth for the water, adding garlic and diced jalapeno's would bring this up a star.

This was really very good.  I made 1 1/2 recipe so we would have leftovers - epic fail, should  have doubled it! The best thing,  we sat and threw out ideas to add, transform and tweek the recipe for future meals! 
I put this chili on in the morning, after browning the pork and cooking the bacon/onions into the crock pot.  Let it go on high for 6 hours. Amazing.  Added some sour cream to top it off.
Some of our ideas were to let the chili thicken, I mean really thicken - simmer off until it resembles creamy refried beans and make burritos - our use it as a base for a tostado.   We will surely have this meal again, especially in the upcoming winter months... If we get any winter...

This was very good and easy to make. We loved it. Great in the cooler months or have while watching football. I love the  slight smoky flavor. Everything is better with bacon. I did add some extra jalapenos. We like it spicy.  The Pork loin from Smithfield wasn't too salty either. I will make this again. Delicious!

This was easy to make and full of flavor! The bacon, smoked paprika & fire roasted tomatoes added a nice smoky layer. This would be great for a fall get together or a football game!
