I smoked a five pound blade in shoulder roast last weekend.  It took less than 4 hours to get the internal temperature to 160 degrees.  I pulled it off of the smoker and it was the best, juiciest ham I've ever had.  Tasso is traditionally smoked until it is so dry and concentrated that it's rarely eaten by itself.  I was able to get Morton meat cure at our grocery near the salt.  I wasn't able to find smoked paprika, so I added plain.  And I used Mrs. Butterworth's maple flavored syrup instead of honey.  My family loves it!

Made this for large brunch.  It was absolutely wonderful.  I could not find curing salt and was told by butcher that I could use salt without iodine which I did with success.  Will make this recipe again and again and have already shared the recipe.  Thanks

Hubby is a big grill/smoker kind of guy. He has tried several tasso recipes and this is by far the best!! He makes his own tasso to use in several Cajun recipes that call for tasso as it isn't something we can find in the stores here in WV. The meat is tender and flavorful. Use the bones to cook your favorite greens in....yum!!

I prepared this for in between holiday meals.  It came out great with a wonderful smokey/salty flavor.  If you need curing salts they are available on line or if you have a friend that lives in either a farming or hunting community, you won't find it in large metro areas.

this was wonderful, but tasted slightly on the salty side.  The meat was tender and juicy and made great sandwiches.

This has turned into regular item in my house. The only significant change is that I use a whole pork loin. That way it can be put on a meat slicer and makes awesome sandwiches.

I have done this receipe with deer roast.  Turned out good.  The Tasso I grew up eating though had File powder in the rub.  So I add that to the rub.  In a pinch, I have added liquid smoke to the rub and roasted the ham in the oven.  Turned out okay.  Definitly better slow smoked.

I would cut thicker pieces to smoke. (2-3 inches)  I used pecan chips to smoke. Came out more like a jerky than a ham.

This was really good, the only thing is that it ended up a little salty.  I used a smaller pork butt and that may have been the problem.  But I put more glaze on it.  It was really good.  Also, as has been said, I went to smoke it for 12 hours and it only took 6 hous for a 7 pound butt.

Fantastic ham that was juicy, tender and flavorful.   I did not have mace, so that was omitted.   The ham was too salty in places, but I think that was in the folds where it didn't get rinsed adequately.   Otherwise, it wasn't too salty.  The recipe ingredients are a little off.   In step 5, it calls for 1/4 cup of garlic powder and 1/4 cup of onion powder, but the recipe only lists 2 tablespoons of each for the rub.   I followed the directions and used 1/4 cup of each.

I tried this recipe for the first time Saturday. The only thing I did different was I used all-spice instead of mace. When I couldn't find mace at my local grocery store I did an internet search and found that I could use all-spice as a substitute. Everything else, including temperature, 200 degrees, and cooking time, 12 hours, I followed to a tee. I used a mixture of pecan and apple wood in my electric smoker and cooked a large pork butt and a whole shoulder from a wild hog I harvested. I must say this is a delicious recipe. It was so good my wife suggested having it for our evening meal. I'll be sharing it for our Christmas dinner this Sunday.

I wanted to say thanks to the author of this recipe.  It helped with many Cajun Recipe's that I love to cook including Shrimp and Grits and Jambalaya.   Ordering Taso on-line is expensive and inconvenient and I can't purchase it locally.  
The Taso Ham freezes well for use at later dates.
-Thanks!
