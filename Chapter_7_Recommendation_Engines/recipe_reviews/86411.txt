I'm korean myself but only cooked what i could cook. i thought making its marinade was hard, but I followed this recipe and found it pretty easy. however, since im a big fan and proud of korean food, I wanted to say that this "barbecued korean ribs" has its name. it's called "yahng-yum-kal-bi." yahng-yum means marinated, and kal-bi means short ribs. i hope i didn't sound offensive or advertising.. thx :D

If I could have given this more stars, I would have.  This is a wonderful recipe.  I followed the directions to a "T" with the exception of beef short ribs, I used Beef Boneless Ribs with out bones.  I used a gas grill on 350 degrees and turned them every three minutes four times (make sure that you get the criss-cross lines :-)  and they turned out better than I expected.  We will be having this again!

This recipe was fantastic, a little spicy, but SCRUMPTIOUS ! My husband and I get tired of the same olâ€™ BBQ ribs, sauces all taste the same - this sauce is different and delicious! I will make this over and over again! Thank you for sharing!

I made these the first time a couple of weeks ago as specified.  Putting them on the bbq for about 15 minutes.  Unfortunately, they were so tough we couldn't really eat them.  What I did get to taste, I thought was very excellent.  I just made them again tonight with the same marinade but this time I cooked them low and slow in the crock pot.  They did get very tender then we threw them on the bbq for a few minutes and then brushed them with the marinade.  These were good this way but still didn't replicate the taste from the original recipe.  Still looking for the right way to cook them with the taste from this recipe but not so tough.  The taste is excellent but the cooking method doesn't work for me.

Excellent. Wouldn't change a thing, my husband was very pleased with this meal.  Served it with Italian style vegtables.

I used a different brand of teriyaki so maybe that affected the taste. And while this was good, it is not something I would want to make again. We ended up having to put KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce over these.

I made this tonight for dinner. I made it exactly as the recipe says, although i'm not fond of measuring so my amounts are perhaps inexact. I am a very good cook and make a lot of good things and my husband loves almost everything I make. However he said this was hands down the BEST THING I have ever made. I made a lot and he ate almost three pounds of ribs. The one thing I did use as well was Korean hot sauce as the recipe didn't specify and I wanted to be close to authentic. Korean hot sauce has a fairly unique taste and has a bit of a sweet note. I served this with the Korean spicy cucumbers also on this site. The whole meal was absolutely delicious!!!
