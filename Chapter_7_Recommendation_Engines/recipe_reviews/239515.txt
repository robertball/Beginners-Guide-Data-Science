I did not have savory on hand, but otherwise I followed the recipe as written. Excellent flavor. Will be a repeat in our house. I placed the rub on the brisket, wrapped in foil, and placed it back in the fridge for about 24 hours. Cooked the 8 pound brisket at 275 for about 5 hours (temp 185-190). Let the meat sit for about 90 minutes and then cut. Thanks for the recipe!

Great run! I did add cumin and chili powder to it. Still one of the best recipes available!  Thanks for sharing it!

Perfect rub -- I made this in my Weber Genesis 3 burner indirect heat at 225 (one burner on lowest setting) and 2 pellet smoker boxes with camp chef competition pellets.  300 when the internal temp was 140 - wrapped at 160 and took off to rest at 197.

Turned out GREAT! I didn't use the savory though but did stick to the rest of the recipe. I used mesquite and oak wood to smoke and smoked a 15 lbs brisket for bout 18 hours! The friends and fam had nothing but great comments! Thanks

This rub was PERFECT! I was a bit worried because of the brown sugar (I don't like sugary rubs or sauces), but it didn't taste sweet at all!  I didn't have savory on hand, but the recipe was still amazing without and will be my go-to from now on.  I don't have a smoker, so I placed it in a 350 degree oven with no lid, fat cap on top, for about an hour.  Then I reduced the temp to 300 degrees, added beef stock, put the lid on the dutch oven and braised it for about 3 hours.  It was melt in your mouth amazing!

Made this rub for one of my briskets and it turned out great. The only thing I changed is I omitted the Cayenne pepper because I have little kids and they can’t take the heat.

I bought a 4 pound flat brisket with the fat trimmed. I followed the recipe except I didn’t have any savory. I cooked the brisket at 275 for 5 hours. The brisket was 211 degrees after cooking for 5 hours. Tender and delicious!

A nice rub. Just a little to much red pepper for my taste. Next time I plan on cutting that down or leaving that spice out.

Since it seems no one but Martha Stewart and professional Chefs have Savory, I used one Tbsp. Marjoram and one Tbsp. Thyme.  I may just use Thyme next time but it was great.

Excellent rub. Good on its own, added 2 tbs of ground coffee to give it a little more depth.

This recipe is really good.  I did not use savory, instead I substituted thyme.  I'm keeping this recipe as a favorite.
