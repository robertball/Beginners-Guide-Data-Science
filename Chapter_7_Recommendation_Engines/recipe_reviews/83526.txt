Sorry to rain on the parade, but we didn't like this at all. I ended up rinsing off the yogurt, and tossing the asparagus in garlicky butter. I'm glad others liked it, but I won't be making this again.

Simple to prepare. The sauce by itself didn't wow me and I wondered why am I making this. Put with the steamed asparagus (seasoned with salt and pepper), it took on a whole new perspective and was actually pleasing. Will I make it again? No, but it was good for one dinner.

My whole family loved this!! I have to double the amount of asparagus because there wasn't enough.  Very easy to cook; especially with a steamer for the veggie.

Rasberry yogurt makes it different, but almost too sweet.

As far as simple recipes to dress up asparagus go, this one is definately the best I've found.  The tart and sweet of the yogurt really help to bring out the crisp green flavor of the asparagus.  I will definately make this again.

This asparagus was not terrible, but I would say that it is an aquired tast.

Was a complete hit with the ladies at my holiday luncheon! No one could believe how easy the sauce recipe was!  Will definitely use this one over and over!
