This is delicious! The recipe didn't specify, but I used pure maple syrup. Also wasn't sure how flat to make it, but I just went with my instincts. I guess the only major downside is that you have to keep it in the freezer b/c it gets soft super quick. Yummy and creamy...a keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

It was very good but I made it too thin. I had problems with it being too floppy but I think it needs to be in the freezer longer.

My daughter and I made this for fun this afternoon. Quick and easy. Doubled the recipe and added about a 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips.  I think if I make it again I'll put a semisweet chocolate ganache on the top of the fudge.  It's super yummy!

I doubled the recipe because there wasn't a lot when i made it. I put it in the freezer for 15 minutes, but I put it in longer because it was too soft and fell apart in my hands. It tasted really good, but maybe more syrup because you can barely taste it. I would make it again but i would change the recipe a little bit.

You don't taste the syrup and it has a wonderful peanut butter taste. Easy to make but its just not fudge i.  I will make again though (I'm a peanut butter lover).

I used creamy Justin's peanut butter and pure maple syrup.  I  made a 1/2 batch because that is all the syrup I had on hand.  I was craving peanut butter cookies but this recipe appeared.  I will make this again because it so simple and tastes great!

Yummy stuff! I microwaved the syrup, to thin it a little bit, before whisking it into the peanut butter.
Will definitely make it again.
