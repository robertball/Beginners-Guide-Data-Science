I really like this recipe and have found that it is even better the nest day.  I cook a batch and keep it in the refrigerator overnight or even for a few days... seems like the flavors get a chance to meld together a little bit more.

I'd make it again.  Only thing I changed was the canned peas and carrots; I used fresh and lightly steamed.

This was delicious. I changed it up a bit. I used frozen peas and corn and omitted the carrots.  I seasoned my beef and added more Worcestershire sauce and garlic.

I made this exactly as written and everyone loved it!  The only thing that I might change next time would be to add more tots.
