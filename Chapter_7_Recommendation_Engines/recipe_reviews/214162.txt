Decadent - a major contributor to tonight's dinner of grilled pork chops and "Bacon Wrapped Asparagus," recipe also from this site.  I used unpeeled, small Yukon Gold potatoes and just a hint of grated fresh nutmeg.  The cream sauce, spinach and nutmeg was a match made in heaven.  I made no other changes in ingredients, and none in terms of measurements or in the cooking method.  That makes this easy - it's perfect just as is.  The spinach was a creative addition and the Muenster lent just enough, but not too much, flavor.  Exquisite.

These potatoes are outstanding! I followed the recipe as written, and couldn't be more pleased, even the cook times are spot on! The sauce was perfect in 10 minutes, and the bake time is perfect also. I was a bit skeptical when I poured the sauce over the potatoes and spinach because I didn't think it was enough, but I was so wrong, this recipe is perfect as written. Next time I'm going to use Swiss cheese and add some crumbled bacon, now that sounds wonderful as well! I agree with Christina, I believe many types of cheeses could be used in this with great results. Thanks for the recipe :)

Hubby said to give this one 6 stars...It was that good! My mom insisted she had a block of muenster cheese, but of course, she didn't, lol, so I ended up using Butter Kase, but I could totally see using pretty much ANY cheese and this turning out fantastic! Instead of using 1 cup milk and 1 cup heavy cream, I just used 2 cups of milk and that worked out perfectly. These were truely delicious and I will be making them again and again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Delicious! My new favorite au gratin recipe. I added a little extra salt just for personal preference.

This recipe is delicious and I’ve made it several times, with modifications, in the last few months. Because of the high fat content as written I use olive oil instead of butter and 2% milk instead of heavy cream. And, since all I’ve had on hand were russet potatoes that’s what I’ve used. I also leave out the salt as the cheese has plenty and my husband has high blood pressure. As for the cheese I can say that I have made it with many types and mixes, and that the Muenster is definitely the best! This is now our favorite potato recipe, and although I’m sure it would taste much richer as written, the basic recipe idea is excellent and still a treat with all the cheese!

Abolutely Divine! I had no cream, so used 1 3/4c milk + 1/4c sour cream. Also, after baking 30 min covered & 20 uncovered, I put back in 300 degree oven, covered for about 30 min only because my guys hadn't made it home yet. Then popped back in just to melt the final cheese. These were so fabulous with grilled steaks & roasted asparagus! Everyon went back for seconds! Thanks for a great recipe!!

We thought this came out very well. I think I'd use a stronger-flavored cheese in the future, and I'd probably caramelize another onion or two as they were lost in mine. The recipe calls for more butter than the instructions say to use -- go with the instructions, as they have the correct ratio for a roux. The sauce doesn't seem like it's going to be enough for all the potatoes (I used 4 big Russets), but it is enough once the spinach shrinks in the oven :) Thanks for the recipe!

I made this tonight to go with beef tenderloin.  Wow, these were really good.  My father and husband thought they were great too.  I did change a couple things to go with what I had on hand. Yukon golds, frozen chopped spinach and Jarlsberg cheese.  For the amount of potatoes I cubed them fairly small and put a generous single layer across the bottom of my 9x 13 dish.  Thawed and drained the spinach, pulled out little chunks and placed evenly over the potatoes.  When I added the milk and cream I did it in a few batches instead of all at once and had no problem with clumping.    Other than as mentioned I followed the directions for cooking and such.  Take the time to caramelize the onions, I don't think these would taste nearly as good with just regualr onions.  It was a little futzy having to make the cheese sauce but the quality of product makes it so worth it.    I think that the next time I will add some cubed ham and make a bit more sauce to make a one dish dinner.  My husband said "bacon bacon bacon", that would be good too!  I so wish I had taken a picture before it was all gone.

I was torn between four or five stars. I opted to go with four because I believe a different cheese would have been better and alot cheaper, too. I couldn't get shredded muenster, so I had to buy a 1.11 pound block which worked fine for the two cups. The block cost $8.09 which is too pricey for the results. The cooking directions and times were right on the mark, though, and my dad just loved them. I love the idea, so I will try a different cheese next time because the Muenster was just too mild. Thank you for the recipe.

I couldn't find Meunster, so I substituted half Gruyere and half Emmental.  It was fantastic!

This was tasty. I used whole milk in place of milk and cream and my sauce was still very creamy.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it and it was pretty easy to put together considering I didnt peel the potatoes.

This is good, but missing something; just don't know what.  To be fair, I cut the recipe in half and used only whole milk.  I'm not sure if that makes a big difference.  I will try this again with more sauce to see if that helps.  Glad I did a trial run before Easter dinner!

Made this recipe exactly as written and it was phenomenal.  Only change was to cut the potato in slices instead of cubes.  Beautiful.

An outstanding recipe that translates to an amazing dish. I used a food processor for most of the prep work so my potatoes were sliced thick rather than cubed. This would be super yummy with crumbled bacon or another type of meat. This could easily play the lead in any meal instead of just a supporting role.

Outstanding!  I added some crumbled cooked bacon to the top of the potatoes along with the final addition of cheese, then baked the last 10 min. or so per directions.  Wowza!  Not for calorie counters, but a nice treat when your having guests.  Went great with marinated & grilled ribeye's...but these would go great with any meat.  Enjoy!  :-)

This was excellent. We didn't have Muenster cheese, so instead used a mix of old cheddar and garlic & dill cheddar. I used just milk instead of half milk/half cream and it turned out just fine. This is a really easy and flexible recipe. A nice way to use up fresh spinach. Thanks for posting this recipe.

This is wonderful: one of the best potato dishes I've ever eaten! Perfect the way it is, don't alter it until you've tried it as written. I made this the first time for my mom's birthday. She said it was 'divine' and that it now replaces her grandmothers Au Gratin Potatoes. Everyone I've made it for since has asked for the recipe. Soooo good!

Superfabulous!  I used 1/2 milk, 1/2 cream and greased the dish with butter.  I sautéed the onions in EVOO and for the cheese I used smoked gouda and monterey jack which I had on hand.  I only had to bake for 45 mins. YUM!

Made this tonight for my supper... O.M.G. SOOOO GOOD! And I can see where it would lend its self to variation. Maybe add sauteed mushrooms. Julianned ham. Imagination! I'm going to have to watch myself to keep from eating the entire thing myself!

Delicious comfort food! I used whole milk instead of spending money on heavy cream, and I found it plenty rich enough. I served it with ham. Next time I make this recipe I think I will try it with swiss cheese.

I made this last night. I have to admit right off the bat that I did not have heavy cream but I did have half & half. So I used that mixed with 2% milk. I also had a bag of shredded Muenster & Gruyere cheese mixed from Trader Joe's. For the last topping of cheese, I shredded a block of Muenster cheese. This was creamy and rich but I felt it still lacked something. One onion caramelized is definitely not enough for a 9x13 dish. I caramelized 4 shallots in addition to the one onion and it still could have used more! I see other reviewers added more salt or some nutmeg, it definitely could use some of those things at least. I will definitely try this again with some modifications. Great idea though!

So so good! On the heavy side with the cream, but so yummy! I used canned spinach instead of fresh; seemed to work just as well. This recipe is DEFINITELY a keeper!

The only reason I left off the 5th star was due to the cooking instructions. If I had followed as written I would have had undercooked and very dry potatoes: instead when I checked at the 30 min mark I realized that I had to leave them covered for the additional 20 minutes. The flavor of the cheese sauce is to die for though, I could have sat very happily with a spoon and the pot and devoured the cheese sauce. I am planning to make the cheese sauce again and try with other foods. Thanks!

I made with 8 three-four inch potatoes and it seemed like it needed more moisture.  However I live in a very dry climate, so I don't know if that had effects.  The taste was really good, however I added some dry mustard.

This was a treat and the only change I made was using leftover baked red potatoes and reducing the bake (grill) time because of that. I put these on the grill over indirect heat while making chicken breast for about 30 min. I would have to lighten this up if I made it very often but glad I tried it as directed. The sauce was a little thick and stayed on top rather than melting down into the taters but that is likely due to the time/moisture change of using leftover potatoes. Regardless, it was good that way too.

Perhaps because I thinly sliced my taters instead of dicing (think scalloped) but the sauce didn't really cover all the potatoes. Other changes were using all cream (with a generous splash of milk), extra spinach (8oz. frozen), more garlic and adding nutmeg. I subbed cheddar and edam cheese for the muenster. I chose to add my spinach into the sauce for even distribution. I wish the recipe would have specified the size of the potatoes (sm, med, large) to use as I think my potatoes were probably too large. The sauce was really good though.

This was a great dish.  I did not have muenster cheese. I used Monterey Jack cheese with a little bit of Pepper jack cheese.  it was quite tasty and all gone by the end of the meal.

This was a delicious hit for our Thanksgiving dinner.

I had 12 people, I made the recipe 1.5x rather than a full double and baked in a larger roasting pan.   
I used fresh scrubbed, unpeeled Yukon gold potatoes.  
Rather than heavy cream, I used half and half- it was fine.   Still used milk as well. 
I used a Mexican cheese blend I had on hand and needed to used,  along with some good savory cheddar.      I look forward to making this again,  and will try with the Munster cheese.
Spinach was great - I added handfuls!  It cooks down and adds nice color.   
The basic recipe is easy  and certainly allows for  creativity and flexibility with ingredients.   ????

I made this with only one change - I used 16 oz of half & half instead of 8 oz milk and 8 oz heavy cream. It was oh so good! My guests were more than pleased that we had enough left over to send everyone home with a container full. Oh, I did use gluten free flour also :-) Everyone asked for the recipe.

While the recipe tastes good, I felt it was too labor intensive.  It could use a little more flavor.  I am going to try and cut the potatoes into slices instead of cubes and maybe that will help cook it faster.  I just wasn't that impressed, so I will try again. If something takes me an hour and a half to make (for just a side dish) it should knock my socks off, but it was decent.

I had some leftover cottage roll that I chopped up and added so I mixed a 1/2 tsp of dry mustard with the flour. No Munster so mixed cheddar and Parmesan.cheese.   Was super good will make it again and again. 
I also chopped up some red pepper and added that and used kale. From the garden instead of spinach. What a great basic recipe!

This was fabulous.  I think the Muenster added a very nice flavor to these but then the bacon I added didn't hurt.  I fried up 6 slices of chopped bacon and then used the bacon grease with about 1/2 the butter to caramelize the onions in.  I doubled the onion and garlic as a personal preference and used russet potatoes and frozen spinach because that is what I had.  I also used 2% milk and half and half because that is also what I had.  I wouldn't change a thing next time except would love to use fresh spinach.

Made this almost as written, and I loved it. Just substituted the heavy cream with 1/4 cup sour cream and 3/4 cup half & half. And I did use almost all Muenster cheese and I found it not lacking in flavor at all. Spinach is perfect with this recipe, what a yummy version of au-gratin potatoes!

How could you NOT love a dish like this?  It's so comforting and full of flavor.  I definitely recommend you let this one keep you company one night.  Caramelized onions win me over every time.  And I like the fact this recipe is versatile. I added cubed ham and made this dish the "main" dish.  I have made things like this before.  I am glad I came across it today.  My kids weren't too keen on it but that's only because they could see the spinach, lol.  If I make this again I will make a smaller portion.

I doubled the recipe (as I always do for my "BIG EATIN" family)! Although my family members(from 8 years to 54 years old) really really liked these potatoes, I only gave it 4*(s) because after tasting the sauce, I had to add a lot more spice and fresh garlic before baking.  I think it would have been very bland if I did not add more spice (basil and sea salt for us). Also, I only needed the original amount of butter (3 tablespoons) which worked out perfect!  Otherwise, thanks for a great recipe, I don't think I would have ever used "muenster cheese" which I really liked!!

Soooooo good.  It's very rich so it's not an everyday side dish.  It was probably the best dish I made at Christmas.  It also reheated very well.  I'll be making this every holiday for sure.

I made this just to use the spinach I had.  But I was surprised at the delicious taste.  We cleaned the platter.  I diced the potatoes into quarter inch cubes.  They were totally cooked in the time stated.  I did use only one percent milk and the taste was creamy enough for us.  I had to substitute mozzarella cheese but did toss the shredded cheese with almost a quarter teaspoon of mustard powder.  We will make this often.

Very VERY good. I love Munster it is one of my favorites for both the flavor and the creamy texture. I have mad this twice prior as written and today now for a third time. I decided to add a bit of extra sharp cheese to give it a bit of a bite. I am sure it will be just as good. What a great way to sneak in some spinach too,,

I can't really say I made this recipe because I changed so much.  There is no way to obtain muenster cheese or fresh spinach without driving a fair distance.  So, using what I had or could find I used arugala instead of spinach...should have cut off the stems....  asiago cheese in the sauce, sliced potatoes instead of cubed.  Layered potatoes, arugala, caramelized onions, 3 other cheeses, salt and pepper.  Added harissa to sauce.  So, I enjoyed the recipe a lot but made so many changes that I'm not sure it could be considered "I made it".

I doubled the garlic and would make it again with even more garlic and perhaps add some black pepper and cut down on the salt.  The cheese is full of salt.  I used Trader Joe's Swiss Gruyere shredded cheese and it was tasty.

I used this recipe as a guideline.  First off, I cut the recipe in half as there was only two of us.  I used spinach from my garden and chives from my garden instead of onions.  I made the cheese sauce in the microwave adding chopped chives and minced garlic to the flour/butter mixture before adding the milk (didn't use cream).  I used a mixture of cheddar cheese and monterey jack cheese.  Cooked in oven for 30 minutes, uncovered and then cooked for another 20 minutes. We both really enjoyed this.  May try the original recipe later.  Thank you.

This is wonderful!  I made it for Easter dinner and it was a big hit!  The only change I made was to use Dubliner cheese. It is sharp and gave this dish just the right amount of bite.

This was delicious.  I made it as directed except used half & half instead of heavy cream.  I have never used muenster before, so wasn't sure of the flavor.  I was hoping for a stronger flavor, so next time I make I will ad  some Swiss cheese.  I will also slice the potatoes and layer them next time as I prefer it that way...but cubed potatoes were really easy. All and all a great dish!

I did not cook the onions until Dark Brown and think it is better to just lightly brown them.

This was fantastic. A great option for Christmas dinner other than garlic or baked potatoes. I felt kinda of funny when the recipe said cut potatoes into chunks instead of slices, but it was perfect. Next time I might add bacon and may even use Gruyère cheese even though the muenster cheese was perfect and added some saltiness to the dish. Will definitely be making this again.

Delicious! These were the best potatoes I have ever personally cooked. I did not peel my potatoes but otherwise followed the exact recipe. These had a wonderful flavor with the caramelized onions and muenster cheese. Well worth the effort it takes to make them.

This was a huge hit!! I did play with the cheese, I replaced about 1/3 of the cheese with some gouda and Jarlsberg (sp) I just thought the muenster would be too bland, I want to try some different cheeses but - it was delicious! The spinach is a great addition as well as the onions.  We had leftovers, every time some one took out the container everyone else in the room said "you're not going to finish that are you?!) I think I'm making it and just putting in the fridge for snacks.. lol I also added a 1/2 teas of mustard powder for a little flavor -- and soooo easy!!!

This recipe is so easy and tastes marvelous! I added chunks of zucchini / squash for some added veggie benefits. Our entire family begged me to make it again for our next function. Yum - I have fallen in love with Muenster Cheese!

Made this recipe as a side dish for ham and everyone loved it.  I did not have all the exact ingredients but after reading many of the reviews it seemed others also switched out various ingredients too.  I used russet potatoes, pepper jack and sharp cheddar cheeses.  I felt it needed a bit more salt too.  I too felt like there was not enough sauce during prep, but sure enough after baking it was the perfect amount.  Not watery at all but just right.  FYI - due to also baking ham, I had to use a different oven temp.  I baked this at 375 for 40 min, added the cheese on top and put it back in for 10 min at which point it was done.  Overall this is less baking time than the recipe says which I assume might be due to the small dice on my potatoes.

Of all the recipes that I tried out for Thanksgiving, this one actually turned out great-- I probably added a bit more salt and pepper than was called for, but that's ok. Love the spinach in this-- will make again, and add more spinach.

Hello, I made this a few weeks ago and my  picky hubby loved it. wowow. When I made it I used olive oil, sliced onions sautéed  until caramelized added minced garlic. Then I added flour and milk. Added shredded store bought cheese, I was running late so I sliced potatoes on a mandolin and nuked them in the microwave for 2 minutes and then another 2 minutes to get a jump on cooking them. I added them to a glass dish which I sprayed with pam then poured the mixture over the potatoes and baked and when I tested the potatoes and they were soft I sprinkled with some cheese and baked them until cheese was melted and as I said delicious. I am making them again tonight but using different cheeses like asiago, swiss and pepper jack after shredding them. So hopefully they will be at least the same or maybe even better...thxs

Excellent recipe!!!! I took it to a friend's for dinner and they LOVED it! I'm keeping this recipe in my back pocket! I used Russett potatoes since that is what I already had. As someone else said, I was worried that the topping was not going to be enough, but after it was cooked, it was PERFECT!

Absolutely decadent! I wouldn't have thought to put muenster in au gratin potatoes but these were probably some of the best we've ever had!! They were very creamy and had lots of layers of flavors.  Definitely not on my diet plan though!

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I have made this as is and really enjoyed it.  As per other reviews, I have also subbed milk/sour cream for the heavy cream.  I also added some crisp crumbled prosciutto for added flavor.  Really, really good!

I thought this delicious and I will definitely make it again! I'm from southern Louisiana, so i wanted it to have a little more flavor/spice so I may add something next time. And I felt it needed a little more salt (personal preference). I omitted the spiniach since i had none on hand.  I also didnt have an 1hr30min to make this so I cut some corners but i dont think it affected the recipe at all. I cubed and boiled the potatoes for about 15 min so they were cooked but still firm.  Then I added the sauce and baked for about 20 min, added cheese as directed and baked for another 10. My hubby really liked it and its even something I would add to our traditional holiday menus.  I also really like that it DOES NOT call for any Cream of ---Soup, as I like to know everything that goes into my food :) Great Recipe!

My family loves this recipe. I took this to my husbands family Christmas and it was a big hit. I did leave out the spinach, as I wasn't sure if everyone liked spinach.

this was a fantastic recipe!  I tend to alter just a bit.  I used russet potatoes, and in the sauce, I used a mixture of sharp cheddar (white) and about l/3 c. of herbed feta cheese.  I used muenster for the top.  Was fantastic.  Everyone LOVED it!

Just made this for Christmas dinner.  I used what I had on hand,  4 C. half and half in place of cream and milk, cheddar and Parmesan cheese in place of Muenster and I tripled the garlic.  Good flavors, easy to make and got great reviews at at the party!

Great recipe! I substituted Fontina cheese for Muenster and increased the garlic to about a Tablespoon, and it was delicious! I think I may throw in some mushrooms next time, but this will definitely be a go-to side dish for me!

Soooo yummy !!!!!  I used what I already had on hand:  four russet potatoes, frozen spinach (squeeze out the excess water), two onions, three cloves garlic, two cups milk (no cream), extra sharp cheddar cheese (also added white pepper), and topped it with crispy bits of bacon after it came out of the oven. I followed the cooking directions exactly and it came out perfectly delicious.
