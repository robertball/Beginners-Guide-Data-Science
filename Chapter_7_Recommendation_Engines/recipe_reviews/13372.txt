I didn't have beef broth so I used water, 2 beef bouillon cubes and a packet of dry onion soup mix. I only used about a cup of barley because a whole bag seemed like way too much. I also added 3 cloves of finely minced garlic, 2 diced carrots and a 2 ribs celery diced. It came out great. As it thickened I just added more water and the soup was very flavorful.

My husband gives it 5 stars, but I didn't find it as tasty so it averages to 4 stars.

It's even better if you follow the suggestions below of adding the veggies and only ONE cup of barley.  For those that like a healthier option, be sure to use natural/organic broth as most brands contain MSG.

Good base, added some veggies, onion, carrots, but was still a little bland for my taste, decided to try a little trick I noticed at resturant and add a little soy sauce, OMG it went from a 3 stars to 5, just make sure to use low sodium broth. It gives a rich color and adds more body to the soup. Try it you'll love it.

Easy to make.  Next time I will put more meat and less barley. Better the 2nd day, but needed more broth.

Very simple and very tasty. Had some cooked striploin that I cut up small and added to this soup. Highly recommended whenever you have left-over cooked beef.

This was a great base. I added carrots, celery, onion,2 cloves of garlic, a bay leaf, and a pack of onion soup mix. As it thickened it turned nice and creamy. I made it at night to let it sit overnight until we gobble it up today!

Delicious and simple. Take this basic recipe and add what you want or have on hand.  Freezes great.  I added thick-sliced carrots and onion soup mix (per two reviewers) as well as chunks of sweet potato and diced tomatoes (added the toms for the last half hour).  Turned out great.

I make this all the time. It's not quick, but it's easy. I boil some beef cubes for an hour, then dump in some water and beef base, a chopped onion, and a few cloves of garlic, and boil another hour, dump in a can of mixed veggies at the end, and it's so good. I also like to put a splash or two of Worcestershire in it for bite and twang. We love it. Great recipe.
