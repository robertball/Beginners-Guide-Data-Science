My daughter made this for her Germany Culture Project for school.  I didn't expect them to come out so well.  These were great.  I'll keep this recipe and use it again!  These were not bland at all. She cooked them for only 11 minutes and came out perfect.

Nice simple honey cookies. I used 1 1/4 cups honey + 1/2 cup sugar rather than the 1 cup sugar/1 cup honey as recommended (Im a beekeeper, no shortage of honey here) and 150g butter rather than shortening. They're a soft cookie sort of in the way gingerbread is soft. Lightly honey-flavoured and perfect for dunking in some hot chocolate or tea.

These cookies are very moist & tasty. I used butter-flavored shortening.  Instead of 1 tsp ginger, I used 1/2 tsp. GINGER & 1/2 tsp. NUTMEG. I also used 1 1/4 c. honey & 1/2 c. sugar.(Mainly because I was looking for a "honey" specific recipe! Baking time: 10-11 min@350. I found that if I let them set for a minute after removing them from the oven they were easier to get out of the pan w/out distorting them(because they are so soft). This would be a perfect cookie to serve with a cup of hot tea.

Very good recipe. I've looked far and wide for a good honey-only cookie (not with peanut butter) and this is it! Definite keeper! Note, this is what I'd call a basic "milk & cookies" type of cookie. Sort of thing mom would fill the cookie jar with back in the 1960's  :-)  Used some of the mods others suggested, namely: 1 cup butter, 1 1/4 cups honey, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp. ginger, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg. Also changed the procedure to make it easier: sifted together the dry ingredients; transferred the melted sugar, butter & honey to the mixer; once cooled, added vanilla & eggs then the flour. The bottoms of the cookies came out smoother when I used parchment paper. Also tried different baking times. (My oven is dead on temp-wise; checked with thermometer.) 11 minutes is not enough - they are too chewy (almost doughy) and deflate into cow pies when cool. 14 to 15 minutes is perfect - they turn out light brown with some crispness around the edges but moist in the center. Perfect for dunking in milk. :-)  Very strong honey flavor. I used a dark clover honey. Might be interesting to try with different honey types.

Very good cookie.  Loved the "texture".  I used 1 1/4 c. butter instead of the shortening.  Also took others suggestion and used 1 1/4 c. honey and 1/2 c. sugar for more "honey" taste.  I did add 1/2 t. cinn
amon and a pinch of nutmeg along with the 1/2 t. ginger.  They still came out very good.  In fact, I am thinking about entering them in next year's state fair.  Thank you for a "keeper".

I am baffled by the bum reviews.  This recipe is so simple, centered around specific sugars and fats - if you mess with either, you're going to change the entire structure of the cookie.  Period.  I only had butter-flavored shortening, and fresh grated ginger, so that was my change.  I used a lovely raspberry honey from the local farmers market (I hate clover honey).  They came out puffy and cake-like out of the oven, but deflated on the cooling rack as pictured.  You end up with a lightly sweet, aromatic tea cookie.  Tip: DON'T OVERCOOK THESE - you will get hockey pucks.  (Trust me.)  You just want them lightly golden.  Mine only took the 12 minutes, and my oven usually takes longer to bake.   OPTIONAL: for those who think this recipe could use something extra:  I mixed the zest of one grapefruit into half of the batter (honey+ginger+grapefruit=heaven) with excellent results.  Just an essence of citrus on top of the honey goodness - amazing.  These tasted best just after they cooled, but stayed moist and good wrapped in foil for several days.

Nice cookie, and a nice change from all the other Christmas cookies that are around right now. I used a 'red' honey, and used 1/2 cup of sugar to 1 cup of honey, and it turned out quite nicely. Next time I think I'll add a little more ginger, and a bit of cinnamon. I also found that dropping them onto the pan produced a "rough-looking" cookie... the dough is quite stiff, so I just shaped balls with my hands and flattened them slightly.

These were actually pretty good. I bought a 5 piund tub of honey at Costco, and my daughter requested/suggested honey cookies. I had no idea, so I used this recipe and they turned out quite nice. There is a small time frame between perfect and too crunchy. I found 8 minutes (exactly!) was just right. Thanks!

Nice and sweet!  These cooked up in 11 minutes in my gas oven - watch them because they can burn quickly!

Hi googled search honey cookies and found this one. I have made these cookies so many times since then, that I decided to join allrecipes.com to leave a review! These are by far the best cookies I have ever made. I found once I put the batter in the fridge after making it, it becomes a bit easier to handle and the size is perfect. Also I add almond extract in addition to the vanilla and add cinnamon, nutmeg and ground cloves to the egg mixture. Everyone loves these...adults and children alike. Thank you for posting and thank you to your Gran for sharing this recipe :)

I just made these for the first time last night, took them to work and everyone enjoyed them.  My boss actually said he would have a second one...and he never has seconds!  I did what others said and used 1 1/4 cup honey with a 1/2 cup of sugar...added a small dash of cinnamon and nutmeg as well.  By the second batch i learned that they did better in my oven when pressed down a bit.  They are great and something i will make again for sure!  Thanks!

Delicious and soft and sweet! I didn't change a thing in the recipe. Next time I might cut down just a hair on the ginger. Took between 8 and 9 minutes in the oven; I tried one pan greased and one ungreased and didn't notice a difference.

Following the recipe with no substitutions yielded a soft-chewy cookie.  Using a cookie dough scoop yielded 54 cookies.  Amazingly, I didn't taste the ginger after baking; instead, it just seems to enhance the honey flavor.  If you like honey, you'll like these cookies.  Noted a lot of substitutions of butter in other reviews.  Please know that changing the type of fat used in a recipe greatly changes the texture of the finished product.  Same is true of sugars.

Wonderful "Old World" cookie. Though most people tend to think as this cookie as bland by today's standards. This is a great recipe to get back to the days when our great-great grandmothers made treats. I think this was a comforting taste that wasn't overly sweet! Thank You!!!

Really good!  Made this like a regular cookie...didn't bother heating anything, just mixed 'wet' and 'dry' ingredients as usual.  I did only use 1/2 the ginger (personal preference) - still quite yummy & picky son loved them!

My son made these for German Club and they were okay - very heavy on the honey taste - don't worry about the ginger - can hardly taste it - he followed the directions exactly and they turned out very flat -should have added more flour but was worried they would be hard. Probably won't make them again.

Wonderful cookie. I had never made a cookie using this procedure. Just do it like the original and I don't believe you will be sorry. They stayed moist for a long time. These will be a tradition for me.

Modifications: 1/2 cup sugar, 1 1/2 cup honey, 2 cups all-purpose flour, 2 cups wheat flour, 1 cup coconut oil. The cookies turned out fabulous. With the extra honey, they are moist and chewy and with the wheat flour, they have a bit of a honey-wheat flavor. Will definitely make these again.

Good flavor, a nice mild cookie, just what I like. Not to sweet, even for the amount of sugar/honey in it. Reminds me of the super expensive german cookies I sometimes buy around the holidays. My one gripe is the recipe is rather large. Which may also be a good thing for other people. Best eaten fresh! Will make again, thank you for a simple delicious recipe!

AMAZING! I took half of the batch to work and saved half. Had nothing but great compliments. The ginger adds just the right amount of extra flavor. This will be a recipe I will use for years to come! The only trouble I had was figuring out when they were done. At first I thought they were a little too brown but pulled them too early and it was a bit doughy. Lightly browned all over the top was perfect. Thank you!

These cookies were pretty good. I love the chewy texture, but I subsituted the ginger for 1 tsp of cinnamon.

Came out fine.  Just seemed to be missing something.  Plain old cake type cookie.  I won't make them again.  Honey Oatmeal Chocolate Chip cookeies are much better.

My husband told me that these are just like the cookies his great-grandma used to make for him! Definitely worth making these to hear that! 

Like other reviewers have said, these can go from done to burned very quickly, so be extra-careful if you have a partially full sheet. I lost a half-dozen that way :(

A nice diversion from all the sweets...this reminded me a little bit of gingerbread.  A good cookie for dunking in hot tea or milk.

Absolutely fantastic! I did what the other reviewed suggested and halved the sugar and doubled the honey. Used the amount of ginger stated, but added an equivalent amount of nutmeg. The results were a soft, chewy cookie that you just want to eat more of. Oh, I used butter instead of shortening. Will definitely make again, maybe trying with brown sugar next time. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe. To get the cookies to look more like the picture you may need more flour, and also let the dough cool for a while. This will make it thicken up. I have a convection oven, so these baked in 9 minutes to perfection for me. Thanks for the wonderful German cookie recipe!

Yummy cookie!  I omitted the ginger due to personal preference.  Used all the white sugar, 3/4 cup honey because that is all I had and subbed remainder with 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I did not melt the ingredients together due to a hunch that they didn't need it.  I beat them like normal cookies and used a cookie scoop.  I think this helped them not to spread or overbake.  I dipped these in cinnamon sugar hot out of the oven. Perfect touch.  Nice delicate and balanced flavor.

I followed others' comments and changed the honey sugar measurements to 1.25 and .5.  I also changed the ginger and nutmeg to .5tsp each.  However, my husband and I both thought these were missing something.  The texture is good, more cake like, and like a gingerbread, but it's still missing some flavor to it or something.  Probably won't make them again, or will make major changes to the recipe to do so.

Fabulously tasty! Adding the extra spice is very good, tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg. Cookies are VERY soft, so I don't recommend stacking them unless you bake them a minute or two longer, and let them sit to dry for an hour or two. Will be using this again!

I love honey cookies, and I especially love old family recipes.  For flavour I used 1 1/2 cups of honey and 1/2 cup brown sugar, and half whole wheat flour and half white.  I also added 1 tsp salt and used half ginger and half nutmeg.  I used margarine instead of the shortening.  The dough came out very soft (because of the extra honey) so I refrigerated for about an hour.  I will definitely add this to the collection.  Thanks!

I did tweak the recipe, but they turned out very good!  I used butter flavor crisco, subbed half of the honey with brown sugar, added 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. cloves, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and increased the vanilla to 1 TBSP.  After rolling the dough into balls, I tossed them in sugar/cinnamon mixture and baked them.  Very sweet and very yummy.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

These are nice cookies, but seem to be missing something.  What, I'm not sure.  Maybe chocolate chips?  Something that goes well with honey.  They bake up really well and look cakelike when you take them out of the oven, but don't be fooled--let them cool for a few minutes on the cookie sheet and they flatten and crinkle brilliantly.  Nice honey taste, but again, can't quite put my finger on it, but I think they need something more.  Very easy, though.  My honey is starting to crystalize, though, so the last of my dough was a bit tought to get out.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made for a church potluck...pretty good; hubby said they tasted lighter than they looked. First batch was bland, really needs some light glaze like the photo, but without the recipe alongside, I improvised: I rolled the dough balls in a mixture of 1/3c sugar, 1 tsp allspice, 1 tsp ginger, and 1/2 tsp white pepper, with a sprinkle of chili powder. The spices added some zing; our kids who don't eat pepper, ages 8 & 9, liked them.

This is a great cookie!  My 4th grade daughter needed an authentic German recipe for a family heritage research project at school, and this was the perfect solution!  They cooked in 10 minutes, and cooled slightly chewy.  They are a bit bland, but not in a bad way.  Would be great with a cup of hot tea!  Will do this recipe again.

I made these exactly according to the directions and they turned out lovely. They baked for 12 mins and I switched the cookie sheets between the racks half way through. These were not bland and had a delicious honey taste. Perhaps this also has something to do with the type or quality of honey you use. The ginger brightened the flavor but didn't taste overly ginger-y.

These cookies were absolutely amazing!! They were super easy to make and the honey makes them sweet but not too sweet. Unfortunately, I must have thought the recipe made 2 dozen cookies and not 4 dozen... So the next time I make these I would cut the amount of ingredients in half. Also since there is so much honey in them, I found that they were a little sticky after cooling so I added a dusting of powdered sugar over them. These are the best cookies I've had in a long time. I look forward to making them again.

These turned out like hard balls more than soft cookies. I didn't have enough honey and ended up with about 3/4 cup, so that was probably my problem. Other than that, they were okay. Next time i will not use ginger, maybe cinnamon instead, as the flavor was more powerful than I would have liked. Regardless, others liked them, just not so much me.

Well I tried a few variations and wasn't successful with any of them.  I found the flavour overall (without added variants) to be a bit bland.  OR maybe there is too much flour??   I also found the cooking time to be too long.  HOWEVER, BY REDUCING TO 7-8 MINS AND LEAVING ON PAN TO COOL FOR 5 MINUTES BEFORE TRANSFER TO COOLING RACK THE COOKIES TURN OUT MUCH NICER.  NOTE: Be ready for the cookies to expand like crazy!

These are very 'different' cookies, as far as your "typical American" cookie...  But, that doesn't mean they're bad!  I really enjoyed them, but the kids and husband had absolutely no interest, and the boy LOVES honey. Used 1.25 cups honey and .5 cup sugar.  Used mostly shortening, but ran out and used butter for the rest.  In addition to the ginger, I added nutmeg and cinnamon.  Very cakey cookies, but in a good way.  I thought they needed something to  give them a little push, so I whipped up a thin and simple glaze of powdered sugar, milk, a kiss of ginger and a bit of honey. (For me, I'd give 'em a four, but since the family avoided them like the plague - I'll stick with three.)

Disappointing as a cookie, but tasty in their own way.  They were very mild and moist.  If I made them again I would use more spices and serve them with breakfast, but it's probably not worth all the honey.

I did not love this receipe.  I think it needs a half cup more honey, and it needs to bake less time so it is more moist and "honey-like."  I did change the reciepe slightly by adding 1/2tsp of nutmeg and 1/2tsp of ginger, instead of 1tsp of ginger.  I will try this receipe again, but I would add more honey.

These are pretty good cookies. More like biscuit like cookies. Once you melt the margarine ,honey ,and sugar;it seems like it be too sweet. However,it so is not. Once the honey is mixed into the batter,it does not become as sweet. These cookies are good but they are more like biscuit cookies. Pretty good ,and I was able to use a big jar of honey I bought. I used brown sugar,would recommend the white sugar.

Dough will be a thick and slightly sticky consistency. They came out perfect and chewy after 8 minutes. I added cinnamon. Next time I might use more sugar and slightly less honey and a little less ginger.

My son made these cookies as a project for German Class at school.  The recipe was simple enough for him to follow without any trouble, and they turned out wonderfully.  He loves them!  The only thing we changed was to use my favorite shortening combo for cookies.....  half real butter, and half margarine.  (This gives you the best of both worlds....  the rich flavor of butter, but without the flat & runny cookie shape.)  The cookies had a nice shape, and turned a nice, light-golden brown in 9 minutes.

My only other note, as the recipe didn't specify: We did NOT grease the cookie sheets.  We merely let the cookies cool on the cookie sheet for a minute or two before removing them, and they held together just fine.

WONDERFUL!  I followed this recipe exactly and the cookies were soft and delicious.  The rich honey taste left a nice aftertaste.  I will most definitely make these again.

Super delicious! I'm not really a honey fan, but these were very sweet & yummy! Make sure you don't over-bake them or else they'll be crunchy. I checked on them after 10 minutes, just to be sure on the second batch.

I've been baking for over half a century and am very familiar with Heritage Recipes such as this one. I'm VERY glad that I read through all 8 pages of comments so I knew what to expect. I only halved the recipe, didn't change ANYTHING, but what I ended up with was a very loose "cake batter" type dough. It was utterly impossible to scoop, drop or any other measure of making it into a cookie. So...since so many reviewers mentioned that the finished product was more "cake-like than cookie-like", I poured the batter into a greased 8" x 8" pan, baked it for 20 minutes and ended up with Honey Bars! Once cooled, I cut them into 1" x 2" slices, and as a very simple "Tea Treat", they are perfect! As a cookie, not so much. I practice Mise en place so I know that all ingredients were correct; I'm just clueless as to WHY the dough became batter. Tried the bar two days in a row; was equally satisfying both days.

These cookies are amazing. i sprinkled a mixture of ground ginger and sugar over them before they baked, for added texture. Definately 5 stars.

These just weren't my cup of tea.  They baked nicely and were very easy to make.  I just don't think I liked the ginger taste but maybe my ginger was old.

These were nice and moist, but just didn't have that great of a flavor for me, and kind of turned out seeming like pancakes (very thin).  I was glad for the way to use up my honey, but I don't think I would make these again.

I liked the recipie but I'm still mystfied that I put it much less sugar than the recipie called for and that was all I could taste still. Once I figure out the right ratio of sugar to the rest of the ingredients, then I will LOVE these cookies.

These weren't "bad", but they weren't spectacular either. They'd be great in a cookie jar for snacks, but not for special Christmas cookies.  I'll keep searching for a decorative special holiday cookie.

Very tasty, moist, with subtle hints of honey flavor. I made some "healthy adjustments"--half and half combos. of brown and white sugar, and whole wheat white flour and white flour. They were well-received at a recent Halloween party.

I made these for Rosh Hashana, and I also used 1 1/4 cup honey and 1/2 cup sugar. I thought they were very good, they remind me of cookies I used to  eat in Israel called Duvshaniyot. Those have a glaze on them, which might have helped these. I only gave them 4 stars because I served them with some other cookies, and I had the most left over of these. My relatives said they were good, but a little bland, and not as sweet as they would have imagined. Anyway, they were delicious with tea.

We love the texture of these cookies - dense and soft.  I tried adding a bit of lemon juice to give them more flavor (as some reviewers said they were a little bland), but I think that a lot of that flavor went away when I added the baking soda in on top of the lemon juice - fizz!  I....ummm...forgot that would happen.  They still came out lovely.  The dough had a very strong ginger flavor, but that did mild out a bit when they baked.  They'd be wonderful with a bit of lemon glaze drizzled over top.  I'll definitely make this recipe again as we all love soft cookies and the honey flavor was lovely.  I think that with a glaze that they'd be a 5 star.

Good Cookies but, not great. They were a little bland and needed something else. I think next time I might add some orange to them or maybe ad some nuts. I'm not quite sure what it needs but the just seemed a little bland. I made them for my family and they were less than impressed. So I took them to work and they ate them up but nobody raved about them.

These cookies are so soft!  I made bigger balls with my hands (the first batch with teaspoon-measured cookies got too crispy).  I split up the sugar between white and brown, and then did 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp ginger (next time I'll try a whole tsp of ginger instead.  So yummy!

I went with the stronger honey recipes with 1.5 cups of honey and one cup of sugar. Everything else was right by the recipe. The cookie begins in your mouth cakey, but the more you chew the consistency becomes more gooey.  It was a little surprising, but a good surprise. I gave it a four star rating because the flavor is somewhat muted. The seasoning disappears. It's also a very slow process of mixing.

I really like this recipe! it's a big  hit with my family and simple to make too. I personal like to use orange extract in place of vanilla and cinnamon instead of ginger. I also add jam/preserves to the centers of each cookie.

I made some of the recommended alterations and while the cookies turned out fine, the recipe is inherently bland. I used 1 1/4 c honey, 1/2 c sugar, 1/2 t cinnamon,  1/2 t ginger, 1/2 t  nutmeg, 1 c butter, 1 c whole wheat flour, 3 c flour, 1 t soda.

GREAT! The recipe is easy and fast to do (all I like!). The cookies were delicious and soft. My cookies didn't "look as cookies". Despite this, they were perfect. Surely I'm going to do this recipe again.

* I've changed the white sugar for confectioner's sugar and I haven't put ginger (personal choice). By the way, I added cinnamon and everything went well. 

* I did it for me and my family. My family liked it.

I made these cookies today and they are yummy.. I cooked them for exactly for 11 mins on a tinfoil lined cookie sheet and they were perfect. I did substitute the vanilla for sugar free maple syrup as I didn't have vanilla. I also used Stevia in place of real sugar. They will be tasty with some Frozen Vanilla yogurt!!

These cookies are delicious exactly as written. Mine were nice and soft and chewy, not like the hockey pucks that some have described. (I wonder if they over-cooked the honey mixture?) Really simple and lovely! And I have a lot of honey to use up, so I'll definitely be making these again!

I made this recipe as written and it turned out great. Super easy to throw together and they baked to a nice golden brown with a soft texture. These will definitely get made again!

Simple fix to all the complaints about flavor...theres no salt in this recipe. Just needs a teaspoon or so and you'll be suprised how the cookie will taste sweeter and the honey and ginger will really come through.

Been searching years for a recipe to the honey cookies my grandmother used to make. This is it. The texture, the flavors, all perfect. I followed this almost exactly and the cookies are everything I've been dreaming about for years. I didn't have ginger and neither did my grandmother. So I switched it for cinnamon which I know she used in hers. I hate reviews based off a recipe that was altered personally but I can't imagine it changed the flavor profile that much and I didn't have an option. Sorry!

Husband said they tasted like fortune cookies. Very difficult dough to work with even after refrigeration. Not bid on taste either.

Having never melted shortening, honey, & sugar together before, I was pretty unsure of just how cooled down it had to be before adding the ginger & egg mixture.  I used my best judgment, waiting until the saucepan was warm but touchable on the bottom.  Also, I felt quite confused when I realized that I would be adding the flour into the saucepan as well (I missed that part when I first read the directions); the dough fit very well in a 2 qt pot.   The dough was easy to shape once dropping the tsps on the baking sheet, so the cookies can end up very round if you want them to.  The consistency is somewhat biscuit-like, and they are delicious!  I've never tasted anything like them!  They do come out of the oven puffed up, but they flatten after a few minutes.  I can see having these with tea or at a tea party.

Very good. Do NOT use the honey in the cute little bear from Kroger. Use instead a good honey. It's definitely worth the investment.

I'm honestly not sure why I made these cookies because I hate honey. I thought they sounded interesting though so I made them. They use quite a bit of honey so be prepared for that. I also used vegetable shortening rather than normal shortening. Make sure you melt the sugar, honey and shortening until it all becomes a homogenous consistency and color. Since you are working with sugar you should stir frequently and as it becomes liquid you should stir constantly to prevent it from burning. This recipe makes quite a few cookies and they came out nice and soft. I found that 11 minutes in my oven was perfect and 12 was too much .So play with times based on your oven. Despite the fact that I don't like honey I found these cookies interesting and I think my friends will like them.

I made these things a while back. This is one of the easiest cookies i have ever made! Simple ingredients, simple time limit, great for large scale! Iv found, that refrigerating the dough in between placing cookies makes it way easier to rol with your hands, and making the cookies smaller (roughly smaller than a tea spoon in size) makes the serving WAY bigger! Love these cookies!

Ok but I will not make this again. This is a soft cookie, but not very moist. The flavor is ok, good honey taste, but too much ginger. I think they need a little kick of something like lavender, or rosemary. I packed them away in plastic bags. Reminds me of the kind of cookie that might improve with age.

I added a little extra flour and got some super delicious, cake-y cookies! The first batch was great, but I was hoping for a stronger ginger taste. So, I added a little more to the rest of the dough before baking. Perfect!

Soft & chewy like a really good sugar cookie with the smooth sweetness of honey. We really loved these just the way they are. I took half the batter and mixed in fresh grated orange peel which went well with  the orange blossom honey I had used. They keep a long time.

I really like these cookies.  I'm a big fan of straight forward, simple cookies that aren't overly sweet.  I did take the suggestion to use 1+1/4c honey and 1/2c sugar as well as substitute butter for the shortening.  My dad's a beekeeper, so I've got free access!  The flavor is very light and these freeze very well.  I will say, be careful to heat the honey/sugar/butter mixture on low and keep a solid eye on it.  My latest batch were a lot runnier and the only difference was that I'd accidentally melted everything down on medium-high.

Made these as per the recipe. The dough was really sticky and hard to work with. The end result was a light and fluffy cookie with a little bit of crispness as it cools. However, they taste rather bland, akin to graham crackers. I probably won't make these again.

So glad to find this recipe again!  I have fond memories of my maternal grandmother keeping a huge cookie jar filled with these for me.  She used to add orange zest to her recipe, for a light citrusy touch.  Thank you so much for sharing!

Came out incredibly perfect! I ran out of flour after two cups and used pancake mix for the rest. I also subbed margarine for shortening as  I was also out of that too.

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for, a rustic, old world honey cookie. I did adjust the recipe to 1.5c of honey and 1/2c of sugar, and halved the ginger. I baked mine on a stone pan, which can yield longer cooking time/softer cookies. 12 minutes was perfect for soft, dense, chewy cookies. I really wanted the honey flavor shine, and it was perfect! This isn't a typical "Americanized" super sweet cookie. It's the perfect cookie to showcase the old world charm!!

I have never made this recipe or heard about this as a German Christmas cookie. I have a German background. This is a really good recipe. A really nice soft cookie and I love the hint of ginger in the recipe. This is definitely a keeper and I will make for future Christmas cookies.

I'm not sure I like these cookies they were pretty boring. The first batch I cooked for 13 minutes and they were really on the done side. The second batch I made slightly smaller cookies, added cinnamon and more ginger and bake them for 10 1/2 minutes and they came out better - still not my favorite cookie.

They are yumm. I added fresh ginger juice and butter instead of shortening and ginger powder. I cut the sugar into half and increased the amount of honey. I made these on request of my 4 year old and he loved them.

I received good feedback from everyone that ate them. Two people said they were "very good" and proceeded to devour them. I didn't like them.

The milk was more appetizing than the cookies. I decided to follow others' reviews and change sugar to 1/2 c and honey to 1.25 c, and I added Cinnamon and Nutmeg. The first batch came out near tasteless, and my mother suggested adding chunks of apple to the batter. The apple made it a bit better, but I still didn't like them. 

If I'd kept to the original sugar and honey amounts (and perhaps upped the spice amounts, and changed the shortening to butter), MAYBE they would have turned out better. My parents and little sister all said they were "not bad," but I get the feeling they were just being polite. I will never make these again.

*ALSO: I at first followed the advice of one user suggesting to wait until they were just a bit golden brown on the TOP, however mine never browned on the top. As a result, my first 9 cookies came out burnt. If your tops aren't browning, use the edges as a guide. If brown is just starting to peek out, they're done. Mine went for 11 minutes.

This recipe was absolutely sweet and delicious!  I made this recipe for my friends and we all enjoyed it.  In fact, almost everybody asked if they could have another.  My family had some as well and they thought it was great too.  The taste reminds me of tea with honey.  It was definitely a hit!

Tasty!  Just don't overcook them. I had to make a few changes due to lack of ingredients: sub oil for shortening, halved the amount of sugar because the honey I have is already loaded with sugar, added just a touch of cinnamon, a pinch of salt, and I didn't have vanilla. Still came out great! The dough was a sticky challenge, but the cookie was worth it.

My daughter and I made these for her German class and they were super easy to make and tasted really good. Perfect cookie to go with coffee or tea.

You definately have to wait for it to cool down before eating them. They come out fluffy and almost like a whoopie pie. (Also adjusted it to 1 1/4 c honey, 1/2 c sugar) I let it sit in the fridge overnight and scooped them small. They smell wonderful, taste okay, but I wanted a different texture.

I made these for a cookie exchange and did the math wrong on multiplying the recipe.  I made way too many cookies, but that turned out ok. I took them to work and people raved about them. They have a very interesting taste, in a good way.  Not too sweet. I subbed 1/4 cup honey for 1/2 cup of sugar. (Less sugar, more honey) and 1/3 of the shortening required was subbed by butter.  

I am so thankful this was a drop cookie recipe, I don't think I could have rolled 8 dozen balls.

I was intrigued by the unusual method. I used 1/2 cup of butter flavored shortening and 1/2 cup coconut oil, but found 
I needed another half cup of flour.  I added both grated ginger and crystallized ginger to the honey melt for a stronger flavor. I wanted an adult cookie! I also added chopped walnuts.  My cookies  were a delicious mix of ginger and walnut  the honey taste coming in third. I will make these again.

They turned hard when cooled so I must have done something wrong. I was looking for something that was a bit sweeter and soft. I will try the recipe again, but not sure what I did wrong...

these cookies are really good! they do spread a bit more than i was expecting them to, though.if you tend to make cookies big, make them a bit smaller or spread them farther than you normally would, as a lot of mine ended up running together. they still came out delicious though!

Do not make these.  I made them for an Octoberfest party and nobody liked them.  They said they were very bland.
