This did not taste good to me.  It needs some sugar or condensed milk and a little less cream cheese.  It had a salty flavor.  I will not make it again.

This pie may be quick, but is seriously lacking in taste and appearance.  It looks like a white chunky mess with dark spots in it.  I would not make this again. I almost took it somewhere too.

When  I posted this recipe I forgot the put in the instructions to MELT the chocolate chips.  It is much better that way

After reading the other reviews, I made a few changes. First off I mixed up the cream cheese until creamy. I then used a 1/2 c of peanut butter and added a 1/2 c of powdered sugar. I also used chocolate cool whip instead of the regular flavor. I omitted the chips. Turned out fantastic for my peanut butter loving family.

I made this pie for my mother's birthday and the whole family dug into it and loved it! I really liked it because it's more rich and "peanut buttery" than most of the other peanut butter pies I've eaten. Today is Mother's Day and I'm going to fix it for her again! :-) Thanks for a great recipe Joanne!

It would be better with powdered sugar in it, or something.

I drizzled Chocolate on the top, and added peanuts to give it a little extra bonus!

I ended up adding about twice the amount of peanut butter, and that seemed to do the trick.  It was fairly, rich, and sweet enough for my taste. No, it isn't pretty, but maybe melting some of the chocolate chips to drizzle on top would help.

The title of this pie made it sound appealing.  However, after reading ingredients like store-bought frozen whipped topping and pie crust, it sounded vile .  I would be ashamed to serve this to family & friends.  If you love your family, apply more effort.

I added some Stevia in the mixing and put it in a Chocolate Graham crust!  Yummy!

Instead of using 1/4 cup peanut butter and 1 cup of melted chocolate chips, I cheated and added some DELICIOUS Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate spread into the cream cheese / whipped cream mixture. I topped with a handful of chopped roasted peanuts and semi-sweet chocolate chips. SO YUMMY! We liked this a lot. Just make sure your cream cheese is room temp, and blend it VERY thoroughly to get the lumps out.
