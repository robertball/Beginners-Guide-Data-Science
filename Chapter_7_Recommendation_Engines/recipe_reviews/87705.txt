This was pretty good, I felt like it was missing something. It needs a slight tangy flavor added to it.

Never thought to thank you for this wonderful recipe . . . I recently changed computers and had it on the old desktop (no printer) and was stressing about finding it again. I hate when people change recipes, but . . . I recently made LEMON marmalade and am going to try it with that. Although, I probably shouldn't tinker with perfection . . . .

This was one of the better chicken recipes that I have made in a long time! It does take a while to make, but I think the time is so worth it in the end. The chicken was done perfectly, and was so tender and moist that we only needed a fork to cut it. The tangy flavor of the marmalade and lemon juice was perfect. This is one that I will definitely make again soon. Thank you for the recipe, MAGGIEMAEWEST!

I really enjoyed this recipe, it was easy and it's something different to do with your chicken.  I omitted the orange marmalade because I had none and no substitute but I don't think it made a difference.  The taste was very good and my family gave it thumbs up!

I didn't have Marmalade onhand so I used plum sauce instead. I also added mushrooms to the sauce. Served with Asparagus it was fantastic! will definitely be using this one again :)
