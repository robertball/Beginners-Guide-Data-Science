Oh no, this chili begs for more.   Spices in teaspoon amounts are blasphemous. Forget this one - here let me hand you a recipe that will make even a Texans knees buckle (and yes, I put it to the test) : 

-About 2.5 lb of pork loin.  Trim off xtra fat and cut into 1.5 inches chops
-3cans of beans of choice DO NOT DRAIN
-6 oz tomato paste
-16 oz of salsa of choice (I like Medium)
-1 sm. Onion chopped coarsely
-1  red or green pepper chopped coarsely 
-Chili powder, Cumin, Oregano and be generous, coat the meat. 
-1 chicken bullion not broth, broth makes it soupy
-12 rings of jalapenos (optional)
2 bay leaves (optional)

Throw that in a crock  pot and an hour before its ready pull out the pork and pull it apart and give it one more hour. It will change your life.  enjoy ;)

I used all ingredients except chicken broth and sour cream. Not only tasty but pleasant texture. I used leftovers to make quesadillas with my Breville sandwich press. I will make this again for same day and leftover versatility.

I've made this a ton of times, I just never used a recipe. Yummy, but nothing spectacular.

I tweaked the recipe a bit. Used 2 pound pork should roast with 1 can of low sodium chicken broth, one 16 oz jar of medium salsa, 1 can of kidney beans drained, 1 can tomato paste and 1 Tb each of cumin, chili powder, onion powder and oregano. Cooked on low 8 hours then shred pork and cooked another hour on low. Topped with green onion, shredded cheese and sour cream. It was delicious. Will make again but adding another can of beans.

This is not chili. It is more like bean soup with chili powder.  BTW, I don't come from Texas and am  usually not picky about chili recipes, because I know that there are thousands of variations, but like I said, "This is soup".  Maybe a can of tomato paste, another can of kidney beans and some more spices might help this.

I originally made as written but then added another can of beans (chili beans is what I had on hand). I should also note that for my tomatoes I used canned Rotel. It definitely added flavor and heat that I thought would have been lacking if I hadn't used the Rotel.  Even with the extra can of drained beans this was a little thin and more like a soup than a chili but that didn't matter to me. It was delish! Play around with it if you feel the need  but that is just one more great thing with this recipe. It is flexible
