Simple but satisfying, serve with a nice green salad for nigh on summer lunch perfection! I find light mayonnaise is just as good as full fat for this..and better for you ;)

WOW! When I posted this I definitely thought it was private, I'm glad everybody likes this!!  I can't figure out how to edit this, so I'll say this:  2 tablespoons = two heaps of the big spoon in your silverware drawer. Add salt & pepper (or garlic powder or greek seasoning) to taste.  I am an onion fiend, that's why it calls for so much onion. :D

My Mom has made a version of this since we were kids..she uses an equal amount of mayo and miracle whip, and adds canned peas and shredded cheddar.  Sometiems she'll use shell pasta instead.

This was a simple yet tasy recipe!  Great for a quick lunch (and leftovers the next day).  I took another users tip and left out some of the onion; I added some diced  black olives, celery salt and salt and pepper to taste!  I think it would have been a little bland without the celery salt and pepper...but overall a good recipe!  I'll definetley make it again.

OK, it was easy.  But I don't know what the raves are about because it was dry and very boring.  There is SO little mayo in this.  It was liking eating bland plain pasta.  After I refrigerated some of it, I had to add *quite* a bit of mayo to make it edible as it had dried out so much.  This doesn't even make a good base to work with because it's so dry.  Sorry, but I don't get it.

Not bad, but definitely needs some spicing up. However, a glance at the recipe should tell you this.  There is no reason you can't add some italian seasoning, tomatoes, and pickles, which is what I did.  I also chopped up the last few hearts of palm I had in the jar to add to this salad. Served at a bbq today and several people commented that it was good.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is kind of boring.  The 2 tablespoons of Mayo is not enough.  I close to doubled that and threw in some salt and pepper just for some extra flavor.  It was very easy however!

This is a very simple, staple type recipe. I used tuna in water instead of oil to save calories but added more mayo (at least it was a lower cal version)! I decided to add some celery salt since I always add it to chicken or tuna salad, and it gave this recipe a little more pizazz.  It definitely tastes better the second and third day..this recipe is a keeper!

OK, so this is a great basic recipe that can be 'tweaked' as much or as little as you want. I had a huge package of elbow macaroni that I didn't know what to do with so this is perfect.  I used water packed tuna and a little more mayo my hubby wanted Miracle Whip in his.

Very Good, Very Basic lunch recipe. Added spices to my liking and served. My kids ages 3 and 4 loved it. I live in Missouri where eating a hot lunch is painful in our weather and this was refreshing because I didn't have to use the stove a lot. Easy and fast. Thank You!

Plain and simple salad.  I added celery and more mayonnaise because I used tuna in water and thought maybe that was why it seemed dry.

I had to 'tweak' this quite a lot for our taste.  I added more mayo, some chopped sweet pickles, sprinkled with a little Greek seasoning, then served with grape tomatoes on the side.  Ended up with every one dumping tomatoes into their salads.

This is another one of my basic staples, I'm a poor pasta addict, and prefer eating it cold to hot anyday. Very easy to make, and I don't mind touches of blandness, so it's really not that bad!

Try adding some chopped celery, green pepper and hard boiled eggs.  It makes a good summer salad.

I agree this is very easy, basic and ....sorry...flavorless! It is okay I guess if you are on a college student's budget, and don't have time to make a nice tasty salad, but in that case, just throw some canned tuna in some Kraft Dinner and chill it.  Otherwise this recipe is too much trouble for the poor results.  There are better macaroni tuna salad recipes on this site that are not too much more expensive but take a little more time with great results.

I like this recipe, quick and simple!! I didn't have elbow pasta so instead I used tri-colored rotini and it tasted amazing! Some people were suggesting adding other items and so I added a yellow bell pepper which gave it a nice crunchy texture.

I grew up loving/eating this so I made it for my children several years ago......not such a big hit for them.  I couldn't believe it!   I just recently made this again, probably will just be me eating it again but I'm okay with that!  

I put mine together differently though, I mix all of the ingredients together except the macaroni while the macaroni is cooking.  Then when the macaroni is added, it mixes more evenly.  I think I added less macaroni because I like a more even mixture of tuna to noodles.  I'm sure I used more mayo than the original amount listed and the recipe says you can add more to taste.  I also add a little bit of yellow mustard for extra flavor.  I also add the extra mayo because this tends to dry out somewhat in the fridge.  I think this tastes better after it's been refrigerated at least a few hours prior to serving but that's just a personal preference.

Liked this version of an old family summer favorite. I add grated hardboiled eggs as well, and serve with some wedge-cut or sliced hard boiled eggs arranged around the edges. Celery salt also a good suggestion, I tried it and like it.

The macaroni WILL soak up the mayo, so if you make it ahead of time, be prepared to add some more just before you serve it. Otherwise it will get kind of dry and not have that creaminess that makes it awesome comfort food (if not great for the waistline).

My picky 12 year old (who will starve vs eat something he doesn't like) actually had seconds.  That is saying something!

I love this salad!  It's so versile, you can add or subtract anything you want.  I added some leftover turkey, it was amazing!  I also added a bit more mayo and seasoned it up a bit to my liking.  I encourage everyone to try it.  :)
