This is a 5+ star recipe - made exactly as the recipe is written. I used tri-color spiral pasta.  I used white wine vinegar, therefore, no need for additional white sugar, lightly toasted the sesame seeds in the microwave and  served with a few baked Snappea Crisps on each plate. Super easy recipe from an awesome lady.  Fran, you are a blessing!

This was good! I chopped the spinach up and threw everything in a bowl and refridgerated overnight instead of saving some of the ingredients for right before serving. The noodles sopped up the liquids really well! I ommited the green onion b/c I don't like it. Using reg. soy sauce i/o reduced sodium and omitting the salt works well. And, if you are sugar conscious, 4 packets of Splenda can replace the sugar. I forgot to put the N*R. Oops!

Prepared for the Recipe Group this week. Followed the recipe, except used brown sugar in place of the white, allowing it to sit for several hours with the first half of the dressing and then tried it. Just a little too sharp from the vinegar for our taste. I added a little more brown sugar to the remaining half of dressing and threw in the rest of the ingredients. Hubby and kids tried it and all agreed that it needed an addition of some crunch and a little fresh flavor to break-up the chicken/pasta texture, bold dressing, and brownish color from
the soy sauce. We decided on a thinly sliced bell pepper mixture (red/yellow and orange) and followed "bellepepper's" addition of  just a few quartered cherry tomatoes. That did the trick. Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe!  It is a delightful summer salad that is so different from traditional pasta salads.  The only thing I changed was to substitute 1 tablespoon of sesame oil for one of the tablespoons of oil.  And I took the suggestion to add peas.  Love it!

I really, REALLY loved this one! I added Sriracha and didn't measure my greens -- I'm pretty sure I at least doubled them all, if not tripled the onion and spinach. I chose to mix all ingredients EXCEPT spinach and then serve the mixture over a bed of fresh spinach, to make a dinner salad, and added a splash of dressing to coat the spinach. It was absolutely fantastic and I look forward to making this every time rotisserie chicken is on sale! Thanks for the recipe, and I'm glad the one I voted for didn't win this week, because otherwise I'd never have tried this one -- Thanks, Recipe Group!

I made half of this recipe for Recipe Group.  It was very good!  I followed the recipe, but substituted brown sugar for the white, and I did add an extra teaspoon to my half recipe because I thought it needed it – probably due to the fact that there’s a lot of soy sauce and vinegar in this and very little oil, making it quite tart/tangy.  I also thought this really could use some more color so I added sliced grape tomatoes.  I happened to have some wonton strips so I added those as a garnish, which added a nice crunch.

Made this to take for lunch and it was perfect.  Both my husband and I liked.  Added some peas in for some green/color.

I gave the original recipe as written 3 stars; but 4 stars with adjustments and additions I made to “jazz” up the salad. I boiled tri-colored rotini pasta in salted water. Chopped up some leftover rotisserie chicken and set aside. For the dressing, I used 3T low-sodium soy sauce, 2T sugar and 3T white wine vinegar. I seasoned the dressing with Hawaiian sea salt, black pepper and some fresh grated ginger. I also put about 1T of toasted sesame seeds to the dressing. Instead of veg/canola oil I used 2 T of sesame oil for flavor; and, fresh cilantro in place of parsley for another layer of flavor. Once I drained the pasta, I poured half of the dressing over it and chilled in the refrigerator for 4 hours. I tossed in fresh baby spinach, chicken and the remainder of the dressing. This needed some color and texture so I added sugar snap peas, carrots, julienned, and cherry tomatoes, quartered. I garnished with green onions, sliced, more cilantro and a generous sprinkle of sesame seeds. This was the most delicious and hearty pasta salad-perfect for a hot summer meal!  The dressing has the right amount of soy sauce, sugar and vinegar-not too sweet or too tart. The pasta soaked up the dressing giving it lots of flavor. It’s a very colorful salad full of chicken, greens, vegetables and fresh herbs. The addition of cilantro, ginger and sesame oil gave this the “Asian” flavor I wanted in the salad.

Excellent recipe.  Very quick, easy to make.  Marinade time negotiable.  Ironically, my 16 month old daughter tried to pick all the spinach out because it was the brightest color...

Second time making this: I used sesame oil instead of canola oil.  It tasted great.  I also used garden rotini which made it more colorful.  Very tasty recipe and low calorie if served as the entree/main course.  Definitely a keeper.

Made this for Recipe Group:  21, May 2011.  My family really enjoyed this one.  I made a triple batch so we would have leftovers.  I put a double batch of dressing on the pasta and chicken to marinade in and made another batch for serving purposes.  At serving time we did add fresh cut tomatoes for the added vegetables.  For the leftovers I'm going to add tomatoes and cucumbers.  This will be a great summer salad.  Thanks Fran for sharing.

I made this for recipe group this week. Probably more like 3.5 stars for me but I rounded up for flavor as I served it.  It was easy enough but a lot of dirty dishes for a simple pasta salad, nothing crunchy and too much dressing. We put the second half of the dressing on the table rather than mixing in and only I added extra, but not much. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 Tbl because, well, that's what I do with everything. We were surprised how much flavor the seeds added but still thought it needed some crunch and color so added some rice noodles and coarsely shredded carrots and. I was going to serve some grape tomatoes with it but forgot so maybe next time.

This was very good. We don't like cold noodle salad, so I actually served it hot. Next time, I might add some chili sauce, just for a little bite, but overall very good.
