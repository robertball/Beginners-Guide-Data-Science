This is wonderful! I used a large child's plastic sand bucket w/ shovel instead of cups. I put gummy sharks, octopus', mini red swedish fish, and alligators on top, along with umbrellas. I also put some gummies thru out the pudding/cool whip mixture-DO NOT DO THIS! It's hard to chew cold gummy candies! Everyone liked it though, including adults! It was yummy!!

This is a fun dessert, really looks like sand!    I have made this several times and when I do I always have to give out the recipe. Both kids and adults enjoy this...

Fun for the kids. My 6 year old got a kick out of making the cookies into crumbs and was very excited to pick out his choice of the gummy treats for on top. MILD pleasant vanilla dessert for me (without the gummy stuff).
I tried it again with lemon pudding and crushed gingersnaps and it was even better...but the kids didn't like my version as well.
KEEP IT COLD. Chill the bowl and glasses if using them. Keep chilled completely till served. It is not as good room temp.

I tried this recipe and it was a big hit at the birthday party for my granddaughter.I used mini sand pails that were about 3 inches tall.I washed the pails and followed the cup recipe.Kids thought it was so much fun to eat out of the pails.Then they took the pails home for their party favor.This would be great to make any time.

I folded crumbs into one and one without. The one with crumbs in the pudding mixture itself was thick and almost gummy. The one without crumbs folded into the pudding was excellent. Kinda like the texture of nuts and ice cream. Next time I will have everything ready and assemble the cups at the last minute.  I liked this as much as the kids. If you like mousse, cream pies, and anything with whipped cream, this is your dessert! I would wait until the last minute to top with sand and worms because I think the dry texture of the "sand" is best as a contrast. Nilla wafers were so nice and deeply vanilla. Wonderful combination.

Quick dessert and very good. I tried to make this a little healthier: instead of instant pudding mix I bought organic pudding already done, then I omitted the milk and used organic vanilla waffles. The kids didn't care for this but my husband and I loved it.

Cute dessert for the kids.  I think next time I will skip the crumbs in the pudding and only use them at the bottom of the cup and on top.

These are a fun "food project" to do with kids. My son and my nieces enjoyed making the pudding, crushing the cookies (I put the cookies in a ziploc bag and let the kids smash them with a rolling pin)and layering everything in the glasses. As far as taste goes, they were good but the kids prefer the "mud" version with oreo's and chocolate pudding.

Made these for my daughter's birthday beach party sleepover. The kids loved it...didn't use gummy candies, but placed a little paper umbrella in each cup for a beachy look. Also used a layer of vanilla and a layer of chocolate pudding. Very cute idea!

I make this recipe all the time. It's delicious and goes over well every time I prepare it. I've been making it since my sons were very young. They are now 16 and 17 and still love it. It is also a great companion to "dirt."

Easy and super cute!  I used 2 pkg of ff french vanilla pudding and doubled the milk, but kept the rest of the ingredients the same.  I put 1/2 of the crushed cookies on the bottom (I used a new sand pail and shovel) and the other 1/2 on the top- none mixed in.  I topped with some Swedish fish.  The kids loved it!

OMG!  I am making these for my daughters bday for school and I added little mini chocolate chips to the pudding mixture and I just sampled it!  It is yummy out of this world good!  I didn't expect it to be so delicious!  I think the chocolate chips made it!!  I also used 3 cups of milk, 1 lrg pudding and 1 sm pudding package and two teaspoons of vanilla extract for a more thickness and barvarian flavor.  I am putting them in mini beach pails with shovels for the kids to eat with and decorating the top with all kinds of cute things.  I will post a picture later!!  PS... used my Ninja blender/chopper for wafers and they came out just like sand in seconds!!

This recipe was a huge hit with the playgroup that we are in.  I made them as a snack to compliment a "sand/water playdate" and the kids loved them!  I followed the recipe exactly using individual clear cups for the kids.  I topped them off with little gummie penguins to simulate a beach.. and put some blue jello on half to simulate water (Yes, I know.. Penguins dont go on a beach, but it was adorable!)  -  The kids love this recipe!

I made this as an alternative to cake for my 11 y/o daughter's birthday party.  It went over well and was easy to make ahead, tote (we put the glasses in shallow box) and clean up.  It was a little drab as we used gummy worms.  I think sharks spread throughout the pudding/cool whip filling would be really cute.

My daughter has been wanting to make this for a while and after finally finding the gummy octopus candies, she finally had everything she needed. We did use gluten free vanilla sandwich cookies instead of vanilla wafers. My daughter made the recipe completely on her own, including decorating. I thought they were too sweet but my kids loved them.

Cute, easy (no bake!) and tasty kids dessert to bring to a BBQ or summer party. My 4 and 7 year old had a lot of fun helping me make it. My only deviation to the recipe was to add 5 Oreo cookies to the vanilla wafer crumbs (definitely use a blender or it will turn out lumpy). Made it look more like the kind of sand we're used to:)
