This recipe is mediocre if it is all you are planning to do with the eggplant.  It is quite bland.  However, I am impressed by how crisp is gets in the oven, so kudos on that.  Overall, I think this is a good alternative to frying eggplant for another recipe, or a good start for eggplant parmesan.  

One hint for those of you who may not know:  if you find eggplant to be too acidic, always be sure to buy the "male" eggplants (they are long and thin compared to the "females" which are shorter, fatter and rounder).   Also, you can sweat the eggplant before you use it.  So, slice it (or cube it or whatever you are doing with it) and rub it with a little lemon juice (eggplant browns quickly once cut), and salt it heavily.  Let it sit for 30-60 minutes.  You will find a puddle of pinkish tinted liquid at the end of the time.  Then quickly rinse it and follow your recipe.  You will find doing this makes is FAR less acidic or strong tasting. Enjoy!

This is a great replacement for oily fried eggplant.  I have tried baking them before, but they weren't nearly as crispy and tasty.  I did substitute reduced fat sour cream and increased the oven temp to 350.  Definitely a keeper!

Very nice trick, especially if you don't want to mess with frying.  You can even leave out the flour & sour cream, if you want.  I added misc. seasonings to the breadcrumbs, and baked them on a pizza stone. They turned out nice and firm...cooked thru with no mush.  I topped them with cheese and then broiled for the last few minutes.  I plan on trying this technique next time I make eggplant parmesan.

I love eggplant but hate the calories when it is fried. This recipe tastes fantastic and had a wonderful light texture, crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. A great beginning for eggplant parmesan.

Like another said, didn't taste done.  tasted like I was eating bread crumbs with eggplant.  My wife "fixed" it by deep-frying it, and then adding a simple tomato sauce (not much) over the taste.  Came out wonderful, albeit "mushy" inside like the original recipe tried to prevent.  Also, there is NO WAY you can prepare this in 10 minutes.  More like 30 to 45 minutes! Sour cream is a nice touch!

I love fried eggplant, but this recipe is a little on the dry side, I thought.  I kinda missed the oil-flavor.  Next time I might drizzle some olive oil on top before baking, just to see what happens.  But It is definitely lower in fat & calories than regular fried eggplant!

These are so cruchy and scrumptious!  I decided to make mine into french fry size peices rather than slices, however by doing this you start running out of the sour cream and egg mixture pretty quickly since it is so thick.  I solved for this by adding about 1/4 cup of milk to water it down just a little which also made it easier to coat, however I would recommend that if you want "fries" out of this you should plan for double the batter mixture.  My "tweak" didn't change the flavor at all from the ones that were coated heavy to the lighter ones, but the ones without the milk were heavier with the breadcrumbs and hence came out more hearty so it really depends on your preference.  Overall this tasted great though.  One other thing I will keep in mind is to add some some salt or other spices to the flour next time to make them even more tasty.  A

Definitely a keeper! I can't understand why anyone would say this is tasteless or rate it down because it's messy(?) to make?? Well, thankfully my taste buds aren't dead yet! And, don't we all salt and/or pepper to taste anyway? The italian seasoned bread crumbs and the sour cream give it great flavor anyway - I just added a bit of salt after baking. One thing I don't use is cooking spray though. I drizzled the baking dish with EVO and sprinkled EVO again on reverse side after turning. Man, even the crumbs are good! Been looking for a recipe like this one with a great texture and flavorful - finally found it, thank you for sharing!!

If you like eggplant, it works fine to bake it. I didn't use eggs, sour cream or flour - just salted the eggplant and let it rest, then shook it in seasoned bread crumbs, spritzed with olive oil and bake. To my mind, baked tastes better than fried. Crisp and not inundated with oil. I'm sure the sour cream and eggs would be nice but not necessary.

Nice and crispy, but the flavor depends entirely on if the breadcrumbs are seasoned.  I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and Greek yogurt instead of sour cream - tangy and savory.  I liked this cooking method better than frying.

I'm sorry, but I just didn't like this very much. I thought it might approximate the eggplant tempura I get at Japanese restaurants, but it mostly just tasted like a thin layer of toast on eggplant slices to me. I tried it with marinara and it was still too dry. If I make this again, I might try seasoning the eggplant before breading it. It *is* healthier to make eggplant this way, instead of in a greasy and saucy stir-fry, but for now, I think I'll stick to the less-healthy but super-tasty Szechuan Spicy stir-fry (also on AllRecipes)for my eggplant fix. Thanks anyway!

Hey Kris, just wanted you to know that my gang ate this eggplant up like they were potato chips! Unlike others, we didn't need the marinara sauce as we all LOVED just as is. I didn't have any sour cream in the house, so I whirled some cottage cheese and lemon juice in the food processor and it worked out fine. I added some parm to the tops of the eggplant too. Great and healthy recipe!

This was crispy but required 2 T of o.o. on a foil lined pan and a liberal spraying of the tops of the eggplant. Like another reviewer, I used a mix of mayo and egg for dipping and I added 1/2 t of cayenne, salt & pepper, and extra italian seasonings into the crumbs. Finished with sprinkling of italian cheese and sides of marinara and spaghetti. With those changes, this recipe would be to 4 stars.

Just loved this recipe, turned out nice & crispy on the outside but still tender on the inside!!! The only things I changed were I added garlic & a little red pepper (I love spicy) and I had to thin out the sour cream a little more, even with the egg the mixture was just too thick to dip the eggplant in.

This is a great eggplant dish.  I used milk (about 1/3 cup) and pretty heavily seasoned my breadcrumbs with spices and cheese.  I also pumped the oven up to 400 for the last 10 minutes or so.  Super crispy and not mushy - even my 3 year olds ate it!

This was a great recipe, though I did make a couple changes.  I skipped the sour cream (though I'd like to try it next time), and I drizzled olive oil over the eggplant before and when I flipped the eggplant in the middle of baking.  The eggplant turned out very moist and flavorful.  I baked it at 350 for the 30 minutes other reviewers recommended, and mine was a bit mushy in the middle.  I'd keep the baking temperature the same, but I would probably reduce the baking time by 5-10 minutes.

I found this recipe to be one of the best uses for eggplant yet!!  I didn't have sour cream on hand so I substituted plain yogurt with very good results. I think that an oven temp of 350 would be better but still bake for the entire time.   I sprinkled the slices with parm cheese after the baking process was completed.  I think I'll try it with some spaghetti sauce on the side the next time.   Will certainly make this again.

This was ok but the end result wasn't worth the effort.  I make a dipping mixture of reduced fat ranch dressing and horseradish which reminded me of a fried appetizer at a restaurant.  I increased the temp. to 350 per another reviewer's suggestion and cooked longer.   Also used reduced fat sour cream and egg beaters.

I loved it!! Very simple to follow...no guess work.  this recipe is creative and allows you to fully taste the eggplant without it being saturated in grease. This definately replaces my fried eggplant recipe.  My heart thanks you:)

After baking them, I melted an Italian mix of cheese on them. Then I had warm marina sauce on the side and let my family eat them plain or with the sauce, instead of layering them like I usually do. My non-picky eaters liked it, especially my husband. One tip for breading them is to pour all the slices into a large bowl of flour. Use a spoon to coat them all. Then take them individually, shake off excess flour and put them in the batter. Once they are all in the batter, use a spoon to gently stir them around until all coated. Next, use a spoon or tongs, take them out individually, hold them over the bread crumb mixture. Using the other hand, use a spoon to dump the bread crumbs over each piece, then put it on the baking pan. This method is much less messy and helps so the bread crumbs and batter don't get all lumpy.

Very good place to start!  Adding the sour cream gives the breading a thickness and helps it stick so much better for bake-fake frying!  
I mixed the breadcrumbs with panko, and cubed tomatoes, mixed in salt and some high quality EVOO to top the eggplant with.  Hubby was very happy.  I look forward to trying this crumbing with other veggies too!!!

I made this as directed but after baking it for 45 minutes the eggplant was still firm and hard. The outside never turned crisp, either. I'm not sure what the issue is. Maybe the bottom line is that I like my eggplant relatively mushy!  I won't make this again.

This was a good was to prepare the eggplant, I used it to make an eggplant parmesean. I did some slices without the  flour step and I think that worked out better for me. Oh and  I cooked mine at 400 degrees for ten minutes on a side and it was brown and crispy! Thanks for sharing your recipe

Well, I thought the texture was good.  It really was crispy and tender, not mushy at all.  My problem was in the taste.  It was very bland. No taste at all.  I kept thinking add seasoning, but I wanted to check out the original recipe.  Will try again with seasonings.

It's not often I rate something poorly..  My "breading" didn't turn out as breading.   I followed the recipe exactly, and I ended up with a layer of crumbs around a layer of the sour cream, so that I had two distinctly different tastes/textures before I even hit the eggplant.  This recipe will not be repeated.

I changed the recipe slightly, I didn't use egg's or flour and and they still turned out crispy.  I also used reduced fat sour cream, mixing it with some italian herb seasoning then dipping the eggplant in that then the italian breadcrumbs.

I think you would need to use the yogurt or sour cream so this recipe doesn't taste so dry.  I tried both and the yogurt ones were better.

To spice it up, I added Durkee Six-Pepper blend to the bread crumbs, and a few shakes of hot sauce to the egg mixture.

Serve up with marinade, or with melted cheese.

I did not use the sour cream with this.  It was delicious, except for it definitely needs salt.  I used a little emeril essence with plain bread crumbs.  It really was good but I will add some salt next time.

When I made these, I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and crushed seasoned Ritz-cracker crumbs for the bread crumbs.  They were delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

I tried this recipe once and it was great! The eggplant came out wonderfully crisp with a creamy texture and a delicious flavour. I used self-seasoned store-bought breadcrumbs because plain breadcrumbs just aren't seasoned enough for my taste, so I spiced them up myself. I'm making this recipe again tonight for dinner and I'm going to see if I can't find a way to make it without using breadcrumbs at all. If I manage it I'll share!

This was really good! I would make it all the time if it weren't for the mess involved in dipping in SC and then bread crumbs. Oh heck! I might just do it anyway. Found myself snacking on them all afternoon and then put some spaghetti sauce and parm on top of the rest and put them in the broiler for dinner.

I don't like eggplant, but my husband does and he loved this. Baked not fried. Likes to eat it like a cookie.  And yes, it needs salt & pepper. I'll definitely make it again.

These weren't bad, and they were very quick. I would recommend melting some provolone or mozzarella over them. You could definitely use these for eggplant parm, and it was great that they were baked and very crunchy. I will use this recipe again!

Thanks Kris for a great recipe!  My description here is only what worked for me.  I followed the recipe as stated, however I did use garlic and 2 tablespoons olive oil in the egg/sour cream mixture.  I cut my eggplant in circles 1/2 an inch thick.  I would use Italian style breadcrumbs and half panko next time.  I found that after dredging in flour it was easier for me to use the back of a spoon to "frost" the slice of eggplant before coating in bread crumbs.  That way I could control how much was going on and make them uniform.  Baking did not create the crunchy goodness I was looking for.  I turned up the heat and resprayed them, still did not create crunchy.  I then put them under the broiler...YES they browned and resembled some crunch!  So next time, half breadcrumbs half panko, I will broil them instead of baking them.  The inside from baking and broiling did turn them a little softer than I would have liked.  They still had great flavor, I put marinara sauce on one, stacked another on top, more sauce and mozzarella cheese, then back under the broiler until bubbly!  I served them with linguine and sauce, stir fried hot pepper green beans and fruit.  They were very filling and yummy!

This recipe was great! I made a few small changes: I used panko bread crumbs seasoned with salt, garlic and pepper; I put a bit of oil on top of the eggplant before putting it in the over; I baked it at 350 and I put some fresh parmesan on top of the eggplant for the last two minutes. Delicious.

Great recipe.  Used Wegman's pan searing flour instead of the plain flour and add thyme, basil and oregano to the egg/sour cream mixture.  Used parchment paper on cookie sheets so I didn't need to add any extra oil.  I sliced the eggplant lengthwise into 1/4 inches strips instead of the rounds and baked for 20 minutes on each side.  The eggplant came out of the oven browned and crispy.  Thanks!

I was skeptical at first, but this turned out awesome!  Light, crunchy, and full of flavor!  I used half plain breadcrumbs and half panko breadcrumbs and baked on a rack inside a roasting pan (eliminates the oil).  I baked these and served over whole wheat spaghetti and spaghetti sauce.

I've never posted a review before but I had to for this!!!  This is hands down the best eggplant ever!!!  I made it exactly as the recipes says and then when they were done I put some homemade tomato sauce and a bit of shredded cheese on them and they were so good!  I saved the leftover eggplant (without the sauce and cheese) and then rebaked them the next day and they were still so crunchy and yummy!!!  I will make my eggplant this way from now on!!!

I loved this recipe. My husband even ate some.  I mixed the egg with 4oz of sour cream and 4 oz of mayo, also adding garlic salt to that. I did turn the oven to 400degrees and baked the eggplant 10min.on one side and 10min. on the other. I spritzed some olive oil half of my eggplant slices after they were battered and breaded and found we liked those better.  Then when they were done I sprinkled some shredded cheese on each slice and baked until melted.  Yummy!!!

My family and I agree that this is just ok.  The sour cream gives it an overwhelmingly funky taste (yes, we used fresh sour cream :).  Even though we greased our cookie sheet, every piece stuck to the bottom.

This turned out great, and for a lot less work than frying as well as fewer calories. Changes: didn't have sour cream, so I used....gasp...Miracle Whip!!! Also, sliced thinly and turned heat up to 350. Thanks, this recipe is just what I was looking for.

My husband just loves this recipe. It was fairly easy to do, too. After they were all baked, I added diced tomatoes and mozzarella cheese on top and baked them until the cheese was melted. Yummo as Rachel says.

VERY messy to make!  The egg/sour cream dip was too thick and stuck in glops on the eggplant slices.  So when they were then dipped in the breadcrumbs it was quite a mess.  I made sure the slices were thin, but had to cook much longer than the recommended time.  However, they tasted fairly good.  I won't make this again.

Using the sour cream mixture to glue the breadcrumbs onto the eggplant slices was an extremely messy undertaking, and the resulting texture was just not good. The flavor was very bland.  The whole family did not care for this.

This was not bad.  I mean, granted, it didn't crisp up as much as if it were fried in oil, but at least it wasn't nearly as fattening.  The one thing that annoyed me was that the batter was so thick.  When I put the eggplant into the breadcrumbs, it would just come off in globs of batter and I would have press the globs on the eggplant.  Plus, it was very messy, with the batter being so thick.  However, overall, this was a pretty good alternative to fried eggplant.

i did nto like this at all.  i had never tried eggplant before and i wanted something that was healthy and taste.  i dont know if it was the recipe or the eggplant, i but will never do that again.  IT was bland, and it wasnt mushy bwas soft for something that looked like it should be crunchy.

Sorry but this is not for me.  i dont think i will be eating eggplant for a long time.

Great combo!  I was a bit skeptical, but it came out great.  I used a larger eggplant so I had to have a 16oz sour cream and 2 eggs.  It did take longer to cook and ended up turning the oven up to 400 to get it really crispy!

Delicious! I've made this recipe several times now and it always turns out great - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, not mushy at all! The egg/sour cream mix is a little hard to work with, so I usually add some milk to thin it, but maybe I'll try cutting the sour cream next time or subbing yogurt as others recommend. Cooking time usually needs another 5 minutes, too. Sprinkle with a little salt as you take them out and even my picky husband likes it :)

Maybe healthier - but tasted unbelievably dry. Also the sour cream - egg batter didn't really hold the bread crumbs too well. Overall pretty bland tasting too. Will stick to frying for now.

I like making fried eggplant slices as a snack to nibble on, and I was looking for a healthier alternative to frying them. I tried this recipe and I was really pleased with it! The only thing I did different was instead of sour cream, I used fat free plain yogurt since that's what I had in the fridge. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! These were soooo good. I followed the recipe exactly, except mine didn't take as long to cook. Great taste, I did salt them when they came out of the oven though. Great taste w/o out all the fat from frying. Will make again and again.

We loved this eggplant. It was crisoy and delicious! I skipped the sourcream and added minced roasted garlic to egg instead. On top I sprinked basil, salt and pepper. And when they were done I sprinkled just a dab of fresh graded parm. It was perfect! I will definately make this again! Thanks!

Absolutely wonderful.  My changes: I dumped a bunch of dill and oregano in plain breadcrumbs, and cooked a little longer.  Served it with a little light tomato sauce.  We'll be having this on a regular basis.

I have made this several times already and really enjoy it! I usually serve it with spaghetti squash for a low card, meatless meal.  It is a refreshing change to not serve meat as a main entree.

Fantastic base for eggplant. After turning it we added a 1/4 inch slice of mozzarella and a slice of tomato the baked for 20 minutes. Everybody takes the recipe home with them.

Read through all the reviews as this was baking so was a bit concerned it would be bland.  Just took it out of the oven and it's excellent!  Used 1/2 seasoned bread crumbs and panko with 1/4 c Parmesan, 1 T Italian seasoning and pepper added.  Have found that if floured item  "rests" for a few minutes while mixing the the rest of the coatings, there is no issue with clumps falling off.  There was A LOT of leftover breadcrumbs.   Baked this at 350 on a rack after spraying with olive oil - sprinkled on a bit of garlic powder after turning, sprayed flip side with olive oil and raised the oven rack to help crisping based on other reviews.  As always when oven frying, will cool and refrigerate until dinner time & then reheat @400 until warmed through and really golden & crispy.  Sour cream adds a nice tasty tang!  Thanks for sharing a great, easy to personalize recipe Kris!

I was looking for an alternative to frying eggplant to make eggplant parmigiana. This worked perfectly and didn't affect the end taste. Thank you for a great recipe.

I think this is a great base, but by itself it would be bland. It only gets three stars because of this. It was a bit messy to make, but cooked fine and thankfully was not the usual mushy eggplant texture! After cooking one side for 15 minutes and the other for 20, I added a tablespoon of sauce and then some mozzarella cheese and broiled them until the cheese was melted. I served them on top of spaghetti with more sauce, but wound up also eating the eggplant on its own. I will make this again, but next time will add more herbs to the bread crumb mix.

Recipe easy and quick. Added dollop of Blue Cheese to eggplant rounds which added new flavor but didn't overpower the eggplants flavor. Must be cooked long enough to crisp and brown.

This was exactly the recipe I was looking for. :)   I love healthy alternatives, and don't like to fry anything.   The first time I made eggplant, it was very mushy.  I used this recipe as a base recipe for chicken parmesan, and it was amazing.    I did some seasonings and a lot of parmesan cheese to the bread crumb mixture.   I was impressed with how the eggplant turned out.. .no mush, and very tasty.   I would definitely recommend trying this recipe...  Add your own flair if you like something with a lot of flavor.   Thanks for the great recipe!

SOOOO Good!!  I used 2 eggs rather than one- salt and peppered each side (used garlic salt) when when I flipped them.  Turned out really crisp!  Topped with melted mozzarella and served with Italian Sausage, Mushrooms and Sauce.

My darling husband is lactose intolerant so I grimmaced when I read the need for sour cream in this recipe.  I made this substituting 1/4 cup mayonnaise for the sour cream.  DELICIOUS!!!! I also served a side of warmed marinara to pour over the eggplant if desired.  Very nice...will use this often.  Thank you, Kris.

Used this recipe for eggplant parmesan.  First batch I did just as recipe stated and found the coating too thick for my liking.  Second batch I eliminated the flour and just dipped in the egg mixture then bread crumbs, and turned oven up to 375. These browned up very nicely.  Last batch I had run out of sour cream so just did an egg wash and these didn't taste that different from the ones I used sour cream for. So, I guess what I'm saying is this isn't the greatest recipe but with the changes I made a very good oven frying technique.

My kids loved this. We all had seconds. We have used the same batter on chicken strips as well. The only change we made was the temp. We baked them at 450 for less time. Delicious.

This is a perfect mix for veggies! i used Italian seasoned bread crumbs which was perfect seasoning for this. thick sliced is best. also this is perfect for deep frying! excellent for zucchini and takes a little of the twang out of fried green tomatoes!!!

I was sooooo excited to make this recipe - made it exactly by the recipe.  It was one of the most tastless eggplant dishes I/we have ever tried to eat.  Whole family took one bite and that was it.  Sorry.

just popped them in the oven.  I'm excited to see how they turn out.  they are a little more involved than my previous recipe.  But I'm excited about the sour cream.  I may have done it wrong but, the addition of the flour first make them difficult to coat.  I like to follow recipes exactly the first time, so I did it as I thought it was intended.  Next time I may leave off the flour. Not sure what that was for.  Others please share your thoughts.  Thanks.

I tried this recipe with 1 eggplant, 4-6 tablespoons of sour cream, 1 teaspoon od garlic powder, and skipped the flourand they came out great, but after baking them as directed here I spooned a little bit of bottled pasta sauce and some grated asiago cheese on top of each slice and popped them back in the oven till the cheese melted. The baking is a great idea since it keeps the eggplant firm and meaty, not soggy and mushy. These made a great side dish but might also make a great appetizer for a party as well.

I couldn't make this fast enough!  I would turn around from cooking a batch and they'd be gone.  Delicious!  I modified it only a little by sprinkling grated parm cheese on top of the slices after flipping them AND added a hot, classic marinara with shredded parm cheese and parsley as a dipping sauce.  It was a huge hit and those who thought they wouldn't like eggplant were pleasantly surprised!!! :)  Big Thumbs Up.

Sorry - I gave it 1 star for "healthy" but I thought it was sooo bland - I guess I just like the fried version much, much better.  My husband said "you don't have to make this again".

My husband is diabetic and I am trying different veggies. Frying isn't really an option, so this was a nice alternative.  It tasted pretty good, just needed a little salt.  It was my first time with eggplant, and I will use this recipe when I make it again.

I tend to never follow directions, so here is my twist.  I used Panko bread crumbs instead of the Italian seasoned b.c., into the mix since there was no spice I added pinch of each dried minced onion, granulated garlic, sugar,curry powder and only 1 tbsp of flour. Instead of sour cream, which I happen to not have on hand I blend up Ricotta cheese with the egg.   I followed rest of the recipe and by far sounds and tastes more interesting than if I followed the recipe!

tried this recipe...very good but made some changes b/c some had said too dry I drizzled olive oil on both side during baking and then added a spoonful of spaghetti sauce then topped with provolone cheese then broiled them. It turned out crispy and delicious..good base recipe! My 4 yr daughter even liked it! I will make it again...1st time trying eggplant....awesome!

My daughter(almost 13yr old) said it's a 2, but that may be more of an eggplant rating in general versus this recipe.  I think that as far as what it claims to be it is good.  I like the egg/sour cream mixture for dipping & may try with other things like chicken.  I also may try again following some of the suggestions other people offered like the one about how to tame the eggplant flavor. Overall, I'd give it a 3.

I have mixed feelings about this recipe.  I really would like to rate it a 3.5.  The flavor was wonderful and I really didn't mind the work even though the coating was a bit gloppy.  (I misread the recipe and added the flour to the egg and sour cream!)  However, the eggplant simply did not brown in the oven and I had adjusted it as others had suggested to 375º. The slices remained a whitish tan, very unpleasant looking. Therefore, when they were 'done' I sauteed the slices briefly  in olive oil  to get them browned and crispy.  Then they were perfect.  Served the eggplant with sliced tomatoes from the farm- lovely and delicious summer supper.

This recipe is excellent!  Being from the deep South, we  love our vegetables deep fried, but this pleased even my most southern friends.  This recipe is easy and delicious!  There is no need to soak the eggplant.  I also added Tony Chachere's (after all I am from LA) as did the other reviewer.

My word! This recipe is a million times easier than actually frying the eggplant in oil. The texture (crispier and crunchier) is PERFECT! Even my husband (who initially called eggplant an 'abomination') loved it!  I did add some Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning and garlic powder to the flour, as well as a couple of tablespoons of olive oil to the sour cream/egg mixture, to give it the flavor of having been fried.  It was delicious served over Angel Hair pasta with a light alfredo sauce!  Great recipe... it's definitely a new family favorite!

I used this recipe to make eggplant parmesan. I have always LOVED my version, but the number of calories is horrendous since the eggplant soaks up probably a cup of butter and oil. I did as another reviewer did and drizzled some olive oil before I baked it using this version, but that probably wasnt even necessary. Tasted the same as my usual resipe, but not so oily... now I can enjoy it more often and not feel so bad about it. Also not so messy! awsome!!

This turned out pretty good, will make it again but definately needs some more seasoning.  I also ended up cooking it at 400 degrees because at 325 it never would have been done at the time specified.

This would be good to use in eggplant parmesan.  I sprinkled Adobo seasoning and parmesan cheese on mine before baking but it was still bland.  I forget the flour step and did not have trouble with the batter or breadcrumbs.

Great recipe! The eggplant turned out wonderfully crispy on the outside with a soft melted brie-like consistency inside.  The egg and sour-cream mixture is thick, so dip the eggplant medallion into the mix and then the breadcrumbs with a fork, NOT with your fingers or you'll get gooey blobs stuck to your fingertips and bare spots on your eggplant.  Cook for a bit longer, maybe 20 minutes on each side, and serve with a spicy garlicky marinara sauce for dipping.  Mmmmmmm ....

Love it!  I added my own Italian seasonings to plain bread crumbs, and decided to use plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  I will definitely make eggplant this way again in the future!

Delicious! I used organic, whole sour cream, which made a nice thick coating. I needed to increase the temp to 350 degrees. My husband even liked the eggplant, and he is NOT a big eggplant fan. I served the dish with a little bit of spaghetti sauce on top. I also added Parmesian cheese to the bread crumb mixture. Of course, taking Beano ahead of time would always be helpful with eggplant!

Didn't like this at all.  Was drawn to the fact that it would make the eggplant taste fried.  But really it just tasted dry.

It wasn't the least bit mushy, but it was hard to coat.  I used a nonfat sour cream & it was very thick.  I think it's much easier to coat in egg(s) only.

This is really delicious.  It is definitely messy to prepare, but it's easy and delicious.  I add grated parmesan cheese to my Italian breadcrumbs.  When I flip the eggplant halfway through I spray the tops with Pam again.  My only complaint is that I tend to run out of the batter before I run out of eggplant.  These don't really even need a dipping sauce, but I usually serve them with a little bit of red sauce.  When I make these for my husband that's usually our entire dinner since it's so good and so filling, and our guess is that these probably don't refrigerate and reheat too well.  I plan on making a layered eggplant parmesan with this recipe sometime.

Excellent recipie!  Tastes just like it does in the restaurants.  I added a thin piece of fresh mozzerella from the deli and 4 cheese spaghetti sauce.  It was awesome and tasted just like the fried kind.  Will definately make this again!

This recipe was a really good alternative to fried eggplant.  I did bake it at 350 instead though.  A good tip is to not put too many breadcrumbs on them.  It was very yummy and even my picky 2 year old ate them.

Easy, fairly quick.  i added a splash of milk to the egg and sour cream mixture to make it easier to dip.   Also used olive oil drizzle on top and bottom instead of cooking spray.  Topped some with feta cheese at the very end.  Very tasty!

I was going to make eggplant parmesan but discovered I did not have the sauce.  Luckily I came across this recipe.  I used hot and spicy breadcrumbs and after the cooking time I topped the slices with mozzarella cheese and put them back in the broiler until the cheese was melted and browning.  Finally I had the idea to top them with tomatoes but I was out so I used a can of heated diced tomatoes.  Hubby loved it.

This was absolutely THE BEST eggplant recipe I have tried.  It's delicious!  So nice and crispy on the outside and when you bit into it, it's just fabulously creamy and DELICIOUS!  I did use the Lite sour cream, but other than that, I changed nothing else!

Mmmm...perfect for my eggplant Parmesan and way much healthier than frying it! Thank you! My grandmother taught me how to make eggplant Parmesan.  I combined the flour and bread crumbs together and sprinkled pepper,  garlic powder and a blend of Italian seasonings the way she taught me.

Since I do like "mushy" eggplant, but wanted the crunchy outside, I simply baked longer, at 375.  Very nice.

Excellent. I prefer to bake, I don't like to fry. The key is to keep the slices thin so they cook crisp. 1/4" is too thick.  Also I used corn flakes instead of seasoned Italian crumbs since I am not serving this as a side Italian dish, but with a steak or fish. We also like to put a sliver of butter and maple syrup on top like a pancake stack. Yum.

I would make again, but not without some changes. I read the reviews ahead of time and did the following: 1) Really seasoned my bread crumbs (thyme, basil, garlic salt)since this will give flavor. I happened to use gluten-free bread that made me gag to eat but didn't want to throw out. It worked well here as it is already pretty dry; 2) Added olive oil--grease the pan in it and pour some atop each slice before baking. Keeps the crumbs moist and adds flavor; 3) Let each side cook for 20+ minutes and flipped a third time; 4) Added some cheese in the final 2 minutes or so. I used Muenster (all I had) though parmesan would surely be best; 5) Ate with a tomato sauce on top.

Made as directed but added a sprinkle of garlic powder to the bread crumbs.  I used 3/4 cup of sour cream, and actually could have used just 1/2 cup with one large egg beaten into it. Used parchment paper on the cookie sheet, brushed lightly with olive oil.  

Next time, I'll have a second parchment paper sheet prepared with the olive oil, so when I turn them over it will be onto a freshly greased sheet.  

I recommend increasing the oven temp to 375 deg. I like the outsides crisp, and the insides almost mushy. 

This is by far the best recipe I've ever used for oven 'fried' baked eggplant slices.

I liked the recipe but I didn't use sour cream. The breadcrumbs I used were "Contadina"Italian with Herbs & spices, I also mixed into the egg some latin ingredients that are home made plus Ranch Buffalo Dip & Butter and the flour. I then dipped the eggplant into all the mixture and coated it with the breadcrumbs. Baked in the oven for 25 minutes turning them once over. I then removed them and fried them golden brown.  My neighbors said they were the best Eggplant they had ever tasted.

Tasty, but took longer to cook than she had indicated, although that is easy enough to fix. I'm very glad to find a good eggplant recipe that isn't fried or  a casserole.  It is a little bland; my family liked it better with added salt.  And I did use light sour cream, which didn't seem to cause any problems. I will definitely make this again.

I never had eggplant before so I was kind of leery. This was pretty good and will make again. I saved some of the seeds and will plant them in my garden next year. Thank you so much for the recipe.

Not too bad.  I did what another reviewer said and rubbed the eggplant in lemon juice & salt for 30 min. and then washed and prepared as stated.  We did end up pan frying them in a little bacon grease because they were just too mushy still after baking.  Not too bad!

If you actually like eggplant, there is little reason to execute this recipe. In our family, eggplant is a favorite side dish. We concluded it wasn't bad, just not worth the prep time, and the disguise of this fragile veggie. Olive oil painted on the rounds, dusted with Cajun spice, and grilled ! Simple as that.

I made this recipe twice now, the first time I followed the recipe as written, liked it but a bit bland.  This time I added 1/2 tsp Habinero seasoning and 1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese and we really liked it.
Very good way to cook eggplant.  I do also use the fingerling eggplants which works very well.

Had some eggplant and wanted to find a way to make it that my girls would eat it. I added som Parmesan cheese into the seasoned bread crumbs and baked them at 350. They turned out great and the entire family cleaned the plate off.not bland at all.

Wow! Just made it and boy am I happy. The egg (I used whites) and sour cream (I used reduced fat) mixture was thick and not easy to deal with but was worth it. If you're calorie counting the nutrition info listed here is not accurate.  You don't come close to using all of the egg, sour cream or bread crumbs and the unused portion is impacting the stats.

I did like the crunch. I added parmesan to the bread crumbs and still thought they lacked flavor. Will use the leftovers, since they weren't worth eating, in a pseudo-eggplant parmesan. Soaked in marinara and melted cheese they'll be perfect.

Tried this recipe and it was a good basic start, but I altered it to taste. We like a little more flavor to our food, so I cut little triangle piece out of the "meat" of the eggplant and filled them in with jalepeno cheese, dipped and battered as described in the recipe, sprinkled with garlic salt, pepper, and pinch of cajun spice, and baked as recipe instructed. They were a huge hit with the guys piled on the couch for football :o)

skipped the flour. Used greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Seasoned italian breadcrumbs with a little garlic salt. Had to broil at the end for 2 minutes to brown and crisp it. Yum! I will never fry eggplant again! Thanks!

My husband and I LOVED it!  I used Italian breadcrumbs and added garlic, salt, pepper, and onion powder.  I also melted some mozzarella cheese on the top.  I served them for our "meatless Monday" dinner last night with a ramekin of marinara sauce and a salad.  My kids weren't too keen on them, but they're super picky eaters.

As others have stated here it is extremely messy to make; the flavor is very bland and the consistancy of the eggplant is like it is barely cooked.  And (as others have stated) I won't be making this one again.  Frying or grilling are much better recommendations for eggplant.

Pretty bland recipe.  I think it would have been much better fried.  Taste like undercooked eggplant and dry bread crumbs.

So im halfway through cooking this.... I found its easier to skip the flour step. Also for anyone with the bland issues I used not only seasoned breadcrumbs but also if you season the sour cream it should be just yummy!

This is a good simple recipe.  I did increase the temperture to 350 degrees and sweated the eggplant after peeling and cutting it up.  I also sprinkled the eggplant with lemon juice so the pieces would not brown.  I did add garlic salt to my dredging flour so the  pieces had extra flavor.

Love eggplant but not really this recipe. It just didn't work out for me. Rather mushy and bland. Followed the recipe, so maybe I need to try it again with some of the "tweaks" others have tried.

Interesting idea, but not very tasty.  Mine didn't turn out that crisp (maybe because i didn't have cooking spray).  Also, the middle of the eggplant stayed pretty hard and raw.

Good. Needed a little salt, but tasted good with chicken parmesana. I think nothing beats the tasted of "fried" though but I too liked the fact that the eggplant was firm (instead of soggy) in the center after baking.

I found that I had a lot of leftover breadcrumbs once I was done breading the eggplant, but it turned out great and very crunchy.  I used the baked eggplant in an eggplant parmesean recipe I found on this site, and my fiance couldn't eat it fast enough.

O.K. but kind of bland.  The coating could use something extra like pepper.  I would say the prep time is closer to 20, not 10, and is a little messy to make.  We used ranch dressing to dip it in, which was o.k., marinara sauce probably would have been better.  Definitely cook for the full amt. of time - I cut mine to about 1/3" and baked 15 mins. per side and it was still just a little "tough."

I couldn't believe this rated so well.  It was dry and tasteless.  It's only redeeming quality is that it might not have as many calories and/or fat as a fried version.

My family thought this recipe was just "okay."  As per advice from someone else who rated this recipe, I prepared a marinara sauce to go with it.  Without the sauce, 3 stars is all I can give it.  My 2-year old ate a lot of it though.
