I did not add the full amount of chicken broth, I mashed the pinto beans until they were the consistancy I was looking for. There was a little too much chili powder for us, when I make this again I'd only use a teaspoon. This was a good refried bean recipe, my oldest boy especially liked it.

Very good, we enjoyed these!  I think next time I'll add some minced jalapeno.

Good recipe! I added some salt and a little lime juice. Also threw in some whole black beans and topped each serving with shredded pepper jack.

Yes, it is fabulous.  Adding the chicken broth makes for a richer consistency.  I used hot water and it was fine.
