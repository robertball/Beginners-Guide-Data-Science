Two comments:

- The trick to making it less "soupy" is to drain the peaches...yes, even with fresh peaches.  After slicing I recommend putting the slices in a colander while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.  You may be surprised at how much juice comes off while they sit.  Don't slice them directly into the crust or you will get soupy pie!

- Serve soon after baking.  It's a beautiful pie fresh from the oven but as it sits it looks less attractive (the topping absorbs the liquid).  Still tastes good but if you're having company I would do everything up to the placing the topping ahead of time, then put the topping on and bake when you're ready to serve.

Yummy. I've made a lot of peach pies, and this one was one of the best. I did make a few changes though. I made extra topping, so I'd have an extra cruchy top. Plus, I made a pie filling instead of just putting the peaches in -- this way it would be soupy. The filling had juice from one small lemon, about 1/2cup to 3/4 cup of sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and about 1-2 tablespoons of cornstarch  mixed with a tiny amount of water to thicken it up. I didn't do a lot of measuring on the filling so those are estimations. I just didn't want a soupy pie, and I knew this would work.
It turned out super. I made an extra for my husband to take to work. This recipe is a keeper.

I've made this pie twice, once with yellow peaches, then white flesh peaches.  Next time I'll mix the two (If only using one kind of peach, I recommend white flesh)!  I used brown sugar instead of white, added 1/4tsp of cinnamon and a dash of allspice.  I coated the peaches in the mixture then placed in the pie crust.  As a topping, I mixed 1/4cup butter, 1/3cup+1TBS flour, 1/4cup brown sugar, and 1/4cup white sugar, then placed flattened chunks of dough on top.  It made the pie look nice on top, and gave it a slightly crunchy texture.  **Be sure to cut the peach slices thick, otherwise they get cooked down too much and it makes the filling soupy. Tastes great any way you eat it--hot, cold, or al a mode!

I took the advice of others and added cinnamon, but why stop there... I cut the white sugar down to 1/2 cup, added 1/3 cup of brown sugar, 1/3 cup rolled oats and one extra tbls of butter. I also tossed the peaches in flour before adding to the pie. It wasn't runny at all and it's hard to tell if it would've been had a not used the flour. I also set the stove to broil for a minute to crispen up the top crust. It came out really good. I don't expect this pie will last long in my house.

I'm no pie expert, but with all the input on this one, I couldn't miss.  I actually used frozen peaches that I thawed and drained. I tossed the peaches with flour as others suggested, and added a little brown sugar to the peaches too. They just weren't very sweet. Then I doubled the crumble recipe as other suggested and added both cinamon and nutmeg.  I had plenty of crumble left to completely cover the pie. I cooked it 450 for 10 mins then 350 for 40 mins and it was perfect. I used the middle rack in my oven and wrapped the edges of the crust with foil until about ten mins before it was done. Oh yeah, this recipe is a keeper especially since I found a way to use frozen peaches. thanks for the recipe.

I read the reviews and they helped a lot. I made some changes, cinnamon to flour/sugar mixture along with doubling the mixture. I also made a huge pile of clean, fresh peaches and coated all with about 1/2 cup of flour then coated again with half the flour/sugar mixture. Of course the baking took longer, but I watched it. My pie stood tall and beautiful. The crunchy, sugary, coating on top was delightful. All I can say is YUM! It's the best peach pie I've ever had.

Please don't waste your time with this recipe. It is not pie. It is peach goop in a shell. I followed the instructions and I also followed the advice of others to drain the fresh peaches a bit. It has turned out to be such an unattractive dish. Like others said, I'm sure that it tastes good with ice cream but you would not want to try and serve this "pie" to guests. Sorry. I've made so many great recipes from this site but this was the only really bad one so far.

This was a really good pie.  I will change a few things.  The biggest change will be adding more peaches.  Fill that pie pan up!  Oh, and why is there a picture of a two crust pie for a recipe called Single Crust Peach Pie?

yum yum.  my bottom crust was a little hard (but tasted like peach pie candy).  i used a bag of frozen peaches instead of fresh.  i rinsed and allowed them to thaw.  did not think it would come so great but what a suprise. it also deserves points for simplicity.

with the barrage of comments, it's hard to know what changes need to be made if any. after considering all of the wonderful recommendations, i added cinnamon, which was a good decision. And I 1 1/2 the crumb recipe which i think was perfect. when cutting the peaches, I only cut them in four large slices, which was recommended to keep the juiciness down. with the changes I made (more crumbs and less peach slices), we had no issues of a runny pie.   we love it! i would not be embarrassed to serve it to company.

EXCELLENT! I would just add a bit of cinnamon. I mixed in a big bowl, the peaches with all the crumb mixture, stirred a bit moving the bowl and poured it on top of the crust. It turned perfect and the lack of cinnamon was fixed sprinkling a bit at the time of serving. Delicious warm with vanilla ice cream. 5 Stars! Will make it again and again!

I added more flour the 2nd time I made this.  I started out with 1/2 cup flour instead of 1/3.  I also added a little tapioca (about 1 tsp.) to the fresh peaches.  Before I put the final crumb crust to the top, I added even more flour to mixture, probably another 1 tbsp.  This made it perfect.

Oh my gosh this was so good I almost made another one the same day.  I need add a little less sugar than the recipe called for. I also turned off the oven and left the pie in to cool. It was not soupy at all. My family loved it.

This was a great recipe!  I didn't have as many peaches as it called for and I didn't have nutmeg.  I only had pumpkin pie spice and surprisingly, it turned out delicious.  That goes to show how versatile this recipe is.  My husband ate almost the whole pie.

This pie was easy and a big hit.  I just got more fresh peaches and everyone is waiting for the pie!  I used a premade pie crust and prebaked it for 5 minutes.

I followed another reviewers suggestion of coating the peaches in flour before placing them in the pie as well as adding some brown sugar. The pie was not at all runny (even though I used VERY ripe peaches) and had a good flavor to it. Very easy to throw together as well.

This is my husband's and father-in-law's new-found favorite pie of all time, and it's so easy to make!  I use more cinnamon and nutmeg than the original recipe calls for, which helps make the topping a little sweeter.

I had some leftover crust dough in the freezer and wanted a quick and easy one crust peach pie to throw together.  I cut the recipe to fit the smaller pie and it was delish!  I am not a huge nutmeg fan, so I substituted cinammon instead.  I know, I know, not the same recipe.  I followed the rest of the recipe and as many reviewers suggested, to accomodate for and not throw away the delicious juice, I coated the peaches in flour and the pie came out perfect!  The crumb was light and crispy and the pie was not runny at all.  Thank you for this quick and easy recipe!

I made this for the first time for a cookout and was so nervous about it. It tasted great and the pie stayed together. I got rave reviews for it. 

I made a 10 inch deep dish pie, so I used 9 peaches and doubled the crumble mixture. It was great!

This pie was very good. I seldom bake but got the urge when my neighbor gave me some peaches from his tree. It was easy to prepare. Just make sure you drain the peaches in a large colander so that each peach gets drained.

This is truely the best Peach Pie recipe that I have ever made.  I have made many pies in my time and none can compare to this one.  I made it with very fresh peaches that i simply peeled, pitted and sliced.  It lets the true flavor of the peaches come through.  It is uncomplicated and homey. Yet, it is fancy enough to serve to company with a nice scoop of very good vanilla ice cream on top.  
I will make try this recipe with apples and cinnamon next time.

Fabulous!  I had a leftover Marie Callendar's frozen pie crust and this is a great "single crust" pie recipe.  Followed other reviewers suggestions to lightly flour the peach slices, and I did finish it off under the broiler for a few minutes at the end to give it a good look.  End of season peaches weren't overly ripe, so my pie wasn't runny at all.  My family devoured this pie.

This was good. I used 6 very large fresh peaches, so ripe and sweet they tasted like candy. I drained them and then added 1/4 cup flour, lots of cinnamon and about 1tsp. lemon juice. It was not soupy but of medium texture. To the topping I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg. Put only a little on bottom and most of it on top. I was dissappointed the way the topping seemed to disappear and made the pie look under cooked and soggy. Not very pretty for serving and really mushy looking the next day. The flavor was good because of the peaches I used but I don't think I'd make again. I was wondering if using brown sugar instead of white would work better in the topping? We did like it though. Thanks Lori!

It had a nice flavor but it was way too soupy like others have said.  If anyone knows how to make it less soupy let me know and I'll try again!

Loved this. We didn't think it was too runny at all, but I followed other suggestions and drained the peaches and also kept it in the oven after baking. I added a 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon per other's suggestions. Next time I will definitely double the crumble.

This was great. After reading other reviews, I doubled the topping and mixed 1/2 in with peaches and then topped with the rest.  Added Almond extract for kick of flavor.
Topping:
1/3 Cup Flour, 1/4 Cup Brown sugar, 1/4 Cup White sugar, 1 Tsp. Cinnamon + Nutmeg.  
I used the refrigerated dough and pressed into my 10" pie pan. I tried mixing yellow and white peaches but next time will only do yellow as the white weren't as sweet.  Consistency of peaches was perfect.

FABULOUS!  I made a gluten free version.  I simply substituted Splenda for sugar (although this is not required for the recipe to be GF), used a GF pie crust, and used GF flour.  FANTABULOUS.

This was delish! I used 1/3 reduced fat margerine, whole wheat flour and 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 sugar. I only used 1/2 cup of sugar blend and it was VERY sweet. Could probably use 1/4 cup sugar.
Looked pretty. Kind of like a cobbler-pie combo. Excellent, thanks!

In spite of my better judgement, I did not add cornstarch to thicken the peaches, which should be listed as part of this recipe.  It was a runny mess.  Also was too sweet for my taste. Would recommend less white sugar, maybe some brown, and cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  Better yet, use another recipe. I'm an experienced cook and have used other pie recipes before, but will not waste good fruit on this one again.

This peach pie was gone in 20mins…..It was soo good! 
Followed the recipe as is. It didn't turn golden brown after the 40 mins. So put it on the high rack. Turned on the broiler for a couple of mins. kept an eye on it so it wouldn't burn. It gave this nice hard topping. Pie came out wonderful!!

This recipe was delicious.  I used canned peaches.  I agree the crumble ingredients need to double. I used another pie crust on top. The host loved it.  This is my new found simple dessert.

I loved how easy this was, and I loved that you could really taste the peaches. But the crumb topping was bad. Just plain sweet with all that white sugar. I would use about twice the amount of some DIFFERENT crumb topping for this, and it would be a good pie. All that white sugar just ruined it for me.

Great, simple recipe for a delicious pie.  I made this recipe twice--once pie with fresh peaches and once with canned--neither was runny, I drained both kinds of peaches.  Like others have posted, I doubled the amount of topping, but otherwise made no changes.

It's generous of me to give it 3 stars.  I buy my Georgia peaches from a man who picks them fresh and sends them out right away.  I had made sure they were ripe but not too soggy and made the pie.  A big sloppy disaster, to say the least.  The flavors of mixed spices and peaches make a great flavor, but something needs to be done about consistancy.  I added 3 T of cornstarch, and that wasn't enough.  I also added more cinnamon and nutmeg than suggested, which turned out well.

This had wonderful flavor.  I added cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  My pie also turned out quite soupy, probably because the peaches were so juicy.  We just ate it in bowls with ice cream or whipped topping.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this pie GF and it came out great. I used a premade GF pie shell and took the advice of others and doubled the crumb mixture. I also used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I used tapioca starch for the flour and earth balance buttery sticks for the butter. I used 6 fresh peaches because that was all I had. I added half tsp. of Xanthan Gum to help hold the crumb mixture together. I also added a little cinnamon. I will definitely  make this recipe again!

This was my first attempt at a peach pie and it came out great! Bonus was I made it gluten-free (GF) for my daughter. Pie crust was GF and available pre-mixed in a box except for wet ingredients of course. I couldn't find nice fresh peaches so I bought frozen peach slices in a bag and would highly recommended it as an alternative and a time saver. Honestly after adding and baking the peaches you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between fresh and frozen. Like previous reviewers I had doubled the crumble ingredients and added cinnamon too! The flour was GF mixed grains plus I added a bit of xanthan gum (GF thickener). Worked wonders!  Nice and dense and not runny but moist. The rating should be a 4 since many bakers here add changes to original but hey, that's what makes a great recipe. The basic recipe is simple and for anyone to give it a bad rating really need to see what they did wrong and try it again. Peaches come in various sizes, textures and ripeness and can really alter your results for this recipe. A really true baker or even chef would try a recipe again before mindlessly bashing a recipe.

Even after draining the peaches the pie still came out really soupy which caused the pie shell to be very raw and gross! Also the crumb mixture was very sweet so I would cut back on the sugar especially if your peaches are very sweet and ripe! Overall I would not make this pie again..

This was super delicious, but mine came out a little too liquidy.  I would add a tablespoon or two of a thickener, such as quick cooking tapioca.

Absolutely wonderful. I used fresh peaches and followed the recipe exactly except I added a little cinnamon and made a lattice-type crust for the top. It was a tad runny, next time I will toss the peaches in some flour before assembling the pie. Other than than it was perfect. I brought it to a 4th of July picnic and everyone raved.

This was really, really good...the hub had brought home a ton of peaches (they're in season right now and SO yummy) and i had a pie crust in the freezer so went for it. I doubled the crumble, used 7 peaches, used cinnamon in place of nutmeg...the hub ate it straight out of the pan! YUM!!!

I made this excellent recipe for Thanksgiving. I took some ideas from a couple reviews and put a lattice top and a little more flour to make sure it didn't turn out runny. It will be a tradition now. The whole family loved it!

Great flavor, but mine turned out too liquidy. Maybe next time, I'll toss the peaches in some flour to help with that......

This pie was really good, but mine turned out really runny and soggy.  I think if we had eaten it right away it would have been fine, but I made it one evening to have the next day and it was so runny.  I used about 9 peaches and it could have even used a few more.  So, although it wasn't pretty, it sure tasted yummy!  I'll try some of the suggestions to thicken it up next time and see if that helps!

I gave this a 5star rating...I would have given it more... I did mess up one thing...I didn't put the crumb mixture on the bottom before the peach layer...I read one review that said that would keep my crust from getting soggy.  What I did was layer peaches, then crumbs, then peaches, then crumbs,etc...then I took a second crust and made lattice work on the top.  I do have to say that this was about the prettiest and yummiest peach pie I have ever seen.  (if I say so myself) I could go on and on.  Made it for my mom on mothers day, and she is so picky, but she had seconds.  thanks tons....

This pie is great! It does, however, need more peaches to fill the crust. That's the only reason I didn't give it a 5. My pie was not soggy at all. Watch the variety of peaches you use. Some are more conducive to baking than others. I used contenders. They bake up very well.

I followed the advice of mixing the fruit with the flour/sugar mixture (adding in cinnamon and allspice and using brown sugar instead of white), then adding a crumble top.  It came out really well, but I think maybe it needs more peaches so it is more of a fruit pie and less of a sugar pie.  :) 
I was bouncing off the walls...

Best peach pie ever!! The sugar, flour, butter crumb mixture under and over the peaches gives the crust a chance to brown before the peaches get juicy. Has a nice medium thickness filling.

Despite straining my peaches, the pie was still very 'soupy'. And as others have pointed out, upon sitting the topping absorbs juices to the point that it, too, is soggy. Good enough for 'just us', but I wouldn't serve it to guests.

This is a new peach favorite.  Couple of changes along the way (of course !)  I added large pearl tapioca to peach slices as they were very juicy and fresh and I didn't want a soupy pie.  I also broiled it for 5 minutes (high) after baking for 345 minutes,  just for a wonderful brown , sugary glow.  PS:  Used Reynolds aluminum on pre-heated baking pan to make for easy cleanup.  This is a GREAT recipe!!

I don't understand what one reviewer meant by this being a "peach soup"/too gloopy. the pie congealed perfectly. yes, it looked a bit liquidy at the end of baking, but this did not disappoint. i made it with vegan butter and almond flower. this was a great way to use a bunch of peaches from the farmers market.

This was an awesome recipe! 
My husband called it “wicked good”
This was my first time making a fruit pie and it  was very simple! 
I read the comments  and this is what I came up with.. 
I tossed the peaches in flour and doubled the crumb crust but used brown sugar for my 2nd 3/4 cup and used cinnamon instead and a  dash of nutmeg. 
It got rave results.. thank you!!

The taste was amazing but the peaches I used were very juicy. The pie fell apart when cut and was sitting in a lot of juice, which then created a soggy crust later.
I would recommend using more flour to accommodate the additional juice by adding at least 1/4 cup more, possibly 1/2 cup more.

Fabulous pie! I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and drained the peaches. I had to use frozen so this was especially helpful to give  a good texture to the pie. I also used cornstarch for a thickner not flour. I used a combination of Splenda and raw sugar. About 2 tablespoons of sugar and the rest Splenda. My hubby loved it!

I did not really care for this pie. It was just too sweet. I did add more of the topping, so that may be why. Everyone else liked it, so it may just not be my thing.

i love this and it turned out wonderful... my husband scarfed it up and my son is sleeping after working all day so he said he will be ready when he wakes up...  i did some things different and made the first batch of butter cream n flour as a creamy texture, putting this on the bottom as it said to do... then i put sugar in the peaches since they are not as sweet when bought frozen... and i used way more nutmeg... i finally did the second batch of butter and flour mixture with vanilla, just like the first one and made it as a crumble, just like the recipe said to do.. all glory to King Jesus for providing good foods and thank you to allrecipes for these amazing things to make.. since my pie is a little different, I named it "Crystal's Peachy Cream Pie".. my husband gave me the idea to name it this

This pie is fabulous! I made this for my husband for Fathers Day, peach pie is his favorite.  I didn't have nutmeg, so I used cinnamon instead.  I peeled and sliced the peaches and put them in a colander, then pour 1/2 cup of flour and tossed them around.  I doubled the toppings and also used half brown and half white sugar.  The best peach pie I've ever made!

I made this with thawed, frozen peaches, and I was SO nervous about how it would turn out! I drained the peaches for about 12 hours, then tossed them in flour/cinnamon, and layered them in the pie crust per the recipe. I followed previous reviewers' advice, and doubled the amount of "crumble" mixture. Also sprinkled some chopped pecans on top (they were doing nothing in the cupboard, so I thought why not.) Turned out fantastic! Served it on Thanksgiving Day as a pumpkin pie alternative, and the family loved it! Thanks!

I've made this twice now and love the pie. I did find it a bit sweet so cut back on the sugar a bit and I also added cinnamon, maybe 1/2 tsp. If you do like a double crust, just through a top crust on. The first time I made the pie I added all the flour mixture right into the pie, then had to make some up for the top. Turned out great though.

Made it with peaches I froze. We loved it. Freshly grated nutmeg made the whole house smell like heaven.

I love this peach pie! I made it as recipe is written just added small amount of cinnamon to peaches before placing remaining mixture on, because I love cinnamon. I will make again!

Instead of peaches, i figured the amount of fruit is about 6 cups i used 4.5 cups sliced strawberries and 1.5 cups diced mango. I used all brown sugar and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. The pie was full to the top and i had plenty of mixture to just about cover the top of the pie. I did use an extra tbsp of butter to make it more crumbly. I'll  try oats next time. Overall very good.

I did not care for this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. I even drained the peaches for awhile. It was just mush.

One of the best peach pies I have had/made.  I did doubled the topping mix, added a 1/2 tsp cinnamon and tossed the peaches in about 1/2 cup flour (no need to drain them then saving all the yummy juice.)  I put 1/4 of the topping in first, added the peaches and then put the rest of the topping on. Cooked just as instructed and it turned out perfect!

We loved this pie! Peaches aren't in season in Colorado just yet so I used frozen peaches that I thawed but left slightly slushy. I coated the peaches with about 1/3 c flour and 1/4 c of sugar along with some Cinnamon and nutmeg since I knew they would have extra moisture being they were previously frozen and I also knew they wouldn't be near as sweet as fresh peaches. Other than that I left the recipe as is and doubled it to make 2 pies. We loved loved loved it. The topping got nice and crunchy and has a lovely flavor. A peach pie was the request and this one made me look like a rock star!

Love this recipe. Only a four because I made a few changes. I followed several of the tips in the reviews.  I used frozen peaches, but I drained them.  Then I added about 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon to the peaches to make them thicker. I also substituted Splenda Blend for the sugar.  It was fantastic.  Nice and thick and easy to cut.  My husband asked me to make this more often.

LOVED this pie!  I used the crust from the All American Apple Pie recipe (allrecipes) and used 4 and some peaches instead of six, and it was awesome!  It was gone in 5 minutes and I had to fight to get even one slice of it.  Will definitely make this pie again.

I loved this pie.  Peach pie just tastes like "summer" to me, and that's how this pie tasted.  I love the single crust idea--not so many calories but still VERY NICE.

We are expats living in Shanghai, China.  I tried this recipe with our local peaches and it was delicious!  A little reminder of home.

A simple, tasty peach pie.  I needed 7-8 peaches instead of the 6 called for in the recipe.  I guess East Coast peaches are smaller!

Yummy!  It was almost like a peach-crisp type pie!  I did add apple pie spices b/c I ran out of nutmeg and it tasted just as delicious!

Mine turned out a bit tart, but that may have been caused by the peaches. Otherwise good and very easy. I only had four peaches, but it was still a pretty full pie.
