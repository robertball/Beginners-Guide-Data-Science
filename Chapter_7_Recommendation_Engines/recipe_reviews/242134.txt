Since it is winter in Michigan and dark thirty when I get home from work I decided to do this in the oven. The directions say to grill in foil so I didn't see a reason why oven would be much different. Turned out well and was also perfect for a light lunch the next day. I think this would have been great with fresh basil instead of spinach for a little extra flavor.

I, too, baked it instead of grilled. Omitted the cheese, used fresh chopped garlic and added basil. Served on top of mashed potatoes & roasted asparagus. Will definitely make this again.

Great, tasty, and oh so simple recipe! Excellent choice for a weeknight, as suggested! I followed the recipe, except doubled the fresh spinach and used fresh minced garlic.  Next time, I want to try Swiss  or some other mild, soft cheese that has a bit more flavor than mozzarella (which didn't add much to the dish, in my opinion).  I'm thinking Swiss or Jarlsberg because they would add a buttery, nutty flavor that would likely pair well with the other ingredients. Will definitely make again!  Thanks!

Really liked this, so healthy and light.  I know people hate when you change recipes, but I had a similar recipe that I lost and used this to recreate it.  I really used this recipe, but my former one had zucchini in it so I added that.  Here's what I did..foil packets, sliced zucchini in rows, fish on top of that, then what the recipe called for with the tomatoes, spinach, onions.  Same spices and olive oil and balsamic.  My cod was quite thick so I baked (didn't have access to grill) it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  Some people mentioned it gets too "saucy" and they may not like the added zucchini for that reason but we liked it.  Only when I served it, I put a little feta on it.  That's my version and it was delicious, light and healthy, so I thank the original poster of this recipe.

Flavors are fantastic!! Made as described with the topping with the exception of swapping in feta cheese for mozzarella.. 
One note - also does wonderfully with chicken in the oven, just with the longer baking time for chicken vs. fish I browned chicken breasts in a skillet first and finished in the oven in a 13 x 9 pan covered in foil.

Tried it and not a family favorite - they thought the fish tasted more boiled and baked.  Leftover the next day was better but would change things up.  Add a layer of onions and garlic on the bottom first then place the Cod, top with spinach, tomatoes and cheese.  Bake open not like a packet

Very tasty, easy and quick to make.  Looks great on the plate.  Also it provides a nice base to experiment a bit with some additional flavors - maybe basil, ginger, oregano.

awesome! Loved the mix of flavors. I am willing to bet this would go well with chicken also. I did not want to grill so baked it in the oven at 400 degrees but overcooked it at 20 minutes. My bad not the recipe. Going to make it again soon. (less time)
Still used the foil package. Easy clean up.
Thanks for the recipe!!

I made this with Yellow Squash instead of Spinach, and no cheese.  I made a Spinach Salad on the side (with Feta and Blueberries and Pecans), and some Quinoa as another side.  Great Dinner!

My whole family loved this. It was pouring rain so I baked it in the oven instead. Covered with foil and baked at 400 for 20 minutes. For the last few minutes I had the cover off.  Will make again!

Excellent!   Made it exactly as written, except in the oven at 425º for 10 - 12 minutes.

This was phenomenal!  Like the other reviewers, I baked it i the oven at 375, since I wasn't sure what degrees. It came out fine. Instead of mozzarella cheese cubes, I've used shredded and added some feta cheese.  It tasted real good--so easy and healthy. I'll  make it again.

Didn't care for this recipe at all - even after the double seasoning the fish was bland. Though I did bake it vs. putting it on the grill...I do like the ingredients so next time I'm going to lightly bread it and dress the spinach and tomatoes separately and put them on afterwards.

My wife, who generally isn't a fish eater loved this.  I substituted feta cheese for the mozzarella and it turned out very tasty! I made this on the grill but I can see where it could be made just as easily in the oven during the winter months. She can't wait to have it again.

I also baked it. 375 for 20 mins. I used 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder and sprinkled a little bit of basil on top. I did not want the cheese so I left it out. My husband and I loved it. So healthy and very tasty.

I used lemon juice instead of balsamic vinegar because I didn't want the vinegar. Since I do not have a grill I baked it in the oven on 425 for 20 minutes. It was great. I should have drained the tomatoes, though, and used less oil with it being in the oven.

I made it as a trial dish for my family and decided that it was just what I needed to serve my 25 dinner guests shortly thereafter.  I followed other folks' advice and cooked it in the oven.  I am not a lover of cheese so I omitted it.  One thing I did do, though, was steam the onions in a bit of water before adding them to the dish.  I found that they had not cooked sufficiently when just baked with the fish.  There were some leftovers and they were delicious even a few days later.

Followed the recipe without the cheese, but cooked 8 x 4 oz pieces. They were thick pieces, so on grill for 20 minutes. Done to perfection but a bit plain. I think , next time, I would add some summer savoury or cajun spice.

Super easy and very delicious.  Only change I made, and recommend, is substitute Feta for the Mozzarella.  Just remember to go a little easier on the salt.  I will definitely make this dish again.

Great quick meal! I shopped at Costco and they didn't have cod today so i made it with halibut.  I used fresh minced garlic and red onions,  left out the cheese. Decided to do it in the oven,  400° for 25 minutes for the size of my fish.   Everyone liked it.

My family who don't always like fish really enjoyed this combination.  I used cherry tomatoes and added dried basil.  I also omitted the balsamic vinegar and used lime juice instead.    Turned out great!

Awesome. I did sauté the veggies for a couple minut before adding to fish. Left out the cheese and it still was great.

I added zucchini also which added some nice additional texture. When making again I will try adding additional spices.

I made this recipe as is, but added two small garlic gloves and baked it in the oven. I broiled it for about 4 minutes to melt the cheese. I think it is very good. I served it over spaghetti and it was perfect. The bit of sauce was good to eat with crusty bread. I will try this recipe next time with lemon juice and see how it comes out. If I try it with balsamic vinegar again, I will replace the spinach with basil just to try it! Will make this recipe again.

The only change made to the recipe was that I baked it in the oven @400 F for about 15-20 minutes. Otherwise, made recipe as written and we were pleasantly surprised. So simple to make, light/healthy, and oh so flavorful! We're used to making cod battered and fried or w/butter and seasonings. The tomatoes and balsamic provide a slight sweetness to every bite. Very well balanced flavors and no changes needed to this recipe. Thanks for sharing the recipe, tcasa!

I enjoyed this dish. It is very easy to do, especially for clean up since it is cooked in foil. I put it on the grill and cooked it for the time specified. I used chives instead of onions and just a hint of cheese because I am managing my diet. It comes out tender and is a great way to add some interest to cod.
