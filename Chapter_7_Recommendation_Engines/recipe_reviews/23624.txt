This soup is wonderful. I've made it several times.  If you really want it go over the top with this taste and nutrition-wise, replace the frozen stir-fry veggies with finally chopped bok choy (leaves and stems).  Also, a quarter of a teaspoon of toasted sesame seed oil on the top only adds one gram of fat and a much more complex flavor.

Made this today- the ginger and garlic are amazing! I used fresh mushrooms, green onions, canned bamboo shoots, canned bean sprouts, a sliced onion, fresh spinach, cilantro and salad shrimp. Left out the fructose. It tastes so amazing. Thanks for a fabulous base!

Very nice flavor to the broth.  Kind of like hot and sour soup.  However, the spinach gets slimy and if you overcook it a bit (like I did) the shrimp gets chewy.  I am thinking this soup would be great with chicken or tofu and nix the spinach.

Wow!! Great soup.  Hard to believe it's so low in calories.  I did add some sesame oil--it seemed to give it just that extra taste it needed. I left out the spinach but only because I didn't have any.  Definitely will make often.

I am not crazy over this one, but I will use it and modify it next time I make it only because it is such a great weight loss food.  I do not like the way the soy sauce turns it such a dark brown color, and I didn't even use the full amount, also I don't think I would add the corn starch again, why would you want to thicken soup so much??  Next time I think I will go with alot less soy sauce and more chicken broth.  I will definitly leave out the bamboo shoots too only because I discovered I don't like them.  I also cut way back on the ginger and garlic, I can't imagine how strong it would have been if the full amount had of been used.

Thank you for sharing this recipe. I love it! I did make a few minor changes, such as 1/8 cup ginger, garlic and cilantro. Other than that I followed your recipe to the "T". Next time I might use cubed tofu instead of shrimp. Then again, I might use both. Tastes a lot like hot and sour soup which I love. Thanks again!

Tasty, healthy and filling... just what soup should be!  I made a few changes... I sauteed about 1/2 cup of chopped onion with the ginger and garlic, used fresh mushrooms, added about 10 oz of tofu and subsituted sesame oil for olive oil.  I also only used only 1 bag of the frozen veggies and added a couple handfuls of fresh snowpeas.  And I omitted the frozen spinach and added 3 heads of fresh baby bok choy (chopped leaves and stems). I didn't have fructose, so just used regular sugar.  It came out great... a little spicy and very savory.  I am sure I'll make it again!

This is a favorite with a couple of my family members.  I've found the cilantro a huge key and almost always substitute kale for the spinach.  The spinach will 'melt' into the soup.  The kale holds shape better.

FLAVOR!!  This tastes like hot and sour soup but with lots of veggies.  So many different flavors with the ginger and vinegar, soy sauce.  YUM!!  Using the fresh ginger really makes a difference.  Try straw mushrooms in a can for a more chinese flair.  This is an excellent recipe for dieters and anyone else!!

I make this in the croc pot and it is a hit...shrimp is a sometimes at out house. Collard greens work well with this..I use canned collards,drain and press between paper towels.spinach works well when pressed between paper towels to. Have been making this for a long time in the croc pot.Low for about 3-4 hrs.then add collards/spinach for 1hr. longer. I am a believer in the croc pot!

I didn't follow this recipe exactly, but because what I made came out FANTASTIC I thought I would share :)  I made half a batch and cut the cornstarch down by half (again), which I thought give it a great texture.  The market didn't have a can of bamboo shoots, so I used a can of chop suey vegetables (which contains bamboo as well as sprouts and some other things) - I highly recommend that.  There are several frozen stir-fry veggie mixes available, but I chose the Bird's Eye snap pea mix and it gave the soup a tiny bit of sweetness.  Instead of fructose, I used two packets of Truvia.  It doesn't sound like it would make a difference, but it was exactly right (I taste-tested before adding, after adding 1 packet, and after adding the second).  I also followed some other reviewers' advice and left out the spinach - I didn't think it was missing anything.  I used tofu instead of shrimp just because I was hoping to have leftovers around for the week; i used half of the package, and probably should have used less, but it went well.  Finally, I forgot to halve the crushed red pepper so it was quite zingy.  But I loved this soup the way I made it.  I shouldn't have cut it in half though - my husband loved it too and it's all gone now!

I thought that this soup was delicious. I used brown sugar instead of fructose. I also added several dry chili peppers. Instead of canned mushrooms, I used fresh chopped shitaki mushrooms and instead of frozen spinach, I used fresh baby spinach. I waited until the last 5 minutes to add the shrimp, spinach, and cilantro. It came out great. I would definitely make it again. A+++

This was good. It didn't remind me of hot and sour soup too much but it was still a good simple "asian" veggie soup with some protein thrown in. I added diced chicken and a handful of shrimp and left out the spinach (personal preference). Will probably make again and again just so I can get my veggies in and hopefully lose some weight! :)

What amazing flavor!   Such a lot of bang for the calorie buck!!  I made as-written (which is my committment to this site) for the first time tonight.  We are on a "soup & salad" gig 'till the Holiday gorging begins.....and this is a "keeper" on our menu!  We loved the perfectly balanced flavors, the great fresh nutrition, and the hearty satisfaction of a great meal, all on our limited calorie committment.  All I added was a fresh salad.  Thank you fo this great recipe!

Pretty tasty soup, and much better than the other "diet" soups.  I didn't have bamboo shoots, so I replaced them with sliced water chestnusts and they give a nice crisp crunch to the soup.  I also replaced the garlic, ginger, and red pepper with 2 tbsp. of garlic/ginger/pepper paste that I had in my fridge.  I took another reviewers advise and used kale instead of spinach.  Next time, I will add the kale at the same time as the frozen veggies, as it takes a little while to get tender.  All said, it is a nice and easy soup recipe.

I absolutely loved this soup!!!  I did lessen the amount of crushed red pepper to 1/2 tsp. but found this to be too hot for my husband.  Next time I will only use 1/4 tsp. to make it mild in range. I love the idea that this is also so low in calories. Thanks, LILHEN!!!!

I made this soup and it was amazing. Everyone in my family loved it.  I added fresh bean sprouts, and omitted the bamboo shoots, as my stir-fry veggies already had some in it. As well I added baby bok choy, used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, omitted the frozen spinach, but added a couple of handfuls of fresh spinach at the end.  You can add the red pepper to suit your taste. I also omitted the fructose.

As written there is just too much soy for us and we find it does not need the sweetner nor the cornstarch.  Why on earth would you want to thicken this good soup....oh well..

This is excellent, my wife likes sweet & sour soup when we go out for asian food and this tastes just like sweet & sour except for all the additional vegetables, I made it twice in one week. Will definitely make it over and over again. I haven't noticed any weight loss yet.

This was pretty good.  I did not add fructose because jelly soup just didn't sound appetizing.  My son did not like the spinach in it.  A little too much red pepper.

This was ok. I'm always looking for low-point soups because I love soup and it's a great snack. I almost followed the recipe exactly except used sugar instead of the fructose because I couldn't find it at the store, used fresh stir-fry vegetables instead of frozen, skipped the frozen spinach (because I know how mushy spinach can be in soup and I think it's gross), skipped the shrimp for points.
It was one of those soups where the first half a bowl is awesome and the second half is too overwhelming. It was a bit too much on the sour side unless you were eating small portions. And this makes a lot of soup.

pretty good base but a little salty.  i used low fat ground turkey instead of shrimp which worked fine.  i also used sugar instead of fructose and added fresh spinach as served.  i will make again with these changes and probably use only fresh vegetables next time.

I don't know about the "miracle" part, but this soup is fantastic.  I don't always use the same veggies (whatever frozen mixes are on sale), and it still tastes great every time. The only real change I make is the shrimp. I am making it for one and reheating toughens the shrimp too much. I use extra firm tofu for the protein! The tofu absorbs all the broth flavor and reheats great. Thanks for the recipe!!!

My daughter made this soup for me and it is absolutely the best recipe ever. She said she followed it to a tee.  She said she would add more shrimp. I was wondering if diced tofu would be an interesting addition instead of shrimp?  I think that the cornstarch added a nice subtle body to the soup rather than a straight broth.

My husband and I have been watching our caloric intake for a while, and this soup is PERFECT for us!  We love the flavor, love the soup, and it's great leftover too.  I'd like to add some red cabbage sometime, since this reminds me a lot of Hot and Sour soup...

I was really looking forward to making this soup.. I must say I was pretty disappointed with how it turned out. Maybe if the ginger was grated, then you would avoid the problem I had... I kept biting into ginger chunks and getting a very strong bitter flavor. The vegetables were soggy and gross and the broth tastes weird, and I eat pretty much anything and am very open minded. This recipe was a bummer.

This base is fantastic. I will be making this a lot, and varying it, adding noodles as well!  It's terrific as is, I added sesame oil, subbed about 1TBSP sugar for fructose and used mostly fresh veggies.

I read a lot of the reviews on this and decided to go with the majorities.  Instead of spinach, I used Kale.  I was a little nervous using kale because it seems to have an overpowering bitterness.  But in this recipe it was great.  I also used fresh veggies instead of frozen.  I used low sodium everything because I have high blood pressure and have to watch my sodium intake (not to mention that if you're trying to lose weight, salt can cause you to retain water and gain weight).  I also went with the suggestion to reduce the amount of corn starch.  I have to say, if you like the thick consistency of regular hot and sour soup, don't reduce it.  I love hot and sour soup and the thickness is one of the great things about it.  If you like watery soups, reducing the amount of cornstarch is probably a good idea.
Great soup, big batch, easy, and fast!

This is outstanding! I'm not a fan of bamboo shoots so used bean sprouts instead, and added the sesame seed oil as other reviewers mentioned.  Otherwise, I followed recipe to a T. Even if I don't lose weight from this soup, it will be on my menu often.  Thanks so much for sharing this awesome recipe!!

I was reluctant to make this soup but was looking for a new, low-cal recipe.  It's really very good!  I may try it with chicken next time, or a combination of shrimp and chicken.   Now let's hope for a miracle weight loss!  :-)

This is so good! I halved the recipe because it serves 20...we're only 2. I regretted it. It was almost gone (some for lunch)! I will make full recipe next time.  I made it with cut up chicken but will make with shrimp. Husband raved...and he's not a soup fan. I added 2 TBS sesame oil to olive oil when I fried the ginger and garlic. Highly Recomend!!

Nice recipe! It really does taste just like a hot and sour soup. I went a little lighter on the ginger and added a teaspoon of sesame oil, like the other reviewers suggested, and used all fresh vegetables and spinach, as opposed to frozen. I also served it over flat rice noodles to make it a bit more filling. If you are a cilantro fan (as I am) don't skip it, it really adds a bright and fresh flavor. We really enjoyed this and I will be making it again!

I actually want to rate it 3 1/2 stars ... it was good but I found the it a bit "too sour" for my tastes.  I'm wondering if I might have added too much vinegar by mistake because "too sour" is not in other reviews.  I will probably try it again for this reason because I loved the fresh ginger & garlic.  Also surprisingly very filling!

It is versatile and easy  You can use whatever types of vegetables you have.  I used tofu too.  And very healthy so I wish I enjoyed it more. It just had a strange sort of sweet/sour flavor which I just wasn't crazy about.

Fantastic base. I hate when some say it is perfect then go on to say the changes they made.  I am noting my changes but only to note the base is perfect as is.  I loved that you can either minimize the red pepper if you don't like it to spicy. My changes were more because of using fresh veggies instead of frozen because it is what i had.  
My modifications: I doubled because I all ready prepped double amount of ginger.  With the base you can customize the add ins.  I did not use the sugar or starch to make it healthier and did not miss it. I only used 1/2 the amt of red pepper and it was the perfect kick. You can always add more later to taste.  I sliced celery and julliane carrots and cabbage for the veggies because I had them to use up and did not find a good selection of frozen stir fry veggies around.  I cut up fresh kale and spinach mix instead of frozen and doubled the amt needed, it is healthier and you don't notice it at all. Also used fresh mushrooms and doubled it because I had to use up what I had and I love mushrooms.  
I had so much I thought I might need to give it away but my husband loves it and does not want to give it up.  Also the hot and sour soup is my husbands cure all for a head cold from the restaurant, now this will take its place. It has the same taste, with added veggies and much healthier.  With out the thickening it is more of a broth, but really good.

I have made this soup a bunch of times. So easy, so delicious and so healthy! I cook the broth and add mushrooms and carrot slaw. It makes a big batch so I just take out two servings and add shrimp, spinach and rice noodles (if I'm in the mood). Cook for 5 minutes and you have supper, with no slimy spinach or over cooked shrimp! An excellent and versatile recipe.

I made this last night and was pleasantly surprised. The broth is wonderfully spicy and tangy! I made very few changes. I substituted kale for the spinach (HIGHLY recommended), cooked and 8oz package of fresh mushrooms with the garlic and ginger instead of using  canned, and used 2tbs real sugar instead of fructose. All of my ingredients were low sodium, so I did add a dash of salt as well. It makes a massive amount of soup. I'll be making and freezing this regularly.

Love it! I used beef broth (only because I was out of chicken broth) and didn't have any bamboo shoots on hand so I omitted them. I also used canned straw mushrooms, 1 whole serrano pepper in place of the crushed red pepper, and 1 teaspoon of agave nectar in place of the fructose. Also, I didn't have any shrimp so I substituted 1 package of tofu shiritake noodles. This was so tasty on a cold, windy fall night - spicy and satisfying. I'll be making this lots, thanks for a great recipe!

Very good. Added a drizzle of sesame oil when serving.  Make sure you use all of the corn starch recommended  since the soup thins out when frozen veggies added later.

I loved the idea and I read through the reviews and this is what I came up with:
I used fresh mushrooms and I did add Sesame Seed oil once I added all veggies (I used 1/4 tsp for the half of the recipe).
I did not use any cornstarch - I prefer my soups more watery. 
I sauteed garlic and ginger for a couple of minutes, added  broth (organic, low sodium), added all other ingredients, including soy, vinegar, pepper and all the veggies (I added them all together). I also added baby baby bok choy, cut in pieces, steams and leaves together. After some time I added tofu (or shrimps - I tried both) and when it was almost done added the spinach for about 3 min...
All in all - great lunch I take to work with me and pretty easy to make! Was very filling and tasty!

I loved this soup. It gave me sooooo much energy.  I used veggie broth instead and did not used shrimp.  I'm about to try it without the cornstarch.

I didn't eat this myself (not a fan of seafood) but I sent the recipe to my husband for a night I was working late. He followed the recipe exactly and LOVED this soup. He'll definitely be making it again!!

I made this tonight and it was absolutely delicious. I adjusted the recipe a bit according to my tastes. I'm not a big fan of ginger root, so I omitted that ingredient. I used fresh bok choy instead of spinach, added in extra water chestnuts, extra baby corn, extra mushrooms, extra bamboo shoots, and an extra 32 oz package of chicken broth. I also added in a half package of dry lentils which I pre-cooked before putting them in the soup. The lentils gave it an extra boost of iron and made the soup more filling. Absolutely amazing!!

Followed the recipe except added some more chili as I like it spicy. Well, I can't get enough! On bowl number two now. J'adore. Miam!

Yum. I changed up the ingredients and made the soup more Asian. Baby bok choy instead of veggies, mushrooms, water chestnuts. Left out the ginger and cilantro (not fond of either), reduced the rice wine vinegar and added a splash of sesame oil at the end as recommended by another reviewer. This has become a weekly soup for me. Thanks for the recipe!

This soup came out wonderful. I used 2 different stir-fry veggies for variety and cut garlic and ginger in half as others suggested.  It is spicy with the crushed red pepper but not to spicy. Will make again.

Holy cow - I LOVE this soup!! I omitted cornstarch, fructose, and bamboo shoots (couldn't find) - used only about 8 dashes of soy sauce, almost an entire bulb (?) of freshly chopped ginger, straw mushrooms (more protein)1 bag stir-fry veg's plus some broccoli florets and fresh spinach (hoping I don't regret the spinach tomorrow after it's sat in the soup - it does say "serve immediately") - used 2 (4oz) pkgs frozen salad shrimp - invited a friend over to try it, I was so impressed, and staked my claim as "soup maker" for our upcoming Asian themed supper club, it's that quick and tasty!!

I'm trying to lose weight for spring break and this has definitely helped. I cut down on the ginger the second time I made it, but I will definitely use the full 1/4 cup the next time I make it. I added water chestnuts for extra crunch and subbed in sliced baby corn and broccoli for the mixed vegetables. Even my roommates liked this soup!

So good I was eating it out of the pot before it was even done! I  made a few changes because of personal taste (extra spicy) and because I didn't have certain ingredients (no bamboo, used sugar instead of fructose) and I used light soy sauce but it was just amazing. I have frozen the leftovers and it's just as amazing reheated.

This is such a delicious soup, just like our favorite hot-sour soup at the Chinese restaurant.  I was hesitant but soo glad I made this!  I don't know if I could eat a whole pot in a day every couple of days as it is kind of rich but definately added to our meal for "Chinese night" at home.  My changes were: cut WAY back on cornstarch, probably like at least half of it, left out fructose (didn't have), no shrimp, cilantro or spinach (don't like.  I used frozen oriental stir fry veggies, these were wonderful in here.  I might try to dump all in the crock pot next time, not sure how that will work.  Thanks for such a great recipe that we can make at home to save money on eating out!

wonderful soup!  delicious and suprisingly filling.  next time i will try adding different types of mushrooms (perhaps shiitake or button) and some fresh bamboo shoots. oh yes and it's very easy to make (i'm only 19 and i had a great dinner in such a short time).

I really enjoyed this soup.  I added spaghettini for a more hardy texture. It freezes well and is delicious reheated in the microwave for lunch at work.

This soup is fantastic! Thanks for the amazing recipe! Only modifications we made were that we used fresh mushrooms and spinach. We left out the fructose and added a can of unsweetened coconut milk! Seriously planning to make this all the time we loved it so much! We are going to try it with chicken next time but we definitely loved it with the shrimp!

Made as per recipe.  It’s quite simple and tasty.  Second time around I would use less spinach and less red pepper (spiciness level is good for me but not so much for wife).  Anyway it’s good and low cal and easy so will be trying it again.

This soup was wonderful! I did make a few changes based on other reviews: fresh mushrooms, green onion, fresh bean sprouts, fresh spinach, celery, and I upped the crushed red pepper to 2 teaspoons to give it a little extra heat. Hubby and niece really enjoyed it too!!

Good combo of flavors.  I do feel a little sesame oil will give it more richness.  I plan to add a small amount.  Very fulfilling!

Really, really good!  I tried to stay as close to the recipe as possible, with just a few necessary changes.  Like my frozen shrimp was sold in 10oz packages, so I used 2, and my stir fry veggies was sold in 12oz packages, so I used 3.  And my (fresh) spinach was going bad, so I only added a little.  And I left out the sugar entirely (no idea why it would have needed it?) and the canned mushrooms because can mushrooms are blech and there were mushrooms in the frozen mix anyway.

This is like the best soup I have made in a long time, it's so satisfying!!  Love the heat and flavor from the ginger/garlic. I had to add a whole extra box of broth as it was a bit too thick for me . For extra kick added a small thin-sliced jalapeno at the beginning. Yes, definitely add the spinach as the very last step or the texture will be off. I am thinking kale might be a good sub too for spinach, it holds up better being simmered.

Yum!! I tweaked the recipe to my tastes/what I had on hand. I did not use corn starch or fruit sugar, and I don't think the soup needs them. I used bok choy instead of spinach,  and added more broccoli and mushrooms. I also added just a splash of sesame oil and threw in some leftover chicken. I think next time I'll grate the ginger instead of chop it . This will definitely become a staple in our house.

I meant to take a picture, but forgot!  I used 1/2 lb of shrimp and 1/2 lb of tofu stir-fried in fish sauce and ginger powder .  I also forgot to buy cilantro, but it wasn't necessary.
On the advice of another reviewer, I replaced one bag of the veggies with a whole baby bok choy, chopped up coarsely.  Also, do garnish with toasted sesame seed oil.

Truly amazing soup recipe. I've made this about 10 times now and it never gets old. I always follow the directions as they are listed and it works out perfectly every time. The flavors are out of this world. This recipe is definitely restaurant quality. Thanks so much for sharing with us.

This was good, I left out the cornstarch and the fructose, and I substituted a sprinkle of ghost chile powder for the red pepper flakes.

Delicious. I would use slightly less ginger next time. I grated it, so maybe that made the flavor stronger. Used a can of mini corn and fresh mushrooms plus the stir fry veggies and the shrimp. I put fresh spinach in each bowl before pouring the hot soup on top. My husband absolutely loved it.

This soup is delicious.  I used fresh veggies instead of frozen/canned and used kale instead of spinach and added sesame oil (1tbsp).  So good!!!

This is a wonderful food.  I will use this recipe forever...I did use fresh spinach as I had it on hand and put it in with the first broth so it would have plenty of liquid.  GREAT SOUP.

Just made this soup and even though I'm kinda picky, I agree that it is good!  I will make it next time with fresh veggies just because I prefer them to frozen, but I am positive that when I do I would rate this 6 stars!

Hoorayyyy, this soup is a one two punch of flavors. Some liked it, some loved it and some thought it was to powerful. 
At any rate, a good combination of tastes.

Excellent recipe. Made it yesterday and the family loves it. If it helps with weight loss - I will be very grateful. Regardless, this recipe has become part of my "recipe box" of items that I will prepare often.

the soup was delicious.  I loved it, my husband loved  it and my 2 year old and 4 year old loved it (and that doesn't happen very often!!). the only thing I did different was that I used 1 less package of frozen stir fry veggies. will definitely make it again and again

this was fantastic and it was really easy to make! It was very filling and fresh tasting. I used fresh stir fry veggies (baby corn, snow peas) and they turned out perfect. This is a very forgiving recipe, as I didn't measure anything, and just eye-balled the measurements. Thanks, this is a keeper!

This was wonderful. Followed the recipe very closely except for a few minor things. Sliced up baby portobello mushrooms because it's what I had, cut the cornstarch wayyy back only used about 1 tblspn, used a small packet of splenda instead of fructose, and added fresh bok choy and spinach chopped. I loved this. Definitely worth using fresh veggies.

Very good. I made several changes to it though. Left out the shrimp, cilantro, and fructose (just used sugar instead). I added chopped bok choy and instead of using frozen veggies and canned mushrooms, I used fresh stir fry veggies and fresh mushrooms. This was delicious!

Loved this!  SO much better than the hot and sour soups they have at restaurants.  I used a delux and an asparagus stir fry mix.  Thanks for the great recipe!

A very good, surprisingly flavorful soup. I left out the shrimp (can't eat shellfish). It was fine without it, but I would reduce the cornstarch in it - too gelatinous. I used fresh veggies and I think it would not taste as good if I'd made it with frozen veggies.

Overall, a very good recipe and I'm picky about my soups! I'll try this one again.
