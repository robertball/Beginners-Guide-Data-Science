Different, rich, and delicious! I used turkey kielbasa, low fat mayo and low fat cream cheese. I used pickled jalapeno rings chopped instead of a fresh jalapeno. It could have actually been a bit spicier for me personally. I also added a sprinkle of salt and pepper and used a 4 cheese pizza blend since I could not find the 6 cheese blend. Our company loved it served with pita and tortilla chips. No leftovers! Thanks!

My boys loved this-it was gone in minutes!  I didn't have the cheese blend called for, so I just used grated cheddar with a little parmesan.  Also, someone mentioned that it was greasy-I used leftover kielbasa so the grease had already cooked out of it.  If I didn't have leftover, I would just fry up the diced pieces first to remove some of the fat and then add it to the dip.

Made this twice, experimenting both times. Reading the reviews, I first cooked the sausage a bit to remove some of the fat. Another change we made was to use Greek Yogurt in place of the mayonnaise. It was OUTSTANDING!!

I've made this for several years with jalapeño kielbasa (like it spicy), 3kinds of cheeses, then after cooking I top it off with a thin layer of raspberry chipolte sauce. Killer at parties.

Great simple recipe. I was worried it would be a bit overwhelming with so much mayo and cream cheese but, it was smooth and easy to eat with lots of flavor. PRO TIP use this dip with eggs in the morning; also mix a few spoon fulls into GRITS. SOOOOOOO Tasty. This simple dip could be used for a lot of different things.

I dice the kielbasa and sauté it in a skillet, then drain on a paper towel.
I then chop the bottoms of the green onions, jalapeño and habanero peppers (several of each) and sauté them in the drippings from the kielbasa, then drain. I add to taste.
I use the tops of the green onions without sautéing.

I hollow out a round loaf of King's Hawaiian Bread, fill with the mixture, replace the "lid," wrap in heavy duty foil and follow baking instructions.

I cut up the inside of the bread, plus another round loaf, into 1-1/2 inch cubes for dipping. 

Nothing but raves!!

Mine came out very greasy. Swimming in grease, actually. The flavor WAS delicious though. I think next time I'll change the way it's prepared, but definitely not the ingredients.

Fabulous Dip! The family really enjoyed this. Only thing I changed was that I decreased the Italian Cheese blend to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of Habanero Jack because my boys were dying to try that cheese :)

Tasty. Yes, cook sausage ahead and use paper towels to squeeze out grease.  Baguette bread is good, but might try tortilla chips also. Will make again.

I have made this at least half a dozen times and LOVE it!!!! It is very rich and flavorful.  I usually add extra peppers because I like it spicy.  I also Doctor it up depending on how I'm feeling or the crowd I am feeding.  Definately can't go wrong.

I would cook and drain the sausage first as it can be very greasy, other than that its a great recipe .

Make this last night and it was a hit! Made as written but I just sautéed the sausage to render off the fat before mixing it with the other ingredients. It wasn't greasy at all. Served it with a sour dough baguette. It was delicious! Thank you for this recipe!!!

Yum yum, took to a Superbowl party and everyone loved it! I made three small changes, I used pickeled jalapeños, and turkey kielbasa sausage since it has less fat. I also put in a crock pot to keep warm for a longer period. Will definitely make again.

Delicious. I agree with some of the other reviews that it was very greasy.  I took a few paper towels and had to dab off the grease.  Doesn't make a whole lot so if you are having a party you may want to double.

I really enjoyed this dip.  I made the dip as written and brought it to a pot luck at work in a small crock pot.  It wasn't as big a hit as I thought it would have been.

Followed directions exactly.  Good heat level (I used one jalapeño without seeds or ribs).  Flavor is a little lacking believe it or not. Very greasy - more than expected.  I think some ground sausage and more herbs would have been better.

Loved this recipe! Grilled the kielbasa first and only used  Blue Seal kielbasa. Cut a crusty rye bread up in large chunks to serve it with. Can't keep up with the requests for the recipe! Thank you for sharing.
