A nice way to prepare tahini for hummus or, if you leave out about half the lemon juice, for a spread to use on sandwiches. The lemon is a bit overwhelming at this ratio and affects the taste as well as consistency. In fact, I didn't need any water at all for either purposes. Thank you for the recipe.

I love this recipe.  When I am making any recipe and it calls for tahini, I use this version of the sauce, it is my favorite so far.

So easy and turned out very well. Goes well with buttered chicken and beef marsala.

Made this to go with my cauliflower steaks. Flavor is spot on using exact ratios provided....however, I don't know what I'm doing wrong with consistency. First time I made it, it was too runny, Second time I made it the consistency was perfect until I added the lemon juice/lemon zest and a Tbsp of warm water it became extremely pasty and dry! Help???
