Could not find black cumin seeds anywhere. I live next to one of the largest Indian merchant areas in New Jersey. No black cumin seeds to be found so I doubled up on the regular cumin seeds. Found the recipe to be a little bland so I added 1/2tsp of cayenne pepper and 1 tsp of curry powder. I used fresh thick cod filets and found them too delicate for the recipe. Next time I will use stripe bass or blackfish, All in all a pleasant flavor.

Also made this minus the black cumin. Came out wonderful.Flavorful without being 'hot'. If most Indian food is too spicy for you then this would be a good addition to your recipe box.Think I'll try it with salmon next time.

For those who could not find "black cumin" - it's not cumin and is a literal translation of the Bengali or Hindi name. It's sold under the name "kalonji" or "onion seeds" - any Indian grocery store will carry it.
Also it's not accurate to say that only the leftover pieces are used for curry. As a die-hard Bengali with roots in both Bengals, I remember the best curry made out of fresh Katla (Buffalo)/ Rui (Rehu or Carp) and Bhetki. Every slice was used.
