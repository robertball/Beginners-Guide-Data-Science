Liked this,but,yes, changed - only because I like cinnamon & I like maple but not together.I also am not up to buying more expensive anything (the higherpriced cottage cheese & margarine since I am okay with lactose) & am a huge fan of less dishes. ;D  Therefore,she continued,I didn't want to smooth the small amount of cottage cheese in the blender so searched for an alternative in sour cream(its already smooth,dont ya know?!) ... ..& My Sweet Sue isn't up to lactose so I look out for her  :)  I'm getting to the review.Its next!  :D  'Halved in an 8x11,coulda gone smaller;350,30mins.Combined 3/4cmilk,1/2T lemon juice & 1t ea maple & vanilla extracts.Creamed 1/2c butter w 3/4c white sugar.Beat in 1/4csour cream & 2eggs.
