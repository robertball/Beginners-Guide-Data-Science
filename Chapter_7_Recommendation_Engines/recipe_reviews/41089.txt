Really excellent flavors. It gets very thick, and I would add both more beer and more chicken broth (1/4 c. of each) next time. Overall, though, it was absolutely delicious!

I've made this twice, once with the gouda and the last time with cheddar.  Both were very good however, I did feel the gouda was on the salty side. I did substitute the chicken broth with veg. broth and it was still a wonderful soup.

I don't think I did anything wrong but this is one I didn't care for.  I threw it away, and this was not a cheap recipe to make.

I thought this was an excellent recipe (and a great way to use up leftover wild rice).  I really love smoked gouda and the combination of flavors and textures was wonderful.  I will definitely be making this recipe again!
