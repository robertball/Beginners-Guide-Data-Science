Came out very nice! I used a 3# breast.. potatoes, washed and quartered length-wise and laid on the bottom, carrots peeled and quartered, lain in the gaps of said potatoes. Toss in 6 c cloves. peel and qtr a red onion, but 'leafed' it and spread it out over the rest of the veggies. Concerned about moisture, added a cup of chicken stock. Turkey breast on top (be sure to sear it!!!). My crock pot has a thermometer , so set it to 165and was done, on high, 3 hours later.. let it stay on warm for an hour and I prepared the other sides, and came out beautifully...

The flavor of the turkey was really nice.. I liked the bit of heat. The acorn squash was yummy too.  The carrots and garlic were not done enough in 7 hours. My crock-pot was set on a timer  and then went to warm so I didn't get a chance to test them at 7 hours. If I had, I would have extended the cooking time. My own fault, but I think I might cut the carrots smaller next time and chop the garlic up

Very yummy and I loved this for an easy Fall recipe! I was unable to find a 4 lb turkey breast, so I used 2.5 lbs of turkey breast tenderloins. I cooked on high for 4 hours which turned out to be a little too long as the meat was starting to dry. Will definitely make again and adjust the cooking time. The vegetables were amazing! Next time I'm going to add a couple more carrots (my daughter loves them). Thank you for the recipe!

Scrumptious!  This is also a very "forgiving" recipe;  I used regular chili powder and cumin (which derives from the same plant) substituted nicely for coriander. And with no garlic cloves, I added a liberal amount of prepared crushed garlic. The flavor was still divine, and the meat so tender it was almost falling apart.  The red onions are definitely an inspired idea. I added the carrots and onions only and served the dish with mashed 'taters.  This is a keeper!

This is a perfect fall meal. I switched out the squash for red and Yukon potatoes and I would cut the chipotle seasoning in half next time because I'm not a fan of too spicy. Other than that I thought all the spices and seasonings worked well with the turkey, I will be making this again.

The spices on the turkey were superb, just a hint of heat and undertones of the cinnamon.  The meat was very juicy not dry at all. I enjoyed the carrots, red onion, and squash, but my kids would have liked potatoes more. Would make again??

Tasty and easy and a great alternative to a traditional Canadian Thanksgiving turkey dinner for two with turkey leftovers for a yummy sandwich.  Will do again!

I thought that this was a flavorless dish.  The spices added nothing.  The best that I can say is that the turkey was very moist and tender.

Very good turkey recipe. I make it for thanksgiving as it is a crowd pleaser, plus it is much easier than a whole turkey.

Recipe was very good just wish I had a larger crock pot. The dish had a lovely sweetness and reintroduced me to acorn squash which I enjoyed.
