This surprised me on how good it really tastes.  Of course, it is a bit high in fat, but for those with the ability to eat high fat foods it is really good, and actually very cheap way to utilize Spam with a different taste!  For those with a very limited income, this helps to spread the expense of eating to something that gives you a new flavor to enjoy!

I made a few 'healthy' changes, so I only gave this original recipe 3 *s.  I used (toasted) whole wheat buns and 'lite' Spam.... which is much lower in fat & sodium.  I put a couple of slices of turkey bacon over that, instead of using  (full fat) Spam w/bacon.  I enjoy  trying new recipes, but I always try to lighten them up a bit.  These were tasty, and we enjoyed them.

This was really good! Followed almost exactly as described (except I used a potato masher instead of shredding, which really worked in the seasoning). The ONLY change we made was adding some brown sugar to reduce the salty flavor of SPAM. We used around 2 tbsp, came out delicious (no you don’t taste much sweetness). Next time I’m going to try American cheese for the kidlet. The provolone was too stringy for him. Thank you!

Addictive sandwich. It is as good as it sounds. Make sure you add those extra seasonings written in the Cook's Note. I had to improvise on the bacon Spam® by using some pancetta and spam sautéed together. Wash it down with a cold beer, you won't be sorry. Thank you for the recipe.
