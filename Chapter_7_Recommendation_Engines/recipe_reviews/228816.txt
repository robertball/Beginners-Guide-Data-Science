This recipe is really delicious. My family can be very picky, and when I made it for them, they all loved it. Very easy. I improvised and used fresh bell peppers instead of out of the can.

Great enchiladas that aren't extremely heavy.  Didn't have chiles, so had to add some more spices to have enough flavor.  Very good:)

This was the first time I ever made enchiladas and I wasn't sure how my picky eaters would like I them.  I'm glad I can say they were a major hit. I also made the enchilada sauce. They were better then some I have had at some restaurants.I will definitely made them again.

These were good, except the brand of sauce I got was too spicy for my 7 yr old. I even got mild. Next time I won't get Las Palmas. I only used 1lb of chicken but I added a can of black beans. To save on calories, I used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Couldn't tell at all!

Delicious!  I have made this twice now. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and they were amazing. The second time I used chopped red bell pepper instead of the jarred roasted red peppers because we like a little crunch. I tossed the peppers in with the onions first for a few minutes, then added the chicken.  I also added 1/2 a can of black beans because my family likes them. Either way, so good!!!

Made as described and it was delicious.  Also made half a batch with added corn and black beans - loved this but not all family members like beans.  Only change was adding extra cheese (Monterey Jack).  I have extra chicken filling left over and I'm going to try it in a quesadilla tomorrow.

Love this recipe. It does take some time to prepare everything but the flavor is great. I love the chicken mixture just by itself. Will definitely make this again

I’ve made these several times. Last time I changed one thing and it made SUCH a difference! Instead of seasoning the chicken with cumin, use 2 tbsp of taco seasoning. It really takes the flavor to the next level!

It was very bland. I’m really glad I didn’t add all the sour cream it said to, it would have been soupy.  I’m still on the hunt for a good recipe

I cook the chicken in the crock pot adding taco seasoning, green chiles and roasted peppers.  Shred the chicken and add to the cheese/sour cream mixture and bake as directed.  Everyone at work loves them!

I made these using Morningstar Farms Chik'n strips and they turned out terrific.  The only thing I didn't like was that the flour tortillas were gummy in texture.  Maybe I used too much sauce?  Next time I might try corn tortillas for a firmer texture.  But a really good new recipe for us---thanks!

I give this recipe credit for inspiring me. I used a pre-cooked chicken, didn't have enchilada sauce so I used a can of Manwich (sloppy joe) sauce ,that I added cumin to. Made 4 big enchiladas, and they were delicious and so easy.

Excellent basic recipe.  I added a can of black beans.  You could/add delete vegetables based on your family's preference.   Very good and would work well with green sauce as well.

Very tasty. 6 chicken breasts is a lot for my family so I did 3 plus a can of white beans, but came up slightly short on filling for the last couple enchiladas. Next time I'll try two cans of beans. The seasoning was just right for us wimps using mild enchilada sauce and chiles with a slight reduction in the cumin.

My husband is not a fan of Mexican food, but I am. This recipe was the exception - he loved it! The only changes I made were that I only used 1 cup of light sour cream, and I used a combination of chicken breasts and boneless thighs. I did find that using 3/4 cup of the filling only made 9 enchiladas, so I would probably use a little less per roll the next time. This one is definitely a keeper!!

Have made this 3 or 4 times and it is always a hit.
Many times I halve the recipe with excellent results.

Very good recipe! In the past my enchiladas didn't come out well. The corn tortillas  are too dry and corny and the flour are too gluey. I used "whole wheat, high fiber, low carb tortillas"...perfect consistency for a tortilla.I accidentally used reduced fat cheese and it was FINE, ....I 'll never go back to regular tortillas. BF says add corn.

great recipe...however like every dish I make I adjusted for what I had in my cupboards.  I used previously cooked chicken and tossed it in after the onions were almost cooked and continued the recipe from there. I also didn't have enough chicken so I adjusted the amounts of the sour cream and cheese. Other than those 2 adjustments I followed the recipe and WOW! great dish.
