Used a 5 pound tenderloin for a X-mass day dinner for 12. Turned out excellent. I agree with other reviewers: DON'T GO CHEAP on the cut of meat! This recipe is made for a tenderloin and I also think it must be baked to work correctly. In addition, I baked 5 heads of garlic to use for the crust mixture. The more the better. Even if you're leery of garlic and horseradish, donâ€™t fear: when baked, the finished product is very mellow! Also, be sure to put the meat thermometer in the middle of the whole tenderloin. I took it out when the reading was just a little below medium rare,  covered with foil for 20 minutes before slicing. For a large tenderloin, the medium rare is in the middle and it gets progressively more well done as you cut out near the ends. For a large group, everyone got the "doneness" they preferred! I highly recommend this recipe.

Wow -- this recipe adds some wonderful flavor to an already impressive piece of beef. Great for dinner parties because it's very easy to make. To save time, I roasted the garlic a day before.

What they mean by "folding under the 3 inch small end" is, just tuck the small 3 inch narrow end under the loin when cooking.  That part of the meat is so small and thin, it usually cooks much faster than the rest of the loin.  You don't want that area to dry out.  You can also cut this portion off and save for another use. Hope this helps !!

I made this for Christmas Eve.  I used a 6 lb. tenderloin and trimmed all the fat.  I used 5 garlic heads and pre-made the crust part the night before.  I also used a decent brand of horseradish, which I think made a big difference.  My husband cooked the tenderloin on the gas grill using an indirect heat.  It took a little over an hour, using a meat thermometer.  The meat turned out great.  All our guests loved it.  I am actually going to try using this recipe on pork tenderloin.  I hope we get the same results.

Deeelicious!  This is a very tasty recipe!  I used tenderloin filets (filet mignon) and they turned out so tender & perfect!  I also used the homemade horseradish recipe from this site (which is fantastic) and it didn't at all overwhelm the taste of the meat, if anything, it made it even tastier.  I ws a little worried, cuz' hubby likes just plain steak, and he commented on how good this was.  Thanks CLM!

Well, our tenderloin happened to be delicious and VERY tender to begin with, but this crust made it even better!  We scaled the serving size to 2 and added a little more garlic and horseradish, and also some lemon pepper.  It was nice and spicy!  Mashed potatoes and corn are really good sides.  I definitely recommend this great recipe!

This is the best recipe!!  The horseradish sauce is out of this world.  I only had minced fresh
garlic on hand, so I browned about 1 1/2 tsp slightly in olive oil and continued with great results.
My cut of meat was a little larger, so I cranked the heat up to 400 for 45 minutes and it was perfect!
The sauce is so good that next time I'll double the amounts and use half on the tenderloin for cooking
and the other half to dredge it thru while eating!  EXCELLENT.

This is a special occasion recipe with terrific flavor.  When I was making the crust, the prepared horseradish was so strong that my eyes were watering.  After roasting, the flavors were mellow and mild, allowing the flavor of the beef to be the star.  Use a meat thermometer for best results.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a hit with the family.  We had scalloped potatoes, roquefort popovers, broccoli casserole and a nice green salad.  This will be our Christmas dinner from now on and a nice change from Ham. I agree with doubling the sauce, it was wonderful.  I didn't care for it leftover the next day.

This was the best main course I've ever served.  I had a dinner party of 14 people who all raved about the dish.  I tripled the recipe and used an eight pound beef tenderloin instead of the three pound suggestion.  This was enough for everyone with some left over.  I also served a horseradish dip with it that went very well.  Don't be intimidated.  Make it!

I opted for Top Sirloin steaks instead of the pricey Tenderloin.  I made it for two and it was delicious.  Instead of mashed potatoes, I made it with baked potato chips for a healthier option.

Boy, was I worried while I was putting together the ingredients for the crust!  The horseradish was so pungent that my eyes watered, and I thought the whole dish would turn out inedible.  Instead, my family (including my mom, who's a very discriminating cook) trooped out to the kitchen to scrape up extra crust from the roasting pan!  The roasting mellows the flavors tremendously.  Next time, I will start the roast at a very high heat for the first 5-10 minutes and brown the crust nicely, then turn the heat down and roast until done rare (140) on my meat thermometer.  Delicious!

Oh my. How wonderful! I can't believe the writer who thought this was a "waste of a terrific piece of meat". He/she must not like either beef, garlic, or horseradish, so has no business rating this recipe. My husband and I LOVED it. I did find the cooking times off .. I had a 1.5 lb piece of tenderloin, and cooked it 1 hour(!) at 400F to reach 140 degrees. It came out medium rather than medium rare. Next time I will cook it 50 mins .. maybe try it with a bit of Bernaise sauce. And there definitely WILL BE a next time!!!

I made this exactly as written for Christmas Eve, and my family was in heaven!  I was concerned that the crust would be too strong (my mother is not a fan of garlic OR horseradish, so was taking a chance), but the roasting process mellows the sharpness & just leaves wonderful flavor.  Will double the recipe for the crust next time because my brothers enjoyed it so much.

Very nice recipe. Presentation is spectacular. I actually just used a whole lot of minced garlic instead of roasting a garlic bulb. I am sure that method would be better but we were quite pleased with our way. I salted the tenderloin (only used one 3 pounder) and felt that it still needed more. Served with some mashed red potatoes hinted with rosemary and garlic powder. This made for a great combination. Next time I might put rosemary on the tenderloin as well.

We used this for a fundraiser (all garlic) dinner for our local art museum.  It was delicious, but the 3-ounces-a-person made for very skimpy portions.  I would have ordered more meat to feed our guests.

Loved this dinner...I made it for Christmas Eve and I've been asked to make it again for New Year's...I did however find that I had to cook the tenderloin almost an hour and 10 minutes to get it up to 'medium'....Probably my oven
Thanks so much

oh my gosh...I'm not even a big beef lover but we made this tonight for New Year's eve din & it was fantastic.  We did splurge for the cut of meat.  Even my 8 & 11 year old LOVED it.  It melts it your mouth.  First: sear at 500 for 5-10 min then cook at 400 til internal temp of 140.  YUM!

I loved this recipe!  It was really easy and oh so tasty!  I served it for a Christmas dinner party and it was a big hit. I do think the serving size if a little off - I used a 3 pound piece and it was just enough for 8 adults and 5 small children. (Some of the kids even liked it!) 
I didn't actually get a "crust" so next time I may try to broil it for a few minutes at the end to harden the garlic/horseradish.  Even though the meat was expensive, this was a super dish that I will certainly serve again!

This was amazing!  I used pork tenderloin instead of beef, and it was so moist, tender, and had such a wonderful flavor.  I served with au gratin potatoes (also from this website) and made one heck of a dinner!!  Will definitely make again!!!

Great recipe for entertaining.  I made this for a New Year's Eve dinner party and everyone raved about the flavor.  The horseradish and garlic add such a nice flavor to the meat.  I paired it with a nice brussel sprouts and pearl onion recipe.  It is a bit pricey to make but well worth the money.  I will definitely make it again!

Good, but something was off. I love horseradish and garlic and was so eager to try this, but was not all that impressed. The flavors do mellow after cooking, but there is still somewhat of a flavor clash -- I think it may have been the basil. Probably would not make this again.

This was so good and the flavor was so much more mild than you would think using horseradish and garlic.  I baked mine to an internal temp. of 160Âº and it came out perfectly (slighly pink in the very center) and so tender.  The next morning, we cut thin slices and used them on a beef, egg and cheese sandwich on english muffins.  Wonderful!

I am not a big fan of horseradish but it added a nice taste to the tenderloin. I agree with previous reviews...splurge for the tenderloin...it was incredibly tender!

This is fantastic even grilled.  Just grill over indirect medium heat for 35-45 minutes for medium rare.  I doubled the garlic-horseradish crust to toss half with vegetables that I grilled in a grilling basket to go with dinner.  Worked out excellent and easy.

Was disappointed in this recipe.  Smelled wonderful while the garlic was roasting and then when the meat was cooking, but the taste was very plain and you could not taste the garlic at all.  Would probably not make again.

I went to two different grocery stores to buy Beef Tenderloin and both were out.  So in order to save time and expense, I bought (don't kill me...) pork tenderloin instead.  I made this for company and we all really enjoyed it.  It was a wonderful flavor and the meat was juicy.  Our guests loved it and I will definitely serve it again.  It was soooo easy!

Oh, WOW!  This was absolutely fabulous!!  I got nothing but compliments on Christmas Eve with this dish.  They couldnt believe that so few ingredients could produce such outstanding flavor. For those who thought that this dish didn't have enough flavor, did you use any seasoning, like salt?  I used some sea salt with it and followed the recipe exactly.  I did have to cook it longer than the recipe said...about 40 minutes longer but my tenderloin was bigger so I expected that.  It was well worth the wait!

I can't say enough about this recipe. It was fantastic. I served it to 14 people for a pre-holiday dinner party and two of them are serving it for Christmas and New Year's dinner.  I cooked about 8 1/2 lbs for the 14 of us and that was plenty. I will be making this again.

This is a foolproof, tasty way to prepare beef tenderloin and now my standard for preparation. Very flavorful but not overpowering. I use convection roast on my oven, and pull it out at 130 because we like it rare.

Don't let the cost of the tenderloin turn you off to this recipe.  It was a BIG hit for Christmas dinner with roasted veggie!!!!!  Very easy to prepare so my Husband and I could enjoy our guests.  Worth every penny and very  very tender and flavorful. Enjoy

The recipe was great, but it seems to lack the every-day person necessities (really, who has 2.5 hours to cook?) It was a family hit and we'll have it again!

I couldn't afford the Beef Tenderloin at 10.99/lb so I bought a different slab of meat.  I also didn't roast the garlic- I minced it instead.  I have no idea what 'prepared horseradish' is so I used horseradish sauce.

Used this for a dinner party. Came out perfect. Had anywhere from rare to medium well as we sliced thru the tenderloin.

Excellent recipe!  Super easy to make.  I saved the drippings from the roasting pan and made a demi glaze with beef broth, garlic & wine.  Sliced the tenderloin thin with an electric knife and served on fresh mini sour dough rolls with horseradish sauce on the the side.  Delicious!

Don't let the thought of the strong horseradish and garlic put you off. It smells strong while applying to the meat, but the flavors really blend and mellow while baking. It is flavorful, but not overwhelming. The prep time means it's probably not an every day dinner, but I made it for a dinner party and got rave reviews. Most lukewarm reviewers used a different cut of meat. It is expensive, but worth the taste for a once -in -a -while treat to use a good tenderloin. prefect for the holidays!

I substituded a beef rump roast, less expensive, and it was wonderful.  I also think it is necessary to make sure you have a crispy crust by broiling the last few minutes.

OUTSTANDING! And I didn't even use beef tenderloin, I used pork tenderloin (it was on sale). I doubled the garlic, using two heads, and I roasted it differently: I roasted two heads at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes. Everything else stayed the same. The pork was moist and delicious. I can't WAIT to try this recipe using beef tenderloin! The crust isn't really a crust... more like a dressing. I loved it.

After reading all of these reviews, I was expecting my beef tenderloin to be absolutely amazing.  It was only okay - about how I would expect garlic, horseradish, and beef to taste when put together.  The "crust" wasn't very crusty.

Whoa. This wasn't bad but it really wasn't good either. I couldn't taste the garlic at all and I definitely prefer my horseradish on the side!!! My guests said they liked it but I think they were being polite. There are better ways to prepare tenderloin.

My family and I just thought it was okay. It didn't ruin the beef but it also didn't enhance it. Even though I used the full garlic bulb, I would have liked more garlic flavor.

This was a waste of a terrific piece of meat.  It was WAY too horseradishy.  Luckily, I cut the tenderloin in half and made the other half my old way for the kids ~ we all ended up eating the kids' half.

I have been doing this recipe for years now and it now has become a "must have" when friends come over for our annual Christmas Dinner.  I usually cook the beef the day before, making sure it is rare when taking it out and immediately wrap it in foil.  The next day, I put it in the over for about 45minutes to an hour and it is the juiciest beef tenderloin ever!

This is the best!  I have always gotten great reviews when I serve this.  The garlic / horseradish combination is awesome.  The only thing I would say is to make a bit more so you can lay in on heavier on the tenderloin (if you are a garlic fan!)

I listened to another review and upped the horseradish to 1 cup and the garlic to 5 heads.  I would add about 15 to 20 minutes to the cook time because my first attempt came out almost raw and my second attempt was slightly over done.  Other than that, excellent!

Superb flavor, and easy to make.  My family raved about it last Christmas Eve, and I plan to do a repeat performance.  I paired this with Shrimp Scampi Bake (from this website!), baby red potatoes, a salad, and winter blend veggies.

One idea I may add this year is to roast an extra bulb of garlic for spreading on bread or rolls at the table.  

Thanks for a keeper!

This was heaven... We loved it!  I didn't buy a tenderloin, but two .75 lb tenderloin steaks and then halved the recipe but followed directions otherwise except only baked for 1/2 hour and it turned out medium and it was perfect.  The meat was so good and tender already but I thought the seasonings compeltely enhanced the flavor.  I made a horseradish sauce to serve with it and poured the drippings in a bowl for au jus.  Wonderful!

While I like the flavoring of this recipe, I just could get the "crust" to form.  Both times I made it, it was too soggy and we ended up wiping off the outside.  We did enjoy the flavor the horseradish and garlic gave the meat but it was too bad we couldn't enjoy the crust part of it.  Any tips would be appreciated!

Made this for dinner last night and it was a HIT!  We enjoyed the flavor of the horseradish and garlic.  The local grocery sells garlic which has already been roasted, so it was a time saver for me.  Great flavor!
