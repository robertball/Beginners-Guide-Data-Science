Quick and easy. Cut the recipe in half since the whole recipe would have been too much. Added chopped walnuts, which I will not do again. Maybe my walnuts were old! Like that there was little fat/oil compared to other recipes and the fact that it was easy to half recipe. The red pepper was a nice touch. I will make again when I have a sweet tooth but skip walnuts and the red food coloring.

these were amazing.  i did make a couple of minor tweaks, such as adding a teaspoon of ground ginger to complement the red pepper (i used cayenne, it was all i had), and adding pecans because my husband wanted a brownie with nuts.

the only thing that bothers me is that the red food coloring never seems to survive the baking process.  i have yet to make a red velvet anything that didn't just look like regular chocolate.

either way, these were amazing and at the top of my go-to list for brownies.

Easy to prepare, pretty to look at and tasty as well. Cake like texture rather then a gooey brownie. I replaced the sour cream with yogurt the only change I made. The batter was so thick it was hard to spread out evenly in the pan, I was a little worried about that but it all turned out fine.

These came out delicious! Very soft and gooey, just the way I like it. The only changes I made were that I didn't add in the red pepper and I swirled cream cheese frosting on top (which I totally recommend doing!)

Everything I wanted in a brownie this evening. Fudgy, tangy and a little spice. With the great crisp on top that makes a brownie a brownie instead of a cake.

Ours turned out a little dry, but that could have been due to being a little short on butter and/or having an old gas oven. So I'm giving the 5 star based on the flavor.  We nixed the food coloring, substituted Greek yogurt for sour cream because that's what we had, and went light on the sugar.  They were very chocolaty, and we liked the spicy kick. The yogurt/sour cream gives a hint of the cream cheese icing.

The ultimate brownie. Texture and taste altho I had to add 10 minutes in my gas oven. But the result was just perfect. Empty tray, people picking at crumbs.

They were pretty good. The red pepper was unique with a little after bite. Didn't have any red food coloring, but I don't think that would have effected the taste. Got them between cake like and gooey.

This is absolutely amazing... the hint of red pepper in the aftertaste gives it just the right kick. I didn't bother with the icing, we liked it as it was. The only change I made was to use half a cup of grated beets for the colour instead of the food colouring. It increased the cooking time by about 5 minutes. Will definitely be making again!
