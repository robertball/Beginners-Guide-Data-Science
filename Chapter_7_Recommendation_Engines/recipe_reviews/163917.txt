We absolutely love this!  Had it as a side one night and the next night I put it on fresh spinach with fresh mozzarella, and grilled chicken for a healthy salad.  The sauce made a wonderful dressing for the salad.

After hearing so much good stuff about this dish I had to try it.  Made it last night for supper, and about half way through the meal my husband said he was getting full and couldn't finish it all.  Well, when all was said and done he left his stuffed potato(which he loves) mostly uneaten, and took seconds of this!  I just had the leftovers for lunch, and it is just as good the next day!  Thanks Sunny!

Oh. My. Goodness. This is outstanding! I only added a little minced garlic, I made no other changes. Recipe didn't specify which kind of mushrooms to use, so I used baby bellas. I tried it before I let it set in the fridge, and had to hurry to put it away. Amazing. So wonderful. This one's going to be made a lot this summer, I can tell. Thanks, Sunny.

We've had glorious weather lately and I wanted an easy dinner to serve the family on the patio.  This fit the bill for a side dish using our first batch of cherry tomatoes.  Wonderful, easy to prepare, and a perfect complement to the Grilled Sirloin Steak with Garlic Butter also from AR. Served over romaine leaves to add a bit of greens to the dinner and Texas toast.  Easy, peasy!  Thank you Sunnybird!

Sorry, followed the recipe exactly and it was not a hit.  Made for a potluck and it was the only thing left at the end of the evening.

Awesome recipe, great for when the cherry tomato plant is going crazy producing! I don't find the sugar neccessary for the dressing, especially when using super high quality balsamic.

So yummy! I forgot to purchase fresh basil, so I used dried instead. Flavors were still really good. Next time will be with the fresh basil and I know that will be amazing because there is nothing like the taste of fresh basil. I also used baby bella (crimini) mushrooms which hold up great and are nice and meaty in texture. Simple, easy and a very tasty side dish. Will make again. Thanks SunnyB for posting!

Although we could only rate 5 stars, I'm still giving this a 10!! Oh my goodness, this is simply divine! I made the recipe as written except I used half veg oil half olive oil. I marinated for 3 hours and it was great. I LOVE the slight sweetness of the dressing, please do not cut down the amount of balsamic. It may seem like a lot, but there is sugar added and it's just delicious. My boyfriend doesn't care for balsamic vinegar, and he really loves this salad! The next day, I chopped up some fresh mozzarella and added that, WOW! I highly recommend this recipe, my only regret is that I didn't make this early in the summer with my abundance of garden fresh tomatoes. Thanks SunnyB, this is one super creation that I will make many times :)

Another winner from Sunny!!  Made it two nights ago for my BF and he loves it!  I don't like tomatoes or mushrooms (weird) so I was feeling left out watching him inhale it.  Last night I remembered I had some raw green beans.  He had eaten almost all of the tomatoes and mushrooms and there was plenty or marinde left so I threw in some green beans.  I'm having them for lunch.  Delicious!!  Thanks Sunny!

This is a great, light summer salad!  A nice alternative to a Caprese salad.  I used steak mushrooms which were very meaty.  I think next time, I might cut the cherry tomatoes in half.  Fresh basil and good balsamic is the key.

This was great.  At Thanksgiving I was on a 21 day cleanse where I couldn't eat much else but veggies, fruit and chicken/turkey or fish.  So after leaving out the sugar this was a perfect addition for me to our Thanksgiving meal.  I made it the night before and it was delish!  I usually use mozzarella in this instead of the mushrooms to make a Caprese salad but it is just as wonderful with mushrooms!

Nice change of pace for tomato salads.  I used slicing tomatoes instead of cherries because that's what I had on hand.

Nice dish! Very light, fresh and flavorful as well as looking lovely on the plate. The longer this sits, the more the flavor deepens. I used grape tomatoes and they were so tiny I just left them whole. Followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased.

I used small bite sized mushrooms and added an orange bell pepper for additional color. Nice presentation and I like that the mushrooms are not cooked like a lot of other recipes. Pleanty of marinade to add extra mushrooms and tomatoes. I'll try some mozzarella cheese next time too.

I made these for a family get together where I had to bring the relishes and they were a big hit.   I substituted extra virgin olive oil for vegetable oil and marinated them overnight.

Love this recipe!! I sauteed my mushrooms in a bit of EVOO first (I don't like raw mushrooms) and also added EV Olive Oil instead of veg oil. Super yummy. I did add a bit more fresh basil too.. just cause I love it!!  Great with steak or balsamic chicken!!

This is fantastic! I brought it for a potluck and it was the first dish to go. Thanks so much for this GREAT recipe.

Just a note, when I refrigerate it overnight, my tomatoes still tasted okay but the dish became quite watery. Perhaps I'll try to only refrigerate it for 3 hours, as suggested by the original recipe.

My husband said "this is really good". He never comments on anything. Thanks, Next time, which will probably be next week, I'm going to add some cucumbers.

Phenomenal. This was amazing and I will definitely be making this regularly while tomatoes are in season. I halved the recipe, but otherwise followed it exactly. I wouldn't change a thing!

My family loved it. I used 12 oz of the cherub grape tomatoes. Did not halve them, instead I used a corn cob holder to poke a few holes in them so they could soak up the dressing, yet hold their shape. Worked nicely! I also added some mini balls of fresh mozzarella an hour before serving and cut them in half. I had to add extra vinegar to mine only because I think the quality of the balsamic I had on hand was not the greatest and I did not have time to run and get more. We loved it. Thanks for a keeper.

This salad was a hit at a friends party. Being a Californian in Texas often makes me a fish out of water. I never know how dishes are going to do at gatherings. Everyone was raving about it! the only addition was shaved fresh parmesan on the top.

Very good.  I do think it had a lot of liquid, could possibly cut back.  I added fresh mozzarella right before serving.  I also used the Bellini mushrooms, nice choice. I will make again.

This was good but I think I overdid the mushrooms (I added more) and it wasnt as strong on the flavor as I would have liked. will try again with a heavier emphasis on tomatoes. Made as is otherwise.

Wow, this was really good!  I used sliced white mushrooms and cut up tomatoes from the vine, as well as fresh basil.  My husband and I LOVED it, but the kids weren't crazy about it.  I don't hold that against the recipe though, they generally aren't crazy about anything with tomatoes.  And as advertised, it was EVEN BETTER the next day!  I will definitely be making this again.  It will be especially good served to company over the summer with home grown tomatoes.

I would have loved to take a picture of my final product - but the guests finished this before I could grab my camera!! It is fresh and delicious! Made no edits to the recipe and let it marinate overnight. Super easy and a good crowd-pleaser. Looking forward to making it again!

This was just ok for me, it didn't blow my socks off. Next time I'm going to use evoo instead of vegetable oil and the whole time that I was eating it, I kept thinking how good fresh mozzarella would taste in it. I also drained off some of the dressing, I thought it was a little too much. Also, the dark color turned the kids off and most of the pictures for this recipe did not have that brownish color, I guess they used something else. I will make this recipe again.

I want to get into this recipe, and have made it twice now, but I don't understand all the amazing reviews.  Yes, it's super easy and tasty, but it doesn't blow me away.  Perhaps this is because I'm not the biggest fan of raw mushrooms, but I would like to try this as written and then saute.

Wonderful, refreshing salad! Perfect for a hot summer day!  I whipped this together in no time and let it marinate for approx. 3 hours!  Used fresh basil straight from my garden.  DELISH!  Can't wait to make again!

A PERFECT 5 star recipe!  This was delicious both before chilling and after chilling.  I look forward to making it with home-grown tomatoes this summer and serving blue cheese or feta on the side.  Thank you Sunny for sharing such a FABULOUS recipe!

Wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly except for using grape tomatoes. Marinated it overnight and added a diced avocado 30 minutes before serving. My son and bf loved it! I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch today. The dressing had just the right "bite." Will be making this often. I think it would be delicious served over grilled chicken breasts.

This recipe was wonderful! I was worried, because I'm not crazy about mushrooms in general, but they were delicious in this recipe. I ate it both plain and also served finely chopped over cheesy homemade focaccia bread, which I loved as well. I actually ate it for a few days in a row and didn't notice the tomatoes getting very soggy as another reviewer did, but my tomatoes were fresh from the farmers market.

This was very good. The marinade is almost identical to one I use for portobellos. Fresh basil is essential; dried is useless in a recipe like this. I used pure maple syrup instead of sugar, and I served the salad over spring mix. Best the first night, though; the tomatoes got mushy the next day.

This was an instant hit at our house.  I made it to serve aside a cheese plate, and then we used some to top salads, and some on little brie flatbread pizzas.  Now every time mushrooms go on sale I feel compelled to buy extra and make this.

Very tasty.  I add 16 oz of mozzarella to the mix.  I prefer to quarter the mushrooms, instead of the traditional slicing, so that they stay firmer.  Leftovers are good for a night or two.

We really liked this.  I found the recipe because I had too many tomatoes.  I bought some cherry tomatoes and romas.  Then husband bought some grape and beefsteak.  So I used a little of each of them.  I didn't have fresh basil so used dried.  The only thing I did a little different was to put some crumbled feta on mine. I know the recipe says 8 servings, but for us it was 2.  (Had it with chicken salad on red-leaf lettuce and with cantaloupe.)

This was fantastic!  I didn't do onions as I'm not a fan.  I used regular mushrooms and added cucumber, too.  Next time I think I'll add mozzarella or something.  Super yummy as is, though.

Loved it!  I just wish I had put in more mushrooms!  The tomatoes and mushrooms had a great flavor and it is a nice light, cool summer dish.  I added a vidalia onion and garlic and let the dish sit overnight in the fridge.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic! I scaled this recipe to 2 servings to give it a try due to having limited basil on hand and having tried balsamic vinegar in a chicken recipe and not being a big fan. This was fantastic. I think it could use less vinegar and still be great. I think it may even be great with raw apple cider vinegar. I love that this is part of the Myplate recipe collection. I'll be making this one again.

I loved this...I had to have a taste once it was made and it was great without even marinating the 3 hours.  I can't wait to taste it again when it is ready.  I didn't have any fresh basil, so I just sprinkled in a good amount of dried basil.  I also used 1 1/2 packets of Splenda instead of sugar.  This one is a keeper!!

Oh, man!  This is OUTSTANDING!  I could eat this all day long.  I have made this three times now.  The first two times I made about half the recipe, once using cherry tomatoes and once using a beautiful summer tomato from the farm market.  Last night I had just enough leftover  Maple- Balsamic Vinaigrette, also from this site, so I used that in place of this dressing and used grape tomatoes.  Every time it has been excellent.  I like to serve this at room temperature atop salad greens, drizzling a little of the marinade over the greens.  I also want to try using this to make bruschetta!  YUM!

These were excellent. I only had time to marinate for one hour and they still turned out great. Next time I will atleast tripple the marinate so I can use it to drizzle over salad. Thanks for the recipe Sunny!

I loved this recipe, but my husband just thought it was OK. He thought the chunks were too big even thought I quartered the mushroom caps and halved the tomatoes. I did add small cubs of mozzarella cheese and that was tasty. Thanks for the recipe, I'll have to make it for a gathering some time.

Delicious without any changes to the recipe. I had not had tomatoes with mushrooms before (except in a fry up) and was doubtful about the mix of flavours, but they go together well.

This was just wonderful!  Used tomatoes from the garden and I know there was more than what was called for so I did double the dressing.  Not necessary!  We had to pour some of it off.  Very, very tasty.  Thank you!

I had to make this twice, the first time I never got any because my husband ate it all while I was at work!  A good way to use up tomatoes from our plants. The mushrooms were big so I quartered them rather than leave whole.

Very nice!  I used olive oil, as suggested by others, and for purely aesthetic reasons, I think I might try using white balsamic vinegar next time, just to avoid the slight brownish colour.  But this tastes great (even though dinner plans changed and the veggies ended up marinating for over 24 hours!)

Delicious! I used olive oil instead of veg oil and added fresh buffalo mozarella "pearls" (little balls of mozz). Great on day one, even better on day two. Will make this one over and over. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a delicious salad. The combination was interesting and tasty. It felt too soggy though, which is why I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5.

I loved this salad. I made it last night and let it marinade until tonight when we ate it. I kept wanting to get into it but decided I had to let it alone to marinade as the recipe states. This was so great. I served along side a small steak and it was perfect with it and so satisfying. It will be a great grill salad to serve in the summer with grill outs. I am on a restricted diet so I used olive oil for the oil, Splenda for the sugar, and no-salt for the salt and it was perfect and legal. I took a little bowl out for tomorrow and hid it for me. Isn't that selfish. Now I can't wait for lunch tomorrow and to take it to work and let everyone ooh and aah over it.  Great new find which we will enjoy many times.

So delicious and so different. I cut the mushrooms into quarters and used Splenda instead of sugar, and canola oil instead of vegetable. My husband loved it.  Update: I increased this to 50 portions for a special party. It was a big hit. Everyone was raving about it. Cherry tomatoes are hard to find for some reason around here, so I just used grape tomatoes.

Sometimes simplicity is key.  This was great.  I used smaller home-grown tomatoes, but it's a great way to use up veggies.

Totally simple and delicious.  Almost like heirloom tomatoe salad! I don't think you can go wrong with good balsamic, oil and s&p!! I added shredded parmesean & romano (premixed from digiorno) when I plated up!  I picked this recipe to use up some mushrooms and tomatoes that were on their last days, SO GLAD I DID...can't wait to use fresh beautiful ingredients! 5 STARS...thank you!

This was sooooo good and very easy! I used the leftovers as a salad topper. I had to use yellow onions because that is all I had on hand.

Excellent!  I added about 2 Tablespoons of cider vinegar to the dressing which I definitely recommend.  Fresh basil is also a must.  I don't think it would be nearly as good with dried.
