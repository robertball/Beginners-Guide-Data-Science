Lovely and simple recipe if you plan ahead (10 days). This is similar (if not the same) drink they call VIP at Del Frisco's and the Stoli Doli at Capital Grille.

This is very delicious and smooth so it can sneak up on you if you aren’t careful. I didn’t want to waste the pineapple so I used it as garnish. Yummy!
