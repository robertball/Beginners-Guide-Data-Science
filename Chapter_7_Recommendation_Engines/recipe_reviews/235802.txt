This is my family's favorite recipe for roasted potatoes. The last time I made it we had some locally grown St Augustine Sweets onions. I doubled the vinaigrette and put cut onions with the potatoes. Delicious!

These were good. I'd built them up a little more in my head w/the roasted garlic vinaigrette but they were just good. I used elephant garlic as it's what our grocery store had (and I assumed it'd have a stronger garlic flavor actually) and yellow mustard per personal preference. I also cubed my potatoes for a shorter bake time. If I made these again I think I'd use butter in place of oil and dry mustard in the vinaigrette. These are definitely worth trying and tweaking to your own personal tastes. THANKS for the recipe!
