I used a frozen banana, also used 1/2 tbs of Nesquick choc syrup but will not  if I made it again. I just think any chocolate is extra. Its very tasty without it.

This was good. I decided to use chocolate syrup in place  of the chocolate. Made it easier to blend.

When I was making the smoothie I noticed that it wasn't clumping together like it should, so I added about a cup of ice and it was fine.  All in all this is one of my new favorite recipes.

A delicious breakfast this morning! I used a frozen banana because I prefer really cold thick smoothies, and I used 1.5 oz Lily's chocolate chips to keep it sugar free.
