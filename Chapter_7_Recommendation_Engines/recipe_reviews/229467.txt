These cookies taste like a normal chocolate chip cookie should taste! But my cookies did not flatten out as I expected so next time I will flatten them a bit before baking. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and about a third whole grain white flour. My husband likes these too which is great because I made them for him.

These cookies are really great! Although I would watch the sizes! I used the rounded table spoon and it only made half the recipe! I couldn't find sugar free chocolate chips at my local grocers however I found miniature sugar free Hershey's dark chocolate bars. Two small bags crushed up worked perfectly! Reduces the sugar even more! Great for diabetics! Will definitely keep this recipe for the future!!

These are good cookies the turn out to be soft & puffy. I followed the recipe exactly. you really need to press them flat though as they don't spread at all.
