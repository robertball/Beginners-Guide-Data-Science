Spicy is right!  Wow! This recipe calls for a good beer, some lemonade or iced-tea on the side! These ribs were pretty good but next time I'll cut down on the red pepper flakes.  I found the intensity of the heat almost overpowers the other flavors, but all in all good flavor combination and the ribs were really tasty.  Only reason I'm holding back one star is for the reason listed above, but for sure this recipe is worth making and I plan to make it again soon.  Thanks Ryan!

A bit spicy, I will cut down on the jalapenos next time. But VERY good. Baked in the oven to avoid the snow! Thank you for the recipe.

I cut back on the peppers and didn't add the cracked red pepper. It didn't have enough heat, but the favors were great and it set up an nice char on the ribs on the grill. Next time I will add the pepper flakes

Family enjoyed these, I only used half the crushed red pepper (some of the kids don't like spicy)

I left out the jalopena peppers & they were still spicy enough.

These were the best ribs I have made in a long time!! I had to cook in the oven for the second cook just due to being out of propane. Great flavor and tenderness. Can only imagine how good they would have been on the grill. I used a can of "el pato" and left out the jalape√±os and sorry I did. Next time will be soon!!!
