The sauce is great - make it!  Because of other reviews of the fish I changed the cooking method and had great success.  I used the same seasonings but pan fried the Tilapia filets in a little butter and olive oil.  I used medium high heat to get crispy edges.  I sprinkled lemon juice over the top - fabulous!

I loved the dill sacue for this recipe.  The fish itself was ok, and it would have gotten less stars had it not been for the dill sauce.  It was great, and I only made 2 fish fillets but kept the dill sauce the same so I could use it on my steamed asparagus.  It tasted great on both the fish and asparagus.  I used plain fat-free yogurt instead of sour cream, and light mayo.  That way I could feel better about eating so much of it.  ;)

This was pretty good.  I realized as I was prepping that I was out of cajun seasoning, so I just used a little garlic powder and crushed red pepper.  I am also wary of drying the fish out, as has happened to me too often, so I put a little butter on before seasoning.

Made the sauce exactly as the recipe calls for.  I found it to be just a little tart, but the family seemed to like it.  (I tend not to put lemon on my fish, so I'm probably biased)

Was very easy, so I'll make again.

This would have been just another fish recipe if not for the sauce; serving the two together exceeded any expectations I might have had.  The only helpful hint I would even dare to suggest would be to make the sauce the day before to allow the flavors to marry and to serve at room temparture.  Outstanding recipe!

Excellent recipe! Loved the dill sauce! I did add a bit more garlic powder than called for, I used about 1/4 tsp. instead of 1/8 tsp. I didn't have fresh dill so I used 1 Tsp. dry dill instead. I also used Old Bay seasoning instead of Cajun seasoning on the fish. Make the dill sauce ahead of time to let the flavors marry.

Every now and then I come across a recipe that far exceeded my expectations and this was one of them. Whoa, was this good! We blackened the tilapia with the Cajun seasoning in a cast iron skillet on the charcoal grill, something we always enjoy. The dill sauce (which I served at room temperature), while very good, was nothing unique or special on its own. But put the two together and you've got something extraordinary! The spice of the seasoned fish tempered and mellowed by the creamy sauce was a sensational combination! Excellent recipe!

I love this recipe just for the sauce! I use whatever fish (mahi, salmon, etc) I have on hand, and I don't season the fish. I sub low-fat plain yogurt for the mayo & sour cream, and I add WAY more fresh lemon juice & 1/2 tsp of sugar. It is fab and healthy.

This recipe is really good!  The only thing I didn't like was that the sauce was cold and made the fish cool down really quick.  So next time I will heat up the sauce as well.  Very good!  Thank you!

I'm not a lover of tilapia so I substituted sea bass, one of my favorite fish.  Instead of using a baking dish I used a cast iron skillet and, because I was roasting other stuff with it, baked it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, which gave it a nice golden exterior.  However, since it was a thick piece of fish, it needed extra cooking time. 
What really makes this recipe is the dill sauce, which is cool and creamy and a nice contrast to the Cajun seasoning. This is definitely on my list of things to make again.

I enjoyed this recipe and it was very easy to make.  The dill sauce went well with the tilapia.  My husband found this to salty.  We will try it again but with no salt and I will try lemon pepper instead of the cajun seasoning.

this was good.  I used mahi-mahi since it was the only fish I had.  A good quick, healthy dinner.  My husband really liked the dill sauce and I used low fat mayo & sour cream.

I do not cook very often, because I am not only new at it,...but I can be quite awful. This recipe was amazingly simple, quick and flavorful. A glass of chardonnay is a perfect pairing. I am now a member of this website because of this recipe.

I laid it on a bed of jasmine rice with lemon zest and quartered grape tomatoes. With a side of asparagus. 

Delicious

I have to force myself to eat fish; it is just not one of my favorite foods, but this recipe made it almost a pleasure. My fillets were quite small and my Cajun seasoning really salty so I didn't use anywhere near a tablespoon.  And even though I used reduced fat mayo and fat free sour cream, the sauce was still delicious.  I had leftover sauce which I used on some cucumbers.  This was an excellent recipe and I'll use it again the next time I feel guilty for not eating fish.  Thanks so much for the post!

First of all...I do not like fish.    So when I attempt to make a fish meal, I prefer to use tilapia, as it if the least "fishy" of them all.    I followed this recipe exactly, except I cooked them in a pan using a little bit of olive oil and tad of butter.  Cooked on med high heat to creat a crunchy exterior.    First off...the fish.  I have to say, this was GOOD.  I liked the crispiness the pan frying gave the fish and the flavor was great.  The cajun seasoning combined with the pepper and mild fish was rather pleasant.  I found that I didn't even need to eat it with the dill sauce.    I am excited this turned out so well because it will give me the oportunity to get more fish into my diet.    Also, the dill sauce is good to use as a veggie dip. (I am dipping carrots into it right now as I type this)

WOW...........THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY!!!  I fixed this without the lemon cause I'm not a big fan of "citrusy" foods.  I did add heavy cream to the mayo/sour cream sauce and doubled it as well.  It makes NO SENSE HOW GOOD THIS WAS!!!!!!!!!!  Made this with the "Mushroom Orzo" dish on here.  Spreaded the sauce all over the pasta and toasted some sliced bread with butter in the oven to dip in the sauce.  Can't go wrong with this one, ya heard meh!!!

I honestly don't see how this can get any less than 5 stars. I just made this dish exactly as described, and it was incredibly delicious. Not too bland, and not too spicy. And the dill sauce was perfect. This recipe is definitely going into our fish rotation. We love tilapia, and this is now one of our favorites. Thanks so much!

Mmph, this was okay.  I may have used too much seasoning as it completely overpowered the fish.  The sauce was mediocre.  I make better homemade tarter.  Maybe better with a stronger fish, tilapia is just too delicate for this, in my opinion.

Just finishing cleaning up my plate with this dish, outstanding.  I used a bit less cajun seasoning and about 1/4 tsp of garlic powder, otherwise as written.

The sauce is also excellent on baked potatoes.  If you don't have anything else you want the sauce for, you could probably do with about 1/2 of it.

Thanks for a great recipe!

I am giving this five stars because this recipe has made me like tilapia. I have always hated tilapia when anyone made it. It has always tasted so bland but this recipe rocks. I did alter it a little bit. For the sauce, I added more dill, a bit more lemon, salt, pepper and minced garlic (from a jar) to taste. Based on the original recipe I tasted more sour cream than anything. 

I also decided that I wanted a little crunch so I mixed the cajun seasoning with cornmeal, breaded and baked the fish at 425 for 12 minutes. No need for salt and pepper with Cajun seasoning. This will be part of my rotation, thanks for making me a tilapia lover!

Pretty darn good. My SO thought that the lemon flavor was too strong, I disagree although I like that it masked the taste of the fish. I love the dill sauce, I omitted the mayo because I don't like it and added about 1/4 tsp of horseradish and dried roasted garlic instead of the powder. Thanks for the recipe:)

I love dill. This recipe was great, went a little wild with the cajun seasoning, was quite spicy. I could eat a bowl of the sauce alone, fantastic. Definitely will make this again and again and again.

Changed the sauce a bit. Substituted plain Greek yogurt for mayo & sour cream. I also added cilantro but I would recommend Parsley and maybe even minced cucumber. Good dish, served with dirty rice & fire roasted veggies

Hudson's Baked Tilapia Haiku: "Make this for THE sauce. Not a thrilling fish, s'alright. But the sauce is yum!" I made extra of the dill sauce b/c I plan on mixing it w/ some tuna and slapping it on a sandwich w/ melted swiss later today. As far as this recipe in its entirety goes, tilapia is already a pretty blah fish, so the cajun seasoning does help. I'm typically happy w/ a near-virginal fish prep of butter, lemon and s&p, so the creole sprinkling was a nice addition. Definitely use the sauce though - I made it w/ lite mayo and lite sour cream (no difference in taste, as far as I'm concerned) and like I said, if I call upon this recipe again, it'd be for the sauce and not the fish directives.

Wonderful recipe!  This is my favorite way to prepare tilapia.  The cajun seasoning is a nice complement to what is typically a very bland fish. I don't like mayonnaise, so I use Greek yogurt instead, no sour cream either, and just mix it w/ lemon juice, dill, & garlic powder.  Delicious!

I halved this recipe and just dusted the fillets with the cajun seasoning (I skipped the S&P. I loved the way the fresh dill sauce cut the spice of the fish. Delicious! I will definitely use this one again and again!

This was fantastic! I did pan fry the fish in a little butter and olive oil and doubled the garlic powder in the sauce because of the earilier reviews and it was the best meal I ever made. My family is always afraid to try fish because of a few disasters in the past but they all loved it, even my 7 year old daughter who only eats about 5 different foods (picky!) asked for more. Sauce is A+ - very simple but you should make it early so flavors have time to mix. I used Emerils Essence for the cajun seasoning and it was perfect.

Delicious way to get your healthy omega 3s. I make the sauce with reduced or low fat ingredients and it is still good. Everyone in the fam likes it; hubby, 2 ,4, and 7 yr old. I make it alot.

Yummy recipe, My husband loves this.  I have made this several times.  I have substituted Greek plain yogurt for the sour cream to help cut down on the fat.  Hudson thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This is a really good and really easy recipe.  I just rubbed the cajun seasoning onto the fillets with my hands, I'm sure I used more the recipe calls for.  The fish is flavorful and I didn't think the dill sauce was really necessary, but it's good to offer the option.  I will definitely make this again.

Although it's not one of my O.M.G.! Recipes, it's not bad none the less. I did pan fry the Tilapia in a little butter and olive oil and got a nice crust that way. I added just a touch of sugar to the Dill Sauce as well. Served Sauce room temp after in refrigerator for 1 hour so sauce could set and flavors could blend. The sauce tasted very similar to what you would get with a Gyro. Very simple and quick dish to make!

Great recipe!! I baked it at 400 for 10 mins and it was perfect! I used lots of cajun seasoning and thought it was fantastic. Will absolutely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this in my counter top rotisserie. It was really good. I changed the sauce. I used fat free mayonaise, dill, sweet pickle relish, onion powder and garlic powder. It made it a fat free tarter sauce, with dill.

Fish was ok....I'm not big on seafood but my husband liked the fish alot!  We weren't too thrilled with the dill sauce (I'm not big on mayo, so I made one without the mayo...I liked that one better)....good recipe over all.

This is so easy and tasty.  I had McCormicks cajun seasoning.  I just sprinkled on both sides.  I did not add salt or pepper, sliced up lemons on topped and baked.  I did try to mix up dill sauce and realized I did not have any dill, so I chopped a little onion finely and added some parsley.  It went nicely with the fix, but looking forward to using the dill next time.  This was not to hot for me, but I like spicy food. UPDATE: makes a great wrap for lunch the next day.. yum!!

I loved the recipe. I had individually frozen tilapia fillets and used them I did not have cajun seasoning in the house so in a small bowl, I mixed 1 tsp each of cumin powder, corriander powder, chilli powder and like a 3/4 tsp salt and a 3/4 tsp black pepper powder. As my husband and I are spicy food eaters it was perfect for us. I rubbed the spices on both sides of the frozen fillets and followed the rest of the recipe, same amount of cooking time with lemon and greased dish. We loved it

This is a simple and tasty recipe. The dill sauce tastes a lot like ranch dressing and would make a great veggie dip, but IMO the fish tastes better without any sauce. The sliced lemons add just the right amount of flavor and the seasoning is light and doesn't overwhelm the taste of the fish. Easy to make and healthy, too.

Spicy but not too hot - absolutely perfect baked tilapia! I liked the dill sauce a lot, but my husband preferred just the fish. This is a wonderful recipe that works well for many mild-flavored fish fillets.

We're far from being fish fans but we liked this recipe. The sauce is a definite winner! I used low fat mayo and sour cream. Will certainly make again on a busy weeknight!

This recipe is easy, quick and great!  The whole family loved it.  There were no leftovers.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated.  Fish has enough flavor that it doesn't have to be served with the dill sauce, but I made if for those who wanted it.  I was told to definately make this again.

A very simple, quick recipe. I would recommend half of the dill sauce, the whole sauce is just too much. Also, be careful not to use too much salt of cajun seasoning as the fish is mild and it will be overpowering. I loved the lemon slices baking on top, it added a lot!

I fried the fish in butter and oil as others suggested and this was great. This will sound weird but I didn't have any sour cream so I used a splash of buttermilk (which I normally wouldn't have but had bought for something else) and a small amount of vanilla yogurt. It was delicious!

I made this recipe as written until I came to the sauce. I was very disappointed to find I had no dill in the house whatsoever!  My husband jokingly suggested I chop up a dill pickle in place of the dill I didn't have. Well I thought why not?  So I finely chopped 1 dill pickle and I also added 1 tsp of pickle juice to the mayo and sour cream mixture and it was AMAZING.  Kind of like a dill pickle tartar sauce. 
We'll definitely make this again!

I felt I must thank KHUDSON3 for this incredible recipe. I had never tried Tilapia before making this recipe. Soooo good and the dill sauce was among the best I have made. In fact, I use what is left to spoon over Chicken Souvlaki the next day. now that Lent is here, it will remain in rotation for meatless Friday.

Oh my this was wonderful and so easy!  If you add any salt make it very minimal because the cajun seasoning is salty too.  I made steamed broccoli to go with it and added dill while it was cooking.  The extra sauce I had I dipped my broccoli into.  Very good sauce!

I must say...i based this rating on the sauce. ITS AMAZING and soooo easy! I didn't make the fish the way it described in the recipe. Like other reviewers, i cooked mine in half butter/half olive oil in a skillet really hot and did a nice crust on it. excellent. served with some sauteed carrots with some butter and honey and herbs. excellent.

Easy and delicious.  I'm not a big fan of fish, but I found this delightful.  The Tilapia has a good mixture of spice and citrus and the creamy dill sauce is refreshing.

I have made this several times. The Tilapia is so moist and the dill sauce is absolutely my favourite.  Also great for dipping vegetables. My husband loves it (and we are not big fish eaters)  I recently made it for company and got great raves and requests for the recipe.

I was searching for a recipe to use fresh dill when I ran across this one. It was very good. We enjoyed the sauce, but the fish was seasoned so well and was so flavorful, it would have been good even without the sauce.

I'm on Dukan Diet, so I used fat-free mayo and sub'd fat-free greek yogurt for sour cream; also, I only have dried dill weed... and this was FABULOUS over cod.  My go-to dill sauce from now on.

This recipe rocks.... your taste buds! I used tilapia, as recommended and added 3 tablespoons of green onion, 3 garlic cloves to the sauce. I also doubled the amounts of both the garlic powder and lemon juice for an extra zest, which I like. My husband and I marked this as our most fave fish recipe. Thanks Khudson3 for sharing!!

My husband loved this recipe. I used whiting fish and chili powder instead of cajun because thats what I had. It tasted delicious-- esp. the dip! Although we prefer healthier options, I would love to fry it to give it an extra crunchy kick or when im short on time. I loved plating this dish because the combo of white fish, red rub from the spices, lemon, and dill dip, is spectacular! We first eat with our eyes!

I read virtually all the reviews prior to making this.  I stuck to the recipe.  The fish was not too dry when baked (the lemons add moisture).  The salt was not overpowering with the Cajun seasoning.  And, yes, the sauce was to die for as everyone else has already stated!  The coolness of the sauce is a great counter to the Cajun seasoning.  Excellent recipe - it goes in 'the keeper' file.

This is fantastic! Personally, I prefer my fish sauteed instead of baked (I use butter spray to keep it low fat). However, cajun seasoning plus that sauce is to die for! I also use low fat mayo and sour cream - tastes perfectly normal to me. My boyfriend wants this every week now. Thanks so much for this serious keeper!

My husband is an avid fish-hater. He came to me one day & asked to make fish for dinner for him. I went with tilapia, as it is mild & is steered by the flavours you add. We all love dill & Hubba loves cajun. I make my own mayonnaise, so that was just "icing." HUGE hit, so yummy, will be making this again!

I thought the fish was good, and I thought the sauce was good... but it was not good together. The dill flavor really doesn't complement the Cajun seasoning's spices - it's like they are both completely separate and competing against each other. The sauce basically tasted like a variation of a Greek (Tzatziki) sauce. I did enjoy the flavor of the fish, so I'll probably make it again, but I won't make the sauce with it.

Great versatile sauce...  I baked at temp recommended, but ended up having to bake for a total of 25-30 minutes.  All ended up great - my 5 year old couldn't get enough!

We eat a LOT of tilapia and this is now our favorite recipe. Easy and delicious; could work with halibut, too. Only change I made was to use fresh minced garlic (instead of powdered) and about 1/2 tsp. dried dill (instead of fresh) in the sauce. And, since I don't like most commercial spice mixes I made my own cajun spice mix with garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne powder, paprika, ground black pepper, dry mustard, cumin, celery seed (just a little), dried thyme, and salt, all to personal taste. Omitted salt/pepper step in the fish prep. Thanks for this one!!

Fantastic recipe. I made fish tacos with the recipe by pan frying the tilapia and then I put the dill sauce over a cole slaw mix. I added a little dash of red pepper and creole seasoning to the dill sauce. Finally, I put everything in a flour tortilla. My family ate every last morsel.

This was very good and my children thought it was the best they ever had.  I did make some changes that didn't add to the time, but surely added to the flavor.  After I seasoned the fish on both sides, I lightly dipped them into bread crumbs and cooked them in a little olive oil over medium-high heat for about 4 minutes on each side.  Then I put into the preheated oven for only ten minutes.  I also made more of the sauce and we used it for our fish and as a dip for our asparagus. I'll make this again for sure ;o)

I am giving this an "average" review. Salt is usually the number one ingredient in Cajun seasoning. No need to add more. The sauce was okay. Everyone ate the meal but I wouldn't say they loved it and begged for more. Perhaps use a paprika seasoning instead of Cajun or at least a homemade Cajun seasoning?

Great Recipe.  One of the best baked fish recipes I have made.  It was a little salty and when I make it again, I will not use salt, just the seasoning. Very good.

I buy Tilapia at least once a month at the grocery store. I don't really care for it too much, but my husband eats it and I always try different recipes to find a way to prepare it that I like. Well this is it! This is the first time I have really enjoyed Tilapia. Great Recipe! Thanks!

5 stars for fish portion as best tilapia recipe we have tried.  Came out perfect.  I was afraid cajun would be too hot (I'm wimpy) so went light on it.  Will use more next time as just flavorful.  DH is not so much on the dill, so am working on using this sauce with a "tartar sauce" twist for his benefit.  He tried eating the cooked lemon (middles) & actually they were good...who knew?  Thanks so much for a great way to get a healthy meal in him.  Served with Yukon gold mashed with shallots from this site & a healthy salad! Wonderful. You are the tilapia master!

I thought this was very good.  I did make some adjustments, however.  Because my family dislikes mayo, I substituted plain yogurt instead.  I also added some lemon zest and MSG to the sauce.  Served with steamed fresh green beans.  Yummy!

I loved this recipe, yet needed something quicker than baking. So I got out my non-stick griddle, heated it to the temperature I wanted to cook the fish at. Then while it was heating the I prepared the fish with a rub of salt, pepper, and Old Bay Seasoning. Then I drizzled some lemon juice over the top of it. I put a little oil in my griddle and put the fish in. 6-7 minutes later and only turning the fish once, I had a perfect piece of fish. The dill sauce the only change I made was to use some chopped garlic instead of garlic powder. Turned out amazing. Thank you for this recipe. Will definitely use it again.

This was good.  I have tried other recipes for tilapia on this website that I like better.  Sauce is good. Probably won't make again.

The Cajun seasoning alone was good enough for us. We cooked the tilapia on a skillet with a bit of olive oil. The dill sauce was good but I added more lemon juice and more dill because I didn't like the mayo aftertaste it had.

This is a great recipe. We loved it. I replaced two ingredients In the sauce. Used yogurt instead of sour cream and refrigerated herb dill paste, since no fresh dill was available. Both worked beautifully.

The fish tasted good bc tilapia is not a fishy tasting fish.  I loved the dill sauce.  It reminds me of greek cucumber sauce so I used it the following night when I made falafel pitas.  Fabulous!

Amazing recipe. The coolness of the sauce evens out the heat of the fish.  I like a little more heat so I actually coat the fish fillets in the cajun seasoning; but it makes them very spicy.

What a tasty fish dish!  I substituted fat free sour cream and light mayonnaise, and I did not have fresh dill so I substituted 1 teaspoon dried which made a great tasting sauce.  I made my own cajun mix, found on http://allrecipes.com/recipe/simple-cajun-seasoning/detail.aspx   but tweaked it for my love of spicy food. I only used two fillets and baked it in my toaster oven! Great for a healthy, and QUICK, dinner.

The fish alone was amazing, but marry it with this delectable dill sauce and you have a 5-star meal! I can't wait to make this again!
Update: Maybe my spice tolerance has lessened, but I found the spices too much this go around.

Absolutely fabulous! I had to use dried dill because that's all I had, but it was still great! My husband ate 3 pieces by himself. I was out of mayo too, so used that MW salad dressing. The sauce was also good on the asparagus I served with it.

I wanted a bit more of a breading on this so I mixed my cajun seasoning with some whole wheat flour and used that to coat the fish.  I also wanted a crunchy effect so I opted to pan fry as others have suggested in oil and butter.  I mad the dill sauce earlier in the afternoon so the flavours would have time to blend.  We really enjoyed this and will be making it again!

My whole family loved this!!! The only minor changes I made where extra dill and lemon in the sauce; and a few small pats of butter around the fish. We can't wait to buy more tilapia and make it again!!!!

This was a good, easy recipe.  The dip was good, but I needed to add salt and pepper.  The kids loved the dip and enjoyed it both on their fish and as a dip for their carrots.

I always said I don't like fish.  Can't say that anymore. I LOVE this recipe.  My family asks for it every time  they visit me.  I didn't change a thing, except I didn't have fresh dill, so used dried.  Yum, Yum, Yum.

This was excellent.  I dipped the tilapia in egg and seasoned bread crumbs and sprinkled on the cajun seasoning and lemon juice then fried. Made the sauce then refrigerated for 30 min. The sauce made this dish so refreshing on a hot summer day

Wow! The sauce was amazing!!! I baked this fish according to the directions. The fish had a nice flavor with or without the sauce. However, the sauce is so delicious I wouldn't serve it without! It will also work with most fish. I will try with Salmon as well. I made this with "Orzo with Parmesan Cheese and Basil" recipe from this site as well (also amazing) and fresh roasted green beans. This is a great recipe for the summer and will be made often. I will try grilling the fish in a foil packet as well. Per another reviewer, the sauce can be used as a dip for fresh veggies which I will be using later tonight! Enjoy!

Very good. The sauce was delicious too. I put lemon juice on the fish then sprayed with Pam and added the spices. I didn't measure the Cajun seasoning, just sprinkled it on both sides of the fish and grilled it. I added a little more lemon to the sauce.

Thawed out some Fresh Tilapia. Followed the recipe with the exception of three  things.  I replaced with LIGHT MAYO, AND LIGHT SOUR CREAM.  I didn't have fresh dill, went for dried dill weed instead.  My sides were Fresh Cooked Beets, brussel sprouts, and a cucumber dressing with dill.  *****  EXCELLENT**** and very easy..

Delicious!  The fish was moist and flaky and perfectly cooked.  I used cod (that's what I had on hand), so baked it a little longer.  The cajun seasoning really makes it!  I didn't have fresh dill, so used dry, with lite mayo and fat free sour cream, and the sauce still came out well.  I would give my dill sauce four stars, but I'm sure with the fresh dill it would be five.  Husband loved it---it's our new "go to" recipe for fish.  Super easy, too!  I'll make sure to have the fresh dill on hand next time I make it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Absolutely delicious.  I didn't have any sour cream on hand, so I used yogurt.  Can't wait to try it with sour cream!

I have just recently started eating tilapia as I am not a big fish eater.  This recipe was amazing!  To those who say the fish is "bland", just season it to your liking and prepare as directed.  This recipe for me was more just a method...you can change it up however you want!  Thanks :)

Will for sure make this again, took the suggestion of others and pan fried them instead of baking.  I have an issue with mushy fish.  Dill sauce is a must but can be cut in half, makes way more than you need.

I have been searching for a copycat recipe for Logan's Santa Fe Tilapia and that led me to this recipe. My husband and I loved this dish. I went a little bit shy on the Cajun seasoning because I was afraid it would be overwhelming...I should have stuck with the recipe because it needs a good amount of seasoning. It was easy to make and didn't have a whole lot of ingredients...my kind of recipe!  My husband RAVED about the lemon and dill sauce. I made asparagus and rice and he loved the sauce so much he poured it over that too! What I actually did was I combined the mayo and sour cream and then divided that mixture in half. To one half, I added the lemon juice and dried dill (I didn't have fresh) that the recipe suggests. It was yummy! To the other half, I added lime juice and fresh cilantro...it was also yummy! I actually preferred the lime and cilantro sauce, but my hubby preferred the lemon and dill that the recipe gives.

Positively delicious!  The kick of the Cajun seasoning on the fish is the perfect counterpoint to the cool, creamy dill sauce.  I made it exactly as written, and feel no need for change; just keep in mind that ovens vary so cooking times may vary.  This one is definitely a keeper!

This is a GREAT recipe!! I used low fat sour cream, and 1 T. dried dill. Made the sauce in the morning, and by dinnertime the flavors were nicely blended. Very, very easy!! Husband loved it!!

How quick and easy! Let's not forget deilcious! I have had cajun and blackened fishes before but the sauce is the key here! I am trying to eat healthier so I subsituted low fat sour cream. I doubled the seasoning because it tasted too "mayonnaise-y", however, it didn't really need it!

Fabulous!  Used a Cajun seasoning mix from this site.  Pan seared the fish with a little olive oil and butter. Sprinkled with lemon juice as I didn't have a fresh lemon on hand.  Will make again and again.

I'll agree with another reveiwer: this tilapia seasoning was a waste of fresh fish. :( The dill sauce is nice, but then, there's not much that can go wrong with mayo and sour cream...

Tried the recipe in parts.  Kids preferred the cajun spiced.  The dill sauce version wasn't bad, but didn't wow us. Maybe I would have liked it better if I hadn't had a new potato salad with similar dressing.  I liked it a lot - with potatoes.  Still trying to find a recipe the kids will request.

Wish I could rate 3.5.  I liked the sauce, but instead of complimenting the heat/spiciness of the cajun fish, I felt like it competed with it. Almost like the creator couldn't decide whether to go fresh lemon/dill or cajun with the fish preparation.  However, the sauce went beautifully with the asparagus I served on the side. Used light mayo & sour cream and was still very nice.

My husband loves dill and requests this recipe often.  The sauce in this recipe actually gets used in other dishes, it's that good.  I have had to substitute lemon with lime and we have actually even used dried dill and it tastes almost just as good as fresh dill (just use a lot more).

This was really good. I also opted to pan fry the fish with cajun plus a few other spices.  The kids gobbled up the sauce, my youngest was practically drinking it.  Thank you!

This recipe is amazing. It's the second time that I make and thumbs up from my husband. Now, I had to change a bit the sauce for I'm not a big fan of dill so instead I made a sauce with chopped green onion, chopped garlic and garlic powder, 1/4 light mayo, 1/4 light yogurt and lemon juice. We liked a lot.

Great fish, great sauce! I used the Cajun Spice Mix recipe from this site to make the cajun seasoning -- that recipe is great, too! I'm not a fish lover and I'm looking forward to making this again. I didn't even really use too much of the sauce because I liked the fish itself so much...but I used the leftover sauce for a pita sandwich the next day.  Really, really good recipe! I will definitely make this again and again. I used a little bit of Old Bay as one reviewer suggested.  I spread a little bit of melted butter on top of the fish before I added the seasonings, and cooked the filets in a foil packet on the grill.  Lost no moisture, tasted great!

Had this for dinner this evening and really enjoyed it.  I love sauces and the dill sauce was perfect and easy to make.  I used fat free ingredients and dried dill and it was delicious!

I too passed on the baking method opting for pan searing the fish in olive oil and butter as others did, this gave it complete moisture and prevented the fish from overcooking and drying out. I also seasoned the fish with adobo then sprinkled on my own blend of cajun seasoning which basically consisted of a blend of garlic powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, cumin, coriander, thyme, chili powder). This gave it the complete "POW" an otherwise bland fish needs, and since I don't like the concept of lemon on it, I passed on that as well.  As for the sauce, the only two things I changed were: I added fresh minced garlic (which was easy, since I keep in my fridge a big container of minced garlic by Badia, and since I don't tend to keep fresh dill, I keep a jar of freeze dried dill which is just as good as fresh and I heated it up for 30 seconds in the microwave to take the "chill" out.  I served this meal with my white rice made with chicken stock (instead of water) with sauteed onions and red and green peppers, since it goes so well with seafood dishes. My husband and I absolutely loved this "gourmet" meal that certainly would have cost us a pretty penny if we had ordered it in any restaurant.

I prefer Cod to Tilapia for flavor, and always use a combo of butter and olive oil in the bottom of the pan to keep the fish from drying out. After reading reviews, I also subed plain yogart for the sour cream and Miracle Whip for the Mayo. The sause is great on asparagus broiled in EVOO!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made my own cajun seasoning based on a couple different recipes from this site and my own tastes.  The fish was actually pretty spicy and the dill sauce was the perfect complement.  I used dried dill, since that was what I had on hand (2 tsp).  I served with mashed sweet potatoes and green peas and went from fridge to table in about 40 minutes including time to find recipes and make my own seasoning blend.  Thanks for a great dinner!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I've made it twice now.  The sauce is great.  I used a combination of garlic salt and garlic powder for the sauce to give it an extra zing.  Also, the first time I made it I didn't put enough cajun seasoning on it, so don't be afraid to season it up.  Also, I layed slices of lemon and oranges on the fish while baking.  Very nice, light recipe.  Garnish it with a fresh sprig of dill and it makes a beautiful presentation!

This is a great recipe!  The only change I made was I add a bit of the sauce to the fish when there was about 3 minutes to go. Per the previous reviews the sauce was cold and made the fish cold.  Letting it cook for a few minutes didn't hurt yhe sauce at all and there was plenty left for a bowl on the table.  This was great with dried dill

Sauce was great.  Take another reviews suggestion to warm it up b/c it makes fish cold.  Didn't like the fish preparation though.  It was wet and soggy.  Would pan fry it next time so it's crunchy and holds up to the sauce.

This recipe was so easy to make; especially since we are teaching our 7 year old Brady to cook.  My husband is very picky and doesn't like to follow directions, this was pretty easy for me to shout directions across the room-lol. We did agree that the sauce should be cooked with the fish...

My husband, toddler son and I all loved this! The tilapia was cooked perfectly, and the dill sauce was fabulous. My husband said it took him back to college, when a local pizzeria served bread sticks with dill sauce. We may even just make the sauce sometime as a dip!

This is a simple recipe and it is so GOOD! I too pan fried my fish rather than baking it. I like that flavor better, I think it really made the cajun seasoning pop (I used blackened seasoning) The dip I thought at first was blah but when it sat and chilled in the fridge the dill really came out and when paired with the spice of the cajun seasoning MUAH perfect! We actually made double of the sauce just for there to be enough. Served the fish with some white rice that has some corn and poblano peppers mixed in and some stemmed asparagus. We were definitely pleased with this recipe!

This talapia was the best fish I have cooked in the oven. The lemon slices on top of the fish seemed to tenderize and hold the juices in the fish. I cooked it for 20 minutes and it was perfect. I used Old Bay seasoning, skipped the salt and pepper and put a little margarine on top of the fish before i topped with lemon slices. When I touched it with the fork, it just flaked open-perfection! Served with homemade pinto beans and cornbread and a mayo based slaw. My husband rated this one of my best dishes ever! For it to win out over beef is saying quite a lot.

This was fabulous!!  My cajun seasoning came from the "Simple Cajun Seasoning" recipe on this site (easy and very good!).  I added 1/8 tsp. salt to the sauce, and I baked the fish only 10 minutes (my fillets were pretty thin).  I left everything else the same.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

It is really too bad that 5 stars is the highest rating, because this dish was amazing. It is one of my new favorite meals. I used red pepper flakes instead of cajun seasoning, and used a lot more lemon in both the sauce and on the fish. I also threw a few onions in for flavor. The dill sauce was excellent, and I added a lot more dill, lemon, and I used low-fat mayo and fat-free sour cream, so I didn't feel as guilty when I had seconds :) Thank you for a new favorite!

Excellent. Also made this with cod. I used way more cajun seasoning than called for. Just kind of coated the fish with it. Would not use additional salt next time as the cajun seasoning was salty enough. Really quick and impressive dish!

I found that (unlike many commenters) I disliked the sour cream/dill sauce. The Cajun tilapia (I usually put Cajun spices on catfish, which is also good) was great, and I'll definately use those spices on tilapia again. It's a quick and easy recipe, but it makes way too much dill sauce. I would half it.

After reading the reviews I decided that I would spice my fish differently but use the dill sauce from this recipe. Everyone was right about the sauce...delicious!! Leftovers goes well as a veggie dip. As for the fish I used lemon juice, dill weed, lemon-pepper spice and a bit of melted butter. It was amzing. Usually I find tilapia a bit bland but this turned out wonderful.

I had to rate this before it even finished cooking because i had something similar at Red Lobster, and it was awesome (and 3x the price i could make it for!)I added our own dehydrated garlic powder to the fish and a half stick of butter before cooking. the garlic in the fish will complement the garlic in the sauce. The sauce is suprisingly different. Thank you!

This was a great and quick meal. I scaled this down for two fillets and I still had enough dill sauce to drizzle over some steamed green beans. I used dried dill and only used half the amount, worked great! It had a very fresh and summery taste. I will be sure to make this again.

The fish was decent (no complaints), the sauce was wonderful! I served with mashed potatos, black-eyed peas, and pan-fried green beans, and I ended up eating everything with a little sauce because it was so good.

Easy enough for my husband to make, once I pointed out the broiler.  =)  My stepson calls it "the fish that tastes like sausage."  Different from what I was expecting, but still good.

This recipe was okay.  The fish had too much of a lemon taste.  My family didn't care for the tarter sauce.  I might try this again, but without the tarter sauce and no lemon.

Dill sauce was nice, bot not necessarily for this fish as prepared. Would recommend it with a breaded or battered fish.

This is such an easy dish to make with lots of flavor. I've used this for sole and haddock as well! I'm dairy intolerant so I didn't put any sour cream in the dill sauce, and just added more mayo instead. It turned out delicious! It's a regular in our house now.

It was great! I didn't even make the dill sauce (for dietary reasons). I would and most likely will make this again! The leftover lemon merged with the spice, creating a delectable sauce. Be warned, some will hate on the amount of  Cajun you incorporate... do it anyway :). The Cajun seasoning makes the recipe. Thanks for a fantastic, easy, and affordable recipe!!!

I loved this recipe. It's an easy one to make and the cook time for the fish is perfect at 20 min. I added a lot more lemon to the dill sauce than what is recommended, but I love lemon! It's a delicious recipe that I will do again.

The combination of the Cajun seasoning and the cool, tangy flavors in the dill sauce work really well together in this dish. My only addition would be a squeeze of fresh lemon juice over the fish fillets before adding the spices. Everyone enjoyed! Thanks!

Great, simple recipe that shows you don't need to go out and buy really fancy ingredients to make a delicious meal! I made my own Cajun seasoning, and I think that helped as opposed to buying something high in preservatives and sodium. My Cajun seasoning had cayenne, smoked paprika, cumin, onion and garlic power. If you like spicy tilapia like we do, I honestly don't think you really need the dipping sauce. But if your tastes are more mild, the sauce is a nice complement to the kick of the fish. Excellent, easy dish!

Made this for my picky teens and husband along with roasted red potatoes and asparagus and they loved it! The seasonings I just did to taste and the sauce set the whole dish off. It was great. Will defiantly make again.

The sauce is AMAZING! Definitely needs to be warm though, in my opinion. I have made this multiple times, once I didn't have garlic powder so I used fresh garlic and it was delicious as well. :) My go-to recipe for fish, on the rare occasion that I do eat it.

Delicious and very easy to make. I used dry dill and added it generously. When I tasted the sauce, I was hesitant because it tasted sour to me but when used with the fish, it was a wonderful blend.

Absolutely delicious. I added cajun seasoning, salt and pepper liberally to both sides, and then in addition to the lemon slices, we squirted with fresh lemon juice. For the sauce, unfortunately we didn't have fresh dill. We substituted 2 TBSP fresh dill with 2 tsp dried dill weed. Came out great! We will definitely repeat this recipe, it was simple and flavorful, and the husband is in the kitchen licking the baking pan clean with an ear of corn.

Very good recipe.  The wife and I loved it.  The only thing I did different after reading othe reviews was I cooked the Fish and some Asparagus in a cast Iron Skillet in the oven at 400 Degrees.  Gave it a nice color.

I did everything per the recipe and I personally thought as did my non-fish eating spouse, that the fish was wonderful as stated in the recipe. I did not care for the sauce but my spouse loved it with one exception, she said the lemon slices sucked some of the seasoning and sauce away. So changes for next time: omit the sliced lemon, bump the lemon juice to 1-2TB, switch out mayo and sour cream for greek yogurt, if needed reduced with a little chicken stock.

This was a great way to cook fillets. I used Swai fillets instead, rubbed fillets with Old Bay seasoning, marinated them for an hour and continued with the recipe.  The sauce made the dish!  Wonderful! Definitely a keeper!

Followed recipe other than baking from frozen on a cast iron skillet and making my own cajun seasoning.  Took approximately 30 minutes from frozen.  My husband is not a fish fan and told me it was excellent and to make more often.  Thank you for sharing

This recipe was pretty good.  I'm not a fish lover but have been trying to eat healthier and incorporate different nutrional foods into my diet. My husband thought Tilapia would be a good fish to try since its not that fishy! He was right, I loved the taste of this fish with the cajun seasoning.  Normally I love dill but for some reason I wasn't feeling the sauce and neither was the hubby.  I will definitely be making this recipe again, minus the sauce!

Num, num, num!  This is just what I was looking for.  I had a taste for fish but not breaded and fried...stumbled on this and it hit the spot!  So much so, that I just ate 3 filets!  First, I whipped together the "Simple Cajun Seasoning" from this site (There was plenty for future dishes!)
I questioned at first the combination of a dill sauce with a "cajun" dish, in fact I almost skipped it but it was so easy and I just happened to buy fresh dill yesterday so I thought, "what the heck!"
It really was a nice and tasty cooling agent to the nicely spicy fish (despite the fact that I forgot the garlic powder!)
The fish itself was a breeze to whip up and it was truly tasty!  Pretty too!  I could see using this dish when entertaining!

Nothing spectacular; the sauce should be made hours before, in my opinion, to avoid the overpowering mayo flavor.

This was very good as written The people who chose to make a mess out of it are wrong. Follow the recipe, then review. Try it, you might  like it. STOP rewriting every single recipe on here. To: Mmph, what is your problem? Follow the recipe.....

We really enjoyed this recipe! I omitted the mayo and the sour cream and used greek yogurt, I didn't really measure but just tasted along the way. Super light and super easy. Will be a repeat in our house! Served with asparagus and a cold pasta salad, perfect summer meal!

Delicious recipe. I'm a beginner cook and this was simple and easy to follow and my dinner guests were impressed :) Cajun seasoning gave tilapia great flavor and the dill sauce was cool and refreshing - perfect for a summer meal.

This has become one of our favorites!  I even made my own jar of cajun seasoning to have on hand specifically for this fish!  I don't change anything but occasionally I add a little extra dill to the sauce just because we love the flavor.  My husband and I just LOVE this recipe - I am always trying new recipes and I rarely cook the same thing - exactly the same way - twice.  This is the exception - I can't count how many times I've made this exact recipe!  Love it!  If there were 10 stars I'd use them all!

Great dish! It goes perfect with the Parmesan orzo from this site (also in my recipe box). I love it for summer time and lunch. I usually don't make the dill sauce with it just because I'm lazy and it requires too many ingredients but this fish is just as great without it.

I am NOT a tilapia fan, so I used swai and it was great.  Any kind of fish would taste good with this--even trout.  It's rather like a dill tartar sauce.  I have a recipe that uses just lemon juice, mayo and Tarragon on fish that my family CRAVES, so I put a little tarragon  in this and it was incredible!!!

We thought it was wonderful. The fish turned out tender and flavorful, it was not dry at all.  The sauce was great and I will definitely try it on lots of other different types of fish.  I followed the recipe to a T. I used butter to lightly grease the baking dish prior to putting the fish in.  I doubt I used a whole tbsp of cajun seasoning... I pretty much just heavily sprinkled it on.  Will add this to our regular family favorites and cook it at least once a month as we eat Tilapia quite frequently. Thanks for the recipe!

Three kids, ages 5, 7 and 9 all gave this "two thumbs" up! That's say a ton when it comes to serving them fish! My husband loved it as did I. Definitely make the sauce, it's a wonderful compliment.

The only add I can contribute is to use fresh fillets and not frozen. You can definitely taste the difference!

This recipe is so easy and so good I can't believe it.  I didn't have sour cream so I used heavy whipping cream and it was delicious.  I also used lime instead of lemon.  I will be making this again!

Dill sauce is great. Did not have any cajun seasoning on hand so used garlic powder and salt and pepper for seasoning along with covering tilapia with thinly sliced lemons covering all the fish so it does not dry out. Will use cajun seasoning next time.

These are great and so easy.  I brushed with olive oil first before rubbing on the Cajun seasoning which I only bothered putting on one side.  I didn't use salt and pepper since the seasoning is salty and peppery already.  The family liked it a lot, even my 9 year old, who has not liked any other ways I've prepared tilapia.  The sauce is great.

I wasn't sure about cooking tilapia but after reading the reviews, I had to try this recipe. It was delicious, and i will definitely make it again.

I made this recipe with steamed asparagus and seasoned wild rice...I was underwhelmed.  I think the proportions are off with the sauce.  Next time I will tinker a bit to see if that helps.

I made this tonight and it was a BIG hit with the WHOLE family including my 2 year old. I did however make a few very small changes. I did not use salt, I did garlic salt with parsley, pepper, and new orleans cajun seasoning. I also dipped them in butter prior to seasoning them. I put them in the over in little individual foil packs at 415 for 15 minutes and they were PERFECT.

This is a great recipe! We've been trying to eat more fish so I've been scoping out AllRecipes for ideas and found this. My husband just raved, although I overdid it just a little with the cajun seasoning. Will go a little easier next time. Served with brown rice and sauteed spinach. I also used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream for the dill sauce. Will definitely stick with that, too! It was absolutely delicious! My husband went on and on about the dill sauce.  This one's a keeper!

yum yum! My Suggestions for sauce:

(1.)Make the DILL SAUCE ahead of time to seal in flavors
(2.)Use 4 TBL of fresh dill instead of 2

*Suggestions for Fish*
(1.)After seasoning with s&p & cajun - dip filet in flour (just a little not too much)
(2.) preheat EVOO & 1 TBL Butter on Med-High
(3.) Fish will get nice and crispy edges!! YUM

I love the combo between the crunchy spiciness of the fish and the sweet dill sauce. I also highly recommend you make this with ASPARAGUS. You will dip the veggies in the sauce as well.

This was phenomenol! My boyfriends exact words! I followed the recipe exactly but only made two filets. I used the vacuum sealed frozen tilapia filets and just thawed them in the fridge that morning and two nights later we had the dish again since there so much left over dill sauce which was also great on our broccoli! I might try this agian making the healthier version of the sausce but this recipe is hands down pure perfection! Thank you for the new favorite at our house!

This was absolutely delicious.  I saw a few comments on here about it being too salty and didn't think much of it because I wasn't going to add any salt at all.  However, mine came out salty.  Cajun seasoning, like Tony Chachere's, actually have a lot of salt in them themselves.  So, keep that in mind when seasoning.  However, you can find no salt added Cajun seasoning and I think that would be great!

I used lemon juice instead of lemon slices. I think I will try pan-frying next time. The dill sauce was excellent, but I think I'll cut the mayo and sour cream with non-fat, plain yogurt.

I subbed plain yogurt for the mayo and the sauce was really good. I pan fried the tilapia and omitted the cajun spice. The sauce is great with grilled salmon also.

Excellent! I did not change a thing and this dish was exceptionally good, especially with the refreshing dill sauce. I was very generous with the cajun seasoning, and it came out very tasty. My son who is not particularly fond of fish, loved it, he even asked for seconds. I served this dish with "California Cole Slaw" and some leftover pasta salad. It was a perfect 10!

I tripled the dill sauce since everyone talked about how wonderful it was. I now have enough for a superbowl party!  This was a very simple recipe and the three adjectives to describe the results 1)Flavorful 2)Tangy 3) light. | I combined the sale, pepper and cajun into a bowl first before seasoning the tilapia to even out the amounts. Served with grilled asparagus the meal was delicious. I'd like to hear what others serve with this dish to give more options as sides. Most def will make this again.

The baked talapia is fabulously moist due to the thin slices of lemon placed on top of each fillet during baking... But because I am a healthnut and don't touch sour cream or mayo (or salad dressings of any kind), I used 3/4 cup plain Greek yogurt instead.  healthy and tasty!  Thank you.  (Use olive oil to coat your pans).  And because there are only two of us, we had the other two fillets (leftovers) the next night...which tasted exactly like they were just baked!

Just made this for dinner and used the advise of using plain yogurt in place of sour cream, it was a fraction of the cost which is always nice! The fish was fried since I don't like  heating up the house. The sauce and the fish were superb, even my b.f. who doesn't like dill loved it which tells me this recipe is a keeper. Thank you Hudson

Just made this for dinner tonight!  It was so easy and so delicious.  The only change I made was to cook in a skillet as others had suggested and I used low fat mayo and low fat sour cream for the sauce.  Served along side green beans and it was a perfect meal.  Will definitely be making this again!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I made it on top of the stove instead of the oven.  It is so simple to make.  I have made this with the sauce and without the sauce.  It tastes great either way.

This was really yummy and I would make it again.  My 5-year old scarfed it down and my 3-year old took a few bites, though I used less spicy herbs on the kid's portions.  I followed the recipe exactly, for the husband and I, and served with simple spinach and  traditional scalloped potatoes.  I'm not giving this dish a 5-star rating, only because I have even more favorite recipes for tilapia.  This one is still a keeper though.  Thanks KHUDSON3!

I give it a 4 1/2 .  It was so good, I made it exactly as the recipe says.  My DH is North fishing ,and I know I will have the usual fish stories.   I've looked at Tilapia in the the market and didn't buy it because I was doubtful as to how good it would be.   Sooo, this was my chance.  I loved it!  I  am anxious to serve him this recipe. I know he will  like it very much.   Yummm.

Wow this was excellent.  I did use lemon pepper instead of the Cajun seasoning because I didnt have any, and I didnt find the old bay until later.  I added some fresh cracked pepper and some old bay to the sauce.  Other than that I stuck to the recipe. Next time I'll try old bay on the fish.

I did change the cooking method to just frying the fish in a little butter and olive oil. Amazing. The dill sauce was a hit even with my one picky kid. This is our new favorite way to eat fish! No more heavy tarter sauce for me!!

Yummy!  I used fat free sour cream and low fat mayo.  Fresh dill is a must!  I also added a few capers to the dressing.  My five year old loved it!

This recipe was fast and easy.  My hubby made it, but didn't put on all the seasoning it called for, for fear that it would be overbearing(for out 2 year old)  Next time I will make sure the required seasoning is used.  Also, we used lime juice opposed to lemon(it's what we had on hand) The "dip" was great, I'll probably make it to use with other dishes too:)

My husband is the seafood lover in our household.  I'm more of a chicken kind of gal.  I've been trying to cook a little healthier and become a little more adventurous in my cooking experiments as of late.  This recipe was amazing!  Turns out, Tilapia isn't all that bad a fish!  I made double the dill sauce and used it for some simply steamed asparagus (love the ziplock steamer bags).  My husband and I loved it and my friend at work demanded the recipe when I shared the leftovers for my lunch the next day!  Thanks!

Tilapia had good flavor, I thought that the lemon slices sitting on the fish while cooking made the fish a little watery.  I might cut down on amount of lemon next time (I used 2 slices per fillet this time) or else just squeeze fresh lemon on this after baking.  Maybe my fish was just watery to start with - although I used fresh, not frozen so would not have expected it to be watery.

This recipe is awesome!!!!!! My husband wants me to add this to our weekly menu. The only thing I did differently was season the fish with pepper and garlic powder along with the cajun seasoning. I also fried the tilapia in a skillet with olive oil and butter. The dill sauce needed no tweeking......

Excellent!!  We have made this several times and is has been added as a favorite that we have at least once a month.  We LOVE the Dill Sauce!!  The Dill Sauce goes great with lots of things.  We use it with sweet potato rounds - the recipe for the rounds can be found http://www.doctoroz.com/ - quick, easy and tasty plus healthy.

This was the first time I've tried tilapia and I didn't care for the fish itself, however, I liked this recipe and the dill sauce was great.  I used the Creole Seasoning recipe from this site to season the fish.  I served it with rice, which I cooked in chicken broth and seasoned with Epicure's sundried tomato seasoning.  The next time I make this I will use sole or haddock instead of tilapia.

Fantastic!  Very simple too.  I didn't have any lemons but I sprinkled a little lemon juice on each fillet.  The sauce was the best and it complimented the fish very well.  Can't wait to make again.  Thanks!

Fast to make and an instant hit with my family. The dill sauce was delicious. I did have to cook the fish a bit longer and next time I think I'll listen to the other reviewers and pan fry it instead.

This was a delicious and easy way to make fish. The tilapia is mild tasting (not too fishy tasting) and the cajun seasoning gives it just the right amount of kick. The dill sauce is to die for. I'm trying to broaden my horizons by cooking fish more often as a healthy alternative to beef or chicken. I will definitely make this again!

Very good.  The sauce was a nice addition.  I probably will go a little heavier on the cajun seasoning the next time.  I was a little timid about how the cajun flavor would go along with the dill in the sauce, but it tasted very good.

Mmm.  Delicious!  the fish itself is fine, and I'm good with the baking method.  It's how we bake salmon as well.  The dill sauce, however, is what makes this recipe a 5 star.  The taste is wonderful and goes so well with the tilapia and the cajun seasoning.  I think I will experiment with the fish--maybe try old bay or lemon pepper next time, but the dill sauce doesn't need a thing added or subtracted.   I don't have lemons so I used lemon juice and poured on the fish, then rubbed in olive oil, then rubbed in the cajun seasoning.  It worked perfectly.  And if you get a bit too much seasoning on one filet, which I did, the dill sauce cools it down.  Perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is an excellent recipe, but I added my own spin. I didnt have any sour cream,so i found a substitute on the internet,which was 6oz (12tbsp)of cream cheese and 3tbsp of milk that i mixed in the blender. That amounted to 3/4 cup, so I reduced the mayo to 1/8 cup (i dont like too much mayo in sauces/dips anyway). FABULOUS sauce it turned out to be. As far as the tilapia,its one of the blandest fish out there unless you really season it, so my version of seasoning was the Cajun seasoning,but I also lightly added garlic salt, cracked black pepper, Old Bay, oregano, and lemon pepper. I also took the advice from a previous poster to add butter to the top of the fish for moisture retention, so I had some garlic butter on hand and smeared a little bit all over the top of each fish. It came out perfect, and my boyfriend said it was the BEST TILAPIA HE'S EVER HAD (he previously didnt like this fish) !!! Thank you so much for this starter recipe!

We had never tried Tilapia before we tried this recipe, both my husband and I loved it and I have made it 3 times in the past month.  I don't change a thing except when I fry it I use a little butter.  It is so easy and delicious.

I thought this recipe was fantastic. I took the advice of others and pan seared the fish. It was fantastic with the dill sauce. I will make it over and over again.

I made this last night and it was great. I pan seared it in my cast iron skillet first, then finished baking it in the oven.  Served with the sauce and it was wonderful.  My husband even liked it and he isn't a big "baked" fish person

My grocery store was out of fresh dill so I used dry dill weed thats in the seasoning aisle, and turned out great! Used the same amount, no adjustment neccesary.  Fish was too spicy, but the directions said season to taste so Ill just adjust that next time.  Like everyone else said- the sauce is amazing, I make this for veggies and crackers and all sorts of other dishes!

Did the fish on the BBQ because it was so nice outside, which tasted great. The sauce was awesome too, I've been making it ever since to serve with fresh veggies and even as a salad dressing - thanks a lot for a super recipe!

Good basic tilapia recipe. The dill sauce was a nice complement to the fish, but I expected a lot more considering the rave reviews. I will probably make this again, as it was quick and easy. Thanks!

It was really a delicious dinner that we had when I prepared this Hudson's Baked Tilapia with Dill Sauce. I wasn't able to find dill in the store so I used basil instead. Another thing, I substitute the sour cream with cream cheese and lemon. It was a great dinner for my husband and me.

I thought I wouldn't like this much, as the Cajun spice is a bit hot for my taste, but decided to make it, as my husband likes some heat.  I was surprised at how much I liked it.  The dill sauce was this perfect complement to the Cajun spice.  I will definitely make this again.

The dill sauce was just amazing. it really dressed up the tilapia and everything was so quick and easy to make. I gave 5 stars because of the sauce and ease of preparation! Definitely add this one to your box for a quick go-to meal.

Very good.  We have had it twice now and it is a hit with my husband and I.  A bit spicy for the four year old but  am sure as she gets older she will like it as well.  We will definitely make it again and again.

I ended up frying my fish (both tilapia and walleye) in a pan after sprinkling the fillets with lemon juice and then seasoning them.  Using the recommended amount of cajun was a little too much for my 4 y.o.  I obmitted the salt and could see where adding any would make the fish too salty.  I warmed up the sauce a little and it was okay with the fish but nothing too super special.  I'll probably end up using it on vegetables.

Really good.  Instead of baking, I sealed them in foil and cooked them on the grill.  The Cajun seasoning makes a nice yummy crust, well received by the family.

The dill sauce was fabulous!  I followed the sauce recipe exactly.  I made extra and used the left overs as a spread on sandwiches.  I didn't have cayenne pepper so I improvised (so much so that I can't remember what I did) and it still worked well with the fish!  This is a new favorite!  Thanks!

Just got done making this for dinner tonight.  DH gives it the 5 stars as I do not eat spicy stuff.  But he absolutely LOVED the dill sauce.  I used 1 T. dried dill as that is what I had on hand.  Plus played a little bit with the cajun rub and added about a 1/2 teas of smoky paprika to it to get a little smoke flavoring going.  Excellent recipe.  I also had some homemade tartar sauce already made and had DH try both and he much preferred the dill sauce from this recipe.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

The fish was overly salty (maybe it was the brand of cajun seasoning I used?), but the sauce is AMAZING.  I serve it with just about every type of fish I cook now.

Fast, easy, and delicious!  The fresh lemon slices on top are great. I like baked fish recipies to cut down on the fat and frying mess. I did cut mayo and sour cream amounts in half and used low fat. Will be making this regularly and will try with other types of fish, too.

Glad I stumbled on this recipe! The cajun seasoning pairs oh so nice with the dill sauce. Excellent flavors working here! I fried the tilapia in olive oil and 1Tbs of butter instead of baking and it was fantastic, juicy, and flaky. The Man and the 4 Kids raved and scarfed all seven filets! No leftovers here.

I figured out how to make this fish maintain moisture:  First, I marinated it in white wine (sav blanc, Charles Shaw) and lemon juice for several hours before hand. Then, I put a small butter pat under each piece of fish in a pyrex cassarole dish.  Then, I drizzled the fish with olive oil before rubbing the spices on.   Not only was it moist, it was also burst with wine flavor..   This was seriously the best tilapia I've ever had. Thank you for the recipe!

I made this recipe twice. The first time I used tilapia. I cooked it with the same seasonings as the recipe in a frying pan in butter and olive oil as others had suggested. The flavor and texture were okay. I mixed all the ingredients for the sauce together, and then I realized I didn't have dill. Uh oh. I searched online for dill substitutes but found none. We ate the sauce without the dill, and it was nothing special. Since I had leftover sauce, I bought dill and decided to try the recipe again. BIG DIFFERENCE! It was so delicious! My husband loved it too. By the way, I used plain whole milk creamline yogurt (available at Trader Joe)  instead of sour cream. I substitute this yogurt for sour cream in just about every recipe. Nobody can ever tell the difference! The fish also came out MUCH BETTER the second time around. However, the second time I used sole instead of tilapia. Both times the fish was frozen, so maybe the tilapia was older than the sole? Also, the sole slices were thinner. My husband and I both LOVED the meal the second time. We ate it with asapragus and whole wheat couscous (available at Trader Joe) on the side. I will definitely make this again.

This was EXCELLENT... but I'm only giving it 4 stars because I did change the cooking procedure from baking to pan cooking in a bit of olive oil.... mainly because I was too lazy to empty my oven of baking pans.  I used Zatarain creole seasoning... which is quite spicy to me... but has salt, pepper etc in it... so a light sprinkle on both sides of the fish did fine for us (kids included).  If it were just me and my husband, I would have gone heavier... not to blackened stage... but just about double it to really get a taste of the seasoning.  Really, as other people said, the fish is nothing too special without the sauce.... BUT... I see this as the fish and the sauce actually being both very important parts of the recipe... you can't do one with the other... really, you DO need to make the sauce as a part of the recipe.  Use reduced fat components if you want... but really, without it, the fish is just pan or oven cooked fish....which is fine of course... but the sauce just makes it pop.

We really thought this recipe was only "okay."  The dip and the fish were both good alone, but we didn't think they worked together all that well.  I am going to try the leftover dip on a wrap tomorrow, but unfortunately, I don't think I am going to be making this one again.

This recipe was very tasty. I didn't have sour cream so I used plain yogurt but it still tasted great. I also adjusted the cooking time. It barely needed 12 minutes. Cooking tilapia too long makes it rubbery and chewy.

This was the best tilapia I've ever had. I didn't bake it - for fear of it drying out (I hate dry fish). I seasoned with salt and pepper and pan-seared on the stove with margarine and a little EVOO. It turned out fantastic. I forgot to use the cajun seasoning! Now the sauce - I'm not understanding the rave reviews. I read, and re-read the recipe to make sure I'd done it right but it was nothing spectacular. I even had to add more garlic powder, more lemon juice and a little red pepper just so it wouldn't be blah. My husband like the sauce - so to each his own...but the fish was great!

Coated talapia with cajon seasoning, and pan fried in a little EVOO topped with sauce and it was EXCELENT.  Other than the method of cooking the fish I changed nothing...very good!

This is such a fantastic dish! Light and flavorful, it's perfect for any occasion, especially after a long day. Super easy to make and such a reward when it all comes together. I used cayenne pepper instead of cajun, but it's in the same family, and it tasted great. Yum!

This was fabulous!  I love the blend of spices and t sauce.  I made my own cajun spice blend with garlic powder, onion powder, nutmeg, pepper, parsley, cayenne pepper and chili powder.  I sprinkled a little bit of each on the fish.  Delicious!

The sauce really is fantastic - it tastes like the dill sauce you usually find with cucumber appetizers but is a bit less dense. I wish I had made a double batch to dip fresh veggies in! As for the fish, I didn't have lemon wedges or cajun seasoning, so I used lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and garlic salt.

This was delicious and so easy!  I didn't have cajun seasoning so I used adobo and chili powder.  I also used fat free sour cream and low fat mayo to make it healthier.  Served with steamed broccoli and sweet potatoes.

I liked the recipe. I did change the sour cream for non fat yogurt, and that worked really well. I didn't have lemon either, so used lemon garlic seasoning for a bit of that lemon flavor.
I had no problems with the recipe, just felt that it was healthier using the non fat yogurt and a low fat mayo.
Will make again. Esp. the Dill Sauce!

Delicious the fresh dill made the sauce exquisite. I substituted the garlic powder with fresh garlic, i love freshness!
The fish was juicy and not fishy at all!

The sauce for this serving size should be cut in half, but was still excellent!

This recipe was so easy and tasty! I also pan-fried the tilapia, which made this whole recipe take about 20 minutes from start to finish. My family loves cajun spices, and the dill sauce was unexpectedly refreshing.  Next time I make this, I will make the fish spicier, so the dill sauce is a better addition

The dill sauce is absolutely delicious, and complements the fish perfectly. The recipe makes WAY too much of it though - next time, I will halve it. You need to keep an eye on the fish - my fillets were pretty thin, and were done in about 12 minutes. Thanks!

My husband claims to dislike seafood, however this is the third seafood dish in 2 weeks that I've gotten him to try. I have to say that the name did help me in getting him to try it as he's also a Hudson! He enjoyed the fish in spite of the name, and even said he would eat it again. The dill sauce complimented the spicy fish perfectly. I used the Creole Seasoning Blend recipe from this site for the fish and liberally dusted both sides.

This was really good!  I brushed the fish with melted butter and added some coarse ground black pepper, crushed red pepper and parlsey.  I baked it for 25 minutes and it was perfect.  I added 1/2 tsp. cajun spice and 1/4 tsp. cayenne to the dill (used 1 tsp. dried dill) sauce for added kick.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I REALLY wanted to like this. The only reason I gave this a 3 star instead if a 2 star is because I'm pretty sure the reason I didn't like it was that I used Lousiana Style Cajun Seasoning and it had a very weird taste to it.

I might make this again with a different kind of seasoning as well as putting some lemon juice on the fish before baking. The dill sauce was okay but not a fave.

My family loved it. I used creole and blackened seasoning instead of s/p and cajun and as suggested added more lemon and dill to the sauce. It was a great combination with fish as well as great with asparaguss and i served with a sundried tomato rice. I will be making this again for company. Thanks

This dill sauce was AMAZING, I LOVE IT!!!

I followed the recipe exactly (except instead of garlic powder I used fresh garlic, I used a garlic press and probably 3 - 4 cloves of garlic).

I used tilapia and found the dill sauce went great with it.  We ate the fish with green beans and rice pilaf.

The dill sauce can definitely be used for many other things and as a dip.  I have since tried this same recipe using cod and it was delicious.  My husband loves it too!  Good stuff!

This dish was great!  My husband and I don't eat usually eat fish, because we're not a big fan of the taste, but this was delicious.  If you don't like fishy fish, but are trying to be healthy and would like to incorporate fish into your diet this is the recipe for you.

Wonderful!!! Tasted so fresh and soooo good! I am already craving this again. 

I used frozen filets of Tilapia from Costco or Sam's Club. I did the dill sauce with Light Mayo and Low Fat Sour Cream. So quick and so easy!

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out well.  I wouldn't change a thing about it.  I served with steamed broccoli with the extra dill sauce. (I did need to increase the baking time, but thats typical with my oven)

This sauce is amazing and it paired well with the spicy fish.  I will definately be making this sauce again!

We also had artichokes for dinner with the fish and dipping the leaves in the dill sauce was also incredibly good!  I would imagine it is perfect over asparagus as well!

Delicious!... I would have given 5 stars, but I only had salmon in the freezer... probably just as good with tilapia. I didn't have cajun seasoning, so I seasoned with garlic salt, pepper, paprika and cayenne pepper.  Even my 12 year old liked it with the dill sauce!

Great way to change up a seafood dish. I didn't have dill, so I mixed Italian herbs. Mixed the leftover mayo/sour cream mixture with spinach and ate is as a dip. A+

My family loved this recipe!  We have been trying to incorporate fish into our weekly menu and this is it!  I didn't care for the dill sauce on the fish as I felt it took away from the flavor though I do think the sauce by itself is wonderful!  My kids however, loved the dill sauce and poured it right on top of their fish.  This is a great family meal!

Wow! This was recipe was so delicious and easy! Definitely a keeper as the the ingredients are items I usually have on hand.  For the sauce, I did use what I had in the fridge, which was Vegenaise and no-fat sour cream, but it came out with a great consistency. As others said, the sauce is also great for dipping fresh veggies.

The recipe was fantastic but I did tweak it a bit. I pan sauteed the tilapia with butter, a touch of hot sauce and used Paul Prudomme poultry magic instead of cajun seasoning. The dill sauce was outstanding and it really added a nice cooling flavor to the spicy fish!

It was okay, I wouldn't make it again.  I didn't find it to be very flavourful and my husband and 2 kids didn't like it at all.  It's not that I thought it was bad, but I would like the fish with white wine and lemon juice only just as much.

Not the best. I used cod which I think added to the blandness of the dish. The sauce was a bit thin and in its reciped state it was bland. Season with dill & lemon to taste.

We loved this dish!  It was easy, yet made me feel I was making a gourmet meal for pennies.  I made it with asparagus, and the sauce was great for dipping.  (I even ate the leftovers with chips.)  I'll definitely make it again, but this time with fresh dill (I only had dried) and using far less of the seasonings on the fish.  VERY GOOD.

This was good and incredibly easy to make.  I had to add more dill to suit my tastes but overall we enjoyed it.  I think next time I make it I won't bother with the added expense of fresh dill as I think dried would work just fine for this dish.

This was really great!  I sprinkled bottled lemon juice on the fish since I didn't have fresh lemons, and used reduced fat sour cream & mayonnaise, plus maybe 1/2 the amount of dried dill since I didn't have fresh.  I also used frozen tilapia fillets which are great to keep on hand for this quick meal.  I'm sure it would only be better using all fresh ingredients.  The cool sauce is the perfect compliment to the mildly spicy fish, and is great with cucumber as well.  This is easily multiplied to feed more people.  A family favorite and especially nice in the summer!

Dill sauce was good.  I used low-fat yogurt instead of sour cream.  And increased the amount of lemon and garlic.  The fish was ok, just baked fish with some spice.  Probably won't make again, but only because of the kids and hubby.  I enjoyed it.

I love the dill sauce. To be honest we don't use the fish recipe, not because it's not good, but we prepare our fish differently, but we ALWAYS have the dill sauce whenever we have fish these days.

Very quick and easy.  I used the individually wrapped Tilapia from Sam's Club and it turned out really good.  I sprayed the dish with oil before putting in the fish though - seems like it would stick otherwise.  I wish I would have used a little more lemon slices like she said.

this was a nice mix of spice and cool dill.  I cooked the fish less time, I like my fish moist.  I will try to make a little extra sauce for the rice.

Pretty good.....the sauce is really what makes this recipe stand-out.  My family likes the fish better with the sauce, as opposed to without.  I did add more garlic powder and had to use dried dill.  But, over all , I will make this again.

I made this fish tonight for dinner and we really liked it.  I followed the recipe for the fish exactly, but my DH made the sauce and he changed things slightly.  He added more garlic and almost tripled the amount fresh lemon juice and dill (our dill may have been a bit old).  In the end, we really liked this and will likely make this dish again.

The fish was really good. I love tilapia and I cook it often. The sauce was mediocre. I tried to jazz it up a bit but it was still just okkkk.

Not my favorite fish dish that I have ever made, but very good and very EASY.  I will make it again.  I used crushed garlic in the sauce instead of garlic powder.

I loved the dill sauce. To cut down on the fat, I substituted yogurt for the sour cream... also tastes good as a chip dip.

I feared making the fish too salty, so I skipped the salt and went light on the Cajun seasoning, but then the fish lacked flavor.  It was OK, but not one my family wants me to make again.

My entire family finished their meal and asked for more. My Husband said I should make this fish more often.
I didn't have lemon wedges so I used the lemon juice from the container to sprinkle the fish, and I didn't have dill so I used the salad seasoning to sprinlr over. Thanks for a great recipe

I made this last night with a few changes, but it was still delicious! I used the dried dill weed instead of fresh in the sauce. I also didn't have any Cajun seasoning so I sprinkled red pepper flakes on the fish. I will definitely make this again!

Delicious! We used rock bass that was freshly caught by a neighbor, and the timing was perfect (though we cooked longer, for a total of 25 minutes). Make sure not to scrimp on the dill! We served with broccoli and roasted potatoes, very healthy, filling and delish!

Followed the directions quite closely.  Used Spiceology Cajun rub.  Used non-fat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and dry dill weed since I had no fresh.  Served with brown basmati rice and salad.  Wine was Viognier.

Dill sauce was excellent. I found that at 350, the fish - which was tasty - needed almost 30 minutes to bake.

The only recipe I have found where I get my husband to eat fish.  Delicious and fairly easy to prepare.  No adjustments needed on the recipe other than doing half the quantity on the dill dip.  We always have left over even by cutting it in half.  Thanks for sharing this awesome dish.

It was a very nice sauce.  I substituted fresh clove of pressed garlic for the garlic powder and next would use a little less sour cream and a little more mayo.  A dash of salt helped as well. Served it with Dover Sole not Tilapia

The sauce is the best part! We dipped our bread rolls in the extra sauce, and it was delicious. I accidentally used very thick slices of lemon on top of the fish, but it turned out fine. We were also very generous with the Cajun seasoning (prepared from a different recipe), but were light on the salt and pepper. Overall, the recipe is super easy and pretty tasty.

Trying to get back to some home cooked meals after a summer of eating out. This recipe lives up to the hype. Followed the recipe except pan fried the tilapia before finishing off in the oven and added a sprinkle of garlic salt to the sauce. Seriously yummy.

My DH thawed out some Tilapia (that I was not thrilled with),so I went in search of a recipe because I was tired of plain ole baked fish.  This recipe knocked it out of the park! I used the Simple Cajun Seasoning from this website and I was not disappointed. This will be a regular in our house.

Made this for dinner yesterday. I fried it in a pan with a little olive oil and squeezed lemon juice on top when done. ‘‘This was an amazing dish. The dill sauce was killer. I could eat it with a spoon. My family who really don’t care for fish gobbled it up. Thanks for sharing this recipe. Will go in my regular rotation.

This was a lovely fish recipe... I used sole instead of tilapia and I omitted the sour cream for non-dairy reasons and not a bit was left of the sauce; everyone loved it. I served it with green beans and cauliflower rice for a perfect healthy meal. Next time I'll add a little more cajun to make it a bit spicier.

Love this dish. Tilapia turned out moist and flakey. The dill sauce baked in nicely.  So delicious!

Simple preparation with good dill sauce.  I needed to bake 17-18 minutes. I didn't have Cajun seasoning, so I substituted cayenne red pepper and garlic salt.

Simple and delicious --- I even use the dill sauce with other dishes.  It's fresh and very tasty.  As for cooking the fish, we  omitted the slices of lemon & used fresh lemon juice; added a sprinkle of  our go-to shredded 3-cheese blend (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago cheeses) and baked it first. Then flipped it to broil to crisp it a bit.  It came out Great....one of our new favorites.

I have made this once before and the fish was amazing as well as the sauce. I did put a pat of butter on top of each filet while baking. I am making this fish again tonight. So simple and flavorful. The only difference is I am not making the dill sauce. The last time I had some leftover sauce and used it for some fried pickles and it was amazing. I love the sauce but  I think the fish can stand on it's own and my husband agrees.

My husband and I prep a week of meals on Sundays. I made this fish exactly as it was written, but didn't make the sauce because I was out of mayonnaise.  When finished cooking, I put the tilapia in a container and left the lemon on top. After being in the fridge and reheating, this was DELICIOUS!!  Even without the sauce. It was perfectly tender and tasted of lemon.  Loved it!

My family loved this! My daughter said the sauce reminded her of a restaurant sauce. I need to limit salt, so used Mrs. Dash  Original and Fiesta Lime on the fish. The sauce made the dinner great. I will make it again!

This was my first time making and eating Tilapia. It came out perfect. The sauce is amazing but I did use more lemon juice (half a lemons worth) and used about a teaspoon of garlic powder. I also subbed Greek yogurt for the sour cream. I baked mine as stated for 20 mins, then I turned the broiler on for about 5-7 minutes. I will be making this again and again.

I made this recipe too. I cooked the fish on the stove instead. I used butter and olive oil. My suggestion is to make the sauce a day ahead or 8 hours ahead at the least.

I've made this dish twice and I am in agreement with other reviewers that the dill sauce makes the recipe; it complements the seasonings so well. But the amount of sauce is too much for only four fillets; cut the sauce recipe in half.  FYI, I subbed plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream with great results. Also think a bit of lemon squuzed over the fish before serving would be beneficial.

Really conflicted about giving five stars, only because the recipe is so simple! But non-fish-lovers in my family eat this right up. Definitely make the sauce. Since Cajun seasoning is too spicy for some in my family (but perfect for me), we've tried it with lemon pepper seasoning as well with good results. I think Lawrys season salt will be next. Thanks for sharing such a tasty, easy recipe!

Just average for my family, as stated in other reviews it's the Dill sauce that makes the dish.  So I will keep this recipe to keep the dill sauce mixture.

This was absolutely fabulous.  We used frozen Tilapia and it was still fantastic.  We followed the directions for the spices, put lemons on each side of the filet, wrapped it in tin foil and put the fish on the grill.  It was very tender and flavorful.  The dill sauce was also excellent.  I used the left over as a dip for vegetables, and it went really well!

Had good intentions of following the recipe but lacked some things ... dusted the fish with Cajun spice (one side only just to make sure it wasn't too spicy), added a little bit of lemon juice (instead of lemons) and baked for 25 minutes.  For the sauce, we were out of sour cream so I used light cream cheese with the mayo and fresh dill.  Fish was good, will add more Cajun spice next time because I barely noticed the flavor.  The dill sauce makes this dish amazing.

My review is for the dill sauce only.  I'll have to try the fish portion of this recipe one day soon.  The sauce  was very good!  Both Hubs and I agreed, it’s a definite “do again!”  I ran to the store to get fresh dill because I knew it would be so much better with fresh, rather than dried.  I made half the recipe as written and the only change I would make next time is to try fresh minced garlic instead of dry.  I agree with other reviewers who said to make this at least a few hours ahead to allow the flavors to meld, and serve it at room temperature.  This sauce makes we want to have fish again later this week!  YUM!

Everyone ate this fish, but it was on the bland side. I don't think we'll make this again. If you do go for it, definitely make the sauce; it was the saving grace.

I made this for my grand daughter and I.  She is not a lover of baked fish, but this she loved.  Followed the directions only thing I left out was cajun seasoning because we don't care for it.  Replaced with seasoning herb.  It turned out delicious.  Thanks for this receipt.

really liked this fish.  I did fry it instead of bake.  And I just sprinkled the Cajun seasoning on as well as a few more  (old bay, red pepper, garlic salt instead of garlic).  The dill sauce was great, using light mayo and light sour cream. Next time will try it as written (baked) and want to try it on the grill too.  Thanks for the recipe.  I've never been good at making fish and this is one we would definitely eat again.

My family loved this!  I had one filet left over and had it for lunch the next day...the Cajun seasoning and lemon was even more flavorful.  A great combination of flavors all together.  A definite keeper recipe!

Soooo Good!!! I didn't  use the salt or the sliced lemons. I just sprinkled the fish with lemon juice that I had on hand. I did cover the fish with foil before baking,  came out very moist. The sauce was great with it. I doubled the dill and garlic powder (because my daughter and I love it).

This will be my go-to recipe for tilapia. BIG hit with my husband. I did make a few tweaks. We don't really like baked fish, so I took the advice of others and pan-fried it in a little butter and olive oil. I used the same seasonings, but dredging it in Panko crumbs gave it the crispness we like. The sauce is the best ever! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This was delicious!! I pan fried the tilapia in butter and oil instead of baking and doubled the recipe for the sauce so i could have lots leftover!! Served with roasted potatoes and asparagus. The sauce was soooo good with the fish, looking foward to leftovers. I dont really like tartar sauce but this sauce is fantastic!! Im even thinking to use it for a veggie dip!! Will make this again for sure.

We had this tonight and loved it, in part because it was different from our normal tilapia recipes.  I didn't add garlic to the sauce as our Cajun blend is kind of heavy on the garlic.  Unlike some reviewers, I liked the fish without bread topping.  We had this with another All Recipes recipe tonight - Pasta with Asparagus (and mushrooms) with Cajun seasoning added.  The flavors really complimented each other.  We'll definitely have again.

We liked it. I added more creole seasoning than the recipe calls for, so it was a bit spicy, but overall very good and easy to make. In spite of all the reviews praising the sauce, we thought it was just ok. Not good enough to make again.

Only change I made was to bake this on a baking sheet instead of in a 9 x 13 baking dish. Also I couldn't find fresh dill so had to use dried but the sauce was still pretty darn tasty too.  Next time I'll search out the fresh to see if there's a difference.  It was really tasty and I will definitely repeat this recipe. Served with Chef John's Classic Rice Pilaf and Superfast Asparagus - made a for a really lovely meal tonight.

I rinsed the fillets in half lime juice/half water and then sprinkled Old Bay on both sides before baking at 400 for 25 minutes.  The sauce definitely took this to the next level - all of my kids loved it!

Sauce is great, if it wasn't for the sauce the fish would be even more bland. Anyways..

The fish was moist yes but very plain and boring. We all ate it, it wasn't horrible or bad. But I would never order it at a restaurant or bother with it again. The lemon on top made it visually appealing but considering the fish cooks so quickly it didn't really cook into it or add much flavor.

Fish was very good, used two tsp of dry dill since I did not have any fresh handy.  Would like to try with fresh as dill is said to be one of the spices best when fresh. The sauce was good, but nothing fantastic, made a big portion.

4.5 Stars: I made the dill sauce, and forgot it!  Either way, it was still easy and delicious.  I just sprinkled the cajun seasoning, rather than measuring.

The sauce was delicious, and it paired perfectly with the spiciness of the Cajun seasoning.  I used Emeril's Essence for my seasoning, which I made up a few months ago and use when I need it.  I tried this on salmon also, and it was delicious--I served it to guests, and they asked for the recipe!  I used the leftover dill sauce as a vegetable dip the next day.  I will keep the dill sauce recipe and make it over and over again for my family, and for guests!

The fish was good, but the sauce is awesome!  My husband and I are on a Paleo diet, so I used wild caught mahi-mahi, avocado mayonnaise, and organic sour cream, and the dill sauce was fabulous!  I used dried dill (1 tablespoon) because that's what I had on hand.  I tripled the garlic powder and made the sauce several hours before dinner so the flavors had time to mingle and merge.  I'm thinking that if I added some cream to the dill sauce it would make an excellent salad dressing.  I served the fish and sauce with grilled asparagus (yum, the sauce also works well for asparagus) and roasted butternut squash, and this dinner will definitely be on the weekly rotation!!!

Thank you allrecipes.com for this DailyDish email suggestion.  Hours after receiving your email with this recipe, I was serving it hot out of the oven for my family.  

I made 10 fillets for a family of 5.  There is not a sliver left as leftovers. It was a light and tasty meal. I served it with rice pilaf and steamed green beans.  

I forgot to purchase sour cream for the sauce and also did not have another lemon on hand for the sauce.  Instead of sour cream, I substituted plain Greek yogurt and instead of lemon juice, I used grapefruit juice. The sauce was amazing nonetheless!  All 5 of us rated this 5 stars and have asked that this be added to our family menu repitoire!!

Just made this for dinner and wow! Used Icelandic cod and added some Old Bay Seasoning ( being from New England I use it on everything! ). Also didn't have lemons so I just sprinkled lemon juice over each filet before baking. Otherwise followed the recipe for the fish and the dill sauce and we loved it. I am sure it will be a "regular" in our rotation.

Easy, tasty and different way to cook tilapia. The sauce is delicious. Served it to my parents when they came to visit, and they took the recipe home with them. I make the Essence Cajun seasoning from this site (more or less), so everything for this recipe is always on hand.

Love the sauce! I've used baked, fried, and grilled fish for this and no matter how the fish is prepared, the sauce works well with it. My son even asks for the sauce when I make him fish sticks that I saw on Giada's show.

The dill sauce was the perfect compliment for the fish. Followed the recipe and the fish came out great.

One of my favorites from this site is the Broiled Tilapia Parmesan; however I think I like this recipe a little better. I like a thicker piece of fish, so I used flounder and my family really enjoyed it and they didn't miss the cheese or butter that they usually expect when I make the tilapia recipe mentioned above. Thanks for sharing.

My favorite seafood recipe right now! The tilapia fish is so light and flavorful and the dill sauce is just the perfect compliement to this fish! I made this for my parents one evening...they raved about it and my mom demanded the recipe! It's just a fab dish with great flavor and SiMpLE to make

A pretty good and quick dinner recipe.  Like everyone else has said, the dill sauce makes the dish.  Cool, creamy and very tasty. I used a cheaper Cajun spice and it seemed to be comprised of mainly salt.  Good thing I didn't add any extra salt or pepper, just the Cajun spice.  It would have been too salty to eat!  In the future, I think I will mix up my own Cajun spice with a myriad of spices such as, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, cayenne pepper, salt, black pepper, paprika, etc.  I had to bake the tilapia a few more minutes than stated on the recipe, but that was no problem.  The ingredients for the dill sauce make quite a bit...I plan to use the rest as a spread on our lunch sandwiches tomorrow morning.  One reviewer said she makes the dill sauce as a dip for veggies...a good idea.

Fabulous.  At first I thot the 'too spicy' but when combined with the cool sour cream of the sauce...magic happens! PS:  I don't use tilapia.  I use Icelandic (brand) All Natural Wild Caught Cod Premium Center Cut Loins, from Sam's.  I've been using these for awhile and I am really happy with them.  A thicker piece of fish...really good.

This recipe is all about the sauce and earns the five stars on its own. Fix your tilapia, salmon, etc any way you please but use this sauce. I substituted Greek yogurt for the mayo and used a little more garlic powder to combat the tartness. I hosted a party after making this recipe and used the sauce just a dip, served with Ruffles or pita chips. Do it!

The sauce alone is amazing. Good to eat with some veggies. I used a little less sour cream, I find the flavor is richer that way. Will definitely make again!

Delish! and easy. I used Zataran's blackening seasoning. I had to leave mine in about 10 minutes longer though. They were kinda thick.

Made this with Badia Louisiana Cajun brand seasoning.  Didn't make the sauce to save on the calories.  Actually very flavorful and didn't need it.   Very clean and refreshing!

This was tasty, but I agree with many of the other reviewers-the sauce makes it. Used tarragon because I was out of dill and it was delicious. Was also out of sour cream and used lowfat cottage cheese. I blended it with a stick blender. I will certainly make agaain.

Very good flavor combo. Cajun seasoning is one of my favorites on fish, but it gets a little tired after so many times. This sauce provided the perfect freshness, and complemented the Cajun spices well. That said, I did add extra lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste--otherwise it would have been a little bland. Taste before you serve! Both my husband and I really enjoyed it, and it was a great way to use dill from the herb garden. The only drawback is that the edges of the fish do get a tad dehydrated in the oven.

This was a simple baked fish recipe, but nothing to "write home about."  It tasted fine, but I don't think I would go here again.  It was definitely pretty to serve with the lemon slices on top, and fun with the sauce on the side, but it wasn't show-stopping in the taste-department.

This was my first time using tilapia and baking fish and we very much enjoyed the combination of spicy seasoned fish with the dill sauce althought I did add some sweet pickle relish for a bit more brightness to the sauce.

Both fish and the sauce were great! Heads up on the salt though... Keep it minimal. Along with Cajun it can become a bit too much... I served it with sweet and spicy green beans( recipe on this site) and garlic mashed potatoes.

I made this tonight, and I thought it tasted great! The Cajun spice was a bit salty we thought, so I  might use less next time. I did not add any salt at all, just the pepper and the Cajun seasoning and the lemon. Also the fish is so flaky, that you cant really "dip" it in the sauce. But the flavors were great, and it was really quick and easy to prepare and looked great on the plate! I'll make this again for sure!

This recipe was delicious. I did change a few things though. Instead of using mayonnaise, I used greek yogurt in the sauce to cut down on fat. It was a perfect combination of spicy fish and cool, tangy sauce. I also added a handful of cherry tomatoes to the baking dish because I needed to use them up. It turned out to be a nice addition. I served it with rice and streamed broccoli.

My husband is not a big fan of fish, but he ate his entire serving because of the dill sauce.  I didn't measure the dill, garlic powder, or lemon juice when I made the sauce; I just added until I thought it tasted good.  Good recipe.

I loved the tilapia and the sauce equally! I did however add a significant amount more of the cajun seasoning. I basically covered all 4 tilapia pieces in cajun seasoning and pan fried it instead of putting in the oven. I cooked it for about 4 minutes on each side and it came out nice and crispy on the edges but not overcooked. I also added more lemon and garlic to the sauce which tasted even better the next day. I baked some broccoli with garlic powder, salt and pepper flakes and cooked some rice and had a delicious meal! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This tilapia is anything but dull in flavor! The creamy dill sauce tempers the bite of the Cajun and serves as an enhancement. A wonderful combination! I have to admit I did drizzle a tiny bit of garlic basting oil to ensure a moist result. It may not be entirely necessary, but if you are lucky enough to have a Wegmans grocer near you, you won't be disappointed adding this additional step to finish off a most delightful cha-cha for your tastebuds!

Excellent fish recipe. My wife loves fish but I am not a fan of it. That being said, I made this tonight for dinner. We both loved  it!  I prepared this exactly as written. Very light and absolutely no fishy taste.  Served with fresh spinach, wild rice, and warm French bread. The dill sauce pushed this over the  top.  All you guys out there who have steak while your significant other has fish, trust me this recipe will change your mind about having something different. A++

This was very good.  The dill sauce was great.  I think it needed a little more lemon.  I didn't have fresh dill, so I used a tea of dried.

this sauce is excellent!!  I used yogurt for the sour cream, 2 tsp of dill and about 1 1/2 tsp. lemon juice and a bit extra on the garlic.  Also, pan fried the fish in a bit of butter and olive oil.  Very tasty.

I didn't modify the recipe except for heating the sauce and it was excellent! The dill sauce complements the cajun seasoned tilapia so well! This is going in my favorites for sure!

Instead of baking the fish, I dredged it in whole wheat flour and cajun seasoning then pan fried in a butter/ olive oil mixture.  It turned out beautiful and delicious.  The sauce was also great.  A new favorite in our home.

This was very flavorful. I liked the cajun seasoning, had a nice kick to it without being overly spicy. I used two slices of lemon for each fish (I had frozen tilapia fillets). Will make again!!!

Cooked the fish at 400 degrees. Should have followed the instructions in this recipe instead of on the tilapia loin pkg. Fish a bit too dry. However, sauce & flavor really good. Will try again, but cook at lower temp.

This was delicious!!! My boyfriend asked me to put this in our dinner rotation after his first bite. Like some other reviewers, I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream because I had it on hand. I tasted the sauce before I served it and thought it tasted a little odd, but with the fish and with the grilled asparagus I served with it, the sauce was absolutely perfect.

I really liked this recipe.  The sauce was thicker than I was expecting, and I may try to make it with a bit more "zing" next time, either using more lemon juice or plain yogurt.  Overall very good, though!

I add tiny chopped red onion to my sauce and also cook with fresh lemon juice on top of fish. Right before taking it out I put the Dill sauce on so it get's a little warm.

A simple and quick recipe to put together.  I loved the cajun seasoning on the fish, and the flavors in the dill sauce go together well.  The only thing I did differently was to put a little bit of melted butter in with the fillets, so that they wouldn't stick.  Also I would half the sauce recipe, unless you really like a lot of sauce on your fish  - I had a ton left over.

Loved the sauce, that makes this dish! I cooked my fish on the grill and it was excellent paired with the dill sauce. I also used yogurt instead of sour cream (as I do for pretty much anything that calls for sour cream). I added a little more dill and more lemon than it called for and it was delicious.

This was very good as written, but next time I will make less sauce and spoon it over the fish before serving.

I didn't have the dill to make the sauce :( but the fish was super tasty. I put some greek lemon/oil sauce on top and it was super tasty. I did at a pat of butter to each fillet but otherwise, I made exactly as written. We'll be eating this again.

This was my first time eating (and preparing) tilapia. I thought this was delicious. My husband (who is not a fish eater) had seconds. I followed the recipe as written with the exception of adding more lemon juice to the Dill Sauce. I love lemon. I thought the Dill Sauce was perfect for this dish. YUM!

I thought this was delicious, especially the dill sauce. I am a huge fan of cajun seasoning, but felt that it made the fish a little too salty. So I would recommend using less salt and/or cajun seasoning. Other than that, I loved this!

Absolutely LOVED this recipe!  I have a cajun seasoning - Dinosaur Bar-B-Que Cajun Foreplay...This is SOOO good with the tilapia.  I found my go-to recipe for SURE!  I like to double it and have some for lunch the next day.  Still so amazing reheated.

WOW. This is wonderful. Absolutely the best. I do not like creamy sauces with any dish, but my husband and children do. I try and find recipes that I don't have to add it onto and this fit the bill. But, I added the sauce to my fish, and my cous cous and my asparagus....and I still wanted more.

absolutely love this recipe! my husband and I make it all the time, it was also a huge hit with the in-laws. The only thing I changed was that we lightly coat the Tilapia with olive oil prior to baking instead of greasing the pan. I used the 'Simple Cajun' recipe off this site.

OMG this tilapia was WONDERFUL! I am new to cooking and I can honestly say that this was a simple, no fuss main dish. I did make one addition to the sauce though--I heated it on the oven cooktop and doubled the recipe for it (we like a lot of extra sauce). I'm glad I did--every bit of it was eaten, along with the fish. Even my twin toddlers liked it, and they are both picky eaters. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good; however, I read some of the reviews and I tried baking the fish in the oven and also tried pan frying it with a little extra virgin olive oil and butter. The pan frying was the best - it gave the fish more flavor. I pan fried it in a cast iron skillet on med/high heat for about 2 minutes on each side (after seasoning it with salt, pepper, a cajun) I will probably leave off the salt next time b/c it was rather salty. After it cooked, I sprinkled some lemon juice on it. It was delicious with the dill sauce!! My husband said they prefer it cooked that way from now on!!!

The 5 stars are for the sauce and the cajun mix idea for the fish. I had to make a few changes to cut calories, so I used 2% Fage Greek yogurt and mayo light. For the fish, I coated with flour, dipped in eggs and coated again with bread crumbs then baked. Hubby thought they were fried (as he had ordered)! The sauce was outta this world!

Loved this!!  The dill sauce makes the dish.  I would say however, I did not need salt and pepper along with the Cajun seasoning... it was WAY too salty for us.  It may have been the brand of Cajun seasoning I used, LOUISIANA, which contained salt.  Delicious otherwise!

This was good. My only complaint was the Dill sauce was too strong of a mayo flavor. I will reduce that next time.

I make this at least once a month for my husband - we both love it!  It is so easy to prepare and the dill sauce is a perfect cooling compliment to the spicy heat of the tilapia.  I added a few red pepper flakes to the fish before baking to add even more heat.  Really a delish recipe - thank you for posting!

This was an okay recipe.  I probably won't ever make it again, but then again I don't really care for baked fish.  Maybe if you did it on a skilett it would taest better. It just wasn't very good. The dill sauce was yummy,..but not the fish.

Was great! The sauce could be cut down in quantity a bit because tilapia is generally small and the sauce goes along great with the cajun seasoning, but will definitely be making this again!

I don't even really care for dill and this was FANTASTIC!  I didn't have a lemon on hand, so I just squirted a little bottled lemon juice on the fillets before cooking them!  I also used plain non fat yogurt in place of the sour cream to make the sauce virtually guilt free!  I also took the advice of another reviewer and warmed up the sauce in the microwave a little bit!  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was great!  I used cod instead of tilapia because its what I had and it was perfect.  The sauce was the best part!

I thought the fish was great but I didn't care for the sauce. It tasted too much like mayo. Just my opinion..

The flavor of the dill combined with the lemon juice and cajun seasoning was perfect. We cooked the tilapia on the stove over medium heat, turning it up to medium-high at the last minute to give it a little more color and crunch. Dill sauce was served on the side. Perfect.

I didn't even have mayo, so I just used the 1/2 cup of sour cream, and the sauce was still awesome with the fish.  YUM.

Thanks. Very quick and easy. I used dill weed from the jar. Not as good as fresh but worked okay. I'll probably pan fry next time to make it a little crispy.

Great recipe.  Followed the directions exactly as listed here and turned it out great.  My boyfriend hates anything that resembles tarter sauce but I love it and made it anyways.  He ending up eating more of the sauce than I did! Will probably try following the advice of some of the other reviewers next time I make this.  Although it turned out great as a baked dish (love the smell of baked lemons on fish!) I'd love to get the fish a little more crispy and pan frying will be the way to go to achieve that. Made with asparagus with toasted almonds recipe also found on the website.  Great meal! Just wish I'd had some white wine to with it!

FANTASTIC! 15min in the oven and they were perfectly cooked. Used light miracle whip for the Mayo & fat free yogurt instead of Sour Cream. Also took the garlic powder up to a heaping 1/2t (could have been more). The fish had great flavor with a light spice from the cajun dusting, and the dill sauces was slightly sweet from the yogurt, and complimented the fish VERY well.

I was very surprised that the sauce was quite plain with the fish. So many reviews raved about the sauce, but it left a slight astrigent feel in the mouth. Adding some garlic salt to the fish at the end helped, but not enough to where I'd make this again.

The fish was a little bland.  I would love to try it pan fried instead of baked and maybe spice it up a little more.  I used the extra dill sauce on raw carrots for a snack the next day.  The dill sauce is delicious!

Super yummy.  I used Emeril's Essence seasoning instead of the Cajun seasoning and it was awesome.  The dill sauce is fantastic - it really makes the dish special.  For those Southerners out there, the dill sauce is just like the delicious dill sauce that Atlanta Bread Company makes and serves with their California Avocado sandwich.

This was excellent.  I made exactly as directed and I would make again.  The only thing I would do differently would be to use light sour cream and no mayo in the dill sauce.  It was way too heavy for my taste.  Thanks for the great recipe

I am not crazy about dill but figured I would give it a try. I am so glad I did. My family loved it and the sauce went on everything from fish to potatoes. I will be making this again and again.

I wanted to like this dish, but just didn't like the sauce.  Dill is not for me.  The fish, however was tasty.  I pan fried it instead of baking it.  If you like dill, I'm sure this is a winner as others have reviewed, but just not for me.

5 stars for the dill sauce. The tilapia was easy and tastey but nothing extraordinary. I saved this to my recipe box only because of the dill sauce. I've used it with fondue meat and veggies, fish and tonight salmon quinoa patties. So easy and yummy.

I had enough fish to make 3 different variations based on the reviews: 1. w/salt and pepper, 2. w/salt and pepper and lemons and 3. with salt, pepper and cajun seasoning.  It really matters on your taste, but I liked the one with the cajun seasoning, my husband liked the other two.  While I thought the dill sauce was light and delicious, neither my husband and I are big on adding sauces to our fish.   It was good and I would definitely make it for guests.

Nice, simple fish recipe - would rate this 3.5 stars.  Adding dill seed, in addition to dill weed, is a nice touch to the sour cream sauce (it tastes a lot like caraway seeds and adds a crunchy texture).

Sauce/topping was good, but way too much (too flavorful) called for for only 4 servings.

I must agree that the sauce is delicious. I cooked the fish as per the recipes except I put some butter on the fish to keep it moist. I usually am scared to cook white fish as I've dried it out before but this turned out perfectly.  I also really really liked ths sauce with the steamed brocolli I had with the fish.
Update - I use this sauce recipe ALL THE TIME!

Very good. Really liked the dill sauce the best. My daughter liked the fish but not the dill sauce, but she is the only one who felt that way. Will make again.

Like others have commented, the fish itself is ok, but it’s the dill sauce that really makes the recipe.  For the sauce, I used light mayo, light sour cream, and dried dill.  Nice, easy dinner for a weeknight.

Cajun flavor isn't popular in our home, so I followed the suggestion in reviews to season simply with salt and pepper, topped with lemon slices.  The dill sauce was very good!  Just right with the simple baked fish!  I served this with carrots in dill butter (also from this site).  A good pairing.

I wish I could give this a 4.5.  I would have rated 5 stars but I made a few alterations to the sauce - used fresh garlic instead, added Chulula and onion power, and added more lemon juice than recipe calls for.  It was really good and we will make again.    Also, our fish was not dried out at all.

Other reviews said they had trouble with the fish drying out, but I didn't have this problem. Just make sure you don't over cook it the fish and be sure to cover with lemon slices (these lock in the moisture). OR just fry up in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat with some evoo. The Dill sauce was excellent. Our house smelled awesome all night. We'll have this one on the menu again at our house!

Delicious... When a recipe gets added to ones regular rotation that says it all. This spicy cajun flavored fish married with the fresh dill and lemon mayonnaise to dip into was mouthwatering good! It was a cinch to prep, bake and have on the dinner table in a flash. We like spice and liberally dosed that all over the fish. Lay this over a bed of fresh baby spinach for a nice presentation and serve with your favorite vegetable. We paired this with Asparagus or Gingered Almond Greenbeans more times than I can count!

As I didn't have fresh dill on hand, per other reviewers, I used approx. 3/4 tsp. dill in the sauce. Also substituted lemon juice instead of the lemon slices. Just eyeballed the seasonings. Everything was excellent! The spicy fish with the tangy sauce was fantastic, and the sauce went well with other veggies & salad, too!

Ooopppsss. I was so hungry I forgot to make the sauce. The fish was still tasty though. Used 1 tsp Cajun seasoning but will try 1 T next time. Served with rice, mixed veggies, and "Bacon Bean Stalks." ***UPDATE*** Made 1 serving for the sauce and ate it with kidlet's leftover. Pretty tasty but I think I'll look for another dill sauce off AR.

Not a favorite with anyone in our family.  We didn't find it that good with or without the dill sauce.  The dish was actually better the second day warmed in the microwave.  Don't think this is one really worth making again.

This was a super dish and very easy to prepare. The dill sauce as others have stated is absolutely fabulous. The only change I made was to pan fry the fish (as other reviews suggested). Hubby and I both enjoyed this dish. Fantastic! Thanks so much for sharing 'KHUDSON3'!

It was a nice change from the typical fish sauces.  However, I did not have sour cream, so I substituted a small container of low fat lemon yogurt.  It helped to cut down on the overall fat content and offered a nice fresh lemon taste to compliment the dill.

This is a great recipe that is so delicious. It's easy to make, but comes off very well. One time I didn't have lemons so I replaced all the lemons and their juice with limes and their juice. I'm sure it's a very different taste, but it was great, too. The sauce makes the recipe--don't skip or skimp on it! You might like to adjust the mayo/sour cream ratio depending on your taste. For the cajun seasoning, I used another AR recipe, "Cajun Spice Seasoning Mix in a Jar."

This recipe is so quick and delicious!   I followed the recipe to a tee, and my husband and I loved everything about it.  The sauce is what really makes it.  It reminds me of my cucumber salad.  Delicious!!!

My husband and I thought, overall, that this was a great dish. However, the cajun seasoning I used (Louisiana) was a little too salty. I fried the tilapia instead using a mix of bread crumbs, corn meal, and flour. I didn't use fresh dill and the sauce was delicious.

New favorite!  Used dried dill since that's all I had and cut by amount by 1/2.  Wonderful.

I am happy this recipe was the first on the list from my search.  It should be!  My husband and I loved it.  I did add add a few tabs of butter to the baking dish and added some paprika.  Aside from that I followed the recipe.  The dill dip was good..added some season salt.  Verrry good, thanks for the great EASY recipe!

We also fried this one.   My husband loved it, which says a lot, but I thought it was a bit bland---next time I will use more cajun spices.  The sauce was OK.

I fried the fish in a little olive oil as suggested by others. Next time, I would omit the salt. We loved the Cajun spice and the sauce. My husband doesn't usually care for fish, but had seconds of this dish. Thanks for the recipe!

Not a big fish eater, but we made this recipe and it turned out excellent.  I pan fried it in order to save time and added some cayenne pepper to the sauce and on the fillet to add some heat, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.

The sauce was pretty good but I had to use dry dill instead of fresh which I am sure makes a difference.  Overall, my family thought traditional tartar sauce was better. 2nd time I made this with fresher dry dill and it was much better.  We did not, however, like the sliced lemon on top b/c the fish was very bitter due to the rind.  Next time I will just squeeze the juice on it.

Yum, yum, yum!!  The dill sauce is awesome.  I did not have fresh dill so I used 1 tsp of dry dill and doubled the garlic powder.  Since it was sooooo hot here I did not want to use my oven so I cooked the tilapia in a pan with olive oil and a little butter.  This is a 5 star keeper!!!

Very quick prep.  Made the creole seasoning myself so that actually took longer than anything else.  I laced my baking dish with olive oil and my tilapia came out tender/flaky as can be in just 15 minutes.  Sauce was simple and refreshing, it yields a bit much, so I'm using the leftover sauce in my mashed potatoes.

This was very easy to make and tasted great!  I used light mayo and light sour cream to reduce the fat content.  The recipe makes more cream sauce than you really need.

One of the best fish dishes I've ever had. Instead of Cajun seasoning, I used Old Bay seasoning.  Delish.  My husband, who typically dislikes fish, thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  I served this with brown rice and asparagus.

I'm not a big fan of cajun seasoning, so I baked the fish with my regular lemon, dill and breadcrumb mixture. What I was really looking for was a nice, light sauce to put on top. And this was it. The only change I made was to add just a pinch of sugar to cut the acidity of the sour cream. This made double the amount of sauce that we needed so next time I will use only half the ingredients.

Very disappointed. Basically baked fish with tartar sauce. Won't be making again. I'd rate it a 1 except we did eat it. Today 2/23/17 we made this once again but without the lemon slices. I just sprinkled some lemon juice on it & it was better. We use the dill sauce on fish tacos & would give the sauce a 4. Our favorite is the Parmesan  Baked Fish, but this will do for a change.

10/14/2017 We've changed our minds now on this recipe.  Have made several times again & guess our taste buds are changing cause I'd give it a 4 star now & we'll keep making.

This sauce is sooooo good! I use a different recipe for the fish - Blackened Tilapia with Secret Hobo Spices - b/c it was recommended by so many members. But this sauce is fantastic! Some members complained about it making the fish cold, but I think it adds a nice cool, refreshing taste to the spiciness of the fish. I usually add a little extra lemon to taste. Really yummy!

This was awesome!  I grilled the fish for a lighter version, left off the lemon on top and used all fat-free ingredients for the sauce!  YUMMMMMM!!!!

Simple, very tast and most of the ingredients (for cooking enthusiasts) are on hand.  Had to substitute chipotle chili powder for cajun as I was out.  Added about 1T of white wine and lemon infused olive oil then squeezed half lemon over wine and oil to fish before adding dry seasons.  It retained moisture, was delicious.  I also added about 1T of the wine and 1/2t. jar chop garlic to 'dip'.  The dipping sauce added welcome a summery flavor.  I really enjoyed it!

I don't really read recipes and ended up baking the fish in the dill sauce in the oven. I won't even bother trying to follow the recipe - this way was amazing.

Amazing. I didn't measure the cajun seasoning, I just sprinkled it on. I didn't have lemons so I sprinkled some lemon juice over the fish before I put it in the oven. The fish took exactly 20 mins to cook. The sauce was amazing on the fish, it is also very good with vegetables. I subbed plain nonfat yogurt for sour cream. I recommend this recipe. Thanks for the recipe.

Was pretty good. I wasn't too crazy about the dill sauce actually. I know most reviews raved about how the sauce made the meal but I disagree. The fish was great but my kids wouldn't eat it because it was too spicy so next time I'll most likely just use garlic/pepper seasoning.

This had great flavor.  Next time I will use twice as much cajun seasoning, but I like spicy food.  We only used half the sauce, though.  I'm definitely making this one again!

The sauce was delicious. I used chives instead of the dill.  I used less Cajun seasoning as well because I have a 4-year old eating also...  Excellent recipe!

Great recipe. I tweaked a lot of the numbers, though. For our tastes, I needed about double the Cajun seasoning. I added more dill and garlic to the sauce, as well. I also did not like how thick it was, so I added about 1/4 cup milk to thin it out a bit.  Overall, great base recipe. You may have to modify it to suit your liking.

Super quick, easy, and inexpensive.  The BF likes it lots too.  The dill sauce keeps as well and can be used with other dishes.  I use canola lower-fat mayonnaise and it tastes quite good.  Served with coconut rice and broccoli.  Good Friday night dish after a long workweek and a couple of happy hour cocktails at the pub.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I made the Dill Sauce the day before using. I used Light Sour Cream and a touch more garlic powder. Before drizzling the sauce over the fish, I warmed it in the microwave for 20 second then stirred. I let it sit and warmed again for another 10 seconds. I do think that it brought out the flavors, plus I don't like putting cold sauces on warm food. The spices on the Talapia and the sauce were a great combination.

Delicious! I took a cue from one of the other reviewers and put the sauce on top of the filets about halfway through the baking time so that the sauce heated through as well. Very nice.

We enjoyed this..   I added a little olive oil to the fish before baking it and didn't really measure the seasoning - just sprinkled both sides of the fish generously - and it was awesome.  We skipped the sauce to save a few calories and it was good enough without it.

It was silent at the dinner table, which says a lot for 15 people to be quiet!  everyone loved it, it was a beautiful combination with the cajun and lemon paired with the dill sauce!  It was absolute heaven!  To make sure it didn't dry out while baking I squeezed the lemon ends, left over from slicing the lemons, on top of the fish.  I put white rice on the side along with fried green beans, which made for an excellent meal!

Rating this strictly for the sauce only.  I wanted a sauce to serve with fried fish and this was delicious!  I added a little extra garlic than called for and think it would be really good with fresh garlic too. Update: I finally made the fish and it was simple and delicious.  The sauce still definitely makes this recipe though!

Good recipe but I changed it a bit. I also put Mrs. Dash seasoning, garlic, onion powder on the fish before I baked it. Also I covered it for 20 mins (took foil off) and baked additional 10 minutes. Will make again.

I used Old Bay instead of cajun spices, and it went great with the dill sauce!  I thought it would've tasted good by itself without the sauce, too, if you're counting calories or something.  I sprayed each filet with a little butter spray before adding the Old Bay.

The stars only go to the dill sauce. I did not even try the fish recipe, as I read so many reviews saying it was not worth trying--or only worth trying with various additions.  I used the fish recipe, "Blackend Tilapia with Secret Hobo Spices" and it was a FANTASTIC spicy fish recipe perfectly complimented with this dill sauce.  I also used some suggestions to make the dill sauce less fatty and more healthy in an effort to eat as much as I wanted with my fish!  The next time, I will try using non-fat yogurt instead of mayo in an effort to cut calories.

This is a great quick recipe for this dish and this sauce is AWESOME!  So tasty and could easily be used for salmon, or even chicken in my opinion.  So tasty, next time I might use a smidge less garlic but we loved this dish and it looks nice on the plate too!!

This is probably the best tilapia I've ever made at home.
The sauce is outstanding due to the freshness of the taste.That's using bottled dill too.
The baking method comes out very moist; I followed the recipe with seasoning on both sides before baking.
Just loved it. Made some rice and pasta stir fry on the side.
All recipes.com  is my favorite since I found recently!

this is an easy and fast dinner.  I really liked the dill dip.  I didn't have fresh dill so I just used the dry dill.  My kids loved it and they were even dipping their rolls in it.

UPDATE: MADE THIS A SECOND TIME, BUT INSTEAD OF BAKING MY FISH, I PAN FRIED IT. SIMPLY HEAT 2 T EVOO IN A SKILLET SET ON MEDIUM-HIGH HEAT. DREDGE YOUR FISH IN ~ 1/8 C. AP FLOUR (TO WHICH YOU ADD YOUR SEASONINGS), SHAKE OFF ANY EXCESS AND COOK FOR 2-3 MINUTES PER SIDE OR UNTIL FISH FLAKES EASILY WITH A FORK. SERVE WTIH LEMON WEDGES ON THE SIDE AND YOU'RE ALL SET! TRUST ME, CHANGING THE COOKING METHOD IS KEY (AND IT FREES UP YOUR OVEN TO ROAST SOME ASPARAGUS TO SERVE ON THE SIDE... MMM....)! Hmmm.... This was just so-so. My bf and I both agree - the fish itself is nothing special, but is MUCH better when paired with the homemade dill sauce. And while we enjoyed the sauce we felt it was not "excellent" nor did it "make" the dish (but it did add much needed "oomph" to otherwise bland fish). HOWEVER, the sauce is EXCELLENT on asparagus. If I ever make this again, I'll definitely tinker with the cooking method (maybe pan fry???) and serve the sauce at room temperature. This was for sure a light meal, just not an impressive one. Thanks anyways, KHUDSON3. :-)

My husband keeps asking me to make this. We had it twice in one week! The dill sauce is great for cooling down the spice. I followed the instructions exactly, except I didn't use fresh dill and I added garlic

The tilapia was good and easy, but the dill sauce made it really delicious!  I will make this again with other types of fish.  Next time I will try pan-frying the fish.

Simple and delicious, a great dish when you're pressed for time.  I love cajun flavoring on fish.  And the dill sauce was good - very fresh.  I did not have garlic powder so used fresh minced garlic instead.

I would've only given this recipe 2 stars just based on the fish, but the sauce was really, really good!  I used reduced fat sour cream and light mayo and it still came out great.  Chives are also a good substitute for the dill.

Very nice!  Like many of the other reviewers, I am wild about the Dill Sauce!  Fish was good too.  What I will do next time I make this:
1. Warm the sauce.
2. Not totally slather it all over the fish but serve it on the side (that one was my own mistake, but the sauce was SO good!!)

Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

Good, I'll make it again.  I particularly enjoyed the dill sauce.  I read some of the other reviews and shied away from the cajan seasoning and used Old Bay instead.

Easy enough to make, but the dill was a little too much for me. I'd also consider one of the mayo-substitute comments, as the meal felt a lot heavier than it should have.

I agree with what another user said. The fish was 'okay' but the dill sauce was excellent. I'd use the sauce as a dip for crackers or veggies.

Up until today, I never thought I could bake fish.  I'm more of a "poacher" - and it's always been salmon.  But, I'm trying to incorporate better (and new) choices into our diets and thought what the heck - we'll give it a try.  Easy and insanely good.  Didn't have real lemons, so I just used lemon juice.  Used less Cajun, due to fact the kids were eating this.  And, added a splash of Pinot Grigio into the pan.  None of us were real keen on the sauce (fortunately, I put it to the side of everyone else's plates). But, the fish part of the recipe will be made again!

I make this dill sauce all the time - great on salmon and steak, as well. I use a lot more dill than it calls for, though. Also, I add more garlic powder and lemon juice to taste. Highly recommended.

This recipe ROCKS.  I've made it three times now and it is awesome.  I add a lot more cajun seasoning and no salt, and it turns out awesome every time, and the dill sauce is AWESOME.  Will make this all the time now!!  Definitely worth a try!!

Loved it!!! The lemon slices were so great, I will do this with any fish recipe that calls for lemon. It was so much better than just using lemon juice whle baking. The sauce was a nice way too cool down the heat from the cajun and pepper seasoning. Will make this one again for sure!

Delicious sauce, it really makes the dish. But don't use to much because it will overwhelm the flavor of the fish. We did use leftover sauce for veggies the next night. Simple & good!

The tilapia with seasoning and lemon slices tasted very good after 20 minutes in the oven at 350F.  The dill sauce also has a very good flavor; however, the recipe calls for entirely too much sauce and tends to overwhelm the flavor of the tilapia.  I scraped most of the sauce off the tilapia and discarded.  I would say that 1/3 the amount of sauce is actually the best for me.  I had this with rice pilaf and a small side salad.  Extra dill sauce just doesn’t do any favors for rice pilaf so keep the sauce recipe smaller unless you know it will go with something; such as asparagus.  Also, increase the garlic powder to 1/2 teaspoon for 4 servings.

the sauce was excellent. from what i read from other reviews, the fish was supposed to be a bit bland. so what i did instead was squeeze lemon juice over top, add chipotle pepper to it and italian seasoning. then i place two lemon wedges over it. the fish was pretty good, but still better with the sauce

I didn't have any Cajun spice mix on hand so I just used pepper/paprika/season salt.  The fish was amazing and the sauce was delicious.

The sauce was kind-of a lighter version of a tartar sauce and was absolutely perfect for ringing out the mild flavor of the fish.  I bet it'd be a great sandwich spread too!!

This is a great simple recipe.  The sauce is outstanding, and fantastically easy.

Added to my box 5 minutes after dinner was done.

This was so tasty and couldn't be easier to make.  I didn't measure the cajun seasoning, it sounded like too much, so I just sprinkled it on.  The dill sauce made a lot so I would cut it in half, or save it for another dish.  I think it would be excellent on beef, like maybe a tenderloin or something similar.  My picky son loved this dish so anything I can get him to eat is definitely a keeper!

Very easy to make and added a different meal for the week.  The dill sauce was also used with steamed veggies that was made.  So this could also double as a GREAT DIP!!

Can't wait to make this again!!

CHEERS!!

This was surprisingly good. I did omit the cajun season (I'm apparenly all out) and used low fat mayo and fat free sour cream. The sauce was delish!! I think it would go great on roasted veggies such as asparagus too.

Excellent! I've made this dish several times now and we really like it. I use fat free sour cream or plain yogurt and just a dollop of light mayo. The Cajun seasoning gives the fish a great kick and the dill sauce and lemon help cool it down. Thanks :)

Really great recipe.  I don't cook fish that often, but will do so more now.  I have little ones so I used paprika instead of cajun seasoning.  The sauce was great, but I will probably use a little more garlic next time.

Easy,delicious and a family pleaser.  My husband and I ate while kids were out and it was all gone.  Based on my husbands raves, I made more for my kids upon return from sports practise and they loved it too.  Sprinkled Itialian herbs on top for color.  Sauce was BIG hit- thanks!

Didn't really change much.  I didn't have fresh dill so I used a smaller amount of a dill mix.  Otherwise I did it just like the directions.  Yummy!

We make this over and over again.  The dill sauce is awesome.  I used light sour cream and miracle whip. Just as good as when I tried with mayo. I put more lemon juice in.  We grill swordfish on our Weber with creole seasong and S & P.  Sauce on side.  Mmmmmm Good!

We loved this recipe and it was so easy.  Had lots of sauce left so planning to use for salmon dinner later in week.  Served with lemon dill rice from this site which was a perfect compliment.

Made this last night for dinner, and even my 7 yr. old liked it (he had seconds).  The fish and the dill sauce were both great.  I put a lot of cajun on my husband's pieces because he likes things spicy.  I just sprinkled a small amount on the others.  We all loved it!
