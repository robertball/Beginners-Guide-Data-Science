Combining all the best variations suggested here, I used mushrooms instead of tomatoes, seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic, and added some lemon juice at the end. I couldn't find condensed broth so I used a can of regular broth and a can of cream of chicken instead (and omitted the water). Everything else was according to the recipe. It was amazing! It checks all the boxes... quick, easy, healthy, one-pot, and delicious! I'm looking forward to my leftovers tomorrow...

I used this as a base recipe and did the following:  s/p/g on chicken - grilled it.   While grilling heated oil, garlic, fresh basil, sage, thyme and dry oregano in a skillet.   Added rice, spinach and tomatoes - mixed well with the oil/herb mixture.  Added water/broth - mixed.  Then stirred in chopped, grilled chicken.   Simmered altogether for about 10-15 minutes. Didn't add much time.  Thanks for the great base!

I really enjoyed this recipe - made it within 30 minutes and served with a side compliment of roasted vegetables. It's gluten-free - an added plus!!

This recipe was so yummy! I made minor changes and I have some suggestions, I used a lemon-pepper marinade for my chicken breast and since my boyfriend and I are major cheese fanatics, I added an entire cup of shredded parmesan and used half the amount of tomatoes. I also used 2 cups of just chicken broth instead of the condensed broth plus water. Overall this was a delicious recipe and I will definitely be making this again.

This turned out quite good.  Added a small amount of goat cheese crumbles after it was finished, for added creamy texture and more flavor to balance the saltiness.  Used brown rice Minute Rice, lemon pepper chicken as another reviewer suggested, and substituted low sodium regular chicken broth for the water and condensed broth.

I loved it! I used the others suggestions of adding onions, garlic and seasonings and swapped white win for the water and used arborio rice. I had to cook it longer, but it was amazing! Many thanks!

Quite good, but a bit bland. I certainly love how easy it was to make! On a work night, too! I recommend adding some of your favorite spice to the chicken before pan frying. I also doubled the Parm. :)

Great healthy recipe, easy and quick to make. Definitely add some seasoning to the chicken, but there was still just enough flavor, but it didn't have a whole lot of kick to it which we like. I added mushrooms too.

Looked for something different to serve a crowd and came upon this recipe.  I prepared it for 20 in a large pot.  It was delicious.  Very easy to make.  I seasoned the chicken and cooked it in batches.  I also added some garlic and onion while I cooked the last batch of chicken. I used regular broth instead of the condensed broth and eliminated the water.

This was really easy and tasted really good. For is, there was a bit too much liquid and the chicken broth was a bit to strong, we'll cut back on both and for sure make it again.

This recipe was great.  The risotto was very flavorful.  I added a little more spinach and absolutely use fresh.  It wilts in a flash.

Fast and pretty easy.  I didn't have quick rice so I made some brown rice and added it at the end.  I added seasoning and garlic and onion.  It was still a bit flat tasting.  The family was a split decision about who would want this dish again.  Perhaps more seasoning would bring this dish up a level?

Followed recipe minus the little bit of water and cooked rice in chicken broth.  Very bland to my surprise , I thought it would be very tasty and it was not.  My only advise is do not cook it to long, just the very brief few minutes once all combined

Very delicious. I also followed the recommendations and added salt, pepper, and garlic to the chicken. I did not dice the chicken, just halved the breasts. Omitted the water in lieu of a can of chicken broth and a can of cream of chicken soup. I didn’t have tomatoes on hand so I used a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes and drained it before adding it to the recipe. I did not use any mushrooms.

This is fantastic.  I only gave it 4 stars bc you definitely need to season the meat. I also cook the rice separate because it its fluffier that way.

Used frozen spinach, cream of mushroom soup,  and mushrooms in place of fresh spinach, chicken broth, and tomatoes. Also seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and red pepper flakes while it was cooking. Added a little milk and lemon at the end. Good idea for a quick weeknight meal!

This was a great recipe and my first time cooking risotto! I seen the comments stating it was a little bland. So before making it I googled a recipe similar to see what additions I could add to make it better beforehand. I added and chopped fresh garlic, oregano, basil, and "white" onions. I seasoned my chicken with Adobo all seasoning (not a lot bc it has salt in it), garlic powder, and if you're lucky to have it Flavor God's garlic seasoning. I marinaded the chicken for about 10-15mins (however much time it takes to wash dishes LOL) in LITE Italian dressing. I cooked the chicken in white wine and canola oil. Also, I used a hint of concentrated lemon juice to bring out the flavor. The lemon juice made it sooooooo amazing that my friends raved all night about it. I added some red pepper flakes and a lot of fresh grated Parmesan because I like cheese. Overall, great recipe but please try with these added spices. Hope this helps. - The Novice Cook :)

This is good, but definitely worth seasoning the chicken, adding garlic and then I added lemon at the end. Make sure you triple wash the spinach to avoid any grittiness!

We love fresh tomatoes from the garden.  It was good, but needs some seasoning!
