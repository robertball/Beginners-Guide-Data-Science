“WE’VE GOT A WIIIIIIINNER!!” So said the voice bellowing from the family room into the kitchen, where I was cleaning up after supper.  Truth be told, I was surprised; I was not expecting that great a review of these bars from Hubs at all.  They looked a little dry to me.  In fact, I thought maybe I had over baked them.  Earlier, as I was putting these bars together, I was a little disappointed; the blueberry filling looked skimpy to me.  Throwing caution to the wind, I tossed in another handful of berries, filling up the “blank” spaces, so I knew I had to be sure to bake them long enough.  I hoped for the best.  Well, it obviously was okay.  But I still had to see for myself.  Hubs, neat freak that he is, used a fork.  I did not, and the bar held together nicely.  Also, I’m glad I threw in that extra handful of blueberries, but I would have liked a little extra juiciness, so if I make these again, I’ll have to remember to increase all filling ingredients “by a handful.” (For a half recipe in an 8x8" pan) These are fresh tasting, flavorful and buttery and, interestingly, the next day the topping is still as it came out of the oven, not soggy as I had expected.

I made these bars with raspberry jam instead of the blueberry mixture and omitted the cinnamon. They were so easy to make and tasted great. I did end up baking them longer than the recipe stated in order to get them browned on top, and I had no trouble with getting the crust to stay together. This is a keeper- I

This is the first dessert I have ever made. It was easy, fun, and delicious. I can easily see myself making this in the future. The lemon juice really gave a kick to it. I added some frozen yogurt and it was superb. I used fresh blueberries from our blueberry bushes. We ate almost all of it. I added a more blueberries than the recipe said so there would be more of a blueberry taste rather than an oat taste.

The crumble "crust" didn't hold together very well and the overall taste is good but not stellar. It was sweet, but kind of bland other than that. I think I'd try less sugar and more lemon juice in the blueberry mixture, and maybe a little less flour-and-oat mixture next time.

This was pretty easy to make and tasted great!  I ended up mixing the dry ingredients with melted butter instead of chunks of buter in to a moist consistency and spread it on the bottom of the pan and over the blueberries. It turned out fine :)

I made these yesterday and my family loved them! They were absolutely delicious! I added some whipped topping when I  served them and they were even better! I have added this to my recipe book that I have been creating for years to hand down to my daughter when she grows up.  Thank you for sharing this fabulous recipe!

Great dessert! I did cook about 20 min longer for the firmness I wanted. Just to jazz it a little I used an extra tablespoon of lemon juice in the blueberries and I added about a cup of walnuts to the topping. My son is in heaven!

I used a Graham cracker pie shell, and cut the sugar down a bit. Next time I will substitute brown sugar for the white. It was delicious and a huge hit.

Absolutely delicious just as written! We don't even bother trying to cut these into squares. We just scoop it out into a bowl and add some fresh whipped cream (or vanilla ice cream) and we are good to go!

Amazing served warm with vanilla ice cream! I used a pastry blender to make the crust and topping extra crumbly and using fresh blueberries really added to this recipie! I think it could have used more blueberries but my family disagrees. I will definitely make this again!

Very amazing! I love the lemon zing with the blueberry. Here is what I did different: I used a vegan coconut oil-based homemade margarine found on a popular vegan baking website for the butter.  Doubled the recipe, so I could freeze some.  Other than that, followed the recipe.

For the crumble, I used only brown sugar in place of the white. I also added salt, and some almonds. For the filling, I added extra lemon juice. This recipe was great! Turned out perfect, not too sweet.

I can't give it five stars because I made a change but we love this recipe.  Instead of making the blueberry filling,  I actually used about 2.5 cups of home-made blueberry jam (long story as to why).  It turned out delicious!  I keep sneaking a bite everytime I wLk by the dish.  Will definitely make again.   Thanks for the recipe.

Very easy recipe to make and it’s very yummy! I cooked it on the bbq so I didn’t have to heat the house up! I’m definitely going to make this again!

These were the perfect dessert to a bbq themed work potluck.  Simple, easy, and fresh.  Followed the recipe exactly and the bars came out perfect.  I just loved the bit of cinnamon with the fresh berries.  I also lined my pan with parchment paper as I usually do when making layered bars which just makes it so much easier to removed them from the pan to slice

I was gifted 4 quarts of blueberries and needed to find a way to use them up, so I tried this recipe. These are so delicious and I found myself sneaking downstairs in the middle of the night for a bite! I also set aside a pan to share with coworkers. They raved about how good these bars are! The only substitution I made was to swap the flour for cornstarch because I didn’t have cornstarch.

I’m giving this a soft 3 for several reasons.  It should be a 1 Star simply for the fact that salt is no a part of this recipe.  Anytime you see a recipe without salt it should be a red flag.

Made these Blueberry Pie Bars yesterday as dessert as we had company coming over.  These blueberry bars were delicious.  Don't hold back on the fresh squeezed lemon juice as it really  marries well with the blueberries.  Next time I make them I will use brown sugar for the bottom and the topping and perhaps cut back on the sugar for the filling by 1/4 cup.  Also I used 3+ cups of blueberries and was happy that I did because I don't think that 2 cups would have been enough filling in the 9 x 13 pan.

I added more blueberries (1 cup) because it was not enough. I baked them for around 30 minutes. They seemed very fragile, but when I cut them only two on the outside broke (I probably didn't press the crust enough). They taste great and a day later still the same as when they were freshly baked. Next time maybe just a bit less sugar.

I made this recipe as is and it is very good. Next, time I might reduce the amount of sugar just for personal preference as I found the berry mix a bit too sweet. Or I might add a bit more lemon juice. However , as is, it is very berry very tasty!

Excellent taste, but two cups of blueberries were nowhere near enough to spread over an 9x13 crust. Fortunately I had a jar of homemade blueberry preserves and was able to use that to extend it.  I would add at least another cup of blueberries.

Great recipe to use up my frozen Blueberries! I made some adjustments based on other reviews. I used 3 cups of blueberries instead of 2 cups, I reduced the amount of sugar from 1.5 cups to 1 cup, and I used old fashioned oats because its all I had. I also didn't let that lemon zest go to waste. Recipe didn't call for it, but I added the zest of 1 lemon into the reserved topping, delicious! My family already went back for seconds. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Fantastic flavor - but topping was too much too dry and powdery and the bottom truly did crumble to bits when removing it from the pan. In order to be considered a "bar", the end product should hold together long enough to get from pan to plate to mouth. Probably needs more fat and perhaps an egg to hold it all together. As is, it would make a great ice cream topping. Would give 3 1/2 stars for the flavor.

I made these exact to the recipe. They do have a nice rich flavor but I think I may decrease the oatmeal next time. For me, it just had too much oatmeal flavor. The blueberry sauce is very tasty and definitely top it off with ice cream (Vanilla Bean)!

Amazing. Not too sweet, just perfect. Very easy too. I took the advice of others and added more blueberries. Bars held there shape and we're still moist and delicious after a few days. Definitely a keeper.

5-2016. Made this with Cherry Butter plopped over blackberries and it was yummy!   Doing this eliminated cooking the blueberries, and it worked.  Also used Old fashioned Oats.  Will make again.  (Eden loved it)

I made this recipe with 3 cups of blueberries and a bit more sugar. I was afraid it would be too dry, as I made it. I was visiting on vacation in a kitchen that had very few cooking tools. This worked, even with just 2 knives cutting through the flour, butter, and sugar. 3 men in the family are now enjoying each bite, exclaiming how delicious they are.  This size will last for a while!  Tonight we'll eat with ice cream!

A big hit at our neighbor's BBQ. I would have liked to have a little more crumb batter, however...probably because I used about 3 cups of blueberries instead of 2! These were a bit sweet but not TOO sweet. Still, I might consider reducing the sugar next time by 1/4 to 1/2 cup and adding more cinnamon. We served this with vanilla ice cream on top and a guest who says she never even eats dessert had two helpings! You can vary this recipe in many ways, with different fruits, and always know you'll have a delicious dessert.

These were very good. I did make a few alterations. Instead of all white sugar for the crumb I used half  light brown sugar and half white and added a 1/4 teaspoon of penzy baking spice. I put in a teaspoon of vanilla with the blueberry sauce and used 3/4 of the amount of sugar because I used fresh blueberries from my garden and they are sweeter than store bought. Overall it's a keeper.

I didn't have fresh berries but did have canned blueberry pie filling.  Made the crust, spread the pie filling over and then topped with reserved crumbs.  Worked like a charm.  Fast, easy and delicious.  Only had whipped topping but DH is bringing home vanilla ice cream to top another scoop of this fantastic dessert tonight!

The concept here was a good one.  I thought it was too much crumble and not enough blueberry.  And I started out by using almost 3 cups of blueberries rather than 2.  I may try it again sometime but I'll double the blueberry part.

Originally I only gave these 4 stars, but they were better the day after and my coworkers raved about them...I quote "I could eat a whole tray of these!"

Everyone loved these bars... Took authors advice and served them warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream - delish!  I used a full teaspoon of cinnamon to make them extra yummy!!  Note: my blueberry mixture didn't really thicken up so I just scooped out the berries, spread over crust, then drizzled some of the runny juices over them.
