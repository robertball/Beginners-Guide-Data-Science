Nice recipe. I am not a fan of sweet things so I used only half the maple syrup for personal preferences. I will use brown rice syrup the next time though. Needing to watch our salt intake, I used onion powder instead of onion salt and omitted the additional salt all together. We won't be purchasing ketchup anymore! Thank you Valorie for your recipe.

This is my recipe. I just now noticed that when published, All Recipes changed the amount of tomato sauce. IT SHOULD READ 1 (8oz.) CAN TOMATO SAUCE, not 8!

Only changes I made was to substitute honey for the maple syrup and I omitted the onion salt due to allergies. Won't be buying store bought again.

The only reason I gave this 4 stars was because of a few minor changes I made. The foundation of this recipe was spot on. Great consistency. The only changes I made were substituting the maple syrup and coconut sugar for 2 TBSP honey and adding a pinch of paprika and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Hands down a fantastic (healthy) ketchup ... and this is coming from a Heinz 57 ketchup snob. Thanks for the recipe!

New to Paleo, one of my biggest disappointments was losing ketchup.  This recipe will not get you a name brand ketchup flavor on the first try but it gives you full control over your tastes.  I just made this recipe, substituting allspice for pumpkin pie spice (out of necessity) and it came out much better than the expected.  I can understand some of the other comments but I will play around with the ingredients for future batches with smokey paprika and possibly a spicy batch.

Great. I subbed honey for maple syrup because enough I prefer the taste. Left out the rest of sweetener.

This was excellent. I was surprised how flavorful it was. I skipped the coconut sugar, not being a fan of sweet ketchup, and found this to be better than traditional ketchups. I grated some homemade horseradish and added it, along with fresh lemon juice, to make a homemade cocktail sauce. It turned out great.

I made this exactly as indicated but found that the coconut sugar and maple syrup were not complimentary to the recipe. It tasted very off.  When I made it a second time I used simple white sugar and light Karo syrup in place of the coconut sugar and maple syrup and really liked it.

Great texture and consistency.  LOVE that it's paleo! My only complaint is that it smells like maranara. Other than that, it's great. :)  Reading the reviews, it's strange that people changed the recipe then reviewed it as though it were the same recipe...hmmm.  Keep the great recipes coming!

I subbed all of the sweetner for honey (that is what I had handy) and it was very good and super easy to make. Thank you!

The ONLY changes I made was onion powder instead of onion salt and an extra 1/4 teaspoon of maple syrup instead of coconut sugar.  After it cooled I put it in a "brand name" bottle and stuck it in the fridge.  The family had no idea it was paleo, organic and homemade.  They loved it!

I eliminated all of the EXTRA SWEETENERS and eliminated the water.  I used 29 ounce cans and QUADRUPLED the recipe.  I substituted SEASONING SALT for the onion salt.  I added an extra teaspoon of vinegar to make it more liquid.  I was inclined to add more vinegar for a more liquid and more vinegar taste, but my wife said it was PERFECTO.  I didn't cook it, but only warmed it while mixing.

Nice and easy! The other recipes are taking too long, so I chose this one. It took nearly 20 mins. I added some more spices, like ground cloves, cinnamon,ginger, black and white pepper and chili; and took out maple syrup and vinegar. I added both brown and white sugar instead of coconut sugar. I will try with honey next time. The result: I and my wife say, we don't have to go for store's ready made but unhealthy ketchups any more!
