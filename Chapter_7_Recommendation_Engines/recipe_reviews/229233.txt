Not bad.  With the chicken broth, this felt more like a dinner casserole, so I think with some chicken added it would be stellar--and a dinner casserole.  For a breakfast casserole, not enough egg for me, and a tad too much potato.  Hubs really enjoyed it.  I thought it was good but needs some tweaks.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was the BEST breakfast casserole I have ever made.  My family generally doesn't like "egg bake" type dishes because they are dry and flavorless...this one was neither!!  The fresh herbs and the chicken broth gave it excellent flavor!  Next time I would cut back a bit on the broth and add 1 more egg--I had to cook it another 10 mins and let it sit and "set" before serving.  It was rich and creamy--everyone went back for seconds--my step-mother said it was better than my step-sisters, not that she would ever tell her that.  :)

Made this for church, so I only had one bite (sample) before it was devoured. Received many compliments and had multiple requests for recipes. I added extra cheese and cooked it 10 extra minutes under foil to let it firm up. The fresh herbs were a hit and the fact that it was creamy and not loaded down with heavy meats (pork- sausage, bacon and ham).  It is a large recipe. I'm making it for Christmas breakfast tomorrow!
