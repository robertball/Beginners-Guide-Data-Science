I loved this idea and took it a step further and baked a strawberry cake 9X13 and when it cooled took thread and sliced through it.  I put the 1st layer of cake down 1st then the ice cream sandwiches, then cool whip, the rest of the cake and frosted it with cool whip.  Froze for a coupe of hours...Served it with sliced strawberries...my family has ALL requested this cake for their birthdays now...I added a photo because it looked so pretty...thanks for such a great idea KLONGMORE

This ice cream was such a hit and SO easy to make!!  I love the idea of using ice sandwiches as a base and all the options you can create.  Instead of using Cool Whip, which I am not a real fan of, I used name brand ice cream, let it melt for a few minutes and using my hand mixer, I blended in a Butterfinger chocolate bar into the semi-melted ice cream.  I used this as my layer between the ice cream sandwiches and on top.  I also used a loaf pan and lined it with plastic wrap for easy removal of the cake.  Once the ice cream cake was semi-hardened, I drizzled melted chocolate on the top.  My kids loved it and my husband said it was better than Baskin Robbins!
This recipe is a keeper!!  Thank you for sharing it with us all!!

This cake was SO easy and fun to make - and eat! I tweaked the recipe just a bit and added crushed mint fudge grahams between the layers and frosted the cake with softened vanilla ice cream and whipped cream mixed together to make a yummy frosting. I cannot wait to make it again for my husband's birthday.

Absolutely fantastic!!  I made it for Father's Day and everyone raved over it!! I needed A  LOT more than 16 ice cream sandwiches for a 9x13 inch pan, though.  I used Blue Bunny and I used about 30.  Maybe Blue Bunny makes them small, but I would recommend picking up at least 24.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

So easy and scrumptious too!  I used Dove dark chocolate sauce and added raspberries in the center layer.  It took no time to put this together and everyone loved it!

I made this for my daughters 20th b'day instead of buying those expensive cookie cakes, it was a HUGE hit.  I used both the Hot Fudge and Caramel between layers and crushed up butterfingers, her favorite candy. I used a bigger pan, bought 3 boxes of the Walmart brand ice cream sandwiches and had 3 left over. My niece decorated the top and it looked great.  Absolutely delicious.

I added caramel ice cream topping and pecans between layers for a complete indulgement experience.  Decorated the top layer with 3 cherries.  It took two boxes of  ice cream sandwiches to fill the two layers.(I had two sandwiches left over)  I used Blue Bell brand.  It was the talk of the party.  Everyone wanted the recipe. They couldn't believe it was so simple.  My kids are begging me to make it but this time just for home.

This was a HUGE hit at our Mother's Day get-together.  I would give it 10 stars if I could!  Made as written except I drizzled some caramel on top as per suggestion from other reviewers.  They all said "Who needs Dairy Queen!"  I will definitely make this my signature dessert.  I had to use 23 ice cream sandwiches.  For those who said it was too rich perhaps try another hot fudge sauce, remember, you are using a whole can on this!  Thanks so much for the excellent recipe! UPDATE: June 02/06 - Don't share this recipe with anyone, I have our local grocery store talking about it now, and now I can't buy any ice cream sandwiches because they're all sold out ;)

Made this for my kids' birthday parties this summer.  Everyone loves it and it only takes 10 minutes to put together.  I made it the night before which was really convenient  I think the ice cream sandwiches I bought were the standard size of most brands available and I needed 22, not 16, which is my only complaint about this recipe.

You can't beat this for an easy ice cream cake.  My 12 yr old daughter and her friends loved it.  I made as directed except I added carmel sauce also with the fudge sauce.  The adults thought it was missing something so next time will add chopped up candy (snickers), or cookies to add a little punch.  Definately keeping and will make again and again!

This recipe is a great starting point. I made it for my son's 9th birthday and it was a huge hit. I did a layer of chocolate ice cream sandwiches and a layer of vanilla with fudge and crushed oreo cookies in the middle. My frosting was instant chocolate pudding mixed with cool whip. More crushed oreos and drizzled fugge on top. Awesome!

This was a great cake and so very easy!  I used Neapolitan ice cream sandwiches, and they worked great.  It was nice to have the strawberry and chocolate ice cream bites.

I would give this 5 stars for ease and 4 stars for taste.  I actually did something a little different for the cool whip...I mixed 16 oz. cool whip with two-thirds to three-fourths of a carton of  1/2 gallon of vanilla ice cream by mixing it in an electric mixer (obviously, let the ice cream and cool whip soften before you do this).  I used this cool whip/ice cream mixture in place of the 100% cool whip and it worked quite well and tasted quite good.  To add some flavor and color, I crushed up some Butterfingers and sprinkled them in between the ice cream sandwich layers. I did put some caramel topping on that layer as well, but I think I could have left it off just as easily.  This definitely required 24 ice cream sandwiches and I used an aluminum roaster pan as you really need the depth (a normal 9x12 will be too shallow), and this was the perfect size for it all. The layering looked really nice when it is cut into.  Like other posters, you do need to work relatively fast due to melting!  I topped mine off with shaved chocolate bar, but could have also sprinkled it with some leftover crushed Butterfingers...make sure you sprinkle it with these topping just after you make it so it can "set" in the "icing" in the freezer.

I love this recipe but be warned ... candy bars that have a caramel filling will be rock hard after being frozen.

I had to improvise a lot with this recipe because the ingredients listed weren't enough. It needed more ice cream sandwiches than the recipe called for. So I ended up doing only one layer of those.  I poured the chocolate fudge over that and added the entire amount of whipped cream on top of that(it seemed like just enough for one layer, so I'm not sure there would have been enough if I'd done two layers like the recipe called for).  I crushed up some Oreo's and a Milky Way bar and added that to the top, then drizzled the whole thing with caramel.  I was very frustrated making this since it wasn't going as planned, but the kids liked it so I guess I'll make it again...with more ingredients on hand.

Fabulous!I made this for my son's birthday and he gave me two thumbs up.  I used the ice cream sandwiches for the first and third layers.  For the middle, I let about 1/2 of a carton of chocolate ice cream soften and then I put it in my stand mixer with a crushed Butterfinger candy bar.  I frosted it with Cool Whip and drizzled it with fudge sauce.  It was a big hit.

Delicious as is! I have also used the chopped Heath Bar topping for simplicity and a different flavor. Another variation is a Banana Split ice cream cake, using one layer of strawberry and one layer of vanilla (or chocolate) ice cream sandwiches and topping the first layer with pineapple sundae topping, then the cool whip...place the 2nd layer of sandwiches on, spread w/strawberry sundae topping, more cool whip; finish off w/cool whip, drizzle w/hot fudge topping and sprinkle w/ chopped nuts of your choice. I find this recipe is so versatile...so have fun with it!

I made this for my son's 12th birthday.  He is not a cake lover and I thought he might like something like this better.  I'm not sure I've ever made anything that has gone over so well!  My son and his friend declared this the "best cake ever" and it was gone the next day.  Super easy to make, too.  I put chopped peanuts on the top instead of grated chocolate.  My family is already begging me to find an occasion to make this again!  A definite keeper!

Excellent and so easy! I used 18 ice cream bars in two loaf pans. None of us are crazy about whipped topping so I used vanilla ice cream, allowed it to soften then just used a spoon to mixed in shaved almonds, chopped snickers and toffee bits (sold by the chocolate chips). I layered ice cream bars then the ice cream mixture and repeated that again (I did cut the bars to make it fit better in the pan). I also lined the loaf pans with the plastic wrap and that was a great trick thanks Coco2727; I ran hot water over the bottom of the pan and removed the ice cream with the plastic wrap easily. It looked pretty even after it was sliced. I had hot fudge and Carmel for everyone to top their own. It was very sweet but hey it's an ice cream cake with tons of chocolate...but how can you go wrong? Thanks Klongmore for this amazing recipe!

I made this for Christmas and it was the hit of the season...even over the home-prepared Turducken!  We used 21 sandwiches from a box of 24 (cutting some to fit the pan), placed the first layer of ice cream, covered with 1/2 a large tub of Cool Whip, then drizzled heaviliy with caramel topping and sprinkled with two chopped Skor bars.  Repeat layers to finish.  Freeze until firm. Absolutely mouth watering and SO very easy to make!!!  I'm loading a pic of the last piece...that went to the cook (me) :-)

Great Recipe except I changed it slightly.  I used one box of Blue Bunny Ice Cream Sandwiches.  I find one layer is enough.  I crush Oreo cookies and use regular Chocolate syrup.  I layer the sandwiches on the bottom of a 9x13 foil pan.  cover with the crushed Oreo and drizzle on the chocolate syrup.  Cover with the cool whip and sprinkles. Freeze.  My family can't get enough.

I made this cake for our birthday party...my niece (9) and myself...and it was a HUGE hit.  I added my own touches for taste, but other than that I made it as written.  Like other reviewers, I ended up using 23 sandwiches.  The only thing I will change next time is the cool whip as frosting.  It was very messy and melted much quicker than the cake itself.  I think I am going to try using a hand mixer on some ice cream mixed with some cool whip for the frosting next time.  Thank you so much for this receipe.  It was FABULOUS!!!!!!!

So quick to make.
I added drizzled caramel to the top and put crushed Oreos between layers with the fudge.  Everyone asks for the recipe.

I  tried this with layers or caramel rather than hot fudge and then drizzled magic shell chocalate on top before freezing.  I also used mini sandwiches.  Great recipe.  Thanks!

This is a magnificent idea.  The cake comes out looking and tasting luxurious, and it is a simple ice cream cake pie!  Very simple and a huge hit.

My son and I made this together this morning so it would have time to firm up before dessert tonight. We use Neopolitan ice cream sandwiches, as my son thought that would be a nice twist. We didn't bother to grate the candy bar on top. This was a hit with the kids and of course, my husband, the ice cream sandwich lover. I liked the simplicity of this dessert, though I didn't really care for the combination myself. I'd like to try this again and see if I can't add nuts somehow and use regular ice cream sandwiches.

Very very easy and yummy.  I made it for a teenage birthday party and everyone loved it.  I added caramel sauce and pecans.  On the top i sprinkled a crushed, frozen snickers bar.

This was pretty good and VERY simple to throw together.  Because everything is being scaled down, I found I actually needed 9-1/2 ice cream sandwiches in each layer.  We thought it could have used more fudge sauce, maybe almost double, and quite a bit less of the whipped topping.  I think next time, I would only use a 12 oz. tub at most.  Definitely let it freeze all the way.  Our first bite wasn't quite frozen enough and just seemed messy.  Also, use a 9 x 13 pan with high sides, or use the non-stick Reynold's foil, which worked great.  The kids will love this.

This is a great recipe to make ahead of time, and it's very easy too.  I needed 22 ice cream sandwiches to fill the pan.  I used peanut butter ice cream sandwiches for one of the layers and added butterscotch topping  along with the hot fudge.  I also sprinkled toffee bits between the layers and sprinkled the top with chopped kit kat bars.  Some guests thought it was too rich and couldn't finish their pieces, and some came back for seconds.

So delicious and easy to make! This was so much better than a store bought cake. We wanted mint flavor, so  we used Blue Bunny mint grasshopper sandwiches, and put a layer of crushed mint Oreo cookies in the middle. This was an amazing birthday cake, and a keeper for sure, thanks!

I made this for my son's 7th birthday.  I made a small version in a loaf pan since we were leaving on vacation the next day and we didn't want leftovers.  I used 12 ice cream sandwiches (had to trim them to fit).  I did 3 layers with chocolate fudge sauce, chocolate Cool Whip, and mini chocolate chips in between (my son LOVES chocolate!).  I froze it overnight, then flipped it out of the loaf pan the next afternoon and frosted the outside with the rest of the chocolate Cool Whip.  I drizzled chocolate fudge sauce over top, then added sprinkles.  I froze it until party time.  It was a huge hit!  He told me that his "blowing out the candles" wish came true - he had wished for the best birthday cake ever and he got it.  He said, "Thanks for making my wish come true, Mom!"  I'm definitely making this again next year!

Easy and superb!  My husband said "wow, you could sell this!"  Half the recipe fits into an 8" square pan.  It does not have to fit all the way to the sides.  When the Cool Whip squishes out, just smooth it all over like frosting.  Tastes great if allowed to get a little soft, but the layers really show up pretty when you cut into it firm.  I sprinkled it with chocolate sprinkles and made my own fudge sauce.

FABULOUS. I wanted to make a really tasty icecream cake for my daughter's 2nd birthday party, and I was prepared to spend a lot of time and effort doing it! But I came across this recipe, and wow am I glad that I did! It was a definite hit, with kids and adults! I got so many compliments! One woman working at the party told me that she has done 8 parties a week for about a year, and this was the best cake she had ever tasted. Everyone who tried it RAVED about it. And it was SOOOO easy. My two-year-old could even help me make it! I substituted caramel for the top layer of fudge, and added crushed oreos to the middle layer. Delicious!!! The only problem was decorating the cake...cool whip is very slippery when frozen!

Ice cream bars are expensive these days, so I actually made a chocolate cake, then sliced it into 12 slices(like bread) and layered them with soft ice cream and whipped cream.  I used a homemade mocha fudge sauce and topped with nuts and fresh berries.  It was super!  This has become synonymous with birthday cake in our home.

This is the easiest best ice cream cake I've ever made.  This is what all the kids want for their birthday now, and the best part is, the kids can even make their own "mini" cakes while I make the big one, and it's fun.

Wow! Easy and delicious! A winner with the whole family! I made this as written, but it did take 21 ice cream sandwiches to fill up my 9X13 inch cake pan. I cut a few in half to fit. Will be making this one again!

I am not a big dessert person...I can't bake and I don't care much for birthday cake and that is why this recipe looked so interesting when thinking of what to make for my own birthday. I mixed cool whip with the chocolate frosting and put skor bits between the layers...otherwise no real chance. AND Ice cream sandwiches were on sale this week also!! Everyone loved it. Thanks so much for a simple yet creative recipe!!!

I got this recipe from a coworker, and there are so many variations.  I just made this for a 4th of July party.  I separated the cream from a package of oreo cookies.  I crushed up the cookies and folded in the cool whip.  I always put the cool whip on top of each layer of the sandwhiches.  For that you will need about 2 containers.  I mixed a little bit of the cool whip with the oreo cream to make it spreadable.  I spread that directly on the top layer of the sandwhiches prior to the whipped topping.  I crushed up an oreo pie crust on top and melted and drizzled ghirardelli chocholate on top.  This was very rich, but it was gone in hours!!  Photo included

My new go-to dessert for special occassions.  SO EASY!  Everyone loved it.  I sprinkled crushed Butterfinger on top. I'll be buying icream sandwiches everytime they're on sale to have on hand. I used about 10 1/2 sandwiches on each layer.

Another good recipe for energy expended.  Good exactly as written.  This could be even better with suggestions from other cooks.  A little bit of crunch, such as crushed candy bar, m&m, or toasted nuts sounds like a yummy addition.

AMAZING! This cake is great, but for a full-blown treat try carmel topping too! Adding peanuts and substituting Whoppers for the candy bar works wonders. Just put the Whoppers in a Ziploc and pound them with a meat tenderizer! It's quick, simple, and mouthwatering!

This was an incredibly easy and yummy cake!  I've made this cake a few times and it has been wonderful every time.  It's easy to make it a little healthier by using low fat/fat free sandwiches and coolwhip.  This recipe is a keeper.

Amazing!  I actually liked it better the next day when it was more frozen.  It would have been easier to serve outside of the pan.  I think I will make it on a cake board in a pan next time so I can lift it out for a prettier presentation.  Great as is, though.

It is okay, but I suggest adding caramel, or something else to give it more flavor. Pudding in between works too!

This was soooo easy and tasted delicious!  My husband INSISTED that I bought it somewhere.  No one had a clue that it was made from ice cream sandwiches, and I will never tell!

Yummy!  I made this for my Memorial Day picnic and it was a BIG HIT!!!  I used caramel, hot fudge and crushed Oreos in the middle and sprinkled shaved Hershey bars on top...a chocoholics dream!  Can't wait to make again...

I omitted the Cool Whip and added a layer of strawberry ice cream and strawberry sauce between the ice cream sandwiches.  Absolutely delicious and a great presentation too.  No one could tell that it was ice cream sandwiches.  Excellent recipe.  I can't wait to try other flavors of ice cream in the middle!

I have made this several times and no one has guessed it is made w/ i.c. sandwiches.   It is so good - so easy - and so handy as it does not take lots of ingredients or time.

Very good and a fun change of pace. I ended up making homemade fudge sauce since I didn't have any on hand, and it was yummy on this "cake". Easy, a hit with the kids, and quick to put together which always a good thing. For sure needs the full hour in the freezer, and quite rich and fudgy. Thankyou for sharing this!

I took this to my supper club for dessert -- I felt like I was cheating becuase this was so easy.  I have to tell you that EVERYONE asked for the recipe!  This was a huge hit and looked really elegant when sliced.  I'm also sure that a diet version would be great too.

I made this when we had some friends over. The boys loved the ice cream and the adults just loved it! I used 24 ice cream sandwiches and 2 jars of hot fudge. (Can you say chocolate!) This is a sure fire hit that I know I will make again this summer. Thanks for a great idea!

I used 19 bars total but it didn't fill pan all the way to edges. Doesn't really matter because I followed recipe exactly and this dessert was delicious. My whole family agreed and even my nephew, who doesn't like chocolate, LOVED this dessert. Thank you so much for sharing!!!

Loved this recipe!  I made it for the family Christmas meal, and it was a hit!  The wonderful mincemeat pie I had made was left to wait until the next day for my husband and I to eat, as everyone wanted this dessert...oh well, we managed to devour the pie eventually too...no sacrifice too big for us...haha.  I made this dessert as written and give it 5 stars with gusto!

This recipe is great and allows for a lot of creativity and it's easy! I've already made 4 different varieties if this, including the recipe exactly as is, then a chocolate mint, a raspberry chip and a s'more flavored. All delicious!

HUGE hit for the family and so simple to make!  I did follow others advice and get a few more IC sandwhiches....I believe I used 19 in a 9x13 pyrex dish.  I also added keebler grasshopper cookies (crushed) on top of each layer of sandwhiches and chopped andies mints on top of the whipcream....yumm.  My son loves mint and this was a hit for all of us.  Will definitly make again and try different ingredients.

This was fantabulous... made it for a team of 15-year old basketball players, celebrating the end of their season yesterday and it was completely gobbled up. I did use hot fudge sauce and caramel sauce and chopped up heath bar between the layers and on the top. It was a great, low maintenance way to make ice cream cake. Thanks for the recipe!!

I thought this was way too sweet and fake tasting and nothing like an ice cream cake. The kids liked it but the adults gave up after a couple of bites. I won't make this again but if I did I'd make my own fudge sauce w/ bittersweet chocolate. I used Smuckers dark chocolate topping and it was still way, way too sweet and chemical-y tasting.

This is the easiest ice cream cake recipe I have ever tried.  I used banana split ice cream sandwiches and sprinkled chocolate chips on top of the whipped topping before freezing.  My son thought I spent hours on it!

Very good!  It is fun to tweak this based on your own taste.  I needed 24 sandwiches.  I used caramel and fudge sauce, as well as crushed Heath bars to put in between layers and on top.  I purchased all ingredients at Aldi (except Heath) so it was very affordable!

This recipe is great if for no other reason that its sooo simple! I changed it to suit my taste, i omitted the candy bar altogether, I used two containers of fresh raspberries, hot fudge topping, and mixed berry topping. It turned out quite nice.

This cake is superb! I made it for my son's 16th birthday party, and it was a huge hit! Everyone at the party loved it. I even had Mom's phoning for the recipe! I used 24 chocolate ice cream bars, and the same amount of everything else. Try this one, you won't be dissapointed!

I made this for my niece's birthday.  She loved it.  Make sure to have all ingredients ready to go as it will melt if you spend a lot of time on it.  I am only giving this 4 stars as we did not care for the cool whip on the top.  After being frozen it wasn't as tasty when it was time to eat.

Easy to make and looks like you spent hours on those perfect layers! My daughter thinks this is better than the DQ cakes. My husband wouldn't eat it though once he found out it was made from ice cream sandwiches. So.. don't share the recipe with anyone until they've tried it!

Very good, very easy!  So quick to assemble. Made this yesterday and stuck it in the freezer for an Easter lunch dessert for today. It was a hit.  Used 2 whole pkgs of ice cream sandwiches to fill a 9 x 12 pan twice.  Had to eat half a sandwich for each layer - otherwise used them all up.  Also chopped up a Butterfinger bar to sprinkle on each layer of whipped cream (2 bars, one for each layer). The Butterfingers were my daughter's request.  Tasty! Thanks for the recipe.

Make this cake if you love ice cream!  It's so easy and you have many different add-ins to choose.  I used mint chocolate chip ice cream to top the sandwiches then put whipped cream with chopped peppermint patties as garnish.  I'm going to try a mocha flavor. Delicious!

So easy and so delicious.  MAKE SURE that you thaw the cool whip for easy "spreadability".  My Aunt loves peanuts & chocolate, so I mixed in creamy peanut butter with the cool whip and sprinkled chopped peanuts on each layer.

This dessert is amazingly delicious and so easy to make! When you put a slice on someone's plate they have no idea its just an ice cream sandwich! I can't wait to try this with variations such as the neopolitan ice cream sandwiches, with candies in the layers, or crushed Oreo's. Yum!

I make this when I need a quick easy ice-cream type dessert.  This is exactly what it is....an ice-cream sandwich cake with some whipped cream.  It isn't amazing, but it is good.  Thanks for the post.

Really good!  I let the kids help me and they felt like they had just made a real cake!  I used a 16 oz. jar of chocolate fudge sauce and I think that next time I will use even more.  I think that sugared pecans would be great on top and if you add a banana this would taste similar to a banana split.  Very good, thank you!

I made this because my fiancé wanted an ice cream cake and the ones from the store are so expensive, and this recipe seemed very easy. I thought it might be a little boring, just like a plate of ice cream sandwiches, but not at all! It was delicious! After the first layer of fudge I drizzled toffee pieces around, it was so good! It was a huge hit, everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. There's also so much you can do with it, like add candy pieces, wet walnuts. I drizzled the top with caramel too, yummy!!! I know I'll be making this a lot, it was incredible!!!

I make an adult version of this and use Kaluha instead of the fudge sauce and crunched up Heath bars. It is a decadent recipe for sure and always gets rave reviews! Will try the sauce on top of the Kaluha and see if that will add an extra kick!

This quick and easy ice cream cake was a real winner at my house.  I used about 15 ice cream sandwiches total (7 1/2 sandwiches on each layer to fill pan). I used two cartons of Cool whip, one per layer.  This had a very nice finished look, too.

I would rate this dessert a 5 star! It was wonderful! I made it for Father's Day yesterday, and everyone loved it! I added Hershey's Almond and Hershey's caramel candy between layers and pecans and the Chocolate Fudge topping as well as the Caramel topping! Otherwise, followed the recipe. Thank you for a great Ice Cream cake that was simple and fast!!!

Really good! I made this in an 8x8 pan using a total of 11 ice cream sandwiches and exactly half the amounts of whipped topping and chocolate. It filled the pan to the top. Delicious. And super fast/ easy!

The biggest hit of the Christmas Eve dinner!  With the huge array of cookies and desserts, everyone spent their time eating this ice cream cake.  Followed advice of others and mixed the whipped cream with softened vanilla ice cream.  Drizzled simple chocolate syrup on top... and presto!  The perfect all-season dessert.  My new favorite non-baked dessert!

I've made this for a summer picnic and everyone went bananas over it.  It was easy to make.  Next time I will try making it a "turtle" ice cream cake by adding carmel and pecans.  Yum!

This recipe is great, but I added my own twist.  I had to make dessert for Pokeno night, so I wanted something little different.  Between the layers and on top, I added the sweet/salty pecan topping, Ice cream topping shell - both caramel and chocolate. OMG, it was fantastic.  I make them ahead in throw away pans, wrap them tightly in foil, and I have a dessert good enough to take anywhere. Will keep about 2-3 weeks, if not unwrapped.

I doubled all of the ingredients for this and used chocolate Cool Whip and decorated with mini- M&M's - for 2 birthday cakes - this was a total crowd pleaser and so easy!

This was so easy to make and it was a huge hit at my office party!  I am a disaster in the kitchen and this recipe is impossible to mess up. I put crushed candy bar in between the layers for some texture.

I made this for my son's 12th birthday.  I made it exactly as written, and it was delicious!  I think it is a very versatile recipe, and you can really customize it to your taste.  I was thinking that it would be good with Nutella between the layers instead of hot fudge.  I might have to give that a try sometime!

I 'tweeked" it a little.  I did the bottom layer of sandwiches with the ones that have chocolate ice cream and crushed up girl scout "Thin Mint" cookies on top of the fudge, then did the vanilla sandwiches for the second layer and topped the whole thing with more cookies!  Yum!!!

This recipe is easy, fun, and tastes GREAT. We made this for a thanksgiving potluck, and it was easy, and fun to decorate with the kids (we made a turkey out of m&ms). We just substituted the chocolate for oreos, since we didnt have any in the house. It may not taste exactly like ice cream cake, but it's still gonna taste amazing!

A friend of mine shared a similar recipe and I tried it.  It is easy and simple.  She sprinkled Heath Bar crunch (found in bags in the baking section) on top of the whipped topping.  Try it because it is delicious!

This was phenomenal and super easy...A HUGE hit! I did tweak it...I doubled the filling recipe and layered 6 sandwiches on the bottom with the filling on top then layered the other 6 with the remaining filling on top and then spread the whipped cream over the filling and on the sides.  Will definitely make again! Everyone thought it was store bought.

My coworker made this for a potluck last week.  She used crushed Skor bars in the layers.  Cutting it up, you would never know that this was made with ice cream sandwich bars. The layers looked great and it tasted spectacular. The cake stood up to being in room temperature during the party and didn't melt for quite a while.

This was good, but not great. We didn't use the peanut butter...the idea seemed kind of weird to me. We doubled the hot fudge, and used vanilla ice cream instead of whipped topping. We crushed several frozen snickers bars and put them in the vanilla ice cream layers. The kids loved it, but I wasn't crazy about it. Definitely needs more than an hour to freeze (at least if you're using ice cream instead of whipped topping). Easy to make though, and pretty good. Fun!

Made this for my son's birthday, it was a big hit! This will be a staple at all the future birthdays! I only used one box of ice cream sandwiches and used one gallon of my son's favorite ice cream. I put the fudge and used cookie crumbs as layers. Yum!

OMG! This is great. Very rich. Fun to make. I used mint Oreos between the layers, and the Dove dark chocolate sauce like a couple of other reviewers.

My husband now puts this recipe OVER one his mom has named "Keven's Favorite Chocolate Delite" - I told him NOT to tell her!! It is fabulous with Butterfinger on top! You can also do one layer of each and it is still fabulous!

I did mix the ice cream with the cool whip. Made it for my daughter's b-day whose been eating DQ cakes (yuck) for the past 12 years. I really wanted to try something different because I personally dislike DQ but it needed to be an ice cream cake.  Everyone went crazy over this cake and my daughter who just turned 14 says this is what she wants for her b-day every year.  WOW - thanks for this recipe!

Have made this several times now, substituting homemade whipped cream for Cool Whip, and crushing "Heath" or "Skor" bars over the two layers.  I find two boxes of regular sized ice cream sandwiches to work but with some creative cutting.  Family loves this!

This was pretty good for such an easy dessert.  I didn't add any extras, but I love the idea of using m&ms, or other types of candy.  Thanks for the recipe!

5 stars, 10 stars, 50 stars!!! This was AMAZING!!! I made it for my birthday party.  I am one of the slowest cooks in the world and it only took me 30 minutes to get it in the freezer.  It turned out great regardless of the fact that it was melting when i was making it.  The only subsitutuion i used was whipped cream from a can instead of whipping cream or whatever you were supposed to use.  It is true that this recipe calls for more than 16 bars (I used 24 and still had some room leftover) but that doesn't matter cuz it tastes SO good! Thank you for this recipe.  :)

This is so gosh darn yummy!  I used a 12 x 8-1/2" metal pan (with a sliding lid) and used 23 of a 24-pack Nestle Ice Cream Sandwich box, cutting to fit edge to edge, then spread hot fudge chocolate sauce, ran some Ghiradelli Caramel Sauce on top of that, then the Cool Whip and then did it all over again!  I crushed up two SKOR bars and sprinkled them on top and stuck it in the freezer, twiddling my thumbs while waiting for it all to freeze! (actually it was the next day that I tried it)  Very easy to make and it was delicious!!!  It is very forgiving, and so easy to add other flavors to it.

So easy and delicious. Made this with my 5 yr old grandson and we had a ball. I did mix vanilla ice cream with the whipped topping and iced the two layers with this. What's not to like...ice cream, candy bars, chocolate sauce! Hubby said best dessert he's had!

This recipe saved the day! I had not ordered the ice cream cake in time for my daughter's birthday, so I looked for a recipe I could make at 10pm the night before the party. After a quick trip to the store to get the ice cream sandwiches, I had this done by 11pm. The kids and parents loved it! I used a layer of vanilla sandwiches on the bottom, then instead of plain whipped cream used a mixture of chocolate pudding and whipped cream, and then did a layer of strawberry sandwiches with plain whipped cream on top. I mistakenly used chocolate syrup in between the layers instead of chocolate fudge, so mine ended up being a bit messy. It still tasted great!

No changes though your photo seems to show caramel sauce on top. :)

I made it for my son's 16th Birthday.  It received rave reviews by his friends, brother and my husband.  It was delicious!

The beauty of this recipe is it's simplicity and I would make it again.  I might even experiment with the sauces. :)

This ice cream cake was a huge hit at a birthday party. I took vanilla ice cream and let it soften, then stirred in crushed Oreos. I used that for the middle layer in between in the ice cream sandwiches. I know I will be making this again... super easy and unbelievably delicious!

Was a total hit with our family and very easy to make.  Next time I think I'll try and use melted peanut butter for one of the layers.  Definitely a keeper.

This cake is delicious. I changed a couple of things, though. I had to use more than 16 ice cream sandwiches, and I had to cut up some to make them fill up the 9x13 pan. Then, I mixed the hot fudge sauce with the whipped topping to make it chocolate-y. That might have been the best part of the cake. Finally, instead of sprinkling a grated chocolate bar over the top of the cake, I decided to cut up some peanut butter cups and sprinkle those over the top. It was a bit hard to cut them up, but they tasted much better than I think a plain chocolate bar would. This cake was my birthday cake  and I made a great choice. This cake is delicious and you can't mess it up! ;)

Loved it!!! So yummy! Only suggestion would be that if you want to fill the entire 9x13" pan, buy extra ice cream sandwiches! I used 20, and I had to cut the sandwiches into pieces to fill in around the edges. However, with a thick layer of cool whip on top, you really couldn't tell. Great recipe!

So good!!! Followed advice of others and used half cool whip and half ice cream, then folded crushed Oreos.  Definitely needed 24 ice cream sandwiches and a deep 9x13 baking dish.  Thanks for this easy and delicious recipe!!

Love this recipe! I used Reddi-Whip (in the can) with softened vanilla ice cream for the frosting and it worked out great. Decorated with Magic Shell on top.  I will definitely be making this again.  It was a big hit with adults and children both.

It looks amazingly easy to assemble and probably addictive to consume. Although given the obesity crisis that we are at war with, it contains way too much processed ingredients. Seems the less convenient the more healthy. The old fashioned natural ingredients remain the tastiest and even with the extra fat, our immune systems recognize and digest the nature made ingredients and tend to store in our organs the man made ingredients. That explains the many detox commercial solutions.

So Good!!!  This was super easy and was a huge hit for our family gathering.  I added crushed mint Oreos in the middle.
Special request were made for this to be a holiday dessert with crushed peppermints.  I also think that a dot of red food coloring mixed in the whipped cream for the middle layer would make a nice appearance for Christmas!

This ice cream cake is so good! I made it for my daughter's 18th birthday.  I used Sander's hot fudge and crumbled Heath bar.  It was delicious - the ice cream bars are like cake and ice cream with all the other yummy toppings!  Definitely a keeper of a recipe!

good idea. I made the first layer from the Best Brownies recipe and frosting then I layered cool whip, then cut 6 ice cream sandwiches of different types( mint choc, birthday,ect) in half and arranged them in 3 rows of then topped with cool whip, followed by sprinkles & marshmallows.

I tweaked this recipe a bit to make it my own.  I have a friend that loves mint, so we used mint chocolate chip ice cream bars, a mint hot fudge topping, and chopped up 3 Musketeers Mints to go on the top.  It wound up good, but very intense!  The frosting was a bit much, as some people commented that they felt like they had just brushed their teeth.  Next time, I'll do it with only some of the mint components, but not all.

Was good, my kids made this for b-day, & they all liked, & had a blast making it themselves. We grated 1 hersheys chocolate candy bar on top. I would put a little less whip cream in next time, it doesn't need quite this much.

I'm not a big fan of ice cream sandwiches, but this is really  good and my family loves it.  I bought Great Value (walmart) sandwiches: one sugar-free and one regular.  I also used light GV whipped topping.  I ended up using 19 i.c. sandwiches in all.  I also forgot to buy the chocolate bar, so I used my Pampered Chef grater to grind up some chocolate chips and that worked perfect.  This is addictive stuff!

excellent. I made this cake for a cookout and everyone absolutely loved it. My brother in law ask me where I got it and was suprised when I told him I made it. I have added M&M and reese's ice cream topping and crushed up oreos. I used both chocolate sryup and peanut butter. This is one of my new favorite recipes.

So good and so easy!  I'll never waste my time/money on store bought ice cream cakes.  My relatives couldn't believe I made it.  I used two full boxes of sandwiches to line a 13 x 9.  Next time, I probably would make it in a smaller pan and use less.  It was SO filling and more than enough for 6 adults 4 young kids.  We had almost half leftover (but that's ok). Thanks for the great recipe.

Tried this for my daughters birthday. It was awesome! she likes chocolate mint so I crushed up about 5 mint oreos and put them on after the fudge for both layers which was the only change. FABULOUS!

I just finished making this for my daughter's 6th birthday today.  It was so easy & I just know it's going to be a hit tonight.  I used most of the kids' easter candy for the chocolate & instead of sprinkling it on top, I put it in the middle on top of the hot fudge.  I also used caramel in the middle in addition to the hot fudge.  I put sprinkles on top & her candles will fit in there nicely.  I think my guests will be impressed & it really was quite simple.

This recipe was simple AND delicious!  My daughter doesn't like cake, but LOVES ice cream sandwiches.  We just celebrated her 3rd birthday and her cake was a HUGE hit - for the parents and kids!!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!  It will definitely become a birthday tradition.

I made this for Easter and it was a huge hit!  I put fudge and carmel inbetween the layers. I put easter m&m's on the top.  I did use 24 ice cream sandwiches - 8 in each layer.  Also wanted to point out when using the cool whip it is too hard to spread frozen. I popped it in the microwave and it was much easier to work with!

This will go into our dessert rotation - it was very good, very rich. We added a layer of caramel and used Snickers candy on top. Delish!

This is a great easy cake and beats paying $30-$40 for a store cake.  Change it up with M&M heath bars or Nuts lots of possibility.

This is the absolute BEST recipe!  It's a snap to put together, and tastes like the expensive ice cream cakes from the store.  I've made this for several occasions, always tweak it a little with different additions...and everyone loves it!

I LOVE this recipe!!!  It's easy and fun and best of all it tastes great.  Guests at my house had no idea how I had made it and even if they were stuffed from the meal, the cake was irresistable.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe to take when you forgot you needed a dessert!! I bought ingredients and assembled at work in a foil pan. Very easy and Very kid-friendly. I doubled the ice cream sandwiches to 24 (as noted in other reviews). Also, I used Reese's pieces crushed as the topping. In the future, I'll probably try the other topping suggestions in the other reviews.
