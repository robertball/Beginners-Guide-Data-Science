This was tasty! I really enjoyed the combo of flavors and textures. I wasn't sure about the dressing at first but once combined with everything else it was fine. I did add some sea salt and fresh cracked pepper. This was nice and I felt good eating it. I would make this again and add some thinly sliced red onion too! Thanks for sharing.:)
