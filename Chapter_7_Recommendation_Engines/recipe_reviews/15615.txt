Liked this dressing, but it was just a little too sweet for us.  Next time, I will start with half of the sugar, and add more if necessary.  I wanted to be sure that  I didn't have pieces (even small ones) of garlic and onion in my dressing, so I pureed everything EXCEPT the oil in the food processor, and then streamed in the oil through the top of the processor while it was running.  Ended up with perfectly smooth dressing with a good  consistency.

This is tangy and tastes divine. I used garlic powder and onion powder in lieu of fresh; this way it keeps for several weeks in the fridge.

Made this as written.  HOWEVER: dang but it's sweet!  It reminds me of what used to be called Catalina French dressing.  I only made half the recipe and am glad cuz it makes a lot.  Next time I'll cut the sugar down considerably. I ended up adding some lemon juice to reduce the sweetness.

This is a tasty dressing. I started out adding less sugar than the recipe called for, but after tasting, added the rest.  I grated the onion and garlic to avoid having chunks in the dressing. This is nice and tangy and slightly sweet, just like a good French dressing should be.

I recently decided to start making ALL salad dressings from scratch, and boy am I glad I did! This dressing is awesome! It has a little kick to it, and is SO good on cold, crisp greens. Everyone raved about this dressing!

I used vegetable oil. I told my french boyfriend that this is French salad dressing, which doesn't mean anything to him. He said it is a 'sweet and sour' sauce.

Fabulous dressing. I've made it a few times and reduce the sugar by about 25%. I also use olive oil which I happen to always have on hand. No reason to use bottled dressing again.

Super delicious and a huge hit over Memorial Day.  The recipe makes quite a lot of dressing so you might want to cut it in half.  Cut the amount of onion in half, used a sweet Vidalia for it and also didn't have sunflower oil so used Extra Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead.  I would have used canola but didn't have any and I wouldn't suggest using just Extra Virgin Olive Oil as it would really impact the taste.  Also made it in a blender for ease.

Very good as is, but also very sweet.  My son will love it but I'll cut the sugar back by at least half before serving to adults.

WOW!!! Why have I waited so long to make this dressing, it's FABULOUS!!! The only changes I made were to reduce the sugar because I knew it would be too sweet for my taste if I didn't. I reduced it to 3 tablespoons and it was perfect. This is now my "go-to" French dressing. Thanks so much for sharing!!

I made this and since our household aren't fans of too spicy, I used paprika or ground red pepper to taste.  This has been a hit at our dinner table and several pot lucks.  Would definitely share with others.  I often bring printed copies to pot lucks and there are never extras to throw away or pitch.

This  is a sweet Catalina-style French dressing that simply blows away bottled alternatives. I made it in a food processor, by chopping the onion and garlic, then adding everything else and blending it for 30 seconds.  

I used extra garlic, because what I had was not really fresh. I used olive oil, which was still  fine.  All the other ingredients were as per the recipe.

The result is spicy when new -- and I like that.  It calms down after a day in the fridge. It took me 5 minutes in total, mostly getting ingredients. Simple and really easy to "adjust", and darned good. Half the sugar still works well.

Delicious! Thankfully, I read the reviews first and decreased the sugar. I also used dried onion and garlic powder because I want it to stay fresh longer, but if I make for a big dinner, I plan to use fresh. Very versatile recipe, so although I made minor tweaks, I gave it five stars. Add a little cilantro and use it on a taco salad, add Italian herbs and put on pasta, etc. Thanks, Fran!

I love this recipe!  Thanks.   I use plain vegetable oil or canola oil.  I also use a food processor.  first time I made it, I whisked everything together, but using a blender/food processor is so much easier.  Whirl all ingedients together & then slowly stream in oil.  Beats buying a big bottle of store dressing, when I can adjust this recipe for as many servings as I need.

I LOVED this recipe!  It absolutely bursted with flavor and the cayenne pepper added a little kick that made it even more interesting.

This dressing is delicious, I can keep up with making it for my family. I used it for a glaze on chicken breasts and legs also. I substituted safflower oil and plain white vinegar yummy!
