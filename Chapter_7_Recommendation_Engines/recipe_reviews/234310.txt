This was a very easy recipe for fig preserves, I added Splenda instead of sugar, my husband is diabetic and he loved them. Irma Dark

I had 5 pounds of cleaned figs frozen in my freezer for years. I needed freezer space so I thawed the figs in a zip bag and warm water, chopped them up,  and made your recipe. I made a batch with strawberry jello AND one with raspberry jello also. One thing, when the figs-sugar-jello mix is cooking it tried to scorch so I added 3/4 cup of the fig juice left in the bottom of the zip bag. Made things a lot easier. I've been using my jam on cinnamon/raisin toast with cream cheese for a breakfast treat. I'm a guy and I've been canning since I was a kid.

Do I need to peel the figs? Can I substitute crushed pineapple and pineapple jello for the strawberries? My grandmother  used pineapple to stretch the recipe but I don't have her recipe.

Sounded to simple so I had to try it. Worked great and tastes good. It is a clear, simple flavored jam.
