Loved this salad! What a great alternative to eating empty lettuce that's all water, whereas kale and chard have so many great vitamins and minerals!   I followed the other reviews in cutting the amount of vinegar in half in the dressing, and it came out perfectly.

Great salad; but I would cut the vinegar to 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup of oil.  I added 1 tsp sugar, Craisins and toasted pine nuts.

Great recipe but way too much vinegar.  I will cut in half next time.  I had to add sugar to each bowl of my salad in order to get this down - way too much vinegar for me but I liked the recipe otherwise.  My husband, on the other hand, loved this recipe and ended up eating majority of it!

This was delicious. I thought the vinegar was fine, be sure you use apple cider vinegar. I substituted the walnuts for candied walnuts, goes great with the feta and raisins. Next time I may try dried cranberries. I like that this is a nice change from the usual romaine lettuce, getting plenty of leafy greens..makes it for a hearty salad chock full of nutrients.

This is one excellent salad, with a nutritional quality that surpasses ANY lettuce salad. I would double or triple the raisins and especially the walnuts (if you can afford them, lol).

This salad is amazing!  I didn't have any swiss chard so I substituted a herb mix.  I kept the same amount of vinegar as what the recipe asked for, but I used Light Corn Syrup instead of honey (didn't have any and it added more sweetness to cut the vinegar).  Really good!  Definitely a keeper!

My husband claimed it was the best salad he's ever had.  We replaced the chicken with seitan since we don't eat meat and the raisins with Craisins.  Super yummy!

Love this! I did follow the advice of the other reviews and cut the vinegar in half, but only after I tasted the exact recipe. Other than that I followed it exactly! It's a great "house salad" dressing. The kale, Swiss chard, and feta tasted amazing with this dressing!! Thanks for sharing!

This is a beautiful, delicious salad. I subbed spinach for the chard, and left out the cheese. Also used garlic olive oil and fresh oregano. I didn't measure the dressing ingredients, just put a tiny bit of each into a bowl and added enough greens for one salad. I ended up adding another dash of cider vinegar. I used rosemary, paprika, and red pepper roasted chicken.  I thought I wouldn't care for the raisins, but they were perfect- salty and sweet. The salad would be still be great without the chicken. This reminds me of the salads served at an upscale restaurant where I used to work. Greens, fruit, chicken or fish, cheese, a sweet and tangy vinaigrette, and nuts all combined perfectly to make so many delicous salads!

Tried the recipe as it is and is very good. I have a great store near me, Oro, which sells great blends of olive oils as well as balsamic vinegars. This recipe good with all different mixtures I came up with so do experiment or use the dressing you like.

I love this salad with the dressing made exactly as written, using the oregano as suggested!  I was thinking that I might add a little Dijon to the dressing for the next time I make this.  I love the combination of kale and Swiss chard.  Actually this is the first time I've used Swiss chard in a salad, and I will buy it often now, whereas I have LOVED kale in a salad because it holds dressing so well!  The raisins I used were golden raisins, but you could easily use any dried fruit--or fresh fruit for that matter--that you like.  The cheese I chose to use tonight was blue cheese.  I will make this salad again!  Thanks!

This salad was fabulous, and just what we needed after the holidays and too many sweets!  I subbed a thinly sliced bosc pear for the raisins since my daughter doesn't like raisins, and used red wine vinegar in the dressing.  Used marinated feta.  Otherwise no changes.  Super good!

Excellent.  I'll be using Swiss Chard and Kale instead of lettuce as much as possible from now on.  The dressing was great.  I took many others suggestion and reduced the cider vinegar by half.

Excellent salad, possibly the best and my wife thought so too! I used white wine vinegar instead of cider and added some sesame seeds, chia seeds, and sesame oil as well as about a tbsp of dried lemon peel and dash of chili powder.  I used dates instead of raisins which paired really well with the feta and toasted walnuts. I also didn't have any chard so I put in some red cabbage.

This is great!  used half the apple cider vinegar, added a smooch more honey, used Craisins instead of raisins and pecans instead of walnuts (didn't have raisins or walnuts).  Spaced out on the feta on the first helping and it was still delicious.  Added the oregano and salt to the chicken and grilled it.    

Our new favorite.  Going to try steak and salmon someday.

Our kale & chard are going crazy in the garden currently! And I needed to find a different way to use them as I already do a green smoothie in the morning, have made kale chips and it was still coming out my ears. This salad was perfect; I used the Greek-Style Garlic Chicken Breast recipe (also on this site) for the grilled chicken and I used red grapes instead of raisins as I had them in the fridge to use up. Thank you Bettebet for saving me from drowning in greens, awesome recipe :)

I thought this had too much vinegar

I added strawberries and that made it into a great salad! But it needs the strawberries.

Simple and nutritious, but it left a strange feeling in my mouth.  My mouth felt dry/rough/I don't know how to describe it.  Maybe it's the dressing?

I used what I had on hand: swiss chard, carrots, celery, fresh mint, asiago cheese.  The dressing is really great with the heartier greens.  I let the greens soak in the dressing while I cooked the chicken.  This is a really good and versatile salad.

I thought this was pretty good, but with just plain grilled chicken it was a little bland. The dressing was good and the flavors blended nicely, though.

I don't usually care to eat raw kale, but the dressing makes this a very lovely salad.  I love the nutrition of the kale, so this is a great way to enjoy it; thanks!!
