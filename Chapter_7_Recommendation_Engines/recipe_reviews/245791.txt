I doubled the recipe except for the eggs, only used two and increased the oil for moisture. I used coconut oil. Didnâ€™t have stevia so I used a tablespoon of organic sugar. My partner is a buckwheat lover and gave these 5 stars.

I made these for my child, he gave the 2 star rating, but gobbled them up, so go figure. I tweaked the recipe, inspired by other reviews:  doubled the oil, subbed organic 2% cow milk for soy, used 10 drops of liquid stevia instead of the powdered. To boost nutrition and moisture I added half a mashed banana, and the only spice used was nutmeg because I think that marries better with the banana flavor. To increase the kid appeal I threw in a handful of mini chocolate chips. Very easy to make, will add these to our regular breakfast menu.

I made it without milk (water only) coconut oil instead of olive, no cloves, no pumkin spice, but double the cinnamon.  For the waffles to be not dry you need to load the batter quickly and close it. otherwise it does not come out right! I watching my sugars, and this is great grain free recipe!

This was a good base recipe but I was bothered by their not being actual pumpkin in it.  I swapped out one of the eggs and the oil for pumpkin  and also used almond milk instead of soy.

I don't care for the taste of stevia so reduced the amount of sweetener to 1 tablespoon and used some vanilla sugar I had on hand. (Sugar that's been sitting with a vanilla bean in it.)  It was still plenty sweet.

We'll be making this again!

Pretty good recipe. Mine came out a little dry, so I doubles the oil and added a tablespoon of applesauce.
