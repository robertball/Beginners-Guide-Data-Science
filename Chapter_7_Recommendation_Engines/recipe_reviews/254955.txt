Delicious! I did scale the recipe back b/c while I LOVE eggplant in any form, the family does not. :( I did use my own sauce that I already had made, but followed the recipe otherwise. My mom makes something very similar to these and I love them, so I knew I was gonna love these too. I topped mine w/ shredded mozzarella before baking~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this the other night and it was very tasty! My whole family (vegetarians + carnivores) loved it (although I did add ham to some of the roll-ups for the carnivores). I agree with other reviewers' comments about how long it took to make (frying the eggplant took a lot longer than I expected, although I really liked using the ziploc bags to help with the breading). Frying the eggplant also took me somewhat more than 1/4 cup of oil, so be aware of that. Overall, though, yum!

This was a tasty meatless dish. My husband actually really liked it.  I had a hard time cutting the eggplant 1/4" and so mine ended up a little fat which made them harder to roll.  There was a ton of directions and even though I am a pretty fast cook this took me around 1 1/2 hours to make and clean up all the dishes.  So do this when you have plenty of time to cook but the dish was enjoyable and a nice change of pace from the typical dinner ideas.  If I would change anything it would be to cut the salt in half because it did seem slightly salty.

This was more work than I bargained for, but it turned out so well I will make it again.  You could take some of the shortcuts suggested in other reviews, but I do think the homemade sauce is key to the great flavor. I wasnâ€™t able to roll the eggplant into pinwheels, so I layered the ingredients as another reviewer suggested . Next time I will make the sauce the day before to cut down on kitchen time.

I will definitely make this again.  My son is a meat and potatoes kind of guy and he really liked this.  He even went back for seconds!  I did make some changes.  I selected this recipe because I had several boxes of frozen sliced Italian breaded eggplants.  I fried the eggplants as per the recipe, but because they were sliced the short way, I l layered them in my baking dish, kind of spread the cheese and egg filling on top, layered the rest of the eggplant slices on top, and then poured the sauce.  It saved me about half an hour doing it that way.  I will definitely be making this again!  (PS:  I like spicy so I put some curry powder just on mine to try, and it was really good!  The flavors blended well together!)

This seemed to take FOREVER to prepare 
I will probably not make it again for that reason alone
Otherwise all other ten people at my table really liked it, I was indifferent at that point, too tired to eat it...
