I skipped the raisins in this salad and added a layer of halved cherry tomatoes and a little more bacon. I also used broccoli instead of broccoflower only because I could not find broccoflower here. We all thought this salad was very good. I wasn't sure that we'd like the dressing but everyone liked it, even my kids. The beer was a little overpowering, next time I would cut it back a bit.

My girlfriend's husband was having a birthday party and when I asked her what to bring she said "you know Nate, anything that includes beer, bacon and cheese". So I found this recipe, which sounded like there was some good things thrown in with the cheesebeerbacon combo. Shockingly, it was really good!. One of the guys at the party actually made an effort to say how much he really liked it. I really liked the salad too and will probably make it again for a potluck. Yumm.

This was the first layers salad I've made.  I made it the night before a family reunion as the recipe says it can be made the night before.  It totally ruined it.  It was way too wet.  I only ate a couple of bites and was embarrassed that I'd brought it.  Even though I think it might be okay made the day of I probably won't go to the work as it is quite a bit of work.

Really great recipe! My brother in law has just asked me to make it a second time. It's the first time I've seen a layered salad almost finished at a party. Hardly any leftovers. I didn't use the raisins, didn't have any. Might try them tomorrow for fun. I think this might be good with olives too.
