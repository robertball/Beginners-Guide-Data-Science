Having made raspberry ice cream many times, I know that the seeds are a real bummer, so I already knew I'd be making some changes to this recipe just as a matter of personal preference.  I macerated 3 c. berries with 3/4 c. sugar and a tablespoon or so of water, stirring them every so often until the berries released their juices. I then pureed them in my food processor and sieved them through a fine mesh strainer, leaving the seeds behind. Wanting a richer, silkier, custard-style ice cream, I beat 2 eggs for a minute or two until thick and lemon colored, slowly added another 3/4 cup of sugar, then whisked in the cream, half and half and vanilla. I got the extra richness I was after without all the trouble of a cooked custard. I mixed this with the sieved raspberry puree and chilled the mixture for several hours before churning.  The result was a creamy, rich, perfectly pink ice cream with good raspberry flavor without the annoying seeds.  However, I think 2 tsp. of vanilla somewhat masked the raspberry flavor, so when I make this again I'd reduce it to 1 tsp. or not even use it at all.

I did this recipe two times and it was delicious!
Two things to pay attention to:
- If you like it very fruity (like me) you can double the amount of raspbery easily.
- Don't blend the fruits completely since you will be left with all the little cores the raspberrys have. It will also seem more fruity when the raspberry are only a little mashed up.

delicious and super simple. I found the directions to be silly though: You should always dissolve sugar in the liquid before getting it chilled in your ice cream maker otherwise its a real pain to dissolve! I threw everything in my blender, minus the sugar, and then stirred the mix w/ sugar in a bowl till dissolved then transferred it to my ICmaker.   Made a super low cal version with all fat-free half n half and Xylitol instead of sugar and it was AMAZING and lower cal than most yucky lite ice creams at the store! will make again and again!

I'm sorry to say that I was very disappointed in the way this turned out.  The berry flavor was extremely weak but the worst part about this ice cream was the texture.  I felt like I was eating raspberry Cool Whip.  In the future, I will avoid using ice cream recipes that call for whipping cream.  This was just not worth the calories and I won't make it again.

Wonderful! I followed the suggestion to double the rasberries, and it got rave reviews at a dinner party. The second time I made it I also added chocolate chunks, and it was also delicious.

BEST HOMEMADE ICE CREAM THAT WE HAVE MADE!!! I even made it seedless!! It was very full of raspberry flavor, and it was also rich and creamy not icy like ice milk. It just came out wonderful.  Changes I made: 1. I used four 6oz. cartons of fresh raspberries (it equals about 4 cups of raspberry if you really stuff them into the measuring cup) which is basically doubling the amount of berries  2. After blending the berries in the blender, I then strained it through a wire mesh strainer. You have to kind push, and swirl the sauce around with a spatula, to get it through the mesh past the seeds. But the result is a seedless raspberry sauce that makes a wonderful ice cream. I was amazed at how many seeds were left behind (about 1/2 of just seeds) and very excited that they wouldn't be in my ice cream.

OH MY, Can you say Raspberry Chocolate Chip Luscious?! With VERY subtle additions, you can too!  Following the previous raters' advice (naples34102 ) by beating 2 eggs 1-2 minutes, macerate 2/3 cup sugar with 1 tbsp water into berries.  Refrigerate for about an hour  before pulverizing in blender and removing the seeds with a tightly woven strainer. BE PATIENT, push the pulp through without letting the seeds through.  Blend 3/4 Cup sugar into the beaten eggs, added 2 3/4 cups heavy cream with 1/4 cup 2% milk, 1 Tsp vanilla extract and whipping until smooth.  Then I melted 2-4oz Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate bars and folded the melted chocolate into the cool mixture.  Refridgerated for a couple of hours before putting into the electric ice-cream maker. AMAZING!! This is my prepared dessert for Girls night out and  is SURE to please.

Simple, but wonderful.  We had many berries left over from last year - what a wonderful way to use them.  I used Splenda in place of the sugar and could not taste a difference.

Ok, I admit that I changed this enough that it doesn't resemble the original.. But it turned out so great, that I would like to share my changes.. I did use 1C of sugar ( I used organic ) and 3C of heavy cream. I scalded these two, then added 2 beaten eggs, which I tempered first.I cooked ( but not boiled! ) it over low heat, stirring constantly, until it coated the back of a spoon, about 10 min.Then I added 1t. of vanilla. I pureed 3 C of fresh raspberries in a blender, and then pushed them through a sieve to remove most of the seeds. I added this to the cooled custard,and chilled it for 4 hours. I used my kitchenaid ice cream maker to freeze it..VERY creamy, like a frozen custard...and very yummy!

Very good!  I took this to an old fashioned ice cream social and it was a big hit.  The seeds didn't seem to bother anyone - there wasn't any left to bring home!

Delicious, rich ice cream. I pureed two 10 ounce packages of frozen raspberries and then strained them through a mesh strainer. I then cooked the sugar with the raspberry puree and cooled the mixture before mixing it with the other ingredients. I omitted the vanilla because I feel it makes the raspberry flavor less bright. My husband had requested raspberry ice cream with chocolate swirls, so after processing the mixture in the ice cream maker, I layered the semi-soft ice cream with fudge sauce before freezing it hard in the freezer. Wonderful.

As one reviewer noted, it tastes a bit (just a bit) like Cool Whip.  I will look for a recipe that doesn't call for as much whipping cream.  But overall - super yummy!

I wanted to add to my review ... I didn't puree the frozen raspberries.  I let them thaw so as to get the juice and smashed them ... preferring bits of raspberry.  There were no seeds.

I made this mostly as directed but found it too creamy and not nearly enough raspberries -- even though I used about 3.5 cups. Like one reviewer said, the ice cream tasted kind of like Cool Whip. I was really hoping for the tang and depth of flavor that you get in a good raspberry ice cream. My kids liked it, though.

Delicious.  Creamy, fruity and fun!

Couple notes:
-I increased the raspberries to 2 pints
-I pushed the raspberry puree through cheesecloth to get rid of as many seeds as possible
-I mixed everything together with the sugar in a bowl, not in the ice cream maker.

Being new at this, I was dreading de-seeding the raspberry puree after blending, but actually, found it a breeze.  With a five-inch fine sieve, I happened to use an old spatula.  After methodically pressing the puree through for a while, I tired of that and started just whipping the puree, round and round using the flat end of the spatula.  Lo and behold, it worked wonderfully.  In about 10 minutes I had 3-4 cups of puree and slightly less than a cup of quite dry seeds. 

And this recipe seems quite easy to make.

Loved this recipe! I too strained out the seeds. I mashed about 4 cups, then strained and had about 2.5 cups of raspberry puree - added the rest of the ingredients - also reduced vanilla to 1 tsp of vanilla bean paste. Was AWESOME!! Love it - thanks for sharing.

We have a lot of wild raspberries and I have made ice cream previous to this but it seemed a great idea to use the raspberries for this. I just made some revisions 1 cup each of heavy cream, milk, & half&half no sugar with fresh berries you don't need it. I then blended the berries and poured them in when the milk/cream mix started to freeze. It turned out great thank you so much!!!

Good recipe, after reading the other posts I agree you can double the quantity of raspberries. Also reducing the whipping cream to 1 cup and increasing the 1/2 & 1/2 to 2 cups.

This was great.  I put all the ingredients in a blender and mixed it up all at once, it was super easy.  I used 1% milk instead of half-and-half (because I had no half and half), and it was still very rich.  I had no problem with seeds, only noticed one or two.  I used about 3 1/2 cups of frozen raspberries, and it had a very strong raspberry flavor, almost like sherbet.  It comes out a very pretty color, too.

What an awesome recipe! I followed the directions as is (didn't read reviews beforehand) but it still turned out good. A bit crunchy from the seeds, so I think I will strain them out next time. Other than that, it was pretty good.

very creamy ice cream.  I used strawberries instead of raspberries, (processed in food processor) and used splenda instead of sugar.  My family loved it, but it was a little too rich for my taste.

Nice idea, agree w/ another review it tastes like raspberry cool whip (I use heavy cream all the time with ice cream w/out this problem).   Will try again turning it into a custard recipe and cooking it and adding eggs.  I too doubled the raspberries.

So fresh and packed with flavor. Nothing like fresh churned ice cream! I used total of 4 - 6 oz pkg of fresh raspberries since they are in season now. Macerated 3 pkgs with extra fine sugar, blended in blender and strained out seeds. Omitted vanilla. When churning, after began to thicken added last pkg berries and finished churning.

I adapted the recipe with majority half and half 3/4 c evap skim milk and then reg skim milk to make 3 cups total.  I added two homegrown eggs (minimal salmonella worries) and split the sugar with half Splenda.  I strained the blended raspberries to remove seeds.  Very good!

This was awesome!  I used 3 cups of fresh, raw milk (including the cream) in place of the whipping cream and half-and-half, and it turned out great.

This turned out great and very easy to make. Love that you do not use eggs and make a custard beforehand. Great flavor. Think you could substitute strawberries too! UPDATE!!! Just made with straberries - just as good!
