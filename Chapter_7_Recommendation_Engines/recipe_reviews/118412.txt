These were a huge hit at my party!  My husband overheard people talking about how much flavor they had.  I did make a few changes, though.  First, I used chive and onion cream cheese (and then omitted the green onions).  Second, I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added a little shredded cheese to them.  Finally, I used sun-dried tomato tortillas instead of plain ones. They would probably also be good with the garden vegetable tortillas!  Yum!  As a side note--be careful about the type of ham that you use.  I once made these with a ham that had a bit of a smokey flavor and I didn't like them as well.

Very tasty - I'm not one for too many surprises when I bite into something so the only changes I made were to add the shredded cheddar/monterey cheese and some chives.  I cut back on the Ranch a little since it left a pretty strong after taste.  Very tasty.  The second time I made them, I substituted taco seasoning for the ranch and used turkey instead of ham.  Also very good. :)

These were good. I wanted something extra to the usual roll-ups, because they tend to be kind of bland.
I did add some shredded cheddar cheese. They were a hit. They can be made a day ahead and actually taste better when you do.

These look so nice that people don't even realize how simple they are to make. I did omit the onions because not everyone is a fan and added shredded cheddar cheese. I've made them with chopped bell peppers, black olives, and celery before with great results. One tip... if you do ever try using celery, use VERY LITTLE or else the flavor is overpowering. However, it does give them a nice crunch. :)

These were a big hit at my daughters birthday party.  The only thing I changed was turkey instead of ham.

ok, so I looked at this recipe and immediately decided 1)it would have to be turkey, no ham and 2) there MUST be some sort of shredded or sliced cheese.  I made the recipe as is otherwise to test on myself, and decided it was too ranchy.  My final recipe was 3 packages of cream cheese to one package of ranch dressing.  I made an assembly line and made 8-10 inch tortillas.  The 3 packages of cream cheese was perfect for the 8 tortillas.  I then sprinkled with green onion and shredded cheddar, and put 3 slices of turkey on each.  I used the turkey to press the cheddar and onions into the cream cheese mix.  They rolled up nicely this way, with nothing falling out.  I made these for a post wine tour shindig, and they met with rave reviews from everyone-they didn't last long.  Will be making again as described for sure!  Simple, cheap, and easy.

These were good! I made them as is, with no modifications. However, as others have suggested, some shredded cheese would be a great addition. Thanks for the recipe.

Pretty good and super easy to make but I thought the flavor was a bit too strong.  Next time I would definitely cut back on the ranch dip powder or spread less cheese in each tortilla.

I used less green onion (only the green part) then called for and I'm glad I did.  It was a pretty strong flavor and almost overwhelmed the rest of the flavors.

Perfect ratios of the cream cheese to the ranch packet.  I also added about 1/3 cup of mayonaise to that mixture before adding in the green onions.  I also put some thin spears of dill pickle inside and they were the hit of a party I took them to.  The dill pickle just made them!

These are absolutely addictive and easy to make in large quantities. I chopped the onion in a food processor before adding it to the cream cheese mixture, and also added shredded cheddar on top of the ham before rolling up the tortilla. I found that the key to keeping the pinwheels from unrolling is to be sure to spread the cream cheese all the way to the outer edges so it acts as a glue. :)

To suite our tastes:  Added about 1/4 c sour cream to make the cream cheese mixture a little more creamy.  Added finely diced green pepper to the cream cheese mixture.  Added shredded cheese.  Omitted green onions.  

These would also be great with finely diced tomato, red pepper, black olives etc.  Great potluck food.

I've been making these for years and they are always a big hit (New Years, Christmas gatherings, bridal & baby showers, etc).  I usually make some with ham and some with turkey.  I also add shredded mild cheddar for color contrast.  I have made with and without adding cheese and it doesn't really seem to matter, everyone seems to love them.  I make the night before, and slice them (usually into 5 slices) the next day.  This allows the flavor to really blend well.  But for that reason also, the full packet of ranch dressing may be a bit strong for some people...but not in my group of friends.  Oh, I've also made these rollups in advance and placed in freezer until needed.  Allow time to thaw (maybe a day in fridge), then slice when needed.  I do this when there are several parties to attend--one appetizer goes a long way.

I decided to try these when I realized I had all of the ingredients and they came up in the search for tortillas. I scaled the recipe with the calculate button to make two rolls to cut the 3/4" pieces from. The only change I made was using whipped cream cheese. It is easier to spread and lower in saturated fat. I also didn't use quite so much as suggested. I thought, overall, they pretty much tasted like the ham roll ups recipe, from on here, but with an added tortilla. They presented well, but I feel like they needed something else taste wise. What I made did quickly get eaten though.

Not bad...but the dressing in the cream cheese seemed to be a bit over-powering with the ham.  Will not use as much of the dressing next go round.

These are super yummy but can be made a little healthier with reduced fat or fat free cream cheese and homemade salt-free ranch dressing mix. Using half fat free sour cream for half the cream cheese is good, too. I like to add a little dill, onion/garlic powder and fresh ground pepper as well to the dressing mix. Whole wheat tortillas can also be used.

These were a huge hit at my last party. Very easy to make. However they did not make as many as the recipe said. I used double the cream cheese mixture on each tortilla because 3 tablespoons didn't seem to be enough. Will make again.

Awesome recipe.  Everyone loved them at the party. I did not use all the ranch and I did use 3 packages of cream cheese.  Also only used 2 tsp of green onion.

Good basic roll but nothing to brag about!   There are a lot better roll appetizers.  Would be good for a kid's lunch however.

Maybe I put too much spread on each tortilla but these were not a hit at my party :( My husband said nobody wants to eat a cream cheese sandwhich ?? I didn't think they were that bad - a little overpowering if you had more than 1. 3 stars cuz they were easy and fun to make and looked yummy.

These were okay.  I should have gone with my gut and only used about half of the ranch dressing packet.  It was too salty for me.

The ranch dressing mix overpowered the cream cheese. I added some fresh spinach and some chopped tomato to tone down the ranch flavor. I wish I had added shredded cheese also.

These were just ok. I cut back on the ranch to make it more to my taste. And I sprinkled on shredded cheese before rolling them up. Without these two changes, the rolls wouldn't have rated at all. Probably won't make again.

Made these to take on a beach picnic.   I made them the night before, and put them in baggies.  The didn't get soggy like sandwiches tend to do, and their flavor was incredible.  I did add some shredded cheddar to the cream cheese mix--AWESOME!

I make these for almost every gathering I go to and I never take any home. Everyone loves these little bite sized roll ups! and you can switch up the "fillers". Add different kinds of flavored cream cheese etc. Very versitle! I like to make these at night, roll them up and then stick all of them back in the tortilla bag and stick it in the fridge overnight, then in the morning I take them out and cut the logs and then place them on a festive plate, makes for easier slicing too!

Great flavor! I followed a few reviewers suggestions: Used oven roasted turkey breast in place of ham (serving them to my daughter who doesn't like ham) and added some shredded cheddar cheese and chopped dill pickle slices. Tasted like bite-sized turkey deli sandwich!

I made these for my fiance to take to a work party.  There were none left.  I did make some changes.  I used turkey instead of ham, and I added bacon.  So basically, I made a turkey, bacon, ranch wrap...very yummy!

These had such a great taste! Added a little cheddar cheese as suggested by other reviewers. I also used onion and chive cream cheese and left out the green onion in the original recipe. Just made it a little cheaper and easier. Next time I will probably add a little more cream cheese so that I can be more liberal with the spread. 
They weren't as "pretty" as some of the other's I have seen, but it was my first time making them and I take fault for that, the recipe was VERY tasty!

These were soo Good  I had another recipe which is Similar to this one, that I couldn't find, but I remember it had olives, so I combined both and added Chopped Black Olives to half the bacth of this one.  Most of my guests liked the ones with olive even more!  Thanks so much!

I've been making my own version for years, instead of ranch I leave the cream cheese plain. I roll up asparagus (el dente) , red peppers or green onions. I make it with or without tortillas.

As written this is so RANCHY and salty. Having said that After reading cut bank on ranch added a little cheese and they are quite good and a great snack for when the kids get home from school. AS written though they are not very good. So I hate when a recipe is rated AFTER it is "fixed" Try this recipe and then decide whats best for your taste.

I added lettuce and cheddar.  But the cheddar was probably unnecessary since they have already have cream cheese.  But they were a big hit!  I made them for my daughters volleyball team where there were several different varieties of roll-ups to choose from. These were clearly the favorite.

I would recommend these to anyone looking to feed many people with small plates, those who have limited fridge space & need quick serving with advance preparation. I made these the night before & sliced them the next morning. I served them along with a great Spinach Roll ups & homemade Creamy Jalapeno Dip as well. I used 20 small tortillas b/c they were on sale. There were plenty & we had some leftover. This recipe is inexpensive & easy to prepare vs making small meaty sandwiches. It might be a little messy for kids but a safe, easy teaching recipe.  These were a great choice for our Grand Opening & Ribbon Cutting of our business, Video & Web Design Company in Hewitt, Texas. Down here in the South, we are all about hospitality & good food.  Everyone enjoyed them at both the ribbon cutting & the party after!

These are yummy! I used chive and onion cream cheese and omitted the green onions, per another reviewer's recommendation. Easy, versatile, inexpensive, and very attractive on a party platter! I think I might try the turkey-and-taco-seasoning idea next.

I made these to take to a birthday party and they were completely devoured!  I let the cream cheese come to room temperature before mixing in the ranch dressing and green onions.  I also didn't use deli ham but whatever thin sliced ham was on sale in the meat department.  You definately have to let these sit overnight to let the flavors blend.  We have a 7 year old that hates cream cheese, ranch dressing, and green onions but ate his weight in these.

Good recipe. I'd use a little less Ranch mix next time - it made the recipe too salty. May also try to substitute Chive and Onion Cream cheese. Added chopped olives, a little shredded cheddar.

These were very good.  My family really enjoyed them.  I made half with Ham and half with turkey.  I also added shredded cheddar cheese to them. I will say by the second day, they didn't taste very good.  This recipe made a lot of roll ups, so if you aren't going to eat them all the first day it might be better to half the recipe. I will try these again.

Very basic and easy, they were enjoyed but not raved about.  No one had anything good OR bad to say about them.  I will make them again for a variety platter, but I would never serve them alone, too boring!

HUGE PARTY FAVORITE!  I made these and replaced the green onions with shredded lettuce. I also made them for a light, quick, summer family dinner.  We had some chips and baked beans with it.!  Super easy, super good!

I used the chive & sour cream cheese, instead of the green onions.  Pretty good, a little salty...I'll try maybe adding a 1/2 to 3/4 of the ranch mix the next time.  Definitely a good recipe to take to the office or a party.

I also add shredded cheddar to the cheese spread, but I leave out the green onion.  These are always a great hit at parties.  I never have any left.  Sometimes I will just make extra of the cheese spread and make a wrap with lettuce and veggies added for lunch.  It is awesome.

These were great.  They were so easy to make.  I had a party with a lot of friends coming over so I made these the night before and cut them right before people started arriving.  I have had multiple requests for the recipe.  I added shredded cheese like a few other people mentioned and they turned out great.  I will make these again.

Very tasty, one of the best recipes for tortilla pinwheels I have found.  Recipe measurements were exact and very helpful (although I felt silly at the deli counter asking for 22 slices of ham).  They sure make a lot, though.  Make sure you have lots of guests to eat them all!  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this recipe is okay. I made it per the directions, except I added orange american cheese to my roll. I thought the ranch flavor was too over-powering. I served them at my housewarming party, and had a lot of leftovers that ended up in the garbage. Oh well, can't win them all.

I have read most of the reviews for this and will say take all the advice! I made some w/ chillies some w/ green onion,black olives and tomatoes some had ham some bacon no need for the ranch dressing just put what you like in the cream cheese. Pinch of salt and pepper, sour cream and even left over dip.this is really a wonderful app.

Excellent roll-ups. Added shredded cheddar cheese per other reviewers recommendations. Didn't have green onions so added a bit of dried chives. Very easy to make. Took them to a pool party and received many compliments.

This is a great little recipe, very easy to tweak and fit your taste.  My whole family loves them.  Theyâ€™re a great snack for gatherings.  I made some rolls as the recipe states; on others I added diced sweet bell peppers and others I placed a cucumber spear in the middle for a different taste.  These will be a great snack while playing cards with friends tonight.

We followed most of the recipe ingredients but we made a few minor adjustments according to other people's reviews.  We used one 8oz container Chive & Onion cream cheese, 1/2 pkt Ranch salad dressing mix, six(?) 10" large flour tortillas, some shredded Colby cheese and two 10oz containers Farm Fresh Deli Thin Sliced Honey Ham.  We omitted the green onions since our cream cheese already had onions and chives in it.  Other than those adjustments we followed the directions on the original recipe.  My husband couldn't stop eating them so I had to end up making a double recipe so we'd have some to share for the Super Bowl.

Very good! I came across this recipe while searching for one similar to my mother-in-law's (same general recipe only instead the ranch mixed into the cream cheese she uses black olives and jalapenos and uses roast beef for her meat). This version of the rollup, however, was a big hit at our SuperBowl Party- very clean and easy finger food!

This recipe was most helpful in that it told me what proportions I should use for the cream cheese and the ranch dressing mix.  Past that, I made quite a few changes.

1) I used oven-roasted deli turkey instead of the ham.  
2) I left out the green onions (the ranch flavoring I used had a pretty strong onion tendency and I thought it would be overpowering).  
3) I also added baby spinach leaves to the roll-ups - it added some lovely color to the final result and was healthy too!
4) Finally I used flavored/colored wrap tortillas (also for the color/health benefit).

I took these to a potluck and they were gone in minutes! :)

These were really good!  I made them for my daughters 9th birthday party.  I left out the green onions and added some shredded cheddar cheese.  I'll make these again!  Thanks for sharing!

Used turkey instead of ham - these were served at a large open house with over 50 people attending - everyone loved them!

Good, but I did make a few changes.  I added 3 tbls of light mayo to thin the cream cheese a bit.  I then added shredded cheddar cheese to the mixture.

I can't quite but my finger on it, but there is something about the ranch flavor that isn't quite right - maybe it is too concentrated.  Still a crowd pleaser though and every one ate them up.  Great for a potluck or work food day.

These are wonderful.  They make an easy and quick snack.  I use the onion and chive cream cheese instead of adding individual ingredients as well as some shredded cheese.

It was a good recipe, but I agree with some other reviews ... The whole ranch packet was a bit much, and I added some shredded cheese. It was a hit though!
