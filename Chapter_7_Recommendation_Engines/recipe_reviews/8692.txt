I have made this dish over the years with a couple variations. One way is to wrap one or two slices of dried beef around the chicken breast, then wrap a couple of slices of partially cooked bacon around that. I've also pounded the breasts and rolled them with the dried beef, wrapped the rolls with bacon and then browned them to crisp the bacon before baking in sour cream mixture. If I want to be lazy, I'll wrap the chicken in the bacon brown to crisp and then finely chop a few slices of the dried beef and mix it into the sour cream soup mix. With all methods I always make extra sauce and always add sliced fresh mushrooms and a bit of sherry.This is really one of our favorite recipes. I'm not sure that I'd like it with the whole dried beef slices underneath it all. I think the beef needs to be more incorporated into the dish.

I've been preparing this recipie for many years in my crockpot. I think it's the very best way to do it. When it's done the chicken falls apart from being cooked so long. The flavour is amazing, and it reheats wonderfully for the next few days. (Assuming there is any left!)

I have tried the variations with low fat substitutions and sound it always tastes pretty much the same... always delicious.

When done in the crockpot, just create layers of the chicken wrapped with bacon, dried beef, and soup mixture.

I also like to top it off with a few fresh mushrooms near the end of the cooking process.

Thanks for "exposing" what my husband used to refer to as his grandmother's secret recipe!  I have loved this ever since he made it for me the first time, and I like being able to make it myself now.  

Our ingredients are basically the same, but the assembly is a little different.  Instead of dried beef, we use the inexpensive thin sandwich beef (Carl Buddig brand in our area).  I have never felt the recipe is overly salty, so the luncheon meat must help with this.  In addition, I use chicken breast tenderloins instead of the whole breast.  

For assembly, we wrap 2 slices of the beef around the chicken tenderloin, then wrap the bacon around it, then pour the sour cream/soup over the top of the assembled pieces.

I used deli sliced boiled ham instead of the chipped beef - it took away a lot of the saltiness.  Since my first time, I've experimented and have placed either chopped spinach, aspargus or sliced carrots on top of the breast before wrapping in the bacon.  I also layer swiss chesse on top of the bacon prior to covering in the soup/sour cream.  If I've used spinach, I use cream of spinach soup; aspargus, cream of aspargus, etc.  This recipe can really be changed, added to and it comes out great every time.

I have had this recipe for 30 years, and the friend who gave it to me said it was the most flexible recipe in the world.  She was right.  I fix this the day before, put it in the fridge over night, thereby freeing up my time when I have company.  I also leave out the bacon entirely, since tere is plenty of salt and taste without it, and my family complained about the 'grease'.    I increase the sour cream to a pint per can of soup.  It also reheats like a dream, even in a microwave.  Also you can cook it at 250, 275, 300, 350, just try and see which result you like.  I think it is better the longer it cooks so I opt for 250, and 3 hours.  Enjoy!!

HAVE MADE THIS FOR YEARS, ONLY WE CALL IT "CHICKEN SUZANNE".  NEVER USE THE BUDDING BEFF...ONLY ARMOUR DRIED BEEF WILL DO! I'LL CUT OFF THE FATTY 1/4 TOP OF BACON SLICE...CUTS DOWN ON FAT. DON'T USE ANY SALT.  ALSO, I DOUBLE SOUR CREAM & SOUP FOR MORE GRAVY/SAUCE FOR RICE.  DELICIOUS & SPECIAL FOR COMPANY OR SUNDAY DINNER!

We really didn't like this recipe much at all.  The flavours were strange and the dried beef remained hard and chewy.  I thought it might soften and blend in with the sauce a bit like the bacon did.  I won't be making this again.

Wonderful flavor! Presentation is pretty. The only problem for me was that it was way too salty! Next time I make this, I will be cutting down on the amount of dried beef and using reduced or no sodium cream of mushroom soup. Also, I will cover it with foil during last hour of cooking time. The tops of breasts tended to dry out since it wasn't covered.Thank you Marilyn.

This was excellent! I used 1 can low fat cream of chicken(fam doesn't like mushroom) lite sour cream.I soaked the dried beef in water and then just used 1 slice per breast and wrapped the breast around the beef , then wrapped precooked turkey bacon around the breast. Put this on before church and lunch was ready on returning. When I am not trying to count calories and fat I want to try this with shredded tasso instead of the beef and use reg bacon. It was fantastic even using all low fat ingredients. Will make again!!!1

I made this into a five star recipe by adding 1/4 cup of sherry to the sauce and sprinkling the sauce-covered chicken with parmesan and paprika.  I also cooked the bacon, but kept it soft and only cooked the chicken for 1 hour at 275 instead of 3 hours.  I thought it was very good, super easy and fast.

My husband and older daughter loved this dish.  I did make a few changes.  I took the advice of other reviewers and rinsed the dried beef first (a very good tip!).  I placed the bacon on top of the chicken breasts instead of wrapping them.  I used fat-free sour cream.  And, I used one can cream of mushroom AND one can of cream of chicken soups for more sauce.  I cooked uncovered for 1 hour & 15 mins at 350 deg. (I didn't have the luxury of 3 hours cooking time) and it still turned out wonderfully.  The chicken was so tender I didn't need a knife to cut it, and the sauce was plentiful and delicious - perfect over rice!

I have been cooking this for years, with a slight variation.  Like other reviewers have said, I wrap my chicken around the dried beef and then wrap with bacon.  I also use cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom.  Dried beef is very salty for me, so I've found if I rinse the beef with water and then pat dry, it reduces the saltiness of this dish.  After cooking, I add some cooked instant rice to make more of a casserole.

The only change I made was to pound the chicken breasts flat, place two or three slices of dried beef on the chicken, roll it up, then wrap in bacon. I then poured a mixture of FF sour cream and low-sodium CoMushroom soup over the top. This was a rich and satisfying meal -  served it with steamed broccoli and buttered baby potatoes. Thanks!

First of all, my kids and I don't eat mushrooms so we used cream of celery instead.  We doubled the amounts of both the soup and the sour cream, and added an 8 oz package of cream cheese, 1/2 cup of sherry, 1/2 cup of milk and 2 packages of frozen spinach (10 oz. ea.). I mixed the sour cream, cream cheese, milk, sherry and soup together.  wrapped the chicken breasts with the dried beef (I soak the dried beef for several hours in hot water to remove a majority of the salt.), then wrap the bacon around the dried beef wrapped chicken.  Place the chicken in a lightly oiled baking dish.  Put the spinach in the baking pan between the chicken breasts.  Cover chicken and spinach with the creamy mixture and bake as directed in the original recipe.

I've made this twice now and the second time I used Golden Mushroom soup and liked it much better. I only wish this particular soup came in a low salt version. Great recipe!

This was great for low carb diet if you use less soup, more sour cream and add some fresh mushrooms. I added some diced onion, ground black pepper and dried parsley to the sauce before baking. Asparagus on the side.

I have used this recipe in the past and have really enjoyed it. I've gotten used to cutting back on the salt without losing all the flavor. I rinse the beef under hot water, drain, and blot with paper towels. I also use reduced sodium soups (whichever one you choose). Also, reduced sodium bacon- partially cooked first. It makes a big difference for folks trying to cut back on the salt, but not the flavor. Great dish with few ingredients!

This is the EASIEST chicken recipe I've ever made - and it was DELICIOUS.  I tripled the recipe and served the cooked product at a church dinner.  I received RAVE reviews.  It was very salty, so next time I would use lower-sodium mushroom soup.  I would also take another reviewer's advice and lightly cook the bacon to remove some of the fat in advance(I used thick-sliced bacon); I would wrap the dried beef around the chicken, then wrap the bacon; finally, I would add sherry to the sauce.  The men(especially) said how wonderful it was!

Yummy!   I doubled the sour cream and mushroom soup.  When it was almost done, I covered with provolone cheese.  I had to cook this longer than three hours... may be my oven. Regardless, this has a wonderful flavor!  I can't wait to serve this to a group!

Like the other reviewers have said, the dish can be really salty. I only use 6 oz of beef and rinse it first. I also use 2 cans of soup because one doesn't make enough sauce for my taste. Otherwise, an awesome meal with good leftovers!

I have been making this recipe for years and it is delicious.  Very rich.  No need to add salt.  I usually double the sour cream and soup mixture because we like to have a little sauce left over for rice.

You can decrease the saltiness by rinsing the dried beef really well in a colander before adding it to this dish.  Next time I make it I'm also going to try low-sodium cream of mushroom soup.  Otherwise, my husband and I love this dish!

I was very dissapointed in this recipe.  I didn't add broccoli because many reviewers said it was salty enough without.  I found it to be very bland.  It definitely needed something else to make it special, but I'm not quite sure what.

I have made this recipe sooo many times. I have handed it out to many friends across the country and they all tell me that is one of their fav dishes! I always cover mine w foil and put on 275 -300 degrees and let cook for 3-4 hrs while I get chores done. It is so very tender it falls apart. Wonderful Dish!

This was pretty tasty. I took the advice of some others and I pounded the chicken flat, then wrapped it around a piece of chipped beef, then wrapped two thin sliced pieces of bacon around each piece of chicken. I then browned the chicken(bacon) so that it was nice a brown and a little crispy. I then put it in a pan in the 350 degree oven for about 1 hour (not three) and of course I did put the soup/sour cream mixture on it.  It was very salty but it tasted good. Next time I will take the advice of others and rinse the chipped beef first and I will also look for low sodium soup, to help cut the salt a but. All in all, quite yummy! Even my little guy who hates chicken and hates bacon liked it!

Flavors were just ok, nothing special. I did not know what to expect and thought with the combination of bacon and dried beef the dish would have had a better taste. A bit on the bland side.

Couldn't resist trying this recipe, and I'm glad I did.
After reading the previous reviews I adjusted the sour cream to 1 3/4 cups mixed with one can of cream of mushroom soup, laid the bacon on top of the chicken instead of wrapping, and used two (2 oz)packages of Buddig Beef cut in strips to line the 9x12 baking pan. I cooked the chicken for 3 hours uncovered at 300, I used a higher temperature because I live at a high altitude.The chicken was a little dry but next time I make this I'll try the lower temerature and see if that helps. The bacon did get crisp even with the soup/ sour cream topping but I don't think it would have if I had covered the dish. I didn't save the sauce it was kind of thin and there was a lot of grease from the bacon. The flavor was great, very elegant for a Wednesday night family dinner but they are my best critics. No bad reviews from any of my family.

Wow!  What a great recipe!  So easy, too!

I did make a few changes to the original though - First off, I used Buddig beef (thin luncheon meat) instead of the dried beef as several people had suggested.  I put a slice of provolone cheese over everything before putting the sauce on.  Instead of cream of mushroom soup, I used cream of chicken.  It was not salty and all.  I also baked it at 350 for an hour and it was done and not dry at all.  In fact, it sort of reminded me of Chicken Cordon Bleu...

Very yummy!  I'll be using this for a Murder Mystery Dinner that I have coming up!

Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is certainly delicious...I have prepared it many times, but find that it is even better (can you believe it) if you marinate it overnight before preparation...just prepare, pop in fridge night before and it has absorbed more of the dried beef/sour cream/mushroom...very good!

I didn't have regular sour cream so I used the french onion dip that I had and used both chicken and mushroom soup plus put a slice of swiss cheese on the chicken before I wrapped it with the bacon strip.  I also rinsed the dried beef to get rid of some of the salt.  I used the gravy over mashed potatoes and it turned out really good.  My husband liked it and he usually does not like casseroles.  Thanks.

This is very similar to Party Chicken I on this site. I have been making this for years. I sometimes omit the bacon and use reduced fat sour cream and healthy choice cream soup, I usually use chicken soup as we don't care for mushrooms. Delicious!

I just tried this recipe.  Even my picky eaters loved it.  I used two slices of uncooked bacon around each skinless, boneless chicken breast.  Be sure to use the Hormel 5 oz. JAR of dried beef.  It is much less salty than the dried beef that I have made creamed dried beef with.  I followed the instructions exactly for the sauce and it was delicious over hot cooked noodles.  Leave the soup in the condensed form and add the sour cream for the sauce.  I also only did 6 breast pieces.  The sauce amount was perfect for 6 servings.  Thank you for the yummy recipe!

Great recipe!!!  I served 30 meals and had no leftovers!!  I took the advice of some reviewers and used Buddig beef and rolled inside the breasts, wrapped them with the bacon and browned just a bit before baking.  I also covered for most of the time.

I love this dish!  It is so good and so simple.  I do have a couple of suggestions that I incorporate when I prepare the dish.  (1) Try rinsing the dried beef and bacon under lukewarm water.  It cuts down on the saltiness and doesn't seem to affect flavor, and (2)instead of using just cream of mushroom soup, use equal portions of cream of mushroom with garlic and cream of chicken soups.

We've been making this same recipe but with a different name for years and it's awesome.  I like to double the sour cream and the soup because the sauce is so yummy.  I've made it many times without the dried beef because I didn't have it on hand and it's still wonderful.  Think I'll try what someone else suggested and try adding a slice of dried beef to the inside of the chicken breast before I roll it up.  Try this -you'll love it.

They just don't come any easier then this to fix!!!  The chicken cooks up more tender then any I have EVER served.  I have cut down the dried beef (to about half of what was called for), as it was a bit too salty for my group. I also put an extra bowl of mushroom soup/sour cream in the oven to bake as extra gravy.  This recipe was a smash hit with all who ate it! TRY IT!!

This is an excellent dish. Following suggestions of others, I pounded the chicken breasts to even thinness, layered with beef and rolled into a tight cylinder. Each roll was wrapped with 2 slices of the pre-cooked (or partially cooked) bacon. I also added Sherry to the sauce. Very good but rich. I think 4 breasts would serve 6-8 when served over rice.

Ok, so I'm not the world's best cook.  I forgot to thaw the chicken so I cooked it frozen and added another 30 minutes cooking time.  It was wonderful.  What a forgiving, tasty recipe!

WOW. Most definitely not the healthiest recipe but quite yummy to make up for it. The only changes I made was to use only 4 breasts but yet doubled the soup and sour cream (my husband likes lots of "gravy"). We both really enjoyed this and will make again very soon. I poured the gravy over egg noodles. Very good. I also pre-cooked the bacon halfway to minimize the grease.

My family loves this dish! I use cream of chicken soup because some at my house wont eat mushrooms. I also cook at 350 for 1 hour. Chicken comes out delicious and fall-apart tender. Gravy is great over potatoes or rice.

I made this using one package of Buddig luncheon meat, chopped, and an equal amount of thin, sliced hard salami, chopped.  I crisped the bacon and doubled the sour cream and soup.  Rave reviews!  It's a keeper.

Easy, easy, easy!  This takes all of 15 minutes to prepare and place in the oven.  My husband loved it, and I found it very good.  Knowing that he would want more of the cream gravy, I doubled the liquid amounts.  It went well with mashed potatoes and a side of broccoli.  Note: I would wash the beef next time and use less of it.

The combination of beef, pork & chicken was a pleasant surprise to our taste buds.  Excellent company dish! I half-cooked the bacon prior to wrapping the chicken, soaked the dried beef in bowl a water while cooking the bacon to remove the salt, used two cans of soup (cream of chicken and cream of mushroom).  I cooked as directed for three hours, but I think that maybe it was a bit too long. Most of the soup cooked away and the chicken was a bit dry (tasty - but dry). I will definitely make this again, but would reduce cooking time to 1.5 hours.

Way too salty. I would cut down on the beef jerky quite a bit.  None of the kids would eat it.  I guess it was too strange.

This is a delicious recipe that I have made before with a slight variation-- flatten the chicken breasts a little and roll the dried beef inside, then wrap with the bacon.

Prefer crispy bacon?  Mix the sour cream, soup and chopped dried beef, spread into pan.  Lay chicken over sour cream mixture, lay bacon on top.  Cover with foil and bake for 2 1/2 hours at 325 F. ... uncover for last 30 minutes.  DEEEELICIOUS!!!! 

(This was the first meal my husband ever made for me ... he called it Yummy Chicken Dinner.  Very appropriate name :))

Very good. I have made this many many times now. The only thing I change is I get the ham slices that are about 1/4" thick found by the hams instead of the beef. My whole family loves it

This is easy to make. I have to honestly say that I didn't like it that much. But my husband on the other hand loved it and loved the favors. If it makes him happy, I will make it again. I used 6 slices of bacon and it alittle worried about the dried beef. But everyone has different tastes.

Definately a keeper recipe.  I didn't think it was too salty.  I've made this twice now.  The first time I rinsed the bacon and beef.  I thought it lost the flavor.  Second time I didn't rinse anything.  Definately better the second time.  Fantastic!

Uck!  This was a very greasy dish.  The dried beef added a salty layer to it.  I mean SALTY.  It was almost too salty to eat.  The bacon flavor was way too strong and added alot of grease.  It might be better with ham and no dried beef.  However, this one is going in the trash.

After reading other reviews on this dish, i decided to exchange the dried beef for proscuitto and wrapped the chicken with pepper bacon.  i used 2 cans of cream of mushroom and used the sauce to put over mashed potatoes.  This dish was so good and my kids loved it.  I will definitly make this one again.

I have made this recipe three times.  I have never used dried beef in a jar.  I always use the small packaged beef that you would use for chipped beef.  One package, chopped.  I used one can of mushroom soup with the designated sour cream.  I diluted the soup using one can of water.
I found that I did not have quite enough sauce when it was finished.  The two times since I have used two cans of cream of mushroom soup.  I also whisked in some thyme and paprika with the sour cream and soup mixture.  Try it.  I think it is a keeper.

Good stuff! I didn't change a thing. Next time I'll precook the bacon some, it just wasn't crispy so I couldn't eat it. The flavor overall was fantastic!

I enjoyed this recipe. It was even better the 2nd day as a leftover. I used only 2.5 ounces of dried beef and served the dish over egg-noodles. The chicken was very moist and both my husband and my seven-year-old boy enjoyed it very much. The chicken was so tender that, if it were not for the bacon, you could cut it with a spoon!

I consider myself a salt lover (I love salt & vinegar chips, green olives etc.) and even the 2.5 jar of dried beef was too much for me.  I rinsed the beef before I added it to the recipe (per instructions on the jar) but it was still very strong.  The second time I made this, I used half a jar and it wasn't enough, so I think I'll stick with a whole jar and rinse it well next time.  Even with too much/too little salt, I LOVED this recipe. I crave it all the time.  Thank you Marilyn!

As usual, I read the reviews first.  Almost everyone talked about the saltiness.  I simply rinsed the dried beef (as directions state on the jar) and did not have a problem with it being salty.  Even my 5 year old wants to know when I am going to make chicken "uncle gene" again!

I have used a version of this for years called "Continental Chicken" which I do in my crockpot.  I add 1 c. Cr. of Mushroom and 1 c. Cr. of Chicken soup;  also a T. flour for thickening.  I serve this concoction over yellow rice and usually serve with steamed broccoli.  Because it is rich, I serve w/a salad of lettuce, mandarin orange slices, sliced almonds & sliced heart of celery.  I use a italian dressing and top with a light dusting of lemon pepper.  [NOTE: if strawberries are in season I add sliced strawberries to my salad also.]

I grew up eating this and have not had in many years.  When I first tasted this it brought me back to my childhood.  First, the people who are complaining that this was too salty... if you read on the dried beef jar, it says that if using in a recipe to rinse with warm water before using.  This will reduce the salt content.  My whole family really liked this even my picky 16 year old.  The only thing I will do different next time is not use bacon at all as it did not add much and it was slimmy.  Either that or I will brown the breast with the bacon on it before baking.

I've been making a variation of this receipe for 15 years or so now.  I'm not sure if any of the previous reviews said this or not but there is an important step missing in the recipe here.  You have to rinse each piece of dried beef and pat each one dry before using it - that is why everyone says it is too salty!  Also, I think mixing the sour cream with golden mushroom gives a much better flavor than regular cream of mushroom soup but I guess that is just individual preference...I hope the rinsing the beef tip is helpful - it WILL be too salty without that step - I forgot to do it one time!

My husband was so impressed with this meal because it tastes and looks gourmet without all the prep work.  I did take some suggestions and used the buddig beef and lightly cooked and blotted the bacon before wrapping.  It was absolutely delicious and very filling... my only suggestion is to use more cream of mushroom soup and sour cream for extra sauce. Yummy!

I've been making this for over 30 years.  I don't use bacon anymore -- too much fat.  I use light sour cream and 1 can each of cream of mushroom and cream of chicken.  I also sprinkle sliced almonds on top before baking at 275.  Very good.

Very greasy!  If I were to cook this again I would cook the bacon before baking this dish.  Quite salty as well and I only used 2.5 oz of dried beef.  My husband really liked it and he is a little picky.

Very Good.  I prefer my bacon cooked crisp, so next time I will precook the bacon and sprinkle over the whole dish.  Also, I wrapped the beef (I used Buddig luncheon beef) around the chicken.  This dish is a winner!

This was really good, with just one exception.  I used only the 2.25 oz jar of dried beef and found that to even be too much.  Next time (and there will be many more times) I will only use 1-2 slices of the dried beef under each breast.  I did the complete baking time and as other reviewers said, this was fork tender.  Definately a keeper!  Thanks Marilyn.

Very good dish.  I followed the intructions that ladyhen left in her review.  I used Budding beef (lunchmeat), two cans of cream of chicken and  slices of provelone cheese over the chicken.  I also pre-cooked the bacon a little and it turned out great.  Not salty at all.

This couldn't be any easier to do unless someone did it for you.  The low oven setting results in chicken that is so tender you don't even need a knife.  Super, Super Recipe for large parties or small intimate dinners.  Can't say enough about the flavor either....very subtle but definitely great.  Thanks

This was okay.  My husband liked it more than I did, but I don't think he would ask me to make it again.  My son (13) wasn't thrilled with it, but my daughter's friend (11) ate it and said it was pretty good.  But, everyone's tastes are different, right?  My husband will make chicken sandwiches with the leftovers, and that's good for me...I won't have to make dinner tonight...as he gets home quite late.  Thanks Marilyn!

This was fantastic. I rinsed my beef and used Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic soup.  I didn't have 3 hours to cook it so I raised the oven temp to 325 and cooked it for 2.5 hours & it was still out of this world. It's VERY salty and VERY rich. I served it with egg noodles and peas.

This was real easy to make and the taste over noodles was absolutly GREAT, but the next time I make this I will rinse the dried beef even though I only used 2.5 oz. it was too salty for us, and I can't tell what difference the bacon made in the flavor so next time I may leave it out of the reciepe.

So delicious but a bit salty from the dried beef.  The next time I will rinse the dried beef to remove most of the salt before using in the recipe.  The chicken was so moist and tender.

Delicious and moist, but I would add less dried beef, a bit too salty for my family and add a bit more soup mix for more sauce.

I cut down on the dried beef, used enough to line the baking pan with a single layer, and the recipe came out perfect... my husband who really doesn't like chicken really loved it.  It is easy and good enough to serve company.

I make my own mushroom soup, use portabella and shitake mushrooms, and I add a good 1/4 cup of Marsala to the sour cream.  I also pound the breasts, and roll the beef inside then wrap the chicken rolls with the bacon.  I like to sprinkle the top with smoked paprika before baking and fresh parsley after baking. For presentation to company, I place cooked brown rice in individual au gratin dishes.  I like to make a spicy watercress and radiccio salad with a balsamic vinaigrette as a side dish.

This was pretty good but I think it could have been better w/some adjustments. Microwaving the bacon for a approx. 2 min. first otherwise it is still rawish when this dish comes out. also I used thinner chicken cutlets so I couldn't cook for 3 hours or it would have become tough. I cooked for 1 hour 15 min. and that was about perfect for the chicken. Only problem was the bacon was undercooked. I'll make this again and I'll make sure the bacon is almost finished when I put it in to bake.

Ugh! Thank God I didn't invite anyone for dinner. This was terrible. I didn't rate it with because I made my chicken with turkey bacon, and rating the original recipe wouldn't be fair. The dried beef tasted terrible with the chicken. The only saving grace was the sauce, how can you go wrong with creamy soup mixed with sour cream?

To cut salt, rinse beef and use reduced sodium soup, also use the new pre-cooked bacon. Baking at 350 for 1 hr. also works.  Very tasty!

I cut down on the dried beef, rinsed it, and this dish was still a little salty for our tastes.  It was very easy, however, and I'll probably make it again.  I think I'll add a little sugar to the sour cream mixture next time and see if that cuts the saltiness.

Absolutely delicious! Used a 4.5 oz jar dried beef but otherwise followed the directions exactly as written.  Great with beef Rice-A-Roni, which made the whole dinner very simple to prepare, but so out-of-this-world good. Thanks Marilyn.

This was so good. I only used half of the dried beef like so many others suggested.  Next time I will also try rinsing off the beef as my husband said it was too salty, but I thought it was about right. Healthwise, it would probably be better to soak or rinse first. This was so easy to make and would be great for a dinner party. I used thin sliced bacon and it crisped up real nice and I only baked it for about 2 and a half hours.

This is so delicious!!!!! My husband is very picky and he just loved this .. I did use a small jar dried beef. That was plenty. But was confused with the soup. Are you to add milk or water to the soup and sour cream. Or use the soup as is right out of the can?

This is excellent. After reading reviews, I did the small jar of sliced dried beef and used two cans of mushroom soup. I was amazed at the tenderness of the chicken. Next time I plan to add a small amount of white cooking wine.
Excellent meal. Great that it can be doubled or tripled easily for number of guests.

Recipe calls for 8oz. jar of dried beef. The common size in my area is Hormel 2.5oz. size which easily covers a 9 x 13 baking pan. If the juices and soup end up watery, as mine did, I recommend taking the time to reduce it to a creamy thickness and pouring the result over the top.

We loved this one! Very tasty, and the leftovers went quick!  If you think it's too salty, I would just reduce the amount of beef you put in the botom of the pan, but we thought it was just right. A definite keeper for my family.

What a great blend of flavors! This was so easy to make - my husband (who doesn't comment much on cooking) loved it and wants me to make it at least once a week. Next time I'm going to cut down a bit on the dried beef - it was just a little too salty. Great recipe!!!

We love this recipe! I soak the dried beef briefly to rinse some of the salt off, then cut it into smaller pieces before sprinkling on the bottom of the pan. I top with a bit of paprika on the sauce. This goes well with a side of grilled asparagus.

Been making this recipe for years and served over Grandma's frozen noodles. My Mom found the recipe in the Mammoth Mountain cookbook in the 80s. It's been a fave ever since but now I make it in the crockpot, set on low for 6-8 hours or high for 2-3.

This has been a favorite of ours for over 35 years! I sometimes add a splash of dry sherry to the soup mixture.  I like to serve it over unseasoned white and wild rice (ie Canoe brand), peas and canned cranberry sauce.

I wrapped the bacon over the chicken and cooked, as someone else had done.  I think it would be easier to break up the beef and add to the soup/sour cream mixture, too, next time  
It was very good!!

Been making this for years.  Happy to have a real  recipe. We call it “Lynn’s chicken.” So good and so good leftover. I was having a large gathering and this was one of two entrees. I cut the chicken much smaller. Put the dried beef in the bottom, topped with the chicken pieces, laid a half slice bacon on the chicken and froze it all. Day of party, I stirred together the sauce, covered the frozen chicken with the sauce and just cooked it on a very low oven. Perfect. Great with rice, mashed potatoes. Great in a buffet.

I have been making this for over 50 yrs. The only thing I change is I use 1/2 can mushroom and 1/2 can celery soup. When I double the recipe I use 1 can each of soups and 16 0z of sour cream but only use 1 jar of dried beef or enough to cover the bottom of the dish I am using. I also prefer using breasts with rib bones because it adds so much more flavor. I loosely cover the dish while baking until the last 30 minutes so it will brown. 2 hrs is usually enough cook time.

This is a wonderful dish!!  Two important comments:
1.) Several negative reviews noted the saltiness of this dish.  If you follow the recipe exactly, that seems very possible!  8 oz of dried beef is almost equivalent to two LARGE jars of the armour dried beef sold in most groceries.  (See image.)  I doubled this recipe and only used one large jar (4.5 oz) and it was perfect.  (So, keeping it as written with 8 oz is A LOT of dried beef.) 
2.) I prefer to use homemade cream soups.

I made this exactly as written.  Very good recipe, the flavor was there  except cooking chicken for 3 hours was too much.  The chicken was like sawdust, extremely dry and crumbly.  I will probably make it again but not cook it so long.

My grandma used to make this for me when I was a child...she called it company chicken. But we always had one more thing...egg noodles. After you prepare the dish you take a piece of chicken with sauce and a few pieces of dried beef and lay over cooked eigg noodles. It really brings the whole dish together and helps with the saltiness of the dried beef. So all of you that thought it was too salty...try this I promise you will love it

We have made this for years and it is a wonderful recipe for having guests over.  I rinse the chipped beef off and pat dry to minimize the salt from it.  I don't know how it isn't perfectly tender for everyone but I add 2 cans of soup to a pint of sour cream.  It is wonderful with mash potatoes.

Love this!!! Have made it several times and always a hit with everyone. DEFINITELY DOUBLE THE SAUCE!! Some people complain it's too dry so perhaps this is the problem. Plus, the sauce is so good you'll want extra! Also, I add 1/2 C sherry (soooo good!) to the sauce and scatter mushrooms on top of the chicken before sauce. Serve with long grain rice and roasted asparagus. Awesome and super easy dish!!

I have had this dish before, but, had no idea it took so long to cook.   I thought it seemed crazy to cook boneless chicken breasts for 3 hours, but, mine was fork tender and not dry.  I noticed some people had problems with their chicken being dry, so, maybe it depends on the size of the chicken you use.   I took the hint of some other reviewers and rinsed the dried beef well and patted dry to help with some of the saltiness of the dish.  Not a dish I would make every day due to the bacon, salty beef and sour cream, but, a nice treat from time to time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Thanks for posting this! My mother used to cook this all the time in the 60's and it was in her file as "Husband's Delight Chicken." I remembered all the ingredients - or was at least pretty sure I did - but I was clueless about how long to cook etc. She is in her 80's now and doesn't remember this at all, but I know she'll love it as much now as she did then. I'm hoping it will freeze well in individual servings. I'll update this with that info.  Again - THANKS!

Using deli roast beef made this less salty. I chopped the beef and mixed it with the soup mixture. I used Cream of Chicken, and the result was bland; I think Cream of Mushroom would have worked better, and a splash of wine as some others have suggested would have helped.

Too salty with bacon AND dried beef.  I was not please at all with the result and would have liked to have used my sodium for the month on something tastier like kettle korn or potato chips.  Totally disappointing.

Very tasty! Easy to make and was a hit with my husband. We'll definitely have this again and again.
