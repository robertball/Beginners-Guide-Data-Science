Very good veggie dish.  Like the other reviewer, I also reduced the cooking time for the asparagus to 5-7 minutes.  Reduced calories/fats/etc. by using less olive oil to cook the asparagus; egg substitute and low-fat mozzarella cheese. Kept the real/fresh Parmesan cheese so the dish still had lots of flavor.  Because I don't have an oven-safe skillet, I poured the mixture into an oven-safe baking dish to pop under the broiler and to serve from directly.  Will KEEP this recipe in my collection.

This recipe had a WONDERFUL taste.  All of our family gobbled it up - even the 2 and 1 year old!  I did make quite a few "tweaking"-like changes though.  To the ingredients I added 1 tsp. hot sauce, 1/2 tsp. salt and 3 Tbsp crumbled bacon (I think these were suggested in an earlier review).  In the instructions under #2 I changed the cooking time for the asparagus to 6 minutes - 10 would have been WAY too long and the mushrooms only needed to be cooked 3 minutes.  Under #3 I only had to cook the egg mixture for 2-3 minutes.  Under #4 I baked the 10 minutes but it was very brown and close to burnt - I would adapt this to 7-10 minutes and watch it closely.  The cheese needs to be broiled about 1-2 minutes.  This is going in the KEEPER file!!  Thank you!

Yummy, even for a light dinner. I shortened my cooking time on the asparagus, otherwise mine would have been overdone.

This was excellent! Cooked the asparagus only 5 minutes as suggested, then added the mushrooms.  Used 8 egg whites and 2 whole eggs to lighten up the calories and cholesterol.  Couldn't tell the difference! This has so many possibilities.  Needed some pepper and salt, but you can add that on your own.  Served it with a baked potato and salad for a no fuss dinner.  This is a keeper.

I don't usually change recipes the first time I make them - but for this, I diced half an onion and sauteed it prior to the asparagus & mushrooms.  In addition, I had some old bread (a nice Grace Baking loaf) and chopped that up and added it to the egg mixture - along with some lowfat milk and non-fat cottage cheese - to create a savory bread pudding of sorts.  Oh and I didn't have parmesan or mozzarella so used some white cheddar.  Turned out quite well - husband ate more than half & had some for leftovers the next day.  Served with a small green salad and some prosecco - delicious!

when I first said to my husband we were having frittata for dinner - he gave me the "oh gah we're having some sort of foo-foo girly food" look. but when I served it to him, he said it was delicious. 

I made it in a cast iron skillet and the only thing I did differently was add some chopped up green onions in right before I dumped the egg mixture in the pan. (needed to use them up)

Great easy recipe that you can adjust however you like.

This was so good and so easy. I've made it 3 times and we actually like it better without the cheese.

A really good vegetarian main meal; even my irritable meat-eating family thought it was substantial enough. I'll make it again.

Wonderful recipe. I added red onion,since I had one already chopped, used less oil/butter . Also after cooking vegtables in skillet,I put them into a greased(PAM)glass baking dish, and poured beaten eggs(8) over veggies. Baking time was increased by about 5-8 minutes due to my changes. Will save this recipe for sure.

There were good.  I made them with egg substitute and low fat cheese.  I knew my family wouldn't eat them, so I baked them in muffin tins.  I froze them 2 per ziplock bag.  I grab them out when I want a snack or breakfast amd warm them in the microwave wrapped in a paper towel.  Great!

Really, really nice. I did a few things differently. Added about 1/4 cup diced onion to veggie saute. I didn't have thyme, so I added about 1/2 tspn. dried oregano to the eggs. And I stirred the parm into the egg mixture. Plus, I added a dash of salt & pepper. I'd definitely do this one again.

I love asparagus and eggs. Very basic and easy recipe you can customize however you like and with whatever you have on hand. I added red and yellow peppers and left out the cheese

In Texas in the summer we almost never fire up the oven...so my changes started with a 20 minute marinade of the asparagus (30 stalks) and 2 medium portabellos sliced.  (Marinade consists of the olive oil, fresh thyme & rosemary chopped, sea salt and juice of 1 lime)    Pre-heat (350-375) a seasoned 12" cast iron skillet on the grill  Prepped the eggs (adding about 4 rough chopped Tbspn of last nights collard greens)  - Slide the pre-heated skillet to one side of the grill & throw the asparagus & mushrooms on, turning with tongs it took about 5-6 minutes.   -We pulled most of the asparagus off and chopped into bite sized pieces (keeping a few whole for dressing the dish)   We poured the eggs in and let them sit in the sizzling skillet a minute before incorporating the veggies...1 stir and close the grill lid (no peeking) and about 7 minutes late...done.  -Fed a family of 5 with 3-teenaged boys + I've got some for lunch today instead of a sandwich.  This is a great basic recipe that lends itself well to incoporating almost any left-over...we'll use this one in different forms again, I'm certain.

This frittata is the BOMB. Customize to your taste. I sauteed some minced garlic and onion before adding the asparagus, used portabello mushrooms, tarragon is a must with egg dishes (omitted thyme), liberal parm and mozzarella. Definite keeper.

This recipe was pretty good.  I took hint from other reviewers and crumbled some bacon over the top before adding the cheese.  It needed something more than just thyme though.  Next time I will saute a little garlic with the asparagus and mushrooms and add a dash of cumin to give it a savory flavor.

Delicious and SO easy!  I love recipes that are easily adaptable and in this one you can add what you like and take out what you don't.  I didn't change it much except to add red onions to the sauteed veggies.  Came out wonderful and looked impressive serving it right out of the pan.  This one is a keeper.

Love this recipe! Not only is it easy it's delicious too! This recipe does not give a pan size. I doubled the recipe for my 12 inch pan  I knew it would be too dry if I didn't. It came out perfect. I used egg beaters and part skim mozzarella. I also reduced the amount of olive oil that was calculated for 12 eggs. I'm going to try making ahead and freezing for breakfast during the week! Try this one you won't be sorry!

Excellent!  Just cook the veggies as much as you like--as though you would just eat them by themselves!--because everyone likes their asparagus,etc, "just so". Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and got great results!

This was very delicious! I only changed a couple of things: I cut down on the olive oil to save some calories. I also used 7 eggs as 6 didn't look like it would be enough. I also added a pinch of garlic salt to the skillet when I added the mushrooms. 

I've made a frittata before and what I do is leave it uncovered on the stove top and cook it until the edges are beginning to set up. Then I put it in the oven for 10 minutes and it was perfect. 

Thanks for sharing this recipe. I will definitely have to make this again this summer.

Mine didn't quite look like the picture, but it was still pretty good. We had an inordinate amount of asparagus and we made a whole 'theme meal'... anyway, it was a little greener because of it was canned, but it was pretty tasty! I would make it again!

I used broccoli instead of aspargus but kept everything else the same. This is a good side dish if you are on the Atkins Diet! Thanks!

I also used less oil and added salt and freshly ground pepper.I found it also blend so I topped it(after it was cooked) with some crispy bacon crumbs that I cooked in the microwave.It made it a little tastier.Henny Frank

This was ok. It took over 30 minutes for the eggs to cook though.

The thyme gives this a great flavor (I also used two cloves of garlic with the veggies, as well as olive oil instead of butter).  My only issue was that the pan I used was too big, so even by adding a seventh egg it seemed a bit thin.  I may have also used a bit too much asparagus and not cut it short enough.  I'd use a smaller pan and just a smidge less asparagus next time.  Nice, easy recipe.

Fine recipe.  I used tarragon rather than thyme, and eggplant and a green pepper since that's what I had from my farm subscription.  I also mixed the cheese in with the eggs, rather than putting it on top, and used sharp cheddar.  I also put two cloves of garlic in with the vegetable mixture.  Resisted the temptation to put in some cayenne, but now wish I hadn't.  Fine for most, but I like a lot of flavor, so I find it a tad bit bland.  But I can sure taste the asparagus, which of course I love.

Oh how we loved this dish!  I made a few changes, but I am certain it would have still been great as written. :)  I added chopped up turkey hot dogs to the asparagus mixture (for more protein), and then added two large cups of packed fresh spinach to the mushrooms, until just wilted.  Only used 5 eggs, and it was plenty for 4 people (although we had french toast on the side).  I baked longer than suggested.. I would guess about 30 minutes total, but I did add sliced tomatoes to the top for color and flavor (it is summer, after all, and tomatoes are bursting with flavor now), which may have caused me to have to bake longer to evaporate the juices that the tomatoes exerted.  I used swiss and cheddar, and a little bit of parmesan - wow.. it was a very tasty and filling dish!  I think I may add some fresh garlic next time, as it would go well with the spinach.  A great base recipe to add/reduce what you like.  Oh and one more thing.  I used a springform pan (wrapped tightly with foil along the sides so no leaks), and it was a beautiful presentation once placed onto a serving dish.

This was really good. However, you need to season it very well with salt and pepper, otherwise it's a little bland. I used dried time and fresh parsley, plus an aged artisan cheese that I had on hand instead of mozz/parm. I just sauteed the asparagus and mushrooms together until they were tender - much less than 15 minutes.

Very good frittata recipe. We are watching the calories, so I subbed in Egg Beaters for the eggs and used a little less cheese and butter. Still very tasty. I will use this again and perhaps try different veggies for variety. Very easy Sunday breakfast or quick weeknight dinner.

This meal was fantastic!!  I did modify it because we have to have meat in our dinner dishes, so I cut the asparagus and mushrooms down to about 1/3 lb each and added 1/3 lb diced ham, the ham I added at the same time as the mushrooms.  The other thing that I did was add just a little of the thyme to the butter and oil just before adding the mushrooms and ham to kind of incorporate the flavor just a little more, but other than that, no changes and it was perfect.  Family is in love with this and we will definatly keep this recipie and share with family. Just what we were looking for. THANK YOU!!

This was really quite good! I had never made a frittata before and this came out great and was so easy. Like the other reviewers suggested, I cooked the asparagus for a bit less time. Also, I think I may use a bit sharper of a cheese next time, but that's just a personal preference. Very good and very easy! Highly recommended!

This was an easy recipe to make, and quite tasty. The only thing I would do, is try to get the heat a little lower (if possible) while the frittata is still on the stove top. The bottom was ever so slightly browned, but did make the frittata a little tough and rubby on bottom. Overall, excellent. Will be making this recipe again.

This was OK. The two veggies used are too bland for my taste. Neither of them have  a good strong taste to them. I liked the Frittata idea, but you would really need to add some bell peppers or meat or something more.

This is pretty good!  I scaled the recipe to 2 servings, decreased all the cooking times (as suggested in the other reviews) and substituted swiss for the mozzerella (it's what I had).  I also added a bit of pepper and hot sauce, but I think it needs even a bit more.  I'll definitely make this again. Thanks Maggi!

Very easy and tasty. I used Egg Beaters plus I decreased cooking time of asparagus as previously suggested. I also made it in a 12" skillet...it came out very thin. I think Frittatas are generally thicker but this was good. I only cooked it for 10 min before broiling.  Served it for a light dinner. Had a tossed salad and it was enjoyed by all.  A keeper!

Delicious!  Followed recs from fellow raters - 1) reduced asparagus saute time to 5 minutes; 2) added 1/2 red onion (chopped) at same time; 3) used 2 tbspn of olive oil

Modifications:  1) fresh chives instead of thyme (didn't have any fresh on hand); 2) added shredded aged gruyere cheese to the low-fat mozzarella.

Hints: I was surprised to see a (high) dome-shaped frittata when I opened the oven at 12 minutes to sprinkle the shredded cheese.  Once out of the oven for cooling, it deflated like a poked-into souffle and ended up at the height I expected a frittata to be at.  Perfectly moist slices - I will definitely be saving this recipe!

My husband loved this recipe- he inhaled it! I didn't have mushrooms, so I  substituted potatoes instead and added spring onoin. The great thing about this recipe is how versatile it is. I think it could have used more flavor- perhaps a bit of ham or bacon would make it more salty and savory.

Excellent, simple recipe. I used cast iron pan and it came out great. Had some bacon so grilled it, chopped it up and added to egg mixture for an added taste. This is also great, if you add some grilled salmon, broken up in to small pieces and added to the egg mixture. Probably the best part of the recipe is the ability to play with it and it still comes out great!!

Maggi, my hubby went crazy over this. This was my first attempt at making a frittata and I can't believe how quick and easy it was. I peeled two potatoes, thinly sliced them on my mandolin and cooked them first. I then added onion and the rest of the vegies. Subbed dill for the thyme, topped with sliced tomatoes and then the cheese. Wonderful and thanks!

I made it without mushrooms (just because I didn't have them in the house) and it was delicious!

My husband usually complains about my cooking of greens but he said he would definitely eat asparagus again cooked this way.  I too halfed the cooking time of the aspargus.

I was a bit skeptical of using up such yummy ingredients in a frittata (which is just the way I usually make an omelete!) but the asparagus and mushrooms made this sooo flavorful. The thyme is just right, so you don't really need any salt or pepper later. All I had on hand for cheese was regular shake-on parmesan - but it still tasted great! Good cold on a sandwich with some mayo too!

I found it to be a little bland tasting. It was good and simple, but bland.

I cooked bacon and used the drippings with some olive oil to begin sauteing the asparagus. I also added a little minced onion to the mix. Then I added the sliced mushrooms and continued to cook. Threw in a little fresh spinach leaves coarse chopped.  To the egg mixture I added 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce.  Very nice for a simple supper.

I was using a large pan so I increased all ingredients by 1/2. It came out perfectly and the left-over portion reheats well. I will definitely make this again and will try some of the substitutions others have listed (for my veggie adverse teens...).

I really probably shouldn't rate this recipe because I changed pretty much everything but the mushrooms and asparagus, but this was amazing. I added 5 chopped slices of lunchmeat ham, about a tablespoon of onion soup mix plus about 1/4 c of diced onion and stuck this in the oven. Not everyone liked cheese on their eggs so I was just going to let everyone add their own cheese as they wanted, but I thought this was rich enough without it that it didn't even need any cheese. This was delicious and really filly. I will definitely be using this again.

I made this for dinner tonight. I loved it. This is a terrific family supper or to take to a potluch. I used fresh basil instead of thyme and cheddar instead of Mozzarella just because they were on hand.

Good frittata.  Added some minced garlic and used a mixture of Asiago and Old Cheddar for the cheese.  Easy and delicious.

I like the recipe but thought it needed more flavor. I used salt, pepper and onion powder. Next time I will add real onion.

This is a great base recipe for a frittata that you can enhance with any vegetable of your choice. 

What I did differently for the base?  Enhanced the primary ingredients by adding 1/2 sliced yellow onion, substituted fresh shredded cheddar for the cheese.   You won't need much cheese - adjust to your taste.

The onion - first step in the process, sautéed until caramelized, then proceeded with the recipe as written, adding a small amount of butter as needed.

The other veggies?  I've used fresh spinach, added after the asparagus was sautéed, allowing it to wilt.  I like the fresh taste - watch carefully to determine doneness with the spinach.  Also added broccoli, cauliflower; I'd recommend microwaving for a bit until soft, then add after the mushrooms have cooked a bit.  Really, any veggie of your choice is a great add.   One note - if you love large quantity of veggies like I do, you may need to increase the eggs by two and incorporating a 1/8 c. of cream or milk into your egg mixture before pouring over your vegetable base.  

Great recipe.

I added some leftovers: a cup of quinoa and a couple of green onions. I added about a half cup gruyere cheese but skipped the parmesan and mozzarella (because I didn't have those cheeses in the refrigerator.) I also reduced the cooking time for the asparagus to 5 minutes. Nice thing about frittatas is you can use whatever you have on hand. Delicious recipe and will definitely make again.

Love the combo of mushrooms, asparagus and cheese. The four star rating is for the times given in the recipe. Following the time would overcook the frittata. Ingredient changes were 2 Tbsp parmesan (instead of 3), and adding salt and pepper to the egg mixture. Cooking time changes were cook asparagus for 5 minutes and another 5 minutes after adding mushrooms. Three minutes cooking time for eggs on stove top, 7 minutes in the oven, and 2 minutes under a low heat broiler.

I would give this recipe 5 stars but I ever so slightly changed it up a bit so I could make it with what I had at home. I turned into into a baked frittata using most of these ingredients. I don't have an oven-safe skillet.

Amore! Love the ingredients and the frittata was perfect! I have since used this recipe as a base and add a few other ingredients - basically what other veggies or herbs I have in the frig. It's a winner!

Very tasty!  I don't care for mushrooms so I just doubled the asparagus.  Started with sautéing a few slices of onion and some garlic before adding the asparagus.  I used a 10" sauté skillet (Kirkland brand) and it fit perfectly.  I'll use this recipe again, for sure!
