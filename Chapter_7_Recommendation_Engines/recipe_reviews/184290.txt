I cut this in recipe in half. Because I did NOT have fresh jalapeno, I substituted a couple tablespoons of mild diced green chilies. I also did not have sweetened lime juice, I added in a tablespoon of brown sugar for a bit of sweetness. Quite good.

I cut this recipe way back...and eyeballed the ingrediens a bit because of that.  This is very simple, but then again that's the essence of pico de gallo.  I used a homemade taco seasoning blend vs. a mix and opted for fresh lime juice, adding a little sugar for sweetness.

Great pico de gallo. I only used two roma tomatoes, a small white onion, a handful of fresh chopped cilatnro, some squirts of the bottled lime juice, and a sprinkle of the taco seasoning. Perfecto.... I used this to top some breakfast pizzas I made. YUM YUM.
