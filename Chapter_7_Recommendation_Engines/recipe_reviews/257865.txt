These were AMAZE. I devoured them within minutes of plating them... But of course, me being me, I added my own touches: 1) I made a nice slaw to go with, for added color (as my plates are not as colorful as the ones in the main picture for this recipe) and honestly it goes well with any taco or tostada recipe... red cabbage, sliced radishes, cilantro + juice of 1 lime & 1 tablespoon-ish brown sugar... usually I add siracha, 2 or so garlic cloves, cumin, coriander, etc to this slaw—but as the main dish was already anticipated to be pretty spicy, I stopped at the brown sugar. Serve on top of the tacos or on the side. 2) Lime-sour cream to top it all off. Again, this goes well with any taco recipe; simply take juice of 1 lime and add sour cream and fresh cracked pepper. Add as much as you want to get it to a consistency you like... this makes a really delightfully creamy appeal to counter the spiciness.

I loved  these tacos! But then again, I love anything and everything with Mexican Chorizo. I like the concept of dipping the tortilla in the chorizo grease. A little messy but delicious.

This was great! We made this with pork butt and chorizo because my daughter doesn't like the texture of ground meat, I'm glad I did because it would have been too spicy.  We also added cheese because cheese.
The second time I made this I cooked everything together in an instapot and added black beans and it was the bomb!

Amazing. I could eat just the chorizo/chipotle/adobo without any of the toppings it’s so good. Added avocado slice, lime, and chihuahua cheese

I made my own adobo sauce using my bullet, and drizzled a little bit of guacamole salsa on top. Turned out great!

These are totally authentic except one thing: the heat is about twice what I typically experience in NY, Brooklyn, and Queens. I reduced the peppers in adobo to 1/4 of the recommended amount, and they are totally perfect!!!

Super simple, super tasty. Leftover ingredients are a godsend after coming home from a night out on the town!

I loved this recipe! It was fast to make and very tasty. I wanted to stretch the recipe so added 8 oz of ground sirloin to 14 oz of chorizo.    It wasn't too spicy with the added hamburger, in fact I'd probably add less hamburger next time to keep it spicy.  Really liked the tortillas fried in chorizo fat!   Also added pepperjack cheese.  Definitely will make it again.

Woo hoo zippy!     Living in the Dallas area now briefly I was introduced to street tacos by an impromptu taco stand set up outside a Boot Barn.     OMG the best taco I ever had.   Just like this, with cilantro, and onion, but they provided lime wedges as well and the hottest taco sauce I've ever witnessed.    This recipe does not need more hot.   Just dab a little Mexican crema (like a creme fraiche) over these tacos to take the heat down a bit if you want.     Glorious.

Fantastic recipe!  A new family favorite.  I changed absolutely nothing on this recipe.  Also very easy to make.
