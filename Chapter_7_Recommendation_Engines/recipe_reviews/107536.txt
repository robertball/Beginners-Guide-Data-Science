When I substituted in Kraft light mayo and tuna packed in water the WW points came out to about 10 per main dish serving.  That's a bit much for me on a normal basis, but much better than the original 700+ calories a serving.  I think that I would cut down the amount of mayo to a 3/4 cup next time.  (and cut out about a point per serving.) --D

Very good. The dill added a nice flavor. If anything, a little heavy on the onions. I would make this all of the time.

I liked this more than I thought I would. Tuna was balanced nicely with the fresh dill, pickles, and onions. Great alternative for the kids (and adults) who love tuna sandwiches! In fact, make extra, leave out the pasta, and it would make a great tuna sandwich mix.

Perfect salad for a picnic.  I hate pickles, but they tasted okay in this salad because of the onion.

Very good. This would be great to serve as a main dish or a side dish. Great for the summer too.

This was pretty good, even coming from someone who is not overly fond of tuna salad.  The tuna flavor accented but didn't overwelm like it often can.
