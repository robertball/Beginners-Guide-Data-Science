I have been eating this since I was little. My grandmothter (who is Italian) made this often. Just want to say, it is the best and easiest soup to make.  My kids range from 5 -15 and they love it. Sprinkle with Romano cheese and serve with toasted Italian bread slices. Great for those cold winter days.

Well, I kept reading this thinking I was missing something. So I added 8 chicken bouillon cubes, 2-3 crushed garlic cloves and added a dash of pepper. VIOLA!! A delicious soup that went well with the hoagie rolls converted to cheesy garlic bread broiled to a golden brown. Hit the spot on a cold Ohio winter nite.

My kind of soup!  So easy!  Not too flavourful, not to bland, thats the way I like it.  I will make this more often!  I just have to remember to break the noodles next time.  Thanks!

One of my fav easy italian dishes. I saute tons of garlic in the oil to give it more taste then I top with grated cheese. Very yummy.

If I were to make this again I wouldn't put the pasta in or would at least only put it in each individual bowl right before serving it.  It got too soggy to fast.  Whoever said that it was just like boiled broccoli was right, but I love broccoli so that part was ok.  I added a seasoning mix called "Montreal Steak Seasoning" which really kicked up the flavor.

Very bland, I added vegetable and chicken bullion.  Really helped with the taste.  I also added water and flour mixture to thicken it a bit.  My 2 little girls really liked it.

Needed some serious ramping up.  For those who like simple food, then this is your soup.  For those of use who love the kapow of flavor....look elsewhere.  Even with adding onion and subbing chicken broth for the water it was still pretty 'meh'.  Great for the day before payday though!
