Didn't know what a poco grande glass was, so I just poured this into an old-fashioned glass.  I didn't add the stevia because my melon was plenty sweet, and I didn't think that it needed any additional sweetness.  The coconut water definitely is what you first taste, but then the subtle flavor of the watermelon kicks in.  Pretty tasty for a hot Florida day!

I love watermelon but this was not a tasteful treat.  I don't like the aftertaste of this drink.
