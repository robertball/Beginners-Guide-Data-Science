I added more garlic, ginger and soy sauce (about double) than called for and ALWAYS add brown sugar to the soy sauce. It makes the flavor incredible. I also mix the cornstarch with the water and add it at when I put in the broccoli at the end.  Once the broccoli is 1/2 done I add the soy sauce, ginger and garlic. I notice if you add it earlier the flavor becomes more mild as it cooks.

I am giving this a HIGH FIVE because even though I started with the original recipe, and I ended up tweaking it a bit to suit OUR taste, it is an EXCELLENT "as is" recipe. I followed instructions to a tee until the celery. I haven't heard of too many stir fry recipes calling for celery that I liked in the past, so I REPLACED the celery for the same amount of green cabbage. The amount of water it called for, at that point I felt would have been too wet for us (perhaps using the cabbage instead of celery???) I used only 1/4 cup of water and bullion. I also added after tasting it, another full table spoon of soy sauce and a tsp of crushed garlic. this made my husband say, "WOWIE                                                     WOW WOW WOW!" (He is usually a ONE WOW guy and THAT is even a good thing!) Thank you for a great recipe that is good AS IS and can be tweaked and probably STILL just as GOOD. THANKS!

This is a good basic recipe that is easy to modify to your personal tastes.  I used the frozen stir fry veggies I had on hand and added mushrooms, baby corn, & water chestnuts.  Chicken broth is my sub for bouillon.  I agree with many of the posters who said it needs more spice and also those who had to use a little extra cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  During the last few minutes of cooking, I added red pepper, garlic powder, and soy sauce for more flavor and a handful of cashews for a little crunch.  My family gave my version 4 stars.  This is a good recipe to play around with and add your own touches.

This REALLY tasted great and with the corn starch, had the consistency of restaurant Chinese food.  I LOVED how the chicken tasted after coating with cornstarch, and THEN frying in a pan.  To keep cals low, I used Pam Olive Oil Spray, and it worked great.   Actually maybe better because it browned very nicely.  Chicken breast is hard to keep moist anyway, and this method was excellent.  Half of the corn starch stuck to the bag, so I diluted 2 TBSP corn starch in chicken broth and added after everything was combined.  It thickened right up!  Needs more salt, but some may not want it.   GREAT recipe!

I made this recipe for my husband and my son and they both liked it. However, we all agreed that it needed a little something more. Some kind of sauce coating the chicken and vegetables. I assumed that the water and bouillon would do that, but it didn't. It just cooked down to almost nothing. I will make this recipe again but I will try putting some kind of sauce along with it.

Well I cooked this recipe tonight for dinner and I loved it.  I changed the recipe around a bit.  I actually forgot that I didn’t have cornstarch so I tried substituting flour (2 tbls flour to each 1 tbls cornstarch)… which I heard could be used, but I don’t really think it worked.  So in turn, the sauce was thin but we ate it over rice and it was still very delicious.  I also used about a half a tbls of fresh ginger instead of ground because it was what we had.  To the vegetable mixture, I added some mushrooms and corn.  I liked this recipe very much and will most fix it again.

The great thing about a stir-fry is that its like a bad day fishing, because its still ends up being a good day! You can add just about anything you want to the basic recipe and it will probably end up good. My girlfriend and I added bok choy and Chinese noodles. And a bag of frozen veggies helped speed up the process. The ginger coated chicken was very good and the Chinese noodles were a refreshing change over the standard white rice. If you use the Chinese noodles, just be aware they cook much faster than regular pasta. So grab your chopsticks and dig in!

This was easy and good.  I found at the end of cooking you need to add more ginger. Everyone in my home enjoyed it.

I wanted a way to finish off my veggies before they went bad... and this was quick, easy, and tasted a lot better than the effort I put in would warrant it.  Feel free to use your own mix of veggies; I had onions, carrots, and bell papers.  I also agree that a little bit (1.5 tbls?) of brown sugar is a nice touch.

This is not a 5-star recipe as is, but you can make it one by changing a few things.  First, ditch the powdered spices in favor of fresh garlic and ginger. Also, add a teaspoon or two of brown sugar and a teaspoon of rice vinegar to the soy sauce/spice marinade.  Next, save the corn starch for use with the chicken broth. Lastly, ditch the water and bouillon for real chicken broth.  Throw in some fresh diced cayenne peppers with the veggies, and now you've got a 5-star recipe.

Great recipe, just a few modifications:
- DO NOT ADD WATER  or bouillon granules
this makes it soupy--only cook in light olive oil--not too much or it gets greasy and runny
- Nor garlic powder

-Coat Chicken with Cornstrach AFTER you have marinated it in soy sauce, ginger, and chopped onions--this holds the chicken together when you cook it in the pan

-add brown sugar to the vegtables to sweeten them a little (I added a green Bell pepper to my veg. mix too), and add ginger to the vegtables and a little soy sauce when they are being cooked in light olive oil

- I like my stir fry on the dryer side with the vegatables crisp and not bubbly and soupy others like it other ways--this is best to me

This is delicious, especially with a bit of added spice (hot pepper flakes). It tasted even better the next day for lunch!

This recipe is good, but needs tweaking.  I added a few cloves of sliced garlic to the chicken first.  Then subbed one can of chicken broth (low sodium) for the water and bouillon.  I added half the broth when water was called for.  Then at the end, I used the other half of the broth with 2T cornstarch, 2T soy sauce, 1T brown sugar, 1/2 t ginger and 1/2 t garlic powder mixed in to make more sauce.  It thickens up in minutes and makes more sauce and increases flavos.  Absolutely fabulous!  Note:  I also used lowsodium soy sauce so recipe is not salty at all. Served over rice.

very good recipe with some updates. I doubled the cornstarch, soy sauce, ginger and garlic powder. added more chicken and vegetables too. Instead of celery I used asparagus cut into inch pieces and I also used chicken broth instead of the water. I will certainly make this again! Also, put the chicken in a container and shake versus a bag much easier.

The prep time took longer than I expected. I used 4 chicken thighs which needed to be skinned and cut. I also cut up all the veggies in the morning. That all took up 40 minutes (I'm a slow chopper??) This all sat in the fridge for 9 hours. When I got home from work it was easy to throw the rest of the meal together. I substituted peas instead of broccoli and added half a green pepper. Per other posters, I cut the water to 1/2 cup and added 2 TBL teriyaki. Very tasty! I put it on top of brown rice because it is healthier... but I think white would have tasted better :)

I've tried this recipe multiple times, and I don't know why, but no matter how much I want it to taste amazing, the flavor always manages to come out a little "blah".  The most recent try, I followed other reviewers' advice and doubled the sauce, adding it with the chicken broth at the end. I added some chili paste, some brown sugar, and even a dash of worcestershire. I also included minced garlic and cooked it all in sesame oil. Then topped with some peanuts, which was nice.  But there was still no real 'pop' of flavor like I hoped for.  Does it have anything to do with the fact that all of the chicken coating comes off and adheres itself to the bottom of my wok when cooking?  I have to scrape it off or else it burns, so maybe that's my problem... If trying it again, I would add some salt, or more soy sauce, and go really heavy on the stronger seasonings, and add some red pepper flakes.  Just not sure whether there will be another try, though.

Very good.  Doubled up on the spices and sauce as some suggested, even though I only used half the chicken.  I marinated for four hours.  I saved the marinade and put back in at the end and the cornstarch thickened the sauce nicely.  I served with fried rice, and also made the Japanese zucchini and onions from this site as a first course.

I liked this recipe. Pretty basic, no wow flavors but really quick and easy to follow.  I added red pepper flakes for some heat because that is what we like.  Had no celery so I replaced with some fresh mushrooms.  Maybe could have used some white wine at some point or sesame oil for additional flavor? but overall, easy and quick basic recipe.

This recipe is spectacular!  It rivals one of my favorite dishes at a local Chinese restaurant... in fact, I think I may like it even better.  I omit the celery since I don't usually have it in my fridge and I don't miss it in the recipe.  I also use chicken broth instead of the bouillion granules & water... again, just what I have on hand.  Also, I dice the onion up instead of cutting it into wedges and I use frozen broccoli florets instead of fresh because I always have a bag of broccoli in my freezer.  (I have used both fresh & frozen broccoli and have not been able to tell a difference in taste or texture).  Minor changes that don't really affect the taste, just suited to our preferences.  I have been making this dish for several years, it is a family favorite for sure!  Even my two little picky eaters love this dish!

When I saw this recipe, it had 777 ratings...so I knew it had to be a lucky choice.  I used different veggies than the original calls for (mushrooms, zucchini, bell pepper, and onion), but only because that is what I had available.  The nice thing about this recipe is that it's flexible.  The chicken I mariated EXACTLY to instructions and wouldn't change a thing about that.  I did add about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and a dash of red pepper flakes at the same time as the bouillon. Easy and amazingly delicious...My kind of recipe!

This recipe was super fast and I had everything on had. I used frozen brocoli. I had to change the cornstartch to flour because of an allergy. To do that just use double the amount of flour. I would like more sauce with it, but it was delicious! Had it on top of chow mein noodles and  plain ramen also.

Good recipe but i added some stuff for flavor.  I added some fresh garlic, green onions, a dash of oyster sauce, couple anise, dash of basil, a bit of sesame oil, and pepper. The extra spices gave the sauce the kick it needed. :D

Add Two TBS Brown Sugar to Sauce and then double.  Put one part on chicken for marinade and save the other part for pouring over the veggies when you stirfry them.

Yummy, but I gave it only four starts because the flavor was light.  I had to double the seasonings.  I will make this again!

This stir fry = AMAZING!!! The best chicken stir fry I've made by far! I followed the tips from fellow reviewers and did the following: used frozen stir fry veggies in place of the fresh ones, doubled the soy sauce, ginger, and garlic, and used 1 cup chicken broth in place of the water/bouillon. I also added a tad more cornstarch/water mixture at the end to thicken the sauce up a bit. This is definitely a top 10 favorite of mine!

This was wonderful. So wonderful.....I photographed it! Healthy and easy. I made some rice and it was a done meal. In my prior life I never spent time cooking and never understood how cooking related to loving your family. I do, now. :)  This one is definitely in the favorite category. Thank you Lori!

My whole family liked this recipe (which is rare).  I added sliced greed and red peppers and zucchini and it tasted great.  Red pepper flakes were a must for me & hubby.

This was amazing! I added bean sprouts, mushrooms and green onions. The flavor was perfect and the sauce wasn't too thin. I also mixed in some cooked Asian noodles to make it a bigger dish. The chicken pieces had great flavor and were very tender. I'll definitely make this again!!

First let me say this is the easiest recipe to make that has so many wonderful flavors!!  I used a large ALL Clad frying pan, my Wok is in the attic, although I am having hubby bring it down for this recipe!.   Anyhow,  I took others suggestions and modified it a little.  Instead of broccoli I used 1 can of drained sweet peas.  I doubled the soy sauce, ( i use low sodium version) I doubled the ground ginger and garlic powder.  I used 3/4 c water instead of 1c as the recipe requested.  Everything else I left exact.  This was so delicious and healthy!  I will make this all the time!  It was not the slightest soggy.  It was 100% PERFECT!   Now how often do you hear that!  I can't thank the poster enough for posting this delicious healthy recipe.  THANK YOU!    We ate it as is with no starchy sides.  Trying to watch our carbs.  lol  This recipe is a must in any kitchen, its flavorful, healthy and oh so easy and can be made from scratch in minutes!  Literally!

I did not enjoy this stir fry whatsoever.  I used chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon and tripled the spices to try and get more flavor into it - it was still bland and unimpressive.  I will definitely not be using this one again.

Very good basic stir-fry recipe.  I doubled the soy sauce, ginger and garlic powder and altered the veggie to suit our tastes.  I used broccoli, onion, celery, snow peas, a red pepper, and peanuts.  Served over jasmine rice it was delicious!  Because I used so many veggies, we had leftovers for days (a good thing)!

This recipe is good as is, but it needs more. I really liked that it is healthy, and I added a ton of veggies.. but next time I'm going to add more spices, and definitely more salt. I did have to add some cornstarch at the end to thicken it up.

This is so yummy!
I've made it twice this week, doubling it the second time.
I used fresh garlic (it's a staple in our house).

This is super yummy.

I had to make some changes to make this 5 stars, but wow it was DELICIOUS once I did! I doubled the soy sauce and garlic, so basically put the chicken/cornstarch with 4 T soy sauce, 1/2 t ginger, and 1/2 t garlic powder in a bag and let sit in fridge for 30 mins like the recipe said. Instead of the veggies I used half a bag of frozen stir fry veggies. I used 1/2 cup water w/1 chicken boullion cube and added more cornstarch/water to the chicken/veggie mixture until it thickened. The only thing though was that it needed about 1/4 cup sauce....like teriyaki type sauce. I will look for a recipe on this website for the sauce or just buy some at the store. This was sooooooo good.

This was better than even I expected.  I made almost exactly as directed.  My only changes were fresh ginger and garlic....and napa cabbage instead of celery.  My whole family really liked it.  I have never made a stir-fry that everyone liked.  They especially raved about how good the chicken tasted. I will use less water next time....it was a little too much for me.  But it is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

The flavor and textures reminded me of a chinese restaurant. I did change the vegetables a little, I use broccoli, onion, green bell pepper and water chestnuts, but I think it would be good whatever I used. It was a little bland after I added the water, so I just whipped up another batch of soy sauce/ginger/garlic and added some brown sugar and it was great.

mmmmm!  I ended up adding 3c mushrooms, 9c broccoli, and 1 red pepper, along with the half a big onion, 2 carrots, and a celery stalk.  I ended up taking out the chicken, adding the veggies and some water and steaming for 5 min.  I ended up adding a little more than a cup of water, with an added sprinkle of cornstarch, in order to make a bit of sauce.  I also doubled the spices when added to the chicken.  Sooo tasty!
I would add more veggies and a little more than double the ginger next time.  YUM!!!

The chicken turned out great. Moist and flavorful. Almost sweet. I used crystallized ginger instead since I was out of ground. I also used a pre-made frozen mix of stir-fry vegetables which made it easy. I'll make this again.

Great Meal. I doubled the seasonings as suggested by some other reviewers and also added a little water when cooking vegetables to prevent burning. I also made white rice and stirred it in at the end and heated the whole thing through. Delicious!

This is an excellent recipe.  Very delicious flavor.  We omitted the celery since my husband doesn't like it.  We added cabbage and mushrooms.  We also added about 2 tablespoons soysauce than what the original recipe called for.  We will definitely make this again and often.  We LOVE it!

My kids asked for MORE.  YAY!  I followed the recipe with just a few changes. For one, I used half sesame oil and half olive oil. Then I doubled the sauce that marinates the chicken and I added yellow squash and zuchinni.   Super Healthy and Super Tasty!

Really good - knowing that 6 minutes with constant stirring on high heat will allow your veggies to be crisp-tender is a good thing to know.    I actually had already cooked chicken, so I just added 1 Tablespoon cornstarch to the 1Cup chicken broth after tossing the chicken into the stir-fried veggies and it worked perfectly.  Used fresh garlic and ginger too.

This was just okay as written. The ginger was a little too strong. We like ginger but the flavors were not balanced. I thought even though the ginger was strong, it was rather bland. Next time, I will cut down on the corn starch because it took away from the soy sauce, making it bland. I will also add some crushed red pepper flakes and a touch of sugar as others mentioned. I think with minor adjustments, the ginger would not overpower the dish. Even better would be fresh ginger and garlic.

SO GOOD!  I gave it 4 stars because I made some changes to the recipe!  I finished making this and was so surprised with myself!  I did make some changes though.  I added a handful of sliced fresh mushrooms, and green and red peppers to add more color.  Also, instead of using a cup of water and bouillon cubes, I just added chicken stock.  So good though!

Great base recipe. Like others, the sauce didn't thicken very well so I added another tablespoon of cornstarch while stir-frying. I also took the advice of another reviewer & added some chopped cashews near the end of the cooking process and the crunchy texture & slightly sweet taste was great. Also, I sprinkled in some brown sugar to the stir fry along with additional soy sauce, ginger and garlic powder, and a dash of Worcestershire sauce.

This was yummy! The chicken's texture was just like from a Chinese restaurant. It was a little bit bland, that's why I have it four stars, but then I doubled the soy sauce/garlic powder/ginger part and added about 1.5 tablespoons of brown sugar and about 1/4 cup of orange juice, it was even better. I also bought a package of lo mein noodles and cooked those, mixed them in the pan, and then it was like chicken lo mein. Very yummy, even my 3 year old and 1.5 year old liked it!

Thank you for a core recipe that I can finally make for my family! We haven't had Chinese food in years (mustard & nut allergies), so something that is easy to make & closely resembles restaurant style Chicken & ___ (insert vegetable of choice here) is a delight.

I cooked this in a non-stick skillet & the chicken's coating stuck to the bottom of the pan like crazy, so instead of removing the chicken & trying to saute the veggies in the pan (sure to result in something burning), I steamed the veggies lightly & just added them to the pan when the chicken had cooked through. Then added chicken broth instead of water, extra ginger, some brown sugar, & the wonderful tip someone else wrote to mix some broth with the stuff left in the bag, which thickened up the sauce very nicely. I made sure to scrape the bottom of the pan as it cooked. A taste test had me adding a little extra soy sauce (instead of salt) to boost the flavor. Needs a little "more" of something (garlic? ginger? can't tell yet), but I am looking forward to working with this recipe for years to come. I bet it's delightful with shrimp, beef, whatever you want. I used broccoli, cauliflower, & scallions--delicious. Thanks so much!

This recipe is great for a couple of reasons.  One is the flavor of the marinated chicken - it tastes great!  The other is cooking the veggies separately so they maintain their own taste and texture.  You can really use any veggies - I threw in corn instead of carrots and celery.  A big hit with the husband!

I made this for the first time the other night for my boyfriend.  It was great!  I have not had a lot of experience cooking and it turned out perfect.  I did leave out the onions and celery and added a small can of water chestnuts.  I am thinking about adding baby corn and mushrooms next time I make it.  You can have fun and do anything you like to it. Great recipe!

This is the first time I've tried this one and it was a big success w/ my two picky boys (11 and 12). They even were going for seconds, on the chicken. They said they loved the chicken and wanted me to make more right then!

Very good and quick meal!  I gave it 4 stars only because I think the sauce was a little bland.  That being said, the posibilities with this dish are endless. Next time, we're adding pineappe and cashews for a little twist.

Just made this recipe and it was great!  I made a few changes, just because of other's reviews.  I cut the chicken into cubes.  I added roughly 2 tbsp. of honey to the pan and cooked the chicken in the honey then took the chicken out.  I got to cheat because we have a 5lb. bag of frozen stir-fry mix, so I added four cups of that to a Pam sprayed pan.  I cooked that for about 5 minutes.  I boiled water and mixed the bouillon cube in it.  I added 1/2 cup of water with the cube into the stir-fry mix, which may have been a bit too much water because I had to cook at high for about 15 minutes to get the extra juice out.  Then, I added about a tsp. of garlic powder, 1tbsp. of soy sauce and cooked that.  It was soooo good and my bf was actually really liked it too.  I will definitely make this again.  I will just add maybe one more chicken breast and another two cups of stir-fry mix because we ate it all.  Awesome!

This was very tasty, but it wasn't very pretty as the picture suggests it will be.  So 5 stars for flavor, 3 stars for presentation.

Easy and pretty good. I added mushrooms and it would have benefited from some fresh ginger. I also should have added a little brown sugar like another reviewer said, but I forgot!

Loved it!! Made the recipe exactly as stated, except I left out the ginger because it's not a favorite in my family. This meal was easy, quick, and tasted great! The only thing I noticed is that the recipe only calls for four ounces of chicken, which I think is a little light, so I used a pound and a half instead. Otherwise, everything came out just right. :-)

Really did not care for this. I followed the instructions to the T and it turned out to be a goopy mess.  I think it was the cornstarch, but even without that I don't think the flavor was all that good.  Because we used fresh vegetables we ate it with a lot of chow mein noodles and soy sauce.  Continuing my quest for a good stir-fry recipe.

Good, but needed a bit more flavor. I added 3x chicken bouillon and some more garlic powder, ginger, and soy sauce at the end. I saw the comments about the brown sugar and will try that next time.

Flavor was a little on the light side, so I added a little extra bouillon. I was out of broccoli, so I substituted sliced green pepper, water chestnuts, and pineapple chunks. The flavor reminded me a little of chow mein. Loved the meat marinade! Perfect amount of ginger since I'm not a big fan of it.

I followed this recipe exact and I was not impressed at all. The idea of it is good but overall was WAY too bland and I'm not a heavy salt person as it is. It needed more flavor..I probably would double the whole soy mixture if I would make it again. Sorry..I wanted to like it.

Made it "as is" and it was pleasant enough - was actually much tastier the next day! The coating in a baggie with cornstarch and then adding the wet ingredients is BRILLIANT - so much better than adding the cornstarch at the end.
My only complaint is that it is a teeny bit bland/generic -- looking forward to ramping it up with different veggies and spices.
5 stars for the process + 3 stars for the end result = 4 stars all over.

Good recipe but I thought it needed more soy sauce and garlic.

We have done stir-fry in our family many times but this was the first time I actually followed a recipe.  The part of coating the chicken in the cornstarch and soy sauce mixture was new to me.  It really turned out good.  I prefer a little more sauciness so I think next time I will add more liquid.  I took this to work the next day and ate the leftovers.  We will continue to use this recipe at our house.

We enjoyed this a lot. I did double the soy/ginger/garlic and added it in with the vegetables. I also added mushrooms and peppers, any vegetable will work well.  I also added a bit more cornstarch with the chicken broth so the end result was a nicely thickened sauce. A bit of chili paste gave it a nice heat too.

I've made this recipe a few times and the whole family loves it. I use whatever veggies I have on hand, but fresh broccoli and snow peas are a hit in our house. Very easy to make. You can cut the chicken and veggies up ahead of time which make meal time prep much quicker.

This recipe is not bad at all as is, but needed a bit more flavor for my and my boyfriend's taste, so the second time I made it I tweaked it a bit- Instead of coating the chicken with cornstarch I only coated it with the soy sauce/ginger/garlic mixture. Then I followed the recipe until I got to the part where you add the water to the veggies- I mixed the cornstarch into the water with the bouillon, along with another 2 tbsp soy sauce, 1/2 tsp ginger, and 1/4 tsp garlic powder. Then I poured that mixture into the veggies and added the chicken. It thickened right up and turned out much more flavorful! You can also use the frozen stir fry veggie mix to make it even simpler. Love it!

This is a really good, easy recipe. I used cabbage and carrots, and I didn't have the garlic powder, so I doubled the boullion. However, that made it a tad too chickeny so I wouldn't do that in the future. Still good, though.

Wonderful! I doubled the sauce, and added a bit of red pepper flakes to it. I also cut down on the celery, and added red and green bell pepper strips. (Mushrooms will also be added next time) Any vegetable will work in this. The aroma was fantastic. It was quick and easy to make. Made my house seem like a Chinese restaurant! Will be making this again and again!

This was delicious and so easy to make!  I used frozen stir fry vegetables and also added frozen broccoli.  Served over rice, this was a huge hit in my family and a fast dish to make!  Will definitely make again during the week..

This was a pretty good base recipe. I switched up the veggies a bit to what my family and I like, you can pretty much put any veggie you want in stir-fry! I used, carrots, celery (which I won't use next time, the taste wasn't right), onion, zuchini, mushrooms, broccoli, and I was going to add pea pods but there wasn't enough room! A wok really works best for stir-fry. I also used more soy sauce once all the meat and veggies were combined. I used about the same amount of oyster sauce too, that adds a great flavor! After I added the water and chicken bouillon granules I needed to add more corn starch to thicken. I just kept adding until it looked the consistency I wanted. I served it with seaweed wrapped rice (Nori, you can get it at any Asian market) and kimchi (a korean side, very delicious and SUPER good for you!)

Great recipe. I stir fried the chicken with some crushed red pepper and asian seasoning. I had a bag of stir fry vegies from the store so I stir fried those with a whole chopped yellow onion. At the end I only used 1/2 cup water but added a couple tablespoons of soy sauce, a tsp of chopped garlic and a 1/2 tbl of peanut oil. Yum!

This was a great stir fry recipe...probably the best I have made at home.  It rivals what you get at a good chinese restaurant.  I made a few adjustments.  Added mushrooms...my personal favorite.  Also, doubled the sauce because I always end up wanting more sauce with a rice dish.  I followed some others' advice and added a little cornstarch and a dash of soy sauce to the sauce mixture before incorporating it.  I also sprinkled a little brown sugar and some extra garlic powder and ginger into the dish right at the end for more flavor.  With my adjustments, close to five stars.  My fiance loved it too.  Will definitely make again and try adding cabbage next time too.

This was pretty good but not five star and not outstanding, I probably wouldn't make this again. I used 2 big chicken breast halves. It was "missing" something, not sure what, maybe some red pepper flakes, salt, more soy sauce?

It was okay. A little bland for our liking, but if you add some spices or worcestershire, it's allright.

I agree with most posters that this is a great basic recipe to follow but definitely needs some extra touches.  I doubled up on the spices,cornstarch and soy sauce as well as added 2 tbsp's of kraft peanut butter and it made a delicious thick sauce, plenty to cover the rice and stir fry =)

Good base recipe for chicken stir-fry, especially good for new cooks.  It tasted a little bland the first time I cooked it (followed the recipe exactly).  The second time I cooked it, I basically added all the same spices in the recipe plus the reviewers' suggestions (brown sugar) times six!  It was much better the second time and much for flavorful.

This was a great dish.  I used 1 can of chicken broth instead of water and chicken bouillon, added a bit more ginger,  2 tablespoons of chili garlic paste for a bit of heat and flavor, and a bunch of scallions instead of a regular onion.  The hubby loved it!

This is basically the same recipe as "Broccoli Chicken Stir-Fry" except no onion or celery(I don't use onion, celery or carrot), and you don't coat the chicken with cornstarch, you mix it with water til smooth and pour into the pan. I think that way is better. I've made chicken by coating w/ cornstarch before and it does leave the chicken with a funky, mushy coating after it's cooked. I don't understand the need for that method.

I wasn't sure about the chicken marinade, but it was so good in the stirfry!  I marinated it all day and it was quite tasty.   I added eggplant chunks and squash fresh from the garden, which was nice.  I will definitely make this again!

Excellent recipe!  I used broccoli, julienned carrots, snap peas, water chestnuts, baby corn and onion and it was DELICIOUS.  Make sure you refrigerate your chicken before stir frying or it will paste up when fried.  Sauce is so versatile that it will tolerate any vegetable modification you can think of.  Don't miss this can't go wrong recipe!!!!!

This is really good. I served it with brown rice and added a little more soy sauce. Kids didn't care for it, but hubby really liked it and so did I. I will make it again and probly play around with it. Thanks

This was a wonderful recipe.  I made the following changes as others suggested:
added a Tbls soy sauce to the chicken. I was afraid the vegis would be bland so I added soy sauce, ginger and garlic to them as well.
I also used different vegi's, green and red bell peppers, mushrooms, onions and carrots.

Oh, I also added cornstarch to the water at the end...esential addition!

Is a definite keeper!

Pretty tasty!  I did add some brown sugar to the soy sauce combo to baste the chicken.  I used carrots instead of the celery for a great taste and brighter colors.  Thanks!

Wonderful! I added ginger, soy sauce, and garlic to the vegetables, too and used chicken broth (less than suggested). I also added bean sprouts...it was delicious!

This recipe is FANTASTIC! I changed only a few things... I doubled the amount of spices and soy sauce to the marinade and i used flour instead of the cornstarch because I didn't have any. Other than that i followed the recipe as is. Will make this again.

My whole family loved this delicious stir-fry. I only used 3 chicken breasts. I added 1 Tbs. of Worcestershire sauce and cauliflower and green pepper. (because i added more veggies, i added 1/2 more water and 1/4 tsp. bouillon) I will make this recipe again for sure.

This is a very straight foward, easy, and tasty recipe. I forgot to add ginger and used frozen stir fry veggies. Had this with yellow rice and found the chicken stir fry really good. Will make this again.

Tasted amazing! Granted I made a few changes (I always do to make stuff spicier for my taste) but I loved the instructions and the spicing of this recipe. I made it with shrimp and a frozen bag of stir-fry veggies. Also added some cole slaw mix to the pot. Added hot sauce in the plastic bag, added some seasoned salt, hot sauce, oyster sauce and white pepper to the pot when cooking shrimp. Added Chinese (mung bean) noodles at the end to complete the meal (based on another reviewer's suggestion). LOVED IT! The leftovers tasted great the next day too!

Absolutely tastes amazing! I had taken advice from the previous comments and while the chicken and veggies were being cooked together last minute, I added more cornstarch, garlic powder, and soy sauce. The first time I made it I had to add more cornstarch to thicken it b/c the water recommended in the recipe was too much. The second time I made this recipe, I added less water and it was perfect. I love vegetables so I added a greater amount of green peppers, carrots, broccoli, and mushrooms. My sister is a cook and loved it! She even asked for advice on how to make it! I felt very impressed with myself :o)

Thank you for a GREAT stir-fry recipe. This was wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly, except for doubling the sauce.  This was a must. It was absolutely delicious, and we will def make it again.

We had most of a large veggie tray left over from a party, so I thought I'd make a stir fry. My husband is more of the wok cooker than me, so a few times I thought I had a disaster on my hands, but in the end it turned out really well. Cut the chicken into cubes, doubled the marinade (used fresh garlic and 2 TBS brown sugar) and did not coat with corn starch. I started out stir frying a beaten egg just because that's what my husband does, but it was kind of unnecessary - only wound up sprinkling it on the final dish. Also, I just dumped the bag of chicken with marinade into the wok and I probably shouldn't have; took about 3 times as long to cook the chicken. Sprinkled some sesame seeds on while it was cooking. Dissolved a bouillon cube in a cup of water, made another 'recipe' of marinade (using the garlic powder this time and only 1 TBS brown sugar) and used another reviewer's advice to mix in the corn starch here. Once thickened, spooned over brown rice. Tasty but could have used a little more zing. Next time, I'll sprinkle some white pepper over the chicken as it cooks.

Pretty decent.  I had lots of extra veggies in the fridge that I didn't want to go to waste so this was perfect.  I used bean sprouts instead of celery, added mushrooms and red pepper.  Left the sauce the same except I added 1/2 cup of water and some brown sugar.

Made just as.  While cooking, everything looked and tasted great.  However, when it came time to eat, it reminded me of "mush" and I just didn't like the way it tasted.  Maybe it was something I did, but I will try it again!

Fixed as written, except used fresh garlic and ginger. There was no extra sauce when everything was added together. It wasn't dry, just not saucey. Flavor was very good. Husband said it was "very healthful". Not a raving review. I will keep it in my rotation and try to jazz it up abit, Double the sauce too. Oh, I had packaged stir fry veggies, so had snow peas, broccoli and shredded carrots and bok choy. I added sliced onion.

This was an excellent recipe.  Followed it to the letter and enjoyed every bite.  I've used snow peas and green beans in place of the broccoli, too.  Quick and healthy weeknight meal.  :)

This is an awesome basic stir fry recipe.  You can change it up a little depending on the vegetables you have on hand.  I used Carrots, Green Pepper and Onion. I did sprinkle on a bit of crushed red pepper for a tad bit of heat.  I also added just about a teaspoon or so of brown sugar to sweeten just a little and at the end I put in  a swig of Sesame Oil which seems to help all the flavors blend. This is really really good.  You should try this one, seriously!

This has become a healthy staple in our house.  Relatively simple, full of veggies.  We serve it over some brown rice and some soy sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe.  My husband loved it.  The only thing I did "different" was to use a pre-packaged mix of stir-fry veg in place of the veg as specified.  This is a versatile recipe ... I will definitely make again!

Tasted more like the filling of chicken pot pie than stir fry. Not worth making.....not sure why it has 4.5 stars.

So yummy! I made this for my picky little sister who normally hates vegetables.. and she went back for seconds! It was very tasty and the brown sugar tip was also great.  It neutralized the bitterness of the soy sauce.  I also tried to cut down the sodium intake by using lite soy sauce and sodium free chicken granules. I'm definitely making this again in the future!

This turned out pretty good.  I followed the recipe other than using fresh garlic instead of powder and no celery but some cabbage, plus I doubled it.  I used half the amount of water though since we don't like our veggies soggy.  My husband said this was much better than using the store bought stir fry sauce I usually use and it was so easy!  Added some extra soy sauce when I added the veggies too.  Update:  I think the sauce also needs to be added to the vegetable mix.  The chicken had lots of flavor but the veggies were crisp but bland.  Need to intermix the flavor throughout more.  Other reviews suggested doing the cornstarch later so I might try adding more than just in the chicken marinade which I did had about a tsp of brown sugar.  Also I added those thin snow peas and that was good.

This was quite tasty.  I couldn't resist putting in some Chili Sauce, Hoisin Sauce and Jalapenos.  My additions made it a bit spicier than what it needed to be.  However, I still really enjoyed the recipe.

Not sure I needed to add the cup of water with the bouillon at the end. Didn't thicken up very well and made the dish a little soggy, but great taste overall. I will make again without the addition of water.

I agree with the reviewer that said this was a very good basic recipe that can easily be modified.  I thought this needed a little extra seasoning (maybe double the sauce?) and it's great because you can use any vegetables you have on hand, not just the ones in the recipe.  I made this because I wanted to clear some veggies from my fridge so I used asparagus, zucchini, and carrots and it was really good.

Very good-I subbed in some broccoli instead of celery. I thought this was a touch salty also but I think that was probably the soy sauce I used. the sauce thickened up really nicely with the cornstarch and tasted great-will definitely be making this again.

This is really good. I used fresh ginger and fresh garlic. used 16 oz of chicken and drained the marinade before stir frying it. I then added chicken broth to the leftover marinade and also the cornstarch. I added it to the chicken and cooked it till thick. I used whatever fresh veggies I had on hand, and mushrooms.

I made this last night and it was amazing! I am a newlywed and I am not a cook at all, so I keep trying new things out to make for myself and husband and let me tell ya that this recipe is great. My husband works nights and so I have to make sure I make something that can be reheated and still taste good and IT DID! My husband loved it! I did add more of the soy sauce, ginger, and garlic to the veggies. Also, I added fresh garlic as well. Awesome recipe! I will be making this again.

I am totally clueless when it comes to stir fry techniques. This was so simple and awesome! Great technique on how to cook the chicken to pull out a good but subtle flavor of soy sauce. I'll use this recipe over and over. Any fresh vegetables will do!

02-09-2011- Cooked this last night, and family loved it, my daughter even went back for seconds. We tried different veggies, and ate it with brown rice, but still an easy, quick, and tasty recipe. It's very easy to add more soy sauce or spices for taste if you need to.

Easy to prepare and received the approval of the whole family.  Like several others, I left out the celery and added cabbage.  I also doubled the soy sauce.  We added baby corn because it's a favorite of my kids.  Will definitely make this again.

Good, but as other reviewers suggested, a little bland. It came out well because of additions, but the recipe as it stands needs something else.

I will continue to search for a great stir-fry.  My husband and I thought this was bland.  We added extra soy sauce and he added red pepper flakes.  Better.

Really good I did add some brown sugar as suggested in comments since I like a sweeter flavor and am not a big soy sauce fan. Only bad was that my sauce didn't thicken!

It was pretty good! We like things a little more spicy than the recipe as is though. I also used fresh ginger and added some additional veggies. Next time, I will use sesame oil and use some more chicken broth so it will be a little saucier.

This is a great base recipe! relatively bland, but i usually prefer my stir fry simple, my fiancee on the other hand likes flavour and was not impressed with this meal, so i added some spicy thai chilli sauce to his and he was happy. I also added worcestershire and some extra soy sauce, but with some tweaks this turned out well and i will definitely make again

This is a great recipe if you are looking for a quick meal.  It seems to also be quite adaptable.  I didn't have ginger, so I added some teriyaki sauce just to add some flavor.  I will be trying again with the ginger.  It was a bit bland but still good.  I will also try and crisp the chicken a bit more.  It browned but tasted a little gummy from the cornstarch.   The veggies were very tasty!

This recipe was great!! However, instead of boulion cubes, I used french onion soup, with great results! I also thinly sliced the carrot to almost a pasta like thickness. Yum!

Great recipe...I read some recommendations and mixed it up a bit.  For the veggies, instead of onion, I used garlic (sauteed and then added the veggies) and then used instead of celery and carrots...red and green pepper, sugar snaps, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower.  I also mixed another batch of the marinade ingredients, and poured it over the veggies....then sprinkled with even more garlic, and served over long grain rice...delish!

This was awesome!  Everyone loved it.  I used a clove of garlic instead of garlic powder and a cup of fat free chicken broth instead of the water & bouillon.  I also omitted the celery as my hubby is not fond of it.  One thing I did add that is not in the original ingredient list was a tablespoon of oyster sauce...mmmm.  My hubby went and got some peanuts out of the cupboard and put some on top.  Delicious!  I am soooo making this again!  Thanks!

Very good, but I agree need much more soy & ginger & cornstarch. I also added green peppers and zuchinni from my garden.

Good!  It was definitely salty.  I did add a bit more soy sauce, though I used low sodium soy sauce.  I will use less next time and probably omit the chicken bouillon.  Also, I would use less chicken and more veggies.  Broccoli is really good in this!!

I did make a couple very small adjustments.... I leave out the ginger (not a big fan) and add extra soy sauce and garlic powder at the end.  I've been making this recipe for almost a year now and it is still my boyfriend's favourite meal!

This was easy and very tasty. I didn't do the step of 30 mins in the frig, didn't have time, but it still came out good. Also, used what veggies I had on hand, bell pepper, onion, zuccini, green onion and served over rice. I gave it 5 stars because it is one I will make again and again... Quick, tasty and made with stuff you usually have on hand.

Fantastic! Probably the first chinese dish that turned out so good. Very simple and everyone in the family (plus couple guests) liked it. I used sliced ginger (rather than dry) just because it's what I had on hand, doubled the soy sauce and garlic, added a little brown sugar and a bit of crushed red pepper flakes. Really, overall, not major changes. But I do recommend adding the cornstarch to the water near the end rather than to the chicken at the beginning.

AMAZING!!! I love this!! The only difference i did, was took out the celery and stir fried the veggies with some salt and pepper, then added the chicken(already done). I used chicken broth in place of the water for my rice...yummy!!! I'll be making this over and over again. THANKS!!! =)

So simple & delicious.  Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of a couple drops of sriacha in the chicken marinade.  This recipe would be wonderful even with different vegetables or a change to the protein (i.e. steak).  I love a recipe you can play with!

Made this almost exactly as described except substituted cabbage for celery and added a clove of garlic with the veggies.  Also chicken was diced into small bite sizes.  This was really delicious.  I will try it next time with some cashews.  I think that would add a nice crunch.

It was my first time making stir fry, so I was a bit nervous but this is SO yummy!  I added green beans and water chestnuts.  Next time I will do a few things differently: 1. Double the soy sauce mixture and set half aside to add at the very end.  It was definitely lacking some flavor. 2.  Add a bit of cornstarch to the chicken boullion & water. 3.  Cook the broccoli (and green beans) for about two minutes before the rest of the vegetables.  Otherwise, super delicious!

This would have been fine until I added the water and bouillon. This made it soupy and seemed to wash away the coating of the chicken.  I'll still look for a better recipe.

I like the starch-coated chicken, but the sauce that you add to the veggies needs work. I followed another suggestion to add 2 tblsp cornstarch to broth  instead of the water/bouillon combo. It was a good consistency, but tasted like thick broth and wasn't really a good flavor match with the coated chicken.

I really enjoyed this dish, except I wish I would've followed some of the others' advice and added more soy sauce - it could've used a bit more flavor.  Other than that, delicious!

I forgot an ingredient (the chicken bouillon) and this was still excellent! I don't recommend omitting it. My purposeful modifications: I added a Tbsp of brown sugar and a Tbsp of Worcestershire sauce (per the suggestions of other reviewers) used lite soy sauce, jarred ginger and fresh garlic. I blended all of this together with the corn starch and water (reduced to 1/2 cup) to make a sauce. I added this after stir frying the chicken and vegetables. I used the veggies I had on hand: fresh red bell pepper, celery, carrot, onion and frozen broccoli. All in all, an excellent recipe to play with. My son(5) is gobbling it up as I type! Thanks for sharing!

Double sauce, cut chicken tenders into bite size pieces and cook that way, use frozen stir-fry veggies.  Mmm good.

the cornstarch is key in this recipe! it just browns up those chicken pieces very nicely. i cut prep time by using frozen chicken breasts and frozen stir fry veggie mix. the sauce does seem a bit meager, so i added an extra 1/4 cup of chicken broth with 1 tsp corn starch. it made the stir fry a bit creamier, but it sure was tasty. i'll definitely be making this again.

As many others have done & noted here, I made mods & this base recipe turned out GREAT; very PeiWei like!   I used grated ginger (keeps in freezer in zipbag). I used pounded the breasts in a zip bag before cutting it into strips, used minced garlic, added lemon pepper seasoning to the chicken, added snow peas & mushrooms to the veggies, sub'd ckn stock for water &  made more sauce by increasing liquids, and sprinkled sesame seeds over the dish just before serving. WONDERFUL!!!

This is a good recipe..It doesn't quite have the same flavor as in the Chinese restaurants but my husband still gave it 7 out of 10 stars..I did double the soy sauce, ginger, and garlic powder amounts..Also added the brown sugar! :)..I would fix this again for my family(and maybe tweak it here and there)..

After 16 years of cooking the same recipes over and over again and feeling like nothing new or interesting has come out of my kitchen I got online and picked this recipe.  It was easy and yummy.  I did double the soy sauce, garlic powder and ginger.  I also added just a little brown sugar.  It was DELICIOUS.  And I may sound a bit over-dramatic, but my faith is restored in my cooking abilities.  Thank you!!!

Five stars!  Husband loved it, too!  I used traditional chinese veggies, broc, bean sprouts, snap peas, carrots; added some mushrooms and onions (would have used chives, if had); Great idea to put the chicken in w/cornstarch, etc.  I dissolved some brown sugar in the soy, first, then added to bag.  In the end, I again mixed the soy, minced ginger and heated in empty pan, then added the broth, then some cornstarch and put everything back in with some water chestnuts to heat up and thicken!  Just like Chinese restaurant as another reviewer stated!  (Used brown rice and topped with crispy chinese noodles.) Yummy!  We were stuffed cuz we had more than one serving!  But it's all good stuff!

I made this almost as written and thought it was very good.  I did add some red bell pepper and garlic.  I should've read the recipe better before I started, because the "Ready in..." time at the top doesn't include the 30 minutes it sits in the fridge, so dinner was a little later than expected.  The cornstarch thing was new for me and I thought it turned out beautifully and tasted great! Served with rice.

Great with Beef too!  I only made substitutes because I had to and I was pleasantly surprised!  I substituted the beef for the chicken and the ginger for the allspice and it was a hit.  I also substituted the chix broth for beef broth for obvious reasons.

I followed the directions without any additions. My family found this dinner bland. It needed something to give it more flavor. I will admit we like our food more spicy than the average family. However, this was not that good.

This is a great "base" recipe. I used wafer thin pork tenderloin strips instead of chicken and a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables plus a can of bean sprouts in place of the fresh veggies. I also used fresh garlic and ginger and substituted a tablespoon of sesame oil for one of the tablespoons of veg. oil. I didn't need more than 1/2 cup of the bouillon. Overall - I will definitely be coming back to these flavors.

Delicious & easy!  I also added a teaspoon or two of honey as suggested by other reviews, and the chicken turned out crisp and yummy.  I just used the veggies we had in the fridge...snap peas, carrots, broccoli, celery, onion, garlic scapes, mushrooms.  This will definitely become a summer staple for us.

Fantastic.  No way do you have to marinate the chicken.  It's tasty as all get-out even just cooking on the (fry?) fly.  Just make sure you cook the chix first with only onions, garlic and ginger and crush those chix down to prove there's no pink inside.

I use organic chix breasts, and bagged the broccoli and used instead 1/2 of a summer squash, 1 ea. red and green peppers, and sprinkled in chopped almonds and sesame seed.  I did not use the water.  Using these measurements:
1 teaspoon Ginger
2 tablespoons Peanut Oil
1/2 teaspoon Sea Salt 
1 cup Chicken Broth 
2 tablespoons Soy Sauce 
2 tablespoons White Sugar 
2 tablespoons Cornstarch
1 tablespoon Almonds, ready chopped
1 teaspoon Sesame seed

the consistency was purrrrrrfect.

A bit 'o stir-fry and a bit 'o simmer, with my big 12" infused Calphalon skillet.  No Wok needed!  I have one of those silly-large all purpose lids, and after the chicken is cooked, I put it aside and do the veggies for 5 mins, stirring freq. w/ the lid, then put back the chix and add the soy mix and cook a little more and WOW !!!  Amazing taste, really authentic.  Try not to sub out the sugar snap peas - they make it very authentic.  I also used about 1/2 of a yellow summer squash, and added chopped almonds at the end.  BOOYAH!!  This one's a keeper.  I buy the steamed rice - no sense in working too hard.

Great as is!  My husband requests it at least once a week!  After the first time I made it, I only added the cornstarch to the chicken breasts.  I added the ginger and soy sauce after placing the cornstarch-coated chicken pieces in the pan - it makes for a much less messy process, and the breading stays on the chicken a little better!

With the good reviews and the simplicity of the dish, I decided to make it for dinner tonight.  Wow, this is possibly my least favorite dish I have made from this site.  It has almost no flavor.  I think the bouillon ruined it as it was all I could taste.  The only substitution I made was using frozen stir fry vegetables.  I can't believe so many people loved this dish.

This gets four stars because I nearly completely diverged from the recipe. Rather than chicken, I used beef. Vegetables I used: broccoli, carrots, green onion, shitake mushrooms, bok choy. In the future I will not coat the meat in the corn starch, but rather add it to the broth... it left clumps of starch in the sauce. Other additions (because the original recipe struck me as too bland) were garlic salt, a little more soy sauce, and fresh minced garlic. (What can I say... I like sodium.)

Served over fried egg noodles and it was scrumptious! This is a great recipe to get inspiration from and use as a template to make your own Asian-inspired meals.

This was a very good guide for chicken stir fry - I used frozen stir fry vegetable mix and omitted the corn starch and water because we don't like it too saucy.

Yum, this was good!  Marinated the meat for longer than the 30 minutes and added extra garlic and soy sauce.  We left out the celery and used mushrooms instead.

I have made this recipe twice already. I followed the recipe the first time  and the second time I made slight change in the recipe. 2 things. Instead of using water, I used a 14oz can chicken broth and instead of using the bouillon, I just added a dash of salt and black pepper to taste because I thought the bouillon was very very salty.  I did use the entire tin because I had 5 pieces of chicken breats and a whole lot of vegetables. It came out so wonderful and it tasted just like the stir fry in the Chinese restaurants. I couldn't believe I made it. This is a MUST HAVE recipe to keep in your box.  I like this recipe so much that I had to email a  copy to the ladies in my office because they're always wondering what to cook when they get home. One of the ladies tried it already and she says it was a hit with her family. Need I say more?

Thanks for this basic stir fry recipe Lori! I thought the first step of coating with corn starch and then adding marinade turned out great. I too used veggies we had on hand: baby corn, carrots, asparagus and then threw in some cashews. My 2 & 4 year old liked it and my husband and I were able to doctor our individuals plates to our preferred spice taste. Try sweet chili sauce on your final product...so good!

Excellent!  Our little boys loved this stir fry as well.  I used 1 1/2lb. of chicken so I doubled the sauce and it made the perfect amount.  I also had green onions, green pepper and water chestnuts on hand so I added them to the mix.  Served over rice.

This was wonderful.  The second time I tried with shrimp and it was scrumptious.  Served on brown rice and it was a lovely meal.

Great recipe!  Best one I've used yet!  I substituted pork instead of chicken because that's what I wanted to do anyway and I used a little extra water, cornstarch and soy sauce to thicken the sauce.  I eliminated ginger since I had none and it didn't make a difference.  I added Bok Choy to the mix because I had it and it was excellent!  I added it last of all since it cooks so quickly and you don't want it to overcook!  It's not very good when it's too wilted.  

I will be using this recipe many times in the future and I will try it with chicken and with steak or maybe even with jumbo shrimp or tofu.  It's so versatile. You can add or eliminate any kind of vegetables according to your personal tastes.  My family of five ate it all and was looking for more so maybe I would add an extra pound of meat or poultry or seafood to it, but I have three teenagers and a husband with a large appetite!

This is really good but I can never get the sauce to turn out just right.  I also have to add liquid to it or add corn starch to thicken it.  But either way, the flavors are always really good and it reheats well.

I made the recipe as written and really enjoyed it. It was equally as good as the stir fry that I have had at restaurants. I will be making this again.

This stir fry recipe was delicious! The flavor was wonderful, I also added a bit more of terriyaki and soy sauce while stir fry was cooking, along with a bit of spicy asian chile paste (my husband and I love a bit of a kick). I also seasoned chicken a bit more before the cornstarch. Others had mentioned adding a bit more cornstarch... I agree if you like a thicker sauce. Sauce was more soupy, I personally like a thicker sauce, but my husband does not! So overall it was a big hit and will make again. Great, fast meal when you want to make omething delicious and not spend a ton of time over the stove or around the oven (we live in AZ and yikes! it is close to July and temp is 112!). Thx for the recipe! :)

Yum!  Used this recipe for a purely veggie stirfry with broccoli, carrots and sugar snap peas (all from the CSA) and served it over udon noodles.  Yeah, baby!
Update 7/13 - added cabbage, zucchini (julienned along with carrots), and thickly sliced onions. Doubled the sauce, added some spicy Thai sauce and hoisin. Incredible!

Delicious and easy! This recipe makes the chicken so tender, with just enough garlic and ginger. And I love that I can use ground ginger instead of fresh.

This was DELICIOUS! I only had beef broth on hand, so I used it instead of the chicken bullion. Next time I will be adding toasted almonds slivers, water chestnuts and bamboo shoots. The whole family LOVED this! I also added crushed red pepper flakes to give it a little heat. Awesome recipe!!

I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS 4 TO 4.5 STARS FOR SMALL VARIETY OF VEGETABLES IN RECIPE. HOWEVER, I'M GIVING THIS 5 STARS FOR THE CHICKEN PREP METHOD (AND ADDITIONAL VEGGIES).  THE CORNSTARCH HELPED THE SAUCE TO ADHERE TO THE CHICKEN VERY, VERY WELL. I ADDED SOME HOISON TO THE MARINADE AND ALSO RED PEPPER FLAKES  FOR SOME KICK  I LIKE A VARIETY OF VEGGIES IN A STIR-FRY. I WILL GENERALLY ADD A BIT OF WHATEVER I HAVE ON HAND IN THE FRIDGE.  IN ADDITION TO THE VEGGIES LISTED IN THE RECIPE, I ALSO ADDED RED PEPPER, GREEN ONION TOPS, WATER CHESTNUTS, BOK CHOY, ASPARAGUS, AND MUSHROOMS. I HAD BBQ PORK IN THE FRIDGE SO I MIXED WITH SOME HOISON SAUCE. FRESH GARLIC AND GINGER ARE PREFERRED OVER DRIED SEASONINGS AS WELL. THE LAYERS OF FLAVORS WERE AMAZING!! NO MATTER HOW YOU PREPARE YOUR  STIR-FRY BE SURE TO FOLLOW STEP 1 OF THE DIRECTIONS.  THANK YOU LORI FOR THE  BRILLIANT CORNSTARCH TIP!

This is a good start. The meat was great - very moist, great texture. The taste is a bit bland, and the sauce never really sauced up for me...it was just wet. My kids all liked it, from the 1 year old to the 9. I'll definitely make it again but up the seasonings a "little" (so as not to offend the kids), and maybe try doing some of the cornstarch at the end with the broth. Much better than frozen mushy vegetables.

Great recipe! The other reviews are great! Definitely add more soy sauce and garlic. Plus the suggestion for about a tsp of brown sugar is great! The flavor boils out if you don't add about double of those ingredients!

Followed advice of others and doubled the soy sauce, ginger, and garlic and added closer to end of cooking. I also mixed cornstarch with broth (instead of water) first, and added toward end.  Added a bit of brown sugar.  If I don't have time to marinate, I just cook the chicken in 2 tablespoons soy sauce with garlic and ginger.  I also find that I need less chicken than stated, but that's just personal preference on the ratio of veggies to meat.

This was a great stir fry recipe. I followed the directions, but did add some Schezuan sauce with the water and chicken bouillon to add a little kick. It was perfect. I used to buy frozen veggies and just use regular stir fry sauce. Not anymore. This is my new stir fry recipe!

I agree with others that this is an excellent starter recipe!  The changes I made were using 4 pressed fresh garlic cloves, instead of powder, that I stir-fried 1st until aromatic.  Then I put in about 1 cup chopped onion and 1-1/2 cup red sweet pepper (omitted celery as I too haven't found much that I like cooked celery in).  I used 3 Tbs of soy sauce & used chicken broth instead of water & bouillon.  I also put in about 1-1/2 cups asparagus, cut into pieces on the bias, as I had some that needed to be used up.  Came out amazing!  Tasted so good that my DH said I should be called PF Cat, as we like PF Changs but not the price.  This came out WAY better than that!  Thanks for sharing!

I substituted hoisin sauce instead of soy sauce and used granulated garlic instead of garlic powder. I also added cauliflower florets, mushrooms and some peppers to the veggie mix. I used only 1/2 cup of water so as to not dilute the taste of the sauce and it was an absolute hit with everyone in the family!!! This is definitely going into the family recipe book.

This is amazing! My husband said it tastes exactly like a restaurants. I did skip cutting up all of the broccoli, carrots and celery, used a frozen stir-fry which included all of those plus water chestnuts and noodles and added my own onions. Plus, I put in 3 teaspoons of chicken bouillon. Can't wait to make it again!

I followed the recipe pretty close (did not wait a full 30 minutes to marinate chicken) and really felt it lacked in flavor and shouted for contrast.  If you like "plain" seasoning or have never had stir-fry before this might be the recipe for you.  It is a good basic foundation to stir-fry which is hard to mess up.  This recipe is DEFINITELY lacking brown sugar.  I also thought it was silly to coat the chicken with the cornstarch.  By doing this, when I cooked the chicken/sauce mixture it left gooey globs of sauce mix that stuck to the pan.  As many others mentioned, the cornstarch should really be added to the water/broth mixture to help the sauce thicken and avoid this problem.

If I were to do it over I would add Brown Sugar, Cheyenne Pepper, Red Pepper flakes and possibly pineapple for some contrast.  Anyone else who thought it was lacking flavor and is a bit more daring, I would suggest you look up Joel's Jerk Chicken for a more bold recipe.

Really good as is, but also as base for adding more spice for personal tastes. We thought it needed more of the ginger and garlic and soy. But the chicken is wonderfully tender. The dish is colorful with the crispy veggies.  Next time I may add cashews. Thanks!

This was acceptable. I just made it and it was definitely on the bland side. The only two changes were that I used fresh garlic and sesame oil. 

It is a very good base stir fry, great for beginners but needs more flavor.

Excellent recipe! The only changes I made were adding 1/2 tsp garlic powder since we love garlic here... then I added about a tsp of sesame oil since we all love that flavor too. The whole family heartily agrees that this one is a keeper...  my 19 yo son said "Mom, you GOTTA make this again!" Thanks for sharing it. :)

Great recipe! I did a few modifications . . has beef stew meat used instead of chicken, added red wine when the beef boulion was added and just added ginger / garlic spices. I added a frozen bag pf frozem veg on hand with the recipe vegt. I microwaved them together so they were ready for further stir fry.  Add what you have on hand!

This stir-fry is very good as written.  I used fresh grated ginger which I think has better flavor than  dried ginger, and used my homemade chicken broth.  For us, it needed a little more jazz so the next time I will add some additional soy sauce and garlic but it was still very good.

My stir fry has been much better since I have been coating my chicken in the corn starch as the recipe instructs. I didn't measure anything, but pretty much followed the recipe, substituting mushrooms and chinese cabbage for the celery and carrots. This is the only stir fry I use now.

I usually make recipes as written the first time around.  I did with this, with the exception of veggies.  All I had was the frozen stir-fry veggies on hand.  Great flavor and super easy.  But I was hoping for a little of sauce in the end,.

Healthy, but tasteless.  We ended up pouring low sodium soy sauce over it to  have some taste.  The cornstarch made the chicken stick to the pan (despite the oil) and I knew I had a disaster on my hands.  It turned out okay, but it's almost like it needed a thicker tastier sauce.

My husband is not a huge stir fry fan.  I made this and he actually like it better than others that I cooked.  There was something really authentic in this recipe.  Loved it!  I love ginger and did add a little brown sugar to the Soy Sauce as someone else had mentioned.  Making this again this week!

This was great!  I read one review that said it wasn't thick enough, I added twice the amount of cornstarch.  The result was a pan that stuck, BAD!  Had to uncrust it the best I could before continuing on with the veggies.  By far, the best home made stir fry recipe I've ever tried.  I did however put a few tablespoons of kung pqo stir fry sauce in it just in case it wasn't thick enough.  Wish I wouldn't have read that review, it may have been better.  I was lazy and used frozen stir fry veggies, and I'll make it again!  Thumbs up and thanks!

This was wonderful!!! The only things I added was a few dried chilies while cooking the chicken, to spice it up and some oyster sauce to make a thicker, sticky sauce. Also I love using fresh before dried ingredients. I used fresh garlic and ginger. I know that even if I didn't add these extras it would have still been great!! Thank you!! (PS I am glad to see that you used cornstarch!!! THANK YOU AGAIN!!!)

I thought the chicken came out ok, but overall I found this to be a bit bland. I think next time I will add fresh garlic in with the veggies and some more spices.

I love it. I cooked it for my family and boyfriend! they loved it. 
I did not used cornstarch or either ginger but it didn't make a difference. it was awesome. 
as well to season the chicken i liquify it and make sofito which is green and red peppers, onion and garlic.  
it was really good.

I have made these several times now and also given the recipe to several people. This is the only stir fry I cook now. Sometimes if I don't have everything I just omit that or replace with something I do have. But that's why this recipe is so great it always turns out awesome! Thanks

Quick, easy, delicious and approved by my  picky husband!  Perfect "it's late and I don't really feel like cooking" dinner and it was so tasty.  This will definitely be my new "go to" recipe!  I doubled the soy & spices and used 3/4 cups of water & bouillion instead of whole cup.

I followed the recipe as provided.  Overall, an excellent meal, but the flavor of the ginger was a little on the low side.  I am thinking the quality of ginger you purchase might have an effect, or I might need to up the quantity of ginger the next time.  All of the kids ate it up, though.

Tasty meal to make in minutes with relatively inexpensive ingredients most have on hand anyway. I used a bell pepper in lieu of broccoli and it was great. Whole family---including two picky eaters enjoyed the meal very much. I did add a pinch more of the seasonings than it called for and a few dashes of Emeril's Asian Spice as an experiment and all enjoyed.

This was very good!  I think I'd add a little more ginger and garlic to the marinade though.  I like this recipe because there's room for experimenting - for instance, you can play with the vegetables - I used snap peas and carrots.  I added soy sauce, ginger and garlic to the vegetables before adding in the cooked chicken at the end.  Chicken was juicy and stir-fry as a whole was pretty flavorful!

Prep was fast and easy.  However, my chicken pieces were cut 1 1/2 inches instead of the recommended 1/2 inch. This was a problem, the chicken pieces were difficult to separate (because they were sticking) in the wok. Cooking sequence was adhered to and dish resulted as advertised.  My only addition was 1/4 tsp chili powder.  It just added mild zing to the dish. I would repeat this recipe with perhaps more carrots and broccoli.

I haven't made a stir fry in at least a year, I just haven't been able to find a great recipe that I would love AND the kiddos would love. THIS IS THE RECIPE FOR OUR FAMILY! My kids raved about this stir fry tonight. I was so impressed as well. The chicken was tender and had so much flavor. I used worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce (I was workin' with what I had), and used frozen broccoli and fresh baby carrots. I will make this again...and again...so yummy!

Very good recipe and very easy to modify, which I did by using frozen brocoli stir fry and adding a bit more of the seasonings.  One thing that I will definately change is that instead of mixing the cornstarch with the chicken, I will added almost at the end, being that I felt that it made the chicken to "gluey" and it was to easy t stick to my wock.  Other than that, super delicious and I got a hug from my daughter's boyfriend and a kiss from my son!!  Great reviews!!!!

I made this for my whole family, all seven of them (each with different food preferences) and it was a big hit! Great recipe to make for a big family without too much clean up and preparation. Instead of celery though I put in snow peas which everyone loved.  I also had to add a little extra corn starch to thicken it up a bit at the end, and I added a little extra soy sauce to flavor it up a bit more. Great, easy recipe as is, and you can always add more and customize it to your own specific tastes.

Excellent stiry-fry! Very versatile and delicious. Used purple cabbage instead of celery. It needed 1Tble cornstarch toward the end to thicken up. Will make again when I have veggies that need to be eaten. :)

I was really disappointed with this after reading all the glowing reviews... but I will try to make this again some time, though.  I followed the instructions completely...the only thing which might have made a difference was I used a bag of frozen asian stirfry veggies... partially defrosted in the microwave + the onion. I just don't know... the flavor was kind of bland tasting-- definitely not like going to a chinese restaurant...the chicken cooked up okay.... SMELLED awesome....  but I can't put my finger on what could have gone wrong.  Maybe fresh veggies could have helped?  I'll try those next time!  Sorry!  I really wanted to like it!! :(

Stumbled upon this and happened to have everything I needed to make this one night.  Had not tried to coat chicken like this before, but it really turned out well!  I used a lot more broccoli than 2 cups, and a little more chicken, too.  Was really easy to make and tasted great.  Took longer than 30 minutes, but it always takes me a lot longer than what it says (I guess I chop slow!)  Anyway served it up over rice and the family loved it.

Very easy, very good.  I tinkered around with the vegetables a little, used green and red bell peppers, sugar snap peas, red onion and bean sprouts.  But it turned out great.  I was thrilled when my husband went back for seconds!

This was excellent! But I did make some changes, I didn't even take a chance of adding the corn starch to the chicken when marinating, big no no, it will get lumpy, I doubled the sauce for the chicken omitting the corn starch.  Added the corn starch to the cold water before adding at the end to ensure it dissolves.  I also added some mushrooms to the veggies, and some brown sugar to the soya sauce marinade at the beginning.  I served with brown rice and sprinkled with chopped peanuts (you can also use cashews).  It was SO delicious, would make again for sure.  I don't like celery but in this recipe it was perfect and added a really good crunch.

The flavors in this were so yummy, but I think next time I'm going to use a different technique. It says to coat the chicken pieces in cornstarch...yeah, not so much. I found that the marinade was way too thick after coming out of the fridge, and the cornstarch ended up thickening into little globs while I cooked the chicken. It broke up somewhat after I added the chicken broth, but it wasn't very visually appealing. I only used carrots and broccoli as the veggies, but it was very good that way.  I also tasted the sauce before serving and decided to add more of everything-ginger, garlic, and soy sauce. It was a bit salty, so next time i'm going to used reduced sodium soy sauce, and reduced sodium broth. I served it with brown rice spiced with ginger, and it was a hit with everyone...from my husband down to my 1-year old.

This was good, quick, and easy.  I took other suggestions and add a splash of Worsteshire.  I also put in a dash of red pepper.  From start to finish I had this on the table in just under an hour.

I added mushrooms. red pepper flakes and a touch of sherry and would have added cabbage if I had some on hand.  I also used chicken thighs instead of breasts so it contained a little more fat than it would have but my family prefers them.  It was flavorful and delicious.  I will make this again.  Thanks!!  It paired perfectly with a good Sauvignon Blanc from the Marlborough region of New Zealand.   In the nutritional content, there was no fiber.  That cannot be correct because broccoli, onions, celery and carrots all contain fiber that doesn't go away when cooked.

This was delicious - my husband went up for seconds. I didn't have ground ginger on hand so I left it out. I added some garlic to the chicken, and after adding the water/chicken bouillon, I added a little more cornstarch to thicken it. I would add more broccoli next time. The cooking time should be increased because it took more more like 45 minutes. Yum!

Delicious! I used breast tenders instead of chicken breast halves.  Also, used chicken stock as someone here suggested instead of water and the bouillon.  Only added half a cup of chicken stock and added a bit more cornstarch to that. It came out amazing!

well....the chicken isn''t even done yet and it has been well over 5 minutes....the nice coating is also stuck to the bottom of the pan and the chicken is falling apart....I only did 3 breast halves cut into pieces...there is no room for it to cook...I hope that it tastes great because it looks terrible! :-( Usually I have no problem with stir fry recipes....

This is a wonderful recipe and no need to doctor it however I did add about 1/4 cup of peanut butter to the mix and some crushed red pepper to give it a lil zip and it was great! Thank you for a good base recipe.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but it really didn't taste Chinese at all.  The corn starch mixture burned in the bottom of my wok almost immediately and the sauce was pretty bland.  This would really need to be tweaked to be good.  Sorry!

Tried it last night, and it was good, but ended up needing to add a little splenda brown sugar to bring out the flavor a bit more.  To tweak to my tastes, next time I'll add more garlic & ginger and maybe a little sra-cha hot sauce and it'll be 5-stars.

Very tasty, simple and healthy!  We like lots of veggies, so I added mushrooms and snow peas along with bamboo shoots and water chestnuts.  I also doubled the sauce and added about 1 TBSP of brown sugar (per other reviewers' suggestions). The 1 cup of chicken broth may have been too much - I had to add a corn starch slurry to get it to thicken, so maybe next time I'll cut back on the liquid.  Overall, great easy recipes - thanks!

This was a quick easy recipe that will be a regular around here. Several times through the meal my husband commented on how good it was, and that's a rare thing for him! I pretty well followed the recipe, but substituted snow peas for the broccoli and I added sliced water chestnuts and a handful of almonds. I did need to thicken it a bit at the end, but that was a minor item. Thank you Lori for sharing this great recipe.

Very, very good! I did have to triple the spices and double the soy sauce for our tastes (even though I halved the amount of chicken), but this is a great recipe. I didn't have cornstarch, so I used 5 tablespoons of flour and it worked perfectly. The sauce thickened beautifully at the end. Other modifications were minor... added mushrooms and bamboo shoots, used chicken broth instead of water. Definitely will make again with these minor changes to suit our tastes. Bottom line, a very good recipe. Thank you! :)

The chicken in this recipe rocks!  I love it!  I only let it sit in the bag about 20 minutes and it tasted fine.  The ratios of ginger and garlic is perfect, but I did double the amounts (from another reviewer's suggestion) and I'm glad I did.  I also added brown sugar to the soy sauce as the same reviewer said and it really made a big difference.  My new favorite stir fry recipe--thanks Lori (and camgo)!

I know I'm in the minority but this was just blah. I even doubled the soy sauce, ginger & garlic & it was not very flavorful. It definitely needs a major kick of something. The cornstarch made the chicken stick to my wok pan. It was pretty on the plates though & everyone ate it.

Made this the other night for my husband and he loved it. I marinated the chicken in soy sauce with some worcestshire sauce with a combination of our favorite spices. After I sauteed the chicken, I took it out and did sweet bell peppers, green pepper, and onion. I then added the chicken, water, cornstarch and more spice. I definitely recommend adding more cornstarch to thicken the sauce and also the extra spice at the end as the recipe's marinade didn't seem to strong.

I thought this would be better than it was.  I added ground red pepper to spice it up and brown sugar to get sweetness.  It tasted like it came from a sub-par chinese take out.  No disrespect, but if your the Dakotas or middle caucasion America this is probobly great, but if your on the west coast with a lot of Asain culture around, don't waste your time with this recipe.

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  I took the advice of others and added the cornstarch to the water and added it at the end.  I didnt have bouillon granules so I used half a bouillon cube that I added  w/ the broccoli, carrots, and onions.  I had a bag of mixed frozen california baby vegetables that I used and left out the celery.  I also took the advice of others and doubled the soy sauce mixture and added brown sugar to it.  I found the sauce to be too thick so I added an extra cup of water and that made it perfect.  You also don't need to use oil because you can spray the pan before you stir fry the food.  The family loved it and we're having it for dinner again tonight :-).

This was so good and so easy. I left out the onion because I had none at home and added a teaspoon of garlic chili sauce for an extra kick. (We like it HOT.) So easy for a quick week day meal! 5 stars for ease of preparation and good taste! Thanks for a great recipe.

A great recipe.  After reading reviews, I doubled soy, ginger, and garlic and added a dash of salt.  I also used the veggies I had on hand (snow peas, broccoli, bell pepper, red onion, baby bella mushrooms, and water chestnuts) and served it over wild and long grain rice.  My husband and I both loved it.  Thanks for this recipe.  I'll definitely be fixing it again soon.

Oh my goodness!! Thank you so much for this recipe.  It was fantastic.  Had a nice mild sauce that my kids gobbled up (even the picky one!!) I used orange and yellow peppers instead of the celery and carrots.  I think my 12 yr. old son ate at least 1 weeks worth of veggies for dinner tonight!  I did have to add more cornstarch at the end.  I just shook some cornstarch and cold water in a little tupperware and stirred it in.  Also I doubled the sauce amount in the ziploc bag and used fresh minced garlic.  Next time I might try it with the brown sugar (as others suggested) just to see how it is, but it was FABULOUS without it.  Definitely a keeper.

This is pretty good.  I didn't have carrots or broccoli so I used bamboo shoots and spinach.  My bf enjoyed this, even with the changes.  I'm sure it would be even better with broccoli since that's my favorite veggie.

Very delicious! I used a frozen stir fry veggie mix instead of dicing my own veggies- worked out great. Chicken came out perfect, added about 1 tbsp splenda brown sugar and about 1tbsp extra soy sauce, 1 tsp extra ginger and about 1 tbsp extra fresh chopped garlic. I LOVED THIS and will be making this again over and over!

This was pretty tasty, but I did make some adjustments.  We don't eat celery, so I substituted sugar snap peas.  I also added some cashews, and more soy sauce.  Overall, a good stir-fry recipe!

thought this was very good (my first attempt at a stir-fry) I pretty much followed the recipe except for the veggies...I used what I had on hand-mushrooms, green pepper, sugar-snap peas,onion,carrots & scapes.  Served over brown rice.  Delicious! Will make again!

OMG!!! Okay, I have been using allrecipes for years and this is the best recipe I have ever tried. This is also my first time writing a review. I followed the recipe almost exact except I used 2 cloves of fresh garlic and fresh ginger. I added an extra tbsp of cornstarch and 2 extra tbsp of reduced sodium soy sauce. I cooked the veggies a little longer too. Viola!! Awesome.

This was really, really delicious! Even my 3 year old enjoyed it, and that's saying A LOT!  The only thing was the chicken was a *little* bland, I may have to fix that the next time I make this.   Yummy!

Loved this recipe!  I did not use ginger, and I added fresh garlic.  I used broccoli and bean sprouts the the first time I made it.  I added additional soy sauce to the vegetables while they cooked.  For Mother's Day I made this recipe for ten people.  We threw in every vegetable we could find in the kitchen.  Everyone from ages 4 - 65 liked it.

Very flexible recipe. I substituted the marinade seasonings with a jar of pre-made teriyaki marinade. Cooked the chicken breasts whole in some olive oil (did not measure) and continued to baste with extra marinade. The only veggies I had on hand were carrots, so I used two cups thinly sliced carrots. Sauteed the carrots in more oil after removing the chicken. Sliced up the chicken and returned to the pan with the carrots. Continued with water and boullion step, plus added 3 tbls of cornstarch at the end to thicken (instead of coating the chicken with the cornstarch at the beginning). Even with all the changes, it was excellent.

This is a good basic stir-fry recipe.  It's a little too bland for me, so I add a couple tablespoons of brown sugar to the marinade, and then two tablespoons of soy sauce (mixed with corn starch, so the sauce doesn't end up too thin) and some extra garlic and ginger to the sauce at the end.

As some other readers wrote, the stir fry flavor dissapates as the chicken cooks. Next time, I will mix cornstarch in chicken broth before putting it in the pan, and also will add some stir fry flavor mixture while cooking meat.

Wow!  Really good... My family said it is the best stir fry they ever had.  I marinated for 2 hours with double the garlic and ginger.  When the veggies were half cooked, I added 1 c. water, 2 more Tbsp. cornstarch, 1 bouillon cube, and another 2 Tbsp. soy sauce.  Most of the original cornstarch and soy sauce was stuck in the marinade bag.  Really easy and delicious dinner.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was great but changed a few things and did what others had suggested about doubling the sauce.  Also added 1/2 the amount of carrots, celery and onion since we added 1 1/2 cup of cabbage and 1/4 of a red bell pepper, 1/4 green pepper and 1/4 of a yellow pepper. Also added more ginger, garlic and soy sauce while cooking the vegetables.

This was a great weeknight meal. It's ***** with the following tweaks: 1. After cutting up the chicken, don't waste a ziploc bag, just leave it on the cutting board while you prepare the other ingredients. 2. Save another step and use chicken broth instead of water & bouillon. In a small bowl, mix the broth, soy sauce & cornstarch together & set aside. 3. Mince a clove or two of garlic, grate a teaspoon of fresh ginger root & set aside with the other prepared veggies. 4. Refer to step 5 of the original recipe and proceed as directed. This recipe is a bit bland as written but can easily be revved up with more soy sauce, garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, etc.. The next time I make this I might also add a dash of Kitchen Bouquet browning sauce.

My family kept saying, "this is really good" like they were amazed I actually cooked something so tasty. The only change I made was chicken broth instead of the water and added a tsp of corn starch in it. I just didn't trust the sauce to thicken as is. Had no broccoli but added red pepper which worked well.

This is a solid recipe. I used frozen veggies, thawed and drained. It was good, but I found it a bit bland. I'll likely make it again with more spices.

Have made this recipe two ways, the only difference is vegetables.  As is, it's awesome, but our 4 & 5 year olds are not too keen on the vegetables.  The other way, we make the recipe exactly to proportion, just using water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, and snow peas.  Kids asked for seconds, and to make the dish more often!

Tasty and easy.  But a big "generic" tasting.  Very bland.  It's a good base though.  I think next time I may play with it a bit to liven things up.

Family loved this!  I used a frozen vegetable mix that included broccoli, sugar snap peas, baby corn, water chestnuts and carrots.  Microwaved them on the shorter side of recommended time and they turned out perfect!  Thank you for a delicious easy meal!

I made this for dinner for the first time tonight.  My husband (who is hesitant to try anything new) came back for seconds!  He also wants to have it again soon.  The only thing I did differently was add a splash of teriyaki sauce and it complimented the dish wonderfully.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I was looking for a basic stir-fry recipe and this was really pretty good. My mix of veggies was different-just bell peppers, asaragus and carrots. I found that the full cup of water at the end was too much and it was not getting thick quickly enough. I poured the hot  liquid into a measuring cup and then added more cornstarch. I poured it down the side of the pan so it got hot right away with and it was quickly the consistancy that I wanted. Very nice reciped. Don't be afraid to add your own sauces/spices like teriyaki, more ginger, or hoisin sauce. You really can't go wrong starting with this and adding your favorite flavors. 

Thanks for the recipe!

This stir fry is really great! I added brown sugar to the soy sauce and ended up using more baking powder to thicken the sauce. I also added ground red pepper while I was cooking it, and lots of crushed red pepper to the finished dish because I like my food very spicy. I used broccoli, onion, green pepper, and mushrooms as my vegetables, and chicken broth instead of bouillon and water. Thanks for this great recipe!

Ok, so I made this recipe and I have to say it is a very bad idea to mix the cornstarch with the chicken because it will stick to your skillet or wok.. I used my brand new wok and it is ruined now :( I suggest adding the cornstarch with the water.. anyway this was very tasty but I added 1 tablespoon of sugar to the soysauce thanks to a reviewer, used like 6 tablespoons of soy and added cauliflour

My first attempt at stir-fry and this was great! The chicken was excellent - had to substitute flour instead of corn starch b/c I'm overseas and don't have a clue where to find corn starch. Added lots of typical Asian veggies and some sesame oil. Next time will double boulion and water and add more soy sauce just before taking off heat. over rice.

I've made this a couple of times. I really like the method of coating the chicken in the cornstarch & then adding the liquid. The chicken is very flavorful.  The rest of it isn't as flavorful, I guess I like a little stronger flavor.  So I just add a little teriyaki sauce or more soy sauce once I've combined everything. It does have a nice flavor without additional sauce, it's just not very strong.  I will keep using this recipe, this is one of the best stir-fry recipes I've made. Thanks for sharing!

This was a great dish! I made it twice and tweaked the recipe around a bit to give it more flavor. I seasoned the chicken and let it marinate in the starch, ginger and soy sauce overnight. I added green onions, bell peppers, carrots and hot peppers to the recipe. I also doubled the amount of oil and soysauce the recipe required because it added a bit more "juice" to it. The end result is that if you want to serve it over rice you may want to double the chicken broth or bouillon. All in all its a great dish and now my husband's favorite.

Delicious! Easy to make with veggies on hand. I cut the oil and used spray Pam which worked great. I also used a cup of chicken broth instead of the bouillon. My friends all loved the chicken!

Instead of coating the chicken in cornstarch and soy sauce I mixed all that in with the broth.  I chose to use Chinese 5 Spice since I had it and don't have anything to use it for besides dishes like these, it does contain ginger and garlic powder. If serving over rice double the sauce.

Didn't think I could make something like this, but it came out pretty good.  I did use chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon, as some others did.

Absolutely Wonderful! i was skeptical to use Chicken Bullion, but it came out great.  I've tried making frozen vegetables stir fry, it doesn't taste the same.  I am also adding Mushrooms to this dish, which i think will be fabulous.  Thank YOu!

Excellent recipe!  Coating the chicken with cornstarch & spices before sauteing makes it very tender and flavorful. The meat even stayed tender reheated in the microwave.  This is a great method that I will use for other stir-fry recipes.  As other reviewers noted, the finished dish needed more flavor so I added more soy, ginger & garlic as recommended.  Also, we like a lot of sauce so I doubled the the water & bouillon and added a bit more cornstarch.  This is a keeper!

Good.  Did not have time to marinade.  Added hot seasoning to coating bag, added soysauce and ginger to pan. Used broccoli, carrots, onion, sesame oil.

This was simply delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and would do it the same next time.  The flavor is mild, but very much to our liking as we all had seconds. I'll definately be making this dish again!

This recipe is very tasty.  I always used the stir fry packets in the past.  I had no idea it was this simple.  I used onions, peppers, and broccoli since that is what I had on hand.  I did not have any chicken boullion, so I added extra soy sauce and 1/2 cup of water.  It came out fantastic.  Will def try again.

TASTY! I really like this recipe. I followed all the ingredients, but added 1 cup cabbage instead of celery. As a result, I only used about 1/2 cup water and a 1/4 of the bouillon. I also added 1 clove of fresh garlic along with the powder in the marinade. When I was done cooking the veggies and chicken, I poured a tbsp of extra soy sauce. I also added about 1 tsp of brown sugar for texture and taste. Overall I think it came out beautifully. Very easy to make since I am a novice at cooking.

Simply AMAZING!!!!!!  This dish was the best I have had in a long time and everyone loved it.  I changed the vegetables and used 1/2 medium zuchini, 1/2 green pepper, 1/2 yellow pepper, 1/2 orange pepper, 1 can baby corn, 1 can sliced water chestnuts, 2 cups of broccoli, and 1 cup shredded carrots.  This was simply to die for.  I think I will also try this recipe with beef next time to change it a little bit.

I've made many stir-frys but not one with a sauce before. This was very tasty and relatively easy. You could use any combination of vegetables, including frozen. I added a red pepper I had lying around and a couple cloves of garlic. To the marinade, I added some toasted sesame oil and used Tamari instead of regular soy sauce. My only complaint, which keeps it from getting five stars, is that the sauce took quite a while to thicken up and the cornstarch coating left big lumps of crispy marinate in the wok. I think I would recommend adding the cornstarch to the boullion mixture as one would with a gravy and add it at the end.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I added a can of sliced water chestnuts and bamboo shoots and would recommend it.  I used chicken thighs because I had them on hand, increased the garlic powder by 1/4 teaspoon, and stirfried the chicken with a clove of minced garlic.  I really love the flavor the marinade gives to the chicken.  My only complaint is that I wish this stir fry had more of a "sauce"; the water and boullion wasn't much of one.  I might try to concoct my own next time, but otherwise this recipe is delicious!

I loved this.  I used frozen stir fry veggies and added cashews and water chestnuts.  I served over brown rice.  I did not "toss to coat" the chicken, but instead, I added cornstarch, soy sauce, ginger, and garlic powder to chicken broth and simmered for a few minutes. Then I poured the sauce over the sauteed chicken and veggies. It turned out great and was much simpler and less mess.

This recipe is pretty good but a lot easier and tastier with the following changes:  
1) Omit cornstarch in marinade.
2) Omit chicken boulion and water
   Substitute 1 cup chicken stock
3) Mix chicken stock with 2 Tbsp   
   soy sauce, 2 Tbsp cornstarch, and
   an additional 1/4 tsp ginger

Just be sure to not overcook the veggies before adding the chicken stock!  I'd say add it when they are more on the crisp side than you'd think, because it takes some time for the sauce to thicken.

This looked very tasty, but was a little disappointing.  It needed something to "kick it up a notch".  I must say that the chicken was very tender and cooked to perfection.  I think it could have used a bit more ginger and garlic.  I will make it again and add a little something, perhaps rice wine vinegar and/or a bit of sesame oil to enhance the flavor.  I did use low sodium soy sauce and substituted a frozen package of stir fry veggies (broccoli, red pepper, carrots, italian green beans, and water chestnuts) for the fresh broccoli, celery and carrots.

Easy and fun to make.  My chicken did not crisp, perhaps because I added extra tbsp soy sauce, dash sesame oil, red pepper flakes to the bag.  I used 1 bag froz stir-fry vegs and added an onion cut into thin wedges.  I used powdered ginger and garlic then realized I had both fresh so I added the garlic to the bag and extra ginger at end of cooking.  Could use more sauce to flavor rice but nothing a few dashes of soy couldn't remedy.

I liked the method of cooking the chicken (with the cornstarch and spices), but overall this dish needs a little more oomph. I added about 4 Tbsp. of hoisin sauce and a tablespoon of minced garlic, but it still needed some more flavor. Luckily, my hubby eats everything doused in cayenne pepper, so he didn't really notice. Next time I'll dramatically increase the spices. Also, in my grocery store they only sell chicken breast in 3-packs, and each is about 8 oz. So, I used one package and had a lot more chicken than necessary, but this will be a great dish for leftovers. I served with brown rice and I used a bag of pre-cut stir-fry veggies (broccoli, pea pods, and a variety of other julienned veggies) to save some time.

This is a good recipe, however, based upon the previous comments and my experience in making Chinese food for my family, I made a few tweaks to get more flavor out of it. First I doubled the ginger to 1 tsp and added a little brown sugar to the soy-ginger coating for the chicken. Then I added shredded cabbage, a few more dashes of soy sauce to the stir fry then another teaspoon of ginger after the broth. Finally, I wanted the broth to be thicker, so I combined about a cup of water with cornstarch and stirred it into the pan. This made the broth a little thicker with out it becoming pasty. The dish was then served over rice. We generally eat Chinese food with duck sauce, so that was added per taste at the table. A bit different from the recipe here, but overall on our family's 10-point scale, we rated this a 7.5.

This is a great basic stir-fry. It is one of my go to recipes.  I do use fresh garlic and ginger as it is readily available where   I live.  The family loves this one and there are rarely left-overs. Thanks Lori!

Maybe I just have high expectations when it comes to home-made stir-fry, but this just didn't make the grade.  It was so bland, even with additional garlic and ginger. There just isn't much taste at all.

This may be slightly bland, but a great starter recipe to begin to add your own touch. I used 4 half breasts, and I think I had too much meat. Wondered about substituting shrimp. Nice simple dish.

Easy to make and very good flavor. I just about doubled the amount of garlic and ginger as well as the marinating time, but other than that the recipe is perfect. My picky husband even loved it.

This was a pretty tasty recipe.  I added 1/2 tsp garlic instead of 1/4 tsp. I will probably make it again.

I thought the chicken part of this recipe was delicious.  I added frozen stir fry veggies with noodles to the chicken and it was super quick and yummy.  Thanks!

This was an awesome recipe!  Easy to make, great tasting, used ingredients that I had on hand and most of all - the hubby liked it.  But the biggest surprise - Lori's from my home town!!  And believe me - there's not many people from our home town in North Dakota.  And when I say the hubby liked it - that says a lot.  Really - he's the pickiest person on earth!  I'm not kidding.  Thanks, Lori.  Great recipe.

Pretty good. I substitute 1 cup of chicken broth for the bouillon and water and I always forget that the chicken is supposed to go  in the fridge for some time before cooking but even without that refrigerator time, this is a really nice stir fry that can be adjusted for what you have in the crisper.  I make this one regularly served over steamed rice or steamed fried noodles.

I make this recipe ALL the time. I love that it doesn't have the brown sugar in it because it provides us  with a healthy alternative when we want Asian food. I do triple the recipe (soy sauce, garlic, ginger and bouillon). My kids LOVE this.

This stir-fry was very good! It just needed a few adjustments. I did 3 tablespoons of cornstarch, doubled the soy sauce, 3/4 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, chopped 2 cloves fresh garlic, and added snow peas and mushrooms to the mix! I also added a few shakes of hot pepper sauce to the chicken marinade, but I think it would have benefited from adding some to the mixture while it's cooking as well. It definitely needed some spice. I will make this again!

Anxious to this recipe and the instructions stating that the prep time was going to 15 minutes it sounded perfect for a weeknight. Thank goodness my son was able to help me chop. I would say the prep time is more like 40 minutes.
The dish was good but needed more flavor. I will make it again but spice it up.

Extremely tasty.  The only issue I had was the "corn starched" chicken pieces.  They thickened way too quickly.  I had to use chicken broth to thin it out.  But it was so good.

Pretty good for a homemade stir-fry! It is pretty salty so I might forgo the bouillon and just add some extra onion and garlic powder or chicken stock.

This is delicious and I added it to my dinner rotation. I think it lacks a little flavor so I added more garlic, soy sauce  and  sometimes I marinate it in a little of Yoshibas Garlic Teriyaki sauce. If I have the time I also let it marinade for a couple hours verses 30 minutes. The last time I made it I added yakisoba noodles instead of serving it over rice. It was so good!

Fantastic flavor!! To feed 4 adults well I doubled this recipe & it was perfect. I'm not a celery fan so I replaced with zucchini.  Also I added a good amount of crushed red pepper flakes for a tasty kick ;) wonderful recipe....will be on my family's weekly menu!

Great recipe with a few tweaks. I put 1/2 of the cornstarch on the chicken and 1/2 in the water mix.  I also added approx 1 tablespoon of fresh ginger and fresh garlic towards the end of cooking the vegetables. Let the water mix on the side of the pan, so the vegetables don't over cook while the sauce boils and thickens. I tilt the pan so the heat is only under the sauce. Of course if you are using a wok, push vegetables up the side of the wok while sauce cooks on the bottom.

As is, the recipe is alright.
With some minor changes, it was awesome. I added fresh garlic and ginger, 1 tablespoon of brown sugar, and I topped it with cilantro, green onions, and peanuts. At that point, it's almost a different recipe, but my husband loved it.

This was so bland! I followed the recipe to a T, and found it very bland. I added more soy and seasonings at the end of cooking, and still wasn't enough. Not sure how it got so many great reviews! 
I think you could skip the cornstarch too. I think I'll keep looking for the perfect stir fry recipe.

Pretty good! It's a great basic recipe that you can change to fit your personal tastes. The chicken turns out very tender and delicious!

Not as flavorful as I'd have liked and I'd probably stick to Take-out unless I can figure out what spices will give it a "heavier" flavor. Still, I thought it good enough to eat.

I use 1 chicken breast diced, 2 tbsp cornstarch (enough to coat the chicken), 2 tbsp soya sauce, 1/2 tsp ginger powder and 1/2 tsp garlic powder. Mix that all up and set aside while I cook the broccoli and mushrooms (both cooked with salt, pepper and garlic). I brown the chicken in enough oil to coat the pan and then add the chicken broth (about 2 cups) and a pinch or two of brown sugar. If the sauce isn't thick enough I use some cornstarch mixed with water, then add in the veggies and serve over rice. Best stir fry we've ever had! We make this dish often.

This was good. I doubled the amount of soy/ginger/garlic, but the flavor was still not as strong as we like. This is a very flexible recipe, though- you could use any vegetables that you have on hand and the flavor was good. My 1.5 year old and 3 year old gobbled it up.

I liked the consistency of the coating of the chicken and the flavor, however the sauce did not thicken at all and also lost some flavor even with added garlic powder and ginger.  Maybe I'll thicken with cornstarch and add worchestershire sauce next time.

I made this last night and my husband and I loved it. I did use ginger and garlic from the jar (mostly because I didn't have ground ginger.  I also put a little sesame oil in the sauce mix and a little crushed red pepper. Hubby said he'd like cashews but it's GREAT without. We did serve over rice and put Chow Mein noodles on top. We finished it for lunch. My kids are getting this recipe in their cook books for Christmas. Thanks.

This was excellent. I did make a few changes, i subbed mushrooms for celery and for the sauce instead of chicken bouillon granules and water, i used one can of chicken broth mixed with 1/4 cup of soy sauce, garlic powder, and 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. I whisked that together before adding it to the stir fry.

This was excellent. I followed the recipe mostly, except I substituted the broccoli and carrots with thawed stir fry veggies. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will salt and pepper the veggies for extra flavor. But even with that, it was still excellent.

Very nice combination of veggies. It was very easy to do the chicken in corn starch and then just add the soy etc to the zip lock bag.  I found that I needed a little more moisture when I stir fried the veggies so I added about 4 tbsp white wine and because I love "Hot" I added 1 tsp chili flakes.  We loved our dinner thanks.

I'm new to stir fry recipes and I thought this was pretty good. It was colorful and healthy. The chicken was delicious. Love the idea to use corn starch. If I changed anything I may exchange the celery for green or red peppers.

This is a healthier way of having chinese food at home! I used nonfat butter to fry the chicken, used less of the chicken bouillon since the soy sauce was already salty, and since my partner doesnt like celery, i added snow peas instead. I also thickened up the sauce with cornstarch before adding the chicken. It was a hit!

My husband and I eat this at least once a month, it is so good. I end up doubling the spices and soy sauce as well as mixing in a bit of cornstarch mixed with water because we like it really saucy and strong. One thing I prefer is using boneless skinless chicken thigh because I find it has more flavor than breast. I also add in about 2 cups of sprouts about 2 minutes before I finish cooking and we eat it tossed with stir fry noodles. It is of course delicious as is but you have to tweak things to your liking, right?! :) So yummy!

Super tasty flavor!  But needs way more sauce, so I doubled the soy sauce and then some!  Also added way more ginger and garlic and a few more veggies.

Good recipe. I used a bag of frozen stir-fry veggie mix and was disappointed in my choice. Next time I will use fresh. The chicken was easy and very delicious.

my first time making stirfry, not to bad! i only used 3 breasts and i still felt like there was too much chicken not enough veggies. doubled the ginger, soy, chicken bouilion and water and added cornstartch at the end for a thicker juice. let simmer while the rice was cooking for ab 10 mins and veggies were perfect texture. great flavor! will make again.

This was a great recipe that my kids loved. I have been trying to get them to eat more veggies and this went over quite well with them. I used a prepacked bag of stirfry veggies (broccoli, water chestnuts, carrots, bellpepper, snap peas, green beans, celery and onion). As other reviewers suggested, I added more ginger and some brown sugar. I also added a bit more soy sauce and had to add more cornstarch to thicken the sauce at the end. I would make this again!

This recipe was soooo good, it tasted just like something you would get from a restaurant!  I did tweak this a little bit.  I added cabbage instead of celery as someone suggested.  I added a few bell peppers, lots of bean sprouts, garlic instead of powder, and a half a cup of water.  I had no problems with the little bit of sauce thickening up.  The broccoli was cooked to perfection, the bean sprouts soaked up the flavors, yummy!

I just cooked and ate this. As good s take out? HA! Better than any take out I have had. I doubled my seasoning and you definetly need more cornstarch. Be prepared to do some taste tweeking at the end and go easy on the soy sauce. If your taste isn't quite right work with it! I will definetly cook this again!

delcious! i followed another reviewer's advice and added some brown sugar to the extra marinade that i made for the vegetables... it was unbelievably good. the entire time my husband and i were eating it we were saying "THIS IS SO GOOD!" afterwards, my husband asked if i would make this part of the normal meal rotation. (um, duh. of course i will...) thank you for a wonderful, healthy recipe!

Excellent dish, and quick to prepare.  I agree with other posters about it being a bit bland, but that is an easy fix.  I was low on ginger, so that could be part of the problem.  Next time i'll add some water chestnuts and a bit more spice.  Everyone loved it here and it was a great way to get more vegi's into my family.

Not a bad stir fry.  The chicken was good, used thighs instead of breasts.  Also added fish sauce and some red pepper flakes for a little more flavor.  Added more garlic and ginger and soy sauce to the veggies when I stir fried them.  Good with Indian rice as it is light and fluffy.  Also added some lemon juice at the very end for a little tang.

I was looking for something quick and easy and this turned out great.  I added brown sugar to the soy mixture and had to make other changes based upon what I had.  I only used sugar snap peas as the veggie and beef boullion instead of chicken.  It came out great and the chicken was super moist and tasty.

Delicious recipe! I followed the recipe besides substituting chicken broth for the water and leaving out the bouillon granules. I also used Tamari soy sauce as it has more flavor. Turned out great!

Good.  Followed the reviews and used extra garlic, extra ginger, a crushed garlic clove, and brown sugar with a tad extra cornstarch, and chicken broth in place of the water and boullion.  I used quadruple the broccoli and left out the carrots and celery....very good!

Delicious!!! Left out celery and added red bell pepper. Took other reviewers' advice and doubled marinade/sauce. Also added about 1 tbls of brown sugar and 1 tbls of Worchester sauce to marinade. Chicken turned out incredibly tender and veggies still had a bit of crunch.

Mmmm.. Excellent stir fry. Excellent. I agree with doubling the soy sauce and adding a touch more ginger.   I used carrots, fresh whole green beans, red peppers and onion as my vegetables. Served over rice.

Really good, though it has a mild flavor, and next time I'll add the Worcestershire sauce. Great for a satisfying, healthy dinner. However, how one can claim this takes 15 min to prep and 10 to cook is beyond me; you have to slice the chicken, coat it, and then refrigerate for 30 min! So even if you were using pre-chopped veggies, it's still more like 30-45 prep. But that's okay, we weren't in a hurry. Tossed in some mushrooms and a handful of almond slivers for crunch. Mmm!

Great basic recipe.  Technique for marinating chicken in cornstarch and then soy mixture is great.  However, this definitely needs more spice.  I will add some red pepper flakes and more garlic next time.  And I will add more cornstarch when I add the water and bouillon because it was too thin.  Good taste, just feel free to give it your own touch!

This was sooo good! I  tripled the sauce though. Doubled in the beginning, then did a separate one when I put the water and bullion in. It was perfect! Oh, and I also took the advice of a previous reviewer and added 2  T of Worchteshier (who knows how to spell that?!). Sooooo good!

This was very tasty, healthy and easy,  it was similar to my mom's stir fry!  (she is an incredible cook)  I added a bit of brown sugar and worcestersire sauce to the marinate as suggested.  I  used broccoli, carrots, and green peppers (unfortunately I didn't have any onions on hand).  I also sprinkled a little bit of sesame oil to the veggies while stir frying.  We enjoyed this stir fry over steaming hot rice.....yummy!

Good starter recipe.  I chose to add some snow peas.  In my opinion, it needs more sauce.  Next time I will increase the soy sauce & chicken broth I use to that I've got some sauce to cover my rice as well.

My hubby and I LOVED this dish! We made a couple changes though, leaving out carrots and celery, and instead adding mushrooms, zucchini, and onions. We also left out the chicken bouillon, but that was an accident.

After having this a few times, I started adding more of the soy and chicken bouillon to the sauce. Other than that, the family loves it! I've also been experimenting with vegis ( we don't add carrots, the family thinks they take over the rest of the vegis individual flavors) and have been adding snow peas, bean sprouts and mushrooms. Nom!

This turned out absolutely fantastic.  The only differnce I did was I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs.  Got rid of all the fat, and made into bitesize pieces.  Other than that, followed it to a tee.  I will be using this method from now on.  Perfect!

I too added more soy sauce and more veggies.  I forgot to add the corn starch to the chicken at the beginning so I sprinkled some into the pan at the last minute and it all turned out fine.  Next time I would use even less chicken to make it mostly veggie.  Bet it would be good with tofu too.

Delicious! Everyone in my family loved this. I added lots more garlic powder and used flour in lieu of cornstarch. I had to cook the chicken separate from the veggies because I doubled the recipe. It turned out fantastic, but I had to add some flour and soy sauce (mixed prior to adding) to the veggies. I assume the flour from the chicken was enough to thicken the chicken's sauce. I also added some broken peanuts to the mix because my family loves that. I put them in a sandwich bag and smacked them with a spoon.

This was good, but it took a LONG time for the liquid to thicken, so I had to add more cornstarch. It was also a little bland so I added more seasonings and chicken buillon. Then, I served it with brown rice and it was so good and nutritious! I am going to have to make this a lot more.

Everyone in my house was pleasantly surprised with this meal. I added a few extra veggies (pineapple, Zuchini and yellow squash, sliced fresh mushrooms) to give it a bit more substance and color. The chicken comes out very tender. If  memory serves... ginger root is a natural tenderizer???

This was just alright for me. I basically followed the recipe to the T-- and it was... meh. Not a lot of flavor, in my opinion. I ended up having to add some  Sambal Oelek for some kick. It was pretty bland. The next time, I'll definitely make some serious revisions. More soy sauce? Maybe a dash of black-bean sauce? I dunno- *something*.

Made as recipe states, but tasted towards the end of cooking, and really needed to make some additions.  I added triple the ginger, some more soy, used fresh garlic (3 cloves) to start, and 1/4tsp red pepper flakes - all really helped, it was fantastic after that.    If you get a "broth" at the end, you didn't add the cornstarch properly/or enough of it.

YUK!  Bland!  No flavor!  If you use this you need to WAY brighten up the sauce with probably TRIPLE of everything and CUT DOWN on the chicken stock/water boullion.  After I poured on the chicken stock it just looked like a bunch of vegetables and chicken boiling in water...nothing like a good Chinese sauce!  Had to add  add add add add ....2 more huge cloves of garlic, about 2Tbsps more of FRESH ginger, probably 1/4 cup more soy...even tried the brown sugar that someone here suggested and it still turned out like chicken and vegetables in a BLAND BLAND sauce!  Probably needs ketchup, rice vinegar or sherry and lots more brown sugar to flavor it up. I am very surprised by the good ratings----must be people who rarely cook who impressed themselves!

I really had never cooked stir fry before, this recipe seems to work out great.  I subbed the veggies with stuff that I liked better than the recipe's ingredients, it cam out awesome.  Definitely a great base recipe for stir fry.

As is, this recipe was okay enough. I was disappointed because I thought it would have more sauce. If you're expecting this to be a fairly saucy recipe resulting in a decent amount of sauce with the chicken and veggies (I was), beware: this is not the recipe for you. I would've preferred that there'd been more sauce, so next time I make this I'll probably modify it to make it that way.

This was excellent!  I used cabbage in place of the broccoli, Better than Bouillion in place of granules and sesame oil for the oil.  My chicken was precooked (leftovers),so I just cooked it in its marinade for a minute to brown it.  I will definitely make this again. Yum!

We all loved this.  I doubled the soy sauce in the chicken and used fresh ginger.....about 3/4 tsp?  and 3/4 tsp. garlic powder.  Also added a T. of brown sugar and 1 T. soy sauce to the chicken broth.  Delicious! and easy.  We had it with Basmati Rice.  Mmmmm

This was great, although I did take a lot of advice from others and tweak a few things to my preference.  Most importantly, I doubled the sauce, adding half when directed and half at the end with the water/bouillon.  I also added the cornstarch at the end with the water/bouillon/sauce mixture to help thicken.  I'm glad I did both things.  I still would like to see it make a little more sauce.  It wasn't saucy at all, just wet.  Served over white rice.  Will definitely keep this recipe and keep playing with it until it suits our taste perfectly.  Used veggies I had on hand-broccoli, cauliflower and baby carrots.  A bag of mixed frozen veggies would be even easier/quicker, but even without it was a quick and easy meal!

Ok I dont know what went wrong but when I added the marinated chicken to the hot pan the sauce stuck to the pan (it was a deep non-stick skillet and I had doubled the soy sauce etc as recommended).  l was lucky enough to be able to get the stuck on sauce out of the pan and the chicken turned out nicely, however after adding the chicken broth it seemed more like vegetables in a chicken broth then any stir-fty I ever had.  ended up adding about 1/8 C of teryaki sauce to save it!

This recipe was very easy to follow.  I did increase the soy sauce and ginger.  I added honey to sweeten it up.  Sesame oil works great in this recipe.  I also added water chestnuts and a frozen bag of teriyaki vegetables.  The extra water was not needed, a splash of chicken stock and you are set.  Thanks for a healthy and delicious meal.

Good recipe.  Added a little extra ginger and soy sauce like everyone stated.  I think next time I will put water chestnuts instead of celery and add some cashews.  Yummy.  I made with brown rice.

This stir fry is fantastic! I've made it exactly as written, and the whole family (including the picky one) loved it. The picky one even requests it! This time I used pork tenderloin as that is what I had on hand, and O BOY! YUMMY! Added some soy to the veggies and loved it!

So I cheat and use costco's bad of veggies but I use the recipe for the chicken and love it. I have done it both "as is" and tweaked. When I tweak it I double the soy sauce, ginger, and garlic powder. I also have used flour instead of cornstarch when I was out and it worked fine, just double the amount of that it calls for, so 6Tbsp instead of 3. This is a staple at our house.

My husband was crazy about this.  I doctored up a bit by adding more ginger, soy, and garlic.  I also added a little teryiyaki at the end.  A simple clean dish.

Thought the recipe was good.  I added some snow peas and mushrooms to the mix (needed to get used) and they were a great addition to it.

Didn't read the recipe right, so I didn't marinate the chicken in the soy sauce mixture.  Instead, I pan fried the chicken and onions in the soy sauce / ginger mixture, then set aside.  Stir fried the vegetables (green pepper, carrots and broccoli) with a 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper.  I added the chicken to the vegetables, and then stirred in water/bouillon and cornstarch.  Turned out great!  Next time I might put in a little brown sugar as another reviewer recommended.

Very easy and tasty.  I substituted marinated extra firm tofu for chicken to make it vegetarian.  I also used a package of "stir fry vegetables" for convienience.  It was one of those microwave right in the bag things - I microwaved it for 2 minutes and then added it to the stir fry pan with the tofu, cooked it for another couple minutes....perfect!

We found this dish to be without much taste.  The "gravy" was like water and it pretty much tasted like boiled chicken and vegetables over rice.

Made this dish last night...wonderful. My husband said this was the best stir-fry I've made yet.  I did per other reviews add more cornstarch and doubled the soy sauce.  I also added 1 tbls of worcestershire sauce and omitted the ginger.  I used reduced sodium soy sauce and I chicken bouillon with 3/4 cups of water and used frozen stir-fry veggies, that i had on had.  Smelled and tasted wonderful will definitely make again.  Very quick and easy.

I made the recipe with tofu, added purple cabbage, scallions, red peppers, extra spices and brown sugar with the corn starch as another reviewer suggested.  Served over brown rice.  Excellent results!   I look forward to making this many times in the future, rotating the vegetables  for seasonal variety.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

This was good but not excellent.  My recommendations: double the sauce and the cornstarch. Use 1/2 on chicken as directed, other 1/2 on the veggies (add constarch right after veggies and soy sauce mixture when veggies are halfway done). Also double the veggies. Do not double the water/chicken bouillon. I added red pepper flakes, but maybe it needs some Chinese 5-spice or some kind of asian chili paste. Probably needs some fresh ginger and green onions. I served over brown rice, and served egg drop soup and edamame on the side.

I read some of the reviews and changed the recipe a bit.  I added a little more corn starch & used teriyaki marinade instead of soy sauce.  I added a little extra teriyaki marinade for flavor.  I left the celery out and using all fresh vegetables I added snow peas, white onions, mushrooms and bean sprouts.  I also took others advice and added garlic powder & brown sugar.

It's worth repeating that this is a good basic recipe.  I should have added more cornstarch to thicken.  You can add just about anything to this recipe.  I added peppers and snow peas and I should have added water chestnusts for the crunch.  I served it over brown rice.  Delicious!  My husband really loved it!!

This recipe was okay.  Not really what I'd expected.  I followed the directions almost exactly (minus broccoli + snap peas) and used low sodium soy sauce instead of regular.  It smelled really great and looked just like restaurant stir fry - just wasn't very tasty/flavorful.

I was so disappointed :(  This smelled and looked so good while I was making it, but in the end, had no flavor to me at all.

This was a great base stir-fry recipe!  I actually did little to change it which is rare for me.  I did add a bit of brown sugar as someone else suggested which helps cut some of the saltiness.  I did increase the amount of sauce just a bit and used whatever veggies I had on hand.  Simple and tasty.  A great family meal!

Came out incredibly salty. It had a good flavor but the combination of soy sauce and bullion was just too salty for my taste. Maybe a reduced sodium soy sauce next time...

Very good recipe.  I used pork tenderloin and made extra so I tripled the sauce, but still wasnt enough.  Also used broccoli, snow peas, baby corn, water chesnuts and bok choy.  Will use again!

Really Really good stuff. Has that extra special 'chinese food' smell/taste. We didn't use all the veggies here, just substituted a frozen 'asian medley' in its place. Also added some teriyaki sauce at the very end and some extra ginget to give it a kick. Served over white rice.

I am a freshman in college and fed four college boys with this meal. It was absolutely delicious! I did a few slight changes. I used two tablespoons of minced garlic, used a lot more olive oil than instructed and used about double the soy sauce. Regardless, of these slight changes, it tasted unbelievable and I will most definitely be making it for the guys again!

This was really good! I doubled the seasoning and used jarred ginger and garlic. Also took the suggestion of another reviewer and added a mix of cornstarch and water to amplify the sauce. Veggies that I used were mushrooms, beans (from the garden), bean sprouts, celery, carrot and gr. pepper. The whole family really enjoyed it!

Found this recipe while browsing for more stir-fry recipes. I have used this stir-fry recipe for years.  My entire family loves it.  Sometimes I use brown rice since it is healthier.  Also, I change up the veggies to make it seem like a different dish.

My family loves this and there are many options as to vegetables.  We like a little more soy sauce and also a little sauce with the meat and vegetables to serve over rice.  The chicken is so tasty that we like serve it by itself.

This was very good!  I was skeptical when I saw how few seasonings there were for the chicken but they added just the right flavor and lots of it!  This was very good served over chowmein noodles.  My 7 year old son actually asked for seconds!

This was EXCELLENT!  The only thing I changed was that I added a touch more olive oil, when I felt the veggies needed a little extra time to saute.  I also added beef to the dish, along with the chicken and it was simply devine!  I Served It Over Brown Rice.   Thank You For A GREAT Recipe!!!

this was great! I added a bit of terryiki sauce to the soy mixture as well as brown sugar. Also, I just used what veggies we had on hand (carrots, yellow pepper, and onion). Great taste and not to salty.

This is a very tasty recipe.  The few extra things I added were some water chestnuts, a dollop of Lawry's Sesame Ginger sauce to the marinade, and some crunchy chow mein noodles.  My family loves this meal!!

This recipe was GREAT! I took the recommendations and doubled the garlic powder,soy sauce and fresh ginger. However I also added 1 tsp of minced garlic. The marinade is awesome and I will use it on its own in the future. I have very picky boys and this meal got their official two thumbs up!!!! ty to the original poster!!!!!!

Excellent with some tweaking.  I replaced the onion with 1 C green onion chopped and added a chopped bell pepper.  For the sauce, I replaced the garlic with 3 cloves fresh minced garlic (I love garlic) and added some brown sugar and red pepper flakes.  And finally, I threw in two large handfuls of raw peanuts.  YUM.  Definitely a keeper.

Delicious! Easy to follow and tasted great, especially the chicken. I followed as is, but might add a little more soy sauce at the end to flavor it a little more next time.

I love the marinade in this recipe. I marinated the chicken but instead of fresh veggies, used a large package of frozen chinese veggies and 1 c. chicken broth. I also used a healthier, light olive oil. It was quick, easy and very tasty! I dabbed a little honey on it before serving - oh, yum!

I received a new wok and tried this recipe in it i did change the oil from veggie to a flavored wok oil the following the directions for marinating the chicken was easy but i did it too long and it looked more like beef then chicken but that was my fault so stick to the time it states other then that it came out great the family loved it thanks

Def add double-triple soy sauce and garlic powder.  And I added a touch more cornstarch at the end to thicken it up a bit.  Otherwise, mwah!

As I only had a 1/2 chicken breast, I cut the spice portions (to taste) and  added red pepper, and brown sugar to the sauce  as others did.   I  also defrosted and warmed up some cooked pasta.   To serve, I spooned the chicken and   vegetables over it, and then the soy sauce mix.  My husband LOVED it. It was fabulous. We both loved it !  Oh,  did I say I forgot to add the broth and corn starch?  Well, I did, and will forget it again.  Didn't need it . One, other thing, I had defrosted peas, and at the last minute sprinkled them over .  The bright green gave it great color. My husband said "Definitely make it again !" Can't wait.

This was a great base recipe!  I used extra corn starch and then threw in lots of frozen vegetables, (green beans, squash, broccoli, etc.) until it looked right.  I did add some minced garlic and lots more garlic powder.  And I used chicken broth instead of the water and bullion.  Thank you so much!

Very yummy! I used 3 tbsp of soy sauce (lite w/ less sodium), 1tsp freeze-dried garlic instead of garlic powder and added maybe a tsp of hot chili sauce to the mixture that went in with the chicken. For veggies I used fresh carrots and celery that I needed to use up and then added about a cup of frozen broccoli, a 1/2 cup frozen grilled bell peppers (love Target!!), and 1/2 cup frozen pineapple chunks (love Trader Joes!). Later when I added the water and boullion, it needed a little more (1 tsp) cornstarch to thicken and then I added about 1 tbsp brown sugar and a couple more splashes of soysauce. Served it over brown rice and boy was it YUMMY!!

So after reading many many reviews I took most everyone's advice and doubled the soya sauce and spices. Be sure when you add your chicken to the bag the chicken is not too wet as mine was and formed a paste once the cornstarch was added... then burnt to the bottom of the pan when I fryed the chicken. I felt that the sauce was much to runny and ended up making more sauce in a pot on my stove and thickened it with chicken stock and cornstarch. Then I added the thinkened sauce to the chicken and veggies. It turned out very good although the original recipe would be very very bland. I will make this again but I will marinade the chicken then make the extra sauce and add it all together. This is pretty hard to mess up believe me I tried!!

This came out really well but only after adding nearly double the soy sauce and other flavor enhancers. I think if we had made it as the recipe calls for it it would've been too bland. We also added baby corn, water chestnuts, and used all fresh veggies. Would make it again for sure!

The only thing I did different from the original recipe was to use sesame oil and sprinkle with sesame seeds. This was a big hit in my house however i felt like it could have used more flavor as i found myself adding salt. I will take other reviewers suggestion to double the spice amounts next time.

5 stars for the ease of this recipe. 4 stars for needing more flavor.  I added red pepper instead of carrots and a couple more shakes of soy sauce. I also doubled the sauce.  I will up the ginger next time and sautee(sp?) some fresh garlic with the onions prior to adding the rest of the veggies.

Like others have said before, this was a little bland. Still, there was nothing wrong with it: it was totally edible. Just not an oh-my-god recipe.

This was a really good recipe. I unfortunately decided to change it up a little after reading a whole lot of reviews. I doubled the amount of soy sauce, ginger, & garlic powder. I added 1 T of cornstarch to the chicken in the bag & then added the soy sauce & spices as stated. I only used 1T of oil to cut down on the fat & after cooking the chicken I used the same pan for the veggies and added 1 tsp. of minced garlic and 1T of teriyaki sauce (no oil) and cooked until desired tenderness. When adding the liquid, I mixed 1 c. chicken broth, 1T teriyaki, and 2T. cornstarch. It came out really great, although next time I may only add 1T. of cornstarch, since we like our sauce a little bit more runny to soak into the rice. Overall this was a great recipe and the chicken had wonderful flavor!A great recipe to add your own personal tastes! I will definitely be adding this to our household menu!

This is very tasty stir-fry - I used chix thighs - threw in veggies we had on hand -like green and orange peppers - added mushrooms and asparagus at the very end. Added some crushed garlic, 1 T of rice vinegar & 1 T brown sugar. My children love stir fry - but we've never had it this good - can't wait for them to come home and try this! I don't think you can ruin it - just go with your taste!

This recipe was delicious!  My husband and I are wanting to eat healthier and I came across this recipe.  I was a little skeptical, because my husband does not like cooked veggies (I know, strange), and this recipe has several.  I made the recipe as is, but did follow one reviewers advice and doubled the soy sauce, garlic powder, and ginger.  Oh, and I also ommited the celery and added bell pepper.  It was delicious!  The real kicker, was that my husband liked it too(except for the broccoli...oh well, more for me).  This is definitely a keeper!!!

This recipe turned out great! I didn't have cornstarch so I added 2 tablespoons of organic wheat flour and it worked just as good. I also doubled the soy sauce and garlic powder as I felt I wanted more flavor! I also a teaspoon of soy sauce to the veggies too! It was wonderful served with white rice!

Minor tweaks: Doubled recipe, added zucchini and 1 can of chicken broth (instead of water and boullion), a couple dashed more garlic powder, a few dashes of low sodium soy sauce and teriyaki sauce. Served over choice of plain boiled rice or fried rice from local favorite chinese restaurant. Delish! Thanks for sharing!

The chicken is this is very tasty, however loses some of its flavor when added back into the stir fry mix. The recipe calls for too much water. Try adding half of the water and a bit of soy sauce to add flavor.

Not my favorite stir-fry.  I really liked how the chicken turned out.  Overall the recipe was pretty bland and the sauce wasn't thick.  My 3 year old daughter loved it and had multiple servings.

This was very good, and I will make again, although it could use a little more flavor next time around (more soy sauce?).  I also think cashews would be great in this!  Thanks for the recipe.

Great, easy, delicious recipe that we modified slightly and will continue to play with as we make it in the future. We added about 2 x as much soy sauce as well as a little bit of sesame oil, toasted sesame seeds and chopped mushrooms...delicious. Better than take-out & definitely a lot healthier. I look forward to making it again and again.

Great flavor but my sauce never thickened.  Next time I will add the liquid and bullion cubes to the chicken and let that thicken before adding to veges.

We were less than thrilled with this recipe.  Not only did we find it bland, but I thought the coating made the chicken somewhat slimey.

We loved this recipe!  Easy and quick to prepare.   I put minced garlic in with the veggies instead of garlic powder in the marinade.  Simple, wonderful flavors.

Pretty good, though I like most store mixes better. I like lots of spices and a thicker sauce, so I would have to tweak this a good bit.

It was really good but lacking in flavor. I think next time I'll add more garlic and soy sauce, maybe a little bit of red pepper flakes. Overall it is a great start and definitely a keeper.

This was a very good base recipe. I added 1 TBSP. teriyaki sauce and 1 TBSP. Sherry and 2 cloves fresh garlic to the chicken in the bag. It gives the chicken such amazing flavor! Also i used frozen stir-fry veggies and fresh sliced mushrooms and some onion. I like my food spicy so i also added crushed red pepper to the sauce. I suggest doubling the sauce.

Me & my family love this recipe - I make it all the time. which says a lot b/c I never make the same thing.  Super easy to follow.  Only difference is I use the steamer bags to cook the veggies perfect steam crisp. I add garlic & olive oil to the steamer bag.  Taste better than TAKE OUT!!

I use this recipe all of the time and my family loves it. The only change I make now is, at the very end, I add 3T soy sauce & 2T cornstarch to the water and bouillon and then add it to the chicken/vegetable mixture. It adds a little extra flavor and also thickens the sauce. Also, if I have fresh ginger and garlic on hand I'll use those, not the powder. And I use whatever vegetables I have on hand - mushrooms, bell peppers, etc. It's great and you can prepare everything in advance and cook it pretty quickly when it's time.

Good for my first try of stir-fry food! I doubled the soysauce (b/c I like lots of soy sauce), did not use ginger, and only used 1/2 cup of water. Wished I has used the whole cup as directed but still came out tasty!

This was alright, nothing too exciting. I'll make it again just because this is a great dish to throw veggies in. I added mushrooms, baby corn, broccoli, red peppers, onions, carrots.   Next time I'll figure out how to add more flavor to this.

It was a easy recipe and really turned out good! The kids ate it up...although we did add more soy sauce towards the end. Will make again!

This was excellent.  I added water chestnuts and chopped peanuts for more crunch.

This is a very good recipe.  The chicken was the best part.  The vegetable swould have been better if I had used fresh and not frozen ones.

This recipe was delicious!! For a beginner cook, I was slightly worried I wouldn't be able to do it, but it was perfect and my husband (who hates vegetables) LOVED it!. I added a little more soy sauce, the brown sugar like recommended, and instead of celery I used cabbage and mushrooms.

Good basic recipe. Better with fresh ginger and high-quality canned chicken broth - the granules always lend a slightly artifical taste to a dish.

This recipe was so good!  We did a couple of things differently, like we used shake and bake original mix to coat the chicken and we did bell peppers instead of onions, but I'm sure the original recipe was just as great!  Very easy too!

I just have to say that when I was about to buy the bottle of soy sauce to make this recipe I noticed a bottle of stir fry sauce next to it that was actually cheaper than the soy sauce! This recipe is good, but for the time it takes to assemble the sauce yourself just buy the premade sauce! You don't have to worry about accidentally getting too much or not enough of any seasonings and it is so much faster.

I thought this was the easiest and best simple stir fry recipe I have found,I did make a couple of changes. We used a bag of stir fry mix with the noodles. I also added more soy, ginger and garlic to the veggies.
Great recipe!

I only gave this recipe four stars.  Next time I will go with what the other reveiwers say about adding more ginger and garlic.  I may even add a hint of brown sugar to the soy sauce.  I found the recipe to be very bland.  It was lacking flavor.

This was really, really good. I have replaced this recipe for my usual chicken stir-fry. I did up the seasoning amounts to taste because I really like garlic and ginger. I cut back on the soy because I was worried about it being too salty. But everyone ended up adding more soy to their plates. Wonderful meal!

This was very good.  My family loves it.  I did not realize I did not have the ginger until I got started but it was still good.  I am sure it will be even better with the ginger next time.

This is a great base recipe for stir-fry. I marinated the chicken for about an hour, cooked that first, and then added a mixture of veggies I had on hand.  I also added some cashews and served over rice.  The chicken was so moist!  I added extra soy sauce during the cooking process.  Very good!

We love this stir-fry. I did use flour instead of corn starch and I added snow peas and shredded the carrots and used fresh garlic and ginger. (I keep the ginger in the freezer and it stays fresh forever...thank you Rachael Ray). Also I did not let my chicken marinade, but it was still awesome. My 2 year old had two helpings.

Awesome just as is!  Also, it is very easy to add more vegetables to stretch your money.  Next time, I think I'll make a second batch of maranade to put the veggies in.  That way they will have just a bit more flavor.

Had no broccoli on hand so used up some of the vegies in the fridge - cabbage and zucchini with carrots, celery and onion. Otherwise followed the recipe. This was good but would probably add more ginger in next time as it barely made an impact on the taste and we love ginger!

This was okay.  I have had better stir fries before.  It was a bit bland and too watery at the end.  I added more soy sauce, fresh garlic instead of powdered and used broccoli, carrots, red pepper and onion.  I threw the recipe away.

Great base recipe for this stir-fry.  I liked the idea of tossing the chicken in cornstarch and then adding the seasonings.  The one thing I will be doing differently is to add 1/2 tsp of brown sugar next time.  I like it as is, but my boyfriend likes it a bit sweeter. I can't speak for the veggies and the recipe as a whole because I did not use the same vegetables, but the base was great.

Excellent.  I've made this dish a couple of times now.  The first time I kept to the recipe, second time I substituted the broccoli for water chestnuts and peppers.  Tastes great.

I didn't give this one 5 stars because I didn't exactly follow the recipe. I only used 3 bonelesss, skinless chicken breasts with the soy, ginger and garlic like the recipe stated. I used an Asian variety fozen veggie bag from Birds Eye. After I stir fried the chicken, I added the bag of forzen veggies and a little less than 1/2 can of low sodium chicken broth. I stir fried that for about 10 minutes, just enough to warm the veggies. We loved it. Thanks for the recipe!!

the best stir fry I've ever made. I've also tried the same sause mix with beef and added only broccoli and onions without the other vegies. Healthy, easy, and very tasty

I doubled the marinade and added some "stir fry" sauce to the vegetables and the tase ended up being awesome!  I used fresh garlic in the marinade and snow peas instead of celery also.  Far surpassed any other stir fry I have made!

Delicious! Even my kids had this dish. But I also added: 2 cloves minced garlic, 1 Tbsp ginger, 1 red bell pepper and 1/4 cup cashew nuts (I rinsed to lower the sodium in this dish). Served with brown rice. I will make it again for sure!

Great recipe!  First time ever making a stir fry and this was easy.  I didn't have the celery but substitued green pepper instead.  Omitted the onion as my husband doesn't like onion.  He normally is a plain ol' borning food guy (ie. meat and potato's man) but even he loved this!  I will play around with it some but this is a great tasting base recipe.

This recipe is GREAT! The only things I did different were I used fresh garlic (2cloves) and I added some rice vinegar to soften the chicken. I omitted the celery (because I don't like it) and I substituted mushrooms. I also used sesame oil instead of veggie oil.
All in all~ great recipe!

This is a very good starter recipe.  I agree with other reviewers that "as is" the sauce is pretty bland.  To counter this I made the following adjustments: I added 2 T. brown sugar to the chicken marinade and then about 1/4 c. soy sauce and an additional sprinkle of both garlic and ginger to the sauce.  I ended up having to thicken it with a bit of cornstarch and water, but the end result was really good!  My family can be very picky and they really liked this!  Thank you for a great recipe!

This was okay, you definitely need to add more ginger and garlic then the recipe says, I also added more soy sauce to the chicken while it was cooking. I will probably make this again, but will tweek it a bit to satisfy our tastes. One thing that i loved though was the tenderness of the chicken, it was melt in your mouth tender. very good.

Delicious... I added some extra soy, ginger, substituted a couple of cloves of fresh garlic for the powdered, and added a tablespoon of brown sugar.
Also subbed some low-sodium chicken broth for the water/boullion.

I converted this to a vegetarian meal by making "mock chicken" tofu and using vegetable broth.  Very good results, I must say!  There were many ways that it could have been enhanced: sesame oil, sweet chili sauce, more spices, etc.  But by just following the recipe, I found that it was fast, easy, and slightly addictive...

Added extra soy sauce and brown sugar after adding the chicken broth.  Overall-I thought this was a little bland, however my husband loved it.

I tried this recipe for the first time last night.  After reading other reviews I used more ginger and garlic; but, it still was not enough-the flavor was very bland.  Also, it did not thicken enough, so I mixed up some cornstarch and water to thicken it. Next time I make it I will play around with the spices to give it more flavor, possibly more soy sauce?? All in all it was pretty good, just needs to be tweaked a bit.

Good, but not spicy enough.  I added extra ginger, garlic plus some seasame oil but it still could have used some more kick.  

We wanted more veggies so added green pepper, snow peas and mushrooms.  All in all pretty good.

The flavor of the meat is great in this recipe, unfortunately, the sauce never thickened up and tasted like chicken broth.  I think some minor modifications would fix it, but we weren't all that impressed overall.

Like everyone else, I thought this was a great recipe to clean out the veggie drawer with.  I followed the recipe otherwise except I used homemade chicken broth as I was out of chicken bullion.  We loved it, no problems with thickening) but may add a little more ginger at the end next time. A nice surprise was how much great it was the next day.  Will definitely make again.

This was YUMMY!  I altered the recipe a bit - put in cabbage, carrots, broccoli, and mushrooms, and left out the water.  It had a nice texture.  The bouillon was a bit salty for how much I made... Next time either cut the bouillon in half, or double the veggies.

When I made this dish it turned out great! A tip I would give people who are considering this recipe is to add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and some sugar snap peas. My whole family loved this it and when I was making this dinner I tested it every so often and if it tasted blah I added either salt and pepper, ginger, garlic salt or more soy sauce.

very good and easy to make. I used 1/2 cup of water and it came out perfect. I will definetely use this recipe again. I used bok choy because I didn't have celery, and shallots instead of onions and peppers instead of brocolli. I think you can use any kind of vegetable and it will come out good.

Very good recipe.  I will use less water next time as it had too much liquid for our taste.  I substituted beef bullion for chicken as I didn't realize I didn't have any chicken until it was too late.  It still turned out good.

This recipe was just "ok".  It was quite bland - but probably a good place to start for a stir-fry recipe.  Definitely needs more flavor.  Chicken was very tender and I liked the way it was cooked with cornstarch.  I will look for a different recipe next time.

I thought this recipe was great!  The kids liked it just as well!  I substituted mushrooms for broccoli and served them with crunchy noodles and brown rice - what a hit!

Delicious! I also had to add a cornstarch/water combo to thicken the sauce. I added a small can of pineapple and didn't drain the juice which gave it a nice sweetness.

I traded out the broccoli for some snow peas and 1/2 each green, yellow, and red bell pepper. At the end I added 1tsp brown sugar, another 1 tbsp soy sauce, and 1 tsp gingerr. Fantastic and so simple!! The hubby put his on a tortilla with some sour cream and made it into a fajita. I'll definitely make this more often.

This is a good recipe for a fast Stir Fry, but I prefer to use fresh garlic and ginger and keep the veggies crisp.

Sorry but this was very bland tasting. When I try a new recipe I like to follow it exactly. There wasn't much flavor to this one. Will keep looking.

This recipe is awesome.  My brother has celiac disease and we have a hard time finding main dishes that are gluten-free (or without flour).  I doubled the ginger and garlic and added a Tbsp. of soysauce.  The veggies I used this past time were an onion, broccoli, mushrooms and carrots.

This was definitely good, but  it really needed a lot of doctoring. I used about double the amount of soy sauce, firm tofu instead of chicken and a mix of white, wild and red rice. I added snow peas and cut down on the amount of broccoli, and I added 2 tsp of chili pepper flakes (YUM!). Next time around I think I'll leave out the carrots and possibly add red pepper.

**update** I made this a second time and liked it MUCH better. I used brown rice, 1/2 sesame oil and 1/2, black sesame seeds, and I substituted carrots and broccoli for snow peas and sweet peppers. It was really good!!

Very nice mild flavor.  We added some soy sauce at the table, but is great without it too!  Followed recipe to a T.

Wow!  My 3 yr old son ate 3 servings!  I changed the vegetables to use up what I had on hand and I sweetened the sauce a little be adding 2 tsp molasses.  This is definately a keeper.
