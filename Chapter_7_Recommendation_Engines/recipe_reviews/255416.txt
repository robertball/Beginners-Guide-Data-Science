Okonomiyaki is such a comfort food for me because I grew up with it. There are two ways of making this dish -- the Kansai (Osaka) style and the Hiroshima style. This recipe is giving you the Kansai style, which is mixing everything together and then pan frying. The Hiroshima style is my preference, which is layering and flipping and layering and flipping. LOVE this so much. My filling ingredients were cabbage, green onion, and spam because I had it on hand. I also added yakisoba noodles, which is another popular ingredient. This sauce is AWESOME. You can also mix worcestershire sauce with tonkatsu sauce and ketchup. Love the suggestion for panko as a topping, along with mayonnaise (use kewpie)....Thank you sooo much!  Oh, ps, the tapioca pearls are interesting...I'll need to do that in the future!

Very delicious! easier to make, cook and turn several smaller pancakes than one big one.  bean sprouts are a nice addition. Can be made veggie using tofu instead of bacon and sausage or with shrimp or fish for those who enjoy seafood.
