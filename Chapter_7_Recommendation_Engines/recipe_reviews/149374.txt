This was just ok. Added a little black pepper to the egg mixture, and used fried up some deli turkey with the asparagus which was a nice touch. The frittata wasn't bad by any means, it just didn't blow us away.

I gave this five stars because it is has perfect consistency and is a great base recipe.  I like a tad more flavor.  I added a couple dashes of hotsauce to the egg mixture and sprinkled fresh chives on top.  It only cooked for about 15 minutes in my oven and took another 3-4 min for the cheese to melt on top.
