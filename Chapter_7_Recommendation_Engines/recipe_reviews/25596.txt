The only way the pudding could be bland tasting is if you use bottled lemon juice.  I used fresh squeezed lemon juice and also used cream not milk.  (Once in awhile you just have to give flavor to a recipe over skimping on fat.)  This recipe was not the best lemon pudding recipe I've had but it was darn good.

I made this for my husband's birthday tonight. I followed the recipe exactly. We ate it fresh out of the oven, and between two adults and two toddlers, it was gone within ten minutes. The cake layer is light and airy, the pudding layer is creamy and lemony, and the whole thing was just delicious. Thanks for a great recipe!

Fantastic pudding cake!  The cake was really light and airy, and the pudding was tart and sweet.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out delicious.  Definitely a keeper!

Made this exactly as described, no changes, and it was gone in minutes. Mine is a family of college kids, and this was a perfect hit. The next time I made it, I did a double-batch, and the leftovers were even better cold the next day for breakfast!

A nice change from the usual baked cake & pudding recipes - caramel, chocolate, rhubarb, etc... It was full of flavour (I did use the zest of an entire lemon & fresh squeezed juice) and was very light. I topped it off with fresh raspberries and whipped cream...delicious!

I made it according to the recipe but added slightly more lemon juice and it was great! super lemony and tart. Everyone at work and at home loved it. And so simple to make. Only problem was it was messy to serve. But it was delicious immediately out of the oven and still great the next day!

I had one lemon left and wasn't sure what to do with it when I came across this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and topped it with freshly whipped cream. It is really yummy! I love anything lemon and it's not an overpowering lemon taste. I used all of the zest from the lemon and the juice I got was a little less than the 1/4 called for. My husband and kids love it, so I will definitely make this again.

This didn't turn out for me.  40 minutes into the baking, and the top had barely even set.  Ended up cooking it well over an hour and by then, the "pudding" curdled.  Thanks for sharing.  The flavor was great.

Absolutely divine! Despite major goofups like a drop of water in my white eggs, which made beating them into stiff peaks next to impossible, and the gas for my oven running out in the middle of baking, this pudding came out so fine. I followed the recipe exactly as given and I couldn't find anything I would want to change.

This had a great tart lemon taste I was looking for but I thought the cake layer had an odd texture, not as much like a cake as I was anticipating. I probably won't make it again.

I usually make the chocolate version of this. My husband and I enjoyed this. We ate it with whipped cream. It was light and airy, and was three servings for us. I used extra lemon juice and rind (2 whole lemons total.) I liked it better cold, it tasted less eggy.

Simple, tasty treat! I used only a half cup agave for sweetener, only one tablespoon butter, substituted 1 tsp lemon extract for zest, used soy milk and used egg beaters so mixed everything all at once. Turned out perfect depsite the modifications.

Delicious and light - served with a dollop of fresh whipped, very lightly sweetened whip cream - will definitely make again.

I made this and used 1/3 cup fresh key lime juice and 1/2 teaspoon zest and added 1 3/4 cups milk the extra milk made more pudding. I served it warm. My guest thought it was wonderful and so did I.  Lillie Crane

Really easy and delicious. I used fresh lime juice actually as I didn't have any lemons on hand. Turned out perfectly. Did take a little longer than recommended to cook. If/when I make it again, I will probably beat the egg whites first and remove them (for convenience) so I can use my mixing bowl for both sets of ingredients.

A big hit.  Not a spec was leftover.  A little on the sweet side so will try to reduce the sugar next time.  Took longer to cook than in recipe.  End result was worth the wait.  This is a keeper.

Years ago I made this and had my parents over for dinner.  My dad (in his 70's at the time) said his mother used to make this!  Tip:  don't bother with this recipe if you aren't prepared to use fresh lemons - it truly makes the difference!  I don't really even like lemon desserts (especially fluffy ones) but this one is excellent!

Family favourite. Easily doubled. Use the lemon rind from the entire lemon for a real tangy taste.

I  made this three times the first week that i found it.  It is delicious hot or cold.  Everyone I served it to loved it.  When I make it for my family I double the lemon juice as we like it tart.

My 8 year old and I loved it. I used both more lemon and less sugar than the recipe called for. For the lemon, I used an entire large lemon's worth of lemon zest which was more than one teaspoon and the same lemon's juice was more than 1/4 cup.  I only used 1/2 cup sugar.

We loved this dessert! I made this recipe as is, except for using unsweetened plain soy milk instead of milk. 
I've never had nor made a pudding cake before so I have nothing to compare it to, but this is definitely a winner as far as flavor (lemony) and consistency (fluffy) are concerned.

Was so sceptical when I saw how watery the batter was....but it just turned out beautifully done. Took more time to bake it though, an hour or so but it's definitely a recipe to keep.  All the family just loved it :)

The term 'cake' in the title threw me.  It wasn't a cake at all. I didn't care for the egg white sort of texture of the 'cake' (ie. top layer).  It certainly was lemony and that saved the day, but I won't make this again.

Very unique! The flavor is delicious! I liked the texture, but others who tried it were not so sure. I liked the baked bread on top and pudding beneath.

I was very suprise how good this turned out, which was more like a cake custard. The ingredients seemed too skimpy to make a "cake" and halfway through prep I got concerned, but it turned out great. I did make minor changes: used 1/2 cup of sugar, lemon extract instead of lemon zest & almond milk and I didn't even whip the egg whites all the way through.  Yummy!

Delicious! I reduced the sugar by half and used skim milk and it turned out great. It is a healthy and delicious dessert anytime.
