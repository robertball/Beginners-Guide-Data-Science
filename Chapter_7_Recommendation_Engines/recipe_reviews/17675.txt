We loved this recipe.  Used cut up turkey peices instead and per previous reviews, added a can of chopped green chiles and cheese.  We also added some fresh sliced mushrooms while sauting the peppers and onions.  Overall, very good and the bacon was a nice touch.  Will make again and would highly recommend.

Delicious! I used yellow Spanish rice instead of plain white rice and the recipe was even more flavorful that way. My only tiny complaint is that the recipe was kind of salty. Between the bacon and the other ingredients, I think I could have eliminated (or at least cut down on) the extra salt.

It turned out fairly well; I used the suggestions of green chili, cayenne , and not adding salt, however I hadn't realized to used 2 cups COOKED RICE, not 2 cups raw. I'm sure it will turn out better next time.

Awesome! The bacon adds a great flavor. Rather than use chicken pieces, I cut up two boneless, skinless breasts into bite-size chunks. Reheats very well! Recommended for bachelors by Bachelor Steve!

Family liked it.  Smelled great.  Kept thinking it would be good with ham or sausage, or even cooked ground beef instead.  Wouldn't be as healthy but, oh well.

I found this recipe by chance. I used six chicken breast, and my wife and i ate the whole thing.
If you dont try it, you will miss out.
It is one of the best.

This recipe is awesome! I added a 4 oz can of mild diced chiles. Serve with warm tortillas and shredded cheddar cheese to make a meal!

I made this for my entire family of 6 and they all loved it. Even my 15 month old son wanted more. This recipe is basically like chicken jumbalaya.

Very tasty and so easy!  I also made Pico de Gallo Chicken Quesadillas for apetizer, and the meal was a real hit!  And the Arroz con Pollo was almost better reheated the next day!

This was a big hit, and quick dinner fix.   I do confess we omitted the bacon.  :-)

I thought this was bland. Too much of a salsa taste. There was too  much rice for that amount of chicken. It took 45 minutes to cook.

This recipe was much too tomato-ey--not like traditional arroz con pollo at all.  If you like a tomato-ey, mexican flavor, though, you will probably like this one.

VERY, VERY Tasty!  Easy to make and my family loved it!  I added 1 tsp of cayenne pepper to give it a little bite and the next time I would add a little more tomato sauce in order for the rice to become softer.

This was just ok.  I wouldn't make it again.  For the effort gone into it, the results weren't as good as expected.  My husband said, "This is ok -- for a box mix anyway."

This was a big hit. I only used about 18 ounces of salsa (that's all I had) and it turned out great - any more than that might be too much on the tomatoes. Kids loved it.

The bacon gives this recipe a great flavor! Add cheese, sour cream, or black olives when served and it is wonderful.

This recipe kicks major butt.  I love it; so does my son (and two year-olds aren't ecstatic about all that much).  I put shrimp in it for casual company, and it won raves.  Try it!

My family (including my 2 year old) really enjoyed this recipe.  I left out the salt and the tomato sauce so it wouldn't be too tomato-y, and added some cayenne (1tsp). We thought it would be great served with sour cream and enchilada sauce.  One note - the recipe definitely calls for raw rice, not cooked.  For anyone who has had trouble with the rice turning out, you need to make sure the dish is tightly covered when you turn down the heat, and remember that the cooking time is pretty exact.

I was so excited about making this recipe.  I love the flavor but Unfortunately my rice came out uncook.  I must of have done something wrong.  I will try it again.  So I will not rate it until the rice come out right.
