My son loved this!  Made the recipe as instructed, but added a bit of salt and pepper when cooking chicken, and cooked the chicken for less time, as it was already done at 25 min or so.  Next time I would add more raisins, and spice it up a bit more (my husband wanted more spice).  However, my son even wanted the leftovers for breakfast!
