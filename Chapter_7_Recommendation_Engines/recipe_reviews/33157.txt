Thanks for all the reviews; am glad I read them first.  As written, this is only about 3 stars(no spice in the batter for an apple muffin?) but with tweaking became a 5 star and they were delicious...so averaged out to 4 stars.  I shredded 1 cup of the apple to give more even distribution and add moisture throughout and chopped the 1/2 cup.  I also did this first and added the sugar to the apples to help leach out the juice to make the batter not so thick.  I added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg to the batter, and 1/2 cup white, 1/2 cup brown. Used the 1/2 cup butter but also added a couple of heaping tbsp. of applesauce. With that tweaking, just added 1 tsp. vanilla.  These made 6 Texas size muffins and baked up like a picture and were very moist.  The streusel topping is great and if you mix the flour and brown sugar well before adding the butter, you won't get those clumps of brown sugar that cause 'sinkers'.

This is a MUST TRY recipe. Absolutely fabulous. These muffins are so moist, all my cooworkers loved them. So that you do not have to read previous reviewers, these are the most suggested changes to rec, which I also followed: Double the amount of apples ( do half shredded, half chopped), add 1 tsp of cinnamon to dough, do 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar. For strudel topping I melted the butter so that I do not have it that crumbly and it was perfect, did not sink into muffins for sure. Thanks

These is the yummiest muffins I's ever had.  Super simple too.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry ingredients like many of you did - thanks for the tip.  I didn't measure how much apple I used by cups - I just used 2 normal sized apples, grated one and chopped the other.  The grated apple just disappears into the batter.  Next time I make these I will use one grated apple and two chopped apples (don't chop too small.)  I didn't bother using baking apples, just used a red delicious and a gala 'cause that's what I had.  I made the "To Die for Blueberry Muffins" the same day so I just split the topping between the two batches - for me it's too much topping for one batch.  The batter really does come out looking like cookie dough, so don't be afraid that you did something wrong, it's supposed to be like that.  By the way - a tip for getting the muffin out of the pan if you aren't using paper cups, is to use a pineapple knife to get underneath it.  Works great.

WOW!!  Like a lot of people I doubled the amount of apples, added a tsp of cinnamon, and changed the sugar to be half white and half brown....best muffins I have ever had.  I am taking the boys apple picking so I can make more!!  My middle one din't want to bring them to his play date because he didn't want to share them!!!

This recipe looked okay on paper but really didn't work out for me. At all. The muffin batter was very dry and that was after I only put in a cup and a half of flour. The reason I only put a cup and a half of flour in is because after I mixed the wet ingredients together, it was quite obvious there wasn't near enough liquid to moisten two cups of flour. I guessed by looking at the batter with the cup and a half of flour that a half cup of milk might be just enough to moisten the muffin batter enough to actually make muffins. When I made the strudel, it looked fine but when I went to bake it, the mixture bled all over my oven and started a fire. NOT HAPPY. I'm not a baking novice by any means and I do make quite a bit of muffins for my family--this recipe was an absolute flop for me. Not only am I angry that I wasted the ingredients, I now have to scrape the sugar off the bottom of my oven. I really wish I'd thought to read the reviews before I made this one or skipped this recipe all together. Cheers to those who made this recipe and had a success--I did not.

Wow, these are really good.  I also doubled the topping, and put some of it in the middle of the muffins (filled tin 1/2 way, put some topping in, filled rest of way, and finished with topping) and it was out of this world.  Be sure to chop apples in small pieces.  I thought the batter was a bit stiff, but remember that moisture will be released as the apples bake, and they were very moist when finished.  TRY THIS!!

Our family loves these muffins! I make mini muffins with the recipe by adding cinnamon, a little milk if the batter is thick, omitting the crumb topping, and baking for about 15 minutes. Our kids can't get enough of them and enjoy them for snacks and school lunches. I've even made an 8x8 cake with the recipe. I include the topping and bake for abour 30 minutes.

This was a great recipe.  The only change I made at first was to use 1/2 cup of brown sugar in place of 1/2 cup of white sugar.  Baked some muffins.. they were good but a bit bland.. so I added 2 tsp of cinnimon to the batter and a little oatmeal to the struesel.... they were OUTSTANDING!  Everything loved them!

If I could give this a six stars, I would!  This has been a favourite at my B&B all week.  It also packs well for the West Coast Trail visitors that I send off with breakfast.  I like to put the topping in a middle layer and on top. It's best fresh because the aroma from the oven is fabulous, but I admit the leftovers are just fine, too.  Doubling the recipe is the only way to have leftovers!

This recipe is YUMMY!  I added a few things, 1/4c.cinnamon applesauce and some cinnamon to the recipe and cut the butter to 1/4 c.  Also, put part of the topping in the middle.  Although the topping didn't work that well for me, the muffins were still fantastic!  Made them for ladies brunch and can't wait to make them just for my family!  Thanks!

These are to die for! I made two bacthes- On as stated, and one as per reviews. The Review batch is DEFIANTLY the winner! something about the spices added in makes it. I made the following changes : Half and Half for Brown and White sugar, TWO teaspoons vanilla, a teaspoon of cinnamon, a half of a teaspoon of nutmeg, doubled the apples, and grated one whole apple instead of chopping them all. I am giving 5 stars because without this base recipe I would have never found this complete recipe!

These were fantastic! I added about 1 cup Hershey cinnamon chips to batter (love cinnamon) and doubled the topping. I might add 2 c. apples next time. I couldn't really taste them. Maybe it was the kind I used?  Maybe it would help to make a little more moist. These were great! We enjoyed every bite! Thanks Nikki!

Moist! Beautiful to the eye and taste buds. Tweaked recipe based on some prior advice (See below) THANKS!
   Batter:: Double apples (half shredded, half chopped), add 1 tsp of cinnamon to dough, do 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar.  Use 1/2 sugar from batter on apples to make them weep prior to adding to batter.  Batter will be THICK!

   Streudel topping::  Triple it! Partially melt butter before mixing it in to prevent "sinkers" Add topping to CENTER of muffin and TOP.

   Paper cups work. Fill level with top

These did not last in the house! A great apple muffin with a nice topping. Like other, I used half white sugar and half brown and added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter. Overall, this is a wonderful recipe that produces great results!

I made this for my boyfriend and I have to say: I LOVE this recipe. I followed the recipe's directions, but made sure to include the most notable suggestions (1/2c sugar, 1/2c brown sugar; 1/2tsp. cinnamon; 1/4tsp. nutmeg). I was ambitious and used four apples (half shredded, half chopped) which yielded 26 standard-sized muffins. They were done in 15min and were astoundingly moist and delicious. I may tweak and add more cinnamon for my personal preference in the future too.

These are awesome...I'm in culinary school and they say to not use liners when baking muffins because it gives the bottoms of the muffins a thicker denser crust.  Just spray your pans really well

I took the advice of others and grated an apple and chopped another, as well as adding 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. These muffins were fantastic! The flavor was just right, not too sweet, not overpowering in the least. We had them about 5-10 minutes after they'd finished baking and they were divine. Definitely a keeper.

Thanks to all the great reviewer suggestions, I got 5 star muffins with this recipe the very first time.  The changes I made were adding spices (1 tsp cinnamon, 1/3 tsp nutmeg), using half brown & white sugar, & using half shredded/half diced apples.  I also used 2 T. applesauce + 6 T. butter (instead of 8 T. butter).  I peeled too many apples, so I ended up using 3 c. of apples, and I may try using 4 c. in the future.  This is a memorable & tasty apple muffin that I will be making again very soon.

The changes make this a five-star muffin.  Sub 1/2 the white sugar for brown.  Mix with shredded and diced apples first to soak while you prepare the rest.  Add nutmeg and cinnamon and about 1/2 to 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce.  I used two golden delicious apples, about the size of a baseball, and was able to completely omit the vanilla.  Moist, fluffy, sweet. Yum.

I made these with my 3yr old for her class snack tomorrow.  The first one to get one was my husband.  He exact words were, "perfect!".  He also said he wished he had a cup of coffee to go with them.  Okay, I made a double batch.  The dough tastes just like sugar cookie dough that is  thick and sticky.  I used gala apples that are both a bit tart & sweet and contain more juice than granny smiths.  I also chopped the apples up small to get the most juice from them as I combined them with the sugar mixture.  I think chopping is the way to go, because  when you bite into the muffin, you can taste the small chunks of apple.  Amazing taste and moist!  Hope that helps, happy baking :-)

Delicious!  I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 only because I tweaked it a bit.  I took the suggestion of other reviewers and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg, also using 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I used 2 apples, one chopped (Gala) and one grated (Granny Smith).  They tunred out AMAZING.  I made 6 regular sized muffins and 24 mini-muffins.  My husband could not stop raving about them.  These are going to become a staple in my home!

I've seriously made these muffins like 7 times in the past 2 months.  People love them!!  I always make a little more of the topping and definitely use at least 2 apples; don't cut chunks too small!  I think the best kind to use are Golden Delicious.  Have fun with this one; you can't go wrong with it!

fantastic! Made it with apples, craisins (double the amount of the fruit filling) and scattered walnuts on top!!! :) I made it once with peach but my bf prefers the apple/craisins (dried cranberries) better b/c it has a tart taste! :) Made it fat free with free Promise margerine and fat free other ingredients too....also added skim milk 1/2 cup and a few dollops of free sour cream :)

Good muffins.  Mix-in some cinnamon, nutmeg, and honey with the apples first so that the flavor abosrobs into the apples.  They're good even without the streusel topping for a healthier breakfast.

Great starter. Just needed a little tweaking per other reviews. Add some sugar to the apples to help leach out the juice to make the batter not so thick. Added 1 tsp. cinnamon to the batter, and 1/2 cup white, 1/2 cup brown. Used the 1/2 cup butter but also added 1 cup of applesauce. Did not add strudel topping.

I pretty much followed this recipe accurately, though I did add more cinnamon plus some nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice. I made the mistake of turning them into mini muffins. The only reason why this decision was a mistake was because when they're mini you tend to eat more of them. While I had planned on freezing half of the large batch, we had eaten them ALL within about four days. Absolutely no exaggeration. They were amazing.

To make these muffins a little more healthful for my grandchildren, I replaced half the flour with white whole wheat, half the butter with applesauce and the white sugar with Splenda.  Still delicious and down to 167 calories each!

This is a good base recipe. I have to say adding some spices to the filling helps. I added 1tsp cinnamon and  1tsp nutmeg.  Turned out  good

These were great. I used apples that are 'good for sauce' and chopped them tiny. I didn't use any extra apples, it seemed like there were plenty. I did, however, add cinnamon to both the batter and the topping. I also split it up half white flour and half whole wheat flour. The batter was very stiff and the muffins didn't really peak, but that's more of an aesthetic issue than a flavor thing. I didn't have salted butter for my batter, so I used unsalty and added extra salt--about a teaspoon, which is probably more than the equivalent, but it made the muffins more complex and addictive. Very pleased with how they turned out. A little extra liquid might not be bad, it would probably help them peak better. But they really were delicious.

I made these tonight for my husband to take to work for his buddies tomorrow, and he ate 2 of them, and had to restrain himself from eating more.  They are very good, and very easy.  Followed the recipe exactly and did not use paper liners, just greased muffin tin.

I made these muffins this morning and it filled the air with wonderful apple fragrance, perfect for this autumn day!  Better yet, the muffins were very good, lots of apple chunks in every bite.  I took the other reviewers suggestions and added more apple, used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, added cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter and the studel topping.  Because I enjoy nuts, I added some pecans to the batter and the topping also.   While I don't like to alter the recipe too much before I rate it, I do take a few hints from reviewers before making an item.  Don't want to waste my time and good ingredients only to find out it could have been made better.  These muffins are great...4 stars because I altered the recipe.  Enjoy!

these are great.  I did do 1/2 sugar and 1/2 brn sugar.  I also added a touch of nutmeg.  I will double my topping recipes ... it needed a lot more.  maybe even will add another apple to the mix next time.

I made these for my Mommy and baby playgroup. They were perfect for a mid-morning sweet snack. Everybody loved them! I followed the tips from others - shred half of the apples (chop the other half as directed) and add 1 tsp. cinnamon to the batter. Delicious!

I love these muffins because the top is super sweet, but not the muffin itself. I used 1.5 cups of apple shredded, 1 cup chopped, added  1/2 tsp. each cinnamon and nutemeg to batter, and used 1/2 C brown sugar and 1/2 C white.  Add sugar to apple mixture and let it set while you prepare topping - the juiced apples make for even more moist muffins!  Note:  additions make 16 muffins total.  Yay for great recipes!

These muffins are delicious! A little too much apple for me but next time I will cut down on the amount to maybe jusy one medium to large apple, or two small apples. The crust on the top is sooo awesome.

These muffins rank high among the muffins I've tasted- and I've tasted more than a few.  The batter seemed more like cookie dough than batter to me, so I decided to throw in a serving of strawberry yogurt to make it at least a little bit more moist... and they turned out fabulously.  They were moist and the apples were perfect.  I added some cinnamon, too.  Fantastic.  I didn't even bother with the strudel topping.  These taste like an apple coffee cake.  Mmmm.

Butter tends to makes cakes a bit dry, so I added applesauce for more moisture it wasn't enough, next time will try 1/4 cup oil and definitely more apples!!

Pretty good grab and go breakfast.  Definitely put more apples than recommended.  

Has a ton of sugars though...I'd like something a little more healthy...

Made a few minor changes, as these were for the school information sessions (and a healthy request was made)!  I cut the butter by 1/2 then added 1/4 cup applesauce.  I also added 1 cup stone ground wheat flour and 1 cup white.  Lastly, I added a little oats to the streusel  topping for decor!  THese were fabulous!!  Not too sweet, just right!!  I will say though, the recipe just barely made a dozen muffins.  So if you want good size ones, I would increase your amounts!  Thanks!!

WONDERFUL MUFFINS!! I made these the night before my husband went golfing. I let them cool for about an hour on the rack and then placed them in a ziplock bag. They did'nt last long however--his buddies just raved over them and my husband loved them! Very moist and wonderful flavor. Great texture and the struedel topping was not overpowering. I will make these again and again--this recipe has replaced my apple muffin recipe that I have been making for the last 12 years! Thanks for this fabulous recipe!

An Absolute Wonderful Muffin! My husband couldn't get enough of them. As in many recipes at first the batter once incorporated completely did seemingly look a lil' stiff. However, I too not being an novice baker kept in mind that once in the oven, the apples in the baking process releases moisture into the muffins. Thus the ending results are moist beautiful muffins. The young lady Ms. SARAH JO that made this recipe and gave such disgruntled review, I would suggest to you whenever you bake w a crumb topping of ANY type,(TIP): a baker should ALWAYS place a pan lined w baking paper under the muffin pan to catch the possible fallen crumb's. IT'S JUST GOOD COMMON BAKING SENSE. no oven to clean!! And my hats off to the lady suggesting adding crumb mixture to the middle of the muffin. Wow! It was another great alternate way off altering the recipe. However, these recipes are written to be made as written, therefore to the bakers that change the recipe and then complain. I am sorry, but that's not even respectful. We should all enjoy, share & be respectful of one another's accomplishments. If you have true concerns, then use the review as a helping tip guide for other's without criticizing your own added changes to other's recipes. AllRecipes.com is kind enough to give us this forum. I thank them so much. And I thank each and every Cook/Baker for sharing all these incredibly wonderful recipes. My Apron is off to all you. God Bless each of you.

After reading several of the reviews, I made the changes suggested by TUNISIANSWIFE (1C shredded apple, 1/2 chopped, half and half brown and white sugar).  In addition, I used pumpkin spice in the batter and added some caramel (7 oz. caramel candies and 2T heavy cream heated together - I put this into a squeeze bottle and was able to "inject" caramel into the muffins easily and without mess!).
These muffins are very moist and flavorful.  I think if I really liked apple baked goods, this would have gotten 5 stars.  Perhaps I should have waited to review until I heard back from the teachers at my daughters school?  This recipe made 48 mini muffins.

Super moist. Made a loaf, not muffins. Definitely need to add addt'l spices; add oats to strudel for delight! I put the topping on after 15 minutes of baking (to give loaf time to firm) and it was YUM! Did I say super moist?

As written, these are not a five.  I agree with the other reviewers and think that 1 tsp of cinnamon is needed in the batter, use half brown and half white sugar, and the amount of apple should be doubled.  I made mini muffins, so i scaled the recipe down to 3 servings and ended up with 16 bite sized muffins that cooked for about 14 min.  I wasn't as impressed with the topping as some of the other recipes I've tried, so I think i may replace that with one that has more flour to get a better texture.  The muffins turned out moist and full of flavor.  My toddler ate them up!

I gave it 3 stars because if I hadn't followed the advice of some others and made changes these would have been very bland.  I doubled the cinnamon in the topping, used all brown sugar, omitted the vanilla and added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the "batter."   I use quotes because what I had more resembled cookie dough than muffin batter.  I could have rolled it into balls.   Over all these are pretty tasty muffins.  I can see how Granny Smith apples would work well in them.  I used MacIntosh.

These were good - but only fine, not great or amazing as some other reviewers said. I read the reviews first, and made the adjustment of grating some of my apple first. I also added cinnamon and nutmeg for flavor.But mine were pretty dry - and a sticky mess on the pan afterwards from the topping. So in the end for the amount of time and effort, I didn't think they were that great. I'm so surious about why there are different opinions - it makes me wonder if the apple choice makes a big difference. I used Cameo since that was what I had. I also would maybe add yogurt or applesauce to get a moister muffin if I were to make these again.

Made a few adjustments to this recipe.  I don't have muffin tins, so I baked as a cake in a nine by nine inch pan, which was the perfect fit. I had three fairly large Pacific Rose apples so I shredded the first two to applesauce-like consistency and chopped fairly large chunks of the third one so that the muffins tasted more like apples.  I don't think that it would have tasted much like apples without those apple chunks.  The shredded apples just added moisture to the cake.  I put all the chunks of apple in a single layer at the bottom of the dish so that they were spread throughout the cake.  I put a few extra spices in the main cake and doubled the crumble topping; putting a layer in the middle of the cake.  It came out to be very much a spice cake I think would have been delicious with carrots instead of apples as well!

These muffins are superb on their own, but I've tweaked the recipe a bit.

For a little extra nutrients, I substitute 1/2 cup of the white flour for 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour, and then I also about a 1/4 cup of ground Linseed, Sunflower and Almond. To counteract the dryness of the batter, I then add a splash of milk until the consistency is right for muffins. They turn out so nice that way.

I have made this recipe so many times and I have now adjusted it for myself. I also add 11/2 cups of shredded apples. Always add cinnamon to the batter, brown sugar rather than white and whole wheat flour rather than white. These are really good muffins!

I added some spices to the batter because I like apples with spices.  I also reduced the butter and added applesauce, which resulted in a delicious moist apple-y muffin.

I added cinnamon to the batter, and as suggested by some of the other reviewers, I used grated and chopped apples, and used over two cups.  They were really good.  Thanks for the recipe, will be working it in to my regular rotation.

Pretty good! The thermometer has finally dropped and I am now officially in "fall" mode. :) Apples are the perfect fall food and in abundance around here, so I decided to give NMARIEA's recipe a try. I've never really been a a sweet / quick bread fan, but do enjoy noshing on a muffin or large slice of the stuff every now and then. Served with a cup of white chai tea (purchased at a specialty tea shop this past weekend), this was a very special treat to celebrate the approaching season. As TUNSIANWIFE did, I also shredded 1 c. of my (GrannySmith) apples and chopped the remaining half. I used half granulated / half (packed) light brown sugar and added it to my apples to "leech" the juice from them (my batter was pretty thick). I had apple pie spice on hand, so I added 1.5 t to the mix. Some of the apples I shredded in my food processor turned to mush, so I added this to my batter (pretty much 2 T worth, give or take). Finally, I cut back the vanilla to 1 t. NOTE: Be sure to mix your flour / brown sugar crumble topping well BEFORE cutting in the butter (FYI, a wire whisk works great!). This will ensure your topping does not "sink" into your muffins as they cook. Because I made 6 jumbo muffins, I had to bake them for an additional 15 minutes. My hubby's co-workers will be VERY happy to gobble up what I send with him tomorrow! Thanks for sharing, NMARIEA! :-)

Excellent muffins!  I didn't measure the amount of apple I added, I had 3 apples that needed to be used, I shredded 2 and chopped the third.  I also added a heaping tsp of cinnamon to the muffin batter.  I've been asked to make these again soon.

These are wonderful!! I followed some of the other reviewers advice. I doubled the recipe, but only did 1 1/2 cups of peeled and shredded red delicious apples with juice, and 1 1/2 cups of chopped grannie smith (didn't chop it too small or too big). I didn't have brown sugar and just used all white for the recipe, including the topping. I added 2 tsp vanilla and about 1 1/2 tsp of chinese five spice. Other than that I kept the recipe the same as if you were doubling it. Thank you.

These were really good muffins. Moist and flavorful. My toodler even enjoyed them. I grated the apple in my food processor, and like others said, it just disappears into the muffins. I will use more apple next time.

These came out really moist and had a good texture.  I chopped 2 Granny Smiths and also added 1/3 c. of applesauce along with the suggested cinnamon to the batter.  The topping just kind of melted into the muffin top so I think the next time I will make the topping using 1/4 c. of oatmeal to give it more of a topping presentation.  Otherwise I found these to be very good with my minimal tweeks.  Thanks for another keeper.

This was the first time I've ever made apple muffins and they were absolutely amazing. I followed other reviewers tip on doubling the amount of apples and using chopped and shredded. I did add some cinnamon. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

The first time I made this recipe, I followed it exactly. I could hardly taste the apple (I chopped it real small) and it was missing something. Second time, I doubled the apples (1/2 shredded and 1/2 chopped big), added cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter and used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I also added a touch of milk. The taste was much improved and I really enjoyed biting into big chunks of apple. It was almost like apple pie muffins. I used margarine instead of butter for the topping.

These are sooooo delicious!!! I grated the apple and sprinkled the sugar on it and put it in the fridge for 30 minutes to help release juices(which really made the muffins great and added extra needed moisture).

Wonderfully moist and delicious! Used one half brown sugar and one half white sugar and added about 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. Used 3 apples that measured about 2 cups.  Topped each muffin with a pecan.  Baked in 325 degree oven for 25 minutes, this helps to retain more moisture in the muffins. Topped with caramel sauce. Yummy!

These were so good!  They turned out very moist and flavorful.  You can taste the apple pieces and they melt in your mouth!  A couple things I changed are: used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the flour mixture, and I made a topping of 1 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp white sugar, and 1/4 tsp cinnamon and sprinkled it on each muffin.  Also, mine were done in 15 minutes.  I will definitely use this recipe again soon now that apples are in season!

They turned out very moist, but would have loved more flavor!  It was much better when you double the apples and strudel then add to the middle and top.

These are wonderful.  I've only made them when following the advice for adding spices (cinnamon, nutmeg) to the cupcake batter.  I also shred half the apples and chop the other half.

4 stars as written.  I have had these twice now.  They were delicious the first time around but the second time I added 1 tsp. cinnamon to the batter and doubled the topping.  With those changes, they become 5 star muffins that are very moist and flavorful.

I used 2 cups of shredded apples, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 c sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, and I doubled the crumbly topping. Muffins were delicious and a hit with everyone in my family, including those who do not like apples!

I made this for a bake sale we were having at work and sold every one! My husband had one, too, and tried to convince me not to take them away, haha! When I came home from work, he had apples waiting and asked me to make a batch for us, too!

These were absolutely wonderful! I followed another reviewer's suggestions and shredded a cup of apples. I still used a half a cup of chopped apples, and it was the perfect amount of both. The shredded apples gave it great texture and made it so moist you could drown in it. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg for a bit more flavor. My boyfriend couldn't stop raving. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Fantastic! These are moist and delicious. I read previous reviews and used 1/2 brown, 1/2 white sugar in the batter, also doubled the apples; half grated; half chunks (about 4 med-small to make up 3 cups)--next time I might triple the apples. I added 1 1/2 tsp. of vanilla because I love vanilla. Also, definitely add 1 tsp. cinnamon to the studel topping, if you like spice. I used a combo of apples--spry, mac, and wealthy--make sure to use a tangy apple like mac or granny smith in your mix to get a little extra tang. Yummy!

Great recipe! I did change it a bit to make them a tad more healthy. I used half whole wheat flour and used half applesauce in place of half the butter and shredded all the apples as my daughter doesn't like chunks of fruit in her muffins. I also made the changes most reviewers made- half brown sugar/ half white and added cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter. 

I will make these again- they make perfect breakfast muffins to eat on a quick school morning.

Good base recipe for apple muffins.  After reading reviews, I added 1/2 cup of vanilla yogurt (for added moisture), 1/2 tbsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp pumpkin spice, and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I wanted more of an apple spice muffin.  I used 3 granny smith apples, 2 grated and one chopped.  The granny smith hold up when baked.  They keep their apple characteristics and don't turn to sweet mush like other apples tend to.

This is an excellent muffin.  Made it once exactly like the recipe says, and it tasted fantastic.  The second batch I changed to add some pears, some all spice, and to reduce the flour and add some High Fibre Bran to make it a bit more healthy. Tasted fantastic.  This is a very good recipe!

These are wonderful breakfast muffins.  I make these into mini muffins and take them to work.  Everyone gobbles them up so fast.  They're not super sweet and go great with the morning coffee or tea.

This was a good recipe!!! Next time  will add more apples but it was still good. You HAVE to add the cinnamon and nutmeg as recommended by another reviewer (1 t cinnamon 1/2 t nutmeg and I added a shake of ground cloves and allspice). It also came out dry so i had to add another 1/4 cup of water to the batter. The topping is way too wet, I ended up adding some more flour to make it thicker. These were the only changes! This is a GREAT autum muffin recipe, to wake up and have this muffin with your coffee, nothing better! YOu can add just about anything to this...and VERY moist YUM!

Love the idea of putting the crumbs on top.  I added a smushed up over-ripe banana that I had laying around and wanted to get rid of-- I'm glad I did, banana adds moisture and flavor.  Also, ground up some nutmeg and cinnamon.  Pretty darn good treat for Easter Sunday.  To the reviewer that had muffins that turned out dry and hard: you cooked them too long; nothing wrong with this recipe.  Thanks!

After a few bad muffin experiences from this site, I was pleasantly surprised with these!  My husband even snuck a few extras to work so he could be sure to get his "share" !!  
I did substitute half whole wheat flour for half of the white flour, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.
They were even better a few days later and I have to agree with some reviewers that some more apples couldn't hurt!

Wonderful! I was a little worried on how they would turn out, since I made some changes to the recipe. I used 1 ½ cups flour, and a little more than ½ a cup of crushed bran flakes for added fiber. I then used ¼ cup margarine, ¼ cup applesauce (unsweetened) and a heaping tablespoon of sour cream.  I grated the apples and included the juice from them. I then used cinnamon in the flour mixture as previously recommended. They turned out amazing moist, and popped out of the greased muffin pan amazingly! My husband was very impressed as was I!!

I made a few changes to make this recipe healthy, and it was still delicious! Here's what I did: a) replaced half the flour with oat bran b) replaced the butter with applesauce, c) cut the sugar in half, and d) added a teaspoon of cinnamon. Yummy!

Excellent! I added a little nutmeg and ground cinnamon to the batter (didn't measure, just gave a couple shakes). I also added cinnamon chips to half the batter as one reviewer suggested. I did use more cinnamon in the strudel part, probably closer to 1/4 teaspoon (again, I just dumped). I added a little extra apple, maybe another 1/4-1/2 cup which I shredded. I did like having some chunks though as they seem to escape or something as they cook. You can taste but can't see! :). Anyhow these were excellent!

Wished I had the same results as all those who raved.  They baked up beautiful, but I found them a little lacking in sweetness.  I added a little yogurt as someone suggested.  Next time I will put some cinnamon directly in the dry ingredients, omit the yogurt, pump up the sugar in the batter and be very choosy about the apples I use, and add chopped walnuts to the topping.  Be generous with the streusel.  Be sure to put some of it in the middle of the muffin; that was a great suggestion.

I used two medium sized granny smith apples peeled and finely chopped. I used margarine instead of butter.  I followed the advice on adding the topping during the last five minutes of baking.  It seemed a little strange since the muffins were almost cooked.  It was difficult to spread the mixure evenly since it kept rolling off the hill shaped top of the muffin but I did it anyway.  I did not grease and flour my pans I just sprayed with Pam. They did not stick. I used a pan that made six very large muffins. I filled them about 3/4's of the way.   The only part that stuck was the baked on topping but with a thin knife it could easily be chiseled off.  I also followed other review advice and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. These were awesome.  The texture is light moist and fluffy with a slightly crunchy topping.  It tasted a little like cinnamon apple coffee cake.

Mmmmm.... These muffins are so good!  Everyone loves them.  I added extra apple, some grated, some chopped -- it makes the muffins moister.  Putting a bit of cinnamon, maybe 1/8 tsp, in the batter is also great.  The streusel topping is really delicious and adds plenty of sweetness, which I like.  Definitely a keeper.

What a great recipe!!! My husband LOVED it!!! I couldn't find my muffin tins so I made mini loaves instead. I made a few adjustments to the recipe and it turned out wonderfully! I added an extra 1/2 cup of chopped apple, a 1/2 tsp cinnamon, tripled the streusel topping, put half in the middle and the rest on top.(like others suggested). The loaves were very moist and full of apples, and the streusel in the middle and on top made it perfect. I will definitely bake this again!

For some reason, when I made the muffins, the topping melted and burnt all over the place.  But then I made a loaf with the recipe and it turned out fantastic!  (I even had made the loaf, let it cool, wrapped it in aluminum foil and then ziploc bag, and put it in the freezer.  When I took it out, I put it in the oven at 350 for 15 min. or so and it was sensational!)

Please be carefull about the amount of butter the recipe requires. The android app amount is fast less than what the recipe requires if you read the web version. I bet this is the reason it turned out dry for some people and not others. I made it twice. The first time I used the web recipe 5 stars, the second time the app recipe  and 1 star. Perhaps this error can be fixed.

I tried the recipe to bake 33 loaves for our church fall festival. It was a hit! I did substitute the half and half on white and brown sugar. Plus, I chopped the apples and mixed them in with the sugars and vanilla. Meanwhile I prepped the remaining ingredients, the apple sugar mixture becomes juicy. I also added in some cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry mixture, just as recommended by others. Thanks to God, all loaves sold.

They are PERFECT as is. Not overpowering with the apple, moist, and delicious. Perhaps if you wanted a more intense apple flavor you could grate additional apple and add it to the mixture but I don't think you need too. My husband raved about these and your house smells delectable in the process. Thanks for such a great recipe! It's now one of my favorites to use up some of those fall apples. :)

After reading the 1-Stars and seeing how dry they end up, I made a few modifications and they turned out EXCELLENT.

I added a soft banana, a healthy dollop of sour cream (probably 1/4 cup)and a little vegetable oil. I also doubled the cinnamon and added nutmeg to give it more spice. Give it a shot!

five stars with the following changes as suggested by reading the reviews: Double the amount of apples (do half shredded, half chopped), add 1 tsp of cinnamon to dry mix and for the sugar use one half of the amount white and one half brown sugar.

These are by far the best muffins that I've ever tasted! I did change two things though, as I'm vegan. I used dairy-free margarine instead of butter and mashed banana instead of eggs. The topping came out a little odd looking, but tasted great and the muffin- be still my heart. I tasted one and was immediately upset that I didn't make more! I'll be making these again tonight for tomorrow morning! Yum! Thank you for sharing!

Boy I really wanted these to work out because the idea sounded so great. I tried everything! After hearing it was dry, i added additional apple which I chopped small and cooked to a soft consistency with butter and sugar in a pan. I added that to the recipe and tasted the batter.....bland! Then added nutmeg and cinnamon. Bland. Added lemon zest. Ok. Still, to be sure they weren't dry, I added a little extra butter, a few tablespoons of vegetable oil and two more heaping tablespoons of store bought apple sauce. Even added a little caramel on top and swirled them into the muffins. It was a lot of effort for muffins that we're still somehow lacking something in their flavor...and still a little dry! I gave this a 2 instead of a 1 because my Dad thought they were ok...but that was after all my additions. I hate to be the bad guy here, but there are so many wonderful muffin recipes out there, I would go with one that's more of a sure thing,

These are not just the best apple muffins I've ever made, they are the best MUFFINS I've ever made. I know the recipe is so simple, but everything comes together so deliciously. One little tip that I always do when I make something with a strudel top, I lightly mist the cupcake tin before I put the liners in, that way any sugary overspill doesn't stick like the dickens.

I did read reviews and meant to add cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter, but forgot! And yeah, it was a pretty bland muffin, even with extra cinnamon in the streusel topping. Also, I tripled the recipe because I had a lot of apples to use up and so I could freeze some for later, but instead of getting 36 muffins like I planned on, I got 42 regular-size, PLUS 42 mini muffins! I used every pan I had! But that's fine, my kids love muffins and will be glad to have them for later. In tripling the recipe, I first peeled and cored the apples then put them in the food processor. After each batch I put them in a measuring bowl and stirred in 1/4 c. white sugar, to leech the juice out, as another reviewer suggested. I ended up with about 5 c. apples for a triple batch. I put only 3/4 c. white sugar in with the apples. Then I creamed  1/2 c. butter, 1/2 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown sugar (cut the sugar way back). To that I added 1/2 c. oil, 1/2 c. applesauce, the eggs and vanilla. Then I mixed in the dry ingredients and folded in the apples. I added abt 3/4 c. oats to my streusel topping (for the triple batch: 1 c. brown sugar, 3 T. flour, 3/4 tsp. cinnamon, 3/4 c. oats and 3 T butter). There was enough streusel for the 42 reg. muffins but not the minis. By then I had realized there were no spices in the batter, so before scooping out the mini muffins I added cinnamon, nutmeg and a little allspice to the batter. They have a lot more flavor and I will definitely add those next time!

Read the reviews as always - changed the sugar to 1/2 brown and 1/2 white. Added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. Used 1 cup shredded apples and 1 cup chopped. Even with these adjustments I found them to still be lacking flavour. Next time I will try adding more apples and cinnamon. And the topping didn't really turn out for me either, I will use a different kind.

Thank you to every one who reviewed this and gave suggestions on how to make it better.  The muffins are amazing.  I did use 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and also 1/4 tsp cinnamon and nutmeg in the batter.  My son wants me to put icing on them and call it dessert.

Good muffins...I used half white sugar and half brown sugar in the batter and added cinnamon (1 tsp.) and nutmeg (a few sprinkles).  I think more spices (allspice, cloves) could be added to make the muffins even better.  Perhaps I might add raisins too, but then that changes the recipe too much.

An easy to make and good tasting muffin but recipe as written has no real WOW factor.  Made these to use up some apples I had.  Needs more cinnamon I think to really make them sing.  They are a solid muffin as is but just need a pinch more pizzaz to make them fantastic

There is in NO way enough liquid to make these. Ended up having to add about 2/3 cup of milk to get to muffin batter consistency. Taste was okay, not a wow kind of muffin. Second batch, I doubled, used 1/2 cup butter, 3/4 cup applesauce with cinnamon, and about a cup to 1 1/3 cup of milk. Made a GREAT muffin.. especially without the topping.

I got worried when my batter was really, really dry and for a moment almost wanted to add some milk into it. It seemed like a good decision to have not! I guess the suggestion to add sugar (and cinnamon) to the chopped (and shredded) apples did make juices to leach out! They turned out so moist!

Great taste!  I made some of the changes other reviewers recommended.  Added 1 teaspoon cinnamon to the batter, split the sugar 1/2 and 1/2 brown and granulated, and added one snack cup of applesauce to the batter along with shredding all the apple.  Baked up quickly and beautifully!

This is a great recipe but with changes is is extra great! I use White whole Wheat flour and replace the butter with Applesause, added a tsp. of Cinnimon and a 1/2 tsp of Nutmeg. I use over 2 cups of apples 1/2 grated and 1/2 chopped. Also I used 1/2 cup raaw sugar and 1/2 cup packed brown sugar. The batter IS very thick but the apples add moisture so no need to do anything different just follow the recipe! The struddle topping is good but I added a sprinkling of Oats to make it go farther as the recipe made 16 muffin's with the extra apples. My family loves these every time and I am making them for a school dinner as I write! Happy Cooking ;)

These were really good; I got compliments at the Christmas party I brought them too. Many eaten, even though I made about 36 (I had doubled recipe). Just right amount of topping exactly. However, if you didn't bite into a part with the apple, it was a bit dry. I think adding yogurt/sour cream might increase the moist factor and will try next time I make. A definite keeper tho! Thank you!

Good consistency, but not as flavorful as other muffin recipes I've tried from this site.  Actually added A LOT of spices - 2 teaspoons cinnamon, 1 teaspoon nutmeg, and 1.5 teaspoons vanilla extract to the batter, and all 3 spices in the topping as well.  Disagree with other reviewers saying to double the apples - 2 large apples is plenty to get apple chunks in every muffin.  I substituted 1/4 cup butter with 1/4 cup apple sauce instead, which turned out great- did not affect the consistency / moistness at all.  So try the last tip as an easy way to cut some calories!

My rating is a little inaccurate because I am rating these muffins with the changes I made. I followed some of the other reviews, particularly,  TUNISIANSWIFE,   and my muffins turned out amazing.  I shredded 1 cup of the apples and chopped the other ½ cup. I added 1 teaspoon cinnamon and ½ teaspoon nutmeg to the batter.  I also added 1 child’s snack size cinnamon applesauce to the batter.  The muffins turned out decadent and moist.  I had to turn my kids away after 2 large muffins.  I will make these again and again.

I had to add about 1/4c milk to thin the batter so I could stir in the apples.  I also found the batter rather plain so I added 1tsp ground cinnamon and 1/2tsp ground nutmeg.  I then left the cinnamon out of the crumb topping.

We loved these! I will be making them again. Even my kids wanted seconds, and thirds. I used half white flour and half whole wheat flour and decreased the sugar to 1/2 C.  I chopped up two small apples in small chunks. The topping was way good. Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic! Cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup white and 1/3 cup brown, cut the butter to 6 TBLS, used one medium apple grated and one medium apple chopped, and totally left off the struesel topping, and they are still fantastic! I'll definitely be making these again and again.

These were yummy! I did add some cinnamon to the batter and decreased the sugar to a total of 2/3 (1/3 cane sugar and 1/3 brown). I did find that the topping ran off the muffins while baking..maybe need more flour, less butter??...will experiment with other reviewers suggestions on this one...overall a tasty treat that everyone enjoyed! =)

these were better than i thought they were going to be. i hadn't noticed that there was no liquid in the recipe until the batter was mixed, and i very nearly added some milk. i'm glad that i didn't, but the batter really is more like that for a drop cookie than a muffin. (maybe i'll try these as cookies sometime!) i added about 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to the batter, along with 1/2 c. finely chopped pecans, and i used granola instead of the crumb topping - much quicker, and guaranteed to be crunchy!

Though the batter looks very dry before baking it has the right moisture and texture in the end. I did add 3/4 cup more apple and 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves. I omitted the topping, so I  mixed the cinnamon in the batter. Just perfect!

Great!  Made quite a few modifications.  Used half whole wheat flour, half brown sugar, added 1/4 milled flaxseed, 1/4 cup apple butter, an extra 1/2 cup of shredded apple, and added 1 t. cinnamon and 1/2 t .nutmeg.  I omitted the topping completely.  Didn't need it in my opinion.

Loved this recipe, but next time I will try to make it a bit healthier.  264 calories is a lot for a little muffin.  I followed the recipe for the most part but followed some suggestions by adding 1/2 C shredded apples, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp. nutmeg.  I also increased the flour to 2 Tbsp for the strudel topping.

Yummy muffins, but made a few changes: used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar; doubled the apples (shredded half, chopped half); doubled the topping and put 1/2 in the middle of the muffins (ie: filled muffin cup half full, spooned in some topping mixture, filled the muffin cup, then topped each muffin with more topping); and added 1tsp. cinnamon.

Even after adding a teaspoon of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg to the muffins, they seemed a little bland.  I think next time I'll add more cinnamon and nutmeg, as well as substitute oil for some of the butter to make it more moist and less dense.

Excellent! I followed the more common suggestions( chopped and shredded apples, 1/2t nutmeg and 1t Cinnamon on batter) and they turned out great! for those of you that love to eat batter rather than cook it, this is the way to go! I made 1 batch but accidently chopped and shredded about 2x as many apples for 1 recipe so I made another match and cooked it in a bread pan. Havn't tried it yet, but it looks just as yummy. Cooked it for about 40 min at the same temp. Will make again!

Great recipe as is.  The batter is thicker than a normal muffin batter, but I just used a large cookie scoop to scoop and then drop it into my muffin tins.  That allowed the crumble topping to bake into the sides of the muffin as the batter baked and settled down from the scoop shape (which caramelized as it baked!).  I doubled the whole recipe and ended up with 36 muffins.  I did end up making some extra strudel topping (my family's CRAZY over crumble toppings!) but it was still not overly-sweet; just right!  These are yummy straight out of the oven, but are also super-delicious the next day (if they make it that long!)

Wow!  I am a muffin lover and when I was too lazy to make pie crust for a bag of apples that was a lil on the ripe side I decided to look for an apple muffin recipe.  This one is amazing!  I followed a few reviewer modifications such as the 1/2 brown and white sugar and the extra cup and a half of shredded apples which I let sit in cinnamon and honey for an hour before using.  I also did half white and half whole wheat flour to make them a litlle healthier.  They are moist and definitely a hit with my fussy family!

I just peeled, cord, and shredded an entire apple for these muffins (Seriously, cannot be bothered to measure the shredded apples) and got worried for a moment because it seemed like a 1:1 ratio of batter and apple! I shrugged and put them in the oven anyway. They turned out fine- they were very soft and moist, mildly sweet, I actually tasted a bit of apple in the muffin, possibly due to the overbearing amount of apple that was in it. Changes I made: 2/3 cup of whole wheat flour, 1 and 1/3 cup of white flour, 1/2 cup of white sugar, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and vanilla. Next time I'd use a whole tsp each of cinnamon and vanilla, these guys need more flavour. But definitely a good way to use up some apples. Oh and no streusel on top- I find it always makes everything too sweet so I just pressed a pecan on the top before baking, for decoration. It cannot hurt to fill up the muffin cups all the way to the top, and maybe even a bit more, as they didn't rise much.

I followed some advice from others : went 1/2 + 1/2 with brown sugar, added 1 tsp. cinnamon + 1 tsp. nutmeg, changed to 1/4 cup butter + 1/4 cup applesauce (which worked out quite well).  I shredded 1 apple, and chopped 2 grannysmiths.  Added a little oats to the topping.  I did 1/2 batter, 1/2 topping, then repeated, but it was more of a pain, so next time I think I'll do it without that step.
  With these minor changes these were quite tasty and nice and moist!

OMG, I wish I could share the aroma of these muffins while they're baking. Just awesome. One of the secrets to success is to use good ingrediants ~  real butter, not oleo, and use real vanilla. I used a spatula to fold in the flour mixture, think it took 24 folds to get it all incorporated. I baked 6 big Texas-size muffins, baking time was just about 27/28 minutes. The family devoured them as soon as they were cool enough to remove from the pan.

This recipe has great potential. However the 2 Cups of flour is too much. And agreed with other readers that there's no spice too it...I will probably try again, with the modifications from another reader, but was dissapointed at how dry they turned out. :(

I made some slight adjustments, most of which have been mentioned before: I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all-purpose flour, added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp nutmeg to the dough, and grated rather than chopped the apples. They turned out absolutely delicious!

I did add cinnamon and nutmeg. I also added about three cups of apples. 1/2 the apples chopped and 1/2 shredded. These are soo good.

I expected a little more flavorful muffins, they were OK. I think next time I'll add more apples in the mix, maybe cinnamon in the apple mixture as well. The topping could have used more white sugar and butter.

This is the best muffin I've ever had, baked, bought, ever.    Thanks for the tips in the comments.  Cinnamon and nutmeg in the batter are a big plus (though I didn't try them without it, so can't really compare the two).  I changed the serving size to make 18, and it made 24 regular sized and 8 mini muffins.  There was the right amount of topping.  Also, I used 3 apples-2 chopped with a quick chopper, and one grated.  Fabulous!

It's a very dry almost cookie like batter.  I will grate at least one of the apples and chop the other apple very small but the taste is excelent.

this recipe is awesome I give it 5 stars with the additional changes I made, otherwise they would have been a little bland and only 3 stars.. I added 2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, 1/4 cup sour cream, 1 tsp baking powder,  double the apples, and 1/2 cup brown and white sugar. My family loved them and they sucked them all up within hours! super delicious!

As always READ THE REVIEWS!!! Thank you everyone who wrote your changes. I listened to a lot of reviews that suggested using half brown sugar instead of all white, to add cinnamon and spices, and to add more apples. They came out WONDERFULLY! I diced up 2 smaller apples and chopped a 3rd one, added half of the sugar and spices (about 2 tsp. cinnamon, then some nutmeg, cloves and ginger to taste) to the apples and let them sit in the 'frige overnight before making these muffins. I also added a bit more flour to the crumb topping mixture, close to 4 Tbsp. instead of 1 Tbsp. My family loved them and I get to say they're somewhat healthy with the apples in them!!! Oh, by the way, with letting the apples sit overnight in sugar and spices first, it pulls out the juice and softens the apples. I poured all the juices in to the batter too, and it was far from dry for me. The second time I made these, I didn't let them sit as long, there was less juice in the bag, the apples were stiffer chunks, the batter was more dry, and the muffins also had a dryer texture... Not sure if it's coincidence yet.

Oh my gosh, NMARIEA these are so good!  They are WAY better than my normal apple muffins, much lighter and fluffier...exactly what I wanted.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, it will replace my old apple muffin recipe!  The only thing I changed was to use 3/4 C. white sugar and 1/4 C. packed brown in the muffin mix because I ran out of white sugar.  Next time I will use the full cup of white.  Couldn't get better, thanks again!

Very good.  Added nutmeg and cinnamon (about 1 tsp cin & 1/4 tsp nutmeg) and chopped just one apple (should have doubled it!), and it was pretty moist.  I'll be making this again.

Turned out really well!  I did add a few things...I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the batter along with a few shakes of apple pie spice...I also added 1/4 cup sour cream because another reviewer had noted that the muffins were dry...Of course, I doubled the topping!

Great muffin. I used the suggestions of the 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar, used 1 1/2 cups chopped apples and 1 1/2 cups shredded apple.  I also added: 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/4 tsp. cloves and a little over 1/4 cup chopped walnuts. I melted the butter for the streusal topping and added in a little oatmeal.  my hubby very rarely raves over muffins, but, he loved this one.

Very good muffin.  Used 2 apples, added 2 tsp cinnamon to the dry ingredients,  2 tablespoon milk, 1/2 cup raisins and sprinkled the batter with sugar/cinnamon mixture. Very yummy.... Made 12 big muffins.  Baked for 25 minutes.

These were delicious! I made them yesterday, kept them covered in my cake plate and had them for breakfast this morning. So yummy! I used two apples and I chopped them in fairly decent-size chunks. I like to bite into the apple, not just have the flavor of shredded apple. Will definitely make them again!

There is nothing healthy about these muffins!  I tried them even though I knew they were not healthy from the recipe because of all the great reveiws.  They are so sweet, all I could taste was sugar.  I did use some review hints, such as using 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, adding 1/2 tsp of cinnamin and 1/8 tsp of nutmeg.  I meant to add oats to the topping as one review suggested and forgot.  THey wre very time consuming to make.  The topping was nice a crunchy the first day, but after storing them overnight, they became soggy and wet on top.  I will look for a healthier alternative since I am eating for 2 and have two small boys that eat them!

DONT PANIC! Yes the batter is thick, but these muffins turn out great. Quite the opposite of some other muffins I love to make where the batter is so runny! They are a little drier than expected. I used 2 cups of apples. I also added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/4 tsp. cloves to the recipe. And added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg to the topping recipe. Served great with tea!

Muffin Heaven!! I love this recipe because of its simplicity and "dump and stir" method. Just used a wooden spoon and some elbow grease. Don't overmix or your muffins will be tough and chewy. I used half brown, half white sugar and added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter. Since cranberries are fresh in the store right now I am looking for excuses to use them! I added about 1/2 cup fresh cranberries but left them whole. When you chop them up for muffins they color everything pinkish. To reduce some of the fat I used half the amount of butter called for in the recipe and substituted unsweetened apple sauce to make up the rest. Another reviewer suggested grating one apple and chopping the other so I did that with my Granny Smiths. Baked for about 25 minutes at 375 and the result was amazing! Light, fluffy and not overly sweet. The cranberries added a nice fresh zip while the apples were perfect..not too wet inside like with some other apple muffin recipes. Thank-you for sharing this recipe!!

Well...many of the reviews were right about one thing, they were Very dense. I guess because there is no oil in the recipe? I grated a cup of apples and chopped the other half cup and that's the only changes I made so I know it wasn't anything I did differently. Anyway, the smell of them cooking was amazing and the topping was awesome but they were way too chewy and hard to bite through in my opinion. I got some compliments on them but I noticed that everyone was drinking a lot of juice while eating these muffins! LOL

These were great!  To make them a little healthier, I substituted ¼ cup applesauce for half of the butter.  I also substituted ½ C brown sugar for white and added a little cinnamon and nutmeg.  They were easy to make and very tasty.

Fantastic muffins.  The recipe does not call for any spices, so I lowered it a star.  I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cloves, and 1/4 tsp chai spice blend (its a McCormick gourmet spice blend -- very yummy).  I also substituted 1/3 of the white sugar for brown sugar.  I used a mini muffin pan, so I chopped the apples (1.5 gala apples) into smaller pieces.  I also only baked for 8 minutes.  It made 36 mini muffins.    Usually I like to put butter on my muffins, but these were so good I ate them plain!  These will definitely be a favourite.  Thanks! :O)

This recipe turned out awesome! I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown like other people suggested and grated some apples and used some chunks and it was great. Next time I would use more of the topping because I would enjoy it crunchier but overall superb!

I gave this a 4 because I found it was a little dry, and added some homemade applesauce (from the same batch of apples). The combination of a particularly nice harvest and a great recipe, everyone loved these! I sent them to friends out of town for the holidays and everyone raved and asked for the recipe.

These are even better the second or third day, they are so moist and delicious.  I grated about a cup of the apple and chopped the rest.  Wonderful.

Dangerous! Followed suggestions of other reviewers (Shredding most the apples / half white, half brown sugar / A few globs of applesauce / a touch of oil / spice! / doubled crumb topping / and: I added a little more vanilla) Used Honeycrisp apples.  Penzey's Apple Pie Spice, more cinnamon, more nutmeg, a bit of All Spice.  Officially my *new* favorite muffin.

AWESOME muffins! I took the advice of others I made a few changes. First, I shredded most of the apples. Next,I used half brown sugar and half white sugar, which I mixed in with the apples to bring out some of the juices. To this mixture I also added a couple heaping tablespoons of apple juice concentrate. Lastly, I added some cinnamon to the muffin batter. The results were delicious! I'm rating this recipe 4 stars because of the changes I made. However, they make this recipe is a keeper for sure!

I only gave this recipe 3 stars because, like other reviewers before me, I had to make some additions of my own. I couldn't find muffin cups, so I made a coffee cake and it turned out perfect. I added about 1 C fresh apple cider, cut both the apples into small chunks (I think I'll try grating one next time), and added 1 t cinnamon and 1/2 t nutmeg. I left off the topping because I was going to be serving it with pumpkin butter. Next time I might do 1/2 C brown 1/2 C white sugar, and maybe applesauce in lieu of butter to cut down that fat content.

All in all, these muffins would be 3-star if you just followed the recipe, but adding a little liquid and some spices makes bumps them up to 5.

These are the best muffins I have ever had!  Changes I made: added a teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg to the dry ingredients.  I used Egg Replacer and margarine instead of eggs and butter to make these vegan.  I added 2 tablespoons of pumpkin butter to the wet ingredients, following the suggestion to make them moister.  I used two small/med sized apples and chopped big chunks.  I greased the muffin pan well with veg oil and had NO problem getting them out.  Made 12 muffins.  SOOOOOO GOOD!

Very moist.  The kids loved them.  (this was my review two years ago)  I made these this morning and couldn't understand why it has taken me two years to make them again.  So yummy.  I grated 2 apples and cut one, next time will even cut more into the batter.  Next time I will also add cinnamon to my batter.

These just did not turn out well.  They were not moist and fluffy.  The centers caved in and they were very flat.  We ate a few and tossed the rest.  I would rather have Betty Crocker muffins from a box than these.

These were delicious!!!!  I made them last night to bring with me to work, and the guys hounded them!  I did use applesauce in place of the butter, 2 cups of honeycrisp apples - coursely chopped, a handful of cinnamon chips were added to the batter along with a dash of cinnamon and I used more cinnamon than called for in the topping.  I had one straight out of the oven and thought they were good - this morning, however, they were EXCELLENT!  As the sit, the topping does sort of soak into the muffins.  By far the best muffins I have made to date.  Thank you - this will come in handy each and every fall season as the apples are abundant.  UPDATE: I have to mention, that one co-worker in particular, while leaving the office this afternoon, BEGGED me for the rest of these muffins to bring along with him on a road trip with his friends.  I took it as a very nice compliment - especially since, my baking really leaves a lot to be desired!!!!!

These are AWESOME MUFFINS!!  I made a double batch and it made oodles of muffins!  I grated half the apples and chopped the other half (total of 4 cups for a double batch), added about 2 tsp cinnamon to the batter, added 1/4 cup milk, added a full tablespoon vanilla, and used melted butter.  It was a big hit with my family and my son's kindergarten class!

These muffins were moist and delicious! I did glance over some of the reviews and tweaked the recipe. Rather than using 1 cup of white sugar, I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of light brown sugar. I also added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter. When I went to make the muffins, I realized I only had a cup of butter left and I love crumb toppings so I ended up using just 7 tablespoons of butter. As for the apples, I used 2 gala apples, chopping most of it into small squares and some of it into smaller shreds. I ended up with 12 medium-sized muffins and had I had more butter at hand, I would've increased the streusel topping recipe so that I could add some in the middle of the muffins. The only disappointment I have is that the tops did not rise very much but this recipe is definitely a keeper (my dad tried one and commented that they were pretty good and he normally isn't one for baked goods...in fact, he had one for breakfast the next day and took TWO to work with him)! Next time, I might try substituting all or some of the butter with applesauce for a healthier version. And might I add that  aroma that fills the kitchen as these bake is WONDERFUL - an awesome bonus!

Excellent!  I also substituted apple sauce for half the butter, added cinnamon and more apples, and I also added some nutmeg. When I make them again I will add a little more apple sauce as well as more cinn/nutmeg.  But I will make them again!

Loved this one and so did hubby. I do believe they make more than 12 muffins, the first set came out with flat tops, so next time around I made 16 and they were perfect.

These are very good!  I will definitely add more apples next time.  The only time you get the taste of apple is when you get a piece, and I think that should be in every bite!  Otherwise, these are great.  Will make again for sure!!  :)

this recipe is a HUGE fave with me & my hubby. i add about double the apples it calls for or i add in 2 bananas on top of the 1 1/2 cups of apples. it makes the muffins A LOT moister than the original recipe! and i also like to make a little extra topping! other than that i keep everything the same and they always turn out great! :)

I got rave reviews after making these muffins for breakfast.  This is a great recipe, worthy of 5 stars when eaten right out of the oven (when the topping is still crispy and almost like praline candy).  After a few days, the cinnamon topping gets a tad soggy, so if you don't plan on eating these right away, I would make the recipe without the topping.  The muffin itself is sweet, but not too sweet, and the chunks of apple give a nice textural contrast.

I made two changes due to previous reviews.  I added 1 tsp cinnamon to the batter, and I used brown sugar instead of white.  I found I needed to add a splash of milk to lighten it up a little.  I made a double recipe to make 18 large, beautiful, high topped muffins.  And for the taste... FANTASTIC!!  I'll test them for doneness a little sooner, as they are just a tiny bit dry.  My fault on that, though.  Great recipe, Nikki, thank you!!!

Delicious! However I will make one suggestion, definitely try doubling this recipe and make 12 jumbo-sized muffins.  I made these muffins for the first time right now, doubled the recipe, and they came out perfect! Not only do they taste great, they look great too! Everyone loved them. Also, dont think about omitting the strudel topping, the topping is the best part!

This was a nice sweet muffin. Instead of chopping the apples I grated them. I did not have a problem with these being dry. I also added cinnamon to the batter for a little extra flavor. These were a hit!

Very simple to make, delicious when warm, and tastes even better the next day, if there are any left.

These muffins are very good but they are way too dry.  There's no way that it takes 20 min. for them to bake at 375.  I think that's one of the main reasons why they are so dry because they were very overdone.  I would probably check them after about 15 min. next time, maybe even sooner.

I made these as a welcome gift for our new neighbors, and kept one for my husband to try.  He demanded I make another batch right then, and ate 2 more while I baked the second batch.  The texture of the batter worried me since it was thicker than most, but the results were fluffy and flavorful!

yum! I just made these to send to my sons preschool for snack...I "healthied" them up a bit by substituting applesauce for the butter, and egg substitute in the muffin batter. Kept the topping as is. Made these in mini muffin pans, got 34 muffins, baked for about 17 minutes.

These are the best muffins I have ever had.  I replaced the butter with cinnamon applesauce, sprinkled some of the topping inside the muffins and added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter as suggested by other reviewers.  I make a batch almost every weekend and I have no intention of stopping any time soon!

These muffins are amazing, a little messy to eat. and it took a while more than 20 minutes to make because i am only 17 and not yet great in the kitchen. i used an apple peeler corer slicer to get the apples nice and small, it only took about 2 minutes for that. they tasted so great!

These were pretty good.  I added about 1 tsp of cinnamon to my flour mixture, and got  very yummy apple cinnamon muffin out of it.  I also used more apples than called for, and was a little worried when I saw the batter. It looked like I as going to be baking cookies in a muffin tin, but the end result was very nice.

Not that this recipe needed any more reviews, but WOW, this was great.  I did use half the butter and substituted 3.9oz (a snack size cup) of applesauce.  My topping didn't turn out that great, but that didn't matter that much to the taste of the muffins!

These were really good! I made them last night because i had apples no one really felt like eating. I didnt have much butter or shortning, so i used half a cup of apple sauce and a few teaspoons of margarine. The hardest thing in this recipe was peeling, coring and chopping the apples! Thanx Nikki!!!

These were great! I added cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves to the batter and substituted half the sugar for brown sugar to make it more interesting. The batter did seem dry so I added about 1/3 cup yoghurt.

Big hit!  Made these to go with Asparagus Chicken and Salad for daughter's birthday dinner.  Used paper liners, 2 cups of chopped apple and 1/4 cup cinnamon applesauce in batter, as previously suggested.  Moist and delicious!  I did get about 15 muffins, maybe due to additional ingredients mentioned above. Either way, they were great.  Hubby took remaining 4 to work the next day to enjoy for coffee break.  Thanks Nikki for this keeper recipe.

These are going into my recipie box.  Very moist and yummy.  I only had 1/2 a stick of butter, so I used 1/4 cup Crisco in with the butter. I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  The batter was thick like cookie dough, but I went with it anyways. The batter almost completly filled the muffin tins, they came out plump and wonderful.

A good easy recipe. I added a sprinkle of cinnamon to the batter. I think I may add a little applesauce next time to make the muffins a little more moist.

I enjoyed these when I made them.  I would recommend adding more apples if you like.  I thought I put in too many at first, but it's as if they disappear after baking.  I would make these again.

Husband came home with a bushel of apples.  Made this in a small loaf pan, doubled the crumb topping and added half in the middle of the loaf.  Took it to work and it was gone in a half an hour.  Needless to say I have to bring another one tomorrow.  The best fall bread you have ever had!  You must try this.

Everyone loved these muffins.  Well, I thought they were okay, and my dad wouldn't try any because he's on a diet, but everyone else raved about them.  I did what the reviewer said and put extra topping into the middles.  They turned out nice and big.

Great recipe Nikki! Very moist. I added the topping ingredients "into" the mix & also "on top", like Holly suggested. Also I added chopped pecans. Even my wonderful husband, who thinks ALL recipes must have chocolate in them to be good, loved these muffins. For easier clean-up I used cupcake liners. A+ on this one!

I love this recipe, though i agree that it needed tweaking.  I followed it to a tee and decided the batter was way too dry to try and bake as it was so I added about 1/3 cup of apple butter and a few Tbsp of apple juice.  They came out perfect! My two littlest didn’t like the chunks of apple, but my friend and my oldest daughter loved them as much as I did. I’m trying it in a basic bundt pan right now at 350F for more of a coffee cake instead of muffins.  I’m wondering if my kids would like it better next time if I grate the apple.

They came out very soft and very good everybody loved them but I only added
1 1/2 cup of flour instead of 2 cups of flour.
I also added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter.

Loved this recipe. I only changed a couple things. I added a little sugar and lemon juice to the chopped apples and mixed them with my hands, smashing them up. I added a tsp if cinnamon and a half tsp nutmeg to the batter. And a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to the crumble mixture as well

I actually made these muffins twice.  The first time I followed the recipe as it is listed.  The muffins came out kind of dry (over baked) and didn't have much flavor.  

The second time, I used the same basic recipe, which is very easy by the way, and I added 1/2 cup more apple pieces (next time I will add even more) and I also added about two tablespoons of cinnamon and one tablespoon of nutmeg.  My family enjoyed the second batch so much more - they said that the muffins "tasted like Fall".   The second batch I also tried what someone else mentioned - instead of one cup of white sugar, I used 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar to coat the apple pieces.  Then I added 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar to the eggs and butter.  I baked at 350 rather than 375 for 20 minutes. Overall, this is a very good recipe.

These were tasty. Grated the apples, equal parts brown and white sugar, 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and I added in a handful of soaked raisins. The kids like them!

With the mix that you sprinkle over the muffins before you put them in the oven, I added 1 tbs. of brown sugar to the amount the recipe said, and I added 1/2 a tbs. of white sugar just because my family loves sweets. After they came out of the oven, I had one and they were delicious! I honestly would have even added more cinnamon, just for more flavor. But great recipe!

I made 1/2 the recipe to try it out and loved it.  I made it as written, except adding 1/4 cup raisins (soaked and drained) with the apples.  The muffins are moist and flavorful and I will make it again.

Fabulous muffins!  I followed the advice of earlier reviewers and made the suggested changes -- more apple, half shredded and half chopped, half brown and half granulated sugar, and I added nutmeg and cinnamon to the batter.  I also melted the butter when making the topping. This muffin has quickly become a household favorite.  Enjoy!

Yum yum yummy!!!! Made these without the topping, but added walnuts to the batter—husband and I ate them up so quick! Using Granny Smith apples helped preserve a little tartness to counter the sweet. Perfect balance! Some of the BEST apple muffins I have ever had!

Amazing with modifications, as suggested by other users. Instead of 1 cup white sugar, I used half brown. Did 1.75 cups shredded apples plus 1/2 cup diced. When you get to the topping, mix the brown sugar and flour together well before cutting in the room-temp butter. Then the brown sugar doesn't sink in. I also used whole grain flour. It was great!

This recipe is amazing!! I changed the original quite a bit so that's y only 3 stars. I wanted a healthier muffin so I did 1 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup honey instead of sugar. I listened to the other reviews and added about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I used macintosh apples n it ended up being about 2 cups. I shredded half of them. I also used oil instead of butter because I like a heavier muffin. Next time I think I'll add a bit of milk yet too. Like maybe try a 1/4 cup. I ended up only having time to mix up the dough before I left home so it sat in the fridge for a few hours. When I got home I baked them and wow! They're fabulous!! My only complaint is that they're a teeny bit dry but I think that's cuz of the whole wheat flour and also I might have over baked them a bit. I would definitely recommend this recipe tho. Thanks a lot for sharing

More than excellent.  i was worried while mixing this up as the batter was so thick.  So I looked up the recipe and watched the video.  I originally found this recipe on "spend with pennies".  The video showed a very thick batter, so I continued, and baked two muffins first as a test.  They were great.  I doubled the recipe but not the apple.  I did add about 1/4 cup of milk, and some cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter, but not much. My oven is a bit slow, so it took about 22 minutes to bake these muffins.  My husband fell in love with them.  They have a rich, buttery texture and marvelous taste.  I told him next time i would double the apple, but he does not want me to change a thing about the recipe.  I shall be making these again.  P.S.   My sister gave me a Kitchenaid stand mixer for Christmas.  Lucky me.  My old mixer would not have mixed up this batter, but the Kitchenaid had not trouble whatsoever.                                                                    I just made this recipe for the second time.  WOW.  Again I doubled the recipe but did not add any liquid.  I used four cups of apple, shredding half, dicing half.  Added cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter.  Baked for 21 minutes.  Wonderful.   The first batch were a little heavy but very tasty.  This batch was PERFECT !!!!!!!  I need to get more apples.

The end result was perfect! With some minor adjustments. I added spices (1/2tsp cinnamon and 1/4tsp nutmeg) to the muffin mixture already as I prefer them with more spices, however like others have mentioned the batter was far too dry. If I had known this would happen earlier I would have grated half of the apple and this would have solved the problem however I had already mixed the batter. I didn't have any applesauce on hand so chose to add a whole mashed banana and I'm very glad I did! They turned out perfectly moist and delicious. Would definitely make again with the same adjustments.

I have done it twice and loved it. A couple of small changes- cut the sugar part in half and used only brown sugar and couple of shots of liquid stevia sweetner. Ended up perfectly sweet. It seems it  would have been too sweet for us in the original recipy. Also decreased the flour quantity to 11/2 cups but more than doubled the apples quantity. I added a lot to cinemon both to the dry and wet mixes. Cinemon gives a great taste and wonderful aroma. Bottom line- it tastes great and is really easy to do.

The original recipe was ok, instead, I started by combining the sugar and butter for 2 minutes then add eggs one at a time, then vanilla. Slowly add in flour mixture alternating with between 1/4-1/2C milk and folding in the chopped apples. I also folded in about 1/2 Tbsp cinnamon into the batter.

Mine came out great! They were very moist. I brought them into work and they were all gone in less than an hour. Everyone raved about them.

I veganized the recipe by substituting a half a cup if applesauce for the 2 eggs. That might have helped with the moisture and gave them extra apple flavor. I also used raw vegan sugar in place of the white refined sugar so the molasses that was not removed in processing gave them a nice flavor.

This recipe was amazing when following other reviewer's tips. But instead of the half white sugar and half brown sugar I used almost a cup of white sugar and topped it off with molasses. We were out of brown sugar again so it was the perfect substitute that I'd do again anyways even if I had brown sugar. I also put about 2 cups of shredded apple trying to make it more moist as well as the 1 cup chopped apple. The cinnamon was a great addition to the recipe too.

Made mini muffin using this recipes and the taste turned out great! Will definitely make these again. I did reduce the sugar by 20% and the sweetness turns out just nice. However the brown sugar toppings didn't turn out as good for me, so maybe I'll skip the topping part.

This recipe made 16 muffins (in regular size cupcake liners.)  As others suggested, I added some of the topping in the center of the muffins, I also added some sugar to the chopped apples about an hour prior to mixing to pull some of the juice out.  The consistency was fine, I was able to use the beaters the whole time.  It was approximately cookie batter consistency.  I wasn't sure how much they'd rise or if they'd spill over, I filled them about 3/4 full and they were just fine.

4 stars because I tweaked it a bit to (I think) improve it. I'm a firm believer in never using too much cinnamon with things like this, so I followed the advice of others and added cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter as well as increasing the apples (3 apples total, 2 shredded and 1 chopped) I think they turned out incredible. I could have easily stretched it to make 15 or 16 muffins, but I left it at 12 and they overflowed to  create amazing muffin tops. I coated my pan with a little coconut oil and had no issues getting the muffins out. The batter was SUPER thick but I think it's supposed to be, so down worry. I'll be making these often, I think.

I used whole wheat flour, Splenda Blend Sugar Mix, and frozen apples we picked last Fall. The recipe is very moist probably because the frozen apples provided more liquid. This worked out very well for us. I did not use the topping this first time around. I will make this again and am considering adding bran to the mixture to pump up the fiber. PS - I added cinnamon and vanilla to the apples the night before and let them sit in the fridge over night.

I loved this recipe and made it for my family almost 7 weekends in a row! I would just cut down the sugar in the topping and put less on, for it was slightly sweet for me. Other than that, the only thing I would say is that keep the apples fresh with lemon juice and keep warm- these muffins are half as good cold.

This is a good recipe, albeit lacking in flavor. The batter definitely needs cinnamon and nutmeg. I took the suggestion of shredding 2/3 of the apple and chopping the rest and I added lemon juice from half a lemon and 1 cup of sugar and let that sit for a little while. Sifted the dry ingredients and used brown and white sugar when mixing the butter/egg mixture. Everything came out moist. Next time, I'll be adding spices and using less sugar.

These were incredibly dry and I would not make them again. I even added 1/4 cup of milk to the batter and the muffins were still too dry to eat.

I made homemade applesauce and used 1.5 cups of that instead of slicing apples.  Lots of people noted problems with dryness etc.  Came out, I'd do that again.

Wow! This recipe handled my poor baking skills with grace, and I am a terrible baker. I followed some of the other reviews and shredded two apples and cut one into chunks (such good advice - the entire muffin was moist from top to bottom and each bite had delicious chunks of fruit in it). I used Granny Smith apples, but any would probably do. I also added extra spices - cinnamon and nutmeg, yum! These are best served warm.

I made this recipe unmodified and it was a great addition to our family Oktoberfest. Now we're back for more here in November. I used canola oil spray instead of grease for the muffin tin. The muffins popped right out with no fuss. This time I think I'll try adding a bit of spice to  the batter. For the "chopped apples" I used the crank apple corer/peeler/slicer and chopped finely with a knife. Perfect. We loved the crumbles just as described in the recipe.

Wow. These are delicious!! I followed a lot of the suggestions: Added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and added 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup sugar to the batter. I doubled the topping and put 1/2 in the middle. Added about 3/4 cup shredded apples and 1 1/2 cups chopped apples.

Thank you for the basic recipe. I was looking for an apple muffin recipe which I knew automatically I was going to change because  wanted to use a bunch of green tomatoes. I used 3 1/2 diced tomatoes. 1/2c brown and 1/2c white sugar.  Also added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  Turned out moist and delicious. Great way to use some green tomatoes, just don't forget to salt and rinse your tomatoes first.

Doubled the apples (half shredded, half chopped), used half brown sugar and half white, and added 1/2 t nutmeg and 1 t of cinnamon.
Very good.

I added 1 T. each of vegetable oil and milk because the batter was so dry.  As for  taste,  I loved the fresh, pure apple flavor, proof you don't need a boatload of cinnamon or other spices.

They were pretty good.  I found the muffin to be a tad dry, I will add some applesauce next time.  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter as suggested by others.

Totally delicious! My one year old ate an entire muffin and then asked for more! My muffin turned out a lot more flag than the picture, though, so I'll be tweaking the recipe if I make it again.

As the comments also did I added extra apples I shredded them instead of chopped. Extra cinnamon and vanilla too. To the topping I added oatmeal and Carmel about one tb. Worth. They were fantastic! 1/2 the batch I did the topping in the center. This was  great recipe to build off of! Definitely making again

The muffins are good, all it takes is a little tweeking to make them your own like grate up the apples to give a stronger taste all over the muffins I used my bullet for it and I added cinnamon to the batter next time I will add pineapple and raisins. The batter will not be stiff if you grate or blend up your apples don't blend till its apple sauce only blend enough to chop them up this will give the batter some juice. In the crumble I added an extra teaspoon of flour.

Following the recipe exactly, these are pretty good. Following advice from other reviews, these are fantastic five-star muffins. After making 7 batches of these in the past month, here's what I recommend: use half white and half brown sugar in the batter. Add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon or apple pie spice to the batter. Add another cup of chopped apples for a total of 2 1/2 cups. Don't blend, shred or chop them too small or they'll disappear. I keep them about the size of a pencil eraser. With those changes, my co-workers inhale these muffins.

I followed the recipe to a T because I needed an apple recipe and did not take time to read the review. My whole family loved it! I will make again for sure . The advise I read later about shredding apples and adding spice sound nice too but this this recipe does turn out quite tasty if you choose to not tweek it.

Waaay too sweet! I plan to try using half the sugar next time. It was also quite dry and crumbly. Did not take on a batter-like consistency until I had added an extra egg and about 3/4 Cup of milk.

These were delicious with a few modifications.  I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.  I accidentally left out the butter, but it wasn't missed at all because I added an extra cup of shredded apple to make the batter moist enough.  They were moist and flavorful muffins that I'll make time and time again.

Made as written. The only change was to up the baking temp to 400 for the first 5 minutes, then complete the baking time at 375. This helps to ensure the muffin won't sink with the topping. Taste great!

I subbed half of the butter (which I melted) for unsweetened applesauce, and added 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/4 tsp. allspice. I forgot to make the topping, but they still turned out great! I'll definitely make these again.

And lastly used oatmeal, pumpkin pie spice & Brown sugar in the streusel using your measurements...best apple muffin I ever made or eaten...Will definitely make again...p.s. super moist without added liquids

I think these are very good! I made them exactly as instructed - except I used some apples that were left over from another recipe. They had been sitting in cinnamon/allspice flavored "brown sugar juice" for a couple days. I chopped the apples a little more but did not grate any extra. I dumped in about two cups of apple chunks - brown sugar juice and all.  I used the topping, but just a smidge (my preference). Delicious. I was a little freaked out by the thickness of the batter but they turned out great - moist and flavorful and yum-my!

These muffins are amazing! I followed the suggestions of the other comments and the batter was already so good, I basically crawled into the mixing bowl. I didn't think the actual muffins could keep up with that but boy, was I wrong. Best. Apple. Muffins. Ever.

The recipe is perfect as written. It did not specify what type of Apple to use so I chose Granny Smith with delicious results.  For all those adding spices to improve the recipe, that's fine, but the muffins don't need it. If you want an apple spice muffin then sure, add them- but a plain apple muffin is a really good thing too and that's what this recipe is all about!!

This recipe was amazing! I did some tweaking with it to make it more of my own, and I believe that ultimately made it so much more devine. With the chopped apples I put it in a skillet and sauteed them with about a 1/4 cup of brown  sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, and a squeeze of lemon. Cooked  them for about 5-8 minutes and added it to the mix when it  called for it in the recipe. You can add the juices from the Apple & brown sugar mix, it adds more flavor and more moisture to the muffins. Also in the batter itself I added a  touch more cinnamon to it so it would not be so plain. Overall it was a great recipe that my whole family loves and devours!

I added an extra cup of apples, mostly grated, plus cinnamon and an apple slice on top. Amazing!!!! My husband's new favorite treat, and he's very picky about baked goods. Will definitely be making these on a regular basis!

VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! I made these exactly by the recipe. I wish I would have read tips from the reviews. The muffin was very bland. And the crumb topping melted away, and did not stay "crumby". My 6 year old helped make these and he didn't like them either.

Mmmm yum! After reading some of the reviews I decided to shred 1 cup of the apple which also extracted some of the natural juices and chop the other half cup so you also have the nice chunks.  I also used 1/2 cup of brown and 1/2 cup white sugars and added cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter.  I still found the batter a little on the dry side so I slowly added a little apple juice to it until I reached the desired consistency. Not only were they delicious, but my kitchen smelled like heaven on a cold winters day! Thanks for sharing!

tried this recipe this morning and it was simple, easy. Added 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup toasted walnuts to the batter. Was awesome. Next time I will soak the raisins first to plump them up. Great morning muffins.

I made this recipe because my husband peeled way too many apples form me when I was making apple crisp. I substituted 1/2 c of applesauce for the butter because I was running low on butter and didn't want to run to the store. I also added about a teaspoon and a half of cinnamon to the batter and followed the other reviewers advice to use half brown half white sugar. I completely forgot the streusel for the top but they really didn't need it. They were moist and flavorful. I made them for my kids breakfast tomorrow but I had to test one just to be sure...so good

Followed reviews and did half white sugar, half brown sugar. Added an entire tablespoon of cinnamon because I'm a huge cinnamon fan. Also doubled the apple: half shredded, half chopped. Consistency is great! Used apples from the tree at my house!

Only gave it a 3 because I had to make too many changes.  Definitely needed more spice in batter and there were too many eggs, making it too wet. Plus, the topping was more sugary than streusel so I used my own combination of flour (more flour than sugar), brown sugar and butter.

I did this as 6 jumbo muffins instead of the smaller ones.  Used only 1 egg, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 large granny smith apple (shredded...about 1 1/2 cups).  Added 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice (could use apple pie spice).  All dry ingredients (except sugar) should be whisked together.  All liquid ingredients, sugar and apple should be whisked together.  For perfect texture muffins, wet should always be folded gently into dry ingredients until there's no flour on the bottom of the bowl and no flour chunks in batter.  It should be lumpy.  Also cooked at 350 deg F for 30-35 minutes.

Delicious! Use granny smith apples and dice them into small pieces. I recommend using more apples and more spices to bring out the flavor of the apples. I loved it!

Excellent recipe.  I used Gala apples peeled and diced very small.  I, too, used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.  I whirled the topping in the food processor, made quick work of making the cold hard butter into grainy sand mixture for the topping.  I'll definitely make these again.

Awesome recipe....I just modified it by adding oatmeal to the topping, adding a teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg and, grating one apple and chopping the other. In addition I creamed the mixture until it was light and fluffy so they came out really soft to the touch and more like a heavy cake, still absolutely delicious!!! My roommates loved them!!

These are great. I had to make a few changes due to not enough ingredients. I used 1 1/4c flour and 3/4 c whole wheat flour. I also added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry ingredients. I used granny smith apples, one I chopped the other I coarsely grated. Sugar - I used 1/4 c brown sugar then the rest white. My muffin pans I think are on the smaller size (they are about 20 years old) so I got 15 muffins.

Made these as mini-muffins (subtracted 5 minutes from the cook time and grated rather than chopped the apples) and they were a huge hit.  Thanks!

I made this recipe as is, except I made 12 regular muffins and 7 mini muffins for the kiddos.  I am eating them as I type this and they are delicious!  Turned out a lot better than I had anticipated.  If you make this you should really make it as is the first time and see what you think before making any adjustments.  Then you can add to or take away from the recipe the next time.

I took some of the other reviewer's advice, and the result was perfect. I used ~2 cups apples, one cup shredded and one diced. I used 1/2cup white sugar and 1/2cup brown, added the brown sugar to the apples to bring out more juice and creamed the butter with the white sugar. Also I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the dry ingredients before mixing. The crumb topping I didn't change. The batter was thick, but the muffins turned out moist and delicious. The cooking time was spot on too, at 20 mins they had a nice little crumb on my tester toothpick. Almost more like a cupcake than a muffin, but a big hit at the brunch I brought them to.

I think the muffins were a bit bland, although I had added a teaspoon cinnamon and a quarter teaspoon cloves, and a tablespoon lemon juice. Not sure why, maybe I'll just double the spices next time. The kids loved the muffins, though. I made them as cake pops in mini muffin tins, with the topping covering the bottom and walls of the cups, and with a popsicle stick in the center.

This is a great easy recipe..  I do some tweaking to it though. Aside from almost doubling the amount of apples I also add a about a 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of apple pie spice to kick it up a notch. I have found the more apples I add the moister it is.. This is a favorite in our house..

I found it pretty dry. I did add spice and doubled the topping as suggested. Maybe adding applesauce and or apple butter would help. Also, I would recommend muffin holders because even though I sprayed a ton of Pam, the muffins fell apart as I took them out after cooling.

Dry.  And bland.

I added 1.5 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of nutmeg.  I also sprinkled cinnamon and sugar in with the apples.  I had plenty of moisture to mix the batter.  Other than sweet, it just didn't have much taste.  My kids liked it; but then again, they like sweet.

Seth and Liana loved.  I used half white, half brown sugar as suggested.  Added 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and  1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the batter.  I also used  a total of 2 c. of apples that I had frozen chopped.  1 c.  of that was shredded in the Black and Decker chopper.  I got 16 muffins from that.  I also mixed it with the hand mixer after softening the 1/2 c. butter.  Shredding a little less would likely be fine.

I just made these gluten free and vegan. The result was the best muffin I have ever had in my life!

I used 2 cups of Jewel's All Purpose GF Flour, butter flavor shortening and flax meal eggs to make them GF and vegan. I only used 1 teaspoon vanilla, but added 4T of unsweetened applesauce, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and used 1 shredded and 1 chopped Granny Apple. I omitted the crumble entirely and will never add it as it is perfect on its own.

Moist and delicious! Love having a crunchy sweet topping on my muffins. Half of my muffins looked perfect and the other half I ended up with little indents from something (too big of a butter chunk perhaps?) Very simple though, will make again. :)

If I paid good money for these in a bakery I would be happy! Very good.  I didn't change anything from the original recipe(as I don't like to rate a recipe I have changed) but I don't see how adding more topping, cinnamon, etc like others have suggested could hurt either!

I followed the other reviewers' suggestions and used 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar, shredded a cup of the apples, and added a few tablespoons of apple sauce and some cinnamon and nutmeg.  Next time, I will add another 1/2 to 3/4 cup of apples just for preference.  Very good and very moist.

Really good...but I added cinnamon. Also used about 2 cups of apples. Next time I'll add nutmeg, too. These made about 18 large muffins for me, but that might have been because I used extra apples. So nice to have a way to satisfy my apple cravings when I don't want to go to the trouble of making apple pie. =)

Good muffins! Did add lots more spice than recipe called for. Put at least a tsp. of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. fresh ground nutmeg. Had to add a little extra liquid (couple of T of half and half) because the dough was so thick. Melted butter for topping and added more cinnamon and nutmeg. The toppping did not sink into the muffins, they rose well. Did add 5 minutes of cooking time. I will make these again. Thanks for sharing.

Wow such a great and simple muffin batter! I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon into the batter. I doubled the amount of apples - half shredded, half cubed. and I substituted half the white sugar for brown sugar and it turned out great. I didn't do anything to change the topping and it just made the muffin even more amazing. Great recipe. Definite must-try :)

As written it's a fairly good recipe. Made some adjustments, like using homemade chunky applesauce in place of the apples (it added some much needed moisture) and a little extra cinnamon to the batter itself (maybe 1/4 tsp?) Turned out incredibly delicious, the whole family loves them. Will definitely be making again.

I used most of tunisianswife's modifications: I chopped two-thirds of the apples in my food processor and hand-chopped the rest to have some larger chunks. I mixed the apples with 1/2 cup of brown sugar before doing the rest of the steps. I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the dry ingredients, and reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup (because there was 1/2 cup brown sugar mixed in with the apples). My one complaint is that they really didn't rise all that much, but they are delicious, so I'm giving it 5 stars anyway. I guess I'll play with the amounts of baking powder/soda next time.

I made this recipe exactly as written except that I added cinnamon to the batter (about a teaspoon) and nutmeg to the crumb topping (about a 1/4 tsp).  I used a giant granny smith apple as I like the tartness and firmness of them for baking.

Really good recipe, kids loved it, easy to make - I only took away 1 star because of the lack of spice/flavour in the original recipe.

I have made this recipe twice, first time as is and they were super delicious. The second time I was really craving blueberry muffins, so I substituted the apple for blueberries and it is sensational. Definitely recommend.

recipe lacked spices which I thought it needed, so I did add 1 tsp cinnamon. Also like I saw other reviews state the batter was thick and not very apple flavored so added some apple (I shredded 1 1/2 cups of apple and chopped 1/2 cup of apples), added 1/4 cup of oil and added 1 cup of Hershey's cinnamon chips. They turned out good, they were moist, but still could have used more apple flavor, gonna add more shredded apple next time. With these adjustments I would rate it a 4, but still a good base recipe for someone who likes to experiment like I do. Forgot to mention, I cooked for only 15 minutes.

Even with making all the suggested adjustments these are still just ok.  They are good, but not great.

I made this recipe vegan.  I substituted Earth Balance for the Butter and Egg Replacer for Eggs.  Also I added a couple of tablespoons of Almond Milk to the Muffin mixture because it seemed a bit dry.  
I brought these to a brunch and most people had two muffins so that was an amazing sign.  I left some at home for my boyfriend and he said it's one of the best muffins he's ever eaten....he may just be a really nice boyfriend though.  :)
I really loved these and totally recommend them!

I really like these muffins. They're tasty without being too sweet. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter for more flavor. I also added about 3/4 C jarred apple sauce to loosen up the batter and chopped one apple for texture. They turned out really moist and fluffy. Yum!

Super yummy. I used apple sauce instead of butter in the batter and it was still fantastic (and low fat). Great way to use up the apples from my tree. One note: With most muffins you only fill up the cup 2/3 of the way full, but with this batter there was so much that I filled it all the way to the top and it turned out just fine. They don't seem to raise as much as most muffins.

These were delicious!  I did follow the suggestions in a lot of the other reviews and make a few changes, which is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.  I used 1/2 cup brown and white sugar, added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter, used 2 apples and shredded one of them, and used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 butter.  Next time I may use 1 additional apple and cut back on the topping a little (there was a lot!).  I will be making these again!

AMAZING with Tunisianswife's tweaks. I did cut out about 1/5 cup of the white sugar and used wheat flour because I had no white flour on hand...I also used one apple and one snack size cup of apple sauce b/c I was out of apples. Nonetheless, still absolutely delicious and moist.

These are sensational! Made them more than once and everyone loves them. Just a little tip: you might want to add more apples to make the batter softer and more moist.

Very tasty! Definitely the best apple-cinnamon muffin I've tried, and my family agreed. The only thing I did differently was added about 1/3 cup of oat bran soaked in 1/3 cup of milk to the mix to add a little more texture and "health benefit". Also added a healthy dash of cinnamon directly to the batter. Can never have too much cinnamon! Excellent.

I finally found an apple strudel muffin recipe that worked for me! Others have been way too moist and dense and not keepers according to my kids.  As per other reviewers and for each batch of this recipe I used half brown and half white sugars; I added 2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp nutmeg (OMG...the aroma in my house was heavenly as these were baking); only used half the topping ingredients but added cinnamon and nutmeg and oats to it as well(used the other half of the topping on some blueberry muffins found on this site); used 2 large granny smith apples which 1 1/4 of the apples was shredded and the rest was chopped.  The muffins rose beautifully and the recipe made 12 large muffins! Tasted awesome and felt there was plenty of flavor to them...and my kids approved of them too! Try this recipe and see for yourself! =)

I used cinnamon and nutmeg,  they were still  bland. I used extra apples, grated and chopped, baked 10 minutes less time than suggested, and they are extremely dry. Way too sweet to even be called muffins. Not worth keeping this recipe as written.

Five stars is after tweaking.  I added 1 t. cinnamon and some freshly grated nutmeg to the batter and also changed the apple to about 2 cups chopped Granny Smith.  We like the topping so used 1/2 c. flour, 1/4 c. each butter and brown sugar, and cinnamon to taste (several shakes).  Baked in papers.  The batter is super thick (like cookie dough!), but these turned out moist and delicious and everyone who has had them loves them.

Just made these tonight and honestly I was a little dissappointed in these muffins.  There were a little drier than I expected (I added extra apple to make 3 1/2 cups shredded and let them sit in sugar to bring out the flavor more). I just finished one right out of the oven expecting my tastebuds to dance or maybe sing a little and it was good.  Not great but good (and my hubby agreed).  I couldn't really taste the apple and with 3 1/2 cups that's surprising.  The crumb topping is great and saved the muffin for me. I'm bringing them to a brunch tomorrow & we'll see if the guests concur.

i didn't have enough butter, so I used a little applesauce and they turned out great.  Also added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the muffin mix. Will definatley make again.

I made this recipe as a bread.  My family and friends ate the loaves right up.  I did have to add about 1/2c of water to it to make it more of a moist batter.

The first time I made these they came out dry and there was barely any apple flavor throughout the muffins. I altered a few things and just made them again and they came out fabulous! The key to this recipe going from okay to fab is you must: DOUBLE THE APPLES, SHRED THEM, AND ADD SPICE TO THE BATTER. I used 4 Granny Smith apples that were shredded instead of 1 1/2 c chopped apples. This correction fixed the moisture problem AND gave the muffins the delicious apple flavor I was looking for. I must also include that I added 1 tsp Cinnamon and 1/4 tsp Nutmeg to the batter. I also used 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar. Good luck!

Wow, these are so good!!! I did make some changes. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, 1 tbsp of brown sugar (Splenda kind), and 4 tbsp of chunky applesauce. I used 2 apples (Macintosh and Golden Delicious) that I diced really small. These muffins are the best! I could see adding some nuts to this as well would be a good idea.

Amazing. I took others' advice and added more apple and grated it. I used honeycrisps - they were super moist which added great flavor to the recipe. I added generous amounts (1 tsp +) of: cinnamon, apple pie spice, ground cloves, allspice, and ground ginger. The more flavor the better :) I also added a tsp. more vanilla. SO GOOD!

They really didn' t look like the picture... it was hard to get the batter into the cups should have advised on how high to fill them up, the tast was okay and they were really moist I used 3 Granny smith and let them sit with a bit of sugar in the fridge. I will try again I will just be more careful so they look more presentable.

Delicious! I used half brown sugar and added cinnamon like others suggested(was out of nutmeg) and added about 1/4 cup of applesauce since the batter was dry. I also added the apples to the dry ingredients instead of the wet so that they wouldn't sink to the bottom while baking. I got 17 average size muffins out of this recipe! I'll definitely make it again!

These muffins disappeared at my house!  I took some to work, they were gone, my husband had them in his lunch and for a snack.  Everyone loved them.  They are moist & flavorful.  The only thing I did different, was to add walnuts to the muffin & to the strudel.  I will make these again, and soon....YUMMY!

These were great. I took the advice from previous reviews and doubled the apples and added spices to the batter. My husband said these were by far the best apple muffins he had ever had and maybe even th best muffins period.

These muffins got rave reviews when I brought them into the office. I tweaked a few things. Instead of 1 cup white sugar try 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white. Added 1/4  cup of applesauce. Instead of chopped apples I used a cup and a half of apple pie filling from the can and chopped it up. The liquid they are in gave AMAZING flavor and texture to the muffins. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the batter. Mmmm so good.

I loved these muffins. I did add some cinnamon, nutmeg and about 1/4 cup of chopped pecans (both in the batter and the crumb topping) to these which I would reccomend doing. I used applesauce instead of butter, and subbed half the white sugar with brown sugar for a better depth of flavor and ended up adding 1/4 cup of milk because the batter was too thick for me to incorporate all the flour without over mixing. This left the batter nice and thick but gave it enough moisture to mix everything together easily. I also didn't measure the amount of apple I put it, but I used 2 medium granny smith apples I diced up really small & there were lots of apple pieces in each muffin, not too much and not too little, it was perfect. These were so good they're going to become a regular at my house.

These are wonderfull, specialy the day after.  I also used half brown sugar, half granulated. I hadn´t enough flour so i replaced 1/2 cup with cornstarch and it went fine, they are nice and fluffy, but i got a nice surprise,: my muffins have a hole in the center.... i don´t know if it has something to do with the substitution i made. However that hole is half of the wonderfullness in my muffins, because the sirup made from the streusel went throug the doug hand covered the little cave. That was my other surprise....i don´t know why the streusel melted (i made it wiht cornstarch), i expected the crumble surface, but got, instead, a delicious filling.

I've made these once, can't wait to try them again with a few modifications.  The first time I added some nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice to the batter, just a little bit.  I would like to get these a little more moist so I'm going to take prior advice and add more apples and substitute some applesauce to cut down on the butter.  Great base recipe, can't wait to experiment!

Fantastic recipe. With a few tweaks here and there, and a dash of allspice, this turned out to be a real winner! It didn't really "rise" and fluff out like I thought it would though. I filled the tins 3/4 of the way and it only filled up to the top of the tin. Love the taste!

I made the recipe just as stated (almost, I used half plain and half whole wheat four) and I think it was about 3.5-4 star.  I thought the topping was great and wouldn't change a thing.  I used red delicious apples as that is what I had on hand but think I would use a more tart apple next time as I could barely taste the apple.  Very good though and only minimal tweaking needed for personal taste.

I made these muffins to bring over both my mom's and mother-in-law's house for Mother's Day. Everyone loved them! Someone even asked if there was cream cheese in the recipe. This recipe is a keeper!

Delicious..everyone raves over these muffins, i did use 3 large apples, shredded about 2-2 1/2 apples, and chopped the rest, and it came out perfect, i added some nutmeg, and cinnamon to the batter, and i followed the recipe for the strudel topping the second time, and it came out better when you just softened the butter!! I'll definitely keep making these, and I'm not even a big apple person!

The only thing positive about this recipe was the topping.  The muffins were dry and dense.  I shredded the apples instead of chopping them but there was not nearly enough apple....I would recommend doubling the apples and adding some applesauce to the batter.

I tweaked the recipe due to the many reviews:  1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 cup chopped apple, 1 cup shredded apple, mix apple and sugar together to let juices come out, 1 tsp cinnamon and dash of nutmeg added to batter.  Still, though very good, not totally outstanding, and no one had more than one, which was disappointing...  Would have been better if I'd have sprinkled some of the topping in the MIDDLE of the muffin as well as on the top.  Next time I'll try that.  I will also leave the apples in larger chunks instead of shredding so many.

this is the first recipe that got a "hey, these are pretty good" from my hubby instead of just "they're okay".  i tweaked it a little by adding 1 tsp of cinnamon to the batter.  i used 1 shredded apple and 1 chopped (big chunks) apple.  i left out the topping cause i was tired and frankly they tuned out fine without it.  it made 18, i think my muffin tin was just tiny.

Nice tasting muffins, I forgot to put the topping on but they were good anyway. I used whole wheat flour, added 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon & pumpkin pie spice, I substituted 1/2 applesauce for the butter and grated the apples as well. I needed to add milk as the batter was too thick.

I made these muffins for my mom, and they taste great!  I used 2 cups of apples (instead of 1 1/2 cups), 1/2 cup brown sugar & 1/2 cup white sugar (instead of 1 cup white sugar), and added cinnamon and nutmeg.  I didn't include the strudel topping on the muffin (because my mom doesn't like things too sweet), and they still turned out very tasty!

I followed the recipe near exactly.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter, as well as using half shredded half chopped granny smith apples.  The batter was really thick, so I added a few tbsp of vegetable oil, just for moistness sake.  They took exactly 20 minutes to bake upand I had 28 nice sized muffins.  They smelled wonderful Christmas morning (from making the batter the day before) and with a little soft butter smeared all over a nice soft apple taste was perfect with coffee!

Fantastic Recipe! We had this for Christmas breakfast and couldn't have asked for a better cold-weather treat! I did adjust the recipe a little, but only by baking the recipe (as is) in a 9x9 metal cake pan and adding about 10 minutes to the cooking time since our 2 year old was excited about making a B-day cake for Jesus on Christmas morning. The strudel topping made an excellent "icing" and he had several big pieces all by himself. Delicious, moist, and filling, I could have eaten the whole thing by myself!

Really great muffins. I added cinnamon and will remember to do the sugar half & half next time. I followed the recommendation to grate half of the apples & dice the others, and that worked out very well.

These were very delicious! I read the other reviews about them not being moist, but I didn't have that problem at all! The strudel topping wasn't you normal strudel...it was nice and crunchy like a caramalized topping! Yum! My husband and I both loved these...in fact, I ate three of them already this morning!

These muffins are moist and delicious. My husband and I both enjoyed them. I changed the recipe a little by using 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also added 1 1/4  tsps. of cinnamon to the batter. Couldn't imagine making the recipe without it. I diced up 2 medium gala apples and found this was just the right amount for the recipe. For the strudel topping I melted the butter before adding it to the brown sugar mixture. I think when doing that you may need to use more than 1 tb., maybe melt an extra 1/2 tb. I'll definitely make these muffins again.

i made these exactly as the recipe stated except i added a little nutmeg & allspice to the topping (just a pinch of each) and i added chopped walnuts to the batter.  overall these were really good, a bit dry (just the tiniest bit), but i enjoyed them very much.  the topping is absolutely delicious!

So easy to prepare and bake.  The best use for all the extra apples I had laying around.  The muffins were very moist.  I did use closer to two cups diced apple and added more cinnamon to the strudel topping.  Next time I'd probably add a little more cinnamon to the batter as well.

I make my mom brunch for all her birthdays and mother's days.  It's her fav meal :)  Anyway, she loves these muffins.  I try to make them for those special occasions.  They are probably the best muffin ever!  So good and yummy.  Just hate chopping and peeling all those apples, but worth the effort.

This was a good base recipe but like many I altered it slightly.. I added 2 cups of small diced apples, 1 cup of applesauce for more moisture, 2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 white sugar 1/2 brown sugar and unfortunately I had to leave out the walnuts due to daughters allergies (bummer because I love walnuts). Instead of the topping I did an oat topping I put on top of my apple pies..1c of oats, 3/4c flour, 1/2c browns sugar, 1 stick of softened butter, 1 tsp vanilla, 1tsp cinnamon. Crumble ingredients together add on top of batter before baking.

Excellent! My mom made these muffins for the whole family and they were a hit! Absolutely scrumptious. She substituted the all-purpose flour for whole-wheat and oat bran. She also reduced the white sugar to 3/4 cup and used olive oil instead of butter. They were very healthy and tasty.

Good basic recipe.  I made them as per the recipe but next time I will do what other reviewers have done - shred the apple and add more of it.  Also I will add more spices to the batter as it needs a little something more.

Mmmmm...so good.  I grated all of my apples, so there aren't any chunks in my muffins.  It took about 6 small apples to get 1 1/2 cups.  I also did 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour.  I took other reviewers suggestions of adding 1 tsp. of cinnamon to the batter and doing half brown sugar, half white sugar.

This is an instant hit with my husband and for me as well. I listened to everyones changes and used them to get the best muffins ever. Although since I am allergic to eggs I used egg replacer. I used the equivalent of six eggs with the egg replacer, but I did double the recipe. And for cooking them I turned my oven down to 350 as it seemed 375 was over cooking them. But just Delicious over all!!!!

i made these yesterday as written and they tasted ok, but were really dry.  made another batch today, doubled the apple, added a good dose of cinnamon to the batter, added half a cup of buttermilk, skipped the topping.  they turned our really well, a nice crisp top (which i love on a muffin) and light, soft inside.  adding the extra apple and buttermilk made the muffins a bit bigger, so had to bake a couple more minutes, but as long as you keep an eye on them, no big deal.

These muffins filled my home with mouth watering aromas while baking.  I followed the other reviewers suggestions with some minor changes to the recipe.  These were a big hit with my whole family!  Will make these again for sure!

Delicious!! I made these for a coworkers birthday and they were a hit! I did make a few of the suggested changes to the recipe.  I doubled the apples, added 2 tsp cinnamon to dry ingredients, cut the butter to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, used 1/2 c white and 1/2 c brown sugar, and finally I added some of the topping mixture to the middle of the muffins.  SO GOOD!!!

These were good, but just a tad dry. They could use a little oil, or maybe applesauce to moisten them up. Maybe a touch of cinnamon to the batter too. The crumble part was delicious!

These were pretty good, I didn't think there was a very strong apple flavour though. I made them with some changes o ther people had made, grating 1 cup of apple and then chopping the rest, plus 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar. Not bad though.

They were really good... Everyone who ate it loved it, I baked it into a cake, and maybe because of that, the studel topping wasn't enough. So maybe the next time I will double the topping recipe. I mashed 2 apples in the blender, so the cake was really moist. I also used more cinnamon, both in the batter and in the topping.

Very yummy! My family loved these after I added some of the tweaks from other reviewers. Added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, 1 1/2 shredded apples and 1 1/2 finely chopped apples. Peeling, cutting and shredding the apples was the worst part of the recipe. It took quite a while, but it was definitely worth it. Also used unbleached flour and raw organic sugar. I'll definitely be making these again.

These are delicious - especially the batter! I only give it four stars though because the cake part could have been a little more flavorful, but with the apples it's still really good.  I doubled the amount of apples and graded half of then and chopped half too.

This recipe as written is 3-4 stars, but I ended up changing a few things like other reviewers. I added cinnamon, nutmeg, used 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar, reduced butter, and added applesauce. Used 2 apples, 1 shredded and the other finely chopped. Put part of the strudel in the middle of the muffin, and the rest on top. They came out really moist and pretty! The revised muffins are definitely 5 stars.

I've made these about twice now, and each time they come out perfect!  i do recommend that you add about a tablespoon of ground cimmomon before you add the apples and stir it in.  Also, I find it works best when you cube the apples, then slice them into thin pieces so they're only about an inch long.

My muffins came out delicious (if a little weird-looking), but ONLY after following suggestions from other reviewers. The original submitted recipe is a great idea, but is really only an average recipe as written. Thanks!

This is a good recipe to use up a lot of apples.  The apples I used had been in cold storage for months and were cooking quality only. I cored, sliced and chopped them up with minimal effort in a blender (one apple at a time, since I don't have a food processor).  4 cups of chopped gala apple is what I used as well as half sugar & half Splenda and extra spice as many other reviewers suggest. Valentine cupcake liners made them festive for the occasion.

I love this recipe! I've made this recipe exactly as it states so many times before and each time it turned out great! I've also added things to it such as adding 1/3 cup of oats to the flour and 1/3 cup of my sister's favorite flowery tea (Monk's Blend) along with 1/8 of a teaspoon of Chinese Five Spice powder and a few tablespoons of caramel ice cream topping. I also accidentally added the white sugar to the flour so I added an extra 1/4 cup of loosely packed brown sugar to the butter. In the end the muffins turned out great! You can't really taste the tea or the five spice powder but they give the muffins a little hint of something extra.

I replaced canola oil for the butter, reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup, used 1/2 cup Egg Beaters for the eggs and added a bit of cinnamon to the batter. Also doubled the streusel topping. Wonderful!!

Great muffin recipe!  I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 the amount of butter and 1/2 applesauce.  I also doubled the crumb topping (a must!). I also substituted Splenda for the white sugar in the muffins  Thanks to the reviewer who said to use grated apples as well as chopped as this way produces a really moist muffin.  Took these to my daughter's basketball tournament and they went fast!

I followed some of the top reviews and made the muffins as follows:
1. In a medium bowl, add 1 large Honeycrisp apple, cored, pared & chopped. Toss with 1/2 c. white sugar.
2. In another medium bowl, mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and 1 t. cinnamon. 
3. In a large bowl, beat together butter, 1/2 c. brown sugar and eggs until smooth. Mix in 1 t. vanilla. Stir in apples, and gradually blend in the flour mixture. Spoon into a greased 12 c. muffin pan.
4. In a small bowl, mix brown sugar, flour and cinnamon. Cut in butter until mixture is like coarse crumbs, adding more flour if necessary. Sprinkle over muffin tops.
5. Bake 20 mins. in preheated 375 degree oven....
My kids really liked these muffins. I thought they were...well, 4 star.

This is a terrific recipe.  I made some of the changes suggested by others - used 2 cups of apples, 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar, added cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also added walnuts for some crunch.  The spices add the most wonderful flavoring.  I will definitely make these again.

I was hungry for a good apple muffin.  It's fall in Minnesota and we have plenty of apples.  These hit the spot with TUNISIANSWIFE's changes.  (1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg) I used 1 1/2 cups shredded apple AND 1 1/2 cups chopped apple.  I was worried that they would be too wet, but they were just perfectly moist.  I also added a little dry oatmeal to the struesel topping and melted the butter to make the topping easier to mix up.  I will definitely add nuts next time I make these.  They could use a little crunch.  Walnuts or pecans would be good. Will definitely make again.  I brought into work on a platter arranged with an apple slice between each muffin.  Everyone raved.

Keeper!  I find so many muffin recipes to be drier than I like, and it's so disappointing.  This was moist and delicious.  I used almost 2 cups of apple, and I used 3/4 cup of apple pulp in place of half of the butter (so I used 1/2 a stick of butter and 3/4 cup apple pulp).  I also used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar (actually the half real and half splenda kind).  I baked mine in the BIG muffin tins, so I only got 6.  I baked them 30 minutes.

I am going to alter this recipe some and try it with blueberries.  If I could get a great, moist blueberry muffin recipe, I'd be so happy!

These came out really nice. I added in half a spoon of cinnamon when I added in the Vanilla Extract. Also I chopped one apple and grated the other. Did half brown sugar and half white. There could have been more apple flavor imo, that is the only reason I gave it a 4 other then that they were perfect.

These were fabulous. And, as usual, I made some changes. I peeled 2 apples, chopped one in small pieces, and the other I actually grated with a cheese grater. The grating created an applesauce-like texture. I added about a teaspoon and a half of Real lemon juice, then sprinkled with cinnamon. While that sat for awhile, I prepared the mixture. 
I up-ed the vanilla to 2 teaspoons, I used half white sugar and half packed brown sugar. I was in a hurry and thought I had totally messed up the topping. I must have put way to much butter in and the mixture was like brown sugar paste, but I dabbed a little on top anyway, and sprinkled walnuts on top.

Baked in a large muffin pan of 6 for the time and temperature directed. My husband loved them! They went well with the meatloaf dinner. The next day we each had one at lunch time, and they were just as moist, and so delicious. This one is a keeper!

Topping was great but I was disappointed in the lack of apple flavor after all that chopping.

These apple strudel muffins are delicious!! However, what is an apple streudel muffin without spices? I read some reviews and added some teaspoon and ginger (I didn't have any nutmeg on hand), and it went from 3 plain stars to 5!! Plus, I felt the need to add to the name, which now, for me, is "Apple Streudel SPICE Muffins." Haha.  =]

I gave these muffins four stars because the bottom of the muffin turned out very dry and lacking flavor. I will try this recipe again and add cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter and possibly another 1/2 cup of apples. I would also suggest cooking them for a few minutes less than what is prescribed on the directions. I will update when I make these again. Note: the topping is wonderful and definitely double those proportions.

These were absolutely delicious! Some changes i made: added about 1/4 cup of unsweetened organic applesauce (no need for sweetened because of the sugar already in the recipe, pinch of nutmeg, a good teaspoon of cinnamon and a tablespoon of vanilla! For some, a tablespoon might seem like much, but with the brand i get, it's really barely noticeable. I did 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar and put that 1/2 white sugar on top of grated/chopped granny smith apples and let the juices come out for 2-3 hours. i also put some lemon juice on the apples to slow the discoloration. But out of all of the adjustments i made, adding a tremendous squirt of maple syrup really did the trick!!! It added extra moisture, tremendous flavor, and a really amazing scent in the house! Also, use a bit more apples than called for! Overall, these were great!! Thank you!

I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon. I shredded 2 apples and chopped 1. Next time I make these I am going to chop 2 apples and use a small cup of apple sauce. The smell was wonderful as they were baking in the oven. My husband brought them into work and everyone loved them. Thank you for sharing your recipe

Moist, smells good, look good... but bitter too..

I don't know what's wrong. I make 5 big the muffins and 10 mini ones (with 3apples shredded),the mini ones are good because the sweet topping make up for the bitterness, but boy, the big ones are big disappointment, we can only eat the top.

I seriously confused about where i go wrong. Is it the baking powder/soda or the vanilla (i use vanilla powder) that cause the bitterness???

Good recipe! I made the additions of cinnamon and nutmeg, and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar as recommended by other reviewers. I think next time I will add another apple to make a total of three.

These are just wonderful!!  I made these for my family & my brother told me that these are the very best apple muffins he has ever had and that he would love this as a cake too.  My husband, children and father loved them too.  I make these and freeze them to be devoured as a quick breakfast.  I followed the recipe as is, and thought they were just perfect without any alterations to the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!!  This is a much loved treat in our house.

These muffins turned out great. I didnt change anything in the recipe and followed it word for word. It was very simple. The muffins came out moist on the bottom and crunchy on the top. I would definetly reccomend this recipe.

I made a really delicious vegan version of this recipe. Instead of butter I used vegan butter and instead of eggs i used applesauce (3 Tsp=1 egg).  I also added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp allspice, and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  And I used half apple and half pear, because it was all i had. they are so tasty!

These are wonderful muffins!  I peeled and chopped two large red delicious apples to add to the batter.  We liked the chunkiness of the apples.  I made 12 regular size muffins and had enough left over to make 12 mini-muffins too!  The strudel topping is the perfect compliment to the apple muffin.

Great, bakery style muffins.  I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  It is not necessary to peel the apples.  I diced them.  If I had shredded them, they would have disappeared in the batter.  Between this recipe and 'To Die For Blueberry Muffins' I have no need to ever by muffin mix again!

Oh my goodness... these muffins were heaven! My neighbour and I made them together and we proved that they should be called "Flopproof". Neither of us are very good at reading recipes so the sugar got sifted with the flour... instead of beaten with the egg and butter... the apples (tinned) were thrown in straight out of the can (in slices) and later chopped up frantically with a knife for fear of someone choking on one! Then the eggs and butter were beaten together and looked rather lumpy but got thrown in regardless with the dry ingredients (yes, back to front) and voila!  We put them in the oven, baked them for 2 minutes, then realised we'd forgotten to put the topping on... yanked them out, sprinkled them, put them back in and I tell you... we'll be on the next Biggest Loser soon because they are so divine - more like a cake than a muffin... Deeelish! From the two crazy cooks in South Africa! p.s. we also added extra cinamon and even some ground cloves...

never written a review before but absolutely had to! These are divine, honestly. Like everyone else, i messed around with the recipe a bit and it is a huge hit in this household and at the cop shop where i work with a whole lotta fussy guys.  I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar like most, and think it might be able to even use less. I didn't use raisins or nuts but i DID add one banana which seemed to give it moisture. Also threw in a half cup of flax seeds, just for the health of it.  Oh! and the big kicker???  I put in 2 T of pumpkin pie spice. seemed to give it a nice bit of oomph
all i can say is....scrumdillyicious!

These are very very good, especially with the topping! I used granny smith apples and followed everything to a T. They made the house smell amazing. my daughters were stalking the kitchen, waiting for the buzzer to sound, LOL! I do recommend putting the unused muffins un a ziplock while warm to retain moisture, otherwise they become dry the next day.

Have to give it 5 stars.  My husband doesn't usually like muffins, but had one of these and loved it.  I need to watch the baking time next time, as I thought they were a little overdone.  Good none the less.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because it was good but required tweaking.  I read prior reviews and made changes based on them.  First off, I doubled the recipe to make a larger batch.  I added 2 tsp. of cinnamon and 1 tsp. of nutmeg to the wet ingredients.  I shredded half of the apples, chopped the other half and sprinkled a thin layer of the strudel topping in the middle of the muffins.  I also couldn't stomach using a whole cup of butter in this recipe so I did 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce that I made using "Sarah's Applesauce" recipe from this site.  All in all, the muffins were moist and had a great apple-spice flavor with a little crunch from the strudel topping.  I would make this recipe again with the modifications I listed above.

These muffins are INCREDIBLE! I am 5 months pregnant, and I just found my new craving!!! We added about 2 1/2 cups of granny smith apples with the peel, most in very fine pieces, though we left about 1/2 c. of bigger chunks. I also added some cinnamon to the batter. I had just turned my oven down from baking something at 400 degrees, so they baked in 17 minutes and were perfectly done. I made the cinnamon honey butter recipe (from this site) to top these, but they didn't need it - the butter just made them more decadent! I served these with BBQed pork out of the crock pot, coleslaw, and baked macaroni and cheese. A HEAVENLY MEAL!!!

We've made this twice using the first reviewer under the recipe's suggestions and they've been wonderful both times (uses about 2 1/2 apples in our experience).

I honestly didn't think they were that amazing, but I gave them 5 stars, cuz my son said he wishes I could make them every day! For an 8 yr old, that must mean they're really good! I thought they were a bit dry, but still a nice treat with coffee.

Yummy! I used 3 small granny smith apples, which gave the chunks a nice bite.  I shredded one and a half, chopped the remainder, used four T applesauce, 1/3 c margarine, 1 t cinn and 1/2 t nutmeg in batter, 1/2 c. white sugar, 1/2 c brown, and a little extra cinnamon in the topping.  I made them ten hours ago, got twelve standard size muffins, and have only four left.  well, three as soon as i get done with this review ;)

I made a few changes to this recipe. I doubled the amount of apples (chopped half and shredded half), went with 1/2 cup of white and light brown sugar, I added cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and since the batter was a little on the thick side, I went ahead and added 3 Tbl. of whole milk. I took some of the other viewers advice and I'm glad I did because they are perfect. A perfect breakfast muffin for sure!

I found this recipe when I was searching for something I could make with my old apples.  It was great!  I followed some suggestions of others and added my own take.  Here's what I did: I used 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1 cup whole whear flour plus about 1/2 cup of oats.  I added a bit more than the recommended measurments for baking powder and baking soda.  I also pureed two apples with some cinnamon.  I cut up two more apples (did not peel) and covered in a pinch of sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and honey and set them aside until needed.  I also used part brown sugar and part white sugar instead of all white sugar.  I also added crushed hazlenuts to the batter.  I baked part of the batter in a muffin tin and used the rest to make three small bread loaves.  For two loaves of bread I added raisins.  The results for both versions were more than I could have asked for!  My husband loved them, my friends loved them and I didn't feel too guilty for eating them!

These muffins were pretty good, I don't think they'll become a regular in my recipe box, but I'm glad I gave them a try. I used McIntosh apples since that's all I had on hand.

Because of a dairy allergy in our family I used canola oil instead of butter for the batter.  Muffins were still moist and delicious.  Also, I did not have time for the topping so I sprinkled with brown sugar.  Thanks for a great muffin recipe!

Four stars cos Tweaked the recipe a lil. muffins came out extremely moist. Never baked or had a thing for muffins b4 and was surprised how good it was. My boyfriend loved it.
Baked on middle-lower rack. Changes:Replaced the 1 cup white sugar with 1/2 cup brown- just perfect.
Apples: used 2 regular gala, 1 large granny smith.
To flour mixture: 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 shake of ground nutmeg. 
Some reviewers suggested putting the topping in the muffin- I found it made it way sweet for my liking. And it made the muffin appear not well mix cos it was too sweet on some parts. On top of muffin was ok. 
Didnt add any water/dairy cos I think the addition of extra apples made it moister during the baking process. def worthy of trying!

Absolutely delicious!!! The strusel kind of sinks down into the muffin, so you get some with every bite. A little crumbly. I did have to add milk to the batter b/c it was very very thick. Makes a lot!

These muffins are delicious...I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions, and changed a few things myself.  I used 7 Tablespoons of butter, 3 cups of apples (Concord), 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of vanilla (only reduced b/c I ran out), and 1/8 teaspoon of cloves. They turned out perfect...even better with a little cream cheese spread on them!

These were good! While looking at reviews, I sorted by "most helpful" and found the suggestions posted by Tunisianswife. I used 3 apples and that was a good amount. What I would change is that I wouldn't use the nutmeg suggested in the reviews. I used 1/4 tsp. instead of the 1/2 tsp. that was suggested, and the nutmeg was overpowering. Thanks for the recipe!

These bake up really nicely and the topping can't be beat... I did add some cinnamon to the dry mix and about a half a cup more apple than called for, but otherwise baked as written. Very good.

The are awesome, only change is I add 1/4 to 1/2 tsp cinnamon with the dry ingredients but I love cinnamon so I like them that way.  Definitely make the crumb topping it takes these muffins from good to DELICIOUS!! 
(also try making these in paper muffin cups as the sugar cinnamon topping can become sticky)

These are my youth kids favorite. I also made this muffin in a bread, that Was really good. If you put some cinnamon topping after filling the batter half way it tastes really good.

These were excellent!! I made half a batch, and managed to cut down the calories to about 150 by replacing 3/4th of the butter with applesauce and using splenda instead of white sugar. They turned out deliciously moist. :) Thank you.

Unbelievable!
I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect.At first I was concerned because the batter was so thick but that was short lived (20 Min.) I was able to eat two of the twelve before they were all gone. Thank you!

These were pretty good. I made a few changes as suggested by others. Cut the butter to 1/4 cup and then substituted the other 1/4 cup with unsweetened applesauce. I used only a 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup and only 1 cup of chopped apples. Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Next time I may decrease the flour to 1 1/2 cups or I may add another 1/4 cup of applesauce since it was just a tiny bit dry. All in all these are great and the kids loved them.

These muffins are ok, but nothing I would try again. They have a bland taste and could definitely use more flavor, especially apple. The cake part of the recipe is plain and the only saving grace is the sugar/cinnamon on top.

My 12 year old daughter would give these muffins a 5 star rating however, I thought the muffin needed a little more spice.  It was more like a white cake with apples.  Maybe next time I will add apple pie spice to the batter or even cinnamon.  The muffin itself looked wonderful. A+ for presentation at the breakfast table.

Awesome recipe! I put about 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon in the flour mixture and made a cake of the batter instead of muffins. It turned out great. I might even make them into mini loaves next time. Thanks!

These muffins are awesome.  I made the recipe exactly as is and they are perfect.  The only recommendation I could make is to perhaps have 2 tbsp of flour in the crumb topping mix rather than 1 tbsp.  I found my topping was mostly sugar.

This recipe was good but I tweaked it a bit to make it healthier. Instead of using 1/2 cup of butter I substitutued sweetened apple sauce because it was all I had on hand, and I decreased the amount of sugar I added by half. Also because i found the batter to be quite gooey and hard to fold, i added approx. 1/4-1/2 c of sweetened apple juice. The topping was delicious, and I added a few pinches of oatmeal. I found the muffins to be quite chewy, and would recommend only substituting half or 3/4 of the butter in the batter. Nonetheless they got rave reviews by all who consumed them , and I will be making them again, Maybe with a few more tweaks!

This was a wonderful recipe, however, I can only give it 4 stars because of the changes I had to make. I added 3/4 cup plain soy milk to the flour mixture at the end because it wouldn't have been smooth enough to scoop into the muffin pan.  I also added 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the flour mixture, used brown sugar instead of white sugar, and whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour.  Be sure to melt the butter in the microwave before you add it to both the egg mixture and the crumble mixture.  If you want nice size muffins, I would say this makes eight instead of 12, but because they are bigger, cook for 25 minutes instead of 20 (still check with a toothpick as ovens vary).  Lastly, I will definetly use apple sauce instead of butter next time to makes these muffins healthier.  My husband and I both loved these muffins and the crumble adds an original touch.  Thanks so much Nikki.

These were supper tasty. The only things I changed were adding a little flax meal and using some Splenda.  I also added walnuts to the batter, but I would not recommend doing this because they overtake the delicate taste and texture.

Okay, this is now our favorite apple muffin. I haven't found a good-tasting, moist apple muffin recipe but this is it! Fill the cups up. I grated the apple and did not have any large, uncooked chunks to deal with. Just nice appley flavor. Thank you for the recipe. It's now in my permanent files.

This was a great base recipe and I made a bunch of alterations to make this low fat - still tasted delicious.  I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup of oat bran instead of the 2c all purpose flour.  I used 1c of brown sugar instead of the white and I used 1/2c of apple sauce instead of 1/2c butter.  I also added 1tspn of cinammon to spice it up.  These tasted delicious and I felt better eating them b/c I made them low fat and nutrious. The topping is great - YUM!

These were just "ok". My batter was incredibly thick so I had to add a little milk to be able to even spoon it into the muffin pan. The strudel topping tasted good, but it browned very quickly in the oven, and the muffins came out dark and unattractive. I wasn't very impressed. Maybe I just prefer blueberry muffins over apple. Thanks anyway!

I made this as a coffee cake rather than muffins and it was delicious. I used a 8x8 greased pan and cooked it for 30 min. I used 4 small granny smith apples cut into rather large chunks but I don't think it would matter too much about the size of the chunks. Also added a pinch of nutmeg to the topping. Just so others know...when you mix this together it is like a cookie batter; very thick...don't try to thin it.

Five stars when you keep in mind you have to make the batter moistier: add some applesauce or milk. I used just one apple; but will use two next time. Cut the apples roughly; maybe it seems as if the chunks are too big, but it will taste really yummie!
I should call these cakes instead of muffins....

Most excellent!  I substituted 1/2 cup of the flour for bran and ground flax, and sub'd applesauce for 1/2 the butter.  You'd never know, though.

This recipe is awesome!  At first I was somewhat skeptical on the thickness of the batter, but after they were baked, I tried them out on my family.  They were a big hit!  I ended up baking three more batches for my son's school bake sale and included making mini ones that he helped make himself.  I also like to omit the apples and just put blueberrys or a combination of a berry with ruhbarb.  If you like your muffins cakie, this is the recipe for you!

Here is a little note to other reviews that I have read.  Don't add any more moisture!  The apples make up for it.  So even thought the dough seems really thick or a little crumbly, use your will power and bake them anyways.  The best way to fill the muffin cups with this recipe is with an icecream scoop.  Perfect scoops everytime!

These muffins came out kind of dry, and I even substituted half the butter with applesauce.  I think it is b/c I didn't use enough apples.  The flavor is nice though - I added some cinnamon, nutmeg and ground gloves to the batter and pumped up the cinnamon in the streusel.

After the way everyone raved about this recipee, I was very disappointed.  The muffins had good flavor, but were very, very, VERY dry!!  I liked the base recipe & will make this recipe again, but next time I'll add applesauce or oil to the batter to make it less dry.

I love this recipe and have made it several times. It's moist and delicious.  I also put the strudel mixture in the middle because it is so great that way.  However, I will be cutting the sugar in half next time because it is too sweet.  ALso, next time I'll try cranberries instead of apples, just for something different.  These are truly a keeper!

I really love these muffins. I added a dash of cinnamon to the batter just for fun. They were really yummy right out of the oven in a dish with some ice-cream. It's definitly a keeper.

I enjoyed these muffins a lot, although i think it tastes better with more apples. and the recipe doesnt say what apples to use, so i used granny smith and they turned out nicely.

Excellent muffin!  Don't be afraid to try the half butter/half applesauce substitution because it comes out great.  It's nice to have a recipe to make out of things you always have on hand!  Thanks Nikki!

I have to admit that while I don't really care for these muffins, my husband and kids think they are wonderful.  They're easy to make.  You'll want to add a lot of cinnamon to increase the flavour.

Pretty good.  I substituted all of the butter in the batter with unsweetened applesauce and used egg substitute instead of eggs.  I didn't miss the real butter or eggs-the strudel topping made up for any lack of flavor.

These were really good. I had too much topping though, because I wasn't able to cut my butter in properly. Also, I cut my apples into too-small chunks. I might use 2 1/2-3 cups of apples next time (used 2 cups this time) since I think there could have been more. But everything else was great!

Very easy and super yummy!  I made these to take to work and everyone just raved.  I also used some of the batter to make a loaf-cake.  It turned out great as well.

I absolutely loved these muffins.  My mom liked them less, although she still thought they were good.  I definitely agree with the people who say ADD MORE APPLES.  I also doubled the topping and put half inside the muffin.  This was an excellent suggestion.  One thing I will say, is these took a long time to prepare.  I made twice as many muffins. And it took well over an hour to prepare.  But they are very good. I will definitely make them again.

I definitely won't make these again. The actual muffin had little flavor, and the topping didn't add much to them.  I ate about half of one muffin and threw the rest away.

I'm not sure if I messed something up- but these were very dry- and the "topping" had little to no flavor- not good will not make again.
Tried to make these a 2nd time...still awful. I so wanted to like these :(

Very moist and tasty...I also doubled the topping, but ended up using only 1 1/2 of that, found that it was alot for the size of the muffins. It ended up being just perfect! I think next time I will coat the apples with the topping, and add the rest on top (this is what I do for my awesome apple pie recipe).

This is a yummy recipe!  1 made a half recipe and it made 7 muffins.  I made a few changes that worked well.  I'm too lazy to chop the apples, so I shredded them and it worked fine (I used one large apple about 1 1/4 c. shredded).  I also added 1/3 c. of raisens.  A few dashes of apple pie spice really perked up the batter.  As most suggestions state, I made a full batch of topping and put 1/2 in the middle of the muffins--don't skip this step it's really important!  It was painful waiting on them to cook-the smell was wonderful.  My boyfriend was really impressed.  Thanks for sharing a great muffin recipe.

My 2 and 4 year old gobbled these up and asked for more.  I too took the other reviewers advice and doubled the topping and mixed it in the batter.  I will make this over and over.

I am a big fan of muffins and wanted to bake some last night, and all the great reviews for this one convinced me.  I did like some of you suggested and added cinnamon, nutmeg, and doubled the topping to put some in the middle.  The batter was so thick!  They turned out looking pretty nice and the topping was good, but I didn't think they were anything special, but my brother liked them a lot.  I think they'd be really good though as just muffin tops!  The batter was thick enough that you could just put a blob on a cookie sheet and sprinkle with the topping!

Had extra ingredients left over after cooking for our St. Pat's dinner so made up a batch of these.  Oh my God, my husband couldn't stop raving over them!!!  He loved them more than the apple pie, and he is a TOTAL apple pie freak!  Everyone who came over for the dinner left with a muffin as a 'treat'.  This morning, we went to the grocery store to get more supplies to make a couple more batches...one for us, and one for me to take to work tomorrow!  (also followed the suggestions to make extra topping to throw into the batter and it was good advice!)

These muffins were wonderful.  My husband thought I should have cut the apple chunks a little smaller.  However, he didn't seem to have a problem eating them.  I will make these again. I think I may change the topping though.

Excellent, excellent, excellent!!! I recently made these muffins for a breakfast at a school function for my daughter and it was such a big hit that I was asked to make them again for a bake sale the following week. Adults and kids alike loved these!  I too added more crumb topping. Everybody loves it!  Thanks!

These muffins are great! I had a bunch of apples I needed to use up, and this recipe was the perfect solution! They are full of flavor and have just the right amount of sweetness. Makes a big, beautiful muffin. Will definately use this recipe again and again.

These muffins were so moist and so easy to make.  My kids loved them.  I use a lot more crumb topping because we just love the stuff - but that's optional.  This was a good one - try it.

Overall, this recipe is great.  However, I found the batter to be very thick and added 1/2 cup of milk when I made them.  Also, I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg to the batter for added flavor.  These muffins are quickly becoming one of my favorites!

Great recipe - quick and easy, not to mention delicious!  I couldn't find my muffin tins so I made it as a cake.  While it took a little longer to bake, the results were fantastic.  It disappeared at work in less than two hours!  I would gladly make this again.

These were really yummy.  I added cinnamon to the dough for a little extra flavor.  I also had to add milk as my dough was super thick.  But the muffins are very good and turned out beautifully!

These are my new favorite muffins! I’m glad I didn’t read the reviews before making them because they were great as is. The only thing I may consider next time is adding extra apple. The topping was perfect, not too buttery and messy like some.  Will be making these again!

A little surprised at the 5 star ratings. This batter was much too stiff. I needed to add about 1/2 cup of milk to make it reasonable. I also added cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves to the batter. They came out well but folks should be aware that batter will need more liquid.

I really live this recipe and I make it whenever apples are in season. The strudel topping makes them different and really tasty. This recipe doubles and triples well, so very good to make for large groups!

Loved the recipe. I hate when people change a recipe to suit personal tastes and don't give  a 5 star for a great basic recipe.  I will double the topping next time for my preference,  but it was delicious. Thanks.

I made it just as the recipe said the first batch and they were great did decide to add cinnamon to the batter the next batch and we all liked them even more. I think it is just a matter of taste . I have to say if you change the about of flour and add milk like one reviewer did I don't think it is the same recipe lol. I also froze some for latter and they were just as good when defrosted.

These got rave reviews from the people I shared the muffins with. I made them with the baking apples I always use and these got a mixture of Macintosh and Spy’s since that’s what I had picked decided to mix them. I did do the tweaks that many had posted, and added some walnuts both in the muffins and in the strudel (which I used my go to recipe of 3/4 c sugar, 3/4 c Flour, and 6T butter).   It made 1 1/2 dozen of good sized muffins. I froze some  and just pull one out and set it on the counter to thaw when I have the taste for one!  They freeze/thaw great!

These turned out great! They are quite sweet but I made the mistake of adding the 1/3 brown sugar to the batter. I will definitely make these again, but without the extra sugar. They made very large muffins, nice and moist with plenty of apple.

Pretty good recipe BUT I prefer "To Die for Blueberry Muffins" -- would just substitute with apples, cherries, whatever.  Also the topping of the To Die for recipe is tastier AND it's a bit easier recipe than this one.    I did add nearly 2 cups of apples and baked in 24 mini tins.  If you do in minis, reduce cook time by 3-5 minutes as mine are a tad dry at the full 20 minutes.

These were absolutely amazing (with the tweaks I made)! Taking cues from previous reviewers I added 1/2 tsp. each of cinnamon and nutmeg, a dash of pumpkin pie spice, and 1 tsp. vanilla to the batter. I grated half of the apple and used the other half chopped(I used about 4 apples because mine were small). The muffins came out delightfully moist and so flavorful. The recipe made 12 regular muffins plus a small loaf pan, half of them were gone before the evening was up. I will definitely be making this again,  over and over.

I decided to make these with a few modifications I found in the other reviews. I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg to the dry mixture. For the sugar, I did half brown sugar and half white sugar. I also did 2 teaspoons of vanilla instead of what the recipe suggested. I put about 3 cups of apples plus one grated apple. Before baking I thought the batter looked a thick so I added a splash of milk. After tasting them, the flavors were great but I would probably grate all of the apples next time  simply because I don't like the chunks. I baked these into mini muffins because it is easier for my kids to eat. I baked at 375 degrees for 12 minutes. I still put the topping on them but they fell over the edge a little.  Overall the flavors are great!

After reading reviews, I added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg to the dry ingredients. I used three apples and shredded half of them. I ended up with a good amount of apple flavor and a nice distribution of large apple chunks too. YUM!

YES!  Excellent muffins.  Make them!  I took the hint and doubled the apples, put a teaspoon of cinnamon in the batter and by golly are they good.  Will keep this recipe handy for the next time, for sure.

The batter was really thick, so if that happens to you, don't worry! Otherwise, really good recipe. I had to use 1 and 1/2 medium sized apples. Totally would make again!

I’m only giving it a 4 bc I changed the original recipe a tad. In the beginning I halved the butter and substituted with coconut oil. I also added some cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg to the batter per other’s suggestions and chopped 1 apple and shredded another. The last change I made was sprinkling some of the toppings in the middle of the muffin as well as on top. Kids and husband LOVE them

Followed some other advice and increased the apples, grating about half of them, and used 50/50 white and brown sugar. Also added cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Moist and nice flavor.

Very good and easy. I used all the tips, including 1/2C brown &1/2C white sugar instead of a full 1C of white sugar. Added 1t of cinnamon and used both shredded and chopped apple. I opted to forgo the streusel topping to reduce the amount of sugar/sweetness. I’m making a second batch as a loaf of bread to which I added dried cranberries and used 1/2t cinnamon and 1/2t allspice. Hoping the bread turns out as well as the muffins ??

These are a great buttery muffin.  It definitely needs more spice.  I added another 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  I also reduced the white sugar by a 1/4 c given the strudel topping.

Selected this recipe for my preteen brother who wanted to make apple muffins on his school break. After reading the other reviews, I had him use a heaping cup of grated apples and one cup chopped. Also half light brown sugar, half granulated sugar. Added tsp of cinnamon as other reviewers had suggested. I had him divide the batter between ten muffin cups rather than twelve to get nice big, bakery style muffins. They were still  done after 20 minutes. I think he was happy with the results...I know I was, yum!

The batter ended up really salty. I triple checked my measurements and everything was correct. For some reason, the final product resembled more of a corn bread with soft apples. Definitely have to tweak this recipe with cinnamon in the actual batter and maybe omit the salt? The streusel on top was also a disaster, it caramelized and ended up being a solid layer of hardened caramel atop the muffins. Not sure if the 20 minutes was just too long or what, but the muffins I made also ended up with a hole in the middle. Will not be making again.

The recipe doesn't mention how thick the batter is and I thought I had left out a liquid ingredient until I read the comments.  I had to add a good bit of milk just to be able to stir it.  I added some cinnamon to it but they were still a little bland.  Next time I will do what others have said and use the brown sugar, add more spices, and some applesauce to thin it some.

I doubled the recipe and it turned out VERY dry. So I added 2 cups of milk. I also added cinnamon, cut the sugar in half and doubled the vanilla. I made it without the topping because these were for my baby. It turned out very well. The recipe needed liquid other than eggs and butter. I made them into jumbo muffins and cooked them for 35 mins.

This is a really good recipe with a few tweaks. I followed other tips and added cinnamon to the batter, I also doubled the apples and melted the butter for the topping. I added some oatmeal to the topping as well. I did find that they came out a little flatter than is normal for muffins. With the extra apples, they did require a full twenty five minute bake time. I will definitely make these again.

These are so good.  My husband, who isn't crazy about sweets, loved them.  Following recommendations in reviews, I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. fresh grated nutmeg, and I used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  I used two large Jonagold  apples, one chopped and one grated.  I didn't chop the apples too small, as I like to be able to see the chunks inside.  The recipe makes enough strudel for about 1 tsp. per muffin, which was perfect.  I will definitely make these again.  I might consider adding chopped pecans or walnuts to the strudel and/or the muffins.

This is a moist,  delicious apple muffin.  I did add some cinnamon and fresh ground nutmeg to the flour mixture.  I also shredded most of the apple, but did leave some chunks.  Baked first 5 min. at 425, to get that nice dome, then reduced heat to 375 for additional 15 min.   Finished with a maple cream drizzle.

I did not make this recipe as written; instead, I shredded two slightly small apples and diced another, and added cinnamon and nutmeg. I enjoyed the strudel topping, but would double or even triple it in the future so that there is enough for each muffin.

I made this it was amazing! But I added a couple of spices including nutmeg and cinnamon and more. These are my favorite muffins.

I have made this recipe several times now.  I grate the apples and mix them with the sugar, then let them sit as long as over night.  After mixing, if I feel the batter is still too dry, I add some applesauce.  Making those changes, I have never had a problem with dry muffins.  But really, those kind of changes should not have to be made if this were a 5 start recipe.  I skip the streusel topping because my kids tend to eat just that and leave the rest of the muffin.

I shredded the 1 1/2 cup of apples but didn’t add extra. I should have read the reviews first and added more shredded apple. They will be plenty sweet without increasing the sugar. Since I like cinnamon I added some to the batter.
 Next time I’ll add cinamon, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice to the batter. I like these spices.
I scouped out 18 muffins and baked them at 350 degrees for 20 mins and they turned out great. 
Definitely will add more shredded apples next time.

I followed the recipe exactly except for putting  the topping only in the middle of the muffins because it came out more like a filling than crumbs. It did leak out a bit so next time I’ll make sure to keep it more in the center.

First of all this is a great recipe.  The only changes I made were to add 1/2 teaspoon of apple spice and changed the sugar to 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar.  I also added some chopped walnuts and used 2 large gala apples chopped.   I did not add the strudel topping.   Just put a pat of butter on top and enjoy.

Delicious and easy! Took others suggestions and doubled the apples, it helped keep them moist. I’d also start by cooking for 15-18 minutes first and check them, once they cooled the bottoms became a bit dry.

Made the recipe as is. Thought it was pretty good, just thought the muffin itself could have more flavor. EDIT: 2nd time I made it, it turned out better. I used the suggestions of 1 tsp Cinnamon, 1/2 tsp Nutmeg, double the apples (used 4 apples - 2 shredded, 2 chopped), and 1/2 c sugar/1/2 c brown sugar in the batter instead of 1 full cup of white sugar.

Okay, so I made the recipe based off of the alternatives mentioned in the comments and it was DELICIOUS. I'm usually not entirely satisfied with my cooking but this was way better than store bought or any homecooked muffins I've had (excepting my mothers bran muffins..). Let's just say, give it a try with the suggested changes and you will not be disappointed.

I followed others suggestions of adding some spices, using half brown sugar, half white. These are OK. Not the greatest muffins I've ever had. I know, people get angry when people change a recipe and review it, but without the changes I made, these would have been 1 star.  I think they would be much better with apple sauce and banana added in.

I made all the changes that other users suggested - added 1 tsp of cinnamon, shredded half of the apples, and used half white and half brown sugar. The muffins are good, not great. They don't have a lot of flavor and are fairly heavy.

This recipe as written is ok.  If you follow the additions posted by other reviewers then they come out outstanding!!!   FYI altering a recipe the first time you make it and then giving it a review based on the alterations you’ve made is ridiculous.

These were sooo tasty!  I made 6 jumbo muffins instead of 12 regular.  I also followed the top reviewer’s suggestions of shredding 1 cup of the apples, chopping the other half, using 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1 tsp. vanilla.  I did not add cinnamon and nutmeg as I was out of them.  I cooked the muffins for 28 minutes and the let cool in muffin pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes.  I then carefully took them out of the muffin pan and let fully cool on wire rack.  I topped with powdered sugar.  I will definitely be making these again, maybe next time I will add some chopped walnuts.

To make this a GREAT recipe, must make the following changes: Change 1 cup sugar to 1/2 white & 1/2 brown. Add 1tsp cinnamon to the batter. Increase chopped apples to 1cup chopped & 1 cup shredded with any juice created. Moist and delicious! As my daughter says, “tastes like apple pie in a muffin!”

The only change I made in this recipe was to add cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter as other reviewers suggested.  I was making them for a luncheon so I doubled the recipe. Followed the steps as written. When I added the eggs the batter curdled and became even more curdled when I added the apples. Seemed too wet, but I baked 12 anyway. Took 20 min to bake. Tested one and it was gummy and tasteless. I tried adding more flour, but that didn't work either. What a waste of ingredients. Ended up throwing baked muffins & remaining batter away.  I have gotten many other recipes from this website that were absolutely delicious especially the brown sugar meatloaf and scalloped potatoes. This wasn't one of them.

These muffins are great!  I've made them a few times with different apples - gala, fuji & granny smith.  I definitely like the granny the best since they give more substance and zing to the muffin.  Easy to make and delicious!!

These muffins are pretty east to make and very tasty. My muffin pans are small so I ended up with 18 muffins. I used white sugar instead of brown and added 1/4 tea spoons of cinnamon to the flour mixture still they turned out great. They are moist and not too sweet. I added a table spoon of raisins and a table spoon of fine chopped walnuts to one third of the batch. The walnut and raisins taste great in this muffin too. I give this recipe five stars and two thumbs up

I followed the recipe to the T with only one change. Baked it in a cake pan decreasing the temperature to 160F and baking for 30mins.

I used a bit more apple and quite a bit more cinnamon.  They came out perfectly.  Thanks for the great recipe.

K this is my healthy version of this recipe in case anyone wants to make this but is like ugh sugar...(this is a one and a half version)  One of my kids doesn't like apple chunks and I don't use sugar in my recipes so I put all the apples in the blender with some extra for the "sweetener" also added a handful of raisins ...didn't have quite enough butter so added half an avacado to the blender, with the salt , used 4 eggs instead of 3 with some cinnamon, a bit of ginger and some apple pie spice.  I melted the butter I did have (about half a cup...) with 2 table spoons of honey...I used 3 cups of sprouted spelt flour  and just a sprinkle of baking soda, left out the baking powder.  added the blended goodies to the flour, added melted butter/honey and folded in until combined then scooped into the muffin tins making sure not to push down...for topping just took a bit of melted butter/honey (1 and a halfT each) with some cin and dribbled on top) came out fluffy and yummy all the kids loved them!

Just read another review that said these are very dry, I think why mine worked perfect was because the apple sauce and honey are obviously wetter then sugar, along with the extra egg...  I could tell when I was making them that I would have to be careful with the flour, not to do "overscoops" like I normally do.

I doubled the topping and probably should have doubled the apples too for additional moisture and texture. They were a hit though,with just the  recommended amount of apples, and will definitely make again.

It needed cinnamon and nutmeg. Got dry fast. The streusel topping was tough to place and fell off after baking. Not my favourite.

I did follow the other suggestions- equal parts white and brown sugar, and finely diced my apple- who has time to grate, LOL? The muffins were perfect.

This is a ridiculous amount of sugar..and that's something I never have a problem with. Use 1/2 the augar and itd be much better. Wayyyyy too sweet.

I added a 4 ounce cup of cinnamon applesauce, substituted half of butter with melted coconut oil(butter was just softened) and took the advice of others and added nutmeg and cinnamon to the batter. Also, used part white whole wheat flour. Yummy! My kids really liked them and the applesauce made the muffins very moist and the batter much easier to work with and spoon into the muffin tins. I was worried it may make them too moist, but I thought they were perfect.

This was very good. It was too much batter for just 12 muffins, but I decided to use it all in the one muffing pan, so they would be large muffins. But the tops flattened out, so either the apples were juicy or more flour was necessary to combat that.

So as a muffin recipe this is a no-go. Even without my happy mistake this would not have made good muffins. First I was out of eggs so I substituted applesauce. Plus I added a tablespoon of cinnamon. Then I accidentally added the brown sugar to the batter making this way too thick. But even before that mistake this batter was waaayyy too thick to make muffins. So what I had on my hands more resembled cookie dough, so thinking quickly, I used a cookie scoop and made Apple Cookies. I baked at 375 for 10 minutes.  They are absolutely delicious. My kids like having cookies for breakfast since that’s so much cooler than muffins.

It should be rated at 4.5 as it's an easy and tasty recipe that will be made again.
Because there are two of us, and also b/c I do not like to waste food, I always prefer to halve a recipe when making it for the first time.  The "adjust" feature on this site is extremely helpful.  Reading some others' reviews first, decided to amend a few things.  Some readers do not like when reviewers do that, but again, I don't like wasting any food so combine the features that seem best and then move forward.
Halving the recipe made 8 regular sized muffins.  Baking in a convection oven at 350 I checked at 18 mins., turned off the oven and baked another minute, then removed and allowed to cool in the pan 10 mins. before removing to a rack.  We love eating them warm and they were great!  Next time will remove from the oven at 18 mins. though.  Did give some away but haven't heard their reviews yet.
Here are the few changes made:  combined half white sugar with half brown sugar, and used a tad less than called for, as I always do.  Grated just a bit of apple first, then chopped the rest which made 1/2 cup.  Added one 4-oz. container of applesauce 'cause it was on hand, which equalled the 3/4 cup, although not sure that's necessary but some reviewers thought it too dry, which is why I don't bake the item as long as the recipe says.  Also added nutmeg and more cinammon.
They're just as tasty the next day too.
Thanks for sharing Nmariea!

Outrageously good. Reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup, half white, half brown sugar and added 1 tsp cinnamon to the flour mixture (because we love cinnamon!). Definitely a keeper!

Edited to add: Made these a little more “toddler friendly” for my little one by reducing to 1/2 cup dark brown sugar, using 1 cup white flour and 1 cup wheat flour, and adding about a 1/4 cup chopped walnuts, and a 1/4 cup oats. I omitted the crumble topping. I was worried they might be dry with adding the oats, but they turned out great! And I actually preferred them less sweet - more of a breakfast muffin.

I made these muffins for a pre-parade brunch. I used 3 small macoun apples  chopped and 1 medium shredded that were picked at a Terrace Mountain Orchard in Schoharie NY.  I also added 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to the batter. Put a 1/4 cup of oatmeal in the  topping with room temp butter. I used a pastry cutter to break it up well. Measured with an ice cream scoop into cupcake liners. This made a perfect dozen and just a little bit of topping left over. The liners were pretty full but they didn't bubble over. Baked these for 25 minutes as they weren't done at  20, may just be my oven. They were awesome, good flavor, texture with the chunks of apple.  Will definitely make them again!

I've made this several times already and have been happy with the recipe though I am making a few changes now that I am comfortable with the base. I halve the recipe and only make 6 muffins. Use .5 c whole wheat/ .5 c all purpose flour.  I grate the apple (also tried with grated pear once and grated zucchini another time). Sometimes I add extra cinnamon in the batter.  We like it.

Very dense muffins. Not overly moist even with adding half shredded apple. The topping was tasty. Overall they were ok.

Add 1/4 to a 1/2 C of apple sauce and it makes this dry recipe nice and moist. Much better this way! Also, I added extra spice and put it in the batter.  Made a bland muffin much tastier!

I'm glad that I read the reviews before making this. I decided to add 1tsp of cinnamon to the batter and used 1/2 cup brown sugar + 1/2 cup white sugar instead of all white sugar. When making the sugar topping, I only made half and used melted butter.  Lastly, I recommend that you check the muffins around 12 minutes because different ovens can bake them at different speeds.

I made 6 muffins that took 1 apple. The dough was rather dense, but it was super sweet. No complaints. I did add ground cinnamon to the batter due to habit. Great way to use up my apples starting to go bad.

Doubled entire recipe and quadrupled apples half chopped half shredded. Elminiated vanilla altogether and added Cinnamon and nutmeg to batter as others have. Also did half whitebhapf brown sugar as per others . Baked up twelve extra large Texas muffins just perfectly. Bake time at 375 was about 30 minutes for these large guys

Delicious, moist, and easy to make! My picky 5 year olds gobbled them up. I will definitely make these again. 
I grated the apple instead of dicing because the picky eaters don't like chunks. This really made the apple just melt into the rest of the muffin. I also added some cinnamon to the batter. Yum!

This muffin was kind of bland and definitely dry. I made this following the directions - but I added 1/3 c. shredded carrots and 1/3 chopped walnuts. I also used Granny Smith apples. There's not much apple taste, and the texture of the batter itself is similar to cornmeal. I'm not sure how I would boost the flavor (maybe cinnamon), but it definitely needs something. I also would recommend using the most-tart apple variety that you can find and find some way to make it more moist.

I let the apples sit in the sugar mixture for 10 minutes while I prepped the pans and dry ingredients. The topping was  really nice, and the muffins had a nice apple flavor.

I've made this more times than I can count, incorporating many of other reviewers suggestions. Please allow me to make a couple more. Now that I'm only working 3 days a week  on my days off I try to make a special snack for my grandkids when they get home from school. Hungry teens and friends. Occasionally I add a teaspoon of ginger and sub in some molasses for 1/4-1/2 the sugar. Other times I sub some bran cereal soaked in milk for a half cup of flour. Variety is the spice of life!

The first time I made these I found the mixture to be incredibly thick and dry...almost like bread dough...they turned out alright though...a bit dense and heavy but still very yummy. I just tried making these again today and discovered that I only had self raising flour rather than all purpose. So I used that instead and just left out the baking powder and soda etc. I also opted to use a tin of apples to save time but also hoped that the extra moisture from the tin would help the batter to not be so dry. I coated the tinned apples with cinnamon before adding to the mixture as my boys love cinnamon. I still found the batter to be quite stiff and dry so I added a bit of milk at the end till I had a consistency that was easier to work with. The result was incredible! This time round they were 10 times better with just those small changes...they were so light fluffy and moist and just melted in your mouth...absolutely delicious! I don't think I've mastered the art of the sugar topping though...so maybe I'll just omit that next time I make these...

I used 2 or 3 times as much apples as the recipe called for, and it was delicious! Highly recommend doubling quantity of apples. Also, per other reviewers, I used 1/2 cu. white and 1/2 cu. brown sugar, as well as added cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter. I didn't do the topping bc I made mini muffins, baked for 10-12 minutes & turned out perfect! With alterations, this becomes a 5 star recipe.

Great  muffins even with the brown sugar topping sinking to the bottom. I will try what one reviewer said to do, mix the flour and brown sugar well before adding the butter. My husband loved them even with the sink holes. Will make these again soon.

Family LOVED THESE! So MOIST! FIRST Attempt at Muffins, But, I needed to use the apples, that were starting to go bad (If there is 1 Spot, my family Will NOT eat a apple!). As Suggested I Tweaked the recipe, I used 5 Small Apples (3 chopped & 2 shredded). And did the 1/2c Brown sugar & 1/2 C sugar, instead of just 1c white sugar. I Also Added a tsp cinnamon to the dry mixture. And Melted the Butter used for the crumble at the end. Baked Exactly 20 mins. I Normally, don't prefer muffins, (just love the tops), but these are so Moist, that I ate the whole thing. The shredded apple just disappears and although I was worried the chopped apples were to big, they were perfect. The sweet crumble gives the muffins the perfect balance. Only Thing, I think adding nutmeg to the dry ingredients (in the muffin) would give it more flavor/spice (But, I was out). Still A DARN Great Muffin!! Will Be Making Again & Again.

Wonderful! These were the best apple muffins ever! I didn't have any white sugar at the time I made them, so I used my coconut brown sugar (available at Costco) and they were so moist! And instead of peeling the apples, I cut them and cored them, and started blending them in my blender with 1/4 cup of water. So tasty!!!

Wow - addictive!  I didn't have a whole stick of butter (only about 1/4 cup) so I added 1/4 cup applesauce. I used half white, half brown sugar. I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon, which I think is a must. I used my 3 of my favorite apple, Honey Crisp, and just stuck them skin and all in the food processor.  Thanks for the recipe!

Grand kids ages 4 and 6 helped measure ingredients, fill muffin cups and top with strudel. I used 2 cups of Crispin apples
 ( pretty soft), next time would probably use more. I added 1/4 cup milk to batter and it worked very well. This batch made 24 mini muffins plus a mini loaf. Everyone loved them. Would make again:):)

A good muffin recipe. It's quick, easy, and delicious. Per other reviewer's directions, I chopped half and shredded half of the required amount of apple. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter and a pinch of nutmeg. Soften your butter before cutting it in to the sugar mix. Also, bake the muffins a few minutes longer. With these minor adjustments, this muffin is worth a spot in a Paris bakery. Try it!

Like other reviewers the batter is very dry.  The recipe may rely on the apples' moisture to account for the lack of liquids.  But I added 1/2 whole milk, 3 eggs, and doubled the dry ingredients.  Then added 2 cups of chopped apples and pecans from a week-old Waldorf salad (which had had sour cream mixed in and no spices so it was rather dry). I lowered the temperature to 350, cooked it for 45-50 minutes and it was fantastic. Don't add all the apple pie spices or brown sugar  - this is not an apple pie.  Apples have a lot of flavor - I didn't use the topping suggested but there's where you can add your cinnamon and allspice if you want.  I always use parchment paper to bake so it also gives the crust a nice texture. I gave this recipe 4 stars for not using apple pie spices! Be sure and whip that butter well with the sugar - makes all the difference.

I made every reviewer change after reading over 50 of them, and these came out great! Changes: use half white sugar half brown, three large (honeycrisp) apples half shredded and half chopped, added 1/3cup regular applesauce,  added 1tsp cinnamon and 1tsp nutmeg to the batter, added oats to the topping, and sprinkled a little topping in the middle of each before covering with more batter. I'm eating the result right now, and I'll be making it again and again! (NOTE: these are super sweet, so you might want to nix the topping or add less sugar.)

Very easy to make. The batter seems dry, thick and sticky but give it a chance. They come out great! As far as revisions go, I substituted half of the white sugar for brown sugar and added cinnamon in the batter. Will save recipe to make again later!

disappointed my baking pan was covered in black char the muffins were black on the bottom. Maybe instead of spraying the muffin tins I should have used the paper cups. It said 375 but my oven is hot so I put it at 325 the  topping all melted off onto the baking tins I was planning on giving some to the people who live alone in my complex. I have made mufffins before but I must have done something wrong

Added cinnamon and nutmeg, made 36 mini muffins. Grated one apple, roughly chopped a second. Cut sugar to 3/4 cup but still very sweet. Will cut to 1/2 cup next time.  Definitely worth making with a few tweaks.

I don't have a muffin tin so I baked the batter in a 9" pie pan  @ 350 for about 35 minutes. Next time I might increase the amount of streusel topping, but otherwise it was a very tasty addition to our Sunday morning breakfast. Good way to use up a few apples that were past their prime. Also, I increased the amount of cinnamon in the topping because my family loves cinnamon.

Excellent muffins. I was surprised the "batter" was more like cookie dough. I also used about a teaspoon of cinnamon in the crumb topping.  YUM!!!

I did make some changes, but still - delicious! This is my new recipe for muffin dough! I would recommend using 1/2 vegetable oil and 1/2 butter if you want them to be soft and juicy for couple of days... The doughs made with butter only tend to harden when cooled...

Delicious, thank you for the recipe!  I did take the advice of reviewers who suggested adding more apples and shredding some of them, half white and half brown sugar, and adding cinnamon and nutmeg.   Had to hurry up and get some of them into the freezer or they would have been gone in one day, everyone loved them.  Loved the topping, I felt like that made them exceptionally yummy.  I'll be making these regularly for sure.

Like many others, I think apples belong with cinnamon, so I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon, ginger and cloves, as well as about 1/4 teaspoon of Chinese 5 Spice to my flour mixture.  I was worried that the dough was too dry, but after giving it a good mix, it was just fine.  I love the idea of putting the struesel in between layers of muffins, but was so hungry for them I just put it on top.   I will probably cut the amount of butter back a little in the future, but these really are incredibly tasty little morsels.

I think one needs the right apples for muffins.  When I lived in the US I used Granny Smith, but in Guatemala, while I can buy them in the market, the local apples right now are perfect.  They are sweet and too mealy for me to eat fresh, but bake beautifully.  

I want to thank all the reviewers out there for suggestions, ideas, problems created and solved and the ratings.  One thing I love about this forum is that while many follow the recipe straight (bless you bless you bless you) others go off the rails because of personal preference, experience and cultural differences.  I read reviews before I try any recipe and count on your experiences to make my food better.

Before I start, I wanted to mention that I only made one tiny tweak to this original recipe.  I changed the cinnamon from 1/8 teaspoon to ¼ teaspoon because I like cinnamon.  Everything else was followed exactly as written and this tiny adjustment should not have affected the issue I encountered with this recipe.  These muffins came out dry!  The first batch I made I cooked for 20mins and they were on the edge of being burnt on the bottom so the 2nd batch I cooked for 15mins.  They looked perfect but still so very dry.  In order to keep them from becoming rocks I sealed them in a Tupperware after they were cool enough to handle, but not completely cooled, to keep in some moisture.  I used granny smith apples, maybe if I used a different apple I would have different results but to be honest I don’t intend to pull this recipe back out.  I would look for a new one instead.  I gave this a 2 star rating because I took the muffins to work for the boys in the shop.  By the end of the day they were all gone so they were not so bad they didn’t get consumed… but I wonder if they were just too polite to point out the flaws.  For me, they were not worth the calories.

This recipe must only be rated highly because of suggestions in other reviews. I decided to try it because of its popularity but on its own, it is not a great recipe. I could tell that when I added the flour that there was going to be a problem with dryness but had hoped that the extra apples I put in would add enough moisture. No such luck. I did add a bit of cinnamon to the batter it really didn't change anything. These muffins are not horrible, they just aren't what you are expecting. Trust me.

1st time I've ever reviewed a recipe, but  these were DELICIOUS.   Of course I tweaked it - added spices , extra apples, substituted in some whole wheat flour and brown sugar, made them smaller, but the recipee is a good base.  A keeper

I use this recipe quite often and the results are GREAT! I am VERY picky about recipes using cinnamon. I love cinnamon but I don't like it when the cinnamon overpowers everything else. With this recipe, we can taste the apples and a hint of cinnamon in the topping. Outstanding!

Made these again with suggested changes, and they were excellent! I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the batter, and I also did 1/2 white and 1/2 brown for the sugar. I shredded 2 apples, which gave me just over 1 1/2 cups. Made 12 large muffins which baked for about 15 min.

I don't think I used the right kind of apples because this muffin just did not have a great apple taste. It was okay, but would pay closer attention to what type of apple I am using next time.

Following the recipe this does not make good muffins.  I added 2 cups of apples instead of the 1 and 1/2 cups, then added extra cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla for more flavor.  These muffins still came out really dry.  I feel like maybe adding apple sauce might have helped, or something to make it more wet.  I feel like 1 tsp of cinnamon is probably enough.  I didn't bother with the topping since the muffins were already really sweet with a lot of cinnamon in them.

I made it and it turned out amazing. The crumble is good and gives it more flavor. If you shred the apple you should squeeze some lemon on it because the apple won't turn brown. You should also put a lot of batter in the muffin cups. They will be big and good! These are the perrfect size for your kids or even for you. By the way, this is Belle and I made these muffins with my grandma. I love to cook and trying recipes from this website. This website rocks!!! Have fun making food!!!

Turned out great! Had tons of apples and wanted a good filling snack food. I added oatmeal to the streusel topping, bout 1/4 cup and just eyed the butter.

I followed the ingredients exactly but made 1/2 recipe to get only 6 muffins. No apple type is specified so I used Granny Smith apple which I had on hand. The muffins were easy to make and cooked up perfectly in the 20 minutes.  Texture was good and crunchy topping was scrumptious. The only thing lacking was an apple flavor. For some reason, the sugary cinnamon flavors take over the taste in this muffin. The muffin is very tasty but if you are looking for apple flavor, you won't find it here.

Made this in Germany, where their brown sugar is different, but it still turned out good. I had to substitute the baking soda for baking powder too, but it ended up being super good. I added an extra cup of apples, and I highly recommend doing that. It takes an extra ten minutes to cook, but it's so worth it! I had fun making these in a cinch with help from the kids.

Turned out well! I did have to change quite a bit due to what I had on hand. I used all brown sugar / substituted one of the eggs with a ripe banana, and added a bit of fresh grated ginger and a 1/2 teaspoon of molasses to the mix for more flavor and color.

The muffins tasted good, but the streusel topping came out burnt both times I made it.  (That might just have been me, though)  They also came out a little dry, so I'll probably add more water next time.

We used 1/2 whole wheat flour, and added 1 tsp cinnamon. Cut butter in half (1/4 cup) an increased Apples/applesauce as follows: 1 cup apples chopped small, 3/4 cup applesauce, also used 1/2 brown sugar. Softened butter into the crump topping till completely smooth. So good! We used mini muffin pan, about 13 minutes.

I halved the white sugar and it still came out tasting great.  I might add some cinnamon in the batter next time, but it was pretty good just having it in the streusel as well.  My 6-year old also suggested using apple cider instead of milk for a more apple-tasting muffin next time.

I did as Tunisianswife said and added (pumpkin pie) spice to the flour. Grated up the apple and for the topping  I added a little bit of pecans mixed up in the strudel mixture. I decided to make this into a coffee cake because  I did not have a muffin tin. Just add a little milk to make it cake batter-y. :) 
It turned out soft and moist! YUM!

I made changes as per another suggestion, put 1/2 tsp cinnamon in the dough but added 1/4 cup granulated sugar to the brown sugar for topping.  Also did 2 cups of apple cause that's what the apples I had made.  They were delicious and very moist......

Delicious! When I first tried making this recipe, I didn't have any eggs on hand, so I subbed then for 1/2 a cup of banana. I think that they taste even better this way! I added pumpkin spice instead of cinnamon, and a little extra vanilla (like I usually do, because I couldn't live without vanilla!) too. A lot of reviews said that this recipe was too thick. I do believe that it is thick, but once baked the consistency hasn't been a problem for me :)

LOVED these!! I too made a few adjustments. Grated half the apples and cut the other half. Put 1/2 white and 1/2 brown. I also added on little individual size cup of apple sauce (Motts style). I did make a little more topping and added oats...just because ;) These were a HUGE hit with the kids!! Thanks!

Good, but will work on it some more to get to our version of 5 stars.  
I halved the sugar and will decrease even more in next try.  
Grated 1 1/2 cup apples and will add another cup of cubed apples. 
Used 1 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup corn meal
It seems strong on backing soda/ powder so I will decrease that
Will add cinnamon to batter
Will add nuts to streusel

I'm giving this a 3 star rating only because I heavily modified it.  It's a good base but I was looking for something with more flavor.  

Per another review, I doubled the apples (and grated one), used 1/2 c white & 1/2 c brown sugar, added 1 tsp cinnamon in the batter.  I also used 2c whole wheat flour, a dash of cloves, 1/2 tsp allspice, and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  It made 6 jumbo muffins which I baked for 25 minutes.

I don't know that they could have turned out more perfectly!  Even my husband who doesn't care for spiced baked goods agrees!

I have made this recipe time and again and it is well loved by everyone.  I used the reviewers' tips of shredding half of the apples and chopping the rest.  I also use half a cup of brown sugar and half a cup of white sugar.  I like a lot of spice, so I added 1tsp of nutmeg and 2Tbsp of cinnamon to the batter. I also added some oatmeal to the topping.  Everyone loves this recipe.  When I have a lot of pears, we make a pear version, which is equally loved.

The batter seemed really dry when I began combining the ingredients. I even added about one extra cup of apples but it still seemed very doughy and thick. So I added a little cup of applesauce (about six ounces) and that helped. The muffins came out fluffy and puffed up pretty big, so the streusel topping basically fell off and burned to the top of the muffin tin. This wasn't my favorite recipe.

I won't make these again.  They require too many modifications.  I added 1/2 c milk, 1 t cinnamon, 2 T applesauce, and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  Still the muffin was not that favorful.

Wish I had read the reviews first. Still they were pretty good. I always make extra topping for muffins, in this case, I doubled it and it was just enough. I'll add walnuts next time. Nice little bursts of apple flavors were great. Recommend with some minor tweaking.

Although these muffins do take some time to make, they are totally worth it! My kids and their friends can't get enough of them neither can my husband or I, especially when made with Honey Crisp apples. Talk about total deliciousness, these take the muffin! Yummy!

Delicious muffins, and a great recipe! I did make a few alterations, which included adding more cinnamon and about a cup more of apples (because I like the "punchy" taste of each). I also had to cook the muffins for about 15 minutes longer, and would triple the strudel topping ingredients next time - there was barely enough to cover all 12 muffins.
Definitely will be making these again!

I followed the extra ingredients that Tunisiaswife (I think that's right) put in her review. I also added a half cup of caramel bits into the batter-yum!

I would have given these a 3, but our guests loved them, so bumping to 4. I'd try them again with a different apple - I used granny smith because that's what I had.

I thought it was weird that the batter didn't have cinnamon or brown Sugar so I decided to do some tweaking. They were delicious with the following:  1) I added about 2 1/2 cups of apples 2) I added about a 1/4 brown sugar and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. 3) The batter looked a little dry so I also added a little apple sauce for added moisture. The end result was fabulous!  They tasted great. Especially while they were still warm. The recipe is a great base but with a few additions the muffins really shine!!  I will definitely make these again!

Absolutely delicious! I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the batter. I doubled the topping and sprinkled some inside the muffin as well as on top before baking.

For me this are the best muffins ever. I even shared the recipe with my bestfriend. I always add more apples to it, because I love biting the pieces of apple. And cinnamon is definitely a most here, because it reminds me of apple pie so bad. I just love this recipe, and I will always carry it with me.

I usually cook with only brown sugar so I used about 3/4 brown sugar and no white. I also used more apples than was called for. Next time I make them I will spice up the batter too. Super moist & delicious!

Easy, tasty muffins - I grated 3 medium sized apples instead of chopping - gave the muffins great taste and texture with added fibre from the apple skin:)

I absolutely love this recipe, I have been making it for years. I do make a couple changes. I dice my apples first and then I sprinkle cinnamon on them. This way, cinnamon does get incorporate into the batter. Also, the batter is a very dry batter. To fix this, I add a couple tablespoons of applesauce to the batter to moisten it. This is definitely one of my favorite recipes!

I made these exactly according to the recipe (which currently does include cinnamon, so maybe the author edited it?) and they were great!  My spouse & I found them to be moist and tasty.

The muffins are fantastic. This is one of the first recipes I tried it's simple and sweet. Too bad I only baked 12 and I'm running out. I really enjoy this recipe and I'm planning to bake these soon :)

These muffins are light and not too sweet which I loved. I did not do the topping because I did not want them to be too sweet and they were perfect for me. I did grate one apple and cubed the other, but the cubes were too small and they just melted into the batter. The roof was on fire.

The first time I made these, I made jumbo size in a popover pan, also lining with parchment paper. I didn't change the recipe and they were great. The second time I made them, the mixture was very dry. Didn't use the paper liners either. Muffins were quite dense and dry. Made them again with added egg whites to make the batter more moist. They came out much larger and fluffier. At the time of this posting I haven't tried them yet, but they look great. I like the idea of grating the apple and will try that next time and also will do the paper liners as it seems to keep them more moist.

These were pretty good. Yummy enough but not outstanding. The only change I made was to substitute half the all-purpose flour with whole wheat. The crust was lovely; it crisped up in the oven, forming a cookie-like top that crunches ever so slightly when you bite into it. The inside was moist. 

CAUTION. I read a comment here that suggested buttering the muffin tin and pouring the batter straight into the tin without the use of muffin/cupcake liners. Apparently, it would result in a "crust" all around the muffin. Sounded mouth-watering, so I tried it. It was a complete disaster. Not only was there no "crust", but the muffins stuck to the tins despite generous oiling. Even when I ran a knife around it, it was so FRAGILE from the large chunks of apple in it that a few broke into half as I struggled to take them out of the tin. Just use a muffin liner and save the hassle. Your muffin will taste just as good.

Great recipe! What kept it from a 5 star for me was that the apples cooked out bc they are  mostly water. Next time I will add more apples and cut them into larger pieces. Also I found my  mixture was somewhat dry and resembled more of a dough than a batter so I added another egg. The muffins tasted excellent but I found them more dense than fluffy(I didn't over mix the ingredients so I ruled that out.) Next time I will add an additional egg for more fluff.  This recipe is definitely  going to be  one of my new "go to" recipes to wow my friends!

Really good recipe as is. I love the texture of chopped as opposed to grated apples for this application. These came out moist and delicious. I think I will make them again adding a little spice to the batter, and I have to remember to use colder butter when making the crumb topping. Came out more like a glaze this time because I used room temp. Oops!

I made these muffins this afternoon incorporating many of the suggested changes. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the dry mixture, shredded 1 cup of apples and chopped the remaining half cup, used 1/4 cup salted butter and 1/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce, and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup packed brown sugar. They are wonderful, and I wish now that I had made a double batch! Will definitely be making these again.

This was a great and easy-to-follow recipe! I made some muffins for my family. Everybody loved it. Instead of making the whole cinnamon mixture to sprinkle on top, I took a small amount of bread crumbs, a few drops of melted butter, and mixed it with cinnamon. That worked out great as well. Though the muffins were tasty, I feel that 1/2 cup more of chopped apples would have made them sweeter. In place of the all-purpose flour, I used pancake mix, and that allowed the muffins to turn out very soft and fluffy.

Delicious!!! I don't think I did anything different from the recipe the first time, and they turned out great! The second time, I shredded one apple and chopped the other. Amazing!! My hubby and other friends love it and asked for more :) will def do it again and again.

Excellent! I made a dairy and gluten free version, for my grandpa. I also omitted the topping to save calories.
-substituted 1/2c coconut oil for the butter
-used an all purpose gluten free flour
-grated half of a sweeter red apple and cut a granny smith into small chunks
-added about a teaspoon of cinnamon to the dry mix
-baked for 23min
-used Pam instead of liners, so the outside was a little crisp and the inside perfectly moist. SO GOOD!

Even if you aren't lactose intolerant, try the coconut oil. GREAT flavor! (very thick batter, was worried they would be too dense, but they turned out light and delicate, the apples add the extra moisture)

Will DEFINITELY make these again!!!

Some changes are necessary to make these work.  Like others doubled the apple half diced half grated and added cinnamon to the batter.  Also added a serving of apple sauce to the batter as it was super dry. I also did the half and half white and brown sugar.

I made this recipe without the topping and my daycare kids gobbled them up! They are now a regular snack. I haven't tried with the topping but I can't imagine that it would make them any less yummy.

made these yesterday.added cinnamon and nutmeg to batterthink they still needed a little more flavor.a little bland and dry.what a mess the strudel makes!! first batch it ran down the sides and stuck to cupcake papers,so half the muffin tore away while peeling paper off.2nd batch put strudel sparingly in the middle.this worked ok but defeated the purpose.not much flavor.3rd try I added more butter to streusel and melted then dipped muffin tops in after baking.gave it a beautiful glaze.if I make again I will do the glaze again and maybe add some applesauce to batter to make moister.

I chunky cut the apples, added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 cup raisins to the batter.  It came out excellent.  The other reviews were of great help because I think it would have been rather bland without the additional ingredients.

I thought the batter was too thick-- like a cookie batter rather than muffin/cake. I added about 1/2 cup apple cider. I added a dash of cinnamon to the batter. Finally, I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white instead of 1 cup white. Used 2 very tart Granny Smiths. Also cut 2-3 tbsp of butter into the topping which made a nice, crunchy, caramel flavoured topping.  The muffins were perfect-- light and fluffy in texture with a sweet, tangy and buttery flavour.

I've made this a few times. I tend to chop up apples right before they go bad and store them in the fridge with some cinnamon, nutmeg, and sprinkle of sugar. Then I bake them over the weekend when I have time. That's all that I changed, adding cinnamon and sugar to the chopped apples, and they were perfect! I have also made them before with some shredded apples, but I haven't noticed a significant difference by doing this. This is a great recipe, just needed some spice!

Loved this recipe.    I made it with 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar in place of 1 cup of white sugar.  I used macintosh apples and I doubled the topping.  It was delicious.

The muffins turned out awesome. I didn't really change anything, I just added 1 teaspoon of cinammon in the flour mixture and I didn't measure the apples, just used 2 big ones! I will definately do them again!

Very good recipe, tasting first batch right now and ow they're yummy. I changed the following: Added 2 cups of shredded apples (instead of 1 1/2 cups chopped), added 1 tsp cinnamon to the batter. Next time I will try with even more apples (maybe 2 1/2 cups). The consistency of the batter is great and rich with flavor. The topping is amazing. Thumbs of for this recipe! I will most certainly bake it again!

Definitely one of the best apple muffin recipes I've ever had, with some modifications of course.  My children and I made 2 batches yesterday, one with chopped walnuts and one without.  Nutmeg was added for flavor and we shredded 1/2 cup of apples and chopped 1 cup.  Baked for 15 minutes instead of 20 and they came out perfect.  The toothpick was clean but they were still moist. 20 minutes is definitely too long.

This was the VERY best Apple Strudel muffin recipe, with the modifications listed:  I used 2 chopped apples and 2 grated apples.  I added a little sugar and lemon juice to the apples and let them rest while I made the batter.  I added 2 tsp. of cinnamon to the batter.  I used 1/2 c of white sugar and 1/2 c of brown sugar.  When making the strudel, I melted the butter first.  I doubled the strudel and added strudel to the middle of the muffins.  

My family has been raving about the muffins all morning.  Can't wait to make them again!

My family loved these muffins. Changed to half white and half light brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg added to the dry ingredients. To increase moisture added 1/3 cup of sour cream. Used Granny Smith apples.  Baked perfectly for 20 minutes. Delicious. Will surely make again.

I've made these a few times, with good results. For me, the type of apple used really determines how much apple flavor shines through. I add 1/3 cup oats and an extra tbl flour in the streusel topping..yum. (Add extra butter as needed.) 1 teaspoon of cinnamon in the batter is good too.

I think there may be some typo's with this recipe.  
Add 1/2 cup milk (or applesauce) and 1 tsp. cinnamon to the batter.
Bake for 25 min. 
It turned out great!
I also added 1 banana, chopped, and it resulted in a delicious, moist muffin.

This was good.  I followed recommendations and added 2 apples (one shredded and one chopped) and 1tsp cinnamon to batter.  I needed to make them dairy free for one son so I added a small cup of apple sauce and 1 Tbsp of canola oil; the apple sauce may have been enough, though, with the extra shredded apple.  I also subbed the butter in the tooping with canola oil and it worked fine.  I also used 1/2 white and brown sugar.  I think I may try cutting back to 2/3 cup of sugar total as the extra apples/sauce gave extra sweetness.  Would be good with nuts, too.  My husband and boys loved these.  Thanks!

Hmmmm I seen all the great reviews so I figured I cant go wrong with this recipe! Boy was I wrong! I dont see what all the hype is about with these muffins! They didnt bake up nice they had a flat top mine even kind of sank in the middle they also were not as moist as I would have liked! I sprinkled mine with a little brown sugar,cinnamon and oats.I will not try this recipe again Im pretty bummed how they turned out!

I've made these muffins several times now, both following the recipe and making a few adjustments, and they are always delicious. I do like to use a little cinnamon in the batter in addition to the cinnamon in the crumble. The batter does end up being pretty thick, making it a little difficult to work with and spoon into the muffin pan. But overall, my family loves these muffins so this is definitely my go-to recipe!

Followed the recipe, but added cinnamon to the batter per reviews.  Would do half brown sugar if I made again.  Thought these turned out well, but perhaps just a bit dry.

Great recipe.  LOVED IT.  Nice and moist.  I just made the changes that tunisianwsife recommended.  Just next time, I would cut back a little on the nutmeg.  I also pureed two apples and incorporated it into the batter or just add plain apple sauce.  At the end, I added in the chopped apples.  Definitely without a doubt will make this again.

Followed the recipe exactly except I substituted brown sugar for white in the batter. I thought there was something wrong with this recipe as soon as I mixed it together. The consistency is like really sticky cookie batter not muffin batter. I thought they would be inedible. They were edible but the consistency is not pleasant. Very dry and dense. The topping was very good but I added more flour until I had almost a cornmeal type texture (like crumble for an apple crumble).

Great recipe aside from forgetting spices! I added 1 t. Cinnamon and 1/2 t. Nutmeg. I also substituted pureed pumpkin for the eggs (1/2 c. Pumpkin total) and added an extra 1/2 c. Apples. They came out great! Nice flavor and consistency. Could have been a bit sweeter, next time I will use 1/2 c. Brown sugar and 1/2 c. White sugar instead.

I looooove this recipe- thank you to all the reviews for suggestions otherwise it would have gotten 0 stars.  Like everyone else - ADD spice! I like a mixture of cinnamon, nutmeg & ginger. Sometimes I add cardamom too. I also use about 2.5-4 cups of apples, shredded and diced. Usually I add a small amount of sugar to the apples for extra moisture. Everything else is about right.  I do use VERY soft butter for the topping, creaming the sugar/cin mixture together and crumble on tops of muffins

Tried it based on all the positive reviews but I was very disappointed! I read several readers reviews and took many of their recommendations: I added extra apple (I/2 chopped, 1/2 shredded) and a container of Apple sauce, cinnamon and nutmeg. I added the topping as listed. Still they were very dry and bland. I will look for a different recipe the next time I crave apple muffins.

Absolutely delicious. Second time that I baked, I didn't have vanilla so instead I put cacao. I used only brown sugar and like other reviewers I double the amount of apples (but all shredded and chopped) and add 1 tsp of cinnamon to dough as well. They are simply yummy!!

Really dissapointed in these muffins.  Followed the directions except almost doubled the apples, 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, and added 1 tsp of cinnamon.  This made exactly 24 muffins (how anyone stuffed all that into 12 muffin cups is beyond me!). I doubled the crumb topping since it made so many muffins. The worst part of the muffin was the topping.  As soon as it was in the oven, it started melting and I knew it would be a mess!  It ran all over the muffin pans, between the muffin paper and the pan, and it burned! I ended up with burnt sugar surrounding almost every muffins.  Also, the paper will NOT come off of these muffins, they did not rise at all and are flat-topped, and they just look unappetizing! I end up scooping as much out as I can, eat those crumbles, and throw the rest away. Seemed like maybe some good flavor was there but the bits of paper and burnt sugar mostly masked that.

Tired this recipe twice and my family loved the muffins. The only change I made was using 1/2 a cup of sugar. This slight change did not effect the original recipe.

I LOVE this recipe even though I modified it (it's a great base for apple-zucchini muffins). Instead of 2 cups of all-purpose flour, I used 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat (Robin Hood's Nutri-Blend), tossed in allspice and cinnamon (I didn't measure...just dashed away until it looked like the right amount for my liking); instead of 1.5 cups of chopped apples, I chopped one Cortland apple and one medium zucchini. To save my sanity, I used parchment muffin paper. Before I sat down to eat my muffin, my husband asked me if I was going to make more. My picky 2-year-old ate ALL of his, so I'm happy he got some veggies in his system. I'm really thrilled with this recipe because I usually suck at baking!! :)

I made the recipe more or less from the instructions. I found it probably needed more apples but it was pretty good as is. I also didnt have butter so I used margarine which may have altered the taste. Will try again with butter next time.

I gave this a 4 star only because of the changes I made.   I used around 2 cups of chopped apples, added cinnamon to the dry ing., used 1/2 cup reg sugar 1/2 cup brown sugar and added half of a applesauce snack cup.  I also decided to skip the topping.

I am always looking for good apple recipes, since my family goes apple picking every year.  I used 4 cups of sliced/frozen apples and kept the recipe the same and got rave reviews from my husband and three kids. I think you could probably use 1/2 of the topping since I seem to have way too much.  But, this is the BEST apple muffin I have ever had.

My family has agreed to cut our sugar intake so I altered the recipe by cutting the sugar in the muffin mix to 2/3 of a cup and they still tasted amazing. the brown sugar and the apples make up for what we took out. The recipe is very simple to make. I choose easier recipes to teach my kids to cook (my 10 year old son made these).

I am NOT a baker.  These were easy and stress-free!  I followed pointers from others:  added 3 tablespoons of applesauce to batter.  I used Granny Smith apples.  I grated one and finely chopped the other.  I also added one teaspoon and cinnamon and one teaspoon of nutmeg to batter.  I used my kitchen aid mixer  even though frowned upon for muffins. I baked at 350 for 25 minutes (toothpick didn't come out clean at 20).  They are delicious and sooooo moist.  Thank you so much for this recipe!   It's definitely a keeper.

This recipe is so flavorful with some tweaking! But nonetheless, delicious!!! I added 1 Teaspoon Cinnamon and 1/2 Teaspoon nutmeg to the batter, and used the 1 1/2 cups chopped apple but added another 1/2 cup shredded apple. Will definitely be making these again!!!

These muffins are delicious!  I just made them and it turned out perfect!  I have a smaller muffin pan and made a total of 18 muffins!  I did as most reviewers said by adding a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg and half brown and half regular sugar!  This was my first time making muffins from scratch.  I'm proud of myself and my Husband is proud of me too!

These muffins are to die for! Love the idea of adding apple sauce to the wet ingredients and definitely add flavor with cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry ingredients. For my topping, I like to use a combination of 2 tbsp of melted butter, 1/4 cup of flour, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 3/4 cup of brown sugar.

I followed the recipe down to the T. They came out small, dense, dry and very crunchy. The taste was good, but they need more moisture and less crunch.

Delicious!! The only changes I made were to add 1/2 C brown sugar and 1/2 C white sugar, instead of 1 C white; also added 1 t of cinnamon and 1/2 t nutmeg to the apple batter. I did not shred the apples, just coarsely chopped them. These muffins taste like little apple pies! Yum!!!

These were so delicious! We decided these might be the best muffins we have ever made! We followed the review advice and used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar (instead of 1 full cup white) and added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I did have to cook a bit longer to get them done on the middle (extra 7 minutes). No big deal. Very moist and crunchy sweet on top--SO good!

I adapted this recipe to GF and it was fantastic!  Everyone in my family loved it, and couldn't believe it was GF.  My modifications were using Bob's Red Mill GF flour, increasing baking powder to 1 Tbsp, adding 1 1/2 tsp. xantham gum, and also pumpkin pie spice.  Oh, and I didn't have fresh apples so I used my homemade chunky cinnamon applesauce instead.  Thanks so much for sharing!!

Enjoyed this recipe a lot! Followed the recipe with many reviewers' tips; added one grated apple, one chopped, cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter, and used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  Tuned out moist and delicious! Next time, I will use 1 apple for grating and 2 apple for chopping, as I would enjoy more apple chunks in them.  Topping was delicious, too!  Loved a smoky caramel flavor of brown sugar on top of my muffins!

This was a huge hit with my family. I followed the direction but also followed the advice of another reviewer and shredded the apples. These muffins are moist with a very nice texture.

As the recipe is written, the muffins turned out unfortunately dry. Next time I would add more apples and season them with cinnamon and sugar and put in 1/2 butter 1/2 applesauce.

Very good.  Made the first fall day and the smell in the house was great.  The crunchy topping is the perfect way to top off the moist apples inside.

A very moist muffin! Didn't read the review but still added the cinnamon in which makes it so fragnant. One tablespoon of flour for the crumble wasn't enough for me though... added more flour to top the muffins completely!

Good general recipe.  Only change was 3/4 white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar, and a tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp cardamom.  I don't know what happened with the topping, though -- it didn't stay crumbly but melted.  Taste was fine, just the tops looked weird.  If I get to making these again, I'll try a different topping.

Very delicious. I used 2 chopped apples, half brown/white sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, and also a mashed banana just because I had a ripe one I needed to use. They were very moist and flavorful. It made 12 huge muffins.

I am gluten free, so I used 1.5 cups of gluten free flour and .5 cup of coconut flour. I also had some apple brandy so I put in 1 tablespoon and about 1/2 cup more apples (just because I cut them up). My family LOVED them I only got to eat two (they are not gluten free and usually what I make is safe, they do not like it)

Tasty and moist. I only added 1t cinnamon to the wet mixture, and changed to 1/2c white sugar and 1/2c brown sugar. White sugar would work fine if you don't have brown. I always prepare wet mixture first when baking, to allow for all ingredients to come to room temp. I used 2 med. Fuji apples, peeled and diced in very small pieces, which came to 2c apples. 1)In a medium bowl, mix apples with sugar to allow them to macerate while preparing other ingredients. In a small bowl whip up to 3 eggs (for extra moisture) with vanilla, as if you were 
whipping scrambled eggs, then add to apple mixture. Mix in 1 t cinnamon, and blend well. 2)In another bowl, sift flour and dry ingredients through a wire mesh food strainer, and blend well. Make a deep well in the flour mixture, and add the wet batter, mix together well. 3)I always use my hands when making crumb topping, smoothing out any hard lumps of brown sugar. 4)Use cupcake liners if you have them, rather than greasing the pan. If your oven tends to run hot, turn temp. down to 350. This is a very good, basic recipe. You can add raisins, chopped walnuts, or use a few over-ripe bananas in place of apples the next time around.

Probably not going to try this one again.  The muffins were terribly dry and bland, not light and fluffy at all.  The crumble topping was ok.

Its a good recipe but a bit plain, so I spiced it up a bit more to my taste. I upped the spice by adding 1/8 tsp cardamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the batter. I also increased the topping a little bit as well as upping the cinnamon to 1/2tsp. I also made it gluten free. I used 1/4 cup gf oat flour, 3/4 cup sorghum flour, 1/2 cup rice flour, and 1/2 cup tapioca starch. I also added 1/4 tsp each of xanthum gum and guar gum. Its still a bit to crumbly and next time I will up the xanthum gum to 1/2 tsp. I love baking muffins and this one is a keeper for me with the changes I made.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! The batter is a bit thick, but it turns out light and fluffy. The batter actually tastes like cookie dough (besides the apples) and when they're finished they are AMAZING! My family loves them ^o^ For the crumb topping I used 1/4 of a teaspoon instead.

Muffins were perfect. Of course I added more apples and cinnamon but they were moist and delicious. We make them for every camping trip.

I truly enjoyed this recipe but I definitely had to do some tweaking to make it just right, I added about a half a cup of brown sugar to the batter, a half cup of 100% apple juice and a tsp. and a half of apple pie spice to add some more flavor!

Tried all the suggestions: half white sugar, half brown sugar, doubled amount of apples, 1 tsp. of cinnamon, also added 1/2 tsp. of all spice and a couple of Tbs. of olive oil for extra moist muffins. Additionally, I pre-shaved and chopped the apples the night before and soaked it in 1/4 of the sugar. Result was very moist muffins; personally for me, it was too sweet (perhaps because the apples I used were sweet enough already) but to my co worker, she absolutely loved it and wanted me to make it again.

I just baked these delicious muffins, everyone loved them at home. They taste and smell wonderful!
The recipe followed as instructed turns very dry, so I added extra milk to make it right... next time I will try adding raisins.

Yummy!  This is a very good recipe to adapt, you know how us cooks are, we just can't help ourselves, haha...  I read the reviews and liked the idea of putting the topping in the middle as well as on top, so I did that.  I didn't add cinnamon to the topping/filler mixture because I had some Cinnamon Flav-R-Bites from KAF that I stirred in after I had added the apples.  I didn't stir in the apples until after I had combined the butter, sugar, egg mixture with the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt mixture.  I also added a dash of milk in when I added the flour mixture to make it a little bit more moist.  The neat thing about this is I got to use the very first apples from a tree that our youngest gave to me for Mother's Day two years ago.  Sweet.

Replaced both eggs with 1 cup unsweetened applesauce, increased baking soda & powder both by 50%. Used 1.5 cups wheat flour and .5 cup unbleached all purpose, added some cinnam on to the batter. Delish! Also used coconut sugar in place of all the sugars and reduced the sugar in batter slightly

Ok firstly USE CUPCAKE CUPS...it will stick to the pan otherwise. This cake is coffee cake dense and not very moist. I added apple butter, cinnamon, and nutmeg and the flavor was great. The crumble topping is DELICIOUS! Needs a lot of apple butter or sauce to lighten this up because its far too dense and dry. Might try this again.

Made sure all ingredients were at room temperature and just about doubled the amount of apples.  AMAZING!!  Made for parents at my daycare where I work and they all loved them.

These muffins were great!  The batter was a little dry, and I had to add some water, but otherwise, I followed the recipe.  The muffins came out moist and delicious.  I'll definitely be making these again!

5 stars with changes.  I doubled the amount of apples.  I used 3 Gala apples and shredded 1.5 and chopped 1.5 apples.  I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I softened the butter a little.  Excellent.

I made an account just to compliment this recipe. It's simple, and easy to make. I've never had a batch of these muffins not turn out. When I make these muffins, they never last long lol - people LOVE THEM!

The only thing I do different is add walnuts and 2 cups of apples instead of just 1 1/2.

well I added milk and 1/2 cup of apple/mango sauce they are cooking right now, they look good.  Probably should learn to read reviews though cause Im pretty sure they should have had some cinnamon in them!  Oh well, hope the kids like them!  BTW ran out of muffin paper so made a loaf with more than half of it...let ya know!

This recipe is delicious. Just the right amount of sweet and apple! It is refreshing to eat an apple muffin that is not overpowered by the tste of cinnamon too. I did not change anything.

I liked it, but it was extremely think, similar to cookie dough. I added about 1/2 Cup of milk, and also added 2 tsp. of cinnamon to the batter. They turned out fine. I really think the flour needs to be reduced, or just add milk. They were nice big muffins. I might leave off the topping next time, and just sprinkle lightly with cinnamon sugar. Will make these again.

These muffins were so yummy!!! I added 1/2 t. each of nutmeg and cinnamon to the batter, used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar,  added 1 c. chopped apples and 1 c. homemade applesauce from this site, only used 1/4 c. of butter. Next time I will put some of the topping in the middle as some others have suggested.

I followed Tunisianswife advice and OMG ... perfect.  They were gone within the day!  So, First I shredded all the apples because my boys are fussy. Then I poured the sugar on top of them and put them to the side.  I sift my dry ingredients as I pour them into the bowl... and don't over mix.  I added a few tbls of apple sauce and just 1tsp of vanilla.  For the crumble I put 1tsp cinn and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  The batter was so easy to work with ... and so yummy.

I LOVE these muffins!!! I always double the apples - half chopped, half grated. Using half brown sugar, half white is also excellent. I usually skip the strudel topping because they're perfectly sweet without it and can be eaten for breakfast.

I made these muffins and they were great.  I took some of the suggestions and added spices.  Other than that I made the recipe as is with the exception that I used only 1/2 the butter and substituted he other half with plain applesauce.  They were wonderful and we saved a few calories and a little fat.

These muffins were great-- not dry, and the crumb topping really adds that extra professional bakery taste! I cut back on the white sugar by a quarter, and it still tasted sweet enough.

Agree with most reviewers that the batter needs some added spice -- maybe some cinnamon and nutmeg. Otherwise, tasty. I adapted them to be GF with a standard GF flour and xanthan gum. Tasty and moist but not heavy.

my 3 year old woke up saying make muffins momma, so I found this recipe.  It was so good she ate muffins all day.  I also added 2 heaping tablespoon of cinnamon applesauce (was all the applesauce I had)to the butter mixture and also added table spoon of cinnamon to the flour mix i used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar also and they are DEEE-licious as my toddler said. THis is a keeper!!  :)

Made without topping and was very soft and delicious. It was too sweet for me even though I used only 1.5c of sugar. Next time will make again with even less sugar.

Yum! These muffins are delicious! They are sweet, but not overly sweet, which is something I often look out for. They are very simple to make and take close to no time at all. My family loved them and I will definately be making them again!

Thanks for this great recipe and to everyone for their reviews! These muffins were delicious! I also, like many other reviewers, added 1/4 cup sugar to the apples before to leach the juice out. I used 4 small gala apples and chopped them all. I also added about 1 tsp of cinnamon to the batter and some quick oats to the streusel. Absolutely WONDERFUL!

Good but not as big of a hit as banana muffins with crumble topping.  I altered recipe per others' reviews (half brown sugar/half white, double apples, add cinnamon).

Good recipe, but with some slight modifications. Definitely too dry so added 1/2 cup apple cider.  Added cinnamon and nutmeg to the mix, used brown sugar instead of white sugar, then topped the muffins with crushed candied walnuts instead of the strudel topping.....I got lazy!  Family loved them, and they were gone before they even cooled.  Will definitely make again when I have a surplus of apples in the house next fall.

These were the best muffins ever with a few modifications I made and I am not exaggerating. I did use 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar. I added 1/2 c. chopped and roasted walnuts. And I also added a little cinnamon into the batter. I also added about 1/4 c milk because the batter seemed very thick. Delicious.

These were good. Needed a little more spice to it. More cinnamon and maybe a little nutmeg. But they were good and will make again with a few additions for my taste.

Wonderful. Fresh apple taste & struesel topping gave just enough spice.  The second time I made them, I let the butter soften first and they seemed slightly drier than the first batch, so I shan't do that again.  Made them two days in a row, so good.  Didn't bother paring the skin and it added some interest to the muffin.  Thanks!

Excellent recipe!  I made bread instead of muffins (it made one loaf that took @ 40 minutes to cook) and it turned out VERY moist and flavorful!  It was also very forgiving...I didn't have the full half cup of butter on hand, so I added the last couple tablespoons of some homemade applesauce (with no oil to compensate for the missing fat either).  I used macintosh apples as they are in season -- 2 cups chopped and an apple and a half grated to add moisture.  I added 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg per other reviewers suggestions, and no strudel on top to keep it healthier.  It was so, so good!  Thank you NMARIEA :)

I was in a hurry and didn't read the reviews. I thought it odd as I was filling the tins that it didn't call for cinnamon in the batter. I did notice is was too dry, and added a bit of milk and some sour cream before I poured in the tins. The muffins tasted good. I gave less stars because there is no way this recipe would have worked without additional liquid.

These were good with modifications suggested. However my topping didn't crumble well, it just kinda turned into dough. I had to add more flour and then it ended up a little hard. Will try a different method next time.

This recipe was easy to follow! Loved that I had most of the ingredients at home so I didn't have to run to the store! I would add 1/2 cup more brown sugar to the apple mixture and then 2.2 cups of small chopped apples. 1 1/2 cups of apples is too little! Other than that it was great! Thanks for the recipe!

Just made these. Wanted to make something with apple that had a short baking time (in a bit of a rush). I made these as writtten. I was concerned at first because, as others have stated, the batter is a bit stiff. Although tempted to toss in a little milk, I decided to proceed as written. 
Very please with the results! The muffins were moist, no tunnels, and great tasting. I like vanilla in my baked goods and the 1.5 teaspoons worked well.
One thing the recipe does not mention, is letting the butter come at least close to room temperature. Not a must, but makes the creaming easier. 
I will make these again. The only thing I might try is adding a little more apple. Only because I really love the apple bits. I hope it will be as good. 
Thank you for posting this recipe NMARIEA!

Moist, not-too sweet, and keep easily for a few days. The topping didn't turn out as expected, it almost caramelized on top, but it was still quite good and smelled amazing. Worth a try!

Easy recipe. Out of the 3 people that had these muffins fresh out of the oven, 1 thought it was a little dry, and 2 thought it could be a bit sweeter.  We added 2 cups of apples instead of 1.5 cups, and I still thought we could've added a bit more.  Loved the crumbly sugar on top of the muffin. Definitely will make these again.

Best muffins ever - with a few caveats.  I used half brown, half white sugar and added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter.  After the batter was mixed I realized it was very think - like a cookie dough.  I added about half a cup of sour cream and about 1/4 cup of applesauce.  This made the consistency perfect. These are very sweet and obviously, not healthy, but they are oh so tasty.  I would probably add another half cup of apple next time.

Very good but I would add 1/2 cup of sugar, and 1-1/2 teaspoons on cinnamon.  If you doh't use juicy, soft apples,you do need to add some applesauce.

These muffins are just perfect I took all the advice into consideration. I used half brown sugar and half granulated sugar, 1/4 cup apple sauce, 1 1/2 cup shredded apples and 1 1/2 chopped apples, 1 tbs ground cinnamon, ( I like the strong flavor of cinnamon with apples), 1/4 tsp nutmeg and a dash of ground cloves and they turned out perfect, everyone in my family loved them.Thank you for sharing the recipe and thank you all for your great advice.

I'm sorry, but these muffins, made as written... were just not good. Too bland (as another reviewer suggested: where is the cinnamon?). I was not impressed at all. The texture was very dry, as well.

I read many of the reviews (which always cracks me up because it's like "I found this great recipe but I changed this and this and this isn't it good?" By that time it must no longer be the original recipe really. Ha! Anyway with that said...) and made some of the alterations advised by them.  All I have to say is YUM!!! I will be making this again and again.  My daughter loved them too so a winner recipe.

i love these muffins! my husband is pretty particular about his baked goods and he loves them :) i followed the recipe pretty close but added a 1/4 cup apple sauce. the strudel didn't turn out the best and i would probably make more to top them off. overall very good very moist.

Great recipe, I will give it 4 1/2 stars if it was possible, I only gave it 4 stars because it needs to be adjusted but once its adjusted to the member's reviews suggestions it comes out great. I added 2 Tablespoons of ground cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg to the batter. I also added 1 cup of shredded apples and 2 tablespoons of apple sauce. 
Note: do add all the flour, I was surprised too that the batter was really thick, but they come out really moisture and yummy once they are baked.

Have made these several time and it never ceases to amaze me just how delicious they are! Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon & 1/4 nutmeg to batter. Used 1/2 sugar, 1/2 brown sugar, and 2 cups cup apples. I always use super ripe apples! Occasionally add chopped walnuts or oats to topping!

My main complaints are that the muffins weren't very moist and lacked spice besides the topping.

The only thing I liked about this recipe, was the foundation that didn't use milk or a milk replacement (I replaced the butter with coconut oil). I only used 1/2 c. sugar for the muffins themselves, 1 egg, 1 tsp of vanilla, added cinnamon and nutmeg, and applesauce instead of apples (these last three I eyeballed). For the topping I only used 1/4 brown sugar and added in 1/2 chopped walnuts instead, but didn't use any flour. I can't give a high rating when I changed so much and mine came out delicious (of course this is if you don't mind lack of sweet)!

I doubled the recipe and somehow got cookie dough, so I made them as cookies. They came out really well though! Instead of sprinkling the topping on top, I rolled each cookie in the topping.

YUM!  This has become my go-to apple muffin recipe.  My kids love these, beg me to make them with the apples we harvest from the tree in our yard. Totally concur with: increase apples, add cinnamon and nutmeg to batter, adjust to half brown/half white sugar, batter looks really thick but is perfect, and streusel topping is too voluminous for one batch.  Also, loved the idea to add some of the sugar to the chopped apples to help bring out their juices.  I will try that, and perhaps also grating some of the apple next time.  4 stars as written, 4.5 with my changes and with the sugar-juiced and grates apples, likely a 5 star recipe.  We do love the amples chunks of apple in our muffins, though!  ENJOY!

These are absolutely delicious!  We had tons of apples from our backyard tree and ended up freezing batches of them.  I used frozen apples but would not recommend them.  The frozen apples left holes in the muffins and they didn't look so good but they were still great tasting.  Added walnuts to one of the batches because we love walnuts and they were good but not a huge improvement on the original recipe.  We froze the muffins for Thanksgiving morning.

Made these twice because the first time they climbed out of the muffin tins and made a huge mess.  The flavor was good so I tried again but added cinnamon, took away the paper cups, and lowered the temp.  Success, they came out muffin shaped :)

These are fantastic Muffins, and are very appealing to the eye! I made some of the changes from the other reviews, and I agree that the added cinnamon defiantly is what is missing from the original recipe. I also added a little more apple than the recipe calls for. Every time I make these for guest when they come to visit, they always ask for the recipe before leaving. Very Tasty!

The leaves are falling and changing color.  Fall is in the air, so why not in your muffin? I was looking for a fall dessert and found it here. 
I brought this delicious apple cinnamon muffin to school on Halloween, and everyone was more than happy to take them off my hands.
Perfect for a a cool morning alongside coffee, or a late-night snack with milk.  These easy-to-make pastries just shout autumn.  
I will definately make these again.

I loved them, I tried my best not to eat any, but what kind of chef would I be if I didn't taste my own creations! My 4 boys loved them and are taking them for snack tomorrow. My oldest wanted them so bad he got up this morning to walk to the store for butter, lol.

Very moist and tasty.  I did not use any spices as I am not a fan really.  Did not peak... perhaps my baking powder is on its way out.  I did cut back slightly on the sugar as I added crushed caramel pieces.  Simply delicious.  Also, I used have all-purpose flour half cake.  Will make again.  Perhaps add more apples or try shredding half next time. Also I will let it cook a few minutes before adding topping to prevent sinking. Thank you for sharing

Turned out great! I only substituted the 1/2 cup butter for 1/2 cup of margarine and it still worked just fine. I ended up baking them for 25 minutes. Moist and yummy!

These muffins are amazing. Super moist and flavorful. I did add more cinnamon and nutmeg but other than that followed the recipe exactly. I like another reviewers suggestion to make them in mini muffin tins without the topping for the kids. These are a little sweet but they are very yummy! They last about 2 hours in my house. O

This was a good muffin recipe, even though I had to cut it in half, thanks to a bad apple!  I added a little cinnamon to the batter, otherwise i made it as written.  It was a bit too sweet for my taste, but that could have been from my apples.  I will make this again, loved the topping!! thanks!

These were so tasty & tricked my picky daughter into thinking they were cinnamon muffins (ok, well maybe I "forgot" to mention the apple part).  I grated 2 medium apples (so there were no chunks) and used 1/2 c. white, 1/2 c. brown sugar as others did.  I only had 1/4 c. softened butter so I put in about 1/2 c. applesauce.

These muffins are fantastic!  I did make some modifications as per some suggestions (I used half granulated sugar and half brown sugar, added a tsp of cinnamon, and doubled the amount of apples).  Plus I left off the topping.  I took them to work with me this morning, and everyone loved them!  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I’ve made this as is, it was nice. Shredded a medium apple, tossed with cinnamon sugar and stirred into batter and continued as directed, baked in jumbo pan, excellent. Stirred cinnamon sugar and Craisins into batter, proceeded as directed, baked in mini muffin pan. Shredded an apple tossed with cinnamon sugar, stirred into batter with handful of craisins, baked in 8x8 square as a coffee cake. This recipe is very flexible and delicious. One of our go to favorites.

Very yummy, I grated the apples and they really blended in very nicely. The kids just loved them. I didn't even make the sprinkle topping. The kids couldn't wait. mmm and they smell just fantastic. Thank you !! I always have these ingredients in the kitchen too!

My husband loves these, and he is a very picky eater. I sometimes make them in a mini-muffin pan.

I also doubled the apples and chopped them super small. They were a huge hit with my husband and family... but just "okay" to me. There is another blueberry strudel muffin recipe on this site that I thought was much more moist and would do great by substituting the blueberry with apples. I personally would give it 3 stars... but since I got such rave reviews from the family... I will give it 4.

These were fantastic tasting.  I did add a cup of crushed pineapple from the can including the juice just because I had it. I would do it again. The only comment I have is they didn't rise nicely like the picture.

Now these are tasty! I followed the other suggestions and added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter. I used half brown and half regular sugars. I also grated one apple, and chopped 2 others, not sure how many cups this was, but it was perfect. I ended up with 17 muffins, but still didn't use all the crumb topping. These were so so good. I can't stop thinking about them. I am wishing I hadn't taken them to work and had just kept all of them for myself. I will be making these again for sure.

These were easy to make and so yummy!  The only change was that I used 1/4 tsp of cinnamon for the topping. My husband said that these were "the best muffins ever!"  Will be making these again this weekend.

I have been searching for an apple muffin recipe for a long time.  And now I have the best one.  The first time I made this recipe I forgot the flour for the topping and just spread it on top directly out of the oven.  They were great!  I realized the second time that I forgot the flour and made sure I used it.  It didn't come out as good so I will stick  to my version.  I also add cinnamon to the muffin batter and extra apple.  I shred my apples instead of chopping them.  These are the best muffins I have ever made.  They don't last long with my friends.  Once they know I have made muffins they are over and ready to eat!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Wonderful!  Extra moist with a little apple sauce in there.  Definitely add some spices to the batter--at least a teaspoon of cinnamon and maybe a dash of nutmeg!

This is the first time I have ever baked something in my life and it turned out wonderful. My wife loved it. I added some cinnamon to the dry mix. This recipe is very easy. The secret is not to mix the batter too much. Just enough to put everything together. I will try it with other flavors as well. A WINNER.

Turned oout great.  Made 12 smaller muffins for my little ones.  The batter is more like cookie dough though, so had to be creative about getting into muffin tins.  Also, I added cinnamon to the apples and stirred to coat, just for added cinnamon flavor.  I cut back on the butter to 1/3 cup and added a little milk for moisture.  Will definitely make again!

I thought these were ok. I did replace the butter in the batter with oil. They weren't very sweet and were a little dense. Don't get crazy; we ate them and did like them! However, I don't think I will make them again.

WOW! I can't believe how good these muffins are! I did add some oatmeal flakes to the topping mixture, and a tbsp extra of melted butter for the crumble on top. I was afraid when I saw how flaky the mixture was before I put it into the oven...it is not suppose to be a batter! I took a chance and baked it, and oh my goodness, they are delicious!!! thank you!

these muffins will make any ones mouth water. I did change a few things though. I added a half tsp. of nutmeg and i only used 1/4 cup of butter. and added 1/4 cup of milk. as for the topping it came out good but as a tip less is more it runs off and turns to hard candy on your muffin tin. These are a new hit in my house.

They were good, but not wow.  They did not taste very appley...  1 1/2 cups of apples amounted to 2 apples, I think a 3rd apple might of given it more apple flavor.  The batter was thick, so I added about 1/4 cup of apple cider to thin it out, but still, not very appley.

These are good. I added cinnamon to the muffin batter, 1/2 c whole wheat flour, and more apple. I also baked as mini muffins to reduce the fat and sugar per serving. They're not that pretty.

Delicious; my 12 yr old daughter made these all by herself.  We chopped one apple and grated another and did 1 tsp cinn and half tsp of nutmeg as another reviewer suggested.  It was great right out of the oven.  Only problem was that topping "ran off" some and so wasn't as crunchy on top as picture shows.  Perhaps from overfilling cupcake tins.  Next time would add a third apple but overall this was still excellent!! Will definitely make again  : )  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  Homemade muffins are so much better than store-bought ones.

Delicious!  We used the apple pears from our tree and it came out perfectly!  No need for the strudel, tastes perfect the way it is!

I read the other reviews and I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter, which was a good idea. They added so much flavor to the muffins! Then instead of 1.5 cups of apples, I actually used 3 cups, which enhanced the apple flavor. Overall, great recipe! The muffins turned out moist and delicious.

As it is, this recipe is lacking. Similar to other posters, I had to do some serious alterations to the original recipe to get the muffins to turn out close to how I was hoping. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white, used 3 apples (1 shredded, 2 cubed) added allspice and cinnamon (to taste) and only 1tsp of vanilla. The crumb topping also needed much more flour (1/4 cup) and more cinnamon otherwise it melts and does not stay...crumbly. This recipe can turn out OK, but you do need to do some serious tweaks!!

These were very good.  To make a bit healthier, I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 country crock.  Also 1 cup white flour 1 cup wheat flour.  Good even without the strudel topping, but it does give it an extra kick.  Would make again.

These are excellent! I followed the recipe exactly and did find the batter to be very dry when mixing it so I just added a couple splashes of milk to moisten everything up and they came out great.  I don't find these overly sweet at all. I would add more apple the next time as that's my favorite part. :)  Great recipe!

Came out very good, I used a potato masher on the apples and it worked well and also got out a lot of juices that won't come out from just chopping. The only thing I would change would be to add spice to the batter, and maybe rolled oats instead of flour to the topping

I made these tonight for a shift meeting at work in the morning.  I did make a few changes.  I shredded some of the apple and chopped some of the rest.  Took the shredded apple, put it in a fine strainer and put ¼ c. sugar over it to macerate them.  Then I added the chopped apple and put another ¼ c. sugar over it.  It takes out A LOT of moisture.  I then added ½ c. Brown sugar for the rest of the white.  FOLD in the ingredients, DO NOT STIR!!!  Don’t overmix either.  I also added another ½ c of applesauce to the mixture.  THESE ARE AWESOME!!!!!

I made all the suggested changes: used 1 grated apple, 1 chopped apple, added cinnamon to the batter, did 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white.....and honestly I found these REALLY dry....like have to add butter or take a sip of coffee after each bit.  Disappointed, but my husband liked them because they were so sweet.

They were a bit on the dry side, maybe because I altered the recipe too much. I used oil instead of the butter and added extra apples. And I substituted Splenda for the white sugar. I will try to make this recipe next time following the proper instructions

Excellent! Added the cinnamon and grated half the apples. Other addition here was toffee bits to the crumble topping on half of them to try it... mmmm! Would work nicely for the cake someone said they make with this recipe too. Oh - and my 8 year old daughter added chocolate chips on top of the other half so we could tell them apart. I couldn't bear to curb her creativity. If you like chocolate, they were surprisingly good!

I tripled this to use up some apples, and while very good, the recipe as stated didn't have enough liquid - I added about 1/2 c (per recipe) of milk to get the right consistency; also added nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves.

This was a good recipe to start with.  I wish I would have read the other reviews first about how to make it more moist since the original recipe created a super thick and unmoist batter.  I added a tablespoon of vegetable oil as well as some milk and that seemed to help.  I also added 1 t of cinnamon and 1/2 t of nutmeg.  I doubled the amount of the topping and added some chopped pecans to it.  They turned out delicious!

Awesome, delicious, easy! I added some walnuts and oats to the topping, adjusted the measurements, and put em in the food processor, but I'm sure it would've been amazing just the way the recipe is written. Honestly, some of the bet muffins we've ever had.

i've made these 5 times already this fall...and they are always delicious.  i don't measure the apples...i just use whatever i have left over (usually 4-5). i've made following recipe exactly, i've made it with only brown sugar (didn't have white) and i've made it with only white sugar (didn't have brown).  they always turn out great.  if i have both sugars, i like to use 2/3 white and 1/3 brown in the mix...i also add cinnamon to the mix if i have it.

Oh My were these AWESEOME!!! I made them exactly as the recipe was the only change I made was I didn't measure the apples I just used 3 normal sized apples. They were wonderful & I don't think that a change needed to be made what so ever! It filled the house with a wonderful aroma too!! My hubby couldn't wait for them to come out of the oven & neither could I! Absolutley wonderful recipe!!! I will be making lots of these, we love them for a quick breakfast!! One of my favorite muffin recipes!! The strudel topping made exactly enough topping for all my muffins too unlke some recipes where you have way too much & don't know what to do with the rest! I just love this one, thanks for sharing this great recipe :)

This was great.  I made all of the suggestions that everyone else made, but to make it healthier, I replaced 1 of the cups of flour with whole wheat flour. They tasted great.

The strudel didn't turn out like it's supposed to, but these muffins were still a very tasty treat.  A great way to use up those apples in the fall.  I used Honeycrisp apples.

I agree with the majority on these muffins-- they're delicious. A great way to get rid of the surplus of apples I seem to collect during the fall. I did add cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice to the dry ingredients and about 1/4 cup of apple sauce to the moist. I also doubled my apples which tallied to about 4 honeycrisp apples. The strudel topping was not the best that I've had; I felt it was too "sandy", so I will try something different next time. All-in-all this was truly a great recipe!

These are excellent, followed the recipe exactly, except I had about 2 cups of chopped apple.  Will make again and use Splenda in place of sugar.  I coated the chopped apples with sugar and cinnamon (my husband and I like lots of cinnamon) before stirring into the batter.  I made 6 jumbo muffins so the bake time increased 25 - 28 minutes.

I don't see what the fuss is.  I doubled the apple (shredded half) and still didn't think it came out very moist.  I don't think I'll make this again. It's okay - but not worth the calories in my opinion.

These are great, but they make more like 18 muffins.  I haven't made the strusel topping yet though since I've been serving them with supper.  I added some spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.  Great, thank you!!!

This is really good!!  When I beat my butter, etc. I melted the butter in the microwave and mixed the three ingredients with a whisk, then added the remaining ingredients.  These tasted wonderful, and were gone almost as soon as they came out of the oven, and made the house smell great.  I highly recommend these as they are not very difficult or time consuming.

I followed the suggestions of other reviews and added 1/2 tsp of each cinn. and nutmeg, I also added more apples (about 4 medium honeycrisp apples total).  I think I messed up something with the topping because it did not turn into what that picture up there looks like.. it was still delicious though! I also used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I would also suggest using the double layered muffin paper.  The apple juice is very sticky and may make the muffins difficult to remove from the tray.

I made some modifications, namely doubling the amount of apples and spicing up the batter with cinnamon and reducing the amount of streusel on top. The muffins came out very tasty. A little on the sweet side for my taste so I will probably reduce the amount of sugar next time. Otherwise, a great muffin recipe. Thanks!!

I replaced the flour with whole wheat, decreased the sugar to half (used 1/4 cup brown, 1/4 cup white), and used applesauce instead of butter. I grated about 1 cup of the apple and diced the rest. I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg to the batter, and did not use the topping. The muffins turned out really good and are much healthier than the original recipe.

With the modifications others suggested, these were wonderful. I used half brown and half white sugar, used two apples and added 1 teaspoon cinnamon to the batter. I made them for the new neighbors next door, and I was really glad I made them rather than buy them something from the store.

Delicious!  Added a 1/4 cup of walnut chips.  I made them on Monday, and had one for breakfast everyday this week.  They kept very well.  Just wrapped one in a paper towel and warmed it for 15 seconds in the microwave, and it was a tasty breakfast!

overall it was a nice muffin, but it needs something. maybe some lemon zest?? not sure. but my son who won't go near apples or anything that grows in nature, LOVED them. he had no idea apples were even in there bc i chopped the apples pretty small. :) i will definitely make these again.

These were so yummy. Everyone in my family loves them. I made a few adjustments though. I only used 2 tbsp of butter for the muffins, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also shredded half of the apples and chopped up the other half and added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the batter. So tasty

I used 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 AP. I didn't use butter because I was lazy. Instead I used 1/3 cup canola oil. I shredded my granny smith apples and even threw in some left over shredded zuchinni. Added some cinnamon & nutmeg but omitted then nuts (boyfriend doesn't like them). I added some old fashioned oats to the topping to make it crunchier. Over all I am pleased with this recipe.

I used some of the suggestions by lizzieshome 1/2 whole wheat & 1/2 reg flour also tried shredding some of the apple amd included the cinnamon and nutmeg.  I think it turned out fantastic.  The only thing I would do differently would be to include some nuts-at least in the topping.

These were tasty.  I used margarine in the topping, which I think made it a little more oozy than butter would have.  All in all quite tasty.  Thanks!

This is the best muffin I've ever made!! It hits every flavor note...buttery, sweet, cinnamon, vanilla, a touch of salt. I used Granny Smith apples. This one deserves 6 stars!

Very moist! SO moist in fact, I had to cover the tops with aluminum foil and cook an extra 10-15 minutes just so the bottoms wouldn't fall apart. I took the suggestions of the other reviewers and added cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter. My strudel topping came out wrong, i think its because I melted the butter before adding so it didn't crumble correctly, no biggie I put some apple butter (also from this site) on top and it was delicious! Will be making these again and definitely using paper cups next time as well.

We just made these and Wow are they great. I added cinnamon to the batter as well and used medium size muffin papers. We actually got a total of 18 muffins. Next time I will use the large and fill to the top to make over size muffins. The toppoing is delicious! Becareful not to get it on the sides of your pan (it sticks) My darker muffin tin took less time than my old light coloured one. They actually seem a bit moister in the darker pan.

These muffins are wonderful! I gave it 4 stars because I used some of the changes noted here - I chopped 1 cp apple, shredded 1/2 cp, used 1/2 cp brown and 1/2 cp white sugar, added 1 tsp cinnamon, a pinch of salt and cut back vanilla to 1 tsp. I've made them several times but this time also added about 1/4 cp of chopped pecans and that really made them. They're a definite hit with my new husband.

I made this recipe exactly as it was written and these muffins are delicious! My husband said that they are quite possibly the best he's ever had! I may experiment with adding some spice to the muffin batter next time but they are still good just the way they are!

With the adjustments mentioned of adding nutmeg, cinamon, and vanilla these are great. However, I would NOT reccomend using brown sugar for the strudel! It turns into a sloppy mess and doesn't have as good of flavor as if you use white sugar!

I have an apple tree and needed to find a good recipe for my abundance of apples - I think I found it here - I've made at least 6 batches so far - I always get raves !   I did follow some of the other reviews suggestions and put cinnamon in the batter and grated the apples - at least 2 full cups!  Makes the batter much moister as well muffins - I use the larger muffin pans as well ! They freeze well too !

Warning: the batter is VERY Stiff, use two spoons, one to scoop, the other to scrap the batter off the first spoon. They were worth the effort, though I think it could use a bit more kick. I'm thinking I'll try adding some applesauce and a little more cinnamon next time. It's a great recipe though, very versatile to taste I think.

These were good, but mine came out dry.  I did take the suggestions of others and use 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar.  I also added 1 tsp. cinnamon to the batter.  And I added 1 c. chopped apple and 1 c. shredded apple.  I would make these again, but I need to play around with the recipe to get a moister muffin.

These were really good.  We picked apples at the orchard yesterday and needed some new ways to use them.  I did use 1/2 white & 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I also added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter. I put them in the oven for 5 minutes, took them back out and then added the crumble.  They were perfect.

I thought these were very good.  I did add 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the batter and baked the muffins for 25 minutes.  I'd make them again.  NEW - Did not feel like making muffins, so I just made this as a loaf.  I dropped the temperature to 350 degrees and put the batter into a 9 X 5 inch loaf pan.  Baked it for about 1 hour 15 minutes.  It was very good!!

These were very good, especially hot from the oven. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added 1 t. cinnamon, used 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar, and shredded the apples. They did not have a strong apple flavor but I like it that way.

These were pretty good, although I thought they could be a bit sweeter. I followed the recipe for the most part, except that I doubled the streusel topping amounts and grated the apples. I made these into 12 huge muffins. Next time I will add some more sugar to the batter.

This recipe was great with all of the recommendations people gave! I added  1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and cinnamon and it made them so much better.  I also didn't have light brown sugar but i think the dark brown sugar was so much better because it tasted like molasses.  instead of 1 cup of white sugar i did 3/4 cup of white and 1/4 cup dark brown.  I also added an extra 1/2cup of apple and left the apple pieces big enough so they didn't get lost in the batter.  There was a perfect amount for 12 cupcakes too. These were amazing but i gave it four stars because i made a few changes.

Excellent recipe! Really yummy, easy, comparatively healthy if you consider each muffin (24) contains just over 1 tsp sugar & 1 tsp butter.   The reviews have to consider the differences in apples: moisture and sweetness and taste. I used baking apples from our trees. These had been pre-cooked with a little cinnamon and frozen. So I measured exactly 1-1/2 cups thawed. I also added a dash of nutmeg to the batter. Followed suggestion of 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/2 c white sugar.  I got 24 muffins, exactly the size of reg muffin cups (no muffin tops).   The recipe was EASY to make. Put the butter, sugar, eggs, vanilla and apples in a food processor. Pulse. Add dry ingredients. Scoop into paper-lined muffin cups, use the food processor to mix toppings into fine crumbs. The topping was exactly the right amount for 24 small muffins.   You can reduce amount of butter by using 50% unsweetened applesauce, pears or bananas. I've tried these with Graham flour (fantastic!) and oat flour.

Very nice!  I did end up adding some extra cinnamon to the batter itself for a bit more flavour; and did end up grating about 2/3s of the apple to more evenly incorperate it and the flavour (which isn't overpowering at all, could even use a bit mroe or some apple sauce if one chose to do so) through the batter.  The batter is quite thick; but the muffins come up wonderfully; quite light and moist, and the crumble topping (which I put some rolled oats into as well) was divine.  Easy to make; even with the kids; and was a hit with everybody; will absolutely make this again..

Moist and flavourful. I used 100% whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour as well as added a bit of cinnamon to the flour mixture before mixing. Above-average, definitely.

Wonderful! The batter is sweet enough to still be a muffin, but the cinnamon struesel topping adds just a little extra dessert-y feel. I DID add some cinnamon to the batter too, just to make sure the muffin and its topping go well together.  I love them. Thanks for the great recipe!

I think this is a great base recipe that you can adjust to your taste. I read the reviews and added additional spices to the batter, grated apple, added 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt plus added oats to the topping.  These were GREAT!!!!

I made these as written and they were okay, though fairly dry. Perhaps next time doubling the apples would help.

YUM! YUM! YUM! YUM! YUM! These turned out amazing following the recipe... and though I was doubtful adding 2 full apples (the second time in one week) kicked this recipe up into nirvana!  My boyfriend was even prompted to comment enthusiastically!!!  My neibors keep knocking on my door, suddenly I'm pretty popular in my apartment building. (and I dont even cook.)

This recipe would have no flavor if prepared as written.  Like other reviewers, I added cinnamon and nutmeg.  Next time I'll chop the apples more finely as I didn't really care for the apple chunks.  I forgot the tip about using 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar, and my muffins seemed to have something missing.  Next time I'll definately follow that tip.  These definately have potential, though.

I added 1 t. cinnamon. The batter was really thick, so I also added 4 t. milk. For the topping I substituted, 4 T. butter, 4 T. packed brown sugar, 6 T. flour and 6 T. rolled oats.

Wow, after all the "these are so moist" comments, I was surprised to find them a little dry.  The taste was okay, but I'm thinking I need to try again with different apples.  Don't know if it will help, but I'm not ready to write this recipe off, yet.

I made this recipe two times last night- once using a coffee cake pan, the other using a muffin tin. Both came out pretty ugly, but really yummy.  They were better the next day, after the humidity softened the streudel topping; when it comes straight out of the oven, the topping was crunchy.

This was an O.K. recipe. I added about an 1/8 of a tsp. or less to the "coarse crumbs."To that I ended up putting in a little more butter, also. The topping deflated the tops and the dimesized apple chunks that we used were to big and took up more than half the muffin! They also "bubbled up " in the middle, making for less muffin. Was very moist, but over all VERY GOOD! I would GLADLY RECOMEND THIS RECIPE TO A CLOSE FRIEND! :)

The muffins were pretty good, I added a tablespoon of All-Spice to give them some extra flavor. The topping melted all over my stove though. I suggest placing a cookie tray under the muffins while they cook.

I wasn't pleased with this recipe at all.  I followed the directions exactly as is.  The muffins didn't raise well at all (and my baking powder and soda are both new), and the topping made them fall in the centers.  We couldn't taste the apple, and they were rather bland.   I think with more apple, more spices, and possibly more flour they might be better - but that would be an entirely new recipe.

Very easy and yummy!They stay nice and moist too. The only problem I had was they overflowed my muffin pan. It makes 12 so I don't know what I did wrong. Next time I will hold out some batter to put in my smaller pan too.

These were tasty, though I may keep looking for the 'ultimate' apple muffins. I make fresh muffins and such for my husbands crew each week and had some gorgeous Okanagan apples to use. I did 1 1/2 shredded, 1 1/2 chopped, cut the sugar to 1/2 cup (plenty sweet!), and sub'd apple sauce for the oil. Without the doubled apples I think they may have been too dry? I added some quick oats to the topping. Nice warm with butter :)

I can't say how good they were because I made a batch and my guests ate them all up. My husband said they were were really good, so I'll definitely be making these again.

I made some of the changes the other reviewers recommended including shredding one apple and dicing one, adding cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter a couple shakes of each, and doubling the topping and putting it in the middle of each muffin.  It took them about 25 minutes to get done.  YUM, YUM, YUM!

These muffins are a big hit in our home. My mother in law asks me to make these whenever she visits and my sis in law has had these sent to them. They come out perfect every time and I have always followed the recipe except substituting oil for the butter sometimes.

Super YUM!! I did tinker with the recipe by adding half white sugar and half brown, I also added raisins soaked in the vanilla and a little bit of orange juice.  They were fantastic and beautiful.  They are very dense not a typical muffin but very tasty and delicious all the same! Great recipe!

Absolutely love these.  I didn't change a thing and they were perfect.  I love the way the topping caramelizes and becomes kinda crunchy.  They come out very rustic looking and inviting.  I can't imagine anyone being disappointed it they made these.

Very delicious.  These muffins were moist and the strudel topping was sweet and tasty.  I used 1/2 tbsp cinnamon for the topping and added another tbsp to the muffin batter.

Great muffins, and easy too!  I followed others suggestions and used half brown sugar, half white sugar, and one teaspoon of cinnamon. I didn't measure the apple, just used the two I had on hand.  I will definitely make these again!

After reading the other reviews I decided to add the cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry ingredients. I loved these muffins! The strudel topping really made them great. I already want to make them again.

Yummy...the fabulous smell that fills the kitchen is just great. 2nd time made a little adjustment with added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of white sugar, double the apples, half-grated n half-chopped Granny Smith. Turns out beautifully and taste great even without toppings. Made into mini muffins, just handy for kids.  Thks for a great recipe NMARIEA.

Made as recipe stated, but did add more apples.  Used red delicious and jonamac for flavor. These muffins had no taste at all.  Will not make again.

My muffins were a little dry.  I did sub applesauce for the butter.  I think next time I will add the butter and use 1/2 cup applesauce.  I HATE dry muffins!  I may grate the apple next time instead of having chunks also.  I don't know maybe this isn't the muffin for me!  Update: I used my dry muffins to make Gramma's Apple Bread Pudding from this site.  Wow-so good.  Such a great combo.  Sooo if you have leftover muffins that are not edible, but not spoiled-make bread pudding with them!

mine were a teensy dry, but i wonder if it's just my oven.  i should have done 18 minutes, i think.  however, the flavor is Great!  esp. with the added cinnamon, nutmeg, and brown sugar.  i will definitely make these again in the fall and cook them a bit shorter.

These muffins are awesome. I used 4 golden delicious apples. I shredded two of them and chopped the other two. I also used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter. I also double the topping.

Yummy with a few changes. After I grated the apple I added 1 t. sugar and let them sit for awhile then squeezed out the water. I also added 1 tsp. nutmeg and 2 tsp. cinnamon to the batter as recommended by other reviews.

DRY. In spite of adding an additional 1/2 cup of non sweetened applesauce to the mix.  I did as others suggested and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white and an addition of 1 t. of cinnamon to the mix.  They add a nice flavor but I like my muffins moister.  I will try again but will add more applesauce and perhaps some yogurt to help the moisture content.

These are fantastic! The topping is very sweet and crumbly (I think I might halve it next time as the muffins themselves are already very sweet). 
One for keeps! Yum Yum!

Tonight after dinner, my husband had a sweet tooth and my 4 year old had been wanting me to make him muffins.  So, I thought I would kill two birds with one stone.  I made these muffins and my husband said they were the best muffins I have ever made.  I agree with him totally as did my 4 year old.  I followed the recipe to a tee.  A keeper for sure.

Very yummy! I used whole wheat flour for the batter and the topping. Also added cinnamon, nutmeg and about 1/4 cup applesauce. Probably will put more applesauce next time for more moisture due to the wheat flour.

Just got done making these.  They were easy to make and Wow! does my house smell good right now! My husband who doesn't like things overly sweet, loves them. I kinda think they are a little bland but I think once they sit overnight, they will be tastier.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just made them---yummy!  I used granny smith apples and coarsely chopped them so you get a good bite of apple in each muffin. I made a few changes too, added cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter, also nutmeg to the topping. I also used half and half whole wheat and white flour and cut my sugar to half in the batter.  With the topping, it was plenty sweet enough and I don't like overpoweringly sweet things.  I find a lot of times you can cut the sugar and it tastes fine (or maybe even better).  Next time I'm going to add walnuts. I made these for gifts but I'm having a hard time staying away from them myself!

great recipe!  I made the recipe as written, although I doubled it, and it was delicious...I did have extremely thick batter and just added applesauce to get everything stirred in.  I also made the recipe with TUNISIANSWIFE's suggestions, also very good.  Great recipe to tweak and play with depending on your mood.  I used gala apples and they didn't have much flavor.  Think I'll do granny smith next time.

These are so good! Gave a 4 bc I modified the recipe... 1 chopped and 1 grated small red delicious apples, 4 heaping tbsp cinn applesauce, 1/2c white sugar, 1/2 c light brown sugar, cinn and nutmeg added to the flour mixture. I made 36 mini muffins which came easily out of the pan which was sprayed with baking pam. they"re soft, moist, and the chunks of apple throughout are the perfect touch! I'll be making these over and over again. Great additions would be walnuts (next time I will def add these!) raisins, dried cherries or cranberries. Dont hesitate to make these.. your family and friends will love them!

Awesome recipe!  I used this recipe to test on my apple pulp that was remaining from my juicer.  I replaced 1/4 cup of the butter for 3/4 cup of apple puree (apple pulp processed in food processor).  I also replaced 1/4 cup of the white sugar with brown sugar and I added approx 1/8 cup of pecan chips to the topping.  My husband said that these were the best apple muffins he's ever had!!!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Delicious!  I made a half batch which actually made 9 muffins instead of 6.  I opted not to make the strudel topping, but these muffins are so good they can stand alone.

these are so good! the nutmeg really makes a difference.i made it with the adjustment of 1tsp cinamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.i made one without the apple and it was still good. then i made one using apple pie filling that i heated over low heat with at least 1 tsp cinamon and one heaping tbsp of sugar. for both of these i didnt make the topping and they were delicous.

Probably the best muffin I've ever had.  Chocolate chocolate chip is a close second but gets stale quick.  Everyone keeps asking for this one.  I also added extra cinnamon to the batter and shredded half of the apple.  It really does melt away.  The only problem I've had with this recipe is the strusel topping tends to slide off the muffin while baking.

These muffins turned out alright after adjusting the recipe according to other reviews .I replaced the fat by using unsweetened apple sauce and I also added frozen raspberries .I tossed the apples in cinnamon and the vanilla before adding to recipe .

No need for bakeries with this simple and delicious recipe. 

I might add another tsp or two of flour to the topping, since mine looked like just brown sugar. Looked and tasted great anyway.

I made these just like the recipe--I agree with another review--add some cinnamon and nutmeg and maybe shredd some apple would improve it to 5 star.

These muffins were delicious! Nice and soft, great flavor. I followed the suggestions of other users and added some cinnamon, which was great, and some nutmeg, which was not so great. I think the nutmeg gave it too much of a kick for myself to personally enjoy so next time I make them, I will skip the nutmeg.

I plan on making these as Christmas Gifts for my employees.  I made a test batch using the exact measurements, but I used 2 large Red Delicious Apples; Next time I plan to use a different, sweeter apple.  I had enough to make 8 Texas size muffins.  The cook time was 20 minutes (MAKE SURE THE OVEN HAS THOROUGHLY PREHEATED). I made few without the topping and found that those lacked that sweet punch I was looking for. Those that had the topping were AWESOME!!! I will be making these for the gifts.  They are great.

These are awesome. First time I made them I followed the recipe, but added cinnamon and nutmeg to batter. Second time I used no butter, just applesauce and yogurt. I also used 1/2 whole wheat flour and no crumb topping. Turned out great.

This recipe is great after a few alterations. Once you add some cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice you are then on your way to some fabulous muffins! I also chose to simply sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar rather than top with the streudel, but I bet they'd be great with it!

I just made these muffins and they are wonderful. This was my first time making muffins so I followed the advice of others and grated one apple to go along with the chopped. I also added a little cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice to the batter. Next time I think I will add some raisins to give the just a little more flavor.

These were really great! I followed the advice of other reviewers and added nutmeg and cinnamon to the batter and used three apples: one grated, two chopped. My only problem was that I cut the apples a little too big and the muffins were too soft where each huge chunk had been. Next time, I will cut the 2 apples in to smaller pieces (about quarter inch size?) and still use 1 grated apple. I also doubled the crumb topping! Yum!

This was a great recipe, the texture is very nice and the taste is wonderful.  I replaced 1/2 cup of the white sugar with maple syrup.  The maple syrup gave it a very nice flavor.  I used a grade A amber.    My husband is a true critic and loved them.

I too used the recommendations of TUNISIANSWIFE and the flavor came out fantastic!!  The shredded apple with just a few chunks is the perfect combo (and mixing with the sugar first really did pull out a lot of liquid to get mixed in).  HOWEVER, when I pulled the muffins out of the pan (used paper liner) there was a yellow liquid in the bottom and the paper was drenched.  I soaked it up but when I peeled off the paper, the muffin was all suck to the inside of the liner.  Not sure what I did wrong.  I will try again without liners and see what happens.

I made these muffins using the suggestions from "TUNISIANSWIFE" (02/10/2006).  They were delicious.  They were definitely the best apple muffins I have made and the house smelled fantastic.

Good muffins but a bit greasy for me. Reduce the butter by 1/4 C. and sub applesauce and you are sure to have 5 stars.

Like most people I added 1/2 cup of applesauce, as well as a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon to the dry ingredients. With these added extras, I would definitely give these muffins 5 stars. Very soft and moist - and the topping is spectacular. Will definitely be making these again.

Very good as is.  I used 6 tablespoons of butter and added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the batter. I also stirred the apples in last. They were moist and delicious.

I was not crazy about these muffins, they were very dry and overcooked.  I would cut the bake time to about 15 minutes.

I am not a fan of this recipe, I tried to tweak but I still found them very dry. Gonna try it again because I love the idea of these muffins and they are very similar to the Banana Crumble Muffins which I absolutely love.

I don't get the 5 stars.  I did not read the other reviews first. Would have turned out better but a recipe should not be given 5 stars if you have to "tweak" it.

Very good.  We liked these a lot, so much so that I tried making them without the apples and adding raisins instead.  This was a mistake, without the apple they are way to dry to use as a "base" muffin recipe, but as the recipe is written they're very good.  The topping is the best part!

These muffins are fantastic! I can't praise them enough. I did as others suggested and they turned out perfectly. I bake them very often, whenever I have a couple of apples on hand.

This came out really well.  I only had one apple, so I added a cup of dried cranberries for Apple-cranberry muffins.  It came out really well.  I also added 1/4 applesauce and hide in three tablespoons of ground flax seed.  Flax seed to great for added fiber,and omega's.  The kids didn't even notice!!! I also added 1/4 cup apple sauce to offset the addition.  I filled the muffins cups to the top and baked for 30 mins.

I used the suggestions added by "KrisSi"
and these were the most delicious and beautiful muffins I have ever made.  I have added these to my muffin recipe "must haves".  Thanks for the suggestions and the original recipe.

I doubled this recipe and it turned out quite well. Once doubled I added 1 3/4 cups shredded apples and 1 1/2 cup chopped. I added 1 tsp of ginger to the top and 1/2 tsp all-spice. Second time I made this recipe I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter. When doubled the recipe made about 30 muffins and in less than 24 hours I have only 9 left. Excellent muffin when you follow tips given by the reviewers.

These were wonderful! I only made a few changes:
-Added 1tsp cinnamon and 1/2tsp nutmeg. 

-Halved the sugar and instead used 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar. 

-Used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce. 

The topping really made it over-the-top delicious!

Yummm! My muffins baked out fluffy and light, and it did not fall upon cooling. I doubled the recipe and baked some in the larger muffin cups and some in the mini muffins tins, and they were both moist and soft. I used half brown sugar and half white sugar as advised, and also grated half the apples and chopped the remaining half. Thank you for posting.

These were very tasty, but I added more apples (1/2 shredded, 1/2 chopped).  I like them better when the apple chunks are bigger so you get a little nugget with each bite!  I also think next time I would add a little milk or sour cream to moisten them up a little.  These were very easy.

Double the amount of Apple, and this is delicious. My husband asked when we were at the grocery if we had enough vanilla, because he didn't want anything to get in the way of us making it. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because it needs more apples than the recipe calls for.

I made these for a religion class my husband and I were teaching.  The kids absolutely loved them and ate 2 a piece.  I substituted 1/2 the butter with applesauce and used two chopped apples plus one shredded apple.  They were moist and delicious.  One of my favorite muffins!

Delicious!! Not too dry, not too moist.  Only, next time I will use a better flavored apple than what I had on hand and more of it, and dice part of it very, very fine and part med. fine.

Good muffins that the entire family enjoyed.  Used half brown sugar and half white and added some milk to this very thick batter.  Bottoms were very greasy. I may try and reduce butter next time.

I liked these BECAUSE they had vanilla in the batter instead of the usual apple spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.) which can overpower the great apple taste.  I used half Breaburn and half Granny Smith, and doubled the amt. of apples.  I use organic apples...the quality of the apples DOES make a big difference. Also added about 1/4 c. milk.  Lastly, paper liners are a must as far as I am concerned, especially with this sticky topping.  Great recipe...will add it to my breakfast bread rotation.

We were not happy with these at all.  They came out *very* dense.  I love muffins, but this one wasn't it for us unfortunately.

These muffins were the best!  They are so simple even I could make them!  I'm 14 years old and not exactly a genius in the kitchen, but they turned out perfectly.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I really liked the IDEA of these muffins.  But something wasnt quite right.  Maybe because of my substitutions.  I replaced 3/4 of the butter with applesauce and i split the sugar.  I did half brown and half white sugar.  I thought the brown would add a different sweetness.  Well, the muffins were good, but werent as sweet as i had hoped, and im not big on sweeeeeet baked goods.  I enjoyed the tops, where all the brown sugar was.  The other thing was they were dry.  But with a little dab of butter on top and a pop in the microwave for a sec, they were back to moist.  Great chunks of apples, loved that.  Will try again with butter instead of applesauce.

Added extra cinnamon and some vanilla; this worked perfectly for my half-dozen Texas muffins size pan. Both houseguest and SO literally raved over how good these muffins were. (Warning, if you put them in a ziplock bag for later, the topping becomes soggy.)

These were good. I added some cinnamon and ground cloves to the batter. Shredded one apple and chopped the other. I also added a shredded parsnip for some more nutrition. Turned out moist and tasty.

I made a half batch of these muffins and added a dash of cinnamon to the batter, and chopped up a small unpeeled Granny Smith apple... delicious!  These muffins were truly tasty!  I ate two right out of the oven :-)

These muffins are great!  When I made these I used 1 cup wholewheat pastry flour and 1 cup unbleached flour for the flour, 1/4 cup light butter and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce for the butter, 1/4 cup splenda baking blend and 1/4 cup splenda brown sugar baking blend for the sugar and added 1/2 tsp apple pie spice. And for the topping I used 1/4 cup splenda brown sugar blend, 1/4 cup quick oats, the flour, cinnamon and 1 tbs light butter. I also used 1 cup grated and 1 cup chopped apples.  These made 11 jumbo muffins with just 220 clories and 4 grams of fat each. My diabetic friends ate them right up and others didn't even realize these were actually good for them.

These were ok, but even the strudel topping wasn't enough to make them truly good.  It is very rare that a batch of muffins isn't finished at this house.

Didn't like the texture and not very flavorful either. They didn't rise very much either (just barely above the muffin tin). Won't make again.

I followed this recipe exactly. The crumb topping was very good but the overall flavor of the rest of the muffin wasn't very good. A bit more flavor than just bland but not much more to me. The batter wasn't runny as other muffins are- it was pretty thick. They came out great other than that.

My mom used to make similar muffins and lost the recipe.  This was like going back to my childhood.  They are so delicious.  I shredded the apples instead of chopped them.

The batter was quite thick and made more than 6 muffins (I halved the recipe), so I overfilled the muffin cups to use up all the batter.  Beware of this.  The streusel topping melted over the sides of the pan and onto the oven.  I had to put a piece of foil on the bottom of the oven to prevent further mess.  But still, the result was a very delicious muffin with a wonderful cinnamon sugar crust on top.

The first time I made this muffin I changed the recipe quite a bit - 1 cup of bran & stone ground wheat flour instead of 2 cups of all purpose flour, and brown sugar instead of white sugar. The result was a mess.   
This time I followed the recipe to a T, except for adding 21/2 cups of chopped apple and adding 3 tsps of cinnamon for more flavour. The muffins were quite light but too dry. Won't make this again.

I changed this one a bit by using brown sugar in the muffin mix. I also mixed the white flour w/ some spelt flour. I will make this one again and maybe add nuts to the topping.

First of all, this recipe is pretty good. I made small loaves, and they were not too dense, nor were they crumbly. They held together well and the texture was great.

Here are the changes I made: 
-Instead of 2c all-purpose, I broke it up as follows because I didn't have enough all-purpose: 1/4c all-purpose flour, 3/4c old-fashioned oats, 1c stoneground whole wheat flour.
-I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the butter.
-I used 3/4c brown sugar instead of 1c white sugar.
-I added 2 tsp of ground cinnamon and took out all of the vanilla.
-Instead of messing with strudel, because I'm lazy, I just sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon on top of the loaves.

These turned out really well. They were not too dense, and held together really well, even when I cut the loaves when they were still quite warm. I am going to experiment with making it taste more like apples, maybe by using more applesauce or apple juice. I think I may also use a bit less sugar next time, too. It's great as it is, but I tend to like low-sugar fruit breads/muffins.

I'll keep this recipe to continue my experimentation. It's a great basis recipe, and is probably a good recipe as it is (but I wouldn't know that since I altered everything the first time around). Thanks!

I couoldn't believe how fast these muffins went.  I added extra milk before I added the apples, and then wish I hadn't because when I added the apples (2 of them, which I shredded)it was too moist, and I wound up needing to add more flour.  So next time, I'll just stick with the recipe!!  These were delicious, and made more than 12 muffins, but maybe I have smaller muffin pans or something.  It made about 24 I would say regular size muffins.  Will certainly be making this again.

Initially, the dough came out crubly, but I added about a quarter cup of milk and it turned out very scrumptous in the end.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

These muffins were gorgeous!  I should've used a more tart apple(all I had were red delicious), but the kids said they were great and I thought so too.  I did add a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg to the flour mixture before adding to the wet ingredients.

These were the best muffins ever.  They had a great flavor all over, but the topping was the best.  They looked like they were from a bakery, and they tasted even better.

i used applesauce instead of butter, wheat germ and oat flour instead of all purpose, and fructose instead of sugar to make these extra healthy and they turned out perfect!

These were yummy!  I did make a few substitutions though.  I used about 2 1/2 cups of apples.  I added about a half a cup of applesauce and a tablespoon of sour cream.  Like others I added some cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg.  I also added rolled oats to the strudel.

These muffins are very moist and DELICIOUS! They come out wonderfully if you increase the topping and the muffin size (fill the cups fuller to make about nine muffins), and more cinnamon makes them even better.

Fantastic muffin! I've made this many times. Last night I started making them, and found out my brother had used up all the eggs and apples! So instead of eggs, I used 1/4 cup of apple juice mixed with 3/4 tsp. of baking soda. I then used blueberries instead of apples. It turned out just as good, even though the texture was more cake-like than that of a muffin.

These muffins were very easy to make and absolutely delicious!! I did six in a regular muffin tin and did 12 mini ones for my kids and they just gobbled them up. The mini muffins only took about 13 minutes.

I followed the recipe exactly and the muffins turned out good, I love the strudel on top. I felt like it was missing something.    Next time, I will follow the advice of others and add maybe milk and/or applesauce to make it a little more moist as well as adding cinnamon to the batter.  I think by adding those few things will make this an excellent muffin.

A bit cakey - I prefer a lighter texture.  The batter is quite dry.  I added in some dried cranberries for extra tastiness.

Delicious!  These came out super moist and made the whole house smell terrific while baking.  I added a little extra apples and some cinnamon to the batter for extra "apple cinnamon" flavor.  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

Delicious!  Love that topping!  To increase the "healthy factor", I substituted 1/2 C. flour with Whole Wheat Flour, and replaced 1/4 C. of the butter with applesauce.  
these came out very moist, aromatic and light in texture.  Very attractive muffin too.  Next time, I think I'll add some more cinnamon (I used 1 tsp, as many other reviewers suggested, but another 1/2 tsp. would be even better), increase the apples (used almost 2 cups, but I think MORE is MORE!).  I even think it could've used a little more vanilla extract.  My family is enjoying these, and I will definitely be making these again.

Yummy, but with a fews tweaks.  I added 3 tablespoons of applesauce to the batter because it seemed tight, and also a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter.  I reduced the bake time to 16-18 minutes.  I made one batch with the strudel topping; they came out dark.  I made another batch for my preschool class without the sugar topping and they are a lovely golden brown.  Nice taste and my husband liked them.  Will make them again.

Yummy! I didn't add the crumble and used only 1 cup flour with 1 cup oat bran with halved the sugar to half a cup.  Was sweet enough for me!  I also stewed the apples a little with 1T brown sugar and 1/2t cinnamon, not sure if this really made a difference.

This was my first time baking muffins from scratch and let me tell you.. YUMMY! I did add a bit of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg in the dry ingredients.  The topping was wonderful. I was going to put some of the topping in the middle but the dough was really gooey and sticky so i just squished it on the top.  There was a perfect ammount of the topping. There was no need to put it in the muffin. You got a bunch of the topping in every bite.  My kitchen smelled awesome baking these!  Everyone loved them and i even had a friend ask for the recipe.  Thanks Nikki. :D

Instead of making muffings I made 3 mini loaves and baked for approximately 30-35 minutes (keep an eye on them).  I put these in some baskets of baked goods I give out at the holidays and everyone seemed to enjoy them!  I'll make this again!

These muffins were fabulous.  I used golden delicious apples and followed the recipe exactly.  They turned out huge, moist muffins with a crunchy topping.  Perfect with that morning cup of coffee.  I took some to my college student son and he loved them too.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These are absolutely wonderful.  
All I added was a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter and they turned out perfect.

Very good... I took the advice about doubling apples and using 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown. My muffins came out good but weren't as moist as I had hoped. The company loved them though!

Quite easy and quick. Found them to be quite stuffing, so I made them in a mini-muffin pan. Great to pack for lunch; just enough for a little treat without going overboard...

These are so good!  Traditional struedel has raisins in it so next time I think I'll had 1/2 cup or so.  I might even put some nuts on top like someone else suggested.  Very tasty!

Excellent muffins!  I added an extra 1/2 cup of apples since I picked so many at the orchard.  Took them to work and everyone just raved about them.  Thank-you for sharing such a great recipe!!  This recipe is definately a keeper!

I would suggest to people who have trouble with the topping spilling and making a mess, to use muffin liners in their muffin pan . That seems to really help me.  Otherwise, this is a great recipe, I made it for a breakfast brunch and they came out delicious.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

THese are the best muffins I've ever made or tasted!  I used half wholemeal flour for a better texture and flavour, and added a little baking powder and cinnamon to the batter.  These were so good I made a second batch the very next day!

DELICIOUS!!!  They do take a little time to prepare (chopping apples, making the topping), but they are definitely worth it.  The best apple muffins I have ever had.

I followed this recipe to the T. It made beautiful, perfectly shaped, moist, fluffy muffins. The topping is wonderful. I doubled it, but didn’t use it all because I didn’t put it in the middle like other people suggest because I use an ice cream scoop to fill the tins.  Oops, I guess I will just have to make these again!

These muffins are DELICIOUS!  I made them for my family and friends and everyone raved over them.  I doubled the topping, added 1/4 cup of soy milk and used egg beaters instead of real eggs and they were absolutely WONDERFUL.  A must try!

These were unbelievable! I layered some of the strudel in with the muffins, and they were amazing. My husband and I ate all of them ourselves (oops!). They're even BETTER, if that's possible, when they're warm.

Such a yummy recipe! I added a little bit of cinnamon to the batter and instead of using chopped apples I used apple pie filling (I just diced the apples a bit though). I filled the muffin tins about 2/3 put a little bit of filling in, then topped it off with the rest of the batter. I then used the crumb topping. They were a little on the messy side, but well worth it. I may try this as a coffee cake recipe in the future.

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out delicious.  My three year old enjoyed them, although next time I will mix the extra topping into the muffin as others have suggested, because he keeps eating the tops and leaving the bottoms!
