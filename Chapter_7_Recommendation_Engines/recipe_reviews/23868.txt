Tasted really nice, I added corn. The consistency was a bit watery, so I had to use corn starch to thicken it. Will try a dash of hevy whipping cream next time.

Nice flavour but 1 tablespoon of pepper is a bit much.  I'd reduced it to less than 1/4 tsp.

I couldn't find my old recipe from years ago, but this seemed to resemble it the closest.  I used chucken broth and added a flour thickening to make it a CHOWDER.  Very good on a cold fall day.

I added a bit more carrots and used only 1 1/2 cups of fat free milk. Blended half of the soup & added the bacon bits back in before serving along with fresh dill! YUM!!!

This had good flavor but is not a chowder. Chowders should be thick and creamy and this was watery and thin. If you want a soup it would be good.

I recommend replacing 1 cup of milk with evaporated milk instead, for a velvety texture. This is a great base recipe - and depending upon your taste you can always thicken it with a simple white flour roux. I used fresh chopped onion, carrot, celery and yellow corn as well. For a heartier variation I might add diced chicken breast next time. Very good!

Very good.  Doubled the bacon, cut the veggie broth to 2C, added more milk and carrots, used 1t of pepper, then added 3/4 pound of shredded american to the pot at the end.  Yum.
