I made this a bit differently (just for presentation alone)  I cut down on the servings, and also made the lemon pound cake (I used the Lemon Yogurt Pound Cake with Lemon Glaze recipe on Allrecipes)  I cut the pound cake into cubes and did individual desserts using martini glasses, I did leave the vanilla out but only b/c I wanted a more pronounced raspberry taste...perfectly elegant!

When I searched for a recipe with pound cake, this one came up and I had all of the ingredients on hand with the exception of the lemon pound cake.  I used an almond pound cake and it was delish.   I took it to a friends' and all 6 who ate it loved it.   YUMMY!!

This was so good.  Its really just a trifle, nothing like tiramisu but it was still excellent.  I used an almond pound cake and it was fantastic.  I put it in large wine glasses and it looked so pretty!

Made this for a special group of friends.  It was a hit, and the presentation has that WOW factor! Instead of the 9x9 dish, I spooned it into a tall glass compote dish.  It looked so elegant and  attractive; the colors of the lemon and raspberry are so pretty.  THEN we ate it!!!  For so few ingredients and little prep time, this is delicious dessert to serve for any occasion. I've shared this recipe with others. Karen

My mother-in-law wanted a stunning dessert for her Bible-study group and after some searching we decided this was it.  Chambord was 22.99 which was an expensive ingredient given we only needed 3 TBSP. I looked into making my own raspberry liqueur , but it needed anywhere from 4 days to 4 weeks to 'cure', depending on the recipe. In the end, we opted for Montbisou raspberry liqueur (13.99) which was less expensive than Chambord  plus it won an award in 2015. We found it to have a true raspberry flavor, not overly sweet and not syrupy.  The dessert comes together quickly and is actually as easy to make as baking a cake.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe racheljk!

Unable to find berries in syrup.  Made raspberry syrup for drinks (recipe from this site) with Chambord added.  Reserved some of  the syrup and soaked the fresh raspberries in it for garnish.  Very  easy  & everyone  loved it.
