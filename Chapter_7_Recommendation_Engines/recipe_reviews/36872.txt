I love this recipe, it's so full of flavor!  I can make marinade ahead of time and then pop the fish in the oven at dinnertime for a quick, delicious meal.

Good, but too strong on the anchovy and garlic for my guests.  Will try again, toning down the flavor a little bit.

This was very good and I'm not really a big fish eater. My grocery store didn't have Mahi Mahi on the day that I went so I substituted Swordfish. I served this dish with a side of low-fat Caesar Salad for a healthy, low-fat meal.  It was extremely easy to make too!

I used sour cream instead of plain yogurt, only two garlic cloves, no anchovy paste and frozen mahi mahi steaks from trader joes. I grilled these on the George Foreman grill and they came out fantastically. There was not as much flavor as I was hoping for, but that may have been because I reduced the garlic and omitted the anchovy paste. My husband RAVED about this recipe. I will be making it again.

My grocery store didn't have fresh mahi mahi, so i bought some frozen mahi mahi and some frozen shark. The shark was very fishy! The marinade was really good, I just recommend using fresh fish!

I used grouper and added curry and chili powder instead of the anchovy one. It came out quite nice. Thank you.

I followed this recipe to the t, and did not care for the results.  The fish was not very flavorful, and the caesar flavor it did have was not a good compliment to the mahi.  I would not make this again.

Great recipe.  We made this with halibut.  You can not leave out the anchovy or the garlic, it's the whole idea behind this recipe.

My hubby loathes fish and he gobbled this down!  This fish doesn't have a 'fishy' taste, it is tangy, smooth, and delicious.  I couldn't find anchovy paste, so I ground some to a pulp in my food processor.

Very easy, kid friendly, excellent taste! I served this with an herbed long grain rice(fresh chopped dill, chervil and cilantro)  with a little cinnamon and tumeric mixed in-they were excellent together. 

I didn't have anchovy paste, so I omitted, still was great! I was short on time so I used about a teaspoon and a half of garlic powder. Thanks for a great one! I will definitely use this again!

Very good. Similar recipe to lo-cal cooking class I took, and turned out great.  Anchovies, (yuck as they are!) ;-) are necessary for Ceasar dressing.  I did not have the parm. cheese but still worked out fine.
