I thought the measurements on this were a little off.  I don't think a pinch of chili powder and 1/4 tsp. of ketchup and mustard do much to 2 lbs. of ground beef.  I liked the combination of ingredients so I increased the chili powder to 1/2 tsp., the ketchup and mustard to 1 tsp. each, and the pepper to 1/4 tsp.  I omitted the hot pepper sauce.  Instead of broiling, I cooked the burgers in my electric fry pan and didn't bother with the green onions.  Instead I just served these with the usual toppings, sliced onion, lettuce, tomato, sliced avocado, etc.  They were good.

I cut the recipe in half for 1 pound of lean ground beef (90/10).  I didn't bother with the water, I just didn't see the point.  I added a little extra dijon mustard, ketchup, and Frank's red hot.  These came out very moist and delicious.  I served these on toasted rolls with thin sliced red onion and melted american cheese.

This recipe is delish as is. They are the best homemade burgers. My kids had friends over the night we made them and they said they tasted like a burger from a restaurant. When youre making the patties big, after you formed them make a indentation in the center of the burger with all your fingers (kind of like a birds nest) this way when you cook them on the grill they wont shrink. They will stay the same size and they wont dry out. You wont be disappointed.

Very delicious. I halved the recipe (so I guess that means I have to make it again, now that I have half a pkg. of onion soup hanging around). Instead of water, I used lactose-free skim milk. I don't know what difference it made, but I thought I'd try it. Did a bit extra ketchup and mustard, using the spicy brown variety. I mixed the green onions (sliced) right into the burgers. I didn't have pepperjack cheese, so I used mozzarella. I'm sure pepperjack would have been better, and unfortunately, I had no avocado! I love avocados on my burgers, so that's what drew me to the recipe. This is really easy, and great with macaroni or potato salad.

Everything is great except for the "well-done" advice. I will not eat a burger that is overcooked i.e. well-done...... anyone??

Too bad about using Onion soup mix.  Too much sodium and artificial taste.  We prefer something a little more homemade not using artificial ingredients with colours and preservatives added.  This is too 1970s when we didn't know better.  Sorry.  We didn't like this.

This was very tasty and moist. However, I agree with other reviewers that many miniscule quantities added nothing, and they were cooked too long. I tasted mostly garlic and some spice, and the liquid made them light. As I had mashed avocado on hand, I spread that on the top role and it was fine. Instead of scallions, I sliced a red onion and broiled it a few minutes, and I didn't 
think the cheese added much. Too many other flavors going on.

Talk about yum!! First time making these and I also made homemade hamburger buns for the first time from this site as well. My family LOVED them! It's a must try!! I loved the full flavor of the burgers don't skimp unless you are picky. My daughter is picky and I didn't tell her what I put in them. She told me to make these for now on! Thanks!

We have been going through a hamburger phase here. This was very good. We used American cheese, omitted the green onions and avocado, added red onion. Thank you.

This is my favorite staple regular burger mix. I have been making it for years and forgot to rate it. I make them at all bbqq's and everyone loves them. I haven't cooked them as the recipe states because I like the bbq. I always forget whether I use the water or not, so sometimes I do and sometimes I don't. Regardless they have always come out great. I wondered about the minimal amounts of some items in recipe, but I just do it. I usually alternate between these and blue cheese burgers on this site. (At a bbq I make up both types) Tonight made with the Best burger sauce on this site and made sliders, very yummy.

This was awesome. Had a huge BBQ with my family and my in-laws and this was a hit!!! I did add more ketchup, mustard, garlic and hot sauce as suggested by other reviewers and it made a huge difference, The burgers were juicy, and well balanced. It was appropriate for all ages. Thanks so much for the recipe :)

Very good. Didn't have any hot sauce on hand so I used some red pepper powder. Added just enough heat to taste it. Better than a plain old burger.

These were fine, but nothing to get excited about. We did omit the avocado as we don't like it, maybe that would've made this unique (if we liked avocado). Thanks for the recipe!

Made up these burgers with all the listed ingredients, only grilled them rather than broiled.  I then served them with Gouda cheese rather than pepper jack, as that is what I had on hand.   With 8 ingredients added to the hamburger, it did provide a very juicy, flavorful burger.  I will be making these again, when the weather is warmer.

My husband enjoyed these burgers...left out the water and added extra ketchup and mustard.  We cooked them on the bbq and topped them with what we wanted.  (Used American cheese and tomatoes...didn't have green onions or avocado, although I'm sure that would have been good.)

Trying this new hamburger recipe was wonderful.  My whole family loved it.  I will say that by adding the water it made it hard to keep together so the next time I made it I didn't put the water in and it was perfect.  We Loved this recipe and I will use it every time I make hamburgers now.  Thank you .

don't get me wrong - these weren't bad, they just weren't great enough to justify all the ingredients. I even substantially increased most of the measurements (like Valerie said, can 1/4 of a teaspoon really flavor two pounds?). We could really only taste the onion soup mix and the hot sauce.

I am glad I cooked a little 'tester burger' first before adding the water as the water addition just didn't make sense to me.  I could only taste the onion soup mix and hot sauce.  This was just too much like a meatloaf sandwich.

These were really good. I added a few dashes of worsheshire sauce, but other than that didn't change a thing. I served with sliced tomatoes, avocados, onions, pickles and lettuce. I had french fries on the side.

We really liked these burgers. I would give the recipe 5 stars with the changes I made. Seems to me they would have been a bit bland had I followed the recipe exactly as written, thus the 4 star rating. However, that's my personal opinion. I like my food to have alot of flavor, so here's what I did...I cut the recipe in half as I was only feeding 2 people. I used a whole envelope of onion soup, 2 tsp hot sauce, 1/4 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp each ketchup & mustard, and added 1 can diced green chilis, as used in the firecracker burgers found on this site. We cooked these on a charcoal grill and topped them with sliced pepperjack cheese. They came out delicious! Great burgers for the fourth! Will definitely be making these again. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! Whenever I make these for my friends and family they just LOVE them!  I leave out the hot pepper sauce and let my guests pick the type of cheese that they prefer.

I loved it! Super juicy and the flavor was so amazing that it wasn't even necessary to add anything to the bun..that's a first. I substituted cayenne for the chili powder,  red onion, and added minced green pepper.  The prep time was  just minutes. Perfect for the grill!. Thanks a bunch:)
