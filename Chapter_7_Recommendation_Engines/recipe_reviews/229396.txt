I followed the recipe to the letter, and this baked up beautifully, evenly cooked throughout, and tasted wonderful. The yogurt really brings some moisture to the cake, and the bits of pineapple definitely bring some flavor.  And I thought the amount of the topping was perfect for the 8" coffee cake unlike the first reviewer.  Next time, I may add some coconut as suggested and maybe even add a few chopped pecans to the cake.  IMO this is a solid coffee cake recipe and a keeper.

This is a great and easy quick cake to make and the brown sugar with the pecans add the crunch it needs.  I didn't have enough yogurt so I did half yogurt and half sour cream.  I did make a frosting of 1/2 stick butter 1/2 stick cream cheese with some orange juice powder sugar whipped with some whipping cream.  My husband loved it.

Delicious!  I used pineapple greek yogurt and added an extra  1/3 cup pineapple juice because the cake batter looked too thick.  Had to bake for 35-40 minutes.  Cake is very moist.  Will definitely make it again.

A TABLESPOON of baking powder??  That's what I thought.  But I followed the instructions and this cake came out very airy and light.  I am impressed.  I did double the topping because it looked delicious and I used Honey flavored yogurt because I didn't have any plain.  I'd have gone with 5 stars, but the baking time was way off.  It took almost an hour for this cake to be done.

Very good. I had to substitute walnuts for the pecans this time. I had a 20 oz. can of chunk pineapple which when cut up into tidbits was just right at 1 1/2 cups. I did add a little coconut to the batter (maybe 1/4 cup) and the topping (replacing part of the 1/4 cup of nuts),  and will add a little more next time.  I did have to bake longer than 30 minutes. Nice and moist, tastes great, easy, and 8" pan is a good size.

Quite tasty and light enough for a summer treat. I followed the recipe and added a handful of coconut, which was maybe about 1/3-1/2 cup. I didn't have pecans, so I mixed coconut with the brown sugar for the topping. Came our nicely in 30 min at 375. The center was moist, and cooked through, almost the consistency of moist banana bread. I made a cream cheese pineapple glaze,(1/4c butter-3oz cream cheese-1 and 1/2 c powered sugar, and about 2 tbsp pineapple juice(enough to drizzle). I drizzled it over the top once it was cooled. I will definitely make this again and try using pineapple yogurt for an extra kick and also try less pineapple to see the difference it makes with the moistness.

I had to tweak this a little, but it turned out great! I only put half of the pineapple (maybe that's why for some this cake wasn't heated evenly) and I put it in the oven for less time than specified (only 350) and for a longer time. You just have to play around with the time a bit since altitude and oven types vary. I also added a little cinnamon in this cake and it tasted pretty darn good! Loved the topping as well. This recipe really doesn't deserve only 3 stars. This will be my go to coffee cake recipe from now on!

Loved this receipe. All the girls at work went crazy for it. I left out the walnuts in case of nut allergies and did a basic cream cheese icing. Will definitely make again.

I used sliced almonds on top instead of pecans, and liked the effect.

The cake was moist and delicious. Loved the crumb mixture.  We enjoyed heating up each serving slightly over the next few days, which made it gooey wonderful!!!  Will definitely make again.  Thank you!

Loved it! I used fresh pineapple and poured water over it then drained is to use as the juice. Also, I made this gluten free by using Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Flour plus a teaspoon of Xanthan Gum in place of the wheat flour. Very Moist!

I used a 10.5” x 7” pan, sugar in the raw instead of white, and coconut oil melted and cooled instead of canola.  It’s just out of the oven and cooling after 50 minutes bake time.  Smells wonderful and looks Devine.  I tasted a corner cut (as it’s cooling) and it’s actually quite yummy.  Gooey and crunchy a ton the same time.   Easy to make as the batter is more doughy like bread and easy to fold with a spoon rather than an electric mixer.  Whisking worked for dry ingredients but a spoon was needed when combined together.  I used fresh cut pineapple rings cut with scissors into tidbits and the juice they came in.  I won’t know about full doneness until it’s cooled and cut.  I had to put it in for two additional 10 minute bake-times and then an additional 5 minutes as I couldn’t tell if the toothpick was clean due to the gooey topping.  Chuckle.  Lastly, I cooked this in a convection toaster oven and had to put a piece of tin foil on top about 20 minutes in.

Made this cake twice.  Followed the recipe exactly as stated (added the coconut in one).  Yummy!  The only issue is the cook time.  Not even close.  The first cake I baked at 375 for at least 45 minutes because the center was still raw and not heated all the way through.  So, the second cake, I decreased the oven temp to 350 and baked the cake for 50 minutes.  much better!  Definitely will make again.

Made no changes except cut up the pineapple from chunks to bits.  Loved the taste but will need to either increase the cooking time or use a 9 inch pan as center was uncooked.

I made this recipe and sort of followed it to the tee, I did everything except put all the pineapple. It came out well and rose nicely. I used walnuts instead of pecans because they aren´t readily available where I´m currently living. Overall it was a good recipe and my family loved it!

I also found that the middle was undercooked at 30 minutes (even though the toothpick appeared clean). That said, I did have to substitute crushed pineapple for tidbits, which might have made some difference but not that much. For the edges that were cooked, I would have described the flavor as somewhat bland.  Maybe next time (if there is a next time), I would leave out the extra pineapple juice after draining.  I thought the quantity of topping was just fine.
