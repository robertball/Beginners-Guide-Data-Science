I thought this was a good base recipe - but I found the cheese cracker part to be a bit bland. The second time I made the recipe, I added 3/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon paprika, and 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, and I thought the crackers tasted much more savory. I also had to cook them a bit longer, but that may be because I'm in Denver (high altitude)

Makes a great Christmas party appetizer if you have red and green pepper jelly!

I didn't think the dough was going to come together.  It just looked like, well, cornmeal or something.  I kept running the food processor and then suddenly the dough began to form.   I needed to bake three extra minutes.  And my jelly didn't seem hot enough so I VERY LIGHTLY sprinkled with some cayenne pepper.  These are better after they are totally cooled.  I have also made them with pepper jack cheese.  Also good.

This was originally published by Cabot Cheese.  I use their Seriously Sharp.  I also wait till closer to the end to flll, but that may be because my home made blackberry hot pepper jelly isn't as stiff as a comercial brand.

I made half a batch of this recipe and took some to a friend's house for an appetizer.  Everyone loved these.  The cheese I used was Tillamook Sharp Cheddar.  I bought mild pepper jelly, and when I make these again, I'll have to add some chili paste to it to make it hotter.  I was thinking that if the hot jelly is red that it would make a really nice appy for Christmas by using both kinds.  I did use my food processor, and the mixture came together well and handled well.  I got 16 thumbprints using my small cookie scoop.  The directions were right on, except I did let them bake for two minutes longer after putting in the jelly.  Talk about an easy appetizer!  Thanks so much for the recipe because I'll be sure to make these again!

The first time I made these I followed recipe exactly and found the cheesy cookie part to taste a bit too much like flour. Next go round I added a squirt of brown mustard, some garlic powder and a couple drops of hot pepper sauce to the mixture before mixing in the food processor.  Personally I felt it had a much better flavor.  These are simple and beautiful appetizers, and go very fast.  Definately try this recipe!

I was looking for something to bring to a party that didn't have to be spread,sliced or heated and this was it!  I added garlic and oregano to the dough.  I wanted the grey/green flecks in there so people would know it was a savoury appetizer and not a sweet cookie. Have made this many times- a real hit.

Ohhh, are these a yummy little appetizer! I have been waiting to be with a crowd of people to make this snack.  The crowd finally happened, and everyone who tried them, loved them.  I used my small cookie scoop and got 30 appetizers.  After the first 5 minute bake time I used my small metal measuring spoon to put the thumbprint in the middle - worked great.  I then filled it with 'Red and Green Christmas Jalapeno Jelly' from AR that I had made.  I wouldn't hesitate to make this appetizer again!

I was looking for an appetizer that didn't need to stay warm and was a little unique.  This was definitely it!   I took the advice of those who added some additional spices (garlic powder, salt, and paprika).  This is a quick recipe and the final product looks very attractive.  I also had to bake them for about 2-3 mins longer.  The only pepper jelly that I found at the grocery store was an amber color.  When I first opened the jar, I was a bit nervous that it wouldn't look appetizing, but since the cracker is golden, the amber colored jelly looked "sparkly".  I would absolutely recommend this appetizer and have shared the recipe with several friends.  Next time I may try the suggestion of the brown spicy mustard and hot sauce.  Yes, there will definitely be a next time!

These were so easy to make.  I didn't run through a food processor but rather cut the mixture together with a pastry blender. I also added a little bit of hot pepper relish to the jam for a little more zing. You might want to explain that it's cheese and not a sweet cookie as looks are deceiving.

This was very good! I made it exactly as written. The dough came together nicely in the food processor. I got 24 cookies out of this recipe using a small melon baller. For some reason the dough never browned around the edges. I even baked them for a few minutes longer. I couldn't leave them in the oven too long because the jelly would have totally dissolved! Next time I'll bake them much longer than 5 minutes before adding the jelly. Very tasty though!

Excellent appetizer!  I used decent old cheddar and added about a teaspoon of cayenne and dry mustard.  The food processor makes it a no-brainer, and the chilling time give you just enough time to pop out to the grocery store to pick up the pepper jelly you just realized you were out of.  I will make this again.

Make these every year for Christmas appetizers.  I add chopped chives, paprica, red pepper flakes, black pepper, and use miscellany of sharp cheeses ... Balderson, Imperial and Gruyere, whatever is available.  I roll the balls in sesame seed and make the indents immediately to make a larger cavern for the jelly.

These are so good!  My only recommendation is that if you use preshredded cheeses that you microwave the mixture for twenty seconds or it won't hold together well as it is drier than block cheese.   They turn out perfect!

Mine did not turn out as planned however I know these are very good when made properly. I used my Tabasco Pineapple Pepper Jelly which was a little runny and they ended up a sticky peach colored mess. Honestly, I knew better. Next time I will bake, put thumbprint then bake again til done, let cool then drizzle my jelly. Also they need a touch of salt as well. I gave these 4 stars because with store bought Jelly they would have been fine.

I actually loved this recipe, but I did alter it so I didn't feel I could give it the full 5 stars. I processed the cheese, butter, and flour by hand (don't have a food processor) and I added an egg yolk and garlic powder. I also put the thumbprints and jelly in before I cooked them and just cooked them for the entire 10-15 minutes (I had to add a little time) all at once.

I made this receipe when I needed something that didn't have to be kept either warm or chilled.  After reading the reviews I decided to add 1/4 teaspoon each of paprika and garlic.  They were a great hit.  The reviews are very helpful.

I wanted a sweet/savory easy appetizer that didn't have to stay warm. Found this and like it very much.  Tips: Used the large side of a melon baller to scoop the dough to roll, the back of the tool to make the impression when hot. Cooked 7 minutes before adding jelly and 7 minutes after. Used the small side of the melon baller to add the jelly (not nearly 1 teaspoon but fit perfectly). Sprinkled with a couple grains of pink sea salt at the end.

Next time, I am going to do a variation and add fig preserves and a curly cue or small wedge of lemon spritzed green apple.

3.16.18  I’ve been  on a mission this week to use odds and ends in the fridge.  One thing I had on hand was some finely-shredded-reduced fat Mexican cheese, so I used that instead of the cheddar.  I will say that I think I’d have liked cheddar better, but these weren't too shabby even making the substitution.  I took them out at 5 mins, and they hadn’t spread out at all, so I did flatten each ball just a bit with the palm of my hand, and then used a wine cork to make the jelly indentation.  Quick, easy, and tasty, and that’s what I was looking for.  Success!

Loved these!!   I did not have any hot pepper jelly on hand so I substituted orange marmalade with some Louisiana hot sauce and cayenne pepper.   Worked great and so easy. These are now my go to appetizer.

I made these and everyone loved it. I read the reviews and took advice to add 3/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon paprika, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/8 teaspoon cayenne, I used 1 cup of cheddar and one cup of pepper-jack. I was told it was the perfect amount of spice!  I also cooked for 7 minutes added jelly then another full 7 minutes.

These were VERY good.  Like other reviewers, I added garlic powder, paprika, and pepper.  I baked for 10 minutes, pressed center & put in freezer.  When I needed them for party, I defrosted them, put pepper relish in center and reheated in oven.

This recipe was really good and easy to make.  Everyone loved it.  I did add one strip of bacon crumpled  into the dough before  I put  it in to chill.  I also used a mango pepper jelly that turned out amazing with the cheesy dough.

Based on others' comments I added 3/4 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp ground mustard.  They came out great!  Also, I don't own a food processor so I had to use a pastry cutter. Never again!  My family loves these so someone better buy Mama a food processor for Christmas or no one's getting these again, ha ha.

I did add some extra seasoning as was suggested.  Another tip is when ever you need to put an indication in a cookie such as this, use the end of a plastic wine bottle cork to make indentation.

I made these for game night and everyone liked them.  I do think they were a little bland and would add a little garlic to them next time.  Definitely a keeper.

I'm making these right now for a party. Slightly disappointed because the dough doesn't really stick together. And taking them out of the oven, they hold the ball shape and I have to flatten them before adding the jelly. Upon cooling...I'm noticing a flour texture. Not giving up on this recipe, but next time I think I'll add a little milk to the flour, butter, cheese mixture to hold it together better and perhaps a less flour-like texture after they are baked. I'll try adding an extra 2 minutes to the final bake process and see if that helps.

I took these to a party where finger foods were requested. They were barely touched. The appetizers were set out on a counter with the desserts(which were very appealing)so I think maybe the guests thought they were cookies(??)and opted for the more tempting desserts. I think I will try them again and handle the presentation differently. My hubby and I liked them.

These were quite tasty.  They definitely need to cool completely before they are eaten, as they taste too floury until they are cooled.  Next time, will probably add cayenne to the cracker mixture as, even with the "hot" pepper jelly, we wished for more spice.  Thanks for sharing.

I've made this a couple of times for parties where it is always devoured.  I really love using a habanero jelly rather than the jalapeno jelly i tried the first time, which didn't have enough zip.  Tillamook extra sharp (black wrapper) is my cheddar of choice and i used the suggestion of another reviewer to add a sprinkle of (hot) paprika to the top.  When serving at a party, be sure you alert grazers it's a savory, cheesy dish, not a sweet dessert, which is looks like.yum!!

This is so easy and so good.  I did add a bit of garlic powder as others suggested and I also added a wee bit of cayenne.  I also used extra old cheddar cheese.  They were gobbled up pretty quick.  They will be perfect for Christmas with the green and red pepper jellies.  Thank you!

Super fun and very unique idea, but the day I made them the cookie part was lightly crispy, but tasted pasty, by the second day it was more cookie than cracker but had better flavor.  Unfortunatly not the biggest hit at the party.

Made three batches of these little goodies for Christmas parties. Big hit! I made it as is, and used Tabasco red pepper jelly. I also made them a lot smaller than specified. They go fast, so next time I'll at least double the recipe.

Easy, pretty, and delicious!  I had red, green, and yellow hot pepper jellies, and used all three for our Christmas gathering. I think these appetizers would look more professional with less than a teaspoon jelly, but they are more yummy this way!

I tried to follow the recipe as written, with a few hints from other reviewers, like added smoked paprika, black pepper, & a little salt. The dough was so dry I didn't think it would hold together when rolled & flattened. I tried adding a tiny bit of water, then a little more, and a little more. I am guessing total water added, about 1/8 cup.
No one else mentioned needing to add some liquid so I'm guessing I did something wrong. They still turned out good & I will use the recipe again. even though they turned out more like. cookie than a cracker. That was ok, they were still very good! Thanks for the recipe!

I needed an appetizer for a family party. I wanted a finger food. These are perfect. I made two batches. The first one was prepared as written. For the second batch I followed the suggestions of some other commenters. I added garlic powder, paprika and chives. Both batches came out great.
Thank you for something wonderful, CarolynWG!

Lowered the fat in this recipe by using  1 1/2 cups of flour and an egg and they turned out beautifully.  Used a bit of parsley to add green flecks to the dough and the seasonings others recommended ( garlic powder, etc.)  Big hit with the crowd!   Best served warm, so reheated leftovers in toaster oven briefly.

Made this exactly as written. Loved it. You need a good food processor in order to have the dough form a ball. My cheddar was extra sharp and my jelly was habenaro pepper jelly. The only change I would make in the future would be to use different jelly because too many of my friends thought it was too hot!

Easy dough. I was skeptical at first, but the puff is delicious. It was suggested that a small amount of cream cheese be placed under the pepper jelly. That would really enhance the appeal!

I love this recipe because it is so easy and looks great.  I made this over the holidays and used red pepper jelly and green pepper jelly - looked festive.  

The cookies are very good.  I may try experimenting with adding some different seasonings the next time I make this.

I knew this was going to be a good recipe but adding garlic powder and other savory herbs took it over the top.  I debated between pepper jelly and jalapeño jelly because ima wimp. So glad I went with the jalapeño and extra sharp cheddar. I hope these make it to party.

Great appetizer! Four star only because I had to bake ~ 6 minutes longer than posted in the recipe and the dough does need a dash of salt, garlic powder, and cayenne or paprika to be more savory.
I do not have a food processor so used the pastry cutter for about 10 minutes before diving in with both hands and working the dough for another 15 before it came together.
I got 28 pcs. from the batch. I used gluten free flour so they were a little crumbly but not too bad. I used old cheddar and also a little ( 2 TBSP.) Italian 4 cheese  mix.

I must eat gluten free which can be a challenge working it into a new recipe. The first batch made with GF flour was disappointing and a bit bland. The second time I added 2 tbs of corn starch, 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp salt. The result was perfection.  I used Better Batter GF flour that includes xantham gum so I didn't need to add any. I will make this many times over.

I did use half pepper jack and half Colby jack cheese. I used jalapeno pepper jelly. I think you could use any cheese and flavorful jelly to make an elegant and simple appetizer. I made them very small using a melon ball scoop as another review suggested. Will be making again.

Wonderfully EASY!!! This savory cookie has been a hit at every cookie exchange. I use a wine or brandy based jelly/jam on top. I used a bit more butter than required, and make sure you use a sharp/old cheddar. No need for fancy/expensive cheese. Any old cheddar will do. 
Fig jam  goes wonderfully with this. A MUST TRY!!

I made these as per recipe for a test run before making them for a work Christmas party and they turned out great. It made 12 balls about 1 1/4 inchs in diameter. In my oven cooked for 10miniutes added jelly cooked for another 9 to 10 minutes. Next time I think I will add a little sriracha chili sauce to the jalapeño jelly for more kick and maybe try a little garlic and salt as others suggested. I used pre shredded big name cheddar from the grocery store next time I will use a quality cheese. I am sure I will be making these many more times in the future. This is a lot like a  baked sausage /cheese ball recipe I use.

These are tasty!  Baked a batch as a dry run for appetizers on Christmas Eve. I am glad I added the salt, garlic powder and cayenne.  Using an end of a wine cork made the best indention. Keeper!

I added some garlic powder, salt, and paprika to the dough.  Also added chopped fresh chives.  Baked 7 minutes, and then 10 minutes after adding the pepper jelly.

I had to add an egg to this dough, in order to get it to stick together, so I could form it into a ball. Otherwise, it was so dry and crumbly it just fell apart. I also added garlic, cayenne pepper, and a Cajun seasoning to give it more flavor as others suggested. I used a Mexican blend cheese instead of plain cheddar. I baked the "cookies" for seven minutes, then formed the thumbprint with a melon baller, added the pepper jelly, and baked them for another nine minutes. After cooling, we sampled them. They are quite tasty. I'm serving them to company tomorrow, and I think I'll zap them in the microwave for a few seconds to warm them just a little.

I made the recipe exactly, except for the technique. I sliced the log with a thin cheese knife instead of rolling in balls. They were the most popular hors d'oeuvre among a choice of 9 others. They were gone in about 10 minutes - super delicious.

Another winner with the Bunco ladies! I did take the advice of other reviewers and added some garlic powder, paprika, salt , (and I added a bit of crushed red pepper flakes) to the dough. These are super easy to make and really tasty!

This is a great base for an appetizer. It's very adaptable and  can be adjusted to your own personal taste very easily. Like others, I found the cookie part to be too bland without adding some seasoning. I used extra sharp cheddar cheese. I added 1/4 t of garlic salt, 1/2t of paprika, and 1T of dried parsley. The flour comes together well and is very easy to work with.  Like others, I found the bake times to be off. I cooked 5 minutes, took out to add the jelly, and then needed to bake 10 minutes more for the cookie to be totally done. I found a green hot pepper jelly at the grocery store. This option gave the best flavor and kept its shape better in the hot oven. I also tried a strawberry jam and added red pepper flakes and chili powder to it. This added both sweetness and spice to the cookie, but melted more from the oven's heat. However, it did provide both a nice flavor and pretty appearance to the finished product.

I made this for work & everybody loved it. I also added the salt, garlic powder & a couple of dashes of Tabasco sauce to the batter for more flavor. I baked for 7 minutes then put thumb prints in using a teaspoon. I cooked for another 7 minutes & they came out perfect!

This is the third time I've made these in the last 2 weeks.  They are versatile, quick to make and delicious.  The basic recipe is very good, but the possibilities are endless!  Great Appetizer!

I'm a little embarrassed to admit it, but this was my first time making thumbprint cookies.   They were delicious!  But they include two things I love...pepper jelly and cheese.   I learned that the dough was too hot to actually use my thumb to make the imprints, so I used the back of a measuring teaspoon.   I put a measuring tsp of jelly in the center.  Next time I might not put as much jelly as it ran onto baking sheet.   Also,  it took longer to cook in my oven - maybe 8-10 minutes  after putting jelly in thumbprint.   In any case, I love them and will definitely make again.

Excellent. Delicate cheese flavor complimented nicely by a little taste of pepper jelly. I think I made my balls 1/2" as directed and this recipe made many more than 20 cookies. Each cookie was a tiny bite - just perfect for a party when you are snacking and talking.

Had a nice cheesy flavor, but very greasy!
