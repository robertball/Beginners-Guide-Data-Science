By following this recipe as submitted, our family enjoyed a very tasty, but simple-to-prepare dinner. The vegetables were not overcooked and the beef was as tender as corned beef can be.  The jigger of Bushmills and the soda bread made for a perfect Irish meal.

This is such an easy and delicious recipe! I loved using the corned beef sauce to cook the carrots, cabbage and potatoes. Full of flavor!

I've never made corned beef before and I'm not a HUGE fan of cabbage, but I was hungry for it this St. Paddys day so I searched for the simplest, basic recipe and decided on this one.  It was EASY and very tasty!  Even the cabbage tasted delicious to me.  I didn't add anything extra and actually drank the shot of whiskey instead of adding it!  My corned beef could have been more tender, but that's what happens when you can't let it cook as long as it's supposed to because it smells too good and you are starving!  I froze the leftovers in individual portions to enjoy on another day.  Thanks for sharing!

Great but after the first few times i had to adjust the meat to potato and cabbage ratio. Once i got that down there aren't always enough leftovers for my favorite breakfast.

This was ok, I didn't add the whiskey (I don't drink)  but it seemed sortof bland to me.  I think it is better in a slow cooker with minimal water, or maybe add a little extra salt for the cabbage.  My cabbage got overdone and soggy too.

Made this last night and although it was a hit with me, the wife and kids were not as impressed. Maybe because they don't have any Irish in them? Nonetheless, it brought back great memories.

This is good I just have a HINT: When puttimg in the spice packet I don't put it into the pot I put it into a tea ball then put that into the pot that way you get the flavor but not the mess of the spices. I also do that when making broths and I want some flavor for my broth. There are various sizes of balls small to large.

Easy peasy, if that's what you like. Very tender corned beef as others have mentioned. Though my potatoes were done just about right, my cabbage was too soft. Also needed some extra salt once in the bowl. Would make again.

It was good, and super easy, since you don't really do much of anything. I guess the brand of corned beef I used had good seasoning for my taste. The Irish whiskey added some nice flavor. Personally, I think that if you don't follow the recipe, by omitting the whiskey, which is part of the flavor profile, you can really leave a valid review. Just review a different recipe, or write your own entry.
