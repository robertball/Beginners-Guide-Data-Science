I took the submitter's advice and used all milk and used AP flour. I made this by hand with my Kitchen Aid mixer. I proofed the yeast in my mixer bowl with the warmed milk and sugars for ten minutes until it "bloomed", added the remaining wet ingredients, then all the dry. I kneaded the dough with my hook for about five minutes, then set it to rise in a covered, greased bowl on my warm oven for about an hour. Once it doubled, I formed it into a loaf and let it double again in a covered, greased loaf pan on my warm oven. Thirty minutes in a 350* oven and we were good to go. I made myself wait until the next morning and I made french toast with it. OFF THE HOOK. We used the Absolute Best Pancake Syrup over the top of it and it really sang. Super easy bread and way flavorful. Not difficult to make at all. I'd really like to try this with whole wheat flour and see how it is.....maybe even a cinnamon swirl in the middle?

YUMMY!  I went ahead and just baked it in the bread machine because, well, I am lazy :D  I did make a few changes, but they weren't major.  I only had light brown sugar, so I used that instead of dark (though I do want to try it with the dark at some point!).  I used unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil.  My vanilla extract is a double-strength one, but I still used the full 1.5 teaspoons.  I had fresh ground coriander from last year's garden, so that was really nice.  It smelled DIVINE as it was baking!  I used bread flour, and while it was kneading, it seemed a bit on the sticky side, so I threw in a little bit of whole wheat flour (probably about 1/8 cup at most).  GREAT texture, very slightly chewy (in a good way), rose and baked up nicely in the machine.  We had it toasted for breakfast this morning.  Will definitely be making this again, and will try it with dark brown sugar!

I made this bread by hand. I omitted the white sugar and added 3 T honey.  I used all milk, light brown sugar and all purpose flour. To knead the dough I had to add an additional 1/2 cup of flour because it was too sticky.  Make sure you grease the bread pan very well before putting it in the oven!   Husband LOVED it :) Also make sure you get some because it won't last long!

Made this recipe last night and it is fantastic! I used cinnamon instead of coriander and let it bake in the bread machine and it came out perfect! I know this bread will be gone by the end of today! Note: If you use a bread machine to bake it, this is a 1-1/2 pound loaf.

This bread was so warm and comforting. I flavor of the vanilla and spices were very subtle, but really made a huge impact. I used soy milk instead of real milk because my husband is allergic to dairy and it was still moist and delicious.

Delicious! I love love love the subtle spiced flavor of this recipe and the texture was lovely. I was concerned about not having any dark brown sugar, so I added a teaspoon of molasses to my light brown. I also only ever use all purpose flour for breads, so I added some vital gluten as well. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written and was so happy with the outcome. We had it lightly toasted with a bit of Cinnamon Cocoa Spread from this site, and I can't wait to try it as french toast. It should be amazing. Thanks so much for the recipe.

WOW!  Great bread.  I did increase some spices - cardamom to 1/4 teaspoon and coriander to almost 1/2 teaspoon.  This bread makes wonderful french toast!

i love cardamom and vanilla, but i had never tried coriander in a sweet recipe. the use of it in this recipe really interested me, and i was really glad i tried it! this bread is delicious. although it bakes as a loaf and looks similar to white bread, it has a relatively firm crumb, which i was happy about - i made it to use in a french toast casserole i'm making. i can't wait to see how the french toast casserole turns out, i think the flavors of this bread will really make it shine!

This was good bread.  I followed it exactly and my dough was way way too sticky, so I added 1/2 cup more flour.  It was still pretty sticky but I thought this was how the submitter intended it to be. The bread didnt turn out real well but had a great flavor.  I will make this again to see if maybe I messed something up.  If not, then it definitly needs more flour.

Amazingly good. Very moist and tender. Used cinnamon instead of coriander. Would be fabulous toast if I could stop eating it before toasting! 13 year old son told me he wished I had made 2 loaves as "this won't last long."

Very good. I made the vanilla spice first. My husband loved the consistency and told me I should make a plain loaf out of it, and so I did. I left out the vanilla, brown sugar, cardamom, and coriander plus used about 1/4 cup of sugar (instead of 2 tbsp). It came out great as a regular loaf for sandwiches. Airy and slightly chewy texture. Most loaves I have had a problem with being too crumbly for sandwiches, so this was a great recipe to come across.

WOW!! So good. I made it with a kitchenaid mixer, following the directions of another reviewer.  I have two small children who also love the bread - especially good with peanut butter and jelly!!

Delicious!  Such a tasty and unusual bread.  I can see why this has won prizes!  I didn't have any cardamom or coriander, so I just substituted cinnamon.  Next time, I will see if I can get some.  I also used white whole wheat flour with added vital wheat gluten and I let it go the whole way in my bread machine on the basic setting.  It was perfect!  Rose beautifully, browned beautifully and it was slightly sweet and smelled heavenly.  Delicious with just peanut butter.  My daughter had her first taste of peanut butter on this bread!  The only thing I noticed was that I needed to add a significant amount of extra flour to the recipe.  Maybe I didn't measure my liquids accurately.  After all, my toddler was helping me measure.  Will make it again and again as a fun change up from our regular whole wheat bread.

I love this recipe.  I don't have a bread machine so I had to change the process a little.  I warmed the milk, water, sugars, vanilla, salt and oil in a saucepan and then added the yeast.  I let the yeast bloom while I added 2 cups of the flour and the spices to my kitchen aid mixer.  I have found that I like the flavor of the bread best if the spices are changed to 1/2 tsp each.  Once the yeast bloomed I added the wet mixture to the dry mixture and mixed with the dough hook.  I added the  third cup of flour as needed as I have found that often this recipe doesn't need quite all 3 cups. I added just enough flour until the dough pulled away from the bowl and made a ball and then let the mixer knead it until it was smooth and elastic.  I let rise in a greased bowl until doubled, about an hour. Punch down, make a loaf and then put in well greased loaf pan.  I covered and let rise until doubled again and then baked for 30 minutes at 350.  Beautiful!  As per other reviewers, I can't wait to make it into French toast!

This bread is excellent...the aroma just lingers and lingers, and oh my is it ever a bread lover's treat!! And toasting the bread just accentuates this wonderful bread's smell...tastes just as heavenly no matter how it is eaten.
I substituted the water in the recipe with milk, so that all in all in the recipe, there was a total of 1 1/4 cup of milk. (using milk instead of water always makes for a softer crust.) I changed cardamom to 1/4 tsp ground; and changed coriander to 1/2 tsp ground. Perhaps the favorite of any bread I've ever made...was a HUGE hit at our house!!

I found this to be just a touch too sweet for me but it's very good.  I could see this making fab french toast like many people have suggested.  I made this by hand and had to add the extra flour as suggested.  It worked up quite nicely and made a beautiful large loaf.  I will definitely make this unique bread again to share with friends!

This bread is Yummy!  I followed the directions exactly except for using bread flour and 1/4 cup vital wheat gluten.  It rose beautifully and had a great texture.  Sweet, but not toooo sweet.  My family ate the entire loaf in one sitting. The Steakhouse bread remains my favorite recipe so far, but this is a close second.  Look forward to making this often.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My daughter used this recipe for the local and county fair and took 1st place each time. She is now qualified for the state fair next weekend! Have yet to have anyone tell me they don't like it. I have also made the recipe without the spices and it was wonderful! 

Just a quick update, my daughter got 4th place at the state fair with this recipe!

I used this to make french toast and it was amazing.  The bread had wonderful texture and a subtle flavor that we really enjoyed.  It was more work to make this the day before for the next morning's breakfast, but it was worth it!  I made the recipe as written except I only had regular bread flour and not the high gluten kind, but the bread still rose up perfectly.

Oh my gosh... this may be my new favorite bread machine recipe.  However, I did not bake in the oven  - I put all the ingredients in the bread machine as directed... used menu BASIC, Crust LIGHT, and LOAF size 1 1/2 .  I did add one more tsp floor while it was mixing... but I often have to adjust water or floor.  Absolutely delicious with butter as dinner bread.  I can't wait to make french toast with it in the morning.   Thanks for sharing this recipe.  This one goes in my Mom's favorite recipes book.

I have to rate it on what I did. I did alter the recipe a little.  I used 3 tablespoons honey instead of the white sugar and I only had light brown sugar so I used that.  I also used 2 cups all purpose flour and 2 cups whole wheat 3 cups flour just wasnt enough. I used all milk instead of the water and made it with my kitchenaid mixer instead of the bread maker.  My kids are enjoying it right now and we love it. I may double the spices and vanilla next time, but it is yummy!  Especially warm out of the oven :)

I used my bread machine (2lb white/basic setting) and baked in the machine. I added 1/4 cup whole wheat flour because I used regular bread flour, and used 3 tsp of vanilla. Turned out great!
