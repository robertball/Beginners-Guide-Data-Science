Very good recipe, family loves it. It's a good basic recipe that is easy to vary depending on the ingredients on hand. We cut down the sour cream and the salt because it's plenty salty already between the bacon, sausage, alfredo, and cheese sauces.

This was excellent! I used feta cheese instead of the two it called for but other than that it was the same and we loved it. Will definitely make this again. The pictures do not do it justice

This was very good and quite easy to put together. My family really enjoyed it. The only thing I will change next time is only use 1- 8 oz package of the Neufchatel cheese. I grilled Italian sausages as my family of men are all big eaters and served with garlic bread to slop up the Alfredo sauce. Very satisfying! Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is scrumptious and you can really play with it.  I used a mixture of fresh mozzarella and sharp white cheddar cheese, as well as a store purchased roasted poblano alfredo. If you like, mix in a bit of cayenne pepper with your sausage for some extra spice and you have a crowd-pleaser.  The best part is, this one stuffed bell pepper recipe  that won't cause anyone heartburn.

I used ground deer and ground hot sausage.  I used cream cheese also in place of Neufchatel cheese because I had some that will expire in a few days.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  It was crazy good!   As others have said, you can substitute what you have and it is still good.

Very delicious.. I would buy 4-5 peppers.  Lots of stuffing left over.

The only change I made to it was to use lean ground beef as I didn't have the sausage. Overall, it was an ok dish though rather bland. If I were to make it again, I'd use maybe a half package of Neufch√¢tel cheese as it came out very thick and pasty with 1.5. I'd also season it ALOT more. I also had enough filling to fill 5 large peppers. I think it may have been better had I used very small peppers so the filling to pepper ratio would have been more even. Last not but least, I did parboil my peppers in salted water for 3 mins before baking them as the recipe stated. My peppers were still too crunchy so I would recommend parboiling for about 5 mins before filling.

I made this last night and used the recipe ingredients listed except for the bacon and mushrooms.(only because I didn't have them and was too lazy to go to the store!) So I decided to add in a cup of cooked rice to the stuffing, because I did have that. My family absolutely loved them. Maybe I shouldn't rate it because I didn't make it as listed, but I plan on making it with the bacon and mushrooms and I'm certain it will be delicious. Thanks so much for the idea of using the alfredo sauce. A great change from the typical tomato based sauce used on peppers. Will definitely make again!

Made this for my family and it was a pretty big hit. I had left over stuffing mix so the next night I used it to stuff mushrooms, topped them with Mozzarella and cheddar and OMG yummmmm!
