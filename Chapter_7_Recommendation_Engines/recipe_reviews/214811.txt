Cooked this for my wife and I, and thought it was good but lacked flavor from the peanuts and soy sauce was watery.  Added a tbsp of peanut butter to the leftovers on the stove (about 2 servings) and reheated.  Wow! Gave it the flavor and consistency I was looking for.  Will try it again with this modification.

It was good, not great the first night. I reduced the peanuts to a third of a cup, and added mushroom and bean sprouts. Served with peanut sauce and rice noodles instead of rice. What made it go from good to great was letting the sauce reduce over a day. Cook this, wait a day, then reheat the next night. Then it's REALLY good.

4.19.16  Had the can of mandarin orange slices out, but simply forgot to open it....aaaargh!  I did add some sliced bell pepper and onion to this recipe, otherwise, prepared as written (except for adding the orange slices).  The soy sauce cooked out pretty quickly, so I did add a little more plus some water to keep the chicken moist.  Never had Maho before, but we liked it.
