Wonderful flavour and a great way to use leftover herb roasted sirloin beef from this site. I only had 2 cups leftover beef and  chicken broth in the house and it still tasted yummy. I will make it again using less liqued as we like our stew thicker.I Sauteed the veggies and transferred all of the ingredients to the slow cooker. On high for 4 hours.Didn't change a thing.

I didn't follow this recipe exactly. I wanted to make this, but didn't have any roast beef, so I browned cubed stewing beef, removed that from the pot, then followed the recipe. Because it was stewing beef I had to simmer it for quite awhile to tenderize it. I didn't add potatoes. The flavours were really good.

We really enjoyed this. I did cut back on the chipotle though a lil' bit. We like spice just not over spicey. I used both red & green peppers. I topped w green onions diced. Enjoyed and will use it again. I think perhaps next time I too will try w london broil.

This was a great way to use up leftover roast beef.  My first time cooking with shallots which add a nice subtle flavor.  All I had on hand was regular chile powder, but I bet with the chipotle chile powder this stew would rock!  We tried this with the parsley, but have found we prefer serving it with chopped cilantro.  I thickened it slightly...just our preference.  Very yummy alternative to traditional beef stew. Thanks!

Wow, what flavors! We grow our own Poblano peppers and had some red ones on the vine (they get quite hot when they ripen on the vine).  Used the equivalent of 2 red bell peppers as the only substitute in this recipe. Turned out fantastic!  Quite spicy and full of flavor. I suggest everyone try poblanos in this recipe (if you have mild ones, add some hot chiles along with them).  Thanks for the recipe.

This stew had so much potential!  It had all the right ingredients, and it smelled SO good while cooking.  Yet, when I ate it for dinner, it was just missing something...not sure what.  Maybe add some more spices next time?  I also felt it needed thickening..    it didn't live up to my expectations.  I will try it again and experiment a bit.

I tried this in a crock pot and it came out watery.  Next time I'll try as written with less broth and work up a roux to thicken it up.

Family and friends loved this recipe.  Served it with cornbread.  It was just excellent.  I'd tell you that the leftovers were even better with the flavors infused over 24 hours but each time I make it, there are never any left.

My husband loved this soup and so did I.   I made a Pepperoncini roast in the crockpot the night before and used the leftovers for this soup.  It added a nice blend of flavors.  This recipe made a lot for two people so we had it twice and I froze a single portion for a lunch sometime in the near future.

Delicious. I cut the chilli powder by 1/3 for my wife. I used sirloin roast I had done on the smoker with a bonedust rub and mesquite wood. Will make again.

Nice flavor in the broth; my picky husband liked it.  Good use of leftover beef; the cubes stayed tender.
