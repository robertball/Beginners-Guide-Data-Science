I get such RAVE reviews when I make these.  The only changes I make is that I use Malibu Rum instead of regular rum...it's what I have on hand and personally I prefer it because the flavor is much more mild and I'm not a big rum fan.  I definately feel this is a recipe that you should ALWAYS DOUBLE as they will disappear quickly.  And they really do get better after a few days...they just don't normally last that long! haha  
I wouldn't suggest trying to crush the ingredients with anything other than a food processor.  It just gives you a totally different type of cookie.  I most like these when the cookies and nuts are ground to an almost powder consistancy.  That way you taste the 'cookie' not the 'ingredients' if that makes sense to you.

These were the hit of every party I took them to! - so delicious! Only thing I do different is toss them in granulated sugar rather than confection - the sparkles look nicer.

These are awesome!! I made them last year and they were a hit!  I use Bacardi Vanilla flavored rum instead of plain rum and it gives it a little something extra, and this year I will triple the recipe, due to the high demand!!  I also throw the nuts and cookies in the food processor to make sure they are ground up finely.

These rum balls are awesome.  I have tried many recipes that are often mucky and a pain to make.  These are perfect.  I used a food processor then stirred in the cornstarch and rum.  As we like lots of flavour, I used dark rum and dissolved 1 tsp. of instant coffee in it first.  In Canada nilla vanilla wafers come in a box slightly under 12 oz. and so I didn't use quite the full amount of rum...just added it until I got a cohesive dough.  Then  rolled the balls in chocolate sprinkles which is our tradition.  Thank you so much.  My family are going to love you this Christmas.  I know I will be making them each year from now on.

If I had to sum up this recipe in one word, it would have to be yumyumyummy!!  These cookies are not only beautiful, but they taste wonderful.  Unlike many holiday confections, the longer they sit, the better they taste!  I highly recommend using coconut-flavored rum in this recipe. My boyfriend and I tried two batches--spiced and coconut, and coconut just happens to work and taste better. Thank you for your recipe.

This is a winner!  Thank you Leslie! Have made several times for various get togethers and have received raves each time! Use of a blender to powder both the wafers and the nuts (in several small batches) makes this quick to prepare too. Two tips:  1) after blending mixture with spoon, use hands to further blend until dough is evenly moist; 2) use of small metal 1" meatball-shaping tongs produces uniform, perfectly rounded rum balls.  Also, the 2-3 days in an airtight container is essential for full flavor.

I took these to a cookie exchange party and won most outstanding.  I used almonds for the nuts and ground them in a coffee grinder until very fine.  Wonderful cookie with no baking!!!

These have become a regular treat for our family at Christmas.  I use a food processor for the wafer cookies and nuts to make a finer mixture as recommended by another reviewer, and it works great - so much easier to roll into the balls!  I also use Parrot Bay rum for a nice coconut flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe!  Updated review!!!  I ran out of rum making this recipe in 2008 so I put in half light rum and half Rumplemintz and really liked the chocolate/mint flavor - a good variation from the coconut that I usually make.

I had 80 proof  rum so I cut it with water for a 60% rum 40% water. I also made a batch with 3/8c coconut rum & 1/8c reg. rum. Let them "age" in the fridge for a week and they were fabulous.

Great with Light Rum, and for a twist, replace the rum with Starbucks Coffee Liqueur. Makes them a little sweeter and stickier, but gives a nice coffee/mocha flavor.

I was looking for a quick filler for my cookie tray for hubs work three years ago when I found this one. It was perfect as is! I did make changes over the years. I now mix this in my food processor after I use it to crumb the vanilla wafers. I store the mix in an airtight container for two days then add 1/4 cup more rum. I use spiced run in place of the light rum. Then after two more days I roll into balls and in the confectioners' sugar. I think next year I may use a coconut rum and toasted coconut to roll them in. One year I ran out of rum and had to use some peach brandy I had in it's place, everyone loved them just as much. Hope this was helpful.

I've made this as a Christmas treat for a couple of years now. You can use other syrups as an alternative to corn syrup. For a little "Canadian" flavour, I really like using maple syrup. You can also roll the balls in hot chocolate powder instead of icing sugar.

Well I just finished making a triple batch. I don't know why people are concerned with the dough being too sticky or too dry. It was perfect! I did use my hands to mix it thoughly. I rolled 1/3 in coconut, 1/3 in cocoa, and the last 1/3 in confectionary sugar.

Have made similar ones for years but use amaretto, kahlua or creme de almond instead of the harsh rum, and put halved and drained maraschino cherries in center. Wonderful!

So easy and good! Didn't have rum. I had a choice between Bailey's irish cream and butterscotch schnapps. I went with the Bailey's and they are great! I really think the schnapps would have been good too though. Nabisco nilla wafers now come in an 11 oz package instead of 12. With that in mind, i cut down the liquid a little. I crushed the cookies in a ziploc bag with the side of my meat tenderizer, then i used the same bag for coating the 'Bailey's Balls' in the powdered sugar. Less dishes to wash. You gotta love that! I have a strong feeling these won't last the 2 or 3 days required ;)

These were excellent and so easy to do.  Definetly would suggest waiting the 3 days or so to have them at their best.  As stated in one of the other reviews the granulated sugar looks very pretty and sparkly over the powdered.

I've made these for years.  My alteration is to put the cookie dough around a maraschino stemmed cherry and they're sooooo good.  You may want to try it.

Perfection!  This is the recipe my mom has made for many years now.  I  lost it, but when I saw this recipe I knew it was the same! You really need to let these "rest" a few days before eating (but if you like rum, then why wait, right?!)  They are also good rolled in cocoa powder and dipped in chocolate.

These were awesome when made with the orange juice!  I was looking for a way to make these without the rum and they turned out great! The best way to crush the wafers is in a food processor.

These are the betst. Actually, I made them last year and everybody loved them.  I had to make a batch after Christmas for those that didn't get enough!  I might have to do a triple batch this year.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I followed the recipe to a "T" and found the rum flavor to be overwhelmingly strong and the texture of the cookie extremely dry.  I have made rum balls in the past that were much better.  I remembered that the recipe then had called for 1/2 c. oil and much less rum.

These were excellent! I followed the recipe exactly. I crushed the vanilla wafers and nuts in a food processor, which worked great. The recipe doesn't specify what type of nuts... I used walnuts. Next time I will crush the nuts more finely. I let the rum balls cure for 4 days in the fridge (the recipe didn't specify if they needed to be refrigerated so I wasn't sure). They came out perfect.

the box of wafers was 10oz, I put a little too much rum & ended up with a mixture a little too soft to form a ball.  So I added 3 oz of crushed cocoa flavored animal crackers.  Still too soft.  I got tired of dealing with crushing crackers so somehow decided to dump 1 cup of panko (Japanese bread crumbs).  What a forgiving recipe!  It turned out great!!

My all-time favorite rum-ball recipe. If we want a less strong taste, we half the rum, but usually we switch out the light rum, for dark. These are delicious.

I loved these balls!  At first they tasted very strong but after 2 days the balls were amazing!  They look real pretty too.  I used a sifter and sifted the powdered sugar on top right before serving.  They looked like snowballs!  Definitely recommend.

I love trying new recipes but get scared some times when I do; I suggest you do not hesitate at all to make these!! I made them last night and I know they are suppose to be better three days after but I tried them right away and they are so good. I made them with the intent on giving them away to neighbors but I can't stay away from them so I am making a second batch tonight to give away. Once I have mixed all the ingredients I find it better to work/knead the dough with your hands to make sure every thing is mixed well and evenly. The alcohol does not seem strong to me (I used Malibu Rum), you know it's there but it's not like taking a shot of rum or any thing. Plus I think after day three the alcohol taste gets even less. Bonus is that is does not require too many ingredients and they are easy to make... it's tough finding a recipe that is sooo simple but taste AWESOME!!

Easy and delicious. I didn't have corn syrup so used agave nectar instead, and it worked well. I used a bit less than 3 tablespoons. I rolled some of the rum balls in chocolate powder and some in confectioners sugar, and they looked nice on the plate together.  I will make these every time I can justify it. They are really good.

SO EASY! SO DELICIOUS!  This is a must make for any holiday season!  They won't be around for long.  I actually used dark rum and had to store them out in the garage so I wouldn't eat them all myself.  I am making these for a cookie swap and need 6 dozen.  One recipe goes a long way if you aren't eating them all while you are making them.

Very good!  Quick, easy and tasty.  I used coconut rum and they were yummy.  I probably should have rolled them in coconut - I'll try that next time.  :)

These are really similar to a recipe my Mom had which called for graham cracker crumbs - I think it was a 16 oz pkg of graham crackers crushed into crumbs - but otherwise the same.  They are awesome!  Thanks for the recipe, I had lost Mom's original one. They sure do get better as they age.

This recipe is good; I just didn't do a very good job of crushing the wafers so I had a few chucks but the rum softened them overnight. Remember that the recipe calls for LIGHT rum.  Next time I will also grind the nuts into smaller pieces.

Quick, easy, and tasty!! Recipe said to set aside for 2-3 days to develop flavor. Not sure how that works; they didn't last long enough!! Definitely a crowd pleaser...

I used Malibu Rum and kept everything (else) the same.  Just finished these, and they already taste good.  Can only imagine how delicious they'll be when I give them a couple of days to sit!  Also, can only imagine if I had the willpower to sit around a few days waiting for them to get even tastier!

I added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, and used spiced rum. Then rolled in coconut mixed with power sugar. I ground the pecans in the food proc, same with the cookies. They don't last one day, so i don't know what they taste like after a few days. These are so yummy. Also, the vanilla wafers now come in an 11 oz box, not 12.  be sure to wet your fingers when making the balls, they will not stick to your hand, and they will tack up so the coconut will stick. I kept a dipping bowl near by.

I added a tad more rum, rolled some in cocoa, some in powdered sugar and some in chopped nuts. Better yet, enjoyed rolling these along side my daughter while listening to Christmas music.

This is an easy recipe and it tastes good, although the rum taste is a little overwhelming.  Don't expect a lot of chocolate flavor.  The rum covers it completely.  If I could have made a test batch in advance, I would have reduced the rum by about 2 Tablespoons and possibly rolled the balls in cocoa, or a mixture of cocoa and powdered sugar.  Provided you do not mind the overwhelming alcohol flavor, the recipe is fine as is.

These are so shockingly good it is unreal!  I would give 6 stars if I could.  They truly are better after a few days.  The texture solidifies a bit more and the flavors all combine into this wonderful mix, rather than any one flavor being dominant (the way the rum is at first).  A tip - the texture is really best if you can mix with your hands, but it will get your hands a total mess because the cookie mix is very, very sticky at first.  It is best if you have another person to do the rolling in the powdered sugar or it gets to be a real mess!

loved these.  made them last year for a family christmas party and just got a phone call from my mom saying that my grandma had called her wondering if I was bringing the rum balls again!  Last year I dipped them in melted chocolate and then sprinkled the powdered sugar, makes them extra rich and tasty!

I made these rum balls for one of our Christmas dessert items and it was a hit.  Even our resident "rum ball maker" who hasn't made them in a few years complimented my efforts.   I will definitely make them again.   They did taste better after a few days (I'd made them four days ahead of time and taste-tested one a day to see if I could tell the difference!)  I didn't quite make as many rum balls as the recipe said it would make, though.  I think I ended up with 30 total.  In any case, this is another keeper!!!

These are SUPER easy to make and they taste great. Highly recommend this recipe. There is a relatively strong Rum taste and there is alcohol in the recipe that's not cooked off -- so these are defintely NOT for kids.

I have treasured my grandmothers Rum Ball recipe for years thinking it was a family treasure only to come on this site and see the exact same recipe. What a wonderful surprise. The only difference was that her recipe stipulated that after mixing the ingredients that it is to be refrigerated over night before rolling.

These are totally fantastic!!!  And sooooo easy to make!  (I used to make my rum balls out of day-old brownies but if I didn't serve them from the freezer right away, they turned into a gooey mess!).  I always have rum balls on hand to serve as dessert after a BBQ or cocktail party.  It doesn't have to be just rum; add any kind of liquor  that you like!  Also, a good tip is to add all the dry ingredients in a food processor and grind them all together.    This recipe is my new favorite!!!       PS: makes about 4 dozen.    I USED GINGER SNAPS INSTEAD OF VANILLA WAFERS!!! MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE!!!! A LOT MORE FLAVOR AND NOT SO SWEET!!!

I started making these for the holidays a few years ago and they are always a hit especially with my stepdad.  The first year I made exactly as shown but since them have made variations - this past year I made two batches - one with Frangelico and hazelnuts and the other with rasperry extract and vanilla rum.

I love these Rum Balls, my ex made them every Christmas. If you can't handle the "overwhelming" rum (I prefer Captain Morgan Rum) flavor, start with little sips from a shot glass, and work up to the Rum Balls. NOT FOR CHILDREN!!!!!

These taste very strong of alcohol so if that is what you are going for it is perfect.  I ended up making a new batch using half the rum called for as these were going on holiday cookie trays.I used raspberry rum which I had on hand.  I also used used the food processor to finely crush the cookies and nuts (almonds). The new batch was delicious and perfect for gifts.

Wow, these were not only easy to make but delicious.  I couldn't find the vanilla wafers so I used chocolate wafers and it only came in a 10 ounce package so I had to adjust the liquid to 1/4 cup of rum.  I don't like things too sweet so I cut down the icing sugar to 1/4 cup.  It came out just right.  I dipped them in melted chocolate and put them in the fridge.  It looks impressive yet very easy.  Will make these again next Christmas.  Thanks!

I make these every year for my friends and co-workers and they are a hit every time.  Sometimes I sub Kahlua for rum and roll them in coconut for a twist; those always go over well.

Very easy to make using the food processor for the vanilla waffers and nuts (we used pecans because of a walnut allergy).  Like some reviewers I had trouble with the balls crumbling but instead of refrigerating, I just compressed the balls with my hands before tossing in the powdered sugar.  Everyone loved them except the teenagers (who felt like "adults" because they could try them).  Very rich and tasty - two went perfectly with coffee for a simple yet flavorful treat.

These are AMAZING!!!!!  I use Malibu Rum, which gives them a wonderful, fresh coconut flavor.  As others have suggested, make sure you grind the wafers and nuts very fine.  You don't want "chunks" in the rum balls.  And they definitely taste better after a full day or two.  These are always a hit and so easy to make!

Holy Moly! these are WONDERFUL! having tried chopping and roller pin-ing nuts earlier (and lacking a food processor) I used an old fashioned hand grinder (attach to the table like for grinding meat or whatever) and it was quick and easy! found this 'Universal' brand grinder in a thrift shop for $4!  I made 2 double batches and used a melon scoop (scrape upwards on side of bowl to pack) and dropped them in a 5:1 powdered sugar:cocoa mixture. YUMMY! I used regular Captain Morgan rum. Giving these and other NO BAKE cookie ball types as Xmas gifts this year ;)

Perfection! I found the reviewer's comments helpful - throw wafers and some of the nuts into blender on low speed to pulverize quickly, chill at least three days for flavor/firmness, and DOUBLE the recipe - they won't last long! I had spiced rum and used 3/4 c rum + 1/4 c water (for the doubled recipe) because it wasn't "light" rum like the recipe called for, but I think I'll try 1 c full strength next time. I used walnuts and reserved half of the amount to chop to give the balls a little texture. This recipe is now in my permanent collection. YUM!

Made 2 batches(US 48) to bring to work, everyone loved them. I used Jerry's Spiced Rum 90proof, only one complaint of being too strong. Served about 30 or so people, some had one and wanted more, others had 5 or 6(too much for one person at work). Recipe was easy, used a hand mixer for ease and consistency, poored rum in first and mixed then added corn syrup little by little. I rolled balls with spoons instead of hands.

Wow, did these cause a stir in our house at Xmas time!  Even though they were too strong (even after sitting 3 days), everyone loved them.  Next time we make these, I will probably let them dry a bit in the open air before sealing them, not to mention cutting the alcohol down to 1/4c.  They were still great though:)

I really like this recipe...it's an easy, no-bake confection that comes together quickly.  I put them in candy boxes and gave them away for Christmas presents.  It's true that these get better with time...by Day 3, the rum mellows out quite a bit.  Even still, these aren't for those who aren't fond of rum!  The rum taste is definitely center stage.

So easy!  I used a food processor for the wafers and almonds.  Since my family doesn't like things too sweet, I cut the sugar in the recipe to 1/2 cup.  I then used Malibu coconut rum, and also a splash of Triple Sec for a hint of orange flavor.  Fast and delicious!

Very good.  I crushed Vanilla Wafers in the blender. Diluted the rum with about 1 or 2 tbsp water,  Perhaps could use orange juice to dilute rum.

Be careful what you wish for. I have to make these every year now, not just for my family, but also for my wife's office Christmas gathering and our neighbors. I use liqeurs as well as rum - Frangelico and Amaretto are winners - and have been considering trying to make a B-52 Ball. I use walnuts - and peanuts are good, too if you're not worried about killing someone - but if you have the $, I bet pecans or almonds would be awesome. I actually back off a little on the amount of walnuts, because they're kind of bitter. I add a little more cocoa and icing sugar in the mix. More than about two-thirds of a cup of booze makes the balls flatten and absorb the icing sugar coating. Canadian Nillas only come in 11 ounce boxes, so I always add 6-8 Nillas from another box. I also roll the mix into a big ball and let it firm up in the refrigerator - a few hours or overnight - then I quarter it, roll the sections into a cylindrical shape and cut them into "coins" of equal size and then roll them into balls, roll them in icing sugar, put them in cups, tray them and refrigerate them for 2-3 days to let everything meld. Freezing doesn't seem to hurt them, either. I get 44-45 balls from one batch. I keep wondering how good this would be with Oreo crumbs...In the photo, my wife shows the remains of the 45 I sent with her to the office. She arrived at 8:29. They were nearly all gone when she texted me that pic at 8:53...As Walter Svetty (aka Alec Baldwin), says, "Everybody loves my balls".

We've made them twice this year.
Tip...when rolling balls to keep the dough from sticking. Dip hands in water and shake excess off.

I just made these and they were so stick to try and roll. I ground up a few more cookies and that helped a bit.  For me there was to much rum.  Hubby's drink of choice is rum and he gave them a 'just ok". I guess we'll see in a couple days how they taste.  My main concern is there is nothing in them that will stiffen up, so sitting out on a plate will often them again.

I made these and they were just grand! I did it alittle different by adding a maraschino cherry in the middle,then dipping the ball into melted chocolate. It gives it a different taste to your holiday! And I also cut the rum down to 1/4 cup and added 2 teaspoons of cherry extract.

The day I made them, they tasted fantastic.  I let them sit over as some others suggested and it was WAY too strong. The ONLY thing I tasted was rum.

I brought these to a Christmas party after they had sat for 8 days to blend the flavors. The people that tried them loved them. I didn't think they had enough chocolate flavor so before bringing to the party I took cocoa powder and powdered sugar blended and rolled the balls. My husband said this made them better. Although I didn't try them again. My sister-in-law would like me to make them again next Christmas.

Delicious. I mixed almonds and walnuts and ground them in the blender and ground up the vanilla wafers too.  I was afraid they would be too strong so I used light rum and used a little less than 1/2 cup.  I could barely taste the rum.  Next time I;ll go full power and maybe even use dark rum or whiskey for more kick.  A great treat.

GOOD. I used sandies  (pecan shortbread) and used an extra ounce or two, almost the whole package. They really are much better after a few days.

The rum was strong, but it didn't bother me as much as the extremely dry texture. I made these and no one in my house would touch them. When I asked why, everyone said they were too dry. I just feel like these are missing some kind of oil/fat.

These were tasty, but I found there was a bit too much rum in them.  Next time I make these, I think I will cut down on the amount of rum.  Also, I made these a week ahead of time and left them in my refrigerator.  They tasted even better a week later!

These were a big hit at my house. I made them to put in cookie gift boxes. My dough wasn't holding together very well at first, but popping it in the freezer for 10 minutes took care of them.  Definitely wait a few days to let them mellow before serving.  The rum starts off very strong.  Will make again!

These were great. Easy, although a tad bit time consuming rolling the balls. I used Malibu Rum and tried to roll in coconut, but it wouldn't stick, so I just mixed the coconut in and rolled it in regular white sugar (not powdered sugar). They were great soft, just made and even better the next day cold from the fridge. I thought the rum mixture was just right, but maybe because I used a smoother rum.

Perfect for the non-baker. Requests are coming in from family who recieved these last year at Christmastime,so I guess they are a big hit. Only change was the substitution of Malibu Rum as previously suggested.

I have always been looking for this recipe. I made them years ago; lost the recipe but the memories lingered on. I was so glad to get the idea of using my food processor as many used.
Thank you so much for a delicious cookie.

Outsanding... However, my grocery store didn't sell the wafers in 12oz boxes so it was fun for the kid to figure out how many wafers it takes to make 12oz.  The rum balls were the BEST.

I doubled the recipe and used captian morgan spiced rum.  I thought they were very yummy esp. a few days later but my husband thought they were alittle too strong....I guess it could just be preference but maybe I would use alittle less rum than called for next time.  My friends that like rum said they were delicious and I thought so too!

These are great!  Easy to make and delicious.  I rolled them in regular sugar instead of powdered sugar (as recommended by a few others)... they have a little crunch and it's a little less messy.

I have been making this recipe for over 12 years. As written, it’s good. The only thing I do different is the rum. I’m a rum lover and have traveled the Caribbean extensively. I recommend a good, aged gold rum. I have used Appleton Estates, Tortuga Gold and Brugal Anejo. The better the rum the better the rum balls.

All I had on hand was Captain Morgan Cannon Blast malibu rum and i'm so glad, because these rum balls taste amazing and the rum taste isn't overpowering at all. I crushed almonds up into a powder consistency and it made very good "dough".  I think the cocoa powder is the real key here. Excellent taste!

These are fabulous! We make several batches and use different flavor rum for each batch.  We also mix up the outside coatings: powdered sugar, red or green sugar crystals, crushed nuts or even cocoa powder. Have fun making them and enjoy!

I've tried several different recipes for rum balls over the years and this particular recipe is my favorite.  I like it because:
-your don't have to melt chocolate over a double boiler and cocoa powder is always in the pantry
-it uses powdered sugar instead of granulated which produces a less grainy texture
Tips: If the mixture seems a little dry or does not hold together well you can add a little more booze.  Rolling in powdered sugar clings better if they are moist.
Variations: Some people find the rum flavor too intense. I have on occasion substituted coffee flavored liqueur or Grand Marnier  with excellent results. When using a sweet liqueur I cut back a little on the sugar. I have made them with vanilla wafers or ginger snaps; both are great. Of course, you can use a different nut.  I am thinking about trying the combination of hazelnuts and Frangelico hazelnut liqueur or perhaps Bailey's.

I make these for Christmas and substitute Rumpleminze for the rum. Gives them an extra kick but also the best chocolate mint flavor.

I used this recipe as a guide to make white chocolate covered Disarrono balls.  I used the Italian liquor instead of rum, honey instead of syrup and omitted nuts and cocoa. I dipped them in melted white chocolate and drizzled milk chocolate over them. Thank you for this recipe.

I hate giving “bad” reviews, but I followed this recipe to a “T” and while they were moist and had so much potential; all you taste is rum, rum, and rum! I love rum and I get that these are “rum balls,” but you literally taste nothing else but rum. I’m sad because I was really hoping that all the flavors in this recipe would have came through....would have been excellent had they.

Made these for work...for our customers. We are a wine and spirit shop, so we often have tastings and offer up recipes with spirits (yeah, I have a real tough job! LOL) . I used our exclusive rum from Barbados and we served them throughout the day to our customers. BIG HIT. Did not and will not change a thing. Used recipe as is - no changes. Awesome!

The only thing I do different is that I use spiced rum. I use the food processor for the vanilla wafers and nuts.
I use macadamia nuts because my daughter is allergic to some other nuts. The macadamia nuts go very well with the rum. Store them in an airtight container and the longer they sit, the better they taste.

I made these rum balls on a Tuesday night for a Friday pot luck lunch at work. I used Vanilla rum as suggested by another person and I also chose to roll the rum balls in different toppings. We crushed (in separate containers) whoppers, an Oreo pie crust, and pretzels. We also had the powdered sugar and shaved coconut to roll the balls in. They came out AMAZING! I would recommend the powdered sugar balls be rerolled just before serving, but I found that my coworkers were already getting into the rum balls by 9:00am and not waiting until the pot luck at noon. haha! They were all raving about them! I also made 2 batches and doubled the rum amount in one of the batches. This made it hard to form the balls when it was time to roll, but after letting the batter chill for a bit we were able to accomplish it.  Enjoy!!

I made 2 different batches using 2 different alcohols. The first I used spiced rum and the second I used banana rum- honestly I prefer the banana rum...I mean who doesn't like banana's and chocolate???? Now I just have to wait to see if everyone else likes them over the holidays...that will be the true test :)
very easy recipe- thanks!!!

Easy to make, even a few hours before presenting at a party. Enjoyed by all "adult" guests.  A new respect for nilla wafers sure to be developed. Tried using a spiced rum and results were quite positive.

I have made these rum balls for years and they are loved  and requested by all my friends and family each year. I typically  triple the recipe and  change the flavor of  the rum according to what is on sale. I do not ever use dark rum because it is too strong. I have also used orange juice for the kiddo's and friends that do not like alcohol.
 A couple of tips : I add a touch of water if it is too dry when rolling . 
I spray my hands with Pam or any other brand  that you have available. it  keeps those hands from being  too sticky! Yes, the processor is the only way to go, you want fine crumbs...
A favorite recipe, but like a favorite alcoholic drink ,these can sneak up on you. Beware of eating more than one or two and driving.....

This was my first time making rum balls and I chose this recipe because it used cocoa powder. I tweaked the recipe and chose higher quality ingredients and specific flavors. I used only 1 cup of chopped walnuts, and chose Ghirardelli cocoa powder, light corn syrup with* vanilla, organic coconut flakes, and Captain Morgans coconut rum. I made 16 balls and rolled 8 balls in the coconut flakes. The testers were so good! I can definitely see myself making these again for parties and maybe as Christmas gifts. My boyfriend says I'll be lucky if this batch makes it one day, much less two, so I don't think it'll be able to properly age at least 2 days.  I think for my second batch I'm going to try using the spiced rum.

Good basic recipe, can be tweaked for personal preference. I used walnuts but might try a different nut next time, and I've used various different types of rum. You can use a little rum, or a lot, depending on how festive you're feeling. They definitely taste better after sitting for a day or so in the fridge! 

I've tossed them in icing sugar, granulated sugar, and hot chocolate mix. All turned out great.

I must have done something wrong, but I used 1 package of wafers 12 oz = 340 grams.  There was not nearly enough fluid to begin to moisten them.  I added maple syrup and more rum, also some oil.  The finally were at the consistency allowi9ng me to roll them.  They are soft, but will not easily roll in anything, e.g. ground nuts.  If anyone can tell me what I might be doing wrong, appreciate it.  I did follow the recipe...only thing I can think of is too many wafers, but it was the amount noted above which I think is correct.

Great - smooth, rich, and decadent! The alcohol is not shy to announce itself, so if you like a milder desert you should cut down the rum / bourbon a bit. I've modified the recipe to be slightly less sweet & slightly more healthy, and soooo tasty. 

BLEND together (Ninja blender - it's magic): 13oz. container of Trader Joe's Vanilla Wafers; 3/4 cup (Trader Joe's) almond meal; 1/4 cup (raw) cacao powder; 3 Tablespoons  agave;  1/2 cup dark rum or bourbon; 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract. 
BY HAND, MIX IN: 3/4 cup finely chopped walnuts (I use the Ninja blender to chop them).
STORE mixture for 2-3 days in fridge to settle the flavor, especially the alcohol. 
BALL ( I use a rounded teaspoon measure to make nice, uniform balls with ease), then ROLL in coconut or almond meal. 
ENJOY!

I used Caña Brava rum. It added a note of fruitiness which balanced well with the cocoa. I also replaced the corn syrup with maple syrup and left out the walnuts (because I over toasted them and they tasted bitter). I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. The flavor was rich and complex, and the finish packed just the right amount of punch. I would definitely make them again.

I add a 1/4 cup of dark chocolate chips melted and used a little less then 1/2 cup of rum to moisten. I cut maraschino cherries in half and put them in the middle of the ball then rolled in powdered sugar Yum!

The key to make this recipe without an overwhelming rum flavor, is to make them a month or two ahead. Alcohol acts as a preservative, and the longer you let them sit, the more mellow the flavor becomes. Put them in an air tight container and shake once a week. Also, if you have enough time ahead, just soak the nuts in rum or bourbon for a few months, then make the balls. As long as your utensils and containers are clean, you won't have a problem. This was always a Christmas treat in my house. Mom would start soaking the nuts on the 4th of july, and by Christmas we had the most delicious, mellow rum balls.

Simple, delicious, and addictive! I left out the nuts for no particularly good reason other than being a cheapskate, and I slightly upped the amount of cocoa and rum (I used Malibu coconut, as per another reviewer's suggestion). I wouldn't have minded still a little more rum flavor/presence, but that's a personal taste issue. My guests loved them!

So simple yet so tasty!  Made these as gifts for friends and co-workers.  My friend sent me a text and said OMG, these rumballs rock!  I used Malibu rum, and reduced the amount only slightly.  They smelled awesome.  I told DH that would be a great candle scent!!  Will definitely make even more next year.

Super easy and non-stick! No waiting for the dough to chill, just roll and go. I used about half the amount of nuts called for (ground hazelnuts), dark cocoa, and Meyers dark rum. They should be good!

I liked that these were super easy to make, but that's all I liked about them.  I made the recipe just as it states, and I thought they were awful - too much rum flavor and not enough flavor otherwise.  No one in my family would eat them.  A friend came over and said she'd eat them, so I gave her the whole batch. Too bad! Luckily I did not make these for our cookie exchange.

Everyone in my family likes rum balls and I usually make several batches around the holidays. This year I wanted to make a new flavor so I tried these. They were a very nice addition to my regular ones. We liked these but they were a little drier than I would have liked. That may have been because I used Bailey's Mint Creme for the liquor and it's a lot thicker than normal rum. They had a great flavor though and I'll make them again!

These were yummy.  I blended the nuts and cookies in my blender to make it easier to mix.  Next time I would reduce the rum, but these were very easy to make.

The rum was way too intense in these, I think I would cut it down next time or use a flavored rum. They were easy to make so that is definitely a plus.

These were awesome.  Definitely better after a couple of days because I had a couple (okay, more than a couple) immediately after I made them and thought for a second that I just had a shot of rum.  I took everyone's advice and put the vanilla wafers and the nuts (I used pecans) through the food processor first.  So easy to make!

I've been making this recipe for years now but I've tweaked it a bit for my family. First of all, I don't drink so I tend to use whatever alcohol is leftover from the previous years baking. Because of that my family calls these "Booze Balls" and no one really cares what alcohol is in them!

This year they have brandy in them. One trick I have learned is to use the food processor to turn the wafers into a flour. Then I add the alcohol and mix well and let it sit for about an hour. The alcohol mixed with the wafer flour will form a dough. I knead it, much as I would bread dough. Doing this I end up with a velvety soft and creamy texture to the finished cookies. No one in my family likes nuts so they are omitted. 

After the base dough is ready I add the cocoa and sugar. I knead this into the dough. Yes, it is a bit time consuming but it's worth it in the end. Then I continue on with the corn syrup and the rest of the directions. I store them in a tight container with sugar in the bottom. I gently invert the container then right it to recoat the balls.

These did not wow me.  I followed suggestions and finely ground the wafers and nuts (I used hazelnuts) in the food processor.  I didn't care for the resulting texture of the cookie.  I may try again using coarser pieces of nuts/wafers so the end product has more "bite".  The rum flavor seemed just right after about 4 days.

They didn't taste as great as the reviews stated. I like rum but something just didn't add up here for me. I took the leftovers to a party and some said they were too strong. Needless to say there were plenty left over.

Sorry to give such a poor rating!  I thought this was awful.  Let me just note that I cook like a chemist.  I measure everything - exactly. My complaint is related to the strength of the rum flavor. It was strong even on day 4. I'm wondering if the air tight container didn't allow the alcohol to evaporate.  Anyway, it was a real bummer to toss these rum balls because the preparation was somewhat time consuming. I'm also thinking it's a pain to dust these things with powdered suger right before serving.  I ended up dusting them on day 0, day 1 and day 4 because they absorb the sugar.  Oh, well!  So far, this was the only recipe I didn't like...  :)

This is a great recipe.  I made it exactly as the recipe called and let them sit for a couple days.  They are amazing.  Nice consistency and the rum is not overpowering.  Only one change and that would be to double the recipe.  They're going fast!

Very easy to make. Really yummy. Couldn't keep my hands off them! Amber rum makes them extra rummy and more time in the fridge ages the flavour nicely.

These are AWESOME! I made these last year and forgot to rate them. My daughter has been bugging me to make them again. The only thing I did different was, I made them with coconut flavored rum and they came out great! My kids ate them before they were chilled for the time required, there's no way I will be able to keep them in the refridgerator that long in this house!
