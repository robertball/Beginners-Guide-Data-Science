I am 1/2 Svenska and want to find recipes to keep my heritage alive.  These seem to fit the bill.  I did some searches and I found a site to buy the tins (Cheftools.com) or you should do a search on eBay for "tart tins":  
Enjoy!

these are really great.Where can I buy the forms? Anywhere in greater Toronto or even Woodbridge area would be very helpful. I really enjoyed these form my sister in law but she does'nt know where to buy the forms. Hers are very old may-be 15 years.
