I did not have a raw jalapeno pepper on hand. I ended up chopping a few homemade pickled jalapeno rings and throwing it in. I did squeeze a little fresh lime juice over the ingredients before mixing. I love this recipe. I didn't bother eating it as a dip, I just ate it right out of the bowl. I didn't even share. Delicious!

I used to make this many years ago and my friends and I just loved it with tortilla chips!  The only thing we did differently was use the bottled hot yellow peppers (1 or 2) and pour in some of the bottled pepper juice.  Low calorie, high protein, high in vitamins - thanks for reminding me about this great spread!

Excellent recipe - full of flavour, healthy & easy to make. Like another reviewer, I wrapped the tuna mix in large pieces of lettuce. 

I also sauteed the onion & garlic for 4min, added 4 thin slices of jalapeno with seeds & pith and ended with ground coriander, not having any fresh leaf coriander/cilantro on hand. Delicious. Next time I will try keeping it raw tho just to try the recipe as originally posted. 

Thanks so much!

Love this - what a great idea - we add extra jalapeno because we like spicy pico - always enjoy recipes with cilantro

I only used a half a can of albacore tuna. Also, I added a clove of fresh garlic, an entire lime and did not take out the seeds in the jalapeno. I began with half of a lime but it was too dry therefore I decided to put the rest in. I might put a little lime zest in next time and possibly some avocado.

I gave four stars b/c it is so easy, healthy, and economical.  I used a tub of pico from the produce section instead of making my own and just added a little garlic salt and lime juice.  A great meal ready in 5 minutes!

So Yummy! My friend made this for me a while ago and I wanted to try making it myself. She added grated carrot and lime and it is DELICIOUS! Tastes great on corn tostada shells.

This was really good (and healthy, to boot!)  I made it exactly as stated, but I think I will add some garlic and lime juice next time as it was a little dry (and garlic because I like garlic).  Great snack or light meal!  Thsi will definitely be a regular in my house!

I liked this a lot, I used lime juice and a tiny bit of cayenne pepper to add some heat.  Great for a quick refreshing lunch! I like avocado in it as well.

I used green bell pepper instead of Jalapeno since I don't like spicy food. Then I squeezed half a lemon to the tuna before mixing with the rest of the veggies. The recipe was great! But it became superb when we added crushed Ruffles (original flavor) in the salsa. We then served it with bread!

LOVED IT!  I LOVE Cilantro.  Love pico de gallo.  Love Tuna.  What a brilliant Idea to mix them together.  I added the juice of a lime as well...LOVED that too.  Served it on crackers for the finale party of a "Biggest Loser" challenge and it was a hit. Thanks!

Really good, definitely add the lime juice as suggested by other reviewers. We also enjoyed making it a little heavier on tomatoes and tuna. Very nice with wheat crackers.

I love making this recipe in the summer to snack on.  I add lime juice & avocado.  If I'm in a hurry I add a can of hot Ro-Tel & serve on crackers.  What makes this recipe for me is to top each bite with Sriracha aka "Rooster Sauce" which you can buy almost anywhere in the Asian aisle of a grocery store.

This reminds me of a mackeral salad my Mom used to make when I was a kid. She used canned mackeral instead of the tuna, added fish sauce, lime juice and cubed cucumbers. Excellent summer salad and healthy too. Thanks for the reminder ;o)

Many years ago I had something very close to this.  It was at a fishing trip in Costa Rica.  It was served before one of the great meals I had all week long.  This brings back fond memories and hunger pangs also.  It was served with buttery crackers for me.  Very tastey indeed.  A little lime does make it even better.

Excellent.  I added garlic power and rice (to make it a complete meal).  My kids loved it and so did my husband.  He added Chalula...which made it even better!

This was great. A fast diet friendly version of tuna salad for me. The only thing I added was some fresh garlic and some lime juice. Served with crackers and my waist line thanks you. =)

Great, easy recipe!  I’ve made pico a lot but never thought to add tuna.  Great addition to add a bit of protein.  Like other readers, I added lime juice to freshen it a bit. Also used Lawry’s garlic salt instead of regular salt. I took a bit and added some fage nonfat greek yogurt to give it a little body to make for easier dipping.   its great either way.  This is extremely diet-friendly and a permanent part of my recipe box nos.

Great recipe! Served with crackers. Refrigerating this for an hour greatly enhances the flavor. This would be equally good with canned chicken breast.

Absolutely love this recipe and it is very popular with all of my friends!I added a jalapeño and habañero pepper to it and left the seeds to give it more spice. Also used fresh squeezed lime juice. Added red and white onion.

The taste is spicy good and I love the protein factor of the tuna.    It's a great quick and simple recipe.  I did add a little squeeze of lemon to balance the pico, though. :)

One of my favorites.  I also add garlic, avocado and lime juice.  I then use regular saltine crackers.  I delicious, light meal.

This is my go to quick, easy healthy meal. I like to add some fresh lime juice and prefer pickled jalapeños since I like mine a bit more spicy and some times even add a bite of the pickling juice.

Very nice! Felt the original could have used a bit more flavour, but that's easily done -- I added some chopped red pepper and ended up adding some garlic powder as well. Lots of lime juice is a must. I ate it wrapped in green-leaf lettuce for a very fresh, ultra-healthy snack.

Great recipe!  I am not a big fan of tuna, but loved this.  I did add more tomato to the mix and some lime juice.

Delicious! I added some lime juice and this tasted somewhat like a black bean salsa that my mother makes. Using fresh cilantro makes a world of difference!

This was quite good! I give it a five for the idea, a four for the flavor. I added some jalapeno juice from a jar of sliced jalapenos. I think next time I'll leave some seeds in from the fresh jalapeno - I like it spicy! I also added some diced avocado, used 2 tsp dried cilantro in place of fresh, and 2 cloves minced garlic, then let it set overnight. Thanks for the recipe!

Very nice recipe, tried it was canned salmon and served with rice along with chips to dip. Added green chili, bacon and black beans to serve as a mid week dinner meal. Thanks for this great recipe idea!

I ADORE tuna! This is great for my lunch times! All the crunches, juices, and flavors from the other ingredients make it absolutely complete! Simple, just spread it on bread or eat it plain! Thank you so much for giving me more lunch foods! I still have some leftovers I can't wait to eat!

Very good low carb/low calorie recipe. However, i did use jarred diced picked jalapeño's and lemon juice due to a lack of a fresh pepper/lime. It's important to note that this dish actually tastes better after sitting in the icebox for a few hours.

This was very refreshing! I followed the recipe and also added a pickled jalapeño, finely chopped. It adds another level of tang. I was a happy camper until my husband saw the leftovers in the fridge and decided it wasn't complete. He added a heaping spoonful of mayo to the whole bowl because that is the type of monster he is. He was happily munching away on a tostada and also said it was really good. I stole a bite of the gloopy mess and have to agree. Moral of the story: this recipe is so dang good there's no way you can mess it up!

YUM! Added the whole lime juice and since I did not have any jalapeños, it was omitted. Thank you for an amazing, quick and easy recipe. I will definitely make this again and will try it with the jalapeños next time!

Thank you for the recipe! Added onions, red pepper, tomatoes, cilantro, lime juice, tuna, salt, pepper, some pepperoncini and juice, olive oil - literally whatever we had. Served with tortilla chips. People who said they didn't care much for tuna... ate it!

I want to try this with fresh tuna, and use lime juice to prepare the fish like ceviche.
