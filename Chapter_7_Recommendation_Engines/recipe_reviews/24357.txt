These were very bland.  I will just stick with my tried and true.  I cut the potatoes in half and scoop out holding the potato with a potholder.  I use about 1/2 cup of butter, add sour cream, garlic salt, no egg, and a package of Concord Foods Potato toppers, and of course, the cheese, and then top with more cheese.  I usually make them ahead of time, refrigerate, and then bake at 325F for 30 - 35 minutes.

Very good recipe!  I added sour cream to the potato mixture, and I also topped the potato off with a dollop of sour cream and some bacon bits after baking.  Here's a little short cut I used to cut down on prep time, I microwaved the potatoes first, then baked them for 10-15 mins to crisp up the skins, prepared the potato mixture, then baked them in the oven for the last 15 mins.

The most important suggestion I can make is to prepare these potatoes ahead of time before slicing off the top and scooping out the inside because they were wicked hot to handle!  I really think I burned off my fingerprints on my left hand!  Next time I would leave out the egg and probably add sour cream.  The filling needs more seasoning also.  I might try a packet of Ranch seasoning or something similar.

After I made changes they were excellent.  I used smaller potatoes (about fist size) and baked at 400 for 1 hour.  I melted about 1/3 cup butter and sauted about 3 cloves of garlic and 3 green onions.  I added about 4 tbsp milk to get all the yummy garlic flavor out.  I added salt and pepper to the butter mixture and added about 1/4 cup sour cream to the potatoes.  I mixed it all together with shredded cheddar cheese (1/4 cup).  I topped the refilled shells with shredded mozzerella and sprinkled paprika on top.  Baked again for 20 minutes.  Yum.

GREAT!!!  I doubled the cheese and used Ranch Dressing instead of Milk.  The only problem I had was that the oil on the skins gave me lots of smoke from the oven, i must have done something wrong there.  but all in all great recipe!  Everyone loved them - Thanks!!   ** new info.  i tried it again and added 1/2 pkt cream cheese and chives.  made it even better

Very simple to prepare and loaded with flavour. My husband didn't believe I made them because they looked so "picture perfect". I have a few twice-baked potato recipes, but I love this one for it's simplicity with great taste. Not a good side dish for nights when you need to fix something quick, but if you plan for it and remember to put the spuds into the oven at least an hour before you want to eat, you'll have an awesome addition to any meal!

To save on cooking time, cook the potatoes in the microwave for about 20 minutes and for added flavor add a clove or two of garlic and ranch dressing... my family loves it !!

Instead of milk I used sour cream. I also added some minced garlic, and crumbled bacon to the filling mixture. Really nice flavour. Smelled great too :)

Overall pretty dang good.  I baked the potatoes the night before and prepared the recipe the morning of.  I omitted the onions and paprika.  I prepared the mixture by hand to get the consistency I wanted and then stuffed the skins.  I cooked them on a baking sheet until they were heated thru.  I then added shredded cheese and real bacon bits and broiled until cheese started to brown.  I wasn't as big a fan as I expected even though they came out as expected.  The components were great; they just weren't great together.  I would definitely use the mixture as a smashed potato recipe!  One note, if you prep the potatoes the night before: use caution cutting the tops off, the skin will be fragile.

The basic recipe was good, but it was really on the bland, dry side.   Maybe my potatoes were too big, but I had to add alot more milk than called for and lots of extra butter, and garlic salt to make it taste better.  . . suggest you do the same.

These were not nearly as flavorful as I had hoped they'd be.  Still, they were easier than many of the other stuffed baked potato recipes I've seen.  Next time I'll jazz them up with some bacon and green onions.

great starter. the egg is the key, add more milk and cheese as needed, depends on the potatoe size. i make mine up to 1 day ahead and pop in the oven 20-30 min before needed. can add whatever extras you like.

Used this recipe at a dinner party I recently hosted.  They were a hit!  
Side note though, if you have large potatoes, double the milk, cheese, egg and green onion.  I also used a 4 cheese mix, added some peppercorn, used the entire bundle of green onion, and threw in some additional spices to give it a bit more kick.  The results were great, very creamy.

My husband and I LOVED these! The egg really makes them fluffy! I microwave-baked my potatoes because my oven wasn't working, and put them in the toaster oven for the last 15 minutes. Suitable for company!

I wonder why folks have to give a lower rating for an untried recipe, then give it five stars after they add their improvements.

As is, this recipe gets 5 stars because it worked and improvements only make it better.

Thank You Rosie139 for my new favorite recipe for Twice Baked Potatoes!

Really Great!!! It went over huge with the family and was super simple... A melon baller helped with the scooping out and everyone added their own "fixings" etc.... I added sour cream to the mixture and real bacon bits... I also microwaved the potatoes for 12 minutes then did the oil and salt/pepper and the oven for 40 minutes and they were SUPER!!!

It was ok, but to me they had no taste but the onions. you couldn't taste the cheese or anything. I fried up bacon and added that, it made it a little better. But i also made the mistake of not adding the paprika.

I microwaved them first.  After scooping them out I buttered the shells and broiled them for about five minutes while I mixed together garlic salt, milk and some of the green onions with the potato then added the filling back in and broiled them again for about 10 minutes.  Added cheese, bacon, and sour cream for a garnish.  They were fantastic!

These were great! I think I added more cheese than called for, but we really love cheese. I also omitted the paprika. Didn't really think the tastes would mesh well. I could be wrong though.

These were great, but next time I make them I'm going to try adding more cheese or paprika to give them more flavor.

I had never done a baked potato before. It  was very easy. I simply  followed the directions exactly as they are. I used parmesan cheese instead and added some bacon bits in the end, in the last 15 minutes.  I ate them with grilled steaks.Wonderful wonderful wonderful

The chopped onions made this taste very bad, but without them it was amazing.  I couldn't believe how easy they were to make too, the potatoes practically fell out of their skins.  A little extra milk and a dash of salt and pepper made these very creamy and delicious.

I wouldn't necessarily say that these are easy to make but that's probably because I was making 25!! It took a lot of time but was worth it. I added garlic to add more flavor and everyone loved it!

I just eyeballed the measurements and I didn't use egg.  I baked some bacon since the oven was on anyway and added it to the mix.  Everyone went nuts for it.

I believe these were the best I have had.  Everyone raved about them. I had added green onions and chopped bacon.  Delicious. A little more work but if was a birthday dinner and Birthday gal asked for twice baked potatoes.

I've made this a few times now and it is delicious. Didn't make any changes to the recipe, it's amazing as is. The potato filling is creamy. The recipe does lend itself well to additions and modifications. Thinking of adding bacon crumbles on top.

This is ok, gut not special.  Not enough flavor in this recipe. It's more like a very basic mashed potato filling.  I guess I prefer the showier, throw in the kitchen sink versions of twice-baked.

This recipe is really easy and a great starter recipe.  I would  have never thought of putting an egg in it to thicken up the insides.  Can't complain at all about this one.  If anyone thinks that it is bland you can add anything to this.  I'm going to make this again tonight.

I have tried most of the similar recipes on the site but found this one to be the best.  The sour cream adds a nice flavor and texture that the others do not have.  Also, these hold over great for leftovers.  I do  use less onions to appease my husband.  Even my 3 year old loves these.

Came out a little soft, and while good, were not the hit of a dinner party.
