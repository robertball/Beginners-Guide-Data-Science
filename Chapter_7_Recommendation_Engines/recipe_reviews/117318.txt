Leaving town in the morning, so of course I cleaned out the fridge. I wasn't planning on cooking, but hubby tells me at the last minute he would like some dinner! Hmmm, half a lemon and white wine in the fridge, some garlic, lots of pasta in the pantry, shrimp in the freezer, and fresh parsley in the garden!  Score! Just a few simple ingredients and I just put a dinner on the table fit for a king!  Couldn't be simpler. Couldn't be quicker.  Couldn't be prettier, and couldn't be more delicious.  Perfect.  I sauteed the shrimp in a mixture of butter and olive oil, used white wine instead of broth, and slowly swirled in a little extra butter at the end which made a silky, beautiful sauce.  Wow--took only as long as it took the pasta to cook and a to-die-for dinner was on the table!  And hubby thought I worked so hard...

Love it. I used white wine instead of chicken stock, added marinated artichokes and omitted the parsley (hubby hates it)... Next time I will add some baby bella mushrooms as well. What did it for me? The lemon juice. Use a fresh lemon... its amazing!

Delicious!  I was getting bored with the usual fare so thought I'd try this.  As I put it on the table, my husband said it was a fancy enough dinner to call for candles :)  We both loved it!  It's simple to make, with most ingredients being at hand.  My variances were spaghettini instead of fettucini (was all out), skipped parsley (had none), added cilantro instead.  I also used frozen, uncooked shrimp which I defrosted and peeled.  I added more broth than called for simply because I was too lazy to measure, and thought it would do better with more anyways, which gave us both a few tsps of buttery sauce to put on top of our pasta.  I've added this to the recipe box already!

An outstanding dish!  I make shrimp scampi for our family and we love it.  This had the exact same ingredients (using white wine instead of chicken broth), but this was saucy for the fettucine.  I also added a jar of marinated artichokes (drained).  My husband and I both stared at the last helping, which is his lunch for the next day, holding ourselves back from eating the rest of it.  It's a keeper!

Not a bad dish, but a little bland.  Next time i would double the sauce and saute the garlic before putting in the shrimp.  Also crush the whole clove and cook in the butter without mincing it, this lets the flavor of the garlic into the butter and allows you to remove the clove after cooking.  Salt and pepper to taste and a slight hint of red pepper giving a little kick!!

This was great! I used precooked shrimp and simply stirred them into the sauce to warm up before serving.  I also subbed angel hair pasta for the fettucine.  The parsley I was a little afraid of, but it was such a great compliment to the other flavors.  I will make this again, soon.

Wonderful! i added 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/4 cup lemon juice.. It was wonderful. I really didn't measure, so I might have over done it.. but the noodles aren't dry and the kids loved it. I also used cajun seasoning instead of salt and pepper and frozen shrimp!

Good recipe.  I also used white wine instead of chicken stock.  I increased the sauce ingredients this time around and it's much better.  Topped our dishes with fresh grated parmesan.

Just cleaned my plate and this was pretty good.  I did make a few alterations: I used 4TBS of white wine, 2TBS of lemon juice but only used 1/2 stick of butter to cut down on fat.  I also used white wine instead of chicken broth, cause I didn't have any. I also added 2 TBS of olive oil as I was afraid it would be dry with little sauce. I also added a few shakes of red pepper flakes for added flavor.  And I used rotini noodles.  My bf and I enjoyed it, and will prob make again eventually.

This recipe was great. I like another reviewer didn't have chicken broth on hand so I used cooking white wine instead, also the sauce didn't thicken very well so i mixed a tablespoon of cornstarch with the sauce in a separate bowl and then added it to thicken the sauce. Served with garlic bread, it was quick, simple and I made it while the pasta cooked. Will definitely make again!

This dish was a huge hit with both my husband and me! I substituted steamed snow peas for the parsley, and the sweetness provided a tantalizing counterpoint to the other flavors. Looking forward to making it again, this time with a bit less butter. :)

I have 4 kids 6 and under, and while they approached the table with their noses scrunched up and saying 'aw, no!!'  they cleaned their plates TWICE!  This recipe is a keeper for sure.  I fixed it exactly as the recipe says.  My husband also says it beats our other favorite, shrimp alfredo.  Thanks!!

My husband actually gave this 4 1/2 - 5 stars, so this is really good (he never gives out 5 stars)! The only thing I did was add about a Tbsp of corn starch to thicken it up the sauce a bit, but a little bit of the starchy fettuccine water would probably also thicken it up. Great recipe!

Loved this dish. I did not measure when adding ingredients. I did use Tony's Catcheres's (not sure of spelling) instead of salt and pepper. It is a southern seasoning and may not be found all over. This was a light, and very yummy. I served the shrimp over pasta and added a salad.

It was a quick meal that my kids liked.  As shrimp goes it is not something I would crave, seemed a little lacking in the spice department but overall a nice alternative for shrimp.  All the ingredients were in my kitchen already.

This was delicious!  I only reduced the stars because of the changes I made.  I only used half a stick of butter first of all.  I used angel hair instead of fettucine.  I used a lot more lemon juice.  And about a cup of vege broth (would have been too dry).  Instead of salt n pepper I used about a tsp of cajun jerk seasoning and hefty shakings of pepper (probably about 1/4 tsp).  In retrospect it might have benefited from a bit more parsley.  I used frozen uncooked shrimp and my family is still raving over how tender I made it in the other room(yay!).  I forgot about the garlic and added at the end so it was basically raw.  And I just mixed it all together in the same pan.  I really liked it

This was good - I added mushrooms and used wine instead of chicken broth like some other reviewers mentioned, and also used 1/4c. olive oil, and 1/4c. butter to cut back back on fat.  I also added some parmesan cheese before serving.  My husband thought it needed more sauce so I may double that up next time.  Very quick and easy.

Yummy!!!  I used homemade pasta (because I had some extra from a few days ago) and the sauce was 'worthy' of the pasta!  I used wine instead of broth, like most of the reviewers here but otherwise followed the recipe.

This recipe was really, really good, but I'm only giving it 4 stars because I tweaked it a little bit. Rather than using fettucine, I used linguine. I also cut down the butter by half and used 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of olive oil. This was VERY buttery, so I can't imagine using as much as the recipe called for. I also added some chopped up grape tomatoes and parsley flakes towards the end. Very good!

This recipe was mediocre at best. I used about 1/2 cup of both white wine and chicken broth and it was still extremely dry.  I also added extra garlic, extra lemon, 1 tsp oregano, a large pinch of red chili flakes, and parmesan and it still lacked flavor.  Rather disappointing.

Extremely simple and very flavorful dish to make. I normally don't modify recipes I find on here too much the first time I make them, but I did add a bit of corn starch to the sauce at the end to thicken it up just a bit. That's just family preference though. Overall a definite thumbs up and keeper!

I used a bag of frozen jumbo pre-cooked shrimp from walmart. I didnt have chicken stock so I used white wine.  I also used 1 tbs of dried parsley instead of fresh. Too make a little extra sauce to go with the noodles, I added some olive oil to the shrimp. My 6 yr old son helped me cook this and we LOVED IT!!   so easy and yummy

I made this last night -- but when I got home, realized I didn't have lemon juice or fettucine.  So I used lime juice and thin spaghetti.  My family loved it & we'll definitely add it to our "favorites" list!

We liked this a lot. Used an extra clove of garlic, a bit extra Meyer lemon juice, and about 1/2 cup home made chicken stock. I mixed the cooked pasta in with shrimp mixture, which allowed the extra stock to be absorbed into the pasta. Topped with Parmesan cheese. I'll surely make this one again.

This is delicious!  I omitted the parsley because I didn't have any on hand and added just a splash of dry white wine.  I made the whole recipe for just my husband and I thinking we'd have leftovers for a couple of days.  My husband finished it off the next day!  Some fresh grated parmigiano-reggiano on top finished this dish off nicely!  We'll be eating this again soon!

Wow!  Excellent!  I made as written except I substituted white wine for the chicken broth and used half the butter.  My whole family loved it and we didn't even miss the extra butter.  Will definitely make again.  Yummy.

Excellent and Easy.  I used more garlic and substituted the broth with white wine, and added broccoli.  It is going to definitely make the repeat list.

What a tasty, fast main dish! Reminded me of a much more labor-intensive Shrimp Diane dish I used to make. This will be my new go-to shrimp pasta meal. Used half olive oil/butter and subed white wine for chick broth (liberal splashes!) as other reviewers suggested. Also added 1/4 t. crushed red pepper and shallots. Next time, going to add mushrooms and green onions and maybe make it brothier w/a bit of chick broth to stretch it. Yum!

This recipe was surprisingly tasty!  It is so simple and quick to make, but full of flavor.  I had dried parsley instead of fresh, and used about a teaspoon.  Instead of chicken broth I used two tablespoons of whole milk since that's what I had on hand. I also threw in a pack of frozen steamed broccoli.  I will try the same recipe but with grilled chicken next time.  Delicious!

Delicious! I was a bit worried about the sauce, I only added a bit more of chicken broth as suggested for the same reason (didn't feel like it was enough sauce) but the flavors of everything combined were very, very tasty! My son who is 6 ate this one right up. 5 stars from our family, and I will definitely be making this one again!

This was fantastic! My family loved it. We added garlic salt at the table and follow other's advice to make extra sauce for the pasta. I did not have wine, but used Mike's Hard Lemonade instead! It's all about flexibility, isn't it?

I thought this was good, but a little on the dry side.  I would make it again, but would leave out the lemon juice and maybe add more chicken broth or seafood broth.  It seemed a little bitter with the lemon juice.

Oh my--this is wonderful!  I took the advice of other reviewers and added chopped mushrooms (I sauteed them in olive oil first) and a few marinated artichokes.  I also used white wine, rather than chicken broth.  Thanks for the great recipe!

every review recommended white white... i just was too lazy to go to the store and get some... so i used a chicken boullion cube with about 1/4 cup water... I let that desolve and added the whole thing... Also when sauteeing the butter i added 2 whole cloves of garlic, and just scored them to help release more flavor.  I am not a big fan of chunks of garlic... You'll be able to remove them at the end. I really don't know how some people can say it lacked flavor... reading the ingredients what flavors were you expecting from it? It's great, thanks for the recipe

This was to die for delicious! I used frozen shrimp, and mini penne pasta. I cooked the shrimp in half olive oil and half butter. Threw in some chopped red bell peppers, garlic, garlic, garlic!, pepper, and onion powder. I can't wait to make this again. It was a hit with my family. Served it with a tossed salad, and garlic bread. Yum!!

This is very good and so easy to make.  I used thin spaghetti instead of fettuccine because that is what I had on hand, and halved the amount of butter but added olive oil for a little healthier dish.  I just wished the dish had a little more zip.

This dish is amazing! I used more stock, more garlic,more lemon and thickened the sauce with a dash of flour. I also grated some lemon zest into the sauce. I had spaghetti instead of fettucine. It was one of the best dishes I have made so far.

I cooked this dish exactly as stated but it tasted as though something was missing to give it that kick.  However is was an extremely easy dish to prepare and also to make.  I will try it again but of course with a few new ingrediates and higher measurements.

This was surprisingly good.  I really didn't think the combination of ingredients would be worth 5 stars, but I had all the ingredients at home and wanted something fast to make.  It was WONDERFUL!!!  My husband said it was one of his all time favorites.  Thank you for this easy, yet very yummy recipe.  Next time I think I'll add asparagas or broccoli.

This was really tasty and easy to throw together.  I thought I had chicken stock or white wine, but found out when I needed to add it that I did not.

Instead I added some stock from the cooking pasta and the flavour still turned out really well.  Will be making this again.

It was a nice dish but it didn't have much flavor.  I used cilantro instead of parsley, and I used chicken broth.  Next time, I am going to add some other spices to see if it makes a difference.  Overall, it was a good dish; it just needs some tweaking.

A very nice change from our regular dinner fare. Simple and tasty! Used margarine with garlic & herbs, frozen pre-cooked shrimp and only 8oz of pasta cause it was just two of us eating it. Thank you for the recipe! We don't often have shrimp so I'm not sure if I'll be making it again or trying a different recipe.
