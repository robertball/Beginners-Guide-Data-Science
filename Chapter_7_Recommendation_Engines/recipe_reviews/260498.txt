Tasty and super simple. My advice is to watch these closely. Once they barely start to brown they go fast. I burned my first batch in a matter of 3 minutes. These are great dipped in ranch and flavor combination is endless. I look forward to playing around with different spice blends.

The oven temperature is nowhere near being correct. I ended up cooking them for like 2 hours before they were even golden brown at all. On top of that when they were done they were disgusting. Will never eat this again.
