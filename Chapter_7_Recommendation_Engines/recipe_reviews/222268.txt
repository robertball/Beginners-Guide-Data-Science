Very tasty and worth doing. I prefer to have somewhat "measurable" quantities - 6 apples can vary so much.  I used 3 cups chopped rhubarb and 5 cups chopped apple (peeled) for my pan; and the taste was just right for our family.

Great recipe! However, I did adjust some things! First, I only put about half a cup of white sugar on the diced fruit while doubling the cinnamon. Second, I only put half a cup of brown sugar in the flour mixture. It was delicious and still sweet enough. Served it with vanilla ice cream and it was a hit. Also took the advice of someone else and did 3C rhubarb and 5C apples.

I enjoyed this recipe as a base to create my own version.  I used some apples that were just sitting on the counter.  I included frozen fresh rhubarb, craisins and chopped walnuts.  It turned out wonderful served with fresh whipped cream.  Yummy!

Turned out great. I made sure that I used a pastry blender to get the perfect crumble going. I did add some other berries to enhance the flavour burst!

We like a higher fruit to crumble ratio so I used 3 apples and 3 lbs of frozen rhubarb that I thawed and drained. I added 1/2 cup each of flour and sugar to the fruit with 1 tsp cinnamon. For the rolled oat mixture I reduced the brown sugar and butter to 3/4 cup each, keeping the oats and flour the same, used white whole wheat for the all purpose, and added another tsp of cinnamon instead of sprinkling cinnamon sugar over the top. Mine baked in 45 minutes exactly. Crisps and crumbles are easily costumized to your tastes, this recipe just had way too much sugar for us, we like the tartness of rhubarb. I made this for #AllrecipesAllstarsCanada #AppleHarvest

Well I would have added a photo but the problem is... The family ate it to quickly. I left the room, came back and it was gone. Really yummy! I followed directions as is except I did not use any white sugar, only brown.  Nom Nom Nom! I will definitely make this again!

Served this for St Patrick's day.  I actually used my frozen Bramely apples from the fall and our home grown rhubarb.  This recipe received RAVE reviews from our guests and I just shared a copy with a friend who wanted the recipe, claiming it was better than her Mother-in-laws!

Delicious. I used 1/4 cup less white sugar and 1/4 cup less brown sugar and it was still plenty sweet.  Threw in a few raspberries as well. Used 5 cups of apple and cut the slices in half.

I cut the recipe in half, because I’m currently using a counter top oven/fryer.  (My oven is broken).  
Otherwise I made it as written.  About 2.5 cups of apples and a little over 1/3 cup of rhubarb.  It is really good. 
Next time I will add a few more apples to change the topping apple ratio.  But it is really super as written.  
Thanks for a keeper of a recipe.

I would definitely make it again.  I subbed in a gluten free all purpose baking mix for my family's dietary needs but that was the only modification I made.  I will definitely make this again.

5c apples (cameo & Fuji), almost 3c rhubarb and I halved the sugar and flour everywhere. Used allspice instead of cinnamon. Should have omitted the sugar on the topping, it was a tad too much. Bust fantastic recipe!!!

Definitely will make this again. I had to use King Arthur Flour gluten free flour blend. I made half a recipe in 8x8  pan. For fruit used 3 1/2c apples and 2c rhubarb. Used half recipe of crisp with 1/2 amount of sugar. Thanks for s sharing such a versatile recipe.

This recipe is delicious!  It's my "go to" when I want rhubarb crisp.  I've made it many times and my family loves it.  It's great as written but sometimes I add some allspice to the apple rhubarb mixture.

Rock star of all the crisps. I have been making apple crisp for 30 years and I have to say this recipe takes the cake. I think that adding the butter in chunks  helps makes this topping 5 star.

It was quite good but there was too much flour in the apples. Need to gauge how juicy your apples are.  Mine were obviously "drier".  So could have / should have reduced the flower.  Also, I replaced flour with gluten free flour and some of the sugar with Splenda. Neither of these adjustments affected the outcome!

Good fruit filling, but a little too much crisp topping. Next time I'd use less flour (maybe 1 2/3)

This is a great recipe!  I like a little more rhubarb so I cut the apples and bumped up the rhubarb to 2 cups.  I made this once and my kids have been asking for it ever since.  Definitely on the menu this week!
