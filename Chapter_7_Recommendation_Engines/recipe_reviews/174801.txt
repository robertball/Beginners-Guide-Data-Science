this cake was great!  i'm not very good at cakes, but it turned out really well.  i used a white cake, and it was super moist, and the assembly was really easy.  i definitely recommend the 'crumb coat' of frosting.  i used a rolled fondant, but i rolled it too thin, so it cracked a bit, but still looked great as a skirt.  as my 3 year old kept saying "it's so bu-tiful!"
