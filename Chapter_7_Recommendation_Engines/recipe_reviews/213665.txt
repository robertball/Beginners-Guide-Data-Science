Very good.  I used tomato sauce instead of ketchup.  The BBQ sauce was awesome.  I added some cayenne pepper as well.

I smoked three pork butts, went out on a limb and made this sauce. It was AWESOME. I'll surely keep this recipe as a staple. Everyone loves it! The only thing I changed was the sugar, adding 3/4 cup instead of a full cup. It produced as the perfect blend of ingredients and worked beautifully on pulled pork! Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe after another AR member, What's, for dinner, mom? raved about it.  I made it as written using every ingredient listed.  The chipotle peppers in adobo sauce really add some kick to the sauce.  It gets a little warmer the longer it sits.  I used this on 'The Best Baby Back Ribs You'll EVER Eat' a personal recipe of Christina.  My DS loves this sauce and has used the leftover sauce on everything, i.e.:  brats, hamburgers, baked beans, pork chops.  He wants me to make him a batch before going back to college this fall.  Thanks BIG CHAD for sharing your recipe.  It is a keeper in this house.

Fantastic!  I cut the servings down to 10.   I used home made ketchup I make for the hubs - no salt and very little sugar. I added 1/2 cup whiskey and used my own brown sugar recipe as well as home made spicy mustard. I added more vinegar to make up for the lack of salt and some tang I like.  I skipped the liquid smoke all-together as it sounded excessive and the peppers had plenty of smokiness. I added black pepper and a dash of crushed red. No salt. I will cut the sugar back a bit next time - possibly use apple juice in place of the whiskey just to try it. I cooked it until thick and it darkened up. It is delicious and very spicy - but we like hot. The recipe is amendable and you can taste and adjust along the way.  I used on BSCB but think it would be great on ribs or on a pulled pork sandwich.  Everyone loved it and will add this to our list of staples!

Very good. Smoky and sweet with just a hint of heat from the chipotle.  Mixed with shredded pork roast and served for yummy dinner sandwiches. We topped our sandwiches with provel cheese and smokey cheddar. This was good and will use the sauce recipe for other recipes.

I'm pretty sure I just ate about 1/4 cup of this sauce with a spoon.  It is so good!  I had some leftover chipotle peppers and adobo sauce that I had to use up and I'm glad I chose this recipe.  I did put the peppers in a blender with the vinegar first, which I think ended up making the sauce a little spicier.  I added some ketchup and some more brown sugar to kill the heat a little.  Will definitely make again!

We're trying to avoid  HFCS so it's very difficult to find bottled BBQ sauce. Well, no need to do that anymore - this recipe is awesome. You can easily adjust the heat and sweet level to suit your taste. I use fresh minced sweet onion and garlic instead of dry. I think it's a little deeper flavor and gives a nice texture to the sauce. Just like the wine I cook with, we use only the whiskey we'd be willing to drink but it's such a small amount that it's totally worth it.

Wonderful with only a couple changes to use what I had on hand.  Omitted molasses, used 3/4 cup of red wine vinegar and about 3/4 cup of white vinegar.  Also, several tablespoons of Franks and 2 additional tablespoons of prepared mustard in addition to dry mustard.  Omitted smike. Perfect!

This BBQ sauce is the Bomb!!!! I have to admit that I don't measure the seasonings just kinda eyeball them (it's an Italian thing) and I just throw a 7 oz can of Chipotles in adobo sauce in the blender with the vinegar and Jack Daniels and blend till smooth! I have used this for Tailgates. on wings, on pulled pork on anything and everything. Every body loves it! Just made a batch for Superbowl Sunday!

Made mostly as-is and this is CRAZY good!  Used a bit more chipotle peppers for some heat.  I've made this 2 ways; 1 using the whiskey, and 1 using 1/2 cup apple juice poured in after it's done cooking.  I think we actually liked the juice one better, but they're both fantastic!  I simmered the sauce for probably about an hour, and it thickened up well.  Important note: 1/2 recipe makes PLENTY!

I cut the recipe in 4 and left out the whisky because I didn't have any. It tasted a little bland. I added extra of everything except the ketchup.

I just made this minus the chilled (I'm the only hot food freak in the house) and added in a half cup of caster sugar to make everyone at home happy. There is great depth to this recipe and can see from smiling faces I'll be making it again!

This sauce was excellent! I used tomato sauce instead of ketchup and a regional whiskey instead of JD. Loved the smokiness of the chipotle and the liquid smoke. Next time I will puree the peppers and will try mesquite or pecan smoke instead of the hickory. Had it with chicken and it really ... whoa! ... awesome! ...wow! ... woohoo! ... what a kick! ... whew! ... was delicious. I will make this again and offer it to all my BBQ guests.

I followed the recipe to a T, and it is perfect! Just the right amount of spice and smoke for my liking. Much better than any store bought sauce. As others have done, I did puree the sauce after cooking so that I could put it into a squeeze bottle and not have to worry about the chipotle peppers clogging up. Can't wait to try it on our pulled pork sandwiches. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I read the reviews and was really excited about this, bc the reviews are pretty stellar.  Since I read the reviews before I made the sauce, I made some modifications.  I minced the chipotle peppers, doubled the whiskey, added 2 tablespoons of water and about 1/2 cup of orange juice.  The last 2 items were because the sauce is very thick as written and I prefer it slightly thinner.  Also, I made only 10 servings and just a little bit of this sauce goes a long way as it is very potent.  I served this with grilled chicken wings, but it would be good on any grilled meat (except maybe fish).

Easy to make and yummy! Not too spicy so will suit most people's heat level.  I might take up just a bit.  Really like the smokiness.  I used fresh onion and garlic instead of the powders then used my emersion blender to smooth it out.  Ready for some ribs today!

I used real maple syrup instead of molasses because that's what I had on hand; and I reduced the portion size to 4 for just one meal.  It's really tasty!  Even with the altered portion size, it's delicious, and a keeper for sure.

This is a super easy recipe to make!  My family really likes it.  For me, it was on the verge of being too spicy but I'm still working my way up the "spicy" ladder.  Will keep recipe and make again.  This does make two - 32 oz ketchup bottles full of sauce with about another 1.5 cups or so extra....

A very good BBQ sauce!  I used this on some pulled pork, worked nicely.  If the sauce reduces too much and gets too salty and sweet, just add some water to mellow it out a bit, worked for me!  Thanks!

Made this recipe as a test run for a grilling competition my husband is in at work.  (Winners get $$ donated to the charity of their choice)  We will be making 2 gallons of it to use on the pork shoulders he will be smoking!  Amazing flavor and sooooo easy to prepare!  My kids loved it!  Definitely will be making this again!

Great bbq sauce with ribs! Halved the whiskey and used Crown Royal (canadian rye whiskey) instead, and no jalapenos or coriander but a dash of chilli powder, and it still turned out great!

Excellent BBQ sauce!  I used Hunt's salt-free ketchup and "No Salt" salt substitute in place of the kosher salt to produce a sodium free version (due to high blood pressure problems).  I also used minced garlic and minced onion in place of the garlic and onion power to give it some texture.  I did have some trouble trying to bring it to a boil over medium heat, air bubbles just kept rising and bursting on top, splattering the stove and wall.  I ended up dumping the whole pot into the slow cooker and simmered it in there for 4 hours which worked like a charm.

This is a great BBQ sauce! I don't think I will ever buy it again, just make it at home with organic ingredients :) I don't even boil it and it tastes amazing as soon as it is mixed together! I did boil it the first time but it was too long ago for me to compare the taste. So if you don't have time, just mix the ingredients together and you will be happy! Thanks for the great recipe ;)

This is delicious! The chipotle in Adobo sauce made the difference. The whiskey also added great flavor. Wow!

I made this for 10 servings and because I was looking for something not too sweet, made the following adjustments. I first sauteed some onions and then added the sauce ingredients. I used 1 cup tomato sauce and 1.5 cups ketchup. Instead of 2 T of apple cider vinegar, I used 3. I added about 2T freshly chopped garlic. I didn't have molasses or whiskey and used 1.25 tablespoons maple syrup and 1/4 cup apple juice respectively.I also didn't have smoked paprika and just used plain paprika instead. I omitted the brown sugar completely. Plan is to place it in the slow cooker with some ribs overnight. Sauce right now is just a little tangy with some kick, but not overpowering. For those who like it spicy, would recommend adding more adobo chilis.

We use tomato sauce instead of ketchup to decrease the sweetness.

Excellent, smoky-sweet flavor!  I halved the recipe and used some with a pork roast in the slow cooker.  I served the additional sauce on the side but still have plenty left for another recipe.

10 stars from me....this was an amazing sauce! Super simple to put together and so very tasty. Beautiful consistency and flavor was to die for. We used this on shredded bbq beef sandwiches and also topped with Cindy's Coleslaw from this site. I cut the recipe down to 10 servings and used Gentlemens Jack instead since that was all I had on hand. Planning on making this again soon! Thanks!
