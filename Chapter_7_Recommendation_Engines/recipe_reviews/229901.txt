I still used half the sugar the recipe called for.  I've never used ginger in my apple butter so it was a nice twist.  The family enjoyed it.  Thanks!

Making a second batch! I did however add salt, as you must always add some salt with making something sweet. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.

I will make it again. I used a variety of apples and less sugar. My husband really likes it. Thanks.
