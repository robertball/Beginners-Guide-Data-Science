This meatloaf was delicious although I did have a couple small changes to it.  I used garlic and onion tomato sauce since my grocery store did not have the Mexican tomato sauce.  I added about 8 shakes of Tabasco sauce for the missing heat.  I also used 1 teaspoon garlic powder, half teaspoon oregano, half teaspoon basil and half teaspoon parsley since I don't have the Mrs.Dash.  I also only used 11/2lbs ground turkey because that was the amount I had frozen.  This was the first meatloaf that I loved and didn't smother in ketchup!

very tasty meatloaf. used regular tomato sauce and added some chili powder. skipped the chopped green chiles, only because i didnt have any. and also used pork, veal, and beef mixture as opposed to just ground beef.

This was delicious.  I made a few changes based on what was on hand:  I sauteed 1/4 diced onion, 1/4 diced jalapeno and 3 smashed garlic cloves and used in place of the green chilis and garlic powder.  I mixed the ground beef with the onion mixture, eggs, bread crumbs and soup mix, then added 2 tsp Italian seasoning and 2 tsp chili powder  and regular 8 oz can tomato sauce .  Then I topped the meatloaf before baking with Medium Picante.  Really good, will make again!

I made this recipe as written with one exception. Instead of the using the hot tomato sauce I used one cup of a local made salsa. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing this.

I've been making this meatloaf for a while and can't believe I haven't rated it before now.  It is really good.  The hot sauce in the can is important as we've tried it with regular sales as well and not as good. Uses a few things that we don't normally keep on hand but worth the effort.

Made this tonight and it was spectacular as written. Not bland as some meatloaf recipes but rather a nice spice flavor. I couldn't find "Mexican-style hot tomato sauce" at my grocery store so used Pace picante sauce.

YUMMY!!!!!!

i tried it with the quinoa customization and i can't help but wonder if it should have been cooked before it was added to the mixture because it got all crumbly.

i reduced the beef to use 12 oz of chorizo and it added some heat to the meatloaf. 

can't wait to make this again. YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM!!!!!!

I used quinoa instead of bread crumbs and everyone really loved it.
