I boiled both the kohlrabi and the potatoes, only added the potatoes after the kohlrabi had boiled for about 5 - 6 minutes.  I didn't have any cheese, so I just ate them plain with some sour cream mixed in.  Next time, however, I'll eat them with cheese because really, what's not better with cheese?!?  I like the way it lightened up my potatoes and gave it a nice (yet not overpowering) earthy taste.  Viva la kohlrabi!

Very similar to Colcannon. I agree that you should boil the kohlrabi a few minutes before adding the potatoes (5 sounds good), or those pieces remain a bit crunchy and hard to mash. I added garlic powder (instead of garlic scapes) lite sour cream, olive oil spread, sea salt, and lactose free milk...mashed like crazy and served. Tasted yummy. This was our first time eating kohlrabi, and I'm not disappointed :)

I STEAMED the potatoes (skins on = more nutrients) and kohlrabi ( the latter being in much smaller pieces so that it cooked faster reading that it takes longer) because steaming helps RETAIN MORE NUTRIENTS than boiling. I also FINELY CHOPPED THE KOHLRABI LEAVES (stems removed) because they have significantly MORE NUTRIENTS than the bulb itself. After cooking the potatoes and kohlrabi I added the leaves with the potatoes and kohlrabi pieces to the blender (easier than mashing or food processor - I have an unusual blenderâ€¦). Blended it all together with a tablespoon of MELT, put it in agreased little crock dish, covered with a little layer of fresh chopped parsley and then  spread over that a layer of shredded pepper jack (just what I had on hand but could easily be a multitude of cheese options, or something vegan - will ponder that..) and baked for a bit till the cheese had a brown light crisp - about 425 for 15 mins. Added a little salt to taste in my bowl and was AMAZING!! It was the first time I've even done anything with kohlrabi so it was a great experience. I plan on tweaking this to be vegan to take to Thanksgiving for me and my uncle and his gf. :) STEAM!!! ADD CHOPPED LEAVES!!!

I changed the ingredients slightly and adjusted the method. 

Slicing the potatoes and kohlrabi equally, I added the garlic and let cook while I browned German sausage in a cast iron skillet. Then I put the potato and kohlrabi mixture into the skillet, sliced the cooked sausage and put on top along with the cheese. 

Baked in a 350 degree oven for 1/2 hour. Delish!

Wonderful way to use up kohlrabi.  I didn't use enough garlic scapes and will add extra next time.  The potatoes were a bit gummy, so added a little cottage cheese to help cream it up a bit. A+++ recipe!

We enjoyed this, but it seemed a little bland as is.  A bit of sea salt helped.  Boiling the potatoes and kohlrabi in vegetable or chicken broth would probably also do it (save some of the broth when draining in case you need to add some back to get the mashed veggies to the right consistency).

This is very good   Had made Mashed Kohlrabi and Potatoes before but not with the cheese and garlic - a real flavor enhancement. Thanks.

Wonderful recipe.  I boiled kohlrabi 5 minutes then added the potatoes and boiled 15 or 20 minutes more.  After mashing and adding the cheese this was awesome. No need for anything else.

I added milk, butter., salt, cheddar cheese, and garlic to the mash. Covered with mozzarella and cheddar before baking. Clipped my garlic scapes on top. Super yummy!  It reminded me of a cheddar and broccoli soup.

A nice twist on mashed potatoes.  I just cooked them both in water and mashed like potatoes and added spices.  A little bland even with the cheese, but this makes a good base. Possibly a sauce would go well.

I used golden potatoes and boiled them with the kohlrabi. I drained when soft and blended in the mixer with milk, butter, salt, pepper, sour cream, and cheese. Delicious!!!

This was a great way to use a lot of CSA ingredients, but like other reviewers, thought it was bland. I used cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella, and added oregano, salt, adobo, and onion powder, and it was delicious. A side of roasted cauliflower gave the meal some crunch.

This was really yummy and used a bunch of ingredients from my CSA bag! Never had kohlrabi before but it was surprisingly easy to cut up and cook. Next time might use parmesan or cheddar instead of mozzarella. Garlic scape gave a nice flavor without being overpowering. Delish!

Didn't have time to bake, and needed to add Parmesan cheese to compensate for inadequate amounts of mozzarella, but it was quite tasty!

Surprisingly good.  I used fingerling potatoes, because that is what I had on hand.  I didn't even peel them.  Yum!

My husband and I both loved this.  We have never kohlrabi before, so I thought this would be a good one to try since it was mixed with the potatoes.  Delicious exactly as it is!
