This is a great recipe for when you're craving clam chowder, and don't want to wait.  Here in Rhode Island, we have an abundance of clams, so I make this one often, using quahogs that my boys dig up.  

My one issue with this recipe, as-is, is that you have to make sure that the flour is adequately cooked, or you get that raw-flour taste.  In order to do this with the sautee-the-flour-with-the-potatoes method, you run the risk of making the potatoes a bit mushy.  If you have a bit more time, make a roux by melting a 1/2 stick of butter and cooking the flour in it for about 5 minutes.  Wisk the roux in with the dairy before proceeding with step 4. You'll have a creamy and nicely thickened chowder with no lumps!

This soup is outstanding. I was able to cut a lot of fat from the recipe with the following changes, and no loss of flavor: drain most of the bacon fat, there is still enough in the pan to cook the potato and onion. Use 2 cups of clam broth, and equal parts cream and skim milk until you get your desired thickness. I usually use more skim milk than cream. This may make the soup a little thinner, but I like it that way :) and its much healthier, so you can eat more and not feel guilty! Go ahead, have the 2nd bowl!

Really good recipe.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 is I will make a couple of changes next time.  I will add celery when cooking the onions & potatoes.  Also I will not drain the clams and maybe add some more.  I did thicken at the end with a corn starch mixture as we like our chowder thick.  Thanks for the post.

This is  probably one of the best clam chowders i have had - if not the best.   I always make a double batch as my family loves it just as much as I do.  I did make some alterations, however.  I found that the recipe called for too many potatoes for my taste, so I used half the amount called for. I also doubled the flour (I like it to be a bit thicker).  The recipe doesn't say if we are supposed to use the juice from the canned clams, so I discard the juice from one can and use the other.  and the final change that i like the best is that I put a half tsp of dried thyme in before I add the clam juice to the potatoes.  My accolades to the cook, a  very well done recipe, and definitely a keeper!

I saved the crumbled bacon and added it to the soup just before serving--this recipe was wonderful.  I used 3 cups of half and half and instead of canned clams, used the crab from the foil packets they sell now.  This recipe was so well received, everyone went back for second helpings (and I have two finicky eaters.)  Another trick I've learned with other soups is to take a bit over half of the potatoes and dry mash them and add them to the soup to help thicken it.

This was very easy and quick to make, and really delicious! I didnt' drain the clams, though (no instructions to do so) so the soup got a little thin, and I had to thicken it. Next time, I'll drain them. I did add some of the crumbled bacon back to the soup, and it was very good. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Delicious and comforting, especially on the days when winter swirls about us here.  I don't care for the flavor of canned clams as I feel I can taste the tinniness, but we are fortunate enough to be able to buy them freshly frozen, and that to  me makes the difference.  I live in the hills now, but with a steamy slice of corn bread slathered with honey butter and a ton of clams just winking at me, I'm young again and back on the Cape Cod dunes in the wintertime!

This was pretty good.  I do prefer my chowder much thicker and this turned out more like soup.  Will use more flour next time.  I need to keep looking for a good brand of canned clams.  Tried two so far and neither was very good.  Hubby loved this, but agreed it should be thicker.

I doubled this recipe but I used a whole 5 pound bag of potatoes. I adapted this recipe to the crockpot. I just cubed the raw potatoes and covered them with the clam juice and the four cans of minced clams (also with the juice that was in the can with the clams) and one can of organic chicken broth. That cooked on low all day until I came home from work and finished it. I did a quick mash with an old fashioned potato mashed for a chunky soup, then added in the bacon, sauteed onion (along with fresh garlic and chopped fresh carrots.) I didn't have any cream on hand, I used one can of fat free evaporated milk instead. After tasting it, I added a little red pepper flake. This was good but I wish it was more clammy. I was quite impressed I could make this in the crockpot and now that I know I can, I don't know what's stopping me from doing that from now on. Next time, I'll make this the same way only I'll add even more minced clams and clam juice.

Was absolutely to die for and fairly easy to make.  I enjoyed it even more on the second day!  The heavy cream is a must in my opinion!  I also recommend more potatoes and clams to make it extra chunky.

For clam chowder this gets 3 stars.  I followed this recipe exactly as is - it's a very good potato soup, but there isn't much clam chowder to it at all.  My son and husband both liked it, but both were disappointed when they came to the table and there was no clam chowder as promised.  I'm going to keep looking for a decent clam chowder recipe.

My wife and I prepared this delicious soup in our cabin in the woods of Nantucket. Here are a few pointers we'd love to share with you:  Start by cooking the diced ham alone on high for 5 minutes. Add a random splash of canola oil after the ham starts to burn to the bottom of the pot. You'll get a real agreeable smoked flavor that way. Next, boil the onions, clam juice, and potatoes for no less than 20 minutes. I also added 3 tablespoons of flour and strictly heavy creme to give it a consistent consistency that will not soon be forgotten. DELISH!  PS, although this slight spin is eternally scrumptious, I must ask, did anyone else's soup taste like cigarettes?

Having traveled extensively through New England and living on Long Island, NY, I've had my share of New England Clam Chowder and can honestly say that this came out excellent.  I made one minor change, namely adding some thinly sliced celery with the potatoes and onions.  I also didn't drain the clams (the recipe didn't specify whether to drain or not, so I won't call this a change) because at first the mixture seemed a little thick.  After adding the Half & Half I decided to reduce the liquid by letting it simmer a little longer, which turned out to be an excellent idea.  The clam flavor remained while the water evaporated.  It didn't do the potatoes much harm either, they stayed quite chunky.  Served with some crusty Ciabatta bread, this made for a quick and wonderfully warming winter meal.

Have made this several times and found that more flour coating for the potatoes will help with the thickening of the chowder, or mix a little cornstarch afterward until desired consistancy.  I also put in 1 tbl. of red wine vinegar and it gave it that final touch.  Thanks for the recipe.

You must be from New England. This is how "chowda" is supposed to taste.  The only thing different that I use is salt pork rather than bacon. Great job!!

excellent recipe. Having lived in the Boston area for almost my entire life, married to a commercial fisherman, the only thing I do differently is instead of using flour to thicken it, I add instant potatoes after chowder is done. But that is just a matter of taste. Chowder is delicious as it is.

This was a test recipe for our monthly gourmet club. We just had this with our neighbors to test it out and we all agreed that this recipe is the best New England Clam Chowder we have ever had. No modifications were needed. Thanks for the recipe.

My family are big chowder hounds, but they did not like this one. It did not have the creaminess or thickness we were looking for, and the clam juice made it taste too fishy. Also, way too many potatoes. Seemed more like a potato chowder.

Delicious! More flour needed if you like it thicker. We make our own steamed clams with all the fixins and use the broth from that cook as the base. I also added extra clams, celery and chopped up the leftover chourico and linguica from the cook and added it right in. Hubby said it was good enough to enter into a contest. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great, easy to follow recipe! Thank you. Other than making a larger quantity, I really didn't change much. Next time I might use more milk and less potatoes. But it's great just the way it is. My wife loved it and the 5 star is her rating.

The flavor of this recipe was good; however, it reminded me more of a potato soup than of a clam chowder.  My husband, who is a great fan of clam chowder, was not impressed by this recipe.  He said it tasted like a potato soup to him as well.

I made this for my Super Bowl party this year and it turned out great! I think I adjusted the servings to 28 or 30 and proportions were good. I love Clam Chowder and this was great!

Great recipe and really easy to make! We only used two potatoes, four was WAY too much, and added some extra flour to thicken it up. Next time I'll just add in the optional heavy cream. And for some extra salt, make a little extra bacon and crumble it into the soup, it's delicious, especially in a bread bowl! Big hit with all my roommates!

My goodness is all that needs to be said. My aunt and i get together just about once a month a cook something new together and this recipe got a 5 star rating from the family!!!!!!Added a small amount of thicken at the end, and extra clams because my husband loves clams, but the recipe was perfect.

I did some variations as well, hence four stars, but I like to play with different flavors than recipes call for so this is a mix of some of the other reviews.  I boiled my potatoes to get them softer (Small cubes for about 10min) Drained them and made the rest of the chowder in the pot as called for.  I also used Dill and Thyme and Garlic Salt.  I added corn (about half a can) to add some different texture and flavor.  The bacon is an excellent addition to this recipe.  After doing Step 4 I kept the temperature on low so the potatoes would not keep softening.  To top it off i coated the top of the chowder while still in the pot with Parmesan shredded cheese, very tasty!!! I did add about 2 tbsp of cornstarch after cooking about 25min to thicken the soup to our preference.  Really great with French Bread!

Simple and delicious.  Doubled the flour.  Didn't have enough clam juice, substituted chicken broth.  Used fat free condensed milk for the half and half, and a bit of half and half for the full cream.  Mixed in dried parsley for color.  Some of us preferred it without the bacon, but all of us enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing it!

This was outstanding and easy to make! I wouldn't change a thing. I wasn't sure about adding the liquid from the canned clams but did so and am glad. I made it a day ahead and added the cream when I reheated. YUM!

This was very yummy!  I read some of the reviews ahead of time, and I really believe that to get the best flavor is to use the half & half and heavy cream.  I added some celery and a small amount of chicken broth, but followed eveything else exactly and it came out perfect!  Served it in bread bowls and had zero leftovers!

I was worried since this is my first time making it but I really liked it and my wife like it a lot also.  I'm hard to please when it comes to chowder since I used to live in Rhode Island. Never made it before and I'm happy about how it turned out.  My second bowl was the best since I put a bit of tabasco sauce on it.  Next time I'll make it a little thicker but good recipe.

Oh boy.  Wasted 2 cans of great clams on this.  There are better recipes, even on this website, that have a much better flavor, texture, method and result. AND they take no longer, no more effort.  Really.  Chowder is easy.  Chowder is fast-ish.

I used olive oil instead of bacon fat and evaporated milk instead of the half and half to have that rich creamy taste.

YUMMY!

My husband loved this soup.  It was really easy/quick to make, so I love it too ;).  The only change I made was to use a little extra bacon and add it directly to the soup instead of uing it for the top.  Fast, Easy & Good = 5 stars!

This wasn't as thick as we would have liked it to be.  And I also agree with some of the other reviews that the potatoes were overwhelming and it almost tasted like potato soup.  I think I would try this recipe again but tweek it by not using as many potatoes and increasing the flour content and probably  throwing in the clam juice from the canned clams for extra flavor.

Growing up in New England and now living in the Mid West, my husband and I got a craving for New England clam chowder.  I chose this recipe b/c it didn't call for any water.  The flavor was good, but it was a bit on the soupy side.  The New England clam chowder we are used to is very thick and full of flavor.  I will try to make this again, but tweek it a bit.  I also think that I will cut down on the amount of potatoes.

I thought this recipe was just OK. More of a creamy potato soup with some clams added. It's good for a fast, filling meal if that's what you're looking for.

Yummmmm. Quick and easy. I used 3 cups clam juice leftover from steaming 50 clams. Used leftover bacon fat. Omitted flour accidentally but kept it that way because I like thin soups and chowder. Added 2 diced carrotts. Absolutely delicious.

1st time chowder brewer.  My husband & I drove up and down the coast of MA & RI (we're Native Southern Californians). Had some great chowder, but this recipe topped them all. Used large Costco cans of  clams, drained reserving the juice, rinsed to get all the sand out of it.  Also thickened much more with flour and cornstarch.  Next time will add celery & mash half of the potatoes as suggested by another reviewer.

All i have to say is , "yum"!  Soooooo good! Definitely be sure to add the cream, makes it so rich and delicious. The only thing i did different was i added a splash of sherry to the clam juice while the potatoes were simmering. And, instead of the flour i did a mix of cornstarch and water and added it right at the end. Wonderful recipe for a chilly day  =)

This was a great recipe. I ommited the bacon, and used whole milk instead of half and half (only because I forgot to buy it). I also increased the amount of flour to make it thicker. My whole family enjoyed it!

Very easy and quick.  The only complaint I have is the amount of bacon grease used.  My husband thought it was great and had a slight steak taste, I thought it overpowered the clam flavor.  I'm sure I'll make it again, I'll just adjust for my tastes, and reserve only a tablespoon of the grease.

This was an ok recipe, definately not something I would serve to company coming over.  It was a little on the watery side, felt more like a soup than a chowder.  Did not remind me of what New England Clam Chowder should taste like.  But none the less it did have some flavor.

Really good homemade chowder.  Only had one can of clams, so changed a few things.  Used a little more bacon, doubled the potatos and clam juice, added 4 chopped carrots, and added the crumbled bacon to the broth with about 2T dried parsley and 1/2t thyme.  Did 1.5C half and half.  Husband raved!

My Dad made this same chowder when I was a kid- all except the heavy cream. We always mixed the bacon in the soup with the clams instead of a garnish. That way you get the yummy bacon flavor. I've never seen NE Clam chowder served with the bacon as a garnish but I live in the Pacific N.W. far away from New England. If you like clam chowder, this is the way to do it!

Fantastic!  I didn't use the extra half cup of cream - it is plenty rich and wonderful as is.  Wow - soooooo good!

Amazing! Easy and yummy! I used white beans instead of potatoes, and added extra pepper. Also added 1/4 tsp of thyme and old bay seasoning.

Delicious chowder. I used bacon bits in the first step to save the work (: Rather than add the flour to potatoes, to prevent mushiness I whisked the flour into the half and half...(I actually used evaporated milk since we had no half and half) I chopped celery and added it to potatoes and onion which I sauteed in olive oil. Instead of heavy cream I used 1% milk and butter so I doubled the flour to 2T. Clam juice is a must. I tried on my second batch to use chicken broth as a substitute since I had no juice. It wasn't the same even though I used 3 cans of clams. Also pour the juice from the canned clams right in. Yummy!

This recipe was really good but I did made some changes according to the reviews listed. I doubled the flour and cooked it with a stick of butter (I am sure you can use less if you want, but this was just perfect for me) before adding it to the potatoes. I also used the juice from the can of clams (it was in clam juice not water or oil like some cans come in) instead of buying a the jar of clam juice, and I added thyme and oregano along with the parsley. My boyfriend is a very picky eater, but he cleaned the pot with this recipe!

Living in the North East I've tasted some very good NE Clam Chowder.  This is as good as any.  Simple to make too.  I did, however, add 3 stalks/ribs of chopped celery with the potato and onion mixture and an extra can of clams.  Another thing to remember is that it is always better the second or third day.

This is the first time I've reviewed a recipe from this site although I have a recipe box full of good dishes.  I have to say though, this was so good and easy to make!  Most recipes have bacon and my husband doesn't eat bacon, he loved this chowder and it will be a much repeated meal!

This recipe is simple and easy to make. My wife and daughter are lactose intolerant so i used lactaid milk instead of half and half and very little cream. also we bought clams in clam juice so we used the juice from that instead of buying more.

This chowder had a delicious flavor and we totally loved it.  But when I make again, I will add more clams and clam juice, it didn't really have much of the clam flavor that you would expect in a clam chowder.  Also, I thought there were too many potatoes, next time I will probably only use 2 potatoes.  It was more like a good potato soup with a few clams thrown in.  Since other reviewers said it was too thin, I used 2 Tbsp. flour, but still needed to add some instant potato flakes to thicken it up.  Having said all that, it really was a delicious soup, just not clammy enough for my taste, but  that may just be personal preference.  I will defiitely make again though, will just add more clams next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

great recipe! I made it for my dad who is ill with cancer and he ate every bite... After reading the reviews, there was someone who wanted thicker; in that case you could at any time during the cooking time, add some gravy flour a little at a time till you get the thickness you desire. As for the juice in the caned clams; it is better discarded, as some have preservatives such as MSG and no one wants that in there mix. Great job! Nan

The soup itself is excellent. Even though I gave it five stars, I did have one problem with the recipe, but nothing that can't be fixed. I think that there are too many potatoes. If you perhaps cut the potatoe ratio by half and only use two potatoes it would be better. Also, in addition cutting the potatoe ratio add some celery/carrots/peppers to give it more color and different textures. Overall, the soup was amazing.

Very good, very easy, very comforting.  I did add a carrot and a rib of celery.  My hunny likes veggies.  We had this for Valentine's dinner.  I used a 10 oz can of baby clams and a 6 oz can of diced clams.

Super delicious and easy.My 12yr old son made it himself with some suggestions from me. We doubled the flour and added a tsp salt & minced garlic clove when sauteing the onions. We used  1 1/2 cups fat free half & half at the end. We also added 3/4 cup (canned or frozen)sweet corn b/c my son likes it.

This makes a great clam chowder..but cut back a little on the potatos..dice them pretty small.  I follwed a reviewers advice and made a roux instead of flouring the potatos, this way no lumps!  I love bacon..(who doesn't?) so I put cook more than the recipe calls for.  One more thing...for a kick...I add about 5 drops of tabasco sauce.  Delish!

I was very excited to prepare this for my family last night.  I have to say it was the worst thing I ever made.  I followed the directions exactly and the soup was very thick.  Needless to say it was not a big hit at our house.

I thought this was excellent, it was my first time making clam chowder. I did change a few things such as I just used the juices from the canned clams, also I doubled the flour, which in the end made it way too thick, stew like so I just added in more half and half until I got it back to my desired thickness, I also doubled the bacon and stired it into the soup, added  1/2 tsp of thyme and paparika. lots of salt & pepper for my taste buds!! was excellent I am about to take it over to my dads to see if it passes the test!

Excellent!  To me there is never a reason to buy canned clam chowder.  This is easy and delicious.  It is absolutely fine to use whole milk and a dash of half-and-half.  It will be thinner, but that's what my family calls "homemade chowda".  This version is the more authentic "restaurant chowda".  Both are delicious!

Preparation for this recipe is very easy and the results are very good. My husband likes clam chowder, but says this was the best he's had. To quote "my tastebuds were in heaven!" Thank you for sharing this recipe, we will use it again.

Great soup and so simple! I like a little spice, so I added just a little cayenne for a background zing, and I used 1 and 1/2 cups half and half instead of using the 1/2 cup heavy cream. My family loved it - especially my 2 year old son (!). A huge hit and will definitely be a staple in our home.

I think this recipe is VERY good.  I used the heavy cream and also added a bit of Rosemary and a 1/4 stick of salted butter.  I also crumbled the bacon and added that in at the same time I added the clams.  My husband liked it too but wanted it a little thicker so I think next time I'll double the amount of flour.  It was so rich and flavorful, thank you so much!

I haven't actually tried this, but gave recipe to a co-worker who LOVED it. He said it was perfect. He added more potatoes and thinned it out with milk the second time around (leftovers) to make more, and still AWESOME.

I found the flavour excellent.  However, I'm confused about the potatoes.  I found there were more potatoes than liquid.  What kind of potatoes are you supposed to use and how large?

This was phenomenal, I'm very impressed.  The heavy cream is a must.  I also added extra potato's.  Thanks for the great recipe.

It is very good, excellent taste.  I am just a little confused about what you do with the bacon.  Do you take it out after cooking it and put it back in with clams or do you leave it in while you saute the potatoes?  

The other thing and maybe this is just me but if you overcook the bacon and it burns a little the color of the soup turns gray.   We do love the taste

I made this recipe x5 for friends at a "New England" Patriots/Panthers superbowl party and was asked for the recipe several times. It was a hit and it tasted even better the days following.  I highly recommend it, it's a special treat.

Perfect  recipe. No changes. No additions. But.....The heavy cream isn’t reall an “option”  if you like your soup thick.

Tasted more like potato chowder and definitely lacked clam flavor. We made this for the Super Bowl (Go Pats!) and was disappointed in the soup

I used 2% milk and added 2 Tbl flour after I cooked the onions in the fat from 3 slices of bacon.    Also added 1/2 teas thyme and I used the liquid from two cans of clams.  This was very good even without the cream.  I will make again.

I’ve made this twice. The first time I made it exactly as written, but we thought it needed more clams. This time I added a third can of clams. I also added the juice from one can of clams while the onion and potatoes cooked. The other 2 cans I drained. This time it was perfection!

Instead of bacon, I used 4oz diced pancetta. Cooked it till it was crispy, drained it on paper towels and kept ALL grease/oil leftover from the pancetta in the pot. Cooked the onion and only 3 small diced potatoes (used russet). I didn't need the bottle of clam juice because I used the juice from the minced cans instead. Used 1 cup heavy cream + 3/4 cup skim milk. Came out chunky/creamy the way we like it. Added a few dashes of old bay seasoning along with salt and pepper. Loved it - so did our 14 year old who doesn't like seafood.

Very good.   Made for super bowl Sunday for New England patriots.  Add a little cayenne pepper for kick and color. Double the recipe.  You can use the clam juice from the cans and add bottled clam juice.  Did not use the flour as I didn't want the taste.  Let simmer for several hours.  Thickened up nicely.  Serve with crusty French bread.

Family loved it, added more cream and half and half. I also put in lump crab meat, an additional can of clams, and also steamed shrimp with old bay. I also put the bacon in the soup instead of a garnish, It was awesome!

I took the advice of another reviewer and made a rue and mixed it in after my potatoes were soft, it came out EXCELLENT! Also, I just added the cooked, chopped bacon to the chowder with the clams, vs using it as a garnish. It was delicious.. I mean.. how can you go wrong with bacon? Right???   Thank you for an excellent recipe! We make it all the time!

Subbed arrowroot powder for the flour to make it GF. Also bought Napolean brand smoked clams on accident but it added such a great element of flavor! I rinsed them first. Doubled clam juice and half and half. Yum! 12/11/16 Hubby told me tonight he doesn't like smoked clams. Also no flour or AR powder - just blended up half the potatoes for thickness.

Made as written the first time. Not bad, but not clam chowder either. Second time, doubled the clams, added some celery with the onion, skipped the flour (didn't need it) I used all the clam juice in all the cans, with came to just over a cup and a half, and puréed about 1/4 cup of the potato soup before adding it back in with the clams. Also skipped the cream at the end. Much better clam flavor. Would give that at least 4 stars.

I made this for my family and it was a hit. I made some slight changes such as adding  two chopped carrots, using baby clams (whole, not minced and with liquid) and cooking for a bit longer. I always don't like it when there is not enough clams, so I used around 20oz. in the entire pot, and it was perfect. I also added the optional heavy cream.

Over all, I'm quite delighted with the recipe and I would definitely make it again.

I'm giving it a 3 as is for chowder, maybe a 4 as a base and you can add your own extras, like I did after I finished cooking it.  After tasting it I added some onion salt, celery salt, thyme and a dash of savory.  I also mashed up some of the potatoes after they softened to thicken the chowder up, it worked great.  I did use the clam juice from the cans and I'm glad I did, it helped the taste.  I did forget the parsley at the end.  I'll make again, using this as a base and add my own seasonings. Might even add another can of clams.  Make sure you don't use large potatoes.

Not a very flavorful version of clam chowder.  I'm sure it can be altered to suit.

I made one small change in my recipe. I added another can of clams and only put a splash of heavy cream in. I then stick blended some of the clams to get some of the thickness naturally than having to add some of the heavy cream.

A simple yet excellent recipe that everyone should try.

I was looking for my clam chowder recipe I've had on a card for years but could not find it.  This is it, with one exception....add the juice from the canned clams too.  Easy and very good.

I changed/subbed a few things based on what I had on hand. Skipped bacon, used 2 medium redskin potatoes, 1% milk rather than half and half and only had about 1/4 of an onion. I also only had one can of chopped clams. I par-cooked the potatoes in the microwave and sauteed the onion and potatoes and celery flakes in 2 T of light butter. This was so very good and took 25 minutes.

Very Delicous!  Using the heavy whipping cream a must!!!  It puts this receipe over the top.  To thicken it up a bit, try adding a little instant mashed potatoes!!  I did that and reduced the amount of whole potatoes.  Turned out great!!

Great and easy to make!  My wife has gotten me cooking and I am one of those people that should not be in a kitchen!  Although, I attempted to make this chowder and I was amazed how well it came out!  Only thing different I did was add to many potatoes (which I will correct next time) and I add 3 cans of clams instead of 2 (good idea).  This is great, thank you!

Excellent.  My husband requested this soup but I've never had it myself to know what to expect.  He was quite pleased, and so was I.  The bacon and parsely as garnish added a wonderful flavor.

I liked this recipe. I doubled the liquid (clam juice, half & half & heavy cream) though because it is not a lot of soup. I did however add the bacon back into this and it tasted more bacon"ey" than clam chowder. It was still very good, just not what I expected. Next time I will just not add the bacon back to the soup :) Very easy & quick recipe, thanks!!!

This was very good but I still need to "tweek it" before I get the same flavor that my grandmother used to get. It was however very satisfying and only wish I had made a larger amount as I like to have chowders left over.

This was really good,  although I did make some changes which is why I did not rate 5 stars. I used more bacon, just because we love it, and I added celery and sauteed it along with the onion in the bacon grease. I used 3 cans of minced clams instead of 2 and used the liquid to cook the potatoes in (cut them small and used 3). I whisked a couple tablespoons of flour in with 2 cups milk and used 2 cups half and half as the base. Added a few dashes of hot sauce and garnished with green onions. Delicious served with oyster crackers. Great comfort food. Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe. I read the reviews and holding back on a potatoe was a great tip. Also, I like my chowder to be thick so I also addes some flour and cornstarch. You can't knock a recipe to make it how you like it. Great thanks!

This was so good!  Simple, yet satisfying.  My family loved it.  They tease me, that I'm not the best soup-maker, but they really liked this one.  The only thing I would do different, is add some more clam juice--I personally like alot of clam flavor.  Enjoy!

A bit too much potato. It's OK, but I've had much better. I've made it exactly as directed, but definitely needs more clams.

Though very easy to make, the flavor was overwhelmingly of potato and bacon.  I could barely taste clam.  I thought it tasted boring. I ended up throwing in some canned corn niblets and sliced crimini mushrooms and turned it into some other sort of chowder.

This is excellent.  I doubled the recipe, but only put in 5 potatoes diced, which was more than enough for us.  Very similar to my mother's clam chowder.  Left the crumbled bacon as a garnish for those who wanted it.  Great comfort food for us New Englanders.

this made a very good, thick, creamy chowder.  I served it to a large group and received many compliments.
