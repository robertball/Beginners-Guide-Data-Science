Had this New Years Eve and it was great. Did not need any seasoning at all just some black pepper.  Excellent!

Very very good.  Backed off some of the salt as it soaks in pretty good and does not need any additional  It was tender and kind of fun for the kids to laugh at  the "helmet" that formed over the meat.
