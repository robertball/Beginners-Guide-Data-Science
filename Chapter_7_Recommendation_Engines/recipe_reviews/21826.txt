I thought the horseradish was too overpowering and would not make this again.  It tasted like meatballs with cocktail sauce to me. The meatballs did taste ok by themselves.

My family thought this was a keeper.  I did use a large (15 oz) can of cranberry sauce and added some chopped garlic to the meat mixture.  Also, I did not use any milk, as my ground turkey was quite "watery" as it had been frozen.

I made this with all white meat ground turkey.  My husband sneers at ground turkey, but was impressed.

Great and Tangy!  My husband loved this dish.  I did make small changes.  I used 1/2 cup green onions and whole berries cranberry sauce.  Then I doubled everything for the sauce except the horseradish.
