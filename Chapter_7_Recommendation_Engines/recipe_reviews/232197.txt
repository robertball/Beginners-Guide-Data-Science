I doubled this recipe, skipped the liners, used Pace Cilantro Lime salsa and homemade fajita seasoning. I DID NOT add the peppers, onion and garlic to the crockpot to cook all day. Instead, I sauteed them when I got home, then folded it into the cooked fajita meat. VERY good. I paired this with spanish rice and refried beans.

This made some of THE BEST fajitas I have ever had in my life. I did tweak one part of the recipe though. Instead of using store-bought fajita mix, I made the Allrecipes Fajita Seasoning and used 7tbsp of it in the recipe. Mind blowingly awesome!

Fantastic recipe.  I wolfed down two servings and am looking forward to re-heating it for lunch today.  I cooked on high for about 3.5 hours.  There was not a whole lot of liquid so I flipped the chicken/stirred a couple times to make sure everything was heated through.  Didn't bother with the liner.  Recipe is definitely a do-again.

Turned out really well. I put the tortillas in a skillet, sprinkled with shredded cheese, and added the meat mixture and more cheese. Slid onto a plate when cheese was melted and then dressed with lettuce, sour cream, jalapenos,salsa. Delicious!

This recipe didn't work for me at all. The chicken fell apart to the point we renamed the dish "Pulled Mexican Chicken" Plus the meat was dry and the veggies were soggy even though I put them when it only had 45 minutes left, and it was way to soupy.. to the point it turned the tortillas soggy when we assembled them, Tried draining, but no luck. I never had dry meat, but I had to drain juice off.. I did like the idea of the salsa instead of water. Next time I think I will make fajitas the old fashioned way and use the slow cooker to keep them warm. The searing helps keeps the breast meat moist.

I made this recipe exactly as the recipe states, except for using frozen chicken breasts and homemade fajita seasoning.  It was very well received at dinner last night, but next time I would add the peppers half way through cooking.  My peppers/onions were basically cooked away even though I sliced them fairly thick.  I would probably also increase the amount of peppers/onions and garnish with chopped cilantro.  I used the liner, which was absolutely wonderful!  Thanks, Reynolds!

Very good and easy!!! I followed the recipe to the T. I did cook on low for about 7 hours and the chicken just fell apart when stirred. These were so easy and and so good! I will definitely be making them again. My son and husband loved them as well!

I did a super easy version, frozen chicken on the bottom, sliced onion and bell pepper, a few fresh jalapeno slices for a kick, topped with a jar of salsa and sprinkled cayenne on top. Cooked on high for 5 hours, shredded it up with a fork and ate with corn tortillas :)

We love this.  I use the recipe for fajita seasoning on this site.  Also put my peppers and onions in about an hour or so before done.  Really good!

So easy and delicious! I threw 2 frozen chicken breasts in with the salsa mixed with fajita seasoning and cayenne sprinkled on top on low for 5 hours. I then added chopped up onion, red, yellow and orange peppers (leftover from a veggie platter). Served with salsa, sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes and cheese. Took the chicken out about 1/2 hr before serving, cut it and mixed it back in. Will definitely make again!

This is a great recipe. Both of my kids and my husband (and I) really enjoyed it as written. When I was caught off guard and needed to make dinner in a snap, I used the seasonings from this recipe to make fajitas in a skillet. Sadly, I wish that there were some leftovers so that I could have some for lunch. For those of you whose kids don't like veggies or allow your kids to dictate what is for dinner, you're the adult. Make dinner the way that YOU want. Unless they are allergic to an ingredient, there is no reason to make a separate meal.

My kids went crazy over this recipe. I did not change a thing for them. I however do not like fajita flavors at all, so I made one for myself that used taco seasoning instead and it is amazing. I also had stuff that would be used for a taco(refried beans, lettuce, tomato etc, I have 3 teenage boys so I have to make food last)all I can say is this is a 5 star recipe. I have been told I will make this again in the next two weeks. Thank you for such a great recipe.

I thought this was amazing. The store was out of chicken fajita seasoning so I used the mccormick gourmet steak seasoning and it was still amazing. This makes a TON though, so be ready to have some leftovers. I don't particular care for the chunks of pepers and onion in my fajitas, but I love the flavor they add. So I only added half of each pepper and half the onion.

WOW!! New family favorite!! I omit the packages of fajita seasoning and season mine with paprika and garlic power. I also use two teaspoons of fresh pick de Gallo! After about 5.5 hours on low, I shred my chicken, recover and cook for an additional :45-1 hour. Leftovers are amazing as quesadilla filling the next night!! Thanks for sharing!!!

It was not fajitas.  It was way, way, way, way too soupy.  Although I was hopeful,  I do not think that fajitas can be made in the slow cooker.

This is delicious. I made two batches, one as directed and one for picky kids. My daughter doesn't like veggies mixed in so I omitted the onion and peppers and just used onion powder and half of the recommended cayenne pepper. I also ran the salsa through a strainer so she wouldn't have any vegetables mixed in; just salsa juice. I used 1 cup. I shredded the chicken since it was falling apart anyway. I used queso cheese on the tortillas before adding the chicken and toppings. Both batches came out wonderfully. I used the leftovers on top of baked nachos... yum!

The chicken shredded to pieces and looked more like "pulled" chicken.  My husband and I prefer crispier veggies and this recipe turned the veggies to mush.  I gave this recipe three stars because the sauce was very good.  I ended up incorporating the leftovers into a baked penne dish that turned out pretty good.

Very good.  Of course, didn't bother with the silly liners.  My only regret is that after serving, I left the rest to cool on the counter a bit and fell asleep on the couch so had to throw out the leftovers.  

I used the taco seasoning mix from this site instead of the package fajita seasoning.

This recipe was really good! I used onion powder instead of onions (bf doesn't like them) and only one packet of fajita seasoning. Used two large chicken breasts and broke them up a little more than halfway through cook time. Otherwise, I followed all other instructions as written. Cooked for about 6 hours on low. Will definitely make this again.

Good! Served at a party where I had a taco bar. Only changes I made was made the fajita seasoning myself from recipe on this site and I sautéed the onion and peppers in some olive oil and put them in with the chicken about halfway through. Very good and well received. Would make again!!

The meat was really tender and the flavor was good.Only downside was that it tasted a little salty. Might be the fajita seasoning I used.Going to try a different one next time.Otherwise, this dish was really easy and satsifying.

This was a good recipe! Next time I will fry up the veggies then add to meat, and I also mistakenly bought only one envelope  of fajita seasoning but so glad I did, perfect flavor with just one.
My husband loved it!

I have made this a few times. It's soooooo easy, and it's so good. It's pretty healthy, too, what with just chicken and some vegetables. The first time I made it, I didn't realize it called for two packets of fajita seasoning, so I only used one. It wasn't until I went to make it again that I saw the recipe actually called for two, but it was so good the first time, I just continued to use the one packet. I'm such a rebel!

Delicious. I used Allrecipes fajita season with 4 chicken breast in a crockpot on high for 4 hours. The last hour I added the vegetables. I also added 1/2 can of Rotel diced tomatoes and green chilis.

This is a great simple recipe. The only problem that I ran into - was finding the powder fajita mix. My local Publix had a fajita sauce in a pouch - I used this. The flavor was great, but it was very watery.
I'll check other stores for the powder mix next time.
I froze the leftovers and will use it to make a Soup - I'll add corn, canned tomatoes and black beans.

one of my families favorite meals! I throw the ingredients the slow cooker before work and when we get home from school and work the house smells delicious!!!!
Note- if you add more than 3/4 c salsa it tends to get watery.
I also use 2 packs of McCormicks Organics Fajita seasoning packets. I order by the box on Amazon. We make this recipe at least 2 times a month!!!!! Thank you Karen for sharing!!!!!!

I ate the chicken fajita recipe right out of the crockpot - no tortillas, no cheese, no sour cream and it was delicious! I think next time I make it I'll just make white rice and serve over the rice with a little bit of cheese on top. Can't wait to try it again. Easy and wonderful!!

We LOVED this recipe. My hubby usually likes fajitas cooked with green and red peppers but never puts any in the tortilla. Since it was all cooked together, he piled it all into the tortilla, added cheese and tomato and said they were the best fajitas he's ever had! Will definitely make again (and again lol).

Good for when you feel too lazy to cook.  Next time I'd go for twice as many onions and peppers.  There seemed to be a lot of liquid in the slow cooker at the end.  Maybe I had runny salsa or something.  Anyway, it's an alright recipe with potential.

The CRock Pot just can't do fajitas justice, but my kids ate it so I can't complain.

In the future I  would definitely double the veggies.

So delicious!!  I add beef as well and just up the ingredient and serve with refried beans and Mexican rice, oh and don’t forget the white queso and chips. I would rather eat these fajitas than the ones on a sizzle plate at the restaurant.

Came out really well. I used a medium hot salsa and no cayenne. It still had a pretty good kick. Used green onions instead. Will definitely make again! Thanks.

I read through the reviews-and decided to do a quick see her on my chicken strips before putting them in the crockpot. I did this with half of the onion and some of the seasoning. I also held out the remainder of the onion and the bell peppers and put them in about a half hour before we were going to eat. Readers are correct there is A LOT of liquid, However we used tongs to lift the meat out and it was lovely. I will definitely make this again. Oh-I did not use seasoning packets, I found the Allrecipes recipe for fajita seasoning and made up a jar full-used about 6 tablespoons of it with the salsa. I have the rest stored in a jar for future meals!

Delicious flavours. The peppers and onions sweated out so much that the dish was quite watery first night. Reheated leftovers in oven second night and the dish improved.

I loved that this was so easy to make, the only part that drove me crazy was having to wait for it because it smelled so good. I added in some cumin, a little salt, some pepper, some Zatarain’s Blackened Seasoning (which I admittedly put on everything), a can of hot Rotel, and a lot of minced garlic. This was all in addition to the original recipe. It turned out well and I’m happy with the result!

I started with frozen chicken, so I added a little bit extra cooking time.  Came home to chicken that was cooked, but salsa that was completely charred on top.  I scraped it off, pulled the chicken apart, and added new salsa about an hour before serving.

Excellent!  Chicken was so full of flavour and moist.  I used allrecipes fajita seasoning recipe and used it all.  I added the onions and peppers at the start and they were over cooked at 2 hours.  I added more onions and peppers with 40 minutes left and the were perfect.  The mushy veg may have added to the flavourful chicken so I will make it the same way next time.

I made this recipe with just one variation. I used some tomatilla/avocado salsa from the fridge and it worked just fine. I probably could have added some additional heat but everyone seemed to really like what I served send my son even asked for the recipe for himself.

I didn't bother with liners, and used red, orange, and yellow bell peppers, but left the rest as is. They are amazing! Adding to my list of family favorites. So easy, too!

First time I made this I had a left over chicken breast, so I put the veggies in the slow cooker for the afternoon and when I came home from work I sliced up the chicken and added it to warm it up. It was great! Better then sauteing the vegetables in  a pan. The second time I made it I added frozen chicken breast to the slow cooker and as others have said it comes out too soft. Shreds very easily, but I like having a chunkier piece of chicken in my fajita. I will definitely make again with left over chicken.

Made this using 5 tablespoons fajita seasoning mix from this site. Cooked on low for 7 hours, chicken was super moist. Also fried up some extra onion and peppers and added to fajitas along with Mexican Rice III from this site, sour cream , salsa and cheddar cheese. These were  fantastic.

Really good dish. I waited until the last hour of cooking to add one red bell pepper (omitted onion and cayenne completely). Delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious!  I made my own fajita seasoning (from Allrecipes site) and used chicken breasts cut into strips.  I planned to add peppers and onions when serving (after sauteing) but I ended up making Spanish rice and refried beans, and we just had those inside the tortilla.  So, more like a burrito I guess.  But the flavor of the chicken was amazing and I will definitely be making this again!

I was looking for a delicious recipe that featured the slow cooker and came across this version! I'm so glad I did because it was a delicious addition to weekly night meals, and I had so much fun making it.

This is a very tasty, easy recipe. For whatever reason, mine was very soupy, so I had to add some corn starch to thicken during the last hour. Worked great. Next time I will probably throw the peppers in towards the end of cooking because we like a little crunch. Flavor is great though and pleased even my picky teenager.

After reading the reviews I did not add the peppers and onions in the slow cooker. I used a little more salsa and sautéed the vegetables in a pan before saving. It came out pretty good.

I made it exactly according to the recipe.  The flavor was OK, a little too spicy for me, but it was too watery and mushy.  Had to be eaten in a bowl with a fork rather than as a fajita.  Don't think I'll make it again.

It was so simple and absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly. I was skeptical at first with just 3/4 cup of salsa and all that fajita seasoning that it wouldn't come out with enough juice but 3.5 hours on high and it came out perfect! I cut my peppers up a little bigger than normal and didn't have any issues with it being too soft! It was perfect!

This is a family favorite.  I follow directions except I use taco sauce instead of salsa only because I don't like salsa/tomatoes. Kids ask for it weekly.

My husband and I loved this, the flavor of the mix is just as good or better than a Mexican restaurant. We did find it too salty for us so next time I make this I will cut the salt amount in half. You can't go wrong with this seasoning mix.

these were OK. super liquidy and soupy. had to try to drain it. not the consistency fajitas should be at all. I added the peppers 1.5 hours towards the end and they were still too wet and soggy. I love crockpot meals that are simple and easy, but some things are just better made their original way. this is one of those things.

Made it as written except used the fajitas mix from site. Not too salty but would add several more peppers next time.

Made this again and lovedit. Used the fajita mix recipe from this site. Doubled the peppers and cut things much bigger.
  Much better, the peppers didnt cook down into mixture.

Such an EASY and delicious recipe!  I've made this a few times now.  I just put everything in the crock pot before leaving for work and the house smells fantastic when I get home and even better, DINNER is READY in no time.  This is a great go-to meal for busy, working moms!

I used a 2.5 lb frozen chicken breasts. I would use more chicken.  I skipped the liner and this was amazing.  I also used the fajita seasoning on this site to make my own instead of purchase.  Family loved it is a do again.  Yummy.

Good and easy recipe.  I followed the recipe, however, used another reviewer's suggestion for using the Allrecipes Fajita Mix.  

Yes, this is convenient when you have a busy day, BUT I will stick to the old fashion way of making fajitas, they just taste so much better especially the freshness of the veggies and the texture is more of what I am used too (just saying).

Really Yummy!!! I used 3 frozen chicken breasts and cooked on low for 2 hours, on high for about 30 mins, and then I shredded the chicken. I then put it on the "keep warm" setting for about 2 hours and it was perfect then. I am still trying to understand my crock pot. I added a little water because I thought it may be dry...that was a mistake. Great recipe as is.
