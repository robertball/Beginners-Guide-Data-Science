Left out the optional MSG and replaced it with Adobo seasoning. These turned out really good. They were super crispy and the soy sauce gave them a deep golden brown color. The green onion got lost in the batter. I would save them and use them for garnish next time. If you are looking for crispy wings, look no further.
