This recipe was good but something was missing. I added just a little salt & that made it much better.  As with most casseroles, it's even better the next day.

This was easy and delicious!  The leftovers are great in tortillas as burritos.

I did everything that this recipe told me to do and, well, let's just say that we had to go out for dinner because of the results.

My fiance and I both loved this. I used 1 lb of ground beef, canned tomatoes with jalapeno; also used 1 1/2 tbl of chili powder, 2 1/2 tsp 
of cumin, 1/4 tsp of garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon  of dried cilantro. Everthing else i kept the same. I highly recomend this recipe; tastes great and is some what healthy.

I used leftover chili in this recipe and just added the rice, sour cream, and cheese.  It was really easy and quick that way.  Very good.

So uniquely flavorful and beautiful colors.  My husband loved it!  I used cinnamon instead of cumin.

This dish wanted to be spicy but didn't quite make it.  It was good, but the rice added a bland flavor to it.  I'm going to make it again using Mexican rice and see how that works.  I think it just needs a little extra kick!

I thought this was very tasty, although my husband found it to be bland. We added black olives and used a good sharp cheddar. I'll probably add some seasonings or salsa to the rice next time.

This is a great recipe to make..... if you want your husband to take you out for dinner! We wound up throwing every bit of this away.

I quite liked this - it made a small amount of beef go a long way.  I added freshly chopped garlic and about a cup of frozen corn kernels.  Then, because the mixture seemed a little watery, I added about a tablespoon of cornmeal to thicken it up.  It was tasty, quite spicy, and well received at our house.  Good simple casserole for a wintery, cold, snowy day!

Unexpectedly, this was better than I thought it would be.  I used 1 lb of hamburger, increased the chili powder by an additional 1/2 TBLS and used heaping amts called for the rest of the spices. Also, once the rice was mixed with the sour cream and the meat was cooked, I mixed the two together rather than layering and mixed in chedder cheese in the casserole and sprinkled some cheese on top. A bonus to this is that the ingrediants are simple and you always have them around.

Very easy to make, but I found it rather bland and uninteresting. I added a bit of chilli to the meat sauce and that improved it a little.

Great! I used these as Burritos. I combined the beef and rice, omitted the sour cream and added half the called-for cheddar cheese. Serve with the rest of the cheddar sprinkled on top of the burrito, and a side of refried beans. Hot sauce too!

I didn't care for this at all.  It was too dry and needy spicing up.

This recipe was kind of bland.  I added some fresh banana and jalapeno peppers and extra chili powder, but it was still bland.  I had to substitute the tomatoes for corn because my husband has been getting hives from tomatoes (we think???)  I did top mine with salsa.  It seems that the problem with this recipe is the rice mixture.  There was too much of it.  I think using mexican rice would help add flavor.  It tasted best when eaten with corn tortilla chips, rather than wrapped in a tortilla.

I made this the other night for dinner.  I substitued ground turkey for the beef and brown rice for the white and kicked up the spices a little with some garlic and extra of everything.  BF and I totally enjoyed it - 9 yr old daughter -- not so much.

I substituted ground turkey (one pound) for the beef and added cayenne pepper and a teaspoon of liquid smoke.  My family flipped over this recipe.  Definately a keeper!!!!!
