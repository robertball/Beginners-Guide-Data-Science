I halved the recipe, Used ICBINB spread, pureed the mango in my mini food chopper, and cut back just a little on the honey.  It looks nice with tiny bits of mango in the butter, texture is good, and it spreads easily.  The mango flavor is subtle, however, a ripe and flavorful peach or nectarine might be a better choice for this recipe IMO.  Had this on ciabatta toast for breakfast along with some sliced mango.

Ok, but it was more like honey butter with mango chunks. Would have been nicer if the flavor was through out the butter.

i poured the butter into little candy molds to chill so when i serve it with pancakes tomorrow i can just pop one out an place it on the pancake!!!! it will b so cute.....have to take a pic or two to post tomorrow! i found that the butter wasnt really whipping up well, so i added more butter. There was too much mango. Oh, and for u above that didnt like the butter, i chopped my mango into like cubic centimeter sized slices and chopped em up in the food proscessor.

While tasty, this mango butter doesn't hold together, even after refrigeration.  Any kind of tip by the person who submitted the recipe or by other users who have been successful with this recipe, would greatly be appreciated.  Not something I'll try again, otherwise.

Too much honey. Couldn't taste mango at all. 
Will try again with less honey, more butter and a bit of flour to thicken.
