This is a fantastic traditional little dish that i have grown up eating in England.  If you want it lower in fat go half and half with low fat mayo and half fat creme fraiche.  Add a dash of worscestershire sauce for a twang and have it in a sandwich or on a Jacket Spud(large potato baked in the oven in its skin until the skin is crispy and the inside fluffy and lovely!) I tend to prefer chopped dried Apricots and sultanas to fresh mango, for more of a kick used spicy mango chutney!  Yum!!!

We really enjoyed this.  Presented on a bed of lettuce leaves it looked really impressive.  Even my mother asked for the recipe after having this at a family gathering. Will definatley be making this again, great with guests.

Wicked good! I didn't include the cashews and used regular rasins and lime juice as I forgot to purchase lemons.  This came out great and will be very tasty to eat for my dinner during the upcoming week.  I put it on a bed of brown rice.  I'm going to try it with reduced fat mayo or maybe plain yogurt to make it a little healthier.  A+!!

I'm not a big fan of curry, so I only put in 1/2 a teaspoon. Otherwise I didn't change anything. I enjoyed the dish,which is something to be said for a curry dish. Looks like the leftovers will be good on pita  bread for lunch.

I heated this with a milk sauce to serve over rice. It was super delicious! I was skeptical about the raisins but they turned out to be the best part.

Good but be careful with your mayo.  Olive oil mayo makes for a slimy feeling in the mouth in this dish.

I was getting nostalgic for the coronation chicken I used to serve when I worked at a sandwich shop in England, and this hit the spot.  I don't normally like cooking with so much mayo, but it's an essential part of this recipe.  It was nice served on lettuce with toasted brown bread on the side for dinner, and I plan on making a sandwich filling of the leftovers.

This is not traditional coronation chicken. It is a nice enough chicken salad, but definitely not the original recipe created by Constance Spry for the Queen herself! I would omit the cashews.

I have to admit I was a bit apprehensive about using mayonnaise for this but it turned out really well. It's quick and easy to make too. The flavor and texture's great and the recipe is quite versatile in that it could be served as a cold salad or heat it up for a warm accompaniment to bread or rice. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

I've made this a few times now, both just for our family, because it's easy, and for company because it's delicious and gets great reviews. I, like others, just threw in regular raisins instead of buying sultana ones. Thank you for the recipe, it's different from our norm.

I got a mango from my CSA and needed a recipe to use it with. I've never made anything like this, and it was sort of different from our usual fare. But tasty. I just went ahead and mixed all the mango pieces and the cashews in, instead of saving them for garnishing. I really like cashews, so I used a full cup, and we didn't have sultanas so I used regular raisins with good results.

Great recipe, my folks loved it! I subbed low-fat mayo but otherwise followed the recipe. Served it with a curried chicken fried rice that complimented the sweet mango taste of the main dish. Next time I'll try non-fat mayo or make my own olive oil mayo to see if it affects the taste and flavor; should give the dish less fat or at least less bad fat.

I was a little hesitant at first with the ingredients and what it looked like when it was done but you can't judge a book by it's cover. This was really tasty! I had to use regular raisins and I used low fat mayo and it was still delicious. I think I will make this again on a hot summer day.

I thought it was a lovely combination of flavours, and the texture was on point as well. It is a very interesting alternative with the mango rather than the apricot. Will make again!

Very exotic tasting!  I added a bit more curry just to flavor because I couldn't taste it as much as I'd like, but overall it was yummy and different!  Served over a bed of lettuce and rice as a side dish and it's delicious!

I used Sahale's Sing Buri (Cashews with Pineapple, Peanuts, Lemongrass + Mild Chinese Chili) instead of the sultana raisins and toasted cashews and yogurt instead of mayonnaise and I have to say that this is one of the best recipes I've made using this web site.  The mango chutney and curry powder in the yogurt really adds to the flavors in this dish.

So delicious. We crushed some of the nuts for mixing in with the sauce which meant every bite got some of the nut taste.
