This sandwich is my new fav for lunch! I swapped out lite slaw dressing for my own dressing because I couldn't find it in the store, but it was still delicious.

This sandwich is so good!  I love the crunch of the slaw, and I'm getting addicted to these weight watchers cheese wedges, so much better than mayo or a plain slice of cheese!
