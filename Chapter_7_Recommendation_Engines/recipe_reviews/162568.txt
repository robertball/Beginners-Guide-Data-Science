The lemon and butter flavor is a nice compliment to the spinach.  I simply sauteed the spinach in a skillet with the butter (I used a little olive oil too) and garlic and then finished with a splash of lemon juice.

I always saute spinach but this microwave cooking method interested me for its ease of preparation. I was very disappointed in the results. The cooking time as well as the method is insufficient to cook the garlic, leaving the strong, raw taste of it. Also, microwaving did not allow the juices released from the spinach as it wilted to evaporate. It was a fun try, but I'll continue to give spinach and garlic a quick saute.

Delicious.....I omitted the butter and used olive oil instead. Loved the freshness of the lemon juice and I added a little red pepper flakes for some heat. Will make again!

We really enjoyed this spinach.  I cooked mine on the stovetop in a skillet.  I simmered the garlic in 2 Tbsp. lemon juice, 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, 2 Tbsp. olive oil, and a pinch of kosher salt and some fresh ground black pepper.  Then I added the spinach and cooked until it was just wilted.  Easy and delicious!

I took a short cut with this - used a steam in microwave bag of spinach (14 oz.) Why go to all that trouble? Did not use that much butter - I just added lemon juice, a little lite butter, minced garlic, salt and pepper to taste.

Not good :(  I was so excited because it looked so easy and I love all the ingredients.  I ended up having to put it in a frying pan and saute it for 7 minutes to make it edible.

Excellent and very easy. I would have never microwaved spinach before now. It came out pleasantly "par" wilted. I will cut the lemon in half next time as it was a little to tart for 2 out of 4. Perfect recipe if you have conflicting spinach consistency views. I like fresh and raw my husband likes cooked down and sauteed. It was a cross between both and a great middle ground.

I microwaved on high for 3 mins to get it perfectly between too under-done and too wilted.  Used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter.  I also listened to another reviewer and added some red pepper flakes.  It was great, and I will make it again.

This has to be the easiest thing I've ever made.  Only thing was I did have to nuke it for two minutes longer, but then it was wonderful!  It's a keeper!

It was reallygood. We love all kinds of greens but spinach is my favorite. Always looking for new ideas. I added some sauted' pine nuts to it. I was the only one that liked the pine nuts, the rest of my family thought it would have been better without.

To be honest I've previously avoided spinach as a side dish as I find it bland and uninspiring but this recipe changed all that. Loved the zingy flavour and the fact that the garlic is tasty rather than overpowering. My kids tried it but weren't keen but I loved it. I served it as a last minute side dish to go with a chicken and bacon lattice pie and some buttered baby Jersey Royal potatoes. The spinach kept the whole meal light and suprisingly was delicious with the pie crust. Thanks

Very good, did sautee on stovetop as suggested by others. Also used 2 tbsp of olive oil in place of the butter to make this a bit healthier. Thanks for the recipe:)

I was very unimpressed with this recipe. As some reviewers were complaining of mushy spinach when made in the microwave, I sauteed it in a skillet instead. Something about it was way off...the flavors were very harsh and didn't compliment each other well. Sorry, but I won't be making this again!

(Gave 5 stars for the taste of the ingredients used) I've been using all the same ingredients for years, BUT IMO I think that this comes out way better if you prepare it in a skillet right before you get ready to serve it! Always a great compliment w/ salmon dishes!

Husband loved it -- we nuked it for 3 minutes total in a weak microwave, so the spinach was just warm, not fully cooked. He hates the slimy pile of spinach that often results after I steam it... He really enjoyed this and told me we should make it often. I halved everything, melted the garlic/butter/lemon juice first and poured over teh top to evenly coat. Also added a few sprinkles of red pepper flakes as recommended by others. Good, simple-as-can-be, healthy side. Oh, and using I Can't Believe it's Not Butter Light, this was only 1 point (Weight Watchers).

Way too much butter in this recipe which I even cut back to three tablespoons. Decided to saute the garlic first in the butter and then add it. Really enjoyed the lemon flavor tho and thank you.

eh. just ok.  Didn't do much for me. Maybe I need to adjust the amount of ingredients. It is simple enough that I could try it again. 5 stars for me would have to be a WOW; if someone else made it I would ask for the recipe..... and this wouldn't be the one.

Nice ingredients - the lemon made it great.  I cooked in a pan, however.  I can't cook in a microwave - it just goes against my grain!

Perfect lunch. Couldn't have been easier. A nice squeeze of fresh lemon over the top and a sprinkle of salt & pepper... Lovely.

A great side dish and great way to use up spinach that needs to be eaten asap.  I don't know how healthy is really is, though.  5 T. of butter was a lot!

I used a package of frozen spinach because I didn't have fresh spinach, also did not mince the garlic but just sliced it, also I sauteed everything rather than using the microwave. The flavor is amazing, love it.

Great fresh tasting recipe!  However, next time I will use 1 TBS butter not five.  Too greasy and not so healthy with all that butter.  The flavor was great though.  Thanks!

I know I need to eat more spinach because it is so healthy and high in iron content.  This is a great combo but instead of microwaving, I sauteed the spinach in butter and garlic for five minutes and then splashed lemon juice on it.  Tasty and healthy!

Easy! I filled a pyrex pie dish with the last of a box of baby spinach - sprinkled on the lemon juice, garlic pepper spice blend (since I did not have any garlic on hand) and sprayed with olive oil cooking spray, covered and nuked for about 2.5 minutes.  Awesome! I also nuked about 5 asparagus spears and threw them on top of the spinach. By then my salmon filet was ready to come out of the Rocket Grill.  I added my favorite luxuary item (lavendar honey mustard dressing) to sauce the salmon, asparagus and spinach.  NIRVANA!! From freezer to table in well under 10 minutes. The only thing missing was a glass of wine. This will go into the regular dinner rotation!

love the idea- but way to lemony.  I used only one bad of fresh spinach but halved everything and it was sooooo lemon!  I think it would be good with 1/2 of the lemon.

wow this was so good.. i knew better than to use the microwave and just sauteed this in a pan.. i was trying to use up the 2-3 oz of spinach i had in the fridge so i scaled it down to that (about 0.75 servings).. i used one small clove of garlic, 2 tsp of margarine, and 1 tsp of bottled lemon juice.. i sprinkled some salt on the finished product.. now i'm wishing i had more spinach!  this was super simple and super tasty.. i'm sure it would work with most veggies.. ty for the recipe

The flavor was great but somehow my fresh spinach turned brown when finished cooking. I think the lemon was the cause of it.

I cut the lemon juice in half and I didnt have fresh spinach. I liked this recipe but Dh did not. I also dont think all that butter is needed. I will make this again for me but only add 2 tablespoons of butter.

I thought this spinach recipe rocked!  The only thing I did differently was cutting the butter down to 2 Tbsp. and used 1 Tbsp. dried minced garlic.  The first time I made it, it seemed too buttery. I melted the butter, added the lemon juice and garlic and let it sit for about 15 minutes until the garlic reconstituted itself.  Put the spinach in a Tupperware microwave cooker, poured the liquid on, covered it and pushed the fresh vegetable button on the microwave. Voila!  Easy and oh so good!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I did it in a pan on the stove instead of the microwave and added some summer squash as well.  It was pretty good, but a little too lemony for me.  I would cut back on the lemon next time.

I changed this recipe alot but I'm giving it 5 stars based on the basic flavor combo. I loved it. Light and easy. I sauteed the spinach with some parboiled thin sliced red potatoes. Used the lemon, butter and garlic and topped with parmesan. Awesome with Easy Garlic Broiled Chicken from this site.

This dish was excellent. Very simple and basic ingredients, but delicious. I follow the recipe as is, but made it in a pan instead of the microwave. I only used 1 Tbsp of butter and added some olive oil as well.

Easy, but most importantly, delicious! I loved the taste of lemon with the spinach. Didn't change a thing (except maybe some extra lemon juice... it's such a great flavor combo!) I love the use of the microwave for this. So simple.

It was very crunchy even though I kept remicrowaving past the 2 minutes, and the garlic was very strong also. Maybe sautéing in skillet is the best.

I searched for the microwave option of cooking spinach because I had a bag of spinach at work I was going to use for salad, but waited too long.  So I thought if I could cook it in the microwave, it wouldn't be wasted.  I didn't have lemon.  So I put a few dollops of margerine over the top and sprinkled generously with Mrs. Dash Onion & Herb blend, plus a little salt.  I microwaved it for 2 minutes and I thought it came out really good.  Didn't have plastic wrap, so cut open a Ziploc gallon bag and used that instead!

I didn't care for this way of cooking spinach. I bought a bag of mixed kale, swiss chard, and baby spinach. I realized it was only 5 oz so I cut the recipe in half. I followed the recipe, except I reduced the butter. I figured I could add more later if I needed it. After the 2 minutes, it didn't looked fully cooked and it was tart from the lemon juice. It was also very watery. So, I drained the liquid and spritzed it with olive oil, which I typically cook it in, and added a sprinkle of sea salt. Not sure why the recipe is missing salt unless one uses salted butter. I microwaved it one more minute. It tasted better, and was more cooked, but I guess I just like spinach or greens sauteed and not microwaved. The garlic, butter, or other flavorings just get more caramelized adding to the depth of the overall flavor and texture. Watery tart spinach just didn't work for me. I might be able to salvage it, fortunately, by adding it to another recipe.

Made this tonight for the father-in-law.  Used 2 bags of fresh spinach, but only 1 1/2 tbsp. butter.  Five I believe is way too much.  With the added lemon and garlic, you just don't need it... nor all the calories.  It was delicious.  My father-in-law had double helpings.  I would've, but boy does that spinach wilt like crazy.  Fresh, delicious, good for you and my husband's heart.  Next time, I will try with our Vegan, Earth Balance, Butter substitute.  We soooo loved this dish.  The lemon was perfect.

Good basic recipe.  I didn't measure any of the ingredients but otherwise made as stated.

Excellent.  I would reduce the lemon slightly next time, but it was still excellent.

I was skeptical at first, but I really love this!  It's so so easy to make, and delicious too!  I love the lemon/butter combination.  I will definitely make it again.

I really liked this spinach! I served it with the broiled tilapia parmesan from this site and it was an awesome meal :)

The only thing wrong with this recipe was that I didn't make enough.

I tried this recipe when i wanted something new to do with spinach. In general, pretty good. But i did tweak it a bit. I put in half as much butter and i think it could do with less lemon, too - maybe 3 TBS instead of four. Instead of microwaving it i sauteed it, using 1/2 steamed spinach and 1/2 fresh spinach. I let the spinach absorb the butter and onion and served it with a small side of rice. Excellent.

Made this for dinner.  I used a container of Organic Baby Spinach and totally forgot the garlic on accident.. but it was still a big hit with all but one of my kids and my husband and I loved it.

I buy my spinach at Costco, and often have a hard time using it all up, this was a simple, fantastic recipe! I followed the advice of another reviewer and sauteed this in a frying pan. I will definitely make this again and again!! No spinach will go to waste again!

I try not to add too much salt so I'm constantly using lemons and limes to season my food, but I had never thought to use it on spinach.  It was actually quite tastey.  I don't care to cook in the microwave, so I cooked mine over the stove.  I melted the butter and mixed it with fresh lemon juice and a tsp. of garlic powder, used it to coat the spinach and cooked it to my desired tenderness. Delish! Light tasting and not at all greasy.

I like fresh spinach, but not cooked--it's too salty. This was great, though--savory and a little sweet. I've found a way to cook spinach!

Nice spinach recipe.  Adds the right amount of zing to the meal.
