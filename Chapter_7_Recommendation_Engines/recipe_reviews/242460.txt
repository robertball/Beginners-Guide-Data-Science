This is a great base recipe. I've made it 3 times, adding dried cranberries and chopped walnuts each time, substituting applesauce for the oil, and only using 1/4 cup brown sugar for both sugars. (The second time I bought steel cut oats by mistake -- would NOT recommend that.) The 3rd time I mistakenly dumped a container of applesauce in before realizing I forgot the eggs, and it still turned out great! We've finished a pan in a matter of days, and my eaters are all 4 and under.

I made this for my granddaughter, and she is the one who has rated this.  She loves the taste of it when it's new from the oven, but after it sits she thinks it could've used a little more sugar.  When it went into her lunch, she said that it was so very crumbly that it was hard to eat.  She was also surprised that it had applesauce in it because she didn't taste that at all.  She was hoping I could come up with a way to make it stick together more.  Any suggestions would be helpful!  Thanks, Margaret N!

This oatmeal is quick, easy, and feeds my large family which is great. The kiddos and hubby love it. I only make a few minor changes: I use all applesauce in place of the butter, leave out the white sugar, and add in fruit, nuts, and seeds. To speed up breakfast I often bake it before bed and then warm it in the microwave in the morning. It reheats great.

I made this for my son, he's a fussy eater.  He really liked it and so did we.  It was almost like a cake, nice and moist without being overly sweet.  Really simple and delicious.  I liked it straight from the oven and we have been eating it cold from the fridge in little squares.   I made it exactly as listed and would make it the same again, and would try variations with nuts or dried fruit thrown in.  A keeper.

This is the best baked oatmeal I have made.  I just used regular applesauce since I did not have any chunky.  I did decrease the butter to 1/4 cup and just did scant measuring for the sugars.  This will be my new baked oatmeal recipe.  It's great the way it is and the possibilities for additions are endless.  Thank you MARGARET N for sharing your recipe.

A half recipe of this fits nicely into a 12 cup muffin pan.

I wish it had less sugar, but it's good and portable.

Very good recipe. Made as written except splenda for white sugar and a little more milk. Flavor was good. Added pecans throughout and did half choc chips and half craisins. Both varieties were good. Overall it was a dry when eaten plain, would use a more applesauce/milk next time. Cooked 25 min.

It made a huge batch, but unfortunately it wasn't something we cared for. It tasted too much like bland health food with not too much flavor. I added extra applesauce and raisins too..but still we didn't care for it.

Meh.  I guess I was envisioning something like a crisp, which this definitely is not.  I made half with raisins and half plain.  The flavor was okay, but I didn't like the consistency, and ended up eating it with milk.  I don't see the value in taking the time to bake it (and adding unhealthy ingredients like eggs, sugar, and butter) over just cooking it on the stove and adding some milk and honey.  I think I will try it again with strawberries and some almonds (to give it a crunch, because it was too soft for my taste).  My son liked it, though.

I halved this recipe because it is just 2 of us.  It was perfect!  It did come out like cake, I was able to cut it into cake pieces and the texture was really good.  I did have to bake it a bit longer to get it golden brown, but that could just be the differences in ovens.  Thanks!

I cook for a small summer camp and we are looking for healthy and interesting options for our menu. I never had baked oatmeal before and wanted to try it first for my family before making it for others- liked the idea that this would be more like a bar or cake than sloppy/gummy oatmeal. Good texture and flavor, though I would have liked it to be a bit more bar/cake like- took longer than stated to cook, but that could be pan size. Will definitely try this at work for a 4H group this week!
***Update- this has become one of our favorite go-to recipes for camp breakfasts! I love the added protein of the milk (sometimes even sub yogurt) and the applesauce in place of oils/fats. I make it in full sheet pans and the texture is great- holds together well- still best eaten with a fork, but can be picked up by hand as well.
