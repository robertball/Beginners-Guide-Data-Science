This was terrific!  I have never really cooked root vegetables before and didn't know what to expect.  Even my incredibly picky husband liked it.  (Not so much the 4 yr old but what does he know?)

Vegetable broth and goat cheese was not on hand, so I substituted for it with a few splashes of white wine and shredded parmesean/romano cheeses and it was still fabulous.

Awesome, Slightly Modified

I used carrots, turnips, and quartered onions, tossed in olive oil and Montreal Steak Seasoning, roasted for 1/2hour (covered).  Sprinkled with Newman's Balsamic Dressing, roasted (uncovered) for 10 mins.  Awesomeness.  Can't wait to try this with other root veggies.

Dish was fantastic!  Smelled great in oven and didn't disappoint.  Served with grilled butterfly pork chops--I'd recommend rosemary and olive oil.  Never cooked with rutabaga before, but will look for more winter root veggie recipes after this.

This made a delicious dish of roasted vegetables.  Pay close attention to the size of the cut up vegetables as they are best if all are thoroughly roasted to yeild a soft interior.  I like the addition of chicken brroth at the end.

Had to modify it a bit.  I didnt have any vegetable broth, or basalmic vinegar, so I used a splash of white vinegar in before I put them in the oven. This dish was yummy!  Even my kids enjoyed it.  I added onions, more potatoes, and of course the italian seasoning.  I didnt salt until after the dish done.  It came out wonderful.  Now.. If I could just stop eating it...

This was a great recipe! I skipped the goat cheese because we didnâ€™t have any, but it was great without it. My husband really enjoyed it and will definitely add it to our rotation.

I will make this all the time from here on out.  I had to swap out some veggies for others, but they worked.  In the end, my friend who had sworn to hate beets was loving it up!

Perfect and easy.  I chopped the vegetables a little too small, so they were on the soft side.  Next time I will use slightly bigger chunks.

It was good before we put the goat cheese, broth, and balsamic on it.  I had reserved a portion for my daughter, who I didn't think would like the goat cheese, before adding the last ingredients.  My husband and I ended up sharing that with her!

I used root vegetables from my weekly CSA bag: carrots, turnips and sweet potatoes.  It turned out great, even cut the bitterness of the turnips.  I didn't use goat cheese, but I am sure it would make a wonderful addition to the taste.

This was really exceptional.  I really didn't make any changes.  Use good quality produce.  Cook this in the cold months from roots that were sourced locally.  Get some good balsalmic that has been aged 12+ years and you'll be happy that you did.

Made this for the first time tonight. It's fantastic! The balsamic at the end finishes it off beautifully. I'll be making this again!

Excellent. Used Greek dressing instead of vinegar and Italian spices since I had just a little left in the fridge.

Yum! Didn't even bother with the broth. Pulled them out of the oven and sprinkled with Balsamic Vinegar and Italian Seasoning, mixed it up a bit, scooped into my bowl and decorated with Feta Cheese. Heaven!

This was great. I wasn't sure how I felt about turnips, and I'd probably leave them out next time. I did not have a rutabaga, and I used carrots instead of parsnips and sweet potatoes instead of new potatoes.

I made this using carrots,turnip,onion and parsnip..it was delish..I did not use the goats cheese this time but will try again in future and try it with the goats cheese. I omitted the beets and did them separately (see beets n sweets recipe also on this website..the beets alone were fantastic!)
