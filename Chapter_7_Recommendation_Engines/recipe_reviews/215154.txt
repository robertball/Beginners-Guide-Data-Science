So juicy & yummy!  Definately a keeper!   Some members of my family have sodium restricted diets so I did not use any Teriyaki marinade nor salt, but I did add 1/4 c. soy sauce.  I also let the chicken drumsticks marinade for closer to 3 hours and everyone couldn't get enough!  Full stars!

This was really good! I used less pepper, paprika, and salt (about a tablespoon of each) and NO cayenne pepper.  I also used chicken breast. But was delicious!  Will defiantly make again!

Pretty easy recipe.. I gave it four stars because I omitted all the salt and had to bake since we couldn't get the grill to start.  The chicken was very moist and the marinade was pretty tasty but didn't penetrate the chicken like I thought it would. Would try again when it can be grilled.

This was so yummy! I cut my chicken into cubes and let it marinate for about an hour then I put them on skewers with onions and green, red, and yellow peppers. My whole family loved it and I can't wait to make it again!

I prepared a half portion of this recipe, following suggestion of other reviewers to reduce amounts of salt, paprika and pepper - just a dash of cayenne. Marinated for about 6 hours, grilled as directed and it was delicious!!  Didnt give this 5 stars because of reducing some ingredient amounts, but will definitely make this again.  Thanks.

I reduced the salt, per the other reviews, but still it was too salty.  I probably would eliminate the salt altogether if I use it again.

I did use this marinade for chicken BREASTS on the grill, with a few tweaks.

I used a little more than 1/8C brown sugar Splenda blend, NO salt, about 1/8C paprika, full black pepper, NO cayenne, 1/2C Yoshida's teriyaki sauce, 1/2C low sodium soy sauce, full vegetable oil, and threw in a couple Tbsp of toasted sesame seeds just for kicks.

I let the chicken marinate for about 5hrs, and it was yummy! Flavorful but not overpoweringly so and definitely not super salty.

Nice flavor but way too much salt. I cut the salt in half and used low sodium teriyaki and it was still crazy salty. Don't be tempted to use this recipe on breasts! It is meant for a skin on, dark meat. I would probably use boneless thighs next time and cut the salt to a tsp or two. Would be a five star recipe except for the salt, it's very easy to prepare and has a nice flavor.

It was very delicious and it had a very wonderful taste. 100 percent would use this recipe again. I did marinade it for longer than said which I think made it even more flavorful.

This is fantastic! I fixed just like the chef suggested (added a bit more fresh garlic though!) Had this set out for our 4th of July Independence Day party and wow! Not a single drumstick left!

It was delicious and my wife enjoyed it so much that she didn't hear me when  I was asking her how it tasted.  Will be doing this one again. The only difference was I added a sauce after it was done, but still turned out great.

Made this for a family get together and everyone loved them! I used Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy for the beer. A great recipe, good for the grill!

I used 3 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  I cut the salt down to 1 tablespoon and the paprika down to 1 tablespoon.  It was plenty spicy.  I did not oil the chicken.  I only marinated it for 1 hour.  I then cooked the chicken in the marinade in the oven at 350 for 20-25 minutes.  Excellent!  Everyone enjoyed it.
