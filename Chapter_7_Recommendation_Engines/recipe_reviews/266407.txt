After reading the five reviews this recipe already had I decided to follow France C.'s advice and marinade the chicken in hopes of attaining flavorful moist chicken. I mixed the the stock, salt, garlic, lemon, capers and olive oil in a zip top bag and added the chicken. I used Tyson's frozen thawed boneless skinless chicken breast since that's what I had on hand. I let it marinade for about 3 hours. I then removed the chicken from the marinade and browned in a cast iron skillet. Added the marinade and peppers to the same pan. Since the reviews commented on over baked chicken, I set my oven to 350 degrees knowing that my cast iron pan was hot and holds heat well during baking. I baked for 20 minutes before checking. It was well done and dry. I wish I would have checked it at 15 minutes. I am not sure why the recipe states 40 - 45 minutes cook time as that is way too long for this recipe. The chicken was full of flavor.

8.7.18  If I make this again, I’ll start checking the chicken temperature at 30 minutes, as it was overcooked at 40 minutes.  It was OK, but didn’t have as much flavor as I anticipated.  With the lemon juice and capers, I was thinking the first thing that would hit me would be a resemblance to chicken piccata, but that flavor just really didn’t kick in.   Served with rice, steamed carrots, tossed salad, and hot baguette.  Not bad, had nice presentation, but simply not as good as I would have liked.

Definitely check the chicken well before the 40-45 minutes called for in the recipe, or else you'll end up with dry chicken.  I used 5.5 - 6 oz breasts and mine were already done at at 22 minutes, so check before then! Use a thermometer to ensure doneness.  The chicken could use a bit more flavor, so if I make this again I will marinate the chicken in the lemon/stock/garlic/caper mixture first, then pat the chicken off and sear in a pan before placing it into the baking dish with the liquid mixture. An otherwise healthy and colorful dish. I served this over a rice/quinoa mixture and it was wonderful drizzled with the liquid.

My family loves this flavor combination (it reminds of us chicken piccata), so this gets 5 Stars from us! Per the other reviews, I reduced the baking time. Just shy of 30 minutes was great for us since our chicken breasts were thick. I definitely recommend checking on the chicken starting around 22-25 minutes.

Easy weeknight dinner, but the recipe could be tweaked. First, the chicken would be so dry if you cooked it for 40 minutes! Mine was done in a little under 20, but the veggies could have used more time. I think I would make the whole thing on the stove top next time. Sear the chicken and remove it. Add all the veggies and caramelize and then add the stock and the chicken back to the pan to finish cooking. It's a great combination of flavors, but I'd totally change the method next time. I did make a pan sauce while the chicken finished cooking (because I cannot waste those delicious brown bits in the pan). I just deglazed the pan with a little white wine and then added some chicken stock and reduced it! It was nice and helped finish the dish.

We loved this recipe! Wonderfully light and zesty in flavor. I doubled the bell peppers, and it could have actually used more veggies - but we like lots. Loved the touch of capers in this.

This was a tasty chicken meal. I added garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and poultry seasoning. I started checking the chicken at 15 minutes because I cut the chicken breasts in half. My family enjoyed the meal and I would make it again. Next time, I will marinate the chicken.

Being that the first step said “brown chicken then place aside”, I decided to make it in my cast iron skillet. I browned the chicken as instructed then removed the chicken added the rest of the ingredients and baked it. My chicken was thin so it cooked in 25 minutes. I thought it would taste like a baked chicken piccata but sadly it did not. The peppers were out of place in this dish and my family pushed theirs aside (which ended up in the trash:(  despite how easy this came together I doubt I will make this again. Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe has some of my favorites-lemon, peppers, and capers. The chicken and peppers delivered with a zesty, lemony taste.

I made this recipe as is. It was a hit with everyone from my granddaughter who is almost 2, her parents, and my husband & me.  The flavors infuse the chicken nicely without being overpowering and the meat did not dry out. I will definitely make this again. This does take some time so it is not for a night when you are in a hurry.
