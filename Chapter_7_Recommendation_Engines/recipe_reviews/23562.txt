This was such a delicious and flavorful meal. My husband and daughter ate it up. At first I was skeptical about making it with beer on low heat but decided to give it a try. After reading all the good and bad reviews on here I did switch some things up. Instead of using steak seasoning I used Garlic Salt, Garlic Powder, Black Pepper, and Santa Maria Seasoning (I'm not sure if every store has it. But it's easy to find in California). I put a bit of EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil) in the pan and browned the chops. I used 2/3 cup of Heineken Beer (I read someone else used it as well so I thought I'd give it a try. But my husband is a Bud Light drinker so next time I'm going to try that.), 2/3 cup of Hickory Smoked BBQ, about 1/4 cup of A1 Steak Sauce, about 2 to 3 dashes of Worcestershire's Sauce, and about 1/2 cup of brown sugar (I actually just used two handfuls, I don't really measure I eyeball a lot). I cut up some Vidalia onions and put it on top of the chops in the sauce and I just simmered on Low Heat for 2 hours. It came out perfect! Meat came right off the bones. I served it with white rice. It went great together! By the way I only cooked with 4 chops so that's why I had to reduce the quantity of ingredients.

Heineken, Montreal Steak seasoning, 'Sweet Baby Ray's' Honey BBQ Sauce and Vidalia onions - How can you go wrong here? After simmering for 2 hours the bone fell off the tender sweet meat. Easy to make & clean up after, and tastes so good. I've made this 5 times, my mom asked me for the recipe after she tried it!

It is VERY rare that I rate a recipe this low and I'm sorry to break my good review streak but this turned out horrible for us. First of all - 2 TBLS of steak seasoning?!? Yikes - I reduced it down to a 1.5 TBLS and was still too much (but I didn't find that out until I took a bite). Second - we found the combination of beer & BBQ sauce weird (I used KC Masterpeice). Third - it smelled funny the entire time it cooked (minor complaint compared to the poor taste). Of the six chops - we barely finished 4 of them (one for each of us to choke down) and we threw the remaining two away. My daughter tried to dip them in ketchup of all things to try to make them taste better to no avail. I wouldn't say NOT to try this - it just didn't work for us...at all. Good luck and happy cooking!

This recipe is great, but I recommend using bone-in chops.  This is very similar to a pulled pork recipe that I used to make for a restaurant.  Boneless chops tend to be very dry, even after simmering for a couple of hours.  I was very generous with the rub (spices), and I used Montreal Steak Seasoning, garlic powder, a bit of paprika and a rosemary herb seasoning from pampered chef.  I believe that it is very important to use good beer in this recipe.  I used Guiness and it was fine, but any darker beer should be good.  I also used a bit of apple cider vinegar, brown sugar, worsteshire and one white onion.  I only used between 8 & 10 oz of beer and the sauce was epic.  Knock your socks off good.  You can simmer this recipe for 6 hours and it wont be too long, as long as the heat is extremely low.

This was a huge hit.  Easy as can be.  For all you folks worried about giving your kids beer, don't be.  :)  Just like cooking with wine, the alcohol burns off and leaves a terrific flavor.  I used pork chops with the bone, which is much more flavorful and tender than boneless.  Like others, I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce and vidalia onions.  Make sure you cook as long as directed, at the lowest flame - it should barely simmer, else it will dry out - the longer you cook it, the more tender it will be!  Just keep fork-testing it.  The family LOVED this!  Thanks for a great addition!

I have made this recipe two nights in a row because my husband can't get enough! I didn't have any BBQ sauce so I took the advice of another reviewer and made my own with ketchup, worcestshire sauce, brown sugar, dijon mustard and a dab of hot sauce. Also added a clove of minced garlic, and a handful of chopped celery and carrots. I used a can of Canadian beer, and a sprinkle of thyme. WOW! I uncovered it the last 20 minutes of cooking so the sauce would thicken. Excellent!

This recipe was loved by the whole family. I did salt/pepper, then sauteed the meat in garlic oil before adding to the crockpot. I also added worchestershire sauce and red pepper flake. When it came to serve, I added cornstarch dissolved in cold water to thicken it. Works both on rice and on 
hamburger buns. Easy recipe.

It was so nice to have some different way to prepare pork chops. I really enjoyed how tender they turned out and the unique flavor of the onions!

This was a great recipe, which really surprised me. I used Sam Adams Boston Lager (it's what was in the fridge) and KC Masterpiece barbecue (again, what was in the Fridge). I was out of A1 so I used worcestershire sauce. I like it because it can sit on the stove top while you do other things -- and it only uses one pot.

My 6-year old son wouldn't touch pork chops until we made this one night.  It's very easy, and we love that it takes one pot.

"steak seasoning" leaves a lot open personal interpretation. To me its worcestershire sauce and 2 tbs wasn't over doing it at all. Admittedly I did sprinkle them with Montreal Steak before browning. Threw in 1 tbs mustard, 3 tbs brown sugar, 2 tbs honey (since my bbq sauce seemed a little lacking in the flavor department) and replaced the beer with root beer. I used one vidalia and one red onion. All this went into the crock pot on low for 8 hours. As it turned out 6 chops were not enough for 5. My 5 and 8 year old boys ate 2 each asking if I could make it every night. Next time I will use a pork tenderloin and thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch before serving. The sauce was so good its still in the fridge to be served of rice later in the week for leftover and we were all eyeing the bread wanting to grab it to soak up the AMAZING gravy. This would also be great served on buns as pulled pork. YUM-O!!!!

Really good.  Followed recipe to the letter with one exception.  Two tablespoons of steak seasoning seemed like a lot so I seasoned each chop before browning them.  This worked well and wasn't overpowering.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, Montreal Steak Seasoning,  and an Amber Ale for the beer. If you are looking for a different way to prepare pork chops, this is a great recipe for you.

This was amazing!  I will be putting this into rotation.  Even the leftovers were amazing.  We don't drink beer so I used apple juice and it worked out beautifully.  I cant wait to try different BBQ sauces.  The only thing I did different was use bone in chops... the fell apart, I think boneless might get dry. Otherwise, 5 ingredients!

Fantastic!! only adjusted slightly. I browned bone-in pork chops in my frying pan, moved to slow cooker.  Poured 1/2 bottle of beer in pan to get all the flavor into the crock pot.  Poured that in  with all the other ingredients to my slow cooker, put it on low for 5 hours - my husband loved it and asked that I make it for his parents when they visit.  Thanks!!!

Jjst perfect for the two of us. I chose to use a little less BBQ sauce since we are both beer flavor fans. Worked great on a busy work night and flavor was excellent. I chose to mix in BBQ sauce and beer in amedium sized bowl, then added the salt and pepper. Threw the chops in the bowl for about ten minutes or so then added the entire contents of the bowl to the skillet turned out fantastic! Served it along fresh steamed broccoli and potatoes.

Easy, good flavor, and the chops turned out really tender. I used Budweiser & Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ.  If you don't have beer on hand, root beer is another great option.

Simple, delicious weeknight comfort food.  How easy was this?  I browned my bonelss porkchops seasoned with Lawry's Seasoned Salt and cracked black pepper in a little EVOO, added a can of Bud, and a hodge-podge of BBQ sauces that needed to be used up.  Sliced onions on top, and an hour and a half later on low, dinner!  Pork was fork tender.  Loved this easy-peasy recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Recipe needs to be a lot more specific! The taste depends a lot on the beer, bbq sauce and onions you use. Used Sweet Daddy Ray's, Fosters beer and vidalia onions. Yuck! It had a weird nasty taste. The pork chops DID come out moist though. So tried the recipe again using my own bbq sauce (really easy to make and lots of good recipes on allrecipes for it) and substituting vegetable broth for the beer. Pork chops came out AMAZING. Very moist and flavorful. 6 stars for the cooking technique, 3 for the actual recipe.

Fantastic recipe I got all 10' from everyone in my home! The only thing I did different was used salt, pepper, and garlic powder instead of steak seasoning. And I had to transfer the chops to a broiler pan once browned and cooked covered on 350 in the oven for about an hour. I made too many to fit them all back in the pan once they were browned :)

I want to like this....but just can't.  I tried it twice -- once on the stovetop and once in the oven.  The oven was better, but I guess just not for us.  Glad I tried it.....

This was very good. my 2 year old ate them but my 6 year old had a hard time eating them. she is not much of a meat eater though. 

I did not have a full bottle of BBQ so i added some 57 sauce, garlic, brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce. i used 12 bonless pork loin chops trimmed of fat because i have a lot of mouths to feed plus my husband likes to take dinner for lunch the next day. I will be making this again! oh and I read where people said the sauce was to thin. mine was also but right at the end i mixed a little flour with some water ( so its not lumpy) and added it to thicken the sauce. I served this with greenbeans and rice with green peppers and onions. VERY GOOD THANKS!

These were probably the most tender pork chops I have ever made.  The flavor is wondeful and it is SO easy.  The only thing I would change is maybe use a little less beer next time because the sauce was pretty runny.

These pork chops are wonderful!  They basically melt in your mouth! I don't like beer, but since the pork chops are cooked in it, you can't taste it.

First off, this recipe greatly depends on your choice of BBQ sauce. I used Montreal steak seasoning ( just sprinkled generously on each side) , bottle of bud light and sweet baby rays honey chipotle. If you are unsure, mix some beer and BBQ first and see if you want to add your pork chops to that sauce. If not, at least you already have some browned pork chops ready and some opened beer:) my combo worked nicely!

"My kids favorite" and "beer" threw me off at first (my kid is 7) but I made it for adults and it was great.  My kid or any other kid I know wouldn't go near it. Beer, bbq sauce, onions..no way for a very young palette.  But older "kids", like teens and us grown-ups will like it, IMHO. Strong taste and yummy.

These were really dry. Recipe should state the thickness of the chops as this would definately affect the cooking time. I like to stick to original recipes the first go round. Good thing I have lots of BBQ sauce. I will try again - next time less steak seasoning (or just using garlic powder, salt and pepper) and will halve the cooking time.

I don't know why this didn't leap out at me as:Pulled Pork!  I left the lid off so the juices would thicken and the meat didn't fall apart.  That worked out well.  I also added matchstick carrots the last hour.  Those were okay.  Actually, the whole meal was 'okay.'

UPDATE: I'VE BEEN ON A MISSION TO RE-TRY RECIPES I DIDN'T LIKE THE FIRST TIME AROUND (THIS WAS ONE OF THEM). THIS TIME I CHANGED THINGS UP A BIT. I SIMMERED ON THE LOWEST HEAT SETTING POSSIBLE, SUBBED BONE-IN CHOPS AND USED GUINESS STOUT / SWEET BABY RAY'S HONEY BBQ SAUCE. HUGE DIFFERENCE!!! THE KEY IS TO SIMMER LOW AND SLOW. THANKS! Meh. Both my hubs and I didn't care for these at all (which is too bad because prep is SUPER easy). I worked from home today. Chicago was hit with a TON of snow over the past 24 hours. Rather than doubling my already long commute, I stayed in (thanks boss!). During my lunch hour, I prepped everything and then around 4, I threw my chops on the stovetop to simmer. I used Bud American Ale, Sweet Baby Ray's hickory brown sugar BBQ sauce (my favorite!), Montreal steak seasoning and a plain 'ol yellow onion (but I bet a Vidalia / sweet onion would have been better...). My issue with this recipe is two-fold. For starters, my sauce was B-I-T-T-E-R tasting!!! I can see how using a good quality, dark beer might make this better. Lastly, I just didn't care for the texture of these. A couple hours of slow simmering was enough to significantly alter the texture in a way that didn't suit me (these tasted like slow cooked chops - which I have NEVER liked). Served with mashed potatoes (to sop up the sauce), coleslaw and cornbread, this was an "OK" meal. I don't have kiddos, but I can definitely say these weren't my "favorite." Thanks anyways, KissingCook! :-)

My husband and I Love this recipe!!! Definitely one of our favorite meals!!! Recipe is perfect. I used to cook on stove top, but once our baby arrived I started slow cooking a lot more meals, and this recipe didn't need changed a bit. Turns out great in the slow cooker!!!

Delicious! My husband actually asked for this again next week! A tip for anyone wanting to make this: Be sure to use quality ingredients! Cheap beer and bbq sauce will yield a bad sauce. Use good beer that you want to drink and your favorite bbq sauce, and you can't go wrong! I used Sweet Baby Ray's and Sam Adam's Octoberfest.

This is a pretty basic and general know-how recipe, which offers great results.  I didn't have beer on hand so I replaced it with chicken broth, and then placed all items into my crockpot and cooked on low for 5 hours.  Meat was tender and sauce was rich!  Served over basmati rice... good!

This recipe sounded good and quick, I sampled as it simmered and was not caring for the taste. I got my walking garbage cans to taste it and they rated it meh, so-so. I added 3/4c sun dried tomato salad dressing and got a thumbs up. Pork was very tender and I served over rice. I will make again with the dressing addition.

This was pretty good, I used bud light because that was all we had on hand. Added a bit of Worcestershire sauce based on previous reviews and made my Montreal Steak Seasoning from scratch since I don't have any on hand from a recipe on chow.com The pork chops were not as tender as I would like, but I think it was the cut and not the recipe.  Next time I will try thick bone-in chops.

Easy to make so that gives it an extra plus.  This didn't totally knock my socks off, but it was good.  Grumpy liked it better than I did...so it gets 4 stars.

Well we don't drink beer in this house, and I know I've cooked pork ribs with Coke so I tried it with this recipe, and it worked marvelously.  I did however forget the steak seasoning, but due to the fact that many reviewers didn't really care for it, I don't think we missed much.  I put 6 FROZEN pork chops in my slow cooker with the coke and 1 1/2 bottles of divine BBQ sauce... for 6 hrs.  and they were tender and fell off the bone.  Served with Salad and homemade refrigerator whole wheat rolls off this site.  Thank you for this great recipe!

I love this EASY recipe!  I've made it 5 or 6 times in the last few months and everyone loves it too.  It's very forgiving if you don't have all the bbq sauce and very easy to cut down if you are only cooking for 2.  I decided to rate this recipe today because I threw in a couple pieces of boneless chicken to feed some last minute guests and it was great.

I used a brown sugar BBQ sauce and Miller Light. Also used a herb and garlic seasoning to make a crust before I seared it. Simmered for about 60 minutes. Served with sauce on the side to dip.

This was a quick and easy recipe that the whole family (kids included) really liked.  I used boneless porkchops that were pretty good but I think I'll use bone-in chops next time because they might be more tender.  I didn't cook it for the whole 2 hours (1 hr and 15 min) because I didn't want the pork chops to get overcooked but maybe if I had they would have been more tender?

These pork chops were outstanding!!!!  My husband said it was better than any pork chop he's had in a restaurant.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce, Columbus Pale Ale beer, and Montreal steak seasoning which gave it a little kick.  My 3 year old daughter even asked for seconds.  Next time I may try a darker beer to see if there's any difference.  This was absolutely delicious!!!

This is a great recipe.  I had done one sub though.  I did not have any steak seasoning but steak rub which is what I used.  The smell was fanastic while it cooked and the meat was tender.   Will do again.

I was so excited about this recipes and the reviews but while we like the sauce, the meat was not so great.  It was tender but dry - I used thick bone in chops and they shriveled up.  We may try again and reduce the simmer time or maybe the crock pot would be better..

Came across this recipe when I googled several ingredients in my house (it was a cold day - didn't want to go to store). I am very grateful I did. This recipe is wonderful. Very flavorful. Meat falls right off the bone. It has become a common recipe in my house.

This recepie was awesome. I was skeptical about the beer at first, but the flavour was wonderful. I made my own seasoning salt out of garlic, salt, cumin, pepper, and some dried chillies, and just sprinkled it on.

I was looking for a recipe that I could just use stuff that I already had in the fridge, and this was it! I made my own steak seasoning (lemon-pepper seasoning, garlic powder, salt, pepper, garlic pieces, and dashes of paprika, chili powder, and old bay).  I used Famous Dave's bbq sauce, and Budweiser.  I didn't have 2 hours, so I cooked the chops at a medium heat for about 40 minutes, and while it was delicious and tender, I will definitely try it again for the full cooking time when I have the time (and a less hungry boyfriend) to cook it!

My family loooved this! Its so easy! I did do it differently tho.. I placed mine in a baking pan and put it in the oven on 350 instead of a skillet. sooo simple. And it didnt take as long. I also didnt use as much steak seasoning but I usually dont measure but how if it looks like enough, then I stop!

This was a hit at my house! The pork chops came out nice and tender. I used ingredients that I had on hand including red onions, Bud Light and Sweet Baby Ray's Raspberry Chipotle Barbecue Sauce. The barbecue sauce turned out to be perfect for this meal since pork always blends well with fruit flavors and the hint of chipotle gave it a tiny bit of a kick that made my family happy! I can imagine that using a diiferent barbecue sauce would completely change the flavor in this. I will definitely be making this again.

sooooooo good!  I used Grill Mates steak rub, mixed rub, beer sauce and onions together, placed the pork chops in my Pampered Chef coverd stone roaster, poured the mixture over top, and baked for an hour.  They were like butter!

These were delicious. I used a whole can of beer because I did not want to waste any. I only used one onion, 1/2 cup of bbq and simmered it for 30 minutes. I added a tbsp of cornstarch mixed with a tbps of water at the end just to thicken the sauce up a bit. 
My husband could not stop talking about how good it smelt and how tender the meat was.

Not so great appearance, but the taste makes up for it! I used half a bottle of Michelob Ultra, a bottle of Kraft Reduced Calorie bbq sauce, and one onion.

I am sorry, I thought this was very dry.  The sauce was good but the chops were dry.  There is something about me and pork, I can never get it to come out moist.

I ended up using thin cut boneless chops for this recipe, and it still turned out great. I didn't have steak seasoning, so I used just plain old salt and pepper. I made two different versions-- both with Heineken but one with Famous Dave's Rich and Sassy BBQ sauce and one with Famous Dave's Apricot Bourbon BBQ sauce. My husband loved the ones made with with the apricot sauce best. This will definitely be in our dinner rotation from now on.

I was so excited about this meal thinking the chops were going to be sooooo moist...but no, they were dry :(  I followed the recipe exactly but the pork wasn't moist at all!  The sauce was very good, I thought, and went well with white rice, but the dinner wasn't what I wanted it to be.  I used boneless pork loin chops...maybe that's why...

This recipe didn't do much for me.  The sauce was very thin, I think I'd let it simmer covered for an hour then uncover for another hour to let some liquid evaporate.  But I'm not sure that I'll try this recipe again.  I liked that it was so easy, but the flavor just tasted like BBQ sauce on pork chops.  Sorry...

My husband and I love this recipe!  I have made it 2 times in the last month and am planning it for dinner tonight!  It's so easy!   I used bone-in center cut pork chops and deglazed the pan with a bottle of Coors Light beer. My BBQ sauce of choice is Sweet Baby Ray's.   So yummy served with buttered noodles. Thanks for a great recipe...this is a keeper!

Great recipe!  Easy to make.  I expidited the cooking process by simmering just below medium temperature on the stove.  I didn't have a skillet cover (lost in one of the many moves) so I used tin-foil.  Works great!  Prep time took less than five minutes.  Quick.  Easy.  Tastes great!!

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would.  My family loved it.  I even emailed this recipe to everyone I know that likes to cook and the ones who tried were very impressed.  I loved it so much I decided to run with the sauce and the next week I simmered the beer, BBQ sauce and onions for 1/2 hour, then I added 2 cut up peppers and shredded chicken and let that simmer for 20 minutes then I added 8 oz of mushrooms and let that simmer for 10 more minutes and then served it over brown rice.  My family loved it.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

I followed the recipe exact except I had to make my own BBQ sauce because I didn't have any.  I made it using ketchup, worch. sauce, garlic, salt, pepper, steak sauce, and hot sauce.  Anyways, the recipe is great and my bone-in chops were done in 1 hr. 20 min. They were very moist.  I think the star of this dish is the onions actually.  They are beautiful at the end of cooking and add an important flavor to the chops so don't omit them!

This was wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly. I used Miller Lite beer and KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce. Used bone-in chops. Incredibly tender and juicy - the bone just fell off!! My 1 & 2 year olds loved it (which doesn't happen often). I'll be making this again soon!

Loved this recipe!  I absolutely stink at making pork chops and my family loves them.  This is the first time I made them where they would actually eat them!  I used McCormicks California Garlic Pepper seasoning on the outside and browned the pork chops first.  I used a plain bbq sauce and a red beer with a tablespoon of garlic powder added.  I then covered the pork chops and onions with the sauce in a baking dish, covered it with foil and slowed cooked it in the oven.  It turned out delicious and was very easy,thanks!

Easy and delicious! I used two very thick bone-in chops, a good dark beer (Harp), and Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ Sauce. Because I only had two chops, I cut down on the BBQ sauce but still used a whole bottle of beer and let it reduce before simmering. Also, instead of steak seasoning I just used a bit of salt, pepper, paprika, and thyme leaves. I added a bay leaf and some chopped garlic to the braising liquid. The results were tasty and juicy. I also spooned some of the yummy braising sauce over homemade mashed potatoes, yum.

I tried this recipe!  It was my first time making pork chops (not a big fan of pork) and it turned out great!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used 4 lbs of pork chops and no steak seasoning.  I used garlic salt and pepper whilst frying it.  The BBQ sauce was a bit too much, but it went VERY well with the onions and the garlic salt & pepper that I fried them first with.  Thanks for this recipe!  It made me start liking pork!

The only pork chops I have ever liked.  So juicy and tender and tasty!!  My husband likes pork chops and I keep trying different ways to make them because I just cannot tolerate their texture for some reason.  After all these years I was astounded to finally find one I liked.  Made just as written.  Will definately use this recipe again.

I was cooking for two and decided to make this BBQ Beer Pork Braise.

I bought 2 thick cut pork chops, .8 pounds each, bone in. Because of the long cooking time with the braise I decided a thicker cut of meat was appropriate. Also with long cooking times the bones can provide flavor the same way they do with stock.

I used honey wheat beer, which is the beer I always use when making beer marinades and other cooking applications. I think one of the reason why many give bad reviews is that they're using a beer not suited for cooking with. Try cooking with a stronger flavored specialty beer, you'll get more out of it. If you just use the light less strong tasting drinking beer you normally buy you won't get as much flavor.

I cooked it in my 12 in covered cast iron skillet, although I left the cover off for the first half of the cook time to let the sauce thicken some. 

I used bullseye homestyle bbq sauce, which is what we always use, it has a nice sweet flavor.

For my rub, and really when you're applying the dry spices to the uncooked meat you're doing a dry rub, I used some chipotle (smoked jalapeno) powder, some smoked paprika (great spice) some garlic, mustard powder, and then a bunch of this McCormick BBQ grill mates mixed spice. I really slathered on the spices, and you really need to. Watch any professional chef (Bobby Flay) or any BBQ contest and you'll see the rubs going on thick. Pork is fairly bland and with dry rubs you need to lay it on thick, and not timidly like

These were pretty good, and primarily tasted like BBQ sauce. The beer did not offer much to change the flavor.

I may make again, but will probably use some other seasonings on the meat itslef.

I would definitely make this recipe again!  I sprinkled my meat with Lawry's Seasoned salt...I didn't use as much as the recipe called for and added Sweet Baby Rays Barbecue Sauce as suggested by another reviewer.  My kids and my husband went bonkers over this and have asked me to make this again and again!!!!! THANK YOU KIMBERLY!!!!!

This was outstanding! I followed directions exactly, cooked the chops for almost 2 hours on the very lowest temp on the stovetop. The meat was fork tender. A big hit even with a picky teenager who prefers pretzels and pop.

This is a great recipe! Very easy to make and it tastes delicious, even my oldest daughter who is very picky loved it!
I made my own barbecue sauce from this site (Zippy Barbecue Sauce) and I used a nice dark beer. The chops didn't take as long as the recipe called for, but my chops were on the thinner side. I removed the meat and simmered just the sauce until it thickened. Added the chops back in and warmed them up and everything was perfect.
This is going into my recipe box and will be used again!

First I did not use the full amount of steak seasoning, I just seasoned the chops with salt, pepper, onion & garlic powder to our taste. Overall these tasted good but even after cooking for an hour and a half they were still a little on the dry side. I did use chops with the bone in as others suggested. I'll keep this recipe & may make it again.

I made this tonight; if I make it again I'll make several changes. First, I'd use quite a bit less steak spice. It was quite over-powering. Second, I'd use a sweeter barbecue sauce rather than a smokier one. Third, I'd cook it in the oven rather than on top of the stove. I have a ceramic-surface stove and this is not a good recipe for that. There was a 1/4 inch thick layer of almost-burnt sauce in the bottom of the pan.

This is about the third time I've made these wonderful pork chops.  This time I decided to write a review.  They are awesome and so easy.
Usually I tweak recipes just a little.  This one I follow exactly.. Well, except I didn't have any steak seasoning so I used a spice combo that I already had (onion, garlic etc).

This was really, really good. Thing is, I ended up using A1, not thinking it was different from barbecue sauce. Still turned out delicious, probably more so because it wasn't as powerful as BBQ sauce.
Also, keep in mind you might want to use a higher quality beer, otherwise you can taste the cheapness.

Excellent recipe and a great way to make pork chops.  I followed the recipe, used Corona and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  My teenage boys hate when I make pork chops, but ate all of it tonight.  I served it with mashed potatoes and used some corn starch to thicken the sauce and used it for gravy.  I simmered the pork chops for 2 hours on the stove and they were falling apart as I was pulling them out of the skillet.  Will absolutely be making this again and again.

Made exactly as specified - used that Montreal Steak seasoning mentioned by others (BTW - seasoning says 2 TBS for 2 lbs of meat and 6 chops were about that much).  It was good, LOTS of sauce but nothing special.  Super easy.  Next time I will make in crock pot.

Really enjoyed this.  I used rib pork chops and cut the recipe in half for two chops.  I used Sweet Bay Ray's Sweet and Spicy BBQ and Newcastle beer.  Plenty of sauce.  Leftovers are good on a sandwich roll for lunch!  Yum!

Excellent.  Followed the recipe exactly except added garlic powder and paprika to the spices.

I made it as directed and my family loved it. I used a bud light as that's what was on hand. Used a BBQ that wasn't my favorite but again it was what I had on hand. Next time I will try maybe a hickory flavor and I think I will love it even more. Even my child that doesn't care for chops loved it. A keeper for sure.

This recipe is AMAZING! I used coors light and sweet baby ray's original.  I sliced the onions 1/4 inch thick and lined my pan with them before placing the seasoned and seared chops on top of onions.  Cooked covered, on low for 2+ hrs.  meat was delicious and tender and the sauce came together nicely!  I added one fresh crushed tomato (seeded and chopped),1 Tbsp. of spicy course mustard and 1 Tbsp. smoked mustard, and about a 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Yum!

Great recipe!!  I have made this so many times that I have it memorized (not that hard).  I took others suggestions and have been using them over and over.  Go with Heineken and Sweet Babay Ray's and sweet onions. I find that 1.5 hours is perfect for getting that juicy tenderness, but if you are able to keep it an a slow simmer and nothing more, then longer will probably be good.  
I thought that something like Guinness would be good, but it did not turn out right.
This was my girlfriend's favorite, and she does not even like onions.  For me it was great but I cannot give five stars because it did not quite have that WOW factor.  Despite that, I still recommend it and make it all the time.

EDIT: I notice there are inconsistencies with how this turns out.  Perhaps its the pork or just me unknowingly altering my methods.  If it does not turn out very good the first time you make it, give it another try some other time.

Omg, so good. The chops were super tender and the recipe couldn't be easier. I took some suggestions from other reviewers and added a little garlic powder and garlic salt to the chops. Also, I added a couple of Tbs worcestershire sauce (just eyeballed it). Served with a salad.

Definitely a kid favorite in our house.  I found that I like it better with pork chops with a bone.  Still good without the bone but the meat was not as tender.

Wonderful twist on pork chops...scrumptious!  Have cooked as indicated in recipe.  Have also just thrown everything together when in a hurry, without searing pork chops, and still turned out great!  The longer they cook, the better--definitely simmer at least an hour.

I made this exactly as the recipes says! IT WAS WONDERFUL. I served with it some country style green beans. My children ate it and begged, BEGGED, for more. My husband loved it. It is flavorful and the chop is tender. I would recommend it.

I really liked this one. I followed someone else's idea of adding brown sugar and steak sauce.  The meat fell apart and it was delicious. I will make this again for a large group of people because there was alot of sauce left over.

These were very good!  I did marinate the pork 24hrs ahead of time and browned them with the marinade on them.  I then added a bottle of Guiness and sweet bbq sauce.  Slow cooked them in my crock pot and my whole family really liked them.  I left the onions in big rings and they came out nice and caramelized.  Will be making this again, thanks for the recipe!

This is basically a BBQ sauce flavored chops which was not bad but for my family, it was a bit strong on flavor.  I used bone in chops which was very tender.  I would probably use a bit less BBQ sauce and only one onion as most of it was tossed out in the end.  Overall, I would try it again with changes above.  If you love BBQ flavorings, you might really enjoy this.

I love bbq pork and this recipe was excellent for thin sliced port chops, which to me always end up dry.  I didn't have the A1 but used worchestershire and it was very good.

I followed the recipe almost to the letter, and they turned out GREAT.  The sauce went well over mashed potatoes.  I used only 4 bone-in chops so I used just a little less than what the recipe called for, but it worked out great.  House smelled so good while they were cooking.

Wow.  Super yummy.  Substituted worchestershire for the A-1 as others suggested, and only had half a bottle of BBQ sauce to put in. Which I thought was plenty.  Threw in some kale when simmering. Delish!  Thanks for this recipe!

I made this for my son and I last night and we both absolutely loved the tenderness of the pork chops.  He's not a big fan of pork chops as they always seem a bit dry...not last night. They are very flavorful and the sauce is great over buttered rice!

Sorry to say, but this did not go over well at my house.  I was so hoping it would because it's so easy!  Maybe it was the combination of beer and bbq sauce that I used - Bull's-Eye Original and Coors Light.  Or the steak seasoning I used.  Who knows.  But whatever the reason, it's not a recipe I'd recommend.  The flavors were just really off.

This is a winner!  Easy, inexpensive, and YUUUUUMMY!!  I accidentally bought bone-in pork chops, and they worked just fine.  I used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce and an imported beer (something like "Spaten"??) my husband likes.  My husband HATES pork chops, and made sure that I noticed that he was picking every piece of meat off of the bone because, "Heather - they're THAT good.  This recipe is a KEEPER in our relationship."  HA!  Mine only had to simmer for about 45 minutes, but I also was only cooking 2 chops, and they were fairly thin.  I'm eager to try this recipe again when we have company - SO EASY - just brown the chops, dump in the liquids and seasoning, then let it simmer!  GREAT with wild rice, veggies, and rolls!

I halved the recipe because there are only two of us.  All I can say is less beer and more BBQ sauce.  I still gave it a rating of 4 because it was tender, and the blended flavors tasted pretty darned good.  Just needed more BBQ sauce.

this was very good. I added a little cornstarch mixture to make the sauce a little thicker.

This is a really great way to prepare chops. The only thing i changed was i cut out the onion as they upset my hubby's stomach and just used onion salt instead.

This turned out great!  I used a salt free herb rub in place of the steak seasonings and paired it with garlic salt and onion powder.  Browned the pork chops in a tablespoon of EVOO.  I used 1 can of miller lite because my husband couldn't part with any of the darker beers we had!  We didn't have much BBQ sauce left, I'd say about 1/4 cup of sweet baby rays, plus about 2-3 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce and 1/4 cup of apple cidar vinegar.  I left it simmer for about 2 hours with a vidalia onion. I made a zucchini risotto to pair with it.  It was EXCELLENT!

Taste was a 3.5, ease was a 10.  The sauce was a bit much, but that was more my taste. (not a big fan of barbeque sauce) This was a great time saver and will definitely be used again.  It is a great alternative for pork.

This was delicious!  I am not sure what the other reviewer was talking about the smell?  The aroma was mouthwatering!  My husband who is very picky rated it a "keeper" and my kids loved it. I used a dry steak seasoning, added olive oil and minced garlic when I browned the chops.  I also used a Heineken beer.  One more thing...had some apple and sliced that up and added when I added the onion.  Thanks for sharing this great dish!

We really liked this recipe.  The pork chops were very tender and the onions were delish.  I will be making it again using chicken.

This needs more than 5 stars! I made this in the crock pot and it was absolutely delicious and so simple! I used Killians and KC style BBQ and cooked it on low for 6 hours. It was fork tender. I was sad that I only had 4 pork chops in the house because my son, husband and I wanted more. I will definitely make this again, soon, and I will use more than 4 chops. I used boneless by the way, and they turned out great. I will also try this with other meats like someone suggested- chicken is next on the list. Thank you for a terrific recipe I can share with family and friends!

We thought these were awesome.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Tangy BBQ sauce which worked out great.  I used garlic pepper for seasoning the chops.  Next time I would use another onion for a total of 3 because they shrink so much but they taste sooooooo good piled on top of the chops after simmering in all that sauce for so long.  Wonderful recipe which will be made again.  I'll bet you could do this in the crock pot with good results too.

One of my husband's favorite dinners! I used a little all-season salt instead, a coors light (what was in the fridge) and winking lizard BBQ sauce. My husband says its all about the BBQ sauce you use. I usually let them simmer for 1.5-2 hours. Serve over white rice. A super easy, yummy dinner!

I wanted to try for shredded pork sandwichs so I used a pork loin and cooked it in a slow cooker. Needless to say it ended up with a lot of liquid, so I removed the gravy, shredded the pork and chopped up the onions then added back in enough liquid for flavor. Very, very good. Thank you for the recipe - will use again.

The pork chops were very moist and flavorful!  The sauce came out a little to liquid for me so I added instant mash potatos to thicken it up!

I divided the recipe in half, and used thick-cut pork loin chops (perhaps this was a mistake).  After 2 hours of simmering on the lowest flame, the meat was still pretty tough (still took some effort with a knife), but the sauce was delicious with rice.  Overall I was pretty happy with this dish, though I think I need to dabble with a few changes.  Thanks for the recipe!

We loved this!  I did omit the steak seasoning and added some smoked sausage in with the pork chops.  I've made this a few times and it's always great.  I've subbed chicken for the pork chops, too and it's just as good.

I wish I would have read Elli's review before starting out as my chops were on the dry side; however, I will try this recipe again as the flavors are tangy and delicious and it is a great one pan recipe that goes well with mac and cheese (who doesn't love homemade mac n cheese?)

Let me start by saying I can't cook.  We eat out most of the time and I am always trying to find goof proof recpes I can't mess up.  I really tried to mess this one up.  I bought cheap meat (reduced price before it expires) and froze it.  Pulled it out of the freezer 2 hrs before use.  Used Icehouse (what I had on hand) and Bone Suckin Sauce (BBQ) as well as seasoning salt.  I did as the recipe says and browned the meat, added the beer and BBQ then add meat again and onions.  Then I boiled it in the pan for 2 hours.  Yes, medium high heat (not simmer) and stired it every 5 mins or so.  I can tell you my hubby said this was the best pork chop he has ever tasted.  He is a big guy who takes his food as serious as his next breath.  After reheating it in the Microwave it was fork tender.  It is sweet but very good.  I will be making it again (there goes my I can't cook lets eat out excuse).  I would recommend brown rice.  White rice was to blah for this sweet dish.  Thanks for making me cook this again!  :-)

As written this recipe was OK.  I really liked the sauce, but the chops were not as tender as I had hoped.  I might try it again in the slow cooker.

This was really good and the beer made them very juicy.  I only gave it 4 stars because we didn't like it with the steak seasoning on it.  We will most definately make this again but will use either hickory salt or just salt and pepper.

The best recipe I've found for pork chops.  Use the steak seasoning to your family's preference.  I used very thin pork chops and didn't cook it for what was suggested, and it turned out great.

This is a good recipe and my kids liked it. I would definitely slow cook it for a long time to get the chops tender.  I fried the onions in the drippings and some of the beer as well cause we like them crispy but after slow cooking they kinda cooked away anyway. Can try frying and then adding them to the top of the chops when they are done.  Served with mashed potatoes with ranch dressing in them and was a hit.

Very, very good - great flavor! Family liked it very much. Used the thick cut on the bone. I simmered for the full 2 hours, and some dried out a bit, while others were super juicy. I have a gas range and even on low it packs a punch. I'll cut cook time down next time to an hour. Oh yeah, there'll be a next time. . .

This was an awesome recipe.  Delicious.  Per the reviews I added Worcestershire's sauce, brown sugar and used less BBQ sauce then the recipe called for.

My boyfriend the beer connoisseur, had a Troegs HopBack Amber Ale he refused to drink and thought he threw away at one point, the beer in which I used for this recipe, and it turned out delicious.  I guess my point is, no matter how terrible the beer, you cannot go wrong with this recipe.

My husband & I loved this recipe.  I followed the  recipe to a T & all turned out perfectly.  The chops were moist & very flavorful.  We were glad there were leftovers & looked forward to having them a second night.  This was a nice change from just plain old pork chops.  Thumbs up as my 2.5yo says.

The sauce was yummy, but very thin.  I would decrease the amount of beer to one half a bottle next time.

The name says it all - I couldn't believe how easy and delicious this was. My entire family raved and was fighting over the leftovers! I even ran out of BBQ sauce, so I used Ketchup, Worsteshire, tabasco, and maple syrup to make more sauce and that was great too. This one is a keeper!

These were great. We're Guinness drinkers, so I used that. I found that my chops came out much darker, so i recommend going with a pale ale. I used masterpiece BBQ sauce, and skipped the onions because I hate them. Advice to others who said their pork chops tasted weird: you probably don't have your proportions right. Great recipe overall.

This was a good dish; very tender from the long and slow cooking process. Just not as flavorful as I was expecting. I was hoping that the combination of the beer with the BBQ sauce and onions would really "Wow" us... but sadly, it did not. The flavor of the beer was totally lost, (and I used Amberbock, which is quite good in other recipes I've tried it in). It just tasted like pork with a ton of BBQ sauce. Still a good meal, but nothing too special.

Like others I tweaked it a bit, I added some garlic, green peppers, brown sugar and the beer I used was Bud Light and the Barbeque sauce was Jack Daniels.  This dish was wonderful! My husband and kids really really enjoyed this. It was super easy and tasted really tasty. Fantastic!

Very good! This recipe is so easy, simple, not many ingredients and delicious! I used boneless pork chops and they were as tender as could be! I used a seasoning salt since I don't quite care for steak seasoning. I will play around with the seasoning next time but wither way, this was great!

I just made this today, and we loved it!!!  I used Michelob beer and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce.  I used the "honey" flavor to tone down some of the spiciness of the steak seasoning.  I used thick, center-cut, bone-in chops but only one large vidalia onion and simmered for 2 hrs.  The chops were very tender and had a wonderful flavor.  I served it with garlic butter rice and french style green beans.  What a great meal!  So easy, yet tastes like it took alot of work!  My husband is not a big fan of pork chops, but he loved this!  I will be making it again!

I made this in a pan on top of the oven, used Sam Adams honey porter beer and honey BBQ sauce. The chops were so tender, but the sauce is so thin, think next time I'll use less beer. I did add some brown sugar to thicken sauce a bit. My husband raved about these and wants me to make again.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I used thick boneless pork chops and added a few drops of Worcestershire and A-1 to the sauce.  For the beer I used Guinness and for the bbq sauce I used the original flavor of Sweet Baby Ray's.  I simmered the pork chops for a little less than an hour, and they came out very moist and had really great, tasty flavor.  We will definitely be making this recipe again!

This as many have said, was a great base recipe. I used two boneless thick cut chops and they turn out great. It is easy to adjust to your tastes, just by altering the beer or bbq sauce you use.

We all loved this.  I thought my 12 year old son would make him self sick, he ate so much.  It is really good and the sauce has just the right consistency.  I cooked mine for close to 2 hours and the meat was very tender.  I did not change a thing.  Now my parents want me to cook it for them and invite them over.  Great recipe.

Again, I have found another fantastic recipe on this site.  These pork chops were great.  Followed the recipe, but being from west Texas, I added a finely chopped jalapeno.  I let it simmer on low in my Dutch Oven for at least 4 hours.  Yummy.  Thanks.

These chops were so moist they were falling apart!  I did sprinkle the steak sauce on and marinate them in the beer with a small amount of BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's, of course!) for 2 hours before cooking.  I also a touch of garlic powder to the chops when browning them.  This is definitely a keeper!!
P.S.  Made this with the "Indiana Potato Salad" recipe from this site and it was wonderful together!!!  (It is a hot sidedish, not cold as you might think from the title.)

I used some nice thick cut boneless chops with half Sweet Baby Ray's and  Speed Queen's hot wing bbq sauce for a little heat.  They turned out great.  Beer flavor is hardly noticeable unfortunately but the pork is fall apart fork tender.  I will definately make this recipe again.

not very flavorful. I put in the whole bottle of bbq sauce eventually (I made the recipe smaller) but it was still just watery soup around the chop. The meat was very tender, but I ended up dipping it straight in the sauce.

I used about 1/2 teaspoon of seasoning salt and these came out excellent!  The meat just fell right off of the bone.

Made this with thick pork loin chops tonite. After simmering an hour on low, they were medium/medium-well and smothered in sauce they were delicious! We have gluten sensitivities and allergies in our home so beer was a no-go. Swapped in a Diet Coke in its place (also have corn allergies so nothing with corn syrup) and used a honey-garlic bbq sauce - the kids LOVED it. (Except for the onions)

Used bone-in pork chops and these turned out GREAT.
So easy to do and they were fall off the bone tender and juicy.
I will be making these again.
Thanks!

Made it with country ribs and cooked it for about 2-1/2 hours.  Pulled out the meat when it was tender and cooked down the sauce by half and then added back the meat.

Made this for dinner tonight. Recipe was just okay. We like BBQ, but the sauce was a bit too spicy and thin instead of a thicker consistency we prefer.  The pork wasn't as moist as I expected either, but that's probably because I used boneless pork loin chops with no fat in them....guess I'll go back to grilling them as that's how they stay juicy when cooked.

I believe using bone in chops is key . Although I used a quality BBQ sauce, it is what it is! Quick, minimum effort and chops with sauce poured over them. I'm not interested in making them again.

My family loved it. I only made on major change. I don't like beer. So I replaced the beer with Cherry Coke. The flavor was great! This would be perfect with country ribs in a slow cooker. This one's added to my cookbook! Thanks for sharing!!!

Tried it tonight, I normally make a brown sugar pork chop but wanted to try something a little bit different. Came across this gem and thought, why the heck not! I am sure glad that I decided to take a chance, this recipe is awesome! Everyone loved it, I look forward to being able to make some changes to by changing the type of beer and bbq sauce that I used. I am excited to be able to make this for more people! Awesome recipe!

These were SO tasty!  I used a sweet Amish bbq and Montreal Steak seasoning, and then baked them at 300 degrees for 30 minutes.  They were cooked absolutely perfect.....SO tender.  I'll definitely be making them again soon!

Kids didn't like the onion on top (but to them serving something with obvious onions should be against the Geneva Conventions).  Hubby (who generally won't eat onions either) ended up eating all their onions, which shows how good it actually is.

I read over this recipe really quick one night and made it for dinner, without the beer since my husband recently had a liver transplant.  It was still really good! Then I called my sister and told her about it and she made the same recipe only with chicken, and she said it was awesome! Tonight the hubby did not eat dinner with us so I actually followed the recipe with the beer and it was way better! I love this one, thanks for a great dinner!

We loved this! I used Guiness Stout and Sweet Baby Rays Honey BBQ. I don't even like pork most of the time, but this flavor and the tenderness of the pork (I used center cut loin chops) made the meal a hit. We had alot of leftover sauce, so we used again over some cooked chicken. YUM!

I made this for my hubby tonight as he was craving pork chops.  He wanted something with BBQ sauce as his mother used to make him BBQ pork chops as a child, so I found this recipe and decided to give it a try.  I admit that I made a few changes based on the ingredients I had on hand and my hubby's tastes.  I marinated the pork chop in molasses and salt for about 2-4 hours prior to cooking.  Then I seasoned with pepper and garlic powder before browning.  I then used whiskey instead of beer as my hubby LOVES whiskey.  I also added a bit of Worcestershire with the BBQ sauce and a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar since the husband prefers a more sweet sauce.  My chops were pretty thin so I did not simmer them for as long as suggested, but they turned out GREAT.  The hubby loved the sauce and the chop was super tender.  Will definitely make again as I know that I will soon get a request from the husband. Thanks for the recipe.

Yum!   Will be one of our favorites and it was super easy......just has to have time for it.  Next time, instead of simmering on the stove, I think I will put it in the slow cooker and cook it.  Then I won't be pushing for time.

This was so delicious and easy. I used Amstel Light beer and Jack Daniels BBQ sauce.  The pork chops came out perfectly, very tender and my three children(one who is a very picky eater)loved it!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!!! I have to admit,initially I wasn't so sure I would like it as the ingredients listed didn't sound too appealing. After I made this once,my husband and 3year old asked for it again and again!! It has now became a staple in our house and for guests!! I served this with homefries and green beans!

Absolutely delicious!! Very tender ... bones fell right off after about an hour of simmering. I used Shiner Blonde and Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ Sauce. Amazing recipe we will continue to use!!

This was definitely different and delicious! I seasoned the pork with garlic salt, sea salt, course black pepper and some steak seasoning. After I browned the pork in EVOO I added 3/4 cups of BBQ sauce and 3/4 cups of beer. I used what was on hand which was Bud Light. And topped with a chopped red onion and let it simmer for 2 hours. It was very tasty. I had so much sauce! Next time more or thicker pork chops. I had 5 thin cuts. Or maybe let it sit to thicken. I will try again!

I do not like beer so I was a bit hesitant, but this turned out really great. It smells like McRibs, and I bet that you could make them with this recipe if you used thin cuts of meat and served the meat and onions on buns with some pickle. I suspect that the reason some people do not like this is because the term "steak seasoning" is a bit vague. I found it in the spice aisle, but if you use marinade mix or A1 or something other than the bottle of dry spice mix then it wouldn't taste the same. We served it with mashed potatoes after it had simmered for an hour.

Great recipe!  Easy and delicious!  I used McCormick's Montreal Chicken Seasoning on the chops, a bottle of Sam Adams and Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ Sauce.  I simmered the chops uncovered for the last 20 minutes to thicken the sauce and served w/rice.  Everyone loved it!

Liked how the meat fell apart so easily, but did think I may have cooked it too long as it did seem a little dry to me.

Not a big hit with me but the hubby absolutley loved it.  While cooking, it made the whole house smell delicious so I was very hopeful.  The meat did come out very tender but there was too much of an after taste of beer in the sauce. Maybe I should of not used Heineken?  The beer also made the dish too sweet for my liking.  I'm thinking this dish might be an aquired taste type of thing and looks like hubby loved it so much that next time, he will just have to give me the night off from cooking and whip it up for himself :-)

Thank you so much for this recipe.  The pork chops were very tender & had fantastic flavor.  I had almost given up on pork chops, as they never turned out as tender as I liked.  The beer took care of that.  I used 2/3 of a bottle of Famous Dave's Devils Spit barbecue sauce, some worcestershire sauce & a small amout of water & Yuengling beer.  Seasoned them with Montreal Steak Seasoning as suggested.  My husband & I enjoyed every bite.  Cooked it slowly on top of stove for about 2 hours.  Will definitely be preparing this again.

Great sauce.  I used bone in chops and cooked for 1 1/2 hours and found them to be a little tough.  Next time will simmer for only an hour or so.

My 7 year old loved this asked for thirds.  This recipe is a keeper for our family.   I followed much of DesiLuGirl's advise but used Montreal Steak Seasoning, Garlic Powder, and Pepper to season the pork chops.  The sauce I did  exactly like DesiLuGirl except I used a little more beer a bottle and a quarter (Coors Light) and I substituted the Splenda Brown Sugar for the regular Br Sugar.

This recipe actually is MY kid's favorite pork chops. This is a simple, yummy recipe that I have now made many times, each time my whole family loves it. I use whatever beer I have on hand and Sweet Baby Ray's B-B-Que sauce.

very tender, could cut with a fork.  A little spicy for young kids.  We used heineken draught beer from a "heine-keg."  I will definitely make this again but use less steak seasoning  to make it less spicy.

VERY GOOD!  My whole family ate it up.  No left overs darn!  I think next time I will try a different BBQ sauce.  I used a sweet one which was fine, but we all agreed it would be even better with one that was not so sweet.

I was very impressed with this meal! I used hicory bbq just some store brand, Bud light, and i added about a tablesppoon of A1 as well. It smells amazeing, so good my sister in law who lives in out basment downstairs said it smelled so much downstairs that she had to come up and try a bite before she went to bed because it smelled that good... and then when she tried it she loved it so i gave her the recipe and she is going to make it for her kids tommarow. I will be makeing this many many more times! It actually might be one of my husbands favorite dishes that i made!

What a great simple little recipe. Family LOVED it and my son is not a big pork fan. HE was disappointed that I only did 4 chops and not 6. Boiled sauce a bit longer to thickin. YUM.

This was wonderful. I used a can of Coors Lite and bottle of sweet and spicy bbq sauce we got from Zest Fest in Fort Worth this year. I forgot the onions but it probably didn't need them. I used bone in pork chops and cooked for one hour and they were very moist. These were better them putting them on the grill.

So easy and delicious!  I used a honey wheat beer and the dregs of two bottles of bbq sauce I had in the fridge.  Both of my 4-year-olds asked for seconds!

This got a "WOW honey, that's good!" from hubby.  I followed exactly except baked in oven instead of in the pan on stovetop, didn't have a pan big enough.  Great flavor & fall off the bone moist!

Pretty good recipe!  I didn't have steak seasoning, so I used salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  I also added about 1 tbsp of steak sauce to the sauce. I used thick cut boneless pork chops and they did not get dry.  Took about 1 1/2 hours to cook.  The sauce tasted great on top of the chops!

Awesome recipe. My boyfriend actually found this and cooked dinner for me, obviously a very simple recipe. Great flavor... only one suggestion, definitely use pork chops with the bone in. They come out so much more tender than the boneless pork chops. Love this recipe, thanks!

Fantastic flavor!!!  I used 2 very thick pork chops with bone-in, Montreal Steak seasoning, KC's Honey bbq sauce and Shiner lite beer.  Nice and spicy. Super easy!  I only used one onion and that was enough for us.  I made mini sandwiches using the Hawaiin Bread, nice combo of spicy sauce and sweet bread.  I will make again!

AWESOME!! I recently got married and this was the first meal I made for my husband. So easy! He absolutely loves it and it's one of his favorites! I used garlic salt instead of steak seasoning and every time I make it, I try a different beer. So far, bud light's my favorite. The sauce is really good on mashed potatoes.

Good...good but not amazing. It did turn out tender. Stuck to the recipe, used Red Stripe beer. Get the thick bone in pork chops so they don't dry out. Great with mashed potatoes

This was very tender but the flavor was just okay.  The flavor is very dependent on which steak seasoning, beer, and bbq sauce you use.  My combo was just okay.  Will try again with different seasoning because we loved the ease of the technique and the tender result.

This recipe is pretty good but it is not outstanding. I used Budweiser and KC BBQ sauce. I think maybe next time I'll cook them in a crock pot so that I can let them cook for 6hrs instead of 2hrs. My 3 year old did eat almost a whole pork chop, so I gave it 3 Stars!! Thanks for the recipe!

i used a little bit over a half a bottle of Bud Light, and half a bottle of Bull's Eye Hickory Smoke BBQ sauce. I didn't like the smell of it when it was cooking, but after 2 hours of simmering, the food was very good. i was surprised at how tender they came out

This was a very easy and delicious recipe. I did as others suggested and used chops with the bone. The chops I used were very thick; I wished I would have allowed 3 hrs. to simmer them. They were still cooked thru but longer would have helped make them more tender. Definitely a keeper!

I loved the sauce, but my pork chops didn't turn out very tender.  The sauce tasted really good (especially with rice), but I wish I could have made it a bit thicker.

A great recipe that is SOOOOOO quick to prepare.  It seriously took me five minutes to get everything ready to cook.  If you need an easy meal as far as preparation and have the time to keep it on the stovetop for two hours, this is it!  We will be making this again.  The pork was so tender and I knew from the minute I put everything in the pan that the sauce would be yummy.  It smells wonderful!

I remember my mother making something like this and we really enjoyed it! I used 1/2 cup each ketchup, bbq sauce, shiraz wine and water. Seasoned chops with Montreal steak spice and added Worchestire sauce and 1 tbsp minced garlic with onions.

Everyone loved these pork chops.  They were so simple to prepare. Since I did not have any steak sauce, I just seasoned with salt and pepper.  A real keeper.

We all loved it. At first I wasn't sure about pork chops with BBQ sauce, but this was fantastic! I followed the recipe. I made no changes.

This was very tasty, and could not have been easier. I followed the recipe exactly, using Rolling Rock Beer and Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ sauce.  Really excellent!  I'll definitely be adding this to my favorites.  Thanks!

Fantastic Recipe! We adjusted by just adding some more onions. My 2 year old loved it! I cannot wait to try it again with a pork loin in the crock pot with some potatoes! Thanks for sharing!

I made this exactly as described, using sweet baby rays bbq sauce, montreal steak seasoning and sweet onions. The sauce was excellent and a keeper! My only problem was that my pork chops still were not tender in the center after 2 hours of simmering. Not sure if cooked too long or not enough? Too high heat or too low? Maybe I did not brown them enough? I'm not sure as I am new to making pork chops but they always seem dry. If anyone has suggestions, please post, as I want to make these again because I loved the sauce but need more tender meat (I used eye of round, bone-in pork chops). Great recipe!

This was delicious!! I also used Montreal seasoning, Heineken & for sauce I used Kraft "Honey" BBQ Sauce and a red onion I had in the cupboard. My youngest child thought it was a bit peppery so maybe a touch less seasoning next time. I did not measure how much, I just sprinkled liberally. I stabbed the meat with a fork before I sprinkled, once seasoned, I rubbed the seasoning into the holes with the back of a spoon. My family is very used to me experimenting at meal time and they were all pleasantly suprised, even my picky teenager who hates pork gobbled this up.

Really, really good, really, really simple, and really low in calories! My boyfriend loved it and has already said he wants me to make it again. I followed another suggestion and used bone-in pork chops, Guinness, spicy Montreal Steak Seasoning, added three cloves of chopped garlic, and I also used Bull's Eye Guinness flavored bbq sauce. I let it simmer for 2 hours and it was falling off the bone!

The entire family loved this recipe.  Even my son who is a picky eater had seconds!  I didn't use the steak seasoning, but seasoned it with a shake of this and a dash of that.  Turned out great!  Will definately make again.

My first Review!  This was soooooo good.  I used a pork loin instead of chops, Guinness and Sweet Baby Ray's honey bbq sauce, and cooked it in the crockpot.  Oops, forgot the steak seasoning...  The pork came out so tender I ended up shredding it and served it over mashed potatoes with broccoli. Even the picky eater ate everything.  Thanks for a super easy, tasty recipe!

Loved this one. Changes that I made: used bone in chops, doubled the sauce mixture, used a splash of apple-cider vin., used the montreal steak seasoning, used a tad minced garlic. Perfect with rice. thx!

We absolutely loved this recipe! I only had 2 chops so had to scale the recipe. Didn't have beer so used coke and no steak seasoning so used a season-all seasoning.  They turned out so scrumptious - can't wait to make them again - with beer this time.  Hubby used the sauce left in the pan over his baked potato and proclaimed it the best potato "gravy" he ever had. Every bit of sauce and onion got eaten. Mmmmmm!!!

All three of my young children and my husband loved these pork chops.  I must say that I was so-so about them but will keep making them since they were such a hit with the family.  I did use a tangy BBQ sauce which I will substitute with more sweet sauce in the future.

I read the previous reviews and still used boneless pork chops mostly because we already had them. They were awesome! The best pork chops I've ever had. I used Guiness for the beer and added some garlic powder and paprika to the spice rub and then added a few handfuls of brown sugar to the bbq sauce and beer combo, delicous!

I am not a big pork chop fan, but my husband is so I decided to give these a whirl.  I LOVED them.  I think they are the best pork chops I have ever had.  One reason I dont really like pork chops is b/c they usually end up a little chewy and dry but these are really moist and tender.  I dont think it is possible to mess this one up you will get moist and tender pork chops everytime :)

I made this last night for my husband and me.  OMG, this was terrific! I followed the recipe with the exception of only cooking 4 chops, and using a mix of garlic powder, meat tenderizer, and parsley for the “steak sauce”.  I used Kraft Honey Smoked BBQ sauce and cooked the chops for about 1 ½ hours.  The aroma was terrific while cooking.  My husband ate 3 out of the 4 chops, all his sides (corn and green beans) and after clearing the table, I found him with a loaf of bread sponging up the remaining sauce from the pan!!  Even my cats loved this recipe, although they didn’t get any meat, they stood next to my husband begging for bread soaked in the sauce!  Needless to say, there were NO leftovers and it made my clean-up job easier.  (HAHA).  This is definitely a keeper !!

Baby back ribs were used instead of chops. They slow cooked for 6 hours as I had to leave the house and they turned out awesome served over a bed of basmati rice. Well worth the time and the beer...lol. We all loved it!

I really liked this recipe, but my husband didn't like it at all.  Since I'm the one online, I'm rating it a 4.  The only reason he didn't like it was the BBQ & beer combined kind of gave it a teriyaki flavor, which he doesn't care for, but I happen to love!  So, it's all in what you like.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe and it was tender, flavorful and delicious.

These were okay. My husband loves bbq sauce, so he was happy. I think I cooked them a little too long because they were slightly dried out. But, easy enough to be worth trying again.

I used bone-in porkchops, sprinkled the chops with steak seasoning otherwise followed the recipe. I simmered them for the entire 2 hours. It was very easy and came out great. Even my pickiest eater loved it!

This is a very good, simple way to do pork chops. I will definitely make this again. I generally followed the recipe except that I sauteed the onions after browning the chops in order to soften them. I also reduced the beer by boiling it to about 1/2 before adding the barbecue sauce. When I make this again, I may omit the steak seasoning. I would only use the seasoning if I had a very mild barbecue sauce.

My husband and I really liked these chops.  I don't know if we will use steak seasoning next time we make them.  I don't know that we like it with pork that much.  We minced and added 4 cloves of garlic to the sauce because we really like garlic.  I didn't have anything but lime beer but it was really good.  Oh and I probably wouldn't cook them for 2 hours next time.  I didn't plan on it this time but time got away from me.  I would shoot for 1 1/2 hours.  This recipe is definitely added to my cookbook :-)

This was a delicious dish, and I found it on the rih side.  I think the kind of beer and of course BBQ really makes the difference in taste.  I'll keep using a variety until I find the WOW.  I used Alexander Keiths beer, and Bold's Hickory smoke BBQ sauce.  My house smelled yumm for hours and the meat was very tender.  Served this on rice and corn on the cob!  Will make again!

These were ok.  I thought the flavor was fine, but they were still alittle dry...I had to poor applesauce on my plate to eat one.  Also, my husband said he like them, but he would normally eat two and he only ate one.....just dry....I won't make these again.

I used pork steaks and it made for a very tender, succulent meal.  Sprinkled the steaks with some seasoned black pepper, thyme and paprika, browned and removed from pan.  Added a diced stalk of celery and a minced garlic clove with the onion and let it cook slightly, then removed from pan.  Deglazed with the beer, then added the bbq sauce and put in the meat and veggies.  Probably simmered about 2 hours.  So good, especially with mashed potatos.

This was a wonderful recipe! Delicious! I used Rickard's Honey Brown beer, and a bottle of President's Choice Maple, Apple and Beer Barbecue/Marinade Sauce. I didn't have any steak seasoning, so I made a concoction of garlic salt, fresh ground pepper, and turmeric...to give it a bit of spice.
We will definitely use this recipe again. We're thinking of using Diana sauce next time. :-) Thanks for sharing everyone!

UPDATE: I've tried this recipe a few more times since my first review and I found a combo that makes this great! I use Sam Adams Cherry Wheat beer & Bulls-Eye Brown Sugar & Hickory bbq sauce. Even people who aren't big fans of pork liked them! I also turn the heat up a bit at the end of cooking and take the lid off so the sauce thickens and can be used to serve over the chops.  ORIGINAL REVIEW 3/11/08: I didn't have high expectations for this dish because of the variance in taste depending on beer and sauce used, but it turned out well!  I used Killian's and Open Pit Sweet BBQ sauce (which I'd never had before) and the meat was tender and flavorful. My only problem was the sauce was more like a broth because it barely thickened. I will make this again.

I made this recipe exactly according to directions and it turned out really well. It was soooo easy. I can't understand why anyone would have trouble with this. Anyone that has cooked more then once in their life knows you sprinkle seasoning according to taste. I used Heineken for the beer. 

I've made this twice and both times it came out wonderfully. My guests walked into the house the second time commenting on how wonderful it smelled. If you like tender meat this recipe is for you.

My family really liked these tasty chops.  I rubbed Montreal steak seasoning into the chops before browning them.  I used Sweet baby rays honey BBQ sauce and Bush beer.  I used one large sweet onion.  I let it simmer for 2 hours and it fell off the bone.  It was flavorful and tasty.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

These pork chops do indeed come out very tender.  However I feel personally that the sauce needs more seasoning.  I added some worstershire, dijon mustard, garlic, pepper & paprika.  I also seasoned the meat with a mesquite dry rub.  The meat was very tender & the sauce was delicious, awesome over rice!  Very good recipe, just needs more seasoning.

I have done this recipe twice and it is better every time. One hour of cooking time is really all you need. I used light beer and sugar free bbq sauce to make it a little more healthy.

I made this for my wife and we both loved it.  I reduced all the ingredients (except the beer) for 2 chops.  Try them Texas style with Shiner Bock beer and Stubb's BBQ sauce.  You won't regret it.

Mmmmm! These are fantastic! Just had them for dinner and they were really, really good! My twelve year old couldn't get over the fact that mom put beer in the recipe...he kept asking if it was ok to eat them. Thanks for a fantastic dish!

Very good.  I added worchestershire & some A-1 like another reviewer (didn't have any brown sugar but I'll add next time).  I also used Miller Lite beer & it was great.  I put this in the crockpot on high for 4 hours using 4 porkchops.  It was falling apart & very tender by dinner time.  The only thing I would do differently is to double the pork chops.  We had plenty of the BBQ sauce leftover & I wish I had more meat to shred & use for leftovers the next day.

We had it for dinner tonight. It was great! I used less seasoning, becauese two Tbl. is so much(i have made that mistake before). Make sure you keep the heat down, or you will simmer all of the liquid out.

This was a pretty tasty dish. I was looking for something a little different from my usual pork chop entree, and this fit the bill. I wasn't wowed by it, but it was pretty good.

I'm not a huge fan of pork chops and I don't really like onions, but this recipe made both taste fabulous!!!  I used Bud Light and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and I substituted garlic powder, salt, and pepper for the steak seasoning.  This is such an easy recipe to make, too!  Thanks!

Excellent recipe to make for a group too, just double the liquids.  I like darker beer, so I used Sam Adams Brown Ale and in addition to the steak seasoning, I added a bit of fresh chopped rosemary.  We ate it with roasted veggies and thick Dutch style noodles also boiled in a beer and some water.

I have a bad track record with pork chops, and figured these would turn out like my chops usually do; dry, rubbery and tasteless.  Boy, was I wrong!  After simmering them for only an hour and a half, they were so tender they fell apart easily.  The sauce smelled great, the ingredients are things I usually have on hand, and even my picky husband loved them.  I'll be making these again, for sure.

Honestly I followed most of the changes that DesiLuGirl posted in her review.  I had a hard time keeping the cooking temperature low enough on my Korean gas stove...oh how I miss my electric stovetop back home in the U.S.  I think next time I may try them in a slow cooker or the oven.  Delicious though. Good stuff!

These were pretty good.  I wouldn't say they are the best and there are so many recipes to try that I will try many others.  I thought this had a strange tang to it, not terrible tasting though, just a bit "off" for me.  We still have a few leftover from a few nights ago that no one has asked for so I guess it's not something you just can't wait to dig back into it again the next day.  All and all a quick weeknight dinner with ingregients most of us have on hand which is exactly what I was looking for.  Oh, I used Coors light beer and Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce b/c it's what i had on hand.

Not bad, would prefer to have with RIBS instead of the chops.  I sauteed the onions 1st which made a good taste to the sauce .. The flavor was good -- But will try next time with ribs.

I enjoyed this recipe, but my fiance wasn't a big fan.  I used Bud Light and I think a beer that was more bitter would have complimented the sweetness of BBQ sauce better, but that would probably depend on personal taste.  This is extremely easy and the meat was very tender (falling apart!).  Next time I'm going to try this with a roast and make pulled pork.  I think the flavor would lend itself really well to that.

Pretty good. I seasoned with salt & pepper and montreal steak seasoning and it turned out a little too salty. Next time I won't be so generous with the seasoning and let the sauce do all the work.

Great recipe!  My husband and I have never really liked pork chops and we both loved these.  I have never found a recipe where the pork didn't end up tasting like shoe leather until I came across this recipe.  I will use again and again...thanks!!!

My whole family enjoys this recipe. We have made ot twice. The first time with bone in chops and the second with boneless. The bone in came out much better. Tender and flavorful.

This was just ok.  Definitely not MY kids' favorite pork chops.  It seemed like it was lacking something in the flavor.

My fiance and I made this and we both loved it! We used a good quality beer (fat tire) and a quality BBQ sauce. I think using the quality ingrediants may have been the difference. Im excited I found this recipe!

This was outstanding, I chose it because of the short ingredient list.  I did not have steak sauce, so I sprinkled some seasoned salt prior to browning them.  My family loved these, there was not a single morsel left for our dog on that night....unusual!

Nothing better than the flavor of the beer, onion and BBQ sauce.  Absolutely excellent and my children enjoyed it as well. I had no idea what to cook and I will definitely keep this recipe in my box!

I call it "My Husband's favorite pork chops".  Great flavor and easy to make.  I was, however, a bit insulted when my husband said he liked it better than my regular pork chop recipe.  Ha Ha.  It will be served again and again!

These were ok, mine turned out kind of dry. Maybe I left them in there too long.

These were okay.  Extra points for being easy.  I thought they were a little spicy for a kid friendly recipe.  (maybe it was just my steak rub)  My husband liked them and they were very tender.  I just thought the flavor was a little strange.  I'll definately duplicate the cooking process, just adjust the ingredients next time.  Thanks.

Very easy and the chops just fell apart. Added some hot sauce and a few spices,but still missing something in the sauce.

On the advice of a previous review, I used Montreal Steak seasoning, 'Sweet Baby Ray's' Honey BBQ Sauce and Vidalia onions.  After simmering for 2hrs, it was so tender it was falling apart.  Will make again soon.

How  in the world can this be a "kids" pork chop, exclude the beer, it made my friends son very sick.
