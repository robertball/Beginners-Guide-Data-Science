Really good.  Super easy to make, even if you don't have  an ice cream maker.  It doesn't freeze solid, so a metal bowl in the freezer would do just as well.  Think it would be good with some cream cheese  added too.

This is great!  I took the advice of another reader and omitted all of the sugar.  I too froze it in a bag and kneaded it a couple times.  I didn't think the peanut butter was overwhelming, but I could see using less of it if you wanted more of the Bailey's flavor.   I'll definitely make it again!

I didn't have any Bailey's so I used White Vanilla Syrup instead.   It is awesome.   I used my Kitchenaid Ice Cream Freezer and it was done in about 15 minutes.

This was very tasty. When mixing I decided to omit the sugar.. As i found it was sweet enough with the peanut butter . I don't have an ice cream maker so I poured it all into a freezer bag and layed it flat in the freezer. I gave it a good "smoosh" ever hour for a few hours to break it up.. And after supper it was ready. It sure was smooth and delicious. If I make this again I will also cut back the peanut butter a bit as I found it overpowered the Bailey's. I couldn't imagine the taste with all the sugar (my teeth hurt thinking about it) BUT if you're someone looking for an alternative.. Just omit the sugar (or add some honey) all together as it really doesn't need it. I served mine with a dark chocolate drizzle.. And I found this really complemented the peanut butter and Bailey's nicely.

Great taste and texture. Due to the Bailey's it went freeze completely (which makes it easier to serve).
