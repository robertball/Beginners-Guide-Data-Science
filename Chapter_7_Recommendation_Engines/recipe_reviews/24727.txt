I recognize that everyone else really enjoyed this recipe, but I did not.  First of all, when I am eating something loaded down with fat, I want it to be AWESOME!  I could NOT get the breadcrumbs to stick to the onions!  I crushed the crumbs down to almost nothing, but they would not stay on the onions.  I then got frustrated with that and started just coating with flour and dipping in the batter.  I couldn't tell the difference between the two.  My bread crumbs were soggy and stuck together; they ended up being a great treat for my dogs!  When eating the rings, they were incredibly bland.  Maybe if the crumbs would have stuck it would have tasted better, but that didn't work.  I sprinkled with garlic salt and that seemed to give some flavor.  I won't make this again.

These went over very well with everybody.  I was told to keep this recipe for the next onion ring craving.  I followed the recipe except that I fried them in vegetable oil.  I used my fry daddy with helps with the oil tempature alot.  Watch them closely they cook VERY fast.

These were ok but I couldn't keep the breading on these. I tried pat drying the onions before dipping them and time and time again the breading just fell right off. Oh well.

These were better than I thought they would be. However, I did have the same problem a few others have reported as far as getting the flour to stick.  What I did was mixed the flour and bread crumbs together.  I dipped the onions in the egg/cream mixture and then into the flour & crumbs.  It seemed to work out fine.  I also used half & half since I didn't have any heavy cream but the taste was good and they were gone within a matter of minutes.  I also used my deep fryer to make these.

These onion rings were awesome!!  So easy to make and so tasty.  I didn't give them five stars because they felt like they were missing something in flavor, but I couldn't put my finger on it (my husband said they were a 4.25 rating).

I think I have tried every onion ring recipe on this site and this is my favorite so far. I didn't have the cream so I used milk instead and they turned out great.
