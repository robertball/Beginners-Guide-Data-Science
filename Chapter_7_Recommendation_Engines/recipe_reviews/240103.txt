Made this for Magic Cookie Bars, best batch I ever made!  I love the oatmeal crust and will never use graham crackers again!

Used this recipe for lemon bars I made as I wanted the crust for it to have more substance. Had to double the recipe for a 9x13 pan. I subbed the butter for vegetable shortening and added lemon zest from 2-3 lemons to the crust. I cooked it for more than 20 minutes, not sure exactly how much longer but it turned out really good and added the texture I wanted.

I made this pie crust recipe because my son-in-law is gluten-free.  I baked the crust for about 5 minutes and then added traditional pecan pie filling.  I baked as I would for a normal pecan pie.  It was delicious!  The combination of oats and pecans was a winner.  And it's super easy (and you don't have to buy expensive almond or coconut flour to make a gluten-free crust!)  As I recall, I left out the cinnamon and nutmeg because I wasn't sure how well they would work with the pecan filling.

I used this recipe for Magic Bars instead of a graham cracker crust. I would have loved it if it weren't for the cinnamon and nutmeg...it didn't go well for Magic Bars. I would definitely use the recipe as written for other fruit or cream pies.
