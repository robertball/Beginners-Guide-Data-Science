This was a very good base recipe. I used 1/4 tsp chipotle powder instead of red pepper flakes, and browned the chicken with the onions before adding the other ingredients to add to the depth of flavor. I held off on the spinach until the last couple minutes so that it wouldn't get mushy and disintegrate. I used about 2 cups of spinach, and will use even more next time since it cooks down so much. 30 minutes was a little longer than it needed to cook, but I really liked it anyway because some of the sweet potatoes broke down, acting as a thickener for the stew. 

The flavor profile spot on -- savory, sweet, and spicy. And it looked beautiful! Both of my boys cleaned their plates. Will definitely be making this again.

Since ive gone paleo , ive been making this recipe at least once a week. I tweaked it a little by adding a link of smoked sausage, added double the spinach and double the chicken broth and added a cup water. I also mashed the sweet potatoes just a bit so it wasn't so soupy. I could eat this all week.

This was delicious! I, too, am following the Paleo plan, and only SWEET POTATOES are considered Paleo, and should be eaten only occasionally as they are still potatoes, after all. My husband, who is not following Paleo, told me that I could make this as often as I liked because he loved, loved LOVED IT! Thanks for posting this fantastic dish!

First paleo recipe I've tried and I loved it! I will definitely make again; however next time, I'll add the spinach for the last 5-10 minutes of cooking. Putting the spinach in at the same time with the rest of the ingredients causes it to cook down to practically nothing.

I made this soup with all of the ingredients that were called for, but assembled it differently. First I browned the chicken and removed it from the pot, white meat has a tendency to dry out if boiled for too long. Then I added the yams for a few minutes, then the onions, then the garlic. I added in some water to deglaze the pan, then the pepper, paprika and salt. I added enough chicken broth to cover everything, which was probably about 4-6 cups, and let that come to a boil. Reduced to a simmer until the yams were mostly done and added the chicken back in. Once everything was cooked through I added in about 3 cups of spinach right before I ladled it into bowls. Served with Paleo Biscuits, it was hit.

This was really easy and yummy.  First off, sorry to the purists out there who advocate following the recipe exactly the first time, but I did make a few changes.  I am giving 5 stars because I'd never have been able to make my own version without the basic starter recipe.   And my purpose in cooking meals is not to write perfectly accurate reviews, but to feed my family.   So,  that said, here's what I did:   I used some finely chopped celery for flavor with the onions and ginger, because I can't stomach garlic anymore, and also threw in some cumin and curry powder and cooked that a minute to release the flavor before adding the chicken broth.  Added the chicken close to the end, added a can of lite coconut milk, and  finally the spinach last, just because we don't like it cooked to death.  It was wonderful!  I'm so thankful to have a new meal to add into the rotation :)

This was a hit. The flavor was there. I did double everything and added plenty of broth and adjusted the seasoning to taste. This is a keeper.

Flavor is delicious but 30 minutes is way too long for the chicken, it had a rubber texture. Next time wait to add chicken last 10-12 minutes and the spinach last 3 minutes.

Fantastic recipe! I  added a lot more chicken broth than the recipe  stated, enough to cover the chicken and potatoes. Easy to make and we will definitely  make it again.

This is so good! Honestly when I first read the recipe it sounded like it would be a little bland, but I decided to try it since the reviews were so positive. Glad I did. It's delicious and not bland at all. I made it pretty much exactly as written, except that I used quite a bit more chicken broth (probably about 1.5 cups) and also I didn't have red pepper flakes so I added a dash or 2 of cayenne pepper instead.

Absolutely loved this. I'm not following a diet, just trying to eat healthy and count calories, so I used regular potatoes instead of sweet ones. Also substituted Cayenne Pepper for Red Pepper flakes as I let someone borrow my red pepper flakes...
All in all this was very delicious. Next time I would like to double the broth and add celery and/or carrots.

This is a delicious recipe and you can add a variety of things to it . I have made this quite a few times. I added zucchini noodles mushrooms if you don't have fresh spinach you can use frozen still tasty. I have used this recipe and replaced the chicken with turkey or beef.

This is one of my "go-to" recipes. Our kids aren't fans of sweet potatoes, but white potatoes have now been added to the "ok to eat" list on Paleo! If I make it for just my husband and I, I use sweet potatoes, but if it is for the kids I use white potatoes.

A paleo recipe he truly enjoyed and was different!  I added yellow onion as well as small red onion I also added mushroom and some celery. Cooking the same until all was tender. I used all the seasonings to his taste and added original chicken seasoning as well to bring out the chicken a little more! He loved it and that good enough for me!! Easy and quick! Going to be a staple here for certain!

Paleo?  Yes? No?  Who cares.  Sweet potatoes are good for you and tasty.  I tripled the spinach, and added a pinch of thyme and chopped walnuts to the mix.  Excellent.

I am surprised how flavorful This dish is! It's easy and delicious. The only thing I did differently was I sautéed the chicken with the onions and garlic before adding the other ingredients. I also added the spinach about 10 mins before it was done so it wouldn't be too wilted. Next time I would cut the potatoes a little larger since they were small and got a little mushy.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great healthy recipe!  And easy too. Like some others I added some carrots and celery and let it cook a little longer so potatoes could be smashed a bit—makes the soup a bit creamier.

Fantastic, delicious, and healthy!!!  My family loved it.  I used salmon instead of chicken because my hubby's a pescatarian.  I also only cooked it for 20 min, and the potatoes were plenty done.  I added a couple of carrots and some basil and it was really good.  I think you could make this with different additions every time and still end up with a great meal because the base flavor is nice.  I also added a little cornstarch to thicken it up. mmmm

We loved it!  Husband really liked it!  I tripled the recipe. Took leftovers two nights later and shared with women.  One requested the recipe. All liked it and had seconds.  Local store did not have spinach so I substituted fresh collard greens. Yum!

Pretty good, since I didn't have spinach but had a package of kale I was going to use it but totally forgot to add it. I already added broccoli and cauliflower and wanted it to be super veggie stew. Definitely a keeper. One thing that I should have done was brown the meat first then add to the stew.

I was surprised by the amount of flavor in this dish.  As I was cooking, I thought the recipe would e more bland.  We did think that the portion sizes were very small.  Very healthy!

I make this at least every other week. It is filling and such good ingredients. I add a little ginger to spice it up more. Makes a great fall/winter time meal.

I made it. I used boneless thighs because that’s what I had. I added thyme and rosemary to the onions and garlic. I will add bok choy because we can’t eat spinach and I will add it tomorrow when we eat this dish. It tastes great!

Recipe was great and simple. I'm on the Whole30 and wanted a low-maintenance dish. Used vegetable broth (personal preference) and added cajun seasoning for kick. Brought down the house. Will make again.

Easy to make and pretty tasty, I wish I'd have added the spinach a little later so it still had some fresh crunch to it.

Yum! I had no spinach on hand, so I substituted in sugar snap peas, and it turned out great! I prefer my stews soft and mushy, so the texture was perfect for me, but if you're someone who prefers a less mushy stew, perhaps consider reducing the cooking time. Will make again.

Please don't put the spinach in at the beginning. Throw it in at the last few minutes. 
This is really, really good! Even my teenage sons like it (and they are super picky).

I tweaked the seasoning a bit. I added rosemary. I eliminated the crushed red chili flakes and papeika. I added a chicken cube for extra flavor. Super healthy and tasty but it did not come out as stewey  like in the video. It became more soupy.

Very flavorful. Added carrot and celery and used chicken thighs instead of breasts for more flavor. Also followed suggestions and cooked chicken with onion and garlic and added spinach near the end. Great recipe!

Interesting recipe . I thought it was delicious and we try it again . The worst part was peeling the sweet potato. A great combination of sweet potatoes spinach and onion.

I made this dish and my husband loved it!  I substituted better than bullion for the chicken bullion, and used one sweet potato and one yam because that what I had on hand.  Oh, I also used cooked rotisserie chicken and added it at the end.  I'll be making this dish again.

I love this recipe!  Thank you!    For six servings I used two heads of cauliflower instead of the two sweet potatoes.  I also used someone’s suggestion and used 1/4 tsp chipotle chili powder instead of crushed red pepper.  The soup turned out wonderfully!

Great hearty soup.  I did brown the chicken first, and I cooked this is a crock pot for about 3 hours on high.  I also added celery because I did not have spinach on hand.

This was nothing special. I'm not paleo, but I needed to use up some chicken and sweet potatoes I had around and wanted something fairly healthy. The only change I made was using smoked paprika, but it just didn't have much flavor besides sweet potato overall.

It's quick, easy, and tastes great. Extra paprika and crushed red pepper, spinach at the end. Could easily double it and not get sick of eating it.

Feedback from a non-paleo eater--This was pretty good served over brown rice. It was a little sweet for a stew for me. Maybe I will fiddle with the recipe to increase the savoriness. I joyfully ate two bowls of this for dinner tonight, but I will not make it again as written.

I made this recipe using a soy based vegetarian "chick'n" since we are vegetarians. It turned out to be very flavorful and we enjoyed it very much. It was also a way to use up some leftover sweet potatoes. I will make this one again!

My family of five adored this soup, from age 7-13, plus us adults. It was very hearty, wonderful flavor, and it made the house smell super tasty. Am making this again, because it was just amazing.

Very good! Not bland at all, but it wasn't a WOW soup, although it was a very comforting winter food and very healthy on top of it. I will make again, and maybe spice it up a bit more to my liking.

Tasty, healthy and easy to make. I was generous with the paprika and crushed red pepper and also added cumin. I had to add more chicken broth as it cooked to keep it from drying out. I didn't add the spinach in until the last 5 minutes.

Made it just as written, except I thickened it a tad at the end (cornstarch mixed into water) for our liking.  It was totally devoured, with our adult children eating the leftovers out of our fridge and also rubbing their tummies!  So good, so good for you!

This was good, but I added about a cup of coconut milk and a few dashes of curry powder and it made it much better. Yum.

Great soup!  I did a double batch,  took it easy on the red pepper and added ginger.  Then I pureed 1/4 of the mixture.  I used more broth than the recipe called for and I agree with other reviews - next time I'll add the spinach closer to the end. 
I simmered exactly 30 minutes.  Next time I think I would go 25 minutes.  
It's amazing! This recipe will definitely go in my regular rotation.

This was so good as is, but it also gave me an idea to do it with garam masala spices to have an Indian flair or chili powder and cumin for a texmex vibe.

Delicious! I used chipotle pepper in place of the red pepper flakes (approx. 1/3 tsp.), and added 1/2 tsp. of savory. I, too, added the spinach during the last 3-4 minutes of cook time. Hubby and I both loved this. Thanks for sharing!

It is difficult for me to find meals that the whole family likes from my paleo preferring husband to the kids to my vegetarian preferences. This one was well loved by all, with most going for seconds. 
I would cook the sweet potato a little less next time (my fault for not watching). It also reheated well. 
Highly recommended!

It wasn't too bad.  I may add a tad more garlic next time to give it a bit more flavor.  Perhaps a little chicken sausage as suggested. Certainly hearty and filling. I'll make this again.

I modified the recipe a bit to make it more flavorful.  Added 1 tsp of cinnamon and allspice and 2 tsp of ground cumin.  Also added about a tablespoon, maybe a little more, of fish sauce to give it a more savory flavor.  Will definitely be making this again.

very good and simple to make. Also very healthy, I didn't feel bad getting a little more :) It seems easy to substitute based on likes and dislikes as well.

My 8 and 10 year old children loved this recipe. I didn't have the red pepper flakes so I used a pinch of cayenne instead. It was a little too hot for their taste so next time I will omit that!

Wow this is delicious for such a simple recipe!  I think I will double it next time, though.
