I never thought of frying tomato paste before, and was a bit hesitant to try this time, but I'm glad I did. The aroma is amazing! I used Chianti (my favorite red), and added green bell pepper as well as red. The pan turned black as I was sauteeing the peppers and onions, but as soon as I added the wine, the drippings lifted and the flavors blended beautifully.

This dish is hearty and robust--ideal for those cold winter evenings!

Addendum: I made this recipe with a butterflied pork tenderloin. I didn't have tomato paste, so I chopped up some sun-dried tomatoes to substitute. It made for a milder dish and it really complemented the red peppers and onion quite well. A nice variation, for sure.

Great easy recipe. The family loved it. This will be a staple recipe from now on. Pork chops were so tender and tasty. Everyone wanted seconds.
