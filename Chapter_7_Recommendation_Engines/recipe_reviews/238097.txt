I loved it! I used a little butter too and put the oven to 375 for 45 minutes. It was perfect! I did make sure to cut the steaks at 1 inch so they would cook quicker. Definitely a do over!

Pretty good! I took opted for 375 and "steaks" cut closer to 1/2" than a full 1". I had a tasty side in about 40 mins. I enjoyed mine with some shredded parm thrown on for the last 5 minutes of the cooking time.

It tookrme 3 hours lin the oven, set at 350 to get rid of the crunch. Used a lot of minced garlic, soy sauce and it was good. I will stick to frying mine in the cast iron skillet, though.

Love this idea.  Would have given 5 stars but, the 1" steaks are too thick.  I cut mine to 1/2" and added more spices.  Thanks for the recipe.  My wife and I make our own flavors and compare,

This was a delicious surprise!  I cut them a little thinner than an inch and cooked at 375 degrees for 40-45 minutes.  A definite repeat in my house!

I've made this recipe and it's really good.  I think the only addition I had was to grate some Parmesan cheese over it at the end.  Really tasty and a nice side dish to just about anything!

Pretty tasty stuff.  I followed the instructions exactly then topped my steak with some ahi which had marinated in sesame oil and soy sauce, gave it a squirt of lime, and it made a delicious and very filling lunch.

After baking for 45 minutes covered, then another 30 uncovered when they still felt raw, I just gave up and tried to eat one.  They were okay, but I suppose I wasn't ready for them to still taste practically raw.

Great recipe.  Depending on the thickness of the"steak" you may not need the entire cooking time.  Yummy and healthy - a delightful addition to a low carb diet!

I followed some suggestions and sprayed with olive oil, lots of minced garlic, then I used a brown sugar bourbon seasoning by McCormick and sprinkled with bacon pieces. Baked at 425 for 40 minutes. Delicious and a big hit with my dinner guests.

I was looking for a simple recipe to use up a whole head of cabbage that I didn't want to go to waste in the back of the fridge and this was amazing. I couldn't believe how wonderful this tasted. I'm definitely making this again.

You know longer have to use a boiling pot with smoked meat to make a decent cabbage dish.  It's very juicy and flavorful.  I did leave it in longer to give it a little char which I liked a lot.   Easy, healthy, and scrumptious!

This is a pretty easy meal to make but it does take about an hour to cook.  Our family loves cabbage and a little Parmesan Cheese and Sriracha sauce turns this into an awesome meal.

Not my cup of tea.  Will try again, but will play with it when I do.  I expected charred slightly and soft.  Was not that.  I maybe must come to terms with the possibility that  I have grown old eating very overcooked cabbage and liking it.  LOL thanks anyhow.

Tasty, but it must be cooked longer than the 45 minutes to soften the cabbage. I ended up cutting into smaller pieces and baking in the juices till it was tender. Will defenitely try again, but not in steaks.

So simple and so tasty! Replaced oil with 1 tablespoon butter and added garlic seasoning. Cut thinner to 1/2 inch slices and was good to go in 35 min. Loved the charred edges. Great side dish!

This took the spotlight away from the main dish! Who would have known? I omitted the salt, and sprinkled turkey bacon bits on top and cooked at 375 for 35-40 mins.  AMAZING, heated up in the microwave well also!

I actually had a large head of cabbage to use and decided on having this for lunch.  It was alright.  I baked at 400 degrees after rubbing a cut clove of garlic on the both sides of each slice.  A light brush of EVOO and fresh ground pepper and into the oven for one hour.  I allowed it to sit a couple minutes and then a sprinkling of salt to taste and a tad Balsamic Vinegar.
Voila!
Has to be fewer calories and certainly a simple, quick and satisfying dish.

When I tried to cut my cabbage into steaks it mostly fell apart into chunks, so I just chunked it all.  I followed the recipe for ingredients and put the chopped cabbage on a shallow pan and roasted it for 20 minutes uncovered. Came out great.

I will make this dish again. I didn't make any changes except I did have a small head of cabbage and I cut the steaks into smaller slices.  It could have been less than a half inch. The cabbage was so small that it cooked a lot faster in just 25-minutes. I will try this again for my grand children and see what they think.

I sliced mine about 1/2” . I followed the recipe except in regards to flavoring but in addition I also drizzled about a Tb total for 3 steaks I made on top of them as well as a little of seasoning called “Everything Bagel” I cooked them for 30 min. & the last 5 min I sprinkled w/ fresh Parmesan & cooked uncovered. These were so surprisingly good!

1. Quick Excellent. Sprayed the glass baking pan with avocado baking spray, sliced about 1/2” and brushed on the olive oil. Sprinkled garlic powder, salt and pepper. Was good, the kids and husband liked it too!

Cut them about a half inch thick, 375 degrees, 45 minutes. Wow this is a great recipe. I am terrible at roasting vegetables and these turned out great. tender in the middle and crispy on the outside. I will make this again.

Loved these! I had too cook them about 20 minutes longer than the recipe says, though. I put a bit of butter on each steak, and cut the oil down to account for that. Will be making these again!

This was ok.  I felt that the flavor of the seasoning was lost, I couldn't taste the seasoning even though I put on way more than the recipe called for.   I cooked them 10 minutes longer than the recipe said.  They didn't seem to be cooked all the way.  I don't know maybe I cut them too thick.  I really wanted to like this recipe because it was so easy.  I will make it again but I will need to make some changes.  Not sure what yet.

Delicious side dish and super easy! I only had leftover chopped cabbage so I mixed all the ingredients together and baked it that way. It was really tasty!  Thank you!

I thought this was very good and easy, and I'm happy to know how to do it for when I have the oven on for something else. I only did one tonight in a pie pan in a small convection oven as I wasn't sure that I would like it, and that's all the room I had. It did take the listed 45 minutes so I should have done all of them in the big oven to be more efficient as I am sure they'd reheat well. I can do the rest of them tomorrow.
