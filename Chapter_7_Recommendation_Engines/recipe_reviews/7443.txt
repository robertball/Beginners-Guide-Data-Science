This is close to my own recipe but I've always used all butter. I was never quite happy with the results because the frosting was always a bit too sweet for me. Following Rick's recipe, but using half salted butter & half regular Crisco, 6 cups of confectioners sugar, about 4 to 5 ounces of heavy whipping cream and 2 teaspoons of pure Vanilla, I found the PERFECT BLEND. Great spreading consistency and just sweet enough. The Crisco seems to cut the sweetness, while giving the frosting a bit more stability, which is great if you're going to use it for piping borders around a cake or making rosettes and leaves on top. Be sure to beat the frosting with an electric mixer on high speed, a minimum of 10 minutes, or until nice and fluffy. Had enough to GENEROUSLY frost 24 cupcakes, with about 2 cups left over. Canâ€˜t believe using Crisco would make all the difference. Thanks Rick!  *UPDATE 1: The whipping cream is a MUST! I forgot to buy whipping cream and used milk instead, big mistake... the frosting wasn't as fluffy and creamy. *UPDATE 2: I wanted a peanut butter frosting for a Reese's chocolate cake I was making, so I added in 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter with the Crisco and butter. Turned out great, with just enough of a peanut butter taste to do the trick.

Truly an exceptional frosting, especially when butter is substituted for half of the shortening. Not too sweet, with a fluffy, creamy texture. There are infinite possibilites for a variety of flavorings and add-ins. It was a generous amount to fill and frost a 3 layer 9-inch cake. A real keeper and will be used over and over!

Awesome butterceam frosting! I used half butter and half butter flavored shortening. I also used half the amount of cream and as other's have stated, add it until you get the desired consistency. You can definitley play with this one. I added 1/4 cup of real maple syrup for a maple buttercream and used it to frost cupcakes made from "Nutmeg Feather Cake" from this site.

This was great.  I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 crisco and about 6 cups of sugar (and still wasn't too sweet).  This frosting has an incredibly smooth spreading consistancy, yet is strong enough to hold a shape if piped as border/edging.  It makes a ton, too.  I frosted and decorated a 4 layer 8-inch cake and still had about 1-1/2 cups leftover.  THIS IS MY NEW FROSTING OF CHOICE!!

Fantastic buttercream frosting, I do however use butter in place of shortening to keep from getting the greasy feel you get.  Super YUM! Make sure you whip the butter adequately to get it aerated enough before you add the sugar so its super fluffy.

I have been on a search for the ultimate decorator icing and this is it (I've tried dozens)!  This icing is wonderful!!  I even used it for roses and figure piping (clowns) without a problem.  It is much less sweet than many of the buttercreams.
Note:  I used half Crisco and half butter for the shortening.

This recipe is similar to the SPECIAL BUTTERCREAM FROSTING RECIPE also submitted by Rick (slightly diff. recipe with cream) - This is a GREAT RECIPE however I STRONGLY recommend using half unsalted butter for half the shortening and only 5 cups sifted powdered sugar (otherwise it would be much too sweet).  I also used real vanilla powder (less color than extract).  With 6oz heavy cream instead of the milk, it becomes a terrificly rich, light and fluffy frosting that spreads beautifully.  You could beat in slightly more sugar to part of the finished frosting if you want to use it to pipe roses (but don't use that much sugar to cover the whole cake).

Excellent.  I made it for a train cake  for my son's birthday, it frosted and decorated 2 cake mixes with a little left over.  Will definitely make again.  I did use half butter, half shortening.  I loved another reviewer's tip to beat the shortening/butter on high for 10 minutes before adding sugar.  It makes the frosting so light and not greasy.  Also, I have used 2% milk instead of the cream with equally delicious results.   3/2/08 Update: This is the standard birthday cake frosting for our family.  Everyone who has tried it says it's the best frosting!

This was the recipe I was looking for!  I used
1 1/2 C. butter to 1/2 cup shortening and one large bag of confectioners sugar (6 cups).  It was perfect for decorating with and never got too soft. Plus it tastes great.  I'll always use it when I'm decorating a cake!

I'll be a dissenting voice and say, as written, this frosting is NOT great.  Nearly all of the most helpful reviews (all 5-star reviews too) had significant changes made, most importantly incorporating butter. I wanted to make this as written the first time, and while it's not the worst thing I've ever tasted or anything, it's certainly not amazing. The reviews ARE helpful, but the recipe as is is just okay to me.

I've tried so many and this one beats them all.  As a fresh variation, I substitute fresh strained orange juice for 1/2 the cream and add 1 tsp grated orange rind--it's delicious!  Add cream with care--it can become too mushy for proper cake decorating if you use it all.  Subtract 1-2 Tbsp and it'll be fine.

Thank you so much Rick!  I have been looking for the perfect frosting recipe for years!  When I was little my mom used to buy these incredible birthday cakes from the bakery - the icing was the best part, and this is it!!  It is perfect for decorating as well!  Upon advice from the other reviewers I used:  1 cup shortening and 1 cup butter (unsalted); I also only used 5 cups of the icing sugar and about 3/4 cup whipping cream.  I know, I know, modifications..... but it turned out wonderfully - highly recommmended for bakery quality!

I love this recipe and use it a lot! I always use shortening instead of butter in my buttercream frostings as it keeps the frosting white instead of that buttery yellow hue. It holds up well for piping and floral work as well as borders. I still use the basic Wilton recipe for some cakes, but this frosting is fast becoming a favorite! I'd also like to mention that for those who are looking for flavoring ideas... we all know there are flavorings available in the cake aisle, but for recipes like this you can also use coffee creamers for "gourmet" flavorings. Just sub some of your heavy cream with coffee creamer and whip away. I also wanted to mention that for those who comment about frosting recipes being too sweet... that is why salt is added to the recipe. Salt cuts the sweetness from the frosting so that you are not sickened by all the sugar. I've never been a big frosting fan and have always scraped the frosting off of cakes before I'll eat them, but if salt is added to the recipe it is yummy!!

HELPFUL TIPS: The first reviewer helped this good recipe become perfect.  My family HATESSS icing so for them to say oh my god ...heavenly ....says a lot.  I did 6 c sugar, 2t vanilla, and probably used more like 3/4c heavy cream WITH the recommended 10 min. beating time.  You never know what you're missing until you taste this BEFORE the 10 minute mix ...and then AFTER.  I gained 5 lbs just from licking the dang stuff.  Seriously...  (oh and one more thing. this already has a very apparent butter taste to it.  greasy definitely would define ALL shortening.  do half shortening, half salted butter)

First of all, I halved the recipe (sounded like it made tons)  Halved it was even way more than enough for my daughter's birthday cake (2-9x13 cakes)  Secondly, I used 1/2 butter-1/2shortening.  I've never made a 'buttercream' frosting before, but have always loved the taste.  Not having a previous recipe to compare to, I do not plan on looking for one; this one was perfect.  My mom-in-law was BLOWN AWAY by the frosting.  She couldn't quit asking about it.  The day before the party, when I was decorating the cake (a large guitar-shaped cake) it was extremely easy to spread but I was worried about it 'holding up' or not firming up.  I was concerned that it would be too fluffy, like a cool whip cake.  I refrigerated the cake, uncovered, for the next day & it was a great presentation.  Like I said, I am a first-timer, I don't know if it should've been covered but think that if i did, it would've messed up the design.  I just took the cake out 30-mins before serving to 'soften' it up again...PERFECT!! I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE SATISIFIED OVER FROSTING!

This was a great recipe!  I did tweak it a little bit for my family's taste ... I used one and a half cups of butter and a half cup of Crisco to avoid the "greasy" feeling in the frosting.  I used the entire 8 ounces of heavy cream but only 32 ounces of Domino confectioner's sugar - equal to about 7 and a half cups instead of the 8 cups the recipe called for.  The sweetness was still very good! My icing was very light and airy- I attribute that to my KitchenAid mixer and really beating the frosting awhile!  I beat it for probably 10-12 minutes in the butter and shortening stage and then another 10-12 minutes with all the ingredients added.  It may sound a bit extreme but that extra time really makes it light and airy.  Mmmmm!  :)  I've also added a bit of cocoa powder to the recipe for chocolate frosting, and it's heavenly!

EXACTLY the buttercream recipe I have been trying to find for years.  Instead of 2 cups shortening I did 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of shortening.  I also only did about 6 oz of the heavy whipping cream.  I only added about 7 cups of the conf sugar as well.  Although 8 cups would have been good too.  I also threw in a dash of salt as salt makes it a littel sweeter, a weird but true fact I learned in cake decorating class.  Had a great consistency for decorating.  i will use this recipe again and again

I was very nervous, but I made the frosting for a cake I made for my daughters' baby shower. It got very good reviews from everyone, and a couple asked for the recipe. I did change the recipe a little bit. I used 1/2 cup shortening, and a 1/2 unsalted butter, and I put a 1 teas of vanilla (clear) and a 1 teas of butter flavoring. Here are a few of my thoughts on the frosting. Don't make any adjustments until it has been in your mixer for at least 10-15 minutes. At first I thought it tasted like shortening and was grainy, but that went away. Then I thought it tasted salty, and that went away also. After being in the mixer for a long time, all the flavors came together and it tasted wonderful. The next day it tasted even better. I couldn't quit eating it. It's like the flavors needed to "cure" for a day to taste the best.

LOVE this frosting! I had to sub half the shortening with butter. I used to frost cupcakes.  I liked the frosting even better after it was in the fridge.  Will definitely use again.

Outstanding frosting! Like a lot of other reviewers, I subbed half of the shortening with butter (real, unsalted). I made half a recipe, which was enough to frost 24 cupcakes. I used it to frost the Sweetheart Cupcakes from this site, so I added some red coloring to make it pink and added 1 tsp. raspberry flavoring. It was so easy to pipe and I was happy because the sprinkles actually stuck to the frosting!

I was wary about trying this because of the shortening, but then I found organic, trans fat free palm oil shortening at Whole Foods.  The texture is grainy, but because the "grains" melt at body heat, you can gently melt it smooth and cool it back to a hard state to get rid of the grains.  It's an unfortunate extra step, I know, but I just can't stomach the thought of eating all that partially hydrogenated oil in regular shortening.

This recipe should be named "Rick's SUPREME Buttercream Frosting! It is the best tasting, lightest, fluffiest buttercream frosting I have ever eaten. The key to success with this recipe is to let it mix for a minimum of ten minutes. I used half butter/shortening, and 3/4 cup cream and got exactly the texture, taste, and consistency I was wanting. Try this, you won't regret it.

This buttercream frosting is indeed exceptional.  I have a small cupcake business on the side and have tried so many buttercream recipes that I've lost track.  My search for the best buttercream frosting ended with this one.  It is my go to frosting and my customers absolutely love it.  I get rave reviews for it all the time.  The only thing I do differently is substitute salted butter for the shortening, eliminate the salt and I find 6 ounces heavy whipping cream is perfect for my taste.  This frosting pipes like a dream.  I cant say enough good things about it.  Thank you Rick.

Rick, YOU GO BOY! I have tried soooo many buttercream recipes & they all turn out bad. But this one is excellent! (I used 5 cups of sugar instead of 8, going off of the advice from other reviewers)I used this icing for a baby shower cake & I recieved tons of compliments. For everyone else checking out recipes for frosting, This is the one.

Texture was great, but the taste was icky.  Way too heavy and greasy, even using half butter and half shortening.

Very good frosting. I did use all butter because I was out of shortening. Even though I used unsalted butter my frosting came out a little salty so next time I will cut out the salt. Will definitely be making this frosting again. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this last night minus the shortening(I didn't have any) and used all butter. This was SO easy and the flavor was incredible!! I flavored mine with a little bit of Mrs. Butterworths to make breakfast cupcakes(pancake cupcakes) and put some fruit on top.This icing is my favorite, I will never use anything else! Thanks Rick!!

8 cup's sugar? This must be a joke. I tried this frosting and came up to 3 cups and it was getting way too sweet. I substituted 1 cup butter to get a more buttery taste. it worked great for frosting a smooth cake. easy to decorate too. but way too much sugar. If you do cut the sugar, you have to cut the salt as well. a pinch is enough

I wish I would have made this with either butter or the butter flavored crisco. I never use crisco in baking, only because that's all I can taste in whatever I made. Other people really liked this frosting the way it is, so I would probably make it again just with the butter. Also, I made a half batch and was able to generously frost 36 cupcakes. It makes a lot!!

I used half butter and a mixture of clear vanilla and lemon extracts, which maintained the white color, yet lent a more complex, less cloying flavor. Perfect for decorating. Be very sparing when you add the cream, as you can then stop when it comes to the thickness you want. If you're piping, you'll want to use less liquid. My Westies turned out so cute. Be aware that if you're piping for a long time, the heat from your hand might make it too soft. In that case, 5 minutes or so in the fridge will bring it right back. Great for decorating and delicious!

Very nice. I was a little put off by the cream aftertaste that I had in my mouth when I first made it, but I put it into the fridge overnight and the next day all the flavors blended together. I used 1 cup crisco and 1 cup butter...then 6 cups of icing sugar. It was a little sweet, but I just added a pinch of salt to it while mixing and it balanced it out. Very nice and firm enough for piping. This was very good.

Only made half a recipe and frosted 24 cupcakes and still had almost 2 cups of frosting left. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored Crisco. Also melted 1/2 cup of chocolate morsels and added to make chocolate frosting. A little on the sweet side but was smooth and creamy.

I don't like those frostings that have an overwhelmingly "powdered sugar-y" flavor.  I made the recipe with the only substitution of 1/2 butter, 1/2 Crisco, and used all 8 oz heavy cream.  I used all 8 cups powdered sugar, and I probably shouldn't have.  I made half chocolate by adding 1/2 cup cocoa powder, and I liked that version better.  The cocoa powder reduced the "powdered sugar" flavor for me.  Next time, I'll make a half-recipe (this made a LOT!) and use less powdered sugar.  But I will try it again!

This is really tasty. It is even better if you add 1-
1 1/2 teaspoons pure almond extract! (Keep the vanilla extract, too, if you like!)

This turned out just like I wanted it to.  I, like many other reviewers, used half shortening and half butter.  I also added unsweetened cocoa as I was adding the confectioners sugar to create a chocolate flavor - I probably ended up adding about 6 heaping spoonfuls.  I didn't wait to add the heavy cream after all the sugar was added. I alternated between about a cup of sugar (which I only added about a third of a cup at a time), and then added some heavy cream, and so on, until I achieved the consistency, sweetness, and chocolate flavor I was trying for.  I ended up using almost all of the cup of heavy cream.  I felt like this gave me more control over the finished product. I chilled it down for about 45 minutes before I put I put it into a pastry bag and piped it onto some cupcakes I made using the "Black Magic Cake" recipe from this site.  I must say that even the cake batter for those smelled good before they even went into the oven!  The Frosting held it's shape very well using a star tip. I added some sprinkles to a few of them, and they held really well in the frosting.  I can't wait to try them later...

I have finally found my perfect BASE frosting recipe!!!  Thank you Rick!  :). I modified this to be a vanilla bean frosting by grating 1/2 bourbon-soaked vanilla bean, 2 full tsp of pure vanilla, organic cream (makes a flavor difference), and 1/2 c butter with the rest butter-flavored Crisco when I made an 8 serving batch.  It was AWESOME!  This is the first buttercream frosting I've found that is not too buttery or greasy.  Can't wait to try it with cocoa, irish cream or kahlua!

This frosting has an ok taste.....used to frost a wedding cake yesterday and it never crusted enough to smooth out the cake.  It is ok for borders and makes a fantastic black (2 cups frosting, 1 oz. black coloring and 1/4 cup powdered chocolate).  Just didn't have that wow factor I was looking for in a frosting

Great frosting! I gave this recipe 4 stars because I made some changes. First, I used 1/2 crisco and 1/2 butter. I also beat the shortening/butter for 10 minutes before adding the sugar.
I was overwhelmed with how much frosting this actually made. WAY more than I needed for my cookies.

This was a very good recipe.  I halved the recipe.  I didn't have clear vanilla, so I used rum extract (which was clear), then added a little more cream until it was "pipeable".  I'll definitely be using this again!

Honestly...I did not care for this recipe. I'm sorry but shortening just DOES NOT belong in frosting. I feel like it ruined my cake that I spent a whole week preparing, and I am so dissapointed. I learned a valuble lesson though. NEVER put shortening in frosting. I gave it a star because it does do well for decorating...

I was so disappointed with this recipe, but I didn't have any more powdered sugar to make a different frosting! Call me a purist, but isn't there "butter" in "buttercream frosting"? Too bad I didn't read the reviews beforehand, or I would have used half butter.

The texture and ease of this recipe is great, but I just can't get past the taste of the shortening. I will use this when I need really white icing for small bits of decor, but otherwise I will have to find another recipe that mainly uses butter. I also found this way too sweet for my tastes (and that says a lot, since I have a sweet tooth).

I do use butter instead of shortening though (I'm not a huge fan of shortening in buttercream icing), which will cause it to not be a perfect white. Since I'm almost always coloring it anyway, nor do I mind if it's off white instead of white, this isn't a big deal to me. But it is extremely good made with butter. You can probably cut down a bit on the sugar, as it's really, really sweet when the full amount is used. Basically, I add enough to get a good texture and consistency , and then add more until I get what tastes just right to me. It also firms up really well in the fridge if you need it to be firmer. But again, this is really, really good with butter, and I would recommend using butter to make it instead of shortening.

Tasted mainly like shortening... oily and flavorless. Did not have the melt in your mouth sweetness that I look for in buttercream.

This spreads beautifully & is just right for piping decorations.   It's much easier to use than the recipe that comes with the shaped pans.  It maintains it's perfect piping consistency... and it tastes great!

Best recipe for icing I have found..nothing weird in it, basic ingredients whip together for a creamy delicious icing!  I did add 1 teaspoon of butter flavoring.This made it superb.

This is the best buttercream I have ever made! Every time I try a new recipe for buttercream all I can taste is butter.  This was excellent! I did take some advise from other reviewers... I did half shortening and half unsalted butter, always add extra vanilla to everything, and once all of the ingredients were mixed I turned the mixer on med/high and walked away for a few minutes.  It was delicious! My husband even loved it as well as two of our close friends.  This will be my go to buttercream!

This rating is actually for the customized version of this recipe- use "Dorothy's Special Buttercream Frosting"!!! It's just a variation of this one and it tastes wonderful and is perfect for piping without being too greasy.

For as many times as I've made this recipe, I can't believe I've never reviewed it til now. It's perfect. I do use a little less than half butter for some of the shortening, but that's it. Great icing to stand up to piping and firm enough to crust slightly.

Finally I found a recipe that's not too sweet, not too buttery but just right. I've been looking for a vanilla buttercream frosting forever. This is it!  I substituted the shortening for 1 1/2 sticks of butter, and 1/4 cup of shortening (makes it a little fluffy and less buttery and greasy). I will use this frosting forever!  THANKS.

I used 1 1/2 cups butter and 1/2 cup shortening.  I actually really loved the consistency and how it set up.  It was really quite easy to work with and had a lovely sheen.  It looked fantastic once it dried, too.  It was a bit sweeter than I was hoping for, but everyone else liked the frosting.  I added a little orange and almond extracts in addition to the vanilla, and also substituted about half of the cream with orange juice.  I wish there was a way to cut back on all the powdered sugar, but overall a really good recipe.

I can't understand why this recipe has such rave reviews. I made it exactly as directed and it tasted like nothing but a mouthful of shortening. I even added more flavouring and a little more sugar and cream, and still it was inedible. I notice that some of the people who gave it a great rating also say they changed to shortening to butter. Maybe it would be better in that case. I

This is actually Wilton's Extra Special Buttercream Icing.  I made this recipe to decorate a cake, and then found it on Wilton's site, where the exact recipe is listed, also stating that it has to be refrigerated always.  That ended up being such a bummer, because I didn't want a frosting that required refrigeration.  I followed others advice and used 5 cups of sugar instead of 8--it was definitely a lot better than when I made it the first time, because I hate frosting that is sickly sweet.  This was easy to decorate with, but since it's the type that needs refrigeration I won't be making it again.

I used half butter and half shortening. Came out absolutely perfect! Sets up nicely on the cake and cupcakes. Perfect for piping decorations, including roses! I usually use the wedding cake icing from this site, which is very comparable to this one in taste and texture. Love them both! Thanks so much for this perfect recipe!

MMMMMMMMMMMMM!  This is my new GO TO recipe for frosting.  Great taste..great spreading consistency..the only problem is that you will be left with a spoon hovered over the bowl telling yourself..just one more spoonful.
I did use half butter half crisco for my taste preference and it was perfect.  Will make again and again.

I used 1 cup butter (salted) & 1 cup shortening.  I also sub half & half for the cream & the results are wonderful.I used 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract which tastes more like a classic cake decorating frosting. Smooth & fluffy with a great mouth feel.  Love this recipe!

On a scale from one to ten, this frosting is a twenty-four!  I have tried countless frosting recipes and have never been really happy with them.  However, this frosting I ended up eating with a spoon, literally!  I have NEVER posted to ANY blog, but Rick deserves my time & comments!  Thank you so much!  Now, could you give me a PERFECT cake recipe to go with it!

This frosting was amazing.  I used it for my daughter's second birthday cake (pictures posted) and it worked out amazingly.  I kept the 8 cups of confectioners sugar, and split the 2 cups of crisco to one cup crisco with one cup unsalted butter (two sticks).  It turned out A-MA-ZING.  I will never use anything different!  Thank you for making this cake a success for me!

I made this frosting because I couldn't find the recipe I usually use.  It got such good reviews so I was very optimistic.  I don't know if I did something wrong, but the taste was very blahhh.  My kids liked it though, but it did not suit me.  The consistency was perfect though.  It spread very nice on my sugar cookies.

This is a very special recipe...delicious! I used half butter, half shortening as others suggested.  Easily makes enough to cover a layer cake made with two 9 inch round pans.

Best fluffy buttercream frosting ever. I also did the 1/2 butter flavored shortening, 1/2 butter thing, and a bit less sugar, but the KEY to making it fabulous is ALMOND flavoring! It makes it so good!

EXCELLENT buttercream frosting recipe! Hard to understand why anyone wouldn't rate this recipe a 5 star! I've tried many buttercream frosting recipes, but this one tops them all! Taste is smooth, creamy & buttery... spreads easily! Thanks for sharing with us, Rick!
edited to add: Just to clarify: I did use real butter. At my age, I remember when the term shortening was interchangeable with butter. When a recipe calls for shortening, butter is nearly always my substitute of choice, without even giving it a 2nd. thought.

I used 1c. butter, 1/2c. butter flavored crisco and 1/2c. regular crisco and it was excellent!  This is the recipe I have been looking for!  Tastes like Hy-Vee bakery frosting.

Wow!  This frosting was so good.  I am a skimp when it comes to sugar in the frosting because I don't like it too sweet.  I love how this recipe allowed for that flexibility and was still tasty.  I am trying this on my Christmas cookies this year.

This is the perfect buttercream frosting for me! I've used this several times and I love it! I don't use all the heavy cream, about 3/4 of what the recipe requires and I'm good. Perfect consistency every time.

Great recipe, I used a stand mixer, used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening, and I also added about 3 Tbsp. cocoa powder to make chocolate frosting. (Made 1/2 the recipe)  It went over well on my dark chocolate cupcakes - I will defnitely be keeping this recipe and using it again!  Edited to add... Each time I made this (chocolate version), I kept adding more cocoa powder - it's really great if you add 1 cup for dark chocolate frosting!

I tried the recipe as is first, and found that it was really greasy tasting.  I took advice from reviews and used one cup of shortening and one cup of butter, and it was the most delicious buttercream I ever tasted!  I did only end up using 3/4 cup of heavy cream and it was enough.  I also want to add that it helps if you sift in half the sugar, fold it in, and then use the mixer, and then do the same with the other half of the sugar.  Otherwise, the sugar ends up as a cloud in the kitchen.

Used this frosting on a graduation cake I made for my nephew.  Very delicious!  I have also made it using vanilla flavored coffee creamer rather than cream.  It was very vanilla-y.  Perfect recipe- thank you

This frosting is just heaven.  I don't know what else to say.  I made a half batch and also used half butter as suggested by others. Other than that I followed directions exactly.  Half batch made enough to thickly cover a 9x13 cake.  It is also very rich in my opinion so if you don't like that you may need to adjust accordingly.  But I will definately be using this from now on.  Thank you Rick!!!

This is one fantastic frosting recipe! After reading some of the other reviews I made the following changes: 1 1/2 cups (salted) butter, 1/2 cup shortening; 1 box powdered sugar, and 5 ounces whipping cream. Be sure to omit salt in the recipe as the butter is salty enough and whip for at least 10 minutes before adding sugar, vanilla & cream, then whip for 5 minutes more. Light and not at all greasy tasting!

I have to compliment this recipe I used it for a strawberry shortcake cake I made for the 4th of July party i was going to and I needed something more stable than regular whipped cream frosting and something that would not overwhelm the simplicity of a strawberry shortcake cake, I did just add the sugar to taste  as I went and I used a little more than a cup of whipping cream but the flavor and texture where perfect , It held up for decorating and frosting went on so smooth and flawlessly, I recieved compliments all night long on this cake , This recipe is definatly a keeper!!!

This frosting is awesome!!  I also use half butter and it turns out wonderfully!  Never disappoints!  If you want white frosting, I would suggest using clear vanilla extract.  If it is not with the spices, check with the Wilton cake things!

Delicious! Easy to make, easy to spread, easy to color, and dries very nicely. I made a double batch for my best friend's Bridal Shower that I both catered and hosted. She wanted to have cupcake decorating, so I made this frosting with a variety of colors and everyone thought it was delicious. I only used about 3/4 of the powdered sugar, though.. because when I tested it, I found it to be a bit too sweet. Thanks Rick! Great recipe!

I used Jocelyn's advice and used 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening and the amounts of cream and powdered sugar and it wouldn't whip up.  Perhaps I whipped it too much since I creamed the butter and shortening for about 10 minutes and then whipped everything for about 10 minutes.  I ended up having to add additional powdered sugar in order to get it to a consistency that would hold.  At that point, it wasn't smooth like I would've liked it to have been.  I used almond extract rather than vanilla.  It tasted good, and made decent shells but was just not smooth looking.

I used half butter and half shortening.  I beat the butter and shortening for 10 minutes on the recommendation for other reviewers here.  The taste of the icing was good, but it was too loose.  Even when I added extra powdered sugar to try to stiffen it up, the frosting was just too loose.  I feel like beating the butter and shortening for so long is what was causing the looseness of the frosting.

I would rate this recipe as stated 5 stars for texture, and 1 for flavor.  I followed the recipe as stated and I was not impressed with the flavor.  It didn't have much flavor, despite the vanilla and large quanties of sugar.  I made the recipe again using butter flavored shortening.  It wan't any better.  The butter flavor was present, but I didn't care for it.  I could taste the salt in both recipes.  It was a little mind boggling how so much sugar could result in so little flavor and yet so little salt could be tasted.  The Wilton buttercream recipe found for free on their website is the one my husband and I both prefer.

This frosting did work nicely as far as frosting a cake BUT, I was not impressed with the flavor, or should I say, lack there of!  I did get a lot of compliments on it but I probably will not use it again.

This frosting has a great consistency to work with.  It also stores well in the refrigerator for a couple of weeks.  Leftover icing is wonderful on graham crackers - just like mom made them when I was a kid!  Thanks Rick for a delicious recipe.

WOW!!!!!  This recipe is OUTSTANDING! I followed it to the "T" just the way Rick posted it!!   I always made the Wilton "decorating class buttercream" I never fell completely in love with it, because it was waaay to sweet to the point we would sometimes scrape it off our cakes/cupcakes, but this one is amazing, the sweetness level is perfect,  it spreads easy, and it is very easy to make.  (the only thing is that is too thin for  flowers and stuff, I don't think it would be good for such decorations, maybe if you put a little less heavy cream so is not as "thin" - I will try that and will let you know) {That's just my opinion, maybe it works for flowers just the way it is, I just got the impression that it probably wouldn't.}  This recipe is a keeper, thanks Rick!!! :)

Great butter cream recipe - especially if you're uncomfortable using raw egg.  
Update-  this is my go to recipe.  I make  cupcake cakes  & they always rave about the frosting!  Tip I can give-  use a stand mixer & whip for AT LEAST 5 minutes!

I love this recipe this is the second time Ive made it, the first was for the super bowl party ...an ice your own cupcake bar....and everyone raved going back for 3rds and fourths. I used half butter half butter flavored shortening and next time I think i will take the salt and mull it first. I think the salt grains were a little to big and didnt blend to well but not a biggie, I also instead of using 8 cups of sugar used 4-4.5 cups. It will always be my go to frosting recipe ^_^

It was pretty good. I'm not really a fan of the taste of buttercream in general but it is great for decorating which is what I needed it for.  It was perfect for decorating. Perfectly stiff and held the shape wonderfully. I took the advise of others and did half butter and half crisco but I still felt like I could kind of taste the crisco in it. Next time, I will use half butter and half butter flavored crisco. All in all a good recipe. :)

mmmmmmm yummy!  
Half butter/half shortening makes the best combination for taste and texture in my opinion.
1M Cupcake Swirl people- you will need this full recipe to swirl on a boxed mix worth of cupcakes.

This frosting was delicious and went over extremely well!  I made a tiered cake and this recipe covered one 4-layer 6 inch cake and one 3-layer 9 inch cake, so it makes a lot!  It did make it the night before and put it in the fridge and I panicked when I pulled it out to frost the cake and it was one big solid lump of frosting.  I defrosted a little bit at the time in the microwave and it softened up and looked and tasted great on the cake!  I made another half batch for piping and flowers and the consistency was perfect at first.  It does get very soft with heat, I would use a little at a time unless you want mushy flowers.  Overall, a definite make again, Iâ€™ll keep this in my recipe book!

This was fabulous frosting! I halved the recipe and still had enough (and to spare) for 2 batches of sugar cookies. I also did as others suggested and substituted half the shortening for butter and then used almond extract instead of vanilla and found I only needed half the amount of whipping cream. But it was sooo delicious!

By far the easiest and best tasting buttercream recipe I have made.  As with any recipe, you may need to add a little more powdered sugar to get the right consistency, but very easy to make and I frosted a 3 layer stacked cake and had leftover frosting.  Will use this on sugar cookies and again, great recipe!

Loved this! I halved it for 18 cupcakes and still had leftovers. I did 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening and added cocoa powder to make chocolate. Will use on most cakes/cupcakes I make from now on!

This frosting is really good. It's not to sweet. I, like others, substituted 1/2 butter in place of the shortning and there isnt as much unpleasent coating of the tongue & palet in crisco. I hate that.

I will say this frosting had the best consistency to shape and it held. However, I'm giving it a low rating because the flavor was so-so. Way too much powdered sugar. 

I'll use it again if I need a frosting that looks awesome, but I'm going to keep searching for one with more of a buttercream taste.

Wonderful buttercream frosting. As recommended by many I used 1 cup salted butter and 1 cup shortening. I did however follow true to the remainder of the recipe. No over powering sweetness and perfect consistency for piping and frosting.

This is a great recipe with great consistency.  The only thing I changed was I used 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of shortening instead of 2 cups of shortening.  Also, I think next time I am going to use less sugar because I prefer a lighter taste, although it does taste a lot less sugary than the pre made frosting that you buy.

Yummmm! Made as per recipe. It was more than enough to generously ice 48 cupcakes.  A smooth, soft consistency, easy to pipe and held its shape well.   Next time I will make trying 1/2 unsalted butter and 1/2 shortening to see if it gives it even more flavor.

This is now the only buttercream I will make.  As written or made with half butter, half shortening, the taste and texture is excellent!  Standard buttercream is really too sweet and never makes enough for a double layer cake.  This recipe is so generous that I have some left to spread on graham crackers as a snack-try it!  Thanks Rick, you made my day!

I'm giving this 4 stars just cus i changed it.  But it is great.   I did change this a bit like other reviewers, but i think it was perfect.  i did 1 cup butter 1 cup crisco and i only used 6 cups of sugar (i don't like frosting to be too sweet) it held up perfectly and tasted just right.  i think the whipping cream is the special trick here.    i used it to make a john deere tractor cake ( pic #185, there are a few JD cakes in the photos for this recipe) for my son's 5th birthday the other day, the frosting was very nice to work with, not too sticky, was fairly easy to get smooth (it's best btw to start with a lot of icing on the cake and then scrape off what you don't need and get  it smooth)  this recipe does make a lot, but since i used so much between all the layers and scraped a lot off i did run out, so if you are doing something tricky like a tractor cake make extra.  if you are looking at my picture the white icing on the cake itself is just the betty crocker from the can, and also the icing on the front of the tires, as you can see, canned frosting does not hold up, it slowly sags and falls.  later when i pulled the cake out for the party ( i always freeze them, they taste better) the canned icing started to melt and the black bled into the other colors,  Ricks Special Buttercream however did not, even in 80+ it held up well, and it also doesn't seem to get hard and crusty.  it just is great.

Perfect with a few modifications, half shortening, half butter, and I used 5.5 cups of confectioners sugar.  8 cups makes it much too sweet, 6 cups makes it moderately too sweet.  This icing is now my go to icing...and I've tried everything under the sun.

I made this frosting to use on Halloween cupcakes for my son's class halloween party. It quickly became the only frosting he wants. His friends actually ask me to make cupcakes for their play dates and specifically ask that I make "THE" frosting! It lasts in the fridge for a long time, too.

this was awesome. I used it as a filling for a two tier fondant cake. I did use 1/2 butter(no salt) and 1/2 crisco. I added 1/2 cup cocoa powder to make this a chocolate butter cream did have to add about an extra 1/4 cup of cream to make up for adding the cocoa. Also forgot to add the salt per recipe. It was soooo good. Tasted like a mouse but sturdier. I finished the cake and my husband cleaned the bowl of frosting with a spoon.

W----ow! That was my expression when I tasted this buttercream. It is SOOOO good. Very fattening, but anything that tastes delicious usually is fattening hehe. But basically what I did was replace half of the shortening with unsalted buter. And it was the best buttercream ever. Very sweet, so if you don't like it too sweet, take out about 1/2 a cup or perhaps even a whole cup. I cut the recipe in HALF and still had more than enough to frost a 2 layer cake. Absolutely a stone groove smash hit wonder. I reccommend to anyone who wants a simple buttercream frosting. It's simple, yet breathtaking. Oh, and I did use Heavy Cream, but if ur dieting, milk or half and half will probably suffice. It will harden up more when refrigerated if you dont use the cream, but still very very good. And like others, I did think that it tasted better the next day. I prefer all my icings refrigerated and cool rather than warm and room temp. Definitely spread it when its still warm, but refrigerate the whole cake before serving. Thats my tip.

Awesome recipe! I sifted the powdered sugar before adding and used half 'n half instead of cream. (I thought I was out of cream, but found it later.) It was delicious despite that change. Thanks for a keeper!

I used 1/2 butter flavored Crisco and 1/2 butter, and this came out absolutely fantastic.  I've also made it with whole milk instead of cream with equally good results.

I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 regular shortening, which was very good.  I have also made this with all shortening and I really didn't care for it that way - too fake.  This is a really good, easy, yummy recipe and it spreads and pipes very well.  I have made a chocolate version by adding melted baking chocolate squares in with the cream (4 oz for a 1/2 scaled recipe).  My brother-in-law said the chocolate icing was really good, and he has NEVER complimented me on my cooking.  I usually make a half portion of this recipe - this seems to be enough for a regular sized layer cake with a bit of piping.  I have also made the full quantity and froze the unused portion successfully.  This is my choice recipe for homemade icing.

Delicious--this recipe's a keeper! I deviated only slightly based upon other reviewers' suggestions, using half butter and half butter-flavored shortening. This resulted in a yellow-toned product, but because I was tinting it for decoration, I didn't care that it wasn't pure white. I've tried a lot of frosting recipes, and this one is the best buttercream by far.

Awesome!  I 1/2 the recipe and there was tons left over.  I also used milk instead of the cream and it still turned out great.

I;ve tried many of the onther buttercream frostings on this site and this one is the best. It doesn't have that crunchy sugar taste and it's not too too sweet. I used it to frost "box mix" cupcakes. Everyone thought they were really good. I attribute it to the frosting. I will make this again.

I have a very sweet tooth, so the 8 cups of sugar did not bother me in the least.  Those that ate the cake liked it, not one person complained it was too sweet.  I took the advice of some readers and changed to 1/2 butter shortening & 1/2 butter.  If you want white icing, though, beware.  That combination makes a cream colored icing.  I was a little disappointed, but I should've thought of that earlier.  My next cake is to be an anniversary cake, so I'm going to try the original recipe and the modified recipe (with shortening), but I'll use plain shortening instead.  So much easier than my previous recipe, which called for cooking egg whites!  This one's a keeper!

Wonderful! I followed a suggestion and used half butter and half shortening. Not too sweet, and a good consistency even when using milk instead of heavy cream. I halved the recipe, and just used what I had on hand since I needed some frosting quick! Much, much better than running to the store for the canned stuff.

Half butter and half shorting made a great difference. This recipe  is a wonderful base recipes for some many alterations. Wonderful on its own and wonderful with so many additional flavors. This one is a recipe to keep.

I'm probably the only one but I didn't like the taste that much.  I still gave it 4 stars because of the consistency.  I did make a change like others have with the shortening.  I used 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening.  I beat it forever!

I use all butter instead of shortening.  I don't use as much heavy cream but rather add it slowly by tablespoonfuls until I reach a consistency that I want to work with.  I also cut back on the amount of salt, unless I'm using unsalted butter.  I add 1/4 teaspoon of almond flavoring as well, and if the weather is especially humid, I add a tablespoon of meringue powder to help stabilize the icing, since I'm only using butter.  I also make sure I sift the powdered sugar before I add it.  I've made this recipe many times and it's quite good!

Usually I'm not a fan of buttercream frosting because of the texture. This buttercream is AMAZING!  Smoothe, fluffy, and great tasting.  I used just butter (no shortening) and only 6 cups of powdered sugar.  Not too sweet with no salt added.  This recipe makes a ton.  Half a batch easily frosted. 5 dozen Chritmas cookies.

This recipe was great! Like most everyone else who had a 5-star review, I did make a few changes. Instead of powdered sugar I used egg whites, and I replaced the shortening with a half-and-half mixture of breadcrumbs and peanut butter. I didn't have any heavy whipping cream so I subbed 1/2 cup of coffee granules. WHY rate a recipe 5 stars if you changed it? It's not a 5-star recipe if you didn't follow the recipe! 

Ok, to be fair, I have made a similar frosting, but prefer a buttercream with actual butter in it.

Best ever!  I divided the shortening into third with butter and peanut butter.  Oh my....just awesome on chocolate cupcakes!  Also dropped a mini Reese's cup in the cupcake before baking.  Peanut butter and chocolate lovers will definitely enjoy these!

I followed the recipe except used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter;  it had a great texture if you're using it to decorate, but it didn't taste like much to me and my daughter.  She said it tasted too much like bakery frosting.  To salvage it, I melted 4 squares of unsweetened baking chocolate and beat it into the frosting.  My granddaughter said that made it great.  I may try it again with all butter next time as I am more interested in the taste than decorations.

This is the best frosting I have ever made.  I had to cut down the recipe because I didn't have enough sugar and I still had more than I needed.  I felt like a kid licking the beaters!  I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening, added the sugar and whipping cream slowly until I got the consistency I was looking for.  I also melted some chocolate chips and drizzled the melted chocolate in as it was beating.  I will never use another frosting recipe again!  Thank you.

This is the best easy buttercream frosting recipe I've made. Love it! I did use only 5 cups of confectioner's sugar, however, and found it to be more than sweet enough. Also, don't forget to sift your sugar before using... I didn't and ended up with lumps.

This is the best buttercream I have ever made!! I did follow suggestions of others.  I used 4 oz. of heavy cream, 6 c. powdered sugar, 1/2 Crisco 1/2 unsalted butter (cause it was all I had). Because I only had unsalted butter, I added another 1/4 t. of salt.  DO NOT USE cheap shortening.  It is not solid enough and the frosting will be too thin.

I am not a big fan of super sweet frostings, so this was a bit sweet for me, even after halving the sugar.  The texture was really great, though!  I made a variation using peanut butter (subbed butter and peanut butter for some of the shortening), and it was very smooth and creamy.

This frosting was good, but a little greasy and not as fluffy as I had thought it would be.  Good basic recipe, but not much punch.

I found that using half butter the cake doesnt set properly for the type of decorating I prefer. so I use all crisco and add butter flavoring. it looks great and tastes even better. this is definately my new favorite!!

I made this recipe exactly as written and I give it 4 stars.  It has a light fluffy texture and a sweet and creamy flavor.  My only qualms were that I wish it has a bit more butter flavor, so next time I think I will do half shortening and half butter as other reviewers have mentioned.  Otherwise, is it pretty good and the consistency is great for piping and cupcake decorating.

This was the first buttercream frosting that I have ever made and I did use the suggestions by JOSLYN H....and I must say, I will definitely be using this recipe again and again!  All of our guests just raved about the frosting, they said it was "bakery quality" frosting!

After reading the comments, I opted to use 1/2 unsalted butter, 1/2 shortening.  I do add a bit more salt than it calls for to make up for the unsalted butter, but keep everything else exacly as the recipe calls.  I only made 1/3 of this and I still had about 2 cups leftover.  I used clear vanilla extract so when I colored it, it came out right.  Otherwise perfect!!  And don't mind the leftover frosting, because it will be taken care of, trust me!!  ;o)

I am giving this 3 stars because I have made icing like this before and I was hoping for something better. I might have beaten it a big too long, as the icing seemed :loose". I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening and about 4 c of sugar and it was STILL too sweet for my taste. 

For those of you that had a great consistency, for how long did you beat the fat?

I followed directions exactly and it was perfect.  I was concerened when adding the powdered sugar (sifted a cup at a time) that it wouldn't be creamy enough, it looked a little dry, but then when I added the heavy cream (8oz) and whipped it, it was perfect! Everyone was asking for the recipe for the frosting or where I bought my cupcakes! I halved the recipie and there was plenty to pip a nice thick swirl on 78 mini cupcakes!

I added a LOT of Oreo cookie crumbs ... and saved some white frosting for the center.  I added some whip to the frosting and filled the chocolate cupcakes.  Needless to say ... these were a huge hit!

This made enough for 32 mini cupcakes with some leftover. I took some advice from previous reviews to substitute half of the shortening for butter, I wish I substituted all of the shortening. Shortening just tastes artificial to me. Next time I'll use all butter. Also, I only used 4 cups of powdered sugar and it was sweet enough for me.

We decided to make our own wedding cake and after trying several different recipes, we decided to use this one!  We, and everyone else, LOVE it!  This recipe does not stiffen as much as some of the others but it did enough for the decoration that I did.  I will use this recipe time and time again!

I made this to practice with piping. I probably would have done half butter, but because it was for practice only I followed the recipe and used all shortening. I scaled the recipe down to (3) servings with the calculate button, and still got a full 1 1/2 cups to work with! I thought it tasted exactly like what one would think the frosting would taste like on a traditional basic wedding cake. I used to have another similar recipe and lost it, so I will save this one instead. I wouldn't use it for anything other than cupcakes or if someone wanted a basic style wedding cake as it isn't loaded with flavor. However, I don't care for shortening in icing, so it might just be me. I'll be practicing some with it this week, it looks like it will hold up shape well to test designs. Thanks.

Buttercream frosting is not really my favorite but this was good.  Everyone liked and it was super easy to make and tasted great.  I did use half butter and half crisco and creamed butter/crisco for 10 min.

This is a great buttercream recipe.  I too, have tried many and really like this one.  Like many others, I used half butter-flavored shortening.  
This recipe is a great jumping off point for adding flavors, and other tweaks.  Lovely, thank you Rick!

Sorry, but this just didn't work for me. It was sweet, but didn't taste like butter and the texture was a little too fluffy. I just prefer more density. I could see how some would like it, just not my preference.

I did half butter, half shortening (I know, I know you should ONLY review the recipe as written but buttercream really does need BUTTER) and it was perfect.  It got rave reviews and was easy as could be.

I tried this twice in the last couple of days. I prefer 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening. Also I cut back on the confectioner's sugar (6 cups instead of 8). And because I cut back on the sugar, I also used only 1/2 the whipping cream. It came out much better than my first batch in which I followed to the letter. Next time I make this I think I will cut down to 5 cups of sugar and see how it works out.   This recipe is huge, so you may want to scale it down otherwise you will end up with too much.

Very tasty frosting...I used half shortening, half salted butter (omitting the 1/2 tsp. salt called for in the recipe).  I whipped this up for about 10-15 minutes in my standmixer and it was soo yummy! I also halved the recipe, which was just enough to frost a double layer 9 inch cake :~)

Fantastic taste & texture!  And it was easy with the help of my kitchenaid mixer.  I used 6 oz of heavy cream and next time would cut back to 4 oz for a stiffer consistency for bag decorating.

Loved this frosting. I used half butter and half shortening. I do not care for the taste of frosting but those that ate it said it was good not overly sweet like commercial frostings tend to be. It was easy to pipe and held shape well. Will definitely be my go to recipe from now on.

This turned out lovely! Not sicky sweet but has a nice flavor. I wouldn't recommend using a standard hand mixer because this is very thick and my mother's mixer started to over heat haha. This frosting was very smooth and easy to pipe. Throw it in the fridge for a while and piping will be easier. Thanks!

OMG!!  This is the best! I promise to never buy that canned "frosting", HUH! Again!! This is creamy, sweet and lovely w/o that artificial taste. This recipe makes quite a bit and am still experimenting with the decorating part of this Frosting. It tastes fabulous! Thanks Rick,  â™¥ Patty â™¥

Wish I would have read other people's reviews before making. Was really happy with the consistency of the frosting. But since I knew how much shortening was in the frosting that was all I could think of when eating it. I do plan on using this recipe for my son's birthday cake this weekend but will be using 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening.

I am so glad that I tried this!  After reading the reviews, I made similar changes...and added a little of my own.  I did half butter and half shortening...a pinch of salt, 2 t. of clear vanilla and ended up using about 7 c. of powdered sugar.  I used the full cup of whipping cream and it was the perfect consistency to decorate and pipe (although, as mentioned, it does "melt" in your hand quickly, so move fast...use small amounts, and/or refrigerate in between...but not too long, because it does harden quickly in the fridge).  Okay, my special touch???  I added just a touch of butter flavored extract.  It was missing that little "umf" that really makes it "butter"cream frosting.  I think that was the key.  I tasted it before and after, and that made it...it's JUST like good bakery frosting...and I LOVE BAKERY FROSTING!!!  Decorated a barbie cake with it and it did wonderfully.  Thanks, Rick!!

This recipe was good but not what I was looking for to go on top of my cake. The taste was fabulous but it was too light and fluffy for me. I think it's the whipping cream that did it. I took out the 2 cups of shortening and used butter, shortening has a waxy taste to me. Overall it's good if you want a light finish.

This is just like the Wilton Extra Special Buttercream recipe. Love this frosting! You do have to be careful not to overbeat and make your frosting into butter! :) And I found it can be somewhat tricky to pipe, but it's still my go to recipe. I opted to use 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter instead of all shortening and I'm glad I did.

made this to top cupcakes for a bridal shower and it was raved upon.   Made it just like it stated and had so many say that it did not taste sweet and they liked that.   Held up to piping and to decorate with miniture flowers.    AWESOME recipe thank you!

I have been trying a few different frosting recipes and this one takes the cake, literally! It sets so nicely in the fridge and tastes fantastic. I used half butter and half crisco and added a touch more vanilla. I also cut the recipe in half and it gave me more than enough frosting for 24 cupcakes. Love it!

Wow! This was outstanding.  I used half shortening and half butter. Only problem, I didn't read that it made 7 cups till I was in the middle of it. I froze the rest. Hope that works out!

Love RIcks Buttercream Frosting. Holds up very well and is so easy to work with. I like using the crisco rather than half crisco half butter. It has a creamier texture and great flavor. Thanks Rick!

I took the suggestion of another reviewer & used 1 cup of shortening along with 1 cup of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter sticks.  Turned out really great.  And there was enough to easily frost 2 two layer cakes.  Definitely a keeper.  Good flavor, great fluff.  Might divide in half for future use.
I've used this several times now & fondly refer to it as "old shoe" frosting since you could frost an old shoe with it & it was still be divine!  I have coworkers who only eat cake because it's the vehicle for the frosting.  And they all agree this is one of the best scratch frostings they've ever had.

I am new to buttercreams.  Usually prefer whipped cream but this turned out better than I expected.  Two criticisms.....1. I also don't believe in using shortening.....Yuck!  I used all butter but then struggled a bit with it softening in my piping bag while decorating.  2.  The sugar remained a bit gritty but I don't know how you'd combat that.  Maybe that's why there are cooked buttercream that use a melted syrup.  Don't let this review scare you.  If I need a buttercream, I'll probably use this again.

Opted for this over the Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting because I intended to use it primarily for decorating and didn't want to waste the cream cheese.  This was an excellent decorator frosting.  Follow the recipe exactly for perfect frosting... easy to use, easy to handle in the pastry bags, colors easily and holds up wonderfully!  Will use this recipe for cake decorating from now on.

Very good stuff I did use butter in place of the shortening but I don't much care if my frosting comes out off white or not. If you want a pure white frosting def use the shortening. I love how spreadable this stuff is and the creaminess it has with the heavy creme added. I pretty much used the same recipe in the past but always used milk the heavy creme adds alot to this frosting!

I used half butter, half shortening as suggested. Icing turned out good consistency, best when chilled. When it wasn't cold I found it easy to work with but a little too soft for me to really enjoy. I doubled it so it made a ton. I still have a lot left to use up, but I'm sure I'll find a way! ;)

Not amazing, but definitely not bad.  It was just so sweet - we couldn't get the taste out of our mouths.  Consistency wise it was very soft.  I only used the 6 oz of cream, but I still had to refrigerate it to get it stiff enough to work with for decorating.  On the upside, it was very spreadable, and looked nice and flat.  However I will be trying another recipe that isn't so overwhelmingly sweet.

Really delicious and a very nice consistency for decorating.  Took advice of others and used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shorteningl added vanilla extract until it "tasted" right (to me, more is better when it comes to vanilla!).

I followed other advice and used 1 c shortening and 1 c butter.  Also used less powdered sugar (6 cups?) and a bit less cream.    I made 4x this recipe for a special event.  Had to ice and decorate 120 cupcakes.  It worked out wonderfully!  Great taste and it was the perfect consistency for fancy piping.  I used Wilton gel food coloring for bright colors.  Thank you for the recipe!

I used this recipe to frost a birthday cake and it tasted amazing!  We don't use shortening at in our home, so I used 100% butter.  It made piping the frosting onto the cake a bit more difficult since the butter melts much more easily than shortening.  To combat this, I put the piping bag in the freezer to solidify the frosting every 5 minutes. The cake turned out great and everyone loved the rich buttery frosting.  Next time I will try using 1/2 butter and 1/2 coconut oil.

Excellent results!  I needed a frosting that would not only taste good, but would hold up well for all the wedding cupcakes I had to make for my son's wedding.  The 130 cupcakes not only looked beautiful with their piped frosting, but stood up to the over 90-degree afternoon without melting!  Nothing but raves from all the guests.  I have since used this recipe to frost "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" also from this site, making them taste like the ones in the bakery!

This frosting is really good!  It's a little on the sweet side, but should compliment most of my cakes since they aren't super sweet.  This makes quite a bit of frosting.  I used a two pound bag of powdered sugar which is approximately 8 cups of sugar.

Super tasty--I couldn't stop licking the bowl. Really easy to work with too; I don't have a mixer so that's important to me! I made half a batch, using a stick of butter-flavor Crisco, then I added a packet of unsweetened strawberry Kool Aid which made it a little sour. This recipe is pretty forgiving though; I added probably an extra cup of powdered sugar to compensate for the Kool Aid and it was still a great consistency (I used the full amount of cream). My new favorite recipe from this site!

WARNING: It is hard to stop eating this icing once you sample it :D  thanks for an awesome recipe.  I love it!  My Substitute for Heavy Whipping Cream: 2 TBSP Melted butter (then cooled to at least room temp) and 1% Milk (appx 4 ounces to make a total of 6 ounces).  Used All Shortening as recipe called for & Added 2 tsp vanilla extract along with 1/2 tsp Wilton Butter Flavor. I did beat the Shortening for 10 minutes before adding powdered sugar and once the sugar was added I allowed it to get to a fine meal texture before adding the vanilla,salt,butter flavoring and Whipping Cream Substitute.  I will update more once I use it on the cake and give a full review. This works great on the cakes IMO :)  I have tried alot of buttercream frostings and this one is definitely the BEST!  I will not use another.  I am using it again today to go on my son's birthday cake.  Sample tasted it and yum!  Sooooo good!  I did the same as before with the substitute of milk & butter for whipping cream and it works great!  I also added 2 tsp of Meringue Powder this time.  Thanks again Rick!

I am always searching for the perfect MOCHA 'buttercream' recipe in that I'm attempting to recreate the frosting I remember from my youth, used in bakeries in the North Jersey area, ...just loved it then, and have come close to duplicating it but not quite! This particular recipe I made the following substitutions to:  I omitted the vanilla and replaced it with a TBLS of instant coffee granules dissolved in a small amount of hot water, and used cocoa powder in place of 1/2 cup of the sugar..EXCELLENT!!!!!  THIS IS THE CLOSEST TO DATE!!!

Really good and really easy!  I would give it 5 stars, but like other reviewers I changed the recipe to use half softened butter and half shortening.  I started with about 4 ounces (1/2 cup) whipping cream and only needed a few tablespoons more for the right consistency.  I split the frosting into three different bowls and used neon food coloring gels to color them.  It was the perfect texture and held up well when decorating my cupcakes. This recipe was fluffier than other buttercreams I have tried - probably because of the whipping cream.  I'll definitely use this again in the future. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best frosting!  I will never, ever buy canned frosting again.  I made it exactly as the recipe was written except I added about 1/2 tsp. of almond extract.  It was wonderful, delicious and easy to decorate with.

I found this recipe worked well for frosting and piping.  I normally use a different recipe from this site to pipe, however it's too stiff to frost the whole cake.  In order to save time, I frosted and piped with this recipe.  I found it a tad sweet, but I followed others' suggestions and replaced half of the shortening with butter.  I'm happy with the results.  I also only used about 4-5 oz. of the cream for the consistency that I needed.

this was fantastic..I've been trying and trying to find a receipe that matched Pulix' buttercream, but could never find it, this came about the closest, after tasting it bit by bit, I felt 8 cups of sugar would have been to much, so I stopped at 6, and I used half of butter flavored shortening, with plain shortening, and I used almond extract instead of vanilla..the almond gave it kind of that wedding cake taste, its wonderful! took it to a family picnic and everyone raved about it! so thank Rick! :)

This isn't a buttercream to me.  More like the "whipped" alternative you get at the store.  It doesn't pipe bad- a bit too soft for me.  Overall- this would be good to put between cookies.   I did sub milk for cream.

This recipe makes a ton, watch out. Unfortunately, we didn't like it at all. It felt like a lot of wasted ingredients. I think I'll try the recipe on the confectioners' sugar package.

Bleh! I halved this recipe, and it was just enough to pipe frosting onto 24 chocolate cupcakes. I too, have never used shortening in frostings, but after reading the good reviews I decided to try it. In all fairness, I will say that this recipe DOES IN FACT, give you a perfect consistency for piping decorations. On the other hand, I would not make this frosting using shortening! I would use all butter instead, adjust the amount of heavy cream, and simply chill it to firm it up. The frosting left a funky, bitter aftertaste in the back of my tongue- sort of like heavily food-colored frosting does. As I am writing this review, I can still taste it. My husband,my guinea pig, didn't mind nor notice so much; his response was, ' Just tastes like vanilla and sugar to me.' I guess some ppl aren't as put off by the taste as I am. This was a good learning experience, and I now know that I will never sacrifice better taste for ideal consistency using shortening :( Sorry, Rick.

I made this frosting for cupcakes (I halved the recipe).  I, like a lot of other posters, substituted butter for half the amount or shortening.  The taste was richer because of the butter.  I made cupcakes for 3 separate groups of people over 2 days and they all raved about the frosting and the cupcakes were ALL GONE!!!  FAST!!! 
I was able to pipe this on after chilling for about an hour.  Even right after mixing, it was ready to go!!  Fast, easy AND great tasting!!

Good thing there is a healthier option than Crisco which is non-hydrogenated organic palm shortening in the health food section of some grocery stores.  Now the frosting is fantastic!

I use this recipe to frost and decorate every cake I make! Everyone always raves about it, people have commented they usually don't like cake or frosting but love this. I use all butter, double the vanilla and usually need 12 cups icing sugar. I have tried it half Crisco shortening and half butter and used water for the cream holds up better in warmer temperatures, still tastes good.

This is excellent frosting. I am a frosting fanatic,  & did not find this too sweet. I did 1/2 butter, 1/2 white crisco, blended it for about 10 minutes to get real fluffy.  Did not have whipping cream, used whole milk. Still was very good. This was a test run for a birthday cake (white velvet II on this site, good together, tastes like right from the bakery!

A good frosting recipe and its great to flavor.  I used strawberry extract instead of vanilla and added some red food coloring.  I used it to frost a plain white cake..YUM=)  I did half the recipe, but I added more than a tsp of extract...I tasted as I added til it was enough.

Changed this to half butter and half shortening for flavor. Found it too sweet in the end, would have cut the amount of sugar down by at least a couple of cups. But make sure you whip the be-jezus out of the frosting for a good 5 minutes minimum! It gets fabulously fluffy that way!

I decided to substitute a cup of butter for one of the cups of shortening. I iced and decorated a wedding cake with this, and everyone loved it! I had so many people tell me it was the best wedding cake they had ever eaten. Definately try this one!

I made this recipe using 1/2 butter flavored shortening & 1/2 butter. I got so many compliments on the lightness of the frosting. It makes a huge batch - I frosted 4 dozen cupcakes generously & still had leftovers. Great recipe!!!

The defining ingredient in buttercream is BUTTER. If there is no butter, it is not buttercream.

This frosting was amazing!  I had been making frosting wrong for years!  I easily made half the recipe and was able to frost a regular cake.....i also used one stick of butter and a half cup of Crisco.

I have made this recipe twice and have gotten rave reviews from everyone!  Thank you for making me look so good!  I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening.  One time I only had half and half which worked just as well as the whipping cream.
Tip: Making half the recipe is enough for 24 cupcakes.

This is an excellent butter cream recipe. I didn't give it a "5" because, like many other here, I made the recipe with half butter and half shortening and I didn't think it was fair to give it a "5" when I didn't make it exactly as written.  Using half butter and half shortening, however, makes this a "5" star and it's been added to my recipe box.

It was smile to make and is wonderful to work with. IF living in a very humid area (e.g. FL where I live) I would suggest on real humid days you maybe add Â¼ c of cream at first then slowly adding more if needed.

I have had frosting before with shortening in it and I have enjoyed it. All tho everyone else liked it. I was not a fan of it. =/ It had to much of that shortening taste. If I make it again which I may do because I will always try something twice. But I may go with the with 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening idea to get that BUTTER melt in your mouth frosting YUM! Good Luck!

I added this recipe to my "recipe box" n 2009.  It is the only buttercream recipe I have used since.  I do sometimes change out the shortening for 1/2 shortening 1/2 butter.  Thanks Rick!

Not bad! For my husband's birthday, I always make the usual - a chocolate cake (One Bowl Chocolate Cake on this site is his FAVORITE!) covered with vanilla frosting. I've tried a TON of frosting recipes on here (it seems as if I've made every one on this site lol!), but none have *quite* met my expectations. They were either too sweet, not nearly creamy / fluffy enough (for my liking) or hardened (slightly) after setting up (the vanilla-chocolate powdered sugar frosting submitted by Anonymous is SUPER yummy, but does not have any volume to it and hardens after a day or two - which I do NOT like). Rick's frosting is not only perfectly sweetened (it's not AS sweet as some of the others I've tried), it spreads BEAUTIFULLY and stays fluffy-soft for days!!! FYI, a half batch of this yielded MORE than enough to frost a double layered round cake with a tad leftover. If you are looking for an excellent, all-purpose buttercream frosting, search no farther. This is THE best one yet! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Rick. I think I can confidently say, my search for the perfect vanilla frosting is finally over! :-)

Not sweet enough for me. Made plenty to frost a couple dozen cupcakes as it was fluffy and decorated nicely. Even my 12 yr said it didn't taste "that great" so I trust the kids opinion. I will stick to Grocery Store Frosting Recipe here on AR right now.

I have been making buttercream icing for years and, I have to say that this is a great recipe. I did as others said and halfed the shortening and added butter for the other half. I used unsalted butter because the recipe called for salt. By the way, adding vanilla will give the icing a slightly darker tinge. If you don't want that tinge, you can use imitation (some brands call it "clear") vanilla. It gives the icing the same flavor. The one thing that I will say is that I am used to using a buttercream recipe that doesn't call for diary (i.e., the heavy whipping cream). The whipping cream gives the icing a very creamy taste and smooth texture. However, you have to make sure that you refrigerate your cake because of the diary. Buttercream icing can be made without diary and it comes out stiffer and thicker without the diary.

If you use half butter and half shortening, this is a 5 star frosting. The taste is lacking and the texture is greasy unless the shortening is cut back and replaced with butter. The rest of the recipe is right on, perfect consistency for piping and holds its shape beautifully! I made 48 cupcakes for a bunch of teenagers and had frosting left over, this makes a huge batch. Several of the kids told me it was the best tasting frosting, 'ever'! Unless you are doing 2 or more cakes or 4 dozen cupcakes, I would halve this recipe.

this worked really well. i switched one cup of shortening with one cup of butter because it just seemed wrong not to have butter in the butter cream icing. the icing tasted really good and spread very easily. it also held it's shape when i used the icing bag. i added cocoa to make it chocolate.

I've made (and eaten) more than my fair share of buttercream frostings and I must say this is my all time favorite.  I usually lean towards cream cheese frosting because I'm not crazy about buttercream, but this is my new go-to recipe.  LOVE it.  I did replace the shortening with butter though, so I would definitely recommend doing so...the flavor was amazing and the frosting holds its shape really well. 5+ stars from me :)

I've been looking for an American Buttercream frosting that is not too sweet, creamy, but holds up well in heat and humidity.  So far this one tastes wonderful.  I used Hi Ratio shortening and only 6 cups of sugar and 5 ounces heavy cream.  I did beat at a med high speed for a minimum of template minutes.  Plan to try the as written however mine had a ton of air bubbles upon sitting at room temp for a couple of hours.  Any experienced bakers/decorators know why?  I would also use less salt as I could taste it and didn't like it.

My new buttercream icing recipe!  The taste is so creamy-I used 1 cup shortening, 1 cup butter.  Also started out with 1/4 cup of heavy cream then added more to get desired consistency, didn't quite need the total amount called for.  Spreads easily and makes wonderful borders and flowers.  Thank you Rick!

I did as others suggested: half butter and half shortening, which was perfect.  The consistency is great as well is the taste.
A little sweet for me - but isn't all buttercream like that? :)

I used half shortening and half butter, and this came out perfect! It's light and fluffy, not overly sweet or choking like some frostings. Feel free to use different extracts-- I used mint extract when I made mint chocolate chip cupcakes. This will be my standard buttercream recipe from now on!

This is the stuff! I used this to ice and decorate a cake and cupcakes last night. I used 1 c. butter and 1 c. crisco, but it's the cream that makes this recipe. This recipe is now my go-to.

This would be an AMAZING frosting to use on a cake.... I added almond extract as well as the vanilla it called for, also I followed others suggestions to use half butter, which was a really good substitute because I dont know that I would have liked the texture/flavoring of straight shortening.  I will add- DO NOT USE THIS FROSTING FOR COOKIES, as it DOES NOT set up and makes packaging/transporting nearly impossible.

I'm sorry, we just didn't care for this.  I took PP's hints to use half butter and half Crisco but it still tasted way too greasy to me.  Plus, mine turned out too fluffy and wouldn't spread well for me!  (That may be my fault, maybe I beat it for too long.)  Anyway, my search for the perfect frosting will continue...

I give this frosting 3 stars for taste, don't get me wrong it was a good frosting but just tasted like store bakery frosting, and I'm more of a cream cheese frosting person. I give it 4 stars for how much frosting it made, I was able to frost a 2 layer 9 inch cake and 2 dozen cupcakes and still had plenty left over.

I have made this frosting several times now and it is delicious.  However, I do find that I have a lot of trouble decorating with it.  I have been taking a cake decorating class and by a half hour into the class, the frosting has warmed to the point where it is unmanageable.  The key to this frosting is keeping it cold 100% of the time.

This recipe is amazing! I used it on a fondant covered cake and it held the fondant perfectly! It wasn't too sweet like some other recipes, but had the perfect consistency and tasted wonderful. I used it in the layers, the sides, and the piping and it worked exceptionally well for all tasks. Greaet recipe!

This buttercream frosting is awesome! I followed another reviewer's suggestion. I used 1/2 shortening, 1/2 butter and 5 cups of powdered sugar. This produces a nice consistency to ice your cake. If you want it to be stiffer then add every 1/2 cup of sugar or so. Pay attention.  It turned out wonderful. It was very easy to ice my entire cake. The whipping cream helps to tone down the sweetness of the buttercream.

This frosting was excellent and had great consistancy.  I used 1 cup butter flavored shortening and one cup regular shortening and it was perfect!  It frosted a 13x9 inch layered cake and I had a little leftover.  I had party guests asking for the recipe!

I love this recipe!  I use it for both of my boy's birthday cakes every year.  It is so easy to use with decorator tips and tastes great!

With a busy weekend instore I had no choice but to make the entire cake in advance. To keep it's freshness I stored the cake in the freeze until it was ready to be taken to my daughter's party. During the time it took to come to room temperture the frosting began to sweat, causing the coloured decorations to bleed. I believe this was caused by the shortening in the mix, therefore the next time i will try using butter only to prevent this from happening. Otherwise I love this recipe and have used it over and over again.

Great frosting recipe!  I used half and half instead of whipping cream and turned out fantastic!

This the best tasting icing recipe I have found. I have been looking for an icing recipe that is not too sweet and this is it. I have tried many different recipes and now I don't have to try anymore I have found the best. I did use butter instead of the shortening, I just prefer butter.

Very easy way to make a good buttercream.  I used half butter, half shortening and I reduced the sugar to 7 cups.  I think I may even reduce the sugar a little more next time.  Mine was very smooth and spreadable but I made sure to whip it really well.  This makes a lot of frosting.  I was able to generously frost 24 cupcakes and still had more than half left.

I used half butter, half shortening and followed the tips of JOSELYN. This is a delicious frosting with a great consistency. I would rate this 5 stars if it didn't have to be refrigerated, but when I have room in my fridge for a cake this will be my number 1 frosting choice!

I took the advice of others and used half butter and half shortening.  What a great recipe.  My husband couldn't stop eating them.  I also used evaporated milk in place of the cream.  It worked great and it is a lot cheaper than cream.  I only ended up using about 5 1/2 cups sugar and about 3/4 of the 5 oz can of evaporated milk.  A really good recipe.  Will use over and over.

I was pretty impressed with the reviews and bravely decided to significantly reduce the recipe to the 2 cups confectioners' sugar level while following peoples' suggestion for substituting 1/4 cup of butter in place of half the shortening and reducing the unwhipped cream to a quarter cup, etc.  Not sure if it matters but I used a hand mixer. It turned out okay but had sort of a raw kind of taste or something that I was not crazy about. Perhaps reducing the recipe volume that much may have been a factor? Though it is tastier than the "decorator" frostings or icings that I've tried thus far anyway.

The BEST frosting I have ever made! Actually tastes better than the bakery. I followed the recipe exactly and I don't think it's too sweet. The only real issue I had was beating all the sugar with the shortening. Make sure you use a heavy duty mixer! Totally worth it though. YUMMY!

Just made with my 2 year old master helper.  Turned out great.  I did 1/2 butter and 1/2 crisco.  I also used skim milk as I did not have cream on hand.  Still worked beautifully.  Thanks

It reminded my husband and I of a greasy version of little sara lee cakes  frosting. The kids loved it though! Too bad I made it to frost my Mothers 50th birthday cake. I am not sure that I will make this one again, but thank you for sharing anyways.

I made this frosting twice.  The first time it came out absolutely delicious.  The second time it got a grainy texture to it.  I don't know what happened.  I used the same ingredients both times using 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening.  Any ideas what could have gone wrong?

I wasn't too impressed with this frosting. I made half the recipe as written, half substituting butter for half the shortening. Neither one really had that great of a flavor, in my opinion. Thanks :)

As made, with shortening the icing would taste pretty commercial and bland and would be very unhealthy. Also I use much less sugar than written...and I love sweet. I do appreciate learning that shortening helps with decorative icing but I use 3/4 butter to 1/4 shortening. The taste is really good, the icing holds its form well for decorating and with the added shortening it keeps me from dipping my fingers in for samples. Thanks!

This is a very smooth & creamy buttercream that is very easy to work with.  My daughter offered to make a birthday cake for a friend that requested a rainbow cake.   As suggested by other reviewers, we used half butter, half Crisco and cut the confectioners sugar to 7 cups.  I think adding the last cup of powdered sugar would have been fine with  the addition of little lemon extract I used to brighten the flavor of the frosting.  It pipes very well but is a lot softer than the recipe I'm used to working with.  We'll definitely be using this recipe in the future.

I used several of the other user's suggestions -- 1/2 salted butter and 1/2 shortening, as well as less sugar. I planned on using 6 cups like others did, but found that then the texture was too greasy, so I went up to 7 and it was perfect. I added about 2 tblspns more cream to cut the vanilla flavor as well. Amazing. So many compliments.  I had MORE Than enough to frost a 9" two layer cake AND a mini cake (2 layers about 5") and have about 2 cups left. I'll come back to this for sure!

This is awesome - very bad for you, but great tasting and easy to put together and work with.  Used the suggestions of Joslyn H. Did not have quite enough cream, so topped off the 3 ounces I had with evaporated skim.  Worked great. Used no salt. Next time, will use 7 cups of sugar.

Finally, a frosting that does just what you ask it to do!  Loved the texture & spreadability, piped wonderfully.  I only had butter flavored crisco so I didn't do the 1/2 butter, 1/2 crisco version.  I could taste the fake butter flavor the first day but it was better the next day.  I will def. try it again with plain crisco & butter.  I also used 1 tsp. vanilla & 1 1/2 tsp. lemon extract.  It was perfect for my lemon cream cake.  Thank you!!  :o)

This was a good recipe and worked well for piping.  I don't like super sweet frosting so I decreased the sugar to 6 cups.  I also used 1 1/2 cups butter and 1/2 cup shortening.  Since I didn't add as much sugar, it didn't seem to need as much liquid.  I added just a few tablespoons of whole milk and it was light and fluffy!

Excellent! Makes alot! I had to throw 1/2 of mine away. I used 1 cup of shortning and 1 cup (2 sticks) of unsalted butter (suggested by someone on the site AND I didn't have 2 cups of shortning) Came out fabulous. Also, I put 1 cup of Whipping cream and that seemed to be enough, so I just stopped there. It could've been that I was light on the powdered sugar to try to even out that I didn't have a full cup of shortning. Regardless, this is a great recipe. For one layer of the cake, I added coffee liqeur on the cake and the frosting, delicious!!!

I did enjoy this recipe - a stand mixer definitely helps!  I had to throw my first batch away though.  Don't make my mistake, I used kosher salt and the salt didn't dissolve.  The second batch, with table salt, was much better.  I'm new to baking - mine had little bubbles in it when I frosted the cake.  It was either my technique, or I was supposed to refrigerate it or something.  I will keep working with it in the future though.

Good basic icing.  Not what I use on the wedding cakes I make, but I will use it for cupcakes.

I love this frosting!  I have always used only butter in my frosting, but I took the advise from JOSLYN H.'s review and used half butter and half crisco.  Wow.. I could not believe the great results. Now I did have to triple the recipe for the large cakes I was making, and I ended up only needing two cups of cream and not three... so when you make this frosting add the cream a small amount at a time to end with the consistency you would like. I will use this recipe from now on.  Thank you Rick and Joslyn for making the perfect frosting recipe.

Wonderful frosting. I made it exactly the way the recipe reads and used it on cupcakes. I remember reading somewhere that adding a couple tablespoons of meringue powder to it will help stabilize it for piping. I'm going to try that technique this weekend. Have to make two large cakes for a big party. I wonder how this frosting will work in place of a typical "crusting" BC? Hope it will look as smooth as typical crusting BC. We'll see!

I love this! I followed the advice of the other commentators and did half butter, half crisco, and only 6 cups of sugar (and about a cup of cocoa powder to make it chocolate). It was for my mother's birthday cake, and she's a real fan of buttercream. She say's that the texture is perfect!

This recipe was very tasty!! I used 1 cup butter flavored Crisco, 1 cup salted butter, and only 6 oz of whipping cream. I refrigerated the buttercream and put it in a pastry bag with 1M decorating tip to make the stiff cupcake swirls. The swirls did good, but had I not been in Biloxi MS in 100+ degree temp and had more time to refrigerate it would have done better. I added a few drops of food coloring to make pink, purple, green, and blue colors. The flavor was so incredible, and all the kids at the party just licked it off the top of the cupcakes.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and used butter/crisco, 4.5 oz cream, 2 tsp vanilla, and 6 cups of powdered sugar. I beat the butter/crisco for ~10 mins, and the sugar mixture another 10 mins. It came out beautifully-- so fluffy and light and pretty! The only thing is, for some reason it was kind of flimsy (even after cooling in the fridge for a while), so when I tried piping roses, they kept falling over. I eventually got them to work, but it was a bit frustrating. Not sure if I added too much cream or if it was too warm in my kitchen. However, for the rest of the cake, the frosting was great and easy to work with. A *little* too sweet for my own taste, but my company liked it. Thanks!

This frosting is very good! I used half shortening and half butter and the taste is great. This pipes very well too for decorating. I do think the next time I make this I will refrigerate awhile before using as I think it would be easier to work with if piping. Also, I believe this would be great with different extracts other than vanilla. I'll probably try almond next time. Definitely a keeper, thanks (:

I'm giving this 4 stars because the first time I made it I did what others suggested with half butter half shortening.  It was still a little greasy for my taste so the second time I made it I halved the recipe and did 3/4 butter and 1/4 shortening.  Came out much better, less greasy.  Otherwise, very good recipe and very quick to whip up.

YUCK!!  I made this twice, thinking I had done something wrong the firs time.  Nope.  No one in my family liked this buttercream and that's what we always have on our cakes.  I'm so glad we tasted it before frosting the cakes.

I scaled it down to 1/4 the recipe, and just used milk in place of heavy cream. I think it would taste better if I had a higher quality vanilla, and used the heavy cream, but my improvisions worked also! A little thin, might not work great for a cake, but was fine with the Clone of a Cinnabon (from this site)rolls I made.

Alright people, here is the deal. If you follow this recipe with the exception of using 1 cup BUTTER (not margarine) and 1 cup shortening, you will have the best buttercream icing ever. Tastes just like, if not better than the buttercream icing at any bakery. Cheers!

This is definitely the recipe I will use from now on when making frosting. Note - half the recipe will frost 24 cupcakes generously with a cup left over. Start with only 2 cups of powdered sugar, 4 cups was way too much. I will try substituting some of the crisco and with butter next time as others suggested. I may also try subbing a smidge of the cream for butter, I think it tasted a little "milky". Otherwise, very good.

Yummy, I'm not a big buttercream fan since it's too sweet for my taste but this one was perfect.  I substituted half crisco and half butter for the recipe.  I also only used 7 cups of sugar instead of the 8. It came out perfectly... It's even good 3 weeks later.

This is the first time I ever made buttercream frosting. I made a minor change to the recipe as I have tasted greasy buttercream icings. I used 1 and 1/2 cups of butter and 1/2 a cup of shortening. I found the texture great for decorating.

This turned out great...I used a little less sugar (just added until the consistency was right) and used skim milk instead of cream. Held up very well in the 80 degree weather, it got soft but didn't melt.

I used half shortening and half butter and a little extra whipping cream to make the frosting a little lighter and fluffier. Really good!

A great recipe, but it yields far more then twelve servings. I did follow the recommendation from others to fluff the shortening for over 10 minutes which maybe amplifies the volume of frosting. I generously frosted two square cakes and a round double layer cake and had plenty to spare.

I have made this recipe many times.  I have found that it turned out the best when I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1 1/2 cups of shortening.  I recently made it for a coconut cake so I added 1 tsp. coconut extract along with 1 tsp. vanilla extract and it was delicious!

FAB-U-LOUS!  Used this frosting most recently to make a 3-D duck cake for a baby shower.  It was so easy to work with, and set up nicely.  This will be my go-to recipe.  Thanks!

It was alright. I used 2/3 butter and 1/3 shortening. I guess I just don't really care for the texture or the sugary sweetness. Pipes great, though.

This was a huge hit at my sons birthday party, everyone could tell it wasn't your typical store bought icing. I gave it a 4 star only b/c I had a hard time piping out the icing near the end of the cake. It was quite warm in the house and that might have been part of the problem, I did let it sit in the freezer for a while to help harden it a bit, but that didn't help. Either way, it tasted great! Thanks a lot!

I have been looking for a really good butercream recipe.  This is it, I only had to us 6 oz. whipped cream.  At first it was a litle gritty but with a couuple extra minutes it turned out perfect.  I tried a bit of it as it was and it was great.  Then I split the batch in half and added a mixture of 1/4 boiling water and 1/4 dark cocoa, I had to add a bit extra sugar I just added it slowly until it was back to the right consistancy it turned out fantastic.  With the other half I added 3/4 cup peanut butter and used this to fill a 3 layer dark chocolate cake then iced it with the chocolate buttercream.  I will deffinitly make this recipe again plain or altering the flavor.

I made this frosting for my friends birthday. The response of the guests was "this tastes bad for you". It doesn't taste bad, but it definitely tastes like it's made of shortening. I might make it again....

I did a half-batch to frost a 9" two-layer cake. I followed the recipe closely although I used half butter and half shortening, and I used fat-free half and half instead of cream. It tasted AWESOME although a little greasy, and there was just a little too much to frost the cake (about Â½ cup left over). The frosting turned out a little soft and it didn't harden at all after sitting overnight, but that was fine. Using a piping bag for borders and rosettes was a little tough as it WAS soft, but the frosting stayed where I put it, even on the side! Thanks for sharing, Rick, this will be my go-to recipe for frosting!

The best ever!  I even used it to tint and decorate with.  Super with deep chocolate cake.  Made it for my son's birthday and got rave reviews.  Only change I made was to use real lard instead of shortening...can't stand the trans fats! :)

This is an awesome recipe.  It makes alot so I would recomend cutting it in 1/2 if you are just doing 24 cup cakes or a smaller layer cake.  I tried it will all butter because I didn't have any crisco and it turned out wonderful.  I also tried omiting the vanilla and adding some cocoa powder and it was delicious.  This is a great frosting!

This is an excellent frosting.  I substituted half unsalted butter and added 2 teaspoons cinnamon for a cinnamon buttercream frosting, and it was delicious!  It made a lot, too!  I frosted three cakes, each a two layer cake, and it filled and frosted all three!  (It was a three tiered cake, one nine inches, one 7 inches, one 5 inches.)  This will be my new buttercream recipe, Very good!

This is excellent buttercream. Don't make this if you're watching your weight! Instead of all shortening, I use half unsalted butter and half butter flavored shortening. I don't think it would have nearly enough flavor with all plain shortening. I've never used it for decorating, but the consistency seems perfect for piping. Half of the recipe was just enough to ice a 9 inch cake (2 layers) since I don't like a ton of frosting.

I have made so many cakes I have lost count and this is the ONLY frosting recipe I use, people love it. The heavy cream makes a big difference. I only use Crisco,not half butter...........by using ONLY shortening you will achieve more of a bakery type frosting.

This frosting is awesome!  I have made it with all Crisco as well as half Crisco and half butter.  Both ways are excellent.  I like to be very generous with my frosting and this recipe makes plenty to do just that, as well as having enough left over for a boarder, or other decoration.  This is a winner!

I made this to use on cupcakes, far far to sweet, also I did not like the texture not as smooth as other buttercreams the only reason I am giving it two stars is because my husband and his employees loved the cupcakes.  I'll stick to my regular buttercream recipes, the ones made with only real butter.

This frosting is super easy and delicious. I used half butter and half Crisco as others had suggested and the result was perfect. I added pink food coloring for my daughter's birthday cake and it was a hit! It does make way more than you'll need for one cake, but the leftover frosting is excellent spread on graham crackers! Thanks Rick!

I have made this for a birthday cake.  I made to go with the strawberry dream cake which is awesome too. 

I used trans fat free shortening (1cup) and 1 cup butter.  I used almond extract.  This is exactly the type of icing I was looking for.  It's really nice and creamy and melts in your mouth.  I'm not sure what the greasiness other posters have mentioned.  They probably did not beat it and incorporate enough air.  I whipped the butter and shortening for 10 minutes.  I can't wait until my family trys it!  I also must say  I used butter and it's a nice white.

This was ok. I'd never made a non-chocolate frosting before, and while this was good, it just didn't wow me. I used half butter and half butter-flavored Crisco shortening. The frosting just tasted more like fat and sugar than anything else, although the flavors had melded better the next day.

When I tried to make this for my daughter's 1st birthday, it ended up being so thick that it ruined my electric mixer!!  I have no idea what I did wrong, because I followed the recipe to the letter.  Any ideas/help would be appreciated, because I can't imagine there being so many wonderful reviews if it wasn't great.

Great recipe.  Very tastey and easy.  However, I did substitute 2 cups of butter for the shortening since it is a "butter" cream recipe.  This recipes is definitely a keeper.

My best friend whom is pregnant was craving a cake with buttercream frosting, so I chose this to make for her.  The frosting turned out absolutely delicious. She loved it too. She said she couldn't believe I made this cake, she bragged on how "talented" I was, lol.  Thanks for sharing Rick.

Very nice for simple frosting jobs; my rating is based on making the recipe exactly as written. For me, to make 5 stars, I substituted half of the shortening for butter.

Beat butter and shortening for 20 minutes like others suggested.  Frosting was smooth and super tasty with icing sugar amount that was stated.  Iced a 2 tiered layered cake but top was a fake layer - I would have had to make another half a batch if top layer needed crumb coat as there was barely enough to do what I did.  Will definitely make again!

Iâ€™ve made this recipe approximately 5 times now, and it is always perfect! Iâ€™ve always used a hand mixer but I just got my first kitchen aid stand mixer so you know I will be making it again soon!! The consistency is always perfect for frosting cakes, but a little thin for flowers and other decorations with volume. I have learned to add about an extra 2 cups powdered sugar to the original recipe to make a good stiff consistency. Doesnâ€™t taste quite as good, a little too sweet, but still gets great reviews!

I substituted butter for the shortening, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly as it is written. It was wonderful! I get multiple compliments every time I use it. Now, I cut the ingredients in half because it makes enough for a large sheet cake.  Thank you, Rick.

I made it with 5 cups of sugar and it was sweet enough. Was excellent for decorating my sons bday cake and spread nicely. Found it very greasy, but so is any buttercream really. Wish there was a way to make it less greasy.

Won't make this again, greasy and tasteless.     Tried to rescue it by adding chocolate, but then it was a greasy chocolate icing.  
I will go back to my go-to recipe, equal butter and cream cheese, a bit of rich whip cream, 2 c. or so icing sugar, tsp or two vanilla.

This is so good!  I made a couple tweaks recommended by someone else - used a cup less powdered sugar and replaced half of the shortening with butter.  It's perfect and not too sweet!

Good recipe- I use 1/2 - 3/4 butter and mix in cooked, strained jam for flavor and color (apricot is especially good but Iâ€™ve used apple, quince, orange marmalade etc as well). Go easy on the cream if you use this recipe as the jam will be some of the liquid, adding slowly as needed

Besides using half butter and half Crisco-type shortening, I only made HALF this recipe and it was plenty, just the right amount for a two layer cake.  I whipped it for a pretty long time, maybe five minutes.  Delicious!

I only needed enough icing to decorate edges of sheet cake, write happy birthday and add a few scroll embellishments. So I needed to greatly reduce this recipe. Read reviews and consolidated them with the following changes :  4 T salted butter, 4 T. Crisco baking stick (white, not butter since I was using white icing),  approx 2-3 T whipping cream (because I had some leftover from another recipe. I don't know how milk would work. One reviewer said cream was a must), 2 t meringue powder for stability ( I might consider bumping this up next time to 1 T), 1/2 t each almond and vanilla extract. I beat this on high with mixer for approximately 5 minutes and then added 2+ cups of sifted powdered sugar slowly while still mixing. It was very warm (think summer in Texas). Seemed a good consistency, but icing was too soft when I tried to pipe it.  I was in a hurry so put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes and it was perfect. (Maybe could have used more sugar, but refrigeration did the trick.) I decorated chocolate sheet cake, icing tasted great. I was in a hurry to finish cake for brother and sister bday, so these are close approximations. No need for excess icing so this amount was perfect with some to spare. Got great reviews from family. I did mix the heck out of it. One reviewer said 10 minutes, but I did less time with the reduced ingredients. I feel the whipping cream helped add to the volume. Hope this helps others.

I am very disaapointed in this frosting. I should have read the reviews. I made it as is. Was planning on using it for sugar cookies. I am throwing it all out. When I make cookies I want them to be delicious. This is only ok at best. Will not make again. Definetly have to use butter.

I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening - Iâ€™ve made with just shortening and I think itâ€™s to greasy tasting.  I also wanted it to be as white as possible so I added 1/2 t. Of almond extract (clear) vs the vanilla (dark).  There was only a hint of almond flavor and I only used it for piping and other decorations on a black magic  cake with Carmel frosting(1) - both from this site -  it was a huge hit.

This was my first time making frosting. It was very easy and a big hit w/ my family. I may possibly change it next time and do 1 cup shortening and 1 cup butter just to see how it will change the flavor.

This is my go-to recipe for buttercream frosting!  My only swap is that I use all real butter instead of half margarine/butter.  My family -- immediate and extended -- loves it!  I always get complements on this recipe.  It's easy to adjust the flavor and make it my own.  I recently added strawberry extract to make an amazing strawberry chocolate cake for my husband's birthday.  It's always a hit!!

Absolutely perfect frosting. I halved the recipe & substituted butter for 1/2 the shortening. Everyone commented on how light, fluffy & delicious this frosting is. Pipes like a dream.

I added a little less heavy whipping cream because I needed to pipe flowers but if you're just coating the cake, using this recipe exactly as it is should be fine. I like that the recipe isn't overly sweet. My boyfriend says it tastes so much better than the stuff on cakes from the store and he's not a frosting person. People at work like it well and the flowers I pipe keep their shape even at room temperature.

I made this using 1 stick of butter and 1 stick of Crisco instead of 2 sticks of Crisco.  I also doubt that I used 8 full cups of powdered sugar....the frosting was so hard to stir after the first 7 cups.  BUT....the good news is that this frosting is so, so much better than any I have tried.   Not bland with the right amount of sweetness!!

This frosting is wonderful with no after-taste.  I have made it many times for birthday cakes.  It's always a hit.  Thank you for posting!

I made this exactly as it stands and it is delicious. I had no greasy flavor from the shortening, the vanilla flavor was perfect, and I had enough to generously top 18 cupcakes as well as frost a 9x13 pan of brownies (after I added a cup of peanut butter to some of the frosting), and I still have enough left to probably ice a small cake or more cupcakes. It's easy to pipe, easy to frost, easy to add other flavors to, and pleasing to the eye. Follow the recipe exactly as stated and you won't be disappointed.

I made this with 1 1/2 cups of butter and 1/2 cup of crisco (name brands to matter in shortening). I loved the flavor that the whipping cream added but the crisco was a mistake. Next time it's all butter. I had to keep adding sugar and vanilla to give it some taste. If you like grocery store icing then use the Crisco. If you want a real buttercream taste then use all butter.

This is how I've always made my frosting and it's the best!  I use butter flavored shortening.  If I want a truly white frosting I use regular shortening and add butter flavor. The whipping cream really makes for a wonderful consistency. If your looking for a good buttercream frosting recipe stop looking and use this one!

This was by far the best frosting ever after you follow the modifications.... Half butter half shortening, 6 cups icing sugar. I also used 1/2 tsp almond flav, 1 tsp lemon flav and then 1 tsp vanilla. This is simply dreamy!!!

This simple recipe is a keeper! In the past the buttercream icing and the whip cream were made serperate, then combined.  This recipe was simple, quick and provided the desired results.  I loved it and will use it again and again.

Better than buttercream -- lighter and, with 5c powdered sugar, sweet but not overly. I would use 6c next time for a hint more sweetness. I also used half unsalted butter and half reg Crisco. Generously iced a two-layer cake plus 12 cupcakes with no leftovers. Seriously, I will never make regular buttercream again!

This frosting is perfect! I substituted butter for half of the shortening, but followed everything else to the letter. I frosted 48 cupcakes and had some left over. It tinted very well and tasted great. This will be my go-to frosting from now on.

I tried this with just milk as it was all I had at the time and it turned out great. I used 1/4 of the recipe and I still had enough for 30 mini cupcakes and 8 big cupcakes. I did use all butter.

Great Icing! 
but using half salted butter & half regular Crisco, 6 cups of confectioners sugar, about 4 to 5 ounces of heavy whipping cream and 2 teaspoons of pure Vanilla made it easier to work with.

I made it exactly the way described. It was blah. I will continue to use half butter and half shortening. It is a great recipe if you are looking to just use for decorating a cake with flowers, borders ect. But as a new frosting I used, most friends found it a bit bland when I used it on their cakes.

I have used this recipe many times.  As others have stated, I sub half the shortening with butter.  I beat the butter and shortening  for about 10 minutes.  I think that is the key to good frosting, although if you are piping. you may experience air pockets

I mixed this up to use on my Christmas Cookies.  I would not recommend using it on cookies, it doesn't dry so you can't stack the cookies.  After doing a few, I stuck it in the 'fridge and went back to my standard, milk, butter and conf. sugar frosting.
This looks great and is really fluffy, but it's mainly because of all the crisco.

I loved it but I have only tried it with the alternate version of using half unsalted butter and half shortening.

The difference between this recipe and other buttercream frosting is the heavy whipping cream.  It is over-the-top fantastic!  This has replaced my standard recipe that I have used for decades!

This was my first time making a buttercream frosting. I thought it was just okay. I made it to frost my daughter's birthday cupcakes. I made her six huge cupcakes and this was WAY too much frosting. I have a huge bowl of it in the fridge right now after very generously frosting her cupcakes. She and her friends loved the frosting, so I gave it 5 stars. I mixed in colorful sugars to give it some color. Just to experiment, I put some in a bowl and added Nestle cocoa to it. I actually liked it better that way. All the girls said it was good both ways. I also did not need near as much sugar. I think I ended up using about 6 cups and added about another half teaspoon of vanilla.

This frosting is very good although next time I will put a little less shortening.  I also added some pureed strawberries that I had left over from a strawberry cake I made.

Very good.  Have used this on my last couple cakes, and everyone raves about it.  I make some changes to suit my tastes - 1 C salted butter, 1 C shortening, 8 C powdered sugar, 2 t vanilla extract, 1 C heavy cream.

this recipe probably deserves 5 stars for buttercream because it WAS good... but it's just so sweet that it could easily cause a stomach ache.  however, i think all buttercreams are like this?

Great recipe. Used half shortening (Kremelta, here in NZ) and half butter and used 2 cups less icing sugar, and it turned out amazing, better than any I've made before. There were a few moments in making it that I thought "Oh no, this is going to be a disaster" because the texture went a bit weird and crumbly, but I continued on with the recipe and it turned out great...perfect for icing my sons birthday cake, it held shape very well. I will certainly use this recipe again, thank you for sharing it!

This was ok, I used the half butter and half shortening and it still tasted too much like shortening.  I may try again using either all butter or 3/4 butter to 1/4 shortening for consistency

I followed others suggestions and used the half butter and half Crisco butter flavored. I also only used 6 cups sugar. I beat the frosting at high for 10 mins. It was perfect. Great taste and firmness.

YUM!! I made eight dozen cupcakes for an opening night party for a theatre production I worked on! I made half a it yellow and the other half black. (We did The Who's Tommy) Note: If you're making black frosting with gel coloring, it will become bitter. I added two boxes of cream cheese, and it got rid of the bitter taste!

GREAT!!! I needed to quickly whip up a batch of frosting and this was great.. I did not have shortening.. I did have some margarine.. and.. I used 1/2 stick cream cheese. I used half/half and just put in the confectioners sugar until it was the correct consistency and it was 1 bag.. This recipes measurements and ratios are a good base!! If I had Crisco I would have followed exact.. this is perfect!!

Best frosting I've made so far.  I used the half butter and half Crisco like suggested by others.  It made a huge amount which is good when decorating. And it worked well for decorating and was very good. This is a keepper

I went with some of the different reviewers suggestions and used 1 c. butter and 1 c. shortening instead of the 2 c. shortening.  I also skipped the cream and used milk to reach the consistency that I wanted.  Thought it was delicious!

I'm not a frosting fan, but I'm planning on making two fondant covered cakes for a cake walk at the end of the month, so I'm testing buttercream frostings for the frosting underneath the fondant.  I proceeded to make a huge mess in the kitchen this afternoon testing this one and the Butter Cream Frosting II.  This one is too sweet for me and doesn't quite live up to the other frosting in bf's opinion.  I think we're going with the other. Thanks for the recipe!

Really yummy buttercream. I've never made a buttercream before that was so good. I had some problems piping it, so I ended up just giving up and frosting the cupcakes with a knife. This recipe makes a lot and I think I overfrosted the cupcakes a bit. The frosting can be a bit overwhelming and this past weekend it was 109 here and it was just too much sweetness for the heat. I'll make this again, only when it is a bit cooler!

The best buttercream recipe ever.  I also took the 1 cup butter/1 cup shortening route and it is delicious.  Definitely beat it for 10 minutes for the best spreading consistency - even on tricky, dense chocolate cakes. YUM!

Yep - this stuff is really good!  I followed the advice of others and used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening (buttered flavored Crisco).  Like others, I also only used 6 cups of powdered sugar, not 8. It was still plenty sweet for us.  Beat everything for a long time and you can't go wrong.  Oh, one last thing...because of the butter and vanilla, this icing has a yellow tint to it.  If you need really white icing, just add a few drops of icing whitener (basically white food coloring) and you'll have white icing.

This is so good and it is so easy to work with. The first time I made it I did not have any heavy whipping cream, so I used a 1/2 cup of evaporated milk and a 1/2 cup of sweetened condensed milk. I followed some advice of other reviewers and used half butter and half shortening (butter flavored). It was SO good, I could have just eaten it by itself. Since then I have made it with just whipping cream, and although very good, I prefer it with evaporated and sweetened condensed milk and will make it that way from now on. Thanks for such a great recipe!!

I used half butter, half shortening as others have recommended.  This was a sturdy, tasty buttercream.  I'll use it again and again!  Thanks!

This frosting was awesome!!! I used 1/2 vegetable shortning and 1/2 butter as did many people. I also haved this recipe and it was more than enough to frost 24 cupcakes!! It was a bit too sweet, but I didn't mind it much. Still very yummy and I highly recommend it!

Only rated at 4 stars because using 2 Cups of shortening gives the frosting a very greasy flavor and texture.  I would very highly recommend using 1 cup butter/margarine and 1 cup of shortening.  I also used around a half cup of milk instead of the recommended 1 cup.

I have tried different buttercream recipes and I must say, this is the one I have been looking for.  I did use half shortening and half butter though.  It tastes very good and is bakery quality.  I love the lighter texture it has.  This is definitely a keeper!

Needed a good frosting recipe to use with a boxed cake.  This recipe was a good starting point.  I've only given it 4 stars, as I did not follow the recipe exactly.  I followed others' advice and used half butter and half shortening.  I also cut the amount of sugar.  Had I made a whole batch, I would have only used 6 cups . . . but since the recipe halved well (and was plenty for a boxed cake) I only needed 3 cups.  Thanks for a good starting point!  Will make again.

Great frosting for decorating, but I can't recommend it for the flavor (even when using half shortening and half butter). The flavor and texture are reminiscent of the storebought cupcakes served at kids' birthday parties when I was a child. I'd eat one bite and discard the rest, because the frosting was heavy and greasy with shortening.

This icing in AMAZING! I modified the recipe and used 1/2 cup of butter and 1 cup or butter flavored shortening. I also added a teaspoon of artificial butter flavor. This made for a scrumptious icing. The recipe makes quite a bit and should be scaled down in planning on making only a two layer cake. However if you are going to use piping. flowers, etc. It would be more than enough, Definitely a keeper.

I have been using this frosting recipe since the first time I found it several years ago.  I used this frosting for my wedding cake (with 1/2 butter, 1/2 crisco).  It looked beautiful and everyone loved it, too.

Super!  Made half the recipe for 24 cupcakes.  Very generous topping & had about 3/4 cup leftover.  As many others I did half shortening and half butter.  I don't consider myself well-versed in the cake decorating department at all....so, I felt pretty proud of myself that I even piped the frosting on and it looked 'almost' professional!!

I didn't have any crisco so I used all butter,, and I added 2 heaping Tbl spoons cocoa. I like chocolate. It had to sit in fridge though before I could frost anything. It's soooo GOOD!! I could put it in a pan and eat it like candy. As a matter of fact, nobody around here can keep their fingers out of it. It's better the next day !!

OMG!  This is the by far the best buttercream I''ve had in a long time.  I have been looking for a good b/c frosting for so long.  I did what other used recommended and used 1/2 crisco & 1/2 unsalted butter with 7 cups powdered sugar and it was soooo fluffy and delicious.  It definitely tasted better the next day and it's also great for piping.  I will definitely use this for all my cakes.....tastes just like the bakery.  Yummy!

This was good, but too sweet for me.  I halved the recipe and used half butter/half Crisco.  If we could cut down the sugar a bit, it would be much better.

I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 butter flavored Crisco. I also halved the recipe to frost 24 cupcakes and with piping a generous amount on each cupcake; I just had enough icing. This frosting is absolutely amazing with the modifications, although it was a modification for personal taste preference so a 5 star this one gets! Perhaps, I will try the original recipe for a more bakery time taste next time. Thanks for the recipe!

My friends and I loved this frosting!  It was really rich and sweet, so a little goes a long way.  It makes a TON of frosting; I didn't know what to do with it all.  I used this to frost a white cake, and also for frosting shots when I hosted girls' game night.  Everyone loved them!  Next time I will cut the recipe in half so I won't have so much left over.  The only change I made was to use 1 cup butter and 1 cup shortening, as other reviewers have suggested.  I also used the entire 8 oz. of heavy cream, which really contributes to the rich creaminess of this frosting.  Yum!

good flavor with a few modifications - I used 6 and 1/2 cups of powdered sugar and 1 and 2/3 cup of butter and only one third cup of shortning.  I liked it best after refrigerated for a while - thanks - this one is a keeper

I've been searching for the perfect frosting and this came pretty darn close!  I did, like most others, use 1 cup shortening and 1 cup unsalted butter, only 6 cups of sugar and only 6 oz of heavy whipping cream.  I also added some cocoa to make the ultimate chocolate frosting.  It came out incredible!

This frosting was smooth and easy to work with, but it was very bland. I added mint extract, and that helped a lot. Like other reviewers, I used half Crisco and half margarine. This recipe makes a ton - half a recipe fully frosted a two layer cake including sides!

Great recipe.  I use 1 cup softened Butter & 1 cup Shortening, since it's Buttercream frosting, you need butter :o) I use less whipping cream, just add till it looks right, the more you beat it in your mixer, the fluffier it gets. Also, add some cocoa powder to the already made frosting to make the best chocolate frosting you've ever had.  I use this recipe for all the cakes I make. Everyone who tries it loves it.  Try it, it makes great frosting.

I also made it with 1 cup of shortening and 1 cup of butter. I'll have to say this is the best frosting I've ever tasted!  Fabulous!

I cannot say enough about this buttercream... if I could give it more than 5 stars, I would! It doesn't matter what kind of cake I make... I always get rave reviews about the amazing frosting! I too use half butter and half crisco and it always turns out perfect. I add different flavorings depending on what I am making... from lemon juice to orange extract or cocoa! I also used the advice of another user an whip the butter and crisco on high for 5-10 minutes and it makes it REALLY FLUFFY! I will NEVER USE A DIFFERENT RECIPE!

This is the best frosting recipe I have found. Very simple and creamy. I make it half butter half shortening when frosting cakes and all shortening for borders and decorations. The best!

This was delicious! I was "remaking" my husband and my wedding cake for our 1 year anniversary. It didnt look quite as wonderful as the bakery that we went to but it tasted wonderful. I tweaked the buttercream only by mixing in a cup of fresh raspberries. It was fabulous. Thanks so much for the recipe, I will most definately make it again for those special cakes I make!

This was a nice butter cream frosting. I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 butter & 1/2 shortening. It was very nice to work with and looked beautiful on the Cherry Cake I made. I think everyone liked the frosting much more than the cake. Thanks!

This buttercream tastes just like my wedding cake's frosting tasted!!!! 
I was looking for a buttercream to make for my first time that would be easy and taste good, well I found it!! After reading the reviews and taking the advice of many, I substituted 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening for all shortening. I also used what I had which meant using salted butter and whole milk and it still turned out fabulous! I made 1/4 of the batch as a trial run and I'll have enough to make some cupcakes today.
*I must say that this frosting was delicious last night when I made it, but the key to getting it to it's best is to refrigerate it over night. It tastes even better today.

Used 1/2 salted butter and 1/2 shortening and only 6 oz. cream.  The frosting was very good but somewhat soft, but that could be due to the weather here and the fact that I used butter too.  Once refrigerated it firmed up nicely.  Nice and fluffy, which is good except when you're trying to make a perfectly smooth surface!  Pipes well too; I used this for a wedding cake.

This is the BEST frosting.  I did 1/2 of the butter in butter and the other 1/2 in butter flavored crisco and I could not keep everyone from eating the frosting right out of the bowl.  I have already shared this recipe with others.

I too, followed other reviews and substituted half the butter for the shortening. I also used popcorn salt. It is a finer grain of salt and mixers better.Also, I added 2 tbls of merigue pwder to it to stabilize the whipped cream, i thoughtit would make it more stiff to pipe borders and flowers. I did end up using about 7 ounces of the whipping cream. I did find the frosting on the sweet side. Next time I will adjust the powdered sugar. It spread like a dream and I frosted the cake with little effort. But when it came to piping borders and flowers, I found I had to stiffen up the frosting a bit by adding even more sugar to it. Overall, a good frosting that I would use again, I would just tweak it a bit. Of course, I diddnt follow the original recipe and that could be why I had the results I did. Butter is alot softer than shortening. Everyone loved this frosting.

A nice buttercream, I used a little more butter than shortening, and a little more cream than called for. I like the taste and the texture was good overall, maybe a tiny bit chalky but with all the powdered sugar used I guess that's expected. I would use the recipe again but I'll also probably try out a few more before I declare a favorite.

And so ends my quest for the perfect strawberry frosting. I needed a fluffy yet substantial frosting for a child's birthday cake, and I modified this one in the following ways to make a great (IMO) strawberry frosting: reduced the powdered sugar slightly, substituted butter for half the shortening, substituted a couple tablespoons of pureed strawberry for a couple tablespoons of the whipping cream, and added several tablespoons of strawberry Nesquik. Also substituted a little almond extract for the vanilla. Yeah, it doesn't sound like much of the original recipe was left, but it really was a great base ... all I did was tweak it a tad based on the reviews and added my strawberry flavoring. Recommended! Will make again. Does have a fatty shortening-like feel, but it's nothing you won't find in any store-bought decorated cake frosting and so much yummier!

For decorating purposes, this was great - relatively smooth and shiny, held up well, looked great for a few days.  But, it was just lacking in taste.  I don't think that anything with that much shortening is going to be all that tasty.  I guess you just can't have the best of both worlds!  If you're looking for a nice decorating frosting that tastes okay too, this will definitely work for you!

This frosting was A-MA-ZING! The best frosting I've ever had! My husband, who doesn't LOVE frosting, was eating this by the spoonful. I used half butter, half shortening, and that was really great. Next time I I think I'll try using all shortening I think, just to see how that affects the consistency. I doubled the recipe, because we like lots of frosting, and I had a layer cake to frost and decorate (including the middle) plus a second cake to frost. Turns out I didn't need to double the recipe, because I had about almost a whole batch left! (We weren't too upset that we had to find a way to "get rid of" the remnant!) Thanks for sharing this one! It's a keeper!

Great icing, great taste and good texture. I used half butter and half shortening version. Even then, I thought at first that the shortening taste was slightly too proeminent but when was spread on the cake it was just perfect. I froze the leftovers without problem. Will certainly do again!

This icing is amazing. This is now my go-to white frosting. I used half shortening and half unsalted butter like most, but instead of using liquid vanilla extract I used white powdered vanillin and so the frosting was super white and had a really special vanilla flavor.

Perfect!  Very creamy, and unlike other readers I think the sweetness is perfect.  For the lumpy post comment, remember to add ingredients slowly and mix well.

Awesome taste and easy to work with.  
Thank you Rick!!

ive made this several times to frost chocolate cake, and it is THE best buttercream recipe. i also use half butter half shortnening like some other reviews. it seemed like a lot of sugar, so tried 6c of sugar, and i like the consistency better with the full 8c. ended up with lots of extra frosting, i put it on some white bread with some rasberry jelly. woo! guilty pleasure!

Wow!  I haven't ever been able to make frosting good before, but this is so good!  I also used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening.  Perfect! updated 6/29- This also works great to freeze.  Just thaw and stir, and if you love frosting, plop some in a bowl and eat it plain!  YUM

I threw my other buttercream recipe out after making this.  I halved the recipe, and used half butter, half shortening.  Wonderful consistency and perfect taste.  Iced a two layer cake beautifully..  I made the cookies and cream cake recipe I got from this site with this frosting for my boyfriends b-day, he LOVED it!  Thanks Rick!

The consistency and taste of this frosting were AMAZING!  I never liked the taste of my personal recipe.  It was always lacking something.  This is now the only recipe I will use for buttercream frosting. THankyou for this recipe!

There are no words to describe the deliciousness of this frosting.  Never again will I use frosting in a can.  I used 6 cups. of sugar per directions.  The consistency is just perfect for decorating.  I made 2 batches and had enough for a 12", 9" cakes, and some cups for my enjoyment while I made the cakes.

Wonderful.  Rich and creamy.  The other reviewers are right on the money about halving the recipe, though.  I was skeptical since this used shortening instead of butter, but the flavor was much nicer.

I used the shortening without butter because I needed white frosting, but I also added 1 package of cream cheese when I added the whipping cream. DELICIOUS!!!!! I had to add 16 ounces of whipping cream bc of the cream cheese, but frosting was creamy and perfect!!!! Best recipe ever.

This frosting tasted too sweet and "greasy" when I first made it, but I needed frosting that would hold up - I needed to frost a cake the night ahead of time and carry it to work in the morning.  The frosting improved in flavor overnight, it was "obedient" (for lack of a better word)while frosting the cake and held up well.   I received many, many compliments on the appearance and flavor.  I did make it with half butter/half butter-flavored Crisco.

Oh so good! An excellent frosting. I used half shortening and half unsalted butter, using only 4 oz whipping cream before consistency seemed correct. I used this to frost the "Four Egg Yellow Cake" and it was a hit.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful.  I used 1 cup butter (salted) and 1 cup shortening and didn't add the salt since the butter was salted.  Makes alot of icing.  But sooo very good.  I used it on a birthday cake and everyone raved about how good it was.  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe.  It is definitely a keeper.

Excellent!  I prepared the frosting just as the directions said and everybody loved it!  They said it was sweet, but not too sweet--- (and believe me, my family likes things sweet!!!)

I loved this, and didn't think it tasted greasy at all, and the sweetness was just right. I used 1 cup of butter flavored shortening.  I also had to use 2% milk and it turned out GREAT.  I whipped and whipped the frosting and it came out light and airy. I will definitely use this again, and maybe experiment with different flavors as another reviewer suggested.
