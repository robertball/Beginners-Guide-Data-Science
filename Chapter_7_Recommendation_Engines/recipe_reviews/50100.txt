This chili is fabulous! I have a Hungarian wax pepper plant that had three gorgeous peppers on it, and this is the recipe I decided to use them in. I substituted ground turkey breast for the beef and light Polish kielbasa to make this chili really healthy. Also, by mistake, I used Cubanelle peppers instead of Anahiem (although they are almost identical in taste). What also drew me to this recipe was the lack of salt, as we are on a very low sodium diet. I was really nervous because there was no liquid other than the vinegar, but the tomatillos and the tomatoes gave off a lot. The end result was a medium spicy, delicious chili with great flavor! I did sprinkle in some cumin after tasting, but that is just personal preference. Thank you for the recipe!

This has become one of my favorite recipes. I have made it a couple of times, each experimenting with different peppers or sausage.  I have also entered this in to chili cook-offs and won in the unique categories.  I give the recipe to anyone that asks and there are quite a few.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I was amazed while eating that I didn't need salt, and I salt my tortilla chips. I, too, substituted ground turkey for the ground beef, and used smoked polish sausage. I had to use a poblano for my 4th Anaheim pepper. May try some garden cabbage next time, also.  Served with rye bread and drank beer with it. Wonderful recipe.

i ended up buying fewer veggies than the recipe called for. i also added more tomato sauce in the end to make it more soupy. i didn't have to add any salt to the mix, but i liked it that way. i also used kielbasa mixed with turkey for a healthier version. in the end it was delish!!

Made as stated, except I added only 1/3 cup vinegar and still found it to have too much of a vinegar taste. It over-powered the other flavors. I feel this would be better with much less of vinegar or none at all. Definitely different. I brought this to work for a chili cook off and only 2 people really liked it.

Really good chili, different flavor.  I used turkey kielbasa, habaneros for the Anaheim chiles and skipped the tomatillos (we are not fans of those).  This was delicious, although not spicy.  Definitely worth trying.

This was a hit! I didn't have pimentos so I omitted them and I added a can of tomato paste to thicken it up. I also used 4 green tomatoes since I am growing tomatoes and all the peppers that the recipe asked for.  Oh I also used 1/4 cup red wine vinegar instead of regular. One of my kids thought it was the best thing I've ever made.

Excellent taste but on the mild side.  After grilling the meet; cooked it overnight in a crock pot.  Took first place in our company chili cook-off!

If you want to try a new take on chili, this is a good recipe.  However we love kielbasa, and the flavor did not come through like we hoped as it was masked by the other ingredients such as tomato and peppers.

I made this chili and it was excellent!  It isn't the traditional chili but it is amazingly good with the vinegar and a little bt of heat!  I could not find the wax peppers so I substituted sweet yellow peppers.  I also added a little extra tomato sauce at the end to create a little more broth and color.  I am keeping this one thank you!

My family LOVES this one. I have had to improvise a bit as some things are not available where we live but it is great. I exclude wax beans due to personal preference, cannot get Anaheims or tomatillos so I just use extra tomatoes. And I tend to add extra jalapeños too yummy

Awesome recipe! I’ve made it about five times now. As written has a mild heat to it. I’ve tweaked mine by adding an extra 3 habanero peppers and seasoning the ground beef with cumin. Creates a decent heat without over powering the chili.

I made this for a Polish themed dinner our group of friends was having.  Everyone loved it!  The only change I made to the recipe was that I used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  It's amazing how flavorful it is with the variety of peppers, and no spices.  I will definitely be making it again.  The only thing I would do differently is chop/dice a lot of the ingredients ahead of time, to break it up.  I tried using an electric chopper, but the didn't give a nice crisp dice, so did it all by hand.  When I commented on how time-consuming it was, my friends all said it was well worth it.

Wonderful recipe! Very flavorful. I won 2nd place at my church chili cook-off. Interesting to have such a complex rich taste without any "spices". Used long peppers and green mild chili's. Thanks for the recipe!
