I cut the recipe in half because I'm only cooking for two. I used dried shiitake mushrooms that I soaked in hot water for 30 mins, and fresh white mushrooms. I made exactly as written, except that I added a little butter after it was done. Very very good, will definitely make again.

Really good!  Really, really, really good!!! I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I used less potatoes and didn't measure out anything except one cup of broth.   Also, I didn't have any cream so I substituted it for a can of cream of mushroom soup.  I basically just threw everything together here and it was fantastic!!!  Everyone loved it.  I tossed a bit of bread crumbs on top near the end to make it crispy.  YUM!!!

Delightful! The only things I changed were to use 2 cups of half & half instead of 1 cup of cream and 1 half & half and to toss in a handful of chopped green onions. 

A great recipe, and I can't wait to try it again!

I thought this was excellent. My grocery store didn't have shitake mushrooms, so I used all button musrooms. I also only used about half as many mushrooms as the recipe called for, and was a little worried I didn't have enough. But since mushrooms have quite a strong flavor, I thought it was just perfect. It was definitely more like a fabulous scalloped potato recipe than a mushroom recipe, but that's what I was hoping for. Served it the Grecian Pork Tenderloin also from this site, which is another one of our family favorites.

Delicious!  Made it just as it said.  Used good parmesan that I grated and I think that made a difference.  Absolutely delicious...everyone wants the recipe!

My husband Loves Potatos and we all love Mushrooms.  This was great.  I did not have the thyme and I didn't put the called for amount of rosemary (didn't have it) and it was awesome.  This may even become a Thanksgiving and Christmas favorite.

I tried out this recipe for a small dinner party and it got rave reviews from everyone sitting at the table.  I used Cheddar instead of Parmesan, since this was what I had on hand, and used only sliced cremini instead of the mixture of regular and shiitake mushrooms as suggested in some previous reviews.  Very tasty!

Love this recipe. I actually only used cream and no half and half by accident, but it still turned out great.

This was a very rich dish. It was also absolutely delicious! For the first layer of cheese I did thin cut gouda with grated romano, for the second layer of cheese I did feta and romano, and the top layer was just the romano. The mixture of the three cheeses was decadent. Family members who had already eaten elsewhere found themselves having seconds. I do wish I had added more shitake mushrooms, but other than that, this dish was a big hit!

I halved this recipe since there is only two of us and I did make one change. As others mentioned, shiitake's are expensive so instead of using the 12 ounces the halved recipe called for, I used 6 ounces and replaced the remaining 6 ounces with baby bella's. This turned out great! Very impressive and a must try for the mushroom lovers out there. If the dish you are using ends up being pretty full like mine was, I recommend putting a cookie sheet underneath to catch the overflow.
