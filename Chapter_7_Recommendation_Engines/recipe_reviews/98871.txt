I am always looking for a healthy option and this was great!  I made it as called for but made smaller burgers using only 1 ib ground turkey and just slightly less spice than called for to adjust for the missing meat.  What a hit!  cooking them in the skillet was fast and easy (usually everything is on the grill)  I used whole wheat pitas, cut them into fourths and filled with baby spinach leaves and the chutny!! Everyone loved them and the spice combo was terrific!  I made these for my girlfiends and next time I'll try adding baby arugala and red onions to the pita with the burger!

This was great! My son, who hates spinach, rated it 7.5 (on a scale 1-10). I grilled the burgers, instead of cooking in pan. I couldn't find mango chutney, so we used peach preserves...it was yummy!

Great recipe!    It is very nice.  We didn't have the mango chutney, so topped it with Apricot jam.  It was delightful.
