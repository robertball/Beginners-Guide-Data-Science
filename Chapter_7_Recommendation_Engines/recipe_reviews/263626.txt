10.14.19  Used this as a dipping sauce for coconut shrimp.  I did heat it up stovetop just to thin out a bit for a better dipping consistency.  Couldnâ€™t really taste the rum, the orange marmalade dominates, and I added a bit more soy sauce to suit our personal taste.  Flavorful, quick and easy to make with ingredients I always have on hand.
