Welp, guess I liked this better than most folks.  Despite what seems like a lot of steps, I didn't find it too difficult to make.  Or maybe it just depends on what kind of steps you hate to do.  (Me, I hate peeling and chopping stuff up.)  I original put a 4 on this, made it again and didn't like it as well, but also admit I didn't beat the egg whites very well the second time, so apparently that's important.  I liked it, but do agree there's not much to it, and I felt it necessary to eat 2, so more like 3 servings if you ask me.  Something a little different anyway.

Ho hum... not much to talk about here.  I increased the mustard to 1 t., added 1/2 t. of minced garlic, used 2 egg whites & added a few slices of canadian bacon on top of the bread - still too much work for too little reward.  IF I made it again, I might double the eggs  & use all the whites, & double the cheese (plus my other additions) for 6 pieces of bread.  Then it might be better.

I made this recipe last night for my daughter (11) and I.  It was quick and didnt taste too bad, but it was very bland.  I probably wont make it again.

I really breezed through this one!  It hit the spot and everyone loved it.  I imagine you might add a tad more mustard if you think it is too bland.  We liked it just as it was.  Jeanie Bean

A lot of "fuss" with very poor results.  Was not one that I would do again.

Definitely wonderful...and what fun to eat too. I have found a new and easy treat for a Sunday brunch that even the kids enjoyed. If the recipe sounded good to you, then try it. I read all the other reviews after I had eaten this and can't believe them. The flavours are nice and delicate, yet spicy. Method is pretty straightforward even though I would toast the bread on both sides the next time. Adjust the cayenne for your audience, I even made one extra spicy batch for the adults. I left out the salt and butter. Thank you for the recipe.

Sorry.  I thought, since the main complaint was blandness, I could make this work.  But it wasn't good, nor beautiful.  Mostly weird.
