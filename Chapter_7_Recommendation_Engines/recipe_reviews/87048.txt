This is an excellent recipe EXCEPT I would recommend cutting the steak against the grain on the diagonal into several strips before cooking it. For me when I cook the flank steak whole I end up with burned edges and the middle not done enough.  Cutting into strips allows you to give everyone the degree of doneness they want.

This is an wonderful recipe. I followed advice given by Tess and cut the steak against the grain on the diagonal into several strips before cooking. Without a doubt, the is the best Flank steak ever made in my house. Thanks for sharing a great recipe

this steak would have been far more tender if it had been marinated in some oil and wine or wine vinngar.  
There was not much taste to it and I would have used a greater selection using Oregano and a lot more garlic.

This recipe was great.  If I could, I would give it 4.5 stars because I did add 1 tsp. ground red pepper and 1 T. of Emeril's Essence.  I did not cut the steak into strips prior to cooking as this can really dry the meat.  Instead, I just set my broiler on a medium broil, and cook it 11 minutes on both sides.  Cooking it this way makes it come out a perfect medium rare.  If your steak is getting burnt around the edges then you are cooking it too close to the broiler or at too high of a setting.

Fabulous!  I will defintely serve this again...with my additions though.

Tasty, quick and reasonable number of ingredients. I toasted the spices first since I used whole coriander and cumin, then ground them with my pestle. Not too spicy, but good flavor.

great mix of spices.  i couldn't find flank steak, so we used loin bottom...still great.  i added a touch of rice wine vinegar to marinate better.  i also doubled the spices because we love it spicy.  and since our broiler has a mind of it's own, we sauteed in the skillet.  the mix of spices is great.  we'll definately use this again.

This was good. For our tastes, I didn't find it quite spicy enough the first time I made it, so when I made it again, after the spice rub, I spread a thin layer of dijon mustard over one side.  Turned out good, next time I will add some chlli powder into the spice rub as well.

I did everything exactly as recipe stated and it came out horribly bland! I ended up frying it up on the wok and adding sugar and extra cayenne to make it even edible.

I like this recipe because I dont always have time to worry about marinating. Next time I will add some olive oil to the spices. I cooked the steak in the broiler on med & only cut it into three peices, so it wasnt to dry. It was good.

This was absolutly delicous!  Although, I agree with many others that they could be a bit more spicy.  I added a little crushed red pepper flakes but didnt want to go overboard before trying them with a little, but next time I will add more. Also, I added just a couple table spoons of oil to the bag with the steaks at the beginning before putting the seasoning in and I think that helped to hold the spices better and make them a bit more moist when broiling.  all in all this was an awesome recipe and I will deffinatly be using it again!

Excellent recipe for fast, easy school night fare.  I too wanted more zip so I added cardamom and onion powder. Do not cut the meat and it stays far juicier. I bet this would go great with some yellow curry too.  I also advise grinding your own whole cumin seeds (I use a magic bullet) as they have a better flavor.  Overall this is a recipe we keep using because my kids love it.

This was fast, simple and tasty.  I put the steak over a bed of lettuce, added some french fries, cheddar cheese and ranch dressing.  It was a great dinner salad!

As others said, this is not spicy at all - I too added some ground red pepper to it.  I followed recipe exactly and also the cooking time and it  came out perfectly for medium rare.  I let it sit for 10 min. before slicing and this turned out to be the most tender and juiciest flank steak I have ever prepared.  I don't know if it was the meat itself or the combination of these spices.  I will try this again to see.

I coated the flank steak lighty with olive oil.  I used garlic powder and Julio's Seasoning instead of salt.  It needed salt.  I like that this dry marinade is ready in 20 minutes.  Most flank steak recipes using marinade require 8 hrs. or more.  I will make this again.a

It was ok. Flavors were there but the dry rub provided a texture that we didn’t love.

For me it was too sweet. I added some red pepper but not enough, apparently. Couldn't counter the coriander. I saw several reviews suggest a liquid to help keep it moist - so I added 1/4 C of soy sauce which was good. 5 minutes was perfect for the grill. If I make this again I will change the spices to more of a "spicy" than this.

There is nothing in this recipe that would actually cause this to be named "SPICY frank steak"... so I added red pepper flakes. It came out very delicious. We dipped in ranch, but next time we'll try blue cheese. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it was missing a spicy element that I had to add myself. Thanks, though! I'll make it again.

I bought the Flank steak and before I froze it I rubbed it down with the seasoning.  After thawing it I broiled 4-5 min each side. Let it rest, Cut the flank steak across the grain in 1/4-inch slices.  YUM, even our picky 14 year old wanted more.
