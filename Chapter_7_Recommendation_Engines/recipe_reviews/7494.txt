Thought making this in three layers was too much work, so put in a 9x13 pan. Came out just great, and much simpler. Was a very moist tasty cake. Took to work & was a big hit with everyone. Will Definitely try again!!!

I can't get enough of this cake. Everytime I bake it I add something different. Coconut, currants, walnuts, raisins. Also, I only use 2 cups of brown sugar and 3/4 cup of oil.

Fantastic!  Everyone loved it.  I made it in a 13"x9" pan instead of 3 layers and it baked up moist & delicious.  It's a new family favorite.

I loved this cake.  Made it for my brother-in-law's birthday and it was a hit.  I made a few adjustments.  I cut the sugar to 2 1/2 cups and used turbinado sugar.  I added 1 1/2 cups of currants.  And instead of the cream cheese frosting, I glazed it when cooled with a simple glaze (1 cup powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 2 tablespoons milk, and 2 teaspoons vanilla).  I made it in a 9x13 pan instead of layers and it came out beautifully.  I had to bake it longer (I think about 55 minutes).  It was a fantastic recipe.  Thanks Suzzane!

This was the best zucchini cake I've ever had and the cream cheese frosting is to die for!  I made it in a 13x9" pan and increased the baking time to approx. 55 min.  Greasing and flouring the pan is key to avoid sticking - good advice!

OMG! This cake is soooo good. I followed another reviewer's advice and used 2 cups brown sugar instead of 3 cups white sugar and 3/4 cup oil instead of 1 1/2 cups oil. BEST CAKE EVER. The brown sugar carmelizes on the top and sides of the cake and is delicious.  I used a 9x13 pan sprayed with pam and floured. I baked it for 55 min. In the frosting I used 1 tablespoon of strong black coffee instead of vanilla (like my mom and grandma always did). Everyone LOVED this cake! Thanks for the great recipe.

I love this cake and so did my family. 
It freezes beautifully.  I made extra and froze in single serving sizes so it's easy to go for lunches etc.  It's great with or without cream cheese frosting.   I do find there is alot of sugar though and will try to substitue some of that. 
Awesome cake. thanks

Easy to make, cake stayed moist. My worker said that it was the best thing I've ever baked. I just made it using a 9x13 pan versus 3 9" rounds.. required a longer baking time, but well worth it!

I've made this many times and I get asked for the recipe every time.  I replace the oil with applesauce and it turns out very moist and it's so much healthier! I love it so much that I'm going to freeze some zucchini, so I can make this all year!!

Sorry to say this was not a favorite for me.  Pans were sticky and hard to remove.  Cake too sticky and doughy.  Thanks anyway.

Will review again after tasting, but wanted to mention that if you make it in a 13x9 pan, you have to bake it for 1 hour, not 25 minutes.

The cake is awesome and so moist! Way too much sugar though. I cut it down to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup of honey and it was plenty sweet. You could probably even do without the honey.

Just love this cake.  I make the cake exactly as stated.  But I make the frosting with brown sugar (1 cup) instead of the powdered sugar.  It takes a bit longer, you have to cream the butter, add vanilla & brown sugar, beat until brown sugar disolves & isn't grainy, then beat in cream cheese until fluffy & smooth.  It has a caramel taste to it & is so good.  Top with chopped walnuts & it's as pretty as it is good.  Thanks for sharing.

MUST TRY! I give this cake 4 stars only because I didn't get to taste the cake myslef. I made this cake and took it to a potluck picnic and it was gone before I was even able to get a piece! I've never gotten so much compliments on a dish. Everyone loved it and several people asked for the recipe. I followed the recipe to the T except I added 1/2 cup each of baking raisins and chopped walnuts at the end with the zucchini and I also added about 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the cream cheese frosting. Which I did get to try and it was fabulous! Will definatley keep this recipe around.

I followed the ingredients in this recipe exactly and my family LOVED it. There is no zucchini taste at all!! It reminds me of an apple cinnimon cake. Moist and delicious. I baked it in a 13x9 at 330 for 1 hour.

I realized I only had 2 cups of flour and improvized the measurements.  My husband LOVED it!  I made it too in a 13x9 pan and cooked it for an hour.  very moist.  I noticed reviews that said that it was doughy and yes it is if you are expecting a "springform" cake.  This is like a bread recipe and the flavor is GREAT!  I loved the cream cheese frosting!  YUM!  Not too sweet!  Thanks again!

I made this cake with left over spaghetti squash- no difference in taste but I did cook it first to make it shredable in the microwave for 15 minutes.  1/4 of a large squash was enough.  Cut sugar to 2c.  Oil was  1c and 1/2c applesauce.  I also added raisins, no idea how much maybe a cup or so.  Baked in IKEA silicone round cake set (1 is small maybe 5" and other is made closer to 9") and a glass rectangle pan (don't know dimensions but smaller than 9x13).  Baking time was off for all three,  by about 15 minutes (more).  Tasted great!  I skipped frosting and just powdered sugar sprinkled over the top.  Very moist, rose well, held its shape, raisins added very nice flavor.  Next time I might add extra cinnamon, allspice, or cloves.  Will try cranberries.  Yum!

A great cake recipe.  My family loved it.  I used a 9 X 13 baking dish.  The cake took a lot longer than 25 minutes (I think it was about 1 hour) to cook.

What a hit! I loved how easy this cake was to make, and my family loved to eat it. My youngest son who will not eat zucchini devoured this cake faster than anybody! 
I shredded a little bit more than 3 cups zucchini (about 3 1/2) so I added it all and just added a bit of Penzey's Dutch Process High Fat Cocoa (about 2 or 3 Tbsp) to balance the dry and wet ingredients. My cake was very fluffy and beautiful. Everybody loved it!!!

I made this for my boyfriend for his birthday and after we had our fill, he brought the rest to work with him.  All his buddies raved and we thought it was great, too.  I did as many others did and used the 9x13 pan plus I added some cinnamon to the frosting as well.  Very dense, moist cake.

This is the perfect zucchini cake in every way.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I had to cook mine about 40 minutes on 350, to get it firm.  By far the best zucchini cake recipe ever.

This recipe makes a HUGE cake!! It was very good but was to rich and sweet for my family. I think I will try this recipe again but put them into cupcakes instead.

Best cake and so easy.  I baked it in a 9 x 13 glass baking dish and had to add some more time.  It is the best recipe for Zucchini Cake in my opinion.

Great recipe.  I did change a few things.  I cut the sugar down to 2 cups, the oil down to 3/4 cup, and increased the cinnamon to 3 teaspoons.  I baked it for 45 minutes.  It turned out very moist...and it is alot like carrot cake!! Awesome cream cheese frosting recipe.

This was a very good recipe, and why is it that Jillian is here looking at me while I am writing this very sweet fattening review.  I did not follow the recipe exactly, because there was one person possibly the poster of the recipe that mentioned it was like carrot cake, which gave me a brain storm to add 1 Cup of carrots and 2 Cups of zucchini.  Worked very well I might add.  I did not add all of the oil, I used 1-1/4 cups. You could probably get away with only 1 cup of oil maybe less than that even.  who knows.  And I only had 3/4 tsp vanilla, so that is what I used.  I could not tell the difference.  I also added 3 tsp. of cinnamon.  But other than that, I did the same 3 pan system, but it took my oven about 55 minutes at 325 and it was not over cooked.  Anyhow, it was all I could do to keep myself from eating the cake without frosting.  Since I am not a frosting fan anyhow.  They looked so moist sitting there waiting to cool.  Wow!!  And they certainly were delicious even with frosting. Next time, I think I will follow the recipe to a tee, and then not use the cream cheese in the frosting, and make more of a whipped cream cool whip type frost.  Thanks for the recipe, it is definately a keeper.

Moist & Delicious! I have made this recipe several times (zucchini season) and I have excellent results every time. I like to use my bundt pan, so I bake it at 350 for 80 minutes. My six year old begs for this recipe on a regular basis.

Yummy!  Cut down the oil to 1 cup and used 1 cup whole wheat flour.  Also cut back the sugar to 2 cups.  Made half of much frosting and only frosted in between the layers and on top.  All this cut the fat and sugar down a lot.  And it still turned out great.  So, thanks for the basic recipe that was easily modified.

Even my picky kids loved this!  (Zucchini? yuck!....until they tasted it!) I reduced sugar to 2 1/2 c. and reduced oil to 1 cup, and added bit of ground flax seed. Baked in 9 x 13 for 1 hour. Great!

I tried this in the 9x13 pan as mentioned in some of the reviews.  Because it's so heavy and rich (and delicious) I had to bake it about twice as long to get the middle done.  Next time I would bake it in a tube or bundt pan.  I think it would bake better.  But it really is a delicious cake.  Next time I might substitute some applesauce for some of the oil and add some chopped nuts!  Can't wait for zucchini season to come again!

Made this cake using 2 cup brown sugar and 1 cup oil;  added 2/3 cup coconut.  Baked it in one 8" square pan and one 8" round pan for giving to a friend.  Delicious cake.  I might try some of the other modifications that other readers have suggested.  I do think there's too much sugar and oil in original recipe.  Time to cook was longer - between 45-50 minutes.  My husband loved it.

This was a great cake.  Very moist as others have said.  I am a first time Zucchini Cake maker and I was not sure how to prepare the zucchini so I peeled it and stayed clear of the seeds when crating the zucchini.  I picked the sierving size of 12 and it made a square pan and a small rectangle pan.  My aunt said to make the following changes next time.  Only use 1/4 c butter vs 1/2 cup and 4 oz of creame cheese vs 8.  It was great my 9 year old son loved it and he is not a sweet eater but he loves his veggies!

I made this recipe( added 1 Cup chopped walnuts) and poured it into petite loaf pans. It is fantastic! So moist, not sweet, not tart, just right. Walnuts make it even better.Thanks for the recipe.

This is my new favorite cake! I baked it in a 9x13" pan for 43 minutes, and it came out perfect! Next time I may only use 2.5 cups of sugar. Use the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe. Seriously, this cake is amazing!!!

Baked in a 9x13 pan.  Needed to bake for more like 45 minutes.  I also turned up the heat to 350.  Very moist.  Delicious.  I made it easier by using a can of cream cheese frosting from the store = less overall calories/fat.

This cake is absolutely delicious! I did change one thing though, the sugar, tooo sweet at three cups. I did 2 and 1/4 cups (3/4 cup less) and it was so moist , had a great rise . I think I'll try shredded carrots next time- I've used up all my zucchini!

It looked kind of weird on top during/after baking, which didn't really matter since I was frosting it.  I followed the recipe as written, except I substituted half applesauce for the oil.  I couldn't wait to cut into this, so I frosted it while it was still warm and cut a big piece.  Yum!  Found myself going back for more.

DELICIOUS!!  I often make this at home and just made this for my restaurant to rave reviews.  A great basic recipe that is incredibly moist and long-lasting that can be dressed up for fine dining or made at home for an everyday treat.  I like to garnish with candied zucchini strips rolled into "flowers".

Made this for my parents (and myself!)  They loved it so much they want to make another one tonight!  I scaled it down to 8 servings and put it in an 8x8 square glass dish to bake and it came out great!  I am doing the same recipe but with pumpkin this time!

This was GREAT!  I scaled down the recipe to get a two-layered cake.  It was easy and tasted wonderful and moist.  My husband said our friends were SWOONING over it!  ps most of them are Triathletes and *picky* about what they will eat!

Awesome. best zucchini cake ever. Great cream cheese icing.  I replaced one cup of white sugar with half cup brown sugar. not sure if that made any difference. just trying to be accurate for my own memory. I also used roughly 4 cups zucchini and apple sauce in place is oil.

Really great cake. It's just as good if you use 2 cups sugar and less oil. If you're worried about it not being as moist, add extra zucchini

This was DELICIOUS!!!!  My 5 stars is for the cake only, since I used canned cream cheese frosting (I know, I know).  But oh my goodness... this was moist and tasty with perfect sweetness.  Made the cake exact to recipe.  Kids loved it and co-workers too.  This one's a keeper and I will make again and again.

I  have found  the ultimate zucchini cake recipe with a cream cheese frosting to match.  I used a 9 x 13" pan to simplify things.  I substituted butternut squash for the zucchini but halved and microwaved it first to soften.  My husband dislikes squash in any form but returns for seconds of this delicious cake.

The only two things I did different, as suggested a dash of cinnamon in the (TO DIE FOR) frosting, and baked at 325 for 55-60 minutes. Dense, rich, moist amazing cake! I'll use the frosting recipe for multiple deserts-and I don't
eat frosting! Everyone loved this even our 10 yr old daughter that ONLY likes cosmic brownies for desert. Will make this a LOT!!!

Used 1/2 white whole wheat and 1/2 white flour.  Used 4 cups zucchini.  Used 2 cups brown sugar and only 1 cup of oil.  I added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  With the advice of another, instead of the cream cheese frosting, I glazed it when still warm with a simple glaze (1 cup powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 2 tablespoons milk, and 2 teaspoons vanilla). I made it in a 9x13 pan instead of layers and baked for about 50 minutes.  Wonderful!

Fantastic recipe! All I had was a 13x9 pan and there was enough batter for that plus a bit extra so poured the rest into a smaller pan. The cake was so  moist I could have gotten away with just a dusting of powder sugar on it but I went with a vanilla frosting. All 5 kids and the husband loved it. Going to make some more and trying freezing some for the winter. This is a keeper for sure!!

Tasted great! Because I baked it all in one pan, I had to crank up the heat and leave it in the oven for over an hour.

This is a good cake, but nothing spectacular.  I thought it tasted like a frosted zucchini muffin.  We used vanilla frosting since that is what we had but I think the cream cheese would have been better.  Good, easy cake but I probably would make something else next time.

We enjoyed this cake.  I used a 9*13 pan, and like other reviewers found that it took much longer to cook than stated.  I cooked it at 340 for 60 minutes.  The cream cheese frosting gave it that ‘carrot cake’ feeling.  I too reduced the sugar to 2 ½ cups and increased the cinnamon to 1 T – it was moist and tasty.

This was so delicious! I made this in a 9x13 pan like other reviewers and it came out great.  I also decreased the sugar to 2 1/2 cups. It is very much like carrot cake.

Like other reviewers, I made a 9 x 13 cake instead to take to a party. The hosts are big carrot cake fans and since I had plenty of garden zucchini, I thought it was a great combo. I used only 2/3 cup of oil, the rest applesauce.
Very moist cake, sticky and a bit doughy. The main problem was that it was fine...but, nothing special. Not a lot of flavor, not at all exciting. My husband ate it, but said he'd rather have something else next time.

The batter was extremely thick, gooey, and difficult to manage.  Especially transferring into pans.  From the oven, the cake seemed undone.  It was hard to remove from the pans, but once all was assembled with the frosting...it was fabulous!  My family couldn't stop raving about it.  Very moist and delicious.

I change the recipe by using 2 cups of sugar and 4 pitted dates that I pulverized in a food processor.  3 cups of sugar just seemed like too much sugar.   I also only used 1 cup of oil and it is still very moist.   For the frosting, I added about 6 oz of melted white chocolate which sent this zucchini cake over the top with great flavor.

Excellent. Very moist! I added 1 1/2 cups of roasted pecans and baked it in one large rectangular cake pan. I didn’t grate the zucchini but instead chopped it with a knife into small pieces. It took longer to cook because of the larger pan but it turned out delicious! And cutting rather than shredding made no difference at all.

Based on a few other reviews, I only made two changes - 2 cups of brown sugar & 1 cup of oil.  It was SO delicious!  A nice change from my typical chocolate zucchini cake and texas chocolate zucchini sheet cake.  Will bake making this again!

I made it and followed the recipe precisely. For me it was on the dry side. I was trying to improve on a similar recipe that i have. The flavor is good and we will eat it but it isnt moist at all.

This was the most DELICIOUS cake I have ever made in my life!! I only made a few adjustements, about half the sugar this recipe called for 3 cups...i put in 1.5...and less sugar and vanilla in the frosting. It would have been waaaay to sweet otherwise. Thanks for this. I made with all organic ingredients and zucchini from my garden.

I made this for a family cookout and everyone loved it!  The only substitution I made was that I used a gluten free flour blend (several of us have celiac disease) and added an  extra pinch of baking powder.  It was amazing!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Can't say I like how the cake turned out. Being that it's a zucchini cake, it was very moist (zucchini in and of itself is very moist), but the cake was a bit too sweet and completely stuck to the pans. I let them cool for the suggested time in pan before trying to remove them but they ended up breaking into multiple pieces. It might not be pretty because of this, but it still tastes good.

The frosting came out as more of a glaze than frosting, but it was still great! A bit sweet, though.

I made this cake without any changes,and it was delicious.Was easy to make, and very moist..Make sure you grease and flour the pans  or line the bottom of the pans with parchment paper which is what  I did. With the use of both zucchini and blueberries it makes a wonderful summertime dessert.

Delicious! Made it exactly as written, except I made 1 1/2 times the amount of frosting for a thick layer because who doesn't go crazy for cream cheese icing!  I also had to scoop out about 1 and 1/2 c. batter from the 9x13 pan I was using because it would have overflowed in the oven.  I put the extra batter in a little pyrex bowl and made a mini cake with that after the big cake was finished baking, which took about 55-60 min. The small cake took 25-30. The cake was not "doughy" at all, as a few reviewers mentioned. It is a dense cake very similar to zucchini bread. My 12 yo granddaughter begged for it for her birthday cake and LOVED it!

I love this recipe! I usually make it in one 9x13 Pyrex dish (adjusting the time accordingly, 40-45 min or til a toothpick comes out clean) and make the following changes: sub in one cup of brown sugar for one of the cups of white, and for the icing, you really only need 3/4 - 1 cup powdered sugar to really bring out the flavor of the cream cheese. It still spreads just fine. I've made this that way about five times now and it's definitely a crowd-pleaser. Sometimes I add walnuts, but honestly (and given the price of nuts these days, thankfully) it's just as tasty without.

I really liked this cake but made a few changes so that's why I gave it 4 stars. I made a few changes along with the cinnamon as written I also added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp allspice. Instead of 1 1/2 C. of oil I substituted 1/2 C applesauce along with 1 c of oil and I used 2 C sugar instead of 3 C sugar. I made cupcakes and frosted with cream cheese frosting .  Delicious!

Very moist! I made the following changes, which worked well:
2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour instead of 3 cups all purpose.
2 cups of Splenda instead of 3 cups of sugar.
I chose to make 22 cupcakes and baked them for 20 minutes.

Cake is delicious! So moist!  I did use olive oil and apple sauce substituting for vegetable oil.... Also if making in 9x13 pan it takes 55-60 minutes to make. Next time I'm going to try without icing because it's great by itself

Used 2 of the cups of whole wheat  flour and 1 cup of white flour. I used olive oil aND cut it down to 1.5 cups of oil and 1.5 cups of sugar. I added 3/4 cup chopped walnuts also. Very moist and yummy but the icing is what makes it great. Baked in 13x9 pan and baked for 55 minutes. Great way to use up zucchini from the garden.

this is the best I've found.  I decreased the sugar to 2 1/3 cup sugar.  I love sugar and 3 cups is to much.  I make it into 24 cupcakes and 1 round cake pan.

I was making this cake as a birthday request.  It's way too sweet.  Very dense and heavy. Anyway, used two 9x13 pans and the rest for  cupcakes.  It's ok, but not what I'd hoped.  Thanks for the recipe.

Tastes just like carrot cake! If you have a vitamix or ninja, use it to grate your zucchini. I have a vitamix and used setting 4 and they were grated to perfection. Did use some brown sugar in place of white sugar and the taste was very rich! My four kids had no idea that cake was packed full of our garden zuchinni! Will make again.

This cake went with me to a birthday party and I brought back an empty pan, with requests for more!!  In my opinion, the recipe has too much oil in it, but that seems fairly common.  I used a lemon glaze rather than frosting, and loved it.  Thanks for another great recipe.

Very moist & delicious cake!  Everyone loved it!  Very similar to carrot cake.  Delicious with our without the frosting!  The grand-kids went nuts for it!  They don't need to know it's healthy!  Wink, wink!  (made in a 9x13 pan instead of 3 separate pans, came out great)

What a great cake! I substituted the cinnamon for chocolate chips (my son loves chocolate) I didn't make the frosting this time thought with the chips might be too rich. The cake was great and my son didn't complain about the veggie! Thank you!!!

FANTASTIC!!
Made this for a birthday at work for co-worker.Grated the zucchini and then squeezed out the excess liquid.I also cut down the sugar to 2 1/2 cups and added and x-tra teaspoon of vanilla.
Heres the added bonus--The guy wanted my german choc topping on the cake--IT WAS WONDERFUL!!!
Think I'll save the cream cheese frosting for my carrot cake! !
PS---try putting parchment in pans to avoid heartache in removing the cakes

This is a decent recipe, not my favourite. I found the cake to be doughy. I added a pinch of nutmeg, and black coffee instead of the vanilla. I baked it in a 9x13 pan and it nearly took an hour to cook. The cream cheese icing however is spot on.

I loved this recipe.  I made a couple of substitutions to make it a little healthier. I substituted one of the cups of flour for ground up oats which I just ground in my food processor.  I used one cup of apple sauce and only 1/2 cup of coconut oil. I also used one cup of brown sugar in place of one of the cups of white sugar. I skipped the frosting all together and it turned out amazing.

This a such an amazing recipe for all those garden zucchini. I made it in a regular cake pan so it took longer to bake but Sooooo yummy. My husband absolutely loved it.

Made it like the recipe calls for except I made it a 9X13 pan which took baking much longer but it was well worth it. My husband and I LOVED it. I also to some to work and to my sister. They all really liked it, in fact my OM even said it was probably the best she has ever had. I plan to make it again and take it to my family reunion. Thanks for sharing a great recipe

Delicious!!!! I wanted a snack cake so used the 9x13 pan and omitted frosting---used a dollop of whipped cream. My family loved it!!! It is a great spur of the moment cake!! Thanks for the recipe!

I made half the batch recipe, I added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg & 1/4 teaspoon allspice.
Bake for 45 mins.
I call mine zucchini Spice cake, used cream cheese frosting.

Very moist cake.  I halved the recipes and baked it in one pan. It really doesn't need the frosting, sweet and moist straight out of the oven! Thanks.

I love this recipe! It is comparable to my carrot cake recipe.  I found the frosting to contain the same amount of cream cheese, butter and vanilla as the recipe that I always use so I increased the powdered sugar to 5 to 6 cups.  It makes more, and makes it taste like bakery frosting.  It is delicious.  Still tastes like cream cheese!

We made it in the 3 round pans--then halved the frosting recipe.  We frosted 2 layers (only the tops--not the sides) and kept the 3rd layer separate for someone who doesn't like frosting.  This was a perfect solution for us and yummy without being too sugary.  What a great treat!  We are making it again tonight!
