Really Good! I left out the white sugar and they are still really sweet.  I also left out oil and added 1/4 cup more pumpkin.  Great results, my PICKY 5 year old loved them. Will surely make again!

This is a very healthy, great tasting pumpkin bread. I left out the oil and it turned out great.

I love the premise of this muffin, and it is so easy to make healthier! (which I did, I customized the recipe a tad) in place of the oil, I upped the pumpkin/applesauce to equal the amount of oil that would have been used. I omitted the white sugar and just used 3/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar. Also added 2 tbsp ground flax seed....VERY yummy, moist muffin - I used paper liners though and should have heeded others saying to just grease a tin and head that way, as half the muffin was stuck to the liner and I had to eat that part in a not-so-lady-like-way :) oh well, only the cat was home to witness it :D I love the flavours of this muffin and will be making these OFTEN! Thanks for the great recipe! ** Edit ~ upon waiting till the next day, the muffins did not stick to the paper liners, must have been because they were warm right out of the oven - GOOD STUFF! :D

I've been wanting to make pumpkin muffins for over a week now and I finally decided on these because they are healthier than all the ones I've been eyeing, my conscience was reminding me Thanksgiving is two days away.  These were great and I will definitely make these again!  Instead of the raisins I added Craisins.

Delicious muffins. I took the advice of other reviewers and left out the white sugar. They would have been too sweet with it. I used cranberries instead of the raisins and pecans. They complemented the pumpkin very well.

Great recipe! I used only half the recommended oil and applesauce for the other half. Also, used the buttermilk substitute. This makes better mini-loaves than muffins. I couldn't get them to cook evely as muffins, but the mini-loaves turned out very nicely.

I love these muffins... the only thing that i do differently is substitute mashed banana for the applesauce. Also, make sure you put them in a sealed container as soon as they come out of the oven so they retain their moisture. Sooo good!

These are sooooo good. My 1 year old and 10 year old both loved them. I love that this recipe is 100% whole wheat and still very moist. Often times whole wheat baked goods can be dry but these are very moist. I substituted splenda for the sugar.

When I was a kid a muffin was a very slightly sweet breakfast bread. Over the course of my adulthood, thanks to Perkins and Hostess, the definition has shifted to embrace anything that is baked in a muffin tin, and the closer it comes to the texture and sweetness of cake, the more we seem to rave about it. So, that said ... these are very tasty concoctions, but they aren't muffins. They're cupcakes. I still use the recipe but I only use 1 egg and I cut the sugar DRASTICALLY. When you've got applesauce and raisins in the recipe, you can use a mere 1/4 cup of brown sugar and still get very sweet muffins by pre-Perkins standards. (Again, think of bread, not cake.) I also use whole wheat pastry flour so that they are less dense, but without the high sugar content, the texture is still truer to that of a traditional muffin.

healthy, delicious muffins. I have added all pumpkin when I was out of apple sauce and they turned out just as tasty. I love the way you can add many changes to this, my last baking of these muffins, I decreased the sugear by 1/2 cup and added butterscotch chips. These are so good!!!

Great recipe.  My two year old and hubby definitely appreciated it!  I followed the recipe except for using fresh mashed pumpkin rather than canned and walnuts instead of pecans.  It came out wonderful and a nice treat that is on the healthier side.  Thanks for the recipe!

I am challenged in the baking department-- but these muffins were a hit! Everyone loved them-- even the toughest critics! And I took someone's advice and nixed the oil and they were right- the muffins still came out moist and delicious. I also added some cinnamon to the tops of the muffins. MMM!!! Great!!

I made mini-muffins, added a streusel topping, and took it to a Bible study where they flew out of the basket! Made them with pear puree in place of the pumpkin and applesauce. I also used self-rising flour (left out the baking powder, soda, and salt), cinnamon and nutmeg in place of the pumpkin pie spice, more brown sugar than white, and left off the raisins and pecans. It's great to have a delicious, versatile recipe that allows for substitutions.

I did increase the baking soda to a full teaspoon, cut the salt back by half and I added a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract. I did up the raisins to a full half cup only because I was out of pecans. I did soak the raisins in the buttermilk (I warmed it slightly before doing so) just so that the raisins would be a little plumper. I don't know why but for some reason, this recipe did need a little more wet ingredients. When folding the dry into the wet, it just needed a little more so I added a scant 1/3 cup more buttermilk. These turned out quite moist and were great for using the little bit of homemade pumpkin puree and homemade applesauce I had in plastic containers in my fridge. Next time, I'd like to try this with all pumpkin. I got 12 large muffins out of this recipe. 350 degrees for a little over 20 minutes was just right for me.

These were outstanding. I've made them three times now...one time with more applesauce substituted for oil and the other times used recipe as written.  BOTH were moist and delicious. Everyone loved them.
Really watch them as they bake. The first time I let them cook too long and the tops were hard (my own fault). In my oven, 15 minutes were enough.  Loved these! 
FYI: I managed to salvage the first over-cooked batch by putting them in a self-seal bag along with an orange that had been cut in half. Orange added moisture and flavor!)

Very good!  I do suggest greasing the muffin cups and not using the paper liners.  The first time I made them I used the liners and the muffins stuck to the liners.  When I just greased the muffin cups they turned out perfectly.

These muffins are great as is and in my opinion it does need the oil because I did notice the difference when I left it out and replaced it with extra pumpkin and applesauce. It is also a great base recipe for many other others including a bananna whole wheat bran muffin I made. I just decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup total of just brown sugar (I like it sweet), subbed 1/3 cup of fat free plain yogurt for the buttermilk, decreased the pumpkin pie spice to 1 tsp, replaced pumpkin with 2 mashed ripe banannas, 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour, and 1/2 cup oat bran. I also added 3 tbs of flax seed for added fiber. Let the mixture sit for 5 min before putting it in pan to bake. Absolutely delicious!!!

These were a  little too dense for me.  I might try spelt flour next time since I have had better success with it.  I used a fresh roasted pumpkin instead of canned and cut out the white sugar which was fine for me and the kids but the hubby didn't like them at all.

These were good, but they did taste "healthy".  I used apple butter for the oil, brown sugar only, an added Craisins.  I also added 1/4 flax meal because I need to use it up.  The batter was thicker than I expected, but maybe that was my flax.  I should have taken a little more care in shaping the tops after dropping them into the muffin tin, because they cooked in the original shape. I ended up with 12 regular muffins, plus 9 mini-muffins to finish the batch.

I will be making these again, today, with some tweaks.  I did not make the recipe as listed so let me give the details.  I made a test batch 3 days ago.  I am making a batch today for a holiday party tomorrow, hence the test batch. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose flour.  For the party I will be doing that again but hope to make them with 100% whole wheat for here at home someday soon.  I don't stock pumpkin pie spice so I added 2 tsp cinnimon, 1/2 tsp ground ginger and 1/2 tsp ground nut meg.  I knew from experience this wasn't enough spice but my brain was mushy that day and I didn't listen to myself.    The muffins turned out wonderful in a light pumplin flavor and I adore the dense texture.  However, the spices probably need to be trippled to be tasted.  No spice taste what so ever with the small amount I used.  The muffins were even more flavorful (but not spice wise) the next day.    I see that I could have stretched, if needed, the recipe into 18 muffins.  I really like the texture and the generous size the 12 muffins it makes.   As with most recipes one should make them their own with personal tweaks.  This recipe is a keeper for me with some tweaks I plan on making in regards to the spices.  Thank you for posting this whole wheat recipe.

Great, moist muffins.  Followed the recipe without the optional raisins and nuts.  These were gone before the other, not as healthy, muffins at work today.  Love the texture and flavor that the whole wheat adds.  Thanks for a wonderful muffin recipe - these baked perfectly.

Left out the white sugar, added walnuts and ground flax.  Used all applesauce instead of oil and EnerG Egg Replacer instead of eggs.

I loved these.  I had a baked sweet potato in the fridge, and I mashed that and used instead of pumpkin--I prefer sweet potatoes, anyway.  I also used apple butter since I never had applesauce, and I omitted the white sugar (they are plenty sweet without it, especially with the apple butter).  I was a half cup short on ww pastry flour (use that in muffins since it makes a lighter product), and I added 1/2 cup ground pecans (couldn't readily find my pecans in the freezer!).  Obviously, I didn't add pecans, but I did add raisins (black because that's all I had).  I also used separate spices instead of punpkin pie spice (allspice, ginger, cardamom, and nutmeg--my personal fave blend). They are moist and light, and I love them!  Like other reviewers, I would recommend using the oil--the texture will be much better, especially with ww flour.  Thanks for this...I will definitely be making these over and over this fall and winter!

I followed other reviewers' suggestions to omit the white sugar and oil.  I used 1 cup of pumpkin instead of 1/2 cup.  They're really good even just a few minutes out of the oven.  I can't wait to taste them tomorrow morning!  I may try more pumpkin pie spice next time just because I like a really strong spice flavor in pumpkin breads.

These are very good!  You would never guess they were made with all whole wheat flour.  They came out very moist and light and rose beautifully!  I omitted the white sugar at the suggestion of other reviewers, and since I didn't have any applesauce on hand, I used mashed banana instead.  I also used dried cranberries instead of the raisins just because I love the combination of cranberry and pumpkin.  Delicious!

When I made these, I used half whole wheat flour and half AP flour. It didn't say how full to fill the cups, which gives an idea how much they rise; I filled it almost full and the muffins were nicely domed like the main photo. I doubled the recipe to share with friends and got a little more than 2 dozen... not that I am complaining, these are delicious muffins! nice and moist with intense pumpkin spice flavor. So good with tea. A winner!

These muffins are dense and moist with great flavor.  I subbed the pumpkin spice for 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. cloves, and a pinch of ginger.

pretty good as a base recipe. i used neither applesauce nor canned pumpkin; i was wanting to use up some baby food, so i used a cup of random baby food fruits in place of the pumpkin and applesauce, and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. very tasty.

Very good.  A yummy way to feed kids their fruits, and vegetables.  I diced up two apples and added to mix instead of nuts.  Really good.

Yum. I wanted a good muffin recipe in a hurry, that was nice enough to take as a a holiday gift for our vet's office staff.  I made these exactly as written except added almost a 1/4 cup of craisins and about 1/8 cup of sunflower seeds.  To dress them up a little, I ran a stick of butter over the tops and sprinkled them with white sugar.  They looked pretty and scrumptious---which, by the way, they are. I am sure I will make these again.

This recipe was good but needed some tweaking. I followed previous suggestions and omitted the oil. Also I used a 1/2c combination of applesauce and mashed banana as a substitute for the 1/2c applesauce. Finally, I added the raisins plus 1/3 cup diced apples for texture.

I used half bran and half whole wheat flour. Also subbed the oil for more pumpkin and applesauce.  Added 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice to the spices because we like our pumpkin spicy)...I also added goji berries (previously plumped in water) and pecans.  My husband thinks they are the best and I will definitely be making them again!

Delicious! I made them for my 3.5 and 1 year old and they loved them! I like to freeze healthier homemade muffins and leave in a ziploc bag for a quick breakfast option! And this one is going on our breakfast menu more often! Next time, I will add pecans and raisins for an extra delicious pop!

To be fair, I like the base of this recipe....but I LOVE these muffins with the changes I made. I used only 1C of the flour, and added 3/4C of this ancient grain pancake mix I like and 1 scoop of cinnamon protein powder (take THAT, kiddos! bwahahaa). I bake with Splenda and the Splenda brown sugar blend to cut calories, and I omitted the oil altogether and upped the applesauce a bit. I also just used plain skim milk as vinegar + milk sounded disgusting to me. My muffins were moist and a little bit dense, but in a good way. Delicious straight out of the oven with a little butter. My husband said he would add choco chips but I think they were great as is. Definitely worth a try.

Thank you for this recipe.  It has become a staple in our home.  I have 9 children and it is very hard to find a healthy recipe that everyone likes, this is one of them.  I do modify it because of health reasons. I use real maple syrup instead of regular sugar, then reduce the applesauce a tad.  other than that i made it the same way.  I have to quadruple the recipe to make sure no fights arise over who ate them all haha.

I liked this recipe, but I did change a few things. Many of the comments said to omit the white sugar, which I did. I also read they were a little dense and I HATE dense muffins so instead of 1/3 cup of buttermilk I used 1 tbs of lemon juice to just under 1 cup of milk. I used chopped walnuts instead of pecans because that's what I had (I chopped some more and sprinkled on top) and I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla for extra flavor. I increased the cook time by about 4 min. because of the extra liquid. They turned out super light just how I like them! I would use a little more cinnamon next time for more flavor and maybe sprinkle some sugar on top before baking.

These were wonderful!  I doubled the recipe, and was so glad I did!  I used 1 can organic pumpkin pie mix (which had all the spices & pure cane juice), so I left off the pumpkin pie spice & sugars, except for 1/3 cup brown sugar that I decided to add at the end.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I used skim milk, and it was just fine.  These were just sweet enough, and I was glad I added the oil (I almost didn't), because wheat flour makes some pretty dense muffins!  I think next time I'll add raisins - they needed just a little something more.  Thanks for the recipe!

Took other's advice and left out the white sugar.  At first taste, I thought it was too "whole wheaty" and not sweet enough, but the 2nd try (they were definitely good enough for a 2nd try...) I totally changed my mind:  The sweetness was just right and the whole wheat blended right in (maybe it was a matter of eating right out of the oven vs. the next day?  Hmm....maybe).  Anyway, GREAT holiday bread, I will definitely be making for Xmas instead of my plain-Jane pumpkin bread.  Other changes: I doubled recipe & made a 13x9 pan instead of muffins (took longer to cook of course), I used a whole can of pumpkin rather than just 1 cup, used craisins, used half&half in place of buttermilk, and I made my own pumpkin pie spice with cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger.

I forgot the eggs and used more buttermilk. I will remember the eggs next time. I love these and so does my husband and we made them without the raisins and nuts. I think that they would be delicious with cranberries also. Perfect amount of spices and very moist. Highly recommended.

These muffins were good but not great.  According to reviews it seems like these are better the next day so I will wait to see tomorrow if these improve.  I couldn't really taste anything in these so the spices need to be increased.  I used home made chunky applesauce and followed the rest of the recipe as written.  These are good but could be better with tweaks I guess.

Used splenda for both sugars.  Added dried cranberries per another review.  Doubled the recipe to use a whole can of pumpkin.  Still had to add some add'l buttermilk to make it the right consistency.  Didn't have applesauce so put pears in a food processor as a sub and it worked great.  Omitted the oil too. Doubled recipe and used in mini-loaf pans.

I love that these muffins contain applesauce AND whole wheat flour. It gives them so much more texture.

I left out the white sugar and substituted the raisins and pecans for chocolate chips.  These were delicious and quick to make.  Thanks for a great healthy kid-friendly recipe!

I only rated 4 stars because I changed the recipe so much. I used egg beaters, splenda,  1/2 vanilla extract and omitted the oil using 3/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce instead. I didn't have buttermilk so I used  2% milk. It's a great base recipe and you can change it every time to suit your own tastes.

They are good.  I omitted the white sugar.  They were sweet enough without it.  Made them in mini muffin tins.  I did not add the raisin or nuts, but wish I had.  Needs a little something for texture!

This recipe lends credibility to my frequent assertion that 'good for you' does not have to be synonymous with 'sacrifice'. Light textured, perfectly moist and flavorful ~ this recipe sacrifices nothing in any department. You can use 1% buttermilk as I did, if you wish, but try to use the real thing, as the substitute just isn't near as good. I chose dried cranberries and walnuts for the add-ins. This is one muffin recipe I will refer to often. Thank you, Zafira.

Wow, these muffins are AWESOME!  Just baked up a batch and ate one hot out of the oven; it was divine.  Rose up perfectly and was nice, tender, and fluffy.  Not at all dense like you worry a whole wheat muffin might be!  Just as fluffy as any muffin made with all-purpose, seriously!    I only made a few changes to the recipe.  I added about a half a cup of oats, used Egg Beaters instead of eggs, and 1/3 cup skim milk with 1 tsp lemon juice instead of buttermilk.  I didn't use raisins or nuts in the batter -- instead, I chopped the 1/4 cup pecans fine and pressed them into the tops of the muffins before baking, and gave them each a dusting of cinnamon sugar before sending them in the oven.  This ended up giving the tender muffin a nice bit of crispy crunch to it as well.  Great recipe, perfect for breakfast with a cup of coffee and a piece of fruit.  I will make these again!

This was a good recipes that uses all whole wheat flour. I did make a few adjustments: I only used 1/2 a cup of brown sugar and no white sugar. I only used 1/8 cup of oil. I increased the pumpkin to a full cup, and, finally, I added 2 tsp of vanilla to the wet ingredients. I also left out the nuts, but I think I will put them in next time. With my adjustments, these were only 2 points each on weight watchers!!!

I made these as mini-muffins for my daughter's preschool snack.  I was concerned that the pumpkin pie spice might be too spicy for 4-year-olds, but they all LOVED it. I'm getting ready to make them for my first grader to take to school for his snack day tomorrow!

I didn't have buttermilk and didn't want to use sugar or oil,  so I doubled the amount of applesauce (I had unsweetened). I also added oats on top for a cute touch. They aren't very sweet which is what I was looking for. I added a little more pumpkin since we are pumpkin lovers too. I wanted a whole wheat, healthy option for breakfast muffins. This hit the spot.

I too omitted the oil and just added extra applesauce. I think next time I might put more pumpkin in as well. Overall it was very good! Myself, my husband and two daughters (6 and 3) loved them!

This is SO delicious. I wanted a heathy, nutrient-packed, sweet treat for Sunday evening, and this was perfect, BUT with healthy modifications, like other suggested: 

Cut the white sugar completely, and up the brown sugar a tad to 3/4 cup. 

Cut the oil completely as well -  instead, increase the pumpkin to 1/2cup + 1/8 cup, and the unsweetened applesauce to 1/2 cup +1/8 cup as well. (To make up for the 1/4 cup of oil). 

In addition, use 1/2 cup of egg whites instead of 2 whole eggs.

Sprinkle muffin tops with unsalted pumpkin seeds for a delicious, perfect touch.

Another tip: lets muffins cool, but while they are still warm (not hot), wrap in aluminum foil and seal in ziploc bags to freeze, if you aren't going to eat everything at once. It REALLY keeps them fresh when you store them when they are still warm, and easily defrost within 15-20 minutes, which is perfect to take one out when you are getting ready in the morning,  grab and go and you have a delicious breakfast :) 

Bon Apetit!

Easy and delicious muffins.  I don't feel too guilty about eating them.  I baked half the recipe by the instructions and added about 2 Tbsp of ground flax to the rest.  I will probably add 1/4 cup flax the next time just to add some fiber.  I might also cut down on the oil and sub applesauce to make it a touch healthier.

Super Yummy! I also skipped the white sugar, substituted pumpkin purée for oil, and added walnuts and milk chocolate chips. Super moist/better the next day after sitting overnight in a sealed container :)

Tasty muffins. Only thing I did differently was I used almond milk instead of butter milk and Added an extra 3/4 of a teaspoon of baking powder. Turned out amazing.

These are really good, the kids don't even know they are healthy!! I did make some changes to the original recipe because I wanted to use an unrefined sugar and get rid of the oil. I used white whole wheat flour, increased the pumpkin pie spice to 1T, replaced the oil with an extra 1/4C pumpkin, and replaced the white and brown sugars with 2/3C demerara sugar, and I added a good handful of chopped pecans. After reading previous reviews I decided to give my liners a little spray with pam with flour before filling to help prevent sticking.. it didn't work as well as I had hoped. I think in the future I may turn the oven down closer to 375 because they did look a little brown on the bottom after only 15 minutes.

These turned out dry for me. I've also noticed that using all whole wheat flour gives muffins a raw-uncooked taste. Not a bad basic recipe but  I would not make these again.

I don't care for these. My husband and I are both bariatric patients so I ALWAYS cut back on sugars and oils in recipes. I followed some other reviewers' advice and left out the white sugar and oil, and upped the pumpkin and applesauce. They are very dense and kind of bland. Just not to my liking.

Loved these and made them even healthier!  I substituted applesauce/mashed banana for the oil.  My son is allergic to dairy so I used hemp milk in place of the buttermilk (much healthier option for those who haven't looked into this).  Omitted the white sugar.  These are soooo good!

I love this! I took the advice of another comment and I left out the white sugar I also left out oil and added 1/4 cup more pumpkin. I topped it with a homemade vanilla topping. It's fantastic! A nice healthy dessert.

1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger (scant)

I liked these muffins and would make them again, but would change the spice used.  I made Pumpkin Pie Spice II from this site and felt it had too much clove in it.  I would maybe add just cinnamon to these muffins next time, or use less clove in order to suit my tastes.  At some point I would also try others' suggestion of replacing the oil for more applesauce and see how that turns out.

Spongy texture.  Not enough pumpkin/spice flavor.  A little gritty (I'm not sure what caused the grittiness).  Edible, but not very good.

The buttermilk and applesauce makes this muffin super moist - my daughter LOVED it and it is now in my "favorite" pile.  I didn't add the golden raisins (I only had the regular ones) but did add the pecans which were fantastic!

We really liked these.  I'm always trying to find healthier recipes.  I used only 1/2 of the white sugar and didn't have any buttermilk.  So I substituted vinegar and milk as suggested.  Will make these again!

For being 'healthy' muffins these were just ok.  I wasn't expecting much so I was maybe a bit pleased but not impressed enough to make them again.  As others suggested I did not use any oil- just used twice the amount of pumpkin.  I used splenda sugars and twice the raisins since I didn't have pecans.  I added about 2 TB flax seed.  I think they would be better with chocolate chips- I know it takes away from the 'healthy' aspect but a few dark choc chips won't hurt- maybe would have been worth another star.

These muffins are quite good, they turned out quite dense and moist. I had no applesauce so I used a shredded apple instead, which seemed to work well. I wish the pumpkin taste was stronger. Otherwise really good.

We make a double batch of these every week!  We make them with white whole wheat, use a 15 oz can of pumpkin plus an ounce or so of applesauce.  They travel well, are delicious, and keep for a few days if they last that long.  Our kids love 'em!

REALLY good. I've tried several whole wheat flour only muffin recipes from this site and this one is BY FAR the most moist/best tasting. I primarily make these for my kids breakfast.  I left the recipe as is but used SMART BALANCE oil (only 1/4 cup not much anyway) since it's healthier.  SUPER moist. Kids LOVE them!

These are by far the best whole wheat pumpkin muffins I've made.  I did substitute splenda white and brown sugar and used homemade no sugar added applesauce.  Even after oopsing the first time and adding allspice instead of pumpkin pie spice these muffins rocked.

These were quick and easy and used items I usually have available.  Only a couple substitutions for me, regular milk instead of buttermilk, and cinnamon with a dash of cloves/nutmeg in place of the allspice.  I also added a bit of coconut but it wasn't really enough to add to the muffins.  I would make again, although they were not that sweet (I used unsweetened applesauce).

These were delicious and healthy! I omitted the oil and white sugar and increased the applesauce as many reviews suggested. I also used skim milk instead of buttermilk. They were rich and slightly sweet--with lots of fiber and very little fat! They came out very dense with the substitutions so next time I'll try adding another egg for fluffiness.

These muffins were pretty good.  I like that they are a convenient way to sneak whole grains into my picky two-year old.  I changed it up a little...I only used about 2 tbsp. of white sugar and omitted the oil like other posters suggested and replaced it with about 1/4 c. more pumpkin.  I also used the lemon juice in the milk suggestion since I didn't have any buttermilk on hand (and have no reason to buy it otherwise).  I omitted the nuts/raisins.  Although overall I like them, they are a little dry and leave kind of a strange aftertaste, but I think next time I'll add more applesauce and see if that makes them moister.

These muffins were good, though they didn't taste like anything special. I picked the recipe because I wanted breakfast, not dessert. Like other reviewers said, you really can't tell they're "healthified," but that tells me the people who reduced the sugar were right.

I added some vanilla, and these were delicious. Watch how long you bake them, though--take them out right at 15 minutes or they quickly dry out on the bottom.  I only like the muffin tops, though, so these are perfect!

Great flavor and great texture. I made them with and without pecans (no raisins) with no ingredient substitutions.  They're plenty sweet and you probably could reduce the sugar if you wanted. I think the pumpkin flavor, spices, and sugar help make a whole-wheat muffin taste more decadent.  They're more pumpkin-flavored than apple, yet they seem lighter in texture than most pumpkin breads.

I found these very dense, dry, and lacking flavor.  The only thing I modified was to omit the white sugar.  I make muffins all the time, and I'm positive that the sugar would not have made a difference in this case.

I used  milk and white flour, sweetened apple sauce, added cranberries and pumpkin seeds. Also didn't have pumpkin pie spice on hand so just used cinnamon and nutmeg.  Kinda just went with what u had in the house but I'm super excited to share these with my family.

I enjoyed them very much as well as our 4 year old son.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I try to follow the letter of recipe the first time but I was out of buttermilk so I swapped with Greek yogurt. Very tasty muffins. They are more dense than box muffins and not overly sweet which I liked. My husband thought they were dry and needed butter or frosting.

I made these but it seems a muffin should have less sugar.  I did add more applesauce and cut down on the sugar.  I really like them.  The pumpkin flavors come out the next day or so.  Also I didn't use whole wheat flour.  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice or buttermilk.

Very dense and bland (and I doubled the spice).There was only a slight pumpkin, applesauce, and spice taste. I'm only giving these muffins 3 stars because my family liked them.

I used black raisins that had been softened in boiling water. Definitely making these again! Edit: made them again, but doubled the batch because 12 of these just isn't enough!

I doubled the recipe and the muffins came out beautiful! For the flour, I used half whole wheat and half WHITE whole wheat flour. I used vinegar in regular milk and added 3 TB of buttermilk powder. I also added a small container of Greek yogurt and about a cup and a half of frozen cranberries cut in half. 

These muffins are delicious! Definitely a regular fall tradition in our home now. I will take some to work on Monday, if there are any left!

I modified this recipe as recommended by many users and didn’t like it. I cut out the white sugar all together and substituted the oil with additional pumpkin and applesauce. I found the texture to be dense and dry and the pumpkin flavor was lacking. Maybe it’s not fair to rate the modified  recipe in place of the original version. I’ll keep looking for a pumpkin muffin recipe.

I wanted to make this recipe as close to the original as possible. I didn’t realize that I only had one egg, so I substituted a 1/4 cup of applesauce for an egg and kept my fingers crossed.  I chose cranberries instead of raisins solely because  not everyone likes raisins. Otherwise everything else was the same. These muffins are so good. So very good.

Made these tonight. Omitted oil and white sugar. Added flax meal, some steal cut oats and for my teenager  I added a handful of chocolate chips in half of them.  Pile up the batter high as they will cook and finish looking like how you loaded the muffin sheet.

I love these muffins. I left out the white sugar and used sweetened apple sauce instead. I also added chocolate chips to half the batch.

This makes a very satisfying healthy muffin.  I followed directions with a few changes.  I used a whole cup of pumpkin and left out the applesauce; and I used kefir instead of buttermilk since that's what I had on hand and buttermilk is hard to find in Miami.  It worked out great. I added the pecans but didn't have raisins although next time I will add them and maybe craisins as well.  I think you could add all sorts of options and they would all work. Edit: I've made these several times since with craisins and by are they delicious.

Overall good.
I used more pumpkin instead of oil and omitted the white sugar too. Added an additional teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and a splash of vanilla.
The texture is different then a regular muffin made with more fats..but flavor was tasty and they were plenty sweet enough without the white sugar.

Very good!  Made in loaf pan (one pan), so lowered heat to 350 and baked longer.  Topped w/a bit of brown sugar and cinnamon.  Used 1/8 cup oil, 3/4 cup pumpkin.  Didn't have applesauce, used one mashed banana (made 1/2 cup).  Didn't have buttermilk, added vinegar to regular milk to make soured milk beforehand.  Used white wheat flour (still whole wheat, just a different type of wheat that is lighter than the traditional whole wheat).  Added 2 tsp of vanilla.

Delicious and teenagers scarfed them down.  :-) First time I made them, I accidently left out the applesauce and added some more milk because I couldn't understand why the better was dry.  Guess I was tired.   Anyway, still delish even if a bit dry.  ?? Second time followed recipe accurately and they are also great.

So moist! So perfect! I used all organic ingredients and doubled the recipe. Some variations i made were:

Tripled the pumpkin (everything else just doubled)
Used egg nog and sour cream instead of buttermilk
Used cane sugar and molasses instead of white/brown sugar
Used cranberries instead of raisins
Used butter instead of oil.

Will definitely make again.

These tasted great but were a bit heavy, as is usual, I find, when making something with a puree in it.  nevertheless I made a double batch and they were gone in 3 days!  I might make it again, but I do prefer fluffier muffin.

A great muffin for me to come back to and play around with! Made the first batch less the white sugar  (I always cut sugar where I think I can). Second batch had a quick oat struesel topping to make them (less healthy!)but a little different. Will make sure I have pecans on hand for the next time I make these.  Solid  recipe..thanks for sharing!

Five stars for versatility.  I wanted to vouch for the fact that you can in fact use all pumpkin puree instead of a combo of apple sauce and pumpkin.  I added apple chunks instead of raisins to compensate for sweetness.  Also, fine with fresh pumpkin puree instead of canned.

I made the recipe as written, and added the optional pecans but not the raisins.  It's fabulous.  Very moist, very flavorful, very filling.  I will make this again and again.  It is not too sweet, but it is plenty sweet, so I will probably experiment with eliminating the white sugar just to reduce calories.  Next time I will double the pecans.  I may experiment with a  mild olive oil instead of canola, but in general I prefer the texture of muffins that have some oil.  I'm also suspicious that those having problems with the muffins sticking to the paper are leaving out the oil.  We had no issues with them sticking to the paper.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made it according to the recipe but felt that it is a bit dry and kids did not like it as much.  I want to make it even healthier with higher fiber content and a bit more protein.  I made another batch with some changes.  I substitute the buttermilk with plain  Greek yogurt.  I add extra pumpkin, about 1/4 cup more and I add ground Flax, about 1/3 cup to the batter.  It turned out wonderful and kids loved it compare to the original recipe.  It is more moist.  I skipped the white sugar and it is still plenty sweet.

My oven runs hot, so I did 375 for 20 min. They came out moist and done all the way through. A bit bland, which is why I just gave 4 stars. I will freeze them to use for quick grab breakfast. They're not flavorful enough to take to a brunch or give as gifts.

Good, but too salty. I wish I had reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. I used only 1/2 cup brown sugar and no white. One cup pumpkin and no applesauce. One tablespoon butter and no canola. I find the 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice overwhelming. Next time I'll do 1t pumpkin pie spice and 1t cinnamon. Did not use raisins or pecans, but next time will add a few chopped dates. Will make again with changes.

These were really tasty, and less dense than I expected. I made a few changes. I used half a can of pumpkin instead of just 1/2 cup, cut the oil to 1 tablespoon, cut he sugar to 1/4 cup total, added 2 tablespoons honey, and added 1/2 cup chocolate chips. This made 19 muffins for me, but it may just be that I have smaller tins.

Great muffins! Left out white sugar, subbed butter flavored olive oil for oil, walnuts for pecans and dried cranberries for raisins. Soaked cranberries in water for 10 minutes while putting together other ingredients; then drained them before adding (make them more plump!).  Threw in 1/2 t dried orange peel. Next time will also add 1 t vanilla. Thanks for great and versatile recipe! 
P.S. Mine were done in exactly 15 min.

These were very well liked by all!  The only things I did different were to use about 1/3 tsp salt, and regular raisins.  I did use vinegar with milk as a buttermilk sub.

I just made these, they were delicious! The only thing I changed was the buttermilk; I used 2% milk instead. I would use a little more pumpkin next time as well.

Awesome recipe. I used unsweetened applesauce but still used half the white sugar. I also used more pumpkin instead of the oil. Yum! Even my 3 year old loved them.

A nice dense hearty muffin. I left out the buttermilk and added more pumpkin, also 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda instead of what the recipe called for. They were great, my teenagers ate them up.

Right off, I totally McGuyver'd this just because I'm a baker and felt like playing with food, and I was happy to see a recipe using pumpkin. I took a photo of one of them cut in half so the texture and height can be seen. Being a baker I know I have lots of things many folks won't hanging around my pantry but they are all common items for baking. I could tell the original was good by reading it so I jumped in. My husband(healthy food Hater) just poked his head in and said "Those muffins are ridiculously good) Glad I wrote it down now. So, the things I changed... for the flour: 3/4C whole wheat, 3/4 wheat bran, 1/2 C.pastry (cake)flour and 2 t. gluten powder.
For the brown sugar 1/2 C. barley malt syrup. For the white sugar: 1/2 C. white sugar. I did like another reviewer and did not use oil and increased the pumpkin to 3/4 C & used the half sugar crasins and the last is in place of all cinnamon I used 1 t. cinn & 1 t. ginger. Key to moist bran items is to soak it in the milk the recipe needs while getting the other things together. I buy my barley malt on line and use it sometimes in place of sugar. Very healthy w a slight molasses taste. The label can answer any question you may have. I took everything wet, including the soaked bran and gave it a mix in the mixer, tossed in the dry then folded in. It made 6 giant muffins in 25 minutes. Oh, I had a little streusel left in the freezer so I topped them before baking. I know, Mcgyver city, but really good and fluffy too :)

This is a good recipe for a healthy muffin.  A little more dense than I'd prefer, but all, in all a decent alternative for a healthy breakfast or snack option.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, Julie!

Reduced sugars to 3/4 C total and still plenty sweet; substituted choc chips which enticed my 7yo to try them; beautiful, tall muffins - easy and tasty

These muffins are delish! I made the following slight changes, otherwise I followed the recipe as written: used 3 tablespoons coconut oil instead of canola oil. Used skim milk plus 1 teaspoon vinegar as suggested instead of buttermilk. Omitted the raisins and pecans. I greased the muffin pans instead of using paper liners and they came out great. I feel like I'm eating pumpkin pie without the crust! ~~ Oops! I realized I used 1 cup of pumpkin instead of 1/2 cup...I am going to continue using the full cup when I make these in the future. More vitamin A and more YUM!

It's in the oven now.  Here are the changes I made:
grapeseed oil instead of canola, 1% milk instead of buttermilk, carrot purée instead of pumpkin, homemade applesauce (no sugar added), 1/4 c. honey instead of any sugar and baking in a loaf pan at 375 instead of muffins.  Added 2 T flaxseed meal and 1/2 c. chopped cashews and pumpkin seeds.  It's basically a new recipe!  We'll see how it comes out.

I didn't expect much from this recipe, since I don't normally love pumpkin (my kid & husband do) and haven't had much luck baking with applesauce. These were really, really good, though. They're definitely fall into the "treat" category, but they do have some redeeming nutritional value. I used white whole wheat flour and dried cranberries. Next time I might try cutting the white sugar, as some others did. Still, a pleasant surprise - thank you!

GREAT low fat recipe! I used almond milk instead of canola oil and a little less of both sugars but they turned out REALLY good and super moist.

As other reviewers have said as is they turn out a bit lacking in pumpkin flavor. I used a whole small can of pureed pumpkin and upped the amount of pumpkin pie spice, as well as adding, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves to it. For a batch for someone who needed an extra kick of fiber and whole grain I added 1 tablespoon of stone cut oats, and 3 tablespoons of powdered fiber solution. They couldn't taste it and ate up the batch.

Very tasty!  I have found whole wheat muffins to be dry in the past and this was not.  Enjoyed by the whole family which is good as I made a triple batch!  I may increase the apple sauce a little next time to make it even moister!  Thanks

Delicious!!  They're moist and fluffy, but hearty too.  I made one batch with the recipe as is and another substituting pumpkin butter for applesauce and puréed sweet potato for the pumpkin and added toasted pumpkin seeds.  This is a great recipe.

I had a a partial can of pumpkin leftover and thought I'd try these.. they turned out great! I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I threw in cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and nutmeg. I also used a little more than 1/2 c. pumpkin and sprinkled the top with a brown sugar/flour/butter mixture. SO yummy! Will definitely make again.

Very moist, good texture -- and healthy!  I made a couple of minor changes.  I used one half whole wheat flour and one half white whole wheat flour, I used about three quarters of the sugar, and I added chocolate chips to half of them for my husband and nine-year-old.  They both loved them.

My young son loves these, and my husband had no clue they were made with whole wheat flour.  I would use just oil instead of applesauce because they quickly dried out in just one day.  But they do freeze well, and are an excellent way to sneak in healthy ingredients.

These muffins were excellent and my 16 month old gobbled them down! They were a tad sweet, but I substituted homemade sweetened applesauce so I pobably should have cut down the sugar a bit. I also didn't have pumpkin on hand so I used some pureed sweet potato I had in the freezer. I will definely be making this again!

After reading some of the reviews, I used only 1/2 tsp salt, 2 1/2 tsp pumpkin spice, no white sugar, no oil and 1 cup pumpkin. I prepared it in a loaf pan and was ready in 43 min ( I used my toaster oven).  It smelled and looked wonderful, but it was so tough!  I was disappointed (to say the least).  So I double wrapped it in plastic wrap and left it overnight. This morning I unwrapped it and tore of a chunk, it was so moist and delicious!  Perfect pumpkin taste.  I will bake many and give out in gift baskets.

These were surprising to me. First, because I didn't like them all that much...they were just ok, nothing special. Second, because my husband who hates whole wheat, gobbled them up! The only negative comment from him is that he wishes they had been sweeter. I haven't decided if I'll make them again or not..I'm on the fence.

I was looking for a whole wheat/applesauce muffin recipe to use up some ingredients I had on hand. This is a keeper. I omitted the pumpkin and used 1 c. of blueberry applesauce that I had. I omitted the nuts and used 2 c. of fresh blueberries. I omitted the white sugar. I will try it next time without the oil. Good texture.

they baked beautifully, looked great, were moist, but they really lacked pumpkin flavor.  Next time I will add 1 cup pumpkin, and more spices.

These were pretty good...I think the spice should be doubled though.  Other than that a great muffin!
