I make this pie with coconut oil instead of butter to make it dairy-free.

As usual, I lacked some of the ingredients. Only had about 2/3 of the white sugar, so substituted Splenda brown sugar for the rest of the white as well as the brown sugar. Found a recipe for allspice- 1/3 each of nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon. Used salted butter- no unsalted. Greased the bottom of a 9x9 inch pan, because I had no crust. 

The result was good, but separated a little, which may have been from the Splenda or the lack of a crust. Tasted like it was missing something, but served over frozen waffles the next morning (drizzled with honey), this pear dish was absolutely delicious! Will make again.

I've never made a fresh fruit pie before so I was glad to find a good base recipe to experiment with.  (Tip: If you're working with fresh pears, the easiest way that I've found to peel them is to boil them for about 20-30 seconds one at a time and have a bowl of cold water on hand.  After you boil one, just plop it in the bowl and just lightly rub on the skin under water with your thumb...peels right off and the skins just sink to the bottom.)  After I peeled and cut them I put them in a gallon plastic bag and poured about a shot each of brandy and spiced rum.  I also put all of the spices in the bag that the recipe called for (with a little extra cinnamon bc I like the flavor).  I let it marinate in the fridge for about 6ish hours and then prepared the filling.  I felt the pie needed a "topping" so on half of the pie I sprinkled some Coach's Oats on the top.     Results:  Flavor was excellent!  I liked the oat side better than the non-oat side but both were good.  I didn't dry off the pears or try to dehydrate them a little before adding the liquor and such so it turned out a bit more liquidy than I'd like so I think next time I'm going wipe them down a bit with some paper towels before adding the liquids...and maybe bake it about 5ish minutes longer.

I made it exactly to the directions.  It was runny and had too much allspice.  Next time I will try adding tapioca pudding mix and baking a little longer.  I will add more cinnamon and less allspice.  I was sad this time though since I made three for my work Christmas party.  Everyone was excited to try it and it was just mediocre.
