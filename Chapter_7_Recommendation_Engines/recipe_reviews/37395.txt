Everyone loved this recipe!  I have to give out copies of the recipe to anyone who tries it!  I made a 9x13 inch pan, so I had to increase baking time to 40 minutes.  Also, be sure to use Duncan Hines brand cake mix...with no pudding added to mix already.  To use only one can of soda in this recipe, I added only 1 cup of cola to the cake, and then added an additional 1/4 cup of water.  I used the called-for 1/2 cup for the frosting.  This makes a rich, gooey, moist, chocolate cake.  It was a huge success, except for those very few children who do not like nuts....Definitely a keeper!

The cake overall was so-so, but the glaze was delicious.  I think I'll use the glaze only in the future, to frost regular chocolate cake.

This is quite possible THE BEST chocolate cake I have ever eaten!!  It is light, fluffy and delicious.  My family couldn't stop talking about it.  I will definitely be making over and over again.

I have made this twice now and have gotten rave reviews both times.  The second time I made it I used Devil's Food flavored instant pudding as well as Devil's food cake mix with added pudding in the mix.  I also added a bit more vanilla.  Very moist.  Another hint, cut holes in cake before pouring icing over top- allows for it to soak in creating a moist cake.

OK, but nothing special. Homemade chocolate cake is almost as easy and much better!

I thought the cake was great but did not care for the glaze I would have rather had a thicker more frosting like frosting but cake was pretty good!!!!

This was a wonderful cake!  I made it for Father's Day and it was big hit.  Very moist.  Couple suggestions: when using a 9x13 pan it needs to cook about 45 minutes and sift the powder sugar first.
