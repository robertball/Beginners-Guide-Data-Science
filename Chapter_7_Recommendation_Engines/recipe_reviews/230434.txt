Even though I followed the recipe, my end product could not be cut into squares!   I had to spoon the mixture onto the extra sugar, and roll the pieces around.  These were easy to make, and have great taste!  I'll have to make more!

For those having trouble, make sure that you're using 16 oz. of cranberry sauce. They have changed the size of the cans now, and they only come with 14 oz.

FANTASTIC! I could've eaten the syrup, that's how good it smelled/tasted, lol. I did not add the optional nuts, b/c I don't think I would've cared for that. After pouring it into the pan, I let it set 2 days to make sure it was nice and set up. I did spray my chef's knife w/ cooking spray, just to make cutting a bit easier, and that worked great. These are nice and jelly-like, but also soft with a sweet/tart flavor that is just wonderful, and so simple to make too! I will def be making these again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Following the recipe this oozed and was a bit messy. I did try again and made some changes. If you buy the bigger boxes of jello and add 1 packet of Knox unflavored gelatin and 1 and a half cans of the cranberry sauce it comes out the way it is pictured. Also played around with different flavors. The lime and jolly rancher watermelon are very tasty! I also followed the candy thermometer instead of the timing listed.

I really enjoyed the flavor but I found the candy hard to work with. I ended up making jelly blobs because they just wouldn't slice.  I did save the day however by dipping my blobs in chocolate and topping them with pecans.  So I ended up with a chewy chocolatey fruit and nut candy that was quite delicious. I just wish I could have been able to slice them.

Very gooey and impossible to cut.  I think there is some variation in the gelatin quality and content of the various brands of cranberry and flavored jello packages.  If you use the cheap brands, like I did, you may run into the same difficulties with the mixture not setting properly.  Next time I will use brand name products or add extra unflavored gelatin.

To solve the problem not setting and being sticky, I used a silicon muffin pan. I poured the mixture into the lightly greased muffin pan.  It then sat for 18 hours.  I popped them out of the molds into a bowl of sugar and tossed them to coat. They then sat on a wire rack to cure (dry) for 24 hours.  I then cut each ‘muffin’ into 8 pie shaped pieces with a lightly greased knife.  Tossed them in sugar again to cover the cut edges.  I cured them another 24 hours.  These take time but my family begs for them on every occasion.

I really was hoping to have a better outcome. I loved the flavor and the smell was so good. After letting it sit for two nights  and using butter on the knife like another person suggested, it still came out in blobs,

The biggest mess I have ever created in my kitchen in 55 years of cooking. The jelly did not set up overnight. We ended up using scissors to scrape it off the oiled wax paper and cutting it into kinda/sorta pieces. It took my husband and I both to get it sugared and onto plastic plates. We didn't want to waste it and considered diluting it and making it into syrup. But I had planned it as part of a candy plate to give for Christmas to neighbors so made due with it.
