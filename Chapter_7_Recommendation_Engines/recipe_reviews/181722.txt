This recipe was very good!  It was easy and delish!  I added a small onion to the meat while I was browning it.  It also stuck to the pan even after I had sprayed it with non stick spray.  I also think that it could have used even more then one cup of veggies for the top.  But it will be one that I will make again and again because I always have the ingredients on hand.

Quite tasty for a "light" recipe. I would suggest using 1/4 cup milk in place of the 1/4 cup water for the base crust however, to make it a little moister and would grease the bottom of the dish very well to prevent sticking. I also added a small diced onion for extra flavor. I will definitely be making this again!

I used 2 whole eggs instead of egg product or egg whites and I used fresh veggies (red and green pepper and mushrooms) instead of frozen veggies.  I thought it was okay but I'll probably make it again because it was a good meal for my toddler.

Super simple and pretty tasty!  I substituted diced red peppers and yellow onion for mixed veggies.  Next time will try green peppers, mushrooms, etc.  Crust is a little thin and stuck even though I sprayed the pan.
