The recipe was great...I felt the muffins needed a little more something. I substitued cinnamon
spice oatmeal for plain oatmeal and added a half a cup of walnuts.  As a tip, don't heat the buttermilk
too long, or the batter will be too lumpy.

I loved the texture and the ease with which I made these muffins, but they were rather tasteless. I will, however, try them again -- next time I will add more honey, and maybe a bit of cinnamon and will NOT use paper liners (the muffins stuck to the liners and I ended up throwing away about a quarter of the muffin with the liner!).

My 3 year old daughter can not have wheat, dairy, eggs or sugar so I altered these slightly and she loves them (and so do I).  They are very moist and tastey.  Like others, I doubled the honey and oil.  I used spelt flour 2/3 and rice flour 1/3 instead of wheat flour.  I also used soy milk with a tablespoon of lemon juice in place of the buttermilk.  I added raisins as well and a bit a cinnimon.  Oh and I also added about 3 tablespoons of ground flax to the oatmeal mixture.  These are healthy and delicious.  Thanks Joann.

After reading the reveiws I added one frozen (thawed) banana and twice the honey.  I love the fact that they are not glorified cake but something with some real substance.  The kids loved them too.

These muffins do have a good texture and healthful ingredients, but not a lot of flavor.  Doubling the amount of honey and oil might improve the flavor.

I was skepical about trying a muffin recipe without any eggs but I was surprised! These were great! I added 1/4 cup Splenda & 3/4 tsp cinnamon. Next time I'll up the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp. The texture is somewhat dense; I used cinnamon applesauce in place of the oil & it seemed to work fine. I'm looking forward to heating these up for snacks. I got 10 muffins out of this which is perfect since I'm the only health nut in the family! Thanks so much!

For whole wheat muffins these are great.  I did add twice the honey and a half cup of splenda with a cup of crasins but they really turned out terrific.

These muffins were great!  Not too sweet, but just right!  :)  Couldn't really taste the honey though.  They were great warmed with a squirt or honey!

This was a great healty muffin based recipe.  After reading the various commnets saying that it was bland by itself... I doubled the honey plus added raisins and pecans and chopped granny smith apples.  They were absolutely delicious!

Well I geuss I should start by thanking newport29 for this great recipe!!

Anyway these were great! Cooked a bit faster than directed in the recipe, but that was no big deal.

I also used maple syrup instead of honey, it was awesome!

And made a powdered sugar glaze with a bit of syrup added for extra flavor, that turned out well too.



Kids ate them up, I made 24, and there were 8 people eating them they are gone!

These were disgusting!!! I won't be making these again. I add raisins and that did nothing to help them, I even made some honey butter and that did nothing. Thy had great texture but the flavor was horrid, it tasted like hay.

Great egg-less muffin! Replace the buttermilk with soy milk (Organic Valley)and you have a Great Vegan Muffin! Paper did stick to warm muffin, however I stored them in fridge and the next morning paper came right off. I then microwaved muffin for 20 seconds. Great plain or with preserves.

This is my new favorite muffin recipe. It is more like an old fashioned muffin, not like a cupcake that most places serve. I add fruit (whatever I have on hand-apples with cinnamon, blueberries, peaches, whatever!) I also use maple syrup instead of honey. They are great to bring on the drive to work.

I think these were great! but they needed more flavor, so I tried adding honey butter to the tops like one of the reviews said, but I still thought they needed more flavor, so I made a glaze with melted butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, honey, and a little bit of roled oats. I used a toothpick to poke small holes in the tops, then spooned the glaze over the tops, delicious! thanks for the recipe, everyone loved them!

I choose this recipe because I needed a snack but had no eggs or all purpose flour. Unfortunately, as written this is very bland. I added 2 tbsps brown sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon and an apple grated with the peel left on. Next time add 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice as well. I had to add more flour as it was very liquidy, I got 10 muffins that baked in 20 minutes not 30. Healthy food does not need to be bland or boring.

As healthy as these muffins are, I was surprised at how good they were! I gave it 4 stars only because I read some reviews about how bland they were, and added 2 small chopped apples, 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/8 tsp. nutmeg to the batter. The muffins were very moist and tasty; but they still were missing something. Next time I make them, I will probably add a little more salt, to see if that will help. Thanks for a easy, healthy and tasty recipe!

I really like this recipe. It's very simple and I thought the muffins had a good texture. I didn't have buttermilk so I mixed yogurt in with the milk. I added a cup or two of fresh chopped cranberries. The muffins were gone by the next morning. :)

These muffins were really bland/flavorless.  Needed more honey or sugar.  Also, they stuck to the paper muffin cups I used.  I would not make this again.

Very tasty. The texture is very different, chewy and dense. I ate mine with a bit of butter. My eight year old also liked them! I will make them again, especially for car trips. While they are still warm it is impossible to get paper liners off, but once they cooled the papers came off easily!

a very simple, moist muffin. it wasn't very sweet at all, it actually didn't have much taste, so it'd be perfect for every meal, or adding fruits or cheese to it. don't use muffin liner though, i did and the muffins were stuck to them

I wanted to like these, but they were kinda bland even with doubling the honey (& the oil, too).  I kinda doubt any recipe will taste like honey when it's used as a sweetener.  On top, sure.

I was not a fan of these. The texture was OK, but a little too chewy, and they needed either a little more honey or some sugar! they really had no flavor. I am giving them 4 stars because I have a 1 year old who refuses to let anyone feed him- he wants to do everything himself so he never gets oatmeal for breakfast and he LOVES these. I believe he will eat the whole batch himself.

As is this is only a 3 star recipe, but it is a great base if you add other mix ins like chopped dates, craisins, nuts or other dried fruit. The texture is great, I didn't use muffin cups because low fat muffins always seem to stick to them for me, so I just sprayed with Pam and they popped out of the pan nicely. I also used Almond milk instead of buttermilk because thats what we have in our house. Anyhow, like I said, really nice base to add other stuff into!

These muffins smelt amazing while in the oven. However, the muffin was bland and boring I took another woman's advice and tried honey on the top but it was still bad. I won't be remaking these muffins, I may make my own more flavorful version but I won't repeat this one.

I fully expected these "healthy" muffins to taste awful & was pleasantly surprised when they didn't.  I ate mine buttered, with honey on them & they were pretty good.  Not as good as the muffins I usually make, but those are incredibly unhealthy.

These were great!  I added a few tablespoons of brown sugar and a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter, then sprinkled cinnamon sugar over the top while they baked -yum!  They were a bit like ginger bread, but without the ginger.    Really great basic recipe!

Not bad, a little bland. I didn't have buttermilk so I used milk and lemon juice and it seemed to work fine.

As written, the recipe is only medium.  The muffins come out flat, and it needs a lot more flavor.  I wonder if an egg might help give it more rise.  I tried with 3 Tbs honey and 3 Tbs maple syrup, chopped pears, and walnuts, and a bit more oil.  It was 4 stars that way, but still needs something.  Maybe even more maple syrup.

These were pretty bland.  Tasted pretty much like plain baked oatmeal.  I added cinnamon and ginger but still they did not have much taste.  Definitely couldn't taste the honey, so if I made these again I would double it.  Lucky for me I love bland foods so I kinda like them, but you definitely couldn't serve them to anyone - they were pretty tasteless!  The texture was good though and they smell delicious from the oven.

Not too great, even though I added the recommended extra honey and cinnamon.  In fact, tasted like muffin-shaped oatmeal...

Rather bland. I put walnuts, more honey and cinnamon on top of one baked muffin, though, and it was a hearty, tasty snack!

These are only OK.  Very bland.  I added an apple, dates, walnuts and cinnamon and I still thought they were very bland.  However, I like the more healthful ingredients and will probably tinker with the recipe again to try to get some more flavor.

These muffins are great! I threw in a handful of frozen blueberries for some added nutrition.  Just a note, the batter is thick and sticks to the paper liners quite a bit.

I replaced 1/2 c. of wheat flour with wheat bran. I made mini-muffins out of this recipe and baked them for 25 minutes. They turned out great--not too sweet, but you can taste the honey. I'm happy to have something halfway nutritious to bring to my students.

If you’re looking for a sweet, cupcake-y muffin, keep looking. But if you like hearty, whole grain muffins, this is a great basic recipe. I added  2 teaspoons cinnamon, 1 grated apple, and a handful of chopped pecans. Baked for 23 minutes. Delicious!

Definitely got a thumbs up from hubby!  Based on other comments did double the honey and added some Craisins for flavor.  Not the prettiest muffins (kind of blah looking), but nobody's stomachs knew the difference :-)  Liked that these are pretty healthy too.

These might be bland all by themselves, but with butter and preserves they are very good.  They went very nice with the apricot lentil soup recipe also from this site.  I wanted something with whole grains to combine with the lentils.

These muffins were definitely delicious! Even my husband loved them! I added a very ripe banana, some cinnamon, walnuts, and doubled the honey, and I really enjoyed how they turned out! My husband and I aren't eating any sugar right now, so I added some granola to the top of some of them to make it a little more interesting. Finally I drizzled them all with a little bit of honey right before I served them. I would definitely make these again, but I probably would add more cinnamon and probably nutmeg as well just for some bolder flavor.

This is a great muffin recipe. In my opinion muffins shouldn't be loaded with sugar and oil and this recipe fits that criteria! They were moist and delicious!

These are hearty muffins, and the perfect vehicle for a chocolate fix.
I added several tablespoons of plain yogurt, a couple tablespoons of sugar, cinnamon and 1/2 c cocoa powder.  Still a healthier muffin, but certainly not lacking in the flavor department.

Great muffins but I agree with other reviewers about the need to add more flavor. If I hadn't added a small bag of frozen raspberries and a handful of chopped walnuts they would have been very bland. With those two additions everyone loved them! Yum!

Forgive me if the problem with this recipe was something I did, but these came out inedible.  I made them as directed, but used soured milk in place of buttermilk (maybe that was the problem?)  I had to bake them much longer than 30 minutes, and still they came out as dough balls.  I whipped up a batch of biscuits at the last minute and had to throw these away.
