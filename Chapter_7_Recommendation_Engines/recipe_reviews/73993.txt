My family loved this. There was nothing left. I added salt & pepper to the potatoes. I marinated my chicken in 1/4 cup lime juice, cilantro and 1 1/2 cup salsa (I used fresh from the refrigerated section of the grocery) before baking. I also sliced a lime very thin with a mandolin and added it to the marinade. When I added the chicken to the potatoes, I put all the marinade in too. I covered and baked this for 25 minutes at 425 and then reduced the heat to 350 for another 30 minutes. I uncovered the pan and added the cheese and baked for a few more minutes. The salsa and lime flavors are a great combination. I will serve this to company.

Read alot of reviews before making this. I marinated the chicken in 1/2 cup mild salsa to which I had added 1 Tblsp. fresh lime juice for 1/2 hour. While it was marinating I sliced the potatoes fairly thin and cut each slice into 4 pieces,  put them in my roaster pan(14x9) which was lined with heavy duty foil, sprayed with Pam, lightly salted and peppered them, sprinkled some onion flakes over them and drizzled the tablespoon of melted butter over them and tossed. Baked for 15 min. in preheated 425 oven. Took pan out, pushed potatoes along side of pan and put the chicken in the middle, brushed pieces with the remaining butter and tablespoon of lime juice which I mixed in a small bowl. Returned to oven for 10 minutes. Mixed Newmans Black Bean & Corn Salsa & parsley together, poured over chicken, baked at 425 covered for 25 minutes, reduced oven temp to 375 and cooked another 20 minutes. Removed foil and sprinkled Sargento Reduced Fat 4 Cheese Mexican over chicken and potatoes and put back in oven for 5 minutes. This is so good. I will be making this often.

This dish is absolutely wonderful and fresh.  I made a few changes in ingredients.  I had sauteed chicken earlier in the day so I had that on hand.  I baked the potatoes at 425 for the time mentioned, pushed them aside and dropped the temp to 325 (since my chicken had been cooked earlier) and returned it to the oven until heated through.  I also used dried chives in place of the cilantro I didn't have on hand and also used Italian blend of cheeses in place of the Mexican blend.  My husband and I LOVED it and I plan to keep this and make it for family and friends.  Thanks Kellly!!

I made this again for the first time in about 5 years.  I've up'ed it to a 5 and wanted to re-review but I see no way to just delete an old review, so I'll just add to it.  The original:  I liked this as is.  I didn't have Mexican cheese and used a combo of Jack, mozarella & Colby.  Otherwise it was made as is, including temperature, cooking times, etc.  And I thought the chicken was fine and unlike others, the potatoes seemed to tend to overcook.  Perhaps I cubed mine smaller?  I made it a second time, got lazy & didn't use the foil and it didn't turn out as well.  I think potatoes do work well in foil.  I liked that I could do everything in the oven and not cook anything ahead of time.  New additional comments:  This time I had a Mexican combo and that may have made a difference.  I taste-tested and rather wondered why I'd even given it a 4, but it was much better as a whole put-together dish, eating chicken & potatoes together.  I think the butter is necessary, both in terms of allowing the potatoes to get cooked (and I stirred them) and to make them tender.  My oven temp is right on and I think these times work but big chunks vs cubed will take longer.  It also doesn't specify a size for the potatoes, and mine were probably about 5 oz, give or take.

This is a family favorite. The only things I do differently is I make a little more sauce (salsa/cheese/cilantro) because we like it, and I also add a can of corn which I spread over the chicken and potatoes. I've served it to company, and they loved it as much as we do.

Yum, Yum!  I also marinated this for about 30 minutes in 1 TBSP lime juice and 1/2 Cup salsa.  Then I used another 1/2 Cup salsa with the cheese mixture.  Also roasted the potatoes for about 25 minutes before I added the chicken.  It was really, really good!

I'm changing my review to five stars, I made again last night and it was so amazingly simple, easy, and delicious it deserves it!  I don't make the chicken, just the potatoes, we just weren't thrilled with the chicken part the first time, but these potatoes will be on the menu at least a few times a month. Thanks!

I know everyone hates when people give less stars when they changed the recipe, so I am giving it 5 stars even though I did make some changes. It was delicious, and it doesn't have to be so unhealthy, either. Here's what I did differently. I used about a pound of yukon gold potatoes, tossed them with 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, about 1/2 teaspoon of cumin, and 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt. Then added about 3 tablespoons of chopped fresh cilantro. I followed the baking directions, then added the chicken breasts, about 1 pound total, each breast half sliced in half again so they were thin. I melted 1 tablespoon of butter, added about 2 tablespoons of cilantro, and squeezed half a lime in. This I brushed on the chicken. Baked again. Took it all out, poured 1/4 cup salsa over the chicken (cherry salsa, yum!), then topped with about 1/4 cup of cheese...it doesn't need much because everything else makes it so good! With those changes it comes out to about 340 calories per serving (of 4) which is much better than the original. Perfect, easy and fast to assemble.

I will give this another try...should've read the reviews before making it.  Definitely needed to marinate - the chicken was bland underneath the sauce. It was also rubbery b/c of the high temp cooking that took about 15 mins longer than stated.  Next time I'll marinate and drop the oven temp after about 25 mins as another reviewer did.  The lime flavor was refreshing!  Such an easy recipe that it deserves a second chance!

Delicious! I made only a few changes: I floured and browned the chicken breasts in a skillet as a previous reviewer, added more lime juice, added a can of black beans that I poured over the chicken before the cheese/salsa mixture. I also added fresh mushrooms. I really liked the fresh lime flavor. Very good and easy. Thanks!

My husband absolutely LOVED this receipe!  My one year old did too!  I highly recommend this easy, fast prepared dish to all that wish to add some flavor to their dinner tables.  This one packs a nice punch!  Only suggestion: is I added some salt and pepper to both the chicken and potatos..plus I cut back on the butter on the chicken.

Really great recipe!  I used small new red potato halves, letting this roast to a slight crispiness.  Then doubled all other ingredients to top chicken.  Thanks so much for this new family favorite.

My boyfriend and i just ate this and it was amazing! I marinated the chicken in salsa and lime juice for an hour.Then I cooked the chicken and potatoes covered with the salsa, salt, pepper, lime juice and cilantro in the preheated oven at 425 degrees for twenty minutes then added a cup of monterey jack cheese and mixed it in. Then cooked it at 350 degrees for ten minutes. Amazing!

Great recipe, did a few things different. I sauteed the chicken in garlic, butter (used 1/4 c total) lime juice, salt, pepper and cayenne pepper before adding to the potatoes in the oven. Also I added salt, pepper and cayenne pepper to the potatoes before roasting, they definetly need more than 10 minutes to cook, mine were in the oven for almost 30 min (added chicken and salsa/cilantro for last 15, and cheese just a few minutes before to melt over the top).

Delicious and so easy!  I  used about 1/4c of butter. I have also been using chicken thighs instead of breasts and it's even better.

Made the dish as posted with some salt and peper as mentioned and a little more cheese.  Should have cooked the potatoes longer before adding chicken.  They just didn't seemed cooked enough for me.  Other than that, everyone loved the dish.  Next time I might marinate the chicken in some salsa, lime and cilantro beforehand (didn't have time tonight), would be great with the flavors infused in the chicken rather than just on top.  But a wonderful quick dish that will be in the rotation!

My family seldom agrees on anything I make for dinner, but in this case I was shocked to find all thumbs up in agreement.  I'm always on the look for a new recipe bullet to add to the dinner gun, and decided that chicken and potatoes were a sadly neglected option.  This was the first of three that I printed off, so hopefully the others come close.  I did microwave the potatoes for three minutes after dicing them, and I found that smaller breasts work better than larger ones.  I especially liked the fresh taste of the cilantro.  My son finished off the leftovers tonight and raved about the taste of the potatoes after they had picked up the flavor of the salsa, cheese and cilantro.  I will make it again, possibly with a bit more salsa and cilantro just to spread the flavors around a little more, but the baseline recipe is a fresh tasting, family friendly entree.

6/11 very good. i marinated the chicken in fresh lime juice and 1/4 cup salsa.  I put marinade in the dish with the ckn to cook, didn't take long. when it was not pink, i added the salsa, cheese combo...didnt have cilantro.
9/14 next time, cook potatoes 20 min first. and chicken 10-15. it was a little dry.

*EXCELLENT* recipe! Our whole family loved it!  The lime juice made the dish!
I took one reviewer's tip and marinated the chicken in lime juice & salsa before baking. Also, I was low on salsa, so I mixed what I had with a can of diced tomatoes; it still turned out great!
I could write a thank-you note to the recipe poster for the foil-in-dish instruction! Clean up was a breeze!

I liked this a lot...in fact, I changed my supper plans for tonight when I saw the recipe on the Buzz. I made it *almost* exactly, except I used fingerling potatoes and cooked them with a mix of bueer and olive oil at 425, then dropped the temp to 375 when added the chicken and finished cooking. I also salted everything when I added the lime and butter (cut drastically). My chicken was butterflied, so it only took about 15 minutes to cook before I added the salsa/cheese/cilantro mixture. I'll definitely make this again and I'm using the leftover potatoes (chicken is all gone) with eggs to make breakfast burritos. Thanks for a recipe that really sings!

I made this in 2 pans, one with salsa one without for the kids. the lime was a nice change from our usual chicken dishes but  it was much better without the salsa.

Very different! I never really thought of mixing cilantro, tomatoes, and potatoes but it turned out really good. I love cilantro, and this had a lot so if you aren't a fan of cilantro this might not be for you. But since I LOVE it, I loved this dish.

This was pretty good, but I had to do ALOT of modifying. The potatoes were practically raw after the short time in the oven, so I ended up cooking those for much longer then was stated.  I marinated the chicken in lime juice and a mexican chili marinade to give it some flavor.  I also seasoned the potatoes ahead of time with seasoned salt, pepper, garlic powder, lime juice, cilantro and red pepper flakes to give them some flavor.  Overall, a good base recipe

The potatoes didn't have much flavor. I tried to spice them up a little, but it didn't work too well. I wasn't really impressed as everything was just sort of "blah". Don't know if I will make this one again.

Awesome!  My wife loved this dish and so did I.  Just tweaked a couple of things.  Mixed the cilantro with the salsa but added the cheese separately.  Put the salsa mixture of chicken breasts only and cheese over all.  Yummy!

Pretty tasty, though it took me WAY longer to cook the chicken because I didn't have the right dish. I had to add additional lime juice to keep it from getting too dry. Whether you have it cook right or not, I still would suggest adding a bit extra salsa. I used black bean and corn salsa and it was tasty.

I loved this recipe. If your chicken is thick like mine was you should definitely pound it until it is thinner.  Also I wish I had made more of the cheese/salsa/cilantro mixture to put over the top.  It's the best part.  Would have given five stars, but daughters didn't finish. Husband and son had two servings each.

My family LOVED this! I didn't have cilantro so I used fresh green onions instead. It turned out wonderfully! My husband said that he wants me to make it again.
THANK YOU!

I was browsing for a dinner recipe and this was perfect! It tastes light and fresh, thanks to the lime and cilantro! I used a little more cheese, salsa and cilantro, just because I knew my family would like *tons* of the sauce, but the recipe is perfect as is! This was GREAT!

We LOVED this recipe! I will definitely cook again! Next time I will marinade like suggested. I had to cook the chicken for 45 minutes because they were big breast steaks but that is all I did different. Also, you can never have too much cilantro or lime so I probably was a lot more heavy handed. haha.

Wasn't bad but it didn't knock my socks off either.  I was expecting a nice boom of flavor but that didn't happen. I will try making it again but I will substitute half of the Mexican cheese blend with Mild Mexican flavored Velveeta. I think it will make a creamer, more flavorful dish.

Absolutely delicious! both my husband and I agreed that it is one of the best recipes we have tried on this site. I made some adjustments, however. I cooked the potatoes for 20 minutes. Instead of butter, I used olive oil and cut amount to about 1/4 cup. I put the salsa and cilantro over the chicken only. I spread the cheese over the whole dish for the last 3-5 minutes. Thank you for posting this recipe!

This sure was an easy and fast dish to prepare. Less than an hour total.  It didn't have a lot of flavor though and was a little bland. I added some Season All to the potatoes and I am glad I did they sure needed some taste.  The Hungry Teen loved this dish, the rest of us voted not to have it again, so mixed reviews here. Thanks Kelly.

This is simple and really great!  I marinate my chicken in the lime juice, cilantro and salsa.  I use a jar of hot salsa and put extra lime and cilantro in.  After baking the potatoes I add the chicken and pour the entire marinade/sauce and then back.  IT IS FANTASTIC!!!

This recipe was not that good.  The chicken was cooked for the time in the recipe but it was dry and there would have been no flavor to it other then from the salsa and cheese.  Both the chicken and potatoes were very bland.

Pleasantly surprised.  After reading the ingredients, I wasn't sure about this but gave it a go because of good ratings.  The only thing I did differently was cooked the potatoes for 15 min instead of 10 and sprinkled them with chili powder, salt and pepper.  As for the chicken, I seasoned them with salt, pepper and garlic powder and just before serving, I squeezed fresh lime juice over the top.  Great!

Very good and very simple!  Easy recipe for a working mom! I did call home ahead of time and have the kids marinate the chicken in 1 tbsp. lime and 1/4 cup salsa ahead of time.  Will enjoy this again!

The lime juice is interesting, and this turned out ok, but I couldn't help but feel like I'd cheated both the chicken and the potatoes by this cheesy compromise.

We LOVE this dish! We've made it a few times and for us, we cut the butter to 1/4 cup, and the potaoes to 4. We cook the potatoes for 15 - 20 minutes (instead of 10)before adding the chicken because they kept being undercooked. We have used both red potatoes and Idaho potatoes and both work fine. 
Love the lime and cliantro flavors!

My husband and I just loved this (tho I had a hard time convincing our kids that cilantro tastes good :-)  I used 1/2 cup cilantro because I just adore it.  But it can be overpowering, so be careful.  I used the juice from 1 lime rather than the 1 tbs. the recipe called for.  Also, the potatoes need more flavor.  I suggest spicing them up well before putting them in the pan, and then pouring any leftover lime-butter over them.  Will definitely be making this one many times!

I served this to my hubby and a girlfriend of mine and they absolutely loved it. I left out the cilantro because I really don't care for it. They thought the recipe was a keeper and I'm preparing it again tonight.

This was an awesome recipe!  It was delicious & quick, and it's definitely one of our new favorites. I used Pace Chunky Salsa and I left out the cilantro.  I was pleased that (even applying generously) I didn't need nearly as much butter as the recipe called for. The leftovers tasted even better, especially the potatoes.

Awesome! My husband even had seconds!! I added a little salt , pepper, and  seasoning salt to the potatoes at the beginning, and added a little extra salsa and cilantro to the cheese because I love salsa and cilantro. I used baby small potatoes cut in half since I didn't have any medium ones. It came out sooo gooood!! I can't say enough about how good this turned out. It is definately worth a try!

Wow, this one was delicious!  This is what I did: I put the potatoes with chopped onions in a ziploc bag.  To the butter I added salt, garlic and Monterey seasoning (McCormick).  I poured this into the ziploc to coat evenly.  I then roasted them in the oven for 15 minutes.  With the chicken, I coated them in flour and sage and fried them in a skillet for about 4-5 minutes on each side.  I took the potatoes out of the oven and added mushrooms, put the chicken in, covered with the butter and lime and baked for about 25 minutes.  This was delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

I really love this recipe.  I follow it exactly as it says except I added about a 1/2 cup more of the cheese.  If you like that Cheesy Chicken dish at Fridays.......you will love this one!!!

Delicious!  As others have done before, I marinated the chicken in lime juice and salsa before hand as well as doubling the salsa / cheese sauce.  Yummy :)

This was an easy and tasty meal that most of the kids ate.  I used mild salsa to make it less spicy for the little ones and the ones that did eat it, loved it.  The adults all enjoyed it.  I did marinate the chicken ahead of time as suggested by others.  It all disappeared so I'll definitely make this again!

I made this last night and my husband LOVED it.  I marinated the chicken in the salsa and lime juice as suggested by other reviewers.  I also cooked the potatoes a lot longer that 10 minutes.  Probably more like 25 minutes.  I will definitely make this one again!

What a great recipe! It was simple and fairly fast - about an hour, not including the marinating time. I took the advice of marinating the chicken first for a couple hours in the salsa and lime juice. It was tender and moist and full of flavor. I used real limes and fresh salsa - maybe that added the flavor dimension. And I found that 10 minutes was not enough time to roast the potatoes. I ended up roasting them for about 20-25 minutes and that seemed about right. I also used boneless, skinless chicken breast and cut them up so they cooked faster. Wonderful, wonderful - will be making again!

Like posted in other reviews, the potatoes def. need to cook longer. Marinating the chicken beforehand in salsa, lime juice and cilantro creates the most tender, delicious chicken ever. The second time I made it, I skipped the potatoes and served with black beans and rice... OMG- so good! One of my best meals!

So easy and delicious. Only thing I would change is use less butter. Between the butter and cheese, it came out too oily. I followed the recipe exactly and unlike other reviews, my chicken & potatoes came out tender and delicious. Husband and I both really liked it. Will definitely  make again.

Although I did a few things differently, this turned out great!  It was a hot day today so I tried it on the grill by using non-stick tin foil and making packets.  I also did the potatoes in a separate packet than the chicken because it was just too much stuff in one packet.  My husband loved it and my 3 yr old even at the chicken after I took the cheesy topping off:).  I also added some Penszey's "Fajita" seasoning to both the chicken and the potatoes and used scallion rather than cilantro.  We will be having this one again!

This was a very tasty receipe but the potatoes need to bake about 15 minutes longer before you put the chicken in the pan.  The potatoes were wonderful and I will make it again

Didn't care for the chicken, but like other reviewers I liked the potatoes. Will possibly cook them like that again. The chicken tho, hmmm...I think it didn't soak in enough of the flavor. Maybe season it a bit more, then marinate it in the lime sauce for more flavor and brown it for better texture? It had enough potential to try some new things with it, so I may. For now, as is, 3 stars.

This is an amazing recipe! My husband likes to pick up roasted chicken and rotisserie chicken from the deli when they close and it goes for half price. I used 2 pkg deli roasted chicken. Roasted the potatoes first until they were almost done, then arranged the cut up deli chicken in the middle with the lime butter until nice and browned, then the salsa and cilantro, topped with Mexican crumble cheese and put back in just until the cheese melted.  Fantastic!

Good recipe idea.  I tweaked to make it 5 stars.  For those who found dry, bland chicken..a couple of suggestions... marinate the chicken overnight with lime zest ,finely chopped garlic and lemon pepper and olive oil to coat.  Do not add lime juice at this time as it will ''cook'' the chicken.  Also either microwave the potatoes part cooked or start them earlier than chicken . Breasts do not need more than 35 min. or more if thick or dark meat is used.

This was a yummy meal and simple to prepare.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and marinated the chicken in lime juice and salsa for several hours in the fridge before baking it.  I reduced the temperature to 400, cooked the potatoes for 20 minutes before adding the chicken, then cooked the chicken for 35 minutes (I used very thick chicken breasts).  The potatoes were crispy on the outside and soft inside and the chicken was moist and flavorful.

The only change I made was  adjusting it for my family of 6. 
Everyone ate it!  Even the potato-hater and the chicken-hater. 
It's not like, "oh my gosh - amazing!",  but it was really good. :)
I loved the one-pan aspect and the fact that  it was all made from real food. :)
Thanks for sharing!  We will make it again. :)

Eh. I was excited about this dish, but wasn't thrilled with how it turned out. I had to cook the potatoes WAY longer than the recipe said, and they still didn't get as cooked as I would like. I added some spices to the lime juice and butter mixture for the chicken but it still was kind of bland. Hubby liked it all, but said it was too much cilantro.

Amazing dish! My tweaks. I marinated the chicken in lime juice, Sazon, adobo, & Medium Picante Salsa (my family loves spicy food). I let that marinated while I chopped up the potatoes. I seasoned the potatoes with Roasted Potato Seasoning & also added two tbsp in melted butter. I followed the baking directions as normal. I didn't have the mixed Mexican shredded cheese so I used what I had- shredded mozzarella & cut up slices of velveta cheese, cilantro & mixed with salsa- then spread on the chicken and potatoes. Potatoes were probably the best part- so much flavor! This is top five of my best dishes now. Delicious! Amazing flavor!

The whole family loved it! But I also marinated the chicken in lime juice and salsa for about half an hour first. I also added onion and mushrooms to the potatoes which gave it a burst of flavor. I would use more lime juice next time.

I.loved.this. And my family did, too. Super-easy with simple ingredients for a busy wife and mom. I followed this as written, except cutting butter to 1/4 cup. Served with a side of fresh, homemade guacamole and blue corn tortilla chips.

This recipe had good flavor but it took much longer to cook than stated, about 15 more minutes. If I make it again I will butterfly the chicken breasts. Also, I sliced the potatoes very thinly as recommended by other posters.

I made a few changes to this recipe, so I wasn't sure on how to rate it.   First, I seasoned the potatoes with melted butter and chili powder. I roasted the potatoes at 425* for 20 minutes.   I pounded the chicken breasts to about 1/4"  Instead of doing a butter/lime mixture, I brushed the butter on the chicken and covered it with Italian seasoned bread crumbs.   I baked the chicken with the potatoes at 375* for 15-20 min. I then squeezed fresh lemon juice over the chicken. Covered the top with the cheese, followed by the salsa and baked again for about 5 more min.   It came out delicious! I usually make enough food so there's leftovers to take for work the next day for me and my brother. Sad to say, that there weren't enough leftovers for me.

Too much butter, need more salsa for more flavor other then a mouth full of butter, and cooking the chicken at 425 degrees is way too hot. It over dried my chicken. My bf didnt like it whatsoever and I thought it was okay with future adjustments. Maybe I'll make it again...

My boyfriend and I have a "dish of the week" competition. We each cook a new dish on our days off and this one won hands down. The only down side was that he made it and got the credit. I would not change anything - This is a keeper.

This was super easy and turned out way tastier than I had expected. The chicken did need to bake for about 20 extra minutes and I think next time I will try the suggestions of marinating the chicken in lime juice. The potatoes were super yum.  Thanks!

This a tasty, quick, throw together dinner. I did change a few things with the way I did mine. I cut my potatoes into quarters and ended up using 8. I used 3 breasts that I cut into 1 inch pieces. Sprinkled the potatoes with a tsp of chili powder. Used half butter and half olive oil and added 2T lime juice, 1 tsp garlic powder, S&P to taste to the mixture BEFORE tossing a couple of Tbs of the mixture with the potatoes. Poured remaining butter/olive oil mixture of chicken (the mixture starts to thicken because of the cold chicken, but that's ok since it melts as soon as you add to the potatoes later on)and let it sit for about 25 minutes while the potatoes roasted at 425. Tossed the chicken and all of the butter/olive oil mixture with the potatoes and added about 6 chopped pickled jalapeno slices and continued cooking about 15-20 minutes. Added the cheese/salasa/cilantro (didn't have fresh used about a Tbs of dried) to the top. baked another 5 minutes just to melt and brown the cheese.  If you notice you have a lot of liquid in the pan from the chicken (this happened the first time when I used frozen breasts that I allowed to thaw) just turn the heat up to 450 for a few minutes before adding the cheese. The liquid starts to evaporate.  We eat this at least a couple of times a month.

I followed recipe (except I did marinate chicken in lime & salsa) and it turned out WONDERFUL.  YUM.  This will be added into our regular rotation.  It was much easier than I even expected it to be.  Be sure and cube the potatoes small or they won't cook in the time frame stated. Mine were about 1" (or less) cubes and they turned out perfect.

This is very good, great for a weeknight meal. I think I used about 2 pounds of red potatoes, and only 2 chicken breasts (it was just me and my 2 year old). I needed more time to cook the potatoes since I had way more than called for, but the time for the chicken worked really well. I also didn't use the butter but simply tossed the potatoes with olive oil, salt and pepper. Very good, I can't wait to finish the leftovers tonight.

This is amazing--my fiancee is always asking me to make this for supper!  This is a dish we will be making when we have guests over for special occasions.  I read a lot of the reviews and I too marinate the chicken in salsa, cilantro, and lime juice before cooking it--it gives the chicken a really great flavor.  The potatoes are amazing...I like making a little more than the recipe calls for because I think they almost taste better as left overs the next day!  I always says I'm going to measure everything out, but in the end I always end up adding a little more salsa, cilantro, and cheese than the recipe calls for just because we love the extra flavor it provides.

Definetly lower temp @ the end!  I added just a little extra butter cuz I was afraid it would be dry.  My husband is Mexican and Puerto Rican who says he does not compare my cooking to his mother's, but he does, they all do.  He loved this and had seconds right away!

My wife and I liked it with the salsa but the kids aren't salsa fans so i modified the recipe for them. I fried some bacon slices until they were semi cooked (not crisp) and put them over the chicken for the 20 minute cooking...then i topped them with cheese for the last few minutes until the cheese melted. The kids preferred it that way...now everybody's happy....

This was simply amazing! We cooked the recipe exactly and it came out wonderful. It was very simple and very delicious. Make sure you don't add too many potatoes as any not able to soak up some butter from the bottom may dry out as they cook. I'll also be making some extra of the salsa/cilantro/cheese mix next time to pour some over the potatoes as well as coating the chicken.

Great, easy, one dish recipe.  I marinanated my chicken breast with garlic, lime juice, and taco seasoning for about 2 hours before cooking.  Also used double the salsa, taco seasoning on potatoes, green onions, and crushed red peppers to give it a little kick!

Ease of preparation: 5 stars.  Reviews  of flavor given to me by people who ate it: 5 stars (“I think this is my favorite thing you’ve ever made”).  Texture and appearance: 5 stars (very moist chicken and everything looked great).  My review of the flavor: 4 stars, merely because I think the chicken needed a spice rub before I put it in the oven, but others disagreed.  Timing of recipe: 4 stars, as the potatoes were slightly underdone but definitely edible.  When I was looking for recipes, I wanted something easy which used stuff in my kitchen so I could avoid the trip to the store, but also nice enough I could serve to guests.  I wanted something light, yet hardy, that I could add vegetables to in order to make it healthy.  This fit the bill perfectly.  Very easy to customize as long as you use quality ingredients.  You can throw in onion and peppers to roast with the potatoes and you can put a can corn and/or beans into the salsa without disrupting the flavor balance.  My advice regarding the potatoes: slice them small and they will come out tender.  Also if the chicken is finishing before the potatoes, adding the salsa early will help soften the potatoes as well.  This will be a repeat performer at my house.

I have made this twice now.  Followed the recipe fairly closely, with exception of putting the salsa on the chicken as soon as I put it in the oven and I just used whatever cheese I had on hand.  I used Paul Newman corn and black bean salsa and it was wonderful both times!

Marinated the chicken breasts in the salsa and lime as suggested by other posters. Omitted the butter for the sake of lower fat and the result was still fantastic. A keeper recipe!

The taste was wonderful, especially after adding salt, pepper, and a little chili powder.  The times, however, are off.  Using others' suggestions, I doubled the time for the potatoes before adding the chicken, and they still were not done.  I ended up removing the chicken from the pan because it was becoming overdone, then letting the potatoes cook another 5 or 10 minutes.  The only other change I made was sliced some green, red, and yellow bellpepper (I really like vegetables and wanted to add a little nutrition content) and added it to the pan at the same time as the chicken.  I will have to try this again with time adjustments, and next time might roll it up in tortillas and eat it like a burrito

So good my husband called me to tell me it was amazing. Only changes: added 1/2 c salsa and 1/2 c cheeses to original recipe and then drizzled an extra tablespoon of lime over everything. Flipped chicken halfway through cook time and basted again. Definitely a keeper, thanks for sharing!

This will be a keeper in my recipe book. I pulled out my chicken to thaw. While it was thawing I topped with some salsa and lime juice like some had said. I cooked my potatoes a bit longer then suggested. I thought it was easy to make and tasted great. Very fresh.

This was a very good and easy to make dish!  I did add sea salt and ground pepper to the potatoes along with the butter.  I added the salsa/cheese mixture sooner to the chicken and potatoes for added time and extra flavor.  Next time I will add some zing with some japs or pepper flakes/spices and make it spicy for a different taste.

This dish was amazing! I took the advice from some of the other reviews. I added salt and pepper to the potatoes for more flavor. I also used chickn stock to give the chicken and potatoes more flavor. The chicken stock also made the dish super juicy!

This was tasty.  Nothing gourmet here, but my picky one asked for seconds.  I would cut the butter in half.  My daughter was making cookies so I used what she had left.  I left the oven temp at 425 and my chicken was NOT dry.  I will make this again.  It is easy and I always have all the ingredients in the house.

This could be a great recipe with a few adjustments.  The butter needs to be cut waaaaay back.  At the end, the dish was swimming in butter (and I had used approximately 1/3 cup only, not the 1/2 as in the recipe).  The potatoes need to cook alone a little longer, maybe 15 minutes.  I'll add more lime juice next time.  I will make this again with these changes.

I used Idaho potatoes (didn't have red), dried cilantro (didn't have fresh), and bottled lime juice and this recipe still came out great. Based on the other reviews, I turned the heat down to 350 when I put the chicken in and I think that kept it tender and moist. Next time I will leave the potatoes in longer to crisp them some and will cut down on the butter.  But it's a great recipe and has definitely made it into our rotation!

I was kind of disappointed with this recipe.  It tasted much better after adding about a whole lime's worth of lime juice before eating (instead of just garnished lime wedges).

We absolutely loved this!! After reading reviews I too cut the butter down to 1/4 cup and it was plenty. I seasoned the potatoes with some garlic and taco seasoning before roasting for 15 min. Then added more garlic, grill seasoning and taco seasoning to the butter and lime juice and poured it over chicken and potatoes. My chicken breasts weren't huge, but had to bake them an additional 10 min. before putting the salsa/cheese mixture on. Will make this often!!

Delicious. Changes: I marinated the chicken in a little lime juice some salsa and cilantro for a short time. Didn't use so much butter on the chicken. Cooked at 425 for 20 min then down to 375 for about another 20 before adding the cheese mixture.

it was good changed it from mexican to italian because i did not have mexican cheese on hand at the time however, definately needs salt and pepper as well as seasonings, and cook the potatos longer than 10 minutes the first go around. Most of ours were cooked but many were still hard. i would guess about 15 to 20 minutes longer the first time so that you do not dry the chicken out the second cooking time.

This was a great one dish meal.  Good taste.  We didn't add the salsa mixture over the potatoes since our kids wouldn't eat them if we did; we used a great baby gold variety that was excellent for roasting. Even without the full effect of the salsa mixture on the potatoes it was still good!

After the first time I made this, I liked it but wasn't over the moon about it. Second time around, I followed some other reviews' tips - I marinated the chicken in lime juice and salsa for a few hours, and I also cooked the potatoes for closer to 20 minute before adding the chicken. This resulted in much moister chicken and crispier potatoes, which I liked. The cheese/salsa/cilantro topping is so yummy, so now that I've got the chicken and potatoes worked out, I'll definitely add this to the regular repetoire.

This is a good, easy dinner recipe. I used chicken breast tenderloins, which decreased the baking time. The sauce went really well with both the potatoes and the chicken. I didn't use lime juice because I was out, but it was still delicious.

Overall, this exceeded my expectations. It was delicious!  I only needed 1/4 C melted butter (1/2 C was too much).  I had to bake my chicken twice as long also. Thanks, will make again!

This was very good!  I added extra cheese and salsa as well as suggested in the reviews. This will stay in my recipe box as a keeper!

Really good and simple to make.  To make sure the potatoes would be fully cooked, I first microwaved them on high for about 5 minutes under a damp cloth, then followed the directions.  I used green salsa because that's what I had on hand and it was great!

A flavourful, easy all-in-one meal. The butter-lime baste keeps the chicken very moist. The only change I made was to use half of the melted butter tossed with the potatoes instead of just 1 Tbsp, and the remaining 1/4 cup was mixed with the lime juice to brush onto the chicken before cooking. (My husband poured Ranch dressing over top of his, and I have to say it tastes GREAT combined with salsa/cheese topping!)

New & refreshing twist on chicken. I scaled the recipe for 2, but used the original amounts of salsa & lime juice. I used half for a marinade & the other halves as called out in the recipe. I sliced the potatoes thinly instead of cubing them & they turned out great. I only added about 5-10 minutes to the cooking time. Despite the topping, it does not overwhelm the chicken. Goes great with a green salad.

The cilantro adds great flavor! I used a little extra cheese and salsa after reading the other posts. Also added 10 minutes to the potatoes cooking time. I might try to use less butter next time and more lime juice. Excellent recipe!!

Loved it!  Next time, I'd cook the potatoes longer if you don't like them al dente.  Also, I'd make more of the cheese mixture because it was so good.  I will try this recipe on company because not only does it taste good, but it looks great coming out of the oven!  Definitely a keeper!!!

Very good flavors.  I love the potatoes and would consider doing them alone as a side dish with my chicken enchiladas!

This recipe was nothing special at all. I thought it a waste of my time and the ingredients. Sorry... but, It would have been better to make mashed potatoes and seasoned chicken breast.

Good but the potatoes took much longer to cook.  Cilantro and lime really made the flavor.

Only ok. It was too oily for me. When I put the chicken in the dish, I poured some of the butter/lime on the potatoes: that was a nice combination. However, I doubt I'll make this again.

This was so tasty!! It seemed like a perfect summer dish.  The one thing I would suggest as someone else suggested is marinating the chicken.  I'm sure it would bring the flavour out better.  Also our oven wasn't working, and we cooked it on the stove. Boiled the potatoes, cooked the chicken in a covered pot on low-medium. Then added potatoes to pot and topped with salsa.  Delicious!

Very good!  We had to cook ours a little longer to get the potatoes cooked.  My kids actually ate this one.  (Of course, they pulled the cilantro off their chicken as they ate it.)  I will make this one again.

Couldn't believe when I saw this recipe because I've made something very similar for years, but never with the potatoes.  What a great addition!  I never thought to add cilantro to my recipe...it was great!
