This is an excellent recipe for juicy, crispy chicken breast. I always read other reviews before trying any recipe and took the advise of another to put the chicken on a slotted baking pan to keep it from getting soggy. I didn't have any tarragon or ginger, but the crust was very well seasoned even without it. The mustard gave it a nice bite. However I did cut back on the pepper as suggested. I did find that the recommended amount of oil was not sufficient though. The flour soaked up a lot more than what was called for. You won't be sorry that you made this one.

This is a great recipe - brought back memories of My Auntie Grace & Great Auntie Vera's  awesome chicken.This is also good when chilled ,then sliced on diagonally, added to  salads, served on a bed of rice- or steamed spinach, its very versatile. I have some tips that work well: *lower the salt/pepper amount   *add 1- 1+1/2 tablespoon of garlic powder(best brand is Pride of Szegeo) I buy mine at The Butchers Shop or try a Deli. *set up EVERYTHING needed before hand and use tongs only to move chicken breasts, always grabbing at the same spot so the coating doesn't get messed up, if you have two tongs then even better-one for the egg mix & one for the flour mix +the flour tong  is used to also cook/remove meat from deep skillet & best pan to use  is cast iron   *used 1/2 - 3/4 cup of solid crisco * this also is great on scallopini-style meats of chicken, turkey, or pork -kind of like a thin schnitzel. * the resting periods are crucial to success as is using a rack- I used my huge cookie sheet  & put my large cake cooling rack on top, than laid down the meat.

I made this last night and I thought it was just okay-I did not like the fact that it became soggy on the bottom side after baking. However, my husband and mother in law really liked it! I did cut down on the salt and pepper-actually cut both in half.  Next time I may try to bake the chicken breasts on some sort of rack-maybe they would not get soggy that way.  I liked the idea of baking due to the fact that most often chicken breasts dry out when you fry them-and I don't like dark meat!  I will try again with a few adjustments!  Pretty good recipe.

The chicken breasts were crispy and moist.  Although there are a lot of herbs in the breading, they really add to the flavor.  However, way too much pepper and salt.  I'd recommend using only a teaspoon pepper and no more than 1 tablespoon salt.

My husband does not like chicken breasts, because they are too dry after cooking, so I usually buy only dark meat chicken.  However, I had some boneless skinless breasts I bought on sale and decided to use them for this recipe.  I used less of each spice than called for but, otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  They were so juicy, and the flavor so delicious, that I will definitely make them again.

Made this a few days ago and my husband and I love it. I didn't have thyme or tarragon, but the breading mixture still tasted great!

Ummmm, I'm really sorry, we just didn't like these at all. The ginger was overpowering from start to finish. It's all you smell, it'a all you taste. I love ginger but not in this recipe. They were edible but I won't be making them again. Sorry:(

This chicken was very moist on the inside and crispy on the outside.  My husband and teenage kids like it.  The combination of spices in the coating was a little too complex.  I would probably simplify the spices next time I make this. Overall it was tasty and not too difficult.  Thanks!

To prevent soggy bottom chicken breasts place a cooling rack (I used my toaster oven rack) over the baking sheet (I also lined the backing sheet with tin foil for easy cleanup).  This prevents the chicken from sitting in juices on the baking sheet so it's crispy all the way around.  Awesome recipe!  Oh, yea.  you can also leave out any spices you don't want/have if you'd like... it's still very good :)  First time I made it I didn't have ginger, dried mustard, or tarragon and it was still awesome.  Tonight I had the dried mustard and tarragon but still no ginger.  I think 20 minutes in the over was too much (my oven temp may just be off) so I'm going to try either turning down the oven a smidge or taking the chicken out a little early.  Thanks again, awesome dinner :D

I liked it at first but after a couple of bites the black pepper was biting back. I did enjoy using all of the different seasonings, it made me feel like a chef, lol. It did come out moist and crispy, and I liked that. I would definitely cut way back by at least half on the pepper though.

I made the recipe as stated & it was extremely dry & tasteless. Will make a sauce to go with it the next time. I made it with Costco frozen chicken breasts & thinking maybe that's why it was so blah. Will try fresh chicken & try again.

So good.  Pan fry in cast iron and bake on the slotted broiler pan for crispiness.

We enjoyed this.  We used thin chicken cutlets instead of breasts because we like them better.  We also followed the advice of other reviewers and placed it on a rack on top of a jelly roll pan to bake it, and it was very crispy.  I had told my husband to omit the ginger becasue I don't like it, but he snuck some in and it was good.

This is the tastiest and fastest recipe's ever! I made these in just about 40 minutes. I cut the chicken breasts into four pieces, smaller than the recipe, but the chicken cooks faster this way. I reduced the recipe to just two chicken breasts because it was mainly just for me - mom tried it and loved the taste. I don't have mustard or tarragon and so I used cayenne pepper & sweet paprika instead. The oregano taste pops out in this recipe. I'll definitely be making this again and again!

I've never been good at fried chicken, but even my picky son raved over this recipe. It was crisp, tender, juicy and perfectly seasoned.  Thanks!!

very moist!  liked the texture of the crust, but it was bland.  i also used butter in the oil to brown the chicken.  will try it again but will be heavier on the spices in the flour

Truly the best chicken dish I ever made.  The juiciness is locked right in and the spices, although stronger than in most similar recipes, really works in a Colonel Sanders kind of way!

This was a very taste recipe. Just to share a trick Chef John had when I was watching his chicken parm recipe. He says to put your flour in a shaker bottle (I used a salt shaker that had larger holes than normal) and instead of dredging in a mound of flour, just shake on enough to cover on both sides. It works really well. Gets the chicken very crisp without the breading falling off in the pan and it stays crisp in the oven. Also use very hot oil to brown.

Chicken tenders came out delicious with this recipe. It's a simple and fun recipe to make. I used less ginger (seemed like too much) and buttermilk instead of regular milk to make it a bit richer, but otherwise the spices are pretty much perfect. Tastes very similar to fancy restaurant chicken tenders, but better. Great blend. Be careful with the salt – some pieces came out a bit too salty, so just be sure to mix it up very carefully or maybe even add a bit less. Also, I don't really see the need to bake these after frying. If you cook them thoroughly while frying, there's no need to bake it and it will probably come out soggier than crispier to be honest. Definitely try this one.

3 stars because as BaysMommy commented, the chicken did get soggy on the bottom so next time I will try to overcome this by turning the chicken after 12 minutes. I love the method, but the herbs didn't hit the spot for me, however I will ALWAYS flour-egg-flour-rest my chicken from now on-- makes for a great crust that stays on!

Very good!  I gave my husband a knife to cut the chicken--but he didn't need it!  It was very tender & had great flavor.  I did use less S&P than the recipe suggested, but I kept the other seasonings/spices as per the recipe.  Even my picky pre-teen son and his friend loved it.  I don't really like fried chicken b/c it's too greasy for me, but my hubby loves fried chicken--this was a great mix...had enough of the "fried" flavor to satisfy him but wasn't greasy at all so I was happy.  Will definitely make again!

This chicken is delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly except for the thyme because I didn't have any (substitute with rosemary).  I did bake it on a rack like other reviewers suggested.  Didn't cut down on the salt but only did 1 TBSP of black pepper because I thought my kids might think it was spicy.  The blend of herbs was unbelievable, the chicken was juicy and crispy.  I served this chicken with potato wedges and "make your own salad" and it was a hit with all my kids and my husband couldn't stop telling me how good it was.  Thank you Alesia for this recipe.  I will keep it and make it regularly.

This is delicious chicken!!!!!  I'm giving it 4 stars because I didn't love the spice combo.  I made it again and switched out the ginger & tarragon with a heaping teaspoon of Cajun seasoning -- perfect.  I baked on a rack in the oven and used a really hot pan & oil -- it makes a big difference.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

I always have trouble cooking chicken. I either under cook and throw it out or over cook because I'm afraid I'm under cooking and it's NEVER juicy. Also I find it amazingly hard to get the chicken breast to have seasoning.  Still I find the seasoning of the breast a mystery! Anywho, this was great! The juiciest chicken I have EVER made!   Does anyone know if I brown the chicken a bit longer on frying pan will I be sacraficing the juices?

This indeed is the most tender and moist chicken I ever have ever tried.

I also added grated Parmesan cheese to the flour mix. What came out of the oven was pure delight.

Thanks.

I love this recipe! I've made it several times now and it has become a family favorite. To keep the chicken from getting soggy on the bottom while baking I line the baking pan with crinkled up foil. Every piece comes out crispy on the outside juicy on the inside.

I haven't tried this exact recipe of spices, but, I can tell you the technique of browning the chicken lightly in a small amount of oil, after you have dusted them with the spices you like in a flour mixture, and then placing the chicken on a small roasting rack over a glass dish (to catch the drippings) and baking in an oven of 300°F for 1 hour to 1hr 15min, will give you a beautiful moist chicken breast that is not soggy on the bottom.  One can use a cooling rack or roasting rack.  Just something to hold the chicken up allowing the oven air to flow around it. I've been baking chicken breast this way for years.  Enjoy!

Based on other reviews I used 1/2 the called for ginger and pepper.  I didn't use tarragon only because I didn't have any.  My very picky boyfriend who usually adds hot sauce to everything LOVED this chicken.  He said it had a great flavor, similar to KFC.  He didn't even need to use any hot sauce. :) Although since he loves spicy food he did say he might add something to make it spicy next time.

Hmm... I'll start with the positive- the chicken was very moist. I was able to easily cut it with my fork. However, the skin was disappointing. Some of the skin fell off in the skillet. More of the skin stuck to the bottom of the cookie sheet. A little of the skin (left on the chicken) had soft uncooked dough-like flour/egg remaining. I also did not care for the seasoning...  Too much for me... Sorry, I will not make this again. I will, however, let the chicken rest for 10 minutes, fry and then bake as recommend. I believe this contributed to the even cooking and moist meat.

My boyfriend told me this was the best thing I'd ever prepared...so I'd say it was a success! I too only added half the amount of pepper and a little less than a tablespoon of ground mustard.  I also placed the chicken on a cookie cooling rack over a baking sheet to prevent sogginess. Thanks for this recipe!

I am a terrible cook, but I couldn't even mess this up!  I didn't have any tarragon or ginger, but it still turned out great.  The outside wasn't overly crispy, but just enough to keep the chicken really moist and tender.  I used a cookie sheet, and didn't have any problems with the bottom being soggy.  My husband is a VERY picky eater, and he said he wouldn't change a thing!

I should have known that I wouldn't be a huge fan of the flavors but I thought I'd give it a go anyway. The chicken was moist and the coating stayed on so that's always a plus. The tarragon and ginger (I love ginger by the way), were just too overwhelming. Just a tip...if you spray a wire rack with cooking spray and place the chicken on that prior to baking, there won't be any issue of a soggy bottom as some have noticed. I gave it 4 stars because I'm sure it tasted exactly like it was supposed to and as stated, I should have known that it would not be the best flavors for my palette.

My 13 yr. old gives this recipe two thumbs up!  Reviews were very helpful to perfect recipe. Agree with comment to reduce spices, especially ginger, thyme, salt and pepper. The measurements seemed excessive, so I used two teaspoons instead of one tablespoon and omitted the Tarragon.  As for the soggy bottom comment, line baking pan with heavy foil and spray lightly with non-stick oil. Transfer chicken immediately after removing from oven. Chicken was crisp on both side and juicy.  I'll definitely make this again.

Love this recipe! By far the best fried chicken I have ever tried! I don't usually like to change the recipe before rating it but for this one, there was such an abundance of reviews saying to cut back on salt and pepper that I did. I cut both in half and it was perfect! I accidentally pulled chicken thighs out of the freezer instead of chicken breasts and it was still amazing. I just cut off all the fat first, rinsed and patted dry then started the breading process. The only other thing I did differently was that I put the chicken on a slotted cooking sheet (like another reviewer said) and it ended up perfectly crispy on both sides. I can't say enough good things about this recipe! A must try.

While I like the concept, the coating did not suit my taste. However, I will continue to adjust the seasonings to suit my taste.

I was looking for a quick meal and found this and it was indeed quick and tasty and moist inside.  The amount of spices seemed over the top to me.  I made 1/2 a recipe and cut the spices to 1 tsp. each and it worked out fine.  We dipped the chicken in sweet and sour sauce.

Maybe it's that I'm not the biggest fan of fried food. Good not great. Family seemed to think it was o.k Even skipping the second breading it still was too much coating for my liking. Seemed a little bland actually but maybe I cut back too much on the salt & pepper though I would have thought all the other seasonings would have compensated for that.

We thought the ginger, garlic powder and tarragon were just overpowering. Reducing to one teaspoon (not tablespoon) of the ginger and tarragon would be more appropriate, and fresh garlic always contributes a superior flavor to its powdered counterpart. Additionally, just putting the chicken on a baking sheet and baking that in the oven ensures a resultant soggy bottom, as the pieces will sit in their own juices as they cook. Placing the chicken on a rack over the baking sheet will obviate that problem. The meat was moist. But as is, this did not result in a flavor that appeals to us, and the soggy bottoms compounded a less-than-successful dinner.

Half the salt and pepper. 
Had to fry again once out of the oven because the chicken got mushy.

This has become a staple in our house. The only alteration I made to the recipe is to use homemade breadcrumbs instead of the flour. Makes great leftovers, too.

I have been trying (unsuccessfully) for years to make a decent fried chicken b/c my mom & grandma raised the bar high!  This was an easy recipe to follow and the chicken was quite good!  Not quite as good as my mom's.... but definitely sets me well on the right track!

Turned out great!  I didn't quite add the full amount of the specified seasonings, but added 2 tablespoons of chicken rub on my end.  To avoid the soft bottom from the baking sheet in the oven, I put it on the open grill in my Traeger for 20 minutes at 350.  Family loved it, I will definitely make it again.

I used chicken tenderloins bought from Costco and made about 30; aldo substituted coconut milk for cows milk and it turned out great.  sealed them and froze for dinners later. Great substitute for store bought, frozen processed garbage. Make some honey mustard from scratch to compliment this recipe.  My boys love these!

I have made this twice.  
This was good exactly as written (a bit salty and I did put the chicken on a rack to keep it from getting soggy on the bottom when baking).  
The second time the spices I used were one  tablespoon lemon pepper, one tablespoon Italian seasoning, one tablespoon of salt and one of pepper and a teaspoon of both dry mustard and garlic powder.  Came out great and a bit more to our families tastes.

My husband and I did enjoy the chicken. It was crispy and moist. I didn't have terragon or ginger which was one change I made to the recipe.  As with another reviewer, I used more oil to brown the chicken. I also agree with another reviewer and should have read this before making the dish and I felt the recipe called for too much salt and pepper and I like things salty:) I recommend making sure you make a gravy to counteract the saltiness. We also ate this dish with white rice and the gravy was an especially nice addition to the meal.

Fantastic!  My hubby, who is incredibly finicky, absolutely loved the coating on the chicken, as did I.  I put the flour mixture in a bag to coat the chicken...I just think it is easier and less messy than using a plate or shallow bowl.  The seasoning is perfect!  Next time, we may dredge the chicken in the egg mixture again, with a few more dredgings of flour, as we love this crust so much we want more!  Thanks for the BEST chicken coating we have ever used!!!!

Love this recipe, we don't usually like chicken breasts because they are too dry. I had some costco breasts and thought we would try a new recipe. This is the 2nd time I've made this recipe, still don't have any tarragon but other than that I followed the recipe, I like to read reviews so I baked them on a slotted broiler pan. Definitely a keeper, thanks for sharing...

We really enjoyed this recipe and have added it into our regular cooking rotation. The chicken had a great flavor from all the seasonings, and the meat itself was very juicy with a nice, crispy coating. We baked it on a rack over a baking sheet to help prevent the sogginess other reviewers complained about - it helped a lot. I have a hard time keeping chicken breasts from getting dried out, but these were so moist. To go with it, I made a milk-based chicken gravy with the browned bits in the pan and poured it over the chicken and mashed potatoes. Delicious and very, very easy.

I have made this several times over the last few months and everyone has loved it.  It is a great recipe!  Thanks!

I modified the spices by decreasing the amount and I pound out the breasts flat with a meat tenderizer before breading so I can cook them completely in the pan.

I made this tonight.  It was awesome!  My whole family really liked it - even the one who does not like chicken.  I took the advice of a couple of reviews and backed it on a rack which kept the bottom of the chicken from getting soggy.  My only difficulty was that it did stick.  Will have to try to spray the rack before I put the chicken on it.  Otherwise, this was really flavorful and moist.

Tried this recipe with my parents and it was a huge hit. Tarragon is my new favorite spice, definitely made the chicken awesome. It was amazingly flavorful.

So good! With a couple slight changes.  I marinated my chicken in buttermilk, a dash of cayenne, tablespoon of Dijon, salt, pepper, and two minced cloves of garlic for about 2 hours.  Then, dipped in flour, egg, flour and picked up with pan fry and bake.  Left out the tarragon, ginger, thyme, garlic powder and oregano.  Delicious!!

Made this tonight-my first time frying chicken.  Super good, rave reviews from everyone.  It's time consuming and messy, but totally worth it.  I used 3 packages of breasts and a huge package of drumsticks so I doubled everything.  Also used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  I used the spices exactly as they were in the recipe.  I'll definitely make this again...someday!

This is pretty amazing. Someone said it was too messy, but for fried chicken it is typical. Very tasty. Add a little red pepper to spice it up even more.

Really Really Good!!
I didn't use the spices listed, I just threw in what happened to be in my spice cabinet at the time.
But, the method of browning the outside first then baking them is brilliant! They were soooo moist and yummy!
I did put them on a rack, but they still ended up a little soggy on the bottom, but they were so good, no one minded ;o)
Will definitely make again!

This chicken is awesome!  My kids love it along with a very picky boyfriend.  The outside had a nice crispy texture and the inside is super moist.  I did not have all the spices but I got most of them and pretty much any spices you like mixed in with the flour will do great.  This is my new fried chicken!

This was pretty easy to make and turned out much better than I expected. Very crispy & tasty breading with succulent, juicy chicken inside. I will definitely be making this again. 

With that said, I did have to cut down on the spices a bit or else they would have been too overpowering. No majoy adjustments though.

I made this last night, scaled down for two serving. My kitchen is woefully understocked, so I had no herbs. Instead I used garlic salt in place of the salt, threw in a dash of chili powder, and lot less pepper. It came out delicious, moist, juicy, and with a nice thick crispy coating. Everything I want in fried chicken, and I found it easy to make, too. I may try making a larger batch, pan-frying, then freezing to finish baking at a later time when I don't have time to prep anything for dinner.

Chicken and rice? Again? Yes, but with a twist! I was so happy I stumbled upon this recipe when I was looking for a way to jazz up these frozen chicken breasts. Very simple but loaded with flavor. The seasoning is fantastic. The breading turns out golden and crispy while the inside is juicy and moist. I've made this more than once and it's become a favorite at our dinner table. Thanks!

I pretty new to cooking and have always heard that fried chicken was tough to pull off.  Well, I thought this recipe was simple and very easy to follow.    I didnt use tarragon and I added some chili powder.  My only fuss is that it tasted too herby so I might leave out the oregano next time

I have to agree with Lisa's comment on 10/16/10. Way to much ginger, and baking time was way to long.

This is an effective way to preserve the moistness in chicken breasts. However, I eliminated the ginger and tarragon and cut down on the salt and pepper, particularly the salt, at least by half.  I find that a sheet of parchment paper under the chicken breasts prevents sticking during the baking process.  I also find that baking time of 10 to 15 minutes is quite enough as most of the cooking is done in the pan.

I have been making these for years only pounding the breasts and slicing into strips and then doing the transition into fried/baked chicken strips, patting the strips with a paper towel BEFORE baking.  They are mouth watering, delicious and very easy.

This chicken was so tender and moist plus the crust was crispy. I didn't have any ginger, tarragon, or ginger but added paprika. It was still great. The seasonings can be alternated to your taste. My husband loved this chicken and he is super picky!!! Will be our favorite chicken recipe from now on.

We really liked this recipe. Since I only had 4 chicken thighs I cut the recipe in half and it was just enough. Since they were thighs and we wanted to eat in the 30 minutes turned the oven up to 375.

Cooked as directed. I love the cooking method - the chicken came out crispy and moist. However, the spices were overwhelming. Next time I will cut the spices way back. I don't want to hide the taste of the chicken, just give it a kick.

This was great. My hubby loved it!!! I did leave out a few of the spices because I didn't have them. I also put them on a rack before putting them in the oven as others had suggested. I paired this with Noodles Romanoff also from this site.  Thanks Alesia

I loved this! It was fairly easy and really tasty, and best of all, the chicken wasn't dry after cooking. I had been craving some fried chicken and this was very satisfying! I didn't have any dry mustard, so I added 3 tbsp of regular prepared mustard (think French's) to the egg/milk mixture and it worked just fine. I also added a couple shakes of smoked paprika and cayenne to spice it up a little more, but I think it would have been just fine without it. Yum!

This recipe is a new favourite! Easy to play with the spices, and it was not soggy AT ALL - follow all the steps with flouring, and then bake on greaseproof paper you shouldn't have any worries. Just make sure the skillet is pre-heated medium high (too hot and it'll burn), and only needs a minute or so each side. Rob-tucky chicken here I come!

This was pretty good! I didn't use the ground mustard, only because I was out of it! I did use Adobo seasoning in it's place, always a good choice in almost any dish! I served this up with corn on the cob, mashed potatoes & Red Lobster boxed cheddar bay biscuits!

Excellent - the best fried chicken I've made. I made them more like thick chicken strips. I think you could do any seasoning you wanted - the tricks are the double flour dipping, resting the chicken & one I've never done before, dredge one more time before frying. Very good!

I made the recipe the way it was written and my way..both times it turned out moist, deliscious and no leftovers. I prefer less salt and pepper, but the beauty of this recipe is that you can use any spice combination you prefer..as long as you stick with the coating basics and elevate the chicken during baking. I always use buttermilk for coating. Great Recipe!

This was great I cut up two potatoes and put them on the pan also.  The chicken was moist and the potatoes tasted like roasted potatoe. The family loved it.

I did not have chicken breast so I used thighs. I did not have mustard powder but had all other ingredients and followed the recipe until I read reviews. After reading the reviews and some were saying chicken was bland I added about a tablespoon of Lawry's Season Salt. I was really impressed with the outcome and will definitely use this recipe again.  Thanks!!

This is a good recipe but used my own seasonings. The chicken did come out very juicy, but I did cook a little longer as to not be under cooked. We have with salad for dinner or lunch and is great as a chicken sandwich. Goes good with side dishes as well.

This recipe was easy and delicious. I reduced the salt & increased the garlic powder. I think next time I'll skip the tarragon.

This was good.  I used chicken fillets instead of chicken breast and cooked them in oil on the stove.  They never went into the oven.  I accidentally skipped the ginger but I put in almost a tablespoon of garlic.  They were good.  Will be making them again!

Soggy underside was a bit unappealing, but by flipping the chicken breasts a couple times during their baking process they were fine. Everything looked a tasted great.

Tried this for the first time tonight.   The number of ingredients scared me...but once I got everything out it was quite easy to prepare.  I scaled it down for four servings.  I should have used less pepper and less salt - we don't normally use those, so they stand out when we do.  Easy to prepare, chic was moist and not greasy.

I made this with all organic ingredients and it was an easy, delicious recipe.  The only thing we did not have was the tarragon - but it still was yummy.  The kids and dad loved it!  The chicken was moist and flavorful- would make again!  However we loved the breading so much we think we would use strips instead of breasts so it would have more of the breading!

Made these for Thanksgiving one year when my Mother waited too long to get a decent sized turkey. This was actually better than turkey. The family couldn't stop raving about how moist & tender the chicken was. What few leftovers we had, we great the next day too. A real keeper recipe!

Great! Did as others recommended and cut back on salt and pepper. Had no Tarragon so used Herb de Provence. The dried mustard was the highlight! Also, cooked on a rack but had very little grease anyway. A keeper!

The finished product of this recipe was beyond my expectations.  I didn't have the tarragon or thyme, but it didn't seem to matter.  I thought the chicken was a little heavy on the pepper, but my family loved it so I will continue to make it as the recipe indicates.  I did use a rack on top of a cookie sheet and the chicken was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  My family absolutely loved this recipe, I will be making it again (and again)!!

Excellent recipe, the chicken was so tender! I changed up the spices a little and it worked really well. I cut the pepper in half, added more garlic powder, some minced onions, and I left out the tarragon. I cooked it just like the recipe stated to, but I made it into chicken parm. Definately will make again!!

I was intrigued and decided to try. I love tarragon and ginger but after reading the reviews I was conservative on the spices. I opted for buttermilk in place of regular milk - just a southern thing. I used extra large chicken breasts so I had to bake it a bit longer. The crust was so thick until it was breaking off so after baking the recommended time, I covered it with foil (loosely) and baked for an additional 30 minutes. The crust stayed crispy and the flavor was good. I am not so sold on chicken breasts because they can be dry, not this one. Tender, juicy, flavorful!

Excellent. Didn't use tarragon (didn't have it on hand), reduced the salt and pepper amounts, and per the other reviewers I placed the chicken on a rack over a cookie sheet lined in foil to avoid a mushy underside. Super moist inside with a crunchy exterior.

My husband and I loved it!  I used smaller pieces of chicken, instead of using half a breast.  I cut each chicken breast into about 8 pieces.  This cut down on the time in the oven to 10 min.  Great recipe!

Overall, it was a great recipe.  I didn't need nearly as much flour as the recipe called for and wish I had added more spices.  The outside of the chicken was nice and crisp and the inside was so tender!  Definitely going to make it again!

It was actually pretty easy to make and  I had every thing on hand (a first!). The only thing was that it got soggy on the bottom when it was baked. I didn't have a problem with the amount of oil- 1/2 a cup was plenty for me.  Will definitely make this again!

This was an excellent recipe. Easy to follow (had to make 14) and my family just loved it. I omitted the dried tarragon since I didn't have any. After reading the reviews, I cut back on black pepper and omitted salt. I in turn did use racks in my pans so the chicken wouldn't get soggy. They still weren't all that crispy. The breading still flaked off the chicken. In my opinion it was still a bit spicy for me and my stomach but I had raves from my family. It looks like I will definitely be making this again in the future.

I omitted the ginger and added onion powder. Not a ginger fan. I used about half the salt and pepper as well and baked it on a rack. It was delicious. Moist inside and crispy on the outside. If you're tired of blah boneless breasts, I recommend this recipe.

This was very good. I did nott  have any problems with the breading staying on the chicken. I did not use the ginger because I just don't see how that flavor would be good in this recipe. When I put the chicken in the oven I used a broiler pan. The breading wasn't super crunchy, but it wasn't mushy either. Will definitely make this again as the chicken was super tender.

Unbelievably delicious. Best chicken dish I've ever made. I made it two weeks ago and then again last night due to popular demand. Followed the recipe to the letter both times, the only changes I would make in the future is to put a rack on the baking sheet so the bottom doesn't get as soggy, and to use a bit more oil than called for as 1/2 C is not enough. Make this, you will not be sorry!

I made these last night for the first time and really enjoyed the flavor and the fact that they were so moist.  I did omit the tarragon and the ginger and added some cayenne pepper based on personal preference. Baking the chicken on a rack keeps the bottom of the chicken breasts nice and crispy! I used avocado oil to brown the chicken breasts since it can withstand high temperature cooking. This recipe satisfied my cravings for fried chicken! I'll be making it again soon!

The flavor of this chicken was very good.  I did cut the salt and pepper in half as other posters suggested.  It didn't crisp up as I thought it would.  I did put it in the oven on a wire rack but it didn't crisp.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated (except cutting the salt and pepper).  We will definitely have this again.  Thank you for posting the recipe.

This was delicious! I didn't have any terragon so I used rosemary as a substitute. I would use a bit less salt next time. I also patted the chicken breasts with paper towels after frying them, which seemed to control any possible issues with being soggy.

the egg and milk wasn't enough for 6 chicken breasts I made, your recipe calls  for 8 chicken breasts. how there was enough batter for 8 chicken breasts I wonder? It was a good recipe considering the other ingredients.

This was a truly great recipe!  I used only 1 tbsp. each salt and pepper.  Additionally, I did not have tarragon or thyme so I did not use them - I will the next time just to see how it turns out, but my family loved it without!

Very good and moist. We didn't want Italian flavors tonight so I used just the tarragon, salt, pepper, garlic and ginger to season the flour. I also cut the recipe to 2 servings. The breading stayed on and was crisp!! We will definitely do this recipe again!

The seasoning ratios are all awry. Just season to taste. I did italian-based seasonings, like oregano, pepper, andthyme, with an italian dressing marinade, and it turned out very well.

My son is the real test for any recipe.  He really liked this chicken.  It gives you the fried chicken taste and texture without the greasy feeling!  I didn't have all of the ingredients so had to improvise with some of the herbs.  Used poultry seasoning and Italian seasoning.  Kept the ginger & garlic.  Very delicious and easy!  So glad that I found this recipe!

Let me start out with what worked.  It was very easy to make, the chicken was moist and there was a great deal of breading that built up on the outside. I cut the recipe in half and was able to get 5 good sized chicken breasts out of it.  My husband loved it.  

What didn't work was that the breading did get soggy on the bottom while baking.  Wish I had read where someone suggested cooking it on a rack...that would have worked great.  I wasn't overly fond of the spices but that is more personal taste.  

I will try this again but change up the spices.  All in all it was a success!

This was an awesome recipe.   My husband absolutely loved it.  I did cut the ginger in half and that was perfect.  My husband who doesn't like ginger couldn't taste it.   Definitely will make this again and again.

Fantastic flavor in my opinion, I put half of my breasts in the oven on a rake like suggested and the other half I continued to cook in the pan because they were rather thin.  Try it you'll like it.  I put 4 stars only because I didn't use/have tarragon..whatever that is.

I thought the chicken came out great not excellent.  It had excellent flavor (I adjusted the spices to my own taste, excluding the ginger) and wonderful juicyness, but the skin lost its crispyness while in the oven.  I'm not sure what to adjust next time to keep the breading more crispy!  Overall a fine four star recipe, my husband really enjoyed it!! Thank you so much for posting!

Tried this last night scaled down for one serving. Only used the basic premise- flour, salt, pepper, oregano & garlic for the breading and then egg & milk for the batter. Browned in oil in skillet then in to oven for 25 minutes. The chicken was cooked and was reportedly tender and tasty, but no rave reviews. It was definitely an easy way to serve a chicken breast, but I prefer to receive more glowing compliments. :-)

I was a little skeptical about the amount of ginger and pepper, decided to stick with the recipe and didn't have any problems with it. I used this recipe to make pimento sandwiches with onion bread and it was one of the best things I've ever cooked.

This was good. Yes, you do need to use a baking/cooling rack if you don’t want the dreaded soggy bottom. I did use half the salt and pepper the recipe called for. Also, I side with those saying the ginger was just way too much. Will make it again cutting way back on the ginger (possibly leaving it out altogether or substituting something else such some cayenne or smoked paprika).

This recipe was fantastic! The flavor was incredible! I cut the chicken up into nugget sized pieces and mixed up the spices a bit based on what I had available (add paprika!). I wish I'd read the review that advised to cook on slotted pan, because mine did turn out a bit soggy so I increased the temp to 400 and let them cool on a baking rack and it helped a lot. I will ?? make this again

Great recipe! I exchanged evaporated milk for the eggs. I’ll experiment with the spices as I continue to make this recipe in the future.

Wow, I loved it! I kept with the recipe except for the salt and pepper. I adjusted the Tbsps I did tsps. I too also put the chicken on a broiler pan and it worked well.

Really was quite juicy, and the spices in the crust can easily be adjusted to match your tastes. Hint: be sure the frying pan is hot before you start front, otherwise you get a bit of a mushy outside, not a nice crust.

Both hubby & adult son loved this recipe.  Personally, I think I will cut the thyme in half, but that was my personal preference.  I almost missed the 3rd coating of flour, which was unexpected.....but definitely added the extra crispy to the chicken.  Easy & simple recipe....will definitely make again (and again).

This is very easy, just the dreding & egg wash takes some time... I didn't have tarragon, so I used italian seasoning, but I had all the other spices & adjusted the recipe for ''TWO'' people..Once you fry it for about 5-10 min, it looks like it's fried with a crunchy crust.  Then into the oven for 30 min since I had 1 HUGE breast (over a pound) that feeds my husband & me.. Will update once we eat it, but so far it looks yummy,..My husband is the ''guinea pig'' for all my cooking, so far he likes it all!

EXCELLENT! I just made this tonight and we loved it! I didn't have all of the right seasonings, but it was good. I put it on a cooking rack for the oven, but the bottom turned out soggy, going to turn them over 1/2 way thru next time.

My chicken breasts were on point. I used to cringe when I thought about boneless skinless breasts I would buy on sale at the grocery store. That’s because it’s so difficult to cook them without them drying out and getting tough. Until now: This recipe yielded moist, tender breasts with a delicious coating. I served them with fresh mashed potatoes and chicken gravy from a mix. Based on the reviews, I left out the ginger and cut back on the salt and pepper a little. I fried the chicken in a cast-iron skillet and placed the breasts on a cooling rack on a cookie sheet when I moved them to the oven. I’ll be making this again.

So good! I had no tarragon, so I subbed in Herbs de Provence, which is mostly tarragon. I reduced the ginger, salt and pepper, based on other reviews -- I'll definitely use the actual amounts next time. I halved the recipe because there are only three of us. If I'd known it would be so good I'd have made more to have leftovers.

My boys and I enjoyed it! The chicken was nice and juicy!  My husband thought the ginger was overpowering (the boys and I didn't notice) so next time I make it I will either significantly decrease the ginger or leave it out altogether.

I halfed the salt and ginger as others suggested. I added a tube of crushed saltines to the flour. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. It was awesome. Went excellent with gravy and mashed potatoes. I love pepper so I left that alone, but if you are not a pepper fan reduce the pepper as it is a bit strong.

This recipes was not a good mix for our family. We LOVE seasonings. I'm not afraid to add some serious kick to a dish. I read the seasonings 3 times before mixing them together. The black pepper was so overpowering. I could only taste it and the thyme. Maybe I'll try it again in the future and half all the spices. But I am genuinely confused by all the good ratings on this one. Disappointing.

Very yummy, moist inside, crisp outside.  Dipped in buttermilk then flour mixed with Panko bread crumbs and only used Seasoned Salt with California garlic sprinkle. Try using a butter and oil mix to fry in for the best flavor.

I am a vegetarian, so whenever I cook meat for my omnivorous husband and son, I am not sure what will be a hit. This recipe got HUGE compliments! I really reduced the spices as my son is wildly spice-adverse, and he loved it. I used the slotted rack as suggested by many other reviewers and this chicken honestly came out looking and tasting like it came from a chef! Easy and highly recommended!

The flour seasoning is very good but can be modified with onion flakes, oregano and other spices if you are short on mustard powder. 
The baking should be done with a grill pan that has ridges, so the oil does not soak into the bottom of the chicken, as other reviewers have noted.

Didn't use the tarragon, only used 1/2 the pepper, substituted dry mustard for prepared...still DELICIOUS!  Next time I make it I'll flip the chicken (in the oven) half-way through cooking time so all sides are crispy.

Wonderful recipe new family favorite! I had WAY too much breading leftover though so I will probably half that next time I made the 3lbs of chicken breast as stated. I also made homemade gravy with some of this leftover but had to make another small bath with plain flour as the breading was too salty for gravy but in the end came out great! Also breaded some squash slices and fried them up they were fabulous. Only recommendation I have is to half the amount of breading.

Made this tonight to go with some fettuccini alla carbonara. We all loved it!  The chicken was golden and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Per some of the reviews I reduced the salt and pepper amounts by half, next time I will use the full amount. I  recommend doubling the egg/milk mixture as I did not have enough. I also turned the chicken half way through the baking time to help make it crispy. We will be making this a part of our recipe rotation.

It was not very impressive.  Definitely not a “pan fried” chicken. Soggy on the bottom, tough on the top.

Taste was great and chicken was moist. I did use a rack to put the chicken on to bake like other reviewers mentioned. I didn't have any ginger but that didn't seem to make a difference.

Made it for me and my family, my first time cooking a real meal - ive baked alot of sweets before - and they liked it. Too bready for me since i used thinner chicken breasts but it was pretty decent! : D
Made it with chicken strips thicker chicken is better.
Dont egg it first, dip, then egg, then dip again. Also too much ginger.

I just used the recipe for my family tonight and it was great.  So did I do anything different, yes.  I brined my chicken for a few hours, however, I do that all the time with my chicken.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I cut the amount of salt, pepper and ginger in half.   I didn't' have tarragon so I substituted basil in equal measure.  After reading some reviews I added an extra cup of flour, I don't think I needed to but the spices didn't taste as if they overwhelmed the chicken. I then fried it in a cast iron skillet until brown and placed in oven for 15 minutes while I finished the sides.  My family went crazy for this.  I used some of the oil and some of the flour mixture to make gravy, it was outstanding.  I will only use this one going forward.

You can get the same results without baking.  Pan fry like the recipe states, but the last 10 minutes or so put a lid on your skillet and turn down burner to low. You get tender, moist chicken plus you still have the crispness. Also I did not use  ginger.

This chicken was so delicious, my toddlers loved it. I didn't have tarragon and switched it with rosemary but was great in flavor and super crispy. Will definitely make it again, next time Ill try it with tarragon.

I made some adjustments to the recipe because I made 6 thighs and 10 legs. I used a lot of flour (about 3-4 cups)which may have diluted the spices a bit though. I think about 2 teaspoons instead of a full tablespoon for each spice? I also decided to dip mine in breadcrumbs as well. First, dip in egg mixture, then flour, then back to egg mixture, then breadcrumbs. I used planko breadcrumbs for about 4-5 of them and the rest I used Italian breadcrumbs. My girlfriend and I loved them. I would suggest baking for a full 30-35 minutes like I did to get the most oil and grease out of them while keeping the tenderness.

I cut the ginger in half and used a half a teaspoon pepper. Other than needing just a little more pepper, and not being crisp enough, it was perfectly tender and delicious.

The seasonings were adjusted to our taste preferences. The breading tip helps to get a consistent and even coating.

My family grubbed this chicken recipe.  I will be making it again.  Thank you for sharing.  I will recommend putting a cooling rack on the baking sheet then put  the chicken on that and put it in the oven.  The whole breast stays crunchy that way.

This is a family favorite. The chicken is very tender and tasty. I use seasoning that my family likes for the flour. After I dip the chicken in the flour mixture and egg, I dip it in an Italian Style Panko mix. Then I make it as posted. Great recipe!

Will make it again and again, it's the method I wanted, more than the seasoning mix (for my family taste buds).  I had my own flour mix.  

Used egg/milk mix, and the two egg wash dips, and rested for 10 min.  That's part of the key to tenderness.  One last dusting of flour mix, fried, and baked on a cooling rack atop a cookie sheet covered with crumpled foil.

TOO MUCH SALT! You can cut it at least in half, to 1 tablespoon. Otherwise,  it has a lot of flavors, if you don't mind the complexity, and always comes out tasty and tender with a crispy coating.

I halved the recipe and seasoned it with seasoned salt, thyme and ground mustard.  Used twice as much thyme and mustard because I'm a dumb dumb, but it still came out great!

Great spice mixture, although I used about half of each except for the salt and garlic powder.  Tender, juicy, flavorful...and I baked the chicken on a crinkled up piece of foil in a jelly roll pan -- came out nice and crispy without the greasy bottom. I'll definitely make it again.

Family loved it and it was pretty easy to make. I cut the salt in half, which seemed about right to us. Also I happened to be out of ground ginger, so we skipped that (apparently controversial) part of the recipe.

I made a half batch of chicken and a full dredge still needed more dredge. The whole family likes this recipe.

I found the recipe to be way too salty but the chicken was moist.  I love the rest of the spices.

This was a fabulous recipe! I used chicken tenders instead of breasts. I didn't have Tarragon, but used all other spices listed. I did use 3 cups of flour to balance out the pepper. I used a broiler pan, flipped the chicken at 7 minutes and baked for an additional 9 on the other side. It turned out juicy, crispy and very tasty. The family absolutely loved this recipe! Thank you for sharing it

I will definitely make this again HOWEVER I will do a few tweaks. Way way wayyyy too much pepper. However my dad and brother smother everything with pepper and they absolutely loved this. As for my sister, mom, and I; all we tasted was pepper. So I'd say a teaspoon of pepper instead. Also I took a different commenter's advice and only added a teaspoon of ginger and that was a good idea! I couldn't imagine adding more than a teaspoon. I fried this with a whole cup of vegetable oil and that was the perfect amount. Besides that though this was very easy and I had everything to make this already so I didn't have to go to the store! I cut my chicken up into nugget sizes then followed the instructions and with my nuggets I made some penne and sauce and mixed it all up and sprinkled mozzarella on top!

The way I made it was great:  tender, juicy, flavorful.  I followed the recipe ingredients but only pan fried it (no oven).  I used my cast iron skillet with grapeseed oil, and that's all I needed to do.  This is an easy dinner to make when you have no idea what you want!  Thanks for filling us up tonight!

No complaints.  Will be in the rotation! Made it with Kentucky Kernel so cut down a tad on spices. So glad it's as yummy as it looks!

I followed the other reviewers and lessened the salt and pepper other than that kept everything the same. Oh and put it on an baking sheet with a wire rack attached and it was nice juicy and crispy. The only thing is that I tasted the Thyme spice more than any other spice. My family still liked it a lot!

I had 3 chicken tenderloins which I flattened slightly.  I adjusted quantities to accommodate half the recipe size.  Hubby is gluten intolerant, so I used Betty Crocker rice flour blend.  Any time he thinks he's eating deep fried, it's a winner.  This was excellent.  I baked it for 20 minutes on a broiler pan and it turned out crispy on both sides.  Next time will reduce tarragon and thyme a bit for personal taste.  Thanks for this easy fried chicken recipe!  :)

I am going to give this 5 stars even though I didn't prepare it the way I read the recipe. Reason being the chicken came out nice and crunchy on the outside and nice and moist on the inside. The seasonings I like to used in the flour mixture was black pepper, salt, garlic powder, Cajun and I also added some grated parm cheese. Then I fried and baked. I didn't use foil because I wanted to let the juices drip off the chicken, Best to use something to catch the grease so your chicken stays crunchy. I also turned my chicken twice, but I let mine cook for 25 minutes. I hope this review helps someone out. HAPPY COOKING EVERYONE :)

I reduced and/or eliminated some of the spices and baked on a slotted pan in the oven to reduce sogginess—as was recommended by other reviewers. The chicken came out great—tender and juicy on the inside with a crisp outer shell. I will definitely be making this again.

After reading earlier comments, I eliminated the tarragon, thyme and oregano and cut back on salt and pepper. I used a rack for baking. We really enjoyed them and will prepare this again.

I tried drizzling with olive oil and just baking for an hour - turning at about the forty minute mark - and the breastst turned out sublime!  Fantastic spice mix!  Wouldn't change a thing!

Worked wonderfully!  I used a lemon marinade ahead of time, but this added texture to the boring skinless breasts, sealing everything in nicely even though I'd cut the breasts in half so they'd be roughly 24g of protein each.  Looked great, tasted great, crisp yummy on outside and fall off my plastic fork on the inside!

This was delicious! Made a couple changes as my wife is gluten intolerant and allergic to dairy! So I used gluten free flower and replaced the milk with hemp milk.

as others have said, Baking it on a slotted rack or cooling rack keeps it from getting soggy on the bottom.

I must say this is the best oven baked chicken I have ever made, ever.  The kids loved it & this is the only way I will make chicken again.  The best!
It was so moist & well, just perfect. Thanks for this recipe.

Made this according to the reicpe (except for the tarragon - that stuff is nasty) and it was so tender and delicious.  Will definitely make it again.  This is some of the most tender, juicy chicken I've ever had.  Thank you for this recipe.

Made as is, my family raved about it! Very easy recipe. I made thru frying and then wrap led in foil and saved before baking. This allowed me to visit with company and put the chicken on the oven when we were ready. Perfect! I had a couple of chicken breasts left over and they were delicious eaten cold as lunch the next day. Would be great sliced and added to salad. This will be a regular recipe at my home.

This is a really good recipe for chicken. My family really loved this recipe!I did use thin sliced chicken breast and didn't have tarragon but it still came out tender but crispy on the outside.I did follow a few suggestions from other reviewers. I used a cookie cooling wire rack and placed it on top of a jelly roll pan to cook the breasts. I cut way back on the salt, pepper and on the ginger. Although there was a variety of spices to use you can still make this recipe tasty even if you do not have all the spices on hand. Improvise on the basics and it will still come out really good!
I made this again and I did let the chicken sit for 10 minutes on wax paper. This is key so the coating won't come off. My husband really liked the way the crispy coating on the chicken breast and compared it to the same texture as Tempura .

I didn't care for this recipe. The breading was too heavy and got soggy, even though I baked it in a broiler pan. The chicken was fairly tender, but overall- not very good. I wouldn't make this again.

my husband is eating this right now and said it's very good.  I did the chicken in the frying pan with butter/oil and it didn't come out as crispy as I thought it would but tasted fine.  served with sautéed cubed potato, mushrooms, onion and mini peppers. thanks for the post.

Just finished this recipe.  I didn't change anything in the menu and the chicken was moist a very flavorable.  I served it with brussel sprouts and hollandise sauce, and a tomato on parmesan cheese with a mixture of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. 
This is a great recipe and I'll make it again.

I had only made fried chicken once before, and it was awful. I tried this recipe and it was fantastic! The chicken was juicy and tasty, and even though I didn't have all the ingredients, I thought it came out wonderfully.

This chicken recipe turned out perfect.  I made exactly as is and it was super moist chicken!  I served it up with garlic mash potatoes, brussel sprouts and gravy.  Delish!  Update:  Making it again on September 8th, 2014 and it looks to have turned out perfectly.  Such an easy recipe!  This time I'm serving it with a home-made Honey Mustard dip.  This recipe is called Yummy Honey Mustard Dip on AR site for anyone who's interested.  :-)

This recipe is fantastic.  I cooked it for my daughter's family last night.  It gives a wonderful herb crust on the chicken.  I cooked it on a slotted oven pan like other reviewers suggested and the chicken was nice and crispy.  Remember to save the flour mixture and use it a second time as the recipe suggests as this gives the chicken an extra nice coating. Thanks, Jeannette

Using my own chicken-fry breading,it should be great...but how do I add it to my recipe box? All I've been able to do is bookmark it. There is no +recipe icon to click on, like they say. I will use my cast iron chicken fryer with oil to half the size of the chicken breasts, and bake then on a rack to allow even cooking.

This was very good even without the tarragon which i didn't have, but will definitely have next time. I used chicken tenders.

Yummy. Just gave 4 stars because it was uneven looking. Smaller parts were very brown, larger not. Probably my own fault.  But it tasted good"

They were good but too gingery. Chicken breasts come so huge now days that I fillet them, either in thirds or halves. If you have the time partially freeze them as they are easier to slice. Plus it's cuts the cooking time.

Not a huge fan of it as I found the Ginger very strong and I even used less than what the recipe called for.  I will however make this again but changing the spices up, as the chicken is very moist.

I catered for a wedding party on Saturday and used this recipe minus the ginger.  I have never gotten so many compliments on how moist the chicken was.....great recipe!!

Made this for company and everyone loved it. I followed other reviews and cut ginger in half. Also, I had to give it 4 as it didn't remain as crispy as I wanted in the oven. Next time I think I'll try cutting the breasts into smaller chunks and going straight from pan fry to table!

When I flipped the chicken breast in the frying pan the breading stuck to the bottom of the pan on the second flip.  I am not sure if it was because there was a lot of breading or if I did something wrong.  Suggestions welcome.  I opted to use my own seasonings so I can comment on the original recipe as far as taste.
