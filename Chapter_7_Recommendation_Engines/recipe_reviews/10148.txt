Very good! To make this recipe even better and a little bit on the healthier side I substituted 1/2 cup of the butter for applesauce I used whole wheat flour cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and increased the amount of cinnamon to about 2 to 3 tsp. I didn't put in any orange zest because I didn't have any but I definitely will next time even though they were great without it! All-in-all...a great recipe!

Great cookies! Very soft and moist inside which I like. My changes: finely chopped carrots rather than grated and whole wheat flour rather than all-purpose. I also pressed the cookies lightly with a glass bottom before baking since they don't flatten at all on their own.

I halfed the recipe and I added vanilla because I didnt have any orange zest. I also cooked these in my toaster oven so they didnt brown on the sides but I took them out at the time said in the recipe. This is THE BEST recipe I have tried on this site! These cookies are excellent!!! and since I see people added other things to the recipe like walnuts and raisins I guess that means I can add more carrots!!!! thank you so much for this recipe. it is SUPER DUPER DELICIOUS!!!! if i ever gave any other recipe 5 stars I take one back and give this one extras. yummy yummy yummy

Flavor is very good. The dough was stiff enough to roll into balls and then flatten with a fork. They didn't spread much. Nice to have a crisper carrot cookie.

I'm on a diet right now and this recipe was exactly the recipe I was looking for. To make this recipe even more low-fat I used 1 cup I can't Believe It's Not Butter Light (which has the half the fat and calories than normal butter) and I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar because I didn't have Splenda on hand. I'm also a cookie dough fiend so out of curiosity I tried some of the dough before I added in the carrots. It was so yummy and it was nice to know I was only eating one raw egg:). Like some of the other revewiers said the cookies don't spread much when you bake them and the dough is a little bit sticky so before placing the balls on the cookie sheet I flattened them in my hands a bit. Also instead of greasing a cookie sheet or using wax paper I just stuck them on aluminum foil so when my first batch finished I simply took the foil (with the cookies still on it) out of the pan set it on the counter and let it cool while I grabbed a new sheet of foil and baked my second batch. i made this review before i baked the cookies and after they baked they were very bland. recipe needs sugar and tastes better as a dough

These are delicious! I used whole wheat flour no salt and a full teaspoon of cinnamon along with a dash of nutmeg. I also added about a cup of raisins which I had soaked in hot water. I also used 1/2cup white sugar and 1/4cup splenda brown sugar mix. I had to cook them longer about 15-18 mins but it could be my oven. Very good!

I made these cookies with the pulp leftover from juicing some carrots. I made them as an experiment to see if my kids would eat a cookie with a veggie in it. Of course I didn't tell them what the orange piecies were till they tried it. They LOVED them and I had to make more the next day. Even my 14yr old niece wanted seconds.

The orange and carrot blend is different and very tasty. I made it exactly as specified no changes and the whole family was pleased. This is a keeper; a good way to use all those CSA carrots.

Instead of 2 2/3 cups of all-purpose I put 1 2/3 cups all-purpose and 1 cup whole wheat. It was extremely dry and hard to form into dough. So I had to add about 2 tsp of vanilla. I guess because I added liquid(vanilla) it turned out really chewy. It was very yummy and not too sweet.

Be sure your oven is hot enough. First batch didn't spread so were doughy inside even when very dark on bottom. Second load into the oven (hot enough I guess) spread as expected. Delicate flavor and not too sweet -- tasty though.

This is a deliciously different cake-type cookie! After reading other reviews i used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce. Also 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup Splenda 2 teaspoons each orange extract and vanilla....also 3/4 cup white raisins. Otherwise followed the recipe. Flattened slightly. When the cookies were cool I glazed with 1 cup powdered sugar 1 teaspoon grated orange rind 1 teaspoon orange extract and enough orange juice to reached desired consistency. So good with a cup of coffee. I had to pack them up and put them away because they kept calling to me! They are a welcome change from chocolate chip cookies. This is a keeper!!

I was so bummed with how these turned out! Very bland even after adding extra cinnamon and some vanilla along with nuts and raisins! So less than mediocre that I was too embarassed to even let anyone taste them! I couldn't even get my young daugter to eat these:(

Mine were fat free because I used half fat-free plain yogurt and half prune puree for the fat (you actually scale the prune puree to half of the fat replaced too). I used whole wheat flour underfilled my sugar used flax instead of egg and added 2 tsp of cinnamon and a few shakes of both nutmeg and ginger. I didn't measure my carrots but I definitely used more than directed and they still turned out great! Also didn't have orange zest so I used vanilla. Great fluffy cookies. A little bland but in my opinion the point of carrot cookies isn't to have an insulin explosion:)

I had huge problems with this recipe. My first cookie-sheet full flattened out like pancakes. So I added a bunch more flour and tried again. Apparently I got too much flour cause they didn't flatten out as much as a cookie ought to and they burned. At that point I cut my losses and ate the dough. All of it was very tasty. I live close to sea level... maybe this recipe is more suited for mountain dwellers.

This recipe was a nice use for leftover carrots... The cookies were good on the first day but they were not as good on day 2. Definitely make them the day you plan to eat them!

Overall pretty good. Actually better than I was expecting but still not perfect. I used lemon instead of orange but they are still pretty bland. There is also a lot of butter and sugar in this recipe so its not the healthiest.

I used this recipe for the letter "C" week in my preschool class. The kids loved them. The only thing I added was a cup of raisins. I will make them at home for my Grandson.

I decided to give a try to this recipe just to have something out of the ordinary cookies I bake. It was the easiest thing it took me just few minutes to make the cookie dough and also very simple to bake them I just made little adjustments: I used brown sugar instead white sugar added 1 tsp of vanilla and few raisins (I think carrots and raisins are a perfect combination) I also increased the baking time to 20 min and all I can say is: they came out amazingly delicious I love the hint of orange taste; definitely this is a must keep recipe in my repertoire.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and it was a big hit at work. The cookies were moist and cakey with a good flavor. The spread a bit in the oven but were not flat at all. Good recipe I will most likely make it again.

These are delicious! No too sweet and pleasantly soft. I used carrot pulp from the juicer increased the salt to 1/2 T added 1t vanilla subbed in 1 c whole wheat flour and grated in some fresh nutmeg. Using a cookie scooper the cookies held their shape as beautiful little domes (baked 12 minutes). I tried a tray with flattened cookies and decreased the bake time to 10 minutes. Just for fun I squeezed some of the orange juice into a bowl and whisked in powered sugar to drizzle over the top. Fantastic!

This cookie and any other will always turn out better if you bake them on parchment paper-lined cookie sheets. Cardamon vanilla extract and replacing half of the butter with Crisco shortening ups the flavor a notch or two and cuts back on the saturated fat content in this recipe. I also added 1 cup of golden raisins.

I only had whole wheat flour and orange extract so I tried those in place of the white flour and orange zest. I increased the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon added a dash of nutmeg and a scant cup finely chopped pecans. The cookies are good not too sweet. Texture is buttery and moist but dense like a shortbread. Good with hot tea. Didn't get the carrot flavor you would taste in carrot cake.
