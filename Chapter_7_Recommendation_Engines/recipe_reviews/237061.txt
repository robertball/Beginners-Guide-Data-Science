Wow! I was not sure about this dish at first but after watching the video I thought I would give it a try. I am really glad I did.  Hubby loved it, told me don't lose this recipe. I would never have thought to fry pastrami.It turned into delicious,crispy little bits that tasted amazing with the tangy dressing. Shaving the asparagus was a bit difficult. I don't have a V-shaped peeler and kept hitting my knuckles on the counter and I couldn't get the last strips thin enough. I finally held the asparagus close to the edge of the counter and solved the problem. It was definitely worth the effort. Thanks for another great recipe Chef John.

I made the recipe exactly according to the directions and the video.  It came out perfectly.  I had never eaten asparagus raw before.  The dressing tenderizes the asparagus just right.  My husband usually catagorically refuses to eat anything with mustard in it so I didn't tell him about the mustard until AFTER he had eated the dressed asparagus and he had repeatedly said he liked it.  We will be having this again!  Thanks Chef John!

I loved it. Being a vegan, I did have to change the meat. Instead of the pastrami I used the bacon chips (a teaspoon or two, just to flavor the dressing is all I needed)you buy in the salad toppings area. I am not a fan of oil so I dropped it to 1 Tbsp. Next time I may cut the oil out altogether (don't hold me to this, when I make a vinegar and oil dressing I use 1 oil to 3 vinegars.) I couldn't wait to taste but when you do wait that couple of minutes the wilted asparaus allows you to enjoy more. Thank you John for this fabulous way to eat raw asparagus. Nutrition wise this packs a heck of a wallop!

Wow...Quite elegant: DELICIOUS, and VERY easy.  I didn't have pastrami so I cooked sliced proscutto instead and it was awesome.  The contrast of the crispy fried meat with the fresh raw vegetable is a real taste treat.  I added some shaved Parm & onion powder, and served with a nice slice of melon.  What an easy way to impress guests.  

Next time I think I will add maybe 1.5 - 2 tablespoons of finely chopped onion to the meat the last minute of cooking (just to wilt), but that is a personal preference.  Can't wait to make it again (I honestly ate the entire 4 servings myself as a lunch), but be sure to use fresh asparagus.  Both Costco & Sam's Club package their fresh asparagus really well & it is always so much better than the supermarkets that just put it out unwrapped, with a rubber band around it.

Don't be hesitant to try this out. My husband hates undercooked veggies so I knew I was venturing out there when I set this on the dinner table.  He and our guest loved it, as did I. I followed the recipe spot on. It took me a few asparagus to get the groove of peeling them but once I hit a rhythmic method it was easy. I've saved the stalks to try asparagus soup as chef john mentioned.

This was SO GOOD!  I wasn't sure of what to expect from a pickled cold asparagus salad, but it was fantastic and I am definitely going to be making often.  My husband loved it and went back for seconds.  I used bacon instead of pastrami.  YUM!!!

Got a thumbs up to do again!! I did have to substitute apple cider vinegar for the rice vinegar and left off the pastrami because we were having BBQ ribs, but it was still awesome.

Not a winner for us.  I watched the video and followed the recipe almost exactly. I was out of rice wine vinegar, so I substituted with Sherry vinegar. both add a sweetness. But we thought the result was just passable.  Palatable but nothing to rave about. No desire to try it again. I do like other recipes by Chef Dave. This one just didn't resonate with us.

I made this salad according to the recipe. It's pretty simple to prepare and it turned out as promised. However, I discovered that I don't really care for raw asparagus even when it is softened by a dressing. Just not my taste.
