This was a very user friendly recipe! I only had one jar of Dickinson's Lemon curd so I adjusted the recipe by dividing by half accordingly and used an 8x8 glass pan. Added a little extra coconut and freshly ground almonds. Just perfect! No need to add powdered sugar...beautiful on its own.

This recipe is very easy to make and absolutely addicting to eat!!! I never liked lemon bars because they always seem too sour for my liking. These came out just perfect sweet, lemony and slightly tart. Will definitely make again.

Will definitely make many more times.  I've been searching for a long time for "my" perfect, easy lemon bar recipe and this is it!  The crust is buttery and held together well, this was my first experience using lemon curd, perfect.
I followed the directions/ingredients for the basic bar; because I wanted a plain lemon bar I did not add the almonds and coconut and didn't feel the need to sprinkle with powdered  sugar.

Great recipe. I made 1/2 the recipe as I only had 1 jar of lemon curd. I omitted the almonds and used a 9x9. Will make again.

These are delicious! I was a bit worried at first because it made more of a dough than "course crumbs" as the recipe said. But it worked just fine. I was planning on sharing them but now I'm not so sure. ;)

I made these to use up a jar of lemon curd I had in my pantry. They were good. We liked the coconut and almond topping. My family ate the whole pan over several nights. But when compared to lemon bars made from scratch they just don’t measure up.

I've made this  with my homemade Lemon Curd.  I don't like canned Lemon curd.   Took a pan down to the Senior center for lunch and brought the pan back home empty.  Will make again.

Super yummy flavor but I think there was too much lemon curd. It was very gooey to cut so I think next time I would cut the curd in half.

I made no changes except I used homemade lemon curd. These bars were delicious! Really good shortbread/buttery flavor crust, smooth tart-sweet center, and tasty crunchy topping. They cut well and held together well. I’m freezing some to see if they freeze well.

These were very good and easy to make. I used Dickenson's lemon curd and cut the recipe in half for an 8X8 pan. Next time I'll cut it in half with a 9X9 pan and I might use the whole jar of curd to give it a little more lemon flavor. These bars were a big hit with family and friends. Thanks

This is a fantastic recipe!  I used my own lime curd, and they’re delicious!  I’ve made it twice in the last 2 days, the first time I kept back too much of the crust mixture for the topping, but the 2nd batch was perfect!

I made as directed, but used my own homemade lemon curd. My company loved them, as did my family. I will make them again.

Wow - special and beautiful. Easy and fast. I divided the recipe in half and it was perfect for an 8x8 pan. I used Trader Joe’s lemon curd, and it was tangy and didn’t have that yolky taste some store bought lemon curds have. The coconut doesn’t add flavor but it adds a delightful chewiness. Thanks for the recipe !

I've made these lemon bars several times but the last couple of time the crust seems to be too loose on top and too hard on the bottom.  Not sure if it's the mixing...so be careful and hand blend the dry ingredients after creaming the sugar and butter.  Otherwise they're yummy!

I didn't put in the coconut or almond as I am allergic, but everyone raved over these bars! I've made them over and over for family.

These are good.  I just prefer them made with fresh lemon juice from an actual lemon ;-)  But, since I had a big jar of lemon curd, I used this recipe, it goes together quickly.

Such a tasty treat - like other reviewers I cut the recipe in half since I only had one jar of lemon curd. The coconut and almonds give the topping great taste and texture.

Well, the taste was delicious! However, mine did not stay together like nice square bars, I'm thinking I didn't use  3/4 of the crumbly mixture pressed to the bottom of my pan; it was hard for me to tell how much 3/4 was. I wanted to make sure I had enough of the crumbly mixture to cover the top? Consequently, maybe I had too much for the topping thus, mine was all crumbly? If anyone has any suggestions as to what I may have done wrong; ( other than this measurement snafu) I followed everything to a tee! Please I'm open to suggestions because, as I stated, it still tasted scrumptious! I would love to try it another time....I'm not a beginner either, I usually have very good luck following the recipes? Do you press the top crumbs like as in the crust? It's worth  5 stars and more.

These are incredibly good.  Just a twist makes a new type of bar.  I was not able to find Lemon Curd so I use a prepared lemon filling which worked great
