I LOVE making and eating cookies and these were suprisingly good.  Although I did use butter instead of margarine (that could be why people are getting flat cookies-I don't like using margarine-plus why skimp when it's a cookie) and I ALWAYS need a squirt or two of vanilla in any of my cookies.  These had a nice and different crunch with the cornflake ingredient and they were very yummy!  Will def make again.  I also made half the recipe and that was plenty of cookies.

These were REALLY good!  I usually won't rate a recipe that I've changed but the only thing I did different with these cookies was that I used real butter instead of margarine and I used 2 cups of chocolate chips instead of 3.  My kids and hubby LOVED these cookies.  I also refrigerated the dough for 2 hours and that helped them from being so flat.  I loved that they were so chewy.

i was disappointed in the chewiness everyone mentioned.  i thought these came out dry.  the chewiness must just be from the cereals and coconut vs the moisture retention.  i cut the recipe in half and it filled my mixing bowl, so if you do the full recipe, you will need a huge bowl and strength to mix all the ingredients.  you can't really use a power mixer when adding the final ingredients: cereals, chips and coconut.

The cookies are great...crispy and chewy.  But the recipe is very large.  You will need a very powerful mixer too.

WOW! Now this is an awesome cookie! I was looking for a recipe for Cowboy cookies and this one had the same ingredients, so I used it. I added raisins and walnuts and they were so good. These cookies did not flatten when cool. Just the right texture a little crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. I had to bake them longer, about 15 minutes was perfect but I made them pretty big. The batch was so big I couldn't fit it all in the mixer (Kitchen Aid), so I mixed the rest of the ingredients with my hands. I am going to try different variations. Like butterscotch chips and walnuts, no raisins. I am sure these will be in my cookie jar for years to come! Thank you.

Really yummy warm!  I used Splenda in place of the sugars & cut the recipe in half.  Splenda in cookies doesn't flatten so I had to flatten them before baking.

I can cook, but a baker I am not..UNTIL TODAY!!! This recipe is wonderful. The corn flakes scared me a little, but in the end I like it. I followed the recipe to the letter and they are perfect. These are fantastic cookies. I did need to bake them about 14 minutes.

This is officialy our family's favorite cookie. I get bored with the typical chocolate chip cookies and these are a great change. I always make them with butter instead of margarine. They are also very good replacing the chocolate chips for dried cranberries. They make lots so do small batches or use a strong mixer.

This is the same recipe my grandma used, it was word for word what was in her book in her handwriting.  She said they were called dishpancookies because the recipe makes so many cookies that you have to mix it in a dishpan.  This cookie is crisp if you cook it longer, hers were always dry and crisp--I don't like chewy underbaked cookies so these are perfect.  I use butter and butterscotch chips when I make them--the best!

When they are fresh out of the oven and still warm, the cornflakes have an odd texture.   But the next day, or several hours. later, these are great!   Very sweet and rich if this is what you are wanting.

I subbed butter for margarine and, as I almost always do when making cookies, I used King Arthur organic whole wheat white flour.  I gently folded in the cornflakes after everything else had been added so that they would not get too crushed.  I felt that they were missing something and only ok.  I think some vanilla or almond extract might have given them the flavor oomph I was looking for.  I am giving them five stars however because my husband loved them.  He took them to a meeting at work and called to say that everyone raved about the cookies. Later in the day I got an email from him asking for the recipe for those who had requested it.  If that response does not a five star recipe make then I guess I do not know what does!

These cookies were great.  I used butter, since that is what I had on hand.  Also after reading the reviews and everyone saying how many cookies it made, I only made a half batch.  I would make these again, they are a nice and chewy cookie.

My recipe is just like this except that it has 2 Cups oil instead of the margarine.  This makes the dough a much different consistency and I even have to flatten the dough some.  It is healthier with oil too!  Great recipe - I make and take to football games.  Everyone wants to sit by us!

Cookie perfection! my 2 little ones ate them up! There was something really tasty about the corn flakes, and the coconut was perfect! Im a chocolate person, and even the bites without chocolate chips were great! I halfed the recipe, and then only baked half of that. 2 days later, I baked the other frozen half. YUM!

Good cookie but it's not going in my recipe box. I used butter, halved the sugar(still way too sweet)and measured the cornflakes before crushing them. The cornflakes give the cookies a texture similar to fiber granola bars.

maybe it didn't work because I cut the recipe to about a third.  The first batch was so flat they were see through and GREASY. I added flour and the second batch was better. I wish I would have used the same recipe I alwys do, this was a huge disappointment.

Like many other reviewers, I like these cookies enough keep experimenting with them to get them fluffier and healthier. For fluffier, I have found replacing the margarine and refrigerating the dough to be helpful. I also live at a high elevation so adding a Tbs. of dough enhancer helps too. For healthier, I do half whole wheat flour, cut the white sugar, and use finely milled golden flax seed as a substitute for 1/4 of the butter. I got a big 40 oz. bag of milled flax from a popular club store; the bag says you can substitute 3 Tbsp flax for 1 Tbsp. margarine or 1 Tbs. flax + 3 Tbsp. water for 1 egg.  It also tastes good just to throw in a scoop or two. The possibilities are endless with this recipe! Thanks ladies, for the fun cookie recipe.

I was a bit disappointed.  My family and I thought these cookies were too sweet and greasy.  If I make them again, I'll cut back on sugar and margarine.

These were great. However, I used 1/2 corn flakes and 1/2 rice crispies (because I was low). I also DID NOT  put coconut in them. Everyone at work loved these and they were gone quickly! Perfect chewy texture!

These are great, and the batch is huge! I like to freeze half the batch for later. They thaw quite nicely! The cereal makes them nice and crunchy too, but I make sure to crush the flakes a little. Large flakes can make these hard to eat.

OK dieters, don't hate me, but I added applesauce instead of margarine. I was looking for a recipe similar to one I lost, called "crunchy, bumpy, munchy cookies."  These were similar, and very good.  I added 1 cup raisins, 1 cup shredded raw carrots and frosted them with a fat free powdered sugar glaze. I know they sound strange, but the cereal keeps them light and the texture is varied and marvelous. Because of the very low fat they don't store well, but they never last long either.

I used butter instead of margarine, and used a melon baller to drop  onto cookie sheet, baked for about 9 minutes.  I was using a hand mixer, but once I added the corn flake, coconut, chip combo I just mixed with my hands, and my 3 yr. old helped and loved it! These cookies came out great.  They actually remind me of a recipe from when I was little in the "Feed me I'm Yours" book, I think it was called Monster cookies?  And that the recipe is not in the newest edition of that book.

I made half a batch and cut down to 1.5 sticks of margarine. That was more than sufficient. The cornflakes do add a somewhat "chewy" texture I'm not sure I like. Next time I would definitely crunch up some chex instead. And I measured the corn flakes before crunching them up. That was more than enough. I also used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup splenda brown sugar blend. They're good but like I said, def sub the corn flakes. I don't think there's any reason to use real butter. Non-hydrogenated margarine was fine.

I have made these multiple times and every time they are a hit.  I cut the recipe in half and even then end up with 4 dozen.  Original cookie size must be huge!  I also cook them for 14 minutes on stoneware.  Crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  YUM!

I made these for an event at work, they were all gone within a few hours! One co-worker (who hates coconut) congratulated me on being the only person in her life to successfully get her to eat coconut and LOVE it. Several others wanted the recipe.  This is a winner! The only changes I made were to ingredients I didn't have - I used all butter instead of margarine, wheaties instead of corn flakes, and I ran short of brown sugar (1-1/2 cups) so I made up the difference with white sugar. Still perfect!

Just made these cookies. Beware they are very hard to mix. I eventually got frustrated and finished it with my hands. I left out the corn flakes because my daughter was watching and freaked out when I measured them out. I'll sneak them in next time. Luckily my son did not see me put the oats in. I also left the coconut out. I don't really like it. It still made a ton of cookies.

My cookies tasted awesome...but they spread and flattened really bad. I figured out this was because my butter was not completely softened before I used it...I have since made another batch with very softened butter, and didn't have that problem...Also, I used Rice Krispies instead of Cornflakes. I can't stop eating these cookies!!!

Very yummy! And chewy! I followed the recipe exactly except I added vanilla and didn't have quite enough choc chips - but they still turned out wonderful! I especially like how they flatten (I'm a fan of soft flat cookies) I'll be making these again!

These are different and delicious!!!  I cut the white sugar down to 1/2 cup and they are still plenty sweet.  I also used wheaties instead of cornflakes.  Baked for 13 minutes and they are sooo yummy. Cut the recipe in half and it made 4 dozen regular size cookies. Hubby gives them two thumbs up!

I usually don't take the time to give my rating, and I will tell you that I would rarely give 5 stars, but this one was such a hit with everyone who tried them that I had to come back and give credit where credit is due.  I used half butter, half margarine to balance the taste and consistency I liked, and the end result was phenomenal!  We served them at the end of a huge gathering at our house with people of all ages and they went quickly.  The cornflakes, coconut, and oatmeal add such an interesting texture to this cookie.  Your guests are left wondering what makes this cookie so different and special.   A note for future bakers, this does make a HUGE batch.  I've always been able to get it done in my kitchen aid mixer but had to move to a large bowl for the final steps.  You'll never regret trying this recipe!

These cookies turned out fabulous. The dough is a little crumbly, so I did end up using my hands to place it on the cookie sheets. They come out of the oven soft, yet crunchy from the corn flakes. Everyone loved them. This is one superbe cookie.

I always have trouble with recipes not turning out just right.  This time, however, the recipe was exact!  I followed it exactly as planned and it came out perfectlly browned, very very tasty.  I had to make myself stay out of the dough...that was even scrumptious!  Thank you for this recipe, it makes a huge amount and its going to help me get my holiday baking done a lot more efficiently.

Super cookies! Just the right balance of chewy and crispy. I didn't have any cornflakes so I used chocolate Chex instead and they turned out great. The dough is very stiff but don't worry- the cookies will be delicious!

This is a terrific cookie recipe. I substituted real butter for margarine and I halved the recipe, ending up with about 4 dozen cookies. These soft, chewy and crunchy cookies are some of the best I have had.

Yum!  I was craving chocolate chip cookies with some texture and crunch, but didn't have any nuts to put in them.  So, I tried this recipe.  I halved it, used butter and unsweetened coconut.  I also reduced the white sugar by half and that was a good change.  The cookies would have been way too sweet for me if I had used all the sugar and sweetened coconut.  I didn't have corn flakes, so I used rice crispies and it worked fine.  I think most kinds of cereal with a neutral flavor would work.  The result was a buttery cookie with great texture.  I will definitely make these again.

I had to make these with whole-wheat flour, old-fashioned oats instead of quick oats and rice krispies instead of cornflakes.  They turned out wonderful.  I also quartered the recipe.  I used a melon baller and ended up with 45 3-inch cookies!  I can not imagine making the whole batch.  They turned out so wonderful that I will never make them any other way.

My 4 year old son helped me make these cookies.  I cut the recipe in half and had enough batter to make about 40 large cookies.  I followed the recipe with the exception of using an entire 11.5oz bag of semi sweet chocolate chips.   Turned out excellent!

I scaled this recipe down to 1/4 the original, and lemme tell you, I still got ALOT of cookies. I subbed Special K for the corn flakes, and left out the chocolate chips and coconut because I didn't have them. The batter is delicious, it's a very sweet cookie, and when baked has a butterscotch flavor. In terms of texture, my cookies were a bit flat, but thats probably due to missing ingredients, I actually enjoyed the buttery crispness. Enjoy (eat some batter).

Just like everyone else, I have to give this recipe 5 stars.  I made the recipe the same except I used real butter instead of margarine.  I found that they needed to be baked longer than 10 minutes as they were undone in the middle if not baked more like 12-14 minutes.  Mine were more brown all over, but still stayed chewy.  I would make these again without a doubt.

These cookies are really tasty, but a bit flat. I used butter instead of margarine. Next time I may try refrigerating the dough first so they won't spread so much.

Absolutely love these cookies, first time I had them a sweet lady gave them to my sister in-law  at my brothers passing.  I made them for the first time since then, I made the full batch as I am sending more than half to my grandson who is a marine somewhere in the middle of the ocean. I used real butter and only baked 7 minutes after the 8 minute batch was to crunchy.

My husband loves oatmeal cookies, and I love coconut - this is a great combination.  The cookies came out chewy but with a crunch from the cereal!  I made the full recipe & stored so much of it for future use - how handy!

I substituted Raisin Bran Crunch instead of Corn Flakes.  They turned out great.  I also added chopped walnuts on my last batch.  The coconut made them so yummy.  One of my favorite cookies!  Great for dunking in tea or coffee..

Great recipe to make with kids! There are a lot of things to add and mixing to be done, which keeps my toddler happy. And the result is delicious! A very forgiving recipe too - you can add what you like and leave out what you don't. I always add extra corn flakes for more crunch.

O M G  These are AWESOME!!  I halved the recipe and got 18 more cookies than the expected 3 doz. I did use real butter instead of margarine as I never buy that product. I did make another slight change in that I used 1/2 cup white chocolate chips, 1/2 cup butterscotch chips and 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. I will be making these again and again.

I made these cookies for Christmas 2011 and again Christmas 2012. Each time I cut the recipe in half. The last time had to make it again after I gave some away and we ate the rest. It seemed the longer we had them around, the better and crunchier they were. They are all gone now and I'm having withdrawals. they are awesome. I'm not waiting until another year to make them this time. Thanks a lot Laura and Tammy.

Fabulous recipe! My husband loves them, and while I can't eat many of them at one time for health reasons, it's not a lack of wanting to - they are delicious! Great recipe, wouldn't change a thing. Note: I did cut the recipe down to 36 cookies (3 dozen), but would absolutely make the full six dozen that the original makes another time. This one's a keeper!

These are one of my Favorite Cookies because  It's a chocolate chip cooky with lots of substance. Bakes with a perfect form-not too flat, not too thick.

Sooo good. I made these for a potluck and they were a sellout. This is a big recipe and made 60 large cookies, but looks easy to 1/2. I used butter and had a different flake cereal, but these are now my favorite chocolate chip/oatmeal type cookie. Yum Yum!

These cookies were phenomenal!  I followed the recipe exactly as is and ended up with 48 cookies.  I brought them to a picnic and at the end of the evening only 7 cookies were still left!  I was astonished.  Everyone loved them and I would definitely consider making these again.  Highly recommend.

FOLLOW THE RECIPE! It's Amazing. Very chewy (but not too chewy) cookies. I made half the recipe - came out with 25 large cookies...My scoops of cookie dough were so big I could only put 5 cookies on each 9x13 cookie sheet. Bakes for 15 min.

My husband and I loved these cookies.  They were soft and crunchy at the same time.  Will definitely make again.

These are great cookies! I listened to other comments and made a few changes but not much. I did add vanilla and used butter. I also cut the recipe in half and it filled my mixing bowl. Now I understand what everyone said about needing a strong mixer!! With making only half the recipe, I ended up with 1 1/2 dozen large cookies. They were perfect in 14-15 minutes. Thanks for the suggestions and the recipe!! I will definately be making these again!!

Great cookies. I love recipies that make ALOT of cookies because if your going to go to the effort you want to be able to freeze some and not have them gone the same day. Made 60 cookies. Use a Very big bowl!

Reading all the great reviews on this one I was expecting some delicious cookies, but unfortunately I was disappointed :( I thought they were waay too sweet, even tho I used unsweetened coconut the sugar just seemed to overpower all of the other flavors. The cookies came out very chewy (which I like) but too hard even tho I didn't over bake at all. My boyfriend liked them, but then again, he would eat sugar out of the jar if he could. Probably won't make again.

These are fantastic.  Followed the recipe to a T.  I halved the recipe and still got an ice cream pail full of cookies.  Thumbs up from my 5 and 3 year olds and the hubby!

Took these cookies to a get together and everyone loved them. I usually worry about baking having a baking soda flavor when there is nothing for it to react with but these were great. No baking soda taste.

These were good, not the best cookies ever, but I liked the difference that the cornflakes added to the texture.

I found the cookies to be a little on the sweet side, but otherwise the taste was good. The only problem I had was that some cookies were hard and others were crunchie. Not knowing how these are to be after baking, I cannot decide what went wrong. Can the one who posted this receipe let me know. I baked the cookies in a convection oven for 9 mins.

Wonderful!  So much better the next day!  I cut the recipe in half - perfect amount.  Note that you can use quick or regular (old fashioned) oats.  These are so similar to the "Oatmeal Chocolate Coconut Chewy" recipe from this site (but those don't have cornflakes) that I wanted this one to be different, so I omitted the chocolate chips.  Loved them!  Thanks for the recipe!

I wasn't sure I loved these cookies the first time I made them.  Then I put them in  the fridge overnight and cooked them the next day.  They were much better after being in the fridge.  Also I ended up cooking them longer the second day and they were better that way too.  I usually prefer my cookies soft and a little gooey but I actually prefer these cookies crunchy and golden brown all over.  I cook them for 10-12 minutes instead of 8-10.  Also the dough is amazingly good to eat.  Almost better than the cookie.

Wanted a chocolate chip recipe that was different and I LOVED these!  Didn't have any corn flakes so used Special K and they were fantastic.  Halved the recipe and it still made a lot of big yummy cookies.  Crispy on the outside - chewy on the inside.

I used about 1/4 cup less flour and added 1 extra egg because of some of the previous posts.  I also used multi-grain flakes (didnt have corn flakes). These turned out delicious!
