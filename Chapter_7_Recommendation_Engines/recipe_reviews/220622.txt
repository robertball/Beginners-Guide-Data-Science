I made with my own homemade 4 cups vegetable and 2 cups chicken broth. To make clean up easier and because my blender can't hold six cups at one time, I used my hand beaters to whip the potatoes and half the broth mixture, right in the stock pot. I did use the blender for the asparagus/onion/garlic mixture with remaining broth, then incorporated it with the potato mixture. I skipped the microwave step and just sauteed my asparagus tips in with the mushrooms. This surely had a nice asparagus flavor, and I like how the cook incorporated all parts of the asparagus, even the woody parts...part of what intrigued me to try this soup recipe. However my soup was pretty watery and we like it thicker, so I mixed a tablespoon of cornstarch in 1/4 cup of 2% milk and that thickened it up nicely and made it more creamy. My husband felt it was bland and threw in some cheese and said bacon would be great too, I tried to explain this is guilt-free. I did use Cream of Sherry for the wine. I would add more garlic/onions/potatoes if I made again, and then maybe some extra seasonings.

Very flavorful and not too rich. I substituted Fage non-fat greek yogurt for the sour cream which was great.
