I would advise turkey novices to do a bit of reading and asking questions about gravy making. The directions here could lead to disaster if a new cook got "rid of the fat" - Does that mean dumping all the drippings? How do I tell which is fat? How do I separate it? Can you imagine what will happen if the stock and flour are stirred in the pan without any direction to cook the flour and gradually add the liquid and constantly whisking. Most of us who enjoy our holiday meals consider the gravy to be one of the stars of the show. It's a shame that due to poor and thoughtless directions from Campbells Kitchen the gravy is a flop.

This recpe is not for the "roasted turkey" it is only for the gravy. A lot of details have been left out though and done as directed you're going to end up with a disaster. You need to whisk together a cup of room temperature (or cool) liquid/broth with the flour before adding it to the drippings in the pan or else you are going to end up with lumpy lumpy lumpy, did I say LUMPY? gravy. And then continue to stir/whisk constantly while it is cooking over medium-hi heat til it starts to boil, then reduce heat to med-low and simmer til thickened. As written this is a recipe for disaster! I hope this helps.

The only way to go!  If your family needs browned skin, simply put a piece of foil (large enough to cover entire pot) then put the lid on.  The reflective properties of the foil will brown your skin!

This is the way my grandmother made it, adding seasonings to her taste.  Fast, simple and delicious homemade flavor.

A little salty.  I might use sodium free stock next time.  Overall a very good and easy gravy!  I will repeat what others have said....add flour gradually!!

This was so ood. I wil definitely be doing it again next year. As I poured it into my gravy pourer, I wondered if it was thick enough, but it seemed to thicken up a little bit on it's own. Yummy!!

This is a basic tried and true turkey and pan gravy recipe. Anyone who cooks often knows that everything needs to be seasoned according to you or your families tastes. Salt and pepper are the most UNDER USED seasonings.
