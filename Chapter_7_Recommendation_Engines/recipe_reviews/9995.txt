Great recipe. There's this great Web Site that sells fresh dates from Israel. They're delicious. The site is www.holyfoodimports.com. Just in case anyone else out there loves making recipes with dates.

I thought these were amazing. I just happened to have some chopped dates around that I needed to use up. I was very happy the way these turned out! I did add 1 c. of milk chocolate chips for an extra kick. I'll be making these for Xmas gifts!

I had every ingredient available for this recipe, it wasn't to my liking. I could not taste anything passed the Cardamom. The bar was sticky thick but baked through. The instructions for the recipe were pretty simple but not being able to taste any other ingredient. I feel the cardamom could have been left out. Please note, that you need to be very liberal with the non-stick cooking spray for this recipe, brown sugar tends to stick harder then a cake when baked in a pan and you will find that a recipe like this won't come out of a pan as easy. Recommend spraying with non-stick spray and lining the bottom with parchment paper or wax paper for easy removal of the baked item.

Awesome recipe!  About as dense as a brownie, and with the dates, about 1-2 a day will suffice!

Really enjoyed this recipe. In order to make it egg free I used 1/2 cup applesauce mixed with 1/2 tsp baking powder instead of the eggs. Also added 1 tbsp melted coconut oil.

I added 1T. oil because it seemed to dry. I also sprinkled coconut on top before baking.  Divine

I couldn't wait to try this recipe. Seemed simple enough, and it was. I always taste the dough, and it seemed bland. But, I figured maybe it's one of those that taste better after it's baked. It's eww! My son even spit out the one bite he took. It just doesn't have any flavor. Good ingredients, just bad combo for our family. :-(

Great taste and easy to make. I had "Fruit Fusion Berry Power Superfuel Blend" Organic Dried Fruit from Costco to use up and it looked like this recipe could be modified for my purpose. The 2 cups I had were a little dry so I covered them with hot water. It sat as I mixed everything else; fruit and water were used since most water was absorbed by the fruit. The recipe was doubled, except the cardamom, and a 9x13 pan used, baking for 30 minutes. I don't do walnuts, so crushed sliced almonds replaced the walnuts. Hubby says this is a keeper.

This was delicious - a grown-up taste treat. Made this in a 9" pan and just cut 5 minutes off baking time. If your dates are dryish like mine were, just add boiling water for a few seconds after the dates are cut-up, drain, and add to the batter. I added a tablespoon of oil as someone suggested and oiled the pan well. I had no problems with sticking. Thank you for the recipe!

I did double the recipe and did not have cardamom, I used cloves and nutmeg instead. They were a hit !! My husband took a couple for breakfast and he said they were delicious . I had two myself with a cup of hot tea, Yum Yum.

I didn't change the recipe at all (except that I used whole wheat flour), and everything turned out really well. Wonderful flavors, filling, and not too sweet.
