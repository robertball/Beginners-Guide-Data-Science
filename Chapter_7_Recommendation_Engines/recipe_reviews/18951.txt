Really good milkshake. The next time I make it I will not use so much ice. You really don't need the ice if you are using frozen fruit. Thank you for sharing.

This has now become a favorite in our family. My kids have it every morning with breakfast. I change up the fruit to whatever I have in the fridge. Today was banana/peach. We have had banana/blueberry and banana/blackberry. All are good. Try this a little thicker (we use vanilla yogurt) and serve it with a spoon. My kids and I both LOVE this.....also added a raw egg to add some protein. Thanks

I didn't have frozen mixed berries, but I did have frozen strawberries. Perhaps this substitution was the problem. This milkshake was great consistency, but lacked the berry flavor I was looking for. I even doubled the strawberries! What I finally ended up doing to create the strong berry flavor I was looking for was to add 2T of RazzMaTazz (raspberry liqueor) and 1T of raspberry flavored syrup found in the coffee/tea section of the market. The modified result was a good strong berry flavor. The shake had excellent texture which made you think you were drinking a very rich shake without all the calories and fat. This recipe would probably be rated a 4 or 5 had I used the mixed berries it calls for. Thanks Lisa

This is so good.  I agree with others that you do not need ice if you are using frozen fruit.  I also used Splenda and would not advise using it in this recipe.  I usually put Splenda in a lot of my cooking but you could really taste it in this.  Next time I make, I will for sure use real sugar.  I used blueberries, strawberries & cherries.  Great recipe.  Thanks Lisa

No need for sugar if you replace the milk with vanilla yogurt, which I think is tastier too. (using fat free yogurt is good for we adults) Also, because the berries were already frozen I didn't even need the ice cubes. I did add a bit of water just to thin it out a tad. Good basic recipe Lisa and thanks so much!

I wasn't so impressed with this recipe.... Maybe it shouldn't be called a milkshake, because it is really more like a smoothie or julius.  I used fresh blackberries.... it was okay, but nothing extraordinary.  This is nothing like a thick, creamy milkshake you buy at McDonalds!

For not having any ice cream in it, this was pretty good. I used frozen strawberries and blueberries, and doubled the amount of them. It took quite a bit of stirring once I got everything into the blender though, since the frozen berries immediately froze the milk and made it into a VERY thick smoothie. I omitted the sugar, and sweetened individual cups with packets of Splenda, and it turned out fairly tasty. I think I'd like a little stronger berry flavor though, so I'd maybe add some sort of syrup next time.

Excellent!  I live in Denmark where they don't have quite the selection of ingredients that we do in the US so I am always on the lookout for simple recipes.  I certainly hit the jackpot here.  Thank you.

Absolutely a breeze to make.  I took the suggestion of others and made it without the ice.  It is definitely thick enough without the ice.

This was very refreshing and delicious.  I would consider this more of a smoothie rather than a milkshake.  I used a combination of frozen strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries.  I did not add the ice because I felt that the frozen berries were enough.  Everyone loved it - it is now my husband's favorite!

You don't really need the ice if the berries are frozen. And when you take out the ice, you should reduce the amount of sugar by half. The vanilla extract really gives it that milkshake flavor. But I would reduce the amount a bit to make it less intense if the ice were taken out. Overall, very good, very easy, and very quick.

This is sooo yummy! I tweaked the recipe a bit to make it more healthy.  I used half milk half vanilla yogurt, which made the smoothie more thick and eliminated the need for vanilla extract. I also added a very ripe banana, which made the smoothie very sweet so I didn't need any sugar.

Wow... did not expect much since the fat content was so low, but the consistency was fantastic considering it was so healthy.  Nice and thick.  Because milk was used instead of ice cream, it was very refreshing and thirst quenching.  I used fresh blueberries that were too tart for my kids to eat, but otherwise did not alter the recipe.  It was a great way to use up the tart blueberries.

I was specifically looking for a recipe that was cold and used blackberries. I wanted something sweet without a whole bunch of calories.

I used Equal in place of the sugar. This 
cooled me up and filled me up. Just what I needed. Reminds me of the shakes my dad used to make for us kids in the summer after we'd spent all of August picking blackberries.

This shake was great.  I didn't use ice and my shake was just as thick as fast food shakes.  I didn't have the frozen berry mix so I used 2 cups of frozen blackberries and about 8-10 frozen strawberries.  I also used 1 1/2 cups of 2% milk and 1 tsp. vanilla.  For those who didn't have enough berry flavor, I added 2 tsp. seedless raspberry jam.  Boy, did it have a fruity flavor!  I used 1/4 cup of Splenda but I don't think it was necessary.  The jam was enough sweetener.  You could use any flavor of jam or jelly.  I have seen sweetened condensed milk in other recipes in place of the milk.  This may add more texture and make it creamier, of course no sugar would be needed with this milk. The milk should be chilled so it makes a shake.  I have also seen where people use non-dairy creamer to make it creamier.  I may try one of these next time.  Thanks for the recipe base though.

We liked this recipe, but we changed it up a little.  We did 2 1/2 cups of the ice, added 2 cups of sugar free vanilla ice cream.  We did 1/3 cup of splenda instead of sugar & we increased the vanilla to 1 tsp instead of 1/2 tsp.  Also, we had fresh peaches & that is what the kids wanted was a peach milkshake, so we put in 2 freshly sliced peaches into the blender instead of frozen berries.  Although we changed it up quite a bit, it was a good recipe to go by.  We have tried others & they weren't as good!

Fantastic!  I love the vanilla addition!  My blender had some trouble with the ice cubes, but that's probably just because it's old.

We used strawberries and my kids were not crazy about it. I think we are just used to the thicker ice cream shakes.

I was hoping to like this a little more. I made 1/2 recipe and it made quite a bit. I thought it tasted more like an icy blueberry smoothie than a creamy smoothie or shake. It didn't say what type of berries to use exactly. I used an equal amount of blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries. If you are going to use raspberries strain the seeds out first. The flavor was fine, except it was not shake like and the seeds were kind of an annoyance.

Fabulous- don't need ice.  I thawed my frozen fruit 30 sec in the microwave just so they were rock hard in the blender.

The recipe was excellent as is, but as I live alone and don't feel I get enough nutrients in my meals, I changed it somewhat as follows:     Instead of the 2 cups of milk, I used 1 cup of milk and the rest a good quality yogurt. a banana sliced up and a splash of orange juice (fresh or frozen).    I used a combo of frozen blueberries, raspberries and strawberries, no ice.   A small scoop of protein powder and lastly, 1 tsp. of vanilla.   Put it all into a blender and liquefy.
Yummy!   Definitely 5 stars

Very nice smoothie for breakfast. The only thing I changed when I made it again,  I added plain yougart,  and add different frozen fruits whatever I have in the freezer, I usually put overripe bananas in the freezer and those go in too. But no ice!

I absolutely loved this recipe! I did what others suggested, as far as leaving out the ice and using frozen mixed berries and this came out absolutely GREAT! Even my fiancé is hogging his glass! I will definetly use this often. Though I wouldn't call it a milkshake, I wouldn't really call it a smoothie either... it's like.. a smoothie shake, or milk smoothie, hehe. VERY good.

Tastes great! However, it becomes like too much of a slushy if you use ice cubes as well as [frozen] berries. I say choose either fresh berries or no ice cubes. Apart from that, I would also recommend using yogurt instead of milk. Nonetheless, it was quite enjoyable!

The taste was great but next time I think I'll also leave out the ice since it made the shake way too thick! Almost too thick to even drink! I only used about 2/3 cup of ice but it really doesn't seem necessary since the berries are already frozen. I scaled the recipe down for two but I had to add more milk to get my blender to process it. Great recipe-will certainly make again without the ice.

Light, refreshing, and adjustable to any frozen berries we happen to have on hand. I left out the ice, added a banana, and it was more like a smoothie, but delicious. Thanks for the great recipe!!

I omitted the ice since I used frozen berries, adjusted the quantities for one person (except for the vanilla). It's super delicious, you don't even miss the ice cream and it's most likely because of the vanilla extract. Next time I'll do it with only strawberries because I'not a fan of the seeds.

Very good. The vanilla made it taste amazing. I didn't use ice and it turned out fine and probably better than with ice. You probably only need a tablespoon or two of sugar. It make it really sweet and you can actually feel the sugar grains between your teeth. And less sugar is healthier. More milk would be good also because it was really thick. I had troubles sucking it up through my straw. Overall it was tasty and I would make it again with some changes.

Good recipe, however I found the vanilla to be a little too strong, overwhelming the fruit taste. Maybe half a teaspoon of vanilla would be enough. Great consistancy overwise though.

Should have read the reviews saying you don't need the ice. It was way too icy. And prob too much vanilla too. This didn't taste like a delicious milkshake made with ice cream. Wouldn't make this again.

I thought I followed the recipe exactly and was surprised when I couldnt' even drink it!  Maybe I should have left out the vanilla extract?  My version looked exactly like the picture too.  Maybe I'm not much of smoothie person  :-(

This is delicious, I have made it several times. It is really good just as a snack or served with waffles or french toast. MM. I am going to try it with soy milk next.
