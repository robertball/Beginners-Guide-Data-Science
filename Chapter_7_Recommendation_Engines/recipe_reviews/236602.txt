For the most part I followed the recipe, the only thing I did different was I cooked the corned beef brisket in the slow cooker for a day and a half, but that was more for my benefit. I love the smell in my house and also it made chopping it easier, it just falls apart. I have never cooked corned beef so I never dreamed I could make corned beef hash. The recipe is simple and tasty! Huge success. And it freezes well, this makes a lot for two people to eat so we froze most of it. We just take it out and put it in the fridge the night before then pop it in the microwave. Yumm! Great Recipe!

The flavor is out of this world good, and I used baby red potatoes because I like to leave them unpeeled.  The fire roasted salsa adds a delicious but subtle Southwestern flavor, and instead of poached egg I topped the hash with more salsa and some sour cream.  I had trouble flipping the hash in pieces so I did the best I could and just cooked it until it was crisp in pieces.  Delicious!!

The only thing I changed was to use regular medium salsa. It was yummy!! I used red potatoes and left over corned beef from St. Patrick's Day. Great breakfast for dinner. I said it in another review. Chef John really is my go to!

I Wondered. What the heck is the big deal about corned beef hash?  Well, now I know. Chopped up the leftover corned beef, potatoes, carrots and onions from the crockpot corned beef dinner. Added everything in recipe except green onions. Didn't have them. The salsa gives it spice, but you can't tell it's from salsa.  Perfect. Had it for breakfast next morning with sunny side up eggs on top. Yummy!

Very Good! I had some left over roast beef that I needed to use up and went looking for a hash recipe.  My mom made it for us many years ago to use up roast beef (and probably lamb or other roasts) and I recall her grinding the cooked meat but I just chopped it up.  I used olive oil and regular onion as that was what I had.  I didn't have the proper salsa but served it with ketchup like my mom did.  Delish!!  It brought back good memories, too. Thank you for the recipe.  Next time I'll try it with the salsa.

I made this recipe without the tomato salsa and it was delicious! I think you need to use a cast iron skillet to get a good crust on your hash.

OMG!  Salsa in corned beef hash?  GENIUS!  I will never be able to eat any other.  I had leftover corned beef and potatoes from a couple of days ago.  A bunch of people on Facebook were talking about what to do with the leftovers, and someone mentioned making hash.  I have never made it from scratch, even though it is my favorite at breakfast.  If I had known it was this easy and this delicious, I would have been making it long ago!  Thank you, Chef John!

Great recipe! Delicious! So much better than the canned stuff. I learned how to make poached eggs just for this dish. First time I ever ate poached eggs. The combination was perfect.

We loved this recipe!  I did have to adjust the amount of potatoes that I put in only because the corned beef was very fatty and so I eliminate some of it leaving less corn beef.  This is very very good!  I wish it was easier for me to find corn beef!!!!

This was ok to me. A sunnyside egg dropped on top added some extra flavor it needed.

This was extremely tasty. I used white onion (I had one on hand) and garnished with a little cilantro. Worth the time making a corned beef brisket just for this.

Great winter's day evening meal.  Family inhaled.  Egg on top is right for flavor and looks.  Onions and salsa were just right kick in flavor.  Easy to make, even while watching football.

cooked all of it in bacon fat and it was absolutely delicious.   be patient you really want that good crust on the hash it adds an amazing texture.  I added a fried egg to the top and a few slices of bacon on the side for a large and amazing Brinner.   Forget that canned  this is worth the minimal work for an incredible result.

It was ok, but I still like the canned stuff better.  Oh well, it was nice to use up some of the corned beef left over.

I made this with leftover corned beef from St Patrick's Day. The salsa made it! I also added some thyme and parsley. I was short on time so didn't cook long enough to get the crust, but was still delish!

I used left over corned beef from St. Patricks Day dinner.  I admit I was a little skeptical of the salsa in this recipe but since it was Chef John I went with it.  Topped with 2 eggs sunny side up.  It turned out great!

I followed his recipe exactly and it turned out amazing!  I made too much in a too small skillet so it was hard to crisp it up but the flavor with the salsa was perfect. A great Christmas morning brunch option.

we made corned beef for St Patricks day. First time. My husband was looking forward to corned beef hash from it. This was great. I normally don't care for hash but this was very good.

I have never made hash of any kind before, and thought this was very good!  I used leftover sliced corned venison for this (no fat at all) so did not cook it before adding the potatoes, onions, etc.  the salsa added a nice touch and we had it for brunch, both hubby and I like it very much.  thanks!

Perfect corned beef hash.  I have made hash before and liked it, but the salsa was the perfect touch.  We loved this.  The key ingredient is patience. It really takes a long time to get the crust right but it is definitely is worth the time and effort.  Thanks Chef John

Excellent!!!  After my first attempt making corned beef, which was delicious, I wanted to transform the leftovers into something different and found this recipe that was unrated at the time but looked intriguing.  I watched the video and book marked it in anticipation for our weekend brunch even though I am not a fan of hash like my hubby is.  While I was preparing to make it I realized I forgot to buy the roasted tomato salsa, but I decided to make it anyway and it was absolutely scrumptious.  I am now converted to a corned beef hash lover and look forward to making it again to include the secret ingredient.  Thank you Chef John for this easy recipe!

Amazing as always!!  I always learn something interesting from Chef John’s videos. From the browning technique to where the term “hash” actually comes from.  I always wondered by it was called hash.

I made no changes.  It was exactly as we hoped it would be...the perfect, corned beef hash with NO exotic herbs or spices to take away from the flavor of the key ingredients.  The green onions were a perfect replacement for the yellow onions I'm used to having in this recipe.  PERFECT!

So I made it without the salsa and with loads more onion.  I just didn’t have the nerve to add the salsa. Does it make the hash taste salsa-ish??  Salsa is tomatoes - sure, onions - def, peppers - really??, cumin - ok, really not sure about this, and cilantro - def not for everyone.  Was it just enough that you could really taste it? Like mustard in coleslaw?  Or could you tell there was salsa in it?

Following your directions (basically),which by the way you have made easy to do so, I successfully cooked for the first time,,, but no stranger to the kitchen, corned hash. The timing of the of the poached egg was spot on. I had to be patient, I have a tendency to over sample, waiting for the hash to crisp and it's worth waiting for. I am a big fan of the way you cook. Thanks for the recipes, I can't wait to try even more.

I did corned beef 2 ways this year. Although Chef John’s recipe was excellent, my guests preferred the braised/baked corned beef. If I only made Chef John’s, I would have gave it 5 stars.

I enjoyed this recipe as well.  I made it as written.

A chef many years ago told me of another way to dress it
up a bit.  He suggested making a slurry of Brown Sugar,
Dijon and Orange Juice.  Very tasty as I recall!

I made it but the beef was very chewy...I wonder it that because I left it in pan for too long.

I have always avoided making Corned Beef Hash due to memories of my Mom using my Grandmother's meat grinder!
I knew what we would be having for dinner!
I like the fact of not using a grinder, bite size pieces instead are much better; to me anyway!
This is very good. I didn't have any salsa, but I did add some caraway seeds and a small amount of white cheddar.
Everyone enjoyed it including me!

The only thing I did different was, I used three large fresh potatoes, I dimed them along with 2/3 of a large white onion. Sauteed in olive oil until brown and crispy, and mixed everything else as follows the same as the recipe. Delish!

5 stars not even served with an egg on top.  My 9-year old boy asked for the second serving and then the 3 serving.  I did start out with cooking my own corned beef in a pressure cooker too.

I tried this with some left-over corned beef to see if my husband would eat it.  He only likes corned beef hash from a can, so he thought.  We both loved it!  I will make this from now on.

This is really good even though I had trouble getting the crust to develop.
