I've made so many incarnations of this (including a hearty vegetarian version) and they have all been a success.  I tend to add a lot of cumin and garlic, and I'll thicken it with flour if necessary.  I'd also recommend adding pinto beans and whole plum tomatoes that you mash up when you stir.  Very, very good and one of my all-time faves from AllRecipes...I made it every Sunday to take to work all week.  Thank you!

Great easy recipe!  I added some chili powder while browning the meat as well as cumin.  My store didn't have the mexican stewed tomoatoes so I bought regular stewed tomatoes and diced tomatoes with zesty jalapeno in them, also added more cumin to the crockpot and a chopped onion.  Boyfriend said it was probably the best chili he has ever had!!  Definitely making it again, thank you!

Loved the recipe though my family likes a lot of cumin so added one+ tablespoon per batch but skipped the salt.  I tripled the recipe, cut down on the meat and added various colors of beans.  I like to make a lot and freeze for future meals.  Also made a great topping for Taco Salad!!  Plan to also try as a filling for burritos.

I tried this recipe and it was a big hit with the man of the house. He loves his chili over rice and I grew up using Ritz crackers in mine. I didn't use the corn or chilis. I used Rotel tomatoes instead. Since making it the first time I have made it numerous times, but added my own touches. I still use the Rotel tomatoes, but have also added a 6 oz. can of tomato paste. I also use black beans instead of kidney beans. This chili has the perfect amount of heat. My children, who do not like chili, will not eat this, but that means it's just more for the adults.

I have not yet eatten the chili as it still has a few hours to Cook, but I stired it a few times and couldn't resist tasting it.  I did adjust a few items. I used (1) 28oz can petite diced tomatos Only had (1) can stewed tomatos and add (2) medium sized onions and (2) celery stalks diced and (4) cloves garlic minced along with the green pepper and can chilies.
And chili powder added (1) additional tsp chili powder and a squirt of Sriracha HOT chili sauce. OMG it tastes so awesome I maynot be able to hold off for another 3 1/2 hours. Thanks for a great chili recipe.

It smelled good, but I was a little disappointed.  I felt that there was something missing. I  think I'll add more chili powder and maybe some cayenne and cumin next time....

This came out real nice. I left out the chilis, the Mexican tomatoes I found had them in there already. It's definitely got kick, so I would reduce the chili powder if you don't like too much heat.

This was very easy and tasty.  I didn't have 2 cans of Rotel, so I just used stewed tomatoes for one of the cans and it was still plenty spicy for our taste.

Very similar to the slow cooker recipe I make.  It's fast, easy and very flexible as far as ingredients. Try it with ground turkey, black beans and even a little cayenne for a little heat.  Great recipe!

The whole family loved this chili! It's the perfect amount of "spicyness". This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

I make this all winter long. Instead of a green pepper I add a red yellow and orange bell pepper. Ot takes away the earthy taste and adds more sweetness naturally. I also add oregano. Soo good

My family loved this recipe after I made a few changes. I added one diced onion and I switched the amounts of the diced tomatoes and the rotel ( 2 cans of diced tomatoes and 1 can of Rotel). I also used less chili powder to appease the palates of picky children.

Very good. I topped mine off with sour cream,as I found it spicy.  The spiciness level was great for my family though.

This is my go-to chili recipe. Love it! I usually use ground turkey instead of beef and I will leave out the diced green chili peppers if I want a little less heat. Turns out great every time.

Busy Day Slow Cooker Chili Haiku: "This was pretty good, but it needed some more 'zip', cumin & some heat." My two young girlies loved this chili & ate it voraciously topped w/ crumbled Fritos and shredded cheese. Husband & I enjoyed it too, but found ourselves adding more salt and hot sauce. I think it could've benefited from some cumin, more chili powder, and possibly a bit of cayenne pepper. I loved the texture and the smell of it and would gladly make this chili again.

Made this today. :) I've never made chili, but sooo happy I chose this recipe to start with. It was delicious! Just enough spice to taste good, but not to spicy for my 4 year old. Definitely using this whenever I make chili.

This was SO good and I'm not much of a chili eater!  We are experiencing a vegan diet right now, so I just substituted seitan for the meat and it was awesome!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a yummy chili, good with cheddar cheese on top.  I made mine with red and yellow peppers in place of green, extra beans, and frozen corn.  Very flavorful and easy.
