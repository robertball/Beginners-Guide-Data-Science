This was great! We're not big sloppy-joe fans, so I used a can of Wolf Brand Chili instead of the other stuff, and it was SO GOOD! I chopped the weinies and boiled them, first, then added them to a pot of chili, cooked through, and spooned the glop down over toasted hot dog buns. I covered it with cheese and put the whole thing under the broiler. Wrapped leftovers in foil and just reaheated them in the oven, they were great too!

This is very good and easy, but I have some TIPS...I actually sliced the hot dogs and put them in the mixture.  Then I just took 1 bun and opened it and put the mixture inside.  It ends up being a knife and fork meal anyway, so why not right?  I also added a tablespoon of hot sauce and a tablespoon of ketchup.

What a fun dish to make!  Instead of canned sloppy joe sauce I used M's Sloppy Joe Sauce recipe found on this site. Baked for about 10 minutes with cheese on top and it was a hit with my 2 yo and husband so this one goes into the rotation.

These were good. Much better than your average chili dog. As recommended by other reviewrs I added chopped onions and shredded cheese and baked at 350 for 10 minutes until cheese melted. I topped it off with some crumbled bacon and we loved it. Yummy!!

Last minute dinner last night. I don't keep Manwich on hand so I just made my own sloppy joe sauce (variation on Ruby Drive Sloppy Joe recipe which is also on this site). The boys thought this was okay. I liked it because a) hot dogs are almost always cheap and the boys will eat them without arguing and b) this was quick for me to make. Four stars as is, five the more personal you make it. NOTE: This needs cheese. Keep that in mind when you make it to top it with your favorite cheese.

I'm giving it 5 stars because it is in fact really good (that is, if you like the occasional hot dog or sloppy joe). Of course, use lean beef and good quality hot dogs for better taste.

I didn't really hold high expectations for this recipe. I was surprised! I was going to chop the hot dogs up and use hamburger buns but then I found some hot dog buns in the freezer... so I ended up only chopping up two weiners and the other six were left whole. I added a can of diced tomatoes and some Italian seasoning to the sauce because it NEEDED more liquid to cook the hot dogs. I also added some diced onion and maybe 3 oz of diced kielbasa sausage simply to use it up. It was really good! With the extra tomatoes, it made meals for two days and we used up both packages of buns - very little sauce, hot dog, and some cheese on the hot dog buns and sloppy joe mix on the hamburger buns! Our two-year old liked the hot dogs and picked out the hamburger. Thanks, Moonpie, for surprising me!

Moonpie, you've just won my hubby's heart. This kind of dish is so up his alley. Other than burgers, hotdogs are a close second followed by sloppy joes. All his favs kind of rolled into one. Thanks!

My husband and I thought this simple meal was delicious! I actually cooked my hot dogs in the toaster oven, and then we poured the sloppy-Joe sauce over it like a chili-dog. Super yummy! Easy and delicious :D

What an awesome idea!  My family loves sloppy joes and my boyfriend and daughter absolutely love cheese filled hot dogs.  We used those instead.  They both loved them and I liked them a lot as well.

Not bad if you are a sloppy joe fan. I am so so on sloppy joe's but decided to try this anyways and it's a good twist but I prefer regular old chili dogs :)

There really wasn't anything wrong with this recipe, but my family either wanted sloppy joes or chili dogs.  Our mind kept telling us we were eating chili dogs and the sloppy joe sauce was a tangy disappointment.

Amazing! I only gave it four stars because I made a couple of minor changes. I used canned chili dog sauce, heated it up with the hotdogs in it, then put the hotdogs in buns in a baking pan, spooned the chili sauce over them (very generously), sprinkled some diced fresh onion over the sauce, covered everything with lots of shredded cheese (Colby/Monterey Jack mix), then sprinkled some cooked, crumbled bacon on top, and baked it at 350 for about 10 minutes. It was absolutely amazing. My husband couldn't stop eating them. Even the kids liked them, and they are extremely picky. There were no leftovers.

We will make this again and again and again. We're hooked.

Hubby nor I are a big fan of sloppy joes anymore having eaten them most of our childhood, but I saw this recipe and decided to give it a shot. OMG! I absolutely LOVED these. Hubby was still kind of leary, but to me it gave the sloppy joes a whole different taste.  The onions are a must! This will be on regular rotation in our family!

These were so easy to make and they taste great!  They're also cheap.  I made it just as written, except that I chopped the hot dogs up.  If I make it again, I'll add diced onions.

Totally a genius idea. My niece and nephew ate this up, mostly due to the fact that it incorporated their two favorite things, sloppy joes and hot dogs.
