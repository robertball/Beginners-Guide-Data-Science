My only complaint is my husband can't stay out of it. It is very good. A lot less calories than an actual cheeseburger, and super filling. Flavor is very good. We're usually not fans of ground turkey- or any turkey for that matter - and this was best ground turkey recipe ever. I made a double batch and needed the 8qt instant pot and kept the pepper at heaping 1/2 tsp and the seasoning salt at 2 tsp instead of doubling it all and it was very good.
