Delicious..Very simple ingredients for a college student like myself.I added some vanilla and sprinkled brown sugar on top! Very good and simple. I also followed a previous raters comments and just put it all in one pan and cut them as soon as I took them out of the oven...works great! I will be making these again especially since I can't pry them out of my roommates hands!!

I lost my original recipe and this looked close to it.  If possible it was even better.  I smooshed all the dough onto a cookie sheet and then pricked it ful of fork holes.  As soon as it came out of the oven I cut them into bars. I had to freeze them as soon as they cooled or I would be tempted to eat them all.

This was just what I was looking for.  They were very buttery and my whole family loved them.  I added a tbsp. of vanilla extract.  I only needed 20 minutes cooking time.  Watch them carefully.  PS:  This is the same recipe as Scottish Shorbread IV only cut in half.

This is my all time favorite cookie!  They're sooooo good!  Sometimes I add chopped pecans to the dough, but they're still delicious without them.  Definitely give this one a try.  They're too good to pass up!

Great, simple shortbread recipe! I added a little bit of salt to the dough, and then pressed the dough into my  7" x 11" baking pan. I pricked the dough with a fork and then baked it until golden. While the shortbread was still hot, I sprinkled the top with a mixture of semisweet and milk chocolate chips, and after they melted, I spread it smooth and then ran my knife through it to make a design. It is super delicious this way, and everyone loves it! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe....I'll be making it again for sure!!!

I loved this cookie! It was amazingly easy to make and tasted better than anything I could ever buy. It inspired me to make a strawberry cheesecake using it as the crust. Amazing!

Delectable! I was pleasantly surprised by only three ingredients. They didnt look the greatest because I admit I didnt put much care in the way that I cut them. About 8 people in my family tried them and all commented on how good they were. I felt like a million bucks and found it hard not to inform everyone- THERE WERE ONLY 3 DARN INGREDIENTS AND even my little sister could make them and beam with pride. Also I'll add that these cookies would be perfect to give as a gift. You could have them done and cooled 2 hours before packaging them up and blessing someone with these rich cookies. Today I am going to give them a shot with the brown sugar Splenda which I found for 4.99 at my supermarket. Both of my Grandparents are diabetic and I know I can make a pretty package and drop them off for the both of them. Tasted similar to a pecan sandie, and I also wanted to add that I added about 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour and it was a nice addition. I really reccomend these and hope my review helps.

Brilliant recipe, exactly as it is.  Make sure you first cream the sugar and butter thoroughly and add the flour a little at a time, blend well with each addition.  you'll get chewy, crispy, rich shortbread.  Fabulous!

Very good.  I was looking to try and make a different type of shortbread than I usually make. (mine has icing sugar in it)  This was very good I liked the combination of the brown sugar and butter it gave it a richer tase than my usual shortbread.  I will be making this one again.

These are buttery, goodness!  I made mine into logs and sliced them and then dipped half into chocolate and the hubby went nuts for them.  This is similar to a place we pay a LOT of money for the same taste so I'm thrilled to find this recipe!  Will definitely make them in the future!

This is the same recipe as "Scottish Shortbread IV" from this site, with the only difference being in temperature and the fact that Scottish Shortbread IV is doubled.

These were good but I think they didn't taste that different than shortbread made with white sugar--however they made great bars and turned out very nicely.

This is a very nice simple cookies, quick to make and fun to make with kids. I got exactly the same recipe from Quick Cooking magazine (magazine doesn't exist anymore) and I've been making this for years. I love it because it's not too sweet. We are eating this for dessert tonight. Yummy warm from the oven!

These are fabulous and oh-so-easy... everytime I make them I get asked for the recipe!  I do notice that kids don't appreciate shortbread as much as adults though.

I didn't think there was any way that 3 ingredients would be adaquate to make these as wonderful as I wanted them to be, but I was wrong!  These were fantastic and satisfied my craving and NEED for amazing shortbread.  These are addictive, though...beware!

I'm giving it 4 stars because I like them.  But unfortunately, no one else did.  I followed the recipe exactly, so not quite sure if I screwed up or if everyone else is.

I have made and enjoyed these exactly as the recipe is written but I have also added butterscotch chips and pecans and they are delicious that way too. I'm making a batch to take to a sick friend today and I'm just certain they will make him feel better--instantly!

These were very easy to make. The brown sugar brings a slightly different but still nice flavour. Keep an eye on them so they don't get overdone.

These didn't turn out very exciting at all.  My hubby and I both thought they were bland.  I even sprinkled more brown sugar on top before baking.  Prolly won't make again.

Very nice and easy shortbread. Better look at the bottom of the cookies rather than wait the 25 minutes depending on your oven. Makes a nice easy snack.

These were good, but a little heavy.  Such a lot of butter!  I probably won't make these again, not because they don't taste pretty good, but because I have my heart to consider.

Very Good! After making this recipe we tried it adding cocoa powder... took them to a whole new level of YUM!! (Sorry, didn't measure the cocoa just eyeballed it, but if you have cocoa on hand you've got to try this!)

These cookies are a big hit with my family.  I doubled the recipe and cooked them on a cookie sheet and cut them after they baked.   Then my sister said I had to  make a batch for her.  I made a second double batch but this time I heated the cookie sheet and reduced the flour by 1/2 c.  and cooked them for 40 minutes.  These came out so so so good and had a beautiful golden brown color.    Love this recipe because it is so easy and delious!

Easy to make...easier to eat. I mixed everything in my stand mixer then pressed into a cookie sheet. Pricked with a fork and baked.  I cut them into squares after they cooled just a few minutes.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Just finished baking these cookies. Yummy! They don't look like much but boy do they taste rich and buttery. They could be my new favorite cookie.

I loved this recipe! I added a dash of vanilla and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts to the dough per the recommendations of other reviewers. Also instead of cutting the dough, I opted to roll out about 20 or so balls and flatten them and put them all on the same cookie sheet, really close together (i didn't have another cookie sheet). I poked holes in them and baked them for almost an hour at 300 and they were perfect. I think it took longer because they were so close together... Perfect cookie! :)

A delicious addition to my Saturday afternoon baking!  I followed the suggestions from other commenters and added a teaspoon of vanilla to the recipe.  I also pressed the batter into a cookie sheet and poked it with holes, cutting it after it left the oven.  The only thing I'll change for next time is adding some salt, or using salted butter.

This shortbread is wonderful!  I used a teaspoon of orange oil as flavoring in mine the 2nd time around. Either way is yummy - this is my favorite recipe for shortbread!

unfortunately, these are easy to make, but not very tasty.  Even my husbands co workers wouldnt eat them.  They do remind me of very old fashioned shortbread that grandma used to make.  so if this is the flavor you want, it's your recipe.

Very tasty, tender shortbread! Jen, if you followed the recipe exactly, I think your tasters just may not have been accustomed to the taste of shortbread. Perhaps they expected it to taste like a chocolate chip cookie without the chips? Just a guess.

These are so easy to make and so yummy! I mix in a little more softened butter and brown sugar  right before I roll them out and cut them. This makes them easier to work with. These are a family favorite!
