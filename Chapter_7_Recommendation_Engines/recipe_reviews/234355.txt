Marinated 24 hours then threw in the oven for 60 mins at 400F. It was amazing! I paired it with honey and biscuits! Yum

Great flavor.. i was looking for something quick. I only marinated for one hour. There wasn't enough left over marinade  so i made another batch of the marinade for basting.  I will definitely make again.

this was so tasty.. i don't know if marinating did it but the basting is absolutely necessary.. i cut the oil in half and added 2 tablespoons of water to make up for the lost liquid.. didn't have celery salt so used 1/4 tsp celery seed and a little more than 1/2 tsp of regular salt.. should have done 3/4 tsp.. will try that next time.. thinned out the leftover marinade with some water to ensure there was enough to be able to baste.. ty so much for the recipe.. UPDATE: made this again and realized i was pretty much out of paprika so i subbed chili powder and it was still delicious.. i upped the salt to 3/4 tsp this time and ended up salting my basting liquid to taste.. this has to be one of my favorite ways to make drumsticks.. ty again

I don't have a grill so I put the chicken on a broiler pan and took the advise of another reviewer and baked it for 1 hour at 400 degrees on the middle rack. I turned the drumsticks every 15 min and basted them with a brush. I made another batch of the marinade as there was none left over after the chicken marinaded. I didn't boil the extra marinade, I just brushed it on every 15 minutes. The chicken came out perfectly baked, juicy and tender. Boys kids loved it too. Will make this again for sure!

The BEST marinade ever! I will never eat plain chicken again! So simple to do. If you do chicken beast, I recommend that you slice it in half to make sure you get the flavor all the way through it. This  is a definite must try! You won't regret it!

I couldn't find my matches so I couldn't BBQ the chicken.  Instead, I put it in the oven at 400°F on a raised rack for the same out of time, turning and basting occasionally.  I did add a little bit of sugar as one user recommended.  It was a hit with everyone.

Excellent!  My whole family loved these. And I only marinated for 2 hrs. This will become a regular meal at our house.

This is so easy to make and it's a big hit with my husband, every time I buy drumsticks now he asks me to make these! The only thing I do differently sometimes is add a little bit of sugar (like a pinch) to the heated marinade. Wonderful recipe!

I baked it at 400 for 35-40 minutes, basted and turned. It caused a lot of smoke in the house. It turned out well, though.

Weird tangy taste.   Shouldn’t use Apple cider vinegar.

I thought the flavors were very good.  I did have to make a double batch of marinade to be able to have anything to baste with.  I used red wine vinegar and a pinch of sugar, since I did not have apple cider vinegar and they tasted great.  I accidentally overcooked and charred my chicken legs, but my boyfriend loved them and he doesn't even like chicken that much.  I served them with sweet potatoes and creamy garlic shells.

I only was able to marinate them for 2 minutes due to lack of planning but they turned out well! I used 4 thighs instead of 8 drumsticks but the marinade still was the perfect amount. When I make them again, I'll add some more chili flakes or paprika and cinnamon to get more spice.

Loved the hint of cinnamon. I burnt the basting liquid, so I used a dark cherry glaze to baste instead. It was amazing!

Seriously one of the best recipes I've made in a long time.  I marinaded this over night and then half way through cooking I added Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory Brown Sugar.  Delicious!

I did not like this recipe at all. The blend seemed "off"for my tastebuds I guess. I had high hopes for this recipe, but was disappointed.  I will salvage the chicken by trying to make chicken salad with it.

I really didn't care for it, but my fiancé did. I may try it again with less cinnamon and a dash of chipotle chili pepper.

This was a very unique and lovely chicken drumstick recipe! The only things I did differently was use white balsamic vinegar because I didn't have any cider vinegar and added a pinch of sugar. I also baked it in the oven at 400 degrees for 55 minutes. Mm mm mm perfectly cooked. It's got a great Spanish flavor but not too hot!
