Wow. I'm the first one to try to recipe. I did have to make alterations for the Dukkah sauce--I had no hazelnuts and toasted pine nuts instead. I also had trouble grounding the coriander seeds in the blender and did it without. I also had ground cumin and not the seeds.  I had no sea salt so I used seasoned salt instead.  I thought it was all right, though my egg broke when I lifted it from the pan. I've had one cutlet and one egg which was so filing.
