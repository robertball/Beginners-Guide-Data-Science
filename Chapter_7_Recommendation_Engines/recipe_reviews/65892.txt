I've prepared this recipe several times and it is always a hit.  I've replaced the butternut squash with sweet potatoes and have also combined the two and it always turns out fantastic.  I also bake the ravioli's for a few minutes before serving.

I only used one wonton with a teaspoon of filling and folded into a triangle. I had a lot of filling left over that put into the freezer to make again. My Husband kept saying how gourmet this dish was.

The idea of the recipe sounded wonderful. I was experimenting with making my own pasta so I only used the recipe part for the filling. I found that the squash flavor was completely overpowered by the spices added. If I ever attempt to make butternut squash ravioli again, I would significantly cut down the spices or just add brown sugar and let the squash stand on its own in the ravioli. I love butternut squash and I feel that this recipe was a waste of a very nice vegetable.

This recipe was great! Based on other reviews I added two finely portabella mushroom caps to the squash mixture and used only one wonton wrapper per ravioli (about 1 tsp of the squash mixture). Instead of the Sage brown-butter sauce, I made my own gorgonzola cream sauce with thyme. My friend who hates squash loved this recipe! Thanks for sharing.

I had some Pumpkin Ravioli in the freezer so decided to use the Brown Butter sauce in this recipe. I found it to be very rich. Could only eat half the ravioli I would normally eat (but maybe thats a good thing!!!). The sage flavour didn't really come through the butter but it was nice when you got a piece of crispy cooked sage with the pasta. Would use again as a starter but not as a main course.

The filling and sauce was awesome but I actually didn't like the wontons (too thin, they fell apart, see the pic I posted) and would make my own dough for this ravioli next time.

I wanted to make home-made pasta for the first time for my boyfriend over the holidays, and because he likes butternut squash soup so much I decided to try this recipe. OH MY GOSH I was not expecting it to be SO good!! I was skeptical about the sauce at first, but made it anyway to stay true to the recipe and I'm glad I did. My boyfriend loved this recipe so much that he bought me a pasta roller for Christmas so that I would make it again for him.

My husband made these for me last night after I challanged him to make butternut squash ravioli. Since grilled cheese and burgers are more his style, I thought this turned out very well! I agree with other posters, the butternut squash taste is a bit overwhelmed by the spices but if you use a light touch I think the filling works quite well. We balanced with an a light alfredo sauce and it was yummy.

I really liked the ravioli, but next time think I will add some chopped mushrooms to the squash for a little additional texture. I used a fork to crimp the edges after sealing with egg white. Followed the advice to put boiled ravioli in oven ... but be sure to lightly grease the cookie sheet first to avoid sticking. I covered mine with a sheet of sprayed foil too so they lightly steamed.

I made this recipe and it turned out great. I agree, it is a dish that is easy, yet your guest will be impressed with. I added a pict or two of mine on this site. I sandwiched my filling between the wonton wraps and used a wash of corn starch and water as a sealer, then cut them out using a round scollop edge cookie/buscuit cutter. The only spice I used in my filling was a pinch of nutmeg & salt and a little grated parm, corse black pepper and some finely chopped parsley. Don't skip the sage in the sauce...it makes the flavor's pop! I would recomend this recipe, for a side dish or pasta course with pork, a salad or green vegetable & some good bread, for a simple but great meal for dinner guest's or, just for your family!

The flavor of this is very unusual and at first my husband and I weren't sure we even liked it.  During the second ravioli we decided these were really delicious!  After reading the reviews where people stated they had issues with the wonton wrappers falling apart, I decided to make my own ravioli dough.  I made the dough recipe for Homemade Four Cheese Ravioli from this site and roasted the butternut squash the night before.  I definitely started light on the spices and then adjusted to taste.  I'm glad I did this because I ended up using way less spice than what the recipe called for per my personal taste preferences.  I also probably doubled  the parmesan since I am a cheese lover.  The butter sage sauce was awesome with the crispy sage leaves, and cooking them this way really mellowed the sage flavor (I was concerned because I'm not a huge fan of sage).  Defnitely a unique and really tasty way to use butternut squash.   I served these as the main dish but I think they would make a wonderful side dish too.

I really hate to give a recipe only one star, but this was a complete and total flop for me. The idea sounded so amazing...what isn't to love about tender squash-filled ravioli swimming in sage brown butter sauce? But this fell WAY short of my expectations. First of all, the wonton wrappers totally failed as a noodle replacement. The ones that didn't rip while being placed in the water got extremely soggy, and some even popped, after they cooked for about a minute. And the filling was also pretty awful...the combination of sweet spices and Parmesan cheese made for a bitter, weird tasting filling that didn't improve the soggy noodles. The only redeeming factor was the butter sauce...it made the ravioli edible. I was really looking forward to trying this, and was disappointed with the results. Thanks for sharing, but I won't be making this again.

This was very disapointing, the wonton wrappers just didn't work.I ended up deepfrying the rest I had and they were ok with a mustard dipping sauce.

I'm going to rate this for the brown butter sauce only.  Store bought butternut squash is to good to do all the work at home.  I have made this with both fresh sage and ground.  I prefer the fresh.  I kept the leaves whole and when they crisp up in the butter- YUM!!  This is a very easy week night no fuss no muss meatless dinner.  Thanks for sharing.

I made these twice. The filling is good as  side dish, however I found the wonton wrappers were not a good tasting cover. If you didn't really seal them well, they opened up in the water, they also became water logged when they cooked. Nanc

I love butternut squash ravioli - I order it often when we eat out.  I changed a few things - knowing what I would expect it to taste like.  I halfed the cinnamon and nutmeg suggested for starters for the filling.  I added toasted walnuts to the sauce along with garlic, basil - and more sage.  I also kept a little of the squash out cubed and added it to the sauce for texture.  I made my own ravioli but in a pinch for time I am sure the wonton wraps would work fine.  I will make this again soon.  I always thought it would be a difficult recipe to do - but now I can have it at home anytime I like!  Guess I will have to find something new on the menu to order.  My family loved it~  Of course we are veggie people so that helps.

I cheated and used vegan frozen butternut squash ravioli. Also, I didn't have any fresh sage so I used a half tsp. of ground. I subbed vegan parmesan (sprinkled on top) and vegan margarine too and threw some peas in for nutrition and color. My husband and I loved it!

It was a lot of work for less than wonderful taste. The sauce was too bitter. the recipe should have said to put wax paper between the ravioli, because they stuck together and fell apart when served.

I love butternut squash ravioli!!! This recipe was decent, but making it great is super simple. I read other reviews and used a bit less spices, but honestly should have used a lot less. Also i had another recipe that i have lost and i remembered that it said put dried cranberries and pecan pieces along with the sage into the butter sauce. and oh wow is it good! Otherwise, i love this pretty generic butternut squash recipe.

The flavors are too extreme. I would leave out the all spice & cut back on the nutmeg & cinnamon. Even the sage butter sauce was too extreme, need to cut waaaaay back on the amount of sage. I do enjoy flavorful food as well as intesteing & unexpected flavor combinations.

This was an okay dish. I agree with other reviewers that the wontons seemed gummy or pasty. The dish did not reheat well. It was somewhat labor intensive, especially for a rather iffy result. I didn't have the issue with the spices as I reduced the amount; it just looked like it would be too much.

This was so good, I get them in the fall at a local italian resteraunt they're only seasonal there and not on the menu all yr round. I was so glad i made these, now I can have them whenever I want. Hubby liked them too, but not the sauce so much, he said they should have had a slightly sweet cream sauce. for those who had a problem with the wonton wrappers. I used egg roll wrappers. place 1 egg roll wrapper on a cutting board brush with eggwhite/water mixture. using a tablespoon arrange 4 dollops of filling on the wrapper 2 on first row 2 on back row place another wrapper directly on top press down around the filling to seal cut out suares of ravioli- I used a pizza cutter- then use a fork and press to seal all the way around the edges. place the ravioli on a floured cookie sheet and place in the fridge for 1/2 hr covered with a clean dish cloth. when ready to cook boil a large pot of water satled and oiled. add 3-4 ravioli at a time- the key is to keep the water at a roiling boil this will prevent them from sticking together cook 2-3 min. remove with a slotted spoon and place on a plate tent with foil to keep warm. if you over cook the ravioli they will fall apart and become mushy and slimey! Thanks for posting this recipe can't wait to make again. this can easily be swithed up with pumpkin or sweet potatoes.

Great recipe! I pureed the squash added half the all spice/nutmeg (1/4tsp), kept cinnamon same. Added 1 and 1/2 tsp of light brown sugar to puree (for a little sweetness) and used 1/2 the sage and used salted butter instead.

Use half the amount of spices and a pinch of ground sage to the butter sauce and it's perfect! We had a Ravioili Making Party around my kitchen island. It was a great family night :)

this required soooo much work that i probably won't make it again- we had a butternut squash given to us by my farming neighbor so wanted to do something special with it, but this took a couple of hours and i wasn't all that pleased with the results. folded these wonton style.

I thought this recipe was not good at all. The squash didn't even taste like squash. If I wanted to eat pumpkin pie (or pumpkie pie filling) i would have made pumpkin pie. The Spices completly over powered the squash. I was very dissapointed.

I tried this dish at a restaurant and loved it! So I looked up the recipe for it an got this one as one of many results.  This recipe is comparable to what I had at the restaurant! It's really tasty, especially on a cold wintery day.  
The only changes I made, was to add toasted pine nuts to the sage sauce, and I made my own ravioli sheets.  
I highly recommend it!

filling was great (did cut down on the spices as recommended by other reviewers)! Even my picky child liked it. However, we would like something better than the wontons.  Just didn't have enough bite.

Wow, this was not good.  The filling was tolerable, but the wontons tasted gummy after boiling and the sage butter sauce didn't blend well with the other flavors.  I made this for my squash loving family and not one liked it.

The sauce was particularly funky, even though I completely followed the directions/tips the wontons got slimy then really sticky.  Won't be making this again.  Too bad...I really like good squash ravioli.  The quest continues....

Worth the effort. First bite was eye-popping wow experience. The sage butter sauce just brings it all together. Added a little agave to the filling, to "fatten" the flavor. If you skimp on the spices, sorry, you're a wimp ;-)

Only thing I might do differently next time: The won ton wrapping does not have an "Italian" mouthfeel. I'd love to try it with semolina dough.

I so wanted to like this recipe, and I will say that the filling was fantastic.  Savory and sweet and smooth, it was delicious -- after the recipe flopped, I baked up the filling and ate it as a casserole-type dish on its own!  The won ton wrappers were the problem here; I even used just one wrapper (folded over) and there was still too much of it.  They were disgustingly soggy, so I did as other reviewers have recommended and baked them -- at which point they turned tough.  The sage/brown butter sauce was fine.  I'd probably use that again... but next time I try making b-nut squash ravioli, I'll certainly use REAL pasta!

This recipe was great.  I added some sauteed chicken to make it more of a meal that my husband would eat.  I sauteed the chicken pieces in minced garlic, garlic salt and italian seasoning.  After baking the butternut squash, I poured the remaining butter into the squash mixture with the spices.  I added some worcestershire sauce into the brown butter sauce (tip from Carrabba's) and used 1/4 tsp ground sage since I didn't have any fresh on hand.  I took the tip from another post and placed the raviolis (and chicken) in oven at 300 to keep warm while the other batches were being made/boiling.  Served it with shredded parmesan and more italian seasoning on top.  The flavors were complex and made for a very festive fall dish that my husband loved!

I have found that pot stickers work awsome with the recipe, you can fill them with more then a teaspoon of filling.  I use more of the spices then it says.  I also make the sauce bigger if I have a load of ravioli and I use dried sage like two teaspoon or more.  Also, I use any of the left over mixture in the sauce, it is makes it more decadent!

I tried this recipe, and the wonton wrappers really didn't work out too well. While being cooked everything exploded into the pot...and didn't taste quite right. Next time I'll use real pasta.

This was a wonderful recipe and the members of my dinner party LOVED it! I think the spices compliment the squash excellently. The sage butter sauce adds a little touch to the already flavored ravioli. Highly recommended.

This review is just for the sauce.  This is the most suggested sauce for Butternut Squash ravioli that I saw, and obviously for good reason.  I bought a package of (Monterey) ravioli's that were delicious but this sauce made them excellent!   Make sure to use unsalted butter and extra sage! Thanks for the recipe!

These are very good and easy to make.  I do omit the cinnamon and allspice, though because it seems to "desserty" with those ingredients and has a weird taste with the sage butter.  I also tossed about 1/3 cup chopped walnuts into the squash mixture.  My husband, who is not a fan of vegetarian meals actually likes this dish.   In so far as people having issues w//wonton wrappers... I used the smallest ones, toss in boiling water for just a couple of minutes - never have had an issue w/breakage, leaking, mushy ravioli, etc.

Great recipe! As others have said easy to create but super impressive to guests. Not sure why people had a difficult time with the wonton wrappers staying intact, even the ones my 3 year old made held tight, smile. Will add mushroom and maybe some finally diced Vidalia onion next time for texture and flavor.

Wow this was a terrible waste of a lot of time. The wontons stuck together while boiling and didn't even taste good. I didn't even try it all together with the sauce. I'm not someone to give bad reviews, but this was terrible. Now I have to figure out what I'm going to eat for dinner after all of that.

I don't even want to give this recipe one star. I've made butternut squash ravioli before, and I really enjoy the taste of them, but we were looking for a different recipe to try out something new, since we try not to make the same recipe twice. We used wonton wrappers for this, and when everything was plated and ready to eat, most of us were able to eat maybe two or three of the raviolis. I, personally, ate maybe one and half. The wonton wrappers made everything slimy. I had no problem cooking them, but the filling was awful. It was much too sweet, and tasted awful with the Parmesan. The sauce tasted awful with the ravioli, because of the sweetness. I ended up remaking the sauce and adding my own spices to it, in order to try to save the dish, because it tasted too bland for some of us. The only thing that saved this was the stir fry sugar snap peas and baby carrots that we decided to use as a side for this. I don't recommend this recipe.

Although very interesting, I just thought it was too rich tasting for a main course. My sister really liked it, my husband hated it, and I enjoyed about 3 wontons worth. I don't think it's worth the effort, however, if wanting to do a gourmet-type meal and your company likes the flavors, then would make a great dish.

Filling was good, though I added some brown sugar to take the edge off the other spices.  We thought the ravioli came out slimy.  May try again but would fry or bake them.  Sage butter sauce was delicious - loved the taste and the texture of the sage.  If they hadn't come out a slimy, mushy mess I would have given it 5 stars.

Honestly I wouldn't even give this recipe one star. It was not to our liking at all. I read the other reviews and some people had problems using the wontons, I did not. The only problem with the recipe is the filling itself. It was awful. I've had butternut squash ravioli before and thought I would try to make it myself using this recipe. Won't be trying this again.

I love butternut squash any kind of way. I made this with already prepared butternut squash ravioli. For the sauce I used the butter and sage (bottled) but also added a little ginger (fresh in sqeeze tube) and buttermilk!  It was fabulous !  also added a little powdered garlic. YUM!

Yummy!! I didn't think the spice was too much.  In fact, I used only 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, but I wished I would have tried exactly how the recipe stated.  The butter sage sauce was crazy good.  Use fresh sage!  I used an egg wash for the ravioli.  My squash did not mash well and I baked it for 80 minutes. Continue to bake it until it's ready to mash.  I didn't want to wait any longer so I used it the best I could.  Oh!  I just realized I forgot to use the parmasean cheese too!

I loved this recipe. The squash is awesome. I never cooked with squash but this taught me that it can be a very useful and tasty veggie. I also lessened the amount of spices so that squash came through a bit more. A friend made this with Acorn squash instead of butternut and the taste was different but not bad at all.   I was however, disappointed with the sauce. I looove the idea of sage in the recipe, but it didn't come through in the sauce. I'm making it again to night and think I'll try a provolone cheese sauce instead. I think I'll add sage in there somehow though.

I love the filling!  I used 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese to go with my 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese!  I served these with rosemary seasoned fried mushrooms instead of the brown butter sage sauce.  We will be making this easy recipe again!

The flavor was really bland and on the sweet side for my taste. And maybe I didn't cook them right but the won-ton wrapper made them slimy.

The sauce was awful.  I didn't try the homemade ravioli so I can't attest to it.

I liked the ravioli filling, but did not enjoy the sauce at all.  Luckily, I stuffed shells as opposed to making individual raviolis.  In the end, I emptied all of the shells, added broth, cream, and vegetables and had a good soup!

Yuck. The wonton wrappers made slimy ravioli....we liked the flavor, but threw away most of what we made because we couldn't stand the texture. Maybe I'll try to pop em in the oven to dry em out a bit? seems like a lot of work.

used half the seasoning as suggested in another review.  The filling was tasty, but had trouble with the wontons.  I will again and make my own shells.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because I really liked the idea of using wonton wrappers to make ravioli.  The reason I didn't give it more stars is because the seasonings made it taste like pumpkin pie wrapped in pasta.   The sage butter sauce didn't work at all in my opinion.  The first serving was a total loss.  For sauce for the remaining ravioli, I sauteed fresh minced garlic and basil in olive oil.  This helped balance out the too-pie-like flavor of the ravioli and we were able to eat the rest of it.  Next time, I will only season the squash with Parmesan cheese, garlic and pepper.

I would agree that there was too much spice, but maybe not as bad as some said.(personal preference I guess)  I think next time I would make my own ravioli's and cut the spices a little bit as well.

I had read everyone else's review saying to add less spice than what was called for and added a personal note to my copy of the recipe to do just that.  But I accidentally mixed the filling up as written and OH MY!  It tasted so sweet--like a really nutmeg-y pumpkin pie....which isn't what I was looking for at all.  I want a squash ravioli where the main focus would be on the flavor of the squash itself.  Maybe putting in 1/4 of the spices called for would be a little bit more what I'm looking for.  Also, the wanton wrappers, while easy to buy, also fell apart in the boiling water about 10% of the time which I found slightly frustrating.  This is telling me it's time to learn how to make my own pasta.

The filling was great! We loved it. The won tons how ever kept falling apart..we had to play around with their shapes a bit. I only had ground sage so i cannot comment on the sauce. Paired it with steaks and english peas. Overall very good..will pass along to family :)

The filling was tasty at first as I only used half of the spices. I used the won-ton wrappers and it seemed to work out okay.  The sauce was not so good and the taste of the won-tons and even the inside once cooked was not so good either.  Maybe this dish was something not for our tastes?  Won't be making it again.

This is the best and easiest "gourmet" recipes. My whole family loves it. I used only half of the cinnamon, though, so as not to overwhelm the squash taste. A great recipe for company, or special occasions.

Not sure what went wrong here, because I followed the directions exactly.  The raviolis came out rubbery and gross looking.  They also fell apart in the water.  If I can find a decent ravioli pasta recipe, I'll probably try this filling again - it smelled good, but I never got to try it.

I found these lacking something. I'm not a very experienced cook, so I can't tell you what...just needed some extra flavor. Also, I found that the wanton wrappers made too much "dough" for the amount of filling.

Put in piroigi dough, seal and boil 3 minutes.  After, saute in butter and after add sage until  crisp.  Excellent. Don't forget to saute it.  It's better then.   For thanksgiving.

This was easy to make. But wonton wrappers are wonton wrappers. The texture and taste don't compare. If you do not have a sauce ready they will stick and tear later when you try to transfer them.

Followed the recipe exactly as shown except I used fresh pasta and not the wonton wrappers.  The sage butter sauce was fantastic- very easy and very flavourful.  The 3* rating is for the filling - not a fan of all the spices that I associate with sweet baking not savoury cooking.   It was ok just not the hit I was hoping it would be.

I just got a ravioli maker, so I did this the old-fashioned way. The filling is delicious, and the browned butter with sage is really quite nice. I sprinkled parmesan and Amaretti cookie crumbs on top.

I found the spices too strong and the parmesan made it too salty tasting. I was looking for something lighter snd definitely sweeter. Couldn’t even taste the squash. Like the wonton wrapper idea

I tweaked the filling a bit.  I chopped up some Portobello mushrooms, added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, pinch of ground sage and onion powder.  I also used wonton wrappers.  After reading the instructions on the wonton wrapper package I baked these for 10 minutes.  As I was sealing them(I used water and pinched with a fork)  I could see how soggy they were becoming.  Baking them made them toasty and more of a finger food/appetizer than main dish.  I didn't try the sauce.  Instead I used store bought mushroom Alfredo.  It's definitely a recipe to play around with. I will try making these again.

I made the butter and sage sauce and served it over pre-made butternut squash ravioli. It was an amazing flavor and I've made the sauce several times since and plan to do some for the freezer before my sage plant is done for the season.Yum, Yum, Yum! If I made made the ravioli portion too it would have been rated ++++

The spices were overpowering. I added honey and molasses to try and alter the flavor. Then a touch of dry sherry and finely grated parmesan cheese. It was better, but will never add that amount of spices again! My mistake...

I cook Italian many nights, having enjoyed living in Italy. One thing I discovered is we Americans tend to eat too much pasta at a single sitting.  So I have educated my family, including a brother-in-law who has been strictly meat and potatoes, that pasta is a SIDE DISH. A single raviole is much like a single potato chip...no one can eat just one...when using a great recipe like this one. And, like most of us who love cooking, we love to experiment with those POSSIBLE substitutions in a recipe. Some work; some don't work. For example: start with 1/2 of spices and use your taste buds to adjust. I did not use the parmesan. The fresh sage works so much better than dried versions. Also, allowing the butter to clarify renders the sauce much like melted margarine... somewhat oily and does not drizzle well. One substitution which I like is cinnamon to taste instead of the sage. My family enjoyed both flavors. I serve 3-4 ravioli in small accent dishes to be sure it remains the side dish. This is a great recipe to use with pumpkin as well. If you use one can of plain pumpkin, you will need a double batch of fresh pasta dough. I use fresh pasta dough in lieu of the won ton wrappers because it holds up better in the cooking process. I hope your family enjoys this recipe as much as my family has, even my "steak and potatoes brother-in-law."

Many adjustments need to be made to make this dish actually taste good. Do not use two wontons it creates way too much dough.

I skipped the allspice and added some finely chopped portobello mushrooms. Excellent!my family loved these!One note you must make sure there is no air pockets after you fill the wontons,if you don't your raviolis will fall apart in the water. I also put just four raviolis in the boiling water at a time.

I did not care for this recipe. 
First off the wonton wrappers were WAY to flimsy and using two per ravioli (which it what it says to do)- once you cooked them were WAY to big! The end result was a floppy, flimsy, and huge flat ravioli that was hard to serve and fell apart! Wonton wrappers aside once the filling was done I did not really like it either!

This dish was really different and wonderful!  The only problem we had was the raviolis sticking together after being cooked. Should be an easy fix nex time. Definitely making this again.
