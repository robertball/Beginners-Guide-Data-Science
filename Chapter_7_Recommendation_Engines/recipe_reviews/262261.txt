This is scrumptious! It's great for a week night dinner when you just want something that's yummy and easy to put together. I used ground venison instead of beef; added dried oregano, paprika, and cumin in addition to the chili powder, salt/pepper, and cayenne; used a full red pepper; and added about two tablespoons of tomato paste to the meat mixture. I also added a couple tablespoons of sugar to the cornbread mix. The cornbread batter looks ridiculously thin and liquidy--but don't worry! I spreads over the top of the meat and bakes up perfectly! I topped the cornbread layer with cheese and green onions, just for aesthetics. Will definitely make again, thank you for the recipe!

This casserole was easy and delicious, and I will make it again. I used 1 cup of corn and added some drained canned black beans. I used Jiffy corn muffin mix to add to the top, and prepared it according to the package directions instead of making the corn bread topping from scratch. Served over shredded lettuce and had sour cream and salsa to top it with. At 425 degrees, casserole was bubbly and the corn bread  brown in twenty minutes, so  watch  time carefully.

Great recipe!! My cornmeal got a bit dry with 30 min so I suggest checking on it after 20-25 minutes.

I cheated.  I used Jiffy corn muffin mix for the top and then put the cheese in it.  We really like!  I've made it twice already and I plan to take it to a square dance some time.

To make a more substantial dinner to satisfy my family, I added 2 cans of diced olives,  1 can of diced green chilies, 1 can of black beans , 1 can of red kidney beans and  1 can of creamed corn. I did not have red bell pepper, so I omitted it. I prefer a softer cornbread, so I added 1/4 cup flour. I have made Mexican Cornbread casseroles before. I really liked this cornbread recipe for this dish.

Bad recipe. Temperature (450 degrees) is too high and cook time is too long.  Lower temperature (400)  shorter cook time (35 min) and creamed corn instead of frozen corn works better.  Following this recipe w8ll get you burnt Mexican cornbread casserole.

Very easy to make! I loved it! I made this for a family get together and everyone really enjoyed it. All three of my son-in-laws got seconds even with all the other fun food that was there.
