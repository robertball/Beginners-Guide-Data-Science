Very good. Used fresh Steelhead that had been baked first and then deboned.

This sounds like it would be very good- I haven't tried it yet, but plan to. I would probably just add a pound of cod which is available here (sea bass isn't), add 1 pound of halved fresh mushrooms and skip the sugar at the end. All the rest sounds awesome!
