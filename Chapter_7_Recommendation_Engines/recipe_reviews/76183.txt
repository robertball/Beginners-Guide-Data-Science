I made a rookie mistake and didn't check my pantry and found I was out of nuts! I thought about chocolate chips but decided they would overpower the taste so I grabbed a half bag of skor bits and poured them in the brown sugar, cinnamon mixture. The strusel in the middle turned into a tasty butterscotch swirl. The topping was the best though as it was almost like a brown sugar sauce in spots where the mixture was blobbed. So good! I wouldn't make it any other way now.

my only changes were to increase the cinnamon and used all purpose flour. 1/4 tsp did not sound like much. However, there is the cinnamon suagr in the crust when it was buttered and it didn't really need the extra cinnamon after all. Great way to use up the too many ripe pears I had on hand! mine came out nice an moist. I did not use the carmel. I like carmel...but this cake is quite sweet as it is and added carmel would make it just too sweet for me.

This cake was delicious.  A great cake to make that's quick and easy and perfect for an afternoon snack with coffee.  I used almonds instead of pecans as I didn't have them.  I also used a loaf tin instead of a tube tin so I had to bake a little bit longer for the middle to cook. The cinnamon sugar coating used to greased the tin caramelised slightly which gave it a great texture.  Didn't use the caramel topping..I think it's sweet enough.

Delicious and moist. I used all purpose flour, omitted the ginger and added more cinnamon. I also did not use the caramel topping. I did however use a light powdered sugar/milk/vanilla icing. The brown sugar/cinnamon/pecan topping is the best part. A bit time consuming but well worth the effort.

I made this as a 13x9 coffee cake with only two layers.  I thought the batter needed more liquid - it was difficult to spread in the pan - and after baking found the cake entirely too dry.

Not a 1,2,3 Cake!  I will make this for company (The day before!) Also, I thought I had ALL the necessary ingredience...Wrong!  I wasn't aware that, What the pear tree gave us, was eaten and the rest shared with neighbors.  So, I used strained canned peaches, as a substitute. The remainer of the sour cream, in the frig. went bad....so I used plain yogurt, instead.  Since I had all the other ingredients, including the Carmel topping, it was great! Maybe, I should  re-name this..."The Substitue Bundt." PS: It also needs More than 2 TBS.Cinnamon sugar for coating...

Great cake. Delicate and rich flavor at the same time. I used canned pears (2 medium cans of pear halves in pear juice). I had no problems gettting the cake out of the pan either. I also used light sour cream, applesauce for the butter and AP flour for the cake flour (and followed sub directions given on allrecipes.com substitution chart). I didn't think that the spices overwhelmed the flavor of the pears but the pear taste doesn't jump out at you either. I'll make this cake again as one of our during-the-week desserts but not for a special occasion. Thanks for posting the recipe.

I made this cake and everyone loved it.  I also had a few people ask for the recipe.  I made it exactly as written except I substituted splenda for the white sugar to cut some of the calories.

I had lots of fresh pears so I doubled the recipe and put it in 4 loaf pans. Great texture, moist. But even though I like ginger, it was too overpowering. I would half the spices and sugar in the crumble mixture. The pear cake itself even without that mixture would have been better I think.

cake was pretty good. i fried some pears in butter and some honey and also made my own caramel sauce to top it.  i think that without the fried pears i would have only rated three stars. also, i ended up with a lot of batter and the cake was over-flowing. i didnt mind, but just be weary. of course, if you bake a lot, you would know not to put as much batter in the pan as i did.

Made exactly as recipe stated, it's a good cake. Nobody
raved about it, so for the amount of work required, I
probably won't make it again.

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out delicious.  Very moist, good texture and just sweet enough.  I don't think it is very fair to rate this as a 4 star if you altered the ingredients and methods.

I made this for a potluck breakfast without adding the ice cream topping.  It came out moist, flavorful and looks beautiful after it is sliced. Everyone at the potluck loved this cake and several wanted the recipe.

This cake was very moist.  I didn't have enough sourcream so I used half sourcream and half vanilla yogurt.  Next time I won't use all the brown sugar/cin/ginger mixture in between layers. It overpowered the light pear taste.

It wasn't awful, but the outside of the cake was pretty dry, and the cake batter itself really didn't have any flavor, aside from the pear chunks. Underwhelming, but with enough vanilla ice cream on top, we made it work.

I  made this recipe as written except made homemade caramel sauce.  This cake is very good except you can't taste the pear. Pear is  very delicate and was overwhelmed by the other flavors.. This cake would be much better made with tart apples.  Next time I use this recipe I will make it a Sour Cream  Caramel Apple Cake... just my preference.  Thank you for sharing.

This recipe was a really big hit at our Christmas gathering this year.  The "coffeecakiness" is exactly what I was looking for.  it has crunch and dry crumbliness and moistness all at once.

I made only slight changes, sticking pretty closely to the recipe as written.  
1.  I couldn't find any ripe pears, so I had to use canned.  I used about a can and a half or so and just  sort of bluntly cut them into smaller pieces before adding to the recipe.

2.  The amount of ginger in the recipe scared me a little; it smelled so strong when I started to measure it out, that I only put half, and then I put a little extra cinnamon.

3.  After I added the caramel topping, I also sprinkled the top with powdered sugar through a little sifter, and it brightened up the look of it a little bit.

I ignored all of the optional ingredients, including the nuts.  And I used all purpose flour instead of cake flour.

The ginger and pear smelled amazing together while baking, and the ginger was not overwhelming in the flavor, as I was afraid of.  Next time I may try adding the full recipe amount.

One note, which is just an observation - the batter is very thick, more like a dough.  And it made me think I might have done something wrong.  I didn't.  So if you run across that also, don't worry. 

Other reviewers have mentioned that the caramel topping seemed like too much.  I disagree.  It was perfect.  The whole thing was perfect, and everyone loved it.

My pears must have been on the large side--the pan filled a bit too full and then overflowed just a bit while baking.  AND it took 70 minutes to finish baking.  The batter is very thick, but settles into shape nicely.  I wasn't able to tip it out of the pan, but that wasn't an issue for me.  Otherwise, nice texture and flavor.  I'm with the rest of the reviewers that it's plenty sweet as is and didn't need the caramel sauce.

VERY good cake!  I didn't have pecans so I followed the advice of another reviewer and dumped in about 1/2 bag of toffee bits (I used Heath).  The cake was AWESOME- but for my taste- I would have like more ginger and cinnamon- then it would have been five stars!  I baked at 375 for 55 mins in a bundt pan.  YUM!!!  I will definitely use this recipe again!

This is soooo scrumptious. Took about 10 minutes longer to bake then the suggested time, but worth the wait.

This was a good cake.  Had a little prep work, but overall not that difficult.  Husband is a cake person and LOVED it.  Not being a cake person, I thought it was okay.  A little heavy on the cinnamon/spices for my taste, and I even used an extra pear.  Didn't really care for the caramel topping with it.  I think whipped cream would go better.  It comes out very heavy!
