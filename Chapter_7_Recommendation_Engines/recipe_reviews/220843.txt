Simple and delicious.
I julianed the carrots and frenched the apples.
For dressing, I used 1 cup mayo, 1/4 cup sugar, 2 Tablespoons lemon juice.  Nice and tangy, but probably didn't need the sugar.

I like this recipe because it's more like my mother used to make...but I think I'd like to try coleslaw dressing as it's a little less sweet and a little tart...love the idea of apples, I think I'd use Honeycrisp apples, cause they are very crisp and delicious!

I don't care for raisin salad but made this for others who do and they thought it was too sweet. I followed the recipe exact.
