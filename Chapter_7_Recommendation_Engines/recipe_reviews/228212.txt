excellent! for the most part, I kept ingredients as listed, but changed the method to combat the spreading and thin result others reviewed.I always bake with butter flavor crisco,  bake with parchment paper and only bake on sheets that have cooled off, that helps spreading.   after mixing dough, take the time to roll them into longs rolls of dough as in refrigerator cookies.  yeah, it adds a little prep time, but it probably saves time in the long run. I quadrupled the recipe and formed the dough into around 7 long bread stick size wax paper tubes.  let them sit in fridge all day, and only pulled one tube out at a time, slicing them into pieces the thickness of checker pieces. molded them a little as i placed them on the cookie sheet.  got 27 cookies per sheet, at 4x7 rows. finished cookies were perfectly round, uniform and nearly identical in size to Nilla Wafers from the store.  made a total of 18 dozen little, delicious, beautiful, impressive cookies! filled to galon size ziplock bags, needed extra cuz recipe.   Am using them in banana pudding, will update this review after trying them out in the recipe.  By the way, the amount of grease that is on the wax paper when you are slicing them is alarming, but the finished product is absolutely perfect.  for the sake of health, next time i will try to reduce the amount of butter/shortening just a tad to see if i still like the cookie.  overall, this is gonna be my go-to vanilla wafer cookie for sure! thanks, usmcwifey!!!!!!

These little vanilla wafers are so delicious!  After reading  several reviews, a common theme I saw was that the cookies spread a lot, so I increased the flour slightly to 1 and 1/2 cups and also increased the vanilla to 1 and 1/2 tblsp.  The shape held perfectly and after nine minutes, they were golden brown on the bottom.  The only thing I miss is the crunchiness if the store bought kind, but since I didn't make a banana pudding, that didn't really matter.  I will definitely make again and I may try decreasing the heat a little and leaving them in slightly longer to try to get them crunchy. Very yummy!

These were perfect for me and are quite good but I don't eat the commercial version so I can't really compare to that.  They started to overbrown on the edges after 9-10 min but I needed most of them for crumbs in another recipe so I left them in to make sure they were crunchy. I did start chilling my pan in the fridge between batches and that helped the browning. I put the dough in a baggie and clipped off a corner to squeeze dollops on the cookie sheet which worked very good. I also used the last little bit to make a snowman by spacing the dollops about 1/2 to 3/4 inch a apart :)

I was right in the middle of making my Dad's favorite Banana pudding (for Father's Day) when I realized I forgot to buy the Nilla Wafers at the store!  So I googled homemade ones and found this recipe.  Was thrilled that I could whip up my own homemade version and will be able to complete my dessert this morning without another run to the store!  :)  Thank you!

These cookies are very good. The recipe is essentially a sugar cookie. I added an extra tsp of vanilla extract because yum. :) I did make them a bit too big, but that was my own fault because I didn't read the '1 tsp at a time' and tried to guess instead. 

Anyways, so excited to know that I can make my OWN vanilla wafers using REAL ingredients. Thanks for the great recipe.

I buy vanilla wafers all the time. My husband eats them as a snack almost every day. I was excited to see these and the recipe was very easy! The cookies were good but they did not taste like vanilla wafers to me or my husband, these tasted more like sugar cookies!

I made this recipe tonight and I have to say that they really ARE better than bought, by a mile!  If I hadn't made them to put into another recipe, they would probably all be eaten by now.  Vanilla Wafers are one of my hubs favorite snack foods, so I will beat him off of these until I can get my final product made. For anyone who had a problem with the cookies spreading, cover the bowl of cookie dough with plastic wrap and chill it in the fridge for a couple of hours before baking.
UPDATE:  These were somewhat chewy rather than crispy after they cooled, even though they were crispy when still warm.  That says to me that they need more baking time or need to be completely cool before removing from the cookie sheets, or both.  They taste wonderful, though.  I will experiment with them until they come out right.

Very good cookie, I found they are chewy not crisp like Nilla Cookies but I like that better anyway.  Great alternative in my book.  :-)

I thought this was a great recipe  Cookies turned out crunchy and brown but tasted much better than store-bought.  I doubled the vanilla and added a healthy tablespoon of cinnamon.  For cooking, I followed the advice of  the reviewer mariegg, except I never use shortening in cookies.   I rolled into breadstick size rolls using wax paper and refrigerated overnight, cut into checker size pieces and  made sure to cook on cooled sheets .  I made my first batch last week and will be making more this week :)

Great! Very similar to sugar cookies. Bake about 15 min for crispy texture, like store bought wafers.

I'm not sure these turned out (for me) like they were supposed to. I kind of pictured something like "Nilla Wafers". Because I live at a high elevation, cookies sometimes don't turn out as expected when I bake them. I made this recipe exactly as written, but for the first sheetful, I thought "surely 1 teaspoon isn't enough", so I made each cookie about a tablespoon, and the cookies spread and almost became one whole sheet. So subsequent batches were really a teaspoonful each. Even then, the cookies spread and, when cooled, were very flat, slightly lacy, and very crunchy; the vanilla taste was fairly prominent. The results I got weren't all that exciting, but were decent, crunchy treats. I ate them by themselves, but I'm sure they would have been better as suggested, e.g., as sandwiches, or with puddings.

These were good, just not quite the same flavor as the store bought kind.  Everyone loved them, but I guess I was a bit disappointed that they weren't just like the store bought ones.  I followed the recipe exactly.

I did not change anything other than to add half a bag of Heath bar pieces that I had left in my pantry. I did not refrigerate the dough or anything. I made sure to roll it in only teaspoon size balls which I then flattened slightly with my hand before baking for 7 minutes. They turned out perfect!

Excellent recipe,.  I use one that is _nearly_ identical and prefer it a bit more (it is my wife's favorite cookie) as the cookies do not spread quite as much and are crisper -- the difference?  Removing the egg yolk and using only the white.  (The recipe I use also subs some actual vanilla bean seeds or paste for some of the extract - 1 pod of seeds and 1/2 T extract - but that shouldn't impact the spread/crispness too much.)

My 5 year old granddaughter loves to bake with me and waiting is not her strong suit. She is also VERY picky, so I saw this recipe and we tried it. She was hesitant since we were doing drop cookies, but rolling in sugar appealed to her. We followed the exact recipe and used Rainbow Stars sprinkles from The Gourmet Baking Company. Her opinion is they are the best, most delicious cookies ever! They’re simple, delicious and picky child approved. I never listen to fussy cooks, they’re too competitive. You did a great job with this. I love the taste and will make it often and pass it on.

I've made this recipe about ten times now and have enjoyed it right as recipe lists as well as modified.  It's super easy to make and phenomenal with banana pudding. The wafers hold a bit of crunch with the pudding which is delightful. Very good tweaked with half almond extract and half vanilla.

Perfect to make a banana pudding!  My hubs looked at the bunch of bananas and told me I needed to make a banana pudding before they got any riper.  Soo, no nilla wafers in the cabinet so I looked these up.  Popped them in the oven and then into the pudding.  Very happy with the result.  I'd make these again for sure.

Love these cookies!  They turned out very well.  Even Hubby and 17 yr old son loved them.  That's saying something since they usually don't eat a cookie unless it has choc chips in it.  :)  A definite keeper.  thanks so much for sharing!

I love the butter-vanilla homemade goodness.
For convenience and quickness to assemble the banana pudding, I will purchase the store bought vanilla wafers.
It is good to have this easy go-to recipe when needed and wanted.

THE best vanilla wafer cookies I have ever tasted!  Always get compliments on their flavor... An excellent base for cupcake sized cheesecake bites!

These cookies turned out delicious but I wouldn’t consider them anything close to a Nilla wafer but more of a “thinster” cookie. The raw batter tasted like vanilla ice cream and once baked, they turned out light brown and crispy on the edges and soft and chewy in the center. The batter spread out a lot more than I was anticipating. I used a small 2 teaspoon ice cream scoop so I knew my “wafers” would come out larger but they spread out so much they almost touched. I was able to fit 12 on a cookie sheet. I think this would be a great recipe for someone who likes a thin, chewy but still crispy sugar cookie. Not someone looking for a nilla wafer recipe.

I just made these. Rhis recipe is perfect as written. I followed the recipe exactly. Better and more flavorful than store bought. They baked perfect...I have never seen a poofy vanilla wafer...they are supposed to be somewhat flat. I rolled mine in 1" balls and even flattened down the balls about 1/2 down. Thanks for the recipe!

I took the advice of another reviewer and added a little extra vanilla and upped it to 1.5 cups flour for the spreading. They didn't spread as much as I thought that they might based on the other reviews. However, they were thicker and since I haven't really had store bought vanilla wafers before I'm not sure how to compare, but the flavor was nice, and they came out a bit on the cakier side. Might not alter the recipe at all next time.

I loved this recipe and my husband loved the cookies too. He does not like store bought vanilla wafers so I think he was pleasantly surprised that these were so good.
I did make one change because I am a diabetic. I changed the sugar for 1/2 cup of Splenda Sugar Blend. 

The only thing that I am confused on is the nutritional information.  How many cookies does the recipe make and how many are a serving?
This is very important to a diabetic so if this could be made clearer, I would appreciate it so very much.

Although I don’t think these taste anything like store bought nilla wafers, they are absolutely delicious! I made a batch earlier to use in a recipe, and I am going to make another batch to just eat. Great recipe and super simple.

These were delicious!!! I did make the mistake of using salted butter. Next time I will omit the salt, there was enough in the butter. Even with the salt, they were delicious!!! Mine were puffy, not like a wafer like. Loved that it had a very small amount of ingredients. Needed a quick dessert, and this worked great.

They didn't taste like store bought vanilla wafers at all. However, they were really good. Kinda like a butter/sugar cookie mix. Really very good dipped in milk though. I'm thinking maybe a bit more vanilla and a bit less butter might help make them taste like vanilla wafers.

the dough was crumply -dry , and so when i baked it it did not spread at all .... i quickly put a bit of milk and more butter in the rest of the dough- i was able to make little balls  and squished them between my palms to make a cookie shape- that worked much better ....

Great recipe that I converted to gluten free by using Bob's Red Mill one for one flour. I also refrigerated the mixture for about 20 minutes before using an extra small scoop to put the dough onto the cookie sheet.

Addicting little cookies!Love this cookie with our banana pudding or by itself. The tsp size leaves a great crunch and we enjoyed them a bit larger also.  I have used white cane sugar, organic cane sugar,  or Swerve to have great results each batch.  I roll the dough and press gently for the cookie result that I like best but will try rolling a doubled batch and slicing as considered before and like mariegg's comment on that. I've used room temp butter and never had a consistency issue, perhaps due to a fall kitchen instead of summer. I will also try palm shortening in the future. Next option is to add some cinnamon for a snickerdoodle type wafer in our pudding!  Appreciate this super fun and easy recipe usmcwifey! oo-rah!

This is a very good little cookie, but it is NOT a vanilla wafer.  I got 24 cookies and they did spread quite a bit.  I put one tray in the upper oven and one in the lower oven.  The lower tray spread less, but the bottoms got too brown even with just 12 minutes of cooking time.  I think I could make a couple of variations of this cookie--a chocolate wafer (with the addition of 1/4 c. of unsweetened cocoa powder) and a cinnamon cookie (with the addition of 1-2 tsp of cinnamon).  I will try both.  This is an easy cookie to mix up and bake when you need a quick dessert.

These didn't taste like the boxed version, which is not a problem. I agree with others that they taste very similar to sugar cookies.  I used them for a banana pudding but haven't tried it yet. The cookie however, is delicious.  I didn't have a problem with them spreading too much like others did.  I used a tsp to portion each cookie and they ended up about the size of a half dollar coin. I cooked them for exactly 15 minutes at 350 F and they were nice and crispy.

These are so delicious. This is twice that I've made them and both times they have disappeared like hot cakes!  Also both times I quadrupled the recipe. I did take the advice of one of the reviewers and refrigerated the dough. I also added 1 extra Tbl spoon of vanilla. I do that with any of my recipes that call for vanilla. My vanilla is pure, it's more expensive but tastes better than the imitation.

Taste is very good, but the texture isn't the same as the commercial product.  They have a more distinctive vanilla flavor which I really liked.  Although they are great for eating, I made several batches and crushed them into fine crumbs and used them in recipes for  rum balls and brandy balls.  DELICIOUS!

I  doubled the vanilla. Had to cook 13 mins @ 350 then flip and bake 3 more. They would not brown on top. I let the 2nd batch sit in the pan flipped over to cool. Those came out nice and crispy. The first batch according to the recipe was much softer. My complaint....while tasty they do not taste like vanilla wafers to me. Great texture...Better than the name brand but the flavor is too mild and lacking something. I will make them again if my pudding doesn't suffer. Thanks for posting the tecipe.

AS per reviewer I also Changed the method to decrease the spreading & thinner results.I bake w/butter flavor Crisco, bake using parchment paper & only bake on sheets that have COOLED OFF, that helps spreading. After mixing dough, roll them into longs rolls of dough as in refrigerator cookies, OR USE MY SMALLEST COOKIE SCOOP. I quadrupled the recipe & formed the dough into around 7 "long bread stick size wax paper tubes". let them sit in fridge all day, & sliced 1 tube out at a time, into pieces the thickness of checker pieces. molded them a little & placed them on the cookie sheet. Finished cookies were perfectly round, uniform & nearly identical in size to Nilla Wafers from the store. made a total of 18 doz. NOTE: the amount of grease that is on the wax paper when you are slicing them is alarming, but the finished product is absolutely perfect.

Made these exactly to the recipe and they are delicious. I live overseas and can't find the store bought Nilla wafers, so I made these which are much better. Tomorrow I'll use them in Banana Pudding.

I just made these and they came out...soft and chewy like every cookie I make. I sought this out trying to find a recipe for cookies that would come out crisp and it hasn't happened. They were small enough, went into the oven for the full 15 mins and barely browned.

Very good! I added a bit more vanilla and these were delicious. They can brown/burn on the bottom fairly easily so watch your temps and times! Will definitely be making these again.

These were so tasty! And here, I've been buying Nilla wafers by the box like a fool! They're so easy to make and came out perfect! Mine were at perfect texture and doneness at exactly 12 minutes at 350 degrees! I wouldn't change a thing about it!

I was looking for something simple and delicious. This recipe is just that. I only used half the amount of sugar and it's definitely sweet enough. Also, mine did not spread too much while baking. Just right. Thanks for sharing! :)

Delicious!  I used Splenda and made them sugarfree.  They don't look like vanilla wafers, but hold up and taste great in banana pudding.

Used these cookies in a banana pudding recipe in place of the Nilla Wafers it called for.  I didn't have vanilla extract, so I used vanilla syrup instead.  Turned out great!

This is the best cookie recipe I've tried in years! Super easy and pretty tasty. I put brown sugar instead of white sugar and I added oat and chocolate chip too.

This was an amazing recipe for me, was just looking for an easy basic cookie for the family. This was prefect and easy. Tastes just a little sweet in my opinion but just like a nilla wafer except tastes WAY better!

This is a great recipe normally, but when you roll the dough in cinnamon and sugar you have a great tasting snicker-doodle! Both ways are great, but watch out, they spread. A lot.

I've made these three times since I first found this recipe.  I tend to make them when I want something sweet and cookie-ish but don't have anything on hand that fits the bill.  Everything you need for them is probably already in your pantry.  Add cinnamon and almonds and they're a total delight.

Just as the recipe says, this is better than any boxed vanilla wafer.  This is the perfect recipe to have on hand for all those recipes you need vanilla wafers for.  I’ll never buy boxed vanilla wafers again.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent cookies. Be sure not to over cook them even the least bit because they become hard if you do.

just got done making these cookies. hubby, who is my taste tester, agreed with me that they do taste like sugar cookies. however, he did like them.
when making these, i added protein mix and to compensate i also added about 2 tblsps of almond milk, which made the mix a bit more 'wet'. i also put in a 2nd tblsp of vanilla but it still tasted like a sugar cookie. next time i will omit the almond milk. i will definitely make these again.
