Thanks so much for this recipe- Its awesome!! So yummy, they are moist and perfect.  I substituted 1/2 the oil with cinnamon-applesauce, and 1/4 of the brownsugar with slenda, and soymilk instead of milk.  I also added a little cinnamon. Everyone loved them. They are light, but sweet, great healthy treat!

pretty good. i added about 1/4 tsp salt - i felt they needed that - i also used vanilla soy milk, halved the sugar and used liquid stevia in place of the other half cup of sugar... these were like very soft cookies - i felt like i could have even made them into muffins. they could probably use some raisins or choc. chips or nuts or something else.

The idea is innovative, but the reality falls short of the dream in an, "it's the thought that counts" type cookie.  This recipe has promise IF modified.  As is it is bland is it's taste.  The appearance and texture are pleasing: a warm brown color and soft center.  I split the batter into three sections on my first try to experiment with it since others reviewed it as "bland."  I made one batch "as is," one batch with cinnamon in place of nutmeg and one batch with fresh, plump raisins.  All three batches still needed a little something different such as white sugar.  But I'll have to find out how that turns out next time.  For now, I give it three stars, because you're certainly on to something here.  I look forward to reading future reviews with other variations.

Actually pretty good with a few modifications.  I added cinnamon instead nutmeg, also added dried cranberries and walnuts, also a few tablespoons of honey. Cooked them a little longer on 350 before switching to 325, but a nice healthy treat!

mine turned out like little weird pancakes. Although it might be my fault, I experimented with applesauce as half the vegetable oil and did soymilk instead. They tasted alright though.

What healthy cookie doesn't taste good with chocolate chips?!?  These were tasty and filling with the addition of chocolate, but I'm not sure I'd be willing to try them without that addition -- they might be too bland/dry.

I agree with everything BusyDad reviewed (see below).  He said it perfectly.  I love the idea of healthy treats, but this was just okay.  I added finely chopped salted peanuts and mini chocolate chips to mine (upping the calories and downing the healthiness) but they just werent anything special.  I may try to tweak this recipe but probably not.

These cookies were bland and dense, I tried adding more sugar and cinnamon but they are still very bland.  If you are dieting and looking for a cookie substitute these are for you.  I probably won't make these again.  I gave it three stars because they are edible.

I just made these anticipating the blandness, so...  I added chopped dried appricots and honey.  They went from 3 stars to 4 with that addition.

These are really good! I was talking to my mom earlier, and both she & my dad are in Weight Watchers, and when I told them I had found a recipe for cookies that you make with wheat germ & whole wheat flour, she wanted to try some. So, at ten o'clock in the evening, I'm making them. And they are YUMMY! Not too sweet, but a very good cookie. Thanks for sharing, Linda!

I added 1/2 cup chopped nuts to the recipe.  Very tasty and healthy.
