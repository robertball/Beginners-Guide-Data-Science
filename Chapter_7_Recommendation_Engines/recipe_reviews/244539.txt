I used Swerve confectioners instead of sucralose (1 whole cup since it measures equal with sugar, unlike sucralose) and this was ridiculously good.  Fresh tasting and sweet. Swerve has no aftertaste. Game changer for those of us trying to cut down on sugar intake! I just made a second batch to top another sugar-free cupcake recipe. It doesn't set firm like regular frosting, but a small price to pay considering I never thought I would lick frosting off a spoon again!!
