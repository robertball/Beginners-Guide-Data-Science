If you leave the peel on, push in the stick, then peel. Also freeze before dipping and the chocolate will adhere really well, then coat as you please. Just put back in the freezer until you are ready to eat.

This is one of my kids' favorite summer treats. There's so many things you can do with this recipe, it's very flexible. Use white chocolate. Dip it in nuts, coconut, mini chocolate chips, dried fruit. You can even add flavor extract to your favorite chocolate. It's fun to make with the kids and they love eating the end product.

I used a box of baker's semisweet chocolate squares (6), which I melted in the microwave.  I didn't have popsicle sticks, so I used some skinny chopsticks I had on hand :)  Just remember to cut the ends of the banana first, or it will split, and I definitely was not trying to make banana splits :) (Anyway, I ate this mistake with the leftover chocolate, hehe).  Also, I dipped mine in finely chopped pecans instead of the cereal.  For freezing, I placed them on a cookie sheet that had a sheet of parchment paper.

I'd like to add a couple of tips to this recipe that I've learned from experience. First, it's really important to let your... bananas ripen until they are covered with *small* brown spots. That ensures that their sugar level is optimal. Next, when you freeze them, do not place them in a freezer bag. Moisture that evaporates from the bananas as they freeze will result in ice crystals on the bananas if it is trapped within a plastic bag. This ice will melt into the chocolate when you dip the bananas and cause the chocolate clump. If you do see ice crystals on the frozen bananas, brush it off prior to dipping them. In addition to being a great tasting treat, frozen bananas are also a good food source.

I didn't have the Baker's Chocolate but I used melted chocolate chips and butter. And for the outside I used cocount. It was surprisingly delicious...a new family favorite!

What a nice summer treat for kids. They loved it & have sprinkled different cereals on. **TIP** freeze first & the chocolate will stick a lot better.

In honor of Girl Scouts (and it being that time of the year), try rolling the chocolate covered banana in crushed Thin Mints--yum! definitely freeze the banana first, otherwisethe chocolate doesn't stick well

Growing up, my mom always made these for us and they were such a treat! Sometimes she would make them plain and sometimes she would top them with nuts, sprinkles or m&m's. These are so fun and yummy too! :)

Yummy!!  I read the reviews and took some advice but I guess I'm a little dumb because the review said to freeze the bananas first so I did but you need to cut them in half, put the sticks in and peel first then freeze them. Also It helps to use a double boiler not a sauce pan. I put sprinkles on half and crumbled heath bar on the other half and left 2 plain for my sister. I think I might try them with peanut butter chips or mixing them would be really good also.

Am I the only one that thinks frozen bananas are too hard to eat. It was pretty good, but too hard for me to eat and my kids wouldn't touch them, neither would the rest of my family.

YUM! I used dark chocolate and peanuts (only because I didn't have any crispy cereal). They are a hit.
