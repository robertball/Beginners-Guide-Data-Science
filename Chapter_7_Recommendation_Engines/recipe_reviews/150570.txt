I am a cook NOT a baker. I was a little worried when I saw the picture-it looks kind of yellow. This pie turned out good! It is layered and the middle layer IS yellow! I do not have a pie plate so I did the store bought, regular size pie crusts. I followed the directions exactly and divided it between the two crusts! It turned out great but the layers are thinner!
