Fabulous frosting! But scale down to 6 servings for much easier measuring. Six servings comes out to: 1/2 pound cream cheese (8 ounces) softened 1/2 cup butter softened 3 cups confectioners' sugar and 3 tablespoons maple syrup. -- Double the above amounts if more frosting is needed...and more WILL probably be needed! Not that it didn't make enough...but it's good enough to eat right from the spoon! =) I suggest making an extra batch and storing it in the fridge for pancakes and/or french toast the next morning. Great recipe! I used it on a "Maple Pecan Butter Cake" and it was THE perfect frosting! NOTE: I used only HALF the conf sugar and with the maple syrup it was PLENTY sweet...but if you like it really sweet...go for it and use the entire 3 cups.:)

Great frosting with a little modification. I used it on the "Iced Pumpkin Cookies" from this site instead of the glaze. I too like to make the measuring easier and use 1/2 cup butter 8 oz. cream cheese and 3 cups powdered sugar. To make it a little less sweet I like to use 1 tsp. maple flavoring (found next to vanilla extract at the grocery store) instead of syrup. This is a great recipe to top off your favorite spice/apple/pumpkin recipes!

this is my new favorite cream cheese icing recipe. i also add a little maple flavoring to intensify it just a little. i've used this on cinnamon rolls (fantastic) and most recently on pumpkin cake/bread sprinkled with heath toffee bits. rave reviews there too.

Use less powdered sugar and add a tsp of maple flavor if you have any otherwise the maple flavor isn't very prominent.

Mmmm mmmm! Yummy!!! Made this to frost 2 dozen cupcakes today (pumpkin bundt cake - Lucille Noyd). The frosting complemented them perfectlly! As a couple other reviewers suggested I too used only an 8 oz. block of cream cheese a stick of butter (1/2 c. worth) 3 c. confectioners' sugar and 3 T maple syrup (to begin with...). I also added a 1/2 t of maple extract (one reviewer suggested adding a t but that was based on the recipe as is; since I scaled this I only added half that amount). After everything was blended I "snuck" a taste and decided to add another T of maple syrup (now 1/4 c. worth total as per original recipe) and another 1/2 t maple extract - perfect! My fiance really liked this (he snuck a bite too!) which surprises me because he isn't a cream cheese fanatic. His only complaint is that this was a tad too thin. Oh well that's an easy fix (just refrigerate it). My cupcakes looked so cute with a small amount this frosting piped on (a little goes a long way IMHO) and a sprinkling of maple sugar! Thanks for sharing your recipe Caitlin. I'm sure this would be yummy on spice cake / cookies too!:-)

I have to say I am pretty lame. I didn't have enough cream cheese and no maple syrup so I did for 6 servings with only 3 ounces cream cheese and had Mrs. Butterworths syrup and it was incredible! Can't imagine how good it will be with all the right ingredients! I did used it on a banana/vanilla cupcake recipe I found on Allrecipes incredibly yummy!

Excellent! This frosting is so good! I used it as a filling for Pumpkin Whoopie Pies from this site and it worked very well. I halved the recipe and only used about 1-1/2 cups or so of sugar and it was just sweet enough. Yum. Thanks!

Love it!!! I even messed it up and it still turned out delicious. I blended everything together and then realized that I forgot the butter and that I only had 1/4 cup left. I just added it at the end and it still turned out really good. I put it on applesauce cupcakes and the combination was excellent!

Too sugary! The basics are good but if you use the full 4 cups the sugar flavor is overpowering. I need a great maple cream cheese frosting on my pumpkin bread but good grief this one takes some altering. I have revised to 8 ounces of cream cheese (much easier to buy/measure) 1/2 cup unsalted butter 2 cups confectioners' sugar 1/4 cup maple syrup and salt to taste.

I used the 6 serving size. Also substituted maple flavoring for the syrup (its what I had). DELICIOUS! Perfect amount to generously ice 24 cupcakes. (pumpking ginger cupckes were a great match! Very fall!

This is a good starting point for maple cream cheese frosting but there wasn't enough maple flavor and the syrup made it too thin. I think next time I'll leave out the syrup and just add maple flavoring.

This is wonderful. I love maple flavor so I added a bit more. I also tried combining this recipe with the recipe for whipped cream cream cheese frosting. I LOVE it and so does everyone that I have made it for.

Great recipe - I changed it to 6 servings and then used only about 2 cups powdered sugar maybe less (all I had). And based on another commenter's suggestion I added about 1/2 tsp. maple flavor. It turned out a little loose (due to not having enough sugar) but very tasty and perfect for my needs. I'm going to serve it with some zucchini banana bread and let people spread their own on the bread slices. Giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think the proportions call for too much sugar.

I decreased the recipe to 6 servings but otherwise followed it exactly. This was delicious. I'm not a maple fanatic but the flavor of this was not overpowering. I used this frosting on Pumpkin Ginger Cupcakes from this site and it was a wonderful combination. Thanks for a great recipe!

Amazing! Put this in pumpkin whoopie pies and on gingerbread cake - it makes anything and everything delicious. Makes a ton though - do a half batch unless you are frosting the inside/outside of a cake.

I whipped this up for some impromptu banana bread. I wish I had maple flavoring in the house it was a little faint with only the syrup. I added more syrup but I think it thinned it out too much. HOWEVER it tasted great and the husband loved it!

I used a cup and a half of powdered sugar instead of the 4 cups that it called for. It was still a bit too sweet for me so next time I think I'll only use a cup.

I did not like this recipe. I made two batches. The first I followed the instructions exactly and it was much too sweet and not enough maple flavor. The second batch I cut back the sugar and increased the syrup and the consistency was all wrong. I wouldn't make this again.

This is a good maple frosting but adjusted a little bit. I did reduce 1/2 cup of maple syrup down to two tablespoons and let cool before adding to cream cheese & sugar mixture. This made for a very good maple flavor. I used 8oz of cream cheese and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and one tablespoon of heavy cream. Everyone in my Vermont family loved it. We are in the middle of maple syrup season!

I tried this as a frosting for carrot cake muffins. Decided to add extra maple syrup and a spoonful of almond butter as well as a few teaspoons of vanilla. I only had whipped cream cheese on hand which worked fine also did not need as much sugar was plenty sweet for my taste.

I'm giving this four stars because I think it would be way too sweet with four cups of sugar. I only used two cups and added extra maple syrup to get the maple flavor to come through. Very delicious on Apple Spice Cake.

Made this for my daughters quarantine birthday carrot cake. More than enough to frost and fill a 9 inch round cake. I thought it was very thin so I added more powdered sugar. It is very sweet and the maple flavor is barely discernable. My husband loved it though. After I scooped extra into a storage container he happily cleaned the bowl and beater.
