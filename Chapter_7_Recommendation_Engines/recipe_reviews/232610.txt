I've made this twice for my church. It was a huge hit and many people have asked me for the recipe. Although working with gelatin is always a bit time consuming, the recipe is extremely easy. It's attractive and delicious.

This was straight forward to put together, and tasty too. I followed the recipe as is, and made no adjustments. In retrospect, I will place the cool whip on the setting jello without adding the reserved jello to it. The bright white layer would be more appealing.
