I just made them, and this is awful! They are way to dry, taste like nothing, and the outside has baked into a shell around the tasteless inside. Please improve this recipe or delete it.

Horrid. Missing an ingredient or two and cook time is way to long. This recipe needs to get rewritten and tested or tossed.
I just wasted flour, butter and eggs on it.

These were horrible. They had absolutely no flavor. They don't have sugar! The only flavor enhancer that goes into the batter is apple cider. No salt, no sugar, no spices.
