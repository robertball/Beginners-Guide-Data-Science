Oh wow...this mixes some sweet w/ a little heat!  I left out the shallot -b/c I didn't have any- and I didn't have any allspice berries -I didn't even have ground allspice, so I put in a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and black pepper (google's substitution for allspice).  I used tri-coloured rotini, for extra colour. Ohhh wow...I'm glad we tried something we normally wouldn't have...it was incredible!  Will post a photo

I substituted fresh-squeezed orange juice for the Grand Marnier (same amount) with some orange zest from the peel thrown in for good measure. And I used about 1/4 tsp. allspice rather than the whole allspice berries the recipe calls for. And I left out the cilantro, since neither my partner nor I like the stuff.

The amount of chile paste specified in the recipe will make it very hot, so you might want to dial that down if hot/spicy isn't your thing.

This is an excellent and unique pasta dish.  Even though I used a food processor, it does take some time to prepare the sauces, so if you want to save time, prepare them the day before. I will also try ground allspice vs. the whole berries. For me, biting into a whole allspice berry detracts from the enjoyment of this dish just a bit. My other personal preferences are to add 2 chopped jalapeños to heat the dish up a bit and double the Grand Marnier. I like the effect of the Grand Marnier and since it’s boiled, all of the alcohol is removed. Finally the cilantro really brings out the flavors. Don't leave it out!!

Good recipe.  I didn't have shallots, chicken stock, or liqueur, but I did add a little orange juice and replaced the berries with allspice powder.  I also didn't have enough shrimp, so I also added scallops, which turned out rather nicely.  I think this would go well on top of rice, rather than with noodles.

This was a wonderful meal!  I did subsitute a few items that I didnt have on hand.  I used about 1/2 can of diced tomatoes.  Instead of the Brandy based Orange Liquer, I used freshly squeezed Orange Juice.  I also ommitted the curry powder.  It turned out perfect!  Thanks you for the great recipe!

This recipe was wonderfull.  I didn't use any chile paste or curry powder (didn't have any). Instead I used red pepper flakes and the result was a dish with the perfect amount of kick.  I also used plain brandy and a splash of orange extract in place of the Grand Marnier.  I also used ground ginger and sundried tomatoes.

This dish is possibly the best pasta dish I have ever made or eaten. I didn't have any orange liqueur so I used orange/pineapple juice and I also used a halve of a lemon for more of a sour orange taste. Else I stuck to the recipe. This will be a family favorite forever. Thanks!!!!!

This was really good and spicy, too spicy for my husband actually. Next time I won't put in as much chili paste. I used ground all spice instead of whole berries, and OJ instead of Gran Marnier. I also used whole wheat pasta. The left-overs taste great!

Good flavor but the curry dominates...will use a little less next time.  i also might add some jerk-style seasoning to make it more caribbean.  also, the chili paste could be too much for people...definitely add to taste.  thanks for the post!

This was excellent. Not too spicy, not too tangy, but the perfect blend of both. I used gemelli pasta and wouldn't change a thing if I made it again. I wondered about substituting rice for the pasta after reading other reviews and really I love rice, but after trying it as the recipe states, I decided this is definitely a pasta dish. You can't even taste the grand marnier if you're wondering. Try it, it's great!

Very good recipe and very adaptable.  Didn't have whole allspice so used ground.  No Grand Marnier so subbed brandy/orange juice with some zest from the orange to boost it.  Used canned tomatoes (Muir Glen 14.5 ounce, 1 each diced and crushed fire roasted).  Only had a pound of shrimp so added a pound of andouille sausage that I browned first.  Great flavor and will definitely make again (husband's request!).

Oh wow, was this delicious!  I didn't have any orange liqueur, so I used orange extract; it worked out very well.  I also didn't have any chile paste, so I used pepper flakes.  Other than these changes, I added a small can of pineapple tidbits that I had in the pantry.  Perfect addition!

I thought this was good but I'm going to make some changes the next time I make it. I used pepper flakes instead of chili paste. Next time I will cut down on the amount. I also used half a can of diced tomatoes. Next time I will use a whole can. I used orange juice instead of the orange liquer which worked out really well.

It wasnt the flavor I was looking for at all. I wanted a more tangy sweet and spicy, and for me it was just a weird flavor. I didnt follow the recipe exactly, i didnt have shallots or green pepper, but i dont think those would of made me like this. It was edible, just wasnt great.

I doubled this recipe for fear that it might not be enough. We ended up having a good amount of leftovers, so the original recipe amounts are definitely enough for four people. I made the sauce a day before serving it as others suggested. I included the tomatoes and by the next day, they were very sweet but shriveled looking, so I could have added them later . The sauce smelled wonderful and was perfect because I had most of the ingredients on hand. I used about half of the chili paste and it was fine but might use the full amount next time to try it out. Overall a good sweet/spicy dish.

This dish was great, but I kept wondering why my mouth was burning after the first bite?  Come to find out, the curry powder I had was RED curry powder.  Ooops!  I would definately try this recipe again with regular curry.  The only thing I left out was the tomato, but that's just personal preference.  Thanks

I thought this was just ok.    I made it exactly as listed, except ground allspice instead of whole, and I actually forgot the cilantro at the end.  Maybe it would have helped?  The flavour of the sauce had a nice Carribean kind of feel to it (it is spicy but not overly so) but I just wasn't crazy about it with the pasta.  I think it would be better with rice, but I guess afetr all the rave reviews I expected it to be a lot better. My Hub didn't like it much either. I won't make again.

This dish takes awhile to make, but is ultimately delicious and highly recommended.  My only change: I used one heaping tablespoon of Thai Kitchen's Roasted Red Pepper Chili Paste instead of two.  The spice level was perfect; it had sufficient kick but didn't burn my face off.

My husband loved this dish.  I also thoroughly enjoyed the first few bites until my inadequate tongue couldn't handle the spice.  (Should have listened when I made him taste test the crazy Japanese chilli paste I bought and he said it was hot even for him).  I also used ground allspice.

I'm always looking for new and different ways to prepare shrimp and prawns and I found a "keeper" in this one!  I did follow the advice of the reviewers that had boldly gone before me in that I used ground allspice but other than that, I didn't need to tinker with the recipe very much at all.

Nice easy dish to prepare.  The fruitiness of the allspice really plays nicely off the chili sauce to create a tangy flavor which is not too spicy.

Fantastic. Made this for my boyfriends tiki party and everyone wanted the recipe. I left out the cilantro (ick) and used ground allspice instead of the whole berries and it was great.

What's great about this recipe is that the sauce can be made beforehand.  I made it the day before I served the dish and it really gave the flavors a chance to blend together nicely.

This is very good, everyone in the family liked it and the shrimp were of course a hit.  I followed the recipe to the letter EXCEPT, powdered allspice instead of berries (it tasted fine), and no cilantro, sorry to the earlier reviewer but there was none around!  And it's just great that way, tangy and tasty and a bit spicy.  Oh, didn't have chili paste so I shook on some hot sauce.  Use fresh ingredients and let the sauces sit for a few hours in the fridge, it's easier time-wise and tastes better too.

I made this for a shower for my sister, only I used chicken instead of shrimp.  Everyone really liked it and the leftovers were heated up with Ragu.  The only problem I had was finding chili paste!  Most grocery stores don't carry it.  Try an international store that carries oriental specialties.

This may be the best pasta I've ever made.  Followed the recipe except didn't have enough curry powder so added a little curry paste.  Husband wants me to make it tomorrow

A nice spicy, hot, and sweet dish.  I used ground allspice instead of whole.  I also cut back some on the Brandy a little.  I brought  
a can of whole peeled tomatoes instead of peeling them myself, and that still did  the job.  I have used whole allspice berries before.   If you can find them,  they work great with food,  because the taste stands out more. Remember hot!

I made it exactly as the recipe states.   It was wonderful and not at all too spicy.   Next time I will remove the tails from my peeled and deveined shrimp and ensure they are all properly thawed.  A little too much water forced me to cook,a little longer, which only slightly effected the shrimp.   I've been trying to add a picture but it doesn't seem to want to work.  Will try again later as it looked as good as it tasted.

I reduced the ginger, curry, allspice and chile paste.  It still came out flavorful but not too spicy.  Even my kids liked it.  Will make again.

Made this for a group of 8 ladies. Everyone loved it and requested the recipe.  It's a yummy combo of sweet and spicey.  I had to make a couple of minor revisions:(1) used a combo of Grand Marnier, Cointreau and OJ of what I had on hand to meet the 1/2 c requirement since I doubled the recipe. I would say NOT to skimp on this step because the orange flavor is really tasty (2) reduced the heat.  I could not find chile paste so used hot sriracha from my pantry.  After taste-testing the hot sriracha and considering my crowd, I reduced the 4 Tb. of chile paste to 1 Tb. of hot sriracha for 8 servings with the option to add more individually.  The heat was still there to add complexity to the flavors without having a simmering fire in your mouth. The amount of shrimp is pretty generous so you could scale back a bit if needed. The cilantro adds a fresh  flavor and new texture. I served over tri-color rotini which looked fun but will serve with angel hair next time to spotlight the flavors vs competing with three textured pasta flavors.  It's an easy dish for a group because of the day-ahead prep or you can make the sauce a few hours ahead.

Personally, this was not my favorite. I think what bothered me about the recipe was that it is a fusion of so many different flavors, and some of the ingredients and spices get completely lost in the mix. It's kind of like this: I really like chili paste, cilantro, orange liqueur and curry powder in general. But when you put them all together in this recipe, you seem to lose the individuality of each part and they kind of mesh into one unusual, strange flavor. Will not be making this again.

Excellent, even my husband who is not a curry fan went back for seconds.
Didn't have any Grand Marnier so I mixed some orange juice and brandy.
Couldn't find chili paste so I used some chili sauce.  It was great.
This is good enough to serve to company.  Next time I will try it with chicken. Love the flavors.

This was so tasty! My family raved about this dish. We ate this on top of rice instead of pasta, and added a pound of diced chicken, which I cooked in the garlic/ginger oil. In the future I will change just a couple of things: use half the amount of chili paste (I used Sriracha chili sauce.) and double the amount of brown sugar. This was done accientally when I made the dish, and it had just the right amount of sweetness. I will definatly make this again!

While this dish is a bit time consuming, the end result is fantastic! I took someone else's suggestion and made the sauce the night before.  The only change I made was to sub ground allspice.  I served this dish with the Strawberry Mango Mesclun Salad on this website and it was a big hit at my dinner party!

I made this for my husband for Valentine's Day.  He and I agreed it's a keeper.  Something that's completely different that maries the pasta and the shrimp well.  Also, low fat!

While I assembled this dish differently, I don't think it changed the final results.  I didn't have any Grand Marnier, so I had to use the juice of a couple of clementines.  I didn't have chili paste either, and I subbed Red Curry Paste.  I didn't use 2 TB of it, I used one heaping tsp, and boy was that hot enough!!  This was an interesting mix of flavors.  I also used whole wheat pasta, I think that may have helped tone down the heat some, but not much.  If I make this again, I will certainly cut back on the curry, or look for chile paste.  Thanks for the post liebelune!

this is a GREAT! although, there is no way i could fit 1.5 pounds of shrimp in that sauce + the 8 oz. of pasta! we cut about each of those in half and it was incredible :=) *just be sure NOT let the shrimp overcook in the sauce. ours were borderline-chewy! Not so great. I will be making this again next week!!!

This recipe is delicious, but a bit too spicy for me. Next time, I would use half of the chili paste.
