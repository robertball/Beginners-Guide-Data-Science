Excellent, excellent flavor.  Each ingredient just jumps up and down in every bite. The sweet raisins, tangy balsamic vinegar, and peppery arugula simply blend naturally with the savory breaded cutlet. The only reason I see this as a 4-star recipe is method. I had originally intended to just bake it, skipping the frying step, but wanted to keep to the recipe. I preheated the oven, then once I had pan-fried the cutlet, it was cooked. So, either pan-fry or bake, but both, is really unnecessary. Also a recipe easily adapted to a gluten free diet. Thank you for the scrumptious recipe!
