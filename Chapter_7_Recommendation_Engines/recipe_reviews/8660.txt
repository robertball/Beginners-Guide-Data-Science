I made this for 2, but with some AWESOME additions!!! I juiced 1 orange and added it to the other ingredients, along with about 1 tsp of orange zest!!!!  YUMMY!! The orange juice & zest just gave it that extra kick!  Will make over and over!  Some of the best chicken I ever made.

This chicken turned out very tender with a very flavorful sauce.  I cooked it in a slow cooker on high for 3 hrs b/c I didn't have time to cook right before dinner and served it over rice.

We loved it!!  Have made this recipe several times and will continue.  I prefer using only 1 package of onion soup mix and I let the chicken breasts soak in mixture in the fridge overnight.  This is one of my family's favorite dinners.  Great with rice.

This was pretty good. I don't much care for cranberries in a recipe...too tart for my taste...but this was good. I do want to say that I am tired of posters like "Auntie Pat" as her/their reviews are always based on healthy ingredients, as if they are the food police and know better than the rest of us.  This is NOT a site based on healthy ingredients so she, and others who feel the same, should just stick to sites that only promote healthy living. If I wanted only recipes that are good for me and my family, I'd seek them out. OK? LOVE this site!!!

I was really scared about these ingredients going together, felt like something I would have made while pregnant and couldn't put my finger on what I wanted, so I had it all :-)
Honestly though, it was really good, sauce was nice and thick, like a rich barbeque sauce.  My husband ate it, said he would eat it again, but it should be in the "make every three or four weeks" file-he's really picky though-thanks for providing the recipe-and making some of us take the great risk!

I'm sorry to say this, but my family hated this recipe! We threw this dinner away after a couple bites and looked around the kitchen for something else to eat. Sorry!

I used 4 chicken breasts but this makes a ton of sauce, so I recommend using 6.  Also used Russian dressing & only 1 pkg onion soup mix.  Very tasty...kind of a sweet & sour/tangy flavor.

I substituted Catalina dressing for the French.  This was very good, Maybe a little too sweet. My son and his friend took all the sauce off their chicken before they ate it.

I really like this dish. I don't use 2 packages of onion soup mix - I had a previous version of the recipe that called for 1 package and I found that too strong, so I use 1/2 a package.  I also subbed low fat french dressing for regular.

I used skinless thighs instead---very moist, flavorful recipe!  Could not be easier if I tried.  I was a little leary of the combo of ingredients, but worked BEAUTIFULLY!!!

This recipe is the same as Cranberry Chicken I, except that 2 packages of onion soup mix is added. It is way too salty and over powering. Stick with the other recipe.

I made this with leftover thanksgiving turkey...the turkey shredded up a bit and became more like hash, but it got 4 thumbs up from my family and I got to eat all the leftovers.  It was great on top of mashed potatos and stuffing.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was delicious! Plenty of sauce left over, which I saved to go with pork chops later in the week.

I have made this for years using whole cranberry sauce and only 1 pit. Onion soup mix.  If some think it too sweet, try 1/2 cup French dressing ( or Catalina) mixed with 1/2 cup salsa.  This is wonderful over rice and makes a pretty presentation for company.  Steamed plain green vegetable and a salad  and croissants, and you look like a pro!

This dish is AWESOME!!! The first time I made this I made one tiny change to the recipe I added 1/3 of a can of light beer. My husband and I just like a hint of beer in some recipes so we thought we would try it. It is great both ways, though. My toddler loves it, too. I always use Catalina dressing. ...Oh, I also cook it in the slow cooker instead!

This was awesome and SO easy!  I used fat-free dressing, to cut down on the calories.  I think this would also be great on pork chops or pork tenderloin...  Thanks for sharing it, it's a new favorite of mine!

This has become a family favorite. I slice the chicken breasts in half. I also add whole dried cranberries, a dash of cinnamon and some orange zest. We serve it with wild or brown rice. Sometimes we make it with pork chops.

'Cranberry Chicken' is something my family has been making for years, though, a bit differently. I came across this recipe and thought I'd test it out because it's very similar. The only change I made when making it is adding some worcestershire sauce. I figured that the onion soup mix was a good idea but it ended up making the flavor too 'onioney' and the sauce too runny. I usually make this recipe minus the onion soup mix with a tad worcestershire sauce and some onion powder or sauteed onions. The sauce turns out much thicker and makes a better gravy. You can also substitute Russian dressing for the French dressing.

Very good. I only used one pack of onion soup, to cut down on the sodium but it was still very tasty.  Quick and easy, with few ingredients - my favorite kind of recipe.

Though this recipe was tasty, and my family enjoyed it, I probably won't make it again. I saw another version that uses more cranberry sauce; perhaps it would lend a more fruity flavor. I made a similar recipe last week, using apricot jam instead of cranberry sauce, and that one was much more popular at my house!

We tried the recipe this weekend using one packet of onion soup mix since many reviews mentioned doing so. 

The recipe was received with mixed reviews. Couldn't really put a finger on the taste or if we liked or did not like it. 

Chicken was moist. There was too much sauce made by the mixture of ingredients and I wasn't sure what to do with it. I don't see it as a rice or pasta sauce so I felt it was a waste of ingredients.

Worth a try though! This website is great!

I thought this was pretty good - not the best, not the worst.  My husband didn't care for it as much but he rarely likes meat/fruit combo dishes.  I wish I had read the reviews first because I also felt it was too salty and would have only added one packet of soup mix.  But I will not make this again.

Ok, wow!  I read the ingredients and thought I would be the only one to like it.  Then I read the reviews and thought I could give it a shot for my family...  5 kids all loved it and had seconds!  I followed the advice of those before me and only used 1 pkt of onion soup and reduced the dressing slightly.  It was wonderful and is a new staple in our monthly menu.  Thanks!

Good. Based on suggestion, I only used 1 onion soup packet. I'm glad or the nion soup would have been overpowering.  Also used about 3/4 of dressing so it added some flavor but you could still taste the cranberries.

This was so yummy! I made it with chicken thighs in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours and some orange zest. So great, the zest added wonderful flavor. I served it with jasmine rice and steamed veggies for a nice dinner. This one's going in my recipe box for sure.

Following suggestions of others, I zested an orange and let the flavones mingle for several hours.  At the end I gave it a quick shot under the broiler, and it really was a nice change to chicken.   Next time I may try Catalina dressing, and I think using one packet of soup mix was adequate.

This is our go-to dinner when we don't want to cook.  It is quick and easy and something we both enjoy.  We have it with Bob Evans refrigerated potatoes which are excellent, and usually something green.  The cranberry sauce is good on pork too.  I gave my son the recipe and it is a regular at his house too.
Quick, easy and very good.  You couldn't ask for more.

This chicken is very easy and turns out moist & tender.  The sauce is just "so-so".  I expected it to be more tangy.  I might try it again using Russian dressing instead of French???

Quick & easy. Didn't have soup mix so I used onion powder & salt and peppered the chicken. Had over rice with peas. Husband liked, I loved!

My mom had made this chicken for as long as I can remember.  It is one of my favorites.  I have made it with both breasts and parts.  It is great either way.  I only use one package of soup mix and 1/2 bottle of Catalina dressing.  I never tried it in the slow cooker only in the oven.  Unfortunately my husband is not a fan so I dont get to make it often enough for me.

This was very easy and delicious! The only thing I did different was allowed mixture to set for about an hour before adding chicken. So that dried onions absorbed more of the liquid.  You can also substitute thousand island dressing for this recipe!

The ingredients sounded interesting so I thought I would give it a try...changing a few things...I used chicken thighs instead of breasts. Also i seared the thighs and dumped everything into my crock pot (using one package of onion soup) for approximately 4 hours. It tasted alright, definitely wasn't too crazy about it. It was very sweet and even with only one package of onion soup it was still too "oniony" for me. My boyfriend also didn't like it so we passed the left overs on to a friend and he really liked it. I think it's one of those recipes you either really like it or you really don't! This time I really didn't! Sorry!

As always, I had left over cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving. When I saw this recipe for Cranberry Chicken, I had to try it as a way to use up my leftover sauce. I was very glad that I did!  It is so easy to make and very, very tasty!  I followed what some of the other reviewers suggested and used only one package of dry onion soup mix, Catalina dressing instead of French, and some orange zest.  Absolutely delicious!! I won't wait until next Thanksgiving to make this again!

This was pretty tasty, but I docked it a star because the one hour listed for the cooking time is way too long.  I checked it after 45 minutes and it was already a tad overcooked.  I don't normally have french dressing, so I found a recipe from this website to make, which was pretty simple.

I tried this recipe a few nights ago.  I think it is a variation on another recipe which I have been using for several years and I got it also from All Recipes (Apricot Chicken).  It is different in that Cranberry sauce and French Dressing are used with onion soup mix and the Apricot Chicken has Russian Dressing and Apricot preserves with the onion soup mix.  Both are great recipes. Different taste and just as enjoyable either way.  I adjusted for two servings.  The only comment I have is that as with the Apricot Chicken, I just baked for 20 minutes.  I think an hour would have made the chicken tough.  I also pounded the chicken some for assured tenderness.  It was just right.  It's nice to have these sauces for chicken, especially when using skinless, boneless chicken breast as it can be dry without a sauce.  Thanks again for giving me another standard chicken recipe.

I tried this cranberry chicken recipe for the first time recently and it was awesome. I wasn't sure if my family would like it but they did. The chicken was tender and the cranberries added a twist that was tasty! I used chicken breasts in a fry pan.

When I read this recipe I thought "what a weird combination".  We had it for dinner last night and we loved it! It was super easy to make and looked just like the picture on our dinner plates. I added just a pinch of salt on my serving, but the younger member of our family, who has more taste buds, liked it as is. Will definitely be making this again!

I have been making this chicken for years.  It's a family favorite and I almost always have the ingredients on hand.  Just recently, I have started shredding the chicken in the sauce just before serving (over rice) and it makes a delicious dish even better!

I have to say, I'm a little surprised by all the rave reviews here. This recipe was ok, and it smelled AMAZING and the chicken was very juicy and tender, but the sauce was very thin (almost more like juice!) and way too sweet. Maybe that is because I used leftover homemade cranberry sauce, rather than the canned variety, but I don't think that's it. I'm considering trying again with cream of onion or cream of mushroom soup in place of the onion soup mix, just because I have so much leftover cranberry sauce to play with. Final verdict- edible but disappointing.

I can't say enough good things about this.  This is very tasty and savory.  We ate over rice.  Very easy to make, and a good tasty filling meal.  Next time, I'm going to throw in some frozen veggies.

I sliced my chicken into more of a large chicken "tender" size pieces.  And used leftover walnut orange cranberry relish my mom had made for Thanksgiving instead of the canned one. Put the whole recipe (with french dressing and onion soup mix) in a medium corning ware dish with some water to cover it all.  I baked it for about an hour.  It made a  lot of sauce, but it came out great.

My husband and kids didn't like this a whole lot because of the dried onion soup.  None of them like onions, and these dried onion pieces were just too big.  I thought it was great though!

I thought this was very good and the leftovers even better!  Having read the reviews, I only used the equivalent of one package of onion soup mix (I make my own) and ½ cup homemade Catalina-style salad dressing.  If I had had the time, I would have made and used homemade cranberries, too.  Thanks…I will make this many times, I’m sure.

This has lots of favor. I made it with rice and a spinach salad. One thing I would change is next time I think I will only put 1 onion soup mix and 1/2 cup salad dressing. The flavor was good.I could taste the onions and salad dressing all night, had to take a pepcid and I love onions. Would make it again with less dressing and onions.I did use 3 very large boneless chicken breast instead of 5.

This is a quick dish with good flavor. Excellent when you're short on time and energy on a cold fall or winter night.

I used 6 bone in chicken thighs and removed the skin. There was still plenty of sauce. Like another reviewer, I added orange zest and juice. We enjoyed it and it was easy to prepare, I will definitely make again.

No changes.   I will definitely make this again! Served with wild rice.  Wonderful flavor without disguising the taste of the chicken. Happy cooking!

I have made this recipe several times now. I have changed a couple of things. 
First, I only use 1 package of the dry onion soup mix because, for me, 2 packages is too much onion flavor. 
The other thing I do is marinate the chicken breasts in the mixture for about 3 to 4 hours before baking. I use a glass bake pan and put the chicken and sauce in it to marinate. I've never had a problem with the chicken drying out. 
I love the recipe! It's a hit in my household!

Fabulous, easy meal!  I served it with rice and asparagus to a crowd of 10.  Great hit!  Easy to make, I combined the excess sauce with a corn starch slurry and created a wonderful gravy!  I highly recommend this recipe..DELICIOUS!

This recipe is easy and very tasty! We like it best with dark meat, but it was good on white meat, too.  I made mine in the instant pot, and used a homemade French dressing.  If your chicken has skin on it, take it off, as it will make the dish too greasy.

This is my Go To recipe for dinner parties or romantic dinners!   ( My BF LOVED it when I cooked it for him early on!). So easy AND delicious!   I use Uncle Ben’s long grain and wild rice Original Recipe...not the quick 5 minute one and serve it along with Orange scented green beans.

I used Catalina dressing. I use half a cup instead of a whole cup. I use 1/2 a package of onion soup mix. One can whole cranberry sauce. I mix it together the night before because it becomes thicker. I have made it several times this way because the sauce from the original recipe is too thin and too much onion soup takes away from the cranberry sauce.

Tried this recipe tonight on a quick whim. I had the can of cranberry sauce, 1 pack of onion soup mix but I used plain Greek yogurt in place of a dressing (which I improvise with other recipes esp in place of sour cream) thru some fresh cranberries on top  
Excellent over rice

On one hand, the chicken was very juicy and did smell good in the oven, and it's super easy, the sauce is just.. strange and way too much.

I tried this tonight and unfortunately is was a disaster but that is my fault so thought I would write a review so no one else makes the same mistake.
I live in Hong Kong so it is not always easy to get "American" ingredients.  With that being said I went to the international grocery store that I usually shop at and was so happy to find "French dressing".  To be honest, I am not too familiar with French dressing.. I thought it was odd that it was white french dressing as I always remembered it being a red/ orange color.  I mixed everything together, cooked the chicken and it was less than desirable.  I went online to look up white french dressing and realized that it is very different from french that we have in the USA.  Anyway, just wanted to pass along - DONT USE WHITE FRENCH!  Not the same at all and will completely change the taste. I will try again when I find the "right" french dressing.

This was really good.  I did make a few changes though.   I used a small turkey breast instead of the chicken beast and  I cooked it in my crock pot on low for 7 hours.  Make rice to eat with the sauce too!  Yummy!!

The only things I did different were using the jellied cranberry sauce and only one packet of onion soup mix. It had way too much onion and french dressing flavor and way too little cranberry flavor.

This is the second time I've made this and I used 8 skinless chicken thighs after reading a number of reviews.  There was plenty of sauce and the thighs were very tender and juicy.  Served it with stuffing and it was well received.

well received by my husband. He went for another helping.  My not fussy 11 year old ate it but was not her favorite.  I did add the juice of 1 orange.  I did add both packets of soup mix.  A little less than a cup on french dressing.  I like the sauce consistency the best.  It really thickened up.

Sticky sweet, and not in a pleasant way. It wasn't BAD, but the flavors weren't quite right together. Might have been my fault-- I used dark meat with this recipe instead of white meat. Definitely won't do that again.

I made the cranberry chicken and loved it.  It's even better the following day. We ate this with steamed rice and green salad.

Amazing chicken recipe!!  I used 4 chicken thighs (bone-in) and halved the sauce recipe and it was still more than enough sauce.  I baked at 350, covered, and the chicken was done after about 40-45 min.  We all loved it and ate it with stuffing... it had the flavors of thanksgiving without all the prep work!!  Will definitely make again!

As a newlywed, I'm constantly on the lookout for easy, tasty recipes to make for my new husband. I tried this last night and it's a winner! It goes perfectly with brown rice and veggies {we had butternut squash}.
Definitely going to make this again and share the recipe with friends and family.

We enjoyed this recipe.  I used 1 packet of the onion soup instead of 2.  The chicken was moist.

This sauce was terrible. I made it once exactly as directed and once with only one package of onion soup mix. Both times I couldn't even finish the chicken. My husband who eats literally everything said it was just OK. So disapointed as I LOVE cranberry sauce. :(

Overpowered by the onion soup mix.  Kids liked it but I was done after my first bite.  May try it again with half the onion soup mix.

OMG! This recipe is definitely a keeper. Followed some of the suggestions and cooked in a slow cooker for 3 hrs and used chicken thighs instead of breasts. My husband loved it. Will be using this over and over.

I used 1 pkg ok Knoor dry onion soup mix, my store didn't have Lipton, the cranberry sauce, 3/4 of the bottle of French dressing and I added 1 Tlb of smoked hot paprika and a couple of Tlbs of soy sauce along with some fresh ground pepper. I used 1 large breast split, if I used 5 as the recipe calls for I would have needed more sauce, and baked it in an 8x8 glass pan turning once halfway through. Simple and delicious. Next time I will add a sprig of fresh rosemary and I will also do this with boneless pork chops. The simplicity of this with no chopping or hardly any prep work produced an elegant flavorful serve to guests dinner.  I served it with mashed potatoes and salad all on the same plate

I made this dish for my family. My father is especially picky when it comes to eating chicken. He gave it a well deserved liking. I used all the ingredients, except for the French dressing. I only had Country French dressing with Orange Blossom Honey in the dressing, from Ken's Steakhouse Brand and I used the cranberry sauce instead of the whole berry sauce. This dish is now a favorite for my family. Thank you for the great recipe.

Made this tonight - loved it and my 15 year old picky eater had seconds!   Only had one envelope of soup mix so added dried minced onions and 3 cubes beef bullion, crushed with another 1/2 C of french dressing.  LOVED IT!   This is on the keeper list.

Super simple to make and delicious. I forgot it in the oven for about an extra ten minutes and the chicken was still tender and moist. I'll definitely make this one again!

This is very good.  I have been making chicken with apricot jam, dry onion soup & russian dressing (similiar) but I like the tart ,but not too tart cranberry flavor...don't know why I didn't think of it myself!
Thanks, we will enjoy this again & again..

Excellent recipe. I was skeptical of the ingredients, but it actually came out great. I made this in the slow cooker for 2 hours, and served with sweet mashed potatoes, which I found on Food Network.

This meal tastes like you put on a lot of work but really didn't.  Super tasty! I did this is the slow cooker on low for 5 hours.  While I was a bit worried about the ingredients, all doubts went away when I opened my front door.  I served it over jasmine rice and we did all but lick our plates clean.  This is definitely a great quick and easy meal that is packed full of flavor!!

This is by far one of the easiest and delicious chicken dinners I have ever made.  It is a winner every time and the recipe is always asked for. I do use only 1 pkg. of onion soup mix, 6 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into smaller pieces and 1 cup of Marzetti Honey French dressing.  1 8oz. bottle of Russian dressing is also very good.  I always serve it with rice.

This has been a long time favorite recipe for my family. My mother-in-law gave me this recipe after I returned full time to work because it was such an easy dinner to prepare after a long hard day at work. My children have always loved it and now it is the favorite of my three grandchildren whose mom is my daughter makes this dinner at their request all the time!

I've made this twice, once with boneless chicken and another time with boneless pork chops.  My family actually liked it better with the pork chops.  It's a quick dinner with some mashed potatoes or stuffing, and steamed veggies on the side.  It makes the house smell wonderful while baking.

I had been looking for a cranberry chicken recipe after eating it at someone else's house for dinner.  I didn't especially like the French dressing so next time I plan to substitute something with a little less "tang" like Catalina dressing.  It is an easy recipe though and very good.

I have made this recipe  for many years & everyone loves it!   I use chicken tenderloins which reduces the cooking time.  If you bake uncovered the sauce thickens & takes on a barbecue sauce flavoring!  I always serve it with rice & french green beans. Yum!!

I have been making this recipe for years, only I use chicken pieces. Whenever I have a lot of company (once it was 31 people), I just double the sauce and use more chicken. This also freezes real well.

I personally prefer this made with Russian dressing but Russian dressing for Kraft and other brands are hard to find.  But this is one of my staple recipes to make in a pinch.  I always keep dressing, onion soup mix, and cranberry sauce on hand.

My family and I loved this recipe. I only added 1pkg. of the onion soup mix and it was just as good! I will be making this again. But will be using legs because thats what my family prefers.

I tried this recipe, but didn't have any french salad dressing so I used Ceasar and it was wonderful.

This is so good and so easy.  I used light Catalina dressing instead of French and baked for 40-45 minutes vs. the full hour.  The chicken would have been bone dry if I'd baked the entire hour, but everyone's oven is different.

Very good recipe.  I use 8 ounces of italian dressing instead of  french dressing.  I put it in the crockpot for 6 hours on low.  I use 3 chicken breasts and only 1 package of onion soup mix and one can of whole berry cranberry sauce.  I serve it with white rice and a vegetable.

Our family's favorite! We serve it with a side of mashed potatoes and black eyed peas.

Variation

I use 1lb of chicken and only 1 package on the soup mix. It tastes so good! I use less chicken because I use a lot of sauce on the chicken and I put some on the mashed potatoes too!

I like this recipe.  I browned the chicken on both sides before pouring the sauce on and baking, so it took more like 30 minutes to get done.  Also, I only used one packet of onion soup mix.  Tasted great!

Used leg quarters, as that is what I had on hand. Baked, covered with foil for 45 minutes, uncovered for 30. Very tasty dinner. Everyone enjoyed.

A friend made this for a dinner party and I raved and raved about it for months before she finally told me what it was. I couldn't believe it! How easy and yummy. Its a winner! I used catalina instead of french (all i had) and it turned out great.

I was going to submit this recipe, until I found there were two or three already submitted.  I cook my chicken for five minutes in boiling water, pat dry.  In a large bowl I add ONE envelope onion soup mix, one BOTTLE of french dressing and One can of whole berry cranberry sauce. Bake covered in a 350* oven for an hour.  I serve this during the holidays. I use chicken tenderloin for family, for guests I use chicken breasts with the bone...looks more...fabulous.

I have been making this recipe for 20 years. I have used a whole cut up chicken too. I also cover the pan with foil and bake for 1 hour and uncover and bake for 30 more min. We always serve this with rice. The sauce is great on the rice.

I wasn't really happy with the taste of this one.  It had an odd flavor... just like another reviewer said they couldn't put their finger on it nor could they determine if they liked it or not.  The chicken was juicy.  I was just trying to find something to use up my leftover cranberries.  I'll find something else next time instead.

This is a really nice & sweet recipe for chicken.  Great for a change of pace.  I suggest only using 1 package of onion soup mix, as I did so that it wouldn't be too salty.  It came out great.  A really great alternative to barbeque sauce recipes.

This recipe had way too much onion soup in it.  Coming out of the oven it didn't look appealing at all.  It had an interesting flavor, very different.  I don't know that I'll make this again, if I try I'll definitely revise it to what other reviewers had to say.

I did as the other reviewers mentioned 1 packet onion soup and half french dressing. I would also suggest lining with my new favorite Reynolds release non stick foil. (easy clean up)My husband didn't like the fusion of flavors. I thought the flavors were pretty good so my rating is an average between the 2 of us

Cut back on the onion soup mix but still was all you could taste, cranberry flavor totally lost.  Was ok but probably won't make again.

This was a very tasty recipe and will definately make it again.  I reduced the onion soup mix to one package and used a reduced calorie French dressing.  The combination of flavors had me a little worried but it was a big hit at the dinner table!

It was very easy and quite tasty (even for a college student cooking novice like myself). I left out the onion mix though because onions terrify me, but it still came out well.
