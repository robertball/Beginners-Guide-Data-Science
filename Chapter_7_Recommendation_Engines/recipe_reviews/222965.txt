This was very delicious!  I used chicken broth (homemade) in lieu of white wine since I didn't have any, and I used Serrano peppers from the garden.  Very good and not too heavy.  I topped my and my husband's dishes with the sliced peppers that I removed from the sauce and when combined in a full bite it was really, really good. Thanks for sharing this recipe. :)

Made this for dinner tonight and it was fantastic.  I followed the recipe exactly, up until adding in the pasta.  I added in a bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I did remove the seeds from the jalapenos prior to adding them into the butter/olive oil mixture and I think this kept the hotness to a minimum.  If you remove the seeds you are probably safe to leave the jalapenos in.  I did remove the peppers, but served them alongside the meal and they were gobbled up along with the entire dish.

Will certainly make this again - Matty1124 thanks for the new recipe!

One last dish - this was so easy to make and kitchen clean-up was super easy!

This was great. I didn't have fresh jalapeños, so I used pickled and left them in the whole time.  It gave the dish just the right of heat.  This will likely become one of my regular dishes as it can be made from things that I always have on hand.

I substituted some fresh roasted Hatch green chiles for the jalapeño and added a few pine nuts since they were next to my capers :-)

This was a bit too spicy for my family.   I was ok with the spice.   I believe I am partially to blame for the spiciness.  I didn't have fresh jalapenos, so I used pickled, as another reviewer did and I left them in, not the whole time, but for longer than the recipe called for.   I tasted the sauce and knew it would be too spicy at that point for my family.   I should have removed them as directed, or better yet, I should of had fresh without the seeds.   But even so, just the quantity of the red paper flakes made it a bit too much for my family (not me).   So even taking out the spiciness, capers were a new experience to some in my family and they didn't much care for that flavor either.   Myself, I would make this again and tame down the spiciness a bit, but with that many capers, the rest of the family really won't care for it.   I liked the basic sauce and I can actually learn from my mistakes here and make something my family will like.   I might even get in a few capers, just not too many.

Really good. Nice bite to it. I did add garlic because I kept tasting it as I was cooking and I felt something was missing. Super easy quick recipe

Made this last night; very quick and easy to put together. Used fresh angel pasta, a bit less butter and oil than called for. EXCELLENT—will add to repertoire.

I followed the instructions and took the jalapeños out halfway through.  I didn't have salted butter so added a tsp of salt to the sauce while it simmered.  Next time I would cut the oil to 1/4, but other than that it was amazing and my husband and I devoured it!

Followed recipe and before adding shrimp, I tasted the sauce. The butter flavor was a little over powering. I added a few sun dried tomatoes, minced garlic, and 2 tbls of heavy cream. Flavor was much better. I removed the jalapenos from the sauce. This dish was spicy, but not too spicy that I could not tolerate. The only reason I gave this recipe a 3 was due to lacking any flavor except "heat". Otherwise, if just heat is what you are looking for in a dish, then this would be it!
