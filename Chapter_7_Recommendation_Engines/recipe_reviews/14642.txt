I only had a few items in my pantry and went in search of something I could make with crushed tomatoes and a pot roast... well this recipe made it to the top of the list because it sounded so darned good.  Well, not only did it satisfy the ingredient search, but the tummies of me, my fiance and his hard-to-please-teenager son.  If a 15-year-old asks for you to make it again, you know it was a hit!  So, thanks for this recipe.  I altered this to a crock-pot version, and skipped the corn starch phase.  By making it in the crock pot, it's now a quick and easy meal and it's ready when everyone is back from work.  I also served it more like a pot roast and served it with a side dish of elbow macaroni and used the sauce from the crock pot as it's gravy and then had some hard italian bread and it was totally yummy!

I put a 3.75 pound chuck roast in a slow cooker and cooked it for 2 1/2 hours on high and 2 hours on low.  It was very tender and soooo delicious! I also made spaghetti with the left overs and it was great.  I also took slices of the roast, put them on kaiser rolls, and melted slices of mozzarella in the oven.  Awesome leftovers!  Will be making this again when I have a busy day and will probably cook it for 8 hours on low next time.

Definitely a make-again.   Slicing up the cooked meat and returning it to the pot is key.  I served it with mashed potatoes and veggies instead of noodles.

Made in in my crock pot. Came out a little more liquidy than I would like. Next time I'll be more diligent about the corn starch.

This took way too much time for the outcome. I didn't like it at all and neither did my husband. Wouldn't bother making it again.

Outstanding!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used a large can of tomatoes and I cooked it in the crock pot.  The flavor was really good.  I think the Worcestershire sauce makes it.  I saved the extra sauce to use for spaghetti, and I can't wait to try that.

Excellent just as written.  Next time I may add some diced carrot with the mushrooms.  Whole family enjoyed it, and it's a good choice for cheap beef.

Quite tasty. Served it over egg noodles but felt like it blanded it out too much, might serve it over parmesan polenta next time. The meat was delightfully tender and the meal was quite acidic (hello heartburn), but the flavor was right there.  Threw in extra mushrooms and sliced onion because we like it.  Super filling and makes a bunch!  Made 4.45 pounds since that's what Costco had.  The meat was tough until about the last 1/2 hour, then it really got nice and soft.  Phew!  I was worried for a sec.

This was good, just not great.  I added a can of beef broth for more liquid and some red wine vinegar.  We cooked it in the crock pot for about 8 hours- flipping it about once an hour.  It was falling apart tender, just not a lot of flavor in the meat itself.  I did thicken the juices for a gravy and really had to spice it up with garlic and onion powder, Italian seasoning and cajun seasoning.  we enjoyed it more a few days later with some potatoes simmered with the leftovers and made beefy burritos.

Deish!!! Followed the recipie o a T except I infused the meat with garlic befoe I pan seared it and I used a crock pot.  Meat turned out dry...I cooked it on High in the crock pot for 4 hours and then on low until we ate at 5:00pm. Would love to know the correct amount of time for the crock pot and try again. I never thought a roast in the crockpot could turn out dry.

Very good. My 3 year old loved it and he is a very picky eater. Meat was nice and tender as well. Next time I will use a crock pot though.

I usually make a chuck roast in a dutch oven but use a couple of jars of gravy. This piqued my interest. I'm so glad I tried it. It is sooo good!

I was looking for something different to make with a pot roast.  I found this recipe and it was excellent!  It had so much delicious flavor!  I did use only a 2 lb. roast to the recipe and it was the perfect amount of meat to sauce for us.  I also made my own pizza sauce, using a recipe here on AR called exquisite pizza sauce.  I also used a large sliced onion instead of the mushrooms and doubled the garlic.  I pressure cooked this for a little over an hour, instead of simmering on the stove, and the meat was so tender and full of so much flavor.  I added the water at the beginning to simmer with the sauce, around 3/4 cup, and didn't need the cornstarch at the end, because it was a great thickness after shredding the meat and letting it simmer while the noodles cooked.  I actually didn't prefer it over top of the egg noodles.  So next time I will serve this by itself with some potatoes, pasta, garlic bread, and a salad on the side.  I think this sauce would be excellent with many different meats.  Thank you for the recipe!  I will for sure be making again.

I made this recipe today and we all absolutley loved it!!! I followed the recipe exactly like it was listed except for one thing. After I browned it on all sides I put it in the crockpot on high for 2 1/2 hrs plus a few more minutes.  I put the sauce in a separate skillet and added the cornstarch.....while I did this I sliced the beef and added the mushrooms and beef to the sauce. This meal could not have been better. Thank you for your recipe!!!!

I loved this pot roast.  I made a few changes because I had to and I was very happy with the results .  My grocery store was out of chuck roast, I substituted it with a tri tip roast.  I didn't have dried oregano, so I used italian seasoning instead.  Instead of cooking the roast on top of the stove, I put it the oven at 325 for 2 hours, then finished it on top of the stove after I added the cornstarch and mushrooms.  It was fabulous!  Wouldn't change a thing.

I used this recipe and made changes to it by pan searing the roast with salt, garlic salt and oregano. I then transferred it to a crock pot with red wine and a little chopped garlic. After 4 hours on high I then followed the rest of the recipe and added some more red wine and the water to get to the six cups of liquid then let it continue in the crock pot on high for another 1.5 hours. It turned out really good, the wine made the difference.

We loved this recipe......Would def make again.....
Instead of the water and corn starch we put some tomato paste to thicken it up, it worked really well without changing the flavor much.
We also used pappadelle pasta instead of regular egg noodles.

Excellent! Served it over spaghetti squash. I didn't have any mushrooms but did not miss them. I used 2 egg yolks to thicken instead of corn starch. Probably could have used 3. Husband loved it and said this is the best pot roast ever.

I thought this was awesome.  I double the mushrooms and will look forward to making it again with some bell pepper in there, too.  Great as is but I'm thinking about changing it up a little next time - maybe less liquid and served over rice with lots of peppers. Yum
