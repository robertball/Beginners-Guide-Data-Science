This is not good and I'll tell you why. The banana's in Bananas Foster are suppose to stay somewhat firm and not turn to mush. They shouldn't turn brown. The caramel sauce is really good though, so that alone gets the two stars.

Fantastic!  Hubby and I both loved it and I'll be making it again!  I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the coconut, and it's a must to serve with a little vanilla ice cream.  It really smoothes out the flavor, just irresistable.  I uploaded a photo of mine.  It actually got cooked 1/2 hour or so longer before we got to dig in and was just fine, just remember to stir a little so that it doesn't get stuck on the edges or dried out.  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe was super simple and delicious!  The sauce is just so good.  I did this all in a saute pan over the stove and it was done in a matter of minutes...I only used a dash of rum extract too and it tasted like I remember my parents making when I was little except that they put a flame to theirs!

This was so easy and so delicious.  One of our favorite restaurants serves this and my husband and I both love it.  This was as good as the restaurant version.  Next time I will use a little less Rum extract but, otherwise a wonderful recipe that I know I will be using a lot in the future!

This is an excellent recipe.   I have used it over and over for everything from our family dinner to large parties with multiple bached prepared.  I have never had the banans turn out mushy as described by one reviewer.

I have always made it with rum instead of the extract and a few times have added a dash more rum just before serving to light at the table.

Regarding the bananas turning to mush:  get slightly green bananas....don't get already ripe fruit, it definitely makes a difference.  Just common sense.  Actually, I think it would be better to make the sauce, then add the bananas at the last 15 minutes or so...

The sauce was awesome... how can it not be with butter and brown sugar... but the bananas became hard and rubbery.  Perhaps I needed to use very ripe bananas.  I was thinking the fast and hot cooking of bananas foster in the restaurants maybe makes it soft and sweet.  Maybe the slow cooking didn't get the bananas to that sweet spot.  I would try it again though.

I thought this recipe was great!  I love slow cooker recipes because you just throw it in and leave it alone to do all of the work.   This was easy and delicious...my husband and I ate it all up with Vanilla Ice Cream!  I ate it cold the next day with vanilla ice cream and i actually liked that better because it didn't melt all of the ice cream.  Good one to make again!

I made this tonight. I doubled the ingredients minus the rum (didn't have any) and it turned out really good. My only problem is that it didn't get as thick as I thought it should be. (prob my fault, I only cooked it for 45 minutes bc the bananas started to get soft but i think 2 hours is over doing it..maybe an hr is better) It was great and the entire family loved it! I will make it again!!

Thanks for the terrific recipe, Jerry!  I quickly added the ingredients to my crockpot, and I turned it on Low for an hour or so.  I doubled the recipe to make enough for about 11 at my bunco group last night.  They loved it, and I had some left over to add to butter pecan ice cream tonight.  
This recipe met all my needs:  delicious, easy, and quick!

This was easy and good.  I did use bananas that were not quite ripe - still a bit green.  I used rum extract and a full stick of butter.  I think next time I will use fully ripe- not over ripe- bananas.  They did not brown, and did not mush up like some reviewers.  Yum!

This recipe turned out great. I used a little less brown sugar and a little bit more spiced rum though. I was afraid it might be too sweet but it wasn't. I served it over butter pecan ice cream. The bananas did not get too soft and mushy either.

I love Bananas Foster but I didn't like this.  I'm a firm believer in the fact that some things are just not meant to be prepared in a slow cooker and this is one of those things.  I should have known better.  It's much better if you whip it up on the stove.  The bananas stay as they should and it only takes a few minutes.  I also thought the rum was overpowering.  I also like to add some banana liqueur which my other recipe calls for.  I wouldn't make this again and will stick with the other recipe on this site.  It's much better.

This was fantastic!   We used the leftover the next day over pancakes.  The bananas did get tougher when it was left in the crockpot for too long. Worked out well for us!  Yum!

I can still taste the yumminess...other diners recommended to try to keep the bananas whole (I sliced lengthwise and then once in the middle).  Also, I kept it on 'warm' for an extra 1.5hrs and the bananas seemed to be cooked.  Followed the recipe as prescribed and it's definitely a keeper recipe!

First review I've ever written and it had to be this one. My 13 year old actually threw this together for me as I worked on supper and it turned out amazing. Even my Grandfather (who doesn't like cinnamon at all) ended up eating the leftovers from the crockpot!

The recipe was bitter. I think that without the rum, or even less rum, it could have been a lot better.

I only used half of the rum suggested (1/8 cup) and omitted the coconut, but it turned out PERFECT. Had it with vanilla ice cream and it was delicious. Very easy and will definitely make this again.

This get's 5 stars from me, because it took me all of 7 minutes to put together, and that was with interruptions from a 2 year old! :D I had to share some of the bananas and all was good with the world again. 
Now with the recipe, I used Jamaican Rum, but omitted the coconut and walnuts because of picky eaters. EVERYbody LOVED the syrup this created. My 2 year old kept trying to bring the bowl up to her face to lick the inside. Also, for all of the mom's out there with little one's like me, you will need to clean your table ASAP after this dessert, because it is extremely sticky. :D
Enjoy!

The flavor of this sauce was great, well worth putting it all in a crock pot for 2 hours and having it just be ready on demand. But I have to agree with another reviewer that the bananas became a bit rubbery... not that it wasn't edible, but I don't think you gain much from cooking banana slices for 2 hours, I will definitely add them at the end next time just to warm them up before serving.

The rum flavor really overwhelmed the dish. No one liked it.  I don't know if I will make it again but if I do I will definitely use less rum.

I absolutely love rum but this was way to much, and I even cut it down to 1/8 cp.  I made it for a dinner & no one liked it but my brother so we gave him all of our portions.  The up side is that my bananas never got mushy & it was easy.  But easy isnt always good if your not going to eat it. Doubt if I'll make again.  Prob. just make banana bread next time when I need to use up extra bananas.

I followed this recipe exactly, except that I omitted the coconut since I was serving it to someone who doesn't like coconut.  It turned out great, and I'm sure it would have been good with the coconut as well.

I made this for a Christmas dessert (not sure how it would turn out) & the whole (adult) family loved it!! I used some Cuban Rum, well a little more then the called for 1/4 cup & there was barely any leftovers ... guess I'll be making this again! :)

It smelled amazing but the taste was not good.  I think the coconut and nuts just killed it.  Maybe w/o would possibly be better.

I made this recipe for my bunco group last night and it came out great!  Being able to do it in the slow cooker was perfect as I could start it early and by the time we were ready for dessert, it was done and I didn't have to take too much time out of the game... just long enough to dish up some ice cream and top it with the bananas!

This was great tasting and easy to prepare.  I used it for a jungle themed party. (curious george).  My family wants it again.

This was not a hit at my house.  Most of it went down the drain....Sorry!  Maybe I didn't do something right..who knows..but I will not make this again.
