These were pretty tasty! It's true that the wine and cheeses really make a difference! I would probably use a bit less bread crumbs next time (personal preference texture-wise), but otherwise the seasonings are spot on. I served the meatballs over mashed potatoes, but normally I'd eat them with zucchini noodles. You could even freeze half the mixture for later use. I do have to note that using 3 bowls is unnecessary. I just threw all the ingredients into my Kitchenaid bowl and mixed together. Also, the bottoms were getting overly browned after 15 mins, so I took them out of the oven and let them finish cooking (although they were likely done) in the sauce. Thanks for a healthier meatball option!
