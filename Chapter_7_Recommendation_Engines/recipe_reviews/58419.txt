This dish is very good. I am not a seasoned cook so the prep time took longer than anticipated.  Also, I got the wrong type of tomatoes so had to add Contadina tomato paste.  It turned out okay but would have been delicious had I found plum tomatoes!

This was amazing, everyone loved it. The sauce was so good, only drawback is there isn't very much of it so I added a little extra spagetti sauce to it to make it last longer.

I enjoyed this recipe. It had a nice flavor, my only complaint is that it seemed to be a bit greasy because I kept adding more olive oil to the peppers and onions to they wouldn't burn - next time I may add chicken broth to cut down on the oil and have more of a saucy texture - this didn't really have enough liquid.  I will make again with just a couple alterations though!

This is a healthy and delicious way to eat those "good for ya" boneless, skinless chicken breasts (can be dry, right?).  Try this tossed with, or served over, brown rice (works with just-cooked or leftover rice).

Mmmmm! I already made a version of this on my own, except without the chicken. I liked it with chicken. The only change that I made was I added a can of Italian tomatoes for extra juice. Good!

Odd one out, but we didn't really care for this. Which is surprising, because like all the ingredients. The only changes were yellow onion instead of red, Italian seasoning for the herbs (made my own blend and was out of the individuals), only had bone-in chicken so I seasoned-roasted-shredded prior to making everything else then tossed it in to heat through, only 4 tomatoes, used the optional mushrooms and added a half cup of white wine instead of more EVOO. Mind you we only had orzo to work with as a pasta, but I doubt that affected the outcome. Too bad because it's alot of prep work dicing everything up.

The only modification I made to this recipe was to add about a 1/2 cup of chicken broth to the veggies to help soften them and add some flavor while they sauteed. It also helped the sauce go further in the end. I am not a fan of green peppers at all- even in canned sauces with GP added it gives the sauce a funky flavor in my opinion, so I was worried with this recipe. I left them in for my husband and I can honestly say I wouldn't have even known if I hadn't made it. All of these ingredients combine wonderfully to make a really well rounded sauce! This recipe is great and wasn't too hard to make at all! Next time I'm going to experiment with getting more flavor into the chicken...

It took quite a bit longer than the recipe said it would, but once it was done, it was pretty good.  I saved some in the fridge for lunch the next day, and it was actually better the next day than it was that night for some reason.  It was a little bland at first but I seasoned it with some tony chacherie's and it was quite delicious!!

This was a really tasty recipe! I would have given it 5 stars if the sauce had a more even consistency. My fiancé doesn't love tomatoes even though he loves tomato sauce, so I had to give him the more watery bits. The actual flavor was great though, and it had a nice little kick to it. I added lots of spinach!

Ketchup? I thought it sounded strange, but it worked.  I took an extra step and blanched and peeled the tomatoes first. I used whole wheat pasta, and it worked very nicely with the sauce and veggies. Very tasty!

Great camping dish.  I omitted the mushrooms (as I personally don't like them) and used a scallion instead of red onion as it is what I had.  Still great and a good change from normal camp food.  You could easily put leftover carrots or other leftovers in here as well to change it up.

I was disappointed this didn't have much flavor. Maybe I didn't use enough garlic powder- I didn't have cloves. I had to double the Parmesan to get it to taste like anything. The tomato and chicken mixture was really dry so I had to add more ketchup and olive oil. Won't make it again.

Hubby not a fan of red peppers. I've used yellow before.  In this pic so I added spinach, pine nuts , a few dashes red pepper flakes.  I've also used sautéed asparagus for a green additive

Easy, quick, tasty family meal. I made the recipe as is written. The sauce is flexible and many different vegetables work with this dish. I will have fun and experiment using some different herbs for the sauce next time. It will be a great summer recipe when there are a lot of fresh produce and fresh herbs in season. It is easy to make this recipe gluten free, also, by simply using gluten free pasta. My family very much enjoyed this meal.

Excellent dish! A bit complicated for a novice cook like myself  but not so much so that it was stressful. My wife and I very much enjoyed it but my kids were less than impressed. I will definitely be making this again... just probably on a night the kids are at Grandma and grandpa's house. I did make a couple of changes. Not a fan of bell peppers in general so I roasted two red peppers and sliced them into strips.  Also my local grocery store does not carry spaghettini. I used whole wheat Linguine instead.

Great flavor.  I followed the recipe except I didn't have mushrooms. The only negative is that it was a bit dry. I will make this again.

This is a very tasty and easy to prepare dish!  I didn't think there was enough sauce, so I made more with canned diced tomatoes that I had on hand.  I used less garlic only because hubby isn't big on garlic.  This is a recipe that you can season to your own likeness.  It's a keeper for me!

I have made this twice and have found that if you want to maximize flavor, try the following substitutes: Farmer's market heirloom tomatoes instead of grocery store romas. Sweet onion instead of red onion. Cappellini or angelhair noodles (because they're thiner) instead of spaghettini or vermicelli noodles.

Pretty tasty and light dish, I would make it again.
