I reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp and used salted butter. I warmed the water to 110 degrees before adding 4 tsp of bread machine yeast. I used 2c bread flour and 2c all-purpose flour. My KitchenAid mixer with dough hook attachment was used to knead the dough 4 minutes on the lowest setting (stir). The recipe made 36 oz of dough I divided into 20 portions, 1.8oz each, that I flattened into 3" x 3" squares and wrapped around 1.5" lengths of fully cooked chicken breakfast sausage and 0.2oz of shredded cheddar cheese. The dough wrapped sausages were then placed seam side down and evenly spaced on a parchment lined baking sheet, left to rest for 30 minutes, then baked at 350 degrees for 15 minutes.
