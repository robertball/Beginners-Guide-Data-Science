This soup is really, really tasty! Made mostly as written, except I used the whole can of unsweetened coconut milk. Did not add extra salt. I also added tofu to pump up the protein. Yummy!

This soup is soooo yummy. Easy to make and fast. The only change I made was increasing the curry for a little more punch. Family loves this healthy soup.

I had a curry “blend” spice that I used for all the spices.

Made it according to the recipe. Used "Better than Bouillon" vegetable stock. Turned out delicious.

First time, followed the recipe as written and it was pretty good.  Second time, added more salt than the first time, about 1.5 tsp, and used coconut drink from a carton instead of canned coconut milk.  Also, added a little more curry powder and it was fabulous.  Both times, used low sodium vegetable broth.
