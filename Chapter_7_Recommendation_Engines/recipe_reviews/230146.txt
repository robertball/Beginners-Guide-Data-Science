Easy... SO easy! And delicious! I'll be making again for my friends! Everyone who tried gave it 10 stars! 
I was thinking it would also be really cool to layer the ingridents in a canning jar and attaching a bottle or two of rum with a ribbon. :)

This was the first time I had made or tasted rumballs. They were really delicious and very easy to make. I would suggest leaving them in the fridge for at least 24 hours though or even better 48 hours.
