This is similar to Minestra, a dish I grew up with, so I thought I'd give it a try. I used lamb & my only complaint was that the orzo was overcooked at 50 minutes. I cannot imagine how cubed chicken could be cooked for 2 hours without drying out.

Made it with chicken, not lamb.   It was very bland.

This was so easy to make yet flavorful. I went with the submitters suggestion and used chicken. I added red pepper flakes and topped with green onions.
