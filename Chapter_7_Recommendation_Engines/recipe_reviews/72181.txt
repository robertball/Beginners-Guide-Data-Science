My mouth is still burning from the "heat" of this recipe..but I could not stop eating it!  I used imitation crabmeat and definitely wasn't a pound, so that is probably why it was so spicy.  I ended up doubling the sour cream and mayo to tone down the flavor.  Next time I will halve the cayenne pepper, and go from there.  What a great taste, though.  Can't wait to serve to our friends.  Thanks, HEP303!

My husband and I found this recipe to have a  light lemony flavor followed by a bit of spicy, which we love. Pulling the meat out of the fresh cooked crab took most of the prep time otherwise it came together quite quickly. We served it with vegatable crackers. It was enjoyed by all.

The lemon zest and fresh lemon juice make this salad sing out loud. The dill adds an interesting twist, and the cayenne pepper, a very pleasing zip. My only suggestion is for those that don't like a dry mixture. As written, this recipe comes out rather dry. Those that like more moisture in the mix should add more of the wet ingredients. I've had many crab salads through the years and this is one of the most tasty and interesting.

Used to stuff avocados.  Yummy!  Way better than regular crab salad.

This was the first time that I made this recipe, and it was for a Mother-Daughter salad luncheon at my church. I made it a day before I needed the salad so that the flavors would all have a change to blend together. I had to add an additional tablesppon each of the sour cream and mayonnaise because the salad wasn't moist enough for my liking. Instead of the one pound of shredded crab I used two pouches of imitation crab meat, 7 ounces in each pouch. I minced the meat in my food processor so that I could easily transfer a small amount of the salad into individual phyllo mini-tart shells, using the bigger scoop of my melon baller. I placed these little tarts on white paper doilies on top of a cobalt blue tray and it was a lovely plate for the table. I'm figuring it was a success because there was not one single piece leftover to bring back home!

I left out the sour cream, relish, parsley, cayenne pepper, paprika and lemon zest.  I added garlic powder, and emeril's bayou blast, and cheddar cheese into the crab salad...absolutely delish when I used it on top of some toast

This recipe was just ok for me. I used fresh crabmeat and it just seemed dry.  I tried adding more mayo and sour cream, but then it took away from the flavors. If I made it again, I would definitely have to play with the ingredients a little.

I served this on a bed of lettuce with some red bell pepper and peas.  My boyfriend doesn't really like crab, but couldn't stop raving about this salad.

I stopped adding crab to the sauce mix when it seemed like it was going to get too dry...and I ended up only using about 1/2 pound.  Next time I would cut the dill and cayenne in half since they stood out and detracted, a bit, from the overall flavor.  We really liked the recipe, it just needs a bit of tweaking.

This was pretty good, but I'm still searching for my perfect crab salad recipe.  One thing I did really like was that the amount of dressing was light compared to the amount of crab as I like to be able to taste the crab itself and not all dressing.

Very good on crackers and rye toast. I had no parsley or lemon so I used lime instead. It was still very good.
thanks

This was really good! We used it on sandwiches, but we also ate some plain. I really liked it, but I think if I made it again I would eliminate the relish from the recipe. Personal preference.

This was delicious.  I accidentally used dill pickle relish, other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  It was a hit!  No leftovers.

I made this for a cookout. Last minute brainstorm so I didn't get to let it refrigerate overnight to let the flavors settle in. No matter. It was a huge hit! I doubled the sour cream, mayo and lemon juice and omitted the relish.  I also added Old Bay and celery. We ate it with crackers and on split top hot dog buns as crab roll. Really really good!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

We used fake crab.  We both thought it was very good.  I especially like it because there is no pasta in it to give it additional calories.  Very diet friendly.  I felt the spices were just right.  We stuffed it in a tomato.

Left out the parsley, sweet pickle relish, lemon juice and lemon zest. Added a little rice wine vinegar, salt, sugar, a little garlic powder. It was PERFECT!
