I've never made parsnips before- this was a first for me.  I sliced them the long way, which was a pain, but they're attractive that way and cook quickly, so it was alright.  I seasoned the parsnips with salt and pepper, did NOT boil them first, did NOT add flour either, and dropped them into a butter/olive oil mixture (I didn't want the butter to burn).

They really came out delicious- tender, tasty, and my family loved them (even my dad, and he doesn't like anything unless it's a potato).  I'd definitely make these again.

I grew up loving parsnips cooked this way by a beloved grandmother.   She didnot coat them, just sauted them slowly in the butter.  Yummy  but an aquired taste, I feel.

Proof you just can't go wrong frying something in butter!  This was outstanding, and my husband and I aren't huge parsnip fans.  We've been trying to eat local foods in season, and all winter I avoided parsnips except mixed in with lots of other veggies to the point where you can't even taste them.  Finally, I saw what is probably the very last parsnips of the season, and I decided that I had to stop being a wimp and give it a go.  And boy am I glad I did.  Even one of my 2 year old twins ate this up, which felt like a small miracle.  My only problem now is that I'm going to have to wait until next winter to eat this again.  Well, I guess it's good to have things to  look forward to in the winter!  Thanks for the delightful recipe!

I remembered my Grandmother/Mother making something for me when I was little that I could not put my finger on.  After trying a parsnip after many many years it all came together.  This is exacly how they used to make them, only I don't think they boiled them or floured them.  I just fried them in butter/olive oil with salt & pepper and it was exactly what I have been searching for all of these years.  Thanks for sharing!

I loovvved them. Probably not the healthiest way to eat veggies, ... but who cares! I left off the flour, cause I semi-low carbing. Brought me back to my childhood when Grandma used to make 'em. Thanks!

Probably not the healthiest way to eat parsnips - but by far the best I have ever tasted.  Makes me want to try it with turnips or rutabaga.

Every since we had fried parsnips at NOLA in New Orleans we have been in love with that dish. This is not quite as good but a good substitute to make at home. Thanks.

Very tasty way to make Parsnips. My husband picked some up from a local market and we weren't quite sure what to do with them. Instead of the 1/2 cup of butter I used some olive oil mixed with a bit of garlic butter and that worked great! Very yummy and the hubby loved it.

I really didn't like this at all.  Even if you enjoy the taste of parsnip, cutting it lengthwise really makes it quite tough and stringy.  Will not be making again.

My Mother and Grandmother browned boiled parsnips in bacon grease (not much healthier than butter - but more flavor).  Loved them as a child and still like them at least once a year.

Tasted great and I really enjoyed them. I added pepper and extra salt but next time might add some paprika to give a little extra kick.

Parsnips have never been a favorite veggie for me, BUT....This IS the way to serve them!  So good, and the parsnip taste was subtle.  My children liked them, who are 4 and 5.  This recipe would impress your guests at Thanksgiving.  What a nice change from the usual mashed veggies served during holidays!

Very Yummy!  Double the Flour and Seasoned Salt amount + add 1/2 tsp of black pepper for more flavor!  This might cook better in a mini fryer as it leaves your frying pan a gross mess with the flour/butter build up!

I've now made this twice.  The first time I did as the recipe states and it came out too mushy.  This time I boiled the parsnips only five minutes instead of ten and the pieces were more firm. This is a very tasty dish just don't over boil them first before the butter sautéing.

This recipe brings me back to my childhood. My Dad would cover a mound of parsnips with straw and soil to store them over the winter. In late winter or early spring he would break into the cache and prepare them this way, well maybe a little more butter. The nuttiness of this root vegetable is delicious!

Wow, it felt like I just licked a stick of butter that had a slight parsnip taste. I was going to modify the recipe because it sounded like a bad idea to begin with, but cooked as the instructions say. My wife said they were alright, but I've never heard her say she didn't enjoy something. I'll find another use for parsnips in the future.

I've not had parsnip before, but I've decided I don't like the taste of it.  I think the recipe is good and will like to try with another veg.  but parsnip isn't for me.

They were tasty.  The only thing is I precooked them too long so they were very soft.  I was hoping for more of a crispy parsnip.

Probably the best parsnip recipe I've ever had.  Used to eat them mashed as a child and forgot all about them until recently - these were absolutely wonderful, very creamy and just the right amount of seasoning to bring out the flavor of the parsnip.  Yummy!!!
