I love it when people change a whole recipe, including ingredients, and then give it three lousy stars.  Sheesh, if you're going to do that, send in your own recipe!

As written I have to give this recipe 3 stars. I liked the basic idea, but I had to change the ingredients.  First of all, I used fresh corn, cooked and cut off the cob.  I used frozen peas instead of canned because....Yuck!  Canned peas are icky. I used grape tomatoes, cut in half instead of large tomatoes to cut down on the liquid, and seeded the cucumber for the same reason.  I also made a vinaigrette instead of mayonnaise.  My husband said he didn't think he would like a corn salad, but he really liked this one.  Although I made several changes, I thank you for the recipe!

This is a fast salad that is great as a side dish. I have served it twice now, followed the recipe exactly and both times it was a hit. Everyone went home asking for the recipe.

A good way to get your veggies. I used frozen corn and peas instead of canned. I substituted scallions for onion and orange bell pepper for pimentos.

I had a corn salad from a small town grocery store deli several years ago that was so delicious, but have never found it anywhere else or was able to recreate it.  When I found this recipe, I thought I'd give it a try and let me tell you, this is it!  The only change I made was leaving out the peas as the salad I had didn't have them and I don't care for them.  Delicious!  You have to try this, it is perfect for summer and so easy to make.

This was delicious and a perfect substitute for a lettuce salad. I used Green Giant Steam Crisp Super Sweet White Corn (11 oz.), Green Giant Steam Crisp Super Sweet Yellow and White (11 oz.), Le Sueur Very Young Small Sweet Peas, a small jar of pimientos, the 2 tomatoes, and cucumber and green onion to our taste preference. I used only 1/4 cup light mayonnaise, which was perfect for this amount of vegetables. It makes a lot!

This is such a fun change from lettuce salads.  I served it to guests who at first didn't know what to make of it...peas and corn?  For this reason, I'd suggest making the servings small, like in a lettuce cup.  Not exactly rave reviews, but everyone liked it fine, and it's pretty filling.    I make it for myself on occasion, but I only use frozen corn and peas, then microwave them to just thaw out, never cook them.  They are a lot sweeter that way.  I also used fresh red bell pepper and no cucumbers (my husband is allergic).  This is an easy recipe to change to suit your tastes.  The point is to keep it simple. Thanks Kim, for this great idea!

Left out the pomento's. It was awsome! I served it as a dip with tortilla chips. Everyone liked it! Especially those that dont care for tomato base salsas.

This is excellent! I scaled it X3 for 40 servings (but just used one can of peas).  Got lots of compliments on it. I wil definately make it again.

Great recipe with a little tweaking.  I don't understand why anyone gets upset when people add their own touches.  This is the reason I read the recipes.  I am always glad to hear how others make it their own way.

Fantastic! My only complaint is that the amount of mayo is a bit much.. It was really liquidy, but other than that, my whole family loved it! Great summertime dish

I'm with you, people change your recipe and then give you 3 stars, changed from a fat based sauce to a vinegar base, it's not even close to your recipe.

 I made it EXACTLY ! Like you listed, it was very good, fresh and very pleasing on a hot day, plates up nice too. I may add a few green onions next time and reduce the purple onion, just cause I love green onions. But your recipe was perfect! Thank you.  

If you like Shrimp, try my "Kevin's Seashells" listed on this site, let me know what you think, but if anything please use Fresh Shrimp, caught in the USA, not canned shrimp, ( I can't believe they even make canned shrimp) Ewww!  I live on the Gulf Of Mexico, so one throw of the net and I have fresh live shrimp.

This was okay, but I didn't love it.  It seemed to be similar to a corn salsa, but then mayo was added and it seemed a little odd, but it tasted okay.

Love this recipe. I've made it probably about a dozen times now and have had several people ask for the recipe. Super easy to make and scale up if needed. The ONLY change I make is I halve the mayo and replace that with miracle whip and it's perfect

Made this for a side dish - - my family loved it.  I loved it because it was so easy!!!  I substituted the mayo for the fat free mayo, and I don't think anyone noticed.  I'll be keeping this one on hand for a quick summer side dish!

I made a couple adjustments and it was great!  1) used 1/2 red onion (tossed it with salt in a colander then drained excess liquid before mixing into other ingredients); and 2) used blanched shelled edamame (soy beans) increased of canned peas.  The edamame made it bright and had great texture.  Oh and I used light mayo instead and added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.

I made this for a cookout that I went to, and it went over really good.  I really love it and will have it again. Unfortunately DH didn't care for it.  I used frozen corn & peas though.  Because I was worried about about mayonnaise I made and oil & vinegar dressing instead - per one other review.  I used a drizzle of sesame oil and 1/4c vegetable oil.  I also used 2tbsp balsamic vinegar, then added a drizzle more - so maybe more like 3tbsp?  I also added sesame seasoning mix along with the salt and pepper.  I also cubed up a block of sharp cheddar cheese to mix in - that went so well with everything else. My MIL really loved this.

It was a very good salad. I used fresh corn instead of canned and added Mrs.Dash Spicey jalapeno seasoning since I like things with a kick. Everyone loved it!!!! Maybe next time I'll toss in some shrimp!

Other than using frozen corn and peas I made this recipe as written. I am not a big fan of canned peas. I thought that it is a great tasting recipe. Everyone that had tried it loved it so I made it for my barbecue again tonight. I know I will get great reviews for it. Thanx for the recipe.

I had 11 ounce cans of corn so I used 3 cans. 2 peaches and cream and 1 yellow . I also used frozen peas cooked a bit and then cooled rather than canned which I don't like. I didn't use the entire onion as I felt it was too much onion and I was right. I cut up finely about 1/4 cup purple onion and used cherry tomatoes cut in half. I wanted a smaller salad so I kept some corn and peas out but used the as directed amount of everything else. It was delicious and the next day I added the extra peas and corn and put in a bit more mayo to stretch it. This is such a different salad and makes a lot. It will be going to my next potluck. Try it you won't be sorry.

I LOVE it!  My whole family does.  This is one of the best and easiest summer dishes I have ever had.  It's like eating so many layers of deliciousness at once!

This is a nice change from the typical vinegarette corn salad. I didn't have pimntos so used some diced green pepper. Celery would be a nice addition as well. As others have suggested- remove the seeds from the tomatoes and cucumber, and blot with paper towel to prevent the salad from getting runny. And chop just enough purple onion to suit your taste as a whole one would be way too much.  I'm watchful of calories so used Hellman's Light Mayo and it worked great. I used frozen peas which added additional crispness.

I thought this was perfect for a hot summer day.  Needed something to take to a fish fry and this was light, refreshing and a perfect side.  I used frozen peas and corn instead of canned but everything else was the same as the recipe.  I made it in less than 10 minutes and out the door it went to the fish fry.  Because the veggies were frozen by the time they got there to be served they had thawed the right amount and were still super cold which made it perfect.  When my grandma was alive she used to make something like this many, many years ago and I am so glad I found the recipe.  It will be made often.  Next time I make it I may cut down on some of the onion because it really did pop and I think a little less would tone it down a bit.  Thank you!!!

This was delicious!  Took it to a girls' night out party and it got rave reviews.  The only thing I changed was to add about 1/4 cup ranch dressing mix and about 1/4 cup sugar. I'm from the South so everything is better with a little sugar.  Will definitely be making this again.

Oh heck yeah! I get so tired of the same ole/same ole cool summer dishes (think slaw, potato salad, etc.) This was quick, easy and super yummy. The only change I made was using frozen peas instead of canned. I might add some pasta shells when I need a little more substance, but this was great as is. Also a great "leftover" veggies dish. You could easily add that last stalk of celery, artichoke heart, sweet pepper. I'm already thinking about throwing in some pico de gallo for an easy side dish for fish tacos...

plan on making this for Thanksgiving!  Easy recipe, things have on hand, and not a lot of things the kids won't eat.  Will rate after we've eaten.  Thanks for sharing with us.  Oops, says I have to rate before can comment so will go on and give it a 5 just based on reasons given.

I liked it a lot, but would definitely recommend using fresh corn. The crunch makes it so much better!
