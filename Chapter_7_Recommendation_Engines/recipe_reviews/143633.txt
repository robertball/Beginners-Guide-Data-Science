My family has made this "summer" favorite for years, but I haven't seen it made with alternative sugar product.  This is a wonderful salad to take on a picnic or other outside meal, as there is no mayo, and it is partially "pickled", as it were!  Best made at least one day ahead!

I used 1 cup sugar instead of splenda because I don't have splenda in the house. I also added 1 teaspoon mustard and 1 teaspoon worcestershire for some extra flavor

I have made this using canned carrots instead of fresh and works great and saves lots of time! Very good!

My Grandmother made this recipe for Thanksgiving recently & I fell in love with it! I didn't have white vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar which I did have.  Likewise,  I didn't have tomato soup so I mixed V8 juice & tomato paste (to the same consistency of condensed soup. )  Just as delicious!
