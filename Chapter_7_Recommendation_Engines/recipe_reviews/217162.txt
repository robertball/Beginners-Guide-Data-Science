Mmm mmm good. I didn't have the pimentos but I did have a can of red kidney beans so I used that instead. I also added 2 finely chopped garlic cloves along with 1/2 a tsp of sugar and this came out really good. To me this is a 5 star keeper. Thanks for sharing.

This was good but not amazing. I will probably make again sometime when I want something easy.

I used veggie crumbles instead of beef and salsa instead of tomato sauce but these were very good! They were somewhat like mini pizzas.

My whole family really enjoyed these the only change I made was to substitute red bell pepper for the pimento because I didn't have any on hand. I will happily make these again thanks for sharing!

I used dark rye bread instead of buns (4 large slices cut into 1/2's). The guys really seemed to love it as a football watching snack!

I have made and reviewed this before but having made it again I would say again how good it is. This time I made it like a French bread pizza and when almost done I put some extra shredded cheese on top and turned on the broiler to melt it. Don't walk away.
