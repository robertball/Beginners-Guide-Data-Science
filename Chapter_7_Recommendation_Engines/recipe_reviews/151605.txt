This was pretty good.  I made it with frozen mixed veggies (carrots, corn, peas, string beans) instead of broccoli and cauliflower, tasted much better that way.  Didn't use as much water and milk. I made mashed potatoes according to package directions along with 1/2 can of the soup.  Also sauteed 1/2 an onion along with the ground beef for added flavor and melted a sprinkle of shredded cheddar over the top right at the end. Also, be sure to season your ground beef with salt, pepper, and garlic powder while cooking so the base of your bake doesn't taste bland.

So the key to making this yummy is simple, make your own homemade Cream of Mushroom soup, add whatever veggies you want straight to the ground beef and cook them all up together good, add onions, use real mashed taters, make too much so that you have to use a 9x13 pan... bake it for 10 min add cheese and bake for another 7 and you come up with yumminess! :D

This turned out better than what I thought it would.  There didn't seem to be enough potato for the soup mixture, but the potato/soup did give the dish a nice sauce.  Will make again, but probably with more potato, and more seasoning.

I came upon this recipe from searching for ingredients I needed to use up.  Normally I don't like to use canned soups, but I thought I'd give this one a try.  I added onion and garlic to the beef and flavored it with Lawry's salt, Mrs. Dash garlic and herb seasoning, black pepper and hot sauce.  I microwaved some fresh broccoli and used that instead of the mixed veg bag, but I bet lots of different veggies would be great.  I made homemade mashed potatoes but missed the instructions that called for using half the soup can in the meat and the other in the potatoes, so I put all in the meat - glad I did since the meat would have been drier had I followed the instructions. Used an 11 inch square stoneware baking pan and was just the right size.  I added some cheddar over the meat/under the potatoes and baked the dish covered.  It turned out really well!  Real stick-in-the-ribs-meat-n-potato casserole.  The cheese really wasn't necessary since the dish is so rich (but I liked it anyway).  If this makes 4 servings, they are very large servings!

I was not very impressed with this recipe as there was way too much liquid, two cups of water was not necessary. You couldn't "scoop"the potato mixture, it was more like potato soup.

Good base, but needs some work
I used ground turkey(20 oz), it was what I had. I followed other reviewer suggestions and used frozen mixed veggies (carrots, peas, corn, and green beans). I also,made my own mashed potatoes (leftovers would work awesome). I sauted an onion with the turkey and added salt. Pepper, and garlic powder to taste. I added the veggies, the whole can of cream of mushroom soup (again,what I. Had), 1/3 can water and the worchestershire sauce and cooked about 5 minutes more, med heat. Then I topped it with my mashed potatoes. Baked for 30 mins on 350* and tipped with cheddar cheese for last 10 min. It came out sooo good,  hit the spot on a cold washington day!,thanks to all the other reviewers :)

This was good, I used real mashed potatoes and since I only had regular mushroom soup, I added a clove of garlic to the meat when it was cooking.  I steamed the vegetables first and I also added an onion and s&p.  The kids loved it!

When I made this it was quite runny.  Maybe less water and it would have been ok.

As an unexperienced cook-This would had been good-if it was specified to make mashed potatoes before you start mixing everything. I followed the recipe and it was quite runny and was more like soup.

EXCELLENT casserole!  I layered mine with cheddar cheese on top of the meat mixture and on top of fresh mashed potatoes. (instead of the instant kind.)   I also roasted some fresh jalepeno chilis and sliced them to lay them on top of the last layer of cheese after the casserole was completly finished baking. Absalutely great! "go to" food for left overs!

We thought this was pretty good...I made it with "real" mashed potatoes and I wish I had made more (I was afraid to make too much).  Next time I will use more and also us some seasoning on the meat mixture or maybe add garlic.  It just needed a little something.

This was pretty good. I couldn't find mushroom and garlic soup so I added a teaspoon of garlic powder to the beef. I didn't have Idahoan potatoes so I just followed the directions on the box of instant garlic mashed potatoes that I had. Next time I will only use one cup of vegetables. I took another reviewer's advice and sprinkled a layer of shredded monterey jack cheese in between the meat and potatoes.

The other raters were RIGHT! THis was soupy...I didn't add all the liquid noted in the recipe and it was still soupy going on, but was gone by the end of baking (I baked it a bit longer than suggested). 
Overall, this was good, but we think it could use a bit more flaver - perhaps in the potatoes (I made mine homemade). I think - my theory - is that the soup was rather diluted because of all the liquid..I would do less lliquid and more soup! Or, I would have used instant - flavored - mashed potatoes.
On a side note - i used ground turkey and browned it with some garlic!

I have this recipe in a Campbell's cookbook and have always loved it. I was surprised at the reviews saying it was too watery.  The cookbook version doesn't call for individual potato ingredients, only 3 cups hot mashed potatoes.  I do think it needs more potatoes as the covering is a bit skimpy in my opinion. I do season the meat as it's cooking as well with standard hamburger seasonsins...garlic, onion, seasoned salt. It continues to be a winner in our house.

So after reading some of the negative comments on this one I figured I would help it out and make it my first review. Even though both my wife and I felt that is was "missing something," (more on that in a second) I actually loved this recipe. It is what it claims to be.. a hearty baked meat-n-taters dish. I am not a pro-chef, I'm a stay at home dad and I'm not afraid to admit I use canned soup. For my time and money it's a great way to add flavor and creaminess. I was out of 'shroom so I used celery... (too bland, use the mushroom.)  Unlike other reviewers, I had no consistency issues with this one either. Everything was just as moist or dry as it was supposed to be. I added a few cloves of garlic, some chopped onion and a good helping of s&p to the ground beef. The veggies were a bag of frozen "California mix" (thawed in the microwave) as called for, which was a good mix for this recipe. Overall I will modify it a little to add some more zip next time, but I will be making it again.

This was pretty good and my family enjoyed it!  I will be saving this recipe for the future.  I like how it contained ingredients that I normally have on hand.  I read the other reviews before I made this recipe and a lot of people were saying the potatoes were too runny and watery.  So I made my own mashed potatoes (instead of the instant ones) and it turned out good.  I also steamed my frozen veggies first (instead of just thawing them).  And I also seasoned the beef when I was browning it with salt, pepper, garlic powder and season salt.

This was very good. Most of my children went back for seconds. My husband did, too. I used real mashed potatoes and cooked my beef with garlic. When it was almost done I added mushrooms and carrots to sauté in the grease. I made my own cream of beef soup by mixing 2 1/2 cups cold milk with 4 Tb of cornstarch and 3 tsp beef bouillon. When the vegetables were cooked, I added frozen peas and the milk mixture and cooked until thickened. Putting it in a 13x9 dish, I topped the meat with the hot potatoes, sprinkled cheese on top, and broiled it in the oven until the cheese was melted - 1-2 minutes. Since everything went into the dish hot, I didn't have to bake it. Yummy!

My husband really loved this simple recipe. It was quick and easy to make. I used extra lean ground beef.  When I sautéed the meat, I first sautéed about 1/4 of a small onion and 3 small gloves of garlic.  I also used low fat Cream of Mushroom soup.  For the potatoes, I simply follow the recipe on the box for 2 cups of flakes and added the 2nd half of the can of soup to the completed potatoes. Lastly, I used a total of 16 oz of frozen corn, peas, and freshly steamed broccoli.  It was tasty and easy.  We will make it again.

This "version" of Shepherd's pie, is actually a version of COTTAGE pie. Any one who cooks aught to know that if you use beef it is cottage, if you use lamb/sheep it is shepherd's. Also, not a fan of anything that uses canned soup, including... canned soup. Yuck.
