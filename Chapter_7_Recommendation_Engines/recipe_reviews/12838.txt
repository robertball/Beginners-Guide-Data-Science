I made lots of changes to this recipe.
I didn't use the microwave, and eliminated the green onions and cayenne, though they'd be fabulous.

I used baby bella mushrooms- about a cup and used roughly 4 tbs butter in a saucepan, and sauted two garlic cloves, the mushrooms and 1/4 cup of onions in it.  Then I added 1/2 cup of sherry.  Let that simmer and then added the shrimp.  I cooked the shrimp for a couple minutes, removed it, and then added about 1/4 cup of flower and 1/2cup of milk. I think next time I cook it I'll used cornstarch instead. I had to add a bit of salt but it was very tasty.  I also served it over instant rice.

This recipe was a waste of two lbs. of shrimp. I doubled it and it was awful. There was no flavor as it did not say to add any seasonings. I would not want to to waste your time over this recipe.

Kind of bland. I added parmesan cheese and garlic.

Microwaving is not my idea of "cooking", so I totally re-did this recipe:  1 cup Cooking Sherry 1/2 cup Milk 1/4 cup Milk 1/2 cup Fresh Chives 2 teaspoon Dried Parsley 1 tablespoon Ranch Dressing 1 Teaspoon Olive Oil 2 Tablespoons Butter 2 Tablespoons Corn Starch Salt to taste  Melt butter in sauce pan over Medium heat, in separate bowl mix together 1/2 cup Milk, Corn Starch, Sherry and Parlsey.  Add to sauce pan, and stir, do not let boil. Add Chives and stir. Once sauce starts to thicken continue to simmer and add ranch and 1/4 cup Milk. Stir to mix well.   Add Shrimp and simmer for about 2 minutes. Drizzle with olive oil and stir. Serve Immediatly.  This version is really good over Ribbon noddles. I basically re-did it completly though

I liked the ingredients but found that 1/4 cup of flour was way too much. I also adapted the recipe to make a roux instead of using the microwave. I had gone light on the cayenne and I should have used more, and the sauce needed to be thinner. It is something I will try again.

I also followed the instructions for cooking on the stovetop, microwaving shrimp just seemed odd to me!  I thought the flavor was good but would reduce the amount of flour next time, since my sauce got too thick too quickly.

Good recipe...after reading the reviews, I used cornstarch, didn't use the microwave but the stove and added the dried mushrooms and peas at the end.  Great recipe ... I really liked the flavor the Sherry gave to the sauce.

I was not impressed with this recipe. I chose to cook the shrimp and sauce mixture on the stove as opposed to the microwave. The sherry and cayenne pepper were very strong and did not taste well together. The only way I would make this again is if substituted the sherry and cayenne pepper for cream of mushroom soup.

I liked this well enough--reminded me of something I'd have at Olive Garden or similar restaurant. My husband liked the sauce but not the shrimp. My 16-yr-old exchange student liked the shrimp but not the sauce. Go figure. So I compromised and gave it 3 stars...

This is a great recipe! Tasty, filling, and delicious. It's even faster if you use instant rice!

When your stove konks out and you only have a microwave to cook with you get inventive. You can make amazing meals with your micro, it is another complete stove at your fingertips. So I actually use my microwave alot anyhow so this recipe fit in well. 
I made the rice first (in the micro), set aside, defrosted the shrimp (in the micro), started the onions and butter (in the micro) while I peeled the shrimp. Mixed everything straight into the casserole, including the shrimp and cooked on medium/high, stirring occasionally for about 10 min. (Micro's differ in strength so you will have to check). I did find you need to be careful on how thick the sauce gets. 
A 2 dish meal! One casserole for the rice, one for the shrimp. Used a paper plate/towel to defrost the shrimp.  
How to defrost shrmp in the micro. Arrange on plate with tails all towards the centre. Micro using the 'muffin' setting- usually about 10 sec. on a very low strength, keep you eye on the so they don't cook, turn plate, zap again - peel. Of course running under cold water works well too but aggravates my arthritic hands. Love my micro! Thanks Aimee!
