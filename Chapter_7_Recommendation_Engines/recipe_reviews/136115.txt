I followed the recipe closely, only I used one package of chocolate fudge pudding because that was all I had. It was plenty in the end, going up to almost the top of the pie pan but leaving room for the Cool Whip. My issue with this recipe is making the pie survive past the first day. The second day, the pie started to weep liquid from under the brownie layer and the brownie layer was really soggy. It was unappealing. Next time I make this, I'll make the brownies seperate and assemble the other ingredients on dessert plates instead of making them all together as a pie.

I would give this an extra half star if there were halves. I made this for a family gathering and most people gave this recipe a 1. We all would have prefered just regular brownies with ice cream. The brownies with pudding took up the whole pan there was no more room for the cool whip. The brownies ended up soaking up some of the moisture from the pudding so they ended up really mushy.

So, I didn't plan on putting cool whip on top of my brownie pie, but there is no way I would've been able to. The cooked brownies filled 3/4 of the pie plate! I barely had room for the pudding. I improvised with cheesecake pudding and the combination pleased my hubby. I don't think I'd make this again. If so, I'd decrease the brownie ingredients.
