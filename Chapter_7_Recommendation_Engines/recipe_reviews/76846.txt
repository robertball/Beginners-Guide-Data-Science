My husband said that this deserves 5 stars.  I was thinking more like 4.5.  It was EASY to prepare.  The taste was flavorful and good.   I used chicken breasts and marinated them in a ziploc bag for about 5 hours before baking.  I also doubled the marinade to make sure the chicken was completely covered and so that we would have plenty of sauce with the meal.  I also added carrots and extra pieces of fresh garlic.   I will make it again!  THANKS

This is actually really good if you marinate the chicken in the italian dressing and add some of your own flavor to it.  I added a bit of red, white and black pepper to it and it was really good.

I used chicken breasts and added more Italian dressing.  Also, I only left it in for 45 minutes, otherwise it would have dried out. Excellent meal!

Needed more zest - I would try using Italian dressing labeled "Zesty".  I also doubled the garlic and the rosemary.  I used a large baking dish.  Cooking times and quaities were right on.  If you like your potatoes a little crispy try removing the foil for the last 10 minutes.

I give this recipe 5 stars for the flavor return on your time investment. I was looking for a recipe like the "Chicken Italian" my mom used to make. I only made a few changes: Used chicken breasts b/c that's what I had; marinated the chicken for about 30 in. in Mojo Criollo b/c my husband really enjoys the kick; and used packaged, pre-sliced potates. To save washing a bowl, I also just sprinkled the lemon, lime, and dressing over everything before covering and baking. After 45 minutes, I sprinkled shredded Italian cheese, Italian seasoning, and baked uncovered a few minutes more. Yum yum!

I thought this was a great, easy meal that tasted pretty good too!  I left the skins on the potatoes, added baby carrots and used chicken breast.  Also used the salad dressing that has oil in (not fat free) as this gives a better coating and keeps moisture & flavour in.  To give this a FAB presentation and just add a little something, I served this over a bed of fresh baby spinach & rocket leaves with some halved cherry tomatoes alongside - it looked like something you order in a restaurant!! I will make this again - perhaps vary the dressing to change it a bit. Thanks!

Used chicken breast tenders and roasted red pepper with parmesan Italian dressing. Let marinate in 1/2 sauce for 30 minutes, then covered with remainder. Also skipped lime juice because I didn't have any. I loved it on the chicken but it may have been too much for the potatoes for me and my boyfriend.

I thought this was pretty good, add how easy it was to make and I'll be making it again. I used boneless skinless breasts, and regular Itatian dressing. I marinated the chicken in the dressing for about 40 min first. Added carrots with the potatoes (I cut small bite sized), and course ground black pepper. Then with the chicken I sprinkled on some chicken seasoning and black pepper on top. I also lined the pan with foil underneath, along with covering it. At the end I topped with shredded mozz cheese. I didn't have lime juice, but it turned out fine.

I'm so sorry...It smelled good while cooking, but really did not taste good.  Presentation was also not so great.  Yes, browning the meat may help the looks, but can't possibly help the taste that much.  Chicken was bland and potatoes were just...yuck.  Thanks anyway.

A really great, flavorful & easy recipe! Tastes even better the next day. I did tweak it a little bit because I had no lime & just for personal preference: didn't have any lime so I squeezed a whole small lemon into it (when finished it didn't taste lemony at all). Used a bit more than a cup of dressing based on other reviews saying it wasn't enough (I'd say 1 1/2 cups is good). I also topped it all w/some smoked paprika which was REALLY good. Next time I will cut the time down to about 45 min. as my chicken was a bit on the dry side. But the leftover dressing in the 9x13 dish helped a lot with that. This recipe is too easy & good to not be a keeper, thank you!

I cooked this in a large casserole.  In my case, there simply wasn't enough marinade/sauce, so although the potatoes were yummy, the sauce didn't really reach the chicken, and thus neither did the flavor.  I think I will try this with a bigger pan next time, or marinate the chicken first.

This recipe is so quick and easy but still has so much flavor.  Just enough zing for it to not be boring but not so much that my kids won't eat it. It is a frequent request at my house.  It smells so good cooking that my sitter asked for the recipe without even trying it.  The only thing I ever change is to use breasts instead of thighs. Yummy!

Very tasty. I used the zesty Italian dressing, chicken breasts and red potatoes. It was yummy. I only cooked it for 45 minutes.

I found it easy to prepare and very tasty. A great way to prepare bland, skinless chicken breasts. To add even a bit more taste I substituted Ranch dressing for the Italian.

We followed the advice by other reviewers and used zesty Italian dressing,  that didn't seem to add much flavor.  Doubling the sauce seemed a bit much, and we believe led to the potatoes taking more time to cook than necessary.

The potatoes had nice flavor, but the chicken was kind of bland.  Perhaps marinating for some time before putting in the oven would fix that.  I cut the potatoes into bite sized pieces, also.  Too much liquid left in the pan after - very soupy - I need to find a use for it, as I didn't want to throw it out!

This was NOT the best meal I've ever had.  After cooking for an hour, the chicken was bland and the potatoes were hard still.  My husband continued cooking the potatoes for another two hours before they were edible.  We don't recommend this recipe and we won't make it again.  Sorry, Natalie!

This recipe we found to be a 4 but could easily turn into a 5 star. Very easy to do but the chicken still lacked some flavor. I marinated my chicken all day in about 3/4 cup zesty italian dressing. I chopped the potatoes into bite size pieces but the 1 hr cooking time was still not enough. The chicken is moist and juicy and the potatoes are fantastic and full of flavor. The only thing I will do next time is season the chicken.

This was an easy feed for a larger amount of people than I'm used to cooking for. :o) Oh - and I ran out of Italian dressing so substituted half of it with nonfat Caesar dressing instead - it worked great!

I work about 80 hours per week, so I don't have much time for food preparation even though I love to cook. I found this recipe was quick to put together, and I thought it had a very good taste. I minced the garlic instead of quartering it, but otherwise just followed the recipe. It also made great leftovers for a sandwich or salad the next day. I'm sure I will use this recipe again.

Quite good-- an hour was perfect for the chicken, but didn't quite get the potatoes done. I also added some oregano based on the review I read that said it lacked a little flavor.

This sounds good but seems to be missing something.  I used a "zesty" italian dressing as some suggested but it was still pretty bland for our taste.  Thanks anyway.

I used chicken breast and marinated it in Italian dressing for 2 hours. I added baby carrots, used half the amount of garlic, and added 1/2 teaspoon of red (cayenne) pepper and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper. This was delicious, moist, and a keeper!

The chicken is absolutely delicious.  My hubby didn't like the potatoes though because they were a little too sour from the juice.  I think the chicken would taste good cooked by itself with no vegetables.

My husband hated this. This is the first thing that I've cooked in five years that he absolutely refused to eat. Personally, I thought it was okay. It pretty much tastes like Italian dressing and nothing else, so make sure you get a good quality dressing! I won't make it again, but I would definitely recommend that you cook it a little longer. The potatoes were pretty crisp after an hour of baking. It was pretty easy to throw together, but that doesn't make it worth making.

I was extremely disappointed in this recipe. The flavor was too much and the potatoes were hard. We nuked them for a few more minutes and they were still hard and the flavor wasn't good at all.

I didn't find this especially great.  Kinda plain.  I even used zesty italian dressing because that's what I have... and I marinated the chicken but still only ok.  Potatoes were good though.

This was really good and easy. I added some mediterranean and sundried salad dressing. I also didn't used the rosemary because I didn't have it. I added carrots and extra garlic. My husband was unsure when I was making it, but really enjoyed it. Thanks for the recipe :)

Very yummy.  I lightened the recipe a little by using the italian dressing mix to make my own dressing with less oil.  I also used minced garlic mixed into the italian dressing/lime/lemon juice mix.  Enjoy!

This recipe was ok.  The chicken was a little bland, and it the potatoes didnt seem like they were fully cooked.  It was fairly easy to make though, so, I probably will make it again if I am in a hurry.

I really loved this one. I think that the potatoes cooked in the juice would taste perfect without the chicken. The chicken stayed a little white for me so i grilled her up in the last 10 minutes for a coiuple minutes on each side than put the chicken back in the dish and let sit and bake in teh juices for the last 5 minutes or so. Tastes great with corn on the cob.

My family liked it but I changes it a bit. First a quartered the potatoes like wedges boiled them for 20 mins. I also seasoned the chicken in black l, paper, salt and 1/2 cup zesty italian dressing.  I then added chicken, potatoes and carrots with one cup dressing aand uncovered for 1 hr uncovered for 10 mins....

I thought this recipe was pretty gross... I did make it as listed but used chicken thighs instead of breasts. Followed everything else to the letter. It was easy to make so that was appreciated, but I ended up throwing it all away so the ease really didnt matter. I was just disappointed, the flavor was weird, the potatoes werent cooked all the way, and it just wasnt for us.

Whoa! Yummer! I not as huge a potato fan as some in my group, but even I am head-over-heels about this recipe. My changes were: used assortment of small potatoes instead of giant ones, I left out the lime (didn't have on hand), and substituted a balsamic Italian dressing for the fat-free Italian dressing. Oh, and I cooked it for almost 90 minutes, turning down the heat to 350 for the last half hour. Oh. Dear. Me. Very, very good.

As per a few other people I also had to tweek it I added turnips to give it more of a peppery flavor I also used chicken tenders and followed the rest of the recipe. Veggies were great chicken was bland but juicy. Kids loved it will make it again but use regular dressing instead of low fat .

Delicious recipe.  I removed skin then browned thighs in oven safe fry pan.  In addition to recipe I added carrots, some chopped tomatoes with juice and dried basil. I covered fry pan with alum foil and cooked 50 mins.  Chicken very tender and great flavor.

This was easy and delicious!  I used 5 chicken breasts instead of thighs, and upped the sauce 1.5X.  There was PLENTY of sauce this way.  I marinated the chicken overnight and added some Italian seasoning to the marinade.  I assembled the dish a few hours before cooking for convenience and baked at 375 for about 50 min.   Realized later that I forgot to add the garlic, but it was still great!   Definitely a keeper!

I marinated the chicken for 1/2 hour and added one sweet potato.  Also sprinkled paprika on the dish once in the oven for color.  I enjoyed this dish.
