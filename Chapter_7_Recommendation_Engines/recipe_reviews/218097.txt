This salad could be tasty if one added less than half the amount of soy sauce given. As it was I added only half and the soy sauce overwhelmed all the other yummy flavors therein. I suggest adding soy sauce to taste starting with 2 tablespoons or 30 ml.

Hi, I am the submitter of this recipe.  I wanted to mention to use the green low sodium kikoman soy sauce as this is a much more mild soy sauce which can be found at almost any grocery store.
