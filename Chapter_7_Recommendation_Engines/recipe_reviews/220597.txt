Absolutely delicious. Almost skipped the caper brine but decided on a last minute trip to the store for it. Absolutely worth it as it adds a certain zing. Company or weeknight - couldn't be better! Be sure to watch the video: it is short and gives helpful instructions.

I love this! I didn't have caper brine, but it still turned out perfect to me. I added some chicken cubes (as I didn't have enough shrimp on hand at the time), cooked first before the shrimp as it needs more time. I served this with pasta for a quick dinner, yum!!

So tasty, and so simple. I also did not have caper brine, but used green olive juice instead. Rave reviews all around.

Be prepared to pull out the shrimp when they are done and finish the sauce separately. Smaller shrimp may cook faster than required to finish off the sauce and it is critical to avoid over cooking the shrimp.  Have the ingredients fully prepped, as in measured and combined where appropriate, and not just putting containers out on the counter.  Husband calls this one a keeper, 5 stars.

Very good!  I did not use the caper brine, instead I used white cooking wine!  I mixed the sauce and shrimp with cooked angel hair pasta and topped with freshly grated parmesan cheese!  This is an excellent dish!

OMG, wow! Just finished eating this and it is hands down, the best recipe that I have made from this website (I've made a lot). SO delicious, and SO much flavor! Absolutely restaurant-quality shrimp. In my opinion, the caper brine makes the dish -- it adds a certain sourness/saltiness that for me puts it over the top. Very simple to make too! I can't say enough how great this is. If you're planning on making this, DO NOT leave out the caper brine. I served it over toasted baguette slices to soak up all of the yummy sauce...amazing. Thank you so much for this recipe Chef John!!

This recipe is really good. My suggestion for it is: you must have mise en place for it, otherwise it can go south in a hurry -- expensive shrimp will get over-cooked in a hurry (I used 16/25 Gulf and shelled them myself -- really, NOT a problem if you have 5 minutes -- also, really, really pay attention to Chef John's directions and timing). Please be prepared before you put this together -- don't be going all "Oh, I forgot to mince the garlic" before you attempt this recipe. Do follow Chef John's directions -- and have your ingredients all lined up on your stove top before you begin. Set your timer(s). It especially rocks if you add some (drained) chopped artichoke hearts and some steamed asparagus to it. Oh, also, fresh lemon juice and fresh garlic work far better than bottled/jarred varieties. Trust me. And ... you're welcome.

The only tweak I made was to only add one of the 1 1/2 T of cold butter, as I like more of a thicker sauce than a soupy one. Simple recipe to execute. Kudos to Chef John!

This was a really good recipe and super easy. I made sure I had everything measured out and ready to pour in the pan. Doubled the recipe for a Father's Day dinner. Watched the video before I made. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a superb recipe. I did add two things, a dash of crushed red pepper to the sauce and a nice glass of wine for the cook. Thanks for sharing.

I hate it when people write a review on a recipe that they totally altered....but I did just that.  I was in a tight bind and needed to come up with dinner fast.  I had some precooked shrimp thawed and went for this recipe.  I didn't have fresh Italian parsely but I did have cilantro.  Otherwise I followed the recipe to a tee.....oh, well I was sipping white wine and decided, what the heck!  I poured  a "glug" of white wine into the sauce.  I served it over white Jasmine rice.  This was a 5 Start restaurant kind of good!  Thank you for sharing this delicious shrimp dish!!  Mmmmmm!

I didn't have fresh parsley but dried worked just fine.  I also didn't have capers, so I tried jalapeno brine!  It was awesome.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

Just tried this- my one major suggestion is to cook the butter sauce FIRST and then throw your shrimp in to cook.  Honestly, shrimp takes but like 3, maybe 4 min to cook and the total cook time with shrimp in the pan is just too long.  Mine came out overcooked unfortunately but the sauce is good.  Also, I seasoned my shrimp beforehand and put it in the fridge to marinate for like 2hrs, just so there was some good flavor. I skipped the caper and parsley...

I wasn't crazy about it. There was a lot of flavor lacking and I had to seriously doctor it up before I was able to eat it. After all was said and done I served it over angel hair pasta and it was good.

My whole family Loved this!  I did not use caper brine instead I used Jalapeno juice (otherwise to a T) we like the kick and it gave a great lingering taste, quick and very simple! This will be used over and over and over!!

This was my first time cooking shrimp and it was very easy and fast. I didn't have caper brine or red pepper flakes. I added freshly ground pepper as well as mushrooms and topped it over some buttered spaghetti noodles. (Very easy to add your favorite ingredients.) I will definitely be making this again. My boyfriend loved it as well. Proof that all you need is a few fresh ingredients to make great tasting food.

The rawness of the garlic in this recipe was much too strong. When we sampled the left over shrimps, the mellowed garlic was terrific; next time, I'll saute the garlic a little before I add it to the recipe.

I had an accidental incident as I cooking other dishes at the same time, so my shrimp was cooked pretty much at the point and flipped when I had to add the garlic, so added in 1/2 garlic (and I had at least 10 cloves minced) with the shrimp knowing that a minute or two at medium heat will still give garlic flavor without the garlic bite that raw garlic has.Me and my SO prefer undercooked/raw vs burnt and detest overcooked shrimp.

I added the caper brine to the lemon juice as suggested but me and my SO LOVE capers so I added in about a table spoon of medium sized capers.  I then cooked through the garlic and added butter until saucy as my fresh pasta (Brand name found in refrigerated section) angel hair cooked, and so I added the pasta to the sauce with the garlic, parsley and caper mixture with added butter...then added in the already cooked shrimp as I took it off the heat.  The fresh cooked pasta still had some of the water because I took it out of the pot with tongs which loosened up the sauce but still stuck to the pasta enough and then added back in the half coated garlic shrimp and tossed.  

End result, pasta covered with flavor with perfect ratio of shrimp to pasta (about .75 to 1 lb shrimp with 9 ounces of fresh brand name angel hair) garlic and caper ratio. 

Again we LOVE capers, so for us to add in whole capers was not to say this recipe isn't delicious - but a perfect recipe for people to use as a base and adjust accordingly to taste a it's quick and fast.

We enjoyed this recipe. If I did it again I would saute the garlic before putting the shrimp in. The garlic was a little raw and a bit strong for our tastes (and we love garlic).

I made it exactly as described, no modifications and loved it. In my opinion you have to do it as prescribed the first time to be a judge. AFTER that you can ad modifications, see below:

Second time I made it I used white wine instead of water to finish the sauce. I liked that as well of course.

Wish I made this sooner! Had everything except the shrimp so I picked up a 1 lb bag of frozen, 16 count raw with shell on. Made it exactly as written, and it turned out to be one of our new favorites! Served with Chef John’s Garlic Aioli Bread, Angel Hair Pasta and small dinner salad. Will make this again and again.

What can I say deeelish! This recipe and 'Basil Shrimp' on this site have so far been the most flavorful shrimp dishes I've tried. If you want more sauce easy to make more sauce. The only change I made was to add 1 tb. capers and made some pasta for a base.

Absolutely delicious! Placed cast iron pan in an oven I heated to 400 degrees. Prepped all ingredients in advance --- chopped garlic, chopped parsley, juiced lemons, measured juice, added caper brine. Rinsed shrimp and shook off most of the water. Pulled the hot pan out of the oven, placed it on a high burner, added the oil and started cooking - it was done in less than 5 minutes once the cooking started. So fast! So easy!!! Anytime you get a recipe that the hardest part is mincing garlic ---- you know you have a winner. 

This cooks so fast, you not only have to have your ingredients prepped, you need to have all of the side dishes ready, also. I only had time to toast the bread --- not even time to throw together a salad --- once this started.

Loved it!  Definitely need to prep everything before starting and pull those shrimp off as soon as they are done. I subbed olive juice for caper brine and tasted awesome. Added angel hair pasta to the sauce with a little of the pasta cooking water and then threw the shrimp back in.  I doubled the recipe for 4 adults and had just enough leftovers for my lunch the next day!

this recipe is fantastic.  i made this about a month ago and my husband and i polished off the whole recipe :)   i served it over angel hair pasta, and accompanied it with fresh artichokes, lemon, and butter.  oh, and a nice glass of white wine.   but remember what chef john says, have everything prepped and ready to go before you start.  it is critical to the success of the recipe, as shrimp will not be very tasty if overcooked.  this is a great recipe (very very quick!) for a weeknight or for a fancy special occassion.  and i feel that the caper brine is critical, as chef says.  it really adds a special somthing.  bon appetit!

6 weeks ago I never heard of Chef John, now I make it a habit to find his recipes. He is the most down to earth chef I have ever come across. This recipe is simple and I have tried it with and without the caper brine, and it definitely tastes better with the brine. Very good!

One of the worst recipes I ever found on this site. After reading the recipe I thought it sounded strange because of the excessively long shrimp cooking times especially at the high temps they recommend but I decided to try it exactly as thee recipe called for and it was a disaster, the shrimp were literally cooked to a charcoal briquette texture and the sauce had no flavor. I think it could be a decent recipe with some major modifications and I mill probably try it again using common sense  instead of the absurd recipe directions.

I loved this recipe. I am a young teenager and I made this dish fairly easily for 7 people. This dish was easy and delicious! For the parsley I didn't use exact measurements and for the red pepper I added more. I thought the extra red pepper made the dish taste even better with the bit of extra spice. I definitely will be using this recipe again. Some advice is to make a few extra side dishes as I didn't find the shrimp alone filling enough.

Basically perfect as is. But I  agree with others, 6 + minutes is to long for shrimp, no matter what the size. 3 - 4 minutes will do just fine. Next time I'll try it with  fresh salmon.

Made this for a birthday dinner and it was a hit!  Followed the recipe as written (although I did double it) and watched the video.  Everyone loved the dish especially the zing of the red pepper flakes.  Have been asked to make this for upcoming parties in July and September.  Will definitely add this to my repertoire!

Phenomenal taste and the caper brine really does make a difference, don't skip this step. Very simple but the shrimp is swimming in outstanding flavors. Paired this with Brazilian Rice ( also found on allrecipes ) and my boyfriend and I couldn't get enough. Can't wait to make it again.

This is a keeper!  I did not have caper brine so used olive juice and added sliced mushrooms. I actually sauteed all of the ingredients and added the shrimp at the end, tasted wonderful!

This was so easy and SO good!  My husband took one bite and said, "Can you make this again?"  I increased everything except the shrimp by 50% to make more sauce and served it over egg noodles. Awesome!  Also, I didn't have capers so I dissolved kosher salt in water and added a few drops of pickle juice.  Worked great.  This will be a standard for our family.

Really delicious!  I LOVE the caper brine in this but then I could make myself sick on capers - love them!  The only thing I changed was the parsley.  I just don’t like fresh parsley but I had some fresh basil and used it instead and it was wonderful.  Thanks for another great recipe, Chef John!

Watching the video made it easy to make this recipe. I did as written and it wasn't at all hard to follow and the only thing I really didn't like to much about was the acidity. I used 6 cloves of garlic but the acidity in the lemon & caper mixture was slightly over powering for my taste. I added more butter and a few tbsp of water to reduce the flavor and then it was much better. After those adjustments, it was better to my liking. And the shrimp had a nice little heat.

This was ungodly delicious! I made this exactly as stated except for adding a little more garlic, because I am a garlic fiend. I served it over sphaghetti squash. My only complaint is that it should state "1 serving" as I could have finished the whole thing off myself. I made this in a cast iron pan which gave the shrimp a nice little crust. Don't skip the caper brine, it gives the dish a nice depth of flavor!

Indescribably divine! I did a test run using 2#'s of shrimp, will be using 3-4#'s for a party. I don't have a pan big enough for that much shrimp in one layer so I made double the amount of sauce, but with an entire bulb of garlic and without the shrimp. For the shrimp, I tossed it in 2T melted butter plus some salt + pepper. Layed them out on a baking sheet, not touching, and broiled for 2.5 minutes. Pulled them out of the oven and tossed with the sauce. AMAZING!  

I used extra jumbo Argentinian Red Shrimp, which can apparently overcook really quickly so even if I was using a smaller amount I don't think the stovetop method would work for them because of the cooking time. 

The shrimp were deveined with shells on. I took the shells off for most but left some on for comparison. Next time I will definitely take the shells only leaving the tail on.

(**For people reading that get angry about people making changes & reviewing, the reason to do this is to help other people with a possible hurdle whether they be missing ingredients, dislikes, ideas, diet restrictions, equipment, etc. Also, get over it!**)

This recipe was amazing ! I am a huge seagoi fan and was skeptical when it came to trying this but it turned out pretty well . I would not recommend letting the olive oil heat until it starts to smoke if you have a house full cause it will cause panic , lol . Enjoy !

Simple recipe that catches the essence of garlic and shrimp.  Just make sure to NOT overcook shrimp --then it's too rubbery.

I have used this recipe over 25 times.  Almost alway frozen shrimp from Walmart .  We have adapted to more pepper flakes.  Don't skip the caper brine, don't change this recipe.

It was the best shrimp I have ever had in my life, and I am a huge foodie. Add the caper brine. It takes this recipe to a whole new level. Chef John, thank you for such an outstanding recipe!

I didn't care for this. Also, shrimp was overcooked based on following his time line for cooking. So follow your instincts instead.

As a rule, when trying a new recipe, I don't stray from a recipe the first time I prepare it.  That said,  I should have known better  than to cook the shrimp for as long as is called for.  The shrimp were so overcooked they were inedible.  I did try this a second time and adjusted the shrimp cooking time.  Wheile the shrimp were cooked perfectly, the dish as very bland  so i won't be making it again.

This is delicious. I have made this several times. I serve the shrimp with pasta. Use the caper brine! If you don't, you are not making this recipe. You are making a different one.

It's a great basic recipe so I had to tweak it a little. I added more red pepper flakes, 1.5 TV of capers, 12 cloves of garlic minced with 1/4 white onion, 1/c chicken broth and a teeny bit of cornstarch. I also cooked it with brocoli. My husband loved it. Served with saffron rice and garlic nann.

3 stars because this was so sour from all the lemon!  My cheeks hurt!  The add ins I made, which I don't think affected the sourness is add a couple capers and some fresh tomatoes... and not sure why everyone is gushing over this.  It was edible but wow!  Served over angel hair pasta for the family and I ate mine over zucchini noodles.  Probably won't make again.

My 10-year old son picked this recipe out to make last night.  I was skeptical (not being a fan of capers) but I have to say, the caper brine made the dish.  We made one batch with fish (it turned out incredibly tasty), and one with shrimp.  They licked their platters clean, and I think I'm going to see my son on "chopped" about 10 years from now if he keeps it up!

As ALWAYS I followed this recipe EXACTLY for dinner last night.
It was OUTSTANDING as written by Chef John ..... anyone surprised? I used the hard-to-find red shrimp and served it over linguini. The only change I will make the next time (which will be SOON!) will be to double the amount of red pepper flakes as it was too subtle for me. I will also add a tablespoon of capers in addition to the tablespoon of brine.
Great dinner!!!
ADDITIONAL: This has become my favorite meal of all. I think I've made this 5 times since finding it. A couple "tips" although modifying anything from Chef John should be a crime. Since I've double the sauce I've used 1 TBSP. olive juice and the other of caper brine. I've also started adding a TBSP. of chopped green onions and a gentle sprinkle of shredded Parmesan right before it is plated.

This recipe has been my go to recipe, with ingredients I always have on hand. The reason,however, I am commenting is there are so so many pictures of tightly curled overcooked shrimp it is truly amazing. If you like good simple food, ignore all the pictures and cook as the recipe directs.

I’ve made this at least a dozen times and every time we are licking the bowl. I serve it over some grilled garlic bread and sometimes add capers as well as the brine. I make it exactly as directed and it’s a favorite in my house.

Don't change a thing, if you don't have the caper brine you'll be happy you make the trip to get it. Served over angel hair pasta with garlic bread.  Will be making again soon.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for. It was hands down my most favorite shrimp recipe ever. I was hesitant using the caper brine, but it had such good reviews I opted to try it. I am so glad I did, as it gave it just the perfect flavor that popped in your mouth.  I will definitely make this again!

OMG!!  Chef John you absolutely hit this one out of the park!!!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  Caper brine is a definite addition, who would of thought it?  LOL!!  Folks, follow as is, you won’t be sorry!!  I made extra sauce to add to the bed of Basmati rice that I put the shrimp on, just doubled the sauce recipe, simple!!  Amazing....LOVE IT!!

Wow!  This is amazing!  Whatever you do, don’t skip the caper brine; it takes the flavor to a whole new level!  I also agree with a fellow reviewer who mentioned having the ingredients portioned out and ready to go.  Otherwise you risk over cooking the shrimp while you’re prepping/measuring.  Made this for my seafood loving family and they proclaimed it the best shrimp dish ever!

All due respect to Chef John...I've tried a number of his recipes and enjoyed them. But not this one.  First of all, the idea of cooking shrimp on high heat made me cringe.  I went with medium high and for less time. Even then, they almost overcooked. By the time I removed them to do the "sauce." the garlic had pretty much turned the color of charcoal.  Whatever "sauce" I could salvage was not especially tasty.  The addition of caper brine didn't do much either. I could taste it, but it didn't add any "zing." I tried this one because I wanted to try something slightly different from my go to lemon garlic shrimp recipe. I should have stuck with mine.

My husband loved it and he never eats shrimp unless its fried or wrapped in bacon, otherwise he says he's allergic to it.  I made it exactly as the recipe was except I didn't have any fresh parsley so I used dried and less of it.  Was Great!!!

We loved this dish.  I doubled the sauce and the shrimp, used 12 cloves of garlic, and used white wine (dry vermouth) instead of water.  I used 16/20 shrimp.  We served this over gluten free linguine and made it again 4 days later.  YUM!!!!

We loved it! Like others I didn't have caper brine and feel like we may have missed out, even if what we had was very good, next time I'll be sure to use the brine.

You don't even have time to say your own name! Thanks Buddy for another INCREDIBLE recipe!! I had planned on taking a photo but the only thing left is my empty plate! ;-) Enjoy! IT ROCKS!!

This was a very good dinner, and very quick to make.  I followed the directions exactly, including cooking time on each step.  I was disappointed to find the shrimp (16/20 count) overcooked.  I will make it again, but remove the shrimp much sooner.  We liked the sauce it made, and served this for dipping with crusty french bread.  While I love shrimp cooked in just garlic and butter (with leftover, for dipping), I don't like cooking with that much butter.   This recipe is a perfect blend of other liquids, while using a small amount of butter.

So so good. Used 21/25 shrimp and cooked a little over a pound in a large cast iron skillet. The sauce was the perfect amount of both garlic and lemon. I took the shrimp out a little early then added more butter to the sauce then poured it on the shrimp. My girlfriend and I are on a low carb diet and this was our favorite dinner so far! Thanks!

Both me and my husband loved this. Added red bell peppers and used green olive brine instead of capers cos they were out of stock where I shopped.

Just finished this and it was excellent. I used a little white wine instead of the caper brine; not a fan of capers. Hubby thought it was very good. Not sure how one could rate this as having no flavor or being dry? Simply delicious.

The only change was white wine for adding "water" to the sauce at the end.  It's a great excuse to open a bottle of wine!

I liked how quick and easy it was to cook but the lemon juice was too much for the shrimp and it overpowered the garlic flavor.  It almost tasted like ceviche rather than garlic shrimp.  I would make it again and leave out the lemon juice to see what happens.

In order to review this recipe, I need to share my background: 
I come from a long line of Farm Women, who had to feed up to 20 men, three times a day. That meant that meals had to be simple, filling, and ~fast~. So, my first 18 years of life were filled with roasted chicken, pork, beef, with baked, canned or steamed bowls of vegetables. NO savory recipe was made that involved more than salt/pepper/dill or parsley: staples in Swedish meals. 
Therefore, when I became a new bride at 18 years old, I followed what I knew and loved, copying the same healthy and classic meals. If I wanted something with more than 5 ingredients, my husband and I made reservations!

When I do decide to make a savory meal from scratch, I still refuse to make ANYTHING that involves more than 5 ingredients (butter/oil don't count) or takes longer than 30 minutes to cobble together. THIS Garlic-Shrimp recipe is hand's down, the BEST new recipe that I've tried in 47 years of marriage! The video was invaluable in how it should look, plus the reviewers who mentioned that EVERYTHING had to be ready so it could go together quickly. 

I made two minor changes: I wanted more sauce than shrimp, so I used 8 JUMBO shrimp (3 bites per shrimp) and included the capers WITH the brine, because we LOVE capers! Since neither my husband nor I like pasta or rice, I served this over a large mixed salad, using the cooled and reserved sauce as the dressing. It was a stunningly grand meal, served with a baguette and a fine gla

I followed the recipe exactly and the shrimp was a bit over cooked.  I think 3-4 minutes total cooking time would have been better.   The caper brine was also very strong in flavor and overpowering- I would either halve the amount or eliminate it completely.

Wowza! This was so delicious. I debated which garlic shrimp recipe to try, and the unique twist, copious amounts of garlic, and simplicity of Chef John's recipe won me over. Boy, am I glad it did! This was bursting with flavor. It has just the right amount of lemony acidity, perfect garlic flavor, a fresh herbaceous quality from the parsley, and just a little zing from the caper brine and red pepper flakes. I doubled the amount of shrimp but tripled all of the other ingredients because I was going to serve it over pasta. It made the perfect amount of sauce that way. My Italian husband, who could eat sausage and red sauce every day, ate two big helpings of this impressive dish. He thought it was a tad spicy (he doesn't care for heat), but I thought it was perfect. We sprinkled freshly grated Parmesan over and accompanied it with sliced fresh Italian bread. YUM! This one is going in my repertoire.

I doubled the recipe and kept exactly as written.  Everyone loved it!!  Highly recommend serving over some kind of thick toasted bread like he recommend in the video.  It soaks up the amazing sauce and goes great with the shrimp.  Will absolutely make again.

Absolutely wonderful!! I used the extra large shrimp so I had less meat and more pan drippings. I served it over garlic baguettes with a cream cheese schemer and roasted asparagus. My husband loved it!! Certainly one of the best shrimp recipes I've made!!

Holy lemon juice!  This had a bit of a bitter and spicey bite to it.  It was way too lemony - I re-read the recipe 3 times to see if it was supposed to be teaspoons instead of tablespoons.  Sorry, was excited but this tastes like lemon, not garlic.

Overall, a great recipe! Quick and easy to make. I used all ingredients as called for and it was a little heavy on the caper brine. It adds some real zing to it but most of the family was a little put off by it. Too strong for them, so next time I will try it with 1 teaspoon instead of 1 tablespoon.

I made the recipe exactly as it was written, step for step. I believe the temperature needs to be adjusted and that it does not require a smoking hot skillet. I found the shrimp to be overlooked using the method provided. The flavor profile was excellent and the caper brine was an outstanding add to the dish. My only complaint is the shrimp were completely overdone and it lacked adequate sauce. I will make this recipe again and modify the heat level. With less evaporation, there will be more sauce and perfectly cooked shrimp. Anything beyond 3 minutes total cooking time for skillet prepared raw shrimp is entirely too much. Had the shrimp not been so over done I would rate this a five star recipe.

This recipe is so simple yet so unbelievably tasty. I make it with a combo of sea scallops and shrimp (cook scallops first 3-4 min turning once and adding a little of the garlic) then follow the recipe as noted. I serve it over basmati rice and my guy just loves it.

Perfect in every way. Thinking about making the sauce over fish. Delicious!  Caper juice a must! I used regular parsley because that's what I had on hand,  and felt it tasted delicious.  Plates empty!  That's when you know something is good. Definite do again.

Oh my goodness, so delicious. I made it just as directed except the caper brine and a little less garlic because I ran out. Tossed with about 6 oz cooked angel hair pasta. Less is more when working with delicious fresh shrimp.Would definitely make again.

Spot On!!!   Delicious!! Didnt have caper brine so substituted with Clam Juice and garnished with lemon wedge and parsley.  I was overly generous with the red pepper flakes for a bigger kick.  This is a simply delicious recipe!

The video instructions for this recipe are fantastic, and it is just as easy as it appears. 

I deglazed the pan with a little (~2 tablespoons) pinot grigio that was handy. I also used about eight cloves of garlic for the pound of shrimp.  I used jumbo (16-20 size) wild caught North Carolina shrimp, and served it over fresh angel hair pasta with green beans on the side and Chardonnay. Fabulous.

My husband said this is the best shrimp he's ever had, and he's lived in South Louisiana his whole life. It really is SO delicious and unlike any other garlic shrimp I've had. Do not skip the caper brine! That's the key to this recipe!

I used more garlic than the recipe called for (there's rarely too much garlic for my taste) and it was wonderful. My husband & two kids loved it (6 & 7 years old). I'll definitely be making this again.

So good!  Out of caper juice,  I substituted green olive brine, which added some piquancy and  salt.  I did not salt the shrimp as instructed, as olive brine is itself very salty.  I used a T of dried parsley from my garden instead of fresh as I still have little kids that pick out anything green.  Wonderful dish, and the sauce complemented the shrimp very well!

Absolutely perfect as written! No need to adjust anything. Taste was insanely good. The garlic flavor was nice and strong and the  pepper flakes and caper brine added the perfect touch! Beautiful presentation for company too :) Served over angel hair pasta w herbs and a side salad. Will definitely make again. Thanks Chef John!!!

Great tasting and very simple as others have said (buy the shrimp already deveined to keep it simple).  My husband said it was the best meal I have ever made (and I cook a lot!!) I added much more garlic 'cuz we're garlic lovers here and it was terrific!

This was absolutely the best garlic shrimp!  I made it exactly as on the recipe and it was great with perfect seasoning.  The dish is beautiful and presents well!  I served it with a side of rice pilaf and it was perfect.  Thank you!

Loved it - delicious - easy to make and easier to eat, Didn't have caper brine - so I used olive brine as another person did.  It went to together so easily. I served it over linguini.   This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was good but not as good as I hoped. The sauce was tangy and salty not as buttery and garlic as I hoped. I will try it again with bigger shrimp.

Fantastic. Most Ingredients are already in your pantry. So easy.  When you set it on the table, no one believes you made it yourself!  I love it and make it for myself weekly.  Serve w salad and/or a startch.  I have this & salad.  Very healthy.

Just simply delicious.  Added some fresh chopped tomatoes and mushrooms that I sauteed separately then combined them with the shrimp at the end.  The bite of the red pepper flakes took it over the top.  Served over linguine.  I could eat this 3 times a week...

What a surprise! When I read the recipe, I figured it would be good, but just another butter garlic sauce. WRONG! The caper brine really added a different dimension to the flavor. DO NOT SKIP IT!I did not have parsley. I added one finely sliced green onion with the garlic, and it blended perfectly! This would be fantastic with linguine.I may try a tbs. of dry white wine next time. I cannot wait to make this again!

I made it just as the recipe read. This is super easy, but it tastes like a more complex dish. The caper brine adds a slight tarty sweetness.

Absolutely loved this! Made it exactly as directed, and only wish I'd have doubled the sauce components. Next time, I'll make it as specified up through the first addition of the butter, then remove the shrimp and add additional lemon, caper brine, parsley & cold butter, tossing the shrimp back after stirring those things in again. I did not need water, as I wanted to use a piece of sourdough to wipe up the juices. Delicious as is, but would have liked more sauce. :-)

This was so simple and tasty. I only had two tablespoons butter and no lemons on hand, so I mixed some chicken broth with lemon pepper seasoning and it still turned out great. The caper brine does give it a little zing plus added a splash of white wine. Saved in recipe box and look forward to making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe. Followed the recipe exactly, however, I would have liked it to be much saucier so that it could be served over rice.

My kids and husband love garlic and this recipe certainly hits the spot.  I use an entire bag of frozen, raw, tail-off shrimp so I double the recipe ingredients and use a lot of fresh minced garlic.  Using the frozen shrimp, I've found that I have extra water so I usually drain off the water so the sauce isn't so thin.  I have used caper brine, but have also used pickle juice (when I discovered I was out of capers) for the salty flavor.  I've made this recipe several times and very time I've made it, my family raves about it.

This was great! I did add a few capers with brine. I would suggest doing sauce quickly and not cooking long or you will lose that bright flavor.

Very tasty, I cooked as  directed, the only change I made was using dried parsley since I didn't have fresh parsley on hand and added capers in addition to the brine. Still tasted fantastic and is definitely a keeper for a quick dinner on a weekday night. Served over angel hair pasta with garlic toast. Next time I think I'll add mushrooms and possibly broccoli since I'm a fan of both.

We LOVED this recipe! The only thing I changed was I substituted a dry white wine for the caper brine.

Made this without shrimp. Used it as a base for a pasta dish (I didn't feel like tomato sauce tonight) and it was delicious!

Shrimp was very good but it needed more sauce base. Just melting butter and adding water to it didn't really cut it for us. Perhaps adding some Alfredo sauce or anything else would of made this better.

Very tasty and quick and simple to make.  Didn't have fresh parsley so used dried and used garlic paste which blended in the sauce very nicely.  Served over egg noodles.  This is company worthy - will definitely make again.  Next time will thin the sauce with white wine.

FANTASTIC! I'll sometimes use a bit of white wine or chicken broth at the very end instead of water and I don't add the pepper flakes. I've made this many times and omit the caper brine because to me it's an unnecessary expense if you don't have capers on hand. I serve it with cooked pasta or cooked basmati rice.

I made it as written and I really wouldn't change a thing. Mincing the garlic so it was very fine seemed to eliminate that bite of raw garlic that I'd feared because it really doesn't cook very long. After I removed the shrimp from the pan, I tossed 8 ounces of cooked linguine in the pan sauce, then added the shrimp before serving. The whole dish took just minutes to make. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the sauce was so delicious. I served it to guests with a side dish of roasted asparagus and cherry tomatoes for a simple, elegant summer dinner. Thanks, Chef John!

After following the recipe using the measurements given, when I took the shrimp out all I was left with was a little dampness in the pan.  I had to add more than twice as much more butter and lemon juice to get any sort of sauce at all.

This was really very good - I made exactly as directed  Boyfriend and I both enjoyed it.  It's much easier if you have everything prepared and measured before you start, especially if you are cooking other things at the same time.  We served this over white rice and just happen to have a zucchini from the garden that had to be cooked, so we fried it up using another recipe on this site.  Great meal.  p.s.  I need to double or triple the sauce, perhaps by adding some white wine to it after removing the shrimp.

This is the best shrimp dish I've made.  I've tried several recipes for shrimp pasta dishes and I was never satisfied with any of them until now.  The little bit of caper brine totally made the difference.  I used fresh basil and parsley and added a little shredded parm.

Thank you Chef John!!! I feel like such a real cook! This is a FABULOUS dish and so easy to make! To avoid an extra trip to the store, I used limes instead of lemons, and cilantro instead of parsley - INCREDIBLE! Turned out great and shrimp just burst with flavor and succulence. Definitely watch Chef John's video first!

This is a great recipe.  It is perfect just the way it is. I made it tonight and didn't have parsley, but I did have a garden full of basil. It really liked the parsley, but loved the basil with it.  Just a bit different.  Both ways are delicious, full of favor. I served with summer squash from the garden.  I would give it 10 stars if I could! Love it!!!

Another winner from Chef John. I wanted shrimp with garlic and when I Googled it this was one of the first recipes I saw. I followed the recipe exactly.  Since I have tried other Chef John recipes I just knew this would be amazing. So simple but tastes like a lot of work went into it. I served this with roasted asparagus with balsamic brown butter sauce. It was off the chart delicious. I love how Chef John teaches you to make simple, quick meals that are better than you can get in many restaurants. Thanks again Chef John.

Good flavor. I served it over angel hair pasta and it could've used more sauce. Will just add more butter and maybe a couple ounces of dry white.

Delicious!! You don't have to change a single thing (but I did! haha - I just added a bit less butter, no biggie!). I served this over angel hair pasta and it was fantastic. Next time, I'm going to throw in some steamed broccoli and maybe some mushrooms just to jazz it up a bit. It doesn't need it really, but I think most dishes are better with mushrooms! haha

It was just okay lacking some depth of flavor even with the caper brine in it which made it a bit unusual but not unpalatable. the sauce was rather soupy and the shrimps had a different texture from the high cooking temperature. Next time i might coat them with flour or starch and use a medium high heat remove them then compose the sauce.

Delicious + easy = Love it!  Just like almost everyone else who made it, I tweaked this recipe slightly based on what I had available.  I used coconut oil instead of olive which gave the shrimp a very subtle coconut flavour, which I like.  I also used more garlic, which I love.  Lastly, instead of butter I used a veggie-type spread.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

This recipe was very easy to make and so delicious! I was not able to find capers, so had to omit that ingredient. I made this dish for 3 Brazilian University exchange students and they loved it! One student said the dish tasted just like his dad cooks them.

So quick, simple and delicious! Great for weeknights. My only change was I added capers to the recipe since i love the taste of them. I paired it with angel hair pasta and it was a hit.

Very delicious recipe! I didn't have caper brine, but it was delicious anyway - I did add about 1/2 red and 1/2 yellow medium bell peppers. Also left the red pepper flakes on the side to add on my own plate since my wife can't do spicy. It was so good, we had it again later that week. Goes great with rice (even brown).

Hands down the best ever. Shrimp was on sale so i got 2 lbs instead of one but had to make three small batches because i only have a small saute pan. First batch was harrible but it was for the kids and they didn't now beter, second batch, i used less olive oil, just barle y coating the pan, doubled the red pepper, (husband likes spice), third batch made at written, husband loved the extra heat of the second batch, but said that both (the sesond and third) were great and better then the resturant that specalizes in garlic shrimp. 
Darn guess now i lost another excuse to eat out. Oh well i can still burn somthing if i really want to!
Will make again. So fast to put to gether too. If you do not have a garlic press i suggest investing in one for this at least.

Best recipe for shrimp ever. You won't regret trying it. I've tried it with both dry (I just shook some on without measuring - about 1 1/2 tablespoons)  and fresh parsley and both were winners. Thanks for sharing Chef John.

Delicious, of course. It had to be coming from Chef John! I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a few capers at the end because I had the bottle out from taking out the brine and I just LOVED the flavor it gave the shrimp. I will make this again and again.

This recipe was a little too garlicy for me and my family (and we cook with garlic all the time and LOVE it). I would say cut back on the garlic the first time around and see how it tastes and if you need more garlic you can add extra the next time.

Yum! restaurant quality dish. Served with fresh fettucini, added a bit more lemon juice than called for, added a bit of water, more butter,  and parmesean and tossed with the pasta, shrimp on top.  Big glass of red...
My husband LOVED it!

If your shrimp are smaller, it doesn't take quite as long to cook as he specifies.  Mine ended up a little over cooked, but they were still delicious!  Though I'd never heard of serving them on good bread as he suggested, I tried it and it was amazing.  My kids loved this recipe.

Zing of capers & lemon juice really brought this together.  I also brined the shrimp for 30 min in 1t salt/at ratio and it really gave them a great texture.

Fantastic! Super quick, easy, and delicious! I followed another reviewer’s lead and substituted green olive juice for the caper juice since that’s what had on hand. Used some left over pasta water to thin sauce at end.

Such a fantastic recipe! I made one tiny change to suit personal preference by sprinkling a little corn starch on them prior to frying, and boyyy are these good. The small amount of brine makes the sweetness of the shrimp really shine. 10/10!

VERY easy to make.  I did mine in a wok, didn't use the brine - (none available nearby) but used a salt water mix -  and it still tasted delicious!  Next time I'm going to try it with jumbo shrimp.

I started out by frying up diced carrots and purple onion and half a jalapeño. I then transfered them to a plate and followed the recipe. When the shrimp was done I added back in the carrot mixture and cooked it another minute, then stirred in cooked Shanghai noodles and diced green onion. It was awesome!

This was very good. I did cook it a bit differently than stated (was being lazy)!  I heated up two tablespoons of butter and just threw everything in. Except the caper brine, no clue what that is. Cooked the shrimp for about three minutes and it was perfect. My favorite ingredient was the crushed red pepper flakes. It added just the tiniest touch of heat. Very lovely.

Fantastic. What a good addition to our Christmas eve. meal. BTW, it did pair well with the suggested  chardonnay . Although I'm not a fan of "Chef John" he  comes across like someone who wants to be cool. It doesn't work, but his recipes  do come out very well.

Made this and tossed over fettuccine noodles, AWSOME. Only change was  little more lemon juice, caper juice and some caper's. The change was for more liquid with out diluting with water.

Absolutely delicious and it wil go into my regular rotation of shrimp recipes!  I was out of even dried parsley and lemon juice and it was still excellent. Can't wait to see what the lemon adds next time.  I did add capers - a great addition, but DO NOT add extra caper juice as I did or it will be too salty.  In fact, I would not add any salt next time.

Just made this for my family of picky eaters and they loved it!! The only things I did different from the recipe was I used fresh chives instead of parsley and served it over a small bed of angel hair pasta. It was a big hit and I will definitely be making it again.

This was fantastic! I scaled the recipe down by half and served over Cacio E Pepe, the BF and I were blown away! I went light on the seasonings when I did the pasta because I wanted the garlic sauce to come through and wow! Sadly I didn't have fresh parsley, so next time! It does need to be served over some sort of starch to really enjoy the garlicy sauce! Thank you for another stellar meal!!

I was originally going for shrimp scampi and found this.  It was easier to make and so delicious.  The steps in the recipe make it mistake proof -- and the shrimp was perfectly cooked, and perfectly seasoned.

Next time I'd finely chop the parsley in lieu of chopped. I added about .5 tablespoon of butter and extra garlic to have a little more flavor, as I was mixing it in with pasta.

Super-easy and super-delicious!!  This recipe came out great. I’ll just have to remember to use peeled, raw shrimp. Peeling them on my plate was a little sticky and took some of the fun out my dining experience.

I made a couple of substitutions - white vinegar in place of the caper brine and 1 1/2 tsp of italian seasoning in place of the parsley. I added it to a plain white sauce with cheese tortellini and some Monterey Jack. It was absolutely delicious - I will be making it again!

Some of the best shrimp I’ve ever made. The lemon juice and red pepper give it that zing that’s irresistible. No need for any cheese! I mixed it with cauli rice, spinach, and leftover canned peas. SO GOOD!

SO GOOD. I used a ton of garlic, but didn’t have the caper brine so I used green olive brine instead and it worked out deliciously. I put over yellow rice with zucchini. Just enough kick with the red pepper flakes.

My family loved this recipe. They like all the recipes I use from Chef John. especially his stroganoff!  The only change was,  I used white wine instead of caper brine and I served it over linguine. Enjoy!

This turned out pretty darn good. I put the shrimp over angel hair pasta. I would probably make more sauce next time, especially if serving over pasta. Watching the video was very helpful!

Yum!! I loved this recipe, cooked shrimp initially a bit longer to get a char/crisp as my husband only likes “grilled” shrimp and he ended up loving it too. Sent recipe to my parents and they loved it as well

Simple and yummy!  This is my kind of recipe.  
I did not have caper brine so I substituted thyme.  I also used 2 cloves of garlic along with a sprinkle of garlic powder and onion salt.  My family loved it.  Thanks for this recipe.

This was excellent. I doubled the shrimp but forgot to double the sauce and it was still delicious, very garlic in flavor. I just happened to have the caper juice but I think any nice sherry or raspberry vinegar could be substituted or maybe even rice vinegar.

Great easy recipe!  Get all the ingredients ready before you start cooking . . . Mise en place . . . because the actual cooking time is short and will go fast.  You don’t want to over cook the shrimp.  I used Kauai farmed head on unpeeled shrimp.  I added a couple more garlic cloves, 1 Tbsp capers and a dash more crushed red pepper.  Incredible flavor.  Mahalo Chef John for a wonderful recipe and making me feel like a professional chef!

Loved it! I did not use the red pepper flakes (probably will next time).  Also the next time would reduce the caper brine just a bit to reduce the saltiness a little.  Instead of water to thin out the sauce I used a splash of dry sherry.  Served with roasted asparagus and mushrooms and some French bread to soak up the sauce.

Very underwhelming. Probably would not make again. I  made noodles to go with it, and the ended up making Alfredo sauce just to add something to it. I've definitely had WAY better shrimp from other recipes on this site.

AMAZING & SIMPLE !
I had everything but the caper brine on hand.Used 10 garlic cloves & my pepper flakes looked more 'ground' than 'flaked', but otherwise per recipe AND VERY happy w/ the flavor combination !!
I'll definitely make it again & may even get caper brine to see what I'm missing !?
Its ALL prep & goes together VERY fast - careful to not OVER cook the shrimp. I had it w/ quail egg  & veg stir fried rice & was great together

I followed the recipe except I used Avocado Oil instead of Olive Oil.  I'm not sure if that's why my sauce was mostly grease or not.  No worries though, I poured off the grease and it was delicious! My husband doesn't like garlic but he loved this Garlic Shrimp. LOL

We loved this! It's easy and delicious. I used wild-caught Argentinian shrimp. Also, as I was throwing the garlic into the food processor, one of my last jalapenos from this year's garden caught my eye. Why not? I threw it in with the garlic. My husband and I like spicy, but I did deseed it first. I didn't add the red peppers or the parsley. If I make it again, I would do the same except add cilantro in place of the parsley. We served it over "zoodles." Definitely a keeper!

Wonderful recipe.  Used 31-40 shrimp, no tails, and even when I reduced the time, they were a tad overdone.  Some capers went in with the juice, but no problem as I do like them.  Served over rice and it was delicious except for doneness.  Will cook quicker next time.

My family of five, including kids ages 12, 9, and 5 enjoy this recipe. I need to half the lemon juice and garlic so it's not too "spicy" for the kids' taste. We had this tonight with jasmine rice and peas.

Amazing shrimp! I was so surprised I made them. I accompanied the shrimp with angel hair pasta. I took the shrimp out of the pan and put the pasta in the pan to warm it with the sauce then added the shrimp back in before serving it with some Parmesan.. delicious!!!

I made this meal w/o the caper brine. It tasted excellent! This was my first time preparing shrimp. The meal was easy to prepare as described and flavorful. It tasted as good as any shrimp I've had in a restaurant. I served It over a bed of couscous. I will definitely prepare this meal again!

Great base to a shrimp whatever you have in mind meal! I've added this to zucchini, cucumber spiral cold / hot  dishes even the regular pasta's for a great dinner. This latest version of a Greek cucumber salad, I added the shrimp along with pepperoni, olives, carrots and a lemon garlic sesame seed dressing to compliment our summertime grill out!

Way too lemony for my family. Great recipe, fast, easy but way too lemony. I will make this again but cut the lemon and I did not add all the butter that the recipe called for as it seemed like it would be too rich. It has me on my way though and the family loves Shrimp so I will modify this recipe and try again. Thank you!

We loved this! Easy and open to changes depending on what you have on hand. I had no capers/brine and one of the subs is thyme, which we had. Also had parsley, and cilantro, chopped those up, too, just for fun. We are garlic lovers and added plenty+. Followed recipe totally except those slight changes. Thanx Chef John, another keeper!

I've made it twice. It was definitely better with the medium shrimp. The jumbo shrimp didn't have as much flavor. I have served it over pasta and on a salad. Both were excellent!

My hubby loves garlic shrimp and these came out tasty and aromatic. I served it over some mixed basmati wild rice with veggie.
I like using   red argentinian shrimp for these since they always comes out better than regular shrimp. I was glad I  have capers in my fridge and tried it or rather added some capers too.

Video instruction works better for me  than reading instructions since I am a see one do one type of learner.
Thank you.

Absolutely delicious. My husband and I Really like garlic so I may have used 7 cloves .  Easy to make and so tasty.  We skipped the brine because we didn’t have any and neither of us likes it. Otherwise I made it as written.

We made pasta and the sauce made an incredible pasta sauce and completed the dish perfectly. This will remain a favorite!

This shrimp is an amazing dish! I made this for a party and served it with thin-sliced french bread in the same bowl [placed on bread edge around perimeter of bowl] with the shrimp and the bread absorbed some of the juices from the bottom and makes a great base for serving.  I doubled the recipe and also added a little extra butter and olive oil to create a little more sauce.  As chef John stated, it is very important to have all the ingredients ready to go because this recipe moves fast.    One of my new favorites for sure!

This is so yummy!  Another perfect recipe from Chef John.  Careful with the conversions; when I changed from 4 to 8 the caper brine and I think others did not calculate correctly.  I hap people fighting for the leftovers!

Absolutely delicious.  My son and  I ate the whole package of shrimp by ourselves!  Instead of regular salt I used garlic salt and it really added to the flavor.

I'm giving this 5 stars because it's delicious, fast and easy to prepare. I'm cutting calories so  I did not add the second butter. I was out of fresh garlic so used bottled and freeze dried Italian parsley and it was still delicious. I can only imagine how great it must be when prepared according to the directions!

I used this recipe to make 8 pounds of shrimp for a gathering. Awesome, easy to follow and very tasty results -made my first try at large batch cooking a breeze.  I used the caper brine on the first couple batches but skipped it later - I liked the unique taste it adds but was worried that everyone might not. You definitely need to have your workspace and all ingredients prepped and ready due to the various steps and constant stirring required over the short cooking window. Everyone loved the shrimp (and I'm no chef)! My only problem now is what to do with a bottle of dry capers...

I used jalapeno juice instead of caper brine, because I didn't have any on hand.  This was a really good recipe.

OMG! This is so good, that my husband and I try to make at least 2-3 times a month for dinner. The recipe is spot on and I for one couldn't get enough of it. I've made this at least 5-6 times already. The modification I have made after making it as is was to add the capers to the dish. I highly recommend not skipping the caper brine, your totally missing out if you do. 
Also, my sauce usually tends to be watery at the end but I just add a little corn starch and it turns out fine. 
I also recommend have this with some garlic bread. So good!!

I've been experimenting with different shrimp recipes, and this one was my favorite. I had it with sauteed mushrooms and spinach, and a little bit of homemade Alfredo sauce. Delicious!

I did not use caper brine.

Quick, easy, and delicious! I added more butter than the recipe called for, which was the only change. I made pasta with it and after the pasta was done, I put the pasta in the pan with the shrimp. Delicious.

WE LOVE this.  It is healthy, quick and so easy.
BUT - do like some reviewers recommended - get it all prepped before starting the process. I did add the caper and artichokes as per one recommendation - one pot meal -Served over  whole wheat pasta - cappelini -.  Even DH who is not a pasta lover -I know strange - but he's ok otherwise - wanted more.
Great dish.

I made these exactly as directed except didn't have parsley.
Honestly I find the sauce could of used more garlic... next time I make this I will marinate the shrimp in some olive oil garlic and red pepper flakes...then go from there. The flavor stuck to the sauce but not to my shrimp.

i think this recipe would have been a five if i followed the recipe with the caper brine-- my substitutions/omissions probably made it a 4.
this was an easy/quick recipe that was very tasty.  i served the shrimp with polenta (grits) -- i cook my polenta with chicken broth instead of water  -- my low fat version of shrimp and grits   ; )  -- i think turkey bacon might have been a nice addition to the grits in this recipe.

i substituted:
- almond oil for olive oil (very good)!
- tobasco sauce for red pepper flakes (personal preference)
- omitted caper brine (didn't have it.. wish i did.. i think this
   would have been a really good ingredient.
- parsley flakes for parsley (didn't have fresh parsley on hand)

Everyone loved it!  You do have to love garlic for this dish!  I made this according to Chef John.  It was quick and easy.  The prep took the longest, and I bought by mistake smaller shrimp so the cleaning took a good amount of time.  I will definitely make this again, maybe even for appetizers.  It will surely keep the vampires away!

This was delicious! I used green olive oil liquid since I didn’t have capers handy. Best shrimp I’ve ever made and I followed the directions exactly. I make some capellini and tossed it in olive oil, salt and garlic and put the shrimp on top for my husband. I’m trying to watch my carbs so I put mine on top of some cooked cauliflower rice. I’ll definitely make this again!

I made this for the third time tonight. We LOVE it. Although, today was the first time I didn’t use caper brine and used an extra tablespoon of lemon and I much prefer it this way. I also never use parsley in any of my dishes. For me, there was no need to add water at the end.

Yum! I cook for one and don't trust left over seafood, so I modify this recipe. I've found it always turns out great, even if I just wing it without measuring the ingredients. I never have fresh parsley, so I skip it or use dried. I serve this over couscous and it's a perfect meal!

One of our favourite recipes.  We make it without caper brine because we never remember to buy some, and this is a really good recipe on days when you don't have a lot of time (ie: can't make it back to the store). Is REALLY good served on Chef John's Brutus Salad

Very easy and tasty. Added a bit cooking wine and horse radish (hubby said it needed a kick-we like spicy food).

Wow! This was delicious, easy to prepare and my family loved it! I added fresh baby spinach leaves and served it over fettuccine. Will be on the look out for another sale on shrimp in the market!

I am not a shrimp eater but I made this recipe for my husband and he loved it.   Prep the ingredients first because it moves quickly.  I bought a small container of capers and drained off some brine, and squeezed a fresh lemon vs. using bottled.  I only used 1/2# shrimp and kept the sauce as written.  It was a lot of liquid but I thought better too saucy than dry.  Definitely a keeper for him!

This was delish. Prep everything ahead of time. I used the caper brine but skipped the red pepper flakes. If putting over a pound of spaghetti, double or triple the butter sauce.

I was looking for something simple and this was just the ticket.  I added a little more butter.  Had it over rice.  Delicious!  Only trick is to have all your ingredients ready.  It happens pretty fast!

It turned out ok but I feel like the recipe requires a little bit more butter because my shrimp felt dry also I added to much salt to my shrimp on accident this recipe is defenitly a challenge because you have to be careful with the seasonings and use more butter than attended or else it will be dry

Very easy and tasty, but me being a bit fussy I made a tiny bit of stock out of the heads and shells and used that instead of the water and I used fish sauce instead of the salt just to boost the seafoody flavour.

This was a quick and easy recipe to make - and delicious.  I did use a little white wine to thin the butter instead of the water, otherwise I made the recipe as written.  I served over angel hair pasta and some fresh diced tomatoes on the side.  This will be a keeper as it so easy to make and pulled together at the last minute.  Thanks Chef John!

This was delicious.  It tastes like restaurant quality.  I was trying to mimic my favorite Japanese Hibachi restaurant-- and this did it!  I didn't know what caper brine was - so did not add that.  I may try that next time-- but was good without it.  I also did a version w/bourbon seasoning on the shrimp and it was excellent.

I thought this was very good, but my husband wasn't as pleased (turns out he doesn't like shrimp).  I thought it had just enough spice to give it a little zing.  I started boiling the water for the pasta I served it with at the same time I started cooking the shrimp.  That was a mistake.  Because the shrimp cooked so quickly, it over-cooked while keeping it warm until the pasta was done.

Chef John comes through again! Good flavors simple is always best. I did add a little (couple of tablespoons) liquid (chicken stock) to extend the sauce. I don't think I broke the rating rules with that.

I followed instructions except for the caper brine.  I just added extra salt. I served over angel hair pasta with fresh lemon thyme.  My son has added it to his top five favorites!

I really liked this recipe. Although i didn't have the caper brine, it was still great! I bought the shrimp pre peeled and deveined and only added a little extra butter and red flakes. Next time ill make sure to buy the caper brine to see the difference!

I followed the recipe then added it in with spaghetti.  Then broiled it quickly with a panko/butter mixture on top.  I also used more garlic than suggested.

Was kind of disappointed with all the great reviews. I followed recipe exactly and served over angel hair pasta. It lacked flavor. It wasn't terrible, but nothing to write home about.  I would add more salt, butter, and capers. Maybe that would help.

Very tasty, but not enough sauce.  I put it over spaghetti.  Not sure if I did something wrong, or what I can do in future to increase the amount of sauce.

This was delicious! The family loved it. I only made one substitution. I didn't have capers so I used red wine vinegar instead. It worked beautifully.

I'm crazy about this.  It is easy to adjust to your tastes.  I just threw in a bunch of capers because I didn't want to leave capers in the jar without enough juice to cover them.  It worked out great.

Made it exactly, except the butter was an herb butter. The only problem is that hubby and I were sad they were gone!  Making again this weekend.

It was very good. Didn't have capers, used olive juice as someone suggested. And I had to use canned minced garlic which isn't quite the same, but we like garlic any which way. Probably would have been better with fresh garlic. Served over rice.

I made this recipe exactly as stated.  Absolutely delicious.  Wouldn't change a thing and thought how wonderful this sauce would be over a bed of pasta with the shrimp on any other seafood.  Beautiful!

No red pepper flakes. My wife is super sensitive to spicy heat.  Caper brine was a great add.  (And a new item for me to play with on other things).  Everyone loved it!

I have made this twice and can tell you that your only hope here is portion control.  I served it over pasta.  The second time I parboiled broccoli florets for about 5 minutes and added them when I added the shrimp.  I also used a chopped up dried Thai chili for the red pepper flakes and found the spice to be just about right.  This is a great recipe.

Followed the recipe except added a few capers and white wine instead of water. Served with pasta that was put in the sauce for a couple minutes and shrimp was then added back in.  A definite keeper!.  Hubby loved it!!!  Thinking of doing this with chicken!

These are beyond delicious and the puddles of butter sauce wonderful to pair w pasta, rice or cauliflower in (we are doing keto now.)  We have made it 4-5 times.  Great if you want a different twist on gambas al ajillo.
Do not fear the caper brine, it just adds an unknown subtle zest and is essential!!  Chef John never disappoints.

Chef John is right.   Have all your ingredients at hand!  this was the last item I made , so it went from skillet directly to the table with wild rice and a salad.  Will definitely do this one again, and glad I had the caper juice.  It adds a little " something"

Flavor was very good, but it was a lot of work!  Too many steps for the payoff.  Served it over rice, but there wasn't much sauce for three people.  It is an improvement over traditional scampi because of the lemon juice and caper brine, but, again, lots of steps.

This was delicious! I made it with frozen shrimp which added the liquid and without caper brine because I didn't have any.  I added a little white wine instead. But my family scarfed it up! Nothing leftover! This one goes into the rotation!

Lenten season is almost over, I was running out of non meat recipes. This recipe is easy to follow and is so very delicious. I served it with steamed rice and everyone loved it. I'll be doubling the recipe next time. Thank you for the recipe.

This was a hit in our family! I did change a couple things: I didn't have capers, so I added a blop (between 2 & 3 tsp) of dijon mustard AND...a whole stick of butter. I wanted to make sure there was a little sauce for the pasta. The sauce would have been dreamy on some good bread if I weren't gluten intolerant! I followed the rest of the recipe.

Definately a keeper. My husband loved the lemony taste and the chili gave it just the right amount of kick. I did add a little bit more butter.

This was pretty simple and certainly quick enough. For my tastes I will cut back on the lemon juice to only 2Tbs. Using the caper brine I will not add any additional salt as recommended by the recipe. 
I served the shrimp on a bed of Rotini pasta with a generous helping of the sauce  spooned over the shrimp.
I highly recommend serving with a garlic toast. I also served steamed zuchini spears. Very good meal and I will definitely serve it up again.

Super easy and delicious....maybe I made too much jasmine rice to go along with it but i'll need to double the sauce at the end to really make this a winner for me.

WOW!!! All the five star ratings for this simple recipe are justified. The recipe is simple and is vastly better than ANY restaurant garlic shrimp. The only variation I made to the recipe was that I used 9 cloves of garlic instead of six. I love garlic! The caper brine is an absolute must as it combines with all the other ingredients to somehow make the dish DELICIOUS. The caper brine brings a sourness that is wonderful. I will make this recipe again and again.

Super easy, quick, and tasty.  The sauce was a bit too lemony for my family's taste, so we added a little extra butter and water and then thickened the sauce.

I use butter ghee instead of butter because it doesn't burn like butter but gives the same taste as butter.  I also use fresh garlic minced up in small chunks. The  red pepper and capers are added last thing which I toss into the pasta, just prior to serving, This so simple to make but tastes so decadent

Scrumptious!! When I didn't have a called-for ingredient, I just used what I had on hand: avocado oil, frozen shrimp, dried parsley, 1 tablespoonful of minced garlic from a jar; I also added my "go-to" McCormick California Style Coarse Grind Blend Garlic Powder with Parsley. Put this over slice of Truckee sourdough bread.

Yum! This was some of the most delicious shrimp I've ever had, let alone made! I followed the recipe exactly the first time and it was perfect. The second time I was out of caper brine (used it all the first time!) and used a little green olive brine. It seemed to work. it was still really good. I want to make this over and over again! Thanks for a great recipe!

Really good, though kind of stressful to make because of all the 1 minute pauses between steps.  You have to watch the clock really carefully, and there's not that much room for error.   Also, I like to double the red pepper, which gives me a nice heat, but that's not for everyone.

It tasted great but, for some reason, the sauce separated. I tried adding some flour, which didn't really help. I was able to smooth it out with some water. Overall, I thought the recipe was a bit fussy, but I would make it again in hopes of getting it right the next time.

As a first timer with shrimp I overcooked mine slightly which made them a little tough but the flavor was superb.

I didn't have any caper brine, but otherwise made it as written.  Served over fettuccine. It was delicious, quick and easy to make. Kids asked me to put this one into the rotation.

I didn't have red pepper flakes so I used cayenne pepper instead. The sauce left over was divine! Plated shrimp atop of brown rice, poured leftover sauce on top of shrimp. Lovely presentation! This dish is in rotation at my house! It is necessary to prep as cook time goes by very fast!

I cut the amount of garlic in half because while I love garlic my family... Well not so much. I cooked some bacon bits and added them to the sauce. I will definitely make it again. The flavor was amazing

This dish was simpy delish!  The only changes I made were to increase the garlic to 8 bulbs and, in place of water, I used white wine.  Talk about delicious!  We had family staying over the Christmas holidays and everyone raved about that dish.  I served it over rice.  This recipe is a keeper!

Simple as the name might imply...and delicious. Do not pass this one up. Chef John has made an outstanding dish. Easy enough for a busy work evening and better than anything at a restaurant. I followed all directions explicitly and the results were superb.

OMG,  so very delicious & easy to prepare......looks pretty, too.
I used 1 full ball of garlic,  1/2 tsp red flakes, &, so that we would have more "sauce",  I doubled  the liquids. Don't be afraid to add a bit of water to the sauce while simmering & pay attention to those shrimp......they cook quickly & should never be overlooked.  3 mins max total.
 The capers brine is a MUST, as it gives this recipe its distinctive taste. I served it with thin spaghetti & shaved Parmesan. 
Thanks for this great recipe!

Yummy! I changed a couple of things, added some capers along with the brine, and added the lemon juice at the end, as I don't like the taste of cooked lemon in savory dishes.

Terrific! My 13 year old daughter said "this is so good!" from the first bite.  I always follow recipes but didn't have capers on hand so like others, I also used olive juice.  That worked really well but I look forward to cooking it properly.  I also used cooked shrimp because it was what was on hand.  Surprisingly this was still delicious!  One of the best recipes thus far!

This is great as is with no alterations.  The only variance I have used is the accompaniment.  My favorite so far is blanched zoodles and baguettes.

This was really yummy and came together easily.  I used “cooked shrimp” which I had thawed and drained. I put the garlicin the oil then laid shrimp on top.  I cooked it about 1 minute with the garlic before stirring & adding lemon juice, wine, butter & parseley. It was super fast & scrumptious. I served it on linguini with fresh shredded Assagio cheese. Still licking my lips!!!

Pretty tasty recipe. I omitted the caper brine (didn't have any on hand) and added an extra tablespoon of lemon juice. Also, at the end I added seeded and finely chopped tomato and chopped green onion. Served the shrimp with sauted veggies on the side. Next time, the shrimp and sauce will be served on top of pasta which should be even yummier.

Yum, will make it again.  If you want to kick it up a notch, add a tablespoon of brandy or cognac and ignite it at the end.

its always Yummy when I dish this up,-  I  take the tails off if the Shrimps go on Toast,  - its easier to consume . If we eat them by hands I will let the tails as 'handles'  attached...... :-)  and instead of Parsley I use Chives......finger licking  pleasure !!!!

I added capers because we love capers and served with white rice. I feel like a splash of white wine would be good in the sauce. Serve the sauce as soon as you take it off the heat- it separates. I used pre cooked shrimp and just cooked them for a couple minutes before taking them out and setting aside.

Fabulous recipe! Didn't have parsley on hand , but still wonderful; best shrimp recipe I've tried yet. Caper brine and lemon juice work really well together. The amount of butter in video looks like much more than in recipe, but still delicious. Served with pasta and roasted tomato sauce. Yum! Thanks, Chef John.

I served with Rice Pilaf and added extra garlic. I always add extra garlic with everything though. Ive tried it a few times and it came out great however I doubled it once and it wasn't the same.

I didn't have the parsley and replaced it with cilantro. I also added a bit more garlic since my family loves garlic. I served it over a white flavorful rice . Absolutely delicious.

Wow, Chef John you nailed it.  So simple, so so tasty and perfect on top of a bed of spaghettini......please, anyone reading this review, please do NOT cut down on the garlic and be sure your garlic is fresh and your parsley is fresh and your lemon juice is fresh squeezed...this is the key. I had jumbo uncooked shrimp in the freezer that I used and they could not have been any better. I will be making this recipe many many more times and I may even INCREASE the amount of garlic!! Thanks again chef!

Delicious, easy, and goes with anything (rice, pasta, potatoes). Stick to the exact steps when cooking, it makes all the difference so that the shrimp absorbs all those yummy flavors. Enjoy!

I am a super novice cook, so I didn't have anything prepared before I started this recipe and quickly realized this was going to be a mad dash to make this work. All of the smoke detectors in my house were going off by the end, but, I'll tell you what, this is a dang good recipe.

This was quick and easy. I didn't have pepper flakes, so I used a small amount of chili powder. I used a minimal amount of brine and only 3 garlic cloves. lots of flavour.

This was just delicious! The only changes I made was decrease the butter and I used lime juice because I didn't have lemons on hand. I love tart and sour flavors so this was a hit  (for one!) I kind of winged most of the measurements so again, it came out spicier than most like. I just found it to have a great flavor despite exact measurements.  I served this over quinoa. Amazing! Can't wait to make it again for friends.

Easy with an excellent taste! Served with grated Parmesan cheese over angel hair pasta and garlic knots. The second time I made it, I added 1/2 C-1/2 & 1/2 and 1/2 C grated Parmesan cheese at the last part of cooking for more of an Alfredo sauce; Either way, it was delicious.

This is good, quick easy  recipe.  I like to use a bit more butter to make a sauce to pour over rice/pasta that I serve with the shrimp.

It was amazing! The most delicious recipe so far I have made from this website. The garlic flavor mixed with the caper sauce was absolutely a winner!!!! ????????

The whole family loved this.  I served it over a wild rice blend with steamed carrots on the side.  Do NOT be tempted to skip the caper brine - it totally made the dish in my opinion.  Chef John's advice (in the video) to have all of your ingredients prepped and ready ahead of time was also an important step.  Once I had everything laid out, this was on the table in minutes.  This one's going into the keeper file. Thanks again Chef John!

The only thing I didn't add was caper brine because I didn't have any, Other than that i followed the recipe and it was delicious. We make these with red lobsters cheddar bay biscuits and it was a hit! Even my daughter that's a picky eater asks for this meal. Pairs well with a glass of wine. Thanks Chef John!

I found this a few months ago but it became such a favorite.  I got so addicted that I made 3 times over the next 6 weeks!   I didn't change a thing and agree the caper brine should not be eliminated.  I did have to use the lime in the plastic container but it was fine.  I'd rather have it than not because fresh was not available.

I didn't make any changes, I followed the video carefully.     Honestly, I cannot believe the few reviews that claim it lacks flavor, and one reviewer claimed the cooking time was too long.  They must have done it wrong. This recipe is very easy to follow, and the shrimp is cooked in about five minutes--not at all too long to cook shrimp,  (I use the 16-20 count shrimp).  My family loves this dish; my husband said it's better than restaurants make.

I don't give many 5 stars out but this was so good! IF you like lots of garlic! I didn't change anything with this recipe, although I think my garlic cloves were pretty big.  I served it over a salad with a room temperature garlic olive oil and vinegar dressing. Yum!

Seriously one of the best shrimp meals I have made. So simple but I found one issue, need to double the recipe...went too fast to take picture. Love the brine! I threw in a bit of white wine instead of water ??

Very delicious and extremely simple to make, I did use the caper brine, but did not have any lemon juice so I used a bit of lemon pepper, turned out great.

It was pretty  tasty, really liked the idea of using caper brine.  I didn't have any parsley so I added capers.  The sauce is delicious and easy, I served the shrimp over capellini.  I'll try it again with the parsley and see how that is.

Served as an app at a Father's day get together for 18. I only made one little change and added a dry white wine to the sauce mix to make it more of a scampi. Turned out delicious. It disappeared. I should have bought more shrimp! We will definately be adding this to our regular app line up.

Made this for the first time last week and WOW!!  This is fabulous.  I am actually going to make it again tomorrow for Father's Day along with King Crab.  I did exactly like the video and had all the ingredients ready which is a must as this goes super fast.  Like 4 min or so. Thank you Chef John.  Keep up your delicious recipes along with your videos.

This was restaurant quality shrimp dish.  I followed the recipe exactly even the caper brine.  Chef John never disappoints.   Amazingly I had every ingredient on hand.  First time I have cooked shrimp as I don't eat it but my husband loves shrimp.  He gave the dish 5 stars.  He  finished the sauce with a piece of bread.  Served with Chef John's Acorn Squash recipe.  Will make this again.

Delightfully flavorful and simple -- as long as you measure the ingredients all beforehand.  I subbed some pickle juice for the caper juice.  So pleased that I managed to not burn the garlic!  Hubby loved it.

I made it as written with a heavy hand on the garlic and red pepper flakes. It was absolutely awesome!   My whole family says it's better than in a high-end restaurant and I have to agree.

This is a definite keeper! Don't leave out the caper brine it adds a dimension to the flavor profile. The only thing I changed was to add white wine instead of water. It was yummy and quick and easy!

Followed the recipe to a T except for using dried parsley as that was  all I had.  Make sure to follow suggestions to have all supplies  lined up before you begin cooking.  Actual cooking goes very fast and there is no time to stop and mince garlic or get out a forgotten ingredient.  I made this with a salad I had made ahead and baked potatoes  so all I had to do at the last minute was  concentrate on the shrimp and pull the potatoes out.  A scrumptious recipe!

Yum! This was super easy and fast. We used 2 lbs of frozen (thawed) peeled & de-veined shrimp. Then we took a little longer with each step, used just slightly less of each ingedient (doubled), and sprinkled it with dry instead of fresh parsley. Slam dunk. My picky family couldn't get enough, and it was done in

Made this recipe last night and everyone loved it! I followed the recipe exactly except I couldn't find caper brine at the store so I substituted some Riesling instead. I used the large 13-16 per lb shrimp and it turned out great. Fresh garlic is a must (don't use the jarred stuff). Will definitely be making this again.

Awesome recipe. I garnish steak with chives rather than harshly. I use the same recipe to make tilapia and salmon! Came out great every time!

Made this tonight and it was excellent!  My husband is extremely picky and only wanted "salt, pepper, and garlic", so I had to hide what I added (used a little cumin instead of red pepper flakes).  I do think the caper brine add that little umph and worked nicely with the lemon juice.  Thank you for sharing!

Love this. It is a good meal that can be table ready quickly.I added a lettuce salad and french bread and we were ready to eat. I did omit the caper brine because my husband dislikes the flavor.

Besides shelling and deveining shrimp which is always a bit arduous, this is super easy and tasty! So easy that it makes up for the shrimp prep.  I think I over cooked my shrimp a bit though trying to add ingredients in varied stages like it recommends. Next time I'll be faster about tossing things in.  If I have to I'll just throw stuff in before I've let it cook for another minute.

This was absolutely delicious. I did made some modifications because I find lemon can be too tart, especially when adding brine juice to it too; which can make it very sour.  So I added more butter and  1/4 teaspoon of sugar.. problem fixed!  I hope this helps anyone out there :) . Also, you can achieve the same "garlic infused oil" with low temperature as well. If you don't feel comfortable at sauteing garlic in high temperature, just do it on low heat. OR remove the frying pan from the stove, let it stand for a couple of seconds.. and add the garlic to it.

I was a little liberal with red pepper flakes but it added a nice bite.     I will make it again & again & again.

I loved this recipe.  Made it just as the instructions said because I did not want to overcook the shrimp. I just made sure my ingredients were ready to add when instructed and the shrimp was cooked just right. I added this over pasta and it was so good! I like my shrimp with just enough kick and this was it!

Fantastic! Simple! Easy! I just started making my own sauces thanks to All Recipes and I cannot believe how simple and easy this recipe is. The sauce is amazing! I had left over shrimp from another recipe I got off here and decided to try this. This sauce and/or dish can be easily and quickly made during the week or as a dinner to  impress friends, significant other etc. You'll be a hit! Enjoy!

I didn't have caper brine, but used a little green olive juice and it turned out great. I served it over spaghetti noodles and topped it off with a little mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. My very picky husband LOVED it! Next time I will accompany it with some garlic bread and sauteed veggies for a tasty and surprisingly filling meal.

I never used caper brine before, but I will be adding it to some more recipes soon! This recipe was mouthwatering from start to finish. The brine added a perfect flavor to the garlic and I can never complain when my house smells that good from cooking. And, it was such a quick and easy recipe that I can whip up whenever. Great recipe thank you!

I was in a hurry and so didn't do anything past cooking the shrimp.  The recipe said to take them out and make a sauce.  I just did the beginning of the recipe then put the pan on the table to dish out of.  So yummy!!  My hubby and boys, 9 and 6, loved them too.  Will definitely make again for regular dinner and for something to impress company.

I did not have any caper brine so left that out.  I quartered and added mushrooms after taking the shrimp out.  Let them saute a couple of min then pulled them out to join the shrimp.  After finishing the sauce added both shrimp and mushrooms back in the skillet.  I simply spooned this over a steak cooked rare and served with asparagus.  Perfect dinner.

I added lemon zest along with the lemon.  Very good dish.  Key is in NOT over cooking it.

This was EXCELLENT!!!  My fiancé who is picky about shrimp (typically only eats it at Japanese restaurants) really enjoyed it to.  I made it exactly as indicated in the recipe.  This will be on our dinner rotation!

This was soooo yummy.  I did make some changes only because I was serving it over angel hair pasta and was worried that the pasta would be dry. What I did was add about a cup of chicken broth at the end. I also added some fresh spinach after I put the chicken broth in only to add some greens to the meal.
It came out perfectly well. I would like to try it again and try it over toast like he did in the video. My family really enjoyed it.

I made this recipe exactly the way Chef John stated except no caper brine so i used Mediterranean  olive brine instead.... Let me tell you me and my hubby  could barely talk while eating these shrimp, THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD!!!  I will never make shrimp any other way EVER!!!  Oh and that butter sauce we had garlic bread and crab cakes too.. tasted great as a dip for the bread &  crab...

Made exactly per recipe including the caper brine & it was amazing good. My only change would be to use less butter in the final sauce. It was so rich with all that butter!  Served it with Red Lobster biscuits from a boxed mis. Wow.....

This was so good! I made it for friends that came over for dinner  last night. Harold is a foodie and he asked how I made it. If you knew Harold, you would know how big a compliment that was! This was easy to make and I will be making this for my family and my friends often.

Great recipe! Followed it almost to the "t". I did not have the caper juice on hand (and I realize that Chef John said that is what put this recipe over the top) but I, and my family, thought it was outrageously good, and simple to make I might add! It is true that having everything ready before hand is critical and helped to make it so easy.  I might consider a bit less butter next time as it seemed unnecessary to have so much and it made it very rich.  Will be going to this recipe again. Thanks Chef John!

Delicious!  The shrimp really shined.  I used a Meyer Lemon for the juice.  Served it over French baguette to soak up the saucy goodness.  Mmm.

I followed the directions, all the ingredients were fresh.  I did add 1/2 cup less then of white wine as suggested by one review.  All I can say is that it was bland.  I wondered if having the shrimp marinade for a while before cooking would have helped.  I love my shrimp and I will not be making this again.

I've made a few scampi type dishes on this site and this was my favorite by far.  I followed the recipe exactly (except a little less parsley...didn't want to freak out my kids).  It had a great flavor.  I've never eaten anything flavored by caper brine but it did give it an unusual flavor.  We all really enjoyed it, including my kids.

I am not a huge shrimp or seafood fan but my husband is, so I thought I would try this and it was absolutely FANTASTIC!!
I did not have the caper brine so Improvised with a little more lemon juice and water. I told my daughters about it who love shrimp and I printed out and shared the recipe. This is great and simple!!

Galic fan here, so I enjoyed this.  Do make sure you have everything prepped.   A minute flies by so you want to be ready.

I think I had too much oil in the pan.  After removing the shrimp there was still a lot of oil/butter mix in the pan.

Other than that, very easy to make and tasty as well.

Quite quick and easy although the very large shrimp I bought at Whole Foods netted 14 pcs. total, only enough for two.
It was delicious but did not need as much parsley and felt a tad confused by the butter amounts listed as there wasn't that much sauce at the end to pour over top.  It was served with a vegetarian casserole which made a rather nice, healthy meal if one does not count the butter!    Thanks to Chef John for always supplying us with interesting and tasty recipes to try.

I made it as directed, but w/pre-cooked shrimp, so the cooking time was naturally less.  I got inspired and mixed the shrimp with the Brazilian Rice recipe, and added some green onions and more salt. Usually I cook rice only for oriental dishes, so this is an unusual taste for me. Next time I make these shrimp, I'm throwing them in Fried Rice!

So, so good. The step-by-step instructions were great. We made a cream sauce, too: sautéed four fat cloves of garlic (MORE garlic!!!!) in a tablespoon of butter in a saucepan, added about a cup of whipping cream, about a quarter of a Brie cheese (sliced up), reduced that, then added the sauce from the shrimp concoction & a smattering of shredded Parmesan. Ate it with asparagus sautéed in butter & lemon & a bit of sesame oil & with baby Bella mushrooms sautéed in the asparagus leftover oil with a lot more sesame oil. It was one of the most delicious meals we've ever had, at home or anywhere.

Excellent as written!   My husband, 12 and 14 year old boys, and my 87 year old father raved about!  They said it was a restaurant quality meal.  High praise!

This is one of our favorite ways to cook shrimp.  We usually make as a compliment to rib eye steak.  We love capers so we usually throw in a tablespoon or two along with the brine. We probably made this a few dozen times.  Another fabulous recipe from Chef John!

What a great and simple recipe.  I live in wine country in CA and when friends came to visit we went wine tasting.  We came back with some wonderful bottles of brew.  I whipped up this recipe, using a little more olive oil and butter to create a more saucy sauce for angel hair pasta, added the capers along with its liquid, a little chopped red bell pepper for color, big crusty French bread, tossed green salad and  of course  a wonderful bottle (or 2) of Paso's Sauvignon Blanc.   I set a bowl of cut up lemons and a bowl of freshly grated Parmesan on the side to add as wanted by my guests.  Voila a perfect post wine tasting day.   Chef John you did it again!!

This recipe was fantastic! I did not have capers, so the brine was omitted, but other than that the recipe turned out fantastic.

Have made this several times . . . Even added a bit more garlic!  Chef John is my go to for just about any recipe.  But I digress.  This shrimp is to DIE  for, and couldn't get any easier to make.  A great meal to impress any guest!

Make this all the time, without caper brine or butter. It's just old fashioned Italian shrimp and we serve it cold. Shrimp, lots of Garlic, Olive Oil, Lemon juice and Parsley. (Italians don't measure anything.)  Voila!!

Made recipe pretty much as is - added a little white wine and at the end about another 1 1/2 T butter to make enough sauce to put on angel hair pasta.   Dish was terrific and the leftover shrimp the next day were great with a salad. I will make and leave out the extra butter when just want the shrimp - and add the butter and maybe a little vegetable stock to have a a little more sauce to serve over pasta.  Absolutely will be making this again and again.

Excellent recipe.  Go to the store for capers...the difference it makes is worth the trip.  We love garlic, so we doubled it.  Super fast & delicious.  We took the tails off the shrimp first and served them with angel hair pasta and an asian salad.

Something this easy shouldn't taste this good!!! Everyone absolutely LOVED it! The prep work only took a few minutes as far as getting the ingredients together, and it  was just so easy to make, I know I'll be having this again soon! A truly impressive recipe.

Very very good! I didn't imagine they had turned so terrific. I used less garlic and only one little piece of dried chili. I didn't make the sauce cause the shrimps were seasoned enough. Thank you for this easy and good receip!!

This is one of my favorite recipes- I've made it several times. I triple the sauce recipe since the pasta dries out fast- especially for leftovers the next day. When I run out of caper brine, I'll cut up some capers to use and add olive brine instead, but caper brine is best, of course.  I often make it without shrimp- it's a great simple and delicious pasta dish!

As I had both shrimp and scallops on hand, I added both to the pan.  The shrimp were good, but we both preferred the scallops.  I think that next time, I'll add some cubes of fresh salmon as well.

I doubled the sauce, and tossed some cooked linguine in the pan just before serving.  Amazing!

Fantastic. Next time add twice the amount of chili and just use the small amount of butter. Cooking time is correct. Instead of the caper brine I have used gherkins brine. Cook it less time.

I spooned this over 1" rib-eyes for a surf-and-turf dinner and it worked well. I chopped fresh green onion from my green house instead of parsley. Keeping this as a favorite!

I'll definitely make this again. I didn't have parsley or caper brine, I used pickled garlic and used the brine from it instead. Next time I will plan ahead to make sure I have all the ingredients.

I skipped the caper brine and red pepper flakes and this was still delicious. It really is such a simple recipe for something so good. My boyfriend and I are both slightly lactose intolerant, so we put less butter than the recipe said to, so don't be afraid to experiment a bit with changing amounts of some things to fit your taste. If you don't have all the ingredients, I'd say the most essential are salt, garlic, lemon juice, butter, and parsley.

Excellent, used precooked shrimp. Would've been better with fresh garlic (not jar) and fresh parsley (not dried). However that's all I had and it was wonderful! Caper brine really made a difference!!

YUMMMMMM!!!!! oh this is GOOD!  I didn't have caper brine (not sure why I drained my capers) but just used about 1 or 2 tsp of capers.  Other than that, the recipe was the same.  DELICIOUS!

Be sure to prep everything before cooking. I think next time I'll prep everything, then cook all sides, and cook shrimp last. Our shrimp got cold while I was finishing up other dishes. It cooked VERY fast.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was so tasty and delicious!  I used fresh ground sea salt to taste.  You don't want to skimp on the garlic or parsley, and the caper brine is a must.  A side of steamed brocoli and some warm crusty french bread and you have a  wonderful dinner.

The slight hint of red pepper combined with the tang of the lemon and saltiness of the capers compliment the sweetness of the shrimp PERFECTLY.   Absolutely DELISH and truly "finger licking good"!

This recipe had such great flavor to it! We steamed broccoli and mixed everything together and it was a perfect meal. We didn't have capers so I went without it, but kept everything else the same. Can't wait to make it again!!

We very much enjoyed this. I served this with angel-haired pasta. If I do that again, then I will AT LEAST double the sauce.

I omitted the parsley, but I always do.

Just made this for dinner tonight and got rave reviews from everyone.  I did not have caper brine but would like to try it. Used a touch of white wine instead.  The shrimp were perfectly cooked and we dipped fresh baguette  into the sauce.  YUM!

Originally scaled back on garlic (used 5 gloves instead of six), and while it tasted amazing, I think it would have been just fine if not better with 6 gloves as the recipe called for. Otherwise, didn't change a thing and the recipe was great just as it is. Highly recommend. So easy too, but you have to prep all the ingredients beforehand.

Whoa, I consider this to be a slightly advanced cooking method that I can't believe turned out great for us!  After adding the garlic and then the lemon and caper liquids, the garlic quickly burned to black in my pan so I scooped the shrimp out of there as quick as I could and then added the forgotten butter.  Wow so yummy!  I did watch the video first and had the premeasured ingrediants on hand but cooking time was super fast!

I didn't have the caper brine so I used White Wine instead. It was still very good but I think the caper brine would be amazing. The shrimp cooked too fast to make the sauce together so I had to remove the shrimp before the directions stated to avoid overcooking them. I will make this again.

This was awesome. I served it over quinoa because we don't eat much bread, but otherwise I did everything just like it said. I don't know exactly how it would have served four as my husband and I cleaned up every bit just between the two of us, but it's definitely a keeper for me.

Excellent... Don't skimp on the ingredients. Caper brine was great.  Will add more pepper flakes next time just because my friend smokes and can't taste it as well..  I thought this recipe carried itself beautifully.  Served it over well buttered lightly peppered angel hair pasta.  Great quick lunch on a Saturday.  (have never given a recipe a 5 star on the first try)

Deeeelish!  Skipped the caper brine and it was still great!  I marinated the shrimp in a tablespoon of chopped garlic and a 1/4 tsp of cayenne since we love heat. Served with a side of roasted Brussel Sprouts, carrots and zucchini. My family said "This is like having a meal at a fancy restaurant without getting dressed up and going!"  And in less than 30 minutes!  Thanks for sharing this!

I normally make my sauces with 1/2 & 1/2 & wine, but was eager to try this. It was absolutely delish!  used Trader Joe"s Large wild caught shrimp & added the actual capers, some onions, a splash of soy sauce & Chef Paul's Vegetable Magic. Crazy good!!

Made a couple of  changes. I didn't have fresh parsley. A tablespoon of dried did the trick. Also used olive juice but I will make it worth caper brine next time. Absolutely fantastic. Wife and I BOTH thought it was fantastic. Will definitely make again, a keeper.

My family loved it!  (and I have picky eaters).  I followed the recipe exactly, including the caper brine.  It definitely had a "kick" from the red pepper flakes.  I think the next time I make it I will skip the second pat of butter in the sauce as the shrimp had plenty of awesome flavor and half the butter would make it a little healthier (although it was a very healthy dish) - - just found I didn't need the additional sauce (personal and family preferene). Served over angel hair pasta.  It was scrumptious!  Thanks Chef John!  Another winner

I thought this was great. I'll admit, I've never tried to make this before or anything to do with shrimp. but all the strong ratings made me try it out. I followed all the ingredients, but maybe not to a "T". I eyeballed everything because I had some other things on the go and I was a bit flustered lol. I will make this again, and maybe try to use this as some sort of pasta butter sauce.

Out of this world delicious!  Be careful not to overcook the shrimp -- I should have taken mine out of the pan about 30 seconds before I did.  But the dish was still wonderful.  I served it with yellow saffron rice, salad, and French bread with olive oil and Italian spices for dipping.

I made exactly as directed and wish I had purchased two pounds of shrimp because I could have easily scared down two servings! I agree with previous reviewers on the caper brine. Try not to skip it because it adds and extra tangy flavor that lemon juice alone doesn't have. Bonus is this was very fast to prepare so have your ingredients pre prepared so the shrimp dont overcook. Will make again!

We all loved this dish.  Simple to make and great flavor.  We poured the shrimp and sauce over angel hair pasta, mixed it and served with steamed vegetables.  We will definitely use this recipe again.

This recipe is simple and it tastes very good.  We like things "saucy", so I doubled the ingredients for the sauce, served over angel hair pasta using some of the pasta water to increase the amount of sauce.  Very tasty dish!

Easy! I highly recommend watching the video, though. This was easier than the video made is seem because it felt like timing was critical - but in the end, it was easy! I didn't have the caper brine!!! so I will find occasion to try this again... visually beautiful and super-delicious and easy. Go for it! This is tops by far for shrimp.

I made this recipe last night for dinner and just found it to be bland.  I know it takes a lot of garlic, and we LOVE garlic, but it just did not taste as good as the picture looked.  I also overcooked the shrimp because the sauce would not thicken as I had hoped.  Thank you for sharing your recipe with us.

Made these tonight for dinner. They were awesome!  The only problem was that I did not make 2 pounds of shrimp instead of  1 to have leftovers.  I will be making these again for sure.

Made it just as written.  very good and I can taste the  caper brine. I have never used a recipe that called for it.  Now that I have  tasted it I will be looking for those type of recipes.The only thing I have a daughter is to sauté the garlic some wet before the shrimp. I do have some crunchy garlic in my dish. It did not change the flavor or alter  the dish it just  would've been much better with completely cooked garlic.

For a cooking temp this high, this is WAY WAY too long to cook shrimp! They will only turn out tough and rubbery! But a good recipe other than that!

Absolutely awesome and very easy to make. I'm always leery of cooking seafood at home and, especially, shrimp. This recipe resulted in the perfect texture for the shrimp and the flavor was beyond wonderful. Definitely a dish to show off your culinary skills.

I didn't have lemon juice so I used lime juice. It was delicious. I will definitely have this again. I might add some parmesan cheese next time.

I was out of lemon juice, but had lime so I substituted and it came out delicious.  Just enough heat to give it a little spice.  If you like really spicy, you can add more pepper flake.  I served this with Jasmine rice and fresh steamed broccoli.

Yummmmmm!!!  No leftovers, but considered saving the leftover sauce from plates... Didn't have caper brine or lemon juice, so I added some pickle juice and white cooking wine.  Pickle juice?  I know... but was absolutely delicious.  The red pepper flakes and parsley are a must.  I served over angel hair pasta with a side of balsamic honey-glazed green beans.

Great recipe for garlic shrimp!  Be careful about the cook times -  don't take the 1 minute time intervals too seriously. Shrimp over cook quickly!  I reduced the sauce with white wine instead of water and served over wild rice.  This will be a staple shrimp dish in my home.

I passed on the red pepper flakes, but did add some capers, since the recipe already included the brine. The result was OK, but the sauce was way too salty. My guess is that the caper brine was the culprit. I had salted the shrimp at the beginning as instructed, but, Wow!

Awesome!!  Added some water after removing shrimp and sautéed some broccoli in the sauce.  Served the shrimp on toasted baguette slice with broccoli alongside... Scrumptious!!  Can't wait to entertain with this recipe!  Thanks!

This was fantastic!!! I will definitely make again, since I absolutely love capers I threw those in along with the brine. The brine is a must! I think this would be fantastic with pasta although I had it with rice which was great. This will be a go to recipe for a long time to come!

Ir was good not great but good.  I did have to keep adding water so the sauce wouldn't thicken.  But other than that it was tasty.  Tossed it over some thin noodles and voila (pronounced wah-lah, lol)!

Unbelievably good for such a simple recipe!  Made it exactly as he shows in the video, including the caper brine.  Served over a thick piece of sourdough toast.  Delish and something I would proudly serve to any guest.

I tried this recipe for the first time last week and we fell in love! So much FLAVOR. The caper brine gave it that little something extra and brought the flavors out immensely.  Thank you for sharing this recipe. I will be making it tomorrow night since all I get asked is, "when will you be making the garlic shrimp again?". :)

pretty good, but I thought it was a touch too lemony/briney.  I would make it again with a bit less caper juice.  Personal preference.

Delicious!  I used frozen shrimp and didn't put them in first but I did thaw them.  I did the garlic and pepper (whatever else went in 1st) and then put the shrimp in on low heat until they got warm.  Then I did a bag of Asian veggies and warmed all completely.  Used with a package of heat and serve "butter and garlic" rice. We LOVED it.  Very easy, quick and was not as much work as it looks.  I loved COOKING it.

My husband loved this so much that he suggested I make it the following weekend for company.   They loved it too!  Didn't have caper brine so I followed another reviewers suggestion and used olive brine. Thanks for another excellent and very easy recipe Chef John!

Garlic+Shrimp=Deliciousness.  This recipe is great.  I didn't have fresh parsley so I dried parsley instead, just a couple tablespoons and it turned out great.  I made it for company and one of my guests said that he had never eaten shrimp that he actually liked before, he said that he loved it.  Definitely use the red pepper flakes they add great flavor and some spice.  Also, I didn't have caper brine, so I used jalapeno brine instead.  Will make this one again!

We love shrimp and we love this recipe.  For the caper brine we merely crushed, with a spoon, capers + caper juice.  Served over rice, tasted wonderful!

This was okay, but I was expecting it to be great based on all the 5 star reviews. Not sure what, but it was lacking something for me.

Great recipe!! As a twist, I served this with alfredo. I followed the posted recipe, but omitted the caper brine, as I didn't have any, and reduced the amount of butter.  This comes out with a kick, but tastes great.

With high heat, the shrimp overcooks, as mine did. Should've  cooked over medium heat. The overcooked shrimp is the only reason I couldn't give 5 stars. Other than that, this recipe is absolutely fantastic and delicious. I used only 2 tbl lemon juice and substituted 1/4 cup diced roasted red peppers (from jar) for the red pepper flakes (personal preference). Those were my only changes. Do NOT skip the brine. It's a vital part of the overall flavor. Next time, I would skip directions #1 and 2, beginning with #3, adding the butter and shrimp to that line. I would also cook no higher than medium heat for the entire recipe. Served this over linguine. I only wish there were leftovers for today, but sadly we ate every last morsel. Thanks for posting the recipe! It's a keeper!

I would give this 10 stars if I could!  The simplicity of this recipe is one of the best parts .  I did not have any lemons so I substituted  Lemon Balsamic vinegar instead.  WOW!  It was incredible.  I now make it this way every time.
I serve over Pappardelle noodles.

This was my first time to cook raw shrimp.  I just bought it at the grocery store.  I followed this recipe. Instructions and video were easy to follow, and turned out delicious.  My husband loved it, and he never likes anything new I make.  It was so good, I made it again a few days later.

Very good!  Since I didn't have any capers I used a little juice from a jar of green olives.  I used dried parsley as I didn't have fresh.  Delicious but I would have like more sauce - so next time I think I will double the butter and lemon juice and (caper) juice.  May add a little white wine as well.  Make sure all of your ingredients are measured out and ready to go - no time for measuring once you start!  Very nice video too!  Thanks!

Awesome and the best garlic shrimp I've had!  Served over a bed of slightly wilted spinach rather than bread.  Made a little extra sauce otherwise followed the recipe.  Will try serving it over fresh spinach fettuccini  or artichoke pasta.  It is critical to have everything prepped and I would combine what you can to avoid over cooking the shrimp.  I used jumbo (13-15/lb) shrimp so they were not over cooked.  I can see if smaller than extra large (16-20) are used times may need to be adjusted downward.  Also want to try using a little white wine next time.  A definite keeper especially since it is quick and  ingredients I always have on hand.

Just awesome over linguini.  The capers with juice and red pepper flakes make it. I added a 1/4 c white wine, lots of lemon.  Mmmmm good.

Love this recipe!  My absolute favorite for garlic shrimp.  I don't keep capers on hand, so I used green olive brine. Fabulous! I also added more butter because I like a thicker sauce. I am sure this is just as wonderful without my changes.

4 stars, it could have used a bit more punch, I added more red pepper flakes for mine. I served over jasmine rice, it might have been better over pata.

Well I DID have caper brine, so I followed the recipe to the tee. I made sure the olive oil smoked but not the butter. The garlic remained light as did the whole sauce. The green parsley and red shrimp tails presented beautifully over the linguini. I may not have added all the parsley as directed by the end of cooking--but it didn't not really matter. Nice recipe--gonna try it over rustic italian bread next time!

This was delicious. I cooked the shrimp in the olive oil but removed it after it was cooked, as I didn't want to over-cook it and eat tough shrimp. Since my family loves garlic, I used 8 cloves of garlic. I didn't have capers so I used green olive brine, which was still OK in the recipe. I mixed some white wine, a bit of sour cream, and Parmesan cheese into the butter sauce. I mixed the shrimp and al dente bow tie pasta into the sauce. Yummy!

We loved this easy recipe & plan to make it again & again. Added extra butter to thicken the sauce & poured over rice. Pasta would be good too. I used the caper brine, which was an excellent use for a bottle of capers that usually does not get used up. Will make it for company with a salad and rustic bread.

Really the best tasting scampi I ever made.  The brine makes a BIG difference. Do not skip on the secret ingredient. I did add a little bit of white wine at the end as I like more sauce for my rice.  Excellent!!

I made this recipe with shrimp and scallops in same pan.  I also used dried parsley and, in addition to the caper brine, 1 TBS of capers.  Served this over rice pilaf and had rave reviews from guests.  Quick and easy recipe that is just unbelievably delicious.  No leftovers.

Love this recipe! Super easy, yet, better, tastier than the standard 'Garlic Shrimp'.  This recipe takes it to the next level.  I made it as written - fabulous.  If you omit the Caper Brine you're missing out.  Spectacular!  A new family favourite - thanks for posting!

I have to say this was a pretty good recipe. I did not have all the ingredients ie red pepper and caper brine and subbed cilantro for parsley. Had to add 1 tsp sugar to counter-act the tartness of the lemon juice. I don't know if the brine would have helped this out but this addition of sugar was just right. Served over egg noodles. Could be adapted many different ways.. Thank you for the recipe

So simple.  Don't usually watch the videos, but am glad I watched this one. The only change I made was to use cilantro instead of parsley 1) it's what I had in the fridge, and 2) my tummy gets happy when I smell cilantro:  I know something good should follow.  This did not disappoint.

This recipe was phenomenal.  We had it over thick pieces of homemade bread that we toasted on the grill with a little olive oil.  I don't usually write reviews but I had to write one for this - my husband was making little appreciative "mmm" noises when he was eating it!

AMAZING! This was the do or die attempt at shrimp for me.  The video was a great help since I could see what the shrimp should look like.  I did everything as the recipe asked since it was the first time making it and it doesn't need any changes!  Of course there are already several ideas I'd like to try now just because it is such a great base as well.  The husband has already stated he'd like it frequently and has even suggested trying it with chicken.  Will be making this again and again!

Absolutely amazing!  I followed the recipe and video and it was perfect.  Just wondering if you have the recipe for the Meyer lemon bread used in the video?

Used 1.5lb of shrimp because my husband has a big appetite however I didn't increase any other ingredients. I didn't have any capers (juice) on hand so I omitted and it still tasted wonderful. I served it with rice and broccoli. Next time i think it would taste great with some angel hair pasta. Husband said I should put it in my rotation.

Prepare every thing ahead of time so it's fast, easy and totally delicious. Mince extra garlic for the Galrice Bread!  I poured it over Linguine and it was unbelievably good!

I love shrimp, but have generally shied away from cooking them myself, fearing that I'd spend a lot of money on ingredients but not be able to cook them the way they should be prepared.  I made this recipe exactly as published- no omissions or substitutions.  Having the video as a resource really helped my confidence!  I made this meal for my boyfriend and best friend last night and it was excellent.  I served the shrimp with spaghetti noodles and toasted garlic bread.  The only issues I had with the recipe were, first, that I felt the oil was a bit too hot for the garlic (I had to turn my heat down before the recipe says to do so to prevent burning), and that I think it calls for a smidge too much butter- I'll probably reduce it by 25% or so next time I make this dish.  Other than that, the recipe was easy to follow and it produced a delicious and GORGEOUS meal.  Although it is incredibly rich and therefore a "special occasions" recipe, I will definitely be making this again, especially when looking for a meal that impresses.

Just FYI for other beginner/infrequent chefs out there- this dish really does require you to get all your ingredients together and pre-measured before beginning to cook.

My family absolutely loved this recipe.  I had to do a number of substitutions due to the last minute decision to try this recipe (frozen cooked shrimp instead of fresh shrimp, no caper brine, chili flakes instead of red pepper flakes).  Next time I'll try to follow the recipe exactly.

Absolutely delicious! The caper brine is definitely the secret ingredient. A wonderful way to serve shrimp, the garlic aroma is heavenly!

Didn't use the brine, I'm not a fan. Easy on the red pepper flake, the garlic is spicy.
At the end I add: cooked long grain rice & chopped broccoli to make a one dish meal

Excellent. I've been following Chef John for awhile now. You can trust his recipes. This one is no different, perfect blend of garlic and red pepper. I made it with jasmine rice. I could eat it every night!
