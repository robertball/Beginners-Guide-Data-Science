My husband loved this recipe.  I however did not use the dressing called for because the reviews were so mixed.  I instead used another honey mustard dressing recipe from this site.  I would recommend you crush the chips very finely or they do not stick well.  I put mine in a plastic bag and ran over them with a rolling pin.  I also let them sit in the freezer for about an hour.  I have made with ruffles, pringles and bread crumbs.  Ruffles work the best.

This was really good.  I added more honey the second time I made it and a little less peanut butter, and the chicken came out a little better.  I also reccomend lining your baking pan with foil and spraying it good with Pam - these stick!  Yummy though!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  The honey mustard dipping sauce was creamy and rich.  My picky husband also enjoyed.  Thanks!

The sauce and chicken both had a nice flavor, but I had a hard time keeping the coating on the chicken.  More than half of it fell off.  Otherwise, the chicken was tasty and moist.  If I make it again, I will make sure that the chips are very finally crushed so they will stick better like flour.

The honey mustard touch was good, but my chicken came out a little uneven (some pieces were tough, some juicy).  Also, the potato chips didn't stay on at all.

It was very tasty, my husband loved it.  Its a great alternative to fried chicken fingers.  It tasted great with baked beans.

YUMMY!!  My husband made these for me for dinner and I loved them.  I'm not keen on mustard flavor so he increased the honey in the recipe and I couldn't get enough!  This recipe is so good I added it to my cookbook - in PEN!!!

This was deeelicious! And very easy to make. But you have to be expecting a tangy, different flavor. Not your mom's bland chicken. As with others the chips didn't stay on very well, but as I was not serving this formally, I didn't care much. It got eaten up all the same, and it was tasty! I will make this again many times.

I don't like peanut butter, and I did not realize how strong it would be.  I usually make honey mustard with just mayo, mustard, and honey so I will stick with that.  Otherwise very good.  Chips got very greasy when crushed and stuck together more than they did on the chicken.  Will try baked chips next time.

Both my husband & I loved this recipe. The chips do fall off easily. My suggestion: add the chips (as needed) to the chicken rather than putting the chicken into the chips because the chips don't stick to the chicken as well when they are wet. You will also lose some chips when turning the pieces over while baking so be careful here. Perhaps try making chicken nuggets instead as they are easier to turn than a chicken finger.

The potato chips stuck to the pan even though it was greased, and the sauce tasted like Thai food gone bad. A disaster.

I used crushed corn chips because I did not have potato chips on hand.  Great stuff.

We've made this recipe many times and absolutely love it.  We always mix the dipping sauce in one bowl, then sparingly transfer some of it to another bowl for coating the chicken so we are left with the majority of the sauce to dip.  Great recipe!

Good! -  but not great.  Worked better when I omitted the peanut butter and used bread crumbs instead of potato chips..but I guess that makes it a different recipe.
Would make again

This is one of my husband's all-time favorite dinners!  It's messy to make so I only make it occasionally, but he loves it.  I always use whole chicken breasts instead of cutting them in strips.
