These were a little too dry for my taste, but they did look pretty.

I'm trying to make these cookies right now and with the measurements listed I can't get the dough to be dough.  It's dry and crumbly.  I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.  I tried it twice and I have had to toss the cookie out.  If you have any suggestions please let me know.  This is the first year I'm trying to do Christmas baking and I can't afford to throw away ingredients.

WOW!! What a great cookie! My daughter loved it, my parents loved it and I ate way too many. On top of all that, it's elegant AND it's so easy to make.

These cookies are a family and friend favorite. Instead of shaping the dough like acorns I roll the dough slightly and then use an acorn shaped cutter. Also, I use an owl shaped cutter. It is very fall-ish. The flavor is wonderful and I make these every year at Halloween. People tell me it gives them a new respect for short bread type cookies.

This is a good recipe - I use it at holiday time.  I believe amount of ingredients has been edited because to another reviewers point - it was incredibly difficult to work with it was so dry in the past.  With current ingredients listed,   it is no longer the case.  I don't like my cookies that sweet, but I do think it needs more than 3/4 cups brown sugar.  I am going to increase that next time (by a bit).  I added a photo (I hope it posts) to show how I made them.  The balls are tricky and I like easy consistent timing when baking so I make  ball and then flatten them out - if you have a really good imagination they look like acorns.   On a final note - the dough is ready to be worked with in less than 10 minutes of melting the butter.  It mixes very easily.

Yes, the dough is crumbly; the way it should be for these cookies. The only thing I do different is shape them on a spoon as a mold and slide them off the end. I scoop the dough onto the spoon and cup it in my hand, pressing the spoon into my palm. I then lift up and get rid of the “trim” or excess dough, I then press down one last time to make it perfect. You can put them close on the baking sheet since they do not spread. My mom made these for over 40 years, and I have been making them for over 20, and my grandmother made them. They are my dad’s favorite. We dip in chocolate and then into more nuts.
