I made a low fat version of this by using fat free yoghurt and fat free sour cream instead of the mayo - it turned out great. Very creamy and rich without the guilt. The rest of the dressing ingredients in the recipe were already full of flavor so we didn't miss the mayo. I also removed all the chicken skin (I know all the fun bits!). I just eyeballed the whole recipe and it still turned out yummy! The creaminess of the dressing counters the relative dryness of the pita and chicken. I kept the veggies on the side (used leftover salad instead of shredded lettuce) until we were ready to eat. Hubby took the leftovers to work the next day (pita chicken with dressing and veggies all packed separately to prevent sogginess). So quick and easy I know this will be a regular at our table. Hubby already requested for this to be packed for his lunch regularly.:)

We really liked this. I did make just a few changes (mostly based on other reviews I read): I used less ketchup mayo and chili sauce than indicated. I didn't measure -- just poured in some ketchup a little more chili sauce and even a little more mayo until the mixture (onions chicken and cheese was already in there) was the consistency I'd want in a sandwich. Also I'm usually not a big fan of ketchup and mayo especially mixed together but I was pleasantly surprised by this. I did add a dash of nutmeg and maybe 1 tsp of dried parsley so that maybe also helped it not taste like ketchup&mayo. Oh and I added some chopped almonds for a little crunchy texture. Like someone else mentioned I didn't add the lettuce to the mixture but rather added it to the sandwiches as I was assembling them. And lastly I don't understand why the recipe only calls for ONE pita bread. Maybe others have huge pitas but I've only ever seen 7" ones - we needed way more than one! (I think we used 5 total.)

Very yummy! Next time I'll stuff the lettuce in at the end. Mixing it with the rest of the ingredients made for some soggy lettuce in the leftovers!

My husband really likes this one but suprisingly my kids did too! I recommend this for a hot day when there is not much time to dedicate to the kitchen.

I did not add the chili sauce as I didn't have any on hand and just sprinkled in some chili powder instead for spice and it turned out very good. For those who thought it tasted too much like sloppy joe making it this way makes the tomato taste less overwhelming.

I have to agree with the other veiwer that said it tasted like sloppy joe chicken. I didn't have roasted chicken so I used 3 boneless chicken breast(1#) and sliced them thin while still partially frozen. I made the sauce minus the onion and added 2 T honey to compensate for the flavor. I then cooked the chicken in a fry pan with about half of the sauce until done(had more sauce than I needed) Then I filled the pita with chicken/sauce mixture the cheese lettuce and some chopped tomatoes. I also used fresh lime juice instead of lemon. So I didn't change much except the way it was prepared. My son and I thought it to be kind of ketchupy flavored and agreed it had that sloppy joe taste. This was a different change from the usual pita fillings and if you like sloppy joes I think you will like this. Thanks Irene!

I was eager to try this recipe but only had a 10-ounce can of chicken in the house. Cut the ingredient portions in half and added to the chicken. Warmed two pitas lined them with lettuce and added the filling. They were delicious!

Tried this with variations: added fresh tomatoes and bell peppers used crushed pepper flakes instead of chili and reduced the ketchup and this still rocked!

We've done a similar sandwich for years using bottled ranch dressing. Cut a pita in half and open it up. Tear up a rotiss chicken and stuff the pita half with chicken lettuce tomato green onions and cheese. Add the ranch. I keep a rotiss bird in the freezer for this great "go-to" when time is short. I'll be sure to try the home made dressing for a change.
