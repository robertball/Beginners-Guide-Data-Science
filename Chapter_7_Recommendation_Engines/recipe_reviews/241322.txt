This is a very easy recipe to follow. There were a few things I wished I'd change after making it though. I wished I had the cheese in the middle to share the flavor with the meat. I didn't add peas for personal preference, but I did 2 green onions (minced) and a dash of seasoned salt to the meat. 
tastes good.

These are very good, but I would definitely add salt and pepper to the stuffing mixture, as it is very bland without the salt.
