Very rarely do I rate a recipe a 1-star but my roommate and I took two bites and decided to throw it out. I do not know why it tasted so bad. I believe may be far too much taragon in this dish. Based upon previous reviews the only change I made was to triple the sauce and mushrooms. A similar recipe that I've rated 5-stars is "Chicken Breasts with Balsamic Vinegar and Garlic". I highly recommend this recipe instead.

Add the port wine LAST, not along with the white wine, or you'll have trouble thickening the sauce.

Fantastic dish that was quick and easy to throw together. I pounded the chicken breasts thin as suggested by several reviewers, doubled the sauce using a medley of different type of mushrooms.  Added 1/2 cup of heavy cream to the sauce for a silker, richer sauce.  Served it all over linguini pasta.

This was scrumptious. The sauce was so good, i had trouble not picking up the plate and licking it like a little kid!I, like many others, doubled the sauce and am thinking of tripling it next time.I thickened it with cornstarch mixed with a tiny bit of water so it wouldnt clump. The chicken was nice and tender, and the mushrooms were great. I used more shallots, about 4 tbs. I didnt use tarragon, i used this herb mix my ma has, Herbs de Provence. DELICIOUS!!! Thank you so much for this delicious and easy meal. (served with mashed potatoes and broccoli)

THIS WAS A WONDERFUL RECIPE GOING TO BE MAKING IT AGAIN AND AGAIN ALTHOUGH I DID DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF SAUCE MIXTURE SO THAT I COULD TOP WHITE RICE WITH IT

Really good recipe.  I'll make this again.  I used several tips in the reviews.  I pounded out the chicken, TRIPLED the mushrooms and sauce instead of just doubling, and served it all over the chicken and a side of mashed potatoes.  You couldn't get better than this in a restaurant!  Thanks, folks!

I did like this recipe, but I did change it some to get the tastes that I preferred.  First of all, I think that there needed to be a little more shallots and muschrooms, but that is not a big deal and just a matter of preference.  I cut the chicken breasts into quarters before cooking to make the dish a little easier to handle for various appetites.  Additionally, I added a little more chicken stock, white wine, and port because I though the recipe did not call for enough of it for a good proportion.  The fresh tarragon is a judgement call.  I am not a huge tarragon fan, but tried it and of course I got what I expect... a nice tarragon aftertaste, but sometimes I think fresh tarragon takes away from the taste.  If other people are not big tarragon fans, i would suggested maybe using a bay leaf or two.  The last thing is that I added a little milk to a portion of the sauce to see who it changed my feeling and you can't go wrong with either one.  If you prefer creamier sauces, add some milk, otherwise the sauce itself it fine.  Thanks for the recipe Carol.  I will make it again sometime.

I made this for a business dinner. My guest gobbled it up!! I bought fresh breasts from the butcher (5) and used a whole can of chicken broth. I also used a whole container of sliced mushrooms. I didn't use the parsley.  I would use more shallots, maybe 4T instead. Very Good!!! I've made it twice and the wheat flour gives a great taste. I will use wheat for all browning to see what happens. Thanks for the recipe!

Fabulous meal. Used regular flour instead of whole wheat because I didn't have any. Also, added more chicken broth and port because it really didn't make enough sauce. Husband would have liked to have had more mushrooms so next time I will add more as well as more shallots. Used French bread to sop up the yummy sauce. Also, there was a reference to adding additional thyme but on my printout there was no previous reference to thyme. I added thyme and more tarragon to compensate. Chicken was extremely moist and that pleased my husband. He is not a chicken fan, especially not dry chicken but he went nuts over this dish.

I had two split chicken breasts on hand (for two), no shallots, used onions, no fresh mushrooms, used a 4-oz can, but kept all ingredients proportioned the same.  I had to come up with something quick.  This was so good with all the substitutions, I can only imagine how wonderful it will be when I make it again with the ingredients as written.  I added about 2 tablespoons of half and half mixed with a teaspoon of corn starch at the end.  Just a preference for a creamier gravy.  This was very good, easy and ready in 30 minutes.

Great recipe! I also doubled the sauce like most people & used Cream sherry instead of port. I bought the thin sliced fosters farm's breast's, they seem to cook a bit more evenly. Next time I cook this I think that I will melt a thin slice of mozzarella on each breast before pouring the mushroom sauce on top.

Really enjoyed this recipe. Perfect for a hot summer night when you don't want something heavy. The port sauce had just a hint of sweetness, which went well with the chicken. I only had dried tarragon on hand; next time I'll try fresh (although it's admittedly not my favorite spice). I also appreciated how quick this recipe was to throw together, especially when you're tired after work and the gym.

The chicken was juicy and the SAUCE - oh the sauce was fantastic! We doubled up on mushrooms to have plenty to drape over the chicken. And used dried tarragon which turned out just fine. It was so darn good and easy.

Do you use white port or red port? I happen to be in the unusual situation of having both at hand.

I LOVED this recipe!!  I made some modifications based on what I had lying around.  I only had white wine, so I nixed the port.  No shallots on hand, used onions instead.  Didn't use any tarragon or parsley.  I added some garlic (What are mushrooms without garlic??)  I also tripled the sauce.  Overall . . . fantastic!

This was a very good recipe. Will definitely make again and again. Only comment was that the "sauce" wasn't enough of a sauce but what it was...was good. : )

Not earth shattering, but something I will make again. The flavour was subtle. I used split breasts instead of boneless because I think having the bone & skin keeps the meat moist. I just picked the meat off while the sauce was boiling down. And I used a half pound container of pre-sliced mushrooms instead of just 8 of them. I also got lazy & threw the onions followed by the mushrooms shortly thereafter into the same pot with the chicken and then just let it simmer for about 20 minutes. I had to cook the chicken longer since it was bone-in. Oh! And I doubled the sauce as per others suggestions and added some salt.

Very tasty. I had to use dry sherry instead of the port wine because I picked up the wrong wine. I will definitly make this again. I too will double the sauce. I liked using whole wheat flour. It seemed to stick to the chicken better than white and browned nicely.

THis recipe is a huge hit w/ my family and friends! I use Rosemary b/c I don't like the taste of Taragon. It's hearty and filling especially w/ mashed potatos.

used courgettes as didn't have mushroom. used 3 dried bay leaves instead of tarragon. wasn't enough sauce, and even if there was a bigger quantity, the sauce isn't thick or creamy enough for my liking. not sure this recipe would taste much better had I stuck to the original. I think it's doing a bit too much work to have to heat up the chicken first, and then keep it warm, could just cook the chicken later on

Recipe says to cook chicken 10 minutes (or until cooked through). More like 30 minutes. Glad I used the suggestion to double mushrooms, wine & stock. Delicious flavor and will make again.

Absolutely wonderful!  I highly recommend at least doubling both the stock and wine, the mushrooms and the shallots.  Shallots are a definite Myst, adding that much needed garlicky flavour.  I did not have the white wine however was able to substitute wonderfully using one half cup water and a quarter cup vinegar and a tablespoon sugar combined.  I'll be definitely repeating this one!

I used oregano instead of tarragon and added garlic instead of shallots.   It was very tasty to me.  My BF says that he thought I should have added more port, but I personally think that would overpower the dish.

Well I probably reconfigured this whole recipe, but I used cabernet instead of red. I used blanched pearl onions instead of shallots. Doubled the onions, wine and stock. Nixed the tarragon, but added bay leaves, thyme, dried parsley, sea salt and cracked pepper. The whoe wheat flour is a must - adds a nice, nutty overtone. It became a week-night, quicky coq au vin of sorts. Served it over a bed of arugula with parmesan couscous on the side. brilliant!

Absolutely fantastic!  The sauce thickened up, courtesy of the mushrooms soaking up some of the liquid, and it became almost like a glaze.  Also, I was out of tarragon, so I used rosemary.  It was still delicious!

Fantastic recipe. Just the right amount of tarragon. Deaf Dog Lover dosen't know what she is talking about. This is also quick and easy to make.

This was good as is. I followed the recipe to a "T", except that I pounded out the breast halves, which reduced cooking time a tad. My parents loved it, my sister and I thought it was good but not amazing. This was very easy to make and tasted good so it will probably be made again in my house. I used about 10 oz of fresh mushrooms and that seemed to be a good amount. There was a little sauce/mushrooms leftover, and I know my dad already has his eye on them for later in the week!

I feel like this was just okay.  I added a little bit of sauce and included thyme instead of tarragon.  I really like the taste of the sauteed mushrooms - I think that was a good tip, but I was expecting a sauce with a bit more flavor.  The sauce just was not very flavorful but the chicken was quite tender.  So I don't think I'll make it again but it was okay.

It's hard to find a non dairy chicken dish that has a big flavor.  I used dried tarragon instead of fresh.  The only thing I would change is the amount of oil I used.  I strayed from the original 1 TBS and it separated the sauce....make sure to follow the instructions!  I also cooked everything together for about 15 minutes which made the chicken really tender.  I will make this over and over again in the future!

A very good recipe. I used dried tarragon and added a dash of heavy cream to the sauce. Forgot entirely about the parsley. I recommend this. Thanks, Carol.

Great flavor and easy to prepare.  I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce.  I also used dry tarragon.  Although it wasn't noted in the recipe, the one thing I always do with chicken breast is pound it flat.  It keeps it from being stringy, cooks more evenly and cooks quicker.

Amazing!!  I made several changes, I doubled the sauce, I added 1/2 cup fat free half and half to make it creamy at the end, thickened it with corn starch, added red wine rather than port, and added some chives, and used onion rather than shallots,  almost a new recipe, but still amazing!

Quite delicious and easy to make. The only thing I would add is that if you want the sauce to thicken up and become creamy, you need to add some flour to the sauce before you add the mushrooms. Also, I don't like the flavor of tarragon, so I substituted a sprig of thyme which turned out fine. Served this with balsamic roasted new potatos and brussel sprouts.

This was just ok for me. It wasn't bad, but probably not something I will make again. I did have to use cream sherry as another user had done, having no port on hand. If I do make it again it would be to try it as the recipe calls for. I think I was hoping for more of a marsala tasting recipe, so for what it was - it wasn't bad.

Yummo! The only changes that I made were the following:  Used fresh rosemary and thyme,veggie stock, 1lb of sliced baby bella mushrooms, and did thicken the sauce with corn starch. Evidently I did double the sauce. Loved the wheat flour to coat the chicken which I did slice in half instead of pounding. Don't overcook!

LOVED this!!!  Followed the suggestions of some others...Pounded my chix breasts to about 1/2 inch thick.  Probably tripled the mushrooms (Used a 1 pound pkg of fresh shrooms), doubled the sauce ingredients and added 1/2 cup of heavy cream to the sauce at the end.  I let that thicken up a bit and it still wasn't quite the consistency I wanted, so I used approx a tablespoon or 2 of cornstarch mixed with just enough water to make it not clump, and stirred that into the sauce til it reached the consistency that I wanted.  VERY tasty!  Will pass it on to friends and will DEFINITELY make it again!

This dish is great. Just watch the port.I put a less in than what is called for. Also I add cream of mushroom to the sauce.  The cream of mushroom with garlic is excellent, but just plain cream of mushroom works. I do a mixture of mushrooms also to add flavoring. I also add other spices to the flour that I coat the chicken in.

Really good recipe, not too complicated, but elegant enough for company.  I used three large chicken breasts, and it took a while for them to cook. Pounding them flat as another reviewer suggested might help. I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce. I also used a whole container of sliced mushrooms, not just eight.  It was delicious, and resulted in the perfect amount of sauce. The sauce had just enough port to make it tasty and interesting, but it did not overwhelm the other ingredients. I used dried tarragon. I also totally forgot about the parsley, but we didn't miss it. Served with oven roasted rosemary pototoes and fresh steamed green beans. Will make this again! Thank you!

I tried it twice, once as listed and once doubling sauce and using a bit more flour   to thicken it.  Great flavor, even for a guy that doesn't really like mushrooms ... I ate every one.

Good, but a little bland.  Next time I will try to avoid dealing with ringing telephones, barking dogs and kids' homework while fixing dinner - perhaps giving it a little more attention would be good.  I took advice from other reviewers and made double the sauce, which paid off.  I am not a mushroom lover, so omitted them and thought that was fine.  All in all, a fairly easy recipe and will probably make it again.

I love this dish. It's good to do something different with CHICKEN. I did double the mushrooms and sauce. We are saucey people! I used thicker chicken breasts, so it took probably 25 minutes to cook chicken on medium, not low.**Note to self, don't drink as  much wine while cooking!!
oh, never mind!! oh happy day :O)

I cooked the chicken Sous Vide style, then dredged it in flour. High heat sear and it was amazing. Definitely triple the sauce batch, and add the port last. When the sauce is done drop in a slice of butter and 1/2 lemon juice. Won’t disappoint!

I doubled the sauce, which was a good thing, doubled the mushrooms, XXXXXX onions (maybe 2/3's a cup, minced?), served over wild rice.   Not a huge fan of the tarragon, would have given it a 4 but made many changes.

This was awesome! I followed the suggestions of others & flattened the chix breasts, & doubled the sauce. I used a whole package of Baby bella mushrooms & thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch. For such an easy recipe, it really has a "gourmet" taste...like you spent alot of time on it! GREAT recipe!

I loved this combination of flavors --tarragon and mushroom, I guess. I added LOTS of tarragon, and used a variety of mushrooms. And I used more wine and broth than called for -- and added a bit of sherry instead of port. Buono!

I have 3 people in my family and they don't like everything - they don't think some things go together good - but they really liked this

Very good and yummy meal. Probably not one of the regular weekly dished you would prepare, good for company. This dish had such a wonderful rich flavor that was excellent with hot bread and veggies.
