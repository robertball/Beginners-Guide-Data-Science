I doubled this recipe. I used homemade bread crumbs (that I added italian seasoning to) and made the pizza sauce from scratch. I also added italian seasoning, garlic powder and onion powder to the flour. I served this with garlic-broccoli pasta. NO leftovers. The kids especially enjoyed this.

I was surprised at how good this tuned out.  I was looking for a different way to make chicken and am so glad I came across this recipe.  The chicken is so tender.  The breading adds a lot of flavor that reminded me of pizza crust and its texture has a little crunch to it.  Then with the sauce, pepperoni and cheese added on, it just got better with each layer. Next time I make it for dinner I plan on adding a few more of our favorite pizza toppings to our chicken.

adding other toppings, such as diced red peppers, mushrooms, onions, etc. was good as well.  Each person in the family could "design" their own meal.  I served it with parmesan risotto and asparagus to class it up!  :)

Pretty good; followed recipe exact.  The three separate bowls for breading  is kind of a pain, but other than that it is good and easy.  Used pepperoni on the kids' and Canadian bacon on the adults'.

I changed the pizza sauce to spaghetti sauce and it was really good with spaghetti as a side dish. And if you like spaghetti sauce it makes a good substitute for pizza sauce if you don't like pizza sauce.

This went over well with here, but I made some adjustments. To bring the salt content down, I used quick oats that I ground up in our little Cuisinart mixer so they had similar consistency to bread crumbs. Also, my son has started getting BBQ sauce on his pizzas, so I subbed chicken and rib BBQ sauce for the pizza sauce, and it worked out great.

Great recipe. I forgot to half the chicken so it took much longer to cook. Lesson learned for next time. I added onions, peppers, mushrooms and crumbled bacon also. It was awesome. Will be making it again.

Wow! This was delicious, and I made it as close to the original recipe as possible. Yum! To the sarcastic person who said it was just a chicken Parmesan knockoff and who needed a recipe: I’ve never made Chicken Parmesan and this was better than the few times I’ve had it out.

SO TASTY. I was kinda worried about these cause I wasn’t sure how well they would taste but wanted to try something new and WOW. SUPER tasty and turned out PERFECT. I did struggle deciding sides though so we used the left over sauce and served it other spaghetti lol

The only thing different is I didn't bread the chicken. Otherwise, I did it all the same as the recipe. It turned out great! Wonderfully tender with a great flavor. I will be doing this one again. I served it with penne noodles so we could have all that wonderful sauce.

Made pretty much as listed. Used 3 chicken breasts - each cut in half (about 2.2 lbs.). I needed more wash so doubling that would be good. Did not need 1/2 cup flour so less of that would be OK. Easy to add more if needed since not mixed with anything. Put a few spoonfuls of sauce on each chicken, 4 pepperoni slices and covered with cheese after 20 minutes and cooked another 15 minutes. YUMMY! I will make again. Maybe pound the chicken to get more surface area for sauce and all. Did not use salt but I hardly ever add salt as listed.

I was pleasantly surprised at have moist and delicious this recipe turned out to be. I will certainly be making this again. I served this with a simple baked potato but I think next time I am going to serve it with a fresh tossed garden salad.

The author should at least have had the breading procedure correct!  FIRST: dip in flour, SECOND: dip into egg, THIRD: roll in breading.  Otherwise, it's a nice recipe, since you can use your favorite pizza ingredients, and don't have to adhere to the specific ingredients which are listed in this recipe.

It was really good. How ever I used a red sun-dried tomato pesto sauce instead which I think really elevated the taste.

This was fantastic!  I doubled the recipe for a larger audience, but it was super good. I served it with some buttered pasta with a bit of grated Parmesan cheese and salt and pepper in them. Complimented each other well. This is what Chicken Parmesan should have always been. Forgot to take a picture and my minions devoured it before I remembered. I could send pics of empty plates...

How could you not love this??  I didn't use pepperoni but otherwise followed the recipe.  Timing was perfect.  The only thing is that I did have a little leftover breadcrumb mixture.  This is the perfect comfort food!  All you need is a green salad to accompany this.  Thanks!

Delicious, and definitely a keeper for my family! The only change I made was to add garlic powder to the breadcrumb mixture (because I add garlic powder to everything).

I made this according to the directions. Flavor is amazing but I used boneless skinless chicken breast from Costco, which are huge. It took over an hour to cook the chicken. Totally my bad. I will make this again but will cut the breasts in half, bread according to the directions and then bake. Others mentioned adding other toppings. I like the idea of using the cooked chicken as the pizza bottom (crust) and making the pizza as you like. Pesto, marinara, mushrooms. The possibilities are endless.

I  absolutely love this dish. It's like a  tender chicken parm minus the pasta. It was so fast and easy, pretty healthy, and very tasty. I just made it in my toaster oven. The only change I made was to add about 5 pieces of pepperoni to each piece, because I love pepperoni.

We substituted sliced turkey for the pepperoni and added fresh tomato and fresh sliced jalapeños on top of our freshly made roasted tomato sauce.  Other than perhaps overbaking it, we loved it.  We ended up using large chicken fingers rather than breasts, so adjust the recipe for the amount of chicken you start with.

Came across this trying to figure out what to make for Sunday dinner. I strayed from the recipe though. It would be good however it’s made. The only aspect of the actual meal cook process i did differently was sear the chicken after breading rather go directly into the baking dish. As far as ingredients I used a white pizza sauce rather than the traditional robust tomato, and 86’ed the pepperoni and used mushroom and feta cheese, as well as the mozzarella since it melts so well. Very tasty. One recipe that is easy to alter but without a doubt would be good however you decide to make it. Adding to my list of dishes to make more often.

Did not have pizza sauce, so I used marinara. Also did not have mozzarella, so I used slices of provolone.  My husband (who is not a chicken breast aficionado) loved it!

I marinaded the chicken first and then cooked it at 375 until it was done.  It was a bit salty, but will absolutely make this again!

Based on the fam's reaction, I'll be making this again. Sure, it's not super healthy, but it's a good goto when it's my night to cook and I don't want to eat clean. I complimented with a side of asparagus and sauteed onions & peppers. 

Couple of notes: 

1) Some of the pics show the pepperonis underneath the cheese (which is how the recipe told me to do it). We did them on top. They fell off easier that way, so maybe better to put them on and the cheese on top of them like the pictures. 

2) Try experimenting with cheese types for some variety. I got a hot habanero cheese that I want to try next time rather than the mozerella. 

3) The recipe says to use "breast halves." It was unclear if this meant to butterfly/slice the breast in half or not. I just went with a full ckn breast, not butterflied. It was a thick one, so I ran a few minutes longer than the recipe asked for.

This was the key to a quick and satisfying weeknight meal!  We did double up on the pepperoni, though.  :)  
Served with noodles with extra sauce and a kale salad.

This recipe was a big hit with my husband!  I prepared the recipe exactly as stated and it was perfectly moist and juicy.   The only problem I had was when I pulled the chicken out of the oven the pepperoni had slid right off the chicken.  I think if the chicken was pounded out to an even thickness or if you put the pepperoni under the cheese it would alleviate that issue.  I just picked the pepperoni off  the baking sheet and added back to the chicken.   This would be good topped with a few mushrooms and green peppers also.  Perfect with a simple green salad.

I have to say this turned out pretty yummy. I substituted regular flour for almond flour. I would like to figure out a substitute for the bread crumbs to make it that much more low carb but it definitely helped cure my pizza cravings!

Love this recipe! I also used homemade breadcrumbs. :-) I used gluten-free flour that I seasoned with garlic powder, parsley and Italian seasonings. I sautéed zucchini, onions, tomatoes and spinach and added the pizza sauce to that. I topped the chicken with the sauce and veggie mixture and then with the cheese and skipped the pepperoni. Yum!

We loved this!!!  My kids are very picky eaters and they scarfed this right up.  It is very easy, too--no need to really measure anything. I thought I would prefer it with just cheese, but in the end liked it with the pepperoni better.  Make this--its great!

I went the lazy way and bought my chicken frozen and pre-breaded... Then baked it according to package directions... Adding the sauce and pepperoni 10 minutes before the end of the baking time. It was yummy and SUPER easy! Perfect for a week night after work.

This recipe is a keeper! At first, I got worried because after 20 minutes the crumbs weren't golden yet. I decided to fry them quickly just to make it bit golden. But then, everything went perfect! It really tastes like pizza! My husband and my in-laws loved it!

Very good. The only thing I did differently was use strips of Salami instead of Pepperoni.  I don't normally have pizza sauce around so I may do something a bit different next time but it was great. I will be making this or some version again.

It's something new to do with chicken. Top tastes like pizza. Chicken on the bottom. Not too difficult to make. Just wish there was MORE of a pizza taste besides the top layer

Great recipe as is. I also made it using Italian flavored ground turkey & added fresh  spinach & sautéed mushrooms. Great BASE recipe & then you can change little things to your liking. We absolutely loved it.

I added sliced mushrooms. Cooked the chicken in an air fryer. After adding sauce, mushrooms and cheese, popped in oven til cheese melted. Chicken was juicy and tender, jummy.

This FINALLY presents Pizza Chicken in a good light. It was infamous in my family after my mother-in-law made it for us (years ago) using bone-in chicken with the skin on, AND cooked it using a microwave oven. 
It was wretched.

We loved it. I didn't have bread crumb so I took oysters crackers, crushed them and added about a tsp of Italian seasonings and a sprinkle of garlic powder, I just beat an egg as I didn't have any lemon juice, and used thighs instead of breasts. Cooked them a little longer then 20  mins, put the pizza sauce on top and cooked another 10 mins , then put the moz cheese on for 10 mins...excellent  meal and low carbs...this will be a keeper. Didn't use any Parmesan cheese...actually forgot about it is the only reason, still very good.

It was a good fix for not being able to make pizza dough. I ended up using crackers that I had on hand and it ended up being better then the bread crumbs due to the extra flavor the crackers gave. Over all it was easy, little messy but worth it.

I thought the idea of this meal was great.  However this will not be a family fav.  The prep and time it took to make this was also easy, we just didn't care for the pizza sauce on the chicken  guess.

Made this exactly as written, the chicken was bland. I had 4 family members over to try new recipe. Unfortunately we all felt the same way. All the flavor was in the breading and sauce on top. Love the idea but would need some flavor on the chicken itself to want to make again.

It was not necessary to use all the flour and breading allowed for in the ingredients list, so this cuts back on caloric count. The flavor and moistness were excellent.

It came out perfect. I had to double up on the eggs because I used three large chicken breasts. Other than that, I followed the recipe

Way easier than I had thought it would be. Everyone loved it including myself. Will be doing it again. The only thing I changed was using thin slices of chicken breast.

Mostly made as shown but since it was called pizza chicken I added some Colby Jack cheese with mozzarella. I pounded the chicken and marinated in italian dressing for an hour before baking. It was delicious!!

I love how many people are astounded that the basic recipe for a classic Italian dish otherwise known as Chicken Parmigiano is tasty.   
Pepperoni sounds like a bad mix w chicken however.

This was not what expected.  I would not add the pepperoni next time.  I would just make it as the chicken parmigiana as it starts out.  Neither my husband or I thought it was that good of a combination.

This was insanely good! Came together in a snap, perfect for a weeknight, and was so much better than expected. I will make this one again for sure, maybe changing up the "toppings" for different "pizzas".

Wanted a change from plain chicken. Very flavorful. Pepperoni didn't sound to good to me with chicken so I replaced it with mushrooms.

This was awesome!!!!!!!!!! I had my doubts but my teenager said to go for it and I'm glad I did. Only change I made is I used more pepperoni, mozzarella cheese and sauce-- Probably because my chicken breast was really large.

This was a huge hit at our house.  I did add some seasoning in with the bread crumb mixture.  I used Panko crumbs and left out the lemon in the egg mixture.  Super quick and easy dinner that was devoured by the little people.

Not bad. Make sure the breasts are thin, otherwise it overpowers the pizza taste.
