The beets and pink color conjured great interest during our lunch, but once everyone tried it, they loved it (even my 5 year-old)!  I used 2 pounds of potatoes, 3 beets, 4 eggs, safflower mayo, and a bit of chipotle seasoning. It made enough for about 8 people, and was very delicious.

I live in Central America and this is one of my favorite salads.  It's great as published but even better with a little fresh chopped cilantro added.  Please use fresh beets as called for in the recipe.  The taste and texture will suffer if you use canned, and don't even attempt it with pickled beets or sweetened (Harvard) beets. If you're looking for a variation on ordinary potato salad, give this a try.  You won't regret it.

A taste of home for my Colombian husband, whose country has a variation on this dish.

This is simply wonderful. The combination of four simple ingredients couldn't be better. The crunch of the beets, followed up with their earthy taste is the perfect complement to the potatoes and eggs. Once you stir in the mayonnaise, the pink hue makes it even more interesting. Season to your own taste. This recipe is great without any changes

I eliminated the potato to make a beet and egg salad and really loved it.  It's great when the beets take center-stage; they're so tasty!  Also, I used plain Greek yogurt in lieu of the mayo to add protein and make it healthier in general.  Pretty color, of course, too!  I used to eat this in Argentina all the time.  Thanks!

Yum, will make again.  I had some beets to use up.  I made with Vegennaise and it was quite tasty.

This comes out just as I remember my mom and grandmother making it. I add 1 lb frozen peas and vinegar to taste.

Loved it and so did my guests! I used a little less mayo and added some steamed, chopped carrots. Looking forward to making it again for the holidays.

I add 1 cup peas, 1 cup diced carrots, and 1 cup green beans to it. I have tried it a few times with sliced avocado.

Thank you... Thanks for the recipe.  I'm Nicaraguan and this is very close to what I remember...
I don't have fresh beets at the moment, so will try a can substitution.
