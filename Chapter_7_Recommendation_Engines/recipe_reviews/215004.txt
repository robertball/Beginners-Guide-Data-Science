Since I have discovered using Limeade for Margarita I love it.  But I do mine a little different and its Great!!  Sorry I don't not like beer - so with my changes I give it 5+ stars. -  I use the full can of limeade, then 1/2 can of water; 1/2 can of tequila; and 1/2 can of triple sec.  Mix well and pour over ice; serve with a lime on the side. - Then to make it extra special I add one shot of ameratto into each glass.  AWESOME!!! - of course you can use more or less tequila depending on individual taste. Also a good subsitute for triple is Grand Gala - its a notch up from tripe sec without being too expensive - ENJOY!!!

Use Bud Light Lime and add a can of Lemon/Lime soda. Makes a good recipe so much better.

My mom and I made these at a friend's birthday party. They are so easy to make, a drunk person could make them. The flavor is excellent, but I felt the amount of tequila was a little too much. Overall, I liked them, and would probably make again (with less tequila).

This was EXCELLENT!! I took all of the ingredients to a party and not only was it really easy to make, but it was a huge success with all the other partygoers. For the second batch, I left out the water and replaced with about 6 ounces of sparkling water. Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

This is truly the MOST delicious margarita I have ever made.  I have been making this for about 3 years and I do everything as is, except: I do not mix in the water and after I pour the mix over ice, I top each glas with a splash of club soda for some effervescence.  Delicious and refreshing.  You may want to add the water for a not as strong drink mix.  But, I love the tart lime and stronger drink!! YUM!

This makes a delicious margarita! I love margaritas and this one is really good! I used Jose Cuervo Clasico because I already had some.  I'm going to try it with some orange slices next time I make it.

Lemonade concentrate works quite well, also.  We have this at conventions all the time - made in HUGE batches in rubbermaid totes.  it goes over quite well with everyone who drinks it.  It sounds gross, but is actually good.

Really delish!  I used a  Labatt's light lime beer and it made these smooth and all too easy to drink, but not at all beery.  Blended in the ice to make them frozen and they were great!

I'm not a fan of white tequila in any drink.  It's too bitter.  Gold is definitely the way to go.  This rita is "ok" IMHO but I strive for the perfect marg.  If you really want to make it awesome and save cals?  Use a can of Fresca instead of the water.  It adds a great taste and no more calories.  If you want a To Die For Marg?  Add an oz of Grand Marnier.  Mmmmm

This was incredible!! I took it to a ladies-night-in hosted by a co-worker and it was THE hit of the party! I bought the cheapest tequila I could afford and substituted 7-up for the water. I used either Miller or Bud light with lime (don't remember). Wasn't sure what to expect with a combo like this but it was out of this world. everyone wanted the recipe. I can't wait to make it again!

Awesome recipe! I used Michelob Ultra cactus lime beer. Nobody believed me there was beer in them until they watched me make another batch! (I should've bought TWO fifths of Sauza that night...everyone wanted more Sauza-Ritas!

My hubby and I are BIG drinkers!  This made only 4 (normal) glasses for us.  They were AWESOME though.  Strong enough to taste the tequila, yet easy enough to go down smoothly.  I much rather make these then the blended type.  

I made some for my in-laws (they don't drink much) and I added only 9oz of Patron.  They loved them and couldn't taste a thing.

I agree with Maine Cook, in that this is by no means an invention of Sauza, but overall it is a great basic recipe.  I was surprised to see that the rating with the most 'thumbs up' didn't even use the beer.  That is the whole point of the recipe!  If you don't use a Corona or Tecate, you will miss out on the froth and carbonation that it brings.  Usually I opt to add a little more water and a little less tequila, as sometimes the limeade is a little bit too sweet.  The addition of Triple Sec and/or a little orange juice brings in a new twist as well!  Hope you enjoy it.

this recipe isn't a discovery it's really a do-over. Beer-garitas have been around a long time (ask any college student in the West) Best in a blender w/ a couple handful of ice...makes it nice and frothy. But any port in a storm and if you don't have a blender this is better than going w/out :)

WOW!! Great recipe.  I will say I have made this according to the posted recipe and we liked it.  It is deserving of 5 stars.  We loved it though when I replaced the water with g. ale.  (I would rate that 10 stars if I could).  I doubled the recipe (using g. ale) for our big Daytona 500 party and it was gone almost instantly.  I had to make more to get some for myself.  This is a wonderful recipe, can't wait to make it on a nice hot sunny day and drink while sitting at the pool.  Thank you for offering this recipe.

Great drink! I used a Corona for the beer. I usually hate it when people do this, but I made two simple changes: I used a gold tequila instead of the one in the recipe, and used lemonade concentrate instead of limeade. I only did this because it is what I had on hand. The drink is essentially the same, so I am giving the recipe five stars as is and for my changes both. It's so smooth, the intoxication kind of hits you out of no where.

These are my favorite way to make margaritas, with one minor tweak,  using lemon-lime soda instead of water. So easy to make and they go down really smooth! Be careful!

For a party we hosted I made this recipe as written, using Pacifico for the beer and Sauza Blue Agave for the tequila.  I was surprised at how many had not had a beer margarita before.  Everyone was totally impressed with the taste, and I think there will be many a Sauza-Rita after that party!  How could you resist? I'll be anxious to try some of the variations I've read about here!

I made these for a party this weekend, and everyone agreed they were very good.   Not the best ever, but better than anything I have ever made at home!

My recipe is very similar except instead of 12 oz. of tequila, it is split up into 6 oz. of tequila and 6 oz. of triple sec.  You really need that hit of citrus flavor.  Also, instead of the water, I use crushed ice.  The margarita is stronger--at least at first.  Everyone who has ever had this margarita asks for the recipe!  I've posted it on my blog.  http://www.fransfavs.com/2011/05/margarita/

My husband had a "beergarita" at a restaurant once so I knew the combo was a good one. This is a great one to serve at a summer BBQ.

This is SO much better than the pre-made margarita mix!  My friends who don't even like margaritas liked this drink.  I used a domestic beer (all I had on hand) but I'm sure it's great with others.  Easy to throw together and really refreshing.  Just sweet enough, without being overbearing.  The only thing I changed was I used lemon lime soda for part of the water to give it some fizz and extra flavor.  Yummy!

A very smooth margarita. I was pleasantly surprised about using beer; however, the margarita was quite delicious.

GREAT and EASY recipe!  I followed the recipe to a T except I used ginger ale instead of water.  Gave it a nice fuzzy kick and my guests loved it.

My daughter and husband are "famous" for this recipe.  Anyone who gets heartburn from Triple Sec will love this version.  Using 2 can fulls of water makes it less expensive and doesn't get people tipsy as quickly.  Still plenty tasty!

Great Margaritas!  Easy to make,  and very tasty!  The Sauza Blue Agave tequila is key, it is very smooth!  I mixed it with a Bud light Lime & it was perfect. We had some leftover, so I froze the rest in a plastic container. It was great the next day. Just scrape with a fork and add to a glass with flavored sparkling water (I used black cherry). It was so good!
