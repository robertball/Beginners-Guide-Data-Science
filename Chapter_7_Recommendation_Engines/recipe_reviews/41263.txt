I have lived in Texas all of my 44 years & don't know how you can make chili without real onions, garlic or without any kind of tomato base. We used tomato sauce in place of 1 can of beef broth. Chopped up a large onion & cooked with ground beef. Used only 1 can of jalapeno pintos & 1 can of regular. Cooked it way longer than the 30 minutes. End result was delish.

This chili was excellent. I made only a few minor modifications.  When cooking hamburger I added 1 large to medium white onion and 1 Jalapeno pepper. Then after it had been simmering for 30 min I added 1 6oz can of Tomato Paste, and simmered for another 30 min to thicken. The chili was a huge success, made it for a football party and it didn't even last until halftime. Bon Appetite

i took some of the advice in the other comments.  it was a huge hit.  i added not only sweet onion to the meat while browning it, i also added tomato paste then as well as green and red peppers (diced).  then once it had cooked for 30 minutes, i added 1/4 cup on japapeno juice and cooked for 20 more minutes.  topped with a jalepeno cheese blend and sour cream.  very easy recipe.

I've made many different types of chili before and this is the first one that I've been able to get my kids to eat.  However, I decreased the amount of chili powder in half.

This chili was GREAT!! I only used 1 lbs. of ground beef because i was making it for me my husband and my 2 yr. old so i didnt need alot i didnt have enough beef broth so i just added about 3/8 can of water (10.5 ounce can) We had some instant rice so we warmed that up and put it in the bottom of our bowl then put the chili over it. I will def. do this again no changes need to be made.

I made this recipe as directed.  I really liked the flavor of this chili and I will be using this chili recipe to put on top of my fry bread for Indian Tacos.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I initially made this exactly as per the recipe except that I drained the ground beef completely and added a small can of undrained green chiles along with the pinto beans.  This was a very tasty meal served over crushed tortilla chips and with a lettuce salad.  When I reheated the leftovers I added a small can of V8 juice (5.5 oz) along with more flour and chili powder and simmered until thick.  Served over Brazilian White Rice (recipe from this site) it was a second tasty meal with fried cinnamon apples.

YUM!  This was delicious - it was very thick though.  Next time I will use more broth or less beans so it is more soupy.  Also, I am going to put a few drops of hot sauce while it simmers to kick up the heat.  I like my chili to be spicy!  I served this with fritos, sour cream, and shredded sharp cheddar cheese.

This was okay for homemade chili especially if you need a recipe that is onion, pepper, and tomato free. Way too many beans though. I was really heavy handed in measuring my spices. This was a mild chili and we would eat it again, but it didn't make our favorites list. I didn't have pintos so I used dark kidney beans. For my personal tastes this could have used double the spices. Thanks Ken, your chili was good. We had no leftovers. The Hungry Teen had seconds.

AWESOME Chili. I changed it up for our tastes, by not adding beans, adding a can of Rotel original, sauteed onions and 1 can of broth. The spice combo is  the best I have used so far. Thanks for sharing...its a keeper for us.

Did not add the beans, and I used fresh garlic instead of the powder. Also used chicken stock instead of beef, since that's what I had lying around. Added 1 can of tomato sauce. FABOO! I loved it! We topped it with onions and shredded cheddar, and served it over spaghetti. YUM!

Really enjoyed this, I added some tomato paste but otherwise stuck to the recipe and it was good - maybe some more spices? Otherwise very good, simple and quick to throw together.

The recipie is good but like most reviews I added classical ingredients that were left out like the real chopped onions and minced garlic, as well as, diced tomatos in a can.  Tomato sauce is good too but I like it chunky.  Enjoy!

I loved this recipe. It's different than tomato based chili recipes, but that's exactly why I liked it. I added a diced green bell pepper and a diced onion to the ground beef. Next time, I will probably reduce the oregano by half. I'll definitely make this one again. Thanks for the great recipe!

This wasn't bad, but it was a little greasy and bland. Next time I'll probably add some jalapenos and drain more of the fat.

AWESOME! We used kidney beans, black-eyed peas, and navy beans. We also added tomato paste. We put Frito corn ships in bottom of bowls, then put chili and cheese on top for a Texas Frito pie! Loved the recipe and we used to live in Texas! We like it spicy but some may wish to tone it down a bit.

My family and I love this recipe.  I use the original, plus some of the suggestions in the reviews.  I also cook it in the crock pot instead of on the stove.  It is such a great cold weather food.

We loved it, what I changed or did differently?  I used 2lbs of venison chili meat and 1lb of beef chili meat. I also added one large chopped onion which was placed in the pan when the meat was browned. I added a half of clove which was chopped finely and one 4oz can of diced chili peppers.  Awesome....its a keeper!

Love this recipe! Have cooked it dozens of times for football season and camping. I like it flavorful so I double the spice recipe. I like it spicy so I add jarred jalapenos + juice, canned green chilis, black beans instead of pintos, and top with chopped red onion, fresh jalapeños, sour cream and fritos!

I followed everything except the broth and chili seasoning. I used dried Arbol (spicy and wholesome) and pulla (spicy and smoky) in a blended mix. I also used red green and yellow bell pepper for some added veggies.  I then doubled the cumin and garlic powder and added more salt and pepper directly on the beef and veggies since the packet seasoning was absent. Diced tomatoes were added with a swirl of Worcestershire sauce with the chile sauce before I covered the final mixture and slow cooked it for 4 hours. As it thickened I added a half and half of veggie broth and water mixture just to give it a little moisture( adding too early or too much prevents the infusing of everything that concentrates and makes good chile).It was the best chili ever.

It's a great base recipe. I've been making this chili a few years now and it's fantastic. I do add onions and a couple of cans of rotelle that add a nice kick. Make it your own.

I start with dry ingredients in pan then crumble ground beef over dry ingredients and mix very well. I then heat up the pan slowly while stirring and  breaking up the ground beef. By the time the pan and meat get to cooking temperature the meat is very fine and seasoning is mixed through the meat. Add small can of tomato paste and mix well with meat.  Add chili beans with own juice  instead of pinto beans plus one can of small kidney beans. Add 1 - 28oz crushed tomatoes. Increase salt to taste. Add beef broth only if to make chili more soupy

I needed a no tomato chili recipe for a party where people with tomato allergies would be. I was a sceptic but everyone loved this chili. They couldn't believe it tassted just like chili with no tomatoes

This chili is delicious!I make it using venison instead of beef. I did make a few changes. I only add one can of the beef broth, add one can of hunt's tomato sauce, and two cans of pinto beans with jalapenos. I also add a bit of crushed red pepper because we like our chili warm! Thanks for this recipe!
