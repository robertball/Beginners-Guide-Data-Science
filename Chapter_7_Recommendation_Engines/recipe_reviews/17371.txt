This is a great recipe. However, I did substitute Kraft shredded white cheddar cheese instead of the processed cheese. It worked out well.  Also, after baking, I broiled for a minute or two for extra crispness. Everyone loves this recipe!

This was heavenly!  I went to a party a few weeks ago, and the hostess told me she had gotten the recipe from Allrecipes.  So I found it here and made it myself.  My husband and mother-in-law couldn't get enough!  She copied the recipe from me.  It is truly a great appetizer - thank you for posting it!

I found these good but just a little too salty on my first batch; the next time I substituted garlic powder for the garlic salt and they were just right!  Really easy and convenient to freeze ahead for parties, too.  Everyone who has tried them loves them.

I make this with just 4 ingredients - old english cheese, 1 stick butter, 1 can lump crabmeat - and the english muffin.  
These are always a hit!!
I agree they are great to keep in the freezer and pop in the oven for unexpected guests!!

These tasty treats are simple to make. I toast the muffins before adding the topping and also broil for a few minutes after baking and they come out nice and crispy.

Awesome!  I made these with 5oz jar Old English, and 1 c. shredded sharp white cheddar.  No salt, used Lawry's and garlic powder, not garlic salt.  I put it on individual bread rounds and topped with fresh chives.  They were perfect.  My 3yo could not stop eating them!

My mother has made these since I was little.  She uses Old English Spread from kraft.... I use bacon instead of crabmeat sometimes and comes out just as good. These ALWAYS disappear!

Very good and easy to make.  They weren't a big hit at my party though but I have been to parties where they are gobbled up.  Must have been my guests!  Anyway, will make them again since they are delicious.

I was excited to make this for guests, but the processed cheese made the whole dish seem kind of tacky, as well as it being WAY too salty. I'm only giving it 2 stars because 1 person did enjoy them.

I followed the advice of the other reviewers and used garlic powder in place of garlic salt. I also lightly toasted the muffins first. I was unable to find Kraft Old English cheese so I used Wispride sharp cheddar in the dairy section of the grocery store.  These were very good. My kids loved them too, I called them "Krabby Patties"!

Great recipe, but as written it is way too salty. Suggest-as others have-using garlic powder instead of salt. I used 5 ounces of "Pub Cheese", a cheddar cheese (real cheese, not that icky Velveeta) spread available at Trader Joe's. I try to keep some of these in the freezer for last minutes appetizers, but they're hard to keep around!

I've made these for years -- I use the little glass container of Kraft old english cheese (I don't know if that's 'processed cheese sauce' or not).  Keep well in the freezer.  VERY popular with my family.

Good overall, but I would suggest toasting the muffins before piling on the mixture and baking them.  Mine got soggy. :(  They were still good!

These ARE wondeful!  I have made this recipe   many times...always a hit and people always ask for the recipe.  If you have fresh crabmeat available, it is definately worth using, as it makes these even better. So easy and they can be prepared well in advance.

I too cut back on the butter and these were very good.  I made them once with canned lump crab and they were very very fishy, the second time I bought rab legs and shelled, they were AWESOME

I served this for our Christmas brunch, & everyone loved it.  I followed others' tips, and toasted the English muffins first.  Also, I used shredded white cheddar- first made it into a sauce form by melting it in a double boiler with some half & half, then adding the other ingredients.  Thanks!

I made these for Superbowl Sunday and we loved them.  I didn't cut the muffins after splitting them.  My husband and I liked them so much, we ate the whole muffin halves!

My mother in law gave me this recipe years ago and it's been a staple on my holiday appetizer list.  I lightly toast them before spreading the mixture on then . I freeze them for 30 minutes before cutting them in quarters and then I bag them up and store them in the freezer until just before I need them. I broil them instead of bake them. I use garlic powder instead of salt and sometimes I use Old Bay instead of seasoning salt. They are always a hit!

I have made these for years.  I use a jar of  Kraft Old English spread and add a TBS of Mayo.. As a twist, use cajun seasoning instead of the garlic and salt!!  Much easier to  cut the muffins in quarters after they are cooked.
