When I made these the first batch was a little dried out because I made the patties too thick.  I did the second batch at about 1/4 inch thickness and they turned out better!

I made this exactly but used canned chicken.  We liked it, but didnt love it like I thought we would.  Next time I would use cooked chicked breast and a little less Blue cheese as it was a little strong.
