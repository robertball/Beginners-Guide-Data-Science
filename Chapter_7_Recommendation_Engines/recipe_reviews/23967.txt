Because of a special diet I can't use canned tomatoes or paste so I just subbed the same amount of fresh diced tomatoes. There was enough juice from the tomatoes to make it just right. Also, I used 4 cloves of garlic because of personal taste. The addition of fresh basil and oregeno made this dish exceptional.

There may be better recipes out there for marinara sauce, but I gave this 5 stars just because I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it was tasty--plus it was super easy and quick and the ingredients are all things you tend to have on hand.

Husband says not to bother buying sauce any more after eating this.  Changes:  added some black pepper, Italian seasonings, parsley, & basil.  Used a (drained) can of diced tomatoes w/ garlic & mushrooms.  Could use diced tomatoes w/ jalapeno for more of a kick.

This was delicious. My changes: 2 tsp sugar, 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp basil, 1 tsp salt, then I pureed the sauce (my kids like it better that way). I doubt I will buy marinara at the store anymore.

This is a really good basic recipe. Personally, I use canned whole tomatoes (the closest thing you can get to fresh tom's, imo) that I split with my fingers, remove the seeds (which only make the sauce bitter), then roughly chop. Depending on what I'm using it for, I use a hand blender to puree the sauce until it is as smooth/chunky as required (smooth for marinara dipping sauce, chunky for pizza sauce, chunkier for pasta sauce etc). Something else I do (I saw this on tv) is to save the dry rinds from Parmesan, and add those to the sauce. Remove them when you're done, and you've got a lovely subtle flavor. Anyway, I'm looking forward to having this later for dinner with 'Sicilian Meat Roll.' Thanks, Betsy!

I have been making this sauce for years, except we prefer basil instead of oregano.  In a pinch or for a quick sauce, use dried minced onion and garlic salt.  And for a more elaborate sauce, add this recipe to any jar of spagetti sauce.  Don't be afraid to experiment with different ingredients to find what tastes best to you.

Great basic sauce.  I didn't have an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, so I used a 6 oz. can of tomato paste and added 4 ounces of water.  Let it simmer, covered, for quite a while, until dinner was ready.  Added a little fresh basil and no salt.  Had this with Fast and Friendly Meatballs, from this site, whole wheat angel hair, and steamed broccoli.

This was great!  Simple and tasty.  I prefer a smoother sauce so I blended the onion, garlic and diced tomatos in the food processor then added that to the rest of the ingredients.  Wonderful!

This recipe is delicious! I added some sauteed mushrooms and green peppers to the sauce to add something a little extra. I love this sauce. It's so easy to make and change to your liking.

There wasn't much sauce - it was mainly chunks of tomato and onion.  It tasted fine - it just needed to be saucier.

Good and basic recipe. The addition of basil is a must. I also like to simmer a bit longer but depending on the dish there are times that this short cooking time is perfect.

This is such a great base recipe to have in your recipe box.  Why buy jarred sauce ever again?  I loved it the first time I tried it, as is, but I've tweaked it to my taste the last couple of times I've made this delicious sauce.  I tripled the amount of sugar, as I like my sauce a little sweeter.  I also added 1/2 tsp of basil.  Then, I let the sauce simmer away for about an hour on low temp.  Wonderful, mouth-watering stuff to pour over pasta.

This recipe was so easy and delicious!!! I only used half of a sweet onion and that was perfect for my taste. I made this sauce to go with another recipe from this site, which called jarred sauce. It is called 'Sausage and Peppers for a Dozen'. You would have to double this sauce recipe to go along with it. I halved the sausage recipe and it worked great. Thank you so much for this simple and yummy recipe!!!

I loved the taste with the Meatball Nirvana recipe! My boyfriend and I had meatball marinara subs for dinner and he went crazy for them :) I think next time I will blend it though for the subs and use the sauce for dipping breadsticks. Thank you for the recipe!

I made a double batch of this to freeze for future use - use about 2/3 cup chopped Vidalia onion, 3 cloves garlic, subbed tomato puree for the sauce.  I still only used a scant tsp sugar, but used 2 tsp oregano and added 1 tsp dried basil.  I simmered everything for closer to 45 minutes.  Came out really good - I'm rating it 4 stars only because we like more garlic and herbs, and I think it would be a little too plain for us without those adjustments, but even as is it's a nice basic marinara.

Nice flavour -  I added fresh basil and oregano to the sauce.  I used 6 roma tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes and added 1- 14 oz can of tomato sauce to the pot.  Followed all other directions to a "t" and let simmer away on low all afternoon.  Does not make a lot of sauce in one batch, so if looking to feed more than 4 people, you will want to increase ingredients accordingly.

I love this recipe.  I've fixed it twice now and I love it.  Instead of adding the sugar, I add a couple of carrots and stalks of celery, cut into large chunks so I can remove them after the sauce has finished cooking. Also, if I have it, instead of adding the salt, I add the rind from a wedge of good parmesan and it gives SOOO much great flavor.  I like that it's chunky, but you could also take a hand blender to it to smooth it out.  Also, just for my personal taste, I grate three cloves of fresh garlic in and use a mix of basil and oregano.  You should try this and hopefully you'll love it as much as I do.

So easy to make and tastes great.  My husband doesn't love chunks of tomatoes, so I usually put the diced tomatoes and blend very lightly to smooth them out a bit (or I just tomato puree).  We like to add meatballs too!

Wow - everyone, unfortunately, did not care for this.  Only used a small yellow onion and all you could taste was onion.   Haven't ever rated a recipe

This was excellent! I doubled the recipe and upped the garlic cloves to 4! Also used crushed tomatoes because that is what I had on hand. I sort of screwed up on the seasoning because I used 1 tsp. of each: basil and oregano (should have been 1/2 tsp.) but, everyone said that it was delicious so will probably do it the same way next time. I served this over fresh cheese tortellini. It was delicious!

With some tweaks this is awesome sauce.  I used 1/2 an onion; crushed rather than diced tomatoes; added fresh chopped basil to taste (for me I like a lot); 1 red bell pepper finely chopped and sauteed with garlic and onion.

Just finished making the sauce for dinner. It smelled terrific ( fresh oregano and basil from my garden). Can't stop dipping into it. Excellent and easy recipe. A definite keeper.

Hey CALEIGHSMOM, just wanted to let you know, you made my New Year's Eve! My friend and I who dont have a clue about cooking wanted to challenge ourselves by making marinara sauce from scratch for a change. Thanks to your recipe, the end result was delicious! We did make a few changes according to our tastes by doubling the salt and oregano as well as adding some tomato paste and black pepper, which made the flavours really intense! This was the best marinara sauce ive ever had...im never gonna be able to eat the stuff from the jar again!

This is good gravy! I have made it twice now. I recommend using 1/2 as much onion as called for, and adding fresh "sweet basil".

I am giving this 5 stars becuase it was so easy and so tasty.  I pretty much followed the recipe except I added some fresh basil and pepper.  Good flavors.  I will make again.

Very nice, simple recipe. It's a great base that allows for additions to accommodate your tastes. I added a few more spices (parsley, crushed red pepper, bay leaf), omitted the onion, and sauteed some fresh mushrooms with the garlic at the beginning. I did let it simmer for over an hour because I had the time to do so and I think the longer sauces simmer, the better they taste. This was really great served over penne pasta. Thank you :)

This is a great base recipe for a marinara sauce. You can easily add to it peppers, carrots, etc. by lightly suateeing them first. Sweet onions are the best, if available. My one onion was way too huge I realized once I added the tomatoes, so I simply added another can of diced tomatoes and another can of sauce. I used about 6 cloves of garlic, chopped, added crushed red pepper and Italion seasoning, more sugar, and Tony Cachere's, and my dad was literally wiping his plate clean! I did let it simmer for about an hour, too. Served it with angel hair, parmesan breaded chicken breasts and garlic bread...delicious! And easy!

I was skeptical at first that a recipe so simple could taste so yummy, but this was great!  I added a little bit of crushed red pepper and about a teaspoon of dried basil to the sauce and I served it over broiled polenta slices--I took it to a dinner party and they were all asking for seconds!  I plan on making this again!

I really liked this recipe as I was in a hurry and found no canned spaghetti sauce in the cupboard.  I followed the recipe except for using 1 teaspoon italian seasoning in place of oregano.  Now that I've tried this I prefer it to any canned sauce.  It's so simple and you can make it all in one pan.

This is a great recipe!!  My son kept asking for pasta so I thought I would give this a try.  I added canned mushrooms and bell pepper, I had some on hand that I wanted to use before it went bad.  It was so delicious.  It didn't take long to make and my toddlers ate it up.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Good recipe using items I always have in.
I used this sauce to go with meatballs. I added some dried basil and italian seasoning. My daughters and myself loved it, my husband thought it tasted a little sour. So if I make it again I thnk I'll add a bit more sugar. Many Thanks

When it had been cooking for 15 minutes and didn't have much flavor, I sauteed two more cloves of garlic, plus added a 3/4 tsp of Italian seasoning.  Even after the addition, we had to put on a ton of Parmesan cheese to make it taste good.  We're vegetarian so didn't have meatballs--perhaps that was the problem.  It may taste good with meat, but didn't care for it as written.

Good basic recipe for marinara sauce. I forgot to add the sugar but it tasted just fine without. I used Italian style diced tomatoes so I didn't need the oregano, plus I don't really like it. I did add some dry parsley instead. Also, I added some cruched red peppers to the oil while it was heating up for some spice and used about 5 cloves of garlic. Thanks for the recipe!

Great Marinara Sauce, easy to make and tastes delicious.  I added some portabella mushrooms and some parsley.  This really made my whole wheat pasta taste that much better! 

Can't wait to make it again!

I increased the garlic to an insane amount. We really like garlic. I used organic peeled tomatoes and tomato sauce. I also increased the oregano to a teaspoon and a half, abouts. I didn't really measure. This is good, but not our most favorite.

Can't beat this for fast and easy.  I added some basil and a bay leaf and simmered for an hour or so because I was making it for the next day and was in no rush.  I used about half the olive oil.  Finally, I diced up and added a small quantify of smoked ham I had in the freezer for a little extra flavor.  Served over some whole wheat penne pasta this is is a pretty healthy and very tasty dish.

What a great simple recipe to doctor up to your taste preferences.  I just used this to make a delicious spaghetti sauce.  I added some chopped up Italian breakfast sausage and let it simmer for about 45 minutes before pouring it over some cooked spaghetti.  I really can't think of a dish that's this good and cheap to make at the same time.  This is a keeper!

I have not purchased jarred sauce since I tried this recipe 4-months ago.  I don't enjoy cooking, but this recipe is so quick and easy that anyone can do it.  Best of all, it tastes like you actually know how to cook!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is so easy!  I just went to the pantry and whipped it up.  I did use italian seasoning instead of just the oregano. Turned out great:)

I love this marinara!  It's so easy!  I double the garlic and the sugar.  This is a snap to make. I like to serve this as an accompaniment for the Zucchini Patties from this site.

We love it.  I've used it for everything from lasanga to stuffed zucchini.  I like to put in diffrent herbs depending on my mood.  I've also added 1/4lb ground beef and 1/2 lb hot italian turkey sausage to make a fabulous meat sauce for spagetti.  It also freezes wonderfully if you want to double your batch and throw it in the freezer for another night.

This is a great recipe if you need something quick. My brother was making calamari and forgot to buy some dipping sauce so I whipped up this recipe. I only simmered it for 5 minutes and it still turned out yummy.

Yum!  Made this sauce to use for eggplant parmesan and it was really awesome!  I had to double it for the dish and used every bit of it for one medium sized eggplant.  I used 6 garlic cloves, but that's because we are garlic lovers :)  I'll be making this sauce from now on instead of buying the canned & jarred stuff since I always have the ingredients on hand.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Tasty. Nothing amazing, but a good basic recipe. I added a lot of Itallian seasoning and about a teaspoon more salt. I also pured about 3/4 of the sauce in my Cuisinart. I think this gave it a better texture.

I will definitely use this recipe again with my minor tweaks. It was very good.  I prefer a more savoury than sweet sauce so I did not use the sugar and instead I added basil to give just a little more flavor.

Yummy and really versatile. It's a basic little sauce that would have been delicious and satisfying without my changes. To use up a yellow bell pepper,  I chopped and sauteed a handful along with the onions and garlic. In addition to the canned tomatoes, in went a 15-oz. can of tomato sauce, since that's the size I had on hand. (I upped the sugar and seasonings just a bit to compensate.) Like many other reviewers, I'm more about basil than oregano, so I tossed in 1 tsp. dried basil and 1/4 tsp. oregano, along with a few healthy grinds of black pepper and a shake of red pepper flakes. Meat lovers could add browned sausage or beef. A splash of red wine would deepen the flavor as well. So many possibilities for this easy, quick marinara!

Really good for something so simple. I added in a tablespoon of tomato paste to deepen the flavor, about a teaspoon of red chili flakes, two more cloves of garlic, and I substituted the oregano with Italian seasoning. If you're worried that your sauce has reduced down too much just add some pasta water and it'll even out nicely.

Loved it.  So easy to make.  Hubby said its a keeper.   Only thing I did different was add a little fresh basil to it.   Today I am canning a bunch of it in a hot water canner.

This was great in a pinch because I was out of my jarred sauce. I added some Italian seasoning and some Worcestershire sauce for some depth of flavor. I would make this again, if I was out of jarred sauce.

Great recipe for me! I’m trying to reduce carbs, salt and sugar in my diet so this was great over TJ cauliflower gnocchi or spiralized zoodles. Changes made were using no salt added tomato products, eliminating salt, adding fresh basil, one packet stevia, dashes of Texas Pete and 1/4 cup red wine. Next time I might added a few diced peppers.

I seriously love this recipe.  Always have everything on hand and it can be made in under 30 minutes? Bonus! Way better than jarred sauces and the best part is that you know what's in it.  Being able to control the sugar in your sauce is great.  Take the time to make this.  It's sooo good!

this is a really nice, simple sauce that i've made several times, i've used it in lasagna, eggplant parm, and as a dipping sauce and was complimented every time. my only complaint is that it is very, very chunky, so next time i'm going to add another can of  tomato sauce and see if its a little thinner. other than that though very tasty! i like to let it simmer for 45 mins or longer to really meld the flavors.

I doubled the recipe to use with stuffed shells. I used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of the diced tomatoes. At the end I did end up adding more oregano, basil, pepper and cayenne pepper. This is a good recipe for a basic sauce that you can add spices to your liking. Thanks for the recipe:)

Great sauce, easy to make. I added ground beef to make a meat sauce. Next time I will make without the ground beef and serve it with meatballs.  I did add a couple of teaspoons of tomato paste because I like my sauce a bit thick.

Great Healthy Sauce!  I substituted organic petite diced tomatoes, no salt added organic tomato sauce, sea salt instead of table salt and balsamic vinegar instead of white sugar.  I added 1/4 cup water and allowed the sauce to simmer for about an hour.

I had garden tomatoes to use up, so peeled them and used them instead of the can of chopped tomatoes.  I eyeballed it too - I didn't measure my tomatoes.  I used fresh basil also and didn't have any tomato sauce, so I used tomato paste instead.  It was FANTASTIC!!  My husband said it probably was the best marinara he has ever had.  Super easy!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was great.  It went over great with my kids who are all different in their tastes.  I will continue to make this any time I need a sauce.  I did add more pepper, Italian seasoning, basil, and parsley because of other suggestions.

This just replaced my Mom's spaghetti sauce recipe as the family favorite - sorry Mom.  Served with meatballs for dinner tonight - it was awesome.  My hunt for the perfect marinara sauce is over...and it's easy.

This is a winner!  My husband told me that I outdid myself.  I made one change, I used Penzey's Italian seasoning, other than that, I stuck to the recipe. Have made it 2 weeks in a row now.  Thanks so much!

Used only half the onion and added basil.  I liked it well enough for a quick tomato sauce in a pinch.  My 10 yr old son loves spaghetti sauce, but says he didn't like this as much as Ragu.  =(

Hi made just a few tweaks and everyone loved it.  Added 1/2 lb Italian sausage and 1/2 lb gr beef to onion.  Then drained and added 14.5 oz can stewed tomatoes and 8 oz tomato paste and parsley and Italian seasoning instead of oregano with rest of ingredients.  Doubled the sugar.  Even with this doubled version not much leftover:)

All in all this was really good. Just a couple of things: It was too chunky for my liking, so I ran it through the blender, which made it fairly smooth, but it was a bit watery. The other thing is that it needs some more salt and pepper or some other seasoning. It was a tad bland. But like I said, all in all we liked it, and I will definitely use this recipe when I need pasta sauce and don't have much time.

Simple to throw together when I realized I had no jar sauce for our quick spaghetti dinner.  Very tasty.  I added some mushrooms because I had some that needed to be used.

So simple, so delicious.  I used petite cut tomatoes and added fresh oregano and basil at the end.  I then used my immersion blender to make it slighty less chunky so that I could use it to make chicken parm sandwiches.  It was perfect.  I did not add salt because it didnot need it and we're cutting back on it.

Ingredients that are readily on hand, quick to prepare and cook, a snap of a clean-up makes for a great recipe.  Here's what I did:  pressed 2 small cloves of garlic, 2 8-oz cans (I used too much oregano and added a can to tame it) of tomato sauce, 2 tsp. sugar, 4 oz can of mushrooms.  I served this over lemon pepper spaghetti from this sight and covered with Parmesan cheese.  Very tasty.  I will be making this again and again with even more variations.  I think adding Italian sausage, green pepper, zucchini, and/or more will be delicious.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I was out of fresh onion and garlic, so I used minced versions of both. I didn't have a can of diced tomatoes, but I had a can of stewed. I also replaced white sugar with brown sugar (I don't use white sugar for health reasons.) The salt was replaced with garlic salt. This was a solid sauce. Nothing spectacular, but not bad, either.

I found this recipe several months ago but have not rated yet. It is very good. My grandchildren ate it up, even the one who doesn't like sauce on her spaghetti. I did add ground beef and mushrooms as we prefer it that way. I will no longer purchase canned sauce again.

Used fresh tomatoes and canned tomato sauce.  With plenty of oregano and basil it turned out fairly well.

Very good, but I am not fond of oregano and used basil instead. I would suggest doubling the recipe and if you like mushrooms, canned or fresh, throw those in as well.

Delish. Added 1 tsp dried oregano, 1 tsp basil, and salt & pepper to our taste.  I used a hand blender to make it less chunky.  Simmered meatballs in it.  Makes enough sauce for about 12 oz of spaghetti.

Eh this was ok. It was quite tangy. I suppose because I need more sugar or more simmering, but overall, this was just ok.

Really good. I used a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce, added 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning. Served with the Nirvana Meatballs and spaghetti (I cooked the meatballs in the sauce; meatball recipe is on this site) - excellent meal. My daughter asked that we have this every Wednesday, and dub the day "Spaghetti Wednesday".

I thought this recipe was great!  I added a little bit of italian seasoning, just to ensure the flavor was a little stronger.  Also I ended up adding a little extra sugar and a dash extra of salt.  The canned tomatoes were a little acidic.  I made one full recipe of this, but I felt like I needed more.  I used this sauce as a dip for meatballs.  Will definitely make this again, but in a larger quanity!

This was an easy recipe and was great as a pasta primavera sauce.

First time was a success.  Served this over the Garlic Cheese Chicken Rollups found elsewhere on this site.  This sauce was a perfect complement to the chicken.  Added another dash of oregano just for a stonger taste and increased the sugar by another 1/2 tsp to flavor the sauce.  I don't like sweet marinara sauces and this is nowhere close to that.  Definitely a keeper in the recipe box.

This is a great tasting and easy sauce. The only thing I had to change was to double the recipe, as we like a saucier pasta.

Very simple, tasty recipe. I can't say I loved it, but I may make again with added seasonings. Thanks!

This recipe was REALLY good...but I did make a few alterations.  I didn't add any onion, and doubled the garlic.  Also, I added basil.  I didn't want it quite as chunky, so I used my hand blender for a few seconds at the end.  I allowed it to simmer for about an hour!  YUM!
