I decided to make this recipe because it was faceless and needed a photo and also, I had all the ingredients on hand.  I baked it in a Nordic Ware Heritage Bundt pan for 1 hour.  The next time I bake it, I plan on adding almond extract and maybe a light chocolate glaze. The cinnamon was very faint. We love chocolate and cherries and combined together, they made a very moist cake. It is a keeper for me! Thanks for sharing!

Neither my husband nor I liked this cake.  I followed the recipe, didn't change or add.  Served it to  two different sets of friends.  The 2nd couple are closer friends and they both said put in some coconut and you have a fruit cake.  Bottom line, it was too heavy and not enough cherry flavor.

We have been making this recipe since I can remember. The only thing different is we spoon the batter into little cupcake holders. Then bake. Then sprinkle lightly with powder sugar. They are always a big hit.

It was okay, but tastes a little bit too much like a fruit cake. Too many nuts also.

Not a big hit in this house. Kind of dry. The cherries all sank to the bottom (the top when turned out of the pan). It was okay, but most of it was wasted. My son wouldn't even try it and my husband didn't like it. I truly wanted to like it, but I just didn't.

I replaced the unhealthy hydrogenated vegetable oil for grass fed butter,and toasted pecans and dark chocolate chips.  I made this for a potluck brunch in lieu of George Washington's birthday and it was gone eaten up..nothing left but the crumbs!

Just as good as it sounds in the recipe. I did use my own  homemade cherry topping to mix in. I will try sliced almonds next time. Fun easy cake recipe!
