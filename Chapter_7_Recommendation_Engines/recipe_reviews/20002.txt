This was just ok... nothing special and it even seemed to lack something but I don't know enough to know what's missing. I made the recipe exactly as written but I know in the past a close friend would make his in the crockpot and use a roast, cut up, instead of the chicken... I might try it that way but as is I probably won't make this again.

Good stuff!  My family said it reminded them of minestrone, but with cinnamon and cloves.  I added green beans and a red bell pepper for color and veggies and it turned out very well.

Wow. I will not make this again. The chicken was so tender it was falling off the bone (with all the little icky parts), so I picked all the chicken off the bones. I reduced and strained the broth and poured this over the pasta/chicken mixture (which I added a ton of salt and pepper to and the cut up onion). I then put cheese on top and melted it in the oven.  The dish still had no flavor. Sure it was edible, but certainly not any kind of tasty.
