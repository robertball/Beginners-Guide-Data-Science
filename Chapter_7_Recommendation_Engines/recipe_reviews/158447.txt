Y-U-M-M-Y! This was very very tasty! Both my husband and I are not crazy about tarter sauce so I thought I'd try this. It was sooo good! Nice alternative. I will definitely use this again. I didn't put it on a sandwhich, but used the oven-fried catfish recipe (also on this site) with it. I did use light mayo (healthier and delicious) and bumped up the ketchup, dill pickle, and worchestishire for my personal liking. Let it set a few minutes at least before serving.

I made this to do sandwiches but life happened so it sat in the fridge for a few.  Pulled it out tonight for Catfish Tacos and it was FAB.  Had to tone it down a bit with sour cream for dd but she loved it as well.

Easy and excellent with fish, or chicken tacos. We held the fresh parsley..and it is unlikely you will miss it.

As written, it was mild enough for my mother who is sensitive to heat.  It was quite mild. 
I'm going to add extra peppers in the future for my own gratification.

Topped some oven blackened catfish filets with this sauce.  Delicious.  Used garlic powder in place of fresh garlic (lazy) and used pickle relish in place of pickle juice.

This was sooo good. I also made it to serve with the catfish cakes and spinach brownies from this site. I didnt have the dill pickle juice so I used balsamic vinegar. Thank you!
