I made half the recipe, going light on the herbs because I thought they might be too much as written.  They weren't.  I'd make this as written, especially if you are lucky enough to get a thick slice of halibut like we scored for tonight.  I made my own herbes de Provence using a recipe from this site, and everything else was as written.  I would make this again in a heartbeat!  Thank you so much, Luke----my hubby thanks you, too!

Delicious!  First time I cooked halibut. So tender, melted in your mouth. Sauce was perfect- complimented the delicate fish without overpowering it.

Be sure to use cedar... I used hickory planks and soaked them for two hours.  This did not fare well.

Wow!  What a great recipe!  The only thing I changed was,  I used fresh tarragon instead of the dried because the dried  was not available.  It would be a great way to prepare fish for a large dinner.

This was the best halibut I've had so far! The flavours were amazing with the herbed butter and smokey flavour of the cedar truly knocked it out of the park. I took hints from other reviewers and made my own herb mixture and layered some lemon slices on the top keep the halibut moist.

Excellent. Absolutely delicious. One thing I did was charred the side of the plank I placed the fish on.
Iâ€™m going to try it on an Alder plank instead of a Cedar one next time.
Definitely have to soak the plank more than 30 minutes, more like half a day.

I made some minor changes to the marinade/sauce. We did not have Herbs de Provence, and some mebers of the family are dairy free, so I substituted 1) a similar type of herb mix and 2) olive oil for the butter.  I did everything else exactly as suggested. The family loved it. They said it looked and tasted like something you would get in a good restaurant. We will definitely use this recipe again. Cedar Planks are the bomb.

This was amazing! Easy to do and fabulous! I substituted some of the herbs but i did use tarragon and dill. Wow Yum! Wish i would have soaked the plank longer as it caught fire, but maybe that added to the flavor. I usedsome if the butter mixture to flavor my sauteed squash and rainbow chard

The recipe is great as is!  Even though it seems like a lot of herbs, it isn't.  I cut bad on the butter by 1/3 and added olive oil instead.  It worked beautifully!  I also added a little more lemon and hot paprika to make it a little spicy.  It was truly perfect!

This is just a fantastic way to cook Halibut or Sea Bass. We've done it about 10 times now, wouldn't change a thing.

Great Halibut recipe, marinade was spot on. On cedar planking, preheat your soaked plank 5 mins on high till it smokes a bit and begins to crackle. Turn down heat to low and drop your fish on. Marinade did run off the plank and catch fire igniting the plank, a spray bottle is a must have.

This was amazing just as written. We had several courses coming off the grill that night and this took best of the BBQ. Thanks so much for sharing.

This is the best halibut recipe I've every tried.  The only think I did different was I used fresh herbs.  The fresh herbs were the perfect balance of taste.

Great flavor on the halibut  covered the halibut with lemon slices during grilling to keep it moist and add a bit more citrus.

Yumm! I love halibut & kind of consider it the "lobster" of fish, so delicate & pure. This grilled on the cedar plank added an amazing flavor profile. Hubby loved it for his birthday dinner!! Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe!
