This recipe turned out excellent. I made multiple batches, and substituted cayenne for chipotle in one of them. This tasted amazing on a pork roast. Everyone loved it.

I substituted coconut sugar for the brown sugar to make it paleo friendly and I left out the cayenne pepper because my husband and kids can't take spicy, but this is probably the best bbq rub we've used!  I use it on ribs that I slow cook in the oven and they are always a huge hit with my family!

I wanted to try this with popcorn, so I scaled it down to 1 serving and still had a little leftover. I popped my corn in coconut oil and also melted some to drizzle over the popped corn before sprinkling with the rub (in two batches). For the paprika, I used half sweet and something new for me, half smoked. I also like the sweet taste from the brown sugar and may increase the next time. Went very light with the cayenne. Look forward to trying this with various meats or even fish. Nice recipe!

OMG! I love this recipe. It is my go to for pork and chicken. There have been times I have forgotten to rub it on and let sit in fridge for a few hours which in turn caused me to do some last minute applying and popping into the oven, it still tasted awesome! Family loves this and it is even good with or w/o brushing BBQ sauce on. HMMM MHMMM GOOD!

Absolutely fantastic and exactly what I was looking for. This recipe is a little sweet, and then bang spicy! I wouldn't change a thing. Thank you for sharing. We have a new family favorite and I cannot wait for our next BBQ so we can try this out on others.

Very good! This recipe will definitely be used again! I rubbed it on chicken leg quarters and let it sit in the fridge all day, then my hubby grilled it to absolute perfection! YUM!!!

Great, classic and simple rub recipe! I usually do a rub just like this, but I add just a tad of cumin. A little cumin goes a long way in adding that little bit of extra flavor.

So delicious! I had little time so I just rubbed it in and put the chicken in the fridge while I roasted red potatoes. I didnt have enough paprika so i substituted smoked paprika for about a quarter of the amount needed. I was also short on chili powder and added a little over 1/4 tsp of cumin. (i converted recipe to 6 servings and this amount covered 6 breasts with just a little left over). I also added only 1/4 tsp cayenne for the six serving recipe.

I reduced the paprika to 1/4 cup because I didn't have much and it still turned out great! I'll do that going forward because I don't see the need for the full measure. I use this for ribs, 3rd batch in the oven. No need for sauce with this recipe

This is an awesome recipe to keep handy in a mason jar.  I'm heading out to visit an ailing relative and I'm packing some chicken and veggies plus my jar of THIS BBQ Spice Rub AND the recipe.  It's bound to make for an easy meal and I'll leave her with a keepsake recipe.  My thanks to Brenda McGrath for sharing this recipe.

We really liked this on grilled chicken legs. I used half a recipe for one large package of legs, and I cut back a bit on the paprika and black pepper. I used a heaping tablespoon of olive oil to coat the chicken in, put all the spices in a ziplock bag, and then just shook the legs in the spices. Turned out great and no BBQ sauce needed for us. I'll be making this again.

Good flavor with a bit of spice. We substituted the brown sugar with coconut flour to make it Whole30 compliant.

I used this on a chicken and the coating fell flat in my opinion.  I do plan to try this rub on rib eye in the near future.

This is a great starter base recipe.  As we all know that this is only a canvas for more flavour.  I tried turmeric, lemon pepper,   cumin, fennel and coriander.  When I picked out a meat I used some of the others to accent the flavour of what I was barbecuing.   The quantities are a guess so what flavour you like start with a small amount commensurate to the other quantities.

Good, basic rub.  I made half a recipe and had plenty for several racks of ribs.  Keeps well in a tightly sealed glass jar.  I'll substitute part smoked paprika next time, I think.

I cut the recipe in half and was able to marinate chicken with the spice rub over night.  It was delicious.  I cooked the dark meat at 325 degrees for about an hour, until the skin was crispy.

I made this for guests a few days ago.  Everyone asked for the recipe and they ate every chicken thigh that I grilled.  They will all be receiving a jar of the rub along with the recipe.   easy and so delicious!

I used this recipe as the base for my rub, and then added cumin, turmeric, and red pepper flakes for a bit more spice. It’s a great recipe and perfect for experimenting with and making it your own.

I was looking for a spice rub like this to make air fryer pork chops.  I substituted Splenda Brown Sugar Blend since I can't have regular sugar.  This is my favorite rub.

Great rub but would go less on the cayenne if you are opting for it. Also a bit more salt but thats just personal preference because I love salt! Overall very good was a definite hit for bbq tonight.

Awesome. Subbed in a friends crawfish boil spice mix for the chilli powder. This recipe would tolerate any kind of adjstment you want to make. I rubbed Chicken with oil then rolled in spices, and put on the barbecue. It left the chicken moist, spicy, and really really good! Easy and quick. My son loved!

Added a bit more salt to get it to our liking.  Simple and versitile mix with a great flavor.  We even combine this to ranch dressing to make a great BBQ dip for summer!

This was amazing, I used it on ribs, boneless pork chops, and a whole pork tenderloin. I rubbed the ribs, loin, and ribs with this rub the day before I smoked them (Used sassafras wood) and they were all great. Everyone said the rub made it top tier smoked meat....I agree.

Really nice rub! I used it to roast pork tenderloin. I wanted more of a grilled flavor, so I subbed half smoked paprika and half regular and used chipotle pepper instead of cayenne. Still pretty true to the recipe, just more smoke flavor.

I made it several months ago as written and it was great.  Others  commented positively as well.   It is a terrific base for being creative and adding other ingredients to make it your own. The second time I made it  I added smoked black pepper, a tablespoon of smoked paprika, and a teaspoon of ancho chili pepper powder.  This was a darker and richer version.  Next time I am going to double the original and keep it to use or adjust with different ingredients as needed.
Can't help it.  Added some ground expresso.  What a great starter!

Beautiful Rub. I did make a couple changes, for people in my house with digestive and spice issues, this is actually the 2nd time I've made it. Used Chipotle in 1/2 the amount this time instead of the red pepper,  and cut down on the salt and  pepper, but it's an awesome precursor to your fav BBQ sauce (Dealing with 2 people with GERD and one with a removed gall bladder and spice issues). I love the addition of the Sweet Baby Ray's Regular or Honey BBQ sauce at the end of cooking time. This is my First review of all the recipes I've tried here, has the approval of all 4 people I feed daily

I doubled the recipe because I was doing a very large piece of pork but it went a long way.  I ended up putting the remainder in a sealed glass container.  Very good.

I made this rub for pork chops and the amount of brown sugar and paprika that the recipe calls for was a little over powering but then I made the rub again with half of the amount of brown sugar and paprika and put on a pork loin and it was much more balanced and overall much more tasteful.

I used this on bone-in chicken breasts and cooked them on the grill. WOW! What a great rub. I put this on about 4 hours before cooking, and only used a tiny amount of bbq sauce to baste the chicken. I was worried that the chicken wouldn't taste good without a nice bbq coating but I was wrong. Next time I won't even use any bbq sauce.

The rub was sweet and a little hot - a perfect blend. I made the full batch and used 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne. The kids were not bothered by the pepper at all! I used 4 large chicken breast and ended up with 1/2 of the rub left over. I put it in a ziplock and will use it again soon. Thanks for the recipe!

This rub has a delicious flavor - one of the best in terms of taste I've tried. However, it is rather strong even in small amounts. I wouldn't recommend using this on flavorful cuts of meat or with a sauce, because it would overpower the taste of everything else.

I was aiming for a sweeter, calmer BBQ dry rub because my little sister can't eat cayenne. I substituted the cayenne for dark roast coffee grounds (sounds insane, I know) but it turned out amazing! If you don't feel like shelling out $4-8 for a tiny can of the Trader Joe's coffee BBQ blend, using this recipe with the alteration I made is a perfect dupe! Tastes so amazing, will use again.

Easy to make and follow. The rub is sweet, but quite versatile. Also great to store and use as need!

I've been using this rub recipe for years with on my ribs, chicken and pork (chops, loin or roast).  It's a great all-round rub and I keep it on hand at all times!

Loved this recipe! I was looking for an alternative to just putting BBQ sauce on the chicken when I grill it, so we looked around and found this recipe! It was absolutely yummy! The only thing I changed (I made this exact recipe the first time) was instead of regular paprika we use smoked paprika... it was great on the grill!

This is a great basic rub recipe. I used it on a couple of chickens I roasted and it was delicious! It will go well on pork with a little ground dry mustard added.
 I'm definitely going to make a large batch of this to keep on hand and doctor it up as needed or use as is. Yummy!

I came across this recipe nearly 3 years ago, but never wrote down what was in it when I bagged it. A week ago I found this again and made it. The new mix smells and tastes a lot stronger than the old one, even with leaving out the cayenne. The old mix has some sort of seed in it, probably fennel or cumin, so I believe I experimented with it the first time. Still good though.

This recipe is excellent. You grill or smoke a slab of ribs one time with a dry rub and you'll never use sauce again. The first I ever made I followed the recipe to the T (something I've noticed people rarely do on here-stupid!). I've made it subsequent times with only minimal changes, always using the same recipe pretty much.

Just made this to put on a pork roast in the crockpot. Smells and looks good, easy to make. We'll see how it tastes in about 10 hours! :)

I originally made this rub to use on ribs.  I didn't have cayenne so subbed chipotle powder instead, which lent an even more smokiness to it.  The other night though, I used it to spice up sweet potato fries before I baked them.  Oh my gosh, so good!

Really great change from the sugar laden sauces. I found that there was a slight sweetness, but overall nice and spicy.  Will use again and perhaps finish my chicken with a bit of honey drizzled over prior to serving.

I love the simplicity of the recipe and adjusting the quantity of, or adding, an ingredient can easily change it up.  Smoked paprika is a must for me!  Great recipe!
