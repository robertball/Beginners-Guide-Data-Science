Second time making it. So simple, inexpensive and very tasty. He would prefer a little heat be added though, some green Tabasco, diced red onion. I think it's yummy as is... You decide!! Enjoy!!

It was good, but you have to take the mussels out of the shells for them to soak up the flavors. I would also remove the red wine vinegar and use fresh lemon juice instead. Needed an extra bit of something.
