The recipe's basic concept is fantastic, but unless you love raw vegetables in your mashed potatoes there is an important step missing.  This recipe is much improved by sauteeing the garlic, onion and peppers before adding them to the mashed potatoes.  actually, it's terrific if you cook the vegetables first.  I would have given this recipe a much higher rating, but due to the raw vegetables, I only am giving it three stars.

I followed the ingredients list but winged it on the amounts, just adding and stirring until it looked right to me.  I used a dribble of buttermilk rather than the 1/2 cup milk, only because I had some to use.  I sauteed the onions before I added them because they would only get heated for 15 minutes and I wanted them cooked.  One jalapeno rather than two was friendlier to Hubs' sensitive innards.  I used more butter and sour cream than called for and added some of the Cheddar and bacon (I used the real thing) to the potatoes rather than just sprinkling it over the top.  The results were a real taste sensation, odd since there is no seasoning!  The peppers and bacon not only make these potatoes colorful and festive, they add a zippiness of flavor.  The recipe is very worthy of being repeated, but I will keep in mind that 2 c. of shredded cheese was way more than I needed, even after adding a good amount to the potato mixture.

I have to agree, I love potato skins or any potato, but after making these for the game, after the first batch, I just sauteed the veggies together before baking and adding the cheese.  The guys enjoyed and loved them.  Thanks for the post.

Hi there.  I'm Keri, the person who posted this recipe.  I submitted as is due to the fact that I like raw vegetables but since this posting (2006) have found that it would be best to cook the onion and peppers first.  Wonderful suggestion!  My intention for the sour cream is to top the potato and is optional but it does taste great to add it into the potato mixture as well.  I submitted the edits about 2 years ago, it takes a while for it to be processed.  Also, use real bacon, not fake bacon pieces if you can.  Thank for all of the nice reviews.  I'm glad you all have enjoyed is as much as I do.

I made these to go along with a southwestern flank steak and they were so yummy!  I did cook the peppers and onions first before adding them to the potatoes as someone had suggested.  I don't think I would've liked them raw.  They were a huge hit and a new favorite!  Thanks!

Help! Nobody told me what to do with the onion and sour cream! I mixed those 2 ingredients in with the rest, everything worked out. I used green onion for the onion and yellow peppers instead of gree. This took a little longer than 15 minutes to heat, but was really yummy when finished. Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't like the raw onion in this. It didn't get cooked enough for our tastes. I omitted the bell peppers, but I can only assume that those remain crunchy too. Otherwise, I liked these. I used a little more sour cream than was recommended, and a little less milk -- because we prefer the flavor of sour cream. The texture was not compromised. This is easily customizable to your personal tastes. I suggest using kosher salt and oil on the outside of the potatoes during the baking stage, so that the skins are flavored too, so you can slice and eat the ENTIRE thing! Thanks for the recipe. P.S. I subtracted a star because the recipe doesn't tell you when to use the onion and sour cream. It's apparently been like that for at least 3 years now and no one has bothered to edit it :(

very good, definitely sautee veggies first. i also used a chorizo link chopped up instead of the bacon. 2 potato halves are more than enough for a meal.

I thought these were really good. I followed the recipe exactly, but cut it back to 3 servings. In the future, the only change I will make is to add more butter/milk. 

The only change that I made was I did not cut my potatoes in half, I just hollowed the whole potato out, and then restuffed. They were really pretty.

These were delicious!  I did saute the onions, pepper and jalapeno first.  I do love raw veggies but wasn't in the mood for them today.  Great flavor!  Not sure where the sour cream was supposed to come in to play, so I just dalloped it on top when I was ready to eat it!  DELICIOUS!!!

I sauteed the veggies prior . We love potatoes, any kind in my house. Baked potatoes are number 1. I often make twice baked potatoes. This mix is a different way to make them from my norm. The family, and company loved these potatoes !!!!

I left the milk out and instead I added jalapeno juice. There were the most tasty twice baked I have ever made.

After reviewing all the comments I decided to try these for my Bunco night!  What a hit!  Thanks for sharing!  And thanks for updating to agree the veggies should be cooked first! :)

These were the best!  I didn't have any peppers, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

I did make changes per my own tastes. I put in 2 eggs and omitted the jalepenos (I served them on the side as I can't eat them)  I also baked off some bacon nice and crispy and crumbled some inside & outsude the taters. soooo yummy. heeheehee.

Yes, for the first time but you have to be careful taking skin out. I'm a get out as much as you can so I broke the skin in some places but it still was edible. Probably don't try and  get out all the flesh. I didn't add the bacon and onions for health reasons but still was good with everything else. Will make again.
