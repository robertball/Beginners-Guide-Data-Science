I made this the other day for a Mardi Gras get together and it was a hit!  I added 1/2 cup chopped pecans but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I used an 8" cake pan that I lined with wax paper, mix everything up (except jam), poured it in and left to sit overnight.  When I was ready for the party, I inverted it onto a large plate, topped with the rasberry jam (I thought it would be prettier and easier to eat this way) that I surrounded with Wheat Thin crackers.  Super easy and tasty too!

Very delicious appetizer. I brought it to work an hour ago and have already given the recipe away twice. I added a package of cream cheese, used a couple shakes each of cayenne and garlic powder and molded into a ball, which I rolled in chopped pecans and covered with seedless raspberry jam. I think strawberry jam may go better with this dish, but that's me. I also think this is much better on Ritz type crackers than Wheat Thins. Looks very fancy with minimal work and tastes fabulous! Update: I have since made this ball with red plum jam and I think it to be MUCH better than the raspberry and you can usually find a generic.

I've made this recipe a few times now and think it's great!  I did make the following adjustments: Add 1 block of cream cheese (I whip a room temperature block in the bowl prior to adding any other ingredients), in addition to cayenne and garlic salt, I also added onion powder, paprika and garlic powder (about 1/2 tsp of each.  I mix the seasoning into the cream cheese before adding the remaining ingredients).  I use a combination of sharp and mild cheddar cheeses (50/50 of each) and I make this dip the night before to allow the flavors to blend.  I also recommend using a 8" springform pan (lined and sprayed with butter flavored Pam) instead of the jello ring. Once the dip is turned out on a plate, top with raspberry preserves, chopped pecans and fresh raspberries.  It tastes great and looks fantastic!  By using a springform pan, you can get the dip and preserves in each bit...which is really yummy.  This is very simple to make and tastes great!

The ultimate appetizer. I like to add chopped pecans & prefer strawberry preserves & triscuits. LOVE it. You've got to convince people to eat the jelly with it - that's what makes it spectacular.

A friend gave me a similar recipe, and it is a favorite. I don't use green onion, just finely chopped yellow onion. Also black pepper instead of cayenne. She puts finely chopped pecans in the with the mix to taste. Put it in a jello mold overnight to get the flavor thru. turn over and put strawberry jam in the middle. Perfect with Riyz or tricuits. Delicious!

I made this for a family Christmas Eve buffet and everyone liked it. I used strawberry jam in a center bowl inside the cheese ring with crispy wheat crackers. Would definitely make again.

I have lost this recipe and thanks to the "search ingredients" this came up.  My original recipe calls for spreading the mixture into a small springform pan, then spreading the raspberry jam on top- I always served it on a cake platter for a nice presentation. I also use half mild and half sharp cheddar- this is so good and everyone wants the recipe!

What a great recipe!! I altered it a little by adding the green parts of the onions (great flavor and color!), use Lawry's Garlic Salt and sprinkling chopped pecan pieces over the top.  My family & friends could make a meal of it! You won't be disappointed!!

It does sound weird, but it is really good and everyone tries to get some cheese and some preserve on each cracker. I use strawberry jam rather than raspberry preserves. Everyone loves this.

This was really good, and my family raved about it at Thanksgiving dinner.  Be careful with the green onions.  I didn't think the amount the recipe called for would add much flavor, so I got a little carried away and probably doubled them.  Very strong!  Used a springform pan and seedless black raspberry jam.  Would definitely make again.

I make this regularly and once you get people to try it it will go fast!  I pick an air tight container the size of what I want the shape to be, spray w/ cooking spray, and put the cheese in that. I always make this a day or two before I am going to serve it to let the flavors blend.  Then, it is ready to go and I pop it out onto a serving tray, spread jam, and I prefer to top with chopped nuts.  Sometimes if I am taking it somewhere I serve it right out of the container - which is even easier!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a huge hit at a baby shower I recently hosted.  I did add some chopped pecans and my mold was a springform pan for lack of something else.  I put it on a glass pedestal cake plate and put raspberry jam on the top.  I used jam because I was unable to find preserves that were not sugar free.  Everyone raved about it.

All Recipes, thanks again for such a great find!!!!

Fantastic!  It might sound strange but once people try the jam and cheese they are hooked.  I made this at Christmas too. I shaped it into a wreath and served it with jalopena jelly, and garnished it with red and green peppers to look like holly. Everone ask for the recipe. Thanks!

This is very good. I made this for a church function and it is easy and looks like you really fussed over it, when it is all nicely displayed on a pretty plate or platter.The flavor combo is sooooooo yummy! I did not have a ring mold, so used a bundt cake pan and it worked fine.I also used gouda cheese as I had a pound of that in the fridge. I mixed the few leftovers together and we ate it the next day,on crackers, so good.

11.23.12 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/80561/cheese-ring/ ... After reading other recipes & reviews, I changed it just a little.  I subbed strawberry preserves & didn't add garlic salt; but did add 8oz lowfat cream cheese, 1/8t salt & 1/2t cayenne pepper.  First try, I forgot about the preserves & it wasn't anything special.  'Could tell the cayenne was there, but still not hot, just could tell.  With the preserves, soooo muuuuch better.  Preserves lessened the spice even more so I'm thinking up to 1t wouldn't be too much if you just want to know it's there, but if you're going for hot, you may want even more.  Note4Me:  See Sue's review.  Add a block of cream cheese.  Add 1t worcestershire. See TheresaR - springform pan.

This recipe is great but it is actually an enhanced version of pimiento cheese just without the pimientos.  You can use pimientos if you want to give it some red and green Christmas colors-green from the onions, red from the pimientos.

I've made this recipe and included cream cheese and it was good too.

This is a great recipe.  I've taken it to several parties and it's always a hit.  I use hot pepper jelly rather then the raspberry jelly just because I like the extra heat.

I made this for my wedding reception and it was a huge hit.  The combination of cheese and jelly is delightful.  The rings freeze and thaw well, great for making in advance.

Great recipe!  I've made this so many times and it is A L W A Y S  a hit.  It is true though, the jelly throws anyone off from trying it!  I literally had to place a serving on a cracker and hand it to them and say "try it" and then.....they were hooked!!!!  THANK YOU!!!

This is excellent. We used grape jelly (had it on hand) but otherwise followed the recipe. Some people wouldn't even try the cheese & jelly combination. Well, more for us!!  It is great!

This is definitely a hit! I make sure I tell everyone they have to try it with the jelly before knocking it(I use a 4 fruit preserve). I also use half sharp and half regular chedder. I don't have cayenne, so I use a little chili powder and couple dashes of crushed red pepper. I use a little more mayo then it calls for, just to make it stick together better, and I use a Pam sprayed bundt pan, don't have a jello mold.I have made it for 4 gatherings and it is always the talk of the night!

I loved this recipe, I made it for my book club and everyone looked at it a bit funny, but once tasted, everyone dug right in!!... I did use strawberry jelly instead of raspberry, that I processed to get out the big chunks of strawberries.

I used half sharp and half mild cheddars, spread strawberry preserves all over the ring and served it with Triscuits and Ritz crackers. Everyone was so surprised how delicious the cheese/jelly combination was, they couldn't stop eating it - not a drop was left!

Good recipe but I tweaked it.  I used the whole green onion and instead of the jelly recommended, I used red pepper jelly and brushed it on the outside and filled the center with it.  It gave it a nice Christmasy look with the red and green together and it tasted divine.  Used it for a small gathering of just five friends and we ate almost the whole thing:)

BUT...I like to put slithered almonds, bacon bits and the green part of the onions - it really tastes great.  The green onions with the red strawberry jam - make it look very festive!!!!!

Made this for a Red Hat party today.  Everyone loved it.  I used 1 1/2 teaspoon dried minced onion since I did not have any green onions on hand. Also added some chopped pecans.   I know I will be making this often.

I really liked this.  I would never have thought to put rasperry preserves with cheese, and I have never made a cheese ball of any kind.  I did put nuts on the outside before the preserves.  YUM!

Went over well at my all-girl party tonight.  I did add chopped pecans to the preserves (I used strawberry - I almost wish I'd used the raspberry, it might not have been so sweet - but I was worried about the seeds in the raspberries being bothersome).  I made the mold a night ahead to let the flavors meld.  I too used half sharp and half mild cheddar.  I'd certainly make again.

Everybody liked this - I thought is was ok.  I usually make another similiar recipe which uses 1 C mayo, 1 C scallions, and 1 Cup Cheddar baked in bread bowl until warm and bubbly.  I think I will stick with that one - but if you make this one make sure you use the preserves.  It would not be the same without it.

I've paid an arm and a leg for a similar cheese ring for years, and this is just as good, and so easy!  I did find I needed to add a couple TBSP more of the mayo.  I sprayed a bundt pan well with Pam, and let the mold sit overnight.  Then, I just had to loosen the edges with a knife and turn it into a platter.  Chopped pecans on top are a must, and I serve strawberry preserves in the center of the ring. Makes for a great presentation!  Thanks so much for the recipe!!

This recipe is just awesome!  For a little change and variety, I also add some chopped walnuts to the mix before making it into a ring!  DELICIOUS!

I also use chopped pecans in the mixture. And, I have always used strawberry preserves and Breton crackers. Every time I make this I am asked for the recipe. It is always a hit. Love it!!

I don't know what happened, but this wouldn't set up for me.  It was more like a very soft spread.  The flavor was wonderful, though!

For all of you who see this recipe and think, "WHAT?".  Never fear.  This is a good recipe.  I made it this past Christmas to take to my in-laws.  I formed the cream cheese mixture into a log shape instead of the ring.  This was quite tasty and very festive.  A must for the holidays.

Made this for a little happy hour gathering of neighbors last night. It was super easy. I did add more pepper & garlic salt, a pinch is hardly worth the effort. I didn't measure, just sprinkled it. I still didn't taste it, so you could add more if you want more. Anyway, it was a hit and everyone loved it.  I would make it again. Oh, & I used a bundt pan for my ring since I didn't have anything else.

Whipped in a block of Neufchâtel along with light mayo. Also added 1/2 cup chopped pecans and spread strawberry jam on top. Huge hit at a Christmas party!

Perfect as is! Admittedly, I undercut the mayo a bit, only because I’ve gotten burned by recipes that call for an amount that overtakes the flavor. The green onions give it a slight fresh crunch that breaks up the cheesiness. The spice is perfect, adding slight heat. Bought a big block of sharp white cheddar and shredded it on the large end. Raspberry is the perfect compliment, I wouldn’t try another type of jelly/jam! Used mini bundt pans as a mold and it made 3, perfect for a crowd where you can have more than one munchie area! :D

So glad I found this recipe. I used to make it years ago when I belonged to a bridge group.  It was always very popular and I loved it when I told everyone what was in it.  They couldn't believe cheese, onions and jelly could taste so good.  I too use sweet yellow onions, black pepper and chopped pecans.  I also mix it with a big wooden spoon, don't needs a mixer if you use finely grated cheese.  Keep it simple. I make my own mold on a serving tray.  When we played cards I would make several small ones in the shape of the suits ( diamonds, hearts, etc) for the different tables.

I've made something similar to this and shaped it into a snowman complete with a red pepper scarf, arms, eyes, carrot nose, mouth... the works!  He was soooo cute and everyone LOVED it!!  (I put the reserves on the side so it wouldn't make a mess).  :)

I make this as often as possible for parties and celebrations.  Everyone loves it and asks for the recipe.  It is hard to stop eating this one.  Yummy!  I use a small yellow onion (grated) and strawberry perserves.
