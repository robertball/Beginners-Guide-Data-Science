Made this last night. Really good. I added a layer of cooked, crumbled ground beef. My family raved -- even my daughter who does not care for lasagna had a second helping! This morning they asked if we could have leftovers tonight. Sure!! Serves WAY more than 8, more like 12. Be sure to use real mozzarella, not the shredded in a bag. Delicious. This will be my lasagna recipe from now on!

Awesome basic cheese lasagna recipe!  Careful, it makes a HUGE quantity and overflowed a bit in my dish.  The yummy taste was worth the drippings on my oven floor though.  Good recipe!

This is a really good and easy base recipe. I add diced, cooked onions & garlic, as well as cooked ground beef to the sauce. I also mix in parmesan, and all of my italian herbs & spices with the ricotta mixture. Delicious!

I was satisfied with the outcome of the recipe everything mixed and cooked well I did not add enough sauce on the edges to keep the noodles from crisping :-(. Overall I enjoyed the lasagna, I think I may have added too much mozzarella and not enough ricotto. I will definetly attempt to remake. I matched with a roasted vegetable medley found elsewhere on this site.

Overall I think this turned out really well. Next time I will use a little less sauce on each layer, as it turned out too saucy for my liking. Also, there was no way all of the layers would fit in my baking dish, so I cut out one of the layers...and it was still overflowing! I will try this again with less sauce, thanks for the recipe!

This was overall pretty good.  Expensive to make with all the cheese, but the end product was delicious.

I made this last week and it pretty much lasted a week feeding only two people. It does keep very well in the refrigerator; it was just as good the sixth day as the first day! I will say that the math in the directions doesn't quite work out- if you use 1 1/2 cups of sauce in each layer, you don't have enough for the top layer! But overall, really good for cheese-lovers!

Did not have lasagna noodles so I made /w/ small shells instead. Sort of like a pasta bake but layering like a lasagna. The amounts called for were perfect, I would change nothing. I only have me and my boyfriend so I made it in 2 small dishes and froze one for a nice meal when I don't have time to cook.  Thanks.

This was wonderful!  I used over ready noodles instead of cooking them,and traditional spaghetti sauce along with an extra can of tomato sauce to make it a little saucier. Also added garlic and dried parsley to the ricotta cheese mixture.
