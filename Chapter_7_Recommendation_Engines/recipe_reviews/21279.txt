This was great, my husband loved it and it is very filling.  I did make a few alterations to the original recipe:  I used 2 1/2 cups of chicken broth and water combined in place of the 2 cups of water.  I also heated the pecans in the oven a few minutes to give them a more nutty flavor.  It needed more salt added before serving to bring out all the flavors. Remember, brown rice has a short shelf life and should be kept in the freezer.  If this recipe doesn't turn out, your rice or your spices may be old.

I think brown rice needs to be cooked with 2-1/2 cups water per 1 cup rice, so I adjusted it accordingly.  I toasted the pecans after chopping them.  This was excellent--the pecans adds a great crunch!  I will be making this again and again.

By far, this is the best brown rice recipe I've found up until now.  I did use seasoned chicken broth instead of water and that probably made a huge difference.

This is a great recipe!  The only changes I made were 1. I added a little more onion and a tiny bit more of all of the seasonings to compensate, and 2. At the end I added a few drizzles of olive oil to moisten up the dish.  The flavor is wonderful and the pecans go so well with the brown rice - this dish is a keeper! It's also a great dish for company and I imagine it would go really well with chicken.

Follow the cooking directions for whatever brown rice you purchased... some take more time to cook, some more fluid to cook. Use chicken broth instead of water to add more flavor to rice. Outstanding recipe.

Hands down this is the best rice recipes I've ever had. My husband was hoping for more but it was gone. I made it just how it says but with real butter not plastic-y margarine.

Thank you for this recipe for brown rice.  I now can enjoy eating brown rice.  We tried this as a side dish for grilled chicken and every bite was gone.  We will be making this a lot. Thanks

I liked this recipe for dressing up the rice.  Next time I would use less pecans, though.

I was searching for a pecan or walnut rice recipe to pair with Salmon.  I read some of the reviews and decided to make a few changes.  I used chicken broth instead of water, fresh ginger (because it was cheaper), dried parsley, and more onion than what the recipe called for.  I followed the rest of the recipe and it was yummy!  I enjoyed every bite of this recipe!  I'm usually a white rice eater, but I will definitely make this again.  This is a great way to get your family to eat brown rice.  Btw - I used Food Network's recipe for Salmon baked in foil and served it with the Pecan rice.

I was looking for a side to go with a pecan-crusted chicken. I was worried that this may be too many pecans in a meal, but it was perfect! I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used chicken boullion instead of just water; also cooked the rice in the rice cooker. I also used more onions than the recipe called for, and fresh ginger instead of dry. It was a hit with my family - even my picky 4 year old!

This was pretty tasty. Just giving 4 stars because the water needs to be replaced with chicken broth for better flavor, and I had to up the seasonings as it was a bit bland.  Overall, it's a solid recipe and you can season it to fit your taste buds.

Following the directions on the package of rice, I used 2 cups of water (1 1/2  cups of low sodium chicken broth and 1/2 cup of water to be exact). The chicken broth was a great suggestion and I'm glad that I used it instead of plain water. I read on another site that cinnamon is a good substitute for ginger, it is not! It really changed the flavor of the rice which I enjoyed, but my hubby did not. Left the parsley out and didn't even miss it.

This was very good & filling! I cooked it in chicken broth (good ole' Swanson) instead of water to give it more flavor. Also, I use dried parsley since it's what I had on hand. The pecans & ginger gave it a great flavor! Also, I think it makes more like 5 servings instead of 4. I served it with a roasted broccoli from this site and Hawaiian chicken from Cooking Light magazine. Husband said the meal was "restaurant quality" :)

Love this recipe!!  I used white rice instead of brown and added the rice in skillet at the end to mix the flavors & heat up the rice.  Great with salmon, but a meal in itself.  Delicious!

Made exactly as written, I liked it, my husband found the combination of ginger and basil inedible. Were it up to me I would make it again, but I've been asked not to. I may try altering the seasoning a bit to please the family.  Thank you for a good starting point!

I used jasmine rice and added a squeeze of lime at the end. I like it but it had to be salted quite a bit. Will make it again.

I wasn't sure how great this would be, but I was sick of plain brown rice.  It was great!  I used the 2-1/2 cups water to one cup rice ratio and I used chicken broth in place of water.  It was really delicious!

This was yummy!  I think next time I might add a little more ginger and basil.  I made these adjustments: toasted the pecans first, added celery and more onion than called for, used dried parsley and fresh basil because that's what I had.  Delish!

This is delicious - have made it with brown rice and white Basmati rice to rave reviews!  I also made it using quinoa - a great alternative to rice.  I slightly toasted the quinoa before boiling for an even nuttier flavour.   Mmmmm, now my new favourite side dish.

As written, I felt this recipe was subpar.  Although it smelled wonderful, it turned out bland and on the dry side.  I added some half and half and a lot more ginger, basil, pepper and salt and the result was quite delicious.  I will continue to make a tweaked version of this recipe.  Kudos for the general idea.

Nice flavors. I also used chicken broth to cook the rice and toasted the chopped pecans a few minutes (very briefly) to bring out the nuttiness.

This was really good. My rice was a little dry, but I'm sure that's my fault. This dish didn't knock my socks off and I probably wouldn't serve it at special gatherings, but it's a easy and healthy side dish that my family actually ate. I would make again.

I made this following the recipe and found it to be very bland.  That being said, if I changed the recipe to cooking the rice in chicken broth, it would probably be a wonderful rice dish.  I will try that next time since I think it has potential.

I added fresh pineapple at the end but salad was also good without it. I substituted chicken broth and added celery for crunch. I also used fresh ginger. Loved this recipe!

This a very tasty way to make brown rice.Except for substituting parsley flakes for fresh and following te advice of other reviewers and using  2 and 1/2 cups of water, I followed the recipe as written. We enjoyed this and I think it would be fancy enough to serve for company. Thanks for posting

I served this with the Baked Dijon Salmon recipe on this site and even though there were only two of us, there were almost no leftovers.  This is the best brown rice recipe I've had and will definitely be making it again.

I used fresh herbs instead of dried ones and chicken stock in place of water and it turned out delicious. I omitted the ginger because I did not have any on hand. I will definately make this again! It was very flavorful--soo good!

I used 2 1/2 c. chicken broth as it's usually double and a half of the liquid you'd usually use with long grain white rice. I added fresh garlic and sauteed it in the butter with the onion before I added the chicken broth and omitted the parsley and basil because I really wanted the rice to compliment the Cajun Meatballs I made for dinner. This rice took 45 minutes to cook for me but I'd determined a long time ago that i'm not a great cook of brown rice. This was a good side that I'll make again and again. The pecans went fabulously with the brown rice, like they were made for each other. My older boy and husband disagreed. Too bad.

This recipe is a keeper! I substituted beef broth for water and used a mixture of cashews and pecans (because I ran short of pecans). I was a bit skeptical because I'm not a fan of ginger, but the ginger is key to a robust, nutty flavor.

I increased the onions and pecans a little to bump up the flavor, and substituted butter for the margarine. Next time I might try adding a little celery. Had it with butternut squash and broccoli rabe for a great vegetarian meal!

This is by FAR the best rice I've ever eaten!  It disappeared so fast and was so easy to make.  I will definitely make this one often!!!  I used a few fresh basil leaves instead of dried, which was great, but not necessary.  This is a great way to use up leftover rice.  Just put the leftover rice in a pan with just a touch of water.  Cover and let steam to warm up.  Then add the pecan mixture and serve.  I'm pretty sure you could make this sauce ahead of time, freeze, and then add to rice later.

The flavor as written was good but a little bland to me. After adding the pan juices from the Easy Garlic Broiled Chicken recipe on this site to the rice, it was incredible! I loved the nuttiness of the toasted pecans!

This was a pretty good rice to my surprise. I will def make again. I do find rinsing the rice made it less sticky and adding a bit more seasoning really brings up the rice. The original recipe is good, just a bit bland. Double the spices.

I liked the rice and pecans, but I wasn't quite sold on the ginger, and the onion was incredibly overpowering to me. If you're someone who doesn't generally like onion, this probably isn't a recipe you'll want to try. Alternatively, don't put as much onion in or switch it out for something else.

LOVED this!! My boys even liked it, and they don't usually do brown rice. I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical mixing the pecans with the rice, but OH MY! what a terrific combo! The pecans give this a sweet, nutty flavor. The recipe is easy to follow and like previous reviewers stated, I did increase the liquid ( I used chicken broth) to 2 1/2 cups. The rice came out PERFECT. Never will I make boring plain brown rice again!!!

I loved this.  I wanted my guests to leave and give me some alone time with this rice, I liked it so much!  Instead of margarine, I used wild mushroom and sage infused olive oil.  I used leeks for my onions, dried parsley instead of fresh and skipped the ginger entirely.  I also added diced celery and mushrooms.  While boiling the rice (for probably close to 90 minutes), I added chicken bouillon cubes.  I will make this again, and probably soon!

Use chicken stock instead of water to cook the rice, and this comes out fine.  I made a double batch and froze the rest to have with another meal.

I have to admit, I didn't think this would turn out to be anything great, especially since I'm not a big brown rice person. I only made it, because I had fresh pecans that I really wanted to do something with. I was pleasantly surprised how good the ingredients complimented each other. As some others suggested, I added an extra 1/2 cup of water and vegetable bullion cube to the rice.

wonderful recipe!   very flavorful.   I increased the spices a little and didn't use black pepper.   I could also see dried cranberries going well in this dish.

This was an excellent dish.  I was trying to find a different way to make rice for my kids (2 and 4).  They thought it was "yucky" even though they barely tried it, but my husband and I loved it.  I will try it again with the kids.

We thought this was great!  It complimented the Balinese Shrimp skewers we made for dinner.  I did have to make some substitutions, but only because sadly I did not have pecans.  I used 1/4 c candied walnuts, and 1/4 c chopped walnuts.  I also took others suggestions and boiled the rice in chicken broth.  I did that because I was trying to create something that would go well with our shrimp.  It turned out great and everything was perfect!  Thank you I will be using this one again.  And I have NEVER rated anything before!

I liked the pecans in this, but felt this dish needed just a little more flavor.  As others mentioned, cooking the rice in chicken stock would definitely have helped, but I used frozen steamed brown rice to start with.  Next time I'll definitely add some garlic and use some chicken stock to give it more flavor.  Another suggestion I liked from another reviewer was to drizzle a little olive oil on it.   Still, I think this is a keeper - just needs a little flavor boost!  Thanks Deborah!

This was really really good.  The combination of the onion, rice, pecans and herbs were wonderful! I didn't add salt and  I was tempted to add craisins, but I didn't...Although I put a splash of orange juice in, because mine needed some moisture. (I cheated and used leftover brown rice from a couple of days ago, so my rice was dry when I started!)  I'm sure if I would've started with fresh rice, I wouldn't have had to add the OJ.  A very nice side dish for our Turkey medallions.  This one is in my recipe box for next time!

I make this quite often, with or without pecans.  If I do use pecans I will keep them chopped fairly large and not ground or minced as it tends to make the rice more pasty.

This was really good! I'm not a big nut fan so I chopped the pecans super fine and they just tasted like a nuttier rice when mixed in. I didn't have fresh parsley so just used a tsp of dried. Nice way to jazz up boring brown rice!

I loved this recipe!  I used butter instead of margarine and 2/3 cups rice and 1 1/3 cups water to the same amount of spices, onions and pecans.  It had a rich nutty flavor.  I will make this again.

Excellent!  Did not use the ginger (I couldn't find it!) and it was fine without it.  The nuts definitely add something.  I'll be making this again.

Everyone in my family LOVED this recipe, even the pickiest eater!  I did follow the advice to simmer the rice in chicken broth,and I added just a little extra onions and pecans.  One thing we tried just for fun was a sprinkle of shredded parmesan cheese for each serving-- it was awesome!!  We will look forward to making this again and again-- THANKS for submitting!!

I loved this recipe, it really was a nice depature from most brown rice recipes.    The only changes I made, for what was on hand was I used butter instead of margerine, and inste4ad of pecans I used finely chopped unsalted cashews.  Wow, was THIS good!  I will experiment with more nuts, maybe walnuts next time or even both.  Try this!

Very tasty.  I didn't have fresh onion on hand so substituted minced onion and I had left over brown rice from a previous meal, so I guessed about how much cooked rice to use.  I added rice directly to skillet and sauteed to warm through.

I make this a lot. It’s a great way to use leftover cooked white rice or sometimes I use VeeTee pre-made basmati rice for a quick shortcut. Just start with step 2 of the recipe and add the rice in at the end, stir-frying until it’s heated through. And voila!

I added the onion/pecan mixture to some leftover rice and it was REALLY good!  I just kind of eyeballed everything since I had an unknown amount of rice.  Hubby liked it too.  Kids not so much, but they never like anything.  Try it!  Yum!

This was very good, although I did make some changes.  I used Basmati rice and fresh basil along with the fresh parsley, butter instead of margarine and vegetable stock instead of water.  Basmati rice tends to be dry so when it was cooked, I added some more broth probably 1/2 cup as well as about 1/4 cup of half n half for creaminess,  It was delicious.  Thank you for the basic recipe.

A nice change from regular rice. I think it would be a good side dish if your having (beef, chicken, pork) that has a lot of flavor because this is mild & would compliment the main course.

Made this tonight for a company potluck.  Used chicken broth and cooked the rice in my rice cooker.  Didn't have dried or fresh basil so I left that out and used fresh ginger and minced it but otherwise followed the recipe with salt and pepper to taste.  It came out great!  I did toast my pecans in the oven as well before using in the recipe.  It should be a hit!  Thanks for a keeper recipe.

I cut everything in half and used only fresh herbs. Other than the rice (my new rice cooker wasn't so great and the rice was gummy) it was a very tasteful combination and I will make it again!

I had my doubts about adding ginger to this recipe because I really don't like it (unless it's in cookies), but I gave it a shot.  After adding extra salt, the rice was wonderful.  I still think I'll try it without the ginger next time though.

I used butter instead of yucky margarine, doubled it for a pot luck., and chopped the pecans and then roasted them.  I can't stop eating it now.  Next time I will add fresh basil as that flavor was not developed and I will add more parsley.  Even after overnight, it does take quite a bit of salt to pull the flavors out, but hopefully with more parsley and basil it will give it more flavor without the added salt.   I will make it again.

This is the best brown rice I've ever had, and hubby agrees. The only thing I did differently was use some spiced pecans that I had in the freezer, and green onions that I needed to use. It was REALLY good and I served it with the bourbon scallops from this site, with sliced tomatoes and avocado on the side. Yum! Restaurant quality. You've got to give this a try, good enough for company. Thanks so much for this recipe!!

I thought this was a wonderful way to make brown rice taste good. I was out of pecans, so I substituted walnuts. It was great.

I used ghee instead of margarine and dried parsley instead of fresh, but this was delicious and easy to make.  As a vegetarian, I am always looking for a way to make rice with added protein and this was a great way to do it.

I'm a beginner's cook and made this recipe the first time tonight for my family.  It turned out really good and everyone loved it.  The recipe is so simple to make, but it's so tasty.  I followed the advice from the other raters and used chicken broth instead of water to cook the rice (I used the unsalted kind).  I didn't have parsley, so used cilantro instead. I also used fresh grated ginger instead of ground ginger.   The next time I make it, I may cut down on the margarine or do a mixture of olive oil so it's less greasy and more healthy.  I also cut down on the salt as my family is more on the health conscious side.  The next time I make this recipe again, I will follow the exact instructions and see if there is a difference.  Otherwise, this recipe is a great find and definitely a keeper!

I find that extra butter or margarine helps bring out the nutty flavor of the pecans and keeps it moist.

An excellent recipe!  The only changes I made were adding more onions, fresh ginger, fresh basil (instead of dried parsley and dried basil) and adding dried cranberries. Thanks!

Just like everyone else has said. Really good and really easy. I actually hate cooking rice on the stove and so used my rice cooker, so much easier. I used white rice because I didn't have brown on hand and used dried parsley instead of fresh (2 tsp dry instead of 2 tbs of fresh) and we really liked it. Once there was about 5 minutes left on my rice cooker I put the butter in the skillet to melt and the timing was perfect.

Our family of picky adult eaters enjoyed this recipe.  I did use canned chicken broth instead of water, but 2 1/2 cups was a bit too much and made the rice a bit mushy. I was worried about the ginger, but it was perfect with just a hint of ginger flavor. I will definitely be making it again.

I loved, loved, loved the extra flavor in this recipe.  I used brown rice and cooked as directed, although as others suggested I cooked in chicken broth.  I prepared the rice and chopped up all my ingredients in advance.  At dinner time all I had to do was mix everything together.  Super easy and by far one of the tastiest side dishes I've tried from this site.

Excellent!  The only thing I changed was to toast the pecan pieces first, to bring out the nutty flavor.  This is a great side dish that I will definitely make again.  Impressive enough for company, easy enough to make on a weeknight.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Pecans went good with the brown rice, a very balanced flavor. We added less onion but used the seasons as directed. A little bland but good eating anyway.

Interesting flavour, would make again. I used basmati rice, which was probably a mistake - kinda mucky if you don't decrease the water and cooking time.

I used almonds in place of pecans because that's what I had.  Turned out great!

This recipe is so great--very easy to modify and adjust to what you have on hand.  I go to the store and buy a few different veggies and herbs. I have not yet made it with the pecans, but looking forward to it. I had bought some dried habanero peppers and added a pinch of that to the final dish. Simply great!

I added a sprinkle of a cinnamon & sugar blend across the top after mixing it together.  It was awesome!

REALLY tasty! I would definitely make this again. Made it for company with grilled salmon and veggies and it was a great compliment to the rest of the food. I did bake the pecans as suggested and also used chickn broth, which added a lot to the taste. Also I had scallions on hand that needed to be used up and tried those instead of onions. I think this was a milder taste which was good. I also used fresh herbs from my garden and the fresh taste was so good. I will make this recipe over and over. One last thing... I cooked the rice earlier, before my guests arrived, then added it to the rest of the ingredients and reheated the rice. Turned out great and worked out better with my schedule. Yummy and easy to make.

We followed the suggestion of several reviews & cooked our brown rice in veg. stock. (We highly recommend doing this – it adds lots of flavor to the dish.)  We added 1T of Penzy’s (salt-free) Italian Herb mix & nixed the addition of salt.  We used about ½ T fresh ginger & 1 minced garlic clove.  We also sub. olive oil as our fat. The recipe would be delicious w/o our personal taste changes (minus the stock – it’s necessary).  Will definitely make again!

This is a great recipe--lots of flavor and suits as a side dish for all sorts of meat, I didn't change a thing. Can be made ahead and just reheated in the micro. Thanks

Fantastic!  Trying to switch my family to brown rice and this recipe is helping the transition.  I only used 1T. butter, and my dish turned out great.  I, too, left out the ginger and was happy with the results.

I made this for 2 families. Used chicken broth for the water, fresh basil instead of dried, and 1/2 butter 1/2 olive oil for the margerine. Was a hit by all.

I was out of pecans so I subbed cashews, also found out I was out of ginger so I used chinese five spice. I thought it was a bit bland.  I'll try again with the chicken broth & use more amount of spices.

Adds a little variety to brown rice. I really like the ginger and nuts but  I dont think I will make it again. It just needed alot of spicing up and after all of that I still prefer just plain brown rice.

Made this side dish for a big family gathering and it was a big hit. Used 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 water as other reviews suggested. Two guests asked for the recipe.

Delicious.  I used "Success Brown Rice", which is a lot easier than regular brown rice. I also didn't have pecans, so I used walnuts instead. But like I said, "Delicious"

Very good.  Ginger adds very nice, light flavor, and pecans bring a novel texture to rice.

We found this to be extremely bland;  I can't understand all the great reviews?  At least I followed the advice of a previous reviewer, and used 2 1/2 cups of water per 1 cup of rice, which came out to the correct consistency.  But the flavor was just completely lacking.
