Made as written and these were good. Next time I'd skip the whole cooking the fish in butter and trying to flip them. They fall apart way too easy and the fish got overcooked in the end. I'll just melt the butter and pour it over the fish instead. Good recipe but you really have to like tart to like this. The combo of capers, green olives, and banana peppers brings out the pucker power for sure.

It was wonderful. I was missing a couple of things from my pantry so I used black jalapeno peppers which are not quite as hot as jalapeno peppers but have a wonderful deep flavor. I also did not have capers, but used a little white wine vinegar for the tart element. I used canned fire roasted tomatoes and blended them for the tomato puree. We also used ling cod  instead of the normal red snapper. Absolutely great flavor profile, juicy moist fish, bright sauce.
