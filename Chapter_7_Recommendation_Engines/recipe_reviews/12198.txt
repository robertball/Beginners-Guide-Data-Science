Excellent and very easy to make.  Be sure to use the NON-instant pudding though.  Very few recipes call for NON instant pudding !

This was super yummy!  I used instant pudding and it came out fine.  Don't use too much peach juice in pie and just enough to loosen cream cheese & it will come out firm but moist, like a bread pudding texture on bottom and cheese cake on top.

This is a great summer treat to make. Don't just use peaches, try other fruits as well. I have pureed the peaches before applying them. As well as using rhubarb (sweetened) and strawberries sweetened.

This was delicious and super easy!  My whole family loved it.  Next time I will add another can of peaches but that is the only thing I would change.  I used my stand mixer for the whole thing and that made clean up quick!

With only slight variations, this is a wonderful, pretty, easy to prepare dessert I’ve been making since 1983.  (I write this as I refer to my battered and stained 4x6" index card with the notation “2/83 – Very good!!”- that’s how we did things back then!) The differences, while minor, are worth noting in this old, classic recipe.  Add 1 tsp. baking flour to the flour/pudding mixture.  Use melted butter as it is easier to incorporate.  I use a 16 oz. can of sliced peaches, reserving 1/3 cup of the liquid.  I chop the peaches before sprinkling them atop the batter.  Add the 1/3 cup reserved peach liquid to the cream cheese.  Finally, I use an 8x8” square pan and in so doing I find I need to bake this a little longer (directions say 45 minutes).  Fond memories on this one.

This is absolutly awesome! I followed the recipe to the T and it turned out great! I baked it in my Pampered Chef stoneware deep dish pan. I'm thinking of trying this with fresh peaches and blueberries as they will be fresh in my area soon. Then I will use Peach Schwnaaps in place of the syrup. This is a real keeper! Thanks!

Tasty, but the "overcooked pudding" pseudo-crust is a bit weird.  I can't help but feel that this portion could be improved somehow.

Also, I think it is pointless to put packaged pudding mix in a from-scratch recipe.  What does this save me, 30 seconds of measuring out corn starch and vanilla extract?  The point of packaged mixes is the quick convenience of getting a finished product out of the box.  If you're using it as an ingredient in a from-scratch recipe, you might as well save money and just add 3 Tbsp corn starch, 1 Tbsp sugar,  1 tsp of vanilla, and 1/4 tsp of salt.  There, I just saved everyone who makes this a dollar or more.

This is identical to the Award winning peach pie on this site, minus the salt & baking powder that helps the pie bake up nicer.

after the first spoonful you just have to sit down and say wow!!!! 
I used a 10inch springform pan and baked the 'crust' for 10 minutes just while I mixed the cream mixture. It came out perfect :)

This gets 5 stars for sure. It was delicious, everyone loved it, and it was so easy to make.  I mixed the creamcheese layer in a large glass measuring cup, then warmed it in the microwave for about 20 secs.  I found it easier to top the peach layer without disturbing them.  Thanks for the keeper.

This is really yummy and sooooo easy! Guests thought it took hours to make! I love anything you can make with stuff you always have on your shelf! Next, I'm going to try it with canned pears and chocolate pudding. Actually, the possibilities are endless! Thanks, Annette!  This is a keeper!

Outstanding pie. Two small changes - do add more peaches and you must make 2 of them. The first one will be gone in a flash!

At first I didn't think this was going to be very good. I was wrong! A nice easy to make and tasty dessert but I would call it more of a pudding than a pie. I used instant pudding (instead of non-instant) and it worked fine.

Love this! So delicious, so easy to make, doesn't make a huge mess. I've used fresh or canned peaches, both turn out great! Definitely a unique pie, I will be keeping these ingredients on hand to be able to make it whenever!

Why use non- instant pudding? Do you mean the stove top pudding that you use milk and pudding comes to a boil?

***** I used fresh peaches and used Splenda with real sugar in a 3:1 combination.  Hubby liked this too!  I added some freshly ground nutmeg along with the cinnamon and sugar topping.  I followed the reviews suggestions to lmit the juice mixed in.  All turned out great!

This is a wierd dessert.  It's a combo of cake, cobbler and cheesecake. As good as that sounds, no one in our group really liked it (out of 29 people).  The cake part on the bottom had a funny taste and was thick like cobbler - not like a true crust.  The peaches were just kind of 'there' but didn't really add enough to the dessert to make it very peachy or moist.   The cheesecake layer tasted good but just sat on top of the rest of it   Not at all what I expected. Wierd.

This is one I will put in my recipe book! But there are few things that gave me trouble. Make sure your butter and cream cheese is soft and room temp or you will get lumps in the batter. Also when I was spooning the cream cheese on top it was really thick. I had to put it in the oven and let it melt for 10 min, then spread it out and add a few peach slices for decoration. I cooked it for a few extra minutes too, and it was still a little soft in the middle. Could have stayed in a little longer. Overall this pie is great, and my family loved it!

I have made this several times.  Everyone LOVES it and always asks for the recipe.  I have even made this recipe and put it into a store-bought pie crust and baked it that way for a church dinner-getting three pies out of a double batch.  Easy, GREAT dessert!

Wow! What a great simple recipe!  I needed to find a quick dessert to serve to my Bible study.  This recipe was faster than cookies and tasted great!  It disappeared quickly and the recipe was highly requested.  Thanks Annette!  I wonder if other fruit can be substitued when I don't have peaches?...hmm, time to experiment...

This was very easy to make and so delicious. I made it a third time with blueberries and it was even better than with peaches. I also used instant pudding the third time and we didn't detect any difference between the non-instant and instant. Very good recipe.

Wonderful pie! I've made it twice, following the recipe exactly, and it turned out perfectly. Might try switching in different fruits next time.

I used this in my 8 home ec kitchens for individual sized pies--6 small disposable aluminum pie plates per recipe. The type of vanilla pudding did not matter at all. I had to use some coconut flavored and it was fine too. 6 1-gallon cans of peaches made approx. 120 small pies. Baking time was the same.

I have had and used this recipe for years. It always goes over big and there are no leftovers-ever. I usually double the recipe and bake in a 9"x13"x2" glass dish. And the more cinnamon and sugar on top, the better! I even keep the cinnamon/sugar combo in a small salt shaker at all times; that's how many times I make this!

Not sure if I didn't bake this long enough but the bottom layer was very floury and stiff/tough.  My family really liked it, but I don't think I'll make it again.  Sorry.

I was skeptical when making this. My crust dough was thick and sticky, so there was no way I could pour it into the pie plate so I had to pat it in with greased fingers and just overall, I wasn't sure it would turn out to be a good combination. But, it turned out great! My husband in particular loved it, so a 5 from him and a 4 from me.

I was given this recipe about 45 years ago, I love it.  I haven't been able to find it in all my recipes.  I was so verrrrrrry happy to find it again here.  This is so very good and so easy to make.  Everyone loves it when I make it.  Now I can make it again.  Thank you.

i have been making this pie for a couple of years and it is always a huge hit with my family.  it is just as good cold as it is warm out of the oven.  i don't use canned peaches, i buy bulk peaches then blanch and freeze them.  if you do this, all you have to do is save some of the juice for the topping instead of the syrup.

We had my husbands birthday party and he loves fruit. So I decided to give this one a try. He really loved it and everyone else said the same. I thought it was really good! The cream cheese mixture and cinnamon really made the pie. I will be making this pie again for sure. Thanks for the great recipe.

This turned out amazing!  The only thing is I altered the cream cheese mix (I used brown sugar instead) and instead of using a plain pie tin, I used a pre-packaged graham cracker crust.  So good!

Great Pie!!!!  I used a 10" pyrex pie plate and it turned out wonderful.  Did the recipe exactly the way it said to, except I set aside 4 slices of the peaches as a garnish on top.  My husband wants me to make it again. After the pie cooled down, I refrigerated it.  Thank you!!!!

I made this for christmas dinner.  I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be served warm or cold so I decided to serve it room temperature and it was a huge hit.  I used peaches in light syrup and used a 10 inch pie plate (I think 8 or 9 inch would have been to small.)  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Easy and tasty!  I used fresh peaches instead & everyone loved it...a little runny after the peaches set...but still great!  Will definitely use the base pudding recipe & add other fruits and flavors!

Good dessert, but its not a knock-your-socks off. Not sure I'd sacrifice the calories for this one. HOWEVER, my hubby and adult children loved it. They said it reminded them of peach shortcake. Thank Annette.

I followed the original recipe using fresh peaches that were frozen last fall. I also added Cardamon and Cinnamon into the base batter. In the cream cheese topping I added vanilla bean paste. I did still use the syrup from canned peaches! I had a request from m girlfriends mom for something “peachy” for her birthday and everyone in the family has requested me to make this for every family function we have.. this dish was not a home run, it was a Grand Slam with a Hat Trick

Home dang run. Gee haw, this recipe leaves 'em wanting more. Very easy to make, and superb results. Two things to remember, 1) 1 package of cream cheese will spread a bit thin on the top, I used two. 2) when they say drain the peaches well....they mean it! With mine the center was a bit runny. Otherwise what a hit despite operator error,

Amazing! ive made it several times and its always a hit. I have to be careful with overbaking as it dires up if I wait for the top the be golden brown. but leaving it light and creamy just adds to the fruit and cream pie!

I baked the crust first for about 10 min. as one reviewer suggested. It was good. but next time I think I'll do as the directions suggest.

I hesitated to make this because of the vanilla pudding mix and the canned peaches.   I almost never use any processed food.  But I gave it a try with these results:
Too sweet.  Would only use 1/4 to 1/3 cup pure cane sugar. (plus add'l for the top )
I used peaches packed with pear concentrate - no added sugar.
I baked it in a 10 in. spring form pan lined with parchment.

It baked perfectly, looked great but was too sweet.  Crust was not soggy but nicely browned and if it was soft in areas, it was like pudding.  No problem.
The top does not brown so don't leave it in the oven waiting for this to happen.  I baked it about 33 minutes.

I will try fresh raspberries in the future and would love  to have some food magazine make over the crust so I would not have to use vanilla pudding mix.  I'm sure it can be done.

Will try again with other fresh fruit and reduced sugar.

I make this on regular pie crust and it is fantastic.  Try using apples - yummy.  I've also used blackberries, blueberries and huckleberries.  You can also replace the sugar with Splenda.  My favorite pie!

Easy to put together with simple ingredients. However the peaches must be very well drained or they tend to cause the cheese custard part not to set very well. I found it to be ok: my kids said the crust reminded them of a chewy, dense cobbler base but I had a hard time trying to get this pie finished in a week as it wasn't particularly impressive. Very sweet, best served chilled we found.

I made 3 of these pies for our church and each time the consistency was a bit different based on the cream cheese I used.  
I recommend chilling it for a bit if your going to be anywhere that could get warm.
Other than that, it was absolutely delicious and something different.

I followed the recipe as is and my husband and I thought it was weird.  The crust had a weird texture and didn't seem to go with the peach slices or the cream cheese topping.  What was left over after one serving was thrown away.

The taste was really good, but I had a hard time getting the crust to spread out over the pie plate, so it ended up being really thick on the bottom and absent from the sides.  I'm not sure if that's because I used instant pudding or because I should have used a little less milk, maybe 1/3 cup rather than 1/2 cup.

I ironically had fresh nectarines but not canned peaches.  To compensate, I substituted orange juice for the peach syrup in the cream cheese, which kept the nice fruity flavor.  As a warning, the acid from the juice made the cream cheese mixture lumpy at first, but that just required a bit more beating to get it smooth.

I will definitely make this again.

This was so good, it warrants my first ever review!  Loved it, loved it, loved it.  Made it to take to my sister's for dinner, everyone raved about it.  Her husband told her to throw out her peach cobbler recipes and replace them with this one.  Easy, easy, easy.  All stuff I had on hand. Super tasty!

The pie tasted really good.  My family enjoyed the flavor of the pie.  However, the pie was a little runnier than I like, and I did make it exactly like the recipe stated.  The consistency was a little disappointing.  Next time I will try to alter the recipe a bit to improve the consistency of the cream cheese topping.

I'm giving this pie 5 stars b/c I actually made it sugar-free for my mom b/c she's diabetic, and she loved it!! I didn't care for it that much only b/c I don't like sugar free stuff, but if I would have made it with real sugar I know I would have loved it! It was very easy to make, and it turned out really pretty. The cream cheese topping was a little hard to spread b/c it was so thick, but as long as you take your time and be patient it will turn out great! Like the picture, I put 4 peaches on top for a decoration to make it look nice, and with the cinnamon sprinkled on top it looked very pretty.

This was so very good! I actually can't stop thinking about it and can't wait to go home and have a slice! It was super easy to make and so fresh and light (it is a bit sweet, but I used a grahm cracker crust which added to the sweetness). This is a must try for sure :)

Easy to make and pretty much awesome. Personally I would like less of the cream cheese topping and more of the pie filling. Next time I make this I will try a different ratio but still a great pie and still gets the full 5 stars. I had a little trouble getting the topping to "cream" it was pretty thick and didnt spread well. Any tips?

Very good and refreshing. My husband is not fan of sweets but he enjoyed this one. I used 2 (15oz) cans of peaches in light syrup and 1/3 less fat cream cheese. Worked great! Thanks for rec.

Very good! I think it could have cooked for 5 minutes more as the bottom layer was just a bit soggy but it sure didn't bother my family...they loved it! I can't wait to try this w/ other fruits.

This is a great recipe.  I make it all the time when visiting.  I've also substituted strawberries for the peaches for a change.

So easy, tastes a lot like cheesecake!  It went quickly at our church dinner.  Everyone asked for the recipe!
Thanks Annette! I can see why this pie won so many awards!
