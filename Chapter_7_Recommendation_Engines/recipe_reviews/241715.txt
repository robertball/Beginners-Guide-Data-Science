These were good and I will make them again. I put mine on cookie trays lined with wax paper and put one tray in the fridge and the other in the freezer so I could eat them faster. I also let my dough sit for a few minutes in the fridge before dropping onto the trays so it wouldn't be as runny.

Super fun and easy to make - a quick delicious treat! Definitely like them better, after freezing them!  And they keep for at least one month in the freezer!

These are soooo good! They were a perfect, quick,  last minute dessert that everyone loved. It was also a safe none-oven 
treat to make the smaller members of my family!

These were really good cookies. I instead added a cup of peanut butter and three and a half cups of oats and they turned out perfect!

I love them and they firmed right up on a foil covered cookie sheet.  I may try using less sugar next time because they will make me feel less guilty about eating them and I believe they will  taste just a good.

They are ok. They came out  better than i expected.  My niece likes them, and it's a good way to get rid of the extra oatmeal we always have sitting around.

Easy. Chewy. Good. 3.5 Best kept in the fridge to keep from being "droopy".  Can see it being excellent as a breakfast on the go item with raisons added.

The recipe calls for to much butter, I would suggest cutting the amount in half. The mixture was too liquidy even after I added the oats. I made this recipe exactly as written even boiling as directed yet the cookies were too soft (fluid) and never properly set. I had to scrape them off the parchment paper with a spoon to eat. The recipe requires some adjustments but the taste was good.
