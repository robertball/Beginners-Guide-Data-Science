O-M-G, this is TO DIE FOR! I had to travel quite a ways to find a store that could prepare ground smoked ham for me but it was so worth it. I don't even like dishes like this and I thought it was good and my husband, the meatloaf fanatic, thought he had died and gone to heaven. Thanks so much!

Yummy! I used leftover deli old fashioned ham and used food processor to grind the ham.  I did not add the salt because I felt the ham was salty enough.  I also skipped out the 1/3 cup brown sugar.  The caramel topping made it sweet enough.  Almost sweet and sour.  Definately would make it again.  I also halfed the recipe and that made more then enough for two with leftovers for lunch!

I could only give this three stars; my husband liked it, but he was alone. It was a huge amount even for my family of seven...which means a lot of leftovers!  It turned out very mushy despite the ten pieces of bread and six eggs. I followed the recipe exactly as was written. I even ground my own ham. I may try this again, but I'll keep looking for the perfect ham loaf recipe.

This is the recipe my grandmother used to use.  I don't use beef in my hamloaf though, I substitute the beef with sausage - the difference in taste is quite different.  In any case, I make this recipe on occassions and have nothing left by the time dinner is over.  I always takes me back to my grandma's kitchen.

This was my first Ham Loaf, so I did pretty much stick with the recipe as is.  I cut back on milk, because 2 cups was more than enough to soak the bread.  First the good: It had very good flavor, especially the glaze on top. (I wouldn't change this at all). It also made a huge amount!  It served my family of 4 with tons of leftovers. The bad news is the texture was just not there. It was mushy.
I had to bake in loaf pans, rather than 9x13 pan, because it wouldn't take shape of a loaf.  I'll keep the glaze recipe, but keep looking for the actual loaf recipe. Thanks anyway.

This was absolutely delicious.  I cooked it exactly according to the recipe. We had a lot of ham leftover from Christmas and it was a great way to use it. We found that the flavours improved over several days. We enjoyed it bot hot and cold on sandwiches.  my husband is already saying he wants me to make it again.

This is my husband's #1 favorite dinner. After making it many times as written, one day I had a pound of ground turkey that needed to get used, so I used it in place of the beef. Everyone liked it better! That got me thinking, so next time I used a pound of ground pork in place of the beef. Bingo! It was the best yet, so that's how I always make it now. I also add a 1/4 tsp of garlic powder & 1/4 tsp of onion powder (or minced onion.) Those are the only changes.

I have been searching and searching for a recipe that emulated what my grandmother used to make.  I finally found it. I will use this recipe over and over again and recommend others to do so as well.

This was almost inedible.  The topping was good, but the rest was just awful.
