I was looking around for something to use my black-eyed peas in and came across this.  It came out really nicely, and quite tasty indeed!  I did end up replacing a few things based on what I had on hand.  Lacking bacon, I browned up a couple of spicy beef sausages (diced) and a bit of ground beef to make it a little more dynamic.  I also added in some diced green pepper and went with white instead of brown on the rice (a preference thing).  I used dry peas that I soaked and cooked beforehand and skipped on the tomato, and only used the cheese as a topping (which ended up getting mixed in anyway).  It struck me as a sort of a down-home Southern style jambalaya.  It's definitely going on the menu again!

I made this tonight for the first time, as written, though substituting tomatoes with jalapenos because we did not have hot sauce. Overall, it is a good, filling dish, even the kids liked it. The one thing that my husband and I agreed on is that the black eyed peas would be better replaced with chili beans or something with a bit more personality.

This was a great recipe that was quick and easy to make.  I added 2 cubed chicken breasts when I cooked the bacon and onions.  I would crisp up the bacon first the next time before adding the onions and chicken since the bacon was fatty and soft.  My kids ages 5-13 gobbled it up and asked for thirds!  Success!

Honestly, this is the best recipe I've ever made that included black eyed peas or brown rice.  It's definitely a keeper!  I didn't have any instant brown rice, so I used regular brown rice instead.  We live at high altitude, so I planned a longer cook time, and actually ended up letting it simmer on very low heat for a good hour and a half (I added liquid a few times when it started sticking)...I added the tomatoes and black eyed peas after the rice was cooked and then the whole mixture continued to cook for probably half an hour.  I added the cheese (used marble jack & cheddar) at the very end after turning off the heat, as directed.  Anyway, it turned out with a wonderfully creamy texture and delicious flavor.  Will definitely make this again.

Added shredded chicken to this, and made the rice into Spanish rice. It was still super good!

I used ingredients I had on hand, so there was quite a variation: thick-cut bacon (drained of grease), boil-in-bag white rice (removed from bag and cooked as described), 2 cans of black eye peas, and a can of Huntâ€™s diced tomatoes with onion (drained). It turned out surprisingly well.

I made this for New Year's day and it was terrific.  Even my grandson ate it and loved it and he is picky.
