Have not had Rabbit for many years, found a local breeder and he sold me one.
Cut the sugar in half and next time will cut the black pepper in half.
We will be eating more rabbit.

My family really enjoyed this!  I was a bit apprehensive at first becoase of the sugar, but I only used 1/2 of the amount asked for, and a little less of the ketchup as well.  It almost tasted like bbq sauce, I did everything else the same as it asked for in the recipe, very easy, the rabbit by the end is nicely roasted and crispy!!  It was delicious, I served it with rice.  Will make again.

Flavor of the sauce was great. The cook time needs some adjusting yet as the smaller cuts were over-cooked.

I was looking for a slow roasted method for cooking rabbit, not a simmering / basting method.  The title is misleading.

Its recipes like these that make me think...where did I go wrong? I'm sorry, I've never given anyone a two star rating before, I actually feel bad about this, but fair is fair. I followed the recipe to the T, and ended up having to cook the rabbit longer..in fact I cooked him till I burned him. Perhaps this way my fault, but that is the first time I threw away dinner. Will definitely not be making this again. :(

I deboned the rabbit into small bite size pcs first.  Everybody loved it!  They thought it was pork ribblets. They were surprised when I told them it was rabbit and they asked for the recipe! The only thing was maybe cut back on the paprika?  My wife thinks half.

This is an old recipe ive used it for years, but instead of an onion i add the dry onion soup mix, adds a lot more flavor, added a little broth too.

This is now my favorite rabbit recipe! We raise our own, so I've tried many. I was afraid I had browned it a bit long, so I cut the bake time by 20 minutes.  It was SO tender! I will, however, cut back on the pepper next time to 1/2 tablespoon.

Made this with my very first home butchered rabbit.  It was a hit with the whole family.  I followed the recipe as is except added pineapple to lighten it up for the season.  So, so good.

Definitely will make this again. I had become bored with ordinary rabbit casserole. This was easy to make and extremely tasty. To the reviewer who burnt the rabbit, I can only assume you forgot to add the 3/4 cup of water, which is something that I nearly did too.

Flavor was fantastic! I do suggest allowing the rabbit to marinate in the sauce for 4 - 6 hrs ahead of roasting. 

If this is your first time trying rabbit, I want to let you know that the front legs and the back piece, have the most tender meat. : ) Enjoy!!!

Didn't make any changes. Found it to be very tasty.  Family asked me to make it again.  Will definitely be eating more rabbit.  Smaller pieces seem to be a little to done.  Will check after 1 hour next time.

I was searching for a roasted rabbit recipe and found this...this is misleading...you can save yourself some BTUs using the range by simmering on top of the stove...I use chipotle sauce which gives the dish a nice smokey sweet flavor.  I simmer until tender.

SO I did not try this recipe..mine is better...no sugar/ketchup.

I did make a few additions to the recipe listed. I added bite-sized potatoes (sunburst blend).  Also, while I was Browning the rabbit before baking it, I sauteed fresh white mushrooms and asparagus sticks.  I laid the mushrooms at the bottom before placing the rabbit in the baking dish and laid the asparagus over top.  This is a recipe I will definitely try again!  Wonderful dish! Thank you for the ideas.

I made my own ketchup and I used amino acids instead of Westchester sauce.  I put oregano, thyme, parsley, Sage, cilantro, and Rosemary.

Made an excellent meal.  I brined the rabbit for about 14 hours before, and substituted soy sauce for Worcestershire sauce.  We cooked two wild rabbits, and it was delicious - my family really enjoyed it.  The rabbit was tender and tasty.

I thought the baking time was too long, so I pulled it out after 60 minutes - it was still way overdone.  I'll try it again, but much shorter cooking time!

Good recipe.
I used an InstantPot and cooked a whole rabbit in 45 mins. Then roasted in the oven for 20 mins.
3 of 4 at our table never had rabbit before and all enjoyed this recipe.

We loved this recipe. It was my first time cooking rabbit, and it was tasty and tender. Even the kids loved it, and asked for more! After reading the other reviews, I reduced the baking time from 90 minutes to 60, and it was fully cooked.

Thus recipe is very good. The rabbit was very tender. the sauce was also good, we added some honey which was a nice touch.

I made this as a dish for Christmas dinner and there wasn't a scrap left. It got great reviews from those who'd had rabbit before and those who hadn't. I'll look forward to making it again.

Followed directions exactly. It was ok. Won't make it again.
