I didn't add the espresso coffee and used chocolate marshmallow ice cream! Added some whipped cream on top too! Was delicious!! Will use again and again!

I'm pretty disappointed in this recipe. I wanted a coffee-flavored drink, and this just tasted like blended up chocolate ice cream. Which is good, but it's not what I thought it was going to be. I even added twice the amount of coffee it called for, and I didn't taste any coffee at all! Good for a chocolate milkshake, just not for a coffee drink.

Mmm, yum. I put more coffee than it called for, and would probably put even more next time I make it. Not that anything was wrong with it - it is delish!! My husband used to be a Starbucks barista, and he said it tastes just like Starbucks' mocha frap. ;)

I got about half way thru and definitely had a buzz. I used a no sugar added (Splenda) chocolate ice cream cuz that is all I had. Didn't measure, just used 2 scoops, and more ice, 2 cups of half moon cubes. Topped with chocolate covered coffee beans.

A little too watered down for me. Not enough espresso and it wasn't very thick. Next time I make this, I'll double the espresso and cut back on the milk. Maybe add just a little more ice cream. I used Turkey Hill ice cream in this recipe.

I made this recipe for the *RECIPE GROUP* over on the buzz. After reading all the other reviews on this recipe, I decided to change things up a little. I added about 1 1/2 - 2 Tbs. of coffee granules in place of the espresso, and didn't use the chocolate syrup (hate that stuff!). I thought it was very good! :) thanks!

I made this for Recipe Group this week and I agree with some previous reviewers.  This was more like chocolate milk than a milkshake.  Way too thin, even though I used only three ice cubes and half the milk.  I used some really strong espresso powder I had on hand, but the flavor still didn’t come through, and I didn’t have instant hot chocolate mix so I left that out.  Even though this wasn’t thick, Hubs had no problem polishing it off.

Recipe group selection of 7/2/11.  I used skim milk and low fat ice cream because that is what I had.  To my taste the espresso gets lost in the chocolate and we all thought it was too sweet.  Thanks for something new to try Latifa.

I made this for recipe group 07/02/2011. I thought it tasted okay, but nothing special over any other chocolate mixed drink I have made on here. I am glad that AR does not list the sugar grams because I can just imagine. I luckily had some sugar free and lite ingredients. The only ingredient I didn't have was chocolate ice cream but I had vanilla with lots of chocolate flakes. I figured it was chocolaty enough between the cocoa powder and syrup anyway. I prefer a more thicker drink, and one thickened by ice or fruit, even for a milkshake with the variety I have tried on here. It was just way too thin for a milkshake and it kind of just tasted like melted chocolate ice cream with cocoa powder and syrup, pretty much what it is. I also couldn't understand the reason for the coffee as it couldn't be tasted at all? I think it belongs more in a mocha milkshake. Not bad, but too much sugar/calories for a glass of slightly thick icy chocolate milk.
