I made a double batch because I wanted more fruit.  I like that oats instead of flour are mixed in the fruit to absorb moisture.  I added 1 Tbs of fresh mint, because I have it in the garden, and it added a great zip of flavor!  I also added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.
I used a different crisp topping than this recipe outlined, because I wanted something with more oats and less flour.  3/4 C oats, 1/2 C flour, 1/2 melted butter (just because it is easier), 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/4 tsp cinnamon.  I will absolutely make this again.  Baked in 8 x 8 pan.

I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan and added 10 minutes to the baking time. I used saskatoons (service berries) instead of blueberries because that's what I had. It wasn't quite as crispy on the top as I would have preferred. I probably could have baked it longer. Since the recipe doesn't state an actual pan size, I guessed when sizing up, so then I wasn't sure how long to bake it. It was a little thin in the pan. Maybe less butter poured over would have helped it to crisp? Flavour balance was good. I liked that it didn't have ridiculous amounts of sugar unlike similar recipes.

This was delicious but it had no volume!   It came out so flat in the pan.  Please, for anyone who is trying this dish, at least double the recipe.

Such a delicious twist on always seeing rhubarb with strawberries. I added 2 cups of blueberries and also doubled the topping as I love lots of crumble. My husband took it to work for a pot luck and had rave reviews. Good thing he brought me a little bit home so I could try it as well. I will for sure make this again.

Wonderful recipe! The family loved it!  I quadrupled the recipe, and it fit my glass 9x13 pan perfectly. There was a lot of juice in the bottom of the pan, so I'll probably put half of the crumble mixture under the blueberries and rhubarb next time.
