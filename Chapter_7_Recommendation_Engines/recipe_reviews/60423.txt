These bars are very very good. Moist and flavorful. We love coconut and walnuts, so I increased each by 1/2 cup. For an extra sweet treat, frost with cream cheese icing. These freeze well, too. Thanks Juanita!

These bars were fairly simple to make and the ingredients were on hand. They were pretty good, however I thought the crust was a little bit too salty. If you use unsalted butter, then adding the salt is probably a good idea, but if you are using salted butter, don't add very much salt. It doesn't need it. I will probably make this again, but I think I will continue my search for the ultimate coconut bar cookie.

I find these overly sweet and soft.  The best part of them for me was the walnuts.  I will not make them again.

My grandmother raised me and told me when I was 6 yrs old that if I could read I could cook.  This was one of the first cookies that she had me bake.  She substituted pecans for the walnuts.  She had to print the recipe for me because I could not read cursive.  Still have the recipe card, it is 60 yrs old.

These bars were magnificent! I used Nutiva red palm oil / coconut oil shortening and the crust simply melted in your mouth. Absolutely phenomenal. I also used unsweetened shredded coconut and the overall taste was sweet but certainly not overly so. I gave a bunch out to my neighbors and the response was incredible. Definitely a keeper!

Turned out great. My hubby doesn't like nuts so I substituted dark chocolate chips for the nuts.

This recipe similar to the recipe my mother made and was a personal favorite. We called them chews. The main difference was her recipe did not have salt or walnuts.

These cookie bars brought back such great memories. As a child in the 60's we went to Nanny's house in Halifax and these were the buffet drawer favorite. Captured the memory exactly! Thank you!

Yum!  I halved the recipe and baked in a 9x9 inch brownie pan, so I cut each baking time by 5 minutes.  For my fiancee's benefit, I replaced the walnuts with 1/2 cup chocolate chips and I also added 1/4 cup rolled oats.  I chose this recipe because the name was interesting and because I prefer classic recipes, but I'm glad they turned out well.  ;p  Going into the recipe book for sure.
