I really like nutritional yeast as a coating for frying. This is a very nice recipe. I ate the tofu slices as is, just with a side of veggies but I think I will definitely use this on a sandwich or in a Buddha bowl. The only issue I had was to get the yeast to stick. It stuck to my fingers more than the tofu at one point. So, next time, I will use the plastic bag method to help get the coating evenly over the tofu. Thank you for the recipe.
