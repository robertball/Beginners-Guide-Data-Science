I use bread crumbs instead if saltines and use 1/2 sausage and 1/2 ground round. It was excellent the night of and as a left over. The best meat loaf I have ever had

This is a good basic meatloaf recipe if you don't know what you have never made meatloaf before.  I however found it a little bland.  My husband who likes his meatloaf plain enjoyed it.  The only changes I made were to halve the recipe and add a little garlic.  I served with mashed potatoes.

I changed a few things, only because of what I had on hand.  I used about 1/2 cup of dry, minced onions, and Italian bread crumbs, and added garlic like someone else suggested.  Then, I had ran out of Reynolds wrap, (imagine that) so I put the mealoaf in a pan, and it still turned out really good.  All in all, I really liked the taste, although the glaze was a bit too sweet, for me.

Very good recipe, it is certainly a keeper. Instead of saltine crackers i used dried bread crumbs. I also added 2tbsp of garlic powder to the ground beef. Thanks for the recipe

When I made this recipe my father was watching me and I saw his face and he was getting quite nervous about eating this.  But it did turn out quite well.  I might try a different glaze but the meatloaf it self was quite yummy.

My family really liked this one.  I was just a tiny bit confused with the glaze because I used all the mustard in the meat mixture but it was still a hit.  Thanks for the recipe :)

Very tasty! I substituted Ritz crackers for saltines (b/c that's all I had!) and it was great. I placed the loafs right on a wire rack with a drip pan so that some grease would drip off and it did pretty well. The leaner the meat, the better though. Thanks Pam!

This was really good! My boyfriend and I both liked it a lot. I did make 2 changes- I only had one egg, and I used tomato juice instead of the milk. It still came out good. I think next time, I'll keep the tomato juice, and use less salt.
I liked the glaze a lot too- I don't like supersweet glaze, and this one had just the right amount of sweetness.
Very yummy- this will be a "usual" in our home :) Thanks
