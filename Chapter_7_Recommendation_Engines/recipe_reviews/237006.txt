Made for Friday meal during Lent and paired it with the black bean cheesy quesadillas, it was a hit.  both were a hit with the family. I made as is, but would highly recommend adding the srichicha sauce in small amounts and tasting, this was very spicy. We loved it, but too spicy for kiddos. Next time I will use less.

Tried out this recipe for dinner tonight. I didn't have limes so I used lemons. I also didn't have red pepper flakes. My husband and I thought it was delicious! Will definitely make this again.

Really tasty. Loved the sauce although I was hesitant at first, that part really made the tacos yummy.

Made this recipe and it was wonderful! I added some minced garlic with my spices when mixing the shrimp, and then a splash of heavy cream to my sauce after cooking the shrimp. It mellowed out the lime juice and coated the shrimp just perfectly. Also, I added some romaine lettuce and avocados to my tacos and it was wonderful. A great recipe all around, especially the ranch/siracha sauce!

I tweaked this slightly and really liked the way it turned out. I have the shrimp marinade a good dash of Old Bay and some minced garlic, then let it soak in all the flavor in the refrigerator for a couple hours. For serving I included some shredded cabbage. Would gladly make this again.

I made this for my wife and I for a Mother's Day dinner and we both really enjoyed it. The sweetness of the mango with the spicy Sriracha really complimented each other. My wife said that we should have these every Mothers Day.

The idea of this was appealing, and the shrimp, fruit, and cilantro were fresh and tasty on their own, but their combination was kind of underwhelming. In comparison, the Sriracha sauce was fine but overpowered the more delicate main ingredients. Not a keeper.

Made the first with Mission corn tortillas on a griddle added the shrimp, mango salsa with a few cherry tomatoes diced in as well. Second flour tortilla warmed on griddle with salsa and sauce. OMG it was to die for!  Went so nicely with a cold brewski at the end of my work week. 2 thumbs zup!

Instead of the Mission tortillas, I used LaTortilla Factory all natural 50% corn 50% flour tortillas. Also, instead of ranch dressing I used an even mix of nonfat plain yogurt and sour cream. I like my food a bit spicier, so I used about 4 or 5 tbsp of Siracha sauce. Other than that, I pretty much followed the recipe, and the tacos turned out great!

This recipe is excellent!... The sauce has the perfect zip to it, and the mango gives it some good tang!  It's also easy to whip together.   I added some chopped red peppers and some slices of avocado because I had them handy.   Thanks for sharing this delicious  recipe!

This was delicious! I left out the onions, just because I'm not a big fan, but it was still great. Took the advice from another reviewer and added the sirracha a little bit at a time and made it took a good, spicy level. Will definitely make again.

Super easy and fast.  I added red bell peppers and lime juice to the onions and mango to  make a salsa.  Good marinade for the shrimp
