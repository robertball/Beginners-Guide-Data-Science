It was great.  Nice flavor, unlike others they Iâ€™ve tried they were tasteless.  More of a thin crust style.  Delicious

The hubby didn't mind it but I thought it was terrible. I ate some, but in the end I ended up peeling the toppings off and eating them alone. I don't know if its the beer the pepper or what, but I won't be making this one again. Oh and no where near cheesy enough.

This is a crust that is definitely not for hefty pizzas with lots of toppings--while it worked with D's Taco Pizza, a thicker crust would've been lots better--so I suggest you try it with basic toppings like cheese and pepperoni.  I paid attention to Christina's review and cut down on the pepper and added more cheese, but the crust is rather different than a regular dough crust.  Perhaps due to the ratio of beer to flour (I was surprised at the low amount of flour actually), this ends up to be a rather flat, much less doughy crust than I prefer.  The texture almost reminds me of a flat cornbread, and that's not really a hit for me, so I'll keep looking.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was ok, but, unfortunately, the rest of the family did not care for this at all. IMO, there was too much pepper and not enough cheese to be called a 'cheesy pizza crust'. A more appropriate name would've been spicy or peppery pizza crust b/c the pepper really over-powered the rest of the ingredients. This smelled great, but just didn't hit the flavor mark for us...Thanks for sharing.
