One simple change takes this from a 4 to a 5 star recipe.  First time I made this exactly as written (with the exception of my own sauce as everyone has their own favorite).  It was very good but something seemed to be missing.  My second time making this was perfection.  Follow recipe exactly but assemble it with half of the sauce directly on top of the noodles and the remaining half over the ricotta layer.  This incorporates the ingredients together and improved the taste incredibly.

I cooked this dish for myself and my husband and we both really enjoyed it. I did not line my pan with aluminum foil, but I did cover the pan with foil as it called for. It did not seem to matter that the pan wasn't lined. Also, I did add garlic, onion and pepper to the meat when I browned it. I will definitely cook this again!

This was so good! The only thing I did different was to add a half of cup of the sauce mixture to the bottom of the pan, before I put the spaghetti in.

This recipe is wonderful!!! I make it whenever my husband and I have dinner parties and I always get great compliments on it. The ricotta definitely makes a big difference. I did change the recipe a bit though. I used nonstick cooking spray instead of lining the pan and it came out just fine. Also, I used a combination of ground beef and italian sausage. I also used Classico sauce instead of Prego because I prefer its flavor a lot more.

This was just fabulous! My family ate like half the pan in no time. This was off the hook! My spaghetti wasn't even cooked right at all, and I'm telling you, this was just awesome!!! My 2 year old ate like a champ that night, it's a must try! You'll love it.

We all thought this was very good.  I realized I didn't have enough mozzarella so I substituted some sharp cheddar for a portion of the mozzarella and was very pleased with the results.

Very good and very easy!  I will probably make this instead of lasagna from now on, as it has the same taste and is easier. I sprayed the bottom of the pan with non-stick spray instead of lining it with foil, and it worked just fine! I have also made this with macaroni or other pasta instead of spaghetti.

This recipe tops our list. It was easy to prepare and tasted wonderful. I did add two large garlic cloves to the meat sauce, however, us Sicilians like our garlic. We fixed a large dish and it was finished off to the last spoon full.

I made this for two reasons. 1) I got some serious couponing done this morning and cleaned up on spaghetti sauce and 2) I'm trying to get my younger child to eat more food and this was easy enough for him to help cook. I used jarred sauce but I gussied it up with extra spices, fresh onion and garlic and a glug of red wine. I used only a little fresh parmesan on the top and lowfat cottage cheese/mozzerella. So it wouldn't be too dried out--what I did was eliminated the butter and in a big bowl, I mixed up the spaghetti, sauce, cottage cheese and half the shredded cheese, and before putting it in the oven,  I sprinkled it with the remaining cheese and a little fresh parmesan. Really freaking yummy. This made a huge 9x13 pan full but only a little remains. I'm glad I mixed it all together because I think it would have either been too greasy or too dry had I not. It was just right. This will make excellent spaghetti/garlic bread sandwiches tomorrow. The family all told me this is a keeper! (And, if you're wondering, the little guy loved it, too!) Next time, I might try to sneak more veggies in and cut back on the pasta. This is so cost-effective for feeding large families (or three very hungry boys).

This was excellent!  Even better with spicy Italian sausage instead of ground beef.

Super easy and the kids loved it - I doubled the recipe but used two casserole dishes and this was good to reheat later in the week for lunch or a fend for yourself night.

I made this last night for my sister and I. Definitly way more food than two people can eat but it was very tasty! I did not use tinfoil on the bottom but put down a layer of sauce. I would use two jars of sauce, one will just not cut it. I also used mild itailan sausage which I think gives it more flavor. I also diced a small onion and a few cloves of garlic and added that to the sausage. I also think that a larger container of riccotta cheese would have been better. I topped the last cheese layer with some dried basil just for looks. It look great! We are eating this for breakfast lunch and dinner today!

It's Great! BUT my husband & I are on Weight Watcher's. (this recipe is 17 points per serving!) So here's what I did to make it only 8 points per serving: whole grain spaghetti, canola non-stick cooking spray instead of butter, half the grated parm. cheese, fat free cottage cheese, lean ground turkey, Hunts original style MUSHROOMS sauce (it's better for you), and 2% milk shredded mozz. cheese.  Follow the Baked Spaghetti recipe, using half the parm. cheese each time.  Instead of eating 1/6 of the pan, eat 1/8 of the pan.  (1/6 of the pan ends up still only 11 points compared to 17!) It's delicious & not terrible for you! Enjoy! God Bless!

This was very good.  I changed a few things, added garlic powder to my meat while cooking, put down a layer of noodles first.  My ricotta, i mixed with eggs and added some salt & pepper then smeared a layer over the noodles.  Then added sauce, meat & cheeses, continued to layer it this way.  Topped with remaining mozz.  Pretty much tasted just like lasagna, but i think i may like this better!

My family loved this.  I did make a few changes.  When browning the ground beef, I added green and red peppers and onions and seasoned it with Adobo, onion powder, and garlic powder.  I used Ragu Chunky Gardenstyle Tomato,Garlic, and Onion Sauce (personal preference).  When layering spaghetti, I also added the mozzarella.  I didn't use the foil.  Just put some sauce in the bottom of the pan and it was fine.  Believe it or not, I doubled the recipe, using 2lbs of spaghetti, etc. (large family).  It made a ton!  I had enough to make a pan for my sister's family and her kids loved it.  They are all requesting that I make it again soon.  This will be a staple in our house.

This was absolutely delicious.  It was a hit here.  The only thing I changed was mixing the spaghetti with the ricotta instead of layering it.  I feared the spaghetti would become dry if simply layered as the recipe called for.  I also used my own homemade marinara in place of the jarred sauce.  All in all, a incredibly tasty meal that I will be making again.

I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef and in addition to Prego I used 2 cans of tomatoes.  I cooked the meat, added the tomatoes and sauce with the ricotta and three cheese shreds.  (It was all I had in the fridge.)  I love Italian food and just decided to throw it in the oven.  Really liked it.  I'd never thought to put ricotta in spaghetti.  I also used Barilla whole wheat spaghetti.  Family liked it.  Will try again.

Very, very good and very, very easy.  Used my own meat sauce, and because I was making it for a large crowd, used 1-1/2 pounds spaghetti and 3 pounds of ricotta.  Perfecto!!  I did mix the spaghetti with sauce rather than butter before putting it in my throw-away aluminum pan (used a pretty large one).  It was a big hit, and what little leftovers we had were great heated up the next day.  My Italian family loved it.

I used half the ricotta, and it was still waaay too overpowering with Ricotta.  Definitely won't be making that again.  It needed salt too.

My family enjoyed this recipe very much. I made as the recipe called using cottage cheese and my family's preferred store bought spaghetti sauce. However, I layered the ingredients to make two tiers.  I placed a layer of sauce, 1/2 of the spaghetti, 1/2 of the cottage cheese, parmesan cheese, sauce, remaining spaghetti, remaining cottage cheese, parmesan cheese, topping with the remaining sauce and mozzarella cheese.

Made exactly as written and it was great!  Served a crowd and still had leftovers the next day.  I would recommend just skipping the ricotta/cottage cheese and using mozzarella and Parmesan instead.  It makes it easier, and still tastes great.  I will make it again!

Love it (wanted to give 4.5 stars). Needed a bit more cheese for my taste but quick, easy & affordable.  For lower carb version, try with Dreamfields pasta, same taste less carbs.

Made a double batch of this for a dinner party with some friends. Four BIG guys dug into huge plates and everyone complimented me on the outcome! Lining the pan with foil helped cleanup tremendously. My only changes were to add a pound of (cooked, crumbled) ground turkey, and to mix an egg into the carton of ricotta cheese before adding to the dish. I agree with other reviews about mixing at least some of the sauce into the noodles first to help bring everything together into one cohesive unit. Fantastic recipe and will make again and again (always in a double batch - hardly any extra work and you can freeze the leftovers, if any!)

My daughter gave me this same recipe, except hers calls for FF cottage cheese and just 1 cup mozzarrella.  It's delicious and very kid friendly as well.  I've also successfully subbed ground turkey for the ground beef.

My whole family really liked this - nice change from plain spaghetti.  I typically don't use a lot of salt in my cooking but I will definitely use a little next time - otherwise delicious!

Love it. Used my own sauce [ doubled the recipe equal to 2 28oz jars] to which I also added a  drained pkg of frozen spinach. browned up 1 lb italian sausage.Made 2 8x8 pans 1 for me and 1 for friend. Put 1 ladle of sauce in bottom of pan.  When [broken] pasta was done I added 1 ladle of sauce to it so it wouldn't be dry. put pasta in pan-then sauce-sausage over top-more sauce- ricotta mixed with cottage cheese and parsley-more sauce-topped with mozzarella & parmesan. Baked recommended time. Delish  Also loosely cover with foil so cheese doesn't stick. It's a keeper. Don't hold back on the sauce. Sliced up like Lasagna

Well, YUMMERS!!  This was by far the best baked spaghetti recipe I have ever tried.  Of course, I did a little doctoring...not crazy about canned pasta sauce, so I made my own sauce with a packet of McCormick Spaghetti seasoning and added a can of crushed tomatoes to that, along with an onion and 1 lb of browned hamburger.  I also added 3 tbsp of dried parsley flakes and 1 tsp of garlic salt to the ricotta before smoothing it on top.  Used fresh grated romano instead of parmesan...that's all I had...and just sliced the very soft mozzerella cheese you can buy in those water tubs and scattered it over the top like pepperoni!!  VERY flavorful and VERY filling!!  The only thing I will do differently next time is skip the tin foil.  (Wish I'd have read the other reviews, first!)  That made kind of a mess when cutting.  Other than that, adding this recipe to my 'keeper' file was a no-brainer!!  EXCELLENT!!

My entire family loved this recipe!  Not one picky comment out of the whole bunch of us.  (That's 7 people, folks!)  I highly recommend this blend of pasta and cheeses!  I left out the meat, used less sauce, and it was perfect.

We loved this oh-so-flexible recipe!  I used a whole pound of spaghetti, but only had about 15 ounces of ricotta.  I left out the ground beef but it would be good with any vegetables added.  It still turned out wonderful!  On top of that, it went together in no time at all!  Will be using this again when I am in need of a good meal - fast!

Delicious & easy. Even better, clean up is a snap!  I followed the recipe ...did add onion while frying the hamburger...and I think next time I will add more sauce as others have wrote.  Otherwise, I will make again.

Sorry, not the best, I agree with another review that said if you are going to go to all this trouble , you might as well make a lasagna.  It really just tasted like spaghetti with cheese on top, I could of made that in 20 minutes and not 1 1/2 hours.

I have been making the same wonderful spaghetti recipe for the past 10 years but wanted to try something a little different.  I just made this recipe for dinner last night and my family really enjoyed it!    Another reviewer commented that her noodles were dry which I don't understand dry because mine was very moist.  I think she just didn't use enough sauce.  I mistakenly only bought one jar of the 10 oz. sauce then re-read the recipe only to find out that it asked for a 25.75 oz jar.  Oops!  Sent hubby back to buy another jar.  I used 20 ounces and it was enough.  I also only had 12 oz of ricotta cheese and I think it was still tasty.    Also, I used regular aluminum because I didn't want to pay $7 for a box of non-stick.  It worked just fine with some Pam cooking spray I already had.    All in all we loved this recipe and can't wait to have the left overs!  YUM!

Husband LOVED this and is making me make this for his company potluck. I made the following changes:  -I also did not line with foil. I used a glass pyrex pan and sprayed with Pam.  -My spagehetti package was about 17 ounces so since it was more than double I used a lot more sauce, I used two Classico big jars (each at 32 ounces) so total of 64 ounces of sauce.  -I couldn't find a carton of ricotta cheese, so I found a 17 ounce cup of ricotta cheese in the dairy section of Walmart and that was plenty -To make sure it didn't get dry like some of the reviews stated, I layered the bottom of the pan with the sauce, then put the coated noodles in, then added the remaining half of the sause, then sprinkled some more parmesan cheese (we like cheese), then put the ricotta cheese layer, then the remaining sause, then the mozzarella cheese and the remaining Parmesan cheese

Okay, to me this nothing more than a glorified "baked ziti".  It was okay, but seemed to lack taste.  I would not make it again.

This is fabulous!  Used small curd cottage cheese, not the full 24 oz. (approx. 18 oz).  Sprayed pan w/ non-stick spray instead of foil lining.  Worked great.  Definitely a keeper!!

used the butter, helps to keep the pasta separated. Used sauce on the bottom of the lightly oiled pan to keep the pasta from sticking. When I removed the foil to cook for the last 10 min I noticed that the corners were starting to get over cooked, so I switched to Low Broil for 5min. The kids loved it. Thank you!!

I made it with Classico Four Cheese sauce and left out the extra onion, garlic and peppers as I am trying to coax a picky 8 year old and 17 month old to eat with us. Success! I used non stick spray in the pan instead of foil (have you seen what they are charging these days?!) and had zero problems with sticking. There was plenty of sauce and lots of leftovers. Next time I will make two 9x9 pans for our family of four and will put one in the freezer for a crazy, no time to cook kind of day. This one is a keeper and will put it into our rotation.

My family is not a "pasta" kind of group while I love it.  So I tried this one....NO LEFT OVERS!  Funa and easy to make!  I broke my spaghetti into thirds when I put it on to boil and that worked perfectly!  This will be a staple in my recipe collection forever!

I've made this dish several times and always receive accolades.  To "spice" it up a bit I also add 1 lb. of ground sausage (sweet, Italian).  It's a great leftover dish as well.

Wonderful! I needed a good basic recipe to use. We dont do meat but i roasted colored peppers, roots veggies, onions, tomatoes, then used cottage cheese blended with oregano from my garden, freshly shaved chunks of parmesean and think slices of mozerella on top rather than shredded. Wow, served with a caprese salad, i couldnt have gotten better if we had eaten out! Delish.

This is a good way to get the kids to eat spaghetti when they feel like they're tired of it. I used this with 'leftover' noodles... I'm not sure about the addition of ricotta/cottage cheese because I couldn't bring myself to put it in there. It just doesn't sound good to me.

I only gave this three stars because although it's relatively simple to make and doesn't take a lot of time, I feel it's lacking in flavor.  I made it with the cottage cheese suggestion, so maybe that made a difference?  My family wasn't very enthusiastic about it and no one went back for seconds, though they did eat it.  If I try making this again, I'll throw in some spices and use ricotta.

Very good - wish that I had non-stick foil, but c'est la vie. I ended up just baking it in the pan. I made a few modifications to the recipe: I used Boca crumbles instead of ground beef, I nixed the ricotta cheese (not a huge fan), and I added lightly sauteed eggplant and onions to the ground beef/sauce mix, which ended up being an excellent decision. Some of it stuck to the bottom (as I knew it would), but it was still utterly delicious. As someone else mentioned, though, I think it would be much improved if there was a layer of sauce directly on the pasta. The pasta became a bit dry without the sauce directly on top.

Overall, though, I would definitely make this recipe again!

This was very good! The only minor changes I made was no aluminum foil lining and I layered sauce over the spaghetti and another layer over the ricotta cheese. I also cut down the parmesan cheese. My husband and I really enjoyed it!

Sorry....I found this dish mediocre at best, but it could probably be saved.  It was very bland, and when you cut through it to serve, it was just a heaping of dry spaghetti with sauce and cheeses layered on top - nothing different than serving up regular spaghetti.  The layering of the items didn't allow the sauce and cheeses to seep down to the spaghetti, so I ended up with a large helping of plain spaghetti on the bottom.  I wouldn't make it again.  However, it could probably be improved by mixing the spaghetti and sauce and ricotta before layering.  Then I'd replace bland ground beef with crumbled sausage.  I'll try that next time.

I actually enjoyed this receipe.  I was very suprised how big of a difference the ricotta made.  I am not sure what was the purpose of "baking" the spaghetti? If you mix all the ingredients while they are still hot, I think it will turn out the same.

I made this tonight and it was really good and easy. My husband said it was excellent and ate 2 huge helpings. He didn't even know I used Morning Star Crumblers instead of hamburger. I didn't line the pan with foil but I did put a thin layer of spaghetti sauce on the bottom instead like one reviewer did. One reviewer said she did that.  I will absolutely make it again!

I used 24 oz. Spaghetti, 2 jars Classico sauce, 2 pound ground beef, 3 cartons of ricotta, 1 8 ounce bag Italian blend cheese, 1 8 ounce bag mozzerella.  After assembling layers, I used a spoon and made cuts through layers.  Then I shook the dish to help sauce seep through.

This is a terrific recipe for anyone tired of making regular spaghetti. My husband and daughter (a 13 yo spaghetti addict) love it and it even tastes great reheated. Recipes that become a regular in our house get 5 stars.

Easy and delicious! I made it according to the directions the first time and it was great. This time I used bean noodles, made my own sauce and cut out the ricotta/cottage cheese to cut calories, used pepperoni instead of beef and added fresh spinach. It was still a win for the whole family. A nice base recipe for those who are adventurous.

It wasn't bad but it wasn't good. I wouldn't make it again. It seemed pretty dry so I would definitely suggest adding more sauce.

This was quite easy and overall tasty.  I will skip the ricotta cheese next time as I just felt it gave the dish a crumbly texture rather than a creamy, cheesy texture.  Also, I know I will need to season the cooked ground turkey (I always substitute ground turkey for ground beef) as we just prefer a lot of spice and flavor.

This is a GREAT casserole, easy, makes lot's and smaller portions freeze nicely for a quick meal later on.  Make sure you use plenty of spaghetti sauce..I added an extra 1/2 cup and I used a combinatiion of shaved parmesan cheese, shredded cheddar and mozzarella.  Yum-m-m!

Great recipe! My husband loved it and it made for great leftovers. My only change next time will be less ricotta. The recipe called for 24 ounces and I put 15 ounces and it still seemed like way to much! Also, maybe a bit more noodles would be nice. :)

This was a wonderful Recipe. I did everything it says except I took advice from another review and put sauce on top of the noodles and then the ricotta cheese and then more suace and it was sooo excellent. I cooked it for 40 minutes with the foil on it and then 15 more uncovered and it was so great! My husband and I loved it, we just have a TON left over. I guess I didnt realize how much it made, but its really good as left overs as well! :)

Changed a couple things, I don't like swiss cheese so I didnt use that, but whatever cheese you prefer should work. I have made this a couple times and did add the sauce to  bottom and it makes a world of difference! I love this recipe and this website!!!

This is a great recipe. The only thing I did differently was used half ground beef and half italian sausage. I also layered the sauce, noodles, and cheese. My boyfriend absolutely loved this! Thanks for sharing!

This was easy and very good. I used a smaller carton of ricotta cheese and it was plenty. Once the casserole was assembled, I poked the casserole with a fork in several places and wiggled the fork to help the sauce mixture soak in before baking. It really tastes like lasagna but a lot easier.

This recipe was outstanding!!! My husband had a taste for a baked spaghetti and I had never made one before. I followed this recipe exactly for the most part. One thing that I did was I heated up my sauce in a small pan and added some italian seasonings then i added my cooked ground beef. Yummy!!! This also makes a great lunch the next day for work! Thanks for sharing!!

this was an excellent recipe!  like most of you already mentioned, i also used cooking spray at the bottom of the pan instead of foil. I also used my own preference of spagetti sauce (sweet pepper - chunky). This was a very tasty recipe!

My husband and I loved this. It was really easy too. I should have followed some of the other peoples instructions and layered the sauce directly on the spaghetti and then another layer on top of the ricotta, it would have given the bottom a bit more flavor but we just mixed it all up on our plates. I added fresh spinach which because I had a bunch and it gave it some color and healthful vitamins.

I've been trying to make baked spaghetti for years, but it always ends up tasting like pasta with sauce and cheese melted on top. Not this recipe! I'm so glad I found it. The only changes I made were I left out the meat and, instead put a layer of spinach on top of the ricotta layer, followed by the mozzarella. I also mixed minced fresh garlic in with the pasta and butter to give it all more flavor. I will make this at least once a month!!

Hadn't had baked spaghetti in years, so I decided to try this. I've never made it before so was skeptical, but it turned out great. Made a 15x10 pan of it and not even half of it is left. Kinda wonder if there will be any in the morning! Even my husbands ex wife said it was good; so that there is surely some kind of compliment! Thanks for posting it.

SO good!  A fabulous mixture of a lasagna and spaghetti.  Next time I won't mess with the foil lining though--it was hard to dip it up without getting some in the food.

Great dish with many changes! I used cooked sliced chicken breast instead of ground beef. Also used 1 pound rigatoni for the pasta. Here is the rest:  Combine hot cooked pasta with butter; stir until butter melts and coats pasta. Add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese; stir to coat. Put thin layer of sauce in pan and then arrange pasta in an even layer on top. Spread ricotta cheese over pasta. Add half of sauce. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Add browned ground beef or chicken, then mozzarella cheese and remaining Parmesan cheese. Top with remaining pasta sauce. Bake 45 minutes or until bubbly in middle. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.

I made this last night. Its an easy recipe however I did not like the way it turned out. I followed to the T but it seemed like the noodles had no flavor and all the flavor was in the top..So I would recommend mixing some sauce in with the noodles and use LESS ricotta

This was a nice change for an old favorite.  However, it's more work, so it's great for a night when you have a little extra time.

We really liked this and my kids (5,3, and 2) asked me if we could have it again. I used sour cream instead of ricotta or cottage cheese. It goes really well with a salad and the easy beer bread recipe on this site.

My family enjoyed this!  It is quite rich (maybe because I used whole milk mozzarella?)  Next time I'll use a full 16 oz. of pasta and add extra sauce.  It seemed to be mostly hamburger and cheese with very little pasta (I used linguine instead of spaghetti because that's what I had on hand.)  I also seasoned the hamburger with garlic salt, pepper, and onion.

This was absolutley delicious.  My entire family loved this recipe.  I did make a few changes to the recipe.  I used whole wheat spaghetti and chicken breasts cut up and seasoned before mixing with my own spaghetti sauce.  I also did not have enough parmesan or mozzarella so I used what ever shredded cheeses I had on hand.  It was fabulous.  Thank you for this recipe.

This was just OK. Made it to go with an excellent chicken Parm. I was making. It was a little more bland than what I expected but certainly edible. Not sure if I will make this one again or not.

I made this with whole wheat spaghetti, added a little garlic and used a mix of shredded mozzarela and provolone on the top, glad I did! I love that it calls for a lot of ricotta but next time I will add more sauce, too dry for my taste. My husband disagreed, he loved it and so did my toddlers!

Everyone loved this recipe.  I did put a little less than 1/2 of the sauce between the noodle & ricotta as sugg'd.  I'd maybe use a 2nd jar of sauce, most of one on the noodles & most of the rest with the meat.  For me it was a tad bit dry, but again that's the way my husb. perfers...maybe a happy medium.  I also added on sauted onion & garlic in the meat.   DEFINATELY WILL MAKE AGAIN.

I had never made baked spaghetti before but at my club we wanted something different than just regular spaghetti. This recipe sounded interesting so I made it. It was a huge success!!!! Even ones who didn't care for spaghetti had some and raved about it! I will definitely make it again! Thanks for sharing!

Great but I added 1 egg and cottage cheese and parmasan cheese and mixed it all up.  Needs lots of sauce to make it work.  Yum.

This was delicious!!! I added more sauce to the noodles as some of the others reviewers had ,and I added garlic salt to the boiling water before putting the spaghetti in, and didn't use foil for the bottom of the pan Other than that I didn't change a thing to the recipe...Thanks for a GREAT recipe.

Oh WOW!  This is very tasty.  Initially, I thought the recipe was wrong in calling for only 8oz of spaghetti - but -have no fear.  8 oz of spaghetti is correct.  I mixed the ricotta with 2% cottage cheese and it came out delicious!  My picky-eater 7 year old said, "3000 thumbs up"!!

Only rated it 4/5 because it lacked just a bit on the flavor, but over all a nice cheesy recipe that turns out great. Next time will add garlic and italian sesoning while browning my ground beef. I also followed whoami's suggestions (Feb 23/09) about the layering technique. I also did not bother lining my pan with foil but I did spray with PAM and it came out great.

Easy & got rave reviews from the family. Added some spices to the beef and some sauce to the bottom of the pan. Could use more noodles next time. Might've been my fault!

I really liked this recipe but my husband said it was the poor man's version of baked ziti. Whatever that means! There was a ton of food, so will definitely cut the recipe if I make it again since it was only the two of us and my fussy toddler.

Amazing everyone loved it and was simple to make. I took WHOAMIs suggestion and spread half the sauce over the spegetti and then the other half over the ricotta to even it out better. I also didnt use aluminium foil instead I just sprayed a casserole dish with cooking oil spray and put a lid on it. Thanks for the recipe

We followed directions exactly except we used a glass dish and sprayed with Pam instead of lining with foil. Ours didn't need to bake the full hour either. We'll treat ourselves to this again!  We eat pasta almost every Friday for our long Saturday morning runs. It's become a tradition for us. The was a fun change to our typical meal. We had lots left so froze for a later date!!

I made this last Sunday and my family loved it! Husband has been raving all week so I've decided to make this a weekly Sunday dinner. I'm actually making this again right now (it's Sunday :) ) I followed the directions almost exactly, except that I didn't have any parmesan cheese so I omitted it that time. I took another reviewer's advice and put a layer of sauce on the bottom of the pan. Oh, and I browned the ground beef with minced garlic, onions, and a pinch of crushed fennel seed. It was awesome. Served with a salad and homemade garlic toast.

i thought this was delicious! you should put about 1 cup of the sauce on the bottom of pan first.  then some of the noodles.(NOT all of em)....then more sauce...(like a cup) then the ricotta cheese and other cheeses.. (good healthy handful, spread evenly as best as u can)..will be a few clumps. DON'T WORRY about it.....then the crumbled sausage....(good handful and spread evenly) then cheeses and start the assembly line all over again,.  its like making lasagna..but 10x easier. better if you do it in layers. the RICOTTA helps the ENTREE taste THE best. DONT BE SHY WITH THE CHEESE either.    :))

Okay, to be fair, we didn't have ricotta or cottage cheese, so I skipped that step entirely.  Still, this recipe was a hit!  My husband made WAY to much spaghetti for his bible study, so instead of packing up the leftovers separately, I made this recipe and threw the rest away. It was amazing! The butter and Parmesan on the noodles made it so they didn't clump into a dry brick. I also  followed the advice of the other reviewers and put sauce down on the bottom layer and on top. Delicious! I'm almost afraid to add ricotta now and mess with a good thing.

Definite make-again recipe.  Followed the suggestion of whoami and put sauce on top of pasta and again on top of the cottage cheese.  My kids loved it.  Perfect for a larger gathering - especially involving kids.

This recipe was great! I did borrow a tip from another baked spaghetti recipe I had and used sloppy joe sauce instead of spaghetti sauce. It was amazing. It sounded weird at first, but I gave it a try because it was all I had in the house. It turned out great!

Good recipe. I think 8 oz is way too much spaghetti noodles. Next time I will layer more sauce on the bottom or before the ricotta. Otherwise it was very good.

I made this exactly as directed.  It was very good.  Next time, I will mix the meat/sauce mixture with the spaghetti, then layer the ricotta and mozzarella on top.  I was initially worried about the high calories for this dish, but my family of five only ate half of the pan.  This is more like 12 servings, which is about 350 calories with plenty of protein.

This was awesome. I'll probably never make spaghetti the old way again. I followed the recipe but didn't foil the pan first, I took another reviewers advice and put sause at the bottom and another persons advice about putting the sause over the noodles before the ricotta. My family enjoyed it very much. I will diffenatly be making this again. Thanks!

I made this recipe first exactly as written on a busy weeknight, and it was good. We all liked it, and the left overs were all eaten. I did use a few less noodles because we like it saucy.

The second time I made I sautéed green peppers, celery, onions, and mushrooms in the beef, added some garlic and Italian seasoning to the meat and veggie mixture, then deglazed the pan with 1/2 cup of red wine. I then added the jar of spaghetti sauce. I would only do this for company or on weekend when I have more time, but it was EXCELLENT! It turned it from good, to amazing. I was trying to use up the veggies so they wouldn't go bad, and it made a world of difference. My kids said it was the best spaghetti they'd ever had. They are 4 and 6 year old boys.

This was pretty good. I didn't have any ricotta or cottage cheese, so I used sour cream with garlic powder mixed in. I also didn't have ground beef, so i used Italian sausage. I took others advice and didn't bother with lining the pan with foil, but I did put some sauce on the bottom. I put the spaghetti (without the butter) next, sour cream, and finally the sauce with the sausage and some red peppers. It fed 3 adults (with seconds), 2 children and there's still leftovers :)

This was a great dinner for guest. It was quick and easy. Very good. I made a few slight changes. The first thing is not everyone likes meat so I made home made meat balls on the side. I ended up getting Traditional Prego because my family hates chunky sauce. I added in some Italian seasoning to the sauce to make up for the difference. In my ricotta cheese I made a mixture using the cheese, 1 egg, parsley, salt, pepper, and  oregano for more favor. Added more of the Parm cheese on the actually noodles after applying the butter instead of placing the rest on top of the ricotta mixture in the pan. I was worried the noodles would stick to the pan do I also added sauce to the bottom. Def will make again!

I used the recipe "Spaghetti Sauce II" for this recipe and the whole meal was great!  My Italian husband, who makes ALL of our sauce and meatballs said he was actually impressed with this meal.

This recipe was really good and easy. I only made a couple changes. I didn't line the bottom with foil but I did cover the top with it. I used a little less ricotta and 3 cups of mozzerella instead of 2. I still baked it for 45 minutes but only kept the foil on for 20 minutes since my family loves well done cheese. I also did as previous posters recommended and started with a sauce layer.

I spiced it up a little to suite my families taste by sautéing onion and garlic with some dried italian seasoning with browned loose italian sausage. It was very well received and there were no leftovers. Next time I will let it rest, covered, closer to 30 min before serving, it will still be plenty warm and will hold it's shape better.

We loved this!  I used angel hair pasta & I added a little extra tomato sauce to the spaghetti sauce for more juice.  I also mixed the ricotta cheese with some tomato sauce before spreading over noodles.  Followed recipe for everything else and it was great!

This recipe is delicious and easy to make! I normally use ground beef, but occasionally I substitute it for sweet Italian sausage. I also spray the pan with non-stick spray instead of lining it with aluminum foil. It comes out great every time!

This was a big hit. My husband and the in laws loved this. My father in law didn't want to stop eating. Love it just the way it is. I did use cooking spray as another reviewer suggested and completely forgot to pick up parmesan cheese, but the little I had left in the fridge worked just find.

Not only was my husband impressed but so was I! I used more cheese than recommended for the simple fact I didn't know if it would be enough sauce in the pasta. Overall it came out great!

Excellent! Easy to make.  I used thin spaghetti,  ricotta instead of cottage cheese and 8 oz. of 6-cheese shredded Italian in place of mozzarella.  Did not line the pan - sprayed w/Pam and it came out fine.  I did buy the 45 oz. jar of sauce so I could have extra sauce on the side. Stay with the Prego Chunky Garden Italian Sauce. Has a great flavor.  Definately a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I both really enojoyed this dish.  The only thing I did different was mixed all the sauce , ground chicken and half the mozzarella in the casserole dish then topped it with the rest of the cheese. I did not line the dish with foil or spray and had no problems with it sticking. I also added a little bit of Italian seasoning and garlic salt. I will be making this again.

We both really enjoyed this recipe. I had to make a few changes due to what I had on hand and it still tasted amazing. I used  16 oz ricotta and 8 oz sour cream,1 lb Jimmy dean regular sausage instead of ground beef and followed other suggestions to put half of the meat sauce over the noodles before layering the other ingredients.

Thank you for the wonderful recipe it is a nice change of pace and oh so good!

I halved this recipe and there was still a ton.  However, I still used 24 ounce jar of sauce b/c most baked pastas seem dry to me.  I used a medium onion, a small green pepper, chopped up several mushrooms, and sauteed it with garlic before mixing with the meat.  I also used 25 ounces of cottage cheese, b/c that's what it came in and it seemed stupid to leave 3 ounces out.  I put sauce on the bottom of the pan like someone else did and left out the foil on the bottom.  I also took advice and used sharp cheddar along with mozzarella b/c I did not want it to taste exactly like lasanga.  This was pretty excellent.  Husband LOVED it and kept raving.

Great recipe! Definitly needs more sauce. Another jar would've been perfect. I did add grilled onions and garlic while cooking the beef though. Very good, just needs more juiceness!!

i loved this recipe! i have never baked spaghetti before and it was a success. I used ground beef and sweet italian sausage. i also used 15oz of ricotta cheese instead of the recommended 24oz. and i mixed two different sauces, the garden combo and the tomato and romano cheese sauce. delish!

Delicious!  I double the recipe (which makes a ton!) and we have leftovers for the next day.  My family loved it!  Clean up is easy with the no stick wrap, which is a HUGE plus :)

Great Recipe. Very easy to make.  You will have lots to share!!   Ended up using 1/2 the ricotta cheese as I ran out of room in my pan.

I made this recipe a couple nights ago. My mom has CHF and we have to be cautious about the sodium she takes in, so I made my own sauce and used this has a base recipe. It turned out great! What leftovers we had were gobbled up by lunch time the next day.   Reccomendations: Make sure to have some extra sauce (you can even double up the sauce) staying warm on the stove while you bake the casserole. Then when it's ready to serve dollop on some extra sauce to make sure the noodles aren't dry!

This is a really good and tasty dish! I did use less riccotta the second time I made it, and I mixed the noodle layer in spaghetti sauce so it wouldn't be too dried out. This dish has good flaver. Use garlic salt or Italian seasoning when browning the beef or sausage. Very easy to prepare!

Rating is based on my spaghetti-loving kid's opinion, and served it at his surprise 16th birthday party. I may make again, but with additional seasoning and more sauce.  I served this to a group of 16 to 19 year old boys and it was just no competition for the buttermilk- soaked, panko-crusted chicken nuggets.

This was delicious and easy!  I think next time we make it we may add some other herbs: basil, garlic, and other yummy things, but even without it I loved it.  Pretty simple to make and I'm about to go back for thirds!  YUM!!!

Sooo delicious...I made it for the second time over the weekend. My boyfriend had some of his family up and this dish worked out perfectly.The only change I made was making my own spaghetti sauce from scratch and using wheat noodles. Nobody knew the difference:) It was just that great!!!

I am giving this a 5 star because it is good and my children loved it! Our 5 year old loves it and even our 2 year old ate it for 3 meals and it is had to get him to eat much of anything. My husband liked it. The next time I make it I am going to take the advice of the member that layered it differently because she said she liked it but something was just missing. That is the same way I felt.By popular demand I guess this is a keeper no matter how I layer it.LOL

Ehh.. I don't know if I'll be having this again. It was a little 'bland' for my taste. I think if I would have added a little extra of something, such as adding mushrooms, it would have been better. Like some of the other reviewers have said, it tasted like regular spaghetti with mozzarella cheese spread all over it. I did add sauce to the bottom of pan and I do think that made it more moist than without the sauce at the bottom.

I made this recipe with ricotta cheese but without ground beef.  It felt a little "thin" for a 9x13 pan and when I try it again (which I will!) I will use a smaller pan so each piece feels more substantial.

This was a very good, filling and easy recipe for my family.  I don't eat meat, so I substituted the meat for soy (the kids never missed the meat at all!).  I also added a dash of sugar and added onions and peppers.  Very good recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

I'm a new cook and I really enjoyed making this easy recipe. The recipe called for a bit too much ricotta cheese, I used 15 oz instead. Leftovers didn't last long at my house, it was a big hit! I will definitely be making this one again soon.

Even the picky eaters in our house LOVED this meal! Easy and the leftovers are great for work. I used "Light" cheese and it still turned out wonderful!

I made this for a dinner with guests this past Sunday.  I added green pepper, onion, garlic to the meat (and 1 lb to the meat).  I doubled the sauce and put a jar on the bottom with the spaghetti.  It was still very dry- not one compliment (except my DH who stated more sauce wld have been better).  It just didn't presentn well with the stringy spaghetti.  It would work to have an extra jar of sauce warmed to put on after cooking.  I used to eat this as a waitress in restaurants and they always had the same kind of dry dish problem.  Honestly plain spaghetti w/sauce would have tasted so much better and be much less work and expense.

My family loves this. I wanted to make something to take to my sister but have enough for my family to eat for dinner as well, so I used 16 oz. of thin spaghetti with 1/2 a stick of butter and however much parm cheese my daughter dumped in. I browned 3 lb. of ground chuck with a green pepper and half an onion, once it was browned and drained I added two cans of the cheapey hunts spaghetti sauce ( I figured the sauce wouldn't really matter in this type of a dish). I used a large tub of ricotta cheese and 4 cups of mozz. cheese. I cooked about 25 minutes longer. The dish was so heavy, it was almost pouring out of the casserole dish a size up form the 9x13 baking dish. This is usually the only way that I make spaghetti now.

The Prego blend was not available at the store, so I used Prego tomato & basil. Also, used a Parmesan/Romano grated blend. Produced a very mild pasta dish, best eaten scrambled up on your plate, rather than in intact layers.

This is the best spaghetti recipe. I've made it so many times. The only thing I changed is, I doubled the spaghetti pasta to 16 oz. which is the whole package, instead of 8 oz. I also add chopped sauteed italian sausages to my sauce.

This was a very easy delicious dish. Every one loved it and thought I should fix this all the time. I did make one change. I used an Italian 5 cheese mix instead of just Mozzarella cheese. YUMMY! I will definintly make again.

SO Yummy!  If you can get past the munching on the cheese while you are cooking it!  My twist, in the ricotta, instead of it being plain, I mixed it with one egg and salt and pepper!  YUMMY!!   plus top with a home made sauce with Italian Sausage and hamburger!!! OMG!! SO GOOD!!!  Thanks for sharing.. my alternative to plain spaghetti~~

I actually followed how to bake more than how to make it. I mixed the butter and Parmesan cheese on top of the stove. I also cooked spaghetti sauce with it. Just enough so it wouldn't be dry. When it came to baking, I added a thin layer of cheese on top then covered it with foil. A little bit of cheese stuck onto the foil but the overall results were fabulous.

I gave this 3 stars because I didn't care for the ricotta cheese. I actually really like ricotta, but not in spaghetti. The parmesan and butter in the noodles tasted really good and I took others' advice and added a layer of sauce to the bottom of the pan. This really wasn't bad, but next time, I think I will omit the ricotta or use ALOT less.

Very yummy! I, however, made my own homemade sauce. I've just found the spices to be better than any I can find in pre-made sauces. I made it for a friend, and she requested the recipe.

This has quickly become a staple in my home.  My friends at work request that I make it often so I will bring in leftovers.  I always use cottage cheese in stead of ricotta, however.

This was good, but a little dry. I used Prego Sausage and Garlic Sauce, and added a can of mushrooms, but it was unanimous that it needed more spaghetti sauce. I might try this again, and use half ground beef and half sausage, too.

This was awesome!  I just made some simple changes per other reviewer suggestions: (1) I seasoned my beef with some garlic, oregano, and basil; (2) used half of the sauce in with the beef mixture, the other half used in between layers and (3) only used half the amount of ricotta cheese.  This will definately be made again and again in our house.

EXCELLENT! When browning the meat, I added fresh garlic, onion, and my fav. spices.  I didn't foil the bottom of my dish (no need to)...just sprayed it with Pam.  I layered as follows: Spaghetti, half the sauce mix, cottage cheese, other half of the sauce, and topped it with cheese.  Came out PERFECTLY!

This was ok.  Lasagna tastes much better.  I won't be making this again as it lacked flavor.  It definitely needs extra sauce and additional layering, like is done with lasagna.

FANTASTIC!  I'm still a newbie cook, and tried this recipe. It was extremely delicious, probably the best one I have tried (out of maybe 5 - told you I was a newbie). Thank you!  I didnt line the pan with aluminum foil because I didn't have non stick foil, but I did spread butter on the bottom of it.   The only change I made was instead of parmesan cheese (my step-son has a reaction to it) I used a taco-blend cheese.

My husband said that I could cook this every night of the week!  This recipe was fast and easy.  I did not use a foil lined pan.  I just lightly sprayed my pan.

Very yummy! I used all cottage cheese because I don't like ricotta all that much. The only other thing I did was add onions and garlic. Thank you

This turned out fantastic!  Didn't bother with the foil on the bottom as others suggested, I sprayed the pan however it did sorta burn a bit to the bottom, next time I will try it with foil on the bottom and see if that makes a difference at all.  I think this recipe is great as is but can be tweaked with any extra ingedients that you or your family might like.  Hubby and I decided next time to add some fresh mushrooms and thinly sliced green pepper and maybe some pepperoni.  Definitely one of those recipes you can play around with.  Thanks for the great recipe!

We tried this last night and loved it. I did chop up some mushrooms and put them under the sauce. It added some awesome flavor!! I didn't put the foil down either and it worked just fine. You have to try this recipe.

I assembled this recipe per others suggestions and based on a standard lasagne assembly.  Lined the bottom of the pan with extra sauce and not foil.  I also seasoned the spaghetti with some garlic powder, salt and extra parmesan since others complained of this layer being dry and/or bland.  I then put most of the mozzarella over the ricotta layer, topped with the meat sauce, and a small amount of the remaining mozzarella. As a result it was flavorful and moist. Next time I will throw in a layer of seasoned spinach to add some veggies to the recipe.

Yum. Loved how it looked when perfectly baked. Followed some reviewer comments. Did not line pan with foil. Used glass baking dish and spread just enough sauce to cover bottom before adding noodles. Used linguini. Also used Italian link sausage I already had thawed, cut into chunks like meatballs for meat layer. Those topped with mozz and a spinkling of grated romano (a little more punch) gave the dish a semi-bumpy, lightly browned, atractive appearance when done. Again, yum.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe. I used half cottage cheese and half ricotta. Other wise did as said. Bland big time. Spaghetti at bottom had no flavor.. Will try again but will put sauce mixture on the spaghetti not over the cheese. Will also use different cheeses. Swiss, cheddar, and mozzerella come to mind. Use some spices too.

For the time involved and all the litle satisfied faces at the dinner table, I whole-heartedly give this five stars!  Although I must mention that I substituted soy crumbles for the ground beef and used brown rice pasta.  It was easy, delicious, and filling!

My husband and I LOVED this! It is so similar to lasagna, probably because of the ricotta, but it is much more affordable!!! We have already decided this will stay in our rotation of recipes and can't wait to serve it to company! We also had a ton of leftovers and they reheat beautifully so don't worry (add a little water or a damp paper towel over top when microwaving it definitely helps!) SO glad we tried this.

I made this recipe and followed the recommendations of putting sauce on the bottom of the pan.  I also add lots of cheese to it.  The leftovers went to my husband's class and they LOVED it.  They begged him to have me make them their own.  I did and they devoured it.  Great recipe one of my favs.

Excellent! I made this with no Parmesan cheese and added fresh garlic to the meat. Also I just a small 4x4 glass pan. It made enough for 2 people. This is really more lasagna but it's great and pretty easy. Oh I also used egg noodles. I will made with some Italian sausage next time. Wonderful!

I thought this was quite tasty, but not fall-over-myself delicious.  I'll definitely make it again, but I'll also be sure to have enough mozzarella so I don't have to substitute cheddar (although that's not the reason for only four stars, it's just a heads-up that the cheddar tastes a little funky with this recipe).

This recipe was very yummy! Like others, I did not use foil.  I made it in a glass casserole dish and it came out fine.  I only had 1/2 a carton of fat free cottage cheese, so I used that, it was actually enough to cover it.  Like some other reviewers I added 2 cloves of garlic, minced, probably about 1 tsp.  I also used Prego Roasted Garlic and Herb sauce and it was great.  I will definitely make this again, maybe with whole wheat spaghetti to make it a little healthier.

Delicious!  This tasted like lasagna without all the work.  I did not line my pan with foil, just used cooking spray, and I didn't have any trouble.  I also put a little sauce on the bottom of the pan so the spaghetti wouldn't dry out.

Really Good!  I modified the recipe a bit to be pretty much my lasagne recipe but built according to the stated directions and with spaghetti.  It was a lot easier than dealing with lasagne noodles and all that layering.  I did not use the foil.

I give it five stars not just for taste, but it is sooo easy. I used lean ground beef, fat-free cottage cheese, no butter and part-skim mozzarella for a healthier meal. It still tasted great!
