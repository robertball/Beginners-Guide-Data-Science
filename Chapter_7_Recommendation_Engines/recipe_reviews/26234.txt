These were good, but a little sweet & I think I might add more anise oil next time.  My neighbor makes these every Christmas & let me borrow her cookie stamps.  Her recipe is a little more cake-like & less sweet.  I'm not sure which way is traditional, but I think I'll experiment a bit more with this recipe.
