I changed this recipe a little by using boneless, skinless chicken breast and I used a container of all ready made up seasoned bread crumbs but I cut it down to using 1 cup of the crumbs. 
The crumbs were very granulated and I didn't want to overwhelm the taste of the Dijon mustard sauce. I also added garlic powder to the sauce (1 teaspoon). 
After I made the sauce, I really liked the flavor and added a side dish of cooked, sliced red potatoes and drizzled the sauce over them when served.
This dish was very moist after baking it uncovered for an hour and the potatoes with the sauce was excellent.
This sauce will be used again on many of my recipes that calls for Dijon mustard.

This dijon chicken was amazing, and so easy to make! It doesn't even need the white wine. When coating with the bread crumbs, start out with half the suggested amount, as I found that the full amount was way more than needed.

This is a favorite of ours and I make it almost once a week.  I add 1/4 cup of grated parmasean cheese to the bread crumb mixture and it seems to give it a little more crunch to the breading.  So good and good for you.

wasn't very good at all!
If I was doing something wrong, feel free to tell me, but I tasted no dijon when it was finished, and it was too breaded!!!  I had to melt cheese on it to rescue it!

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, and we loved this.  I reduced the salt (I just sprinkled a little in the sauce, not directly on the chicken), and increased the sauce a little (not quite double though b/c I didn't have enough Dijon), what I had leftover after dipping the chicken into I added a little more butter and white wine to, let simmer a few minutes and drizzled over the chicken.  It was delish.  I also sprinkled a little bit of Parmesan cheese in with the bread crumbs.  This was a nice change.  Will make again!

My husband & I enjoyed this chicken dish tonight.  I took suggestions from other reviewers and left out the white wine & cut back on the bread crumbs.  It was delicious.  Definitely making "the rotation" in our house.  Thanks!

I substituted smashed chipotle croutons for the breadcrumbs. I think it may have been a little bland without this addition, but overall, it was delicious and very easy. The breading did stick to the pan a bit, but that may have been my fault.

i love this recipe, although i tweak the sauce for my tastes. I use dry vermouth instead of white wine, country dijon (course mustard), add a shallot with the garlic, add a little bit of honey and spicy italian seasoning and fresh ground pepper. I always double the sauce because its so good. I also use panko breadcrumbs with a little parmesan cheese as the coating and it is delish. Great with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans or butter brown sugar and onion carrots.

This was a good recipe.  I didn't use salt.  I used 1 tablespoon lemon garlic seasoning instead (salt in it), simmered it right in the sauce.  I upped the amount of everything in the sauce so we would have extra.  I poked the chicken a few times and let it sit in the sauce before dipping it in the bread crumbs.  I ran the bread crumbs through a mini food processer so they were super fine.  I used about 1 cup total.  It was really good.

I needed a recipe like this when I discovered that I hadn't purchased a few things for our family's favorite Lemon Dijonnaise Chicken (not on this site). Silly me forgot the word "Lemon" was in the title. Anyway, I came here in the hopes of saving dinner and found this recipe. I used boneless/skinless breasts and found that I had no breadcrumbs. I made the dish anyway but it turned out so bland! I was not impressed. Maybe the breadcrumbs would have made a big difference in the flavor, but I'm not so sure. With all those flavorful ingredients this recipe was surprisingly dull. Sorry! We won't be making this again. :\

Dijon Chicken Haiku: "Um WOW this was goooood. Added parmesan to crumbs, used no bone, no skin." I saturated the chicken (boneless skinless breast halves) in the dijon/garlic/wine mixture, pressed it in the crumbs (WAY too much bread crumbs called for in the recipe) mixed w/ 1 TB parmesan, and returned the chicken to the cast-iron skillet where I let both sides brown quickly (2 min. tops) then transferred skillet to oven for 20 min. to finish baking. Moist and flavorful, but in making again, I would use way less bread crumbs, continue to add the parmesan, and definitely do bone-in, skin-on breast b/c I'm sure it'd be even more flavorful.

Hey!  I didn’t really care for sauce in the sauce pan plain so I was nervous, but put together with chicken and seasoned panko, it was really good!  Thanks!  Yellow potato and asparagus side.

I really liked this recipe, but no one else in my house liked it.  The mustard flavor is really strong.  Sigh.  I'm actually a little sad that I wont be able to make this  very often or at all.  If you love mustard like I do, go for it!  If not then avoid this one.  It is yummy though!  ;(

Love this!  Thanks for posting such a wonderful and flexible recipe.  I made a few changes, some of my own and used some at the suggestion of other reviewers.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and added freshly graded parmessean to the bread crumbs.  I used half plain panko crumbs and half Italian bread crumbs for a crispier crust.  I also used extra virgin olive oil in lieu of butter; next time I will use more oil and pierce the chicken as one reviewer suggested.   I also cooked this for the first 30 minutes covered.   The next time I will add some of the mustard/wine mixture to the rice I served with this dish.

The dijon chicken was delicious, flavorful, and moist.  I substituted white vinegar for the white wine in a pinch.  Next time I am trying skinless chicken breast per my husband's request.
