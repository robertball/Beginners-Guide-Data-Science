This was amazing.  I pan seared the tuna and it was just like I would love to have at a restaurant.  The EVOO wasn't really necessary in the salsa.  The Cantaloupe was very ripe as it was and the EVOO added unnecessary liquid.  I also used a basil herb blend rather than fresh basil so that may have added to the additional liquid.

The salsa was tasty, as was the fish. The problem: the salsa got lost on the meaty fish. I would totally make this again, but with a more delicate fish like Tilapia.

This was my first attempt at cooking tuna and my husband and I loved it.  It is a great summer meal: quick, light and satisfying.  I will definitely make this again.

I have made this recipe minus the basil but with ripe mango instead of cantalope for many years, since I grew up in the Caribbean.  The taste of mango is stronger and tends to not get lost with the fish.  I also use Key limes.  It is one of my favorite combinations.

My parents like it. I used dried Basil leaves since I didn't have fresh. They thought it was too much of the salsa mix. I served Greek salad with.

This was fantastic. It had an amazing combination of flavors. I eyeballed ingredients and used less basil than called for and grilled tuna over charcoal. Would make it again.

Love this on tuna steaks. I didn't have red chili pepper so I used fresh diced red bell pepper and Splenda instead of sugar. Will def make again!!

I used mango in place of melon, and it was a delicious and simple meal!
