Good as a very basic recipe, but it needs more seasoning - a little turmeric, ground coriander, ground cumin, some cayenne. Salt and pepper too. I made it with coconut milk but also added a glug of heavy cream. A medium potato, peeled and diced, makes it go a little further too. This turned out nicely but it needs a bit of tweakage. Thanks!

I gave this five stars with taking into account Caroline C's tips on adding spices.  I added extra curry paste, cumin, coriander, cayenne, salt&pepper, and otherwise followed the recipe.  I really think the added spices are important.  I loved the smooth delicious flavor of this HEALTHY soup and will definitely make it again!

This was a fabulous soup - I did doctor the ingredients a bit - I added more curry paste, cayenne pepper, Kosher salt and dried basil leaves. My boyfriend insists that on the next go-around I add baby peas and shrimp - since he has very good taste, I just might listen (for once). Thank you for submitting this healthy and delicious meal. Cheers! **Update** - added the shrimp and it was . . . SWITCHED ON! (a.k.a EXCELLENT!) - Thanks again

This soup is amazing!  I used light coconut milk and low sodium chicken broth. I also sprayed the vegetables lightly with olive oil before roasting. I used Thai Kitchen red curry paste which is VERY spicy, but thats ok... in the bottom of the soup cup, I put fresh pineapple chunks and a small scoop of brown rice. The pineapple added just a bit more flavor and toned the heat down a bit. Will make often this winter!  Hubby suggested shrimp in it too like another cook here did.

I loved this soup!! I didn't follow the directions exactly (as I had to wait for my husband to bring me some missing coconut milk & curry paste). Reduced the stock by about 2 cups since I like thick soups... but it was DELICIOUS! Next time I'll try a hotter curry paste and not a mild.

Very tasty indeed - however as per the other reviewers I would def pimp this one up with extra spices - I followed all directions except that I whizzed up a good chunk of ginger, fresh coriander, small handfull of black peppercorns, dash of tumeric and garam masala powders with 2 tablespoons of tikka masala curry paste, then fried this in some oil before adding the vegetable stock, coconut milk and roasted cauliflower/onion and garlic. YUM - next time I'll make it with two heads of cauliflower and feed the masses :)

Very good soup.  I was very liberal with the curry paste.  I added a healthy dash of cayenne along with tumeric, tarragon, and curry powder in generous proportions.  I used light coconut milk and a dollup of fat free greek yogurt for good measure.  It came out well.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  It's great for cold winter nights.

Deeelish!!  But don't think you can skip the cauliflower and just add more onions LOL.  Waaay too oniony and I like onions.  So, I bought cauliflower the next day, doubled the rest of the ingredients to make up for the extra onions and it worked out wonderfully.  Only change I made was beef stock instead of veggie, and omitted the garlic because I don't do garlic.

I thought this soup was excellent. I think the type of curry paste used makes all the difference. I used red curry paste and I didn't have to add any extra spices. Red curry can be very spicy so for people that don't want the extra spice they should choose a milder curry paste. It was perfect for me. I think it would also be good not blended if you wanted a chunky soup. I also used light coconut mild and used 4 cups of bouillon. Excellent!

A good start for a curried cream vegetable soup.
Still was missing some oomph.

Very fast and easy.  I  cut the curry in half for the kids the adults stirred in extra at the table.  Added toasted chunks of whole wheat pita croutons.

As for taste, this was fantastic. I very much added more then double of all the spices and added minced ginger to this as well.  My only complaint was that the consistency was hard to get right as well as the color of the soup. It wasn't pretty but it sure tasted fantastic.

I didnt have all the ingredients so I changed the recipe quite a bit. I added two diced potatoes to the vegetable stock and added soy milk. I replaced the curry paste with cumin and ginger. This turned out excellent!

Really yummy when you give it a little more oomph -  less liquid + more spices.  I also added a can of chick peas and topped it with some sriracha and yogurt at the end.  It turned out great!

Love this recipe and make it often  Sometimes I modify by adding ingredients to make it more of a hearty meal.  I add cubed potatoes, sliced carrots and cubed ham.

I have made this 4 times now, and it's the perfect winter soup. Obviously, the quality and amount of spice depends on the kind of curry you use.  I have used curry powder instead of paste, starting with a tablespoon and adding more as needed.

I didn't add any other seasonings but my curry paste is pretty heavy on the spices.  Mine was not as thick as the one pictured.  Mine turned out very soup-like.  I think next time I'll cut down on the stock.  The flavor was very good, however.  My DH did heat up some leftover rice and added it to his.  He said it made it more hearty.  I will make this again.  Great vehicle for cauliflower that doesn't involve cheese!

This is a very easy soup to make.   I used a red Thai curry paste which is spicy, so did not need to add any other spices except for salt and pepper.   Soup was delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.   I will be making this again.

As others have said in other reviews, this is a great base. I skipped the curry paste. I added two diced potatoes to the roasted veggies. I added a tablespoon of curry powder, a tsp each of ground cumin, ground coriander and turmeric and 1/2 tsp of salt and a pinch of pepper. Finally I added 250ml of whipping cream. Instead of blending the ingredients, I used a potato masher which left the soup nice and chunky. Delicious!

I have made this soup a few times & it is a great soup.
I take the onion,garlic. Celery & also carrots  ( 3 carrots chopped in circles & two tablespoons of coconut oil & sauté for a few minutes & then add the chopped up cauliflower.Saute  for a few more minutes & add low sodium chicken broth & coconut milk.When cauliflower & carrots are done to the consistency I like- I then puree a quarter of the cauliflower & then add back into the soup pot .Bring to just a slow boil & then put on simmer & thicken with potato flakes.  
You can make this soup spicy  as much as you like or not.

Amazing and easy! Used green curry paste, a tablespoon of curry powder, sautéed the onion first. Blended it up in my vitamix but left some chunks in the soup. Delish! Made a ton so will freeze some too.

I got the basic idea from this recipe, then changed a lot of it.  Added spices - turmeric, curry powder and cumin - added sauteed leek, and wilted bok choy, and saffron yellow rice.  Did not puree - when the roasted cauliflower simmers for about 20 minutes, it is perfectly soft without being mushy.  Did not use onion or garlic. Used chicken stock instead of vegetable. Had to give kudos to this one for getting me started, even if I did turn it into my own creation after that.  I have submitted the full changed recipe for review.  Good base, thank you, but I'm excited about the new dish I created from starting with this one.  Hopefully it will be available to review soon too!

This recipe is basic in of itself, here is what I added (based on the other reviews; thank you!):

-1 extra TBSP of curry paste (so 2 TBSP's total...I could have added a little bit more and I don't think it would have been too much). I used Thai Kitchen Red Curry paste! 
-1/2 teaspoon of coriander, 1/2 teaspoon of cumin, 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric, a dash of cayenne, salt & pepper. 

The texture is very cauilflower-y to me, but I love it. If you don't, then blend it for a little bit longer. Be aware of the steam that will escape from the top when you remove the blender lid! I think all of the extra seasonings were necessary, otherwise it would have been a very bland-tasting soup. I will remake and play around with different seasonings and vegetables! Bon appétit!

I just finished making this soup.  I used curry powder vs. curry paste, because that is what I had on hand.  That said, I find the taste to be pretty bland.  I'm not sure what I can add to add to improve the taste.

This is a fantastic vegan soup! I left out the onion and used a pinch of garlic powder since I was out of fresh garlic. It did need a bit more seasoning, so I added a pinch of ground cardamom, about 1/2 teaspoon of ground coriander and about a teaspoon of ground turmeric. Perfect! Hubby loved it. This is a very good base recipe.

I was looking for a lower carb option of my favorite butternut squash soup and came across this one . . . it was great. I did find after tasting upon completion, it needed more flavor for our taste, so I added more curry and garlic  . . . and included cinnamon and a bit of ginger.  My husband who does not like cauliflower loves it.  It is a repeat soup for sure!

I will make this again but with the added spices as others have recommended. I did not have any luck roasting the cauliflower so next time I will boil it. Three hours later, the soup is still simmering and the cauliflower doesn't taste cooked yet.

Great base recipe but I did add extra spices and was generous with the curry powder and , it's great.
My specific modifications were 1 box of chkn stock (900ml, could use veg), HEAPING 1 tbsp mild curry paste, heaping 1 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp ground coriander, 1 tsp grd ginger, liberal salt/pepper + depending on how spicy you like it, add a 1/4-1/2 tsp cayenne pepper.
I roasted the veggies with a healthy drizzle of olive oil for probably 45 min, to really give the soup a depth of flavour. I think this made a big difference. And I cooked the soup for longer too and processed for a long time with a hand blender, as I found the soup was a smidge too gritty otherwise (from the roasting), and if you blended it a few times, you got a much smoother soup. 
This will definitely be a go to anytime cauliflower is on sale.

A good soup on a cold night! I did make some modifications after reading through the reviews. I only used about a third of an onion, since I am not a big onion fan. Tossed the cauliflower onion and garlic with a bit of olive oil (1-2 T.) before roasting. I added some spices as suggested - increased the curry paste to 2T (red curry paste), added the following: 1 t. turmeric, ~1/2+ t. of cumin, ~ 1/2+ t. of curry powder, few shakes of cayenne pepper, few shakes of salt and pepper. It was plenty spicy for me (I like just mild spices). I added a dollop of sour cream to cool the spices a bit. Very good. I did puree about 2/3 of the cauliflower, leaving some big chunks. I will make this again. I think it would be good with some potatoes and carrots in it. May try that next time!

Simple and good.  I added a little cayenne, turmeric, ground ginger and black pepper and served it with a dollop of sour cream.  Probably could have benefitted from some cumin and cilantro garnish. If I make it again, I might add a little yogurt to up the protein a bit instead of the sour cream garnish.

Definitely add more spices, and serve with chopped cilantro to sprinkle on top. You can ramp up the heat to match your guests' tolerance levels, or serve with hot sauce on the side. It makes great leftovers, too.

I made this for the soup of the day at my restaurant and made a minor tweak instead of chicken stock I used mushroom base not only making it vegetarian but popping the mushroom flavor more. I got lots of compliments. Will definitely add this to my soup line up.....

This was really good, the type of curry you use will make all the difference. I thought it was too thin, next time I will use a 32 oz carton of broth instead of 5 cups.

I made some tweaks in the seasoning too.  I doubled the recipe to take to a friend and feed my own family.  I salt and peppered the veggies and roasted with olive oil and a little unsalted butter.  I added 1.5 tbsp. of curry paste but added turmeric, ginger, cumin, paprika, celery salt, and garlic powder.  I only added 6 cups of veggie stock.  My husband who can't stomach spicy foods at all really liked it.  The soup was hearty, relatively easy to make and very good.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wouldn't change a thing on this, we thoroughly enjoyed it exactly as written.  You first taste the sweetness of the roasted veggies, and then the coconut-curry flavor comes on board. The "heat" of the soup will depend on the type of red curry paste that you use, so this may need to be adjusted to your taste preference, but ours had just the right amount of kick for us.  Garnished with a dollop of yogurt and a mint sprig.

I added a few extra ingredients, celery to roast with the rest of the veggies, and  increased the spices like the reviews said and it is a great spicy soup. Put a little   rice in the bowl first and then add the soup ,sounds like a great idea .

Doubled the recipe and added all the extra spices that were advises. Had this with Twice-Cooked Coconut Shrimp on the side and some cheese curls on top. My company loved this and asked if they could take some home. Thank you.

This soup is awesome! I only deviated from the recipe slightly by adding TWO tbsp of a red thai curry paste and 1 tsp of red pepper flakes (the curry paste I used was not very spicy/hot). I added two ribs of celery, chunked, along with the cauliflower and onion and coated them with olive oil and some salt and pepper before roasting them in the oven. I will definately make this one again...it's healthy, easy and delicious.

I followed others' suggestions and added a can of garbanzos and a potato to thicken the soup. I also sprinkled the veggies with olive oil before roasting. I used a generous tablespoon of Madras curry paste and it is excellent!

Based on other reviews, I added cumin, turmeric, and coriander.  It tasted pretty good, but was too thin.  I feel like it needed something else like mushrooms, shrimp, or green veggies.

Great recipe!  I didn't have vegetable stock, so I used bouillon cubes.  I didn't have curry paste, so I used 1 tsp each of turmeric and coriander, half a tsp of cumin and half a tsp of cayenne pepper.  I also threw in a piece of ginger and a carrot and roasted them as well.

Very tasty!  May not puree as long next time and leave some veggie chunks.  Added some Cayenne pepper, and used yellow curry powder.  Served with warm nan bread.   My 1 1/2 year old loved it too.

Made this last night as part of New Years Eve dinner-was so yummy! I did not have curry paste-so I used curry powder, cumin and coriander instead-and added more garlic (we love garlic). Also used 4 cups stock and added a bit of heavy cream....will be making this again! Thank you
