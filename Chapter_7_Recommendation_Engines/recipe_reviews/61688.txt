Love this recipe - everyone else does too! Thanks to all who took the time to comment. Since many said to make sure to drain well, I did. It was perfect. The little trick I did was to put the fruit in the salad spinner. Wala! Problem solved.

Very good! Mine ended up a little watery but it had great flavor, and the toffee was wonderful.

Made it for a New Years Eve potluck and it was a hit! It was a perfect complement to the Honeybaked ham that the hostess served along with the other green salads. I was looking forward to taking home the leftover but the hostess gave me back my clean bowl. When asked for the recipe, I don't bother writing it down for them. I simply say, "Allrecipe.com" and they know what to do. I made the recipe as is, minus the walnuts (nut restriction) and marshmallows (wanted the salad to be less like a dessert). Everyone wanted to know what was  the crunch in the salad and were excited to know about the toffee bits. Used pineapple tidbits, instead of crushed. I added the mandarins oranges as late in the mixing as possible to minimize crushing. NOTE: Drain fruits very well to avoid soupy salad. I am now looking for the next occasion to make this again and try to whip my own heavy cream instead of CoolWhip.

I did forget to add to the recipe but YES make sure to drain the fruit well... I have even used paper towels gently to dry it off!  That way the salad doesn't get soupy.  Also good with flavored cool whip when it's available or adding a little bit of vanilla extract.

I made this for Easter dinner and everyone loved it and said I could make this anytime.  In previous reviews I noticed mention of the mix being watery so I added a 3-oz package of Red Velvet Pudding.  This addition totally eliminated that problem.  You could safely use any flavor of pudding.

I omitted the toffee but it was still so delicious.  A definite hit for functions when you have so little time and people to please.

I made this using homemade whipped cream which I doubled.  I did not add walnuts or toffee bit but I did find butterfinger bits.  I wanted to see if this was as good as my grandmother's.   Although this was tasty, nothing touches grandma's.  All in all a tasty ambrosia salad.

I have made this many times, It does get watery, so drain your fruits well and let dry some, if possible, and be gentle tossing them together so oranges do not break. I have used "Heath" bits when toffee not available - wow!  either is great!  also, I love crushed pineapple, but tidbits might work better to keep it from being watery. I have excluded the coconut (not a fan! :))  and marshmallows , and its still wonderful!
