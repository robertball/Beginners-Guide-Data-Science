I love this recipe!  And, more importantly, so do my dogs! :)  I didn't have "corn flour", so I substituted with an extra cup of all-purpose flour.  It turned out fantastic.  I think my dogs like it better than my usual biscuit recipe!  Thanks!

**Warning** Don't make these while hungry. I had to keep telling myself they were for the puppy. Anna Belle is still sitting at my feet performing all her puppy tricks trying to get another one. I didn't know what corn flour was so I hit up everyone on the Recipe Exchange. Someone said it was probably Masa, someone else said sub rice flour, which I did. My dough was a bit wet, next time I'll throw in a bit more flour. My cookie cutter must be big, I got about 45 treats. This is a really fun recipe, my family is going to be so impressed. I will make more of these for friends who love dogs. Thanks again!

I first made them using dog bone cookie cutter but since they have peanut butter I switched to making them like people peanut butter cookies, smashing balls down with a fork.   Had a bit of trouble with them drying the first time but AR "Buzzers" suggested leaving in oven to dry out after bake time, worked great. Also, didn't melt the peanut butter the second time, just mixed the whole thing with pastry blender then hands.

Here is the only change I made after spending a l-o-n-g time with the cookie cutter (my dog cares less if they are cute or not) I pressed the dough out with my hand on a nonstick cutting board and used my pizza cutter to cut the dough into little squares. Then  used a spatula to transfer to the cookie sheet.  Since I tripled the recipe and was afraid the treats would mold, I tossed them in a ziplock bag and stored them in the freezer.

my dog loves these treats. i made smaller bite sized ones and got over 100 treats. I used 2 cups of all-purpose because i don't have any corn flour and i also used 1/4 cup of sausage fat and 1/3 cup of peanut butter. besides that i followed the recipe exactly. next time i will cut out the oil and use the sausage fat in its place and will increase the peanut butter to one cup. i fed one to my brother and he said it was a little bland but every time anyone goes near the container these are in my dog tries to get them. i am not concerned about them going moldy because i made them yesterday and over half are gone. If you put these in an air tight container these will last at least 2 weeks. (i used ziploc)

These treats are awesome! My dogs, a golden and a lab, love them. Thier tails were going a mile a minute! Like others, I didn't have any corn flour, so I used all-purpose flour. Since it is such a large batch, I put cookies in a plastic bags and gave them to other dogs in the neighborhood as holiday treats!

For those wondering about "corn flour" you're looking for what people in the US know as cornstarch. I didn't have any on hand so I cut the recipe in half and used equal parts cornmeal and flour. Subbed bacon fat for the oil and still used a whole egg because I'm lazy. :)

I saw such mixed reviews on how much water to add for dog biscuits so I used the pie crust method of adding water as you go and watching how the dough forms. I used about half the amount called for, but noticed I had to add a little more each time I re-rolled the scraps. I probably used about 3/4 the amount called for by the time I was done. Used a 2-inch star cutter and go about 45 cookies. My Schipp is going bonkers with excitement.

I'm shocked!  My pups love these!  I have one dog that will eat anything so thats not that big of a shocker.  But I also have a husky who, for some strange reason, doesn't do treats.  He just leaves them on the floor and the other dog takes them.  These however, he licks his chops for!  I think I will try bacon grease in place of pb next time!

My dog Rascal knows everytime I am making these for him. He lays in the kitchen waiting to make sure I got the batch right.    Because he is allergic to every kind of flour there is, I have to substitute all of the flour for masa and cornmeal, so I use equal parts of each. Due to this change the dough can be quite dry and crumbly, therefore I upped the peanut butter to 3/4 cup and the oil to 2/3 cup.

My dog loved them, I loved them, and I made a whole bunch, i bought a jar specially for them, but got mold by 3rd day, then I made a whole new batch again thinking they got mold from not shutting tight, and by 4th day had mold again. i need to find a way to preserved them longer.

simple and the pup loves it. I however hate cutting out cookies so I added an extra cup of liquid (used Turkey broth i/o water) and pipped them out of a frosting icing gadget. They are perfect little dog kisses.

These are so easy!  They roll out well, the dough is easy and the dogs love them. We use them for Christmas treats and use Christmas cutters.  And the dough was so manageable the kids loved helping.    We got just about 5 dozen from one batch. We used whole wheat flour, masa, and white liliy cornmeal mix.  Will definitely make again.

I made these once for my dog and once for myself. For me, I used wheat flour instead of corn flour and added about a tablespoon of honey. The honey made all the difference! These are yummy, simple treats.

Somehow following the recipe making shapes did not work out for me and I'm not sure how to describe it but they did this kind of peal apart thing. I was wanting something more hard and solid than they turned out but maybe I did something wrong. The dogs liked them alot anyhow though.

Dogs loved them!  Kids even want more...but I think it is just because they want to say they like the dog treats! LOL  Made a LOT of mini treats....found Noah's ark cookie cutters at Michael's. They are perfect for smaller dogs. My bigger dog just gets more of them.

My dogs liked these but I had to modify the recipe only because of what was on hand.  I did not have eggs so used coconut oil instead.  Added a tablespoon of ground flax and used coconut/peanut butter.  Did not have corn flour so used all purpose flour.  The dogs like them so am happy with this simple recipe -- and, it makes quite a few treats!

These were easy and fun to make. I did not have corn flour so I used 1.5 cups each of corn meal and regular flour. Success!! I also didn't cut them out. Made little balls and pressed them down with the back of a flat glass. Perfect!  Dogs love them!!

Grrreat says Chunk my Boxer mix. I made them with the peanut butter  and a combination of bacon fat with enough oil to make the 1/3 cup, and only cornmeal and regular flour. Since one of the reviewers complained about mold I froze them in ziptop bags in batches of 5 or 6 and they defrost over night. My daughter's dogs love them too, thanks Sparky.

Oh my word!  These are so easy to make...subbed wheat flour for the white and let them dry out in the oven for a bit.  My "baby" LOVES them.  I took the first batch out and she had a couple.  She watched the oven until the last batch was finished and she's always next to me anywhere else :)

These are great!!!  My dog and her friends rate this a 10 star.  They are schnoodles and shih-poos.  I think they really liked the chewy consistency of the cookies.  I made some in the shape of dog bones, and also used the lid of an oil container to make small bite-sized treats, because I always end up breaking other cookies in half.  This was a great dough to work with, and they held their shape perfectly when I rolled them and cut them out.  This recipe makes quite a bit of cookies, I halved it and it still filled my doggie cookie jar, and had plenty to give away.  Next time I will cut it in 1/4 because the cookies started going moldy after a week.  And  there is no way we could ever go through that many cookies.  Not sure if there is anyway to prevent this without adding any preservatives...  Maybe freezing batches? Regardless I love that I know what my dog is eating, I used organic/ sugar-free peanut butter (100% peanuts). Your dog will love this special treat!!

These were so much fun to make! I wanted to make my dog Bailey some homemade cookies & stumbled upon this recipe! She could hardly wait until I was finished with them! She watched me the entire time...and I even let her lick the spoon!! She devored it when I gave it to her! I like how I always have every ingredient on hand for when I'm in the mood to bake her some treats & I had lots of leftovers for her to enjoy throughout the week! Thanks for the great recipe!

My dog is eating these with great enthusiasm and they were easy to make. I did use bacon fat instead of oil because I don't keep oil on hand. I made tiny squares and little gingerbread man shape cookies because even thought I have over 100 cookie cutters I couldn't find any with a dog shape :-/ This recipe made over 100 treats for me.

I have made these for my dogs(shih tzus) and they love them, but after awhile they started scratching and licking there selves a lot, found out they have an allergy to the cornmeal,if you make these for your dog and they start that after awhile, it is probably the cornmeal, I am going to try using oatmeal instead of the cornmeal, I have heard cornmeal isn't good for dogs, some dogs have an allergy to cornmeal.

My dog Sparky loved these, along with all his kitty sisters. Was so much fun to make as we did it as a family. The amount of them is amazing. Way less than store bought and tastier too (from the dogs point of view).

I made these for my brother's dogs Christmas baskets, but of course I had to make enough for my 2 dogs! They LOVED them! They went absolutely insane as soon as they smelled the 1st ones! Next time I will try grating some carrot to put on the top. (I also used 2c flour and omitted the corn flour.)

I have a white doberman and a mix breed, they loved these, and so did their friends! I didnt have corn flour so I used 2 cups all purpose flour, I also used 1.5 cups of peanut butter because they loved it so much! It was so easy to make and so much cheeper than buying dog treats at the store! Thank you for sharing this wonderful treat!!!!!!

My dog loves peanut butter, so I was pretty sure she'd like these. I didn't have corn flour either so, like another reviewer, I subbed another cup of all purpose. Also, I have a larger dog, so I cut them larger into cute dog bone shapes. Oh boy did she go NUTS! She must think it's her birthday! Thanks for the recipe!

This is an easy and awesome recipe. My dogs love it, they will not get out of the kitchen just trying to get more treats. I did not have the corn flour so I just used another cup of flour, I also used sausage grease that I saw another reviewer used. I put a little honey in and I don't melt the peanut butter. I did not have any problem with mold and 5 dozen cookies lasted about 5 days. I am making more now and am going to add some cheddar cheese. Thank you so much for this recipe!

I liked that every dog that has tried these treats loved them, and they do smell great while cooking. I changed a couple things, I used 2 cups flour instead of cornmeal, corn flour is the same as corn starch, and finally I added a heaping Tbl of beef bouillon. Both my dogs loved them.

Good doggie treats! My dogs LOVE them! It took awhile to melt the peanut butter, and the plate got too hot to touch. I don't mind making it, and easy to make.

This is, by far, the best dog treat recipe I have ever made.  We have four dogs (two rescued and looking for a forever home) so decided to start making treats rather than buying them.  Have tried a few other recipes on this site but always come back to this one.  I double the recipe now.  The dogs wait by the oven for them to come out.  Best ever recipe.  Highly recommend.

Little Tory loved these treats.  She was so obedient with all commands because she knew she would get more of these treats.  I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour instead of the white & corn flour.  The recipe makes a generous amount of treats so I made ghosts and bat shapes to share with trick or treating doggies!  Changing the name to Tory's Treats!

I just made these and my doggies went crazy! I had to make a few changes: whole wheat flour and a few mashed up dog vitamins. They're really cute using cookie cutters. They would make a good addition to a "cookie plate" for the holidays, if your friends have dogs. Just make sure to label accordingly!

They must be good because our Molly gobbled them up.  I didn’t have corn flour so I used buckwheat flour.   Molly didn’t complain.

My dog is the pickiest dog in the world and she loves these. I'm making Christmas biscuit platters for the neighborhood dogs this year and these will be well loved.

Minor changes that I made: Like other reviewers, I used regular flour instead of corn starch and threw in a little extra when it came out too mushy. Rolled them into a ball and squished flat before baking.

These were sooo easy to make.  I also substituted an additional cup of flour for corn flour since that was the only ingredient I didn't have on hand.  It didn't take very long and it was FUN!  I'll roll them all a little thicker next time, maybe about 1/2 inch thick.  Only problem was my dog didn't go NUTS for them, but I'm not taking off a star since I didn't follow the recipe to a "T."  I'll make these again!

So easy to make. I made mine too thick and they were soft so I left them out to dry overnight and they were crisp enough for my dog. I had to make my husband peanut butter cookies after making these because he loved the way they smelled.

My dog is incredibly picky, but he is going absolutely crazy for these treats! It’s usually so difficult to find something he likes, so thank you very much for such an easy and apparently tasty recipe! The only changes I made were adding beef bouillon to the water and forming small balls from the dough rather than using cookie cutters.

Really easy, and according to our pup, delicious recipe. My 10 year old has taken to making a batch or two a month as needed. Love that it’s so few ingredients too. For a special treat my daughter put a simple frosting on a large treat. The frosting consisted of plain yogurt with a fresh strawberry blended into.

My dog loves these!  For added nutrition I substituted oat bran for the corn flour (corn starch) and used 1/4 cup peanut butter powder. I used corn starch to make the dough stiff.

Great consistency for rolling and cutting into cute little shapes for puppies, or massive K9’s like my pampered German Shepherd! She loves these cookies but only if they’re in cute shapes of course! She’s a little spoiled, spends about 2-3 minutes breaking it into little pieces to chew and savor. The recipe is simple and is cooked to perfection in 10 minutes in the convection oven. Thanks so much! Much cheaper than store bought! I only use regular flour too...3 cups total!

Super easy! My granddaughter and I made them. We got out the cookie cutters and made lots of different shapes. For the corn flour I used P.A.N. I subbed bacon grease for the vegetable oil. Doggies loved them!

After baking I shut the oven off and just left them in there to dry.  Then kept them in an open container so they didn't mold.  I got 128 treats.  I put them in a Ziploc bag and piped them on to the tray in about 1 inch lumps.

It made 4 full bags. To much for my dog. They went moldy before my dog could eat them.

I made them for my Husky, Golden retriever and  British bulldog and they all love them!

I didn't have cornflower so I add one more cup of  all purpose flour and instead of cornmeal I add one cup of oatmeal to it next Time I think I will add in banana to give it some sweetness too it.

All in all really good recipe will definitely make them again!

I am a dog walker and these treats help define me.  Dogs look forward to it and thus me, as I work it into our ritual:  giving  half the treat upon greeting and the rest after the walk.  The peanut butter and the corn meal are probably the taste stars of the recipe.  
Easy and dog-satisfying.

I always double the recipe for my 3 kids.  I double the peanut butter, add an extra egg for more protein and after rolling out the dough (I use parchment paper instead of greasing the pans) I take my pizza cutter and quickly cut squares before baking.  This is so much fast then cutting out shapes and your dogs only care about the taste anyway.

I also did not have corn flour so I substituted Wheat flour.  I also had some beef broth in the frig so I used that in place of the water.  Used tiny cookie cutters and cooked a little longer to make them crispy instead of soft. My Pomeranian loves these.

I've never baked for my dogs before, but I was intrigued when I saw this recipe. I made it and they LOVED it. I just made my second batch last night but made the cookie size smaller (I used a melon baller to scoop) so I could use these for training treats. My stubborn pug gleefully gives high fives. Thank you for the recipe.

Super easy to make.  I did use corn flower (corn masa flour) found it in the mexican food section of walmart as opposed to the baking section as well as all the other stated ingredients. However,  I ran out of creamy peanut butter so used about 1/4 cup of crunchy.  Super easy to roll out, I made mini stars about 1" across and moons and hearts about 2.5" long.  It all went super quick and easy.  Hope my friends new puppy loves them as I baked them for a "new puppy" gift.

I liked making these dog treats because they smelled yummy!  I was sure my picky dogs were in for a treat with these.  I can't even get them to eat store bought treats they are so picky.  But while they were cooking in the oven both dogs came running in to give me sweet puppy dog eyes : ))  When the treats were ready, they both were doing tricks for more!  I made them using 1 c. whole wheat flour, 1 c. rice flour & 1 c. oat flour, butter instead of oil and homemade chicken broth which I already had in the fridge.  I liked that it was easy to mix in my food processor & roll out was simple!!

My doggies were crazy about these treats! I love how they are soft, and are not too crispy- well, maybe that is the way I made them. My dogs eat pretty much anything and i think this is the first dog treat recipe from online i have ever done! So i rate Sparkybuddy56's recipe 5 stars for the best dog treats!

My dog Maggie loved these better than anything I  have seen her eat, but I don't buy the junk snacks that are not good  for them at store. They will last a long time as long as you refrigerate them. She doesn't mind if they are cold, sometimes I leave them out for 15 minutes or so before I give them to her, but I don't really think she cares. Great recipe and fairly simple to do.

All 3 loved these so much! They were very simple to make compared to a few other recipes. I kept finding ones that used rolled oats, which I didn't have at the time, so this was nice to find. I didn't have corn flour, so I used another cup of regular flour. They turned out really soft and chewy from what I can tell. The cookie cutter I had planned to use didn't work out so I made them into little balls. I had to keep reminding everyone that they were for the dogs! If you wanted to, I'm sure you could share it with your dog, but I added little biscuits on top just to seal the deal.

I had to add a bit more flour because they kept sticking to the wisk, and the heart cookie cutter I had planned to use didn't quite work out. So I made them into balls with a little Kong-filler biscuit on top. I planned to give these out to my friends with dogs, so I just wanted to be sure they knew they were dog treats! They turned out nice and chewy, from what I can tell. They made a lot - I had put 20 decent-sized balls on 2 trays and I still have a quart bag full of the rest of the batter. I also didn't have corn flour so I used and extra cup of normal flour.

These turned out beautifully!!  I chilled the dough for an hour before baking and returned the cut out treats to the fridge for 10 minutes before baking to help them hold their shape.  I didn't bother melting the peanut butter, I just threw all of the liquid ingredients into the stand mixer and slowly added all of the dry ingredients until they were mixed.  I used a small dog bone shaped cookie cutter on dough that was rolled to about 1/3" and got about 80 treats that I am storing in the freezer.  They smell amazing!

My dog thinks these are the best.  She loves them.  I roll out the dough and cut them into small squares about 1/2 inch x 1/2 inch.  Maybe not as nice a presentation, but they are the perfect size for a treat in my opinion as you can give her more or less depending on the circumstance.  So easy to make.  The last time I made them, I used rye flour instead of corn flour and they had same results (the dog loved them).
