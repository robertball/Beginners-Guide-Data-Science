A simple and tasty dish! I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and added a pkg. of frozen corn (as used in the traditional mexican recipes) and about 1/2 cup chopped green chile for zing. Also added 10 minutes to the cooking time and served it with baked chicken. A perfect low-cal but filling dish! Thanks for the recipe!

Loved, loved, loved this!! I didn't need the cheese -- I liked it as-is! I didn't use stewed tomatoes, but fresh tomatoes and added enough chicken broth to just cover the bottom of my 10-inch skillet (I will use just a little less next time, though). I also added frozen roasted corn (as corn was suggested by the top review). I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  This is now one of my favorite ways to eat zucchini! I will definitely make this again, I could eat it alone for dinner!

This simple dish is so delicious!! I followed the recipe as written except I used olive oil instead of vegetable. Such a wonderful blend of flavors from the slightly sweet stewed tomatoes to the tang of the mild cheddar. I needed a quick recipe to use some zucchini and this is it. Wonderful as a side or as a vegetarian main dish with crusty bread. My boyfriend who doesn't care for zucchini loved this, I was amazed. Thanks NghtSkkyyStarz for sharing this, I will definitely make this again :)

I too remember this dish!  If you look around many super markets now carry the small round calabacitas. You can fill them with the cheese and the "stew" the little squashes in the tomate/garlic/onion sauce with the lid on. A slow cooker works well.

I just made this dish for the first time this evening, and I have to say wow! I was hunting for a Mexican vegetable dish to go with my chicken enchiladas, and this definitely fit the bill! I grew up in Southern California, and love Mexican food, but had never had anything like this before. It was delicious and will be my go-to vegetable for serving with Mexican meals from now on! My opinion isn't the one that counts though. My husband invited a young family over on the spur of the moment. I was a little worried about serving them something I had never made before, but decided I couldn't go wrong with all the rave reviews. It was this or meatloaf, and chicken enchiladas just seem a better "company" meal to me. Anyway, I had everything just about ready when they got here, and I discovered that the husband is actually Mexican! I'm talking native Mexican! When he saw these calabacitas on the table, his eyes absolutely lit up! He said they looked exactly like the ones he makes. But the real compliment came when he tried them. He said this is authentic Mexican! It's one thing coming from a gringo like me. But you know it's good when a native Mexican tells you so! You can't get a much better compliment than that! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! It's definitely a keeper as written!

I think I accidentally cooked my zucchini a bit too long when I made this recipe, but it was still very tasty! I used one very large zucchini and about 1/4 of a mammoth zucchini...I wasn't quite sure what size of zucchini should have been used in the recipe! I also used my own frozen homegrown tomatoes instead of the canned ones, and adjusted the seasonings accordingly. I also used sharp cheddar cheese (family preference!) Thanks for sharing...this is a really simple, tasty, healthy, and comforting side dish!

Yum! I really, really enjoyed this. I scaled the recipe to "2", as I was the only one eating this. I didn't have stewed tomatoes, so I used a can of tomato sauce, and instead of cheddar cheese, I used shredded pepperjack. I also added a dash of cayenne pepper for added flavor (and left out the salt).

This was SO easy and delicious. Can be made without cheese to be a vegan/vegetarian friendly side dish, however the flavor isn't so bold without the cheese. Even re-heats great. Will make this again. HEALTHY TOO!

This was so easy and extremely good!  Because of the cheese I found I didn't find a need to add any salt.  Sometimes supplement two of the zucchini with two yellow squash for variety.

Love this simple dish, but tweaked it to make it "Italian."  Instead of Cheddar, I used fresh mozzarella and topped with grated Romano and fresh basil.  SOOOOO delish!  :-)

Excellent - we really enjoyed this more than we expected. Can't wait until friends give us more excess zucchini to make this again!!  Only one change, I added 1tsp oregano - sooo good!! And so easy - perfect combo!!

This was really good!  Even my daughter, who usually only eats zucchini if it's deep fried and dipped in ranch dressing or baked into sweet bread, loved this.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes, so I used petite diced tomatoes instead and I subbed queso cotija instead of cheddar cheese because that's what I had on hand.  This dish is going into our regular rotation during zucchini season!

SO delicious! I love garlic so I added more than called for, and added Frank's Red Hot sauce to taste to give it a kick.  The second time I made it, I used one whole red chile pepper, seeded and chopped in with the onions and garlic.

I thought this tasted pretty good. I did a 1/2 recipe of it to try it out. I followed everything except I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used the canned diced tomatoes and added a tad of small diced green peppers and onions and a couple pinches of sugar and it worked fine for stewed tomatoes. I sprinkled a little more cheese on my plate also. The recipe only makes about 1/2 servings suggested if this is used as a main dish, and I think it is hearty enough to be. The times on the directions are really good to. I will probably make this again in the future as it is quick to make, rather healthy, and it has the flavor without a bunch of spices. Edit note: I had stewed tomatoes and tried it again, just using a reduced fat cheddar blend and otherwise as written, and it is equally as good.

So good! Everyone in my family loved it. It serves great with brown rice and is great for getting rid of
giant zucchini. But next time I might use more tomato's. Over all a healthy, fast, and delicious meal!

I am not a veggie person but this was good. I used 2 yellow squash, 5 zucchini, some diced green peppers, a little oregano and other ingredients listed for recipe, I did use olive oil in place of veg. oil. Next time I will try adding a few more spices.

Four zucchinis is a LOT - it crowded my skillet, and there wasn't enough liquid to coat them. So, some of them came out tasting very dry and plan. Even adding too much salt didn't help to liven up the flavor. I also used sharp cheddar instead of mild - still, nothing.

As written, 3.5 stars. With minimal tweaking, 4.5. This is a really good side dish for Mexican main courses, like enchiladas, besides the classic rice and beans. The changes I made were adding some whole kernel corn, black pepper, and oregano to increase the flavor. I also used olive oil, quartered the zucchini lengthwise before slicing to create smaller pieces, and used a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed, but that didn't make much difference. Black beans would be another tasty addition.

Made this to go with Salsa Chicken.  This will stay in my recipe box.  Only thing that I did different was add cumin and a jalepeno from our garden.  One kid didn't care for it but still took more than a few bites...my other was happy to eat it.

Mmmm...one of my favorite vegie side dishes when serving Mexican food! I slice my zucchini about 1/2" thick, use butter, 1 clove of garlic, sprinkle a little seasoned salt & substitute 1 can of original Ro-Tel instead of plain stewed tomatoes. I'll add some whole kernal corn when I have it but tastes great either way. Super quick, super easy & muey delicioso!

I didnt need to use that much oil and I left out the salt completely. It is still absolutely fantastic and it will be dropping into my usual rotation because of the simplicity and a great way to use up the 4 most common ingredients at my house, onions, garlic, tomatoes and zucchini!

This is actually my recipe, on an old account. I really love it. Sometimes I add pepper to the mix. You can try it with stewed Mexican tomatoes as well, but regular is fine too.

Excellent, but quite spicy . . . check the tomatoes and green chiles before using if you don't like things too hot.

We really liked this. I added petite frozen sweet corn, like some other reviewers, and that was good, too. I'm sure I'll make this again. Thanks, NSS!

This was super simple and a great way to use of garden zucchini. I used diced tomatoes, as I had no stewed. Turned out great!!!

I, like many others used olive oil, and this recipe was delicious.  I grow Zucchini in my garden so I always look for new recipes with new ways to eat them.  This one is definitely a keeper.

Seems easy to add or subtract any of the ingredients. The zucchini doesn't take that long to cook. I used Rotel because I didn't have stewed tomatoes. I always used parmesan with steamed zucchini, but I really liked the shredded cheddar in this dish!

This dish is way to easy for how good it is.  I did use a fresh tomato and I use a smoked pepper jack cheese. My husband said I knocked it out of the ballpark. Thanks for sharing!

OK, I made alterations to this but it doesn't diminish the deliciousness and easiness of the base recipe. I added a little shredded chicken, a little chicken stock, corn, instant rice, and stewed tomatoes (2 cans) that were spiced up with mild green chilis -- these are common in the supermarket. As a main dish, a party dish, a side dish, whatever, it was so good. Thanks for giving me the base recipe to work with -- awesome!

This turns out so much better than it sounds.  Great side dish to Mexican fare or Tex-Mex!  Make ahead tip: I made this and then turned the stove off and let it sit in the pot for about an hour.  10 minutes before ready to serve, I transferred veggies to a baking dish, topped with cheese, covered with foil and placed in oven for a few minutes .  Also used Mexican-style stewed tomatoes - lovely!

Made this as a side dish with the Spicy Turkey Burgers recipe. We ate the burgers bunless and these went very well. Much better than fries and easier too! Me and the hubby enjoyed it.

I grew up with my grandmother making this dish!  We brown cubed pork steak with the onion and garlic and use fresh tomatoes as opposed to stewed (when in season).  A wonderful meal!

This is a very good, quick recipe for a side dish, or to serve over rice, couscous or quinoa.  The title has a typo.  It should be "Calabacitas Guisadas".

Really good!  I made mine without the cheese.  It has a wonderful taste without it, so I left it off.  Will make again!!  Would be good with chicken as main course.

Healthy and delicious. Tomato and zucchini make a great combination together. I omitted the cheese to make it a bit healthier and it was delicious. I will definately make again.

I made this as stated, then again with summer squash instead of zucchini, omitting the cheese and adding a chopped jalapeno.  Delicious every time, with or without the cheese!  For lunch I had leftovers with a half cup of brown rice for a pretty filling and healthy meal!  Thanks for sharing - I'll definitely add this one to my zucchini - and summer squash - rotation! :)

This was tasty! And healthy too! I had tomatoes from my garden so I stewed them up with a little salt & sugar instead of using canned tomatoes. I used a lot less cheese than called for, and it tasted great!

I really liked this recipe - I made a few modifications though.  I used fire roasted, diced adobe flavored tomatoes - so it added some nice kick and flavor and had to cooke the zucchini about twice as long as advertised.  Came out wonderfully

This was such a nice change from the zucchini I normally make.  My hubby really like this.  Very low carb.. I served this with Salsa Chicken from this site for a very low carb dinner.  I will be making this more often as my son who does not really like zucchini loved this one.

I wasn't happy with this one at first, then I put it in the oven on broil so that the cheese could get brown on top and it was pretty good that way! I'll try it again but next time I'll add more spice, maybe some cumin, and green chilis, then it should be delicious!

I used this recipe as a guide. Instead of stewed tomatoes I used fresh tomatoes from our garden and chicken broth for the liquid. I added some frozen corn and diced green chilies during the onion cooking step. Next time I think I will brown the onions to give the dish a little more depth. Thank you for posting this recipe!

I used a scallion instead of an onion so not that big of a change, but my wife & I prefer the scallion taste. I sliced the zucchini lengthwise then again in 1/4" strips lengthwise and served in long, oval, individual dishes. Very nice presentation and tastes great!

I fixed this because it was gluten free and low carb. I fixed this exactly as written except for using olive oil. This was a simple quick recipe that came out wonderful!  My husband thought it was filling and tasty. He didn't even notice I served this as a vegetarian meal. It was that good! The sweet, salty, and acidic flavors came together well.  Thanks NghtSkkyyStarz for sharing. This is going on my rotation.

Oh man, this is some seriously good stuff.  Tasty, Healthy, Delishous and Easy.  3 large zucchini are plenty, but the flavor and eye appeal is really enhanced by adding a cup of frozen corn.   I doubled the garlic, onion and the stewed tomatoes.  Use a flavored canned stewed tomato choice  (Italian, garlic, etc).  Will definitely make again.    Will try adding a poblano pepper seeded and diced next time.   Try not to overcook the squash so it keeps a little crispness to it.  Flavor improves overnight and is also delicious cold.  Great for an easy, cold lunch to take to work, or heat for dinner and add smoked sausage  or chorizo.

It was great!  I added a bit more oil.  I used olive oil.  I used Nature's Seasoning instead of plain salt and pepper.  I also used fresh tomatoes since I have somany from our garden.  I used minced garlic instead of fresh.  All in all, it is a great, easy dish with favorite fresh vegetables.

An excellent side dish!  I substituted a half jar of marinara for the stewed tomatoes just to use it up and to give it an Italian spin for our French bread pizzas.  I omitted the cheddar cheese - it was delicious without it.

Pretty good! While I prefer my zucchini crisp-tender, I enjoyed this quite a bit. It took me a couple of bites to get past the texture, but the flavor was so good I quickly adjusted. :) Since I was only serving two adults, I halved everything (except the tomatoes). I used an entire can of tomatoes, but I partially drained them. I also used the largest zucchini I could find. All in all, I enjoyed this, but do think this would be a lot better if the zucchini were sauteed rather than steamed. Thanks for sharing your recipe, EnjoyMyRecipe! :-)
