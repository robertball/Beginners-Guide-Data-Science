Excellent Texture!  Scones have a slight bitter taste.  I cooked them at 450 (temperature was not listed) and they were still not brown after 6 min, but the sweet lemon cream (which is delicious) covered the top anyway.

I followed the receipe; although I had my doubts about 3 tablespoons of baking powder- try 3 teaspoons to avoid the bitter taste (same as Grace's comment). I tried 350 degrees and thought they would never brown. The texture was good. The sweet cream was perfect.
