Deeeelicious! I only sauteed the white parts of the green onion, mixing the rest in at the end to keep them green, then garnished with more.  Rather than garlic powder, I tossed a few good sized cloves of garlic in the water to cook with the potatoes.  I used probably half again as much horseradish as was called for, and extra butter as well. The Parmesan cheese was a nice touch and is so subtle that my Parmesan cheese hating hubby didn't even notice it. We really enjoyed this and it complemented the roast beef I served it with perfectly.

Interesting combination of flavors. I just made a few minor adjustments to this recipe. Omitted garlic salt and used one fresh garlic clove. I also did not saute' the green onions because I don't really care for them cooked. Also, I like my mashed potatoes very creamy, so I added more milk than indicated. This would be an easy recipe to prepare low fat or even vegan with substitutions.  If you are a fan of horseradish and want to try something a little different, this is the recipe for you! Thanks for sharing...

It tasted okey, but for the work I felt it was eisier just to add a packet of ranch seasonings and tastier as well.

This was really good!  The only thing I did differently was use 2 garlic cloves instead of powder, and cook them in the butter a few minutes before adding the green onions.  I used red potatoes (a few extra since they were smaller) and skim milk.  I wouldn't add all the milk first like the recipe states; I just splashed some in until it was the right consistency and it wasn't nearly 1/2 cup, probably not even half that.  Great with Slow Cooker Cranberry Roast from this site.

There were too many flavours competing in this dish, in my opinion. Any one or two of the flavourings would be great in mashed potaties, but all of them together were not a big hit in our house. It was interesting to try, though. Thanks!

If you are looking for an alternative to bland regular mashed potatoes...look no further!  These are sooooo impressive, like something from a gourmet restraunt.  I used fresh garlic cloves instead of garlic powder and added a dash of white pepper.

I loved these mashed potatoes.  Mashed potatoes are my favorite food, so I was a little hesitant to try something different from the old standard I'm used to, but these were fantastic.  The horseradish really doesn't end up tasting like horseradish, and with such a small amount, it doesn't make the potatoes "spicy" or anything.  It's just a really good flavor.  I didn't have green onions, so I used regular white onion, chopped.  I will try the green onions next time, though.  Highly recommended.

These were great potatoes to serve with the roast beef recipe from this site. I only used 1/2 tablespoon of horseradish and I thought it was plenty. Very tasty!

AMAZING! I found I needed to double the amount of potatoes for the other ingredients. Instead of using 1/2 cup of milk I used 1/4 cup milk, 1/4 cup sour cream. It made it even creamier and delicious!

5 star all the way. I added a bit more butter in the end but that was my only change. LOVED the extra depth and flavor the horseradish added.

I didn't have horseradish or garlic powder. I used extra parmesan, extra green onions, onion powder and soy milk.  I think they could have used the horseradish, but a little extra salt helped.

I made one change, leave out the milk and use heavy cream instead, it makes a big difference.

The horseradish in this recipe intrigued me, so I decided to give it a try.  I made half the recipe as written, sautéing only the white portion of the green onions and folding in the green portion at the end.  These were good, but they didn’t have the zing I was hoping for.  I think I’ll stick to my standard mashed potatoes, but this was fun to try.

These are some "zippy" mashed potatoes!! My husband and I really liked them! They were easy to prepare. I cut back just a little on the onion and used creamy horseradish. Served with bbq ribs and butter beans fresh tomatoes and peach pie. Would make these again for sure.

Nice change of pace!  I stirred in about 1/2 cup chopped chives after mashing the potatoes instead of cooking the green onions.

These potatoes were great.  Instead of the garlic powder I put a couple of garlic cloves in with the boiling potatoes then just mashed it all together.  I didn't have Parmesan so I added cheddar and monterey jack.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made for thanksgiving.  My husband really liked because they had a little zing to them and he likes to try different things.  The kids took one taste and that was it. They prefer good old fashioned mashed potatoes.  Thanks

These were delicious!  I omitted the Parmesan and used 2 cloves of mined garlic instead of the garlic powder.   I only cooked the white part of the green onion, and left the green part uncooked.  I usually put french onion chip dip in my mashed potatoes, which adds a ton of calories and fat.  Using garlic, green onion, and horseradish is a much healthier way to add flavor to mashed potatoes!

I liked this recipe but my husband and son didn't care for it. If you are not a BIG fan of horseradish, I suggest using a lot less than called for in this recipe. It was very overpowering!
