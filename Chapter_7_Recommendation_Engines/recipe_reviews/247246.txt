This is a tasty and refreshing salad - and very attractive! As written it was not sufficiently spicy for my taste. I used black pepper instead of salt, added toasted sesame seeds, and used a full teaspoon of the crushed red pepper in the sauce. I tossed grilled chicken breast strips with the vegetables, then sprinkled more red pepper flakes on top before serving. Perfect!

Saw this featured in this month's Allrecipes magazine and decided to try the recipe.  It was so simple with a short ingredient list, and easy to make, yet very flavorful.  Love all the cilantro!  The red pepper flakes definitely give it a nice kick. (To save a step I did not salt the English cucumber as instructed. I didn't find the small mount of water from the cucumber after it had been seeded to be a problem.)

This was delicious. Very fresh and bright taste from the cilantro. I didn't have green peppers but used a trio of smaller red, orange, and yellow pepper.  I served it with grilled salmon

7.20.18... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/247246/tiger-salad/ ... 'Not much to this tastewise.  'Only change was 1c cilantro, not 2.  Two cups of cilantro is a lotta cilantro vs the amount of other ingredients.   I'll let it sit & try again later ... Later:  Better, but still three stars.

I had no idea what to do with a cucumber, a pepper, green onions, and cilantro.  Put into this great ingredient search and WOW.  This is tasty as heck.  Make sure you have toasted sesame on hand...that really makes it.  I used a whole English cucumber and an orange pepper because that's all I had.  I love this salad.

I usually make just a cucumber salad using similar ingredients. Adding onions and peppers and scallions was great. Really nice recipe.

It is a very good salad as is but with some changes... WOW!!  I cut the cilantro to about 1/2 cup, added Garlic, Cumin, minced onion, 1 tsp agave nectar and a dash or two of Cayenne pepper instead of the flakes.    SOOO VERY GOOD!!  Took it to a potluck and had several ask for the recipe!

Made this at Christmas -- the colors were perfect. My family raved about the delicious, fresh taste. Looks like this will be the newest addition to the traditional menu and a permanent rotation. Excellent!

Excellent!  We've made this 2 times in the past week.  Made this exactly as written and tossed in a few toasted sesame seeds before serving.

I will be making this again and again! The ingredients are simple but so tasty. The only thing I adapted was that I just julienned my English cucumber  (not enough seeds to worry with, and I was too lazy to soak it in salt), and I used regular sesame oil instead of the expensive toasted sesame oil because it's what I had on hand. I also reduced the cilantro. Minor changes, but this was delicious and made a beautiful side dish. My cucumbers started wilting by the end of the meal, so I wouldn't combine all the ingredients too far in advance,  a couple of hours at the most.

Healthy, easy, fresh! Saw this in the AllRecipes magazine and made it substituting red wine vinegar for rice vinegar, added white sesame seeds, and reduced the cilantro (2 cups is a LOT!). This was great! We'll make it again as we always keep these fresh ingredients on hand. This is a perfect summer salad with some attitude!
