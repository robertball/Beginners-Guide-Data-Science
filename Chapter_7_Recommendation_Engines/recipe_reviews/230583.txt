One bad burger is correct. I would suggest using a whole onion to make sure there is enough topping for four burgers. My husband and son kept raving about how good they were. The only thing I didn't have and this is a biggie, and my husband's fault, was the bacon. He said we had some...which we did but it was frozen solid, so I had to make without it. Like the previous review, just the burger alone is great, so even without the bacon tasted great. Thanks SarahChristine, we will make these again...with bacon of course. :-P

We LOVED these! The burger, itself was so moist and flavorful that it almost didn't need anything else. Combined w/ the sweet mushrooms and onions (which I added a bit of salt and pepper to), and the salty bacon, this was a winning combination! I love guacamole, but I really could've left it out...it didn't hurt it at all, but I don't really think that it added anything special. I mixed up my burgers and shaped them the night before to allow the flavors to blend. I will def be making these again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

excellent hamburgers even without the sugar, bacon and cheese.  I used gluten free bread crumbs and it made absolutely no difference in the taste.  even those on a special diet can enjoy these.

This has such great flavor and the toppings magnificent, but Hubs and I both agree it would be much better prepared as meatloaf and then proceeding with the recipe and slicing it for sandwiches. I'd even go one step further and say it would be better without the dang bread crumbs but then it may not hold together well, given all the other liquid ingredients which the bread crumbs of course would absorb. As it was, Hubs found it a challenge to keep these from falling apart as he was grilling them.  Also, adding the sugar to the onion-mushroom mixture just didn't appeal to me. I left it out, and the recipe didn't seem to suffer for it.  Find a way to lose or reduce the bread crumbs without the mixture becoming too wet and you'll have yourself a 5-star burger (not meatloaf).

An odd combination, but it works!  I used venison burger and it turned out very well.  The meat was still a little dry, but the egg and cracker crumbs helped pull it together into a patty that could be grilled.  With all of the different flavors from the steak sauce and horseradish, to the pepper jack cheese, sweet caramelized onions, bacon, and guacamole, one would never know that I used venison.    As a grilling note, you really need to use cooking oil on the grate or the burgers will stick.

Go ahead and double the recipe because everyone wanted two. These were fantastic! I will be saving this recipe. I added the mushroom and onion mix to the ground beef and cooked it that way. I also didn't have bacon or steak sauce. They stayed juicy. PS DONT skip the guacamole! I can see how you can leave it out if you're also topping with mushrooms and onions, but our's were IN the burger and the guacamole was fantastic on top. Then again, we live in Arizona and make it fresh daily, so our guac is probably better out here.

I'm so sorry to give this a low rating.  Made this over the weekend, followed the recipe exactly.  We both didn't care for it, it was like the burger was too soft and meatloaf like instead of burger like.  Thanks for sharing, it was worth a try!

Very Yummy, I used more onions for the burger.  I also use this recipe to make the moistest meatloaf ever and to make stuffed peppers, OMG they were good.

WoW! These were delicious & just like you said, >>> you really did "create an explosion of flavor in every bite."  I used homemade guacamole but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I cooked the burgers on medium low for 4 minutes per side. AWESOME burger & definitely going into my recipe box.  Thanks for sharing SC!

This is the first review I have ever written, because the burgers are that good!!  I usually don't care for burgers but I had organic ground beef and avocados to use up.  Just so happened I had mushrooms too!  I was a little skeptical about the sugar in the mushrooms and blending of flavors, but it was actually really good.  The only thing I did not have is bacon, but it made no difference to me.  I also added a little hot sauce to the burgers.  This will be my go to burger recipe, thanks!!

Moist, flavorful and not heavy. I used panko bread crumbs and it worked great. Use a whole onion rather than a half. I suggest you prepare the regular burger fixings like lettuce, tomato etc. to go along with it. My kids said this was a "make again"! 

"make again" with a few modifications = 4 stars!
