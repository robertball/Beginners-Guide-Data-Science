WOW...this is wonderful! I am only rating on the coffee ice cream, as I did not add the doughnuts, but I did add chopped up oreos. This has fantastic flavor and is PERFECT! I will definately make this ice cream over and over. We really can't get enough of it...so creamy and delicious! Thanks for sharing. :)

The flavor is great, but the doughnut pieces froze solid like ice cubes.  I might try it next time without soaking the doughnuts in coffee.

The best! Easy recipe with the greatest flavor. We used krispy kreme glazed and cut them into smaller pieces than called for. Super. Thanks Stacey.

I used half n half instead of milk which made it creamier. Didn't soak the donuts and they were PERFECT - not at all icy. The coffee flavor wasn't very strong - I think it needs about a cup and a half.

The coffee based ice cream is fabulous! I used about 1/2 cup of Kahlua flavored coffee in the ice cream. I didn't soak the donuts (two glazed and one crueller) in the coffee. Just folded them in at the end. It took my ice cream several minutes (30 or so) in the ice cream maker to actually freeze to decent consistency. Usually it makes ice cream in about 20 minutes, but this took longer. I'd love to put a powdered sugar glaze swirl through the ice cream!

I was a little disappointed in this recipe. With the high star-rating, I expected something great. I would describe it in actuality as a very good coffee ice cream with unpleasant chunks of doughnuts. I like texture to my ice cream, but this just didn't work for me.

The base of this ice cream is great.  I substitued the doughnuts with heath bar pieces and only used 1/2 cup of coffee in the icecream.

I had no donuts, so I made Doughnut Muffins, and glazed those. Then once they were completely cooled, I cut them in half and used that. fantastic!!:)
