We loved this macaroni salad, but I did use slightly less sugar (3 tbsp) than called for and added a bit of onion into the mix. I mistakenly boiled a full 16oz. box of macaroni but there was plenty of dressing for the full amount. It is very tasty Lorilynn, thanks for sharing!

I have made this salad twice now in a week and both times I halved the recipe and added about 3 three green onions and half a small red pepper finely diced.  I weighed the dry macaroni to make sure I cooked 6 ounces. The first time I made it I added the dressing while the macaroni was still warm and it soaked up the dressing making the salad too dry.  The second time I let the macaroni cool completely and the end result was a much moister salad.  DH and I have both thoroughly enjoyed this salad and I will be making it again.  I think the peas make the salad.  BTW for the peas I just dump the frozen peas in the colander when I start cooking the pasta and then dump the cooked pasta and water on top of the peas.  That makes the peas the perfect texture for us.  Thanks!

great dressing for this mac and pea salad!!  Thou I didn't use the low fat mayo ... used reg. Hellmans.

I added a few extras ... chopped roasted red pepper, chopped sun dried tomatoes, sliced black olives, chopped green onions and sunflower seeds.

The dressing combined well with all the added stuff!

Was looking for the "perfect" dressing for a mac salad and this is it!!!!

Made as written very good. To elevate it a bit my husband added some white pepper and lemon pepper seasoning. Will definitely make again. Thanks.

Recipe Group Selection:  05, January 2013 ~ I made this macaroni salad, knowing that it would be tough to receive a 5-star rating from my family.  Macaroni salad is the one item that I make that is my DH “favorite” thing I make.  That being said, he and my son did enjoy this recipe.  I knew I would enjoy it and really liked the addition of peas in this salad.  My changes were the pasta choice and the addition of diced onion.  I had a bag of beer stein pasta shapes to use up and we like the taste of onion with pasta.  This is a very good recipe and I wouldn’t hesitate to make it again.  For me, the peas added a lot to this salad.  Thanks Lorilynn for sharing your recipe.  I was excited to see your recipe become our choice for this week’s Recipe Group selection.  I served this with a ’Grilled Pastrami and Swiss Sandwich’, a personal recipe from AR.  We had a great dinner!

Great recipe! Without the sugar.  Use Miracle Whip, which is sweeter than mayo, instead of added sugar.

I halved the recipe and added 2 green onions. There was plenty of dressing to cover the macaroni and still was enough 2 hours later when I stirred it up and ate it.  This is a delicious macaroni salad, and I will definitely use this recipe again.

Made for Recipe Group. I had to make a few subs, regular mayo and celery flakes, but still had a great taste. I do miss onions in it though and may add some in since I don't have the crunch from the celery. Remembered after I didn't whisk the dressing together that I was supposed to and get sugar dissolved. I really don't think it needs it anyway. Thanks for the recipe!

3.15.18  I make macaroni salad often (quick, easy, fast).  The addition of the peas and the celery seed were new to me, and I liked both of them in this recipe.  I did add a little chopped onion and some red bell pepper for a pop of color.  This had just a touch of sweetness, but not too much.  We enjoyed this recipe with some sloppy joes and baked beans.

I made this for the recipe group selection of the week. I used the whole 16oz. box of spiral noodles, added in red bell pepper and green onions. I just added the sugar till it reached my sweet preference, just under the 1/4 cup. A very good macaroni salad, one of my favorites.

This one also has way too much sugar in it. Omit and then just add to taste.

For an even lower fat dressing, I substitute HALF the mayo with 2% plain yogurt.  If I'm thinking ahead, I drain the yogurt through cheesecloth in the fridge for an hour or so, which gives it a texture more like sour cream.  (Then use the yogurt whey in my next batch of bread.)

Made this for Recipe Group...This was good!Hubby wasn't a fan of the peas in this, but I thought they were ok and the kids liked it so...I did add some onion to the mix, and I was glad I did for the extra flavor and crunch, and reduced the sugar for personal preference. This was nice to try for something different, and I would make it again! Thanks for sharing. :)
