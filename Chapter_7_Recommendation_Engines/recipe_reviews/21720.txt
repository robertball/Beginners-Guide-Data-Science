I updated this version by using turkey sausage, adding extra sage and thyme. I used skim evap milk in place of sweetened condensed and it came out great!! Lower cals and less sugar/carbs

I grew up in scrapple country, so when I saw a review of this I HAD to try it.  It's a pretty good approximation of scrapple, although it is not as spicy and has a sweetness to it that I've never tasted in scrapple.  We never put syrup on our scrapple--only ketchup.

I have been making a more traditional scrapple for years.  My recipe was past down from generations of farm families West of the Missiouri River (KS).  Tips:  Use several pounds of fresh pork neck bones slow cooked down in medium size crock pot till meat falls from the bone.  SAVE the broth!  Use 1/2 broth, 1/2 EVAPORATED milk.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Then to break tradition try some WHITE corn meal instead of yellow.  Slice THIN (1/8 to 1/4 in.) with razor sharp slicing knife and fry in very small amount of extra virgin olive oil till well browned or desired doneness is achieved. YUM YUM!!

Hi All, thanks for trying this recipe. The original did call for evaporated rather than condensed milk, at the time of publication I miseed the typo, and imagine this would be fearsome sweet if made with the sweetened milk and then served with extra syrup.

I know scrapple and this is horrible.  Scrapple should not be sweet and greasy.

My mom routinely made this for my dad serving it with maple syrup.  She called it ponhorse, but I think that came from my dad's family in tennessee.  With both gone now I had thought it lost.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

Tried this recipe using venison sausage.  Great!  I am originally from Pennsylvania and ate scrapple many times as a kid.  Recipe is close to original scrapple.  It is sweet so I did not need to pour syrup on it.  Great Recipe!  Husband said it is a keeper!

Being from Texas, We had no idea what Scrapple was suppose to taste like but had seen it on a cooking show and so we thought why not give it a try.  We loved it.  Especially the sweetness from the condensed milk with the other flavors. I sliced it fairly thin and we preferred it fried crispy like bacon.

I had never heard of scrapple until I started spending (way too much) time on this website! I found the recipe and was intrigued, so I gave it a shot--I love it! Picky boyfriend and my dad did not care for it at all--More for me!

I am sure this is a great recipe for this food item but it is not an item we will ever make again.  It is just not a dish our buds yearn for.  If you didn't grow up with this, as others have indicated, you probably won't enjoy it as much as folks who can anticipate the flavor.

My husband is from the foothills of North Carolina and has been dying to eat scrapple or liver mush.  This recipe was very close to what he was use to.  He enjoyed it a lot. The sweet taste was a new twist on an old favorite.  Will be serving this again.

This was interesting. I was afraid to tackle a more traditional (complicated) recipe for scrapple and thought to try this, simple recipe.  It's not bad at all, but I was a little disappointed in the sweetness of it.  Next time, I will try a recipe that calls for broth instead of sweetened, condensed milk.

My ancestors on my mothers side were Pennsylvania Dutch and I grew up with scrapple every time we butchered a hog.  This is not really what I remember.  Ours used the scrap meat (head meat, tail, hocks, etc) as stated but wasn't spiced like the sausage makes this.  We ate it fried with plenty of corn syrup, dark if I was lucky.

This was a nice trip down memory lane but I still miss the original.

Followed the recipe to the T and it was delicious! ! Make sure you drain and rinse the sausage after cooking it to get rid of the grease/fat. Sweet and savory

This is a good alternative to buying a whole loaf of scrapple since I'm the only one who likes it. It isn't the exact taste but good enough.
Next time I'll whiz it in a blender before packing it into a pan.
I cut it way down to 2 servings sizes.

Took the recipe creator's most recent advice and used evap milk instead of sweetened condensed.  This tastes okay, not terrible by any means, but not what consider to be traditional scrapple.

I grew up South of Baltimore & you could buy Scrapple in any grocery store. Try frying it until well brown eat it with eggs and Grape jelly on it. I will work on this recipe until I get the taste I want.

Coming from Maryland, I've enjoyed scrapple for many years, but I've never been served any that's sweet. The prep time was was great compared to some more traditional methods, but the sweetened condensed milk was a bad idea. I'll make this recipe again, but I'll try regular condensed milk or broth instead.

Too sweet, too much sausage.  I study a simple mush recipe and modify it to get a scrapple I am pleased with.
