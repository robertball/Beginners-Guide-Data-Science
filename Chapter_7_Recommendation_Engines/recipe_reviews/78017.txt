Maybe I just don't like holiday sauce, but this was too tart for me.  I made it for Christmas dinner and I noticed it was left on many people's plates.  I don't think I'll make this again unless I want to top some vanilla ice cream with it.  It smelled fantastic but it just didn't taste very good.

I made this for Christmas and everyone loved it..even my husband who hates cranberries.  Very easy and you can make while the turkey is resting.
