There is a lot of room for improvisation with this very basic casserole.  With that said, I found the recipe as written to be lacking in not only additional simple ingredients, but the amounts as well.  5 ounces of evaporated milk is not enough to result in a creamy consistency.  Use a whole 12 oz can.  Feel free to add other veggies and herbs.  I added chopped celery and mushrooms, as well as fresh crushed garlic.  Hubs liked it and came back for seconds.  For a busy family that doesn't really "sit down" to eat and wants something to fill the hole, this will work.  For me, I'll pass.

Very good and easy to make with a lot of common things you'd have on hand in your pantry! I found it by using the ingredient search feature on All Recipes. I recommend using LOW SODIUM broth like I did, as it was salty enough using the low sodium variety. I might even dilute it down the next time with 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup of low sodium chicken broth. This was really good. I suggest a dash of pepper on the chicken mixture before you top it with stuffing mixture. Thanks Stacy, this will be a keeper! :)

This was really good! My hubby and I both said it was a keeper, the kids thought it was ok but they are not stuffing fans the way hubby and I are.  I found the recipe to be pretty easy. 

I admit I made some adjustments due to having read a few recipes like this and our own tastes. 

I had made my own stuffing mix and seasoning blend. I used cream of chicken because it is what I had. (I know the celery would have been great too) I did not have evaporated milk so I subbed sour cream. I also added about 1/2 cup shredded cheddar to the creamy mix. I think it added a nice touch!

If you do not like this recipe as written try adding some herbs to your liking and some cheese.

I made this tonight and it was a success! I followed the directions with the exception of I used a small amount of heavy whipping cream with the soup chicken mixture. I also used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken. I did cover the dish with aluminum foil the last 10 mins of baking and it turned out great.

I thought this was delicious with an addition of frozen corn,peas and green beans. I used a generic corn bread stuffing mix,and I didn't have canned milk,so added fresh. Before I put the casserole in the oven I sprinkled some French fried onions. Yummy

I made it with chicken as called for and then again with pork chops and they were both great. Very tender meat!

I thought it was very yummy and so did my family. I didn't have cream of celery soup so I substituted cream of chicken and added chopped celery. I will definitely make this again. The only other thing I would change is that it was kind of salty, so reduced sodium stuffing, cream soup, broth or all three.

I used left over rotisserie chicken with this.  This was really easy and it was a hit. My husband suggested the next time we have it that we serve cranberry sauce with it.

A great comfort food.  I kicked up the spices by added some garlic and herb, and paprika to the chicken while tossing it with the saut√©ed onions.

I was concerned the standard recipe would be a bit bland for my family so I added white pepper and garlic powder.  Additionally, I had herb stuffing left from the holidays and used it instead of cornbread stuffing.  The additional seasoning and herb stuffing made this very flavorful!  My daughter told me to "make this again"...which is a testament.

This turned out very well and quite delicious.  I love the fact that it is a good stand alone recipe but also gives room to add other ingredients.

Great basic recipe that's easy to add to.  The first time I made it, I mixed in some steamed broccoli from my freezer right before I put the stuffing over it.  The second time, I did broccoli and mushrooms and it didn't turn out dry at all.  You could really add anything you wanted to make it more like a meal in itself.  1/4 cup of melted butter seemed excessive for the broth/butter mixture so I cut down to about 2 1/2 tbsp.  Still turned out great!  Husband loved it!
