These get 5 stars after making some modifications. First, I increased the spices - didn't measure but I'll guess it was double the cinnamon + some ginger, nutmeg, and a tiny bit of cloves. Second, I used 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour. Third, I used a little extra pumpkin and a little less oil (plus the oil I used was extra virgin olive oil). Fourth, I cut back on the sugar by about 1/3 of a cup or maybe a bit more.  Finally, I added in a handful of walnuts, a handful of raisins, & a handful of chocolate chips. These changes made for a perfectly spiced, moist, very pumpkiny, not too sweet, healthier version of the posted recipe. They were really delicious!

This was a good basic recipe. I usually like the gooey, moist pumpkin cookies and these ones were a little more cake-like and dry when I cooked them for 11 minutes. I tried taking them out at 9 minutes and that resulted in a really yummy, gooey cookie though I agree they did taste better with nuts. **Additional note. i put the batch of cookies in a ziplock bag and the next day they tasted SO MUCH better and were so much more moist!

these are THE best pumpkin chocolate cookies I have ever had!  My few changes were: 1/2 semi-sweet and 1/2 milk chocolate chips.  1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar.  And a little extra pumpkin.  They turned out great!

I have almost the exact same recipe that my grandma gave me.  There are only a couple changes: Add 4 tsp. baking powder, use only 1 tsp. vanilla and only 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips.  Then, bake at 375 for 8-9 minutes.  They turn out wonderful and moist every time!

This is a great basic recipe.  I'm a health nut so I replaced half the all-purpose flour with whole wheat pastry flour.  I added 1 tsp. powdered ginger, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/4 tsp. cloves to solve the "kind of bland" problem noted in other reviews.  I did reduce the pumpkin by 1-1/2 oz. because I was using a large can and needed the other half for pumpkin pie.  I was able to cut the oil back to 3/4 of a cup as well.  Everything still worked.  If you replace the milk called for with 1/3 of a cup you can make muffins or pumpkin bread. (I spooned half the cookie batter as is into muffin tins and it worked but the batter was just a little too stiff.) I wouldn't waste my money on the store-bought cookies after trying these.

These cookies were a big hit.  I used pecans instead of walnuts, 1 tsp of cinnamon,  & 1 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  My only beef is that I felt there were too many chocolate chips, the chocolate really overpowered the pumpkin flavor (I did use a fresh pumpkin instead of canned - maybe that had something to do with it??)  Other than that they tasted pretty yummy.  Next time I will probably use 1 instead of 2 cups of chocolate chips and I will throw in 1/4 tsp of ginger to give it a kick.

I love these- perfect recipe for using up the second half of a large can of pumpkin.  Not only are they dairy free (I have an child allergic to milk) but they taste JUST like the cookies we love from our local grocery store (Fred Meyer).  Easy and quick to make, you don't have to wait for the butter to soften, because there isn't any!  A hit in our house with adults and children alike.

These cookies were good, but the dough seemed too runny when I went to put them in the oven, so I added some flour, which I think was a mistake, as they tasted a little too floury. Just chilling the dough probably would've done the trick. I also added extra cinnamon but some nutmeg or allspice might have added a little kick. Will try them again, but with less oil, no extra flour, and perhaps some nuts.

These pumpkin cookies were a HUGE HIT! I've had neighbors knocking on my door all day asking for just one more! The only thing that I changed from the recipe was that I added more cinnamon, some nutmeg, and some pumpkin pie spice to taste. Also, I left out the walnuts. I will definitely be making these again!!!!

Five stars because the texture is great, and they could not be easier to make! My seven year old twins insisted that we post  this review because they want everyone to know how much they enjoyed eating them! After reading other reviews, we added a little ginger, nutmeg and cloves (just a pinch of each) Flavor was great.  We made half with nuts and half without, I think they are better without because texture is so mellow - I like to let them melt in my mouth! Great recipe for cool autumn day.

I really wasn't that impressed with this recipe. The taste is good enough, nothing I'd rave about. But the texture just wasn't right for cookies. Beyond cake-y. When I was dropping the cookies onto the baking sheet, I thought to myself that it felt way more like muffin batter than cookie dough, and they baked up like muffin blobs, not cookies. I think replacing the oil with butter and creaming it with the sugar like most cookie recipes would improve these texture issues. They didn't spread AT ALL, so they're not that visually appealing either. We'll eat them, but won't be making again.

Well... If you're a fan of cake like cookies then you may like these. I am not. It's not to say that they're bad..I mean they taste good but they don't remind me of what a cookie texture should be. These cookies are rather spongy..had they been crunchy or soft like I would have rated them a 5 but because the texture was rather spongy I had to give them a 3. Overall they tasted good but not great.

Great cookies!  I made them for my fall-themed birthday party and they got lots of compliments.  On the advice of others, I increased the cinnamon to 3 tsp and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  Just about right, I think.  I also used applesauce for half the oil.  I'll make these again!

These are definetly a cake like texture cookie. I replaced the oil with applesauce and added ground ginger, cloves and nutmeg. BF was not a fan but the guys at work really liked them.

This is a GREAT basic recipe. I gave it 4 stars because it does take some adjustments.  Like the other reviewers I upped the cinnamon, added ginger, nutmeg and cloves. I also reduced the oil, the chocolate chips and the bake time.  WAY too overpowering, cut the chocolate in half.

I made these on a whim tonight after hearing my kids rave about some pumpking chocolate chip cookies they had at a school party.  When I went to add the pumpkin, I realized I only had the canned pumpkin pie mix (it already has the spices), and had already added the cinnamon, but I put it in anyway and hoped for the best.  I was also dismayed to find I was out of cooking oil, so I used a cup of applesauce instead.  But even with both of those mistakes, they turned out great!  My normally picky hubby said "this one's a keeper" which is high praise, so this one goes in my favorites file!

This was the exact recipe I was looking for!  I wanted one similar to the kind of chocolote chip pumpkin cookies you find in the bakery section of the grocery store.  I love them!  Perfect for anytime of year, but especially fall.  Haven't tried it, but would be delicious with cream cheese frosting.  Also, I'm going to try to freeze some, and eat them still cold...they seem like they would be delicious this way too!  Very easy recipe, only 1 bowl to clean!

These are great cookies and were a bit hit!  I made a few changes though.  I added more cinnamon (probably twice the amount; but I don’t measure) and some nutmeg.  I also added about ¾ cup of applesauce and only ¼ cup of oil.  I also used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar and I left out the walnuts.  The cookies turned out moist and delicious!  Will definitely keep these as a Holiday go to cookie!

I increased the cinnamon to 1-1/2 teaspoons and added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg.  I decreased the cooking time to 12 minutes so that they weren't too dry.  I am going to drizzle a cream cheese icing on top.

I like that it is a simple recipe, which is good to do with young kids.  I used cocanut and olive iol instead of vegtable for a health boost.  I doubled the batch as I like to make lots and freeze extras!  I used half the chocolate chips and made nut free as all the schools around here are nut free...  I also doubled the cinanin

Excellent cookies! I made a few adjustments - I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar. I added half a teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/4 of a teaspoon of cloves and baked them for 10 minutes. Turned out wonderfully! Will be my go to recipe for autumn chocolate chip cookies for sure.

I used two cups of whole wheat flour and two cups of all-purpose flour to make these a touch healthier and found that it didn't impact the texture or flavor at all. I also used a full tablespoon of all spice.  These cookies taste like Fall!

These are the best cookies! I've been making these for the holidays for over 5 years and my family loves them. I use white chocolate or butterscotch chips and eliminated the nuts. And I love making these with my granddaughter.

These cookies are absolutely delicious.  I made a few changes...2 TBSP unsweetened orange juice instead of milk, 1 C unsweetened apple sauce instead of oil & I added cloves & ginger.  They are just the perfect mix of cake & cookie.  I will make these again!!!  Thank you for the excellent recipe!

Amazing!  Made these with the kids...and right out of the oven they were sooooo delicious!  I used 2 tsp. of cinnamon plus 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. ginger.  I also used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  They melt in your mouth!

I'm kind of torn with this one. My mom liked it but she likes anything with pumpkin. I liked the flavors but not the texture. It was almost too "muffin top" for me. Great flavor though!

If you are looking for a traditional "chewy cookie"  do not make these.  They taste like little bites of pumpkin bread.  They tasted good but they were too cake like for me.  But....everyone who had one said they were great.

Everyone loves these cookies when I bring them to parties. The only change I make is to add a tablespoon of nutmeg and cloves to give them a little more spice. I only cook them for 11minutes at 375degrees and they come out perfect.

I made this for thanks giving feast of my kid's school. It is more like cake not cookie at all. Both taste and flavor are not enough to satisfy my kids. Now I need to make something else for the school.

These cookies were good but I agree with another reviewer who said that Chocolate Chip Pumpkin Cookies III on this site were better.  They are made with oil too and have better flavor and texture. I was thinking children and others who don't care for spices might prefer this one though.

Used dark and white choc chips because that's what I had on hand. Bumped up the spices with Chinese 5 Spice. Big, moist double yummy cookies! Thanks for a great recipe, this one is a winner!

YUMMM-MMMYYYYY! These are delicious. They look just like the pic shown and were quite a hit with the family and guests. Just made last night and already had a few requests for the recipe. I did make the few changes per other reviewers. 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar. 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesauce. I used all semi-sweet chips, added a dash of pumpkin pie spice and an extra spoonful of pumpkin. Talk about a good time. Not too sweet, hit the spot!

I made these cookies for Halloween. I followed the recipe pretty closely, just left out the nuts and instead of mixing the choc chips into the batter I used mini choc chips to make jack-o-lantern faces on top. I also flattened the cookies on the baking sheet before putting them in the oven so they would be a little flatter and used a spatula to make ridges on them so they would look like little pumpkins. They came out very well, they are cake-like with a mild pumpkin flavor, not too spicy, and the chocolate chips are a great addition. The kids like them a lot. They're a tasty and cute seasonal treat!

This is what my son wanted for his birthday treat... & he LOVED them! So did the rest of his classmates.

Only changes I made (were mostly to my taste):
- I used 1/2 oil & 1/2 butter
- Only used 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips
- Doubled the cinnamon, & added nutmeg & allspice
- Baked on a stone at 365 for 14 minutes - the cookies are still soft, but firm on the tops & bottoms

I will ABSOLUTELY be making these again... & soon, because the double batch of 10 dozen are not going to last till tomorrow!

I cannot even explain in words how good these cookies are.  Took me two tries (not surprising, considering how inept I tend to be with directions), but on the second try they turned out better than I had hoped they would be.  Having a big holiday party and I can't wait to get more reactions!

I should have been more skeptical of this recipe since it reads more like a recipe for sweet bread rather than cookies, with the dry ingredients first, then adding wet. And that's exactly what it looked like when I mixed it up: bread batter. Very wet. I had done 1/2 ap flour and 1/2 ww flour, but I needed to add a lot of extra flour to make a dough that I could scoop out onto a cookie sheet. I had used 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce.    The cookies did not spread out at all, but baked straight up and are very cakey. My 7-year-old says they taste like muffins, and that's very much the texture they have. Maybe I added too much flour to make them scoopable, but I think I'll look for a different recipe for using up all my extra pumpkin rather than try to make this one work. At least my kids like them. But I want my cookies to look and taste like cookies.    Also, this makes a HUGE batch.

These were okay. Didn't taste like pumpkin at all and needs less chocolate- one cup would probably be fine. Despite this, texture was yummy. Will make again but with adjustments.

Wonderful and easy to make!  I've never had a cake-like cookie such as this but it was surprisingly good!  I added some allspice and nutmeg along with the cinnamon, and did 1/2 c applesauce 1/2 c oil.  May even cut back on oil and sugar next time around like other members mentioned.  A basic and delicious recipe as is, but easy to make slight changes to as well!

These cookies are excellent!  I added nutmeg and decreased the oil a little bit.  I used half wheat flour.  I baked 9 minutes per recommendations but found they were too underdone and had to bake longer.

These cookies couldn't be easier to make, and they are so tasty.  Their texture is somewhere between a cookie and a cake, which is just right with a cup of tea or coffee.  I made a half batch and the proportions were perfect.

I used fresh pumpkin and the flavor of the recipe was a little bland so I added in some cloves and some nutmeg and these are some of the best cookies I've ever had!

These cookies are fantastic!  Cake-like, tasty and easy! I followed the recipe as written, no changes made. I'll definately be making these again and thanks Heidi for sharing this recipe!  By the way, why do some cook's feel they have to add, take away from, or change recipes?  Sometimes, they are just FINE the way they are submitted!  Geesh....

These were really good, cakey cookies. They did need some more spice - pumpkin pie spice is perfect for it. Remind me of the pumpkin chocolate chip muffin tops our local grocery store sells. Yum! And they smell fantastic when they're cooking!

These were delicious. I added a few shakes of cloves, allspice & nutmeg because I knew from the ingredients I wanted a spicier cookie than just cinnamon and I'm glad I did. The flavor was great.   I DIDN'T realize just how cakey they would be. I don't mind the texture but I think I would've liked to know that before making them just so I wasn't so surprised after the fact!   I think this made more than 42 cookies - My friend and I made them with our kids and each of us had a heaping plateful when we were done!  Thanks for the recipe - I'll use it again.

These cookies turned out really tasty. They are more like a cake consistency, though, but I liked that. I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and added a little more cinnamon (didn't measure). I will definitely make these again.

This is a good, easy recipe.  My changes:  I used 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup oil, and I used dried cranberries in place of the chocolate chips.  Switching out the chocolate for fruit and changing half of the oil to applesauce makes it a little more health-friendly.  Adding the pumpkin pie spice really adds to the yum factor.  Over all, delicious and easy to make.  Note:  the dough will look more wet than you expect for cookies, don't worry, they come out perfect.

These are super-easy and tasty cookies.  I was in a hurry when I looked it up so didn't get a chance to read other reviews first, but it turns out I made similar modifications.  I used part whole wheat flour in place of all purpose.  I added a little extra cinnamon and also some ground cloves and a little pumpkin pie spice.  Next time I would use even more of the spices.  I reduced the oil (I use light in taste olive oil) to about 2/3 of a cup, and added 1/4 cup orange juice.  They are a very tasty, cake-like cookie.  I think next time I might try reducing the baking soda a little bit.  Oh, I also didn't use nuts.  My 2 year old was gobbling these up.

My husband made these a couple of days before Christmas and everyone loved them. He increased the amount of pumpkin as suggested by other reviewers. He used 1 1/2 of chocolate chips and 1 1/2 cups of nuts. He substituted one tsp of cinnamon with one tsp of pumpkin spice.  Really good, thank you.

These weren't bad, but they lacked the "umph" I was hoping for.  I changed the spiced up and liked it better:
3 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp cloves
1 tsp ginger
1/2 tsp allspice

Personal preference, but I think this recipe could be improved upon.

wow, I didn't see how many servings this made so when I did it I got more than hoped for. They're still good though. I wish they were alittle more pumpkiny. I left out the walnuts as well. Used applesauce instead of butter and i think it made them too soft. Will try again though.

We were out of oats (which most pumpkin cookies call for) so I did a search and this baby popped up. It was SO YUMMY! We were wary, as it looked a little runny, but boy did they fool us! They plumped up nicely and were VERY moist. Best Pumpkin Chocolate Chip recipe EVER.

I used 1 cup wheat flour, and half cup coconut oil, as well as 1tsp extra baking soda, and a bit of cinnamin, nutmeg, and pumpkin spice. super delish!! everyone is begging for some just based on fb pix! Also used homeade pumpkin puree so had a few ounces more than suggested, so just went with 1.5 eggs.

My coworkers LOVE these cookies and beg me to make them often. They affectionately refer to them as "cakies" because they are so light and fluffy. I originally made them as a fall treat, but my coworkers want them year-round. I have become famous for them.

These are definately cake-cookies!  The flavor is yummy!!  I used Chocolate Chunks and mini chocolate chips - more than recipe calls for, but I like them that way.  When you have the batter done, it is going to look really runny - that's ok.  They don't spread when they cook at all.  Wherever you put them on the pan and whatever it looks like when you put them down, is exactly what they will look like when they are done.  Also, I cooked them for 11 minutes.  The first batch was 12 min and seemed a little dry to me.  That extra minute made the difference.

These cookies are wonderfully simple and tasty.  I don't like pumpkin, but I found myself sneaking back for more.  The pumpkin is a mild flavor and the chocolate chips are an added bonus.

These are delicious, I used about 18 oz of pumpkin and lowered the chocolate chips as previously suggested and baked for about 12 minutes which was perfect and kept the cookie soft.  Will definitely make again.

I made the cake mix cookies first and thought they were good, but then I made this recipe and it was even better. I made the first batch plain, the second with choc. chips, and the third with choc chips and walnuts. I personally liked the ones with the nuts. Save your money, dont buy the box and make this recipe!

The dough was cake like and I didn't have chips or walnuts so I added quick cooking oatmeal.  I was leary of them cooking up to be a real cookie because the dough was so soft.  Magic happened...they turned out like cookie cakes.  Very good.  I will add more spice next time but this is a keeper!  I rizzled Hershey's chocolate on the 2nd batch before I put them in the oven.

Super Yummy cookies!! I used my 10 cup food processor w/ the dough blade since I don't have a mixer. It worked great! A just kept sticking the container in the fridge while waiting to load the next cookie pan. (I also added some nutmeg)

These were incredible and very moist. The only change I made was increasing the spices a bit to our personal taste. I halved the recipe, but still came out with about 4 dozen. I used a cookie scooper, which may have made them a bit small. Everyone LOVED these and the recipe leaves a lot of room for creative experimenting next time!

Loved the fact of no butter, I did have to cut mine in half due to not having enough ingredients, but it was delicious. Love pumpkin, these were easy to get ready and make, will be making again!

These cookies turned out great! I halved the batch and put chocolate chips and walnuts in one half and walnuts and dried cranberries in the other half.  Both turned out great, however I was more partial to the cranberries ones, while others were partial to the chocolate chips...to each their own!

ok, i think i would've given 4 stars IF the hand mixer didn't break...yes, when i was mixing it with medium speed, it got so thick & sticky, i could smell the burning from inside of handmixer!i'm bummed right now. I have to go to buy a new one asap, esp. cuz it's the season for baking! Did anybody have this experience?? I did finish mixing before it burst into fire (thank god!), i had to throw the handmixer away...:-( I was afraid what kind of cookies i was making, but it turned out fine. But since i don't want to spend more $ for new hand mixer everytime i bake this cookies, i'll probably not bake this again... Different kind of regular cookies.

Great one-bowl recipe. I mixed it by hand and it was quick and simple. I omited the walnuts, but will probably add them next time I make it. I also used a Pumpkin Pie spice blend intead of straight cinammon. Overall, GREAT results

I thought this was a good recipe, but... it was a bit on the watery side, a cookie batter should be really sticky but not watery.  I thought that there was a little to much oil for the recipe, but all together it was a great recipe, what I did was i put pumpkin pie spice in it instead and it gave it a nice spiced pumpkin flavor.  Also I added extra chocolate chips instead of nuts because I don't like nuts in my cookies.  I've experienced some culinary school, and by far this was my most favorite recipe on the site so far.  Thank-you very much. ~kristen~

These cookies turned out pretty good, but the chocolate chips overpowered the pumpking flavor.  I think 1 1/2 C. would of been better.  Also, I think I would add some nutmeg or pumpkin pie spice to give it a little kick.

Everyone loved these cookies. I made them for cookie trays to give away, and even after a few days they were still moist and delicious. They will definitly be made next year.

These are wonderful cookies!  The pumpkin flavor is pretty subtle though (which I loved) so if you want more pumpkin-y cookies you may need to add pumpkin spice or clove or something.  Plus the cookies are wonderfully fluffy!! 5 stars for sure!

most cans of pumpkin i found were 15 ounces... these cookies really need the full 16. i put 1/2 cup of pepitas to make them really crunchy and gooey.

I was dissappointed in the cake-like texture. If I were in the mood for pumpkin bread these are great, but if I want a cookie I'm wanting soemthing with more density. I added an extra cup of flour, 8 ounce package of cream cheese, nutmeg and allspice for more flavor and in half the batch I added baking cocoa. I will keep trying other recipes and adding my own ingredients to find the "perfect" pumpkin chocolate chip cookie recipe.

Mmmm.  These are delicious cookies.  I did make some changes though.  I substituted whole wheat flour for half of the flour, instead of using 2 cups of white sugar, I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 2/3 cup white sugar, I substituted apple sauce for almost all of the oil, I doubled the cinnamon and added dashes of ginger, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves.

These are amazing!  I added a little nutmeg to mine for an extra kick.  They do not flatten out much when you bake them, so if you want thinner cookies, you may want to mash them a little in the center before you put them in the oven.  I didn't and they turned out quite thick and small, but they were great no the less!!

My family loves pumpkin and this recipe was fantastic.  The only changes I made were 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, and unfortunately once the cookies were nearly mixed I realized I did not have chocolate chips, so they were omitted.  So instead I put cream cheese icing on top.  Absolutely delicious!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

These cookies were an unexpected treat. I never thought pumpkin and chocolate would be good together but I was wrong. I made these for a food day at work and had to talk people into trying them. now each fall,I'm asked to bring these in. They are dense and very rich...very tasty and a keeper.

I didn't like these at all.  They tasted way TOO gummy and the next day they were worse!  They didn't taste like cookies, or even cake-like cookies and I ended up throwing away the whole batch the next morning.

In the future I'll try some of the spice variations mentioned here, but they're great as-is! Quick, easy, and they taste like autumn! Be warned though--they get a little sticky by the next day when stored in an airtight container, so make sure you use generous amounts of wax paper between each layer of cookies. Still taste good though!

GREAT RECIPE!! I substituted WHITE CHOCOLATE chips for Chocolate chips~much more delicious;) I just thought that it would complement the pumpkin flavor better and everyone enjoyed them!

A bit of a disappointment.  The flavor was good, but they were really dry even after cutting back on the cooking time.  I'm sure I could tweak it until it was just right, but I lack the time and energy.   Instead, I recommend Chocolate Chip Pumpkin Cookies III from this site...just cut back on the soda a tad and dissolve in liquid before adding to the mix.

These are great. Over the years I've made them I have added mini chips to piack more into small (1t.) drop cookies which freeze and thaw better than the larger ones - I've been making them for several years and they are a huge hit at work and with the kids.

This cookies are so good!!! A friend made some delicious Pumpkin Chocolate Chip cookies for Halloween.  They were fluffy and cakey.  I looked for a similar recipe and this one is exactly it.  I used a bit of whole wheat flour and a bit of brown sugar and added nutmeg.  I put 6 big cookies on a sheet rather than 12 little ones.

Not the best tasting cookie but I love to make it because it has oil and mixes together so quickly---no creaming butter or defrosting frozen sticks!  Everyone at work loves these!

These cookies turned out real fluffy and soft. I thought that they were missing something, but couldn't figure it out.  I gave some to a friend and she loved them.  Said they tasted great.

These were pretty good, but I think I'll try another recipe in the future. At the suggestion of others, I added in nutmeg and allspice (maybe a teaspoon of each) and it came out good. I think others were surprised at the cakey texture, but they seemed to like them. My biggest complaint is that they started drying out by the second day even though they had been in sealed tupperware.

These are quick and easy to make. However, they are very bland and cakelike. I increased to 3t. pumpkin pie spice and also drizzled an icing over them. I made half with nuts and half without and thought the ones with nuts were much better with the texture and flavor. Not sure if I would make these again especially with the full cup of oil.

I thought these were really good!!  They weren't really sweet, which I liked.  The chocolate chips topped them off.  I would definately make these again.

We also left out the walnuts. The cookies are firm yet moist, kind of an unusual cake-like texture inside. We thought that they could have used a tiny bit more spice flavoring, they seemed a tad bland. But for the most part they were awesome, definitely a keeper recipe and a great way to make a pumpkin-flavored snack/desert for the fall holidays!
