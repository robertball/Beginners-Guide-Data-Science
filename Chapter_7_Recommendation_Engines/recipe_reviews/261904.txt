Tried these yummy cookies and my kids and I loved them. They had the perfect amount of sweetness and crunchiness. Definitely a hit in my house.

Followed as written. The chocolate never really hardens, but it makes it finger licking good. Super good and addicting. This makes a big batch, so it's great for a big crowd or as breakfast!
