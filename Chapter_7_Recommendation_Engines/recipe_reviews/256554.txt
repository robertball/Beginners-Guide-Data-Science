I had bought some tomato-basil chicken sausage from Aldi (package of 4, and I used all of them), and didn't have a clue what I was going to do with it, so I typed "chicken sausage" into the ingredients search and this recipe showed up in the search. I made the gnudi (ricotta gnocchi), also from this site to use in this recipe. I didn't see the purpose of the flour in this recipe, so I left it out. I really liked this, but my husband and son were not thrilled, so I probably won't make it again - but I encourage others to try it!

As written, I would give this recipe one star.  However, taking the idea of the recipe and turning it into a one pot preparation made it 5 stars.  I doubled the recipe, no butter, sauteed the onion in a bit of olive oil, potato gnocchi, Aldi's spinach and feta chicken sausage, and used a lot of chicken broth.  My family could not get enough of it.

It did take a lot of pots and pans but very yummy!  I substituted Ghee for butter and used rice flower. Still delicious!  Used Delallo gluten free gnocchi

I usually don't follow a recipe exactly, and I found this recipe to be no exception.  I substituted the gnocchi for cheese tortellini, and the mixture of seasonings was exactly compatible. At first, you might think it is too bland, but the more you eat the more the flavor gets your attention.

Came out very good, I used 17 oz of gnoochi and asian medley instead of broccoli.  I also only used 1 large skillet.

I made this! It's a bit tasteless. While being healthy, something is missing. I used less pots by combining some steps. I added grated parmesan cheese for more flavor. I encourage people to try it, but I doubt I will be making this again.

This is a great basis for a recipe. I used the essentially the same ingredients, but in different proportions and simplified the steps to reduce the number of pots/pans used. Was super delicious and so I'm happy I found this one. I will add a modified version of it to my recipes.

I think I needed to chop the sausage and broccoli into smaller pieces for better texture, but the flavor and pairings worked well. We’ll make again.

Look at some of the other recipes in this collection — see how to do it in one skillet, and skip a couple of pots.

Personally I would rate this a 4 as its a little plain and could use a tad more flavour, but the husband and two kids loved it (other than the broccoli for the kids) so I'll probably be making this again. May try an Italian pork sausage next time for more flavour and something a little more than just a butter sauce.
