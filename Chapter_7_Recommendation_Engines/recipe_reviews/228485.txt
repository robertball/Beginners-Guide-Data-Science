Nana has some good ideas - but the liquidity of the salad is a twist on the heavy feeling and it allows the seasonings to swim.  Also, I reccomend Applewood smoked bacon, in the mix and also as a garnish because although the mixed part may be soggy, it serves 2 functions: the savory smoky flavor melds with the salad and adds a punch and the residual fat from the bacon stiffens up the liquidity.  If you only garnish with bacon and omit the milk, you miss a punch! For those who like dill or pickles, they are a good substitution for vinegar and a flavor booster!

Yum! Bacon! What a nice addition to potato salad. I mixed up the dressing and did not add the milk as I thought it would make the dressing too thin. I did use the white vinegar but next time I would use pickle juice instead and add dill pickles to the potato salad. I don't care for soggy bacon so I set that aside and then put it in just before serving. Thanks for a tasty recipe.

My husband can't get enough of this potato salad!  I made a couple of changes, and added about a tablespoon of the bacon drippings to the dressing to get even more of that wonderful bacon flavor.  Really delicious!

It's different, not mushy, if you use less mayo, the best recipe I've used so far. Also, it's good without eggs, if you don't like eggs in potato salad.

overall very good but I would make the following changes next time I make this
one small onion or less.  One large onion is pretty powerful
4 or 5 sticks of celery
Chop/dice the onion and celery
about 1 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream
2 teaspoons celery salt
1 lb of bacon and 5 lbs of potatoes
maybe some green onion or dill for color

I dropped a star ONLY because, based on other reviews, the salad is a bit dressing-heavy as written. I made less dressing, and used half mayo and half sour cream. Everyone loved it!

This is an excellent recipe. I made mine with a mix of baby red and Yukon gold potatoes with the skin left on to add some texture to the salad. It was a big hit at a Fathers Day barbecue.
