Full disclosure: I added 1/4 tsp salt because a recipe without salt is bizarre to me. I don't know if it made any difference. I also added 1/4 cup chopped pecans, because mmm, pecans.  I used thawed, frozen peaches. 

Results: Very moist and fluffy and delicious!  Will definitely make again and freeze some for easy breakfasts.

Delicious fruity, moist bran-type muffins. Very filling! Have made several times and alter a little each time. Definitely needs salt in recipe—I use 1/2 teaspoon and a pinch in topping.  If nuts aren’t an issue for you, add nuts of your choice to topping-finely chop a 1/4 cup or more if you like.  I also add 1/4 cup raisins as my family likes them, and a dash of nutmeg and ground cloves as these spices are my favorite.  Another thing I’ve used is 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract and cut back on the vanilla.  I think my husband buys peaches and “forgets” to eat them, as he knows I will not let them expire, just so he can have more delish muffins!These muffins rise nicely when baking and the topping is a perfect addition. I would rate them highly next to any professional baker!

Instead of oil I used applesauce. Instead of sugar in the muffin portion I used Stevia. The flavor seemed a little flat. I did not notice until after I baked them there is no salt listed in the recipe. I will make it again, but will add maybe 1/2 to 2/3 teaspoon of salt. .

Delicious way to use fresh peaches. Used walnuts in the topping. Will make again!
