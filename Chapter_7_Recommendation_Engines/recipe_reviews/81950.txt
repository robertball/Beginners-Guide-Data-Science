I love this recipe even though I use limeade instead of lemonade and use plain brandy instead of apricot brandy. My mother has been making this recipes for as long as I can remember and I absolutely love it! It is a christmas tradition!!!!

I got this recipe from my mother-in-law.  I made it for my bunco group and it was a big hit.  However, I used peach brandy and substituted frozen peach daquiri mix for one of the concentrates.  I also provide ginger ale, rather than lemon-lime soda. Be sure to make this first thing in the morning and stir every hour or two to keep the alcohol mixed as well as to prevent big chunks from forming (trust me on this, I learned the hard way!).
