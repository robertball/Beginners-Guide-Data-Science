I had always made these sort of hash browns after having leftover mashed potatoes. I have found through the years that cooking them on a lower temperature works better at keeping them together. If you cook them on medium to med-low for about 10 minutes on one side, it gets them very nice and browned which aids in flipping them over. Also, have a spatula that is big enough to encompass the whole bottom of the pancake. Makes sure to completely brown one side before flipping it. It just takes patience. I have also found that the flatter I make them, the better they turn out. If they are only 1/4 inch thick or less, they cook faster and are crispier than if they are thicker. Just a few suggestions to aid in your frustrations...   :-)

My family has been making these for years except we add a little flour so they hold together better. We also call them potato cakes instead of hashbrowns. This is a terrific recipe.

My husband asked me to make pancakes from left over mashed potatoes, so I gave this recipe a try.  However, I remember that my mother used flour in hers.  I think that explains the problem of them not sticking together that other reviewers mentioned.

About half a cup of all-purpose flour should be enough - add it slowly until you get the right level of stickiness.

We really enjoyed having a treat we remember from childhood!

I consider myself to be a pretty good & experienced cook & this recipe did not turn out for me at all.Even after adding an add'l 1/4 of flour to try & make it stay together it still fell apart,by the time I added enough flour to make it stick ,it tasted like dough.I seen a similar recipe before using grated potatoes instead of mashed & those potatoe pancakes rocked!!I wouldn't try these again.

the recipe was good I used shredded potatoe instead of mashpotatoes. It fell apart but still good. Might need another egg to hold better.

Kids and I loved these.  Here's my minor changes-
Saute onions in olive oil and tad butter first, add 1/4 cup flour to onions when lightly browned.  Add onion mix to egg/potato.  Drop onto already heated pan with little oil in it.  Flatten to no more than 1/2 inch patties.  Cook medium heat for abt. 10 min/side.  Don't touch them while cooking.  I also added a little shredded white cheddar to cooked side after flipping.   Worth the wait!!!

These hashbrowns were DELICIOUS! My husband is just about the pickiest eater EVER and he loved them! I followed the recipe to a 'T' but I added some extra seasoning with 'season-all'. This just added more flavor. I also added flour so they would hold together better and this was a good choice. Serve them fresh and hot though because the crispiness of the frying fades over a little time.

Very good.  I used leftover garlic mashed potatoes so I didn't think I'd need the onion but I should have used lightly sauteed onions.  I took the advise of other reviews and sprayed pan with cooking spray then sprinkled with flour. Had no trouble turning or holding together.  Will do again.

These did not come out. I couldn't get them to clump together, even after adding flour (tried both with and without flour). They came out lumpy, hard and had a bad texture.

While this recipes is similiar to one that I use for potatoe pancakes it is missing the flour. It is also name incorectly. These are not hashbrowns in any sort of the way.

This recipe is not the best. The batter seemed fine but the whole cooking part really let the recipe down. No matter how hard I tried, it was impossible to come out at least decent. And even when I left it on longer, it just burnt and crumbled apart. Would not recommend this recipe even adding flour, it still didn't work and the taste is not worth the effort. If you're going to make hashbrowns, try this recipe instead, it tastes great and the extra effort is better than wasting good food - http://allrecipes.com/recipe/classic-hash-browns/

Worked perfectly! I had leftover mashed new potatoes, I added 1/4 cup Parmesan and 1/4 arrowroot flour.  I fried them on med-low for 10 minutes a side, and they were crisp on the outside, tender on the inside.  Didn't fall apart at all, but you should be gentle.

This is a really nice way to liven up leftover mashed potatoes!  I added a touch of parsley for color.  I found that they browned best if I let them sit in the pan with a cover on them on a medium high heat.  Tasty!

From the advice of other reviews I grated potatoes and cooked for 10 mins per side at med to med-low heat.  It worked great.  They came out crispy and delicious.  I would also suggest adding some paprika and/or curry powder.

Pretty good, but too much onion! Next time trying only 1/4c. Also added 1/4c flour. Held together well as long as I waited to flip. Cooked on medium heat for at least 10 min before flipping

These were great for crispiness but a bit too bland so I put some onion powder into the mix then fried up the rest.

Delicious!!  I did add a little parm cheese and used leftover mashed potatoes. Have made potatoe cakes for years but always had them fall apart. I did as some reviews suggested, lowered heat and put a lid on for 10 minutes per side. Came our picture perfect   
Hubby loved it too. 
Thanks for the recipe.

It required some flour to hold them together. Otherwise, very good.

Made it with freshly made mashed potatoes (with milk, butter and basil). I think the milk helped in toasting it. The potatoes were spread thinly on the skillet and they turned out beautifully!

I keep it pretty much the same.  I found them to be on the bland side.

The recipe was ok I just doubled the amount of egg, cooked on an electric nonstick griddle without using olive oil and made the temperature higher than 375 F.

Added just a little Cajun spice.  Flip only once make sure you get it crispy before flipping.  Really good with some Scrambled Eggs and Sausage.  If you start off with fairly dry mashed potatoes it works very well if you potatoes are more moist you will have to add flour or fine grind white corn meal....Don't be scared of the salt and cajun spice.

I didn't have mashed potatoes so shredded some followed the recipe.  I did have to use some flour because it was to wet.  Hubby said they needed something. He added ketchup and ate them but wasn't what I expected.

This was a very good recipe, although I use shredded potatoes instead of leftover mashed potatoe. It was really tasty. The only problem with this was that it was kind of hard to flip the hashbrown while cooking in the oil because it would come apart, but I think that this was because instead of the mash potatoe I used shredded potatoe.

These were good.  I added lots of spices.  Mine fell apart in the pan and made a mess, but they tasted good anyway.
