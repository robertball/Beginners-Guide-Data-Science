This is really good. It's true that it is runnier than a buttermilk dressing but it doesn't matter. The taste is fantastic. I'm not lactose intolerant or have any issues with dairy and still loved this. It is a nice change to a usual dressing without additives or useless fats! This can definitely be used in place of any ranch or buttermilk dressing. Thank you Bibi!! Update: I added 2 tsp of dried coconut pulp (leftover from making coconut milk) and that thickened this up a bit without giving it any coconut flavour!!  :-)

Fabulous!  I couldn't find cultured coconut milk but canned coconut milk works fine.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and the taste and consistency is better than I ever could have hoped!

Simple and very tasty! Cultured coconut milk is coconut yogurt. Easy to find unsweetened in health food stores but harder to find on regular grocery stores. My son even likes it!

Made it with the canned coconut milk.  What a great recipe!  I am lactose intolerant and love creamy dressing.  Store bought dressings are filled with sodium and sugar.  I guess coconut milk isn't perfect but this makes me happy with salad again.

I just recently had to start eating dairy-free due to stomach issues and I came across this recipe, it's fantastic!
