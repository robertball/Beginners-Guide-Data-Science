One of my familys favorites. This reciepe has been in my family for years too, only we crumble cornfalkes really small and put them on top, then melt about a half stick of butter and pour it over the whole thing. It never turns out soupy, maybe those who said it did, added milk to the soup? It does need a short setting time of about 10 minutes, but it should turn out perfect! Try O'brien potatoes for some extra zest!!

I have seen several versions of this recipe over the years calling for all types of soup and usually cheddar cheese.  This was the first time I had made with processed cheese.  I will stick with the cheddar.  Also, you only need about 1/2 that amount of sour cream usually.  I always add a little milk during cooking if too dry.

This a great recipe just the way it is.  After making it a few times as Adel submitted it, I started tweaking.  I make it with just the potatoes, sour cream, and cream of chicken soup, along with black pepper and garlic powder and serve it all the time as a side with beef, chicken, or pork.  I also make the original recipe with cream of potato soup (instead of chicken) and add chunked ham.  It's awesome!!  Thanks Adel.  (I always leave off the butter.  It's just not needed).

This recipe has been in my family for years.  However, I suggest that you crumble Ritz cracker over the top and sprinkle butter on the crackers before you put it in the oven.

These are the best cheesy potatoes!  I use this recipe for all large get togethers and get raves every time. I would set out the frozen potatoes for a while to defrost a little bit to cut down on the cooking time.  Great Potatoes Here!!

Everyone goes back for seconds....and thirds....there's never any leftovers when this is served.  Goes good with almost anything - briskit, chicken, turkey.  Great fool proof recipe, and easy to make.

I loved these potatoes! It reminded me of macaroni and cheese, they came out fluffy, cheesy and very good! You must use all ingredients to come out with the right recipe. A great new side dish!

My husband and I liked these.  I used O'Brien potatoes since that is what I had in my freezer and I only used 1/2 of the sour cream called for and they still turned out a little too soupy.

I thought these were delicious.  I cut up an onion and added that and I accidentally bought cream of celery soup instead of cream of chicken, but still the potatoes were delicious.  They were a little "soupy" but I may have not added enough hash browns.  The leftovers were just perfect!

Very delicious! The only change I made was using 32 ounces of hash browns instead of the 16 ounces the recipe calls for. I used hashbrowns with onions and peppers already in then to give it a bit more flavor like some of the other reviewers suggested. Also I put shredded cheese on top of the hashbrowns. I used a lot more butter than 1 tablespoon! I put about 1 stick of butter on top of the shredded cheese, then put on the cubes of cheese(I used about 10 1/2 ounces of processed cheese). Then I put crumbled up corn flakes on top and then about 1/2 a stick of butter on top of that. The only other altercation I made was I used a bit of garlic powder, salt, and pepper but not much! It turned out fantastic!!! Thanks so much for the recipe!

Yum!!  Just make sure you cook it much longer if you are using frozen potatoes.  Also, 16 oz of potatoes isn't enough.  Used the 32 oz. bag.

Excellent side dish for ham, but am i the only one that thinks 16oz of potatoes is way off?  I used 32oz of potatoes, leaving the rest of the recipe portions alone.  I also used light sour cream and added some diced onion, dash of salt, and pepper.  Add crushed corn flakes sprinkled with butter for additional appeal.

This recipe has also been in my family for years except, ours calls for 8oz shredded cheddar cheese.I have found something to zest it up a little is by adding french onion chip dip instead of sour cream. Also if you cook it longer it will thicken up.

I would use half the soup and half the sour cream next time and real cheese.  My kids like it O.K. but it was very soupy.

So disappointing. Next time I will try to follow Breakstone's recipe for cheesy potatoes. This recipe seemed to be off in terms of ingredient amounts and instructions. I have a fridge full of "cheesy potatoes" and I am just delaying the inevitable - throwing them out!

This was my first time making these with Velveeta and I'm not very impressed.  I've used many different kids of "cream of..." soups, and they've all turned out really great with just regular shredded cheese, but this makes it so all you taste it the cheese!

I make this often and usually substitute Potatoes O'Brien for hash browns (peppers give it more flavor) and Cream of Celery soup for the chicken.  Add shredded cheddar cheese to top and melt.

This was pretty good, although it took a lot longer to bake than 30 minutes. I ended up turning on the broiler to brown the cheese on top. I followed the recipe instructions pretty closely, except I subbed nonfat plain yogurt for the sour cream. Might add peppers and onions next time...

This is recipe is fast and easy.  Too much sour cream for my liking, but everyone else loved'em!  At first I thought that they were going too be soupy, but after you let them cool for awhile the thicken up.  Great recipe!!  Recommended!

I, too, found this to be "mushy". It was very cheesy, though. I suppose a good side dish for children, but not special enough for Christmas dinner.

As is, the recipe is pretty good. Now, add in a small amt of chopped onion and use shredded cheddar on top, as well as a little mixed in with the potatoes, and the recipe is off-the-charts good. I make this (with my changes) every holiday and it is always the most complimented side dish,

I've been looking for a base recipe I can tweak to make my own, and one that will compete with my sisters'.  This one has potential.  The modifications I started with were to puchase the frozen diced potatoes that have onion and pepper in them for flavor.  I substituted Cream of Celery soup as well.  I used 1/2 processed cheese and 1/2 shredded cheddar.  Reduced the sour cream by 1/2, and took another reviewers suggestion to crumble corn flakes on top.  I found the cooking time a 30 minutes left the potatoes a bit too hard for my husbands liking.  I happen to like them with a little hardness left in them.  Next time I'll try cooking them 45 minutes.  I may also try seasoned shredded potatoes.  They may hold the mixture together better.

Nice, easy recipe.  I used fat free soup, cheese, and sour cream, and didn't add the butter per some of the other reviews, and I added garlic, garlic powder, and a touch of oregano.  Mine was not nearly as good as others I've had, but it was due to the low fat ingredients so I'm still giving the recipe a good rating.  Next time I want to try with the potatoes O'Brien!

This was so good!  My grandma used to make something similar.  After supper was over, I went and got a bowl for a snack!  Good work.

This recipe is a little soupy. I tried this, and it helped: thawed out the potatos and halved the sour cream. Then I shredded the cheese, and added all ingredients except the potatos together. I put potatos in the bottom of the pan, and spread mixture over them. I sprinked crushed corn flakes over the top, and poured half a stick of melted butter over them. DELISH!!

I am a young professional woman who has hardly anytime to even sleep, let alone cook dinner but these potatos are so simple, fast, and cheap to make you will find yourself thinking about these throughout the day. And they make great left overs!Might I suggest adding more cheese and if you would like some ham is also great with this dish. Thanks for the recipe

Delicious!! I've been making this recipe for a few years now exactly as shown and it's always a big hit. I like it a little crispy though so I usually up the temp to 400 or broil it on low for the last 5 mintues. We serve it with ham and it makes tons but there's usually little left over because everyone gobbles it.

This recipe has been in my family for years.  The only modifications are we use sour cream and chives (this adds an extra layer of flavor) and use buttered coated corn flakes on top.  This is by far creamier and richer than any recipe using cheddar cheese.  Delicious!

Have made this for years, my family loves it. I chop up onions and celery then saute in butter when done I mix these with the soup & other ingred. We like onions & celery so I use alot. If I have them on hand I chop up fresh mushrooms & add them also.  Works great in a crockpot or oven.

These were pretty ok for a morning banquet. I also halved the sourcream and was happy with the cheese:cream taste ratio. Def. added more potatoes for same amt of cheese. Didn't need the butter though I buttered the bottom of the pan instead. I added powedered garlic & minced onions for flavor & chopped bkfst sausages. I layered the soup mix over the pots then put cheese on top. This was ok but it remained layered & I think I should have mixed the soup w/the pots as the recipe says to. I used mostly thawed pots & still cooked for nearly the whole time. Only spots of the top browned but it remained creamy in the middle more than the outside, maybe because I didn't mix. Dried up a little before serving. I would use these for a morning banquet again. Thanks.

My husband thought these were the best potatoes EVER.  I thought they were quite good, and I will try them again with cream of potato soup for a variation in flavor.  I used cheddar cheese since that is a favorite in our family.  Thanks for the recipe!

I ended up using cream of mushroom soup as it was a holiday and I could not get the cream of chicken soup. I also added chopped onion to taste and sprinkle some of the cheese over the top of the casserole. Got compliments from everyone who ate it for Christmas dinner and was asked for my recipe..

Even though I used fresh potatoes shredded, it still wasn't cheesy enough until I put more cheese myself.  Good flavor, but, I don't think I will be making this again.

I thought these were very good. I used light sour cream, reduced fat Velveeta and cream of celery instead of chicken. I also topped the dish with paprika and cornflake crumbs. Very tasty, and not rich and heavy like potato casseroles normally are. I will use this recipe again.

Instead of regular frozen hash browns I used the o'brien type and wow it was really great.  I also chose to use colby jack and sharp chedder cheese. My husband and I loved them.  The leftovers were also great.

Imixed all ingredients together and added red pepper . Then added cracker crumbs for the topping. I crushed 18 ritz crackers mixed with 2 Tbsp melted butter for a nice golden crust. Yummy!

I have made this many times but without the soup. I blanch (10 minutes) my own potatoes (quartered or half lengthwise) and use a salad shooter to make hash browns. I coat the dish with butter spray. I spread out 1/4 of hash brown in dish and sliced up about half a stick of butter and spread it out over layer. I ground some fresh pepper over layer. Next I mixed sour cream, 4 ounces of mild sharp cheese, and the hash browns. I spread out a layer of this in the dish. Finally, I spread out 4 ounces of Velveeta Cheese. Goes nice with an Easter Ham.

I think this works best with a 32 oz bag of hashbrowns or diced potatoes. I added ham (leftover) and didn't do the butter. I used shredded colby-jack cheese on top. I will use it again when I have left over ham! Thanks.

added salt, pepper and garlic powder, a good pinch of chili powder cut the sour cream in 1/2 and always use cheddar avoiding processed cheese. very good and tossed in a scoop of garlic herb cream cheese

I made this recipe x6 for a grad party, it was in a huge catering pan and it was an absolute hit. it was the first dish to disappear. i had to scrape the pan for my own serving during cleanup.

I am a vegetarian so when i make these potatoes, i substitute cream of mushroom soup for the cream of chicken. it tastes almost the same. my mom didn't even notice.

I didn't have cream of chicken one time and made it with cream of mushroom. Still perfect and a family fave! I used shredded cheese on top instead of blocks of cheese and it was divine!

The family really enjoyed this recipe. I followed suggestions from other reviews and added half the sour cream and added ham and diced onions as well. I didn't have any processed cheese on hand but added some cheddar to the mix and then layered cheese on top. My husband suggested next time to crush up some frenchs onions and put them on top for some crunch next time. I served this as a meal with biscuits. I would recommend leaving it in a little longer in the oven, was not quite hot enough in the very middle.

Yes yes yes! I use cream of celery instead of the chicken and I serve it with lots of green onions and chopped tomatoes. Super easy, and super delicious!

A little too bland. It needs a mix of sour cream and cream cheese to give it a zip.

Used shredded potato sticks unstead of hashbrown. I also believe my frozen pototoe sticks had seasoning in it like red pepper. also added some jalopine peppers about 5 or 6 whole ones. really added good flavor not spicy just right. did'nt taste like something was missing as usual! didn't need a ton of different cheeses and seasoning to wake it up!

It was missing something maybe pepper or onion or something but not much taste and didnt taste anything like other cheesy potatoe recipes.
