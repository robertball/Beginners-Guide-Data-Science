I really like moist cake so I enjoyed this recipe. However, I thought it was missing something so I added a cinnamon strudel on top. Delicious!!!  I made the strudel by adding 1/3 cup packed brown sugar, 2 tablespoons all purpose flour, 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 tablespoon butter.

9/7/06 I couldn't believe how quick, easy and delicious this cake turned out! It took absolutely no time to make, and was so moist and flavorsome (I used cherry pie filling). It will, without doubt, be a staple in my house in the future. Thanks, Joyce! 1/10/07 Made this again yesterday with a can of peach pie filling. It was still very good but not as sweet as I would have liked. I would recommend adding more sugar with this particular fruit.

This is a grest recipe with some "tweaking"; hence the 4 star rating.  Others reviewers have complained of blandness, so here ishow I boosted the flavor factor.  I use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup melted butter (instead of oil) and 1 (6 ox) container of yogurt (same flavor as pie filling used), 1 1/2 cups freash fruit added to the pie filling.  So for Blueberry Pied Cake I use blueberry yogurt and 1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries and I onit the cinnamon.  For Cherry Pie Cake, cheery yogurt and fresh or frozen cherries and I omit the cinnamon and use almond extract instead of vanilla.  Strawberry Pie Cake is delicious too!  You get the idea.  This is a very versatile recipe and that's why I like it! I get rave reviews every time I've served my version of Pie Cake.  It's great for breakfast or dessert!

We used a can of blueberries and this was a hit (even with my mother-in-law who usually only likes chocolate desserts).  I don't know what fruit the person who said this cake turned out dry used because I've never had a more moist cake.  Very easy, moist, light and delicious.  A little scoop of ice cream compliments this well.  Thank you Joyce!

Quick and yummy. Using strawberry filling gives it a very PINK look! Missing from the instructions: Turn the cake out of the pan when it has cooled a while.

I made this cake exactly as the directions were written, using blueberry pie filling istead of cherry. It is a very moist cake and couldn't be easier to make. We enjoyed it very much with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I think this recipe is wonderful!! I had to make a couple changes. I didn't have walnuts so I used pecans instead. I left out the cinnamon, which I figured I wouldl like in apple but I used cherry pie filling and added 1/2 teaspoon pure almond extract. It baked up beautifully and is sooooo moist and good. I will definitely be using this recipe a lot. So quick and easy! Thank you for sharing it.

Super easy and good.  I used strawberry pie filling and substituted vanilla for the cinnamon.  I don't know how the person who submitted the photo cut it into wedges like that, because mine is so moist I don't see how it would hold that shape.  Actually, more moist than I would prefer, but got so many rave reviews I will definitely make it again and will enjoy experimenting with different pie fillings.  I like the reviewers ideas to spruce it up a bit, so that will be an ongoing adventure to add to it.  I think a streusel top would be great, and adding some additional fresh fruit might also be nice.

Loved the cake. Halved the recipe, as I didn't need that much cake, but didn't halve the pie filling, so it was more pie filling than cake. Still delicious and moist though. Used apple pie filling, which really worked with the cinnamon.

Very interesting 'cake'.  It was very quick and easy to put together.  Very moist, pretty tasty.  It would be good with a whipped topping.

Pretty good, and extremely easy.  A great use for my extra homemade pie filling.  The pie filling I had was a berry mix and it worked well with this.  I also tossed in an overripe banana bc I didn't want to make any banana bread or cake as well.  I baked in a bundt pan bc I don't like to make sheet cakes (I'm weird, I know), and it needed about 55 min total to bake through completely.  It was a good complement to a smoothie I had this morning.  Thanks for the recipe!

One of the keys to getting the best result with this recipe is to choose a really good quality canned pie filling since it is such a large part of the batter.  I used a store brand blueberry flavor and the filling itself was rather bland (I tasted a little out of the can after I made the recipe).  Maybe the extra fruit pie filling would be a better choice.  Also blueberry makes an unappetizing color of batter, so I decided at the last minute to use a streusel topping to cover up the gray color.  I would recommend using a topping and the optional nuts to make this cake more interesting.  It came out a little too moist even baking it for a full 60 minutes.  This was good, my teenager liked it, but not my favorite.

This cake is great!  Very easy to make.  Had it for a group of senior citizens and they gave it a ratiing of 6.  Will try apples next time with a streusel topping.

Flavor-wise, I believe this should be three stars, but I'm giving four stars because its quick, easy and moist. I felt the flavor was lacking because the cinnamon overpowered the cherries.I imagine, with apple pie filling, and the addition of allspice, this may be a tastier dessert. Thanks for sharing.

Very easy, yummy recipe .  Used 1 can peach pie filling and substituted 3/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup milk for the 1 cup oil to lower fat with no problem. Cake was done after 40 min at 350F. Cake was quite brown, but very moist. Entire family enjoyed it. Great with a scoop of ice cream.

I made this for my husband for his birthday.  He really loves apple pie, so I used apples.  I also made my own apple compote instead of buying canned filling.  It turned out really good, so when we did a bake sale at work, I made this into cupcakes, and topped them with vanilla buttercream sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. They were an instant hit! One co-worker even bought six of them.

I made this tonight, with all the good reviews I just had to try it. It was super easy to whip up and it is really good, a little heavy, would have been better with a little ice cream on top. I will make it again with the apple pie filling and then again with the blueberry. Thanks for sharing!

I don't know what I did wrong--I couldn't taste the cherries at all.  The cake was very nice and moist, but no cherry flavor at all.

Mmmmmmmmmmmmm good! Sooooo good and sooooo moist!   What a wonderful cake!  I made it as written, with the Cherry Pie filling and I can't wait to try it with Apple and Peach pie filling.  It could also be served as a coffee cake rather than a dessert.  Thank you for this fantastic recipe!

Not crazy about this - taste was bland and the center of the cake was still mush (I used cherry pie filling).  Of course, I ate the edges anyway but I wouldn't make this for guests.

Followed the recipe exactly and the cake came out well but the taste was only so-so.  Might be better with apple pie filling but don't think I'll bother making it again.  Sorry

Good cake; however I would like to try it again and add some water to the ingredients to try and lighten it up some.  It has a heavy texture
