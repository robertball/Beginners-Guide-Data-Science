Great banana flavor. After reading the reviews I used a loaf pan but also filled 5 muffin cups...bread still got pretty high but did not overflow :) I baked at 375 in my convection oven, the muffins took about 20 minutes, the loaf was spot on at an hour but did darken considerably. I accidentally doubled the allspice but otherwise made no changes. Next time I'll do 6 muffins and tent the loaf with foil. Thanks Mott's!

This was a little dense for me and I guess I prefer a sweeter banana bread, but it went over well with my house guests!

A good recipe if you are looking for a no cholesterol, low fat bread.  However, if you are not you may want to make these changes.  After reading the reviews I made a few changes while trying not to change the structure of the recipe too much.  I added a half a cup of brown sugar and 1 tablespoon of cinnamon, a teaspoon of salt and used the yolks.  The result was good tasting banana bread, but the texture was a little spongey.  I also added a few chocolate chips on the top before baking, because I'm not allowed to make banana bread without chocolate chips.

This was tasty! I do agree w/ happyschmoopies that this could use some more spice (like cinnamon) and a bit of salt, but as is, it was fine. I liked that this used applesauce in place of the oil for a healthier alternative. The kids really liked this, so I would most likely make it again, but add a bit more 'spice'. Thanks for sharing. :)

Made mini muffins (1 tablespoon each, 20 minutes bake)...used brown sugar and then dipped in butter and cinnamon sugar! These are SO good! I did whip the egg whites, and also added the yolks! Mine were light and fluffy!

This was pretty good. The Motts Applesauce made it healthier! I would make some changes next time like adding more allspice and adding cinnamon or nutmeg. I will definitely use applesauce in banana bread again.

This was pretty good!  After reading reviews on how there was too much batter, I halved the recipe and used the same pan.  It came out a little smaller than normal breads but was still great!  And it only needed to bake for 45 minutes instead of the hour.

Wow four bananas for one loaf?! That amount seems like should be for two loaves. And that's what I did based on the reviews. Plus I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, and ginger. The amounts of baking soda and baking powder seem too much too. I do like the idea of applesauce to reduce fat content. I added chopped pecans.

Mine never cooked all the way through, and we kept it in the over for over 80 minutes.  The loaf pan was WAY too full...this would be better suited to muffins or increasing all the ingredients to create two loaves.

I cut this recipe to four servings, and I really meant originally to make it into muffins but forgot at the last minute--thus the small height of my finished product!  I read the other reviews and went heavy on all the flavorings, adding a little pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon to the mix.  I'm sure my little eaters will like this!  Thanks, Mott's!

First off, the loaf pan it calls for is way too small. My batter overflowed all into the bottom of my oven. I'm not sure what I did wrong as I followed the recipe to a T. After about an hour of baking, the top was dark brown but still raw in the very middle. I popped it back in there to finish which made it darker and the outside rubbery (we peeled it off and ate the middle.) It definitely needs more spice and adding in some walnuts wouldn't hurt. I originally rated it at a 2 but after letting it sit, my sons and husband really enjoyed it. I like substituting oil for applesauce - I would just alter some of the other parts of this recipe next time.

This is one of the best banana bread recipes Iâ€™ve used. It is lower in calories but still tastes great. The only change I made was to make half the amount and instead of using a loaf pan I used my mini muffin pan. It made 36 mini muffins which meant 3 mini muffins had 169 calories! I will definitely use this recipe often

This made a lovely moist banana bread that pleased the whole family. I did only make half the recipe given other reviews and that gave me a short loaf, so I think maybe 2/3 of the recipe would be right for the loaf pan I have. I like the idea of adding cinnamon and chocolate chips to the batter as per some of the reviews so will try that next time I make this.

This recipe was just fair for us.  It really lacked flavor and needed more spice & some salt to bring out the flavor.   I used the pan recommended in the recipe, but, my bread rose well above the pan.  I tented the pan with foil partially into cooking because the bread was getting too dark before the inside was cooked.  I also thought the texture seemed a little off for me.   I appreciate using applesauce instead of so much oil that is found in a typical banana bread, but, I do think this recipe needs some tweaking.

It was pretty good. I might add more vanilla and allspice next time for a little more flavor. I also think it would be good with nuts. Overall, though, it's a good fall recipe. Thanks, Mott's.
