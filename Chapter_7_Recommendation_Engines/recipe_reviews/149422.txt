I made this last night to take to a bbq.  Although I started rye bread, I didn't finish it before leaving, so I served in a whole wheat loaf instead.  It is very easy and quick, but it quickly solidifies as it cools, so I think it might be better served in a crockpot or fondue pot.  I thought about using my crockpot, but I only had a 1/4 of the Velveeta called for, so I didn't have enough to put in the crockpot.  It has a good flavor, but I probably should have put in a little more beer.  I was thinking it would be too runny, but it really does thicken up quickly, so probably the more beer the better.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this several times and every time it is always a hit! I find it gets cold and hard if you serve it as suggested...so I have started serving it in a small crock pot!  I have also tried serving with different things...raw veggies, apples and warm soft pretzels.
