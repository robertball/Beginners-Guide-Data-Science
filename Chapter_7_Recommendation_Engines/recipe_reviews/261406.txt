I only added onions to the recipe. The best pasta I have ever taste. It was delicious.

We really liked this dish - it was almost too easy to cook, requires minimal ingredients and makes lots of leftovers! It's also kinda fancy for the minimal effort required! :) 
I used  the frozen Pacific Salmon filets from Costco (only 2 of them = 10oz), I think that next time if I am cooking up a full box of 12 or 16 oz's spaghetti like the recipe calls for, I will bump up the amount of salmon to spread the sauce further and increase the sauce-noodle ratio. 
Cooking for 2, we had enough leftovers for about 4-5 lunch-sized servings after eating this for dinner! YUM!
Definitely keeping in my favorites for a more regular dinner rotation!

Incredibly fast, elegant, delicious! I used milk and added a couple tablespoons of butter as I did not have cream, but next time I will use cream.  I found some "black from tula" tomatoes fresh from the farmer's market, and I really believe they made it special. This is as good as any seafood pasta dish you will get at a great restaurant...and ready in ten minutes? Amazing.

Super quick and easy to make and tastes delicious. I have made this a few times already. The other day I used parsley cause that's what I had at hand instead of the basil and that was tasty, too (though I prefer the basil).
