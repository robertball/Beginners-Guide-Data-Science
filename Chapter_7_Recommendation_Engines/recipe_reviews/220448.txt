All I can say is it is great! We made one batch for tomorrow, and had to make a second batch to take to work as a treat! We used a homemade Irish cream instead of the alchool variety.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I thought this recipe was amazing...I had some concerns because one of the other reviewers said that it had no irish cream flavor...but wow! I tasted it while it was still warm and I was concerned it did not have any Irish cream flavor...so I left it to cool and walked away...it turned into the creamiest, smoothest, fluffy (but still dense?) fudge ever. Make it soon :0)

This is extremely sweet, but oh so tasty!  I have never made real fudge before, but I bought a candy thermometer and followed the recipe to a "T" and it turned out great....in one inch squares...anything bigger is a bit too much for me, but we will be able to enjoy it for a few days at that serving size

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was delicious with just a hint of Irish cream.  The texture was creamy and melt in your mouth.
I will make this one again.

Super easy and straight forward. A candy thermometer and patience are essential for texture and color. If you cook candy too fast, it burns, separates, darkens, becomes granulated and will not set. It must be stirred often. Do not scrape the granulated sides of pan back into the mixture either or this can ruin texture. Mine took over 30 min to reach desired temp. The temps listed here are off also. 238 F is actually 114 C. The goal is to cook to the soft ball stage on a standard candy thermometer. I made these for a St. patrick's day picnic. Yum!

Fantastic! Really smooth.
I skipped the "1 cup white sugar". Plenty sweet without it. Also greasy enough that it will come out of the pan easily, so you can skip the parchment paper and just butter your pan.

This was delicious! I followed the directions exactly, and it turned out perfectly. Yes, it is sweet, but that is to be expected from fudge. The flavor is delicious. To the reviewer who's fudge did not set, make sure you have a good candy thermometer, or it is difficult to know when it is done.  

I have been searching for Christmas candy recipes that don't involve nuts (due to a nut allergy) and this is going to be added to our new traditions. Thank you so much!

Great taste! Followed exactly, except I took it to the soft ball temperature mark on my thermometer.

This fudge was super yummy! I needed to add powdered sugar to help it set, but that's because I live at a high altitude. I highly recommend this recipe.

I didn't use Irish Cream.  Recipe worked fine without it!!  I even used a meat thermometer instead of a candy one, which was tricky and not as accurate, but it still worked!!  My sons were thrilled!

I don't normally make candy or deserts like this but did for Christmas. Recipe worked perfect. I used a local product, Mary Hite Bowman cream liquer so it has a mild burbon flavor.

I really wanted to like this recipe. I am certainly not an experienced candy/ fudge cook so I'm sure some of this went wrong due to my errors, but I was pretty disappointed. The fudge never solidified, even after 5 hours and time in the fridge, and it did not come out the cream color as shown in the picture, it was much more of a caramel color and it tastes like caramel too, which covers over the flavor of the Irish cream completely. It is also MUCH too sweet for my tastes, but I should have expected that with over 4 cups of sugar in the recipe!
