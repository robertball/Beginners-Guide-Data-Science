Delicious! There's definately not enough crust to cover a pan. I followed the directions exactly and my crust was burned after 15 min. By the end of cooking, it was inedible. But the pie filling was excellent. My recommendation is to double the entire recipe. Bake the crust for only 5 min and add 10-15 min cook time to the pie filling. Once out, let it stand for at least 1/2 hr. Pumpkin sets better over time.

I changed this up a bit.  Instead of using a 15 ounce can of pumpkin, I used a 30 oz can, doubled the spices, and baked for 50 minutes.  I got a much deeper dish square that has gotten much acclaim.

I loved this recipe!  My boyfriend loved it, too!  It's about as close as you can come to pumpkin pie without all the laborious steps it takes to achieve a great pie.  As I'm health conscious when it comes to recipes, I substituted the evaporated milk with the same amount of soy milk and trimmed the butter by half for the crust.  The pumpkin mixture added the perfect amount of moistness to the recipe that no one knew that I'd revised the recipe.  Great all around and super quick!  Try it--it's the next best thing to pumpkin pie without all the hassle!

A new family favorite!! I found there wasn't enough crust to fit a 9x13 pan.  Did anyone else have the same problem? The crust fit better in a 9x9 and I also had to bake the filling for 20 minutes longer to set it.

This is the best pumpkin recipe I've ever tried! My family begs me to make it frequently and it's easy to put together. Some tips: I read a few reviews that the filling didn't get firm enough.This is because the dessert really needs to chill thoroughly. But even then,it's not supposed to be a finger food. Also, I added a litle freshly grated nutmeg and a 1/4 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. 
 This is absolutely delicious.. I haven't made a pumpkin pie since I found this recipe ! I give it 5 stars !!

This is a fantastic recipe, but my experience may help you decide whether you want to double the crust, double the pumpkin filling, or keep the recipe as is... I made this twice in a span of three days. The first time I followed the recipe to the letter. It was indeed just enough crust to cover the bottom of a 9x13 pan, so the crust was very thin. The filling was also very very thin (not like the main picture shown - which is thicker than what I came out with). Still, the squares were absolutely delicious - the crust was perfect with just a bit of crunch which made it really lovely. I did think to myself that I would like just a tad more filling. Soooo... I made it a second time and doubled the recipe. I made it in two smaller pans (an odd size - around 5x13 I think). While it was nice to have a little more filling, the crust is MUCH NICER as is. The thicker crust did not come out with the same crunchiness that we so enjoyed the first time. It just wasn't as nice. **** So, all in all, a fab recipe, but I might recommend keeping the crust as is and then increasing the filling by 50%. Also, it is much better once it is thoroughly chilled. Enjoy!

Great recipe. Had to bake it for 10 more minutes than the recipe called for, to make sure the pumpkin layer is set. Goes wonderfully with some whipped cream on top. Cool and refreshing, too.

I followed some others' suggestions and put this in an 8x8 pan. That made this dessert very much like pumpkin pie and much less like bars. My pumpkin lover husband loved it though!

Excellent! Tried them at a Halloween party and everyone loved them.  I almost did not have enough batter for the crust and may increase it by 1/4.  Needed to cook 10 minutes longer than recipe indicates - keep checking it!

These squares will replace my regular pie for most occasions. The crust is delicious. (I like it better than regular crust.) I used a 9 x 13 inch glass baking dish and the crust amount was just enough. (I had to use clean fingers to press in the crust; a spoon wasn't working well.)  I don't think that the crust itself needs to bake 15 minutes; I might try cutting it down to 10 minutes next time. I also had to bake the filled crust approximately  10 extra minutes to get it to set properly. Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe my whole family loved them, and they can be hard to please! The crust was a perfect combination with the spiced pumkin layer.I also used soy milk instead of evaporated milk, and it turned out great. Thank you for a great recipe.

These were excellent!!  I didn't change any ingredients, I just made a double batch and put it all in a 9x13 pan and cooked them for about 10 minutes longer.

I made this into tarts as there was no way the crust mixture was going to be enough for a 9x13 pan. As it happens, the recipe divided between 24 muffin cups was perfect. I just found the overall result rather bland, especially the crust, which was heavy and flavorless. I think I'll stick to the always rich and flavorful traditional pumpkin pie.

This was sooooo good.....we substituted the sugar for splenda and the flour for whole wheat white flour and the butter for smart balance and the brown sugar for brown sugar splenda to make it a little healthier.  This was Southbeach Diet friendly this way!!

These bars are delicious!  I followed other reviewer’s suggestions and doubled the crust.  I substituted the 2 cups of flour for 1 ¾ cups of whole-wheat flour and ¼ cup ground flax seed.  The end result was a mild nutty flavored crust, which compliments the pumpkin nicely.  I also had to increase the cooking time for the pumpkim mixture from 20 to 35 minutes.  I enjoy making pumpkin pie, but with this recipe I’ll think twice.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I absolutely loved loved loved this recipe.  I made the crust nearly as written, just decreased sugar to 1/4 C, and believe me, you could not tell.  I made the same adjustment with the filling, decreasing the sugar to 1/2 C, and did not miss anything.  I will be making this often.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Our family has made this recipe for years! Not sure why the crust didn't work for others; works for me (but we don't cream it together, we just cut in the butter w/pastry cutter)

These are wonderful and easier than pumpkin pie! I couldn't believe how fast they disappeared. I baked the pumpkin filling 15-20 minutes longer than it said and they were perfect.

I have made these for Thanksgiving dinner several times. They are small and nice to serve when there are several desserts to choose from. Tastes just like pumpkin pie with a "nutty" crust that is better than pie crust. I use an 11 X 7 baking pan for better crust coverage. Just before serving I garnish each square with aerosol whipped cream "blossoms" & dust with a light coating of cinnamon. Family favorite!

Yum yum yum YUM!  This is the perfect recipe for when you are craving a pumpkin pie in little bite sized pieces.  I used margarine (for cholesterol reasons, I know.. blasphemy), and I cut the brown sugar in the crust to about 1/4 cup.  I didn't have a hand mixer (just moved, so it's not in sight), but beating/creaming by hand, with a whisk, was not difficult.  The "crust" was jsut about enough for a 9x13 pan, although I had added 1/4 cup more oats because the reviews said the dough was short for that pan size.  You just need to press it in thin, but it's still a decent thickness - and it seemed to poof a bit in the oven.  For the pumpkin part, I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, and added fresh ground nutmeg to the spices, as well.  The only issue I had with this recipe was the baking time.  At 20 minutes, the center was barely set.  At 30 minutes, it began to set, and at 40 minutes it seemed to be set enough to remove.  The edges were beginning to brown, so I had to reduce to 325 to avoid burnt edges.  It's a new oven (see above, new house) :)  so it may have just been my issue, not the recipe.  Regardless, I will be making this again!  It's so creamy, yummy, and so cozy on these unseasonably cool temps we've been having in California. :)

Looooove this recipe, tastes great. I cooked the crust a little longer, 20 minutes so the squares were crispy enough to pick up and eat. It only lasts one day in my house. Great alternative to pumpkin pie when I am out of crust. I always substitute Splenda sugar or Splenda brown sugar and fat free condensed milk and it works great. A little healthier as I am diabetic.

I found that the crust was perfect for my 9x13 pan, I don't know how anyone found it wasn't enough to cover the pan! I did need to bake longer, though, it was so liquid-y after 20 minutes, I ended up adding 3 minutes at a time until it was more "done" looking. It was about 35 minutes bake time.  Followed all other directions and it came out great!

Y U M these were so good!  I took the advise of many and used a square pan rather than a 9x13 - the crust would have been tough in a bigger pan. As a result the filling was taller and did require a lot more cooking time (roughly 30-40min more) but these are well worth it, so very good!!

YUM!  This is a great sub for pumpkin pie when you have to feed a crowd.  Followed the directions exactly as stated, except doubled the crust per other reviewers advice and was very glad that I did because as written there is NO WAY it would have been enough.  Everyone at dinner loved it!  :)

Fabulous recipe!!  I made a few changes - for the rolled oats, I used a packet of instant oatmeal, cinnamon & spice flavour.  Next time I'll cut down a bit on the sugar in the crust - the instant oatmeal is already sweetened.  I couldn't find plain pumpkin, so I used a can of pumpkin pie filling, and left out the spices.  I also used a smaller pan, so it took 50 minutes to bake.  And it certainly was worth the wait!!  These are just too good!!  Thanks for the recipe!

I used fresh pumpkin and a lot of extra seasoning but I will substitute brown sugar in the pumpkin instead of white the next time.

these were perfect and fast, my only change would be to use a 9x9 dish, for a thicker more sturdy crust and thicker custard layer.

This was wonderful and really EASY.  I used a 9x13 pan and was just enough crust.  I wouldn't want more crust as it would overpower the pumpkin.  I did add 1 1/2 t. pumpkin pie spice, along with the other spices.  Just added a little more zing to it.  Will make this again  soon.   Thanks

This recipe is a keeper.  Instead of canned pumpkin I used pureed pumpkin.  Since it is a little more liquidy, I didn't use all of the evaporated milk - maybe about half the can. I used a 9X9 pan and baked it for 45-50 minutes, until set. Yummy!!!

This was very easy to make and very tasty!! I also made mine in a 9x9 pan and it turned out great! I cooked the the filling for about 35 mins, just kind of kept checking it after 20 mins. (definitely not ready in 20 mins.) 
This is a keeper!! My 10 year old daughter helped me with it and had 2 pieces after dinner! Serve with cool whip! Mmm Good! Thanks for a great fall desert!!

I made this exactly as directed. There was just enough crumb mixture to spread into a 13X9 easily. I sprinkled the entire pan with the crumbs evenly and then pressed them down with my fingers; it took a total of 1 minute. When baked the filling was about the same thickness as the crust. The crust was not crispy; it more resembled a pie crust that was not fully baked and not flaky. When I make this again I will try baking the crust until it starts to look brown around the edges and I will use pumpkin pie spice instead of the other spices.  I would say that this would serve 10-12 as dessert when topped with some whipped cream and a dash of cinnamon.

I followed this recipe to the T (although I had to cook mine 40+ minutes after I added the pumpkin mixture) and it was delicious!  For those concerned about not enough dough for the crust... just crumble up the dough in your hand as you spread it over the pan.  Then press the dough into the pan like you would rice krispy bars.  Using that method the dough was a perfect fit for the 9x12 pan.   It wasn't a surprise that it had to cook longer, a pumpkin pie which is only slightly deeper than this normally cooks for 40-50 minutes.  We will definitely make this again!

I don't know if I will ever make regular pumpkin pie again. I first made it for a retreat weekend to which everyone brought food and snacks and these squares got unanimous rave reviews. I've made them many times since with the same response. They're incredibly quick and simple to make, easy to serve, and have a delicious pumpkin pie flavor and texture. They are wonderful for occasions like Thanksgiving when there are likely to be many desserts, because people can have "just a taste" rather than taking a whole large slice of pie.

What a fabulous alternative to pumpkin pie. I added a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg but otherwise made the recipe as is. Like other reviewers suggested, I used a 8x8" pan to make these more substantial. Because the batter was thicker this way, I did need to bake this for 50 minutes. It took several hours to chill and firm up. It was worth the wait. The oatmeal crust was a great complement to the pumpkin. These will disappear fast in our house.

Easy... crust perfect fit for me no problems it is so easy I just shook the pan to spread out and patted it down!  Baked the crust the 15min I have a oven thermometer so I always have the right temp dont trust your dial on the oven.  Baked a few minutes longer...  Excellent!!  Give this recipe a try, two thumbs up.

The bottom did not cook well, creating an overall very mushy dessert.  Taste was pretty good...a little sweet.

I baked this in a 9 by 9 pan, as suggested, and baked it beforehand for 15 minutes as suggested before adding the filling.  As these were more dense using a smaller pan, I had to bake much longer than suggested, and the crust ended up a bit too dark, so as suggested I would probably eliminate the crust baking the next go around or maybe limit it to 5 minutes, as the crust needs to be cooked but not overbrowned.  The taste was like pumpkin pie, but I might try the addition of nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice.

This was a big hit at my company's Halloween party! I cooked the filling for 40 minutes, instead of the 20 the recipe recommends. I was a little disappointed because the crust didn't come out of the pan very easily but maybe I'll grease it next time. This recipe is definitely going to be a staple in our house!

These were very good and were easy to prepare.  I had to adjust the cooking time, however, 20 minutes was not enough to "set" the squares.  These are definitely a repeat recipe.

This was just soooo incredibly good! Its just as good if not BETTER than pumpkin pie! I made as written and it was just fine for me. I did use fresh nutmeg and added a little extra cinnamon and ginger for flavor and that worked out well. It takes A LOT longer to cook and set the crust, and same problem with the filling. You basically need to double both cooking times just as a starting point. Next time I might double the crust and add more sugar to the filling because although its not too sweet you could make it sweeter if you wanted.......Don't be scared of the filling, when you add the evaporated milk it seems SO thin! Thin like soup.....thats ok! It will reduce and leave a thick rich filling. (Hence why its a 40 min cook time and not 20 as listed)

This recipe is fantastic!!!! And easy! And forgiving.  I'm never making any other kind of pumpkin pie again.  After reading the reviews, I was afraid there wouldn't be enough crust to cover the bottom, so I simply added 1/2 cup flour.  With that change, I had enough crust.  Second, I did not have evaporated milk, so I just used what I had on hand: milk and a few tablespoons of half and half.  I'm going to try using plain milk next time.  FYI it took 40 minutes in the oven for my filling to set.  I also cooled it thoroughly in the fridge after cooling it on the counter.  SO YUMMY.

This was good.  I made this twice in the last couple of weeks.  I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the the spices listed.  I'll make again.  I made the first batch into bars and used cupcake liners to make individual servings the second time.  Both turned out great.

These were good! I'm not sure why i was expecting something a little different than pumpkin pie in bar form, but i guess i was a little disappointed that it was EXACTLY pumpkin pie in a square shape instead of triangle. The crust was different, and good, but i think i prefer the traditional pie crust. But totally not a bad recipe! We ate it all. :)

I doubled all ingredients, used pumpkin pie spice, omitted salt. I also sprayed my pan before adding crust. I followed the other idea of baking the crust 5 minutes before adding pumpkin. Just kept checking it to make sure it didn't burn. Everyone at work raved about it.

This recipe is amazing! I made it for an dessert auction and everyone loved it. My only suggestion is doubling the crust recipe. Otherwise it to thin to really support the filling when you cut it. Enjoy!!

Made the crust as described in a 9 X 13 except I baked it for about 25 minutes. Doubled the pumpkin mixture - made it with fresh pumpkin I had previously baked in the oven. Put it back in the oven for about 40 minutes when the pumpkin mixture set. No problem at all cutting it into bars, not even when I couldn't wait and cut into it before it even cooled completely.

these were OK, i cut the recipe in half but accidently added the full amount of spices and salt. I like spicy so that wasn't a problem. The pumpkin never quite firmed up. probably wouldn't make again.

I also doubled the filling andbaked longer, my oven must be off because I had to bake it for  70 min (checking on it after 50 min. to be sure), then refridgerated it over night and it was perfect! The crust was plenty big enough to cover my 9x13 and everyone was asking for more!

Made these for the first time today and they're delicious! I followed some suggestions from other bakers: increased the crust by a ratio of 1.5, but only kept the brown sugar to 2/3 cup (I don't like my baked goods too sweet). Baked the crust for 12 minutes. Followed the recipe as written for the filling except only used 1/2 cup white sugar. Baked the whole thing for 30 minutes, then let cool for a few hours before cutting into it. Will definitely make again!

Very good and easy to make.  Followed recipe exactly--had to bake a little longer than 20 minutes, in order for it to set.

Based on others reviews, I too modified slightly.  For the crust portion, I used slightly more than 1/2 cup of oatmeal - there was plenty for a crust in the 13 x 9 glass pan that I used.  I also added more pumpkin and an additional egg for binding and increased spices accordingly.  It was great!

This was very good.  I used this recipe and baked it in a 8x8, which I think was perfect.  The crust did take 15 min to cook, but the filling took at least 45 min to set (probably because I used an 8x8 instead of the 9x13).  I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar in the filling.  I am not a big clove fan but the filling requires it for that pumpkin pie taste.  Must refrigerate until it is cold and also must serve cold.  A dollop of whip cream on each bar is a nice addition.

I doubled the crust recipe and added walnuts and a little cinnamon.  Yum!  I also substituted splenda brown sugar and white sugar for the required sugar.  The baking times were perfect.  These are great!

Yummy, but I only added 1/2 c butter and reduced sugar by 1/3 c.
The secnod time i did it, it wasn't that good. So maybe third time's a charm....we'll see.

Great to use as starter recipe... I agree the crust ingredients weren't enough for a 9x13", but I did half again as much (3/4 c. butter, 3/4 c. bro sugar & 1 1/2 c. flour total) and it was just right.  I used squash (we call it crook-neck, not sure of the official name for it) that we had in freezer from last fall in place of pumpkin, and despite it being alot more moist, the flavor and texture was great in the finished product.  Baked it right at an hour. Probably could've gone a little less but with the recent egg recalls I wanted to make sure it was completely cooked through.

These were amazing!  My family started digging in to them before they were even cooled.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe and had no problems.  I actually made a double batch of the filling, used 1/2 for this recipe and the other 1/2 for a pumpkin pie.  The Pumpkin Pie squares are gone and the pie is still in the refridgerator, the family preferred the squares.

Excellent!  Made this recipe exactly as stated and it came out fabulous - no changes needed.  Crust is thin when pressed into a 9x13 pan but that is at it should be.  A keeper for sure!

I doubled this recipe, both the base and the filling and used soy milk, added more spices. Loved the base as I substituted some almond flour for the regular flour and a tad of vanilla. Put it in a 9 x 13 pan and had to bake it for 70 minutes. Quick and easy to make.

I used a square pan rather than the 9x13 so had ample crust. The filling needs some refining though as it seems to be either missing or lacking something. Otherwise, a very simple recipe!

I thought theese were really good.  I had plenty of crust.  I melted the butter all the way instead of creaming it.  That might be why i had plenty of crust for a full 9x13.  Anyways, i followed the recipe as is and needed to bake filling about 5 minutes longer than stated.  I am in Houston tx so the humidity could have played a factor in bake time.  Everyone should try this though.  I probably will never go through the trouble of making pumpkin pie again.  This is just as good and alot quicker. Thanks!

I doubled the crust recipe per other reviewers suggestion but I was disappointed. I didn't double the entire recipe and should have because the pumpkin filling wasn't enough for how thick the crust ended up. I used a 9 X 13 in pan and if your not doubling the recipe I would go ahead and put the mixture into a 9 inch baking pan.   I wasn't a big fan of the crust but my husband loved the squares and he is a hard judge! Overall, I would make again because it is reminiscent of a pumpkin pie, without having to deal with making a pie crust, letting it rest and rolling it out. SO easy!!!!!

The recipe as is, wouldn't work very well.  I doubled both the crust and filling as suggested by others.  I baked the crust 10 minutes before adding the filling and then returned it to the oven for 50 minutes at 350 degrees.  These are absolutely delicious. One other change I also made was that I used 1 c half and half in place of the second can of condensed milk, because I only had one.

I improved this recipe by adding a topping!  After Step 4., Combine 1/2 cup chopped pecans, 1/2 cup brown sugar, & 2Tbsp. butter.  Sprinkle over baked pie.  Return to oven bake for 15-20 minutes or until filling is set.  Serve with whipped topping.  Delicious!

I used a 9x13 pan and the crust on the bottom turned out hard.  The crust also wasn't very sweet.  The top was fine--could have used more spices--basically pumpkin pie on top.  I think I'll stick to pumpkin pie--didn't like the crust on this one at all.

I added chopped walnuts to the crust to make it more firm. The pumpkin texture was good. However I thought the pumpkin needed additional spices. Next time I will add 1/2 tsp nutmeg or 1/2 tsp allspice.

I thought this was just OK, although my daughter liked it a lot.  I used quick oats instead of rolled, which was good, but I increased the crust recipe by half because I was afraid I wouldn't have enough for the 9x13 pan, as some said it was cutting it close.  Wish I hadn't done that, as it made the crust too thick.  (One reviewer DOUBLED the crust??  Yikes...)  My daughter says I should have also doubled the filling to go with the thicker crust, because the filling and the crust at this point were the same thickness (approx. 3/8" each).  A bit too thin for the pumpkin, I thought.  However, I had no problem baking the filling for only 1/2 hour as directed - perfect amount of time to set it. This filling recipe is the exact same as on my can of pumpkin for making pie.  I *might* make this again, but next time I'd try the original crust recipe and see how I like it then.  Maybe also put it in a smaller pan to have a thicker pumpkin filling.

These squares were a big hit at a Christmas party for friends here in Japan.  They tasted just like pumpkin pie, without all the fuss!  I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned and cut back the sugar in the filling to 1/2 cup.  They did not last long...people (me especially) could not get enough!

My family loved this.  I don't know what people were doing wrong when they said they didn't have enough crust mix to cover the bottom of the 9"x13" pan, but I had a perfect amount.  I baked it for only about 10 of the 15 minutes before adding the pumpkin filling though, and then I baked the entire thing for 28 minutes vs 20 minutes.  I also added 1/4 t. of nutmeg.  I will be making this again, it was much better than traditional pumpkin pie.   I think the crust is what made it so good. 
I'd also like to try a cherry filling as well.

This is a fabulous alternative to pumpkin pie. However, I wish I had not followed  the advice to double the crust. Based on the reviews I read, I doubled the crust ingredients and the end result was too much crust and not enough filling.

As many other reviewers stated, it is not enough crust. Once I noticed , I doubled the recipe for the crust. I did have to bake it for longer, about 7 min. I would say just watch it and check every 5 min. Everything else about the recipe is excellent.

I made this recipe in a cookie sheet and a 8' round cake pan, which I  still had leftover pumpkin, that I just baked in dish. After baking,  I used rolling pin on crust to flatten and it was perfect for edging. I baked longer, till I felt it was done. Cut into squares and set in freezer for a bit before moving. Excellent!!!

Very good; think I would add some spice to the crust when I make it again

I serve this to the kids at my daycare with a little whipped cream.  They love it!  I use nutmeg instead of cloves.  I usually let the crust bake a little longer and also with the filling.

I'm wondering if the recipe was changed since the reviews that said the crust was too thin. I made a 9x13 and there was definitely enough crust - more than i expected. I also really liked the taste of the filling, though I did bake it about 10 minutes longer than the recipe said. The only thing I would say is to spray the pan with cooking spray before putting the crust in, just to make it a little easier to get out the squares. I didn't spray it and it still comes out moderately easily, but spray would help. Overall, it was really good.

I didn't modify this recipe and we loved it.  Easier than making a whole pie, but still super yummy.  The crust was a little sweet for me but it was good.  Not sure why others say there wasn't enough to cover the pan... I had plenty and followed the recipe exactly.

Looked good & smelled good but bake time is WAY off! Double the baking time. (Think about it.... this uses a pumpkin pie filling recipe, and most pumpkin pies start out at 425 for about 10 minutes, then you reduce heat to 350 and bake for another 40-45 minutes. Yes, in an oblong pan, these bars aren't as thick. Still... I recommend starting it at 425, reduce to 350 after 5 minutes, and bake for 35 more minutes, and MAYBE your bars will be properly set and cooked through. Also, you really have to press the oat crust very thin to make it cover the pan. I would increase the crust ingredients by one-third to make sure there was enough.

I was hesitant to give this recipe five stars, but it was so delicious I felt I had to.  Why I was hesitant was because of the major changes I made in the proportion of the ingredients.  Following the advice of another reviewer, I kept the amount of crust the same, but increased the amount of filling (in this case by 50%).  I did not increase the amount of sugar in the filling.  I had to bake it for a lot longer than the recipe called for because of this change.  I baked the crust for about 7 minutes, and the filling I kept checking every 12-15 minutes after an initial 30 minutes until it was set.  As described, the crust came out crispy, and the top was like pumpkin pie.  I like this recipe better than pumpkin pie and would serve it instead.

I also found the the first layer was not big enough to cover a 9x13 pan, so I used a 9x9, made for a thicker  square, cooked an additional 15 minutes to accommodate the smaller pan.

I made this recipe gluten free by using a GF flour mix and subbing ground walnuts for the oats. Nice and easy recipe that feeds a lot of people. Oh, had to bake for 40 minutes and not 20 for it to set up. I would definitely count on a longer bake time so decrease the crust prebake time to 10 minutes instead of 15.  Thanks~

Prepared as written for Thanksgiving dessert and went over very well w/ both family and friends. You can't beat this dessert for the calories per serving. There are many other recipes out there at 3x the calories, but this can't be beat for the taste!

Great flavor.  Needed a little extra time in the oven to set.  I took mine out too soon and they were very loose when served.  Still got rave reviews and a request to use the crust from now on in all pumpkin pies.

I shortened the crust cooking time by 5 minutes based on other reviewers assessment of hard crust. Added a dash of nutmeg and a dash of molasses to the filling. Had to bake an extra 10-15 minutes to set the filling - maybe because my organic canned pumpkin seemed less firm than regular canned pumpkin.

I thought with all the good reviews I would make them for Xmas ... what a mistake. I made the recipe as written with the exception of cooking it in a smaller pan (8x8) as so many recommended. The base stuck to the pan making it impossible to cut them out. I cooked the filling twice as long and chilled completely and it was still loose. The flavor of the filling was good and I did manage to pry a piece of crust up to taste it and I found it to be a bit too sweet.

I forgot to make dessert today so i whipped this up in just a few minutes. i had sweetened condensed milk not evaporated milk so i used that and skipped the sugar. It came out fantastic if i do say so myself =). I remember last time i made this i used less sugar in the crust and less butter. i did the same this time using 1/4 cup of butter an just a little less than a half cup brown sugar.

Very tasty!  Be sure to not bake the bottom too much because when it cooks for too long, it makes it VERY difficult to cut into.  I took other people's suggestions and cooked it for longer than recommended, and this was a bad idea.  Stick to the initial timing.  I used more pumpkin puree (doubled almost everything because I had a big baking dish), so it took almost an hour to cook and fully set.

Delicious! The crust *just* covers the pan so if you are looking for a bar with a denser base, do as other reviewers have suggested and double the crust.

I followed the recipe exactly for the filling and put it into an extra large graham cracker pie crust. It took much longer to bake and still was very soft and the filling was so moist it made the graham cracker crust soggy. I liked the flavor of it but didn't have much luck with the recipe.

I used a real (baking? sugar? pie?) pumpkin - baked & scooped it first, then pureed it in the food processor - but other than that, I followed the recipe as written. (Except, oh, I realized I didn't have evaporated milk so I used regular milk). It turned out really tasty, but a little different from regular pumpkin pie. The difference is the crust -- it was more like eating a thin layer (half-inch) of pumpkin pie filling atop a standard oatmeal cookie. Not bad, but different. My husband called it a "pumpkin cobbler."  Of note, the filling was really liquidy when I poured it into the crust - much more liquidy than when I make a pie using canned pumpkin. It was basically the consistency of milk. I was really worried about it setting right, but it did fine (I added about 10 minutes to the cook time). I baked it in a 13''x9'' pan and felt the crust depth was fine as written. (My filling seemed to soak into the crust a bit -- which is probably what made it cobbler-like -- there was almost a middle layer of pumpkin-infused oatmealy yumminess.) I will make this recipe again because it satisfies my pumpkin-pie craving and is way easier than making a crust (healthier, too).

I doubled the crust like I had read in some reviews and it was a HUGE mistake. It added cooking time onto the crust AND onto the pumpkin part. By the time it "finished" cooking, the crust was inedible. On top of that, the crust had little to no flavor. I would have been better off just making pumpkin pie my usual yummy way.

Great tasting recipe.  I definitely suggest doubling the base (don't need all the sugar, though) and adjusting the spices up a tiny bit.

So yummy! I love the pumpkin filling. I used 2.2 quart dish instead of a 9x13 after reading other reviews and I thought the filling was thick and the crust was too. I actually really liked the crust, despite what some other reviews said. I did have to cook the squares for about a 1/2 hour, maybe a little more. Just kept checking them. I though they were delicious and will make them again.

FLAWED RECIPE, but great concept. As other reviewers stated, the crust does not need to be baked for such a long time before hand. There was so little pumpkin that I doubled the pumpkin filling and that seems to make everything better. I much prefer the pumpkin/cheesecake bars over these.

This recipe is pretty good, I changed it up a bit based on some other people's recommendations. First I added a few drops of maple (you could also use vanilla) extract to the crust. I also put it in a square 8x8 pan. I put a bit more cinnamon than stated as well. It cam out pretty good, just like bit size pumpkin pies!

I doubled it in a 9x13, so that probably screwed it up somewhat, but I didn't like the texture and the flavor was boring.

I am not a huge pumpkin pie fan...but my husband is..and he loves these!!  They are really easy to make, and even "special" enough for company. I use an 8 x 8 pan so the bars turn out thicker.....you have to bake them longer....just take them out when the filling is set.

Super Great RECIPE! I found that I had to also bake it about 10 minutes longer for the pumpkin to set nicely. The crust was great! Although very thin & you have to work a little to spread it out evenly, it held the filling well when you picked it up as (large cut pieces of) finger food. This is going in my s'more recipe list - need to fix "some-more!"

Great recipe! I didn't have the right size pan so I used a 7" x 11". These were definitely thick! I really enjoy a good crust but I should have cooked it a little bit longer. The smaller pan made me have to cook the pumpkin part QUITE a bit longer but it got rave reviews. Next time I would crush the "old fashioned" oats a little before hand to give it a more uniform texture all the way around.

Very good, and so nice not to have to dirty up my counters making a crust.  They were the hit of the Halloween party.

I did use an 8 x 11 pan, based on other reviews, and so I had to about double the cooking time.  However, I think I probably could have made the crust stretch to fit in a 9 x 13.  If you want a real thin crust, then use the larger pan.

The filling was delish, but needed to be cooked longer than 20 minutes (more like 35-40 minutes.)  I agree with others that the crust just didn't work with this.  Perhaps a "cookie dough" type would work better.  I also took other's advice and used a smaller pan which made for a thicker crust and filling.

Excellent! Used a 7x11.5 pan and it turned out perfectly. Baked the crust for 18 min, then added 10 min to the total bake time. 4 people have tried it so far and are in love!

This is an excellent pumpkin pie altrnative when you're out of round pie pans.  The oat crust makes me people say "Wow, that is so good - what is it?"  Easy.

These are fabulous!!  My three yr old hates "spicy" pumpkin pie so I did 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead and it was perfect!  I also added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  My hubby loved the crust.

I enjoy this as is, with the thinner crust.  Always adding a lot more spices, including cloves.  Penzey's Apple Pie Spice added to the crust ingredients (2 different cinnamons, nutmeg and mace).  Usually end up baking this for almost 40 minutes.

I would have given this recipe 5 stars, but there isn't enough crust as written, I doubled the crust the second time I made it, and it was MUCH better and a lot easier to serve.  Great with some whipped cream and cinnamon sprinkled on top.  I will be making this through Christmas!

I made this dessert yesterday and it turned out perfect. The group I served it to really enjoyed it.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used a 14 oz can of pumpkin (I happened to have this size in my cupboard).

A good recipe for serving lots of people since you can make the squares as big or small as you want. Otherwise, it took the same (if not more) effort than making a pie. The cooking time was way off. In fact, I served them a bit under cooked, but thankfully, no one complained.

Good flavor but light.  The crust was so good there should have been more of it.  It needed to be thicker.  As others have said, it does need to cook longer than the recipes states.  But this one's a keeper.

These bars were pretty good, but not perfect.  They didn't make it to my "keep" pile.  The pumpkin part was great tasting, but the crust was weird.  Even though I more than doubled the cooking time, the crust seemed like an uncooked cookie.

This tastes really good, just like pumpkin pie. I would have liked the crust to be a little crisper, perhaps I will try to cook it longer, the filling definately needs to be cooked longer too.

I think better than traditional pumpkin pie. The oatmeal crust is delicious and easier than rolling a crust. The praline pecan top adds a wonderful crunch.

I love the idea of the pumpkin pie squares and they keep their shape great.  I like the crust and the filling separately, but I think next time I will try a reqular pie crust in an 8x8 with the same filling.  Using one of the crusts you buy in the refridgerator section should make it simple.

I have made a couple of times.  I did not change anything on the recipe,  but it definitely took longer then 20 minutes to cook, and I only precooked crust for 5 minutes. 
Everybody loves it, especially the crust.

I tried it exactly as written, and it was great!  I don't know if the crust quantities have been rewritten, but there is absolutely plenty of crust to cover a 9x13 pan.  I used rolled oats (as specified in the recipe), which I've learned is not the same as oatmeal.  Oatmeal cooks faster than rolled oats, so maybe that's why others had problems with their crust burning after 15 minutes.  I did have to leave the pumpkin topping in for 30 minutes rather than 20, but other than that, it was a delicious dessert as written, and I received lots of compliments on it!

I will cut crust ingredients to half and use 9” pan.  The filling was not much thicker than the crust using a 9x13 pan.  I like thicker pumpkin and less crust.  I also added 1/4 teaspoon cardamom tp pumpkin filling.

Just made this and it was excellent!  Not sure why so many are having trouble with the crust.  I followed as written and it turned out perfect.  What I would highly recommend is to add all crust ingredients into a bowl adding the butter last , do not cream butter and sugar first as suggested.  Work crust together with a fork like you are making a crumble and press into the pan.  There was plenty of crust to fit into a 13x9 pan.  I checked the crust after 10mins and then baked for another 5mins.  I baked the pumpkin topping for 20mins and chilled for about 3 hrs.  My family loved it !!

I will definitely make this again.  It was like a pumpkin pie and custard mixed.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about and needs some work is the crust.  I didn't feel like the two married too well.  The crust had a very definite flavor and I tasted it above and separate from the pie portion.  I was the only one who had anything negative to say so maybe it was just me. They were really, really good!

I HATE when people change the recipes...okay with that being said...I changed the crust! I used graham crackers and chopped pecans. I used 1 sleeve of grahams 1 1/2 sticks of butter and about 3/4 cup crushed pecans. I melted the butter in a 9x13 pan in the oven just until melted.  While that was melting I crushed up the grahams added the crushed pecans and about 1/4 cup sugar. When the butter was melted I added the crumbs and made certain they were  patted down well. Baked them about 10mins just until light brown. I let it set until cool then added the filling of which I did double. Yummmmy!!!

This tasted wonderful! I loved the crust. I have a glass pan slightly smaller than 9x13.  I had plenty of crust to fill it.  Followed the recipe exactly. Cooking time was different. I have a convection oven and I had to cook it 35 extra minutes.

Followed the receipe Except  I had to use ED Smith pie filling thus skipped the spices., I didI add 1/8 tsp Chinese 5 spice.
No issues with the crust amount or baking time. Used the 9 X 11 pan sprayed with Pam with flour for baking. This was a test run for our  museum bake sale next week. This one will disappear right here at home! Very good quick way to get my pumpkin pie  fix. My youngest son is going to really like this. I served it with whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon. Oh the bake time was 35 mins. in our oven.

Delicious.  I made these into heart shaped cupcakes.  I followed the advice of making sure the crust is cold (i put the tray in the freezer for 10 minutes) and it came out nice and crunchy.  I had to cook them for about 50 minutes.

Loved this recipe! My kids loved it and this inspired me to make it for church. We gave muffin size pies out and it was definately a favorite. Needed to make the batch of crust a little larger as it wasn't enough crust but overall it was delicious.will make it again for thanksgiving

Very good and tastes just like pumpkin pie!  My crust needed about 12 minutes and the pie portion needed 30.  I accidentally used white sugar in the crust, but it was still delicious.  Very easy and would certainly make again!

Loved it! Easy to make.  Took a lot longer than 20 minutes to bake the second time and get the center firm.  I modified the spices a bit for more flavor.. 
2 tsp cinnamon, 2 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp ginger and 1/2 of cloves.  Yummy!

I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to add a bit more flavour . This turned out well and was a hit at Thanksgiving dinner. It needed more baking to make the filling more solid though...

Simple easy and tastes great.  I'm lactose intolerant so i substituted soy milk and used 1/2 cup cornstarch to get things a little thicker, also used dairy free alternative butter.  Everything turned out excellent!

These are simply amazing. Pumpkin Pie Meets Oatmeal Cookie!  I read a lot of the reviews first, and decided to make it as written, but with the exception of using a 9x9 pan. Perfect crust, and perfect filling. I had to leave it in the oven an extra 20 minutes because it was thicker in the smaller pan. I let it cool, then refrigerated before cutting. Served with ice cream or whip cream & everyone devoured it.

I did make double the crust which fit with all the filling. I also omitted all the spices and did 1 Tspoon of pumpkin pie spice. It was very good. Also it did take about 45 minutes to cook so the filling was set. I also put small hokes in the bottom of the crust before I baked it.

Very easy to make and delicious!  

One reviewer noted that the amount used for the crust was not enough to cover the recommended pan size.  I thought that too, however, when you flatten it down and spread it around, it's just fine.

The filling came out a little too watery, so it took me 35 minutes for the final baking and not 20.  I was using a convection oven so this may be the reason for the longer baking time.

Next time I would make it in cupcake format to come up with a prettier presentation, such as the picture used for this recipe.

I would also cut down on the white sugar (filling) from 3/4 cup to 1/2 cup and the brown sugar (base) from 1/2 cup to 1/3 cup.  This would make it a nicer compliment to serving it with vanilla ice cream.

The whole family loved especially topped with a little whipped cream! Overall it was a excellent dish but had a view complications with the recipe and the reviews. I had to Chang it up a little but it was great. I did it the day before because the longer you let it set the better. I had it out in room temp. For about an hour and then put it in the fridge until (11:00) and thanksgiving was at 12. Great dessert to WOW the family!

I followed  the recepie but doubled  the ingredients (even the crust) so they would come out like pie and less like bars.  I baked in a 9x13 pan.  They were DELISH!!! They only thing is that the they took almost 2 hrs to bake.  Not sure what I did wrong there.  But we did have other things in the oven initially, so maybe that slowed the baking time down.  We kept checking it every 30 min until the filing was no longer super runny. They turned out divine! My whole family loved them!

Good flavor. I decided to make them in a brownie pan since other reviewers said the crust was too think in a 9 by 13 pan. Took about double the time to cook, but was very moist and  tasted like pumpkin pie. I also used 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of the spices called for in the recipe

I didn't think I would appreciate this enough to want it in place of a traditional pie however,  I do. Once fully chilled it's the bomb. We used pumpkin pie spice the 3rd time we made it and it was almost as good. BTW we make the full crust recipe in a 9X5 plan so it's a little thicker but good. The oats (stirred so they're not broken to much) make the difference.

Oh, my!  So so good!  I had to modify because I can't have ginger.  I added 1/4 t allspice and about the same of freshly grated nutmeg.  And I decreased the butter by 2 T, just to see how it would work out (it was just fine!).  

I had plenty of crust for a 9x13 pan and, in fact, thought it was a little too thick maybe, but that might be because I cut down on the butter.    Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe, JRR!

This turned out well. Though I confess I made changes. I was attempting a Gluten-Free, Dairy & Corn-Free version.

I also cut some of the sugar . Overall recipe:
1/2 c dairy-free "Original Smart Balance"
 1/3 c white sugar
 1 c  King Arthur Multi-use Flour Mix 
1/2 c GF Old Fashioned Rolled Oats
TOPPING:
2 eggs
1/2 c + 2 Tbsp White sugar
15 oz can pumpkin
1 1/2 c Coconut milk (sweet)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp ginger
1/4 tsp cloves 
1/4 tsp nutmeg

It was so close to my mother's pumpkin pie that I had to make the changes and they were superb.  Not too sweet, not too hot.

Problem with the crust - it got too dry. The GF flour can pack and I would cut back to 3/4 cup and increase oats to 3/4 cup - but use 'quick' oats.  I might consider using 1 tsp Hains baking powder if I end up melting the fat in the crust. 

For kicks, some mini chocolate chips ( if you have dairy -free) would be a fabulous addition to the topping.  Layer on top of the crust and below the custard.  YUM!

I made it as written and had to add an extra 10 minutes to baking time.  It was the perfect amount of crust for a 9x13 pan, I had no problems covering the bottom of the pan.   I think it is a perfect variation of a pumpkin pie - the oats added a nice surprise to the crust.

I doubled the recipe (I had a big crowd coming) and put it into two 13 x 9 pans.  There was plenty of crust for both pans, but like another reviewer, I didn't use a mixer, I cut the butter into the flour and sugar like making a pie crust.  I baked the crust only ten minutes, which seemed to be fine, but it wasn't really crispy.  Interestingly, I had an aluminum pan and a stainless steel insulated pan.  I baked the two pans side by side in the oven and the aluminum pan was done much sooner than the stainless steel.  The filling was set in the aluminum pan in about 25 minutes, while the stainless steel pan took about 45 minutes.  Both pans were filled to the same height.  Both were tasty.  I didn't have any trouble with burning crust.  I think I'll bake the crust the whole 15 minutes next time.

Due to the overwhelming number of reviews saying "the bars were too thin" and "there wasn't enough crust" I decided to make this in a 11 x 7 pan. Go figure, they were too thick! So I think the original recipe would have been absolutely fine. The thicker ones are more like actual pie height, but I wanted bars not pie. I also added 1/4 cup pepitas (unsalted unshelled pumpkin seeds) tossed in cinnamon on the top 15 min into baking when the filling was set a bit.

Made the recipe as written and had to add 30 minutes to the baking time to make the pumpkin filling set at all, which burnt the crust. Looked amazing but was a let down for me.

Very delicious!!  We absolutely LOVE the crust!  And I will be using this crust in other recipes!!! It took quite a bit longer to cook than stated in the recipe, but was well worth the wait!

I found there was definitely enough crust for the 9x13 pan, not sure why some thought there wasn't. Also, the cooking time is far greater than suggested. My oven heats accurately.  I'm at 30 mins and still counting. A standard filling recipe so I know it'll taste great. I'll have to add more once I taste them in the morning. :)

Love the crust, so much better than the pumpkin bars made with a cake mix crust. I would like a bit more pumpkin filling though.

My family likes this more than pumpkin pie! We used the recipe for an 8” round pan. I had to bake it all for 40-45 minutes.

After finding this recipe, I discovered that I ran out of pumpkin puree.  So, I replaced pumpkin puree with mango pulp.  Added an extra egg, a tablespoon of vanilla, and 1.5 cups of unsweetened coconut for a tropical twist.

I have been making this for a few years and realized I haven't  rated it yet.  I have made often with whole wheat flour in the crust and am picky about what tastes okay or not with whole wheat flour.  This one is great and I actually prefer the way it tastes with the whole wheat.  I have doubled it before but always used a bigger pan for that.  I do increase the crust by 1/2.  So for a single batch I do 3/4cup butter, 3/4c brown sugar, 3/4c oats and 1 1/2c flour.   This does throw off the proportion of crust to filling though and recommend doing the same thing to the filling.  The crust is a nice change from regular crust.  It is a little sweeter if you don't pack the b sugar and much sweeter if you pack it (like oatmeal cookie sweet).  We don't use dairy milk in our house (we still use butter though) and for the filling I used 1/2can of coconut milk in stead of evaportated milk.  This makes the filling thicker and it sets up really nicely.  If you refrigerate this it may be hard to get the crust off the pan so I recommend letting it sit out for at least 1/2hour before serving to let the crust become more pliable.  If you don't remember to do this you could place it in a hot oven for a couple mins just to soften the outsides and bottom of the crust to help it release from the pan.  Hope you enjoy it as much as we do!

Delicious! Very easy to make, and a great alternative to some of the higher calorie pumpkin breads or cakes. These sit up nicely, too, so you can eat them with your fingers if you'd like (and not with a fork and plate).

MY CRUST DID NOT TURN OUT WELL AT ALL! VERY SOFT. I THINK IT WAS TOO MUCH BUTTER. MAYBE A HALF A STICK OF BUTTER NOT A HALF A CUP LIKE THE RECIPE CALLS FOR??? BUT THE PUMPKIN PART OF IT WAS GOOD.

Loved this recipe, with the following changes:  Increased flour and oats by 1.5X, replaced white sugar with mashed dates (cover dates with boiling water, soak for 5 minutes, drain most of the water, then mash with hand blender), and replaced evap milk with soy milk. I probably also ended up adding a spoonful or two of extra pumpkin puree, as I always do!  Sprinkled chopped pecans and drizzled with chocolate sauce before serving!  I also ended up having to increase baking time a bit.

This was an awesome pumpkin desert. Super quick and easy to make. I had rave reviews from my family and my friends. Any potluck I have been requested to make these. To make it a bit more low-fat the second go around I used fat free evaporated milk and used half butter and half margarine and you couldn't even taste the difference.

YUM!  I basically followed the recipe ingredients as written, with the exception of using all flour for the base. I baked it in a 9x9 pan lined with parchment paper for 40 minutes (double the cooking time).  Another reviewer mentioned they were more like pumpkin pie than bars; the name of the recipe is Pumpkin Pie Bars.  They came out exactly as I'd hoped - a mini version of pumpkin pie that I can eat with my hands :)  On to the Thanksgiving sweet tray they go!  *Remember that pumpkin pie is done when the edges are set to about an inch towards the centre, and it's still a bit jiggly in the middle.

These were fantastic! My family LOVED them. I did something I never do, and that is changed the recipe before I even tried it. We were at the cabin and I didnt have the ingredients! SO, I doubled the spices, could do even more, I think. I doubled the crust, like some others and used the whole can of pumpkin, so doubled as well. But that was it. It took a LOOOOONG time, but it was worth the wait. Also, as some others mentioned, they are much better cold.

This was okay. The crust kinda over powered the pumpkin pie taste so I didn't really like it. It's different, yeah, but I like the original pumpkin pie better. I think this crust tastes better with pumpkin cheesecake instead of pumpkin pie. I might try that later.

Everyone loved this pumpkin pie alternative.  I used the original recipe in 9X13 pan and it made a thin crust layer at the bottom.  Perfect if you don't like much crust.  I did have to add about 10-15 minutes to the baking time for the pumpkin mixture to set.  I will definitely make this again!

I made the recipe as written. I didn't care for the crust. It came out very hard and dry. The filling was OK, except I didn't care for the cloves, which gave it slightly bitter taste. I'd much rather have traditional pumpkin pie, which is about the same amount of work....less work if you use a pre-made pie crust. Won't make again.

Excellent. The dough takes a little work to get it spread out into the entire pan, but makes a wonderful crust when finished. Have made these several times now and my family loves them.

I doubled everything like reviewers had suggested, and when I began layering the crust into the bottom of the pan, I found that I had made WAY too much.  If anything, just increase the crust ingredients one and a half times.  I ended up using the rest in a 9x9 dish (including the extra pumpkin mix).  This is a fantastic recipe.  Way better than the pumpkin pie that was also brought to Thanksgiving!  The seasoning is perfect in this recipe.

This recipe was pretty great, i really liked it and the squares held their shape. What I didn't really like, was that the crust was much soggier than it would be if it was in a normal pie crust. I would recommend it for taste, but not for its for texture.

I really liked this receipe! Family didn't care for the oatmill which I'm going to leave out next time, but all in all I will make this in place of the traditional pumpkin pie.  I make 4 pies and we cook with propane so it gets a big thumbs up as far as cooking time and the amount of time the oven is on.

Yummy!  Very good recipe.  Made this recipe.  Also used shell for other recipes.  Don't have much room for rolling pie shells at my place and don't use store bought so love this!

Awesome recipe. Made it JUST as stated and it turned out perfect. Will definitely make again - will likely replace my traditional pumpkin pie with these!

I took many reviewers' advice and doubled the crust.  It was tasty and sturdy enough to be eaten without a plate and fork.  It's a lot like pumpkin pie filling atop a Nature Valley granola bar.

We liked this just as it is... but next time I think I'll use my regular pumpkin pie recipe with the oatmeal crust. Husband and I both liked the crust... but next time we'll make it a tad thinner and rolled it out like a pie crust so that it's an even thickness.

Like other reviewers, the crust was a problem and does nothing to enhance the yummy pumpkin filling. I used 9x9 pan, but needed to double the bake time. Next time I'll try a crescent roll crust for richness.

I don't think I'll make these again. The crust is just a little funny and I think it needs something, cream cheese maybe? Not bad, but not great.

These tasted great, but end up with more a pie-like consistency than a bar consitency.  Be sure to serve on plates with forks - there is nothing "finger-foodish" about these squares.  For the effort and the end taste, I'd stick with a good ol' pumpkin pie, but presentationally it was nice to serve something a little different.

I gave up eating white sugar so I sub brown sugar and the recipe was still good. Not real sweet, but good.  It is even better with  a 8 oz cream cheese, 1 can pumkin, 3 eggs, 1 stick butter and 16 oz powdered sugar mixture.  The topping is much thicker and more flavorful.

I brought these to work, everyone loved them. I did have to bake about 15 mins longer than the recipe called for. Even then, the middle ones were very mushy and I had to throw 'em out. Tastes great, though.

This was such a simple recipe. It did seem to take longer to bake the crust and longer to bake the pie than the recipe called for. I even uped the temp a bit (maybe my oven is not working right-GREAT!). I am going to try a batch today without the oats and with a bit more spices, but I think this will be my "pumpkin" pie from now on. I also used evap. skimmed milk with no problem. I might try cutting a bit on the amount of butter in the crust also to save a bit on calories and fat :) Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was the best pumpkin dessert we've ever had.  I doubled the crust and might double batter next time for a bigger cake pan. I made the crust in the food processor and put oatmeal in first to grind it up a bit. I will never make regular pumpkin pie again.

These were a great treat and very easy to put together.  The crust didn't have a very good texture though, too oaty.  Next time I make these I'll grind up the oats or leave them out.

My mom made this recipe for at least 15 years at Christmas and Thanksgiving. Its an excellent alternative to pumpkin pie for those of us who can't (or claim laziness) on making pie crust. Super yummy with whip cream, or ice cream on top, served warm!

Great recipe. I used an orange-fleshed squash that's gone crazy in my neighbor's garden rather than pumpkin and it came out fabulous.  I did have to adjust the cooking time a bit.  I think I had more squash than recipe called for...I went up to 30 minutes for cooking and it could have used 5-10 minutes more

This was a delicious and easy recipe that made up so quickly!  I was so impressed by how easy and quick this recipe was to make.  My family loved it so much that 24 hours after making it, the whole panful was gone!  We loved this!  My husband, who loves pumpkin pie, said this was even better than pumpkin pie and he absolutely the crust.  Definitely a 5-star recipe in my book!  Thank you for sharing it with us.  :o)
