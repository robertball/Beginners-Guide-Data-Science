This recipe sounded great but I was a bit disappointed.  It looked very nice but there was not much flavor to it. It needs a little something, but I'm not sure what!

Christine, thanks for the great recipe!  I have 3 sons; they and my husband all raved over this recipe.  My 8 year old loves helping me to make it as well.  It's my most requested bread from my boys and their friends  Mary

I must admit I blew this recipe! Dinner got sidetracked and the dough ended up thawed in the fridge for 3 days before I used it.  Even so, it was tasty...I used onion powder rather than garlic powder...it was quite greasy, even with a little less butter than in the recipe, but I don't know if that could have been affected by the long fridge time...but very good, and I'll try it again, right, this time!

WONDERFUL!  Experiment with the spices.  You truly can't go wrong with this bread and it is so easy!  I would recommend less butter though.  When it was done cooking there was about 1/4c butter left in the pan that would have made it soggy if I didn't immediately blot it off.  Would be good as sweet bread too (with sugar, cinnamon, raisins/nuts)

Was looking for something different than just plain old rolls to make for our Thanksgiving of 25 people. Did a small batch of these for just my hunband and I and our 2 children. AWESOME! Very easy to put together! Will have to agree that I made a few changes in my spices, but it came out wonderful! Can't wait to serve this one to our guest!!!

After reading all the good reviews this recipe got, I expected something really good. I was however really disapointed. It was extremely greasy, way too much butter and it was just flat out ugly once it was turned out onto a dish. I picked off a piece and it was hard on the outside but swimming in greasy butter, if that makes any since. I ate like 2 pieces just to make sure I didn't like it and ended up with stomach cramps all night. Sorry, I didn't care for this one at all and will never make it again.

Very delicious.  I have made before as the recipe states and it makes a great alternative to standard garlic bread.  However, tonight I was hungry for something with pepperoni in it.  So, I made the bread, but substituted pizza seasoning for the parsley, and added about 1/2 c chopped turkey pepperoni and 1 cup shredded italian blend cheese.  I sprinkled the pepperoni and cheese inbetween layers of the bread and it worked nicely and was a big hit.

I wasn't too impressed.  I wasn't too crazy about it.  I will not probably make it again.  It looked very nice after baking though.  It might be missing something or just because it was frozen bread dough it didn't taste right.  Not sure, but I didn't really like it.

I cannot rate this yet but is sounds wonderful. We are served bread like this at an Italian restaurant new home.  I didn't know how it was made but it goes together like Monkey bread only with cheese and spices instead of cinammon and sugar.  Can't wait to try it!.  Sounds YUM!!!

This was pretty darn easy, and it turned out pretty good. It sort of reminded me of Red Lobster biscuits, without the cheese.

Good, quick recipe! Tried it with just parsely and garlic salt in the butter and everyone loved it. I added basil, oregano about a tsp salt and garlic to the butter the 2nd time and was good as well. Great for any meal and quick so that working individuals can get it together quickly! Thanks for a great idea~

This recipe was wonderful!  I don't have a bundt pan, so I used my pampered chef stone deep dish baker and it worked very well.  The bread cooks in it's own butter so need to add extra when it's done.  My husband thought it tasted like a local popular restaurant's famous rolls.  I will be fixing this often!

I think this is a great bread for any dinner or even appetizer.  I made it along with my pork loin for Valentines Day and it was yummy, buttery and melt in your mouth!  I will make this again and again!

I'm glad I read the reviews about this being very bland before making this so that I could problem solve. I ended up adding butter to the recipe, chopping a clove of fresh garlic and adding it to the butter and then five mins before the bread was done cooking I added a pound of mozzarella cheese to the top of the bread. It was delicious! Everyone at my party loved it an asked for the recipe! An I just Love love love how easy it is to make too!

I made this just as shown and found it too plain. I added 1/2 cup of Parmesan and a tablespoon of Italian seasoning. Much better this was...at least that's what my family thought.

One reviewer had mentioned it tasted a little bland, so I decided to use Italian Seasoning dry herb mix instead of parsley.  The bread came out fine, but if I made this again, I'd reduce the amount of the herbs to 1/2 tbsp.
