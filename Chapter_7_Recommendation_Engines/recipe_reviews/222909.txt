This is not my usual way to prepare steak or grilled veggies, but I thought I would give it a try.  First of all, the marinade needs more punch.  It resulted in a slightly oily tasting steak, and the walnut oil flavor (pretty expensive) was totally lost.  Secondly, the meat cooks much faster than the veggies, so they should have a head start of at least 8-10 minutes, if you are using medium heat.  Thirdly, I usually combine like veggies.  To me, squash and tomatoes have a high water content, and turn to mush in the amount of time needed to cook red potatoes, even though my wedges were 3/8" thick.  I usually roast potatoes with other root veggies, not high water veggies.  I should have listened to my instinct.  I did add some red onion pieces, and I'm glad I did, because they imparted some flavor to the otherwise bland veggies.  By the time the steak had some color on it, the squash was right, but the potatoes were still almost raw.  I had to pick them out and put them in the microwave for a bit to finish cooking.  Lastly, by cooking the steaks on the planks, they did not develop that nice brown color that I associate with grilled steak.  I had to take them off the plank and put them directly on the cooking grid in order to develop any color, and by the time they did develop some color they were overcooked for us.  There was a slight smoky taste to the steaks, but they tasted more like roast than steak.  Perhaps something in the instructions was lost or not communicated.
