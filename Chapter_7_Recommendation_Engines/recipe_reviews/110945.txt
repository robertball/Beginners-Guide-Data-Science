This is delicious!  Variation:  Cut ice cream sandwiches in half.  Dividing everything into thirds, place one-third of the cut sandwiches into a triffle bowl. Spread one-third of the whipped topping over that.  Squirt on one-third of a bottle of chocolate shell topping, then sprinkle with one-third of a bag of brickle bits (toffee).  Repeat layers twice more.  Place in freezer.  Set out about 10 minutes before serving.  Not cutting necessary.  Just use a large serving spoon to dip out servings!  It's oh so good!

This is a 4-star recipe with the following adjustments - add dry chocolate instant pudding mix to half of the Cool Whip plus 1/3 pound crushed Oreos.  Use that as the middle layer and frost the top with the remaining plain Cool Whip.  Yum!!

This was the most amazing dessert.  I took it to a bar-b-q and the men raved so much that they told my husband they were coming to live with us if I would make it everyday! :)  Huge hit!  I did add carmel sauce in addition to the hot fudge and used extra creamy cool whip!

This is a bit different than what I make.  I use 19 sandwiches (Cut one ice cream sandwich in half. Place one whole and one half sandwich along short side of ungreased 9x13 inch pan. Arrange 8 sandwiches in opposite direction of pan.)  I use approximately 1 cup each of hot fudge and caramel toppings plus pecans (for a pecan mudslide dessert, if desired).  Another variation is to leave out the pecans and caramel; instead use 1-2 cans More Fruit Cherry Pie Filling to make it a Black Forrest dessert.

Yum!  So easy and quick to make.  You can try different toppings, too, like caramel, M&Ms, peanuts, etc.

Presentation was nice, but tasted like ice cream sandwiches with cool whip and fudge sauce. I think in the future I'll just hand out ice cream sandwiches.

This was really good!  None of my family knew it was ice cream sandwiches.  I crushed up oreos and mixed it in with the cool whip and put in between and on top of sandwiches.  I probably would've put a layer of vanilla ice cream in between the ice cream sandwiches along with the oreos. Just to balance all the sweetness.

Fast & easy! Simple changes made it even easier. I used a foil pan, it would only hold 9-1/2 sandwiches 1-1/2 through he center of each layer for a total of 19. I used caramel filled sandwiches and put the fudge on 1st easier to spread, then the whipped topping repeated with 2nd layer and topped with sprinkles. A big hit with adults as well as the kids!!

Good and easy. As a twist-I used cookies & cream ice cream sandwiches & topped everything with crushed oreo cookies.  It was  a big hit -but very rich (in my opinion).  But overall- I loved how fast & easy this dessert was to make!

Yes, dessert can be this simple and be a hit! The beauty of it is the simplicity. I just made it for visiting family and everyone loved it.  I  used 20 ice cream sandwiches...because someone ate 4 of them before I made the dessert. I used Hershey's hot fudge and extra creamy Cool Whip.  It did seem best to use within 5-6 days, sealed tightly in freezer.

Oh my goodness, this is the best summer dessert. Made this for my family and they all loved it. With what was left, my husband kept sneaking pieces out of the freezer. Definitely a summer dessert to go to when you don't know what to make.

I love the ease and versatility of this dessert!  I have made it  mint ice cream sandwiches and topped it with Andes crushed mints.  I have also topped the vanilla ice cream sandwiches with Heath bar crunch, mini M&M's, or even some caramel sauce.  So easy and everyone loves it!

I made this with mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwiches and sprinkled crushed Oreos over the top like someone else suggested. It tasted divine and was so extremely quick and easy to make!  Plus it serves lots of people so it's great for company.
