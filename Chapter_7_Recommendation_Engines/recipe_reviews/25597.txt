Really REALLY great! It needs icing, so I stirred a little lemon juice into about 1 cup of powdered sugar until I could drizzle it. This cake is adored by all I've served (and that's a lot!).

a nice lemon cake, but it doesn't have that lemon "zing," even after adding a lemon drizzle icing.  had to bake it for 40-45 minutes, and turned out quite moist and nice.  the tarragon is overpowered by the coconut pudding mix, as that's the taste that lingers on the palate.  next time i'm going to try it with a lemon pudding mix instead, and possibly lemon cake mix as well.  if you are looking for a mild lemon, "creamy" flavored cake, this would be it.

This cake is terrific!  I loved the delicate texture, wonderful flavor, and ease of preparation.  I put a simple glaze of powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla on top.  It was fantastic!

WOW is right. I whipped up this gem for Family Easter this year and it was a huge hit. Grandma had 3 slices!

I used both lemon cake mix and lemon pudding mix, and followed the suggestion of several other reviewers to double the tarragon. ALL good choices! The tarragon is refreshing and adds complexity, and is still subtle after doubling.

I also glazed with a simple saucepan mix of butter, powdered sugar, and lemon juice. I poked holes on top so glaze could seep directly INto the cake, then spread any excess on top. The glaze added that TANG that I crave from a lemon cake.

This cake single-handedly won me the title of Official Holiday Dessert Chef in our family. No easy feat! Thanks Julie!

Wonderful cake, although I did use a lemon cake mix. I also made a lemon glaze, adding a few drops of lemon oil and grated lemon peel into the glaze.

I was planning a birthday party for my cousin and her friends and I decided to try this cake out.  Needless to say that all the kids loved it and the parents of the others wanted to know the recipe!  This one "takes the cake."

A great cake!  I used a lemon cake mix and made a lemon glaze.  My husband especially loved it and has requested it for his birthday cake.  I can hardly wait to serve it again, I think it would be fantastic with either fresh sliced strawberries or a blueberry sauce and whipped cream.  A definite keeper!

I made this cake for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.I used lemon cake mix and make a glaze with powdered sugar and lemon juice concentrate. I also lined the pan with sugar instead of flour.

I love cakes that are super moist and this fits the bill! So delicious. It is very dense, so I have tried it adding a bit of baking soda and baking powder, as well as replacing one of the eggs with 2 egg whites. I also couldn't taste the tarragon so I sometimes leave it out. This works VERY well for bite-size cupcakes: topped with cream cheese frosting and sugar sprinkles it comes off very gourmet. I will be making this for many years to come. This is the lemon cake recipe I was searching for. Thank you Julie!

Good cake! I upped the lemon and cut back on the soda after reading reviews - but not by much. The tarragon and coconut pudding give this cake something - but do not taste coconutty or tarragony to me. Interesting, without being weird. The texture is good - very moist. I did have to cook it 10 minutes longer than stated. Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone in our family loved this cake.  It took a little longer to bake though.  I had to leave it for an additional 5 minutes.  For anyone who may be concerned about the Tarragon, it was mild and did not overpower the cake at all.  I made a glaze using 1 Cup of powdered sugar, 1/3 Cup lemon juice and 1/2 tsp. of lemon extract.  Delicious!

Where do I start??!!! This is one that I did not take a photo of as it did not come our pretty, but WOW did it taste WONDERFUL!  I used lemon flavored pudding and made powdered sugar lemon and lemon zest glaze for the top that just put the cake over the edge from just yum to HOLY COW! 


To make the glaze: In a saucepan, combine butter, 1/4 cup water and 1 cup sugar, 1tblspn lemon juice and the same for lemon zest. Bring to a boil and continue boiling for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. 

Remove the cake from the pan and knife while the cake is still a little warm insert the knife tip down and pour a little of the glaze into the slit, do this all over the cake then pour the remaining over the top and let cake continue to cool. It makes for a sticky desert, but is delicious to the last crumb!

This is a fabulously unusual cake!  I have made it with both the yellow cake mix as well as a lemon cake mix, and they are both delicious, depending on how much you like lemon.  I generally use 1 1/2 t. of tarragon, because the lemon-tarragon combination is fantastic in this.  This is one of my "stand-bys" for a short-notice dessert!  WONDERFUL!

Great starting point. I used lemon cake mix, lemon pudding, no tarragon, made a tangy icing, and then topped it with a raspberry coulis when serving. Quick and easy and huge hit.

I made this using lemon pudding and topped it off with a lemon icing made from powdered sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest.  It's one of my husband's favorites and he requests it almost every birthday :)

TASTES LIKE SPRING!!!! What a beautiful cake!! perfect for luncheons, brunches, any type of gathering!!  Very simple and economical!!  My store did not have the coconut pudding (shame, I loveeee coconut)- so i used vanilla pudding- I'm not a big user of tarragon, so I used thyme (would love to try this with lemon balm from my garden) - - I sprayed and sugared my cake pan- came out perfectly beautiful-  It took longer for my oven- probably 45 mins- (new oven, but not convection-I just tested and added mins.)I did add a lemon glaze- could leave out herb, but it adds a whole different complex level to the cake- thanks for the recipe-

I would like to give it five stars, but once I made all the changes suggested by the earlier reviews, it was really a different cake. I used lemon pudding and lemon cake mix, and I added lemon jello.  I didn't have tarragon, and didn't want to spend $5 on a jar of tarragon just for this recipe, so I omitted it.   My cake was delicious, just the ticket for a Saturday snack with husband and son.

I didn't have a bundt pan so used a regular 9x13 and followed the recipe as written. It was awesome.  I amde it a second time and added the glaze as others recommended. Perfecto!  This is a keeper.

Extremely moist cake with a great texture.  More lemon-y than I thought it would be.  I couldn't taste the tarragon, so am not really sure what it added, but I wouldn't omit it.  It took about 50 minutes to bake in a bundt pan.  Moist enough to be served alone, but I added a dollop of peach, mango, orange topping.

We were in the mood for a cake that tasted grassy like and I remembered this recipe based on a previous review. Made this right up, took almost all of the oregano I had on hand, but it baked up beautifully. A real treat! Thanks!

This cake was so perfectly made for me and Juanita. Why, we sat down to frost it and ended up eating all of it. We could not find tarragon in our small grocery store, so we used oregano and it was delightful - kind of a grassy flavored cake, but nice none the less.

If you want a WOW in this receipe, use lemon cake mix.  For the frosting I used powder sugar, lemon juice, 4 oz of cream cheese, 3 whole lemons that I zest in powder sugar and then used the juice.  Mix at your consistency.  I had great reviews from this alternation.  This is a keeper.

I made this cake recently for a friend's birthday--it turned out great, but didn't keep well past the first day.  I must say I was skeptical about the ingredients at first, but the tarragon adds a nice, sophisticated flavor.  Since I wanted more than a hint of lemon in my cake, I used lemon cake mix and lemon Jello powder, and am very glad I did!  The end result was NOT overpoweringly lemony--it was just right.  I made a simple glaze out of lemon juice, water, and powdered sugar and drizzled it over the cake while it was still warm.  I also floured the pan with regular sugar as recommended by other reviewers. Great recipe!

i was looking for a cake for an office event to suit everyones taste (no chocolate, nuts, lactose etc.) I was pleasantly surprised... I followed the recipe exactly, cake did need additional cooking time. Like many others once it cooled I glazed w/ conf. sugar. lemon extract & lemon juice icing.  Yum, Thanks for sharing. I will be making another one tonight for a school event

Great taste.  Not quite as lemony as I would like..that's why I only gave 4 stars but still delicious.  VERY moist and fluffy.  I used lemon cake mix instead of regular.

I loved this recipe! After reading reviews I did use lemon mix instead of yellow, and I added a simple glaze of 1/3 cup lemon juice, a cup of powdered sugar and a splash of Grand Marnier! A hit with my friends and family it will be one of my "go to" desserts!

It was delicious! My family, my son and his friends all had seconds! My husband suggested putting a little whipped cream on top. Yum!

This is one of my go to recipes! Everyone loves it.  Since we don’t have coconut cream pudding mix where I’m at, I use pistachio and call this my “spring cake” since it turns chartreuse in color.  If I do put icing on it I use them lemon juice and powdered sugar mix, but typically I’ll just sprinkle powdered sugar over the top and garnish with some brightly colored violas.  I have seriously made this cake 100 times at least.  It gets holiday and birthday requests all the time!

I have always put my own spin on this awesome cake. I use a lemon cake mix and lemon instant pudding. I also add icing by using powdered sugar and a little milk. OMG awesome!!!

This was OK. Not horrible, but not great either. Just nothing super special. You can taste the tarragon, but it isn't overpowering. Won't make it again.
