This was tasty, but I wouldn't make the shrimp and the sausage sepereate dishes. Don't get me wrong this was good, but I thought it would wow me more than it did. I would make again just mix the shrimp in to the sausage mixture at the end. There is a LOT more shrimp to sausage ratio if you only use a half lb of frozen shrimp.

The recipe was edited by Allrecipes for clarity. We prepare the shrimp and sausage mixtures separately to build the flavor profiles, but because there is very little red sauce (it reduces considerably) The shrimp and sausages are served together over the pasta. A nice compromise for carnivores, pescatarians or epicurians.

My husband and I thought the recipes were very good, but it should DEFINITELY be two separate dishes.  The sausage/pepper dish served over pasta or the shrimp with butter served over pasta.  Felt like we made two completely different recipes and didn't get how they went together.  I would add oregano to the pepper/sausage dish too.

I essentially combined the two separate components (actually two different preparations or dishes altogether) into one dish. In so doing, I swapped out a couple of ingredients for those I thought better suited - fresh tomatoes for the "pasta sauce" and white wine rather than red; both lighter alternatives. Given that I used the Creole seasoning, I omitted the crushed red pepper flakes. I used no butter, just olive oil; only enough to saute everything.  I served this over Shirataki (read fake) angel hair pasta - a substitute that fools no one but makes you feel better about what you ate!  This is a nice, humble dish, satisfying yet still light and fresh.

Very tasty meal.  Even though you seem to be making two seperate toppings, which you may be able to use as two individual recipes; the combination of the two side by side makes for a delicous combination of flavors. Thanks.

I'm not rating the recipe because I haven't tried it and probably won't because of the sausage. I'll add here that I had to rate it because I couldn't comment without a rating so I gave it a 4 which seems to be what most people gave it. However, I just wanted to say that I don't think food should be referred to as "sexy". I wish people would get over thinking if you call something sexy, others will like it more. This looks like a decent recipe without having to do that.

I didn't have creole seasoning, so used red pepper in a smaller amount (at least one kid isn't into spicy)  I also made sure to de-tail the shrimp before serving, and put the shrimp layer on the bottom and sausage over.  I could also only find mild italian, not sweet, sausage - and it still worked well.  Milder than I expected, and might double the sauce next time since some like a little, and some a lot!

I'd use chicken sausage. There are many good flavors. This would still be delicious and subtract hundreds of calories!! Unless you need to gain weight... but I don't!!

This was pretty good. Felt like I was making two separate meals but since the family loved it,(my daughter said it was better than restaurant food). I will definitely be making it again. This one's a keeper. Thank you!!

Really good! I used spicy sausage and omitted the red flakes. Used spaghetti squash instead of pasta. The wife loved it!

I made this dish several years ago, with my best friend, and subsequently lost the recipe.  It was back when allrecipes was making it hard for people to save recipes without having premium account stuff. And I've been searching for non-existent emails with the recipe in it, since 2012. All it took today was, bad insomnia and a Bing search, and there it was.

I remember leaving out some of the ingredients, like bell peppers, because I don't really like those, and upping the spices instead. But I remember it being delicious, and that's what kept me up for the past 4 years, trying to find it again. I'm glad I finally did. 

This one is going in my recipe book, with my alterations, so that I can make it again and again. As soon as I saw the name, I knew it was this one.

All dinner participants concur -- Excellent! We did use the wine, and it added a bit of flair to the meal. The prep time is the killer--next time, we will prep the night before so we just have to cook it. We served it over noodles, as said. The sauce was ideal, extremely flavorful and lightly coating the noodles.

Booked a cozy suite with a kitchenette for Valentine's Day..just so I could make this dish. It was SO worth it! My hubby LOVED it! Actually we both did. We made it together and ate it together. A truly romantic night. This dish was delectable. Thank you Dee!

The marinated garlic shrimp complimented the sweet spicey sausage complimented each.  I didn't combine the two because I wanted to taste them separately and it worked. I served it just like the picture.  I will add some italian seasoning and select Angel Hair Pasta next time I make this and that is not too far off. I used Vermicelli Spaghetti which was good but think the thinner Angel Hair Pasta will help make the sauce more flavorful.  Great recipe and my hubby and I really enjoyed the sweet and spicy flavorful dish.
