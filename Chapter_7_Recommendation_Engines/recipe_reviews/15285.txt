Excellent recipe!  Easy to make, and very delicious.  Frosting is a must though!  Will probably use this for every holiday!

These cookies are really fast and easy to make once they are baked they have great texture and stay soft but once you bite into them you realize there is no flavor at all! I need to find a better pattern cookie maybe sugar is not the way to go :-(

the dough was so sticky it was impossible to use the cookie cutters, so I just rolled them in balls and flattened them. they were pretty good the first day but became very dry the next. they puffed up a lot and were very soft almost cake like. won't make these again.

These are not very good cookies.  They have absolutely no flavor and you must add more flour than stated in the recipe to roll them out for cookie cutters. Maybe adding orange zest might help, but for me not worth the time. Still looking for a better recipe.

Did the trick but I wouldn't make them again.  Kind of hard to work with and not much flavor.

I love this recipe. I have been able to make all kinds of patterns. I also flavor the cookies with almond or lemon instead of vanilla, depending on the occation. My family and friends love them

My cookies stayed sot and couldn't roll them out for any type of pattern cookies. I would stick with a good sugar cookie recipe for next time. These were rather bland without frosting.
