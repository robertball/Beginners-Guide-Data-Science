An interesting twist on pizza, though I made some additions - half of a diced onion and some leftover chopped ham added a lot of flavor. I also spiced it up with some fresh ground cinnamon and nutmeg, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder. I used dried cranberries instead of cranberry sauce.

This was... interesting. It wasn't bad or anything, but seemed to be missing something. I didn't have any squash, so i used some pumpkin instead. I tasted the mixture, and it seemed abit dull. i added about 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt. I always put a little salt on my cranberry sauce anyway, and it helped put a little zing in the flavor. I used one of those pre-made, Boboli-style crusts. I did everything else by the recipe. It had a nice consistency, and surprisingly, the cheese worked well with the sauce mixture. I could totally see myself making this again, though unless you have the leftover squash/pumpkin and cranberry sauce, you'll need to find something to do with what's left in the open cans of cranberry sauce and pumpkin. The salt helped, but it still needs something. Certainly unusual, relatively inexpensive, and well worth trying.

I made this with a cauliflower crust. It was good.

The only change I made to this recipe was to use a pre-made pizza crust instead of fresh baking the crust. I agree with moon city... it is good as is, but it is missing something that would take it over the top to 5 stars. Salt helped, but it needs something more...
