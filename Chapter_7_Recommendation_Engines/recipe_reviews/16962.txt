wonderful recipe.  My whole family loved it especially my three kids.  I have another white chili recipe and plan to get rid of that one in place of this recipe.  The only thing that I changed was to add only 2 cans of chicken broth and I took the advice of other people and put 2 cans of the beans in the blender to make the chili thicker.  Other than that, I did everything else the same.  This is definitely a keeper.

This was great on a cold, rainy day.  To thicken the chili I pureed two of the five cans of beans in the blender.  I also used Hot Pepper cheese instead of the Monterey Jack.  I served it to 4 people and barely had enough left for lunch the next day for one.

Made as written? A watery, chock-full-of-onions, overly spicy dish. Made again with the following modifications? FIVE STARS! : 1 large onion instead of 2, cut down cayenne to 1/2 tsp, puree 2 of the cans of beans for a creamier/thicker texture, decrease broth to 2 cans, add in the cheese while on the stovetop to melt/thicken, and, finally, add about a Tbsp of cider vinegar for a touch of acidity. THAT was the best white chicken chili I've ever made/had!

WOW! This was divine. I made this to take to my parents' house on Christmas Day. There were only six adults, but this chili was completely GONE by the end of the day. Everyone kept going back for more.
We made only a few changes. We seasoned our chicken with southwest seasoning blend before baking it. We used five cans of beans, but we pureed an additional can to thicken the chili. Other than these two things, we followed the recipe exactly.
We will make this again, soon and often.

Excellent, everyone requests this. I also added cream of chicken soup to thicken. Spice was just enough kick.

Absolutely great! I decrease the beans to 3 cans and add 2 cans white kernal corn. I also shred the chicken- more time, but worth it! My fiance loves this. It is five stars each time I make it.

My husband thought it was bland, I thought it was yummy! I took some of the beans and blended them to make it thicker.

This was really good. My Husband like it. He took it to work the next day and his coworkers tasted it and wanted the recipe. I only did half the onion and threw the other half in later so that it was bit crunchier. I also added some celery and corn. I was out of cayenne pepper so I used red pepper and increased the amount. Definitely use the cheese - it really brings out the flavor. I topped with some chopped green onions. MMMMM

This is one of my all time favorite recipes and has quickly become a family favorite.  I didn't change it much, I added 2 extra cans of great northern beans, one of which I pureed to use as a thickener.  I only use 1 can of chili's because my family doesn't go for food that is too spicy. I serve it with mexican cornbread, at it is fabulous! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Excellent.  I omitted the oregano and canned chiles, added 2 diced jalepano's, 1 habanero, and thickened with cream of chicken soup.  Kept warm in the crockpot and served with crusty bread - everybody requests this!  Excellent recipe, Thanks!

This was so delicious!  Thanx Nancie for the recipe.  I substituted with plain yogurt, which, by the way, tastes exactly like sour cream, and has a LOT less calories!  This recipe is so easy to make!  I just love it!

I made this for dinner last night..with a few changes. I used 32oz of broth..yet found it to be still too "soupey" so I added about 2 Tablespoons of flour to try to thicken. Also, I used only 1 large onion. I used only 3 cans of beans because 5 would have been excessive. I also only added 1 teaspoon of cayenne. I thought it was spicy but my husband added hot sauce to his..go figure! The flavor came out great but the consistency is why I only rated 4 stars. We topped our bowls with the cheese, a bit of sour cream, and crushed tortilla chips. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Positively Awesome !  Made a few modifications after reading others reviews, personal preference I used chicken quarters and prepared them minus the skin in a pot of boiling water heavily seasoned with garlic and onion powder , some salt , pepper and 2 bay leaves... which later turned out to be the chicken broth used in recipe, along with some left over , 6 cans of beans with 80% of liquid drained , 1 can of corn,drained (i pureed 3 cans of the beans in the food processor as well as the can of corn for thickening),and cut the cayenne in half , same amount of green chilis and cheese as called for, served with jalapeno slices on side and sour cream....  and it was Positively to Die For .. Easily Restaurant Quality . Great Recipe .. Thanks !
Update ...have found using a rotisserie chicken with 2 cans of broth works Fantastic

I'm giving this 4 stars because I made a few key revisions. I added cornstarch with the onions  to thicken, deglazed pan with sherry/white wine ,added some half and half and cream of chicken soup, added frozen corn, adobo seasoning, also used curry powder instead of cumin...best mistake I've ever made. It was absolutely delicious. Also, instead of chicken breasts...just use a rotisserie chicken. It's way easier.

If there were more stars to rate this I would give it more.  I follow everything except I use six cooked chicken breasts instead of four and I put it in my slow cooker for anywhere up to five hours or more.  I also serve this with homemade sweet cornbread.  Wonderful recipe Nancie.

YUM!! This was incredible! I used more chicken broth than the recipe called for, trying to stretch the meal because our son was home from college! I realized that it was too loose, so I tightened it up with some masa meal (tamale flour) which tightened it up and and really boosted the mex flavor!

Great recipe!!  Very yummy and easy to make healthy.  I made a few adjustments:  I put only 1 tsp of cayenne and it was REALLY spicy!  My husband who loves spicy foods said he wouldn't want it any spicier and he even added sour cream.  Next time, I won't add any cayenne and will instead allow people to spice it themselves with jalepenos or something.    TJ's didn't have the Great Northern beans, so I used Pinto and they worked just great!  I only used 4 cans instead of 5 and it was plenty.  I mashed one of the cans to make the chili thicker.  To avoid the extra fat, we topped it with cilantro instead of cheese and didn't feel like we were missing anything!  This will take the place of traditional tomato based chili in our house.

Awesome!  Loved it.  My husband, me and my brother all really enjoyed it.  Moving into fall this is the first hearty dish I have prepared.  I pretty much followed the recipe as is except a few things.  I boiled the chicken breast with a bay leaf and used that water instead of cans of broth.  Also didn't saute anything and didn't use any oil, just added all the other ingredients to the pot and let it simmer for a while.  I did use a can of white corn in place of one of the cans of beans.  My pot would only hold 4 cans.

I love this recipe. I have been making this for years... I like to shread my chicken for a thicker soup texture.  I serve it with both cheese and fritos on top.

Great recipe. I have made this several times and family loves it. I first made this to cover taste of wild turkey, and have made various different meats, changing the flavor some, but good still the same. I also soak my beans overnight, cook them down and then add broth. The broth is too expensive to waste on cooking beans.

This is delicious!  After reading reviews, I too made several changes.  I used 6 chicken breasts instead of 4 and shredded them.  We like meaty protein and not so runny soups. I cut down on broth and only used 2 cans instead of 3, which was plenty!  I used a total of 4 cans of beans, blending 2 cans to thicken. 
 Not sure what others mean by "too spicy".  I doubled the cayenne plus had to use hot sauce as it was too bland.
I like someone's suggestion on here to add black beans for color and/or carrots.  
I will make again for sure!

I loved this recipe. I do not like spicy dishes, so I improvised a bit.  Instead of chile peppers i used plain old green/red bell peppers, chopped and sauted it with the onions. I also pureed some of the beans(as other reviewers suggested), to thicken it. And instead of chopping the chicken, I shredded it.  Really tasty!!! Made a few times and definately will make again!

I cooked the chicken overnight in a crock pot with some chicken broth, then added it to the receipe.  I did smash one of the cans of beans like others suggested.  I took this to a chili cookoff and WON!  Best all around Chili!  Everyone raved and my in-laws loved it also.  The only addition I did was added a little extra of the spices.  Will definatly keep this one!  Thank you!

Wonderful chili served with condiments: chopped onion, cilantro, dried red pepper flakes, and the cheese listed in the recipe.  I prepared this as written with one exception; I used only 1/2 tsp. of the cayenne pepper so it wouldn't be overly spicy.  Served this meal with a sweet cornbread, which rounded out the meal perfectly.  This makes a big pot of chili making this cook a happy camper.  Thanks for sharing Nancy.

Amazing....wonderful and Yummy!!  I did the recipe exactly as written with one exception and on the recommendations of other reviewers, I pureed one of the cans of beans to thicken it a bit.  The cheese you put on top helps to thicken it too.  My husband and I loved it! YUMMY!!

Very good taste.  Even my kids liked it.  I did leave out the chile peppers, to avoid it being too spicy (the kids are very anti spicy) and only put a little bit of cayenne pepper.  As others have mentioned I added 1 can of cream of chicken soup, and I complete left out the chicken broth.  I also used 2 cans of northern beans with S&W lightly seasoned white beans.  I like a little variety in the beans.  I can tell by the tast that it would be good with the chile peppers.  Sometime we'll try it with them.

My husband and I had a similar appetizer at a local restaurant and I surfed the net until I found this one. My family LOVES it and I never make red chili anymore. I truly recommend adding the cheese, it definitly adds to the flavor. Thank you for sharing this recipe with me.         P.S. I usually alter some recipes, but this one is Perfect, just the way it is.

This was easy to make and delicious. The only thing I would recommend it to not add all of the chicken broth at once to see how thick the chili is and then add more liquid as needed.

This is a very tasty and hearty recipe. My family likes spicy, so I added a minced jalapeno while sautéing the onions and garlic. Also, I added more garlic and spices since I thought the recipe could use a little more flavor. I don't like using undrained beans since they contain more sodium, so I did rinse and drain the beans. Because I eliminated the liquid in the cans which would have helped to thicken the chili, I instead added a few small handfuls of crushed low sodium tortilla chips in with the chicken broth. As the chili simmers, the chips dissolve and thicken the chili. For me, along with the cheese, a dollop of low fat sour cream and chopped cilantro on top of the chili is a must! I will definitely make this recipe again.

Wow - what a great chicken chili recipe!  I made this for a crowd of 6 adults and 2 kids - and it was GONE!  I pureed only 1 can of beans, and used 3 cans of beans whole in the chili - it turned out to be the ideal consistency, not too thick, not too runny.  Served with shredded pepper jack and sour cream, as well as corn bread.

Wow!  This was awesome.  My husband absolutely loved it too.  The only change I made was to puree 2 of the cans of beans and to reduce the chicken broth to 2 cans.

OK!! I admit that I was very skeptical of this recipe after throwing all the ingredients into my slow cooker.  I took some advice from others and added a can of cream of chicken soup and also processing 2 cans of beans for thickness.  I didn't have oregano, but it seems that we didn't really miss it for flavor.  I could see my husband cringing as I stirred it all together and threw the lid on: " that's not YOUR chili! " BUT ALAS!!! It all came together in the end after 6 hours, and I just have to say that this recipe ROCKS!! Even hubby, who hates spicy ANYTHING! LOVED this along with Absolute Mexican Cornbread from this site.  He stated that he's never looked forward to leftovers as much as this meal!! (except for lasagna)  I thank you so much for the post!! It really made my hubby happy, and I loved it, too!!!

This needs some tweeking. As written to watery. White chili needs to be thick. I added a roux which thickened it up. Topped with nacho chips, cheese sour cream and green onions. Good jumping off recipe.

This chili is very good and I'd definitely be making this again. I used less cayenne pepper and chicken broth. I also mashed half the beans to make the chili thicker. All I had was dry beans so I used those instead of canned. 

For those who want to use dry beans: 2/3 cup dry beans = one 15 ounce can beans

After reading other reviews I made some changes right off the bat without trying the original recipe, but I know with my alterations it was fantastic and quickly became a family favorite!

I only used 1 onion, and since we raise our own chickens I used a half of a chicken and shredded it. I also decreased the chicken broth to 4 cups, and increased the green chiles to (2) 7 oz cans. I chopped up and added 3 stalks of celery, and about half of a red pepper. Finally I pureed 2 of the cans of northern beans to thicken it up a bit. 

Garnished it with some sour cream, monterey jack cheese, and taco chips and it's a real winner! My husband loves his red meat but this is so good he prefers it over regular chili!

I used leftover turkey and did a chile verde spin on this by adding 1.5 lbs pureed tomatillos. I started by rendering 3 slices of bacon and used the fat to sauté the onions and garlic. I added 1/3 cup of flour to the pot and browned to make a roux before adding the other ingredients. I also blended two cans of beans as others recommeded. The cooked turkey was added about 10 minutes before it came off the heat. It was a huge hit and I'll definitely make it again, with or without tomatillos.

Made this without the Monterrey Jack and used less cayenne.  Used Masa to thicken it a bit. could have used a little more, but the FLAVOR was very good!  Made this for the office and everyone ate two bowls.  Thanks for the recipe!

This one is a keeper, however, I used only half the green chilies and cayenne pepper, as my family isn't into real spicy. It was so good that I'm making it for my card-making friends on Saturday.

I'd really like to give this only 4.5 stars, because while the flavor was fantastic, it was a little soupy.  I did puree two of the five cans of beans, and didn't even use the liquid from 1.5 of them.  I also only used 32 oz broth...still was too thin.  Next time I'll drain all of the beans and reserve more broth.  Was divine with a splash of dry sherry thrown in at the end!

Amazing!  I used two cans of chicken broth and three cans of the great northern beans. I used two cans of white chili beans and pureed them in the blender to thicken it up. I topped with taco blend cheese, tortilla strips & sour cream.  Beautiful blend with a little heat. Delicious!

Great recipe.  As others, I mashed one can of the beans, threw some white peg corn in and substituted chili pepper for the cayenne.  Also addded a few tortilla chips and some cornstarch for a thicker chili.  Served with sour cream...yummmm

This was really good. I used canned chicken as I needed to use some up, 2 cans of broth, mashed 2 of the cans of beans, and reduced the cayenne to about 1/2 tsp. Also, I used dried minced onion and minced garlic. I tossed it all in the crock pot and left it for several hours. DELICIOUS! It made a lot. (5 three cup portions) I also froze most of it for later meals. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this chili yesterday and I cut the recipe in half because it makes alot.  The only change I made to this recipe was to add a can of Mexicorn and  some dried cilantro.  Nice change to the regular chili I make.

This is a great recipe.  I took advice from other reviewers and did the following: 1 large onion, shredded the chicken breast, used 2 tsp dried cilantro instead of oregano, pureed one can of bean, used half navy/northern beans, added one can of cream of chx soup.  I've now labeled this my BEST white chili!!!

This recipe is easy to follow!  I like to bake the chicken breasts in a little water and chicken bouillon at about 400 degrees for two hours to make it really fall apart before beginning this recipe.

I love to top the chili with crushed tortilla chips and mozzarella cheese.  It's melty, crunchy, and spicy all at the same time, and oh-so-good!

Very good - a great variation of chili/beansoup. A nice little kick with the green chilies, lower fat with the chicken - nice and tasty. I had this at a restaurant and couldn't wait to find a good recipe - this is a good one.

I recommend using 2 cans of white corn and 2 cans of beans.  I will also reduce the amount of chicken next time.  Very tasty, everyone loved it.

To avoid a trip to the store, I used canned chicken breast and Rotel tomatoes with green chilies.  The result was great!  Super quick, easy and tasty!  This one is a keeper!!

I like to make a big pot of anything on sundays since my husband's buddies are in and out throughout the day to watch football.  This recipe makes a pretty big batch, but I had to make another one just a couple hours after the first!  The only thing I did different was add lots of hot sauce and tons of extra cayenne.  We like it to make our noses run!

Yum! This was the first time I'd ever made or even tasted white chili, and it was delicious!! I downscaled the recipe some because I only had 4 cans of beans.  I only used 2 cans of broth, even though it called for more, and I'm glad. This was a very tasty soup and was excellent reheated. Definitely will make again!!!

Good flavor and I agree too watery, will have to get another can of beans (processed through the blender) to thicken. I also added som Penzeys Smokey 4/S spice...OH MAN!!! Took the flavor to another level! I did not add all the cayenne and was not sure the type of green chili (didn't buy canned)...so used Anaheim pepper...just spicy enough! And I used ground chicken breast. Thanks, I have saved this recipe to my recipe box!!!

Love this recipe! Added some sliced avocado and green onions on top and just a bit more garlic. We make a big pot and my husband and I will have lunch and dinner for a few days, which makes it quick and easy during the busy work week!

Because I'm lazy I made this in a Crock Pot instead of on the stovetop and set it on low for 8 hours... perfect!  I layered the ingredients pretty much in the order they are listed here with the obvious exclusion of the oil.... no sauteeing = no oil.  My other alterations: I only made a half recipe, added 2 fresh jalapenos from the garden (minced), and subbed shaved Parmesan for the Monterey Jack.  Also, I used low-sodium chicken broth since I like to control my salt intake... I just needed a little sprinkle at the end of cooking to suit my preference.  Very tasty recipe!  My cousin made something similar during the winter, and this recipe looked like the closest approximation.   I was so pleased with the result, and I will definitely make it again.  Thanks, Nancie!  I'm glad I gave it a try!
EDIT: if you use whole chicken breasts but make this recipe in the Crock Pot, it is easy to break them up into shreds with a wooden spoon after being set on Low for 8 hours.  No raw chicken handling needed!

Basically left recipe the same but with the meat I used fully cooked frozen fajita meat.  It's already seasoned so added a great flavor to the chili. I added it to the onion, garlic mix in the skillet.  If the pieces are too large, I simply cut them as they unthawed in the skillet.  Also used,chopped jalapenos for the flavor and heat of the dish and totally eliminated the oregano but added fresh chopped Cilantro for a real Tex-Mex flavor. Family and friends love this chili.  It's always a hit!!

My family plus our guests liked this a lot.  I didn't have any canned chilies so I added a can of Rotel.  I am going to try this again soon and add a package of cream cheese to whiten it like another recipe of white chili that I have made.

I made as is, with the exception of substituting Cheddar for Monterey Jack. It was perfect! Just the right amount of heat. You get 5 stars for making my husband say, and I quote, "This is very good!" Next time I'm going to make "Black and White Chili" by subbing a can of black beans for one of the cans of white beans.

This is a great recipe!  I have made it many times now and don't really follow any rules.  I use 6 to 8 cans of different beans: kidney, butter, pinto, black, baked, white, dark kidney, chic peas and a can of whole kernel corn.  I cook boneless chicken in the microwave first with some garlic salt and then cut into very small pieces.  Add everything together in the crock pot and let it go for 3 hours.  At that point, put another can of beans in the blender with a can of cream of chicken soup.  Add this mixture and cook for about another hour.  We serve ours over brown rice.  Fantastic!

I used less beans, no cayenne pepper (we are whimps) and added some cream cheese.  AWESOME!!!

This is a great recipe! I did puree 2 of the cans of beans and would recommend that anyone do the same if not more.  It is an easy recipe and makes a lot so you can freeze the leftovers! Great with the cornbread too as another member suggested.

Loved this! So easy to do!  I actually cooked the chicken in the oil and then added onions and garlic after fully cooked.  I halved this since there's only two of us and added two cans of northern beans and a can of garbanzo beans.  So delicious!  Will be making again!

This was REALLY REALLY good. Only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 was because it was quite watery.  I even pureed 2 1/2 cans of beans to give it some thickness, but with all the chicken broth it was still too soupy. Next time I'll maybe use only 1 can of broth and drain the beans. Flavors were great, though.

My mother loved this! I think it was pretty good and my husband thought it was okay. I made a few changes. Omitted the cumin because I absolutely hate the taste of it. Not too found of oregano but used it and think I will use less next time. Instead of olive oil I used butter. That was accidental, not purposely. Used bone in chicken thigh and removed the skin and bone after boiling it with seasonings. Chicken has a shredded effect and loved it that way. Lastly I couldn't find just plain ol Monterey Jack cheese (all I found was mixes) so I used a habanero monterey jack cheese and I think that is what made the chili taste really good. Will make again with a few more changes. Oh, and I added some salt, pepper, and seasoning salt too.

We tried this Chili recipe last night. My family loved it. I was looking for a chili recipe that was not as hot as my normal chili and this was just spicy enough without being Hot! Loved it! It is a easy quick chili recipe that takes only a few minutes to put together after working all day.

Absolutely delicious! I made this with a store bought rotisserie chicken. Also, omitted the chile peppers since I didn't have them on hand and it still tasted fabulous. Will keep this one in my meal rotation.

Great recipe! Definitely puree 2 cans of the northern beans to thicken. For the cooked chicken breast, I seasoned with seasoning salt and white pepper and cooked them on the foreman grill. Also add salt and white pepper to taste.Also, I added a can of green giant white chipolte corn!!!

We really enjoyed this recipe!  Cut back just a little on the cayenne and it was just the right heat for us.  Enjoyed it topped with cheese and a few tortilla chips.  Delicious!

Pretty delicious and easy to make. It was a bit to spicy for me so I added sour cream and cilantro to it when I was eating it and it balanced out the spiciness really well. Will make it again.

I loved this chili! It's got enough kick for me and since I get sick from other types of beans, this is perfect for me. My brother and friends really enjoyed it as well. I brought this into work for a chili pot luck and added more cayenne pepper and also put in a bit of chili powder and salt to stray from the semi-bland taste. 

Pureed 2 cans of the beans, added the corn and also used a can of cream of chicken as others suggested.

Out of all the chilis at the pot luck, this was 2nd best there. 

Thank you!!!

This stuff is stinkin' wonderful!  I have a hard time sticking to recipes, I'm not much of a measurer.  I cooked dry beans and made my own chicken broth, and didn't leave out any ingredients.  It was wonderful!  My husband and the kiddos agreed.  I served it with shredded cheese on top and a warm flour tortilla on the side.

Instead of using chicken breast, I use a whole chicken and boiled it.  This way I have the chicken and the broth needed for the recipe.  I increased the spices used and thickened the base with some tapioca starch.  Next time, I think I'll puree the last can of bean instead.  Overall, it was a hit and will taste even better as a eftover.

I really enjoyed this recipe and it really was very easy and quick to make, which is very important when you work a long day then want to come home and eat something delicious and hearty.   I used only 1 can of chicken broth, and one can of cream of mushroom soup to make it a bit creamier, and it worked really well for me.  Finally, I do agree with the others that mentioned it was not very spicy - it was actually very mild. When I make this again (and I definitely will) I will try using more spice (maybe some tasty white pepper).

Excellent recipe as is - but a few variations make a thicker, spicier, 5-star chili! After reading several recipes and a million reviews, I changed the following: pureed 2 cans of beans in my blender to thicken, added 1 can sweet yellow corn, added 1 chopped jalapeno with about half the seeds removed, reduced the broth to 1 1/2 cans, added garlic powder, onion powder, and 1 heaping teaspoon of cilantro, and shredded my chicken. I sauteed the onions, garlic, and jalapeno until tender, then threw it in the blender with the beans (personal preference for no onion pieces & to thicken). Tossed this and the rest, including raw chicken into the crockpot on high for 2 1/2 hours. Shredded chicken, cooked for an additional 2 hours, & served with Hawaiian Cornbread. Truly fabulous & hearty chili! Just the rice spice & texture. Leftovers were amazing!

This recipe is really great.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used a blender to blend two cans of the beans.  That worked well.  I also substitued real chili peppers (2) and put them in a food chopper so they would be in small pieces.  My husband loves spicy food, so that was a big hit for him.  I also put the chicken in the food chopper.  I liked how the small pieces of chicken helped thicken the chili.  I topped this with cheddar cheese and sour cream before serving.  Yummy!

This was good! I upped the servings to 12, which called for 8 cans of white beans. Per another person's suggestion, I used 2 cans of white corn, and 6 of white beans, pureeing 2 of the white bean cans. Next time, I will puree at least half of the white beans to make it thicker. And 1 can of green chilies was plenty for us. Also, I used a rotisserie chicken, which added some extra flavor.

This is so good! I've been looking for a white chili recipe and my b/f found it! He substituted 1 can cream of chicken  for 1 of the cans of broth to make thicker. Used 2 48oz. jars norther beans, and forgot to put the cheese on so we just ate it without . But wow - this tastes fantastic still. If you're looking to cut the 13.9g of fat/serving forget the cheese. You won't regret it! The only thing different I want to try is to puree 4 cups of beans and see how that goes (I like a thick chili).

This recipe was delicious!!  I made it for my boyfriend, and he loves it.  I only used a total of 4 cans of beans, and pureed one of those cans to thicken the consistency of the soup.  I only used 2 1/2 cans of chicken broth so that it wouldn't be too thin.  I also drained the beans before dumping them in to the soup.  I did everything else as the recipe calls for.  EXCELLENT!!

This is a good recipe but the consistency is more like a soup then chili.  Next time I won't use as much liquid.  It had a great flavor though.

This recicpe was great. I read some of the other reviews and used some suggestions. I am not fond of very spicey, hot foods. I cut the amount of cayenne pepper in half. It was just enough for my liking. I also added two small cans of white corn and blended two of the cans of beans. It turned out wonderful. The rest of my family loved this too. I highly recommend it.

Wonderful recipe.  I did what the others did and pureed 3 cans of beans.  It made for a creamier "chili."  This was more like a soup.  I served it over brown rice and then it was more like chili.  Definitely would make again.

I tried this recipe out at a party recently and everyone loved it. It has great flavor and spice.

Taking other's advice, I changed the recipe a little to thicken up the chili by adding more beans, blending 1/3 of them and cutting down on the chicken broth.

I could not find Great Northern Beans in my neck of the woods, so I used Navy Beans instead. They are basically the same but smaller.

Our family loved, loved, loved this chili.  What a change from regular chili.  Not so big on spicy so I cut the chile peppers and and cayenne pepper in half and it was perfect for my spicy intolerance.  Thanks Nancie for sharing.

My picky husband and I both loved this.  I made a couple adjustments to reduce the heat, and followed a couple other reviewers' comments: I pureed one of the cans of beans to give the chili some body, and subbed cilantro for the oregano.  In addition, I used a rotisserie chicken, used much less cheese, and added a squeeze of fresh lime juice to each bowl just before serving - it was heaven!

I made this chili for my husband and I and we both loved it! The recipe called for three cans of broth, but I only used two and I still thought that it was a little bit soupy for my liking. Other than that, we both thought it was great.

The chili was good, but because of my husband's intolerance to spicy foods, I omitted the chile peppers and cayenne pepper.  It probably would have tasted better with the spices.

I loved this easy to make recipe. I used chicken bullion cubes and water instead of the broth. Also I topped the soup with not only cheddar cheese, but with sour cream and chopped cilantro as well. Oh, and I accidentally used a can of diced jalapeno chilis which made it a bit too hot for me. Next time I will use the green chilis.

I left out the green chili peppers, added one can of corn, and I replaced two of the cans of great northern beans with two cans of lima beans. Served with sour cream on top instead of the Jack cheese. Very good still and a very easy recipe.  My 9 year old son prefered this chili over traditional chili!  I definately will make this again.

I didn't use as many beans and cut back on the chicken broth and added 3T of flour to thicken.  Thanks for all the other helpful suggestions.  My kids and I enjoyed the chili.

It had a nice flavor but too many beans for me.The day after, the beans made the chili mushy so I had to throw it out.

The changes I made were 1) added 1 chopped Jalapeno, 2) 1 tsp of crushed red chili peppers and 3) mashed up 1 1/2 cups of the beans to thicken it up.  I've made this recipe at least half dozen time this year.

I made this soup for 4 servings instead of 8. It was good, but the one can of chile peppers was too much. Next time, I will use only half a can.

Great starting point. Like other reviewers, I cut back slightly on the broth and pureed 2 cans of the beans. It gave a creamy, heartiness to it that was divine. I also used a rotisserie chicken and added a can of corn and 2 cans of petite chopped tomatoes. I used lots of cumin and added chopped cilantro towards the end. We loved it!

I love making different kinds of chili, and have recently discovered this recipe.  It is great, and can be made so that it is very healthy as well.  But a couple of caveats though.  Cut the broth in half, otherwise you will have very soupy, well soup almost.  The most I add is about 20 ounces.  Now, 1.5 TEASPOONS of Cayenne?  Seriously?  Otherwise, I add a few of my own personal preferences (adding a can of low sodium corn, some sliced mushrooms, etc.).  I know this is white chili, but I can't picture chile without chili powder, so I add a tablespoon or two of that, which doesn't darken the color much.  Excellent cold-weather comfort food.

I made this with a couple of "tweaks" - used a lb of dried beans soaked overnight (less expensive, none of that "gooey" liquid from the can that is mystery liquid) and drained *most* of the water from them before adding to the pot.  Used grilled chicken that was cut in 1/2 inch cubes - worked great.  Added 2 cans of white corn and about 1/3 cup of potato flakes to thicken.  Ate the next day and was SPICY.  If we make again, would cut the cayenne to less than 1/2 t for sure; the spice from the green chilis would be sufficient; as written too much for the kids.  Other than that, good flavor and very easy to make.  And tasted even better on day 2!!!

This is one of my favorite recipes on allrecipes.com.  I'm giving it four stars because I do make some adjustments when I make it, but it always turns out great!  We took the advice of other reviews and puree two of the cans of beans to thicken the broth.  I also add two cans of corn and melt the cheese into the chili and top with additional cheese.  I really like this recipe because it can be easily adjusted as far as spiciness.  I am not a fan of spicy foods, so for me it's just right.  But my boyfriend can easily add some sauteed jalapenos and hot sauce to his without overpowering the flavors.

This recipe is awesome!! I have never made white chili before but this recipe is definitely going on my meal rotation. I did make a few changes to fit my family's taste buds. I used only one onion, only 2 cans of chicken broth, mashed one can of beans, added a tsp of salt because I used low sodium chicken broth, added a sprinkle of chili powder, a tsp of cilantro and one can of white corn (drained). And I omitted the cayenne altogether. It was sooo GOOD! Thank you so much for the recipe. I LOVE IT!

This is almost the exact same recipe I've been making for 20 years, except it calls for more broth & more cayenne than my old recipe.  I definitely enjoy the little extra kick. I simmer the chicken in the broth until tender, then shred it.  Then add all ingredients & simmer until desired consistency. I don't mush the beans like others, I prefer mine whole. I have thickened it with cornmeal, but usually just let the chili simmer until it has thickened on its own.  If I don't have enough chicken stock, I've made it with half stock & half beer, which is also good.  I melt about 1 to 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheese in the pot before serving, then crumble a piece of cornbread in a bowl, spoon up the chili, top with a little more cheese, a dollop of sour cream, & some sliced black olives - yummy!

So I am one of those people that never follows a recipe exactly, but this has been my "go to" recipe base for several years.  I usually only use 3 cans of beans with one puréed for thickening.  I  also put out lime wedges, cheese, sour cream, jalapeño peppers, and green onions for each person to add to his own taste.  
One note here, I have found that a large can or two of chicken breast works very well for a rush job.  I have to admit that I was quite surprised.  I have always loved my grandmother's home canned beef......so I decided to try it.  The food snob in me had to eat some crow!

My husband said this is the best recipe I've made so far. Here is how I adjusted it:

1 pd ground chicken instead of breasts; 
5 cloves garlic;
1 32 oz. box of broth;
2 jalapenos instead of the can of green chile;
3 cans only of the beans, 1 as is, 2 mushed up;
1 green or red pepper, chopped;
1 fresh tomato, chopped;

I hope someone enjoys my variation. It was really amazing over rice.

My nephew requests this chili at every opportunity. I usually put in 2 cans great Northern beans, 1 can white kidney beans, 1 pkg. frozen white corn, and use half the onions, garlic, and green chili listed in the recipe (for just a hint of spice). I also shred the chicken as someone else suggested and found it makes a difference in the taste. Wonderful!

LOVE this.. with a few modifications.  I shred the chicken.  I also sub 2 onions for two small bunches of green onions.  I don't saute the onion and garlic, I put it all in a pot (as recipe indicates) and bring to a boil.  I use 1 tsp of cayenne and add a diced portabella cap.  Then I move it to my crock pot, add the beans, and put it on high until I like the consistency.  Have also put in artichoke hearts, very good!  I sub Monterrey jack for shredded hot pepper cheese.  Add it the last 5 minutes of cooking.  Serve with shredded mozzarella and sour cream on top.  Also, to thicken I put in a 12 oz can of evaporated milk when I move the soup to the crock pot.  (It makes it look more like WHITE chili too!)

This is one of my go-to recipes for white chili. I modify it in the following ways. 1) Chicken - I use a whole rotisserie chicken from my local super grocery store. Just roll up your sleeves and shred it by hand. 2) Instead of 3-14.5 oz cans of chicken broth, use 2 of those, pour in the juice out of the chicken bag and a 12oz super hoppy beer (Sweetwater IPA if you're in GA) 3) Leave out some or all of the ground cayenne if feeding the kids. It's easy to add to taste if you want it. 4) If you're feeling lazy, skip the onions and use a bag of recipe starter mirepoix mix (onion,carrot,celery). Also cuts down on the onion taste that JEN78RN complained about. 5) Cook it on a slow simmer as long as you can, put it in the fridge, and eat it the next day.

This recipe was wonderful.  Like other reviews, I pureed two of the five cans of beans to thicken and cut back a bit on the onion.  It's hard to find a recipe that is exactly what you want without tweaking it, but this one is. Thank you, Nancie, for submitting it.

I have always made this recipe using left over Turkey breast.  First snowfall of the season (9 inches), so it seemed like a white chili day.  Today, I used two large chicken breasts.  I sprinkled them liberally with McCormick California Style Garlic Powder and California Style Onion Powder, and a bit of Lawry's Seasoned Salt on both sides, and let them sit about 2 hours.  Then I added the chopped onion, and the chicken broth, and brought it to a simmer for about 30 min.  Removed the chicken and shredded it up.  Returned to the broth, onion, added spices, but substituted chili powder for cayenne pepper, added a bit more Cumin and Oregano to taste.  Also purred one of the cans of great northern beans for thickness.  Was totally delicious!

A great recipe for leftover turkey.  I even had turkey stock to use.  More flavorful than plain turkey soup.  My one problem is I have a beanophobe in the house, so the rest of us will be adding cannellini beans as a condiment along with lime wedges and fresh chopped cilantro.  Sissyzeke saved my soup with her masa suggestion, thank you!  It gave me some thickness and delicious mexican flavor. I ladled a little of the hot broth into a small bowl and whisked a tablespoon or so of the masa  flour until it was smooth and then added it back to the soup.  Genius!  I am also adding some sweet white corn kernels shortly before we serve.

As written, the recipe is a little bland and calls for too much onion, too many cans of beans, and too much broth. I changed it up and think it's much closer to a 5 star recipe with these changes (made to serve 4): 2 cups chicken broth total, 1 small to medium onion, 1 can beans, 3/4 cup frozen corn. For spices, I added some garlic salt (my chicken broth is low sodium, so it lacked saltiness), more cayenne pepper, chili powder, black pepper, one 7-oz can green chilies total, and 3 tbsp chopped jalapenos. Obviously, we like it spicy! Definitely shred your chicken, too. It makes all the difference. The chili still tasted like it was lacking something, but overall, was much tastier!

This was delicious and my entire family loved it, including my girls ages 12 and 8. (although my 8 year old thought it was a little too spicy so I put sour cream in her bowl)  I did mine in the crockpot and here are a couple minor changes:  I used only 3 cups of chicken broth, 3 cans of Cannelloni Beans (White Kidney Beans), and 2 cans of the Northern Beans.  I used my immersion blender to puree the 2 cans of Northern Beans. YUM YUM, thanks for the super tasty recipe!  I will be making this often!

I love it!!  I boil my own chicken and then use the broth from the chicken.  I use white cannelini kidney beans and only use 3 cans because the broth is so yummy.  I also substituted the chilis with chili powder and decreased the amount of cayenne pepper because when I used the full amount it was too spicy to eat.  I just put the whole block of montery cheese in it and let it melt.  This makes a HUGE difference.  DELCIOUS!!  My whole family gobbles it up.

My kids - who don't *like* beans - loved this! I followed some of the other reviewers' information. I pureed one can of beans in my food processor. I then added one can of Northern beans and one can of black beans (cleaning out my pantry).  I used only 4 oz. of green chilis, b/c we don't like things too spicy. Finally, I substituted cheddar cheese, as we were out of the Monterrey. The family loved it so much that I only got one bowl!

I followed the recipe (modified for 4 people) and the ONLY thing I did differently was that I added 1 cup of sour cream so it would be creamy rather than broth based only. YUMMY!

This is AWESOME!!!  I followed what others had suggested about mashing up 2 cans of the beans.  I just used my little food chopper.  I didn't have garlic, used a little garlic powder.  I was afraid of it being too spicy so the first time I didn't used the green chile peppers - second time I did.  The chiles add extra flavor.  I also boiled the chicken in the chicken broth and sprinkled the Mccormicks Montreal Chicken grilling spices over the chicken.  Then shredded the chicken.  I cut down the cumin to 1 teaspoon and the cayene to 1 teaspoon.  I thought it was perfect.  It reminds me of Chick Fil A's new chicken tortilla soup.  This is the best - I actually crave this!

Okay, I have to brag!!! This recipe won first prize at my husband's school's chili cook-off, hands down.  He said it wasn't even close!!!  IMPORTANT:  Don't use all the chicken broth.  I only used ONE can and was perfect.  Many reviewers had to thicken their chili and that was  because of all the broth in the original recipe.  Also, pureeing one can of the beans helps to thicken the chili.  Next time I will sprinkle cilantro over the chili once it is cooked.  I assembled this chili, then put it in a slow cooker on high for about 3 hours.  PERFECT!!

this was delicious - I changed some things-I added 1 small can corn, I used cannellini beans and 2 of them I puree'd - use 1 4oz can green chile peppers not 2- 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp cayenne.  This was very tasty and enough heat for us.  Dont forget to top with grated cheddar/jack cheese or whatever kind your family loves.  This was yummy!

I make this chili every time there is a "chili party" and it is always the first to go! I use pretty much the exact same recipe but I also add 2 cans of garbanzo beans and two cans of Green Giant shoepeg white corn--not many canned vegetable suppiers have white corn anymore, so look for Green Giant! Also, rather than stove-top I cook the chili in a large casserole dish or roasting pan in the oven at 350 degrees for two hours. Cover with shredded Monterrey Jack cheese about ten minutes before the chili is ready to be served. Toppings include jalapeno slices and sour cream. Serve with corn bread or corn tortilla chips and a green salad.

Even substituting different beans, omitting the chiles or cheese if I don't have them, this is outstanding!  I like to add cooked rice to each bowl. Then it's very much like Cheesecake Factory's white Chile.

Wow - A bit spicy was an understatement!  Needless to say I had to make some variations at the end, so the kids would eat it because of the spice - however... Super tasty!  My husband loved it and all the kids at it.  Tweaked it a bit here and there but over all yum-o!

i think by making my own broth and soaking beans over night to reduce the SODIUM content, i must have removed the FLAVORs in this recipe, because I did not care for it ... i would never make the chili again, but my broth was very good; next time i will just make SOUP w/the broth and call it a day.

This was so great tasting and EASY to prepare! I used a combination of black and white beans. I pureed the white beans like other have suggested, to make the soup thicker. 

While the onions were sauteing, I grilled the chicken in my George Foreman grill, so it took no time at all to prepare. The kids said it was perfect for the cold fall day we had today. I agree!

I suggest cutting back on teh cayene pepper, however. I used only 1/2 t. and it was plenty spicy. Yum!

My fiance and I loved this chili!  We had never made a white chili before, and this was the perfect one to start with.  I can't eat garlic, so we left that out.  We also only used one onion and it was plenty.

This was fantastic!  It was just a bit spicy for me on the first day (still very good) but after a day or two in the frig it mild down for me, however my husband loved it from day one. The only thing I changed is instead of 5 cans of beans I used 4 (It is only the two of us). Other than that I would not change a thing! Great recipe Thank you

Really good recipe.  Of course I made a couple alterations for my taste.  I cut the pepper in 1/2.  It was perfect for me, too hot for my mom, and my husband added hot sauce :)  I fork mashed 2 of the cans of beans and added 1/2 a can of cream of chicken soup.  I also cooked a little longer uncovered to help reduce/thicken it a bit.  I didn't have cheese on mine and it was delish!  Thanks for a great healthy recipe!!!

Very good. A little too spicy for my taste. Would have preferred a little bit thicker. Next time I will cut down on the chili peppers and cayanne pepper. I may puree a can of the beans to thicken it up some.

Good chili. I actually let this simmer for 1 hour. I only added 3 cans of white beans undrained and a can of pureed white beans and 1tbsp of cornstarch to thicken it up. Topped it off with green onions, sour cream and crushed tortilla chips. Yummy.

Hit at a potluck.  Used only 2 cans of broth; put one can of beans through the blender.  Used 1 lb. of chicken tenders and it was plenty of meat.  People asked for the recipe.  Will make it again.

I was worried about this being too spicy for my family.  I added a can of cream of chicken soup and served it with lots of cheese and sour cream.  It was a total hit.  My 2 yr. old wanted seconds.

I made this for the guys who are siding my house.  It was a cold day and they all like it.  Delicious.  I added bite size pieces of cooked carrots (for color).  I will make this again.

My family LOVES this!  I have "heat" sensitive tastebuds in my home, so I omit the cayenne and later add red pepper flakes into the servings of those of us who do like peppers.  Also, we like to add a dolup of sour cream and top with shredded cheddar cheese and a few chives.  Tastes great and the presentation is nice, too.  Add a salad and cornbread muffins and you have one of my family's favorite dinners.  I love it because I can put it all together in the crockpot at the beginning of the day.  Easy and so good!

My family loved this recipe.  Like others suggested, I blended 2 cans of the northern beans, replaced one can of beans with white corn, and only added 2 cans of beans total.  I also added some diced jalapenos in addition to the green chilis to make it a little spicier.  I boiled chicken breast and shredded it, but before adding it to the chili added it to sauteed onions and garlic and added garlic pepper and cumin.

Just like my recipe. Try a dollop of sour cream topped in the bowl - that is how we prefer it.

I found a variation on this recipe from WW which uses a few squeezes of lime juice, fresh cilantro, and low fat/low-sodium chicken broth. I made it the other day and it was fantastic, so full of good, fresh flavors. Oh, and I put a few shakes in of the new Mrs Dash Fiesta Lime Seasoning Blend and it really added some good spice.

Good stuff!  I used chicken thighs boiled in 2 cans of broth.  I shredded the chicken and added it to the pot with the cumin and oregano along with onion and garlic powder.  I rinsed and drained the beans and added them along with the green chilies and a can of drained corn.  I filled the can of corn with water and added that for a little more liquid.  Also omitted the cheese and served with Saltines

This white chili is delicious!  I also took some of the other reviews and applied them to this recipe.  I used 2 cans of chicken broth instead of 3, used a 1/2 jar of medium salsa in place of green chiles, pureed 2 additional cans of beans for added thickness, and 5 additional cups of cheese.  I then topped it with sour cream and green onions. Wonderful!  I'm making this recipe for the 5th time now!

I followed this recipe exactly except I replaced chicken broth with vegetable stock, and we loved the results! The leftovers were fantastic used in a chicken/bean flour burrito with refried beans, lettuce, tomato, diced onion, monterey jack cheese and sour cream.(Possibly the leftovers were even better than the chili! How often do the leftovers eclipse the original meal?!) Yum!

I thought this recipe was great.  I did increase the amount of  beans, blending 1/3 of the beans to add thickness.  I also added some cilantro.  It still came out a little thin, next time I will add a can of cream of chicken.  Easy meal for a cold winter night.

Average at best.  I'm not sure why there were so many 5 star ratings... I thought the soup was very bland and boring, although my guests liked it.   I added some roasted corn & alot more spices to make it better....

Excellent recipe! I did puree 1 can beans to thicken as others had suggested. I also added chopped fresh cilantro. This was served on Super Bowl Sunday along with Venison chili and surprisingly the White chili was the number one choice of our guests.

I was skeptical when I made this because it looked a little bland but the minute I tasted it I was pleasantly surprised.  It was amazing!  I substituted one can of the Northern beans for black beans.  I also added a can of whole kernal corn.  It was so good, I'm going to make it again this week.

Excellent recipe!!...I agree 'chili' is a little misleading unless you puree the beans to give it some thickness. We have always received RAVE reviews for this and everyone wants the recipe....so I send them here!

YUM! Definately going to keep this recipe. I personally thought it was a lil too beany so I simply used one less can of beans and to keep the consistancy even I cut back to only 2 cans of broth. Turned out perfect!

I loved this recipe. It was very flavorful but way spicy for my taste, which is why I only gave it a 4. I don't know if I did something wrong since I didn't see any other reviews about it being too spicy but I will have to try again and see if I can tame the spicyness without losing the flavor.  I did add two cans of white kernel corn and blended one can of beans to thicken it a little.  Very yummy even if my lips are on fire.

I really liked this recipe after I tweeked it around abit. I added only 3 cups of chicken stock so it was thicker. Left out the oregeno. Added two fresh Jalapeno's. I used 4 cans of the beans and blended two of them so it was creamier. After I slow cooked it for awhile I added about 2 cups of montery jalepeno pepper cheese to the pot. This one is a keeper and I am sure I will still tweek it around.

Used shredded chicken breast and left out the green chiles only because I don't care for them.  It was wonderful!  I did puree a can of beans as suggested, but I think I would prefer it without. Also would like the smaller Navy Beans than Great Northern.  Will make again and again. Thank You for the recipe!!

This recipe was a hit amongst all who tried the initial batch that I made.  I did substitute 2 cans of white corn for 2 cans of great northern beans to give it a little extra crunch and to make it a little heartier, as one of the other comments suggested.  I also did not have any cayenne pepper on hand, so I substituted a splash of Jamaican hot sauce for this.  Delicious!

Very, very good! I took the advice of another person and blended 2 cans of the beans. I also put only 1 can of chiles in just in case it was too spicy for my 3 year old. It wasn't and next time I'll do that for her in a separate pan, so my husband and I can make it good and spicy (maybe add some diced jalapenos). Oh, and I only used 3 shredded chicken breasts. This is a keeper!! Thanks!

This is a great basic white chicken chili recipe. I make a few changes. I add sour crea, heavy whipping cream and a little corn starch as we like thick chili. Occassionally, I also add a can of drained corn. I also add about a half cup of cheese to the soup. I know its more fattening...but after all...this is comfort food.

Really good. Used leftover turkey and dried Northern beans (cooked plainly since canned were $2 a can here). Topped with reduced fat Monterrey Jack cheese, crushed tortilla chips, light sour cream and cilantro. Otherwise, followed the directions. Will make again.

Wow, this one's a kicker!  Great flavor, but for those that haven't developed their spicy food palate much (like me!) it might be a bit over the top.  However, I did read through the other reviews, and decided to be a tad cautious... cut down on the chili pepper by 1/2 teaspoon, and only added one can of chile peppers.  My husband and I both liked it.  I know if I'd added the full amounts, it might have been much for the two of us.  A nice generous 'dallop' of sour cream on top was a nice creamy touch - which also diffuses some of the spice.  Great recipe!

Had dinner at my house w/ a couple of friends and everyone loved it! I did puree a little less than half the beans to make it thicker and cut down the chicken broth, didn't add the green chiles but added a little more ground Cheyenne pepper. We had it once w/ biscuits and the second time w/ Beer Bread. Will definitely make it again!

I really loved this recipe, thank you!  The only thing I changed was that I added carrots and celery with the onion and garlic before I added everything else.  I turned out great!! I will definitely make this again.

My family loved this recipe.  I will warn say it was hot, but that's how we like it!  I boiled a whole chicken for about an hour on med-hi and used all of the chicken meat in the Chili.  This also gave me my broth!

Yum!!!  This was so good!  I did change a few things.  I sautéed celery with the onion, made a rue, cut down the chicken broth to just a splash, and added a little heavy cream.  It turned out creamy and delicious.  The rue thickened it up just right.  My son said this was the best chili ever.  He has asked for it again and its only been 2 days since I made it.

This is a great recipe and easy to follow.  I didn't have any cayene pepper so I used crushed red pepper instead and it still was very delicious.  I didn't eat it until the next day so the seasonings had time to really settle.  I love it.

Made this for fourth of july - everyone raved. I too added two extra cans of beans, and pureed both of them. I also added another can of green chili. I didnt think it was spicy enough, but then again I like hot food :)Topped it with cilantro, tortilla chips and cheese. It was great!

Reduced this down to four servings but increased the chicken broth. Also, just threw in some raw chicken tenderloins and allowed them to slow cook in the broth -- more flavor and nice texture for the chicken. Not the best white chili recipe I have ever made but far from the worst.

Wow!  This chili was good but way too spicy for my hubby.  We added a little sour cream and cheese to tone down the heat. Yum! I cut the recipe in half and it fed 4 of us with 2 servings leftover. I'll definetly be making this again.

My husband absolutely loves this recipe.  He crumbles tortilla chips and uses them like oyster crackers (it is more like a thick soup).  Will make this one again and again.

Great recipe. My dh can't eat tomatos due to acid reflux but loves chili. This worked great for us. I added extra cumin and used much less cayenne than called for. I also served with lime wedges and that added a great flavor brightener to the dish. Overall, a great recipe!

I would give it 10 stars...it was that good. My family has switched from regular chili to this. I, also, added the cream of chicken soup.  I also added some left over angel hair pasta.

Good Recipe!  I did change a couple things.  I used fresh green Chiles instead of canned. I added 1 cup of thicken cream.  And only added 3 cans of beans.  I loved the favour.

Soup had adequate spice but seemed to lack something.  I had to add butter, fresh parsley, Worchestire, and Chipotle Tabasco to help the flavor.  It still needed something.  It was edible but I will find a different white chili recipe next time.

Loved this recipe! Everyone in my family ate it, and had second helpings, which rarely happens. I kept everything the same as written, and turned out great. We will definitely make again soon since it was super easy and quick to make.

Great base for a white chicken chili. I have used this recipe and changed a few things to make it my own over time. Family and friends love it and beg for me to make it. Changes are as follows: chicken broth, I make my own, boiling a whole chicken (or two), and deboning them, saving the meat for whatever I need at the time, and then boil the bones & skin, etc on low all night to make a delicious, flavorful chicken broth which I then freeze and save for moments like these ( two whole chicken leftovers/bones make A LOT OF RICH, FLAVORFUL BROTH!). It makes ALL THE DIFFERENCE! My soups are to die for. The secret is in the broth.    Next, I add more garlic. Just a clove or two. Garlic is life. A dash of poultry seasoning, and a dash more of the spices then what it calls for, flavor is always appreciated (Not the cayenne! Careful with that stuff, do it to taste). I also found cilantro from another recipe was a nice addition, 1 tsp dried. As far as the thickness, whisking 2 Tbsp-1/4c corn starch in matching quantities or a little more hot water in a bowl, then pouring into the chili and mixing in thickened it well enough. Plus it thickens overnight in the fridge- remember that.  Salt and pepper is a must. I had to salt this... A LOT. And pepper to taste.   Nice toppings are sour cream, shredded cheese, and Tostitos scoops. Staples in my home.

This white chili is delicious. When I sauté the onions and the garlic, I also sauté a jalapeño pepper and a serrano pepper along with it. It gives it an extra spicy kick. This is on my favorite of favorites list.

Love this simple recipe, but cannot imagine 1 1/2 tsp of cayenne.

This is easy to make and delicious!  I used a rotisserie chicken but that's my only deviation from the recipe.  This goes great with Johnny's Biscuits from this site.  Yum!!

I made a few changes, I prefer to use great northern beans, they make the chili creamier and dont have the hard crunchy outer shell of the cannelloni beans, I also used red pepper flakes instead of cayenne.

Great an easy recipe, but I would alter the recipe to have about half the amount of onions and more green chilies for spice. Just a personal preference.

I make this  regularly in fall/winter.  What I do differently: I use supermarket rotisserie chicken meat, a LOT more garlic and more cumin and oregano. The best,

recipes are basically a "base" or guideline to follow in my opinion.  I needed to be pushed in the right direction to make a white bean green chili and this one got the highest reviews online.  

with that being said,  I roasted Anaheim peppers,  and tomatillos.  blended it with the garlic.  when my onion was done sauteed,  I added the roasted green chili/ tomatillo mixture to the pot,  sauteed it for 10 minutes. 

my "cooked"chicken was boiled chicken.  so I had a bunch of chicken stock left... I used that instead.  

I didn't use corn,  (I didn't read the suggestions until after I made it). but the sounds like an amazing addition to add sweetness to a savory base.  I will probably roast the corn next time and add it at the end for more texture.  (I was forced to eat creamed corn when I was little and letting it cook down with the chili is just a dark alley I don't want to go down lol). 

this was comfort food to the inth degree.

Notations for my review
Ok.  I made this again tonight... but I did variations.  If anything,  it's my recipe note taking... 

1st, I made a green chili with 2 lbs of fresh roasted tomatillos and 4 fresh Anaheim roasted. 
I sauteed the chili with the onion garlic mixture after the onions and garlic had sauteed.  

2nd... I used only 1 teaspoon of cayenne and it was still kinda spicy (it it's my throat not the tongue). But with my ulcers, I should bump down the spice... 

To cool down the spice,  I would recommend a dollop of sour cream as a topping

So this is just soup I made it and used the advice of less broth and purée the beans and it still turned into liquidy soup. When I think chili I think thick and not watery that was not it.

I have won our local chili cook-off twice with this recipe. I make it as is, but  I let it simmer for more like an hour and a half until it thickens up on its own. I also shred a whole block of Monterey Jack and add it right to the pot at the end. Top with green onions, that's a must. This recipe is truly a winner.

Made this for dinner last night and it turned out awesome! I made few adjustments for my family’s taste (reduced the cayenne by half and added a bit of lime for acidity) and what I had on hand (Mexican cheese blend in place of the jack cheese) garnished it with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkling of cilantro. I will be making this one again but with left over roasted chicken in place of the chicken breasts to get even more flavor!

The whole family loved it. I used one onion instead of two and three cans of beans instead of five. Drained the beans. No cheese. Will definitely make it again. And if you don't like very spicy-hot dishes, cut the cayenne substantially.

This is a great soup for a cold winters day. I doubled the recipe and did purée half the beans to make a richer broth. I also used sodium free broth to cut down on the saltiness some warned of. Cilantro, sour cream and shredded cheese are good garnishes for any chili. I just arranged them in small serving dishes and let people do their own thing. My whole family loved it!! Definitely a keeper.

One of those recipes I can always count on.  I follow the recipe exactly as written and it turns out great.  For a bit less spicy, less cayenne still makes for a tasty meal.  This is not a thick chili, almost more like a soup.

Very easy and delicious recipe. I used pinto beans instead of Northern beans because that is what I had on hand.  Our whole family loved it.  I will definitely be making again. Next time I might up the green chile peppers to 2 cans.

Scrumptious and delightful! My guest loved it. A true white chili. I made a few adjustments: I skipped all the peppers(not a spicy person and you can always add that afterwards to your own bowl), I used one onion, 4 cans of beans and I added a can of white corn (drained). I also steamed/boiled my chicken breast and made sure the meat was seasoned. I used that same water (with all the seasoning from the chicken) and some of the store brought chicken broth. I put in a basil leaf  while it cooked, a little flour to thicken and I put two cans of the beans in the blender to thicken as well (who wants chili soup...not me). I topped with cheese, green onions and sour cream. I served with corn pudding muffins. A huge hit and will make it again! Bon Appetite and Happy Cooking!

Was very good, not too spicy  which is great for me and we added some hatch chilis for my husband.  The sour cream and cheese really add to the chili.  I will definitely make this again.

This is really good!  I reduced the cayenne pepper to just 1 teaspoon, as we don't like too much heat, but the recipe makes so much that I'll use the full 1.5 teaspoons next time.  For those who cut back on the chili peppers, I buy the mild green chilis, and they aren't spicy at all - they just add the absolutely right flavor.   Yes, it is pretty soupy, but very much like the chicken chili our favorite Mexican restaurant makes - and so, so healthy and tasty!

I've made this twice and both times my family of 5 emptied the pot. I used 1 can of chiles, 1 onion, 2 cans of white beans, 3 can chicken broth, and 1 can cream of chicken, and added a small can or corn for my families liking. I used 4 large chicken breast cut into 1" cubes sautéed with rotisserie chicken seasoning.

This is one of my favorite recipes!
However I add extra chicken and omit the cayenne...
We also add a dollop of sour cream!

My husband and I loved this recipe. It was very easy to make! I did cut the recipe in half because there are only two of us.  I put sour cream, avocado slices, Monterey Jack cheese and crushed tortilla chips on top. So good!!

This is delicious.  I cooked the chicken breast in no sodium broth and saved the liquid(strained) to add to the chili.  I added more garlic, white pepper,  half of the cumin and one can of hatch green chiles. This is a keeper recipe.

I puréed 3 can of beans, only used 2 containers of chicken broth and added a container of sour cream and a bag of Monterrey Jack cheese to make it thick and creamy otherwise it was too way too watery.

This was really good. I used one onion since the onions I had were large. I do like my chili a little thicker so I pureed a can of beans and added it at the end to thicken it up a bit and let it simmer uncovered on the stove for a little while until it thickened up. I did cut the cayenne down to 1/2t, I'm a wimp when it comes to heat.  My family really loved it and my husband thought it was the best white chili I've made.

Yummy quick chicken chili, nice on a snowy winter day.  I halved the recipe because I live alone, and added a can of cream of chicken soup per someone else's review to thicken up.  I used white chili beans with jalapenos,so did not add any cayenne or pepper, and I used chicken thighs because I prefer them to white meat.

Followed nearly as written.  Used a bag of dry Great Northern beans, soaked overnight, and roasted the chicken breast, which I shredded.  I'm usually one that uses very little, if any, salt while cooking, and this recipe definitely benefited from its use.  I actually tossed all ingredients in  the slow cooker for a few hours and it was great.  Using the slow cooker, I didn't even precook the beans.  Will definitely make again.

I agree with the suggestions of others. Without adaptations it comes out more like a soup. I added extra, shredded chicken and puréed 1/2 the beans. Served it with a bit of sour cream, shredded cheese and green onions. Delicious! Perfect for a fall evening. Everyone loved it.

I had high hopes for this given the reviews and made some of the adjustment suggested and it was just a huge disappointment. It was watery despite the puréed beans which actually gave it a grainy consistency. The flavor profile was okay but nothing to write home about. I honestly cannot figure out how it garnered such rave reviews and so many stars: it will not be in our dinner rotation, that is for sure.

I made this in a Dutch oven on a camping trip with my nephew and grandson.  The recipe was simple to put together and not much work in a camping environment.  All three of use loved the taste--it is a bit soupy, but I think that adds rather than detracts from the recipe.  We each had several helpings each, and would eat the main ingredients, then tip our bowls up and slurp the juice.  It was awesome.

I cut the recipe in half (cooking for two) and decreased the amount of chilies, oregano and cayenne pepper.   With the half-sized recipe, I added an extra can of pureed great northern beans to thicken.  It is still a bit spicy for me but tastes great.  I have several white chili recipes and this one is in the top two.

I use slightly less cayenne because my family doesn't like spicy...about 1/2.  I also boil my chicken in the broth and spices at medium low temp and then shred it.  A little easier when I make triple sized pots.

I added one can of Rotel tomatoes. Changed the cayenne pepper to 1teaspoon.  Pureed 2 cans of the northern beans. Added 1 tablespoon of sugar cause I find it brings depth to the heat and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  Will serve with tortilla chips broken and a dab of sour cream.  Green onions or cut fresh cilantro leaves would have been a nice touch.

I have been craving white chicken chili for a couple weeks now so decided to give this a try. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe! The only changes I made were I browned my chicken in oil with salt and pepper, let it cool, then shredded; I also could not find ceyenne pepper so I used chili powder and I took the advice of some other reviews and pureed 2 of the 5 cans of beans. Served with homeade corn bread!! Delish!! Will use again!!!

I loved this chili! I made a few changes to fit my tastebuds. I lightly season the chicken, and onions and garlic, while they cooked at seperate times with the Oregon, garlic powder, red pepper powder, and cumin. I added the rest of the ingredients (beans, broth, and another "layer" of the suggested spices),  and a box of  ZATARAIN'S  wild rice seasoned with garlic and onion, and brought it all to a boil. At the end I added juice from from half a lemon (my I adjusted the serving portion for 6), pink sea salt, and black pepper to taste. My man ate it up! I'm still learning to cook, and when he went back for seconds, I knew it was the bomb.com, lol!!! I served it with sweet corn bread as well.

This turned out well. Nice aroma, mildly spicy, nice flavor. A good fall/winter meal. My 12-year old finished it. I had two bowls. Will make it again.

Would go well with a salad beforehand, in my opinion.

Thank you for sharing this recipe. Easy for this single dad.

Made this for a carry-in at work. I left out the green chilies and used the meat from a rotisserie chicken to save time and money.  Huge hit! Shared some leftovers with a friend and they didn't last the night! A word of caution, this is not a recipe to use of you are pregnant and prone to heartburn, they cayenne is a doozie!

Very tasty and easy to make. I did make a couple changes. I took the advice of others and blended 2 cans of the beans to ticken it up. Instead of 5 can altogether i used 6 and then one can of black beans. A dash of salt was added too in the end. This was for a church dinner and several people really really loved it!

I made this tonight for my husband and we loved it! He doesn't like so many beans but that was the only change that I made. I used just one can of beans but the flavor is so delicious. The spices are correct for our taste. I sent the remaining chili to my in-laws and my mother-in-law raved about it! I like to serve this with white corn chips and a big dollop of sour cream on top.

I used leftover roterrsie chicken,  and roasted 3 anihiem chilies instead of using can. I puree 2 of the 5 cans to give it the creamy texture. I also used unsalted chicken stock to control sodium level. I didn't add the cheese, and no one missed it.

Used Turkey rather than chicken and low sodium broth.  I wound up adding bullion to offset low sodium.  I cut spices in half because I don't like spicy.   The only thing that saved this for us was the cheese.  I wouldn't make it again.

I added some roasted corn that we had left over from grilling, used a rotisserie chicken that was from the grocery store that a visiting friend forgot, used three cans of beans one without the juice, one yellow onion and some whiite that was left over in the fridge, added coriander and some white pepper, some cumin, extra stock and some water.  After all soup is a great way to turn left over or ready to toss ingredients into a mouth watering dish like this!

Very good. After tasting, I added another teaspoon or so of cumin for more flavor. Followed advice of other users and pureed 2 cups of the beans to make thicker. We also added 1 drained can of corn to increase the veggie count. Garnished each bowl with a squeeze of lime, dollop of sour cream and fresh cilantro. Served with Cornbread Muffins I from this site (my go-to cornbread recipe). Great meal!

This was a very easy and tasty white chili.  I omitted the cumin, used the broth from the chicken boiled and used 2 tsp. garlic powder in place of the garlic.  Warm Corn Bread a perfect side. But a little warning: A lot of beans for sensitive stomachs.

Delicious and highly recommend.  Only change I made was following the recommendation to blend two cans of beans to make the soup a little thicker.  Made some homemade crusty bread to go with it.  Yum!

This is hands down the most quickest and tastiest white chili I have made. I did make an adjustment,  instead of using the 3 can of  peppers I charred 3 poblano peppers and used that. I personal enjoy a roasted pepper taste.

Enjoy this recipe...I soaked my beans over night (1.19)...I then used 2 leg quarters, bone in (came 5 in family pack at 7.50)...(3.00 in quarters)...Added 1 teaspoon of salt. I then added the rest of the recipe and let simmer and cook for 2-21/2 hours.  I also made brown rice to serve it over...I was wonderful with or without the cheese.

Tried this chili adjusting the cayenne to half a teaspoon and still plenty spicy for my family. I also puréed 2 cans of chick peas to make it creamier and added a can of Mexican corn just for fun. Also added 2 chopped green peppers. Very tasty!

I love this recipe and make it all of the time! I do add cardamom to it which adds a great full spicy taste. I also use canned green chile to thicken it. I made it tonight and added garbanzo beans. It's so easy and so delicious! Play with it and have fun!

I was looking for a recipe as a base for making a BIG pot for a repasse, and this was good for starters.  I'm one of those creative type that enjoys adding 'other' things for bulk.  Precooked 16 oz of mixed bean soup.  Then added in cooked 3 whole chickens, and added just the meat.   1 large onion, 5 stalks of celery, a few cut up red potatoes (great way to clear out your fridge) Added 1 16 oz Goya Cilantro base, 3 Bay leaves, 2 1/2 TBS of Cumin, Oregano, 1 or more TBS of ADOBO all purpose seasoning to taste.  Can of Rotell chilis AND two cans of cream corn.  1 can of Fiesta Nacho Cheese by Campbell (would have added two)  Another idea - if you have it on hand - cream cheese as a thickener.  I would avoid cornstarch OR flour as it detracts from the taste.   So far, it tastes awesome!  Give it another day to mellow the flavors, and I bet it will go over very well :-)    Juliana in South Jersey

This was so tasty!  My boys loved it and so did I.  I did as other reviewers suggested and put two of the cans of beans in the blender to help thicken it up.  I also added only 1 can of the green peppers to keep the spice level down for my younger son.  We put a dollop of sour cream on top and also added some freshly ground pepper to my bowl.  Will definitely keep this recipe for future meals!

Great recipe, just substitute boxed organic chicken stock for the broth -  commercially prepared broth makes it a little too salty, and some of them have msg.

I made some alterations based on other's suggestions & this was great! My fiance loves it and is excited for us to make it again! Changes: 1 onion instead of 2, 3 jalepinos instead of the canned peppers, 2 cans of chicken broth instead of 3, a sprinkle of red pepper flakes instead of the cayane pepper (what I had), added some salt and pepper and blended 2 of the 5 cans of beans in the blender with some white wine & olive oil. I also added a couple cups of fresh spinach because we like spinach. To cook up the chicken, I poached it with a mixture of chicken broth, white wine, bay leaf, pepper & majoriam and then shredded it.

Wow! This turned out excellent! I, like others, pureed 2 of the 5 cans of beans in the blender and added it to the mixture. We also only used 2 cans of the chicken broth. Turned out perfect! This recipe will be added to our favorites!

I loved this recipe, my new favorite soup.  Second time I made it based on previous reviews I used the following modifications: 2 cans of chicken stock, pureed two of the cans of beans, used one can of cream of chicken soup, and instead of the spices in the menu used one packet of McCormicks Chicken Chili mix, turned out great.  I also shredded the chicken, definitely worth the time.

I boiled a whole chicken until it was falling apart and added water as needed.  I used the chicken from this and the broth from this instead of buying canned chicken broth. (I used about 5-1/2 cups of the broth.) I omitted the cajun seasoning and used 1 can of chillies because we didn't want it too spicy.  I added salt, 1 tsp of garlic powder and 1 tsp onion powder. I also pureed two of the cans of beans to make the soup thicker.  It was perfect!!!!

Soooo good. I added a pack of buttery homestyle instant mashed potatoes to thicken it, and I left out the green peppers. We also only added one onion, but I think we could have put more in it and it still taste good. Also added drained can chicken because it was already cooked and easy. Took it to school for a project and there was NONE left! (: Yum.

Excellent. Only used 1/2 tsp cayenne to suit my kids, still had a little kick.  Added frozen silver queen white corn, and served with dollop of sour cream.

This is a good White Chicken Chili.  (I only had 4 cans of Northern beans and 1 can of Chopped Green Chilies on hand & that seemed like enough!)  and I added some Old Bay & celery seed.  But this is a good recipe!!

I tried this recipes on my son's family B-day party.  It was a big hit, the only thing that I changed up was I used ground turkey breast instead of chicken.  Most people asked for the recipe & all wanted to take some home with them.  Thank god I tripled the recipe.

This was very good.  I made several modifications to suit my personal taste.  I added chili powder, doubled the garlic, doubled the cumin, added onion powder, tomatoes, green peppers, corn, and black beans, then added sour cream when I served it.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because it was very thin, as others stated.  Next time I will try pureeing some of the beans as many others have suggested.  Great cold weather soup overall!!

We loved it!  I modified a bit...put a little less cayenne pepper (3/4 teaspoon) and only 4oz can of green chiles.  It was just warm enough.  I loved that it made enough for a family of 5 (with teenagers) enough for 2 nights!

I heeded the advice of some of the reviews (in regards to 5 cans of beans being A LOT). I also was short some ingredients, so I improvised. 

I just put 2 cans of beans (only had 1 Northern, so I used 1 can of light pinto beans). I threw the chicken in there as raw cubes, and I think it was just 3 chicken breast fillets (next time I will use more b/c my husband raved about the chicken's flavor). I just used a little dried minced onion because wow: 2 onions? No way. I only used 1 can of green chiles (the only kind you should ever use: HATCH!!). And we didn't use cheese at the end. 

Next time I'm going to try with 3 cans of beans and a little more chicken...and of course more Hatch green chiles. 

It was SO delicious! My husband, who is relatively picky, absolutely loved it. We're making it a regular dish in this house for sure.

Oh, and I had no problems with it being watery as discussed in some reviews. I even used the same amount of broth it called for, regardless of me cutting back on the beans.

Really good, they were skeptical at first but my family loved it. Really goes good with some sweet corn bread. I also pureed 2 cans of the beans to give it some body, other than that I followed the directions exactly. Very yummy!

This is amazing.  I was highly skeptical about white chili, but this is soooooo tasty.  I made a couple of slight changes:  1) I pureed 2 of the cans of beans, 2) I added one 15 1/4 oz can of white shoe peg corn, and 3) I used pepper jack cheese.  I followed all other instructions and amounts per the original recipe.  Everyone loved this!

I made this chili on a cold and wet Saturday afternoon. My kids all said it was the best chili they'd ever had, even my teenage stepdaughter downed two bowls!  I couldn't find my cumin so I substituted some chili powder and pepper, and left out the cayenne.  I followed other reviewers advice and blended two cans of the beans in the blender, and added a can of black beans for color.  The whole family now wants this every rainy weekend.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My mom had been begging me to find a recipe for white chili.  After sorting through many, I chose to make this one.  I used one can of chilis and one large poblano pepper that I added almost as soon as there was liquid so it broke down really nicely.  Now, every time I offer to cook, they all want this white chili.

Delicious flavor but was not "chili" consistency. Next time, I will do like others and blend some of the cans of beans. I did not use cheese to cut down on calories and tasted delicious without it.

Sooo very good!  I only used 2 cans of chicken broth (I like a thicker chili), only 1 tsp oregano (could forego this altogether), and increased to 2 tsp of cayenne.  I pureed 2 of the 5 cans of beans.  FANTASTIC!  Will definitely make this again!

I found the broth a little too bitter.  Added a couple of chopped carrots and celery stalks to the onion and garlic.  Added approximately 1/4 C of peanut butter and two tablespoons of honey, and two of sugar.  Reheated with brown rice.  Not bad.

I really liked this recipe.  I had to make modifications because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I scaled down the recipe to 6 servings and used 2 15 oz. cans of black beans and 1 20 oz. can of cannelinni beans.  I also added about 1/2 cup of corn.  I didn't have left over chicken so I cut up some chicken in cubes, seasoned it with cumin, cayenne, oregeno and lightly browned it.  Then I set it aside and poured some of the chicken broth on it to soak in while preparing the balance of the recipe.  I took heed and also mashed up about 3/4 cup of the beans to thicken.  Yummmmm!

This is great chili! I baked the chicken with spices and shredded. Drained the beans and processed 1 can (but used the full amount of chicken broth). The consistency was fine. I also doubled the cumin to add more flavor. The spice was just right. Being he southwest, I would call this "medium" Goes great with Green Tabasco and a dollop of sour cream!

YUM! Perfect for Winter Months!
I used low-fat cream of chicken with a bit of the regular, no fat chicken broth to thicken it up a bit.  I also put some chili powder in it too for spice.  So delicious - serve with some garlic toast for dipping!

I altered the recipe just a bit after reading some of the reviews and also pureed 2 cans of the beans to thicken. Also used a can of cannellini beans(the white kidney beans) and it turned out excellent!!!! A little spicy for my 5 year old but easily toned down with less spice and/or chiles. My family loved it!!

this is good. I have had better white chili, but can't find the recipe. I added more cayenne pepper and dissolved a tablespoon of corn starch to make it thicker. I also use pepper jack cheese for the garnish.

Spicy... but otherwise bland.  White Chili I was the first chicken chili I ever prepared, and we much prefer that recipe -- it uses dried cilantro and green onions.

This was the first time I had ever tried white chilli. I was a little suprised, not what I had imagined. It was however very good. I enjoyed left overs for lunch, even better the next day. I would cut back on both the oregano and the cumin, but add garlic salt and red pepper flakes. Careful with both, as a little goes a long way!  I used colby monteray jack cheese, and I think it really complemented the taste. Give it a try.

This a great recipe. I boiled a chicken instead of canned broth and boneless breast meat. I also added a can of diced tomatoes and served with toppings of crushed tortilla chips, sour cream, shredded sharp cheddar cheese and chives. My guests loved it and I would definitely make this recipe again.

I was really surprised with this recipe.  It was great and my husband had seconds.  I added more cumin and less chicken broth (about 1 and 1/2 cans) to the recipe.  I then chopped green onions and cilantro, placed sour cream and cheddar cheese out so we could add to the dish as we wished.  I think having the leftovers were even better.

This was a very nice variety of chilli, I loved the spicy flavor combined with the cheese.  I used 2 cups of cheese instead of one.

Okay.  Not bursting with flavor, although my guests liked it more than I did.  It just seems to lack oomph...maybe some green Tabasco sauce would perk it up a bit?

This is delicious!  I used one large can of chicken instead of the fresh and also used fresh chilies instead of the canned.  I'd definitely recommend this to others.

Excellent!  We love this recipe.  I cut up some fresh green onions, tomotoes, jalepenos, and had some cheese all on the table for toppings.  It was a smash hit. Good luck!

My husband and I loved this soup.  What a warmer-upper on a cold winter night.  I used a whole chicken simmered for an hour with the onion.  3 cans of beans were plenty.  Great recipe!
