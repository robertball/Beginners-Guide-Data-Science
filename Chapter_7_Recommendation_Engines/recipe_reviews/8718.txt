The taste is a five, but next time we will do things a bit differently.  First, using a whole chicken made it harder to cook through without burning.  Next time, we will cut it up into small pieces like chicken nuggets.  Second, there wasn't nearly enough cayenne.  Next time, we'll double it at least!  This recipe takes time if you have a small skillet, so you better be a fried chicken lover to spend the hours.

I prepared this recipe as directed. I was disappointed at the outcome and my family was less than impressed. I will not be making this anytime soon.

Far superior to the fried chicken recipes I tried before. I substituted boneless skinless chicken breasts since we buy them frozen in 3lb bags and always have them on hand. Added a bit more cayenne since my husband usually complains the fried chicken recipes are "bland" and it came out nicely.  cut them into stips to make chicken "fingers" and served with french fries.

This is a great recipe.  I did not have shortening on hand, so used corn oil with the bacon grease---my husband raved over the taste!!  We will definitely make it again.

I am so sorry but I was just not impressed with this chicken.  It was okay, but I thought it was very bland, so did my hubby.  It was also kind of greasy.  I checked my oil temp and it was fine so don't know what the problem was,  Thanks for posting the recipe.

Sadly we thought this was terribly bland.  The breading wasn't thick and there was pretty much no taste.  The chicken was nice and moist due to the buttermilk marinade, so I gave it 2 stars.  Won't be making this version of fried chicken again.

This recipe is the closest to mine I've ever seen. I make just a few changes. I use marjoram instead of thyme, garlic powder, seasoned salt, and pepper to season about 4 c flour and also dip the chicken in an egg wash before dredging in the seasoned flour. The bacon fat is essential, IMHO, to the very best fried chicken. This recipe was my mother's, and my family would eat it every week!

I think the temp is a little off on this recipe. I would set it just a tad lower next time since my chicken got a little darker than I like. Otherwise, great flavor, the kids loved it!
