Delicious, healthy apple salad.  It's especially versatile because you can use any type of apples, grapes, or yogurt that you happen to have in your frig.  I used strawbery-banana yogurt with gala apples and green grapes.

This was easy to make but I didn't find it all too flavorful.  I think if the nuts were candied it would be better.

For some reason, I just dread cutting grapes in half, so it took me awhile to muster up the energy to make this.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was quite good.  The only thing is; I'm not sure about the celery.  I don't think it goes well with the rest of the ingredients.  When I make this again, I think I'll leave out the celery and add dried cranberries or something instead.  Other than not caring for the celery, I enjoyed the salad.  Thanks for the recipe!

we all loved this!!  simple, kept for a while and HEALTHY - I love that I could allow my kiddos to have seconds and thirds and fourths and know they weren't eating anything that was bad for them!  Will make this from now on, when I'm asked to bring a fruit salad!

5 stars when you use dried tart cherries instead of the grapes!

I diced the apples and replaced the walnuts with a fresh peach (skin on).  I served this with dinner but I had the leftovers with my breakfast and it was a great way to start the day!

Made this for Thanksgiving, the next time I make this I will Maraschino cherries and juice to give it a little sweet taste.  It was too tart for me using Granny Smith apples and I will use Pink Lady or Braeburn apples the next time also.  Make sure to make the night before so the yogurt has a chance to set up.

I Really appreciate this recipe because I live out in the country and needed a fruit salad to take to a gathering. But I do not have everything in my cupboards. So this is what I did. I used a bag of gala apples , celery, walnuts and The dried cherries as someone else suggested.( no fresh grapes) I had Greek yogurt which does not have sweetener or fruit added. So I used some leftover raspberry pie filling I had in the refrigerator.  I mixed the pie filling and the lemon juice with the freshly cut apples. stirred that up, added the celery, nuts and yogurt. From that point it was on the tart side so I added a couple tablespoons of brown sugar and some maraschino cherry juice. YUMMO!! made a yummy salad let me tell ya!!
