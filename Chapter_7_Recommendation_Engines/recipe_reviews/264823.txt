only my second time cooking with coconut flour. Hubby & i are doing a modified Keto diet & I was DYING for pancakes.  I didn't have heavy cream, so i substituted Half & Half. Batter was thick & lumpy. Added a little extra cream, vanilla & a splash of water to thin it out. Taste is actually pretty good. The texture of the coconut flour is takes a little getting used to and you can definitely taste it.  Personally,  i think they are sweet enough & don't even need syrup.

No changes made. Definitely taste eggy which I donâ€™t mind but some might. I will definitely make these again maybe adding some dark chocolate chips. Also may try to have my eggs room temperature and the melted butter cooled before combining.

very thick batter, added a little water ,  the coconut flour gives it a different texture. Good taste.

These were super easy and yummy. They tasted like a breakfast muffin, spongy and rich but not too sweet. I followed the recipe exactly. There was a little too much butter for my taste, but my husband loved them. I'll definitely keep this recipe and play with it a bit. Thanks!
