These turned out SO DELICIOUS! I used the recipe as a base and then added a few more things that we like.  I think the original recipe would be super good too, just wanted to throw  some more things that we had.  Along with all the  listed ingredients I also added about 3/4 cup peanut butter to help it stick together and for flavor.  I didn't have any applesauce so I used shredded apple.  I only used 1 1/2 - 2 cups of the quinoa and 3 cups of oatmeal. They turned out moist but firm enough to eat like a granola bar.    Basically keep adding stuff until you get the flavor and consistency you like and smoosh it down firmly in the 9x13 dish. Will definitely be a staple in our house!

This is AWESOME!  My toddler and preschooler thought it was cookie dough the night I made it! I put it in mini muffin tins and then let it "dry out" overnight and it was more like a dense muffin, and they still loved it :)

The first time I made this recipe I grumbled a whole lot.  The process, as written, is unpleasant and difficult.  I added all of the ingredients to the food processor as directed and while the ingredients close to the blade were chopped and mixed, the bulk of them sat undisturbed.  I ended up adding more applesauce, which allowed everything to blend into a gluey paste.  As anticipated, when I added the quinoa mixture to the remaining ingredients additional oats were required to get a decent consistency.  I ran out of oats and used a bit of granola.  I felt the result was still too moist and so ended up baking the bars for about 10 minutes.  As I mentioned, I grumbled a lot and felt the recipe was not well executed.  I decided to withhold judgement, however, until my 12, 17, and 22 year old sons gave me their votes.  They all 3 LOVED them.  One of them said it was like a Cliff Bar but better because it was moist.  The second and third times I made this recipe I ground the dates first and used about 3/4 of a cup of applesauce.  I baked them for about 10 minutes at 325 degrees.  They turned out beautifully and were a lot easier to make.  Nutritionally speaking, these are fabulous.  I have 2 athletes who need a lot of protein and didn't like feeding them the chocolate covered store-bought bars.  The core recipe is versatile and can be adjusted to suit your taste.  I added hemp hearts and additional coconut.  I made one batch of cherry walnut bars, and a second of peanut butter ch

Great idea with the quoina.  But the kids did not like the flavor.  I Put in 1/4 cup brown sugar but it did not work.

This tasted like a brick and looked like one too. I don't know what I did wrong but it was never not sticky. I used double the ground oats. Still sticky. I also don't know why the flavor was so gross.

These protein bars were bland and time-consuming to make. I had to separate the first part of the recipe into two batches because my Kitchen Aid food processor had difficulty dicing up the dates. For anyone considering making this recipe - I would recommend running just the dates alone in the food processor before adding the other ingredients. I also added a few tablespoons of almond butter and peanut butter, a bit of cocoa powder, and dark chocolate chips for added flavour.
