Ok, made this tonight and it was very good. Will be making it again and will change some ingredients. Add spinach or zucchini or mushrooms since I've used these in my baked Lasagnas. Will add more garlic and experiment with different pasta sauces. Will try with Italian sausage too. I like having a way to make lasagna fast and easy like this. Plus in summer no oven to overheat the kitchen.

Very good! I did change it up a bit because I didn't have no-boil noodles. Boiled the pasta separately, mixed everything together along with some shredded Italian cheese blend and topped with a little mozzarella. Baked at 350 for 20 minutes. Yum. Thanks :)

I'll make it again but with changes--the dressing is not necessary and actually makes the dish greasy.  It is obviously a Kraft sponsored recipe, so they try to get as many of their products as possible in the recipe.  A teaspoon of Italian Seasoning adds the necessary flavor without the oil.  I didn't have oven ready noodles, used the regular ole lasagna noodles and they were fine.  I used shredded mozzerella on top which was yummy!  I also used a can of Hunt's Spaghetti sauce and it was fine.  I think with adjustments it can be a 5 star.  The dressing just doesn't cut it for me.

I have made this a few times always a hit.  I have added mushrooms and red pepper and onion very good.  Like it better without the ricotta cheese.  That is just a personal choice.  Very good leftovers!

This is a great quick and easy crowd-pleaser. Definatly add the ricotta cheese to it, as well i like to add a little more garlic as well as oregano and basil to the sauce. Also, i find a nice touch is to sautee 1/2 an diced onion with the meat.

Family liked it.  I did put ricotta in mix but also reserved some. Put whole recipe in a casserole , and put reserved ricotta on top then added the recipe additional cheese.  Placed in the oven @ 350 for about 20 minutes to get the baked bubbly toasty brown of the cheese just like lasagne.  A hit. A keeper.

Delicious and easy. I was skeptical at first because my no boil noodles didn't crack in quarters but more like 'shards'...but ultimately worked out. Had to separate noodles as they cooked so they weren't all glued together, was a little scary (and ugly) but as soon as I put the cheese on top to 'hide' the fairly odd looking noodles, it looked fine and tasted great too. I added some chopped pepperoni and extra garlic. I sprinkled some oregano, basil, parm cheese and a drizzle of olive oil on top of the mozzarella. Made it ahead of time due to kids sports schedules and we nuked our own plates as needed.....was even better after it sat for a bit, flavors really developed and 'noodles' had a better consistency. Definitely will make again, any 'add ins' you like will definitely work.

So easy and good!  I added mushrooms, 1/2 chopped up onion, chopped up pepperoni, and 1 Tbs italian seasoning.  Great for when you're craving lasagna, yet don't have time to bake it.

OMG! This was so awesome and easy. The only changes I made was using on green pepper and using one onion. I didn't have minced garlic so for seasoning I used Italian seasoning and garlic/onion powder. We ate this with some left over cornbread. YUMMY!

Wow!So much faster than the usual layered lasagna, but tastes just as good if not better! I was honestly impressed. I threw in a small can of mushrooms,diced up an onion also.. and I did the extra step with ricotta cheese (I think this is what makes the dish so great) I will be printing this, and keeping it in my allrecipes binder for continued use!! =)

This was great.  My husband loved it and had four helpings. I added a package of frozen spinach as well as frozen sliced mushrooms and some frozen red and yellow peppers that I diced to add some veggies for the kids.  It turned out great and we will definitely be making it again.

This was super easy and super yummy!  I didn't add the peppers though which made it even easier.  I even forgot the fresh garlic and just used garlic powder and it was still amazing.  However, I did add a pinch of  crusted red pepper for a slight kick.  The ricotta cheese is a must!  This recipe has all the flavor of a great lasagna without all the prep work!  I will make this again and again!

I really enjoyed this one (and because I made a full recipe for just my husband and me, I really enjoyed all the leftovers too!). I didn't have any Italian dressing in the house, so I used Kraft's Sun Dried Tomato and Oregano. I did as another reviewer suggested and browned the meat and then drained the fat. I also added more veggies (always looking for ways to get more veggies in my meals) - added mushrooms and zucchini along with the green pepper (which I reduced to 1 since I added the other ones) and onion. I really enjoyed it - different from just regular spaghetti, but definitely not as much work as lasagna.

LOVED this dish. I made a couple adjustments to make it a little heathier - I used lean ground turkey meat instead of beef. I used reduced fat cheese and reduced fat ricotta - honestly, couldnt tell the difference! Also, I followed some of the other users suggestion to add a little more garlic, as well as basil and oregano. Everything turned out perfectly.. will definitely make this one again!

I made the recipe to a T but found that the noodles were lacking in overall texture, would rather have the original lasagna noodles. The flavor was nice however so its still a great recipe!

I was concerned about the lack of spices in this recipe but it turned out better than expected. It was very tasty! I used ground turkey that I sauteed in olive oil first instead of the ground beef.   Next time I will probably add the ricotta cheese and use some sweet turkey Italian sausage for more flavor.

This was terrific!  So much easier than regular lasagna.  Both of my kids loved it and cleaned their plates, and that hardly every happens with a new dish.  My husband was also impressed with a surprised "yummm!".

I used low-cal dressing, added some extra Italian spice, and skipped the peppers as we are not fans of them.

I also added cottage cheese rather than ricotta (family recipe).  Once the noodles were cooked, I poured it into a casserole dish, added the cheese, and broiled it in the oven to melt.  It made it easier to get lots of cheese for each serving.

I should have followed other reviewers suggestions and added more garlic, salt, onion, something to give it more flavor.  Made as written, it is nearly flavorless and we did not even keep the half of pan we had leftover.  Like the idea of the quicker version of lasagna, though.  Thanks!

Yummy! Needed approx 1/2 cup water than noted in the recipe just so I had enough to mostly cover my noodles so they would cook. Could be because I used a large skillet though so the mixture was fairly spread out. I also followed the advice of others and used Italian seasoning instead of dressing and I did add the ricotta.

Delicious, listened to others and used: 1 green bell pepper, 1 zucchini, 1 yellow squash, 1 medium sized onion, 6 cloves of garlic crushed, FAT FREE dressing, and ground turkey instead of beef. Turned out great, super easy, less than 30 minutes.  Also, I forgot to get the ricotta for the 'extra' step, so I added in 3 oz of goat cheese and used 1/4 C of mozzarella instead.  DIVINE!

Awesome - we didn't have italian dressing and used Ceasar parmesan and we were blown away. Only problem is the noodles stick together. Other changes we made was only 1 green pepper, added a red pepper, small onion and mushrooms.

This was super good. It is a versatile recipe.  I used chicken instead of beef because that was all I had. I also cooked the chicken and bell peppers with some onions in a skillet and cooked the noodles (didnt have oven ready). Then combined everything in the skillet but omitted the water, sprinkled with mozzarella cheese and served it up.  Everyone loved it.

The boy and I really enjoyed this.  I love lasagna and this was a good, quick version.  Followed the recipe closely, only change was I didn't have the right noodles.  I used homemade sauce... it was good!  Definitely quick and easy, even without the "oven-ready" noodles.  Will surely make again.

I have made this several times.  It is one of my quick throw together meals when the family is coming over for dinner.  I serve it with salad and garlic bread, make a light dessert and I am done.  I always use the riccota.  I have done both with the noodles, using the no boil and also regular lasagna noodles. I feel more confident using the regular noodles. I boil the regular noodles seperately first, then mix it all together.

Yummy!  I wanted to make lasagne, but did not want to assemble it.  Found this wonderful dish.  My hubby, son, and brother just raved about it.  Made it as the recipe called for.  Will try just seasoning and no the salad dressing next time.  I did use Lite Italian Dressing! Delicious!

I had to make a few changes to it. I didn't have lasagne noodles so, I just used rotini noodles. I added two pasta sauce bottles instead of on. I also added more Italian dressing. Topping it off with mozzarella cheese is great. The combination between the pasta sauce and Italian dressing goes well together and was a hit. My mother is a picky eater and she went for seconds.

Made this last night and it was DELICIOUS!  My husband wanted a THIRD helping!  I also added the chopped onion and minced garlic to the ground beef and cooked that, then followed the remaining recipe but added even more peppers than recipe called for, worked just fine!  Used fat free version of dressing.  Used the oven ready lasagne noodles and you really need to keep stirring it often and "unsticking" the noodles from each other but that wasn't a problem for me.  If you like Ricotta cheese, DEFINTELY add that step, it makes it truly taste like lasagne!  Extremely quick and easy dish, one that most people can make to their tastes.  This is a definite keeper in our meal rotation as well!

I made some minor modifications out of necessity but they didnt change the core of the recipe. Instead of bell peppers I used zucchini, instead of ground beef I used ground turkey, instead of pre-made dressing I used the dry seasoning packet that you use to make your own and in doing so I slightly reduced the amount of oil it called for. 

All-in-all this was a DELICIOUS recipe that all 3 of my children really liked. I will definitely make it again. :)   I loved only having 1 saucepan to clean when it was done!

Made it. Added ricotta cheese and extra seasonings. It was alright. Tasted like the flavors weren t fully developed. It would be easier to make with a different type of noodle. Probably won t make again.
