I made this exactly as stated. Here are my problems with it. Not enough flavor. Need more seasoning of some sort. Wrong kind of cheese for me, I like cheese in Enchiladas that is melted & very runny. The cheddar doesn't melt good enough. The processed cheese: I took it to mean Velveeta. Here is what I would do if I made this again. I would put the Velveeta on the inside of them & put the cheddar on the outside of them. I did sprinkle a little on after I got out of oven, because the Velveeta had kinda dried in place & didn't look good. I would also add some cayenne & jalapenos for more flavor. I would cook it longer also (covered with a lid to hold the moisture). But, it was just OK for me.

I had spent the day making a pork green chili in the crockpot and when I came across this recipe, decided to try it with my homemade chili for a quick and easy dinner.  I used what I had on hand, so I substituted flour tortillas for the corn, I had a partial jar of a medium queso cheese dip that I needed to use up, so I used it instead of the processed cheese and I skipped the onion completely as it was in my homemade chili.  I warmed the flour tortillas in the micro, filled them  with cheddar cheese, rolled as the recipe states and topped w/ the chili cheese sauce.  Baked as directed.  My husband and I both thought this was very good.  I topped the enchiladas with sour cream and a medium salsa.  I'll definitely make this again, but will be sure to have corn tortillas on hand when I do as I think they would lend a more authentic mexican flavor to the dish.

yummy! of course i made a few changes... i combined all the ingredients first, and used them as both filling and topping. also, i used pre-shredded 'mexican blend' cheese, flour tortillas, and added a can of corn (to get the veggies snuck in!)... and it was scrumptious! i will certainly make it again!

This is AWESOME!!!  I made it essentially as directed.  The only difference was that I used about a 50/50 mix of cheddar and shredded Velveeta (WARNING!  BUY PRE-SHREDDED VELVEETA!!! DO NOT TRY TO SHRED YOUR OWN VELVEETA!!! WHAT A MESS!!!)for the filling. Also, I grated the onion, and squeezed the excess moisture out using a tea towel, and topped the enchiladas with that and the remaining half of the cheddar cheese. Reminded me of the best parts of a Frito pie and enchiladas.  These are a staple in our house from now on!!!

Used leftover home made chili instead of canned and warmed the corn tortillas in the microwave. Processed cheese like Velveeta isn't available where I live, I used cheddar for the inside and grated Gouda on top.

This is the easiest enchilada recipe and so very good.  I was a little skeptical at first because I thought it would come out dry and with no flavor since there is no enchilada sauce. But it doesn’t need it all. I also added ground beef to the inside of the enchiladas with the cheese. Tastes just like the enchiladas from a restaurant. Best part, not that many ingredients you need to make this.

The one right thing in this recipe are the corn tortillas.  I could agree with the use of chili to top the enchiladas if it was homemade, this would make it Tex-Mex.  However, the use of Velveeta is not a traditional Mexican ingredient.  Tex-Mex can sometimes use this recipe but most people I know find it objectionable.  I live in Texas so I can safely say what is Tex-Mex.  It is not necessary to use canned and processed foods when our Mexican family proves that it is not hard to make these another way.  I make my own enchilada sauce and my own chili.  They are both so easy to make from scratch and I believe healthier.  We use a finely grated Longhorn or Mexican cheese mix for our enchiladas.  For an easy chili, just chop some onion, celery, and bell pepper.  Use about 3 to 4 tablespoons of a mild chili powder (guests can add hot sauce to their taste.)  Use cumin and oregano, tomato juice or V8 (1 cup) or combo of such with a can of tomato sauce (10 oz. can), and I use Better Than  Bouillon chicken broth to taste (2 cups).  I brown my ground beef (3 lbs.), drain, then add it last to finish cooking.  For maximum flavor, I pressure cook for 3 minutes but it is not necessary.  Easy.   When I make chili Colorado, I use the beef cut for beef stew or cut up left over roast and the rest of the ingredients are pretty much the same.  Easy.

Here's what I do. Add more ground beef to the chili! Trust me it makes a world of difference in flavor. I added meat, cooked it and then heated the tortillas in the pan. Then I put the chili meat mixture INSIDE the tortillas and rolled em up. Once that was done I coated them with tons an tons of shredded cheese- I used Mexican blend. Delicious :) ad better with hot sauce.

You could use Stagg Chili for this recipe. I dip my corn tortillas in enchilada sauce after frying and before filling. It gives them a better texture and more flavor. A medium cheddar is the best for this recipe. It melts great and has great flavor. This is a keeper. It makes for an easy weeknight dinner.

My family really loved this dish! I was trying to use items on hand so we had flour instead of corn tortillas, and I had some left over london broil that I used as part of the filling. I will definitely make this again!

I made this for Christmas dinner.  It was amazing!  The only changes I made was that I added my own beef mixture instead of doing cheese enchiladas (we don't like plain cheese enchiladas).  The leftovers were even better!  I will definitely be making this one again!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated but felt the results were only okay.  I love the idea of this recipe so I will probably try it again with the following changes:  I will use leftover chili that I have made from scratch or at the very least a better quality canned chili.  I used Hormel and didn't love it.  I will also probably swap out the velveeta for regular shredded cheese.  Normally I like velveeta but it seemed a bit out of place here.  I think this would be a great recipe to use up leftover chili so I plan to use it only that way in the future.

I ATTEMPTED to make this recipe as is but ended up having to adjust as I went. I used (8) 6” tortillas, based on the size of my baking dish. As I mixed the chili I noticed the 1/2 processed cheese was just not going to be the right ratio per chili mixture...so I put the whole lb in. I also found that for me, filling the 6” tortillas...(1) 16 oz of shredded cheese was enough. I used the second package of shredded cheese as my topping instead of the remaining processed cheese (which remember I put in the chili mixture). I probably could’ve minimized the amount I put on the enchiladas before baking and used the extra as a chili mix for dip or soups BUT I can try that for next time. For now....this is what I ended up with (picture). I’m about ready to try it. ??

I didn't make any changes. It reminds me of chili cheese fries but with tortilla!. Not gourmet, but a nice change from the plain cheese quesadillas we usually go to when we want something quick. Reheated leftovers are good, too. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

Made this with little changes. I stuffed the tortillas with (cooked)ground beef, shredded cheese, and chili and then topped with more chili and cheese then baked it. My family LOVED it. :)

Great Recipe for Race Day! I added 2 Tbs of Taco seasoning and fried corn to the chili, then topped it with sour cream and green onions. Perfect combination of flavor and texture!

I'd call this ok, not great. The chili and onions just didn't have enough flavor and wasn't firm enough. It basically tastes like Wolf Brand Chili and some onion  Easy to make though!

I grew up with this recipe. Never knew another way to make it. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. One of my favorite dishes. WITH Wolf Brand Chili (no beans). I honestly cant eat enchiladas any other way.

I've repeated my Mom's exact recipe, who used to make this countless times over the years, finding this recipe on the back of most cans of Wolf Brand. Very good dinner, frying up fresh tortilla chips & salsa, and side of re-fried beans.  If making full dozen in 9" X 12" baking dish, best having 2 16oz cans of Wolf Brand Chile.

Oh my goodness I made it almost exactly how the recipe said. 
 I added a bit of the shredded cheddar to the top along with the processed (Velveeta) cheese and my boyfriend and I absolutely loved it.  So full of flavor and paired nicely with a garden salad.I shared my leftovers with my coworker and she now wants the recipe to make for dinner tonight.  sorry for not posting a picture... it  looked so delicious I didn't have time to grab my phone.

My high school Culinary Arts classes made this.  It was pretty simple and they did a great job.  This was served with a side salad.

I made it as written but wish I would have added more cheese and spices. It was good but bland. When I make it again I will change up the recipe.
