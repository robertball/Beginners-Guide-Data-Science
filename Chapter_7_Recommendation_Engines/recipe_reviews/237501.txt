Recipe as is except we used firm tofu - dredged  in organic spelt flour then gently air dried under muslin... used ground pinenuts  and organic applesauce  as dip... really wowed our quilting group as our main course.


Dogs didn't care for though...  will make again for some off-grid meetings.

These are perfect for when you couldn't care less about your diet. The sauce is delicious, goes well with celery and carrots, too. Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious! I made it to drizzle over zucchini cakes. The consistency is such that it would make a great salad dressing.  As is, though, there wasn't enough heat, so I added about 3 more tablespoons of sriracha. We like it really hot!

OK, so this isn't exactly the healthiest meal in the world, but we both loved it. I used one can of Cheese Spam and one can of Jalapeno Spam, and while they were both awesome, the jalapeno was better. For the sauce, I went heavy on the garlic and the Sriracha, and I discovered too late that I was out of paprika, so I used cumin instead to still add a smoky flavor, and it was great.

Deliciously salty and the kids loved them!  The key is making sure they are crisp all around!

Good Golly Miss Molly....HEAVEN! This didn't take but a few minutes and the fires were all gone. I tripled the Sriracha to our liking and I even was adding more ;-) everyone that was here was a total fan. Will make again!!!!! Not enough stars on the rating to tell y'all how we really felt about this recipe.

Ok a Novelty Dish but I made it.  I would NOT overcook this,.  We dropped this at the Bar for 6 Minutes.  Next time will cut to 4. We will do this again. Perhaps use a flavored SPAM for more zing.  Made the dipping sauce exactly as recipe calls for.  I think next time I will use more Sriracha and maybe  some cayenne.  Just lookin for more heat.

I was delighted to see the Spam Fries when we pulled them from the fryer.  Did not fall apart. Looked just like French Fries.  Lookin forward to next time.   Thanks for post!

Delicious even though it will probably clog my arteries! Substituted tabasco for siracha since thatâ€™s what I had

I was sort of afraid of this...  But intrigued enough to try it.  It was actually pretty good.  Just serve with a salad or something as it does get heavy.  I will make this again for sure.  (My boyfriend would have given this a 5.)

An amazing appetizer, small lunch, and/or snack. Even my husband and 2 year old loves this. Which is saying something.
