Wonderful recipe. Grilled the tenderloin instead of baked. The presentation was beautiful and the taste was out of this world. My daughter said it looked like it should have been on the cover of a culinary magazine. I will definitely make this again.

Outstanding! Followed the directions pretty closely, other than doubling down on the pepper flakes. After 24 hours of marinating in the chimichurra sauce, it was moist, tender and delicious,

This was SOOOO good!!! The only change I made was to cook it in the slow cooker instead of in the oven.  It was incredibly tender and flavorful.  I will definitely make this again!

I have a different method for cooking pork loin but this chimichurri is delicious!! I loved it. I ended up using leftover chimichurri for seasoning roasted vegetables. It would be wonderful on chicken. Itâ€™s also very versatile - I can see adding fresh mint to make it Mediterranean or switching out the parsley for cilantro for Mexican.
