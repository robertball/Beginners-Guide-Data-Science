Well just put less wine into this, but enough to not make a big difference in the overall stew.

Mmmm, but if you do like white wine, give it a try.  Yummy!

If you don't drink wine DO NOT make this recipe. The flavor of the wine is over powering.

This is great. DO NOT put in a whole bottle of wine. One cup is all you need.

i was excited when i found this recipe i was very excited because my granparents live in reno and the seafood stew at the nuggets oyster bar is amazing! i knew right away that i wasnt planning on adding as much wine as the recipe calls for, im prego right now and dont mind cooking with a little but a whole bottle seemed a bit much. i was also a bit wary of adding as much cocktail sauce as it calls for and wish i would have substituted with something else. while it did need something more for flavor, it wasnt cocktail sauce that should have been added because as soon as it mixed in the cream separated :( other than that i am fairly happy with how it turned out even with using canned seafood. i will be trying again but with a few changes.
