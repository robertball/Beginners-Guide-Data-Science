I made this recipe for a dinner with my in-laws. Everyone loved it! I made a couple small changes. I didnt have dry mustard so I added mustard seed. I also used chili powder instead of tobasco. I will definitely use this recipe again!

This is an absolutely splendid recipe! I can't really see the purpose of the flour so I may leave it off next time as an experiment but there will definitely be a "next time." I did a double take on the quantities of some of the ingredients like vinegar Worchestershire Sauce and paprika but I made it "as is" and it was fabulous.
