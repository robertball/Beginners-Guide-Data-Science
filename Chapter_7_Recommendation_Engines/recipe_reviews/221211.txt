I didnâ€™t even bother with the topping, which seemed too rich and heavy for the already rich macaroni and cheese underneath it.  I simply used some crushed bakery croutons (I did bake the ramekins at 350 degrees, about 15 minutes, till bubbly and the topping golden).

I don't this can get any better!  It was wonderful and the use of white cheese potato chips is brilliant!  Thank you Chef John.

I used this topping for restaurant style mac and cheese recipe.  I used regular kettle style chips and Italian flavored bread crumbs (that was all that I had) and I also used fine shredded mozzarella & Parmesan cheese and I also used salted butter.  This topping was so good!  I will definitely make this topping again.

The problem of not enough pasta in too much cheese sauce:  If you watch the video (which is always a good idea), you will note that Chef John states that the recipe given for the cheese sauce is enough for one pound of pasta, but he is making only two servings.  He also states that for the two servings, you add just enough of the cheese sauce to incorporate one cup of cooked pasta and save the remainder of the sauce for another time. I made the recipe using regular chips but otherwise followed the topping recipe as written. Everyone enjoyed it very much and declared the recipe a "keeper".  Won't make it often because of the high caloric count, but it's a great "treat" recipe.

We weren't fond of the chip topping.  I used sharp cheddar kettle chips.  The macaroni itself was very good, but the whole process was pretty labor intensive.  It's still just macaroni and cheese.  If I bothered to make it again I would just use a regular crumb topping.

I did not care for this recipe - it was too heavy. Will not make this again.

It's a very good recipe. It's hard to find the white cheddar potato chips, but using regular chips makes a delicious and crispy topping that we could not stop eating! Definitely a winner for how creamy it is too.

Very nice contrasting texture to go with the Mac.  I use this for more of my gourmet mac n cheese versions with the higher end cheeses.

I had to make a few adjustments due to what I had on hand. I used regular kettle chips as I did not have white cheddar flavored. Instead of gruyere, I used shredded swiss. I did add a good amount of chopped ham leftover from Christmas dinner. The kids loved it, especially the topping. Husband and I thought the topping was a little odd. I'd try this again without the topping.

Are you kidding?  Chef John, I love your recipes and videos but If your fans eat this very often they won't be living very long.

This recipe was very good but the amount of macaroni, 1 cup uncooked, the recipe calls for must be wrong.  With all the white sauce and cheese you have to use more than 1 cup. Maybe it should be 1 pound uncooked elbow macaroni?!?
