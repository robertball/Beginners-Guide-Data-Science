Good recipe.  I used orange juice instead of rice wine.  And omitted the peppers because the family doesn't like hot, still delicious

Yum, I didn't have all the right ingredients, but my substitutes worked well. I used canola oil for frying. 1 Tbs red wine and extra rice vinegar for the rice wine, brown sugar for the white, for the banana ketchup (banana processed like tomato ketchup) 1tsp banana (put through garlic press) and 1 tsp tomato ketchup, 1 Tbs red pepper flakes instead of dried chillies, 2 tsp orange juice concentrate for the zest. 

Does not turn out restaurant quality, but is still very yummy.

A hint, try to fry the chicken while mixing up the other ingredients, otherwise it takes way longer than the stated "Ready In" time.

It was OK, but I'd rather have the breading on it to really be like restaurant food. Too much onions (our family doesn't like it) and banana ketchup was strange. Too many chilies! I am ok with sorta spicy stuff but it was too much. It wasn't too bad, but not too good. thanks for the attempt, though. overall, it was ok but not a favorite.

P.S. This sort of food if you go to china 30 yrs ago they'd be like "what in the world is that stuff?" not real chinese food, Americanized.

This was a great recipe! I used chicken breast instead of chicken thigh for a healthier alternative and the meat was more tender than the  restaurant version. I also added ginger to taste( and smell) to the sauce. My dad, who loves chinese food( take out), LOVED this.

Not too bad! I rather enjoyed this recipe...thanks for submitting it! I did change up a few veggies to use what I had on hand. But I finally found something I could use that bottle of banana ketchup I've had rattling around in my cupboard in...that's pretty awesome in my book.

loved it! Very similar to my favorite restaurant.  Next time I will remove the seeds from the chili pepper because mine were too dry & they wouldn't soften without cutting into smaller pieces.

While my family did eat it, I was not at all impressed.I made this recipe right to the letter and it almost wasn't enough for my family of four. It made a really small amount. Thank goodness I made rice to go with it lol. It tasted nothing like the many restaurant versions I've had. I'm gonna try the misspelled General Tsao's II on this site and give this meal another shot.

Excellent orange flavor just from the zest.  Easy to make. Added broccoli and tomatoes and sweet peppers.   Cornstarch batter is fantastic alternative for gf diet, when wanting Breaded Asian entree.

I followed the instructions step by step and it was great. "Far" better the what I am used to at the chinese restaurant. I made  again but substituted the chicken with cauliflower. It tastes great!

Only two stars if the nutrition facts are correct. Otherwise it is very tasty and would get more stars. But one serving for 2475 cal and 243 g of fat just cannot be correct!

Tried this recipe as written except that I used crushed red pepper instead of the red chilis.   recipe was good but the orange zest actually ruined the taste.  My family tried it but everyone suggested I leave the orange zest out next time.
