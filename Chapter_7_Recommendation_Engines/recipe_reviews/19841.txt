These were very nice for a change- and a good way to spruce up canned green beans.  However I would recommened cooking the onions and garlic for 3-4 minutes before adding the almonds.  Then cook the almonds for 1/2 minutes before adding the greenbeans!

I loved the flavors and added more garlic. I think fresh green beans would be better though. The canned green beans tend to get mushed.

My family loved these green beans.  My niece said these were the best green beans she'd ever eaten.  Refrigerating them overnight and heating them up the next day really heightened the flavor.  I'll definitely make them again.

Glenda, these are wonderful. My family detests most canned veggies, so I used frozen (against your better judgement) This side dish was awesome with frozen beans.I will be making these alot this summer when I have fresh ones from my garden!I bet it will be super delicious! Thanks for sharing.

This is a great recipe.  I substituted frozen French cut green beans instead of using canned.  I made this dish for Thanksgiving, and it was a big hit!  I will definitely make this again.

I'm always looking for recipes that are low in saturated fat.  This one is great because is uses oil instead of butter, and tastes great.

This was an easy recipe.  We cooked this ahead of time and then reheated on our camp stove as suggested.  It was a little bland.  I think it could use some spices or something.  I even doubled up on the garlic but it still was bland.  Also, if I were to do it again I'd toast the almonds first.  But, I probably would make this again if I went camping with some slight alterations because it was very easy.

These were excellent! Made them earlier in day, and just microwaved them for about a minute before serving, sprinkled with herb seasonings, too. Top notch flavour, easy, and can be prepared well in advance for quick serving at dinner. My kind of recipe!

These were very easy to make.  I used frozen reg. grn beans and had precooked them in the microwave first for about 5 mins. and then used the skillet and they were awesome. Came out very tender and the flavor is wonderful with the garlic and lovethe texture with the almonds. Very Easy to warm at campsite.

Easy to make recipe although amount of garlic recommended is extremely high.  Use less garlic to enhance the taste of the beans.  Overall, though, an excellent bean variation.

My husband loves these green beans.  And despite the recommendation to not use frozen green beans. I did!  And it worked great.  I would try it with fresh as well.  I also add a bit more garlic as we love garlic.  We don't camp much, but did make it for dinner as a side dish twice now, and it was enjoyed by all.

These were a major hit!  Next time I would use only 1 tbsp of oil, but other than that they were awesome!  I am eating the left overs for lunch right now!

This dish is so easy to make.  There are food allergies in my family, and green beans are the vegetable I serve most, so I am always looking for new ways to serve them.  This is a winner.  It's easy, it's good, it's different.

I was looking for a recipe using my fresh French green beans. I came upon this one using canned beans, but decided to try it anyways. It turned out to be quite tasty. The cook time was a bit longer, but worth it!

VERY GOOD! I didn't prepare them over a camp fire, I just cooked them the way the recipe states. Very good with a little bit of soy sauce! Will be a staple at our house!

This recipe is easy, that is why I gave it 4 stars. I added some white wine to give it more flavor, but that didn't really help. I had to use what I thought was a lot of salt and pepper. Then it was pretty good. Very healthy!

These were a very nice change. I followed KJTries suggestion and sauteed the onions (I added a shallot) and garlic before adding the almonds (which I toasted lightly). I didn't take these to a campfire, but they were great with our dinner! Thanks for sharing, Glenda!

Great way to make a can of greenbeans more exciting.  I really liked the almonds.  It gave it more texture with the crunchiness.

Excellent! Quick & immpressive.  I added two strips of cooked, crumbled bacon to the original recipe.  I used canned, kitchen-cut green beans (1 inch lengths) rather than french cut because that's what was in the pantry.  Very, very good...not just for camping either!  I WILL be keeping a copy of this recipe at home AND in the camper!

Really easy and quite tasty.  Good to make ahead for large gatherings.  Nice alternative to the traditional green bean casseroles at the holidays.  I make it the night before the gathering and put it in the fridge so the flavors blend, then just heat on the stove or in the microwave the next day.  No need for a campfire!

Only made it once,( but opted for fresh green beans) for an event - about 30 people.  Simply Sautéed the onions, garlic, and almonds, and added the green beans, and cooking in pan until they turned bright green - covered and cooled.  When I arrived at the event, put in oven to warm (40 minutes).  Everyone loved them - first item to disappear, which is really unusual for a vegetable!

Thank you for this lovely recipe. Thoroughly enjoyed these beans. I used fresh green beans and steamed them for about 8 minutes before I put them in with the almonds, onion and garlic for 3 minutes. I've made them several times in the last week already!

This recipes is WONDERFUL.  I've made it too many times to count.  The only thing I change is that I double the recipe b/c we can't get enough.  I'm eating it leftover cold as I type this.

These were good and great for a different idea to serve green beans.

My family never seems to like the nutty flavors whenever I add any to our vegetables. This was ok for me.

I made these the day before we left for our camping trip and vacuum sealed them. Dropped the bag into some warm water for a bit and had them with our camp supper, very good. I made them just a few nights ago with our "dinner at home" meal also. Very good with fresh green beans steamed tender, then used in this recipe! THANKS!

This recipe is awesome.  I make it just about every week.  I don't think I even ate green beans before this.  The almonds make it seem fancy but it's really budget friendly.

I seldom make snap beans, as I don't care for the texture.  These, though, were very superior!

I used canned beans and was very happy with the results.  Definite family pleaser.

Thanks for this easy recipe! I'm not an outdoors person so I can't comment on how these would taste over a campfire but they made a great indoor side dish for me. I used canned beans as suggested but I think I will try frozen ones next time because I like green beans crispier. Even with canned though, this was delicious!

Not sure why people got so enthused about this recipe ... tasted like canned green beans with almonds.  Not sure what I expected, but kind of disappointing.  Might be OK for camping fare, but wasn't worth serving as an extra vegetable with my Christmas ham!

Very nice recipe.   I used fresh green beans and they were delicious for dinner at home, but I am unsure of how well they would travel if you were to take them camping.  As others noted, I would use a bit less olive oil than originally suggested.

Delicious green bean mixture! Although I didn't heat them up over a campfire, I did make them and served them hot, right from the stove.  A great tasting side dish that the kids just love.

This is really good. I used frozen green beans that I thawed in warm water. I didn't miss the "can" flavor of the other! My family really liked this; I will make it again.

These were really good. I liked the almonds and onions. Next time I might try this with fresh green beans as the canned aren't always the best.
