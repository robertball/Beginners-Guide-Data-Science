Absolutely wonderful sauce.  It took little time  and effort to produce this flavorful dish.  I had to add a little extra flour to thicken it up and also added tons of pepper to give it an extra bite.  Truly a keeper.

I tried this with sirloin steak.  It was delicious!  I used 1 can of Campbell's Beef Consomme instead of beef broth.  Also used white mushrooms.  Instead of mixing the remaining butter w/flour to thicken it, I forgot and added a bit of water with corn starch by accident.  Was a bit too watery but very delicious.  Will use this recipe again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this a few times now, it's also a great way to heat up leftover beef, i just cut up the cooked beef
and let it all simmer together. thanks for the recipe. :)

I cooked this as a Sunday dinner, everybody loved it. I used sirloin steaks, baby portobella mushrooms instead of shiitake, and a cup of water with beef buillon cubes instead of broth. Delicious!

My husband liked this more than I did but it was still enjoyable. We didn't use broccoli but instead served with grilled asparagus. I did have to add more broth and wine to thin the sauce because it thickened up so much after adding the flour. Also, used regular white mushrooms.
