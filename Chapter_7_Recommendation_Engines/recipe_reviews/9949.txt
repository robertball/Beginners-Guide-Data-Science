After reading through 25 reviews it was interesting to learn that those who didn't like this cookie ended up with a different cookie than I did!  Considering some of those reviews, let's start with what these cookies, at least the cookies I made, are not.  They're not crumbly, cakey, puffy or fluffy.  Nor are they flaky, oily or moist.  They're not shortbread.  And they certainly don't fall apart.  I'm no scientist, so I don't know the reason WHY this happens, but I do know that when I see a cookie recipe that calls for oil and cream of tartar the cookie is going to be light as a feather, airy, tender and somewhat sandy in texture.  I love that kind of cookie and that's exactly how these turned out.  If you're looking for the more familiar, chewy chocolate chip cookie, this is not it.  It's different, like comparing apples and oranges, but every bit as delicious, if not better than a lot of them!  Did I do something different than other reviewers whose experience was different than mine?  I used a medium-sized cookie scoop, flattened the cookies just slightly and baked just until they started to get golden around the edges.  These cookies, dotted with Valentine's Day M&M's, will be making their way to Minneapolis tomorrow to be given to two grown "kids."  I'll be starting out with 36 good sized cookies.  It will be interesting to see how many of these are left to give them after the 6-hour drive!

I really hate having to put down someone elses recipe... but I find the reviews so helpful.  The first problem I came across was that the dough was so thick, my mixer could barely get through it.  It also didnt seem to want to stick.  I could not do spoonfuls because the dough just crumbled.  They puffed up so much that the inside was cakey, and the outside too crispy.  I prefer regular chocolate chip cookies...

AMAZING! Wonderful texture--it is a lot like the consistency of shortbread. Very rich. My husband still prefers traditional chocolate chip cookies, but enjoyed these, too. They are the best soon after taking them out of the oven. I would make only what you plan on consuming that night, then refrigerate or freeze the rest of the dough. If there are leftovers, microwave if possible. They're still good the next day, just not as "to-die-for" in my opinion. 
I also tried cooking them in a 375 oven for 8-10 minutes, and I thought it worked better. They were slightly golden brown and crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. Maybe it was just my oven, but 350 dried them out a bit by the time the tops started to turn golden.

Look no further, this is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe on AR and is without a doubt worthy of 5-stars! For 10 years I've been trying to duplicate the chocolate chip cookies that were sold in a bakery nearby. That search has finally ended! Normally I favor chewy cookies of any variety, but this is different and oh so delicious. It's a slightly soft, slightly crumbly, thick textured cookie. I followed the recipe exactly as stated except for using half of the chocolate chips (personal preference). I did find that I needed to cook them a bit longer than 10 minutes, but my spoonfuls were rather heaping. Allow to sit on sheet for 2-3 minutes before moving to wire racks as they are fragile when hot. From now on this will be the only chocolate chip cookie recipe I will use. Simply fabulous!

The is THEEEEE most delicious cookie ever. I did not have the shorting and vegtable oil so I substituted it with Pure Coconut oil for the shorting and walnut oil for the vegtable oil. My oh my, it reminded me of the cookies at Trader Joes and it has a coconutty taste. Please try it with those two ingredience. You will not go wrong.

Sorry but this recipe was lacking.  I am a chocolate chip cookie lover and I am trying to find that perfect recipe.  The cookies were OK, but the shortening made the cookies somewhat greasy and not as flavorful. The recipes that use butter are usually better for you and have a better richer flavor.  Cream of Tarter was a nice touch, i would try it in my own chocolate chip recipe.

This cookie is amazing.  I don't have a great oven and it still came out fluffy!  Just follow the directions exactly (really pull them out at 8 minutes - I left one tray in for 10 and the bottoms burned) and you will have delicious fluffy cookies.  I got really nice compliments on them.  People said they tasted professionally done!  You feel guilty eating them because they are so decadent.

Thank you for this recipe!!!  I do home child care and this was a perfect recipe to have my "kids" help me make.  They loved cooking and it was so quick and easy. I did cook them a little longer than the recipe called for and I did leave them cool on the cookie tray a few minutes before moving them to a cooling rack. Everyone loved them. I dropped them by spoonfuls on the cookie sheet with my small Pampered Chef scooper and all the cookies were perfectly shaped and I actually got 36 out of this recipe!!  This will be a keeper here!!

These cookies are SO GOOD!  They are different, because of the vegetable oil and cream of tartar.  They are a little crispy on the outside, but still soft--well, mine were anyway!  I love chocolate chip cookies, but am tired of the basic recipes, so this one is definitely a keeper!

I tried this recipe because I was out of butter.  But both my hubby and I decided it is our all time favorite cookie.  These are very chewy if they are just a little undercooked, and they are crisp and crunchy is browned.  FYI, I used Extra Virgin Olive Oil.

There seems to be two camps for this cookie, those who like the crumbly texture and those who don't. Unfortunately I am in the latter category, these tasted too oily and overall I did not like the texture.  I did not have any problems mixing the dough in an electric mixer (as another reviewer mentioned), and I did use 1/2 less cup chocolate chips just because that's my personal preference.

I have been searching for this particular recipe for a while now!  I saw it in someone's cookbook, tried it, but forgot to copy it in writing.  I searched off and on for about a year and a half and was ready to give up!  I'm ecstatic because it's my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe, too!

This cookie was excellent, loved it.  I had to make a treat for my mom's 50th birthday and decided to give it a whirl, it made tons of cookies and everybody loves it. My husband and me both love it as well.

Loved the flavor.  I had to cook them longer than called for.  They wanted to fall apart when removing from pan; however after cooling a few minutes they came right off.

Oh my goodness...these cookies are my new favorite!  I have a son with dairy/soy allergies and am always looking for GOOD cookie recipes without butter, margarine, or milk, and this recipe tops the list!  When I used his allergy-free chocolate and followed the directions exactly, these cookies turned out spot-on fantastic...light, fluffy, a tiny bit crisp on the outside, and gooey in the middle.  Kudos for an awesome recipe - I have already added to my recipe box and will definitely recommend this one to friends!

Very Good!  I've been trying to find a cookie that was moist, yet crisp, and these are the ones.  Plus, they cool very quickly, which is nice because I only have two cooling racks.  Not you typical chocolate chip cookie texture; they reminded me more of a short bread type of textrua.  Yummy!

This is not a classic chocolate chip cookie.  The texture is flakier, more like a sugar cookie, probably because of the cream of tartar.  Though a good cookie, it was not what I was looking for.  I wanted one that is chewier, softer.  Definitely different, if that's what you're looking for.

These are not your average chocolate chip cookies; the texture is light and tender, almost like old-fashioned pecan sandies, if you remember those. I used almost three cups of dark chocolate chips and tasted one still warm out of the oven and wasn't that crazy about it. When they cooled, however, I loved the texture and flavor, and would make these again.

I have been looking for a chocolate chip recipe that would be similar to  snicker doodles that had cream of tarter.  I had one many years ago and it seems similar to this one.  The cookie dough would kinda bubble up then flatten out, believe this is due to the cream of tarter and baking soda.  They were melt in your mouth semi crisp delicious cookies.  I think I'll try these based on some of the reviews.

This recipe was delicious! The cookies turned out light and soft, with a little crisp to the outside. A great recipe for someone wanting something more than the traditional CC cookie recipe. These need to be baked for 11-12 minutes.

This is a  good cookie! Not too sweet, I used white and semi sweet chips, with walnuts. I cut the recipe in half, and used half the cream of tarter, and salt, but Lord help me this was a good cookie. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

The cookies were all right.  They did need to be baked longer.  A little too flakey for my liking.  Definately not the best I've ever had.

Needed a little longer cooking time than stated and could have used more than one 12 ounce package of chocolate chips.  Had some cookies with large voids with the ammount I used.  I gave it 5 stars because the flavor was good and would make them again - but with more chocolate or maybe some nuts added to keep the cookie full.

These bake up beautifully! If your looking for a traditional chocolate chip cookie recipe then  this one is not for you! Not to say they are not DELICIOUS! But just not your average chocolate chip cookie but thats why i like them so much lol They are really good! They are crispy/flaky chewy all in one! I like them alot! They are addicting im eating my third cookie as I type this!

I love these chocolate chip cookies. I used Crisco Butter Flavored Baking Sticks for shortening.

Absolutely best chocolate chip cookie I've made. My oven temperature is possibly lower. Baked 15 minutes at 350. Other than that it's fabulous!

This recipe is the BEST!!!  I just made some and my husband and I just LOVE it!!!  I made them without chocolate chips (didn't have any and I really wanted cookies!) and they are excellent even without them!  I cooked mine for 11 minutes, and they were perfect!  Thanks!!!
