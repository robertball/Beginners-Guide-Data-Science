Absolutely delicious and turns out great everytime! I made without the corn because I didn't have any, but don't make any substitutions or leave out anything else, the flavors just blend to make a wonderful soup/stew. I also simmer my soup longer than the recipe calls for. Since the macaroni tends to get too mushy if you have lots of leftovers,or have to keep it simmering for awhile. I cook and drain the pasta and just add a little to each bowl as I serve it. Then refrigerate the leftover pasta and soup in seperate containers. This is so great and different from stew or chili. I made it when I had out of town guests flying in and wasn't sure when they would arrive. They got to our home and were so happy to be met with the delightful smell and be served this satisfying and hearty soup with french bread and a fresh fruit salad after a long and hungry flight!

This soup is very good.  If you want this soup to taste like the Italian soup served at the Olive Garden, try these changes - Supplement the water for two 12 oz. boxes of beef stock, and add three boullion cubes.

My dear grandma, a few years ago, made her way onto the internet for the first time looking for a new recipe to make our family a nice dinner.  She found this recipe and it quickly became a family favorite.  She made it quite a bit.  My grandma passed away 2 years ago.  This recipe is a fond reminder to me of being in the kitchen with my grandma.  It will be in our family for many years not only as a wonderful soup recipe, but as a great reminder of our wonderful Coral.

Excellent flavor...I used fresh spinach instead of cabbage, ground turkey instead of beef. As suggested by another reviewer, I added some V-8 juice (two cans) and additional water. If you can make this ahead of time, it really improves its flavor after simmering for a few hours.  Healthy!

Excellent!!!!  After reading the reviews I added an additional 4 cups of water and a can of beef bouillon,  instead of macaroni I cut up 2 red potatoes, and added a sweet sausage with the chop meat.  Next time I will do a link of hot sausage for a little more zing.  Made this last nite, since we have been in single digit temps, and it hit the spot with a loaf of warm baguette bread. Thanks Jackie for a great soup.

This was pretty good with some doctoring.  I had to add about 4 cups of water and a can of beef broth to make it more like a soup.  Then I added more of the listed seasonings and several tablespoons of garlic salt.  Maybe it would have come together on its own without the garlic, but it just seemed verd bland initially.

I was never to fond of vegetable soups because they never seemed to have enough substance...just watery and veggies...UNTIL NOW!! This is the Best Vegetable Soup I have ever had!! I didn't use the kidney or green beans and I had to add a lot of water throughout the cooking process but the result was great!! Thank you Jackie, for providing me a recipe that changed my mind about vegetable soups!!

Thank you for posting this recipe! It is a cold night here in Pennsylvania and I was looking for a hearty soup recipe to warm me up. Your soup was it. This soup was sooo good!
My family enjoyed it. A definite keeper! I did take the advice of previous postings and added 3 extra cups of water. Because of the extra water I decided to add more beef bouillon and increase the oregano and basil to a little over 1 tbsp. each. I used Italian Stewed tomatoes instead of the diced tomatoes, 2 cups of frozen vegetables (corn, peas and green beans) instead of the can veggies, and I skipped the cabbage altogether. I also took the advice of cooking the macaroni separately and adding them to the bowl just before serving.  Very filling and oh so good :)

I've made this recipe many times, sometimes exactly as written and sometimes with modifications. It's very good either way, but if you replace the hamburger with pot roast it is truly exceptional. I put the roast in a slow cooker with onion soup mix, 4 cups of water, and 2 tsp of bouillon and use the broth for the soup.

This was hearty & nutritious.  I used 4 Herbox low sodium beef packets (which is what I had in the house).  It did need more salt.  I used one can of light colored kidney beans & one dark colored one.  I measured 2 cups of chopped cabbage from a coleslaw package.  I added 2 cups water when I added the cabbage, corn, etc.  If you don't add water, it's a thick stew, instead of a hearty soup.  My husband isn't wild about the taste of canned green beans so I may add frozen ones if I make this again.  I also used whole wheat pasta (which I cooked separately) to make it healthier.  I served the pasta in a separate bowl, to be added to the soup at the table, as I'd read that cooking/simmering pasta in the soup could make the pasta too mushy.  Finally, when serving, I added some grated parmesan to my soup while my husband had his plain.  I'm bringing some soup to work for lunch tomorrow.

Wow!  This soup is WONDERFUL!  I was a little leary of using ground beef and so many canned vegetables, but the taste was spectacular!  Even my picky, non-enthusiastic husband raved.

The recipe didn't state whether to drain the corn and green beans, so I didn't, because I wanted it to be a little more soupy.  I also simmered it with a lid on to keep in the moisture and was glad I did.  Otherwise it would have been more of a thick stew.  While preparing it, I had a hard time waiting for the vegetables to cook because it smelled and tasted SO GOOD, so I ended up having a bowl with some slightly crunchy veggies!  Next time I might wait longer before adding the corn and beans, because the celery and carrots took longer to cook than I anticipated and I worried the beans may get too soggy.  

Fabulous recipe, I highly recommend it!

Made this today, except subbed ground bison for the beef (barely any fat!) and I doubled all ingredients. I don't understand how anyone said it was bland! I put in the exact amount of spices & it is very hearty! Maybe the bison added a better flavor?

Made this evening and we really enjoyed it.  Not only good tasting but a good for ya meal!  I did not change anything 'cept to add a bit of cracked black pepper.  One suggestion would be to throw the macaroni in closer to serving time as it got mushy.  Don't let all the ingredients scare you off from making it.  I had everything on hand 'cept the cabbage and I was going to the store anyway so was no problem to get.  Prep work could be done earlier or possibly in the morning or night before for working gals.  This is a definite keeper!

I loved this soup.  I even froze some in individual containers to take to work.  It does require more liquid - I ened up using about 6 cups of water and extra bouillon.  I didnt have carrots so I used some green pepper.  Also, used fresh tomato and green beans.  I dont like kidney beans so I used pinto beans.  I will definately be making this regularly.

Wow - this soup is sooo good! I've never been much of a soup person, but this recipe has got me wanting to make them more often. It's very filling and I feel good about eating it because it's so healthy.

I did make some slight modifications. I used 3 cloves of garlic instead of 2; Replaced beef bouillion and water with 4 cups of prepared beef broth; drained the corn and beans; and omitted the pasta. I followed the rest according to instructions.

I served the soup over brown rice which was super tasty! I didn't want to include the pasta because I'm planning on eating this throughout the week and didn't want the pasta to get mushy.

This soup taste great but "kicked it up a notch" as Emeril would say by adding tsp red pepper flakes, louisiana hot sauce (depends on how warm you like it) , and italian seasoning.

I used all canned tomato and no tomato sauce.  I also omitted the macaroni and added salt and sugar to taste.  Hubby who normally hates this kind of hodgepodge soup had two servings and said it was good.  Very hearty.

I made this recipe and thought it was excellent. I only gave it 4 stars though because I did have to double up on the spicing - once this was done it was fantastic. I also had to add more water; otherwise it was more of a stew with very little liquid (it does say to add more water if necessary but I can't see how you could not!)! It was pretty quick to prepare because I didn't have to make little meatballs. Also, I am trying to feed my family a little less meat and I used 3/4 pound of ground beef. You could get away with 1/2 a pound and definitely use ground chicken or turkey instead. My teenage boys loved it and even had it for breakfast - low fat (make sure you use extra lean meat), high protein and lots of veggies. Just what we're supposed to eat.

I first discovered this recipe a couple of months ago and have already made it about a half dozen times!  It is most definitely a keeper!  I agree with all of the other reviews that you need to add more liquid, especially if you like it a bit more "soupy" -- it makes an incredible amount; there is always enough for several meals worth, as well as giving some to neighbors and even freezing some!  One note, though, the macaroni does easily get a little on the mushy side; so I usually add it late if I'm going to be reheating this for later serving.  I have already had a number of requests for this recipe - thanks, Jackie!

This was a great blend, and seemed heathy.  I didn't feel like measuring the vegetables, and just tossed stuff in till it seemed right. Somehow I forgot the macaroni (I know, right?).  It was still a huge success, and we really enjoyed eating it.  Plenty of left overs for the next day.  We'll definitely make it again.

I made this last week and it is absolutely delicious. I added some extra vegetables which needed to be used. The only thing I did differently was to cook off a piece of beef which gave me a good stock, so I eliminated the water and bouillon granules. Aso, as others suggested, I cooked the pasta and then added it to the bowls before serving. Loved the taste of the Italian herbs. I will definitely make this again. I recommend cooking this slowly so the herb flavorings have a chance to penetrate the broth.

I've renamed this "Veggie Bomb" in my house!  Very happy with this!  I'm pregnant and having trouble eating enough vegetables every day.  This is a PERFECT way to get them all in.  Thank you for posting!

I am OBSESSED with this soup. I make it at least once every other week, and we always have some individual servings in the freezer for lunches. The only changes I make are: I use a potato (or 2, depending on size) instead of the pasta; I eliminate the meat to make it vegetarian; I use vegetable bouillon instead of the beef granules; I use fresh green beans and tomatoes when possible; and I triple (at least) the amount of water that's called for. This soup is amazing, though--hearty, nutritious, and delicious! It's fantastic served with the Buttery Corn Bread (recipe from this site).

I love all the vegetables in this soup but I did add more water (about 7 cups)
and for every cup of water I added one boullion cube.  It does make alot but
I froze enough for another meal and took some to work for lunch.

This was very filling and easy to make.  Like the other reviews, I added water (all total, 5 cups) and I omitted the cabbage due to personal preference.  It had a good flavor, and my husband loved it.

This soup was perfect on a December day in Minnesota with a temperature outside of -5. I followed the recipe, but added a cup more of water. I also cooked the pasta separately.  All of the family felt it's a keeper of a recipe - thank you Jackie!

This was very good!  I used beef broth instead of the bouillon, but ended up using both because it needed to be thinned some so I added about 2 cups of water and 2 teaspoons of bouillon.  I also used the chopped beef from Wal-mart instead of hamburger.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Everyone thought it was really good.  I didn't even add any salt or pepper.  It had a great taste and was very filling on a chilly night!

I just tried this soup.  It's one of the best soups I have ever tasted.  It was fairly easy to make and it is very filling.  I did do a couple of things different tho.  I cut up a large potato into small chunks and I added more spice to taste.  Also put in a dash of red pepper.  And took the advice of one of the other reviewers.  I used small shell pasta but left if out and added it to the bowl when serving.  Very yummy with garlic bread.

This recipe is DELICIOUS. I recommend boiling the noodles separately and adding them to the boils because otherwise, the noodles will get soggy when you have leftovers. The soup is also good without the noodles with some crackers (:

I made this recipe just as the author submitted it, except I had to use lots more liquid. About 3-4 cups more than listed in the recipe. My family loved it and my college age daughter asked for the recipe so that she can make it at school. Great basic recipe that will be fun to experiment with.

This is a wonderful tasting soup, but it needs a lot more liquid. I left out the pasta and still ended up using 3 times the water. I also replaced the canned corn and beans with frozen. The end result was great. Tastes even better as leftovers.

Skipped the beef, corn and green beans.   Added yellow squash.  We had pasta last night so I used barley instead. Used one kidney and one garbanzo and 3 fresh large tomatoes instead of canned.  Def more liquid. Put everything in the pot yesterday, brought it to a boil, put the lid on and turned off the heat.  Let it cool a bit then put it away.  Heated it up tonight and it was perfect, veggies still had a crisp to them.  Served with Jo's Rosemary Bread made into breadsticks.

I probably shouldn't rate this recipe because I changed it so much.  I didn't add any of the seasonings.  Instead I used 5 links of Italian sausage that I removed the casings from, two I mashed and  browned with the one pound of hamburger and the other three I cut into chunks and added to the soup.  I used two cans of beef broth instead of the bouillion cubes.  Didn't add any water either.  I added two small cubed potatoes instead of the macaroni.  I also drained the juice from the corn and green beans (the recipe didn't state what to do with the juice).  I also only used one can of kidney beans.  With the italian sausage added, the soup had WONDERFUL FLAVOR!  If you like more broth, than add another can of beef broth.  I let the soup simmer for a good three hours, this would be a good soup recipe for the crock-pot too.  If you want a spicer soup, than use hot sausage.  This recipe was a good starting point for the soup that I made!

i make parmesan crisps to go with this AWESOME soup. i added alot more veggies and i did follow other people in using beef stock instead of water and spinach instead of cabbage.
parmesan crisps- 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese on parchment paper- heaping tbsp. of parm. cheese should make 4 or 5 heaps. put in oven at 450 for a couple minutes until golden brown. they have such nice presentation stuck into the soup.

I took a chance on this one.  Made for the first time at a friend's house for dinner... it turned out fabulous!!!  We added a few extra veggies, more water and extra basil, parsley and oregano.  It was soooo good; with a simple lettuce salad.

Even better the 2nd and 3rd day.  I added an extra can of tomatoes, tomato sauce, bouillion, and water to make it more soupy.  I also added lots of black pepper and a bit more salt.  Very good with cornbread!  My kids hated it of course but all the grownups went back for 2nds.

I used chicken broth and left out the bullion because it has MSG which is not good for ones health.  I did not add the noodles since they are empty calories.  I might add some Quinoa noodles the next time.  It is delish without the bullion.  Simple is good.

What a great soup!  I did make a couple changes: 1 can of kidney beans, doubled the noodles, fresh green beans, frozen corn, no cabbage and simmered longer (had to add extra water because of that).

This was good!  Like others, I omitted the cabbage, and added leftover rice instead of pasta.  Next time I will use Italian-style diced tomatoes.  Also added salt and pepper and a little hot sauce--and worchestershire.  Topped with parmesan.

Wonderful!  I was a little skeptical as this recipe was so different from my basic vegetable soup recipe.

I did everything by the recipe except omitted the water and added a box + 1 can of low sodium fat free beef brouth. I used a large can of crushed tomatoes instead of a smaller diced.  The second time I didn't have crushed, it was better with crushed.

I also cooked the mac seperately and we all decided we liked it better without the pasta. 2nd time didn't even bother with pasta.

I used frozen corn and frozen Italian cut green beans.

Definately a keeper.

I loved this soup! I made a few changes with the ingredients (I left out the meat and macroni) but left all the seasonings the same because the blend of spices was perfect!  I also used beef broth instead of water!  Thanks for the recipe it is awesome!

Very good soup.  We used cut up round roast and it was very tasty.  We added some worchestire sauce to each bowl and it really helped the flavor.  We also cooked the soup in the Crockpot after browning the meat for about 5 hours.  Would make again!

Everyone I cooked for REALLY enjoyed this soup.  I was quite liberal with the spices, and I used a nice lean sirloin burger.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this one... and this is coming from a picky eater and someone who does not enjoy cooking very often!

I make it similar but I use canned whole tomatoes, quartered onions, whole baby carrots and a beef roast...leave out the garlic and the kidney beans and the tomato sauce and the cabbage...use some beef broth and add a big ole chunk of romano cheese for flavor....when it's done I drain it through the colander and chop the veggies (it takes less time once they are tender and cooked) I then drop them back in the broth along with a box of cooked orzo....man I can taste it now....my Italian father in law keeps the veggies and meat on a platter and serves them as a side to the broth and orzo...add a big slice of buttered Italian crusty bread and you will be in heaven..sorry it's practically a whole different recipe but it is gooood

I loved this recipe, I used ground turkey and potatoes instead of macaroni, I also did not have any cabbage so I did not use that. Oh and we added some frozen mixed veggies in, and it was a great addition, plus turkey stock I had frozen from our turkey at Thanksgiving and no water just the stock, I think that is why it has great flavor we have been eating it for days.

Very good, and with more liquid, very much reminded me of the soup,salad and breadstick lunch at Olive Garden. Even my son, who is not a "soup person" asked for seconds! Had enough to put into meal-size portions in the freezer for use later.

I had to make a few substitutions: ground turkey instead of ground beef, jarred marinara sauce instead of tomato sauce and herbs, veggie broth instead of beef bouillon and water, and white beans instead of kidney beans.  I didn't have any celery but I did add 1-2 cups chopped kale.  This soup can be easily modified and still taste very good.

Very good soup.  I followed the recipe exact except for adding some red pepper flakes to spice it up.  We like things spicey.  We will definitely make this again!  Thanks Jackie!

This was a delicious full soup.  I didn't have any macaroni so I used whole wheat shells instead.  Looking forward to the left overs for lunch and possibly another dinner.

This was the best soup I've ever made!  Didn't have cabbage so I skipped it.  I used frozen green beans, 3 bouillion cubes and 2 cans beef broth.  I also used fresh herbs- needed to use some from my Aerogarden.  I will definitely be making it again!

Awesome!  I hate green beans so I used a can of garbanzo beans instead.  Also took the suggestion of using 3 cups of water and one 16oz can of beef broth to make it more "soupy".  Overall, wonderful flavor and will definitely make again!

I agree with others that this is a good base that you can tweak to your taste.  Also it does need lots more liquid.

This recipe offers a wonderful base with its own ingredients alone, or adding "everything but the kitchen sink".  Very filling and great for freezing .

This was very good. I halved it and used 4 c beef broth. Seemed to be the perfect consistency with that amount of liquid for us. I also added leftover cooked pasta to each bowl so it didn't get mushy for leftovers. Delicious garnished with fresh grated asiago and fresh basil. Served with homemade cheddar onion bread.

This was a good soup. I adapted mine some to lower carbs and suit my own tastes: used turkey sausage instead of beef, left out the corn and pasta, used frozen green beans instead of canned and white beans instead of kidney. I also added a lot more water (3-4 cups, I think, although I didn't measure it) to make it more like a soup. Will make this again.

This 'soup' reminded me of the recipe my mom would make for goulash. It was very good, but the hubby thought it should be soupier. His family never ate things like this. I made it with ground turkey b/c that is what I had on hand. I would like to try it with the homemade HOT Italian Sausage my hubby makes. That sounds good. Will be using this recipe again.

This is very good! Good combination, I added some frozen veggies with the other ingredients too, It DOES require more liquid In the beginning I added 3 cups of water instead of 2, and had to add additional liquid after adding the macaroni, anytime you put pasta in a soup it just sucks up the juice!!! Just be sure to watch it! thanks for a great recipe

I have always loved my mother's vegetable soup recipe but this is a much easier recipe and tastes almost the same! My only change was that I sautéed the mirepoix first in a little olive oil until the onion was translucent then added the garlic for 30 seconds before adding the beef. After draining some of the fat (not much since I used 90% lean), I added the rest of the ingredients in Step 1, opting to use beef broth instead of water and bouillon.  I then let it simmer for about an hour and a half. I added the cabbage and green beans during the last 15 minutes (omitted the corn because of a family food allergy) and cooked the pasta separately (so that I could control the doneness) adding that just before serving. I did not have to adjust any of the seasonings except I did use a little salt and pepper since I used all low-sodium canned ingredients. After reading the other reviews, I agree that you have to use more liquid. I started out with 2-3 cups of broth then ended up adding another 2 ½ cups towards the end. It is more like a stew that a soup but totally delicious and very hearty. This is not a wimpy vegetable soup!

Oh my goodness, SO GOOD! This is definitely going in my family recipe box! I cooked the soup according to instructions, but with these variations: I added 32 oz. of beef stock in addition to the water, used 5 garlic cloves instead of 2, seasoned with fresh ground salt and pepper and 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes (could use more) with the other seasonings, and sliced 1 small zucchini in with the corn and green beans. I also cooked the macaroni on the side, but I think I will omit it next time. My family loved it and it is perfect for the upcoming fall/winter season. YUM!

We love soups all through the year.  I'm going to start this one now for the second time.  I was hesitant at first because I usually bypass a long list of ingredients.  But it has everything in it that we like.  I like a soup with substance and this one certainly has that.  The only changes I made was replacing the cabbage with potatoes and adding 4 cups more water.  This is just personal preference and did nothing to change the delicious taste.  Thanks for this recipe, Jackie.

I have been using this basic recipe for years! Through the years, I discovered we prefer it without the pasta, and I definitely use much more beef boullion, in addition, I sprinkle a little taco seasoning.

Wonderful as is, and very versatile. I was out of corn and ended up cutting up my zucchini instead to pop in at the last moment. I also used red beans instead of kidney beans.

Oh my, how delicious!! I used this recipe as a starting point and adjusted it based on my family's tastes and what was on hand. Used loooooots more garlic. Skipped the carrots and didn't miss them. Added a sliced zucchini, which made it seem more Italian. And used 1 can of cannelini (white) kidney beans and one can red kidney beans. I liked the color variety. Garbanzos would also be good.  Used a can of Italian stewed tomatoes, which I cut up with kitchen shears before I added them, and 1 can of Italian seasoned diced tomatoes which I zapped with the stick blender till just chunky; skipped the tomato sauce. And served with some grated Parmesan. Yum yum yum.

Really good. I did make some changes. i did not use green beans, i used fresh zucchini instead. I also used frozen spinach (half a package) instead of cabbage because that is what I had. I used tomato juice instead of sauce and added twice as much, as well as a lot of extra water. I did not add pasta to soup but scooped into bowls and put soup on top, otherwise pasta absorbs too much of the liquid. Added grated parm on the top. Yum! Will make this again, we all had two bowls!

I made this to take to work today and everyone loved it.  I used chicken breast and chicken bullion; I have coworkers that don't eat beef and I was thinking of doing ground turkey until a coworker requested chicken.  So I used 5 frozen chicken breasts from Costco and 5 bullion cubes.  I cooked up the chicken and all of the veggies for about 10 minutes, then I transferred to my crockpot.  I put the crockpot on high for about 4-5 hours today and popped in spinach and cheese tortellini about a 1/2 hour before we ate.  Makes a ton of soup; my goodness, that's a lot of veggies!  But it's very good and smelled great while cooking away in the crockpot.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipie is a very nice "starting point" for great soup that can be altered easily to preference.  Our changes:  Used canned beef broth instead of water/bullion.  Used more broth than recommended(I even added extra can the second or third day). Added a couple hot Italian sausage links.  Intended to cook macaronni  on side(as suggested), but after a few servings, decided it didn't need the macaronni for our tastes.  Tried the soup after first hour cooking.  Cabbage underdone and overall flavor less than expected.  Microwaved some the next day for lunch with same conclusion.  By now the broth was almost gone/absorbed.  Added can of broth and cooked on med lo for extra 2 to 2.5 hours.  What a difference!  Had I rated this soup on the first day.. maybe 3 stars.  The end result is 5 stars.  Excellent in every way!  My favorite veg/beef soup.  Cabbage tender and perfect. I add a dash of hot sauce to each bowl, but I don't think I would add it to the pot.   Conclusion:  Add/take away to your tastes, but at a minimum, add more broth and cook 3-4 hours if using fresh cabbage.

Made this today so we could have something to 'eat on' throughout the week for lunches. I halved the recipe, and made a few adjustments due to what I had...didn't have kidney beans, so I used garbanzo. Also, used frozen chopped onion (which cuts down on the 'tearing factor'). Fresh ground beef was so expensive when I went to buy some for this, so I used 2 frozen hamburger patties (Bubba Burger brand, each patty is 1/4 lb.), which was easy enough. Great recipe, keeping in Tupperware in the fridge - reheating as needed.

This soup was fabulous with some slight modifications. I used ground turkey (to reduce fat content, omitted the beans and doubled the water/beef boulion. Absolutely a super soup. I will be making this again soon! Yum!

This had a good flavor but was way too thick. We like our soups a little more "juicy". I tried adding more water but it was loosing it's flavor and my 6qt pot was full to the brim. Would make again but some how get more liquid in it. Thanks

I'm working a lot of double shifts at work so this soup was definitely a keeper!  Tastes so much better over the next few days!  It does make a lot of soup and I found myself having to add more beef broth and water.  Also, I didn't think 20 minutes was long enough to cook the soup properly.  My soup cooked for about two hours on the stove on really low.  Excellent taste!

This is a great recipe.  The only change I made was to use a quart of beef broth instead of water and bouillon cubes and to add a half a cup of barley instead of pasta.

With a few adjustments it turned out to be pretty nice.I used less tomato sauce(8 oz can) 'cause not too keen of the tomatoey taste.It still tasted a bit sweet,will use less diced tomato next time. Used 5 cups of freshly made beef stock. And boiled pasta seperately like someone suggested and added to soup bowl.Added a bit of mozzarella for texture and flavour.Overall quite a nice blend of vegetables !!

I've made this recipe dozens of times and it always tastes great. It's perfect for a cool day, although a bit time consuming with all the chopping of the veggies. I always add extra onions & garlic and saute it with the hamburger meat. In addition to the veggies listed I add in a diced zucchini and a diced yellow squash, and use a mixture of light & dark kidney beans. I also omit the cabbage because of personal preference. In the fall I make it with all fresh veggies from the farmers market, since I use fresh green beans I add them in with the tomato & bean mixture to cook. The macaroni gets cooked separate and I ladle the soup over it and store the soup & macaroni separate so the noodles don't get mushy. I always add extra water, I just eyeball it.

This is a wonderful soup.  I have made this many times.  I always add more water and beef boullion granules.  I have made this with the beef and without.  I usually omit the cabbage and either omit the pasta alltogether, or add it into each individual bowl after ladling out the soup.  Don't like mushy pasta and if you have leftovers, when you reheat the soup the pasta will be mushy.  Plus, pasta soaks up way too much broth.  Overall, delicious and easy enough to make on a busy weeknight.

This is super great soup! I did have to modify the recipe just a bit. The recipe didn't say to drain the corn or green beans, so I didn't. In addition to what the recipe called for I added: 5 cups water (I added this gradually, but next time I'll just add it with the cabbage), 1 Tablespoon beef boullion granules, 1/2 tsp black pepper and 1/8 tsp Chinese HOT chili sauce. 

Very good! Family loved it, except for the three year old!

This is a fantastic soup that is very easy to make!

I use ground turkey meat and go a little heavier on the garlic and onions.

Freezes great as well.  I recommend this recipe to anyone who likes to make big batches of food to freeze for later meals.

Thanks Jackie!! We love soup in our house, this
was wonderful, I would have to believe it is good
for you with all those veggies!! It was a little
too thick so I added 5 cups water altogether.
Awesome flavor, very hearty, you leave the table
feeling good. This is a keeper. Yum Yum !!

I scaled this recipe for 150 people for my fourth graders to make for "take your parents to school day".  The parents and kids raved over this soup.  Not only was it a nutritious meal for them to create, but it was relatively simple considering we were managing eight crock pots of it!  Worth trying!!!

Made the soup with chicken broth since I was out of beaf. It smelled so good while making. My husband was stalking the pot waiting for it to finish. Will certainly make this again. I used dried herbs and canned tomatoes if I had more time I would use fresh based on the other reviews.

This is really flavorful. The first time I made it the directions were followed exactly...minus the cabbage. Can not stand cook cabbage. 
Second time was experiment time. I did add two more cups of water as well as a generous splash of Côtes-du-Rhône, a nice little red wine I like to use in cooking. Turned out fantastic!
Once again, I took some over to my 95 year old Swiss neighbor. Having learned from the chicken noodle soup, this time I took over enough for her to have a couple of meals from it. She comes from Italian Canton Ticino here. She said it reminded her of the soup her mother use to make. I think that is a pretty good endorsement!

Good and hearty soup!  I had to add another can of tomato sauce and about 2-3 cups more water than called for.  With the additional liquids I added more seasoning to make sure it wasn't bland.  This makes a lot of soup!!!

I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef and it was spectacular.  Served with a grilled cheese sandwich . . . heaven!

Love this soup! I make the macaroni on the side so it doesn't soak up all the juice.

I've been making this soup for years and it is my favorite.  Today I took a double recipe to a church luncheon.  When I  went to get some, it was GONE!!!  I had several people ask for the recipe.  Yes, it is that good.  I do not add salt since the beef bouillon adds plenty of salt.  I also use 2 -3 heaping cups of cabbage.

Very Good. Switched some of the veggies around and used a can of enchilada sauce in place of tomato and of course upped the garlic quite a bit. Turned out great.

Delicious! I'm not much of a soup person but I loved this one (4 times now).  Simple to make and a real crowd pleaser!  I used hot Italian sausage instead of ground beef.

All my family loved it except my picky 9 yr. old grand-daughter.  Followed the recipe very closely, but had to use black beans instead of kidney beans, for that is all I had on hand.  (My family prefers black beans).  Great recipe, which I highly recommend!

I thought this was great.  Taking the suggestion of so many, I added more water - 3 cups worth - and I used 3 beef bouillon cubes in total.  I drained both the corn and kidney beans before putting them in and only used 1 can of beans.  I used fresh french green beans...AND...I did the whole thing in the slow cooker.  I started real late on this, at 3pm and I put it on high.  I was finished chopping everything up and threw it all in by 3:30pm.  Since time was going to be tight, I put it on high as I was throwing everything in to get it started.  By 7:30pm, although the veggies weren't completely done, we had dinner ready.  It's still in the crock pot now actually and I'm giving it another hour total.  It was a really great and very healthy meal.  I will definitely make it again!  Super easy, too.

Absolutely delightful and definitely hearty.  Flavors are not real powerful, but they blend nicely.  Made the full recipe for the two of us and packaged the rest for the freezer, so I followed a tip and cooked the pasta separately (just enough for two). Do yourself a favor and leave the house for a minute and enjoy the aroma when you come back in!

This was very tasty and my family enjoyed it. I didn't have cabbage on hand so I left it out. I must say though that it would have been a great addition. As I was making this I wondered how it would be enough liquid to make it a soup and it wasn't. It was more of a stew. I was tempted to add some more broth after the fact but it was yummy as a stew so why bother? I will make this again.

This was a very good soup!  The second time I made it I followed some suggestions of others and added cheese tortellini (from the refrigerated section) and about 3/4 cup of spaghetti sauce, those enhancements bring it to a 5 star rating!

Loved it!  Used Herbox beef instant bouillon. Lightly sauteed the celery, onion, carrots and garlic before adding to the soup pot.  Used fresh green beans (had them in the fridge)  Didn't use the corn or cabbage (didn't have them available). It was so delicious!!  And I agree with another reviewer - tastes a lot like Olive Garden soups (which I like, especially their pasta e fagioli soup.

I have never liked vegetable soup but I realized last night it's because I have only had the canned vegetable soup. This was great, I did use 24oz of beef stock instead of water and added 1 tablespoon of garlic powder as LGREEN2 suggested. Also did not use corn or macaroni. My wife loved it also so I'll definitely make this again.

This is a great, hearty soup for the winter.  Easy to make and the flavor was better the second day.  I used all of the ingredients but I don't measure when it comes to soup so I add lots of carrots, celery, etc.  Also I used frozen vegetables instead of canned.   It was too thick for me so I added extra beef stock.

Soooo delicious! I do add more garlic and basil but that is just personal preference.. Beyond that i use 4 cups of beef broth and skip the water and bouillon. I love this soup!!! Hearty and scrumptious!

Tried this a couple of weeks ago does make a lot - so good, if you want to share.  I also used a can of beef broth and undercooked the macaroni some so would not be so mushy upon re-heating. Used 1 can of black beans & 1 kidney.   Was much better the 2nd day as flavors had a chance to meld.  I would make it again.

I tried this recipe several years ago at my mom's house one cold winter afternoon. It's the best soup she ever made, but I thought she had cleaned out the fridge and just thrown everything in the pot.  I was so happy to find there was actually a recipe and I could make it just like that again! My family loves it, I always share with neighbors because I double the recipe.  I make it for big groups and I get raves everytime I make it. We sprinkle fresh shredded Parmesan on top when serving. This is our all-time favorite soup!

Excellent!!!  However it does need more liquid so I added four cups of beef broth.  It does make a LOT of soup... in fact, it fills a five and half quart dutch oven.  I've made this three times already this winter. It's a healthy, delicious soup and I think everyone would enjoy on a cold winter day....

I made this almost exactly as written and it was fantastic.  We truly enjoyed this soup- for several days as a matter of fact.  The only difference I made was that I boiled the pasta separately and added to the individual bowls to keep it from absorbing all of the wonderful broth.  This is definitely on the rotation!!!!  Thanks you for a great recipe!

What a fabulous meal in a bowl! I was missing some ingredients so I made some improvisation. I used ground chicken instead of beef, baked beans instead of kidney beans, and frozen green beans instead of canned ones. Like others, I found it needed a lot more water - 6-8 cups instead of 2. I didn't have any crusty Italian bread to serve this with, so I made some pita chips (split the pita open, spray with oil spray, sprinkle with granulated garlic and/or zaatar, cut into wedges and bake until they begin to toast) and used them. It was a fantastic combo!

Unbelievably good!  Actual recipe is great as a main course as it's thick with the meat, pasta and all the veggies.  I added a can of beef boullion and more water as I added veggies to make it a soup.  Outstanding both ways!  The broth is to die for.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.  It's a keeper.

WONDERFUL. I used vegetable broth to add a little more juices and I didn't have tomato sauce so I used tomato purée. But this a great recipe.

This has been a family favorite for years. We use V8 juice & veggie or beef bouillion powder/broth instead of tomato sauce and add spinach either frozen or fresh with some black pepper.  Sometimes we even make it purely vegetarian for a lighter meal.  It also works well in the crockpot on low for families on the go.  Like Gramma Gorgeous we don't put the pasta in the soup during cooking, but add it during serving or reheating.

Good and good for you! I added a little red wine for flavor and cook the macaroni separately!  I'm freezing the leftovers for later! Way too much for 2 People. YUM!

So good!! I am actually making it again tonight. Last time I followed Jackie's the recipe EXCEPT I used spinach instead of cabbage and ground turkey instead of ground beef because I had a ton on hand and instead of all water, I did 2 cups of water AND 2 cups of beef broth. I found it needed some extra seasoning at the end (extra of the spices the recipe called for plus sea salt and pepper). Also, I highly recommend letting the soup simmer for a couple hours. I taste tested after completion and it was good but after a few hours on the stove it was even better. I think I may use my crock pot today. I also think I would prefer to reduce the tomato sauce, add another cup of water and some more garlic (these are just ideas, haven't tried them yet). Moral of the story, this is a great recipe; even better for adding your own flare to accommodate your taste. Thanks, Jackie!

I did not care for this recipe. Bland & it says serves 8 but really like 16! Too many ingredients. Almost overflowed my huge soup pot. Less, is more here for sure.

I love this soup! Very hearty and delicious. I made a few changes. I added a tbsp. of Italian seasoning, oregano,and basil. I also added black pepper and perfect blend seasoning to the ground beef. I used beef broth when it called for water and used more after adding the pasta. The pasta will absorb a lot of liquid.

This is a great recipe. The only thing I did different was I use Jonhsonville Italian sausage and some italian seasoning. Instead of pasta I used brown rice waiting until close til the end to add so the rice would me firm. A half a teaspoon nutmeg helps bring out the flavor in the sausage.

Best soup I ever made...I used fresh herbs and veggies instead of canned. I used beef stock from a jar and created veggie stock within the soup with the pulp from the veggies I juiced this morning. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and added hot italian sausage links to add some kick. So good.

This recipe is so yummy! It tastes like something that would be served at Olive Garden or Carrabas! Made a huge pot to have extra to freeze for the coming winter. Thanks for posting this recipe! It's exactly what I was looking for!

This soup has a very nice blend of veggies and pasta to make a great meal.  The main change needed is extra liquid. I used water and extra spices as I followed the recipe as written and didn't have extra broth. Next time I will add either extra broth, tomato juice or sauce. I like the extra liquid as I think it freezes better when the veggies are covered in liquid. I used little shells for the pasta.  All in all a great soup.

Took some prep time, but worth it for the taste and appearance.  So many veggies!  I made the entire soup the day before I needed it, letting it simmer for maybe 1/2 hour or more.  Next day, put back in soup pot and simmer until its hot.  Very good flavor!

This recipe is easy to prepare and very tasty.  I added a TS of black pepper and a little extra on the other seasonings.  I also used salt added diced tomatoes thinking that the no salt option would be too bland.  I don't mind the veggies to be a little crisp in soup, but if you prefer them softer I recommend you saute the onions, carrots and celery a bit before adding the tomatoes and water.

This recipe might be a good starting point, but because I had to add so much extra water, the broth turned out very bland and tasteless.   I added more beef boullion (ran out of beef broth), but I should have added more tomatoes and spices as well.  I did that when I reheated for lunch today, and it was better.  I think I will stick to my Italian Sausage Soup recipe and just add more veggies to make it "Italian Vegetable Soup."  We like the flavor of the sausage more than the hamburger anyway.

This is a hardy soup that you can change up easily with whatever vegetables you have on hand. I used ground turkey and fresh green beans, frozen roasted corn from Trader Joe's... followed other directions... will make again and again...

This was incredibly good... I took out the beans and corn because I don't like them... switched spinach in for cabbage, added two cans V8 juice, and cooked the macaroni seperately- adding it at the end. It was amazing, especially with French bread. Definitely will make again. Easy and perfect for freezing in small lunch containers.

Made this recipe as doudled with 2 lbs of wild elk meatballs, left out corn, added 2 heads of Broccoli, fresh sting beans. WOW, what a meal!! Served over a bed of Pasta or long grain and wild rice, you need just some good Italian bread and your set. As written this recipe is also a wonderful meal but you must have the bread to soak up all the soup liquid. It's woerful stuff when the Temp. is 5 degrees out. Eaten in front of the wood stove watching a foorball game it's Home as home should be. Thank you.

This was SO good!  I followed directions and used all of the ingredients.  I did not put in corn because I didn't have any.  I used orzo pasta.  I find it holds up better and doesn't become mushy.  It was very a comforting food on a cold winter night with warm crusty bread.   Yum.  Will definitely make again.

I used this recipe for a basic veg soup.  I left out gr.beef, bullion & macaroni.  I did add diced potatoes.  For the 2 cups water I used the liquid from the can of tomatoes and added water to make 2 cups.  Oh, and 2 tsp Mrs Dash.  EVERYBODY loves this recipe.  There is no fat in it and the beans have protein.  I guess you could add squash as corn, beans & squash make a complete protein. Makes a thicker chunky soup, which is what I like.  Thank you Jackie!!

This was easy and delicious!  I took others advice and used 3 cans of 99% fat free beef broth instead of bouillon granules and water.  I also skipped the meat and used whole wheat pasta shells because of what I had in the house.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is wonderful--just as it is!  It is so flavorful!  One man was complaining to me that his wife would not eat.  I made this soup and took it to them.  She ate TWO bowls and is still telling me how much she loved it.  We also make this soup, freeze it in thirds, so we have it for ill church members when we need it.  The only change I ever make is reducing the amount of tomato sauce in half since some people have difficulty with so much tomato.  The Italian herbs are super.  I'm really excited about using fresh herbs in it this summer.

Yummy! I think this is a very tasty soup and although I normally follow the recipe the first time I make it,this time right away I knew there wasn't enough water to make a soup.  I ended up using 5 cups of water, 2 cans of beef broth, and only 3 tsp. of bouillon.  Possibly the recipe should have read "4 quarts" of water. I also increased the spices to 1-1/2 teaspoons each as suggested. I'll make it again and again with the changes and next time I want to try it with Italian Sausage rather than ground beef.  With the adding of liquid and more spice, I would give it 5 stars.

Similar to my recipe for Minestrone soup but I add 1 can kidney beans and 1 can white cannellini beans. In place of the water, I up the amount of liquid and use (4 to 6 cups) of beef broth or stock. We prefer baby spinach in place of cabbage and I also add a couple of peeled and cubed red skinned potatoes. I have never use ground beef or corn but might try it next time. Since beef bouillon granules are mainly all salt, 5 teaspoons seems too much to me. I'd add 2 teaspoons at first and increase if necessary to suit your taste. You can always add more bouillon but you can't take it out once added. Unless you plan on eating the entire pot of soup, definitely cook your pasta separately, spoon into bowls and ladle hot soup over. All-in-all a hearty meal. Sprinkle with Parmesan or Romano cheese and serve with lots of crusty Italian bread, for sopping up.

I really modified this recipe due to the veggies I had on hand. First I used pasta sauce in place of tomato sauce, it already was seasoned with Italian seasonings so I skipped adding those. I used carrots, celery, onions, garlic, tomato, white kidney beans, beef bouillon (which I could have left out), cabbage, and green and yellow summer squash. I also had left over shredded chuck roast from a previous meal that I used in place of the ground beef. I let it all simmer for a good 30 minutes before I added about another 2 cups of water and then added about 1/2 cup of macaroni pasta. Brought the whole thing to a boil for about 7 more minutes and served. This soup was so good and can be totally improvised based on what you have on hand. This made a HUGE batch so I will be freezing a portion of this. Thanks for sharing.

Very tasty soup!  I followed others' advice and cooked my (whole wheat) macaroni separately.  I used fresh green beans, adding them to the pot about halfway into the 20 minute simmer time.  I also made the soup vegetarian.  I used Italian seasoned tempeh and followed the maker's instructions on turning it into tempeh sausage.  I also used veggie boullion instead of beef.  End result- a hearty yet healthy soup!

This hit the spot for our first soup of the fall. I made it in the crock pot, using vegetarian Italian sausage cut into 1/2" pieces  in lieu of the ground beef and did not add the pasta. Other than that, I followed the receipe to the letter. MORE than enough leftovers to look forward to for lunches this week. A keeper.

This is so good! My only changes- use low sodium beef broth instead of water/bulion (and used about 3 cups more than recipe stated), used spicy turkey sausage instead of ground beef and left out the macaroni. I served it with parmesan cheese and hot sauce. I will be making this again, thanks!

Excellent recipe! I did add 2 additional cups of water and I used italian stewed tomatoes for additional flavor.  I also added 2 teaspoons beef base rather than the boullion.  Like others, I kept the pasta separate.  Tastes great!

We love this!  I've made it several times. I do add a lot more water as we love a real soupy soup.  I use "Better Than Bouillon" instead of bouillon cubes. It has much better flavor. I use a lot more of the dried herbs than called for as well. But it makes a wonderful meal and we love it. You might try boiling the pasta/noodles separate so it doesn't soak up all your water/juice in the soup.

This recipe is good as a base, and I like that it contains so many veggies and other good things, but it needed quite a few adjustments to make it tasty, hence three stars.

The amount of water listed isn't enough to make it "soupy".  I used about triple the water, and it still came out more like chili in consistancy.  I also used more boullion, garlic and herbs than suggested to give it more flavor.

I have never reviewed a recipe from this site but I just had to with this one.  It's that good!  I used hot italian turkey sausage in place of the ground beef, tortellin instead of macaroni, which I added about 10 minutes before serving, and one 32 ox. box Kitchen Basics beef stock (about 3/4 of the box) and 3 bouillon cubes instead of the water.  I also added about 8 oz. V8 juice and skipped the cabbage since we do  not like it. I doubled the spices and added about a half tsp. of thyme. As good as this was right away, it was 10 times better the next day as leftovers.  Might try red potatoes the next time in place of the tortellini.  Absolutely delicious!

This soup was perfect for our first cool autumn day!  I tried to follow the recipe exactly, except that instead of ground beef I used beef stew meat because it was on sale at the grocery.  I didn't separate the macaroni out as other reviewers had suggested, and it did become mushy, but it still tasted great.  (Next time I will separate.) I served this with sourdough bread and it was delicious.  I'll make this one again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this last night for my partner and I as an starter. This is obviously best served as part of the main course as it is so full but it worked great in a small serving. 

We both loved this recipe, I haven't given it 5 stars because I think there was a tiny bit of room for improvement but it was still great and I will make it again. I didn't include the celery because I forgot to buy it but didn't feel like it needed to be there anyway

Thanks for a great recipe, its a very thick soup so I'm going to have it on toast for breakfast!

This was wonderful on a cold day! I omitted the cabbage though as my people aren't fans, but it was still great. Even my three yr old who won't eat beef stew or anything like that thought it was good. I served it with bread and it was a complete meal. Thanks!

I have to give this one five stars because my husband said this was one of the best soups he has ever had and he is not usually one to rave.  I omitted the ground beef and ended up trippling the water and adjusting the seasoning accordingly.  It was very, very thick without the additional water.  Very easy to make and great flavor.  Will definitely make again.

This is a WONDERFUL soup! I threw all of it in my stockpot last night, and stuck it in the fridge. This morning I heated it to simmering, and it is near done, and the taste and smell is great! I did not fix the macaroni, and I don't think I will, and was out of ground beef, so  quartered and sliced some smoked sausage. It seems to be a full bodied soup as it is. Only flaw was maybe Jackie the submitter meant 2 QUARTS of water? But no biggie, have made plenty of homemade soups, and know to adjust the liquid and or broth level to our likings, and if I up the liquid, know to adjust the seasonings and or bouillon too. This will go so well with French crusty bread. Can't wait til dinner!

This was really good. I didn't have all the ingredients, so I made a few changes. I didn't have celery or the beans or cabbage, but I did add some yellow squash. I think this is a good recipe to change the way you like it. It did turn out less like a soup and more like a stew for me too. But that's the way our family likes it!

I made a double batch of this, using the ground turkey, spinach and low sodium V8 version....we all loved it, though my 9 year old got suspicious when my husband mentioned V8-we got around that though!It was tasty, and with a sour dough baguette, a perfect meal for a fall day.

Delicious soup.  I made with ground turkey instead of beef and had to doctor it up with extra spices because it was a little bland, but besides that, it was perfect.  Made lots too so we'll be able to enjoy it in our lunches.

One of the best vegetable soups I have eaten.  For the diced tomatoes, I used the Italian style tomatoes and used two cans, instead of one, to make the soup a little 'soupier'.

This was pretty good, but not thrilling. Definitely a hearty soup, and it makes A LOT! I thought it was heavy on the tomato, and needed a little extra flavor. My husband really enjoyed it, so we will probably make it again.

I use an altered more veggie-friendly version of this recipe a lot, and have gotten good reviews, even from our quite non-vegetarian family. I eliminated the beef (and celery-yuck) altogether, replaced water with veggie broth for added flavor (although it was good with water too) and replaced the macaroni with red potatoes. Also, the first time I accidently made it with seasoned spaghetti sauce instead of just plain tomato sauce and the extra flavor was good so I left it in my recipe. It's a great "normal" soup to serve guests who shy away from creative cooking.

This soup is incredible! I have to admit I made some additions, but it great before as well. Since I had some leftover pesto I added that and a little cream, and I substitued spinach for cabbage as a personal preference. My boyfriend is a vegetarian so I put in meatballs instead of ground beef, and he was able to eat around them. I love how this recipe makes a lot so you can have leftovers the next few days. You really must try this soup.

Great recipe, easy and covers the basic love of a good vegi soup.  Nothing fancy, just what you expect from a good home-cooked soup.  My husband loved it, and he's a very simple meat and potatoes guy.  Will make it again for sure!

I really love this soup. I made it tonight for the second time. I do add a bag of spinach and some black pepper but other than that I follow the recipe exactly. My 20 month son ate a bowl of soup with all the veggies and the oldest would only eat the corn (but he is picky and doesn't try anything new. Great soup.

I'm sorry but this recipe was a waste of time and money for me. Way too chunky for my taste even after I added extra water. Just a little over the top with all the ingredients. We could'nt enjoy the different flavors, just tasted mushy. Makes a ton and most of it went down the disposal! Better luck next time.

Very good.  Reminded me more of a stew than a soup.  I added 2 cans of beef broth instead of using the granules.  Will definately make again but next time I will try it with beef stew meat instead of ground.

Agree with all - this is awesome.  I doubled it for a huge potful and to freeze.  Great way to use up odds and ends--open packages of frozen veggies.  I substituted frozen hash browns for half the macaroni.  Added a small can of V-8 for more liquid.  I'll definitely save and re-use this.

I've made this twice now.  It's my absolute favorite.  Very hearty, great flavor.  I use fresh herbs.  I didn't add the sugar the 2nd time, and prefer it without the sugar.  The corn makes it sweet enough.

This does make a LOT, so be prepared to eat some soup!  I used Better Than Bouillon beef base (which I highly recommend -- look for it by canned broth) instead of bouillon cubes and water.  I substituted chopped redskins for the macaroni (I was concerned the noodles would get mushy before we finished off all the soup).  I threw everything in my crockpot and cooked until the potatoes were tender.

I thought this was a great soup, but was missing a little *zing*, so I added half a large can of V-8 juice to suit my tastes.  PERFECT!  All you need is good, crusty bread!

Very flavorful. I used ground turkey instead of beef and also added extra veggies from the fridge that needed to be used up. I would suggest you let is simmer for a bit longer at the end. Great meal in a bowl!

Loaded with vegetables and very, very easy to make. Has an authentic homemade flavor. Tastes even better after refrigerating for a day or two. This should be on the "regular" list for anyone who likes easy, but tasty food, especially those who work and like extras to pack for lunch.

A great soup that develops more flavor on the second and third leftover-day! I made a double batch which didn't quite all make it into the pot so mine was without kidney beans or macaroni. A good "stew" the first night. For lunch the next day I added lots more water and the macaroni. Now, on the second day of leftovers, I am still not bored with it!! Needs a good amount of salt when serving, though...

This is a wonderful, flavorful soup.  The only change I made was to use 5 cups of water and more beef bouillon.  I served it to 8 people and it was a great hit.  There were plenty of leftovers.

Stout, hearty soup ... was so thick and flavorful that I didn't bother to add the macaroni.  It was GREAT! This will become a staple in our "soup-once-a-week" menus.

This easy to make soup is simply delicious! I have made it several times and it turns out great every time. I did have to add extra water as mentioned in the recipe. I also changed the point where the canned red kidney beans are added. I found that the beans maintain their texture better when they are added towards the end of the cooking, with the cabbage, canned green beans and canned corn. Try this recipe. You won't be disappointed

I've made this soup many times over the years and it never disappoints. It is  really flexible and allows for alot of substitutions.  Some that I commonly make are kale for cabbage, frozen or fresh veg for canned, broth (whatever I have) for bullion.  Although I really like the kidney beans, you can substitute for whatever you have in the pantry.  I often leave out the macaroni.  A staple recipe for my family.

I love this soup. I used  4 cups of beef broth and 2 cups of water. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and spinach instead of cabbage. I also added salt and black pepper to it. The grated Parmesan is a major plus. I suggest to add it to your bowl instead of the pot of soup. However, it was super delicious! Definitely will make it again.

This was delicious! I had to use different pasta but still wonderful. More flavorful than I thought. The leftovers were thicker , so it was less like soup more like casserole but we didn’t care because of the flavor. I would make it again.

Easy and yummy, my two favorite things! I used frozen corn because I like the flavor better. We enjoyed it on a never-ending cold winter day here in South Dakota.

Delicious.  Followed recipe exactly, except cooked pasta separately, as another reviewer suggested, and added just enough for each serving so it tasted fresh even after being kept in the fridge or freezer.

Good, but not very soupy. I added more beef, and added about 3-4 cups of water, but it still wasn't enough.

Very delicious. I loved it so much that I ended up making it twice in 2 weeks! Leftovers were still great, even with the noodles being cooked with the other ingredients. The second time I made it, I added extra ground beef and noodles and it was still very delicious. Will make again.

This is divine!  So good on a wet, cold day.  I did make two small changes.  I added a box of beef broth and, switched the cabbage for kale (we don't like cabbage), and did not add the green beans at all just because I didn't have any on hand.  Slow cooked all afternoon.  Added penne instead of macaroni so it wouldn't be "mushy" as some commented.   It was superb.   Thank you for healthy, flavorful recipe!  I will be making this one again.

This soup is delicious! I left the pasta out, mainly because I don't have room in the pot! I don't miss it at all, the beans and veggies are very filling.

Delicious & so easy! I subbed 1 carton of beef broth in place of the water, and used 3 beef bouillon cubes. I didn’t have corn or cabbage but didn’t miss it. Didn’t care for so many beans so next time I’ll only use 1 can. Top it off with a little bit of Parmesan cheese and this recipe is a winner!

This was very good.  The only thing I did differently was  cooking the pasta separately and adding just before serving.  The receipe does make a lot.  I will definitely be making it again.

My mom wanted something soupy and warm and I was pretty sure we hadn't eaten a vegetable in some months. So I made this! I wound up using veggies in a bag and canned beans but she still liked it a lot! Thanks!

Followed recipie almost exactly, I accidentally used chicken bone broth, and I bought shredded cabbage (feeling lazy) it was AMAZING. I also used frozen green beans and corn just because that’s what I had on hand.

This was a good hearty soup.  It does make a lot, but I love having soup in the refrigerator for whenever anyone is hungry.  The only thing I changed was to add some cayenne pepper and a little salt, as we thought it was too bland when we taste -tested it.  With those additions, it was spot on.

Easy, healthy and Delicious! I used 93% lean ground beef, used frozen corn and green beans (not a liver of canned vegetables). Made enough for a small army. Sooo good- even my picky husband didn’t think it needed anything changed.

This was pretty good. Followed the recipe but to me after it simmered a while tasted like it was missing something spice wise. Will make again but add more seasonings. Very hearty soup.

Delish!  Snowy and cold last night was perfect for this soup.  I made it because I had all ingredients on hand.  My husband wasn't too excited but declared it a winner!  I didn't change the recipe - but I did change the type of ingredient for what I had.  For example - no bullion, I used beef stock.  I didn't have canned green beans or corn - I used frozen.  And for the pasta - I had cheese ravioli's in the freezer so used that.  Only criticism from the hubby was to add some crushed red pepper next time to spice it up a bit..  This is a keeper!

Great recipe however I made a few changes.  I used a 24oz box of beer stock instead of the water and bouillon.  I used frozen and fresh veggies- no cans except for pinto beans.   I cooked it all in crockpot for six hours then added cabbage.  Served macaroni on side to cut the cards for those of us who are dieting.

the soup was so hearty.  I don't care for ground beef in my soup so I subbed pot roast for it.  I cooked it in a crock pot as  the other review said to do.  Didn't much care for the  pot roast in this.  it was a little greasy.  next time I'll use bone in shanks.  The soup itself was good.  I'll make it again.

I made it with ground turkey instead of ground beef, substituted the canned corn with 1 cup of frozen corn, replaced the cabbage with frozen spinach and didn’t use any beef bouillon - because wanted to keep it low sodium. I added a little salt to taste and some black pepper and cayenne. I added large shells instead of macaroni.

This soup is delicious as prepared...I only added a 1/2 cup more water just because I like the broth. I didn’t add pasta because it tends to get mushy..I made it on the side and added for each bowl. Very good recipe and I will definitely make again!

Great recipe!  I made this but added some ground Italian sausage and used Rotel (diced tomatoes and green chilies) for the diced tomatoes.  The soup got rave reviews!

Very tasty.  I used "chicken - better than bouillon", left out beans and corn - party because there is only 2 of us and party because that sounded better today.  Also used some different spices because I didn't have what was in the recipe.  Saved it and will be making it again!

We've been making this for years now, and it is one of our favorites. The only thing we've changed is the cabbage. Which is probably a great, but never have it on hand for an impromptu dinner.  We've done beef broth instead of water and bouillion - just depends on what I have on hand that day.  Any small pasta will do - shells is our fave.

Excellent soup!  I will be making this soup often all winter long.  I only made minor changes to the recipe to suit my taste. I'm sure it's excellent as is though.  I left out the ground beef since my husband and I are trying to eat a plant source diet as best we can (however, I did use the beef bouillon, as it adds so much flavor).  I used 3 cups veggie stock, plus the 2 cups of water, as I like a soupier soup. I also increased the dried oregano and basil to 1 tsp. each, and I used cannellini  beans in place of the kidney beans, since I do not like kidney beans. This is now my favorite vegetable soup.

This is terrific!  I’m certain it would be delicious made exactly as the recipe instructs, but I’m too lazy to go shopping so I used what I had on hand. Browned the beef, drained, then dumped everything in. Used fresh herbs, skipped the pasta and corn due to sensitivities at my house, and subbed cannelloni beans for the kidney beans.  Dumped a whole carton of beef stock in stead of the water/granules.  And threw in a couple of bay leaves because that’s what my mom does.  Yummy and comforting on a cold rainy day!

Added a little bacon to start, wasn't shy with portions. Don't use applewood smoked, adds too much flavor.

Very good recipe and  I will make again.  This first time I used a 28 oz can of tomato sauce and then diced up some fresh tomatoes.  This may have affected the amount of moisture as there clearly was not enough.  The next time I will go with what another reviewed suggested; that being to use a box or two of beef broth.

Wow what a favourable soup! I think it's from the great variety and colour. I made the beef version for my family but then made a veggie version for me--no beef. I doubled the ingredients, used frozen veggie instead of canned. I also threw in 2 cups of spinach, 1.5 cups of hemp hearts, chia seeds. I used veggie broth instead of beef and different pasta noodles. This is jam packed hearty goodness and great for freezing as I cook in bulk!

Love this soup...one of my favorites now.  Super easy to make.  I always add extra vegetables to my soup as I like a hearty veggie soup.  Added kale, more carrots, bag of mixed vegetables, can of black beans.  Add whatever you like to this soup.  The italian sausage gives it a really good flavor

Made this as per recipe and my husband loved it.Has been asking me to make it again.This is a great recipe,very easy,and could be modified by adding a few ingredients that you personally want to add.You could use a carton of beef broth and less bouillon if desired.It would still be delish because it's a great basis for a wonderful nourishing hearty soup.

This is a really great recipe. Made it just as specified except used ground turkey instead of hamburger. Only thing it seems to be missing is some crushed red pepper or something to give it a "kick". It's prefect if you don't like spicy.

Wonderful flavor. Super easy to make. Even my pickiest eater likes this recipe - Hooray!
I do advise to pre-soften the carrots and celery. They were a bit under cooked. I also cooked the pasta separately and added it at the end.

Made it a second time. This time I did not have kidney beans so I doubled the beef and I omitted the cabbage. Still DELICIOUS!

I made this last night!  I had left over chicken breasts (cooked) I used instead of ground beef.  Instead of beef bullion and beef broth, I substituted with chicken bullion & chicken broth.  While it was cooking, the chicken shredded and was perfect for the soup.  With Italian bread & salad it was super.  Will definitely make again!

Delicious. Next time I'll omit the cabbage but that's simply personal taste. I did slice up sausage instead of ground beef and sautéed the onions, garlic and sausage before adding the rest as the instruction dictated. I'll definitely be using this recipe again!

Excellent soup/stew!!! Being vegetarian, I left out the beef, and used vegetable broth. It still is a GREAT soup. Due to other reviews, I also left the macaroni out and added it when serving. I also substituted brown rice at times for the macaroni.

I used 4 cups organic beef stock,  1 cup homemade tomato sauce, in place of bouillon cubes and water. Only 1 can of white beans, which I added after carrots and celery softened. Fresh green beans, didn't add corn. Not too fond of the ground beef, try beef stew meat next time. Very thick, didn't add any macaroni.

I initially started with all the ingredients. But I had also added 5 cups of beef broth. I tasted it and continued to slowly add more oregano and basil. I would say appx 4 tsp oregano and 3 tsp of basil. I also add 1/2 tsp of pepper. It was very tasty!!!! This is the 3rd time I've made this soup in the past 2 months. Taste it periodically and add more seasonings to your taste. Was too bland before

This is a great dish! When I made it I followed the directions to a tee and really loved it! It was more like a vegetable stew than soup, very hearty. But everyone, including my cabbage hating husband, couldn't get enough! I am making it for a second time tonight,  but vegan style. Using chick peas and black beans in place of kidney beans (only because someone doesn't like them) and vegetable broth instead of water. I'm also omitting the hamburger and macaroni, and adding some torn kale as well. Can't wait!

Hubby says to rate this "awesome." I made it just as directed, except I didn't measure the spices :-), and it was delicious. It is WAYYYY more than 5 servings, however!

I made the soup but added one can of green peas and one can of Lima beans. I also added more Oregano and basil plus some salt and black pepper.  I added about 3 to 4 cups of more water. It was very good.

Excellent! My family and I enjoyed this soup. Very easy but I did allow this soup to simmer for 2-3 hours.

This recipe has become a weekly staple in our household. Just love all the veggies, great flavor. Just put the pot on the back burner and everyone helps themselves to a bowl. Makes my life easy on those nights when everyone is running !! Thanks :o)

This is absolutely delicious! I used vegetarian crumbles instead of ground beef, but you would never know it - nothing lost in flavor. I was surprised the recipe did not call for salt or pepper and got it out of the cupboard to add, but had to taste it first. I put them back into the cupboard, really no need for it! I left simmer on the stove for extra time, then turned it off and the flavors blended well, dinner time got close I turned back on to heat up. I imagine it will be even better tomorrow! Thank you for a fabulous recipe, Jackie!!

This is such an excellent recipe!!!  Definitely will make it again.  I
only replaced the cabbage with fresh spinach and instead of macaroni I
used 4 potatoes.  Highly recommend this one!!!   Cathy

I admit I did have to change a few things in this recipe including ommitting celery, carrots, and using jalepeno pepper flavored tomatoes instead of regular, but if you like a little bit of spice the jalepeno tomatoes were a great addition.

I thought this was a really good soup. I did not use macaroni, tomato sauce, and ground beef. I just wanted a thin vegetable soup. That's just how I was feeling today. I like this soup because you can taylor it to how you feel or what you have on hand.

Great flavor. Made exactly as recipe stated. Would recommend making macaroni separate and adding when soup is done as macaroni gets over-cooked.

I made this soup for the first time today and will make again and again.  The perfect recipe for healthy eating after the holidays. I made it pretty much per the directions..but you know how it is when you make soup..you don't ever follow the recipe exactly. I did have to add more water at the end

Tasted even better the next day. I followed the suggestions others made to cook pasta for less time.
I also made the following changes: used 8 oz cooked sausage, 1 can kidney beans, frozen corn, spinach instead of cabbage, fresh green beans, added 1 1/2 cups extra water and increased beef bouillon accordingly.

This is a great soup! It does not have a lot of extra broth which my family loves. I used beef stock instead of the water and cooked the macaroni separate but other than that I followed the recipe. Thank you for a new favorite!

Excellent - As a vegan I had to made a few changes.  I substituted Soy crumbles for the beef, vegetable bouillon for the beef bouillon.  I also used a large 28oz can of fire roasted crushed tomatoes and 8oz can of sauce and I added extra garlic, of course.  This was definitely a hit with the whole family!  A great soup to freeze for later lunches and dinners, I didn't add pasta until I was ready to serve since pasta gets too soft when frozen.  Thanks for passing this along!

Loved this recipe!  I gave it a 4 only because I had to add an additional 2 cups of water.  It was very thick otherwise.  As a vegetarian I omitted the beef and used vegetarian bouillon.  Also, I was out of kidney beans and so I used 1 can of butter beans and one can of navy beans.  My new favorite!

This was very tasty! My only changes were I used ground turkey and ended up adding another 2 1/2 tsp beef granules, two more cups water and some garlic salt to taste. It should taste even better tomorrow! I think when I make it again I'll add some beef stock

I've made this several times now and my family loves it!  It's now "my" vegetable soup recipe.  I do add some garbanzo beans and extra basil and oregano, but otherwise it's the same as here.  I have a huge pot of it on the stove now and it will last us a few days - this is definitely a keeper recipe!  Come summer I plan on adding some zucchini also.

This is called Minestrone. I'd add 32oz beef broth in place of the water, diced bell pepper, salt and black pepper. The cabbage is a nice touch, but not altogether necessary. I'd also sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the top just before serving.

Not much flavor but has the basics.  Add a few chili flakes (1/2 tsp or to taste), 3 bay leaves, 1 T minced garlic and a pkg of onion soup mix (instead of the bouillon) and then it's a 5!  I also left out the cabbage and canned green beans (fresh would be good) and used 8 oz of tomato sauce instead of 15 oz.

This was a wonderful soup! The only things I changed were browning the meat with the onions in a T of olive oil, using beef soup base instead of the bouillon granules, adding four cups water and leaving out the corn. Oh, and I adjusted the spices since I added more water. This soup is flavorful even without simmering all day! Unlike others I left the cabbage in since we love it!

I made this today and it was excellent. Most of my soup was the actual recipe as written but I too bumped it up a bit and made this with the "everyone in the pool mentality". I added zucchini, squash and kale to the soup. This is the first time I actually liked Kale...go figure! I used one can of beef broth (low sodium), 2 cups of water and two packets of beef bouillon. I used the dry herbs liberally and increased the garlic. I felt the need to add some garlic salt. I too used elbow macaroni and kept it out of the soup and added only when serving. My teenage daughter, who was convinced she would hate it, broke out a big smile and ate two bowls. 'Nuff said!

This is very close to my family recipe for minestrone! Being pure italian, I'd avoid putting in corn and garlic. Instead of kidney beans, I'd use borlotti, which are proper italian and give it all a full taste. To avoid small kids or fussy eaters complaining, I'd blend the soup and put rice or pastina. And buon appetito! :)

This was a delicious soup. I had to add about 4 cups of water as it was so thick. I added other pasta as I was out of macaroni.  This worked fine, but turned to mush when I reheated leftovers.  Best to cook pasta separately and add fresh to each cup of soup. This freezes well. I was happy to find it on a cold day!

I found this recipe while looking for a vegetable soup recipe. I don't consider it a true vegetable soup since it calls for ground beef, but it sounded good and simple, so I just went with it. I substituted italian sausage for the ground beef, and instead of a can of diced tomatoes I just cut up a big bowl of late summer, homegrown juicy tomatoes, but other than that I stuck to the recipe. We all loved it.

Excellent soup, used lean beef tips in place of ground beef. It made enough for several meals for two. Great to freeze. Used pinto beans since that was what I had, plus like them better. Thank you, in my recipe box forever !

Super yummy!  I used stewed tomatoes instead of diced and accidentally added twice as much oregano.  This turned out delicious and I definitely recommend.  Like another reviewer, I cooked the macaroni separately and added it into each bowl so that it didn't get too mushy.

This was delish! I added a lot, basically cleaned out my cabinets and freezer of veggies. Broth instead if water and adjusted as I went. Turkey instead of beef and some cream at the end.  Making again tonight.

This soup is delicious!  We make a double batch and freeze it in mason jars.  The only thing I changed was substitution of beef stock for bouillon cubes and I added a little brown sugar and a couples squirts of ketchup.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This soup was excellent and very quick to make. I added more water and beef base for a "soupier" soup. I also swapped in a little sugar (to take away the tomato's bitter edge),S & P, fresh herbs, garbanzo beans, fresh spinach, chard, and broccoli raabe. All thumbs up from the family. Can't wait to make this soup on a cold winter evening.

Omg!  This better than Olive Garden's. I substituted 2 cans of beef broth for the water and used one can of canellini beans and one kidney beans but that was it. I wondered why there was no seasoning added (salt and pepper) but it doesn't need a thing. I cooked the pasta separately so I can freeze half without having soggy noodles. I'm adding this recipe to my favorites list.

This is a great vegetable soup.  Personally I think I would have left out the ground beef.  Not that I'm a vegetarian, there was just this wonderful smell that it wouldn't have been missed.  Next time I think that's what I'll do.  I also added tomato juice for the extra liquid. A great stoup!  thanks for sharing

This recipe was hearty, delicious, and perfect for a fall stew.  I used chicken stock and ground chicken because it was what I had on-hand, and fresh green beans and corn.  The recipe needs much more stock/water to make it a soup; the pasta soaks up the remaining water and makes it more of a stew.

Oh my, this was amaaazing!! The only reason I gave it a 4 rather than a 5 is because I used more than twice the amount of stock/ water it called for to make it more soupy. I also made it vegetarian-friendly for my brother, and honestly, you don't even need to beef. Still amazing! I don't like green beans, so I left those out, but I added potatoes and it was awesome. My brother loved it and so did his super-picky roommate. Definitely making this recipe again and again!

I was pretty disappointed in this soup, although my family loved it.  I wanted more of a vegetable soup, and it was a bit too much meat for my liking.  However, my sons and husband liked it alot as they are big meat eaters. I also followed the other reviews and added more water than called for (3 cups more) and it still was too thick for me and more like a stew than a soup.    I would also suggest not putting the cabbage in until about 5 minutes before the soup is done as it was overcooked as was the pasta.  Next time, I will definitely use half of the meat. And add more fresh (not canned as we live in California and eating canned vegetables is nasty) vegetables.  I would as some mushrooms, and some zuchinni. I think this is a great base soup, but it can definitely be better than the reviews say it was.

This is a great soup.  I skipped the cabbage and added extra macaroni, then topped with mozzarella cheese.  I also added more canned tomatoes because the soup became very thick. Thanks for recipe!

Loved it! I made changes to suit my families taste. I used 1 can of beef broth and 1 can of water instead of bouillon granules. I did not use tomato sauce. In place of oregano and basil, I used 1 teaspoon of italian seasoning.

I altered the recipe by using lemon chicken instead of beef, added potato, and used 1/2 the amount of beef bullion as well not using tomatoes and green beans. My wife loved the soup, and she HATES chicken. It is a very good soup and very easy to make and alter while being very forgiving. I want to do it again, and next time use clams instead of beef or chicken. I expect I will have again great results.

Excellent!  I made this a little more healthy by skipping the ground beef and bumping up the kidney beans.  I started with two tablespoons of olive oil to saute the veggies and then added an additional two cups of water after adding the macaroni, corn, green beans and cabbage.  It was delicious!

Great, hearty soup.  I substituted ground turkey for the beef and added some spice to heat things up, but it is a perfect base for my favorite fall dinner!

Very good! Made this for my fiance and I last night. It's beginning to cool off here in Chicago. Bowlfuls of steaming soup and warm bread hit the spot! Other than boiling my macaroni separately and adding s&p to taste, I followed Jackie's directions to the letter. I think I'll make a few changes next time, though. For starters, I could barely taste the beef. I'd either omit it alltogether (and make this a vegetarian dish) or add 1.5 to 2 times the amount called for, adjusting the amount of liquids to compensate. If I were short on time, I'd just purchase a bag of coleslaw mix (cabbage only) instead of chopping a head of cabbage myself. It is cheaper to do the latter, however.... I wasn't sure if I was supposed to drain my cans of veggies or not, so I didn't (which worked out fine since it gave me more liquid for the broth). Served with a sprinkling of shredded Italian cheese blend and warm Cottage Dill Bread (S. Beavin), we had a very comforting meal. Since I have a TON leftover, I am freezing it for later. When reheated, I will either add water/bullion, beef broth or tomato sauce depending on whether I want a soup (with broth) or chili-like consistency. Thanks for sharing your recipe with us, Jackie :)

This soup has an amazing warm and hearty taste. I followed the recipe pretty much to the T, except I wasn't fond of the idea of using ground beef so I used some pork instead and cooked it till it was tender enough to pull apart easily. This has an amazing base to it which I think you could use for a multitude of other soups. Will definitely make this one again.

I also added 2 extra cups of water and used the cheese tortillini.  The only bad thing about that is the next day the tortillini sucks up all the juice.

Very good soup. My family really enjoyed it. I added way more water than called for and it was still thick but we like a thick hearty soup. Great way to get your veggies in.

This recipe was great. Due to allergies I had to swap some veggies out and ended up with frozen spinach, frozen green beans and canned peas instead of cabbage, canned beans and canned corn.  I would up the spice anty. I think it tasted like a wonderful vegetable soup and next time I am going to add more spices and come hot pepper.

Okay, I stayed pretty darn close to it as written. Used kale had no cabbage, used more water and a couple cans of beef broth. Added a little Italian sausage with the hamburger, used frozen corn and put a spoonful of homemade pesto in each bowl. Pasta cooked seperate,you don't really even need it. Next time no pasta! Makes enough for an army with the extra liquids. Very easy and so tasty too!

Everyone really enjoyed this. As suggested, I doubled the amount of water. Which made it it more soupy, as written it is more like a chowder.

This is very similar to the Taco Soup II recipe, many of the same ingredients, different spices.  I loved it for the ease and heartiness.  I added a couple of small cans of tomato juice to loosen it up a little.

First off, I am by no means a good cook. Having said that, I can do some simple meals fairly well. Hence, I liked the looks of this recipe. The bottom line is that it came out somewhat blah. I did all the ingredients (save for the cabbage) but still. Not very tasty. And I really wanted to make this recipe a "keeper" Ah well, apparently many others had more success than me...

Great soup.  I used frozen corn and green beans, one can of kidney beans, about 1/3 cup of ditalini and red cabbage (that's what I had on hand).  Soup is healthy and satisfying.  Will definitely make again - my husband liked it very much as well.

Very good recipe, I made few changes; added water (used four cups) and eliminated the kidney beans, because my family does not care for them. This will be my keeper recipe for vegetable beef soup from now on.

This recipe was ok.  I thought it was going to be more like minestrone.  I added some zucchini in as well, and it turned out ok, but I probably will not make this again, in favor of finding a more minestrone-like recipe.  I felt like the corn and the cabbage really did not belong here, but the broth was good.

Tastes like vegetable soup.  It's as thick as in the picture, though.  After following the recipe exactly and trying some, I ended up adding more water to make it soupy, and adding more beef stock and some seasoned salt and louisiana hot sauce to give it a little more flavor.  It wasn't particularly lacking in flavor...it just didn't really stand out either.  All in all, a solid, easy recipe.

yum! This makes a ton and we ate on it for days. I used pintos, and left out the green beans and added extra water for more soupy constistancy. Other than that, I followed the recipe.

Very good and hearty soup, perfect for a cold night.  Served to my kids with cheese toast and they gobbled it up.  I made the day before and added a can of beef broth for extra liquid when I reheated it.  Will make again.

I made this for my family and everyone loved it, especially the kids! I did make a couple variations though - 1 can of kidney beans, and about 2 1/2 extra cups of water. Also added a few small diced potatoes, extra carrots and celery. This will definitely become a winter favorite!

This was really good, but I wanted more flavor so I added some sweet Italian sausage.  I took it out of the casing, crumbled and cooked it and added it to the soup to simmer.  It was great.  This is a great soup to have on a cold winter's night.

This is the best vegetable soup I have ever made.  I added some fresh green beans I steamed and I added more canned tomato than it called for but I had extra vegetables so then I added a little more spice to compensate.  Delicious.  I will make this often!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I really liked this combo although that everyone is right when they it is too thick. I added 4 cups of water and a cup of beef broth. After i made alterations it was great. Oh, also add salt nd pepper cause it needs it.

Loved it! But I have to agree this is more like stew than soup. I add about 2 cups more of water and it still came out like thick. But overall I was satisfied.

Wonderful and easy!  It also made a great meal the next day!  I did add some more liquid to it as it cooked to keep it a little more soupy.

This is a great soup.  The only changes I made were I added 2 bay leaves and some peas since my son loves peas.  I also added barley and omitted the pasta so I wouldn't have to worry about it getting soggy.  YUMMY:)

This was well liked, but I made a few changes based upon what was available in my pantry.  I didn't have ground beef, so I used store bought, frozen Italian meatballs.  I also used fresh green beans, but added them with the carrots.  And I used garbanzo beans instead of kidney.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks.

One of the best soups I've tried off this site!  Thank you for submitting!  I did add an additional cup of water as the mixture was so thick.  The soup still comes out thick and hearty.  I also boiled the noodles separately as I once had a bad experience with the macaroni consumming all of my broth.  One thing I do recommend is to cook the vegetables partially covered on a higher heat level because, as written, they took a lot longer to cook than what was stated in the recipe.  I also used Italian style green beans which lended a nice touch.

This is a great soup recipe. It makes alot and is very tasty. Leftovers are very good also. I thought it was too thick so I added 4 cups of water. Then thickened with a little cornstarch. Also added more spices and boullion for more taste with the increase in water. Overall very good.

My family loves this soup.  I make it thick and vary the spices.

Preparation was a little time consuming due to the vegetables, but it was worth it.  I found that the soup was better the next day.  Also, to reduce the calories and fat grams in this recipe, I used vegetarian ground beef - you don't miss the real thing.
