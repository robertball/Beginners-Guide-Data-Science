I am thrilled to be the first review. This soup was EXCELLENT! I love soup but have always struggled with veggie/tomato/beef based ones. They just never turn out like I remember mom making. Not until this one that is. I made exactly as written and was very pleased. This would be good with some green beans or peas for added nutrition and color too. Very good full bodied flavor and this will be my go to veggie soup.  Thank you so much for sharing!

I should have more carefully read the reviews for this before making it.  I would have either cut WAY down on the tomato paste, or completely omitted it.  I was really excited about this soup as I was making it and then when I added the tomato paste, it turned the nice beef broth into a very strong tomato broth.  If you love a strong tomato flavor to your steak soup, then this is a great recipe for you.  If i make this again, I will definitely omit the paste.  Otherwise, this would be a wonderful recipe.

YUM!!! The broth for this is fantastic! I only had a tsp of Paprika left in my spice jar, so that is all I used. After reading the reviews, I only used 3 oz of tomato paste and that was perfect for my taste. I substituted peas for the corn and it gave it the perfect hint of color! Will be my go to recipe for sure!

This is very good. It taste like beef stew soup. After reading the reviews and some saying the tomato paste was too much I added it a Tablespoon at a time and used about half the can which was enough for my taste. The marjoram and paprika flavor is nice and while the meat was simmering I added 1/2 c. cabernet wine (dry red wine) which enhanced and brought together the flavors. It took a little longer for my meat to cook to tender. I felt no need to thicken this soup further as it is soup and not stew. Flavors developed more after allowing to rest. Delicious and great with a hunk of crusty bread.

This Soup was Outstanding.  My family loved it.  I made it the first time just as stated and it was very good.  Second time and going forward I add 1 C. of Peas, 1/2 C. Red Wine and 1 Tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce this adds great flavor to the Steak.  I also make it more like a soup not thick.
 My family asks for it all the time even in the summer!  Goes great with Rosemary Flatbread.
Thanks for the excellent Recipe!

Very easy and absolutely delicious.  I used top sirloin as another reviewer suggested instead of round steak because I wanted to be sure it was tender.  And since some other reviewers were not fans of the tomato paste I just added a bit of the concentrated tomato paste that comes in a tube until it tasted the way I wanted to and it was perfect.  I will definitely make this again.

I had leftover medium rare Top Sirloin I had marinated and grilled for a party.   The next day I googled "steak soup recipe" and found this one.   A keeper!    Because my steak was already grilled to medium rare I did not put it in with the onions until about a minute before the time came to coat the onion and steak mixture.   I sliced it more thin than cubed so there were more "pieces" in the soup.    I used Vidalia onions, because they are my fave when I can get them in California.    I left out the celery leaves, only because I have family that inexplicably dislikes the the taste of celery.   Otherwise I followed the recipe to a "T."    

Super well received, and the recipe was requested!

When I make it again I might add a little more broth because after refrigerating it was much less "soup like."     But it was still good.    I had some leftover red potatoes I had mashed with 1% low fat milk and Smart Balance and simply added the thick steak soup to them and had the equivalent of a healthy delectable Shepherd's Pie.

Thanks again!

What I love most about AllRecipes is that I can look at several recipes and gather ideas for the perfect dish. In another recipe the author added diced cabbage. I tweaked that in this recipe to adding kale, for both color and nutrition. I used two small cans (5.5 oz) of V8 juice and skipped the tomato Paste altogether. Not a fan Of tomoto-ey things. Lastly, I replaced the potatoes with barley because of the nutritional benefits it brings. Very yummy.

Really good. Using top sirloin insures the beef to be more tender than top round. Putting in crockpot is great.

Anxious to try this on the advice of a friend, I easily found this soup one of the best I've tried from AR! Echoing many of the reviews, I think it's safe to use as much/little tomato paste as you deem necessary. Since I added a 28 oz can of whole tomatoes (to which I gave a rough chop), I only added 2-3 Tbsp tomato paste since I didn't want to overpower the rest of the soup. I doubled the broth (approximately 9 c total liquid) and used a mix of both beef and chicken bases to taste dissolved in water. I also added about 1/2 c red wine (pinot noir) to the broth while it simmered, as well as a few good sloshes of worchestershire when browning the meat (used top sirloin and glad I did, although I simmered close to an hour to get the desired tenderness I wanted). Omitted the corn and subbed some diced cabbage instead. Needed to use up some sliced button mushrooms, so I sauteed them as I usually do and tossed them in right before serving. Followed recommended spice measurements, but as a garlic lover, I added a couple cloves of sliced garlic to the simmering broth, as well as some garlic powder while the entire soup simmered the final minutes. Smelled delicious and was certainly a welcome dinner on this frigid night. Served with crescent rolls, but next time, a good hunk of crusty bread would be the winning accompaniment for me. Will absolutely make this again!

Made this recipe the first time without adding the tomato sauce and it was perfect, but the second time we tried it with the sauce and didn't care for it as much. The sauce gave it a thicker consistency like stew and My family preferred it more of a broth.

Delicious!!! That's all i gotta say! A family of 4 destroyed a serving size of 8 in just minutes!! I followed the recipe pretty much the way it was written with the exception that i didn't use yukon but idaho potatoes......it tasted just as good (i think?)  I also didn't use the marjoram.....does that spice really make a big difference? Thanks for this recipe!! I will be using it again for sure!!

I used left over prime rib roast, cubed, and this was delicious.  Next time though, I will cut the tomato paste down as I felt it over-powered all of the other rich flavors.  Served this with Beer Bread and hubby loved it!

I actually used leftover stew that I had in the freezer for the meat in this soup (stew meat, carrots, onions), added the rest of the ingredients, used russet potatoes and left the skin on, also added some baby peas at the end. Instead of canned or carton of beef broth, I used Knorr consentrated beef stock (they look like little jellied masses). This soup was so flavorful and full of meat and veggies. I loved it and so did my family. I also added 14oz of crushed tomatoes instead of the paste. This was a great way for me to use leftovers. Thanks!

easy recipe and my large family loved it.  I doubled it but only used 1 can of tomato paste.  I also cooked it in a crock pot after browning the meat.  This one is saved in my recipe box!

I got rave reviews for this recipe. Didn't change a thing except for throwing in some green beans. This is going to be a favorite winter soup.

I made this soup as written, except for adding the tomato paste a tablespoon at a time. This was incredibly filling and very tasty served with a crusty sourdough bread. My husband and I both enjoyed it.

I made this for dinner tonight and I had to force myself to stop eating it! I tasted the broth after I added just over half of the can of tomato paste and that was enough for my taste. It was very good, but it seemed that it could have used something else. Many reviewers added red wine, but I rarely ever have wine in the house, so I opted for a couple tablespoons of grape jam. ( I came across that idea from another recipe a while ago) For me, that rounded out the flavors and I absolutely loved it. It does leave a little burn on the tongue afterwards, probably from the paprika, but a good burn! I was getting a little worried at first because it seemed the smell of marjoram was overpowering, but was perfect in the end.

I made a few minor changes, but only because I didn't have any majoram or tomato paste. Instead I used basil and a can of diced tomatoes. I also added some garlic. It was a wonderful soup, and one that I will make over and over because it was a hit with my family.

This soup is awesome.  I cooked meat mixture (london broil) much longer than recipe states, since it was a rainy Saturday afternoon - 1.5 hours, and added more potatoes and carrots, but otherwise followed recipe.  Great, hearty, rich soup.

This was wonderful!  I didn't have any Marjoram so I skipped that.  I added some Wildtree Ranchers Steak rub (about a tablespoon) to the flour mixture.  Instead of using a different pot, I just started pouring the water and beef broth on top of the steak, added all the veggies and let it cook for an hour.  I didn't peel the potatoes.  It was delicious!!

Very tasty and hearty soup.  I added garlic and more liquid, reduced the tomatoe paste as some suggested and also added Hungarian  "goulash cream" to spice it up a bit . Also works well In the crock pot. I prefer to use green beans to corn.

Really good, but the cook time was way off for me.  I used well trimmed beef stew meat for the steak.  It took about 1 hour of simmering to get it where I wanted to start.  Next time I will add more onion and less meat, it was super meaty.  The biggest time problem came when I added the vegetables.  I used red potatoes, which have a similar texture to yukon golds, and I cut the celery amount about in half because celery has a tendency to overpower flavors.  I think it took a good hour and a half at least to get my potatoes and carrots tender.  I know this all depends on the size of slices/dices you use, but I think I went pretty small on my potato doce and carrot slices and it still took forever.  The finished product needed a good amount of extra salt and garlic salt to get back to the right flavor.  Potatoes and carrots really suck a lot of salt out of a dish.  Since I had to simmer for so long to get the vegetables cooked, I lost about half of my liquid.  What I ended up with was a very concentrated stew, not a soup.  Still very good, just needs a little more beef broth up front if you want a soup consistency or super small diced vegetables to cook faster.  Since the tomato paste topic is much discussed on this recipe, I used all but about 2 T. of my can of tomato paste and I din't find it too tomatoes, but I may add a can of diced tomatoes next time for more liquid and for those tomato chunks that I personally like in a veggie soup.

This is really good. I used left over tri tip for the meat. I put the cooked meat in the pot towards the end of the 10 minute onion and butter sauté, before adding the flour mixture. Cooked all that for three minutes, then followed the rest of the recipe. But I didn't have tomato paste, so I slowly cooked down some canned tomato sauce until it had the consistency of tomato paste. And I had a can of green beans, so I threw the drained green beans in at the end just to heat. My husband is constantly making tri tip...now I have a tasty recipe for the left overs!

It was a little bland, which I'd read more of the reviews before I made it.  Next time I will add some worchestershire sauce to give it a little more flavour.

This was good, hubby loved it-I was kind of luke warm.  I followed recipe except for the tomato paste (didn't have any) and corn (don't care for it)  I have other vegetable soups and beef stew recipes I prefer over this one- sorry.

I would definitely make this again! It was easy and had great flavor. I did use smaller Yukon gold potatoes and left the skin on. I cut them into small chunks. It was easier than peeling the potatoes  and gave the soup a rustic feel.

Excellent recipe! Followed notes from others and added green beans, peas, tomatoes, garlic, 1/2 cup red wine, some worcestershire, and limited the tomato paste to three tablespoons.

This was very tasty...although after reading reviews, I did make these changes:  eliminated the tomato paste and substituted a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes.  Also added 2 additional cups of beef broth and a tablespoon of Worcestershire Sauce...(that really kicked it up a notch!)  I like a thick soup except for beef vegetable soups...much prefer a brothy soup.

I love this recipe! I had expensive steak left over. I don’t like left over steak cooked or warmed but this was the exception. I did make some minor adjustments to the recipe after reading the reviews.  I browned the onions as directed for 10 minutes but only braised the left over steak for a minute or 2. Also, because the meat was cooked, I brought it to a boil and added the veggies. I only cooked veggies and meat for 20 minutes. Also did not use flour and no water - just beef stock. I did a little paste but not 6 ounces.  hubby who is a little fussy liked it too

My family loved this soup! I used 6 cups of Pacific organic mushroom broth instead of beef broth & water because that's what I had on hand.  I also added zucchini.  Since I love veggies I will probably throw in peas or green beans next time too.  The broth and meat were fantastic and came together quickly.  I will be making this again and again!

Made as instructed. Will NEVER make it again. My sweet husband, who is deeply aware of the time I put into cooking and ALWAYS shows the respect of eating his dinner, could  not finish his dinner and then quietly asked me "Do I have to take it for lunch tomorrow?? :( " 

It is VERY tomato (and acid) rich. And I say this as someone who makes tomato-based dishes frequently. 

It's just not cohesive somehow.  Our plan for the remainder, as I HATE to waste food, is to feed it to the dogs and even the chickens so that I haven't wasted so very much food. 

I've NEVER been so moved, positively or negatively, to leave a review. It's just very disappointing. Even if you like tomato dishes (we do!!!) this one falls short. IF it would let me leave LESS THAN ONE STAR, I would. :(

Glad I read the reviews.  Cut back on tomato paste, added red wine, used the sirloin.  I also browned the potatoes in separate frying pan in some oil and butter and also the carrots and celery.  Not a fan of boiled veggies in a soup.  Went for the crusty bread.  All in all a winner for a snowy night!

Yum! I did make some changes to the recipe. I used stew meat instead of steak and tossed it with the flour/spice mixture before browning. I also added a can of drained diced tomatoes and some frozen okra to the veggie mixture and cooked the veggies for about 40 minutes instead of 20. I found that using a little less of the tomato paste was preferable as well. Probably used about 4.5 oz. My husband and I devoured it for dinner tonight. Delicious! I'll definitely be making again.

I absolutely love this recipe and I have made it several times. Instead of potatoes I sub the green giant cauliflower and sweet potato mix to reduce carbs and add additional nutrition. The sweet potato adds just a hint of sweetness and the cauliflower is a fantastic substitute for potato. I keep this recipe close by all the time.

Y'all had me at "steak". I would use sirloin for a guarantee of meat tenderness.  It may cut cooking time, too. For me, I would adult it up a little by substituting some red wine or sherry for the liquid. To taste, of course, but no more than 1/4 of the liquid. A nice forgiving recipe that is great for a cold night.

I was given two moose steaks and was looking for a recipe to use them in, and this fit the bill perfectly.  I doubled the recipe and added a turnip cubed.  Other than that, I followed it as written.  The soup was delicious.  I will be making this again!

I will totes make this again. I didn't have majoram so i used some thyme instead. Left out the tomato paste as suggested by others. I added garlic powder, salt, and pepper. I used frozen corn instead of the canned too. I let the  soup cook much longer too, before and after adding the veggies.

A great recipe!! I made this with a good homemade beef bone stock and it was wonderful. A perfect cold weather dish that has found a home on my menu. The recipe is perfect as is, I just changed it a bit for thickness. Enjoy!!!!!!!

This was pretty good. Maybe with a better cut of meat it could be "Steak Soup", it tasted more like beef stew.

Dinty Moore!  Frankly, my mom was a terrible cook.  As a kid I remember being so excited when Dinty Moore stew was for dinner--because mom couldn't mess it up.  She'd add a can of corn, and that was the best!  I found this to be the soup version of this childhood memory.  I used sirloin instead of top round and added 11 oz of V-8 in stead of tomato paste -- because my husband hates tomatoes.  He loved it; I found it somewhat pedestrian but memory evoking.  Comfort food, for sure!  I'd make it again.

Great recipe! Couple of things: Didn't have beef broth so I threw in a package of french onion soup mix, forgot the bay leaf (oops), nor did I have tomato paste. I replaced that with about a cup of spaghetti sauce. Other than adding a little extra pepper and decreasing the salt (low sodium diet here), that's it. My poor son and his braces loved it since everything was so tender but still had great texture. It was such a relief for us and our taste buds!

Believe the reviews.  This is incredible.  I've been looking for a recipe like this for years.  Thanks to whomever shared it.  I used 1 cup red wine for the half the water and no tomato paste.  My husband and I both love this. It will be a go-to for sure.

This is excellent. My entire family loved it and all said to make this again. Just a few changes I ran out of parsley so I did not ad it. I used no salt added beef broth. I like this better as I find broth in general have way to much sodium. I did add a little bit of sea salt. Instead of all purpose flour I used spelt flour and it was delicious.
It was cooked in a slow cooker. Great recipe and will make it again.

Delish! I used leftover burgundy peppercorn steak from the grill. The veggies were a little too crisp so I would let it cook longer than the 20 minutes suggested. Great soup!

I had some things to use up from the freezer, (a tri-tip sirloin, half a bag of mixed veg (corn, beans, peas, carrots) and swiss chard) and found this recipe.  Instead of using an additional pan for browning the meat I used my big enamel coated cast iron dutch oven and browned the meat and made the soup all in the same pan.  Instead of marjoram I used rosemary and thyme, just my preference.  I still added the celery and potatoes along with my frozen vegetables.  There are reviews here saying the tomato paste was too much, but I found it perfect.  It is definitely very "tomatoey".  Think of the tomato soup we all eat with a grilled cheese sandwich! That is the level of tomato flavor and texture of the broth which I find very appealing.  Next time I'll salt & pepper the meat when browning. Even though the flour is seasoned, the meat itself seemed like it needed more salt.  All in all this is an awesome soup, very satisfying and warm in the tummy.  I'll be making this often.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  I read all 59 reviews and even opted for the full can of tomato paste ...... all for nothing!!!  It must have been the Marjoram.

very good flavor, I think the key is adding the tomato to taste.   We like tomato so the full amount was fine with us.  I'm looking forward to trying some of the others suggested variations like adding red wine.

I'm not a big soup lover but this is something I will make again. It was awesome! Thanks to the reviewers' advice on tomato paste. Used leftover 1 lb grilled steak seasoned with Montreal steak seasoning--was too tough to eat as is--cheap steak. Used 1/3 can of tomato SAUCE and added 1 tsp. brown sugar for a little sweetness. For stock, used Better Than Bouillion Beef Base for the 1st time. The dark gooey stuff was unappetizing to look at, but was good in the soup. Cooked everything in a dutch oven from start to finish.

Wow, I LOVED this soup.  Thank you so much for sharing!  I did do a few things different....not because of taste but because I wanted, health wise, more bang for my buck (and also had these things in the refrigerator to use up).  I added sweet potatoes, peas, and about a half cup of shredded cabbage (for color and vitamins) and also put in a handful of Quinoa, which I do with almost all my soups! Just adjust other ingredients to  make room. I also put about 1/8 cup of the tomato paste (I freeze mine and use in soups).  The next day it was even better...more like a stew/soup and very tasty (if you prefer more broth, just add it)!  You have a winner here and I thank you so much!

Great soup!  My picky 1,3 and 5yo loved it.  I only used 3oz tomato paste but otherwise made as is.  I'd sub 1/2c red wine for 1/2c of the water next time.

I let my soup simmer all afternoon and the steak was quite tender and delicious.  However, the soup never thickened.  3 T of flour is just not enough for this much soup.  I ended up making a roux with 6 T butter and 6 T flour and adding it to soup.  If I make this soup again, I will omit the tomato paste as well.

This soup was VERY good! I used vegetables that I had on hand. And instead of an entire 6 oz can of tomato paste, I used half a can of tomato sauce and a tablespoon of tomato sauce, cause it's what I had. It turned out fantastic!

Super Easy. I read reviews first and tweaked it a bit. Only used half can of tomato paste. Omited the corn. Added peas. I also used baby red potatoes with the skin on instead of yellow potatoes because that's what I had. I let my soup cook for an hour after all the ingredients were in the pot. Made a side of biscuits. I put the biscuit in the bottle of each bowl then added the soup. Delicious!!! Will make again.

It was super delicious, but the cut of meat was still somewhat tough after an hour and a half of simmering. Next time I might use a fattier steak cut since the top round was so lean, or I’ll use meat tenderizer. Also, 3 tbsp of tomato paste was perfect for us. I didn’t want to risk using more and it turn out to be too much. I made the recipe exactly besides the extra 3 tbsp of tomato paste.

I made this almost to the letter. Didn’t have any potatoes in the house.  Very tasty!  The flavor was spot on.  I had a problem with the celery and carrots still being a bit too crunchy. Next time, I will add them in right after I add the meat. The broth was a little thicker than regular soup stock but not as thick as a stew.  Excellent!  Hubby said this can go on the repeat list.

I read the reviews first so I decided to use caution with the tomato paste. I added half of the 6 ounce can only, so approximately 3 ounces. That amount enhanced the flavor of the soup without an overpowering  tomato taste. I may try the recipe again and see what happens if I add the called for 6 ounces. It seems though it would make the soup more of a Tomato Steak soup if the full amount was used. All in all, I felt the soup was tasty, but a bit bland so I added a cup of left over beef gravy I had in the fridge. The gravy really added a nice hearty taste to the soup, everyone who tried it enjoyed it. I also tossed in a cup of previously sauteed sliced fresh mushrooms.

Like others I reduced the tomato past by half.  Turned out good, a nice basic beef stew.

So yummy! I have made it twice now in just one month! I am a soup person hubby is not so much but he requested this the second time! I made just a few changes number one garlic add garlic! I used double potatoes and no corn or carrots cause hubby don't like! I also do not have much spices like these on hand so I used what I had and it worked great!  I think this is a perfect soup so hardy and easy to make! I can not wait to have family over to try this one!

I would definitely make this again.  We were given a couple of new york strip steaks that we knew weren't going to be tender, SO I found this amazing recipe and used the steaks like round steak.  The soup tasted amazing, I didn't have marjoram so I used an Italian seasoning blend.

My family & I loved this hearty soup.  It had just the right beef/tomato balance.  I left out the parsley & celery leaves just because I didn't have them on hand. I also added a few more ounce of corn. Delicious!

I made this soup in an instant pot and it worked well. The only inadvertent change I made was I added too many potatoes. It was a little bland (probably the extra potatoes) and had a LOT of celery for our family’s taste. I would suggest that you not use the bouillon cubes and hot water for the beef broth. I think this is a recipe that requires high quality beef stock for flavor. I probably will make it again with the right amount of potatoes, half the celery, quality beef stock, and less tomato paste, but that’s just our family’s taste.

Made according to recipe with left over prime rib roast.  Added some  ditalini pasta and used all beef broth.  Thought it was a good broth base.  It's a soup with endless options for veggies of your choice.

Great flavor.  I used lean stew meat to decrease the trimming time on the meat.  I did not add the corn as some of the family are not fans.  Will make this again.

Very tasty and easy soup to prepare. As with many other reviews I cut back on the amount of the tomato paste and I myself left out the potato and am not a fan of  marjoram. Rather than using 2 different pots for cooking, I browned the steak first, then sauteed the rest of the veggies in the pot. I added the tomato paste, broth and a bit of salt and pepper to the mix. Let the flavors meld and served the soup with grilled cheese sandwiches.

Fantastic!  Everyone loved it. Used used suggestions from comments: splash of Worcestershire sauce to the meat, I used a round roast, 1/2 red wine while simmering and cut tomato paste down to about 3oz, but added petite diced tomatoes. I also added green beans. The meat was tender and the soup very savory. Thank you for the great recipe!

Perfect taste following recipe exactly. Very rare that I don’t have to doctor a recipe at least a little.  Good balance of flavors. This will become a classic in our house. Can foresee making a batch and freezing it for quick yummy meals.

It’s like beef stew soup! Really good.  I went by the reviews and only used about a spoonful of tomato paste and I am glad, that was enough and it didn’t overtake the flavor.  This is now in my cold weather dinner rotation :)

Was a delicious base - coated the steak in the flour and shook it up before browning it,  I added in some red wine for deglazing and some extra potatoes. Tastes even better the next day!

This soup was amazing...only changes I made were to add more of each vegetable then 64oz of beef broth instead of 4 cups because of the comments on the tomato paste being too much . The tomato paste was just right for this amount of  broth and it was really really delicious!

I love soup! I really was expecting this to be great, but I didn’t feel the flavor was very good. Too much Paprika. I added some milk and sour cream to take the bite, not spicy bite, but that tomato paste, paprika sting out of it. It was a thousand times better. I also added wine and cornstarch to thicken it a little bit. Probably won’t make it again. Sorry!

Good served as soon as done. Better next day. Used top sirloin. I'm definitely reducing tomato paste to 3 oz. or maybe use canned petite tomato instead. I'll be making this again and again

Excellent. I did everything as written only I halved the tomato paste and added a tiny bit of red wine. Delish!

Family loved it. I followed other reviewers and used only half the tomato paste. I also added some green beans for some extra veggies. Served with cornbread and it was delicious.

Totally awesome soup!  Working on a 2nd batch for Church Soup Sale.  I did find that I had to add more beef broth and water.  I also used less tomato paste as others have mentioned.

I HAVE a beef stew recipe with a rich "beefy"broth that I love. This was a delicious tomato variation. I used the whole 6oz can of tomato paste and loved the  results. I would definitely make it again!

I made this with venison and it turned out great.  Should feed the guys at deer camp well!  I added a couple jalapeños for some kick and a can of green beans but otherwise stuck to the recipe.

I've made this twice now and it's perfect for cool, rainy, grey days, It's filling and tasty. I added a cup and a half of mushrooms, substituted Baja Gold salt for the table salt and added a teaspoon of kitchen bouquet. It came out perfectly delicious!

Love this soup..I used just a little concentrated tomato paste, omitted the corn(didn't have any) and split the potato between yukon gold and sweet potato....The sweet potato added a nice balance to the flavor

OMG.  This is SO good!  I omitted a few things and made some subs based on what I had on hand.  First, I used grassfed and finished beef tips (1 pound).  I used a butter substitute and omitted the oil.  I didn't have celery, celery leaf, potatoes or marjoram.  I used gluten-free flour.  The paprika makes this soup.  It's amazing!  I will be making it again very soon and adding more veggies.

This is  yummy! I did some things different! I added homegrown tomatoes, garlic and I didn't have marjoram so I  used Italian seasoning. But, overall this is outstanding!

I used leftover beef tenderloin steaks with this recipe and it turned out wonderfully; I added chopped mushrooms as well. The only criticism I have is it didn't make a big enough batch for the four of us, so next time I'll double it.

Wonderful soup!  Hubs raved over this and that is a rarity with soups for him.  Think it's the beefiness and richness of this soup he liked.  I did tweak using an 8oz can of tomato sauce and a few tablespoons of concentrated tomato paste ( that comes in a tube) for the can of tomato paste.  I also added some garlic , onion,  powders to the mix.  Used a bag of frozen soup veggies in place of the fresh to make this a breeze.  Looking forward to the leftovers today.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a good hearty soup and I would make it again.  Like most reviewers I cut the tomato paste by half and honestly I think it could be omitted entirely. A splash of V8 juice would probably work well and would enhance the celery of you wanted to use less chopped celery. 
I would also sauté a couple
cloves of minced garlic with the steak and onions - it's a tad "blah", even with using all the seasonings and quantities called for. My family did enjoy it and we're looking forward to the leftovers!

It's okay, but I would boil the meat longer. The flavor is good though. The tomato paste really helped. I added more pepper and recommend adding some garlic powder.

I loved it! Easy to make and prep, and it tasted AWESOME. Pretty much everything you could want/hope for in a beef soup/stew. I even tripled the recipe, and even though my pot was too small, and my ratios of beef broth to water were not quite the same, it turned out great. Love it.

I didn't make any changes to this other then adding thyme instead of marjoram which I didn't have. I also had to cook the beef over an hour to get it tender since it was some stir fry beef I've had sitting in the freezer forever. I read a lot of reviews on this site when I'm looking at different recipes and cannot believe how many people right off the bat change a recipe and then rate it. Awful.
Anyhow, my husband really liked this and while I did too I thought it could use something for more flavor. I also would use at least 2 cups of vegetables next time since there was a lot of broth.
But I will for sure make this again.
Thanks.

This recipe is a definite keeper. I used sirloin instead of round steak because that's what I had on hand.  My husband is already talking about making it again soon.  The only thing I would suggest is to decrease the salt, or eliminate it all together.  The sodium from the broth will be plenty.  Other than that, this recipe creates a real comfort food.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I followed the recipe exactly as written except I omitted the tomato paste and added 1T Worcestershire sauce. Unfortunately, 30 minutes was not nearly long enough for the vegetables to cook. I was so disappointed, as I served it to guests. The flavor and appearance were great. Next time everything will go in to simmer together for the entire time.

I used salt-free tomato paste, low salt beef broth, salt free corn and half the salt that's recommended. It tastes better because the other flavors can come out.  Besides, it's healthier for us. #no bloating #not thirsty

I thought it was pretty good, but it was missing some
"punch", so I added 2 tsp worcestershire sauce, another half tablespoon of paprika and 2 chicken stock bouillon cubes.
I had to add a little more water due to adding the bouillon cubes.

I followed the recipe EXCEPT I added 1/2 cup cabernet when the meat was simmering.  This was a suggestion from another review.  I also added fresh green peas and frozen peas.  I did not add the tomato paste as I loved the hearty flavor the cabernet added to the broth.  I will make this again.

You just can't go wrong with this recipe.  We used leftover steak (Leftover steak! I KNOW!  But yeah, we had some.) and cut up baked potatoes.  Scrumptious!  Don't leave out the corn, and cut it from the cob, if you can.

Not bad! I added more vegetables than the recipe called for and did it in my slow cooker on high for five hours. The meat was very tender and the stew is tasty. I love using smoked paprika,the one is use is from Spain and is great in soups and stews.

Good soup. I used only half the can of tomato paste and that was the right amount for my taste. It gave the soup more flavor without being overpowering. Also used sirloin steak and peas in lieu of corn. At the end of cooking, this soup was stew like consistency. That would have been fine if this was going to be an entree, but tonight I am having it as 1st course. So, added more beef broth and more water to thin it out.

I had some already cook london broil. So I simmer the beef in stock and red wine till tender. In another pot I  sauteed the onion in the oil and butter mixture. Then added the flour. The rest of it was as the recipes states. It was delicious, and my husband loved it. I will definitely be making this again. I did cut the amount of tomato paste in half.

This turned out fantastic and I will make it often. I replaced the water with Merlot though and added about a 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to give it some kick. Wonderful!

Made using cross rib steaks I had on hand. Did not have tomato paste, so squirted in a wee bit of ketchup and BBQ sauce. I also added a dash of worcestshire sauce. This soup was awesome!! Beef was sooo tender. I will definitely be making again!! Thanks for the recipe.

Didn't have broth so I put the meat in some water on the slow cooker. Few hours later lest the marjoram, I have something that could very well be better than my Moms. Still like a lil ketchup with mine though, just a topper. Should be even better tomorrow.

Had no depth of flavor. Did a lot of tweaking. Added some beef bullion, Worcestershire sauce and more tomato paste. Next time I will add some Cabernet Sauvignon.

This is really good but more like a stew.  For the beef broth I used 4 beef bouillon cubes boiled in hot water.   I didn't see in the directions where I was supposed to use 2 cups water so I didn't use the water.  It turned out super thick and creamy without using the water.  Next time I will use 5 cups of bouillon and 1 cup water.  The flavor was awesome.  I also only used 1 Tbs. of tomato paste. Not so sure if it is really needed.  I didn't have celery leaves so used 1/2 tsp. celery salt.

I made this again today!  My son especially  adores this soup as do I!  Thank you for submitting the recipe,  I make some very minor tweaks to this according to our tastes.  I add a slash or worcshesire sauce, 1/2 instead of 1/4 teaspoon  of the fine dusty kinda of black pepper and 1+1/2  tablespoons of tomato paste.  I always add in all the veggies required plus more fresh or frozen depending on what t have.   Today I useda KC strip steak I had and boy oh boy it knocked this out of the park!  I've used sirloin as well which was very good!  One time I cut up and used leftover eye round roast and although I still loved the basic recipe I didn't care fore that cut of meat in  this soup so I just picked the meat out lol.!  Using STEAK  is a MUST in this recipe imho and makes a huge difference!!!  I always leave the soup on the brothy side as I always cook ditalini pasta seperatly add that to our bowls and top with soup and freshly grated parm. cheese!  It's a lovely thing haha. Served with crusty bread.  Nobody but that sprinkle of parm and the bread need to be invited to the party!  Oh I did add 1 large clove of minced garlic...cause like I don't think I make anything with out garlic!  Ha!

I made this as close to the recipe as I could depending on what I had in the cupboard and it was really good! I did not have tomato paste or corn, but I did add mushrooms, and I had to use chicken broth instead of beef broth. I cut the recipe down to 2/3 and it was pretty right on! I think the celery leaves was genius and will incorporate that into other recipes. This will be in the things-I-make-on- weekends-for-lunches-the-rest-of-the-week rotation!

I made changes based on other reviews.  I coated the meat and browned them, cooked in my Breville crockpot that also Sears and can pressure cook if I need to speed things up a bit, so everything was done in one pot.  I did not add any tomatoe paste or tomatoes, but added barley       Later put in 3 freezer bags for other meals and froze.  Had one just last night Equally as good   Next one I take out I will make as a pot pie  it's so thick!  Thanks for the tips and recipe. Love Allrecipes site

This stew was positively delicious. I didn't have tomato paste on hand, so I substituted a can of diced tomatoes, and it turned out fabulous. Will definitely make again, with no changes to the recipe.

Delicious. I did not prep the entire ingredients before browning the onions and beef. A mistake on my part. I was really rushed. Consequently, I didn't cook it as long as suggested, but it was still very good. Can't wait to taste the leftovers.

This was wonderful!  I made a double batch on this cold winter day, to have extra to freeze.  I did cut the tomato paste in half and let it simmer a couple of hours...otherwise I just followed the directions and am very pleased!  My husband really enjoyed it also!!

I used ground meat. I subbed 1/2 amount of cayenne for paprika.  I used shredded Italian cheese to sprinkle on top.

Found this to be good. My wife said it tasted like a very good veggie soup base with some sirloin added. My picky 6 year old even liked it. Maybe I didn't add enough or maybe too much tomato paste but I found it to be good, it did not wow me. I will def try again though.

This recipe has replaced my mother's beef stew recipe.  It is richer and more flavorful.  But don't tell my mom.

Love this recipe. I started early, so I slow cooked the soup. I made a small dark roux first. Then, I added some leftover rib eye steak and the onion (cut in large pieces). I added two cups cold water, then the hot broth (I made it with 6 bullion cubes and 6 cups hot water). After this came to a boil for a few minutes, I added the veggies, also in large chunks. Kept the listed seasonings but added a little pinch of roasted garlic, sage,  and smoked paprika seasonings.  After boil about 10 minutes, I cooked on lowest fire for 2 hours. Since I had some Louisiana oysters, I added about 2 dozen oysters and the oyster liquid. This brought the soup to a 5 star soup!! Thanks.

Perfect. This is a well balanced soup. It didn't take much prep, for me. I used ketchup instead of tomato paste and added seasoning salt, for a kick, because thought it was a bit bland, but still perfect recipe I'd recommend to anyone.

I did quite a bit of tweeking with this recipe, most of the seasonings I did not have on hand so instead of the fresh parsley, celery leaves, bay leaf and marjoram I used 1 tsp of basil, 1 tsp of oregano and 1 tsp of thyme. I did add the full can of tomato paste but next time I will either omit it or use half. I added a 1/2 cup of water mixed with a package of brown gravy to offset the over powering tomato taste. I'm thinking maybe I might use a can of stewed tomatoes next time to give it a mild tomato taste. I also added a pack of mushrooms, cleaned and sliced, it was a great addition to the soup.

I have made this soup many times. I’m reading the reviews, I added about 3 tablespoons tomato paste.   I also add 1/2 c cab sav (in place of some water), sliced mushrooms and some fresh green beans. Delicious!

Tried the recipe once again and it turned out better the second time around. I did let it cook longer and the soup flavor developed after an hour or so. I used stewed tomatoes also instead of the tomato paste. Great flavor

I LOVE this soup! It's the best I've ever made. I used vegetable stock because I had no beef broth. I added Better Than Bouillon to it for more flavor. I used fresh off the cob corn, green beans, peas, carrots, great northern beans, and quinoa. (no potatoes). I will make this again. It was wonderful to have a healthy lunch at work every day last week. Yummy

Delicious!  I agree with the other reviews, this was a hearty soup with a tasty broth.  I heeded the advise of others and cut down on the tomato paste by half.  I recommend this recipe.

I have NEVER made a good beef vegetable soup until now!  Great recipe. I did follow the advice of others and did not add the tomato paste.  Had some V-8 and added about 1/4-1/2 c. Just enough tomato flavor.

This soup is easy and delicous! After reading the reviews I decided to make a few changes and it came out perfectly. For starters, I only used one pot. Once the meat and onions were done, I added the flour/spice combination cooking it as directed. Then I deglazed the pot with 1 cup of red wine and a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. Once that cooked down I added the liquids. i reducing the water by half because I wanted a thick stew type outcome. Served it with a crusty sour dough bread. Yum! The whole family loved it.  I can't wait to make this again.

This was a great recipe. I doubled the recipe but only used one can of tomato paste. I wouldn't eliminate it though because it sure did make the broth better and thicker. I added a little Worcestershire, which makes everything better! The recipe was weird because it measured everything instead of saying one onion. I used tenderized round steak because it has more flavor. It was super tender. Super picky 12 year old daughter loved it!

The best part of Allrecipes (besides the recipes of course!) are the reviews. I needed a protein heavy dish for a freezing cold night and this truly fit the bill.  I didn't pay close enough attention when I made my shopping list, so I ended up buying beef stew meat (still have ready many conflicting comments of just what that might be made up of)  I heeded the advice of several reviews and used less than the 6 oz. can of tomato paste and that was with 3 pounds of meat.  I added a lot of Worcestershire sauce and used beef broth and a seasoned chicken broth in lieu of the water. I didn't have carrots and family doesn't care for celery, so I used a bit of celery leaves and some shredded baby spinach.  It came out great and so much better the next day for lunch!
It's probably worth it to make the day before you plan on eating and simply reheat.  Finally, I would definitely use a more tender cut of meat although as it was it was outstanding!

Delicious soup! I followed the recipe except left out the potatoes as I don't like potatoes in a beef soup. Very nice flavor. I brought about half over to my neighbor and she called me right away and said it was so good she wants the recipe. Thanks FoodieFamily4.

This is a great base recipe. I tweak it a little each time depending on the season. Add white beans sometimes and rice or pasta other times. I always use V8 instead of water and add hot pepper flakes. Thanks for a great start!

Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe! I love the rich tasting broth and am so glad to find an alternative method for adding the flour; flouring tiny meat pieces was never easy for me. I did change a few things like adding frozen peas at the end, omitting the tomato paste and using diced tomatoes with their juice instead and omitting the corn altogether.

I love this recipe, its easy to follow and has simple ingredients. I like that you can add almost any vegetables. It's a hearty stew and I will be making it in the winter.

I agree with the majority of the reviews. 3 tbsp tomato paste is plenty. Also added 3/4 cup wine  and peas. May add mor broth next time. I like more liquid

This is a very good recipe and an absolute keeper. I unfortunately could not add the corn, since my husband does not like it, but next time will add peas as someone suggested. This recipe is just perfect as is. I may have added a bit extra potatoes and carrots which made it a bit thick. At the moment I only had boneless rib meat and it was perfect!

Awesome!!! A must try soup. Didn't have paprika, so I substituted it with chili powder. First time making and OMG how delicious. Read the reviews and agree 3oz tomato paste and next day is even better than the first. Enjoy.

Not bad, overall. I agree with other reviewers that the better quality meat you use, the better this recipe will be. I used discount meat and it shows in the consistency. Don't be afraid of using heat when you brown the meat. And my carrots weren't cooked all the way through so make sure you cut them finely enough or steam them beforehand. Adding wine was a good choice! Overall, this is a quality recipe.

Made as written, very tasty.  Had to season a little, to taste, once done.  Next time I might try 1/2 the tomato paste as others have suggested.  I always make the recipe, as written the first time.  Less tomato paste may = less richness in the broth... we'll see.  The addition of red wine may compensate.  Thank-you "FoodieFamily4" for the recipe :)

This is the BOMB. Of course I never follow a recipe to the T. I used Chuck steak I prefer it for the flavor in soups and stews. I used 8cups of water with one package of aujus for the broth. I used the amount of tomato sauce because of using the chuck steak I wanted the tomato sauce to tenderize the steak. I simmered the steak with the spices, broth diced tomato's & sauce for 1 hour. Then added vegetables put in oven at 250 until we was ready for dinner. Added 1/4tsp of baking soda to reduce the tomato. Served over mashed potato's.

This soup was amazing!  I made it with leftover marinated tri tip roast from trader joes. It's like Campbell's chunky steak soup, except actually good and fresh, with veggies cooked just right.  We could not get enough of it.

This soup is delicious. I used stew meat instead of round steak and added a clove of chopped garlic and a teaspoon of beef bouillon granules. Other reviewers thought the tomato paste was a little overwhelming but I liked the zing it gave the soup. My husband thought it was the best beef soup ever. I will definitely make this again.

I thought this was VERY good.  After reading the reviews I made a few changes...I added a T of Worcestershire sauce to the meat when it was cooking and about 1/3 cup of red wine when I added the broth.  I cut the paste down to 3 ounces but I'm not sure I'd mind it with the whole 6 ounces called for.  I also used sirloin instead of round steak and cooked it longer than the recipe states to ensure it was tender.  I tasted it as it was cooking and was afraid it wasn't going to be very flavorful but it was and the flavors all went together very well.  I think the wine added a lot.  Will definitely be making this again.

I really liked this recipe and especially the way you didn't have to coat the meat with flour before you browned it.  That is such a yucky messy step in recipes I avoid it.  I didn't have majoram or bay leaves so I used some spices I had in the cabinet and dried parsley.  Turned out fine.

This was very good! I threw the vegetables in when I added the steak to the soup, which worked well and saved a step.  While I will make this again, I think it is missing some kind of spice, though I am not sure what...

Tastes a lot like beef stew, only better.  I combined step 3 into step 2 to save time, and I'm glad I did.  The veggies wouldn't have cooked in the amount of time suggested in step 3.  I also omitted corn, because I don't care for corn in soups.  Very flavorful soup with tender meat.  Thumbs up from the adults and kids in our home.

I made this yesterday . My 16 y.o. Daughter said to me, Mom are you proud of yourself when you make something this good? Must be good! I did not use any tomato paste. I did use a Large Swanson beef broth and a half cup red wine. As it cooked down quite a bit, I did end up using more than 2 cups of water. Will definitely make this again.  Oh and I used hot paprika.

based on reviews I added 1/2 can of tomato paste.  I used 1/2 cabernet as written in reviews. Way too much.  next time I would either omit or use 1/4 cup.  I added kidney beans, green beens and elbow noodles.  Came out more like a stew which is what I wanted.  doubled potatoes

This recipe was a big hit w/ my family especially my growing 10 yo son.  Changes I made:  I used 3 beef  bullion cubes in 10 cups of water.  I did not have any beef broth.  I also did not have any marjoram so I used 1/2 tsp thyme and 1/4 tsp of oregano.  I also added about 1 cup of cauliflower and 1/2 cup chopped fresh flat leaf spinach.  I made corn bread to go with it.  It was very good.  Next time I will make in my crock pot and cook all day.

We had our first chilly fall day, so it was perfect for making this soup. I followed the recipe exactly except that I added a cup of frozen peas along with all the other vegetables. I'd definitely do that again. It added a nice bit of color to the soup. At first I only added half the tomato paste after reading the reviews, but thought it was a little lacking in flavor so I added the rest of the can. For us, that was perfect, flavorful but not too much tomato flavor. This recipe reminds me of a homemade better version of Campbell's Chunky Soup - kind of rich with a nice combination of flavors. We'll definitely make this one again.

This recipe is excellent, and I will definitely be making it again. Made it in the slow cooker, instead of stovetop. Easy & delicious!
