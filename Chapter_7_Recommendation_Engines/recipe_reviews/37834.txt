This pie is wonderful for coconut cream pie lovers and banana cream lovers.  Food processor made quick work of crust.  Lorna Doone shortbread cookies come in two packets and one was the right amount for the crust.  It is a RICH dessert--and a pretty one.  Next time I make it, I will cut back a little on the coconut, using 1/2 c for crust, 3/4 c for filling.   I had to serve it a day later than planned, by the way, and it was still perfect.

This recipe was easy to make and tasted great.  The only thing I would do differently next time would be to cut down on the coconut...I would add 1/2 - 3/4 cup to the pudding instead of 1 full cup.  I would also suggest refrigerating it overnight or for the 4 hours recommended so that the pudding and the whipped topping set.  Otherwise, it was great and I would make it again.

I have made this twice.  One time low fat, low sugar, and the other time regular.  Both turned out well and received several compliments.  I too used less coconut in the pudding and it was good.

We thought this recipe was just OK.  I probably won't make it again and would rather take the time to make a custard from scratch for a really great tasting coconut cream pie.

This is an absolutely delicious pie! Everyone asks me to bring this to "family and friends" dinners. I do a variation to the original, partially for the taste and also as a time saver. First of all, if I am pushed for time, I buy the Keebler Shortbread Cookie pie crust and it actually seems to be favored over the original crust. I also add 2/3 cup of sour cream and 1 cup milk for the vanilla pudding mixture...honestly, I do not measure these ingredients..I add the milk until I get the desired consistency. The pie is good both ways and is always a hit!
