I did make as written as not fair to rate a recipe that has been altered.  Did not care for breadcrumbs.  My grandmother always made potato pancakes, at least once each week, but used a tiny bit of flour on outside and then were served with sour cream or applesauce. Funnily enough, I just finished dinner and logged in to find this recipe.  A friend just cooked something similar but he used ground pork and seasoned with salt, pepper, cumin, italian seasoning and a little tomato paste. Once pork was cooked he used leftover mashed, placed a good portion in hands and put pork in middle.  Formed into a 2 inch ball, dipped in beaten egg and then in breadcrumbs and fried.  Delish.

This was great - I never know what to do with leftover mashed potatoes cause they just don't taste that great reheated
