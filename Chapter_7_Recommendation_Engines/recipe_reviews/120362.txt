5 stars! The sugar/fruit ratio is perfect for SYRUP. Those of you complaining about it and using it for a cake or ice cream topping are forgetting something--you're using it on something already sweetened. This is pancake syrup, and as such, the ratio is perfect! Definitely halve the sugar if you're using this to top something that's already sweet, but for my pancakes, nothing yet has beaten this recipe! P.S.--This works for other fruits too, such as berries (any), cherries, peaches, etc!

I saved 1/4 cup of the water and added 1 tsp cornstarch, stirring until smooth.  I added that during the last minute of cooking and it thickened beautifully.  I'm sure you could add some finely diced rhubarb too!
This was yummy on pancakes, angel food cake, and ice cream.

Yummy!!! I am giving it 4 stars as after reading the reviews, I decided to use only half cup of sugar. and it turned out sooo yummy!. Maybe 1 cup is too much, half was plenty!!! I served it over angel cake with fat free whipped cream for a nonfat dessert. We made two batches and ate the second one over waffles in the morning. Oh soooo good!

I followed the recipe exact, only subtracting a teaspoon of water and adding a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I drizzled this over Chef John's Old Fashioned Pancakes for my kids this morning. To say they loved it would be an understatement. This was perfect--this recipe is a keeper.

This is just your basic simple syrup recipe with strawberries added to it.  It makes a wonderful topper to waffles, pancakes, and even desserts as simple as ice cream!

This was good except I think by using frozen diced strawberries, it made more water that probably threw off the consistency with the sugar.  So.... this ended up not as thick as I liked but still was yummo!  Ate it with pancakes for dinner.  Yup breakfast for dinner oh yum!

Very easy to make. I sprinkled a little strawberry jello in for color and extra strawberry taste.

Used more strawberries than called for because it was a little too sweet for my families tastes. 

I diced frozen strawberries (in the correct measure) and prepared by the recipe.  It was too sweet, so I added about 1C more of totaly pureed berries. Was AWESOME!!

Freezes GREAT!!

I used half a cup of sugar and it turned out perfectly! The strawberries provide most of the sweetness. Great with cream on pancakes. :D

I love this recipe.  I make it to go with crepes and pancakes.  We add a little cool whip and YUM!!  I have also added a little bit of jello just to thicken it a bit.

This was very tasty!  Mine took about 8 minutes longer boiling to get a little thicker and still didn't reach desired consistency until after the french toast was eaten and the left over syrup was in the fridge.  Next time I think I will use less sugar like others suggested, it was almost the sweetness of jam.  A nice basic recipe though and will definately make this again, thank you!

Know your berries!  I used slightly overripe Strawberries at the peak of their season = very sweet.  Therefore I only used half the sugar and it was the perfect sweetness (and I have a mouth full of sweet-teeth!).  I suppose with frozen or off-season berries, the higher amount of sugar might be necessary.  I LOVE THIS!!  Very simple.  I boiled and cooked the strawberries as listed, however I used 1/2 cup water, and 1/2 cup sugar.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added 1Tbsp cornstarch whisked with 1/4cup water and added that the last 2 minutes of cooking to thicken it up.  For a nicer presentation, I only sliced the berries in half, rather than mash or puree.  Absolutely beautiful!

very versatile, can use any fruit you like, try 2 finely chopped apples with 1 tablespoon of cinnamon for something different and replace the white sugar with brown sugar, to taste.

I made ths recipe exactly with the exception of the strwberries, I used frozen (thawed) strawberries and mashed them up. It was WAY too thin so I added 2 Tbsp. of cornstarch (mixed with a small amount of cold water) and it thickened up great. This syrup is better when cooled so it is able to thicken to the right consistency, I made a double batch of it and canned the leftovers. It was delicious served over my whole-wheat pancakes!

This recipe is simple and tastes great!  My family loves it.  I use mixed berries instead of strawberries and it is better than any syrup you can buy at the store.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious flavor.  Thought a bit too sweet though, next time will try 3/4 cup sugar.  Also, I did use 3/4 cup water at first and then mixed 1 t cornstarch with remaining 1/4 cup water and added at end.  Next time will try 1 1/2 tsp

One morning I woke up and decided to make banana pancakes. While they were cooking in the griddle I decided that I didn't want to put store bought syrup on my pancakes. So I found this recipe and made it super quick and everyone loved it. We were going to save the extras but my sister was eating it plain! Thanks Nancy!

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!  I had everything on hand and it was so easy.  After reading the reviews, I decided to add cornstarch to thicken it up a bit, also, I'm trying to cut down on sugar so I only put in 1/2 cup - nice way to really taste the strawberries.  Served over pancakes this was perfect.  I'm never buying it in the store again, thank you for sharing!!!  :-)

This was a very good strawberry syrup.  I didn't add the full amount of sugar, as reccomended in other reviews, and it was plenty sweet.  I did cook it a little longer to thicken slightly.  Once it begins to cool it will thicken considerably more.  Delicious!  We enjoyed this on banana pancakes for a tooty-fruity delight!

Delicious!  Be sure to use fresh strawberries, and if it's too sweet for you, use less sugar!  I like to add 1 TB or so of fresh squeezed lemon juice to this, and sometimes, depending what I'm using it for, 1 TB of finely chopped fresh mint.  Soooo Yummy!  :-)

I thought this tasted pretty good. Mine was a tad thinner than I wanted, but I used some defrosted strawberries that I froze. I suggest using fresh only. I had planned on straining it when it was done, but decided not to because the strawberry bits made it taste good and look more homemade. I also broke them up well, during the simmer stage. With half the recipe I got about 4 servings, so I can't imagine the full recipe making 15. It does reduce down. This is definitely better than store bought taste wise.  I may try it with fresh strawberries and report back.

i made this with splenda it turned out good. It did take longer to get thicker and i refigerated the syrup over night before using. I used less sugar. I like 1/2 would be great, i used a scant 3/4 cups and it was pretty sweet. I will make this again.

I wasn't a big fan of this.. I've made my own syrup in the past and I loved it more than this one. The consistency wasn't what I was expecting.

Gave 4 stars, because like everyone else I also cut sugar down by 1/2 (it turned out plenty sweet enough for me, and I love sugar!) and added 2 tsp cornstarch to thicken it up. It was wonderful, my husband loved it!

I really enjoyed this!  It was simple to make and tasted great.  At the suggestion of another reviewer I cut the sugar in half and was glad I did because it was perfect.  I will make this again.  I'm thinking about trying a berry mix next time.

I needed to use this as an ice cream topping so per other reviews, I reduced the sugar by half (since ice cream is already sweet), towards the end of simmering I added 1/2 tsp corn starch (I put it in a bowl first and mixed it with a little bit of the syrup then added the mixture to the whole pan), I also sprinkled a little strawberry jello powder in it. THIS IS ESPECIALLY GREAT AFTER SITTING IN THE FRIDGE OVER NIGHT. Awesome for strawberry shortcakes :)

We just made waffles for dinner and I didn't want to serve the store brand maple syrup we had. This was absolutely wonderful! So simple to make and it tastes fabulous! And I love that it's so versatile! Raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, boysenberries etc! YUM!

Delicious! I put the strawberries through the food processor to mash them so there wasn't any big chuncks of strawberry. Did add a little cornstartch to thicken as suggested by other's. Can't wait to make this one again!

Great, simple, delicious recipe.  I read the reviews and did put in about 2 tsp. of corn starch so it would have a nice texture. I don't handle sugar well, so  I used 1/3 c. xylitol, 1/4 c. agave and 3 small packets of stevia for sweetener instead of sugar.  It was very sweet.  For fun, I also put in a capful of almond flavoring.  My family loved it!

Yum!  This was delicious on our pancakes this morning.  I think it depends on what you're using it for.  Like other reviews said, it may be a little too much if you're putting it on something very sweet already.  Then you could cut the sugar.  But, for pancakes, it's perfect!  The only thing I did was add cornstarch at the end until it was the consistency I wanted.  It just was not thickening (hence the 4 stars).  With the cornstarch added, it's a 5 star recipe.

I added more strawberries than the recipe called for (it's whatever came out of the yard!), and this was a huge hit at the pancake day at my office! With the extra berries, it wasn't too sweet at all - just right. We used what little remained for waffles and ice cream; it was a great addition to each!

My family loves this syrup! I reduced the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup. I wanted to thicken the consistency just slightly, so I added cornstarch to 2 cups of strawberry syrup. I slowly mixed it back into the remaining syrup and it turned out perfect!.

I had made French Toast, and realized we were running low on syrup. Had some frozen strawberries that I wanted to use up, so we decided to make this. Dont really know if my husband cared for it, but my boys ages 4,2, and 1 loved it. :) thanks!!

My family loved this sauce. I used only 3/4 c of sugar, also I blend the sauce in the blender so make it nice a smooth and get rid of some of the seeds.  I used it on Banana Pancakes, and the flavors were awesome. Thank you for posting I will make this again.

Excellent recipe! The taste was just right, but my syrup did not thicken no matter how long I let it simmer.  I will try cornstarch next time.  Great recipe though!

Very good. I used a bag of thawed from frozen strawberries and ran them through the blender, which may have produced additional water, so I added cornstarch at the end to thicken them up. I look forward to using this as an alternative to store-bought syrup. Thanks!

This was so easy and very tasty.  I would recommend adding some cornstarch.  For the last 2 minutes of the simmer, stir at least a teaspoonful of cornstarch into a tablespoon of cold water and add it to the mixture.  Also, next time I'd like to use less sugar.  Even on pancakes this was too sweet for us.  I'm guessing that half the sugar would be perfect.

The only reason I am rating this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I would have preferred it half as sweet.  I should have read the reviews first.  I served it over plain pancakes but it was still too sweet for me.  It is a great, easy recipe but I would half the sugar.

Nice, quick and basic.  We used it over Mom's Best Waffles and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  We have some leftover, and puttin it on ice cream sounds like a good idea.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made a few modifications but got the idea here.  I used 1/2 cup of raw honey, 1 cup of water, and a quart sized container of strawberries.  I pureed the strawberries in a food processor before adding it to the boiling honey and water.  I cooked it for about 20 minutes but it was too thin.  I then mixed 1 T. of rice flour (you could use cornstarch) in 1 T. of water and added it slowly to the boiling mixture and let it cook about 10 more minutes.  It was absolutely delicious on the pancakes.

Yum! I used an extra half cup of water and only 1/2 cup sugar. I also used extra strawberries. This was fabulous over challah French toast and my grandparents and fiancee LOVED it. I think reducing the sugar and using extra strawberries really brought out the flavor of the berries and wasn't too overpowering. It was also incredibly light, and not thick and gummy like strawberry topping you get at restaurants. A real keeper!

This is way too thin to be called "syrup", even though I followed another reviewer's advice & added cornstarch.

Very simple and delicious recipe. FYI- strawberries can be mashed with a potato masher. It was nice to have a few strawberry chunks in the syrup! :)

Such a great, simple recipe.  I only had mixed berries, so used those instead and it worked out beautifully.  I added about 2 TBLspns of orange juice to even out the sweet sugar taste and it was brilliant.  We drizzled it over baked french toast for Valentine's Day breakfast and it looked beautiful :)

Sooo good. The only reason I didn't give it the full amount of stars is because it is a little thin. It still works and tastes great though. I do not recommend using blackberries. I just tried it this morning and it is not good.

This was Delicious. I made it to serve with crepes, I did make a couple of changes. I only sliced the strawberries instead of mashed , and only used 3/4 cup sugar as my strawberries were quite ripe and sweet.  used the leftover strawberries to make strawberry short cake and everyone raved that it was the best strawberry short cake ever! Will make often!

I love this! I followed other people's suggestions and just halved the sugar. I figured I could always add more sugar if I didn't think it was sweet enough. But at half a cup it tasted sweet enough. The kids gobbled it up on waffles. I also set aside 1/4 cup of water and added some corn starch so the syrup would come out thicker. I added that in when I had about 3-4 minutes left for it to simmer. I really din't feel like mashing the strawberries so I just used my food processor. This taste so much better than store bought stuff. I will be using this recipe often!!

This was pretty good. It reminded me of the strawberry syrup I used to get on waffles at restaurants. Although I think that my strawberries were freezer burned, because I  tasted a slight burn taste. My boyfriend couldn't taste it and said it was good. I thought it wouldn't be thick enough so I added corn starch, but it was thick enough by the time it was done cooking. The corn starch left little globs in the sauce.

Only three simple ingredients and the result is one great syrup with tons of strawberry flavor.  So many syrups just end up tasting like sugar, but this one has plenty of strawberry flavor and keeps well in the fridge.  And it's versatile as well.  We had this over waffles, ice cream, and used a little for a topping on mini cheesecakes.

This was very good. I did cut the sugar and the water to 3/4 cups. I used a quart of strawberries. Also I pureed about 2/3 of the cooked berries and added them back into the mix. Served over pancakes. Yum! Thanks for the recipe I will definitely use this again.

I blend the strawberries first and then add them.  I use about 4 cups of strawberries as well and it's still plenty sweet for pancakes.

Great syrup and super easy. I had some frozen strawberries I wanted to use so I thawed them and then mashed. It tastes great it was a little thin but that was probably because i used the frozen instead.

This was perfect for my pancakes this morning, i will make this again i did follow a suggestion from another reviewer and left out 1/4 cup of water in the begining and added it at the end with cornstarch! Glad i did:) I thought the sweetness complimented the pancakes perfectly and think this would be great on pound cake or angel food cake. Thanks for sharing:)

Does life really get any easier or more yummy than this?  I believe the sugar is accurate for things like pancakes and waffles as is the thickness...but if you're looking for a topping for ice cream, cake, or other desserts~ try less sugar and add 1/4 tsp cornstarch in the last minutes of cooking for dessert like thickness! Like I said, life just doesn't get any better than this!

Made 1/2 a recipe and it was more than enough for one person. Also added some cornstarch at the end becasue it was just too runny. Not bad, would probably make it again. Was really easy.

I made this syrup to go on top of blueberry pancakes (I used the recipe "Todd's Famous Blueberry Pancakes" which is also on this site).  This syrup was yummy!  I did add extra strawberries though.

Delicious and easy recipe.  I took the advice of some reviewers and cut the sugar to half a cup and also saved aside 1/4 cup of water and added 1 teaspoon of cornstarch  which I added during the last minute.  I did find it a little thin still, but that was okay because we let it cook until we needed it after supper. Definitely would have been too sweet with all the sugar

This was great.  I used only about a 1/4 cup of sugar and it was still very sweet. I also added the corn starch to help thicken it per a previous post. Great alternative to maple syrup - which is gastly expensive now! (the real stuff, that is).

I really liked this recipe. I changed it a little, i did 2 cups of frozen strawberries, and puree 3/4 of them and boiled them with the sugar and water. Then added the whole strawberries once it had boiled for a minute. I had to add about 1 tsp of cornstarch to get it to thicken like i like syrup to be. Over all i loved it!! Hit the spot!

Great jumping off point. I wanted to make a 'mixed berry' syrup and couldn't find a recipe so I used this one. I used a cup and a half of frozen mixed berries (Raspberries, Blueberries, and Marionberries), 3/4 cup water, and a cup of sugar. It was much to watered down, so I added a little cornstarch. Turned out PERFECT! Hubby couldn't get enough of it!  Thank you!!

Very good recipe.  I used 2 cups of frozen sliced strawberries, unsweetened. After the mixture heated up a bit I threw it in the blender then put it back in the pan to cook a little longer.  It thickened up a bit upon cooling down some, and I served it over banana french toast.  My VERY picky kids devoured it!

Not quite as thick as I'd prefer, but it's still pretty good.  I may reduce the sugar next time as my partner doesn't have a sweet tooth like I do. ;o)

I followed the recipe the first time and the syrup was only ok. I made it a second time and did the following:
Brought 3 cups sugar and 3 cups water to a boil in large sauce pan. Added 1 quart fresh strawberries, pureed. Brought to a boil, turned down to strong simmer for 10 minutes. Added 1 teaspoon corn starch and simmered for an additional 10 minutes. This is meant for pancakes and waffles, not ice cream. It was perfect, sweet and just the right consistency to pour. We all loved it!

So delicious!  I wanted to make strawberry pancakes and thought a syrup to go with them would be perfect.  This syrup was so delicious!  I had enough syrup for 4 large pancakes and 2 small pancakes.  

If I were to make more than that, I would double the batch.  I was making pancakes for 6 people.  The amount of syrup that you need and use, depends on how many people you are cooking for and the size of the pancake.  My 16 year old son said they were "mad good."  Slang for delicious lol.

Tasty and easy to make. Measurements are fine if you are using this as a topping for pancakes, I agree with another post this is probably not meant for cakes or ice creams. With that being said I used fresh strawberries (in season) and could probably reduce the sugar by 1/4 C and it would still be fine.

i enjoyed this, it was simple and very easy to make. the only changes i made were i put my strawberries in the blender rather than mashing them & i boiled everything until it was at the consistancy i wanted... i didnt time it. this recipe would also be good with other fruits you have on hand... i plan on trying it with peaches as well as pineapple!

Perfect ratio!!  Not too sweet and not too tart.  You can increase or decrease this recipe easily. Tastes great over angel food caked served with fresh whipped cream.
