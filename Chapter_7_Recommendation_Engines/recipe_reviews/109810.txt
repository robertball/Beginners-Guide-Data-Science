Trust me, this really IS authentic Italian cooking! I am Italian, and this has been a staple in my Italian family since probably forever, and has always been my favorite vegetable. You can skip the red pepper flakes if you don't care for the extra bite. Or you can make this with bacon and garlic rather than the olive oil. Another great use for Swiss Chard (easily grown in your garden) is to add it to soups. SO much milder than other greens. It must be washed well, leaf by leaf, and you must make what you THINK is a ton of it because it cooks down so much. The prep, then, is time consuming, but SO worth it! The red-stalked variety is especially pretty, tho' I grow both red and green stemmed for the blend of colors when I make this. Another great thing about growing your own is that as you cut the leaves off, they keep growing back!  Can't wait for summer!

I grew up eating Italian greens all time and this was delicious! One thing I did differently was to increase the blanching water to 3 cups and being aware that a bunch of swiss chard may not be the same everywhere I kept the salt to 11/2 tsp.I also added diced tomatoes and drained and rinsed cannelini beans. I also increased the garlic. It's a terrific side dish or you can make a meal by adding pasta cooked in the water used to blanch the chard. Great flavor and vitamins!

I've never made swiss chard before and because I read that it's now one of the top ten healthiest foods, I decided to give it a try. When you buy a bunch of the chard, it looks like you could feed a small army with it. For those who've never cooked with it before, let me tell you that surprisingly, it cooks down to nothing. One bunch was only enough for two people, so I needed to add some spinach to it. Karen, we all loved this recipe and it went great with the flank steak I made! Hubby and my daughter are crazy about their greens and they asked for a repeat performance. Thanks so much Karen!

The basics of this recipe are excellent.  Our garden has a bumper crop of chard so I'm always looking for new ways to use it.  I tweeked the recipe by adding fresh mushrooms, which I browned in a pan with 1/4 cup oil packed sundried tomatoes. The juices from the mushrooms,and the oil from the tomatoes,combined well with the garlicky chard mixture to create a fab sauce which I tossed with hot spaghetti. We topped it with grated Mezithra cheese. What a meal!

I'm sorry to be critical of someone else's review - and I haven't, yet made this dish but - 'tonimg' - the recipe says, "Salt to taste" so how can you blame the author of the recipe if you chose to add too much salt?

I'm only giving this 2 stars because there is something way off with the salt. We could only eat about 2 bites before putting it aside. I can feel my fingers swelling as I write. Otherwise, I would give it a 5 out of 5. Next time I will make it with 1/2 tsp of salt and then add more if I think it needs it. I would also at least double the red pepper flakes. This could be a fabulous dish!

This was delicious, but man, does it reduce down!  A whole bunch amounted to about a cup's worth wilted, at most, but it was very tasty, and I'll be sure to use more chard next time.  I discarded the stems out of personal preference and drastically reduced the salt in the water.  I found it was still salty, so I will reduce more next time.  I didn't have red pepper flakes, so I used 1/8 tsp of ground cayenne pepper.  that mixed with the garlic gave it a great kick of flavor.  I served it with New Year Black Eyed Peas & Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread (both also found on allrecipes).  I stirred the chard into my bowl o' beans when getting ready to serve it, and it was a perfect complement, both texturally and flavor-wise to that dish.  So delicious!  Thank you for sharing such a simple and wonderful recipe!

This is an excellent recipe. Sadly, the one user who rated it as too salty and only gave two starts, likely added the 1 tbsp of salt meant for the boiling water, into the recipe itself, where it calls for "salt to taste." I aslo added some bacon and tomatoes, and served it over whole wheat pasta for a delicous and filling meal.

This is a tasty alternative to just steaming or boiling the chard. It grows very well in my garden so a new way to eat it is welcome! I did not have any red pepper flakes so I just used some frozen diced sweet peppers and was very pleased with the results.

This was great. I took the advice of someone else and increased the garlic, added a small onion, cannellini beans & a can of diced tomatoes. This was FANTASTIC..the flavors were great and was so quick and easy to make.

reduced oil to 2 teaspoons, used 5 cloves garlic, and no salt, neither in the water nor in the finished dish due to health issues.  Discovered at the last minute, there were no pepper flakes in the house. chopped up half a jalapeno pepper instead. At serving time, added a squirt of lemon juice. Perfect vegetable to serve on a summer evening.

It was good but not outstanding.  First time I have cooked chard.  I think I like escarole better.

Really good recipe, a little to much salt for my taste, and I love salt. Next time I will do a half a tablespoon of salt and 3 cloves of garlic. But for my first time eating or cooking Chards, an overall good experience!

A little more water, a little less oil, a little more red pepper flake and no salt to taste.  It's my first time growing a vegetable garden and cooking chard, and I look forward to using this recipe all summer long!

I steamed my swiss chard because it retains nutrients this way more so than boiling.  I then added it to the skillet with garlic (I used 6 cloves because we're garlic crazy), some red pepper flakes and some sun dried tomatoes (suggestion from another user.)  We loved it.  We had it with some roast beef and a small portion of rice pasta.  Everything was sprinkled with fresh parsley and parmesan.  Oh so good.

This is very tasty.  Next time I will use a tsp. of salt in the water instead of a tablespoon.  It was a little too salty but still deserves the high rating.

I was given a huge bunch of red stemmed Swiss Chard and was looking for a heathy recipe to use.  I was very happy to find this recipe.  I followed it  fairly closely except I probably had 2-3 times as much Swiss Chard and I added about a cup of sliced mushrooms and 1/2 cup sliced green onions. I also added about 1/2 cup red wine and let it reduce down. Served with whole wheat pasta and Turkey Sausage (Roasted Pobano Pepper variety). Delicious and very healthy.

The only salt I used was in the boiling water and we found it too salty. Next time I will cut the salt in half for the boiling part and maybe rinse it while draining. I think I would have liked it but I couldn't get past the salt taste. I will try it again.

This was fantastic!  I was looking for something to make with swiss chard because my husband had picked some for me.  I sauteed onions and garlic first and added mushrooms.  Then added the steamed swiss chard.  Then then juice  of a fresh  lemon and salt and pepper.  I was planning to add tomato and serve over pasta but tried it first.  It was out of this world.  No tomatoes necessary.  Served over pasta with fresh grated parmesan cheese.  Definitely will make this again!  Thank you.

I thought this was really good.  For 4 adults in our family, I would need a double batch next time, though, as the Chard really cooks down.   2 issues/changes:  First, I wasn't paying attention when I started, and kicked into my 'melted butter and fresh garlic' mode.  Then I realized there is no butter in this recipe.  Whoops.  But, if it affected the recipe in any way, it was positive.  I still used the olive oil. The other issue was mine was terribly salty.  But, I blame that on myself, as the recipe states "salt to taste".  I don't know that the salt is really necessary...if so, VERY little. Overall, a very nice side dish!

This is a very good and simple recipe.  Everyone loved it (except one son who said it was spicy...but that's not unusual).  If you don't have crushed red pepper, we found that sprinkling a little red pepper powder was fine.  I would probably reduce the amount of olive oil next time....and I used two bunches of chard.

This is a simple, classic Italian dish that is always welcome at my table. I chose to steam the swiss chard to retain more of the nutritional value.  I seasoned it very lightly with salt and pepper and finished it off with  a splash of balsamic vinegar. I served this with grilled salmon steaks and mushroom risotto.

This recipe's a keeper - if you ignore the insane amount of salt at the beginning.  I used the equivalent of 2 bunches of chard from my garden, steamed those tough old stalks first (NO salt in the steaming water), added them to the sauteed garlic/olive oil, then steamed the leafy strips & added them to the mix.  Seasoning was just a light sprinkling of garlic salt & a generous amount of Mrs Dash's Tomato-Basil-Garlic mix (the dark red cap).  
Like another cook suggested, I added cannellini beans (drained) for protein and also some chopped ripe tomatoes.  The result was wonderful!  The two of us ate 2 large servings each!  
PS Use lots of garlic.

Taste is really good but I do agree with someone else's review about the salt. I will try this again and lightly salt the boiling water and then season to taste. But all in all very good

It was okay, but not what I expected.  My BF's mom grows Swiss Chard in the backyard so we have it quite frequently when we go over for dinner.  I love the way she cooks it, but this recipe came out to oily for my test.  I'll try the recipe again, but I'll use even less olive oil.  

Also, I don't think she boils hers first, but I will give this recipe another try as is (with the mod of less oil.)

My mom brought my kids greasy "kids meals" the night i made this.  They thought they wanted the processed burgers and greasy fries, until I finished this dish and plated it for my husband and me.  They were wishing they had chosen this instead.  They ended up tossing most of their meals and eating this.  It is that good.  I also grated a little fresh parmesan over the top and served it over spaghetti.  Truly Delicious!

Didn't impress me.  We thought we would use dehydrated garlic, which might have made a difference...  But I'm not in any hurry to try it again

Thank you! I had been looking for a simple tasty way to serve chard to my notoriously picky hubby - he only 'likes' what he grew up with. However his doctors now have him on a low protein diet - mostly veggie, which has complicated my life.  Your recipe, along with the tweaks lojo added, made a huge dinner time hit and a new keeper recipe ;-)

This was WAAAAAYYYYY too salty!!!!!!  It was barely palatable.  The only reason we could choke it down was because we had roasted turnips & beets that we ate along with each bite of chard.  Next time I would cut the salt in half (at least) and it may work better.

I followed the directions, but this wasn't very good.  I am always open to trying new things, but maybe I just don't have a taste for swiss chard.

I thought this was pretty appetizing. I served it over pasta with regular marinara sauce--the swiss chard & garlic made a simple pasta dish "fancy", as my boyfriend put it :)

This was excellent.  My husband loved it and he usually likes his vegetables no muss-and-fuss.  I didn't have fresh garlic, so I just sprinkled some garlic powder in the olive oil.  The taste was fantastic. I'll do this one again and again.

Classic Italian: simple flavours busting at the seems. This is a staple in Italy. I reduced the salt considerably. We served the leftovers over pasta. Delicious! Thank you for the recipe.

I modified this by not boiling the chard. Instead, I just sauteed it in the oil, pepper, and garlic. Start the stems first so they have more time to cook than the leaves. Once the leaves are tender, the stems still have some crunch to them, which is good. I actually added no salt at all, and found this quite tasty.

I made this tonight for dinner and was it ever good!  The only thing I changed was to lessen the salt in the cooking water and also to add more water as I had so much chard.  The flavor was amazing.  I've never had chard before and now I know what I've been missing.  It's delicious and I would recommend this recipe to anyone and everyone!

I liked the basic idea of the recipe and its simplicity, but I'm giving it three stars because if I hadn't adjusted it, the result would have been way too salty. I did a double take and re-checked the recipe when I saw that it calls for a full tablespoon of salt added to the water for boiling. I only added about half a tablespoon. Even after adjusting the amount down, the cooked chard definitely didn't need more salt added for taste. When I make this again, I will do the same thing and also use more water to boil; one cup was barely enough.

Thank you!  Yes, this is how my Italian family makes greens, especiallly bitter greens,  whether escarole, spinach, dandelion, chard etc.  I do variation, adding onion, mushrooms or garbonzo beans or even romano.  Today I used most of the above and added lean ham.

This was probably the saltiest thing I've ever tasted. That said, it would be great with less salt. I think we'll make it again and severely reduce the salt.

This is such a great alternative to traditional pasta sauce.  Very, very good.  I added finely chopped and sauted onion, red pepper and mushrooms.  Wish the Swiss Chard, this meal offers a good source of several veggies.

I now have a new favorite green. This is amazing. I messed it up at first - if you use red swiss chard and white swiss isn't in season, it comes out slightly bitter (mine did anyway). I was delighted to see that white Swiss chard was at the grocery store this week. I gave the recipe another go and oh...my...goodness. I could eat a big bowlful of just this. Haha! Thank you for sharing!

This is a delicious recipe. Even my husband, who won't go near a vegetable, liked it! I must agree with tonigm's post. Mine came out a bit too salty for my taste as well. I used 3/4 Tb of salt in the boiling water and added no additional salt to taste. I did add a small sprinkling of parmesan cheese at the end of cooking, which may well have been the culprit. It was a nice addition though and I would not omit the cheese next time. I also added some portabello mushrooms. I put these in the skillet with olive oil a couple of minutes before the garlic. Thanks for a great recipe. This was my first, and certainly not last, experience with chard.

My grandmother made this all of the time.  She didn't pre-boil the chard.  Used only a bit of water and steamed with the seasoning.  At times she would add bits of bacon.

I would've given this five stars, but I believe it's written wrong. I am glad I read the reviews first, because 1 Tablespoon would be waaaaay too much salt!!! I used 1/2 tsp in the water and about the same, if not less on the finished product. It turned out great, yum! First time I cooked chard, and I'll definitely make it this way again.

I have renamed this recipe "Garlick'd Swiss Chard" because it is one of my favorites.  It's so flavorful, to the point of actually being yummy. The cooking method gets the flavor into the thick stalky parts (which need to be put in first to cook longer. I left out the salt (as I do in almost all recipes). Also, this recipe freezes really well.

This was very good! I just bought Swiss Chard for the first time due to the nutrition in it and this was perfect and wasn't bitter at all.

Pretty tasty, maybe could have used some seasoning but I really liked it as an alternative to spinach.

Very easy! Very delicious! I didn’t have the red pepper flakes. I added basil leaves & it was very tasty. Thanks for sharing.

This is a great recipe - very authentic and very similar to what my mom used to make (she was brought up in Sicily).   But, there is way too much salt! (I think others brought that up).  I would only put in a half teaspoon.    Also, another modification you can try is to add a cup or two of spaghetti sauce to the garlic just before you add the Swiss chard.   That's how mom made it and I love it that way.  But it is good without the sauce also.   Great job!

Delicious! I made the recipe exactly as written, only added a little more red pepper flakes and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese over the top before serving. I WILL make this again!

Loved this!  Added some mushrooms, red onion and cherry tomatoes to the olive oil, then the swiss chard.  So tasty and easy.

This is so good and easy.  I've made it several times and it always turns out perfect.  Thank you for posting such a great way to cook the whole chard- including the beautiful rainbow stems.

A little too much oil and a little on the mushy side for me but it was OK.  If you really like greens, then you will probably love it. I will probably make it again with less oil, add a little chopped onion, and try not pre-boiling the chard.  My husband, who loves greens, said it was OK and he would like to have it again, but he always says something nice no matter how bad it is :-)

As a garlic and swiss chard lover, I loved this.   Brought back good memories of being at my Sicilian grandmas house in the summer.  I used more water, less salt and topped with some Parmesan cheese.  Yummy!!!

OhMGoodness this was wonderful! My mother only used chard in an ethnic soup when I was a child, but when I saw rainbow chard in the vegetable section of the garden plants this spring, I wanted to try growing and using it. I knew it would be good FOR me, but I didn't know that it would be GOOD! To be fair, I used leftover bacon grease to cook it (what's not to love about that?), so it did put some additional flavor into the dish!

Thank you for this.  So simple and so delicious.  I harvested my garden swiss chard for the recipe and served it on rice (maybe not the authentic Italian way but great).  I ended up eating it all myself.

This is an excellent dish to accompany any meal! I like that the chard can be blanched ahead of time and then you finish by sauteeing the garlic & pepper flakes with the chard stems & leaves at the last minute.  I like to top with some freshly ground Parmesan cheese to finish. This has been a hit with everyone who's tried it - even those who claim to not like greens. Note that the tablespoon of salt goes into the water when you blanch the chard - not into the final dish!  After you sautee' the  dish, then add only as much salt as you need to suit your taste preferences - we like to also add fresh ground pepper.

I never had Swiss Chard before. This was pretty good. The Chard is a little out of season, so I am eager to try this in the summer. I did not boil it beforehand, I think that would have made it way too mushy. I might cut back a bit on the garlic next time too, but this was simple and easy to make.

I agree it was too salty, but I just left out half the salt and it was okay.  Next time, I'll leave out a bit more.  Other than that, it was really good!  My daughter even ate some.  My husband said, "Feel free to make this all the time!"

I think this has the potential to be great, but it is way too salty. I will definitely make it again, with much less salt.  Oh, and I didn't even use as much as was called for.  I bet I could give it 5 stars then.

I did add some garbanzos at the end for added protein.

I don't know what I could have done wrong, considering this recipe has so many good reviews.  This was like eating kelp off of the beach.  The salt taste was everywhere, nothing else came through.  I might try this again, but not put the salt in with the water when boiling.  Maybe next time...
