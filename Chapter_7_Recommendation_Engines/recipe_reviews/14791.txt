I made these a while back. I did do some modifications....I used flour tortillas, and made a chipotle in adobo creamy slaw,and a nice little sauce w/ lime cilantro, jalapenos, onions & lime. I guess like a Baja sauce. My hubby and I loved them!!!! We will be having this for dinner!!!YUM!!!

I'm giving this 4 stars because it would have been extremely plain without adding more seasoning, but it IS a great idea for tacos. I had some ground pork that I didn't know what to do with--I can't believe I couldn't think of tacos on my own, since I usually make them about once every week, or so. I did add a pkg of taco seasoning and some extra cumin and hot sauce, so they came out very flavorful. The kids ate 'em up, so that's what really matters :-) I will definitely make these again--thank you!

Wow these were good...I had never thought about using potatoes in a taco filling but am sure glad I tried it.  I had some leftover, well-seasoned Jamaican Jerk Grilled Pork to use so grated the red potatoes and sauteed them slightly in a mixture of butter and oil, then added the thinly sliced meat and let both simmer until the potatoes were cooked through.  I served the meat and potato mixture on a corn tortilla garnished with avocado chunks, sour cream, and cilantro.  If I had not been using pre-seasoned meat, I would definitely add some type of seasoning as without it the tacos would be too bland for my taste.  I made these a second time, again with leftover pork, but I kept adding a little of this and a little of that until the end result was not really like the original recipe.  I did grate the red potatoes and after they were slightly brown added the thin strips of pork.  Then I added some medium salsa, a pinch of cinnamon and some ground cumin, a handful of raisins, and enough water to let it all simmer together for a few minutes.  Served the pork mixture on a flour tortilla topped with sour cream and shredded lettuce.

We made this one night when all we had was odds and ends to put together and it turned out real well. Not spicy at all which was good when 7mths pregnant. I thought it had good flavor and I really like the combination of everything together. My husband wants to add more spice next time. yumyum!

This was pretty good, but I found myself adding quite a bit to give it a little kick--salsa, shredded carrots, corn, cilantro, cumin and fajita seasoning.

This turned out delicious.  I did add taco seasoning mix (recipe on AR) and once the meat was brown, I added 1/2 cup of orange juice (like carnitas) and let it cook off while I prepared the rest of the meal.  Also, I used a handful of frozen shredded hash browns for the potatoes.

My husband and son didn't like this as much as me. I personally liked how the grated potato made the texture softer, less like ground meat. I added a package of Pace taco seasoning. I can't imagine this would taste much like taco meat just as the recipe is written...

I found this recipe one night when I basically had nothing left in my fridge. I had a frozen pork chop and a few potatoes. I salted and peppered the chop and browned it on each side and then put it to the side and later pulled it apart. I shredded two potatoes and seasoned with salt, pepper, taco seasoning, cumin, chili powder, and some garlic powder. I cooked the potatoes with a quarter of a chopped onion for a few mins then threw the pork back in with a splash or two of beer. I then followed up with the water as the recipe stated and simmered away. I scooped it into a tortilla with some cheese, hot sauce, sour cream, and salsa and it was amazing!! What a great mid week fix!

Great recipe! I made a couple changes because I have extremely picky eaters who are used to tacos a certain way. I added chopped onion to pork and potatoes, then added taco seasoning and chopped red pepper and served in soft tortilla taco boats (was all we had on hand). They were delicious! I also used leftovers to make a taco salad which was great too. Thanks for recipe!!

This recipe turned out great!  Just make sure you brown or caramelize the meat/potato mixture - it makes it taste so much better!

This was one of those meals that  my wide and I looked at each other and said I don't know if I really like  this. Added taco seasoning to spice it up a bit but it still tasted like you were eating baby food. Far too many potato to pork ratio made it soft and mushy. Might try it again without the potatoes but that's about the only thing unique about this recipe, so I really wouldn't be trying it again.

I used frozen hash browns and added taco seasoning. It was a hit with the boys. Not being big on tex-mex myself I enjoyed these as well. Thanks.

The meat and potato mixture sorta tastes like a tuna patty until you actually put it in the taco. That's awesome for someone who can't have seafood anymore:)

Please don't use ground pork, folks.  Use pork steak & simmer it until it falls off the bone.  You already know what seasonings you like & what tastes 'Mexican' to you.  Add potatoes & onions to the pork steak while simmering.  Season as you like but serve realmex style-on the side with beans, rice & your favorite peppers.  Tear off pieces of tortilla & 'pinch' some meat & beans.  We call it picadillo.  Remember-ground pork is for whettos who know nothing of Mexican food.

i never would have thought that a taco could still be good even without beef, it wasnt perfect, but it was delicious any way
