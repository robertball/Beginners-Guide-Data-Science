I made this with a few changes and it was great. I used 2 colored peppers no ginger or hot sauce. I used 2 tablespoons of balsalmic vinegar to flavor it instead. For the glaze I used 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup balsalmic vinegar. Loved the quinoa in this with all the veggies. It was a big hit at dinner. Everyone wants it again

Very good. I left out the bell pepper as a personal preference. Without the peppers to contribute to the structure I had to use a cup of bread crumbs to hold it together. Otherwise no other changes were made and it turned out very well.

I prepared exactly as the recipe stated with the exception of leaving out the ginger and using a whole red & green pepper since mine were small. I thought the flavor was good and the quinoa gave it a nice texture. I turn the broiler on for a few minutes at the end to caramelize the glaze.

This was very good. I used round Ritz-type crackers instead of bread crumbs because I didn't have any. I will make it again.

This turned out great. I did not use the breadcrumbs. I blended a little bit of brown rice with the quinoa and used Sriracha instead of the sweet chili. Will make it again.

I like this recipe it s very tasty. I ve made it three times now. The first time turned out great! The next two times it was very (too) moist. Tons of liquid came out during cooking and made a mess and looked very unappealing. I guess I would recommend less or no milk? I m not sure what role it has in this recipe. The flavour of the meatball is great though. I will adjust next time.

This was delicious. I made it without milk due to a food allergy but it doesn't need it. Great flavor even my hubby who doesn't like quinoa said it was good.

I cut this in half and only used ground turkey. Everyone loved it. Since I only did half, I made one regular loaf size and not mini, just to save time. My 10 yr old loved it and asked me to make it again soon.
