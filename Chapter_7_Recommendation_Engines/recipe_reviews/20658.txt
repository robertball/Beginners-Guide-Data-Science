Makes WAY too much for one loaf pan. Also, there's so much baking powder you can taste it in the bread. I would try making it again, but next time will cut back on the amount of baking powder.

Excellent bread, but I will definitely use about 1/2 the amount of cloves next time.

Very easy and tasty. I like not having to peel the apples. Mine was done about 15 minutes earlier than it was supposed to be.

I love this recipe!  Absolutely delicious and low fat too.  It's firm enough to be toasted - wonderful for breakfast.

I followed this recipe exactly, and my family and I agreed it was just so-so. It tasted pretty bland to me. I'll probably try a different recipe next time.

Wow!  Talk about great fun bread.  My grandmother even asked me for the recipe.  I replaced the cinnamon and cloves with apple pie spice and the bread taste was perfect.  I however took it out too soon and was a little gummy in the middle.  I will turn the oven down an additional 25 degrees next time as the outside was over done and the inside gummy.

A tasty and healthy quick bread.  I made it even more low-fat by using applesauce instead of oil.  I also put a little more chopped apples than the recipe called for, and I peeled the apples first.  Be sure to use a 9" x 5" pan because anything smaller will create a mess in your oven.  I will use this recipe again whenever I have a few extra apples in the refrigerator!

Turned out nicely, overall. As recommended by other reviewers, I skipped the cloves (didn't have them, in any case), but added nutmeg. I also doubled the amount of apples, and substituted 1 c. oats for 1 c.flour. Baked it in a bundt pan (made a big bundt) for 1hr to make sure it was done all the way through - though the top was still a bit darker than I like. Really did make the house smell great! Would make again, perhaps as muffins (do not have muffin tins right now - as a grad student, it's a wonder I've got anything around!!).

This bread is good, but I made a few minor alterations.  As suggested by other reviewers, I did not use cloves, used about 3/4 tsp of nutmeg (and about the same amount of cinnamon), I also did not use all 4 tsp of baking powder (I used about 3 tsp).  Instead of cooking 1 big loaf, I divided the batter evenly and put it into two small loaf pans, this worked out great and only took the loaves about an hour to cook (at 350).  I do however agree with other reviewers in that...this loaf is not really 'bread' like - it's more of a cake consistency for sure.  I did eat it toasted for breafast this morning though, and it was good.

Wonderful toasted for breakfast with Crm. cheese or butter. I didn't use any cloves. Used cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice. Can't wait to make french toast! I divided mine up in two bread pans and it worked out fine. I'll make it again.

An easy to follow recipe with a delicious result! I would, however, be inclined to use basically the same recipe but make muffins instead just because they don't bake as long and could be ready and eaten sooner!

Awesome!!! I substituted whole wheat flour for half of the flour and applesauce for the oil. I also added 2 tablespoons of fat free sour cream. I used 2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg in place of the cloves. The bread turned out moist & delicious and it was healthy :)

I made this recipe to use up red delicious apples.  It made 4 mini loaves (1 1/3 c size pans) and one half size mini loaf.  I cooked for 40 minutes and let cool in pan 15 minutes.  I also used 1 cup whole wheat flour in place of 1 c white flour.  They turned out really moist and tasty and they're low fat too.

This bread was the worst recipe i have tried from this site. It was not sweet at all and weigh about 2 pounds. It was not nice and fluffy like how i usually like my bread to be. It did smell nice. It needs more sugar or some kind of sweetener.

The cloves overpowered the bread. It was heavy and got gummy inside. Would not make it again.

I had the opposite problem to most people - too dry! Possibly because I divided it into four mini loaf pans. It just did not taste 'apple' enough for me, and the batter seemed to lack SOMETHING. But it was good enough to inspire me to make it a second time, with some tinkering. My best inspiration was to add cream cheese to it. I added half a cup and it really made it have a better texture and flavor. I also increased the apples to two cups - have since read that someone else doubled the apples, which would be 3 cups - I can see that because even just adding 1/2 cup more didn't make a huge difference. I like clove, so I left it as it was, but just about doubled the cinnamon. I really like the spices to "kick" - I double all the spices when I make pumpkin pie!

Anyway, the 'second generation' of this recipe was much better and I will make it again with the cream cheese - and will add even more apples  next time around.

I took two mini loaves to my small office this a.m. and by 9:30 they were gone!

JUST THREW OUT THE FIRST LOAF. WILL TRY SOME CHANGES NEXT TIME.  BAKE AT A LOWER TEMP FOR A LONGER TIME, USE LIGHT COLORED METAL PANS, DIVIDE INTO 2 SMALLER PANS, OR USE MUFFIN TIN.  ALSO AGREE WITH OTHER REVIEWS ABOUT CLOVES BEING OVERPOWERING AND REDUCE BAKING POWDER.

This was ok, as several other reviewers said it was kind of doughy. I baked it longer than it said and it still didn't seem quite done in the center, but the top was getting pretty dark so I didn't want to bake it longer. The batter was very thick, I think it needs more liquid or less flour. And the cloves were just a little strong, I would add little a less cloves and maybe add some nutmeg. I think I will try it once more with a few alterations and see how it turns out, it defiantly has potential.

Made this the other day.  Very good tasting.  More "cake-like" than quick bread texture.  Had to leave in oven about 15 minutes longer than recipe suggests, that was due to my using a bit smaller loaf pan.  Will definately make again. Thank you Tuula

I thought this bread was good.  I tweaked it a bit, per suggestions- less baking soda, more apples, no cloves.  It was still a bit gummy but nonetheless tasted great.  Will make again if I have apples to spare.

I made this yesterday with a few changes.  I used 1/2 all purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour.  I did not have ground cloves on hand, so I used nutmeg.  I thought it was good but not great, my husband said the same.  My 2 1/2 and 11 month old ate some of it too.  It seemed like it should be a little sweeter maybe?  Carol

You have to REALLY like the taste of cloves for this one!  It would've been really good perhaps if I left out the cloves and doubled up on the cinnamon.  A little bit of cloves goes a long way!

Family loved it.  Didn't have cloves on hand so added tsp of vanilla for a dif. flavor.  Turned out pretty good.  I suggest toasting it the next day.  Really brings out the flavor of the apples.

I followed the recipe, except that I only used half of the cloves that the recipe called for.  The clove flavor was still overpowering.  The crust was thick and hard, all the way around.  The inside was good, but I am not a fan of scooping out the inside of a loaf of bread. I won't try this recipe again.

very easy and good.  I added a 1/2 cup of sour cream and a splash of vanilla.  Also added a topping with 1/4 cup of chopped nuts, 1/4 cup chopped apples and a TBLS of butter and a teaspoon of cinnamon.  Put in 2 bread pans.

I like this but made a few changes on my second try and it turned out much fluffier. I used 1 cup whole grain flour with 2 cups white flour, added 2 TBSP ground flax, used 3 TBSP cinnamon but no cloves, cut the baking powder by 1/3 and added 2 TSP baking soda and 2 TSP apple cider vinegar. This is so good I could almost eat the whole thing myself!

I absolutely love this!! Great for breakfast or afternoon tea! So quick and easy to make! perfect for slicing and toasting with butter! I left the peels on the apples and it was great! The only thing i did was add a half a teaspoon of mixed spice, which is a combination of cloves cinnamon and nutmeg,  because i was out of cloves. Happy Baking!

We loved this bread. We did however, make a few slight changes. I didnt add the cloves and i thought the dough was a little dry so i added some extra milk. i also added a little apple pie spice. i didnt cook it for as long as it said to. it was done about 20 min, before.

I was able to make four smaller loaves of bread with this recipe.  They were a little gummy inside after baking, so I put them back in for about 10 minutes and they turned out fine.  They do taste like apple pie.

i used only 1/4 tsp. cloves, added 3/4 tsp. nutmeg, and also reduced the baking powder a little. turned out well, but next time i will reduced the oven temp. a little since it was a little gummy inside and maybe add a little more cinnamon.

Excellent recipe! I often cook this to get rid of apples that aren't so fresh anymore. It's great that you don't have to peel the apples and it's a good way to get apples into kids because they mostly disappear. 

I use 3cups of apples.

This is super easy. I took some of the others advice and used less cloves but added nutmeg and vanilla. I also used a larger loaf pan. I made 2 because my family really loves it. I also added cranberries and walnuts to the second.

I’ve used this recipe a lot and it’s always delicious. Family members have raved since the first time I had made it during a devastating hurricane. The smell that this gives off, feels like a holiday hug. This time around, I made them into little breakfast portions. Still came out at the recommended time. Makes enough to make like 13-14 cupcakes. I read a comment where they said it tasted like baking powder or something? No such thing! Maybe they used tablespoon instead of teaspoon? The only wonderful thing that lingers in your tastebuds is the cloves!

This bread was ok, but I've had better. I did end up putting a streusel topping on some because I thought it needed something more. After reading the reviews, I did cut back on baking powder and cloves. I added extra cinnamon and extra Apple.

This was a good recipe, but the bread itself was very heavy. It actually spilled onto the cookie sheet that I had the bread baking on. Next time I will use two loaf pans or one very large pan. The other thing was that there is a lot of cloves. If you like cloves its great but I will cut back on the cloves next time. This is a perfect bread for Fall where the taste of cloves would be more welcome.

I'm always looking for some recipe to use up a couple of apples. This recipe was excellent. The bread is moist, but hold together and tastes great. I added some chopped nuts and didn't use the cloves, which worked out well. This is definitely a recipe I will use often. Highly recommended.

I must say this was a very easy recipe to put together, not much in the way of time consuming.  But the results were not very satisfactory, the cloves were overpowering, even when I tried the recipe a second time with no cloves I found it to be a very bland tasting bread.

I don't like this recipe at all. There's a lot of flour in it probably too much. The top is crusty and the sides are really tough. It's not even sweet enough. Waste of time.

Yummy, i changed this into 24 muffins and put in almost double the amount of apples. I dunno how long i cooked them in my convection oven, but it was quite a while. I added more cinnamon and less cloves. Everyone liked them, tasted good with raspberry preserves. I added a bit less baking powder, only 3 tsp, but it still seemed to have an odd taste. I will make again.The inside was like apple pie when they were warm out the oven, nice and gooey from the fresh apples.

This is an awesome bread - It even gets better when toasted and absolutely delicious when made into french toast and to top it off I love the fact that this is a low fat recipe. Any way you eat it, it's a definate keeper.
