This dressing is really great.  Can be used as a marinade as well.  IT can be a bit heavy on the oil.

The dressing was superb according to me and my 8 year old (who isn't a salad eater but had 3rds on this!) but my 5 year old (who eats salad quite often) and my husband hated it.  It's a very strong vinegar taste so adjust it according to your taste.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I love Caesar salad but had never made it myself before. This was easy, used ingredients I had on hand, and tasted as good as, if not better than, the Caesar salad we have at our favorite Italian restaurant.

A very nice dressing when you want that Caesar taste. Could use less dressing on the salad to start off with, and let others put more on if they like.

This is sooooo delicious!
I really had my doubts but I was pleasantly surprised. The only changes I made was that I put tofu into the salad for extra protein and didn't use anchovies because I forgot to buy some. It's just as good as a regular caesar salad.

the salad dressing was very good, but not very caesar-like IMHO.

This makes a quick and easy Caesar salad.  I did add 1/2 tsp. sugar though.

So good! It's a great knockoff without the need for anchovies and the egg. My kids gobbled it up!
