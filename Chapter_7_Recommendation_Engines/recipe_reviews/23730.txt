Excellent recipe - I have probably made this a dozen times so have these suggestions.....
The recipe does not say to use a 9" springform pan but this is the best I have found.
Melt the butter/sugar mixture (the recipe calls for marg but I used butter for a richer flavour) in a microwave or toaster oven in a bowl then spread it over the pan bottom.
Add 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon to the dry and sift the dry ingredients for a fluffier cake texture. I also use double action baking powder for all my baking as I find it better than the regular b.p.
Enjoy!!!

YUM!! I made this and it was a hit!! The only thing I will do different next time is mix all the fruit together. The cake was higher in the middle because the plums cooked down more than the blueberries. I will continue to make this over and over again.

Like many others, this was my first attempt at au upside down cake, and I have to say the recipe is very straightforward and easy to follow. Unfortunately, my pan was not up to the task. I had bought a new 9 1/2 inch Wilton springform pan for the occasion and failed to test it before using it. When I melted the butter/brown sugar (which I doubled after reading earlier comments) in the pan, the butter leaked out of the bottom of the pan and all over the foil I keep on the bottom of the oven. I have since read you should test spring pans to make sure they hold water before use, and this one definately didn't, so I will be exchanging it. Despite this rocky start, however, the cake turned out quite well. Not as pretty as the recipe pic, probably because of the topping fiasco, but very tasty. I did increase the flour by about two tablespoons so I could throw a handful of chopped plums and a handful of blueberries into the batter and that worked very well. I also added 1/3 cup of walnut pieces to the batter for a little more texture. I took a couple of pics before and after baking and will see if I can post them. In any event, this is definately a recipe worth trying and I will be making it again.

I followed the other reviews and added the 2 Tbl flour and doubled the brown sugar and butter. I also added lemon flavoring instead of vanilla. The co-workers were very impressed.  A great dessert for a pot-luck or holiday.  Tip: Gently spoon batter over plums so as not to dis-place fruit.

Very pretty (looks impressive!) & tastes good. The glaze makes the fruit very sweet, but whipped cream/cool whip balanced this out. Overall I was very pleased with this cake & will definately make it again.****2005 I have made this with success again & again. I have to admit, though, I now add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the batter.

I was surprised at how good this turned out...didn't have any blueberries so I just used plums.  I didn't let it cool before I turned it over so it wasn't very pretty but tasted fabulous.  The cake part is yummy....I might try it with other fruits next.

great treat!  I used pluots instead of plums since I had them on hand and changed the vanilla extract to lemon extract and added lemon peel to the batter and lemon juice to the fruit.  I liked the bright taste that the lemon cake had with the sweet fruit.  Great recipe!

I'm surprised at my reaction to this cake, given all the super positive reactions on the site. The cake was very easy to make, and looks absolutly beautiful. However, I find it to taste sort of bland. Next time I make a plum cake, I might make it like a coffee cake with a crumb topping or something. Or maybe simply adding cinnamon or other spices to the white cake would spice it up. I don't think I'll make this particular recipe again...

Great Recipe! 
I used all plums and substituted about 2/3 of the butter with applesauce.  The tartness of the plums balance the sweetness of the cake perfectly!

This was a beautiful cake.  However, I baked it for 60 minutes and my toothpick wasn't coming out clean.  So finally I took it out from the oven, thinking it wasn't coming out clean because of all the fruit or something.  When I turned it out and cut into it about 30 minutes later, the whole middle (where the blueberries where) was totally raw.  So I threw that part away and we enjoyed the plum part.  I think it may have been my fault though, because I used plums to cover most of the pan, so I only had a little room left over for my blueberries.  They ended up in a big pile which may have had an effect on how it baked.  Otherwise, I would have given it five stars. **** Made again 8/16/2005 using very ripe nectarines.  It was so good I'm changing my rating to 5 stars!

What an amazingly easy cake, and so delicious. I made it with white peaches instead of plums, and I used a 9-inch cake pan. I had to bake it for longer than the 40 minutes specified in the recipe, but oh well. The secret to getting the cake out of the pan is to butter the bottom and the sides well, then let the cake rest for about three minutes after taking it out of the oven. Tilt the pan from side to side to get the cake to pull away, then put a plate over it and turn the whole thing over. (Protect your hands from the heat - but you knew that.) The cake was a big hit. Next time, I'll make it with plums.

A beautiful cake and a great way to use up the abundance of home-grown plums available in the late summer. I have made the recipe exactly as stated several times and each time it was a big hit. Not too sweet & perfect for any occasion. Even had a guest scraping crumbs off the bottom of the plate after the cake was devoured!

Wonderful, I added the cinnamon in the batter for a little spice taste and butter for the fat that others suggested and used fresh peaches that I had on hand with the blueberries. Very easy and looks like a cake from a fancy bakery. Serve with a whip topping and a few fresh berries on top.

This was pretty good.  Mine was tart, but only because my plums were a bit tart.  Otherwise unlike some reviewers, my cake came out perfect, I baked for the 40 mins, turned the oven off and left it in the oven for about 3 mins.  The recipe doesn't say to do this, but seeing as how its an upside down cake, I turned it over onto a plate soon after taking the cake out of the oven.  The only revision I did to the recipe was that I used all plums, and used almond extract instead.  Will make this again.

This was delicious!  I made a few revisions....I used salted butter instead of margarine and omitted the salt.  I added about 1/2 a package of vanilla instant pudding mix and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the flour mixture.  I used almond extract instead of vanilla.  Also, I had to bake about 15 minutes longer than the recipe said, but that may just be my oven.  Other than that, I stuck to the recipe, and it turned out perfectly and tasted delicious!

This cake was very easy to make and pretty.  However, the cake itself was too mushy.  It needs more texture and firmness.  Even though it wasn't so bad as to throw it away, I would definitely use a different recipe next time.

I could find no blueberries in town so I improvised!  I added a blueberry muffin mix to a yellow cake mix.  I followed package directions for the cake, but added an extra egg and 1/2 cup sour cream.  It was absolutely delicious and received rave reviews!

Absolutely fabulous. I took the other reviewers advice and increased the amount of brown sugar and butter-about 5 T and 1/3 cup of brown sugar in the bottom of the pan and added a touch of cinnamon. I couldn't get  4 plums around my pan-only about 2 1/2 but it came out beautifully and the taste is to die for.  Mine took a bit longer to cook than state-about 50-55 minutes but my oven seems to always be slow.

MMmmm! Very moist cake and sweet yet tart plums! Delicious :) I added a little more brown sugar and one tbs more butter to the pan to bubble. I didn't have blueberries but it was fantastic! The plums were caramelized around the edges and had a slight chew. The cake was so moist. My husband and son loved it, so did I. The only thing with the bake time was it wasn't done in 40mins. had to add about 15 more mins till the toothpick came out clean! I will be making this again for sure.

INCREDIBLE!  I doubled the brown sugar & butter mixture, also added pluots to the outer edge, then plums, then a bit of fresh blueberries in the center (only one layer so they wouldn't get too gooey).  In the CAKE MIX, I doubled the vanilla extract, added zest of one orange (made it amazing! would add lemon zest too next time), 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, one teaspoon of ground nutmeg, and added 2 handfuls fresh blueberries to the cake mixture as well.  absolutely amazing!  next time I will put in less (maybe half) of the white sugar.  going to make again for a potluck brunch!  I posted a photo!

The cake was nice and light. I used butter instead of margarine and added a bit of lemon zest to the batter for extra flavor. 
I did find it too sweet (it burned in my throat). Will make again but definitively cut down on the sugar next time and take advantage of the sweetness from the fruit itself.

Yum! This was tasty and a really pretty presentation too! I made these in mini pie pans to make individual servings. I used veg. oil to mix with the brown sugar for the bottom, and I used soy milk to keep it non-dairy. Thanks Blondini12!

This was a very good cake.  There is a nice contrast between sweet and tart.  To be honest it tasted just as I expected it to judging by the ingredients and pictures.  No surprises here. I did not pile the blueberries in the middle I think the presentation and taste is better when the blueberries are sprinkled around.

I made this recipe with only the plums and used unsalted butter instead of margarine. It is delicious and a big hit with my husband. It baked in exactly the time designated in the recipe. For those not familiar with upside down cakes, it should be included that as soon as the cake comes out of the oven, put a plate on top of it, hold tightly with potholders and flip it. It came out of the pan like a dream. I used a regular 9" cake pan. I will definitely make this again with any of the fruits mentioned in these reviews. It is a simple, elegant and different dessert, especially served warm! Thank you :)

Yummy and pretty, just make sure to let it cool enough before flipping it out of the pan.  I wanted to see what it looked like and the cake broke apart.  I will try it again and let it cool properly.  Thanks form Barb in BC Canada

Love this recipe - if you can find black plums, they really look lovely.  I plan on entering this into our county fair, so this was my test run and it went well - if you're baking for others - do take the time to cut up all plums first so you can arrange the slices by size - i did three rows on the exterior with a single layer of blueberrys in the center so as not to sink the middle when you turn it over.  I did 1-1/2 times the brown sugar and butter, and that was plenty - do microwave it and then mix together or you may scrape up your cake pan if using non stick.  The 1-1/2 times was almost too much, as some of the fruit slid a bit after I turned it over.  I cooked it for only 35 minutes and it was perfect - but I was using a dark non-stick 9" pan.  I forgot to grease the sides, but it still slid out just fine.  I also added a 1/2 t. cinnamon and a 1/4 t. nutmeg to the dry ingredients - I love nutmeg w/ blueberry - I may double these 2 additions next time.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe - can't wait to make it again!

I made this cake with mini French plums called mirabelles. The sweetness of the cake complimented the tartness of the fruit nicely. I sprinkled a tiny bit of powdered sugar on the top to take the edge off, but you probably wouldn't have to with red plums and blueberries. I froze this cake immediately, and when I served it thawed, and warmed slightly, it was just lovely. 

To respond to some reviewers saying that it was bland, I would have to say that yes in a way it is a "plain" cake. But that was what was nice about it. I'm always making spiced cakes etc. but some people don't like cinnamon etc. If you are worried it will be bland, add cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves, which compliment both fruits.

This cake reminded me of a coffee cake. In fact, substitute sour cream or yogurt for the milk, and it will be even moister!

This was my first time making an upside down cake and it turned out amazing!  I did add 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon to the cake batter and because I didn't have any plums I used fresh peaches along with fresh blueberries.  I had to increase the baking time to an approximate total of 65 minutes instead of the 40 minutes as was stated before I was satisfied with the results of the toothpick test.  This is a keeper!  Thanks!

Oh...My...Goodness!  This was divine!  The only changes I made were whole wheat pastry flour, butter, and sucanat instead of white and brown sugar (I'm in love with sucanat - it's healthy AND tastes wonderful).  So, so good.

Amazing recipe. I followed this recipe as written, using the submitter's suggestion to sub peaches for the plums. I took one reviewer's advice to add cinnamon to the batter as I liked that idea, and  I baked it in a 9" springform, which made it very easy to plate. I needed two medium size peaches and only a 1/2 cup of blueberries for this recipe. This was a snap to put together from start to finish and looks so pretty. I was proud to serve this (popular) cake.

First off, I had to bake this for over an hour. It wasn't even close to done after forty minutes. I only had a 10-inch springform pan, and was a little short on batter. Will make a 1 1/4 batch in the future.  Despite the snags, the cake was delicious! I had it with some good vanilla ice cream. I used peaches and had a half cup of pecans on hand, so I threw them in the oven to toast with the melted butter and brown sugar. I will definitely be making this again!

Delicious, moist, nice texture. Sweetness of the cake offsets tartness of plums. Made exactly according to recipe except no blueberries. Half of the plums stuck to the pan, but the cake still looked good.

This was a big hit.  I usually don't like to monkey with a recipe the first time I make it, but I substituted about a third of a cup of flour with almond meal and added about a teaspoon of almond extract. It complemented the plums really well.  I used less blueberries than called for because that's all I had, and fewer plums because I couldn't fit anymore (I had big plums).  It had to bake a lot longer than the recipe said, but once the toothpick came out clean, it was perfect.  We served with whipped cream.

This is totally delicious!!!  That little brown sugar/butter glaze on top is yum!  I used frozen blueberries which worked fine and accidentally used an 8 inch pan which worked okay too.  My whole family LOVED it!  Definitely a winner!

My pie didn't turn out to be an upside down cake.  The batter settled to much and I had fruit all through the cake, not just on one side.

I also forgot to set a timer, so I'm not sure how long it baked for.  It was still pretty good though.

I really enjoyed the plums on the top of this cake. The cake itself, however, tasted like a mild corn bread to me. I expected a lighter, sweeter flavor. This is definitely worth a try for the taste of the plums alone; they are beautiful on top of the cake, too. However, if you're looking for a sweet dessert, maybe a different batter is in order.

I liked this cake a lot, it was very pretty and quite tasty. I added a tsp of homemade spice mix to the batter (a blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cloves) and I only used as many blueberries as needed to fill the center, about a third of a cup.

I've been making this cake for a hunting lodge this fall and have had nothing but rave reviews. I leave out the blueberries as I can't get them in the small town I live in. I also add a bit of nutmeg and cinnamon to the flour mixture. I also serve warm and drizzle a little half and half over the cake just for that extra touch of "home", but this cake is fantastic alone!

An absolutely beautiful cake and easy to make. I used butter but did not change any other ingredients.  Following other reviewer suggestions, I baked this in a 9 inch spring form pan which was a mistake. The butter-brown sugar mixture leaked out all over the oven floor. Next time I will follow the directions to use a 9 inch cake pan and possibly line the bottom with parchment paper for ease of removal.  The cake has a nice vanilla-buttery taste and the plum topping is slightly tart (probably less tart if your butter and brown sugar don't leak out). For the assembly, I put the layer of plums all over the bottom of the pan then put the blueberries evenly on top of that layer instead of concentrating them all in the middle.

I made the following substitutions: sugar free vanilla flavored almond milk instead of regular milk and 1/4 cup unsweetened unflavored applesauce for the egg. I also added some cinnamon and blueberries in the batter. The flavor was amazing! I think the only change I would make is to bake it longer since the middle wasn't quite done yet (I have to bake with a toaster oven, which can make things difficult sometimes). I might also bring down the fruit to two plums to reduce the moisture content. I also didn't use all 4 plums, only 2.5. It turned out very pretty and smelled wonderful when baking. Many people here doubled the brown sugar mix, but I wouldn't personally. My husband loved it to. Update: baking it longer at a slightly lower temperature and it worked wonderfully for the center. Baked brown but not burnt to get it baked all the way through (took about and hour). I also made this with strawberries and bananas and people loved it!

I made this recipe as stated, I had smaller plums and used about 2 cups sliced worth, no berries. It was very good! Like many others some of the sauce leaked out of the springform, I might try this recipe in a regular cake pan next to try and keep the sauce inside. Easily adaptable to almost any fruit you have on hand and infinitely variable by adding nuts/other flavors (such as lemon). Thanks!

Wow, this was sooooooo good!  This was probably my favorite cake ever--the cake texture was great and the slightly tart plums balanced nicely with the super-sweet syrup.  I didn't use blueberries and I loaded up the pan with lots of plums.  I doubled the brown sugar/butter mixture and added 1tsp of fresh lemon zest to the cake batter.

Easy to make and yummy to eat--especially topped with ice cream or cool whip! I made it with the plums and it turned out beautifully! Not too sweet and oh so moist.  My hubby loves it and showed it off to his buddies at work.  Makes a wife proud!  Next time I'll try it with peaches and blueberries just for kicks.

This was my first attempt at an upside-down cake. It came out beautifully- only a couple pieces of plum stuck, but I easily slid them off the pan and put them back into place.  It was very moist, not too sweet.  Would make again.

Oh my goodness!!!!  I have found my new favorite cake.  I love the tartness of the plums, the not-so-sugary blueberries, and the sweet, fluffy cake.    It is so easy to make this turn out pretty.  But here's my advice, if you can hold off cutting the cake until it's cooled completely, the fruit will hold together better and moisten the cake nicely.  I haven't been able to wait long enough, yet, though, so the fruit pools in the middle of the plate.  But, hey, it's just so GOOD!!

Excellent cake!  I didn't have blueberries, so only used plums.  I mistakenly used baking soda instead of powder (I realized this when the cake was in the oven) and it still came out great.  I am making two more right now (with baking powder this time!), but instead of baking them in the oven, I am going to try baking them on my gas bar b q.  I've done it with several other dishes (roasted vegetables, roasted chicken, apple crisp, etc) with pretty good results!  As it is 107 in the shade right now, no way am I turning on my oven!

I used plums all throughout the bottom of the pan and then added blueberries on top (scattered all over) The blueberries ended up being more inside the cake. It was really yummy. I tried it with peach also...same yumminess!

I used 5 red plums and frozen blueberries with a little freezer burn. I also used butter in the cake and half butter half margarine with the brown sugar. The cake batter was a little thicker than I expected, because it sat while I prepared the plums. I doubt that it made a difference in the final cake.

Wow! Not only does the house smell amazing, but my tastebuds are raving! This is truely a treat and a way to use up some of my plums. 

A light ice cream or whipped cream would be a possible addition, however entirely unnecessary in my opinion.

Wonderful! Thank you!

Very nice late summer cake.  I made it without the blueberries, butter instead of marg. and cut the white sugar to two thirds of a cup.  I was in a hurry so rather than melt the butter and br. sugar in the oven I spread softened butter in the pan, sprinkled with sugar then continued with the recipe as written.

Excellent! My husband loved this recipe. I didn't have plums, so I used extra frozen blueberries. The only other alterations I made were to use butter instead of margarine, double the butter and brown sugar per other reviewers recommendations, and add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the dry ingredients. I also always make my upside-down cakes in a cast iron skillet for crispy edges.

Wow! This recipe is delicious!. I used the same ingredients except I used Italian plums from our tree instead of black plums. I did have to cook it about 10 minutes longer like the other cooks indicated. I may have to try it with other fruits. Big thumbs up.

This was my first time making an upside down cake and I was not disappointed! I had to run out and begrudgingly buy a new springform pan after reading KB's review, but it was definitely worth every penny! I did increase the butter and brown sugar topping by 50%, and I also added a heaping half tsp of cinnamon to the dry ingredients. It was so good that my husband and I skipped dinner and went straight to the cake :) UPDATE: I just made this yesterday for one of the desserts for a big dinner at my house. The previous time I had made this, I melted the butter for the bottom of the pan in the microwave and then added the sugar and whisked it together until it was creamy, then poured it into the pan. Last night I tried doing it as instructed by placing the butter and sugar in the pan and letting them melt together in the oven and it did not work at all!!! I had melted, oily butter and clumps of sugar. Luckily I had enough time to clean the pan and start over by melting the butter in the microwave and then whisking in the sugar or my dessert would have been an epic failure to an otherwise wonderful meal :)

WOW.....this was delicious.  I could only get Pluots instead of plums, found out I had no milk in the house so I substituted  half Almond Breeze and half cream, had half the amount of butter called for and it STILL turned out to be the moistest cake ever!  Will definitely make again and experiment with peaches and necatrines while they're are still in season.

Wonderfully light and fluffy cake!  The few changes I made were I used peaches instead of plums (that's what I had on hand) and I added half the white sugar and replaced the other half with dark brown sugar.  I also added a teaspoon of ground ginger and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon to the butter mixture.  I also find that lining my cake pan with a parchment circle helps to ensure a clean release from the pan.

This was really wonderful, especially the next morning. The whole family enjoyed this cake. I did use butter instead of margarine and I melted my brown sugar and butter together in the microwave and then poured it into the pan instead of melting it in the oven. I only needed 2 plums as they were fairly large, and I used blueberries from our garden! I also didn't "beat" in any ingredients, but mixed them on a lower speed so as not to jeopardize the texture of the cake. I baked it for only 35 minutes, my toothpick came out clean and I removed it before it baked dry. My only regret is not having a 9" cake pan, I have what I believe to be a 10" or bigger, so the cake came out pretty thin. The flavor of this cake is great, it's so easy, and very attractive!

Took the suggestion from another member and just used plums for the topping while mixing the blueberries in the cake and this turned out great. Slice the plums thin and you get that hint of flavor rather than feeling like your biting into a huge chunk of fruit. Next time we are going to try peaches and either raspberries or blackberries as this seem like it would work with most of the summer fruits.

this recipe was great! it was very pretty and the best when it was still warm from the oven. i had to cook it a bit longer, it was a bit tricky to make sure the toothpick was clean in the center with the blueberries. i will make this again when i have guests to impress.

I've made this cake many times in the past couple years mainly because family members keep demanding it for dinners, even my cousin who is a professional chef.  I've made it with both plums and blueberries, just plums and peaches as well.  All of them have turned out both delicious and beautiful!

I did everything possible to make this cake turn out wrong.
First, my egg was too cold when I threw it in the butter/sugar mixture - it curled. Then I mixed the milk with the egg/sugar/butter mixture instead of how it is suggested in the recipe. My pan was too large and made of glass. The fruit I had was neither plum nor blueberry, but apple/cranberry/pear/blackberry. I forgot to grease the pan. After all that, plus forgetting when I put it in the oven, this cake came out better than I expected. It came out of the pan beautifully and the husband even said, "wow, that's pretty." So, this recipe is pretty hard to totally ruin, believe me...I tried. And it tastes good too. Even better the next day than the first.

I made this with small black plums and pluots - a plum/apricot hybrid.  The colors were very pretty together, and the cake itself was delicious - perfectly sweet and moist.  It was fun to make and eat!

I made this recipe because I had alot of plums that I didn't know what to do with.  The result was fabulous! I didn't use blueberries, just plums.  I was nervous at first beacause I used countrycrock insted of margarine and I mixed the batter really well not realizing the recipe said mix just until incorporated.  Even with that my family thought it was the prettiest cake I've ever made...and it tasted even better than it looked!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

My family loved this recipe.  Definitely a keeper!  I'm just making it for the second time in two days by popular demand.  It was underdone in the center after the full cooking time but we thought that made it even tastier.  What little was leftover was still delicious the second day.

Doubled and made in a 13 x 9 pan. Tasty cake a bit on the sweet side, maybe reduce sugar next time. I used all plums.

This is a hit everytime I make it.  Sometimes I omit the blueberries and it's just as tasty.  The cake is super moist and the way the plums "carmelize" make it very pretty when you flip it over.  It's easy to make.  I'm not a baker, but this was simple and quick.  I love it!

Wow!  This has to be one of the prettiest cakes I've ever made.  It was very easy to make, which is a huge bonus.  I did use real butter instead of margarine.  Also, it took longer to bake than the recommended time.  But as long as you do the toothpick test and it comes out clean, you'll be fine.

Can you say "NUM"! Our neighbors tree is falling from red plums so I was looking for a good recipe that I could make with just plums..which I did I even goofed by not greasing the pan and was in a hurry but came out so good I almost ate the whole thing myself. If you got plums this the the bomb!!

I inherited a plum tree with our new home and was thrilled to find this recipe!! The family loved it. I used butter instead of margarine. Will make it again as I've got plenty of fruit in the freezer!

This cake is phenomenal! I only used plums since I did not have blueberries on hand. The tartness of the plums contrasted perfectly with the sweetness of the cake. This cake is also very easy to make. I love that it uses margarine instead of butter since margarine is so much cheaper than butter! I also used a pie pan since I did not have a cake pan on hand and it turned out beautifully. Will be making this again.

A little fussy to make, but the results are worth it. Wonderful flavor, and I loved the texture of the cake part. I confess that I didn't turn it out (afraid it wouldn't come out neatly) , but just spooned it out of the pan.

This recipe took a bit of time to make, but I brought it to my parents for dinner and my 7-year old nephew said "yum, yum, yum".  I thought it was okay, I would make more of the butter and sugar topping next time and beat the batter less.

Hi Dina,

This was a great cake!!  I used all blueberries cause I didn't have any plums on hand, and it turned out great.  It was a tad too sweet only because the blueberries I used were the wild kind and were very sweet on there own.  I will try this recipe with all kinds of berries as the season progresses.  Thanks A lot,

I questioned myself pouring this in the 9" cake pan. Yep. ..it blew over that pan all over the stove setting off the smoke alarms. Holy cow wont use that pan again. It is a good cake though and I will make it again just in a spring form pan. Off to get the oven cleaned!

I had just what I needed to make this cake and needed to use up some plumbs that were slow to ripen. Not sure it would be at all remarkable; we were amazed at how lovely it was and how wonderful it tasted! The only thing I changed was to use only butter, rather than a combination of margarine and butter. Yum, I am making another one tonight to share with family.

My colleagues absolutely loved this one. I'm not a fan of plums, or in fact, fruit on cakes at all, but when a farm we work with dropped off a pile of fresh plums I went hunting for a recipe. I left out the berries. And bought some custard for anyone who might want to add it. Rave reviews all round, with and without the custard.

Great recipe and very easy to make.  The only change I made was to use butter instead of margarine. Liked it so much I made the following day as well. I didn't have anymore plums so I  made it the second time with blueberries and blackberries and it was just as good. This recipe is a keeper :)

Add 1 tsp. cinnamon to flour mixture. Substitute yogurt for milk. Use butter, not margarine.
Double the butter/cinnamon mixture.

A hit, every time! Just be sure to cut the fruits thin. Otherwise they won't be soft enough. Also, I'd cut the sugar by a third or half.

The cake was very good but I followed the advise of another baker and used a spring form pan which was a big mistake.  Half way through the baking time the butter started leaking out all over my oven.  Also had to bake for 60 minutes.

Perfectly delicious. I followed the recipe but added vanilla bean paste and only black plums. Everyone loved it. I served it upside down so people could enjoy the beautiful design of the swirling plums. 

NOTE: the cake gets a wonderful crust when baked. Having that crispy texture is what makes this recipe stand out. Flip the dessert after 15-20 minutes onto your serving platter and serve immediately or you'll lose that crispy bottom.

The first time I made this cake I omitted the blueberries and used Santa Barbara plums.. it was superb. Since then I've made it with blueberries included, with pineapples, with nectarines, peaches, and several different kinds of plums. I use almond milk since I am dairy free and it comes out excellently. Did I mention I first made it two months ago? I've made this cake literally dozens of times since. The plum and blueberry combination is great but the cake base is very very versatile. I've memorized it and it is my go-to. Definitely worth a try. A+.

I doubled the brown sugar and used all pitted, halved, Italian Prune Plums and put them skin side down against the bottom of the pan. I also followed the suggestion of adding 1/4 teas. of cinnamon. Cardamom would also have been good. I used an 8" springform pan which made the cooking time a little longer. The cake took at least an hour to bake. To get the bottom of the pan off the cake I slid a piece of dental floss between the pan bottom and the cake after it was inverted onto a plate. This is a delicious cake and would work great, I think, with cherries and almond flavoring or any other fruit which appeals to you.

When plums are in season this recipe always comes to mind. The outcome is impressive so don't tell anyone how easy it is to prepare. It's not too sweet. To prepare the pan I grease it a tiny bit and place a piece of waxed paper in the bottom cut out to fit. Then I melt the butter in a liquid measuring cup using the microwave. I add the brown sugar to the melted butter, stir, then pour the mixture into the prepared pan. For me this ensures that the fruit doesn't stick to the pan. After the flip carefully peel off the waxed paper...It's lovely. Serve with a dollop of fresh whipped cream and the Oooos & Ahhhs won't cease till the last bite!

This was really yummy.  I used blackberries in place of the blueberries since thats what I needed to use up.  I really liked the flavor of this.  I sprinkled powdered sugar over top of the slices.  I did have to cook an extra 5-10 minutes so that it wouldn't be too gooey.  This was actually still good reheated the next day as well.  Thanks for this great dessert idea!

This recipe was a HUGE hit. Even my extremely picky daughter liked it. Usually any dessert that isn't chocolate is snubbed. 
I followed other people's advice and used almost double the butter and brown sugar for the topping. I also used prune plums and it turned out great. I also added cinnamon to the cake batter and topping. I would definitely make this again.

I had a bunch of fresh black plums I got from the store and wanted to use them before any went bad.  I didn't peel the plums, doubled the butter/sugar mixture for the topping and used 3/4 cups of brown sugar in the cake (was out of white sugar).  Turned out great.  My husband loved it! Will make again.

I made this recipe today for a luncheon with an Aunt and a cousin -  It was so light and simply delicious.  This will be a recipe that I will make often.

Quick, easy, and delicious!  I make it in a cast iron pan so I don't dirty up too many dishes.  Thanks for the great recipe!

A.MAZ.ING!!! Worth 10 stars, and I'm a very tough critic. Made it with all nectarines. Decreased the sugar in the batter to 1/2 a cup which was plenty since the top/bottom is so sweet. Will definitely make again.

I added about a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon like other reviewers mentioned. I baked it for about 55 min and I still don't think the center was quite done. It tasted delicious, but didn't look as good as it tasted. If I make it again, I will put the plums over the whole top and then just put the blueberries underneath that. This is excellent served warm with ice cream!

I made this cake and it's amazing.  I was a bit worried because there wasn't much batter for the pan but it rose nicely, also there was a whole cup of sugar.  Usually I would cut that back but left it because of the tartness of the plums.  It was perfect.  I upped the baking powder to 2 tsp to make it a bit fluffier.  I also added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter, as well as 1/4 tsp almond extract.  It was perfect.    I did follow some of the previous suggestions of the brown sugar and cinnamon added on top of the plums.  The cake is so yummy even without the plums, this is a definite keeper.

Very good but unforunatey I do not like blueberries so substituted apricots.   Apricots marry very well with plums.   Substituted grated lemon rind for vanilla because we like the tartness.   Wonderful if eaten fresh but does not keep too well - of course it doesn't sit around too long here.

Absolutely delicious! I used two different types of plums (5 instead of 4) and used butter instead of margarine. My family finished it within an hour of it coming out of the oven!

Love this cake... made it with plums only as I did not have blueberries. I thought for sure the cake would stick to my cake pan... but it came right out onto the plate after letting it cool for 15min. It is a beautiful site and it taste great. I like the tart and sweet together... wonderful!

Amazing cake!  And so easy!  I made two cakes last night - one in a cake pan and one in a springform pan. The cake in the cake pan came out perfect - much better than the springform pan.   This recipe is excellent and so beautiful.  In addition to the plums, I added a mixture of frozen blueberries, raspberries and blackberries (from Costco) and it was just incredible.  I followed the recipe exactly - thanks so much.  This will be my new standard - and I never really cared for plums!

The only change I made to the ingredients was to use butter instead of margarine. I took another reviewer's suggestion and baked it in a springform pan. It was easy to remove from the pan that way, but it made an unattractive pattern on the fruit :( The taste and texture, however, was awesome. I served it warm with ice cream. Next time I will serve with fresh whipped cream. Very impressive. ** Update** This time I made it with peaches instead of plums, and I did make fresh whipped cream. Very good again. My son told me that I should've made two, as he ate 3 slices in one sitting...

Delicious cake.  A perfect mix of tartness from the plums & sweetness from the cake.  Didn't add the blueberries to my cake, though.  Also, found that a touch of cinnamon added nice flavor to the cake.  Will definitely make again!

Oh oven, why hast thou forsaken me?  What was supposed to take 40 minutes to cook took 1 hr 20 minutes (when I usually don't have more than a 5 minute time discrepancy between my oven and stated cooking times).  Ultimately, there was still a patch that wasn't quite cooked through, and 1/4 of the cake fell apart when I tried to flip it.  Glad I lined my springform pan with tin foil - it was a juicy mess.  I give it 3 stars on taste, but it loses the other two for messiness and not turning out 100%.

I didn't have blueberries on hand so made this with raspberries and plums which worked well together.  I served this with warm custard as the English would and it really made the dish!  I also spread out the raspberries and plums and it worked great.  Easily made with any type of fruits.

I am religiously chocoholic, but this cake is so delicious I have a hard time stopping at just one piece. EDITED TO ADD: I have now made this for my in-laws, my parents, and my sister, and all of them really liked it. My in-laws mentioned out of nowhere how good this was months later, and my sister declared it her new favorite cake and ate probably a third of the cake by herself (and probably would have had more if there weren't other people to share with). It looks amazing and it tastes even better, and in my experience it's great for company! I can't recommend this cake strongly enough.

I'm going to give this a 3,my mother was the only one to seemed to have liked it,okay,I did change it a little,I used applesauce instead of white sugar like another reviewer,it did seem like a lot of sugar and I have subsitued applesuce before but it just didn't seem to go in this recipie, and plums are a pain to me to slice,I vowed right then and there NOT to make this again. And maybe it's just the people down in this neck of the woods,I just can't seem to find to many blueberries lovers. Oh well,I'll keep cooking.

This was very good! My pan was not big enough so it did overflow but it was still delicious! I did leave out the blueberries and just used plums and it cooked up just fine. It looked so beautiful and tasted wonderful. I took the advice of others though and did double the butter and brown sugar. Next time I will use a springform pan though.

I don't know what I did wrong! I am an experienced cook and this recipe looked and sounded perfect, but it was a disaster for me. I followed the recipe exactly. My 9inch pan just wasn't big enough because it overflowed during baking. The center never got done even though I baked it for 55 minutes. There was no way I could even think of trying to turn it out onto a platter like in the pictures. It never got solid enough to do that. My plums were very ripe and juicy so maybe that was the problem.  The "up side"of this downer cake :o) was, the edges tasted great and the "overflow" cake was delicious, especially the part that got really brown and cripspy!  Since no one else had this problem, I guess it was mine, but I would never try this again until I figure what I did wrong.

This recipe was beautiful and delicious!  I used only plums and white whole wheat flour and everyone in my house loved it.  Also, I didn't have a cake pan, so I used a square glass baking dish and it worked out well.

I made this last night and it was fantastic.  My only issue was that the cake didn't set up completely and when I took it out of the pan it fell a little.  This could have been due to a few things (the heat, adjustments I made, too many blueberries etc), but all in all it was really good and I will definitely make it again!  The only adjustment I made was using 3/4 cup of applesauce and 1/4 of Splenda to replace the 1c of sugar.

This is so good! I used plums & nectarines, baked it in a springform pan, used almond extract instead of vanilla (because I'm out of vanilla but it was a delicious substitution!), and put it in a 10-inch springform because I wanted to use double fruit, which I did. I used 2 heaping cups of diced plums & nectarines (actually leftover fruit salsa from a recipe on this site--Annie's Cinnamon Chips & Fruit Salsa) and spread it out as thin as I could. I had to add about 20 minutes to my baking time as a result of the extra fruit, so at the last 20 minutes I just covered the cake with alumminum foil and let it ride. This was by far the best scratch cake I've ever made and while I'm sure that part of that is due to how much I love plums, part of it is just because this really is a delicious recipe! If your springform pan is a leaky one, just put the whole thing on a cookie sheet. When I make it again I will probably use slightly more brown sugar in the initial bubbling stage--I felt like there was a bit more butter melting than I had sugar to blend in. Edit: 8/19/09 I keep coming back to this one! This time I replaced 1/4c. of white with 1/4c. whole wheat flour. Couldn't taste a difference! I also used clementines as my main fruit--I should've doubled or tripled the sugar topping for doing that, just a tip for others!

First time ever making this cake and it's terrific! It didn't look as nice as the picture but it sure tasted great! I added the lemon zest and an add'l 2 TBL of flour like another reviewer suggested. As soon as hubby is back from over seas I'll make this for him. =)

I tried this recipe with plums and blackberries.  Perhaps my fruit was off or something, but there was a mysterious bitter taste that pretty much ruined the cake topping for me.  I did add lemon zest and juice to the cake which was great.  I just need to figure out something new for the fruit topping.  Maybe peaches next time...

This is so good. I have made this cake several times and everytime it just turns out perfect! My daughter isnt a big cake eater, but this was one she really liked. I guess the fruit made it moist all the way through. This is just a great recipe! Good Job!

Great recipe - gorgeous cake! I added cinnamon and lemon juice to the mix and didn't have white sugar so I used 3/4 c maple syrup and cut milk to 1/2 cup. This pretty one definitely impresses!

Mmm Mmm Good!  This cake is absolutely wonderful.  The batter is just perfect.  Like another reviewer, I used a bit of lemon flavor.  I also used a tube pan, only putting plums in the pan and placing blueberries around the plate after the cake was done.

The recipe really needs no modification unless you want the lemon flavor.

Great recipe.

I have made this every summer for the past 6 years to take advantage of available fresh fruit.  It is a very forgiving recipe, tastes wonderful & looks great.  Just a couple of issues: I have found 40 minutes at 350 is just not long enough; the center is not cooked properly.  This might be because of the blueberries I'm piling on in the center. Also, I reduce the salt by about 1/4-1/2 tsp.  Try adding lemon extract instead of vanilla & some cinnamon to the batter to boost the flavor, although it's a lovely, pleasant cake as is.  Very easy to make and perfect with coffee.

This was the first upside down cake I'd ever made, and it turned out great! I made it for a barbeque, and everyone seemed to really like it. It was very moist and sweet but not too much. Following the lead of another reviewer, I added 2 extra tbs flour and a small handful of chopped plums and a handful of chopped pecans. Wonderful!

I made it for a coworkers last day at work and he and everyone else absolutely loved it.

I made this cake with just 2 and a half plums (that's all I needed to cover the 9 inch cake pan) and it really merits 5 stars. Between the brown sugar on top and the white sugar in the batter,it is a very sweet cake, so I will cut back on the white sugar next time. Layering the plums is time-consuming but the presentation will be worth it. I also added a pinch of cinnamon to the batter for extra flavor.

I really love this cake! It has the perfect kind of sweetness- not too much and even a little tart. Yum. The cake is light tasting. the plums and blueberries are excellent together. This is the first recipe on allrecipes that I haven't changed a thing!

Very good!  I didn't have plums and blueberries so I used canned peaches (without the juice) and a fruit blend (raspberry, blackberry and blueberry).  So moist it melts in your mouth.  This was the first time msking an upside-down cake.  The family has already requested a sequel.  Thanks for the recipe.

Not bad at all.  It is a unique taste of sour and sweet.  I used fresh blueberries and plums.  Very easy and quick to make.  A summer treat.

Well, overall the taste of the cake is great, but MAKE SURE YOU LET IT COOL SOMEWHAT BEFORE FLIPPING, I didn't read that in another review until after the fact......It broke apart, but the taste was still there and everyone still enjoyed it. I may or may not attempt it again, we will see if I ever have any extra plums around.

I made this in a hurry last night and it went together so quick.  My plums were a little ripe, so didn't slice well at all, so I just spread them on the bottom of the pan, then sprinkled a handful of blueberries over.  When it came out of the oven, I couldn't wait to taste it.  We waited about 20 minutes, and oh my goodness!!!  It was so good!  This recipe is a keeper.

This is such a keeper - I've made it with plums, nectarines, apricots - any kind of soft fruit would go down well, I imagine. It really is a pretty cake. Easy to make and an impressive result.

Made exactly as written, stellar flavor! Took exactly 40 minutes for me. Struggled a bit to get it out of the cake pan but likely because I should have greased with butter instead of spray. Did not use the blueberries because I had so many plums to use up. This is a repeat, thank you!

This is a fantastic recipe and so versatile. First, I made this in my 10 inch cast iron pan because I like to melt the butter and brown sugar in it. I used plumcots as they were on sale 1/2 price. After baking and cooling, just before flipping over onto a plate and serving, I heat the pan for a quick 15 seconds to warm up the fruit and caramel. So dang good.

I didn't have a 9 inch cake pan so i doubled the recipe and used plums and peaches in a 9x13 casserole dish. It turned out yummy.

Very easy recipe that would work with a variety of fruits - get creative!
I thought the cake part was a little sweeter than necessary, but maybe my fruits weren't as tart as some. Keep that in mind when making this again and adjust sugar if necessary.
TIP - don't try to make this in an 8" pan (like I did because that's what I had handy) - it overflowed! If you only have an 8" pan, scoop a little batter into a small dish or custard cup and bake it separately.

I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, doubled the butter + brown sugar combo, and used a 10'' cake pan for a higher fruit to cake ratio.  This was great!  I will add it to my metal recipe box where I keep all my tried-and-true recipes!

We didn't have black plums so I used about 1 dozen chopped prune plums instead....the blueberry/plum combo is delicious and the cake is beneath is nice and moist. Add a dollop of lightly sweetened whipped cream and you've got a spectacular dessert! It's a keeper!

I used this recipe for a peach upsidedown cake, and it was lovely.  I increased the brown sugar in the topping slightly, although the cake itself is pretty sweet. Overall, I was very happy with it, but like all upsidedown cakes, I removed it a little too soon and the center was a little underbaked.  Next time I will be more careful to wait for a very dry toothpick.

This cake was delicious!!!!!! I didn’t change the cake part of the recipe except to cut the sugar by 1/2.  For the topping I had no plums so substituted with apricots and strawberries as well as the blueberries. I would certainly make it again!!!!! Thank you for it.

I left out the blueberries. The plums were sour, so I sprinkled a little extra sugar on them before adding the batter. The finished cake had a lot of liquid in the bottom, but it tasted wonderful.

This cake came out just perfect!  The only change I made was to use slightly less sugar in the cake batter.  My only other tip is to take out the margarine-sugar as soon as it's melted and slightly carmelized on the bottom of the pan.

Made this with fresh black plums from our farm share and it was delicious! I noticed others said to use a springfoam pan and I was glad I did. I can't see the sticky top coming out of a traditional pan so well.  I did not have blueberries so I omitted them. It was pretty easy and came out nice. I don't like overly sweet desserts and the tartness of the plums works well with the sweet caramel and cake. I only wish there was a bit more cake - the cake is thin. Also, just a note that it took about 20 minutes longer to cook than the recipe stated, but still came out nicely cooked in the end.

It was ok tasting and it's definitely a pretty cake. I used a mix of different plums and I did add the blueberries. For me this cake wouldn't be nearly as good without the blueberries and I think next time I'll double the cake batter.

Wow! I've never used vanilla in a fruit crisp, and the addition made all the difference.  It was so fragrant. The dessert came out with just the right balance of tart and sweet. I will make this again.

Great recipe! Looks impressive and is super simple to put together. Everybody loved it. I added a pinch of cinnamon and a dollop of mayo to the batter and half again butter and brown sugar for the base. Will absolutely be making again and again.

I followed this recipe exactly the 1st time I made it. I loved it & it's beautiful. The second time I made it I used a 1/4 cup less white sugar & it's still amazing!!!  The plums bring their own sweetness.... black raspberries are a great addition too.

I doubled the batter added a middle layer of fruit on pecans and then topped with the last half batter. Liked the crunch in there. Cake has a nice density. Twas yummy. Good with vanilla ice milk or cream.

After a couple of changes to the original recipe (50 gr less sugar, some lemon zest and 1/2 tsp cinnamon) and an increase to the baking time by 20 minutes, it became a flavourfull, moist cake.

I made this as indicated in the recipe, except I used 1 plum and 3 pluots, and reduced the sugar by a couple teaspoons.  The cake part was moist, fluffy -- excellent.  The syrup, however, was two sweet for my taste, even with my slight reduction in sugar.  My advice would be to adjust the sugar based on the sweetness of the fruit.  In my case, I think I could have used half the sugar, and it would have been fine.  I could not find a springform pan that was not leaky, and therefore just used a regular glass pie pan.  It worked fine, but be sure to grease it very well.  I used a thin metal spatula to help turn it out.

Very tasty and easy.  Use butter. Use a springform pan. Would have been prettier without the blueberries, they glopped everything into purple mush so you couldn't see the pattern of the plums. Served with custard and ice cream, it only serves 6 unless everyone is eating daintIly. Luckily I made an extra one, full recipe but in a loaf pan. Worked great, just slightly thicker cake.

This cake was fantastic and would be delicious as written. I omitted the blueberries because I didn't have any and it really didn't need it. I did add about 1tsp of cinnamon to the flour and soured the milk (I would have used buttermilk if I had it) using a capful of vinegar and letting it curdle for about ten mins. I also used butter instead of margarine. The result was a beautiful, super moist, fluffy cake with a tart, caramel topping that my family would not share. So good.

This cake is perfect. I mean, it's a showstopper, it's simple to make, and it's so, so delicious. I subbed blackberries for the blueberries, because I went blackberry picking today, and it turns out no one in my house actually likes blackberries. I was only able to fit about 2 and a half large black plums in the cake. I sliced each into about 16 slices, so about 40 slices of plum did the trick around the circumference of the pan, and I arranged about 10 gigantic fresh blackberries in the center. The batter made a wonderful, buttery, rich cake. It turned out perfectly. 
I would say, use butter instead of margarine, because why not! I actually used salted butter. Thumbs up! Wowzer. Going to make this again, but next time I will use fresh peaches and raspberries.

I found this cake to be to sweet.  Also I left it in for way longer than 40 mintues and the center was still raw batter.

I made this cake twice, with mangoes and blueberries instead of plums, and it was fabulous both times.  Cakes are not my long suit and I was delighted with how it turned out-- light, delicious, just sweet enough but not too sweet.

Easy and yummy!  My family of five gobbled it down!  Only used plums and added the 1tsp of cinnamon as others suggested.  I didn't even slice my plums pretty because they were too soft but it didn't matter because the taste was all that did!

I made a double recipe because only one cake layer is not enough  and it's easy to refrigerate and have later. Unfortunately,  the cake came out very dense and soggy. I don't know if its something I did or what, but I don't think I'll take another chance on this one.

I've made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe but it was in the oven for 50 minutes nit 40.  It still was not completely done in the middle, too juicy.  The second time I used peaches instead of plums and baked it for 60 minutes.  Much better!

no changes except - only 2 plums to go around the edges of my 8x8 pan but I think I could have done a double layer and it would be just fine and I had to cook it 10 minutes longer than the time listed.  Turned out great - pretty and delicious!  we will be making this again.  thank you!

I only used plums, I chose to not put in blueberries.  It was delicious and will make this often....especially when the plums are in season.  Peaches would work as well.
And the cake is perfect.....just a light dusting on top of cinnamon and sugar mixed.....and voila, perfect....
I am going to try freezing it and reheating it on the weekend
(after eating 1/2 of it tonight).

We loved this dessert.  I used half butter/half applesauce as I do in all my baking to keep it lighter.  I also used Almond milk.  These were the last plums of the season and so sweet that I cut the sugar in half.  I also added blueberries to the top.  It was scrumptious.

I followed the advice of many other reviewers and doubled the butter/sugar in the bottom of the pan. Also used peaches because that's what I had. This turned out absolutely beautiful, it could've been in a magazine or cookbook. It tasted nothing short of incredible. Sooo so delicious. I especially liked it cold from the fridge.

Wicked easy, tasty. I didn't have any blueberries on hand, but only 2 giant plums. The blend of flavors was very good. Going to try with whipped cream next time.

Very very good. Instead of melting the butter and sugar in a springform pan, I used a cast iron skillet and cooked it over the stove, then baked the cake in the skillet. I also doubled the butter and brown sugar. Amazing.

I made this recipe today.  I bake quite a bit but this was my first go at an upside down cake.  I subbed butter for margarine and I added some cinnamon to the flour mixture.  My store was clear out of plums so I used apricots and blueberries.  I had to bake a total of 50 minutes until my cake tester came out clean.  I let it sit the 15 minutes stated in the recipe after coming out of the oven.  It popped right out of my pan when I inverted it! I had sprayed a 9 inch cake pan with butter flavored cooking spray.  I will make this again with whatever fruit is in season! I can't wait to try it with thinly sliced apples in the fall after we go apple picking and have an over abundance of apples!!

I've made this a number of times and it never fails to disappear too quickly.  This time I made it w/a gluten-free flour and lemon extract instead of vanilla.  Also greased the pan w/coconut oil.  You won't be disappointed.

Just made this cake with these modifications: Doubled the brown sugar and used butter instead of margarine, added fresh blueberries, lemon zest and nutmeg to the batter, Substituted sour cream for milk and used an abundance of red plums. Previous comments were very helpful. Cake turned out great-very moist, light, lemony flavor. After 40 minutes cake appeared done when poked with toothpick on the bottom. After flipping the cake I found it was not done-very gooey so I put it back in the oven for another 30-35 minutes before it passed the toothpick test. Might have been the juiciness of the fruit. In the end it turned out very good. Might want to monitor cooking time.

excellent cake. I made it with a combination of plums and nectarines and it was great. I think you can safely use any fruit you have at home with this recipe and have a great result. Highly recommend!

This was wonderful! I did have to bake it 45 mins., instead of 40 as directed. I also used butter instead of margarine. Other than that, I followed the recipe. Very moist and great flavor! I will make this again! It's a keeper!

love it. made a couple subs, per what i had in the kitchen. used 1 cup whole wheat and 1/4 cup bread flour. also, used a duck egg, which is bigger than a chicken egg and richer. no bloobs on hand, so it's an all-plum affair. i used a square baking pan, put a plate over it, and flipped to get it out. stayed intact. yum!

Loved this! I am not a pie maker, and my guy loves pies...great alternative. He loved it even better cold! I ate 1 piece, he (over the next few days) finished the rest! Would definitely make it for company. Good with vanilla ice cream on top too! And, was VERY happy to see how easy it came out of my pan!!!

I used peaches from our peach trees instead of plums, butter instead of margarine, and added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon and 1/8 tsp. ginger to the dry ingredients and had great results.  I took the cake with me to a potluck and everyone gave it rave reviews.  I was afraid the peaches were going to make the cake too watery, so I sprinked the peaches (after arranging them in the pan) with about 1 tbs. tapioca.

Yummy!! This was a very delicious dessert, and using in-season plums and blueberries made it especially tasty. My only addition was @1 teasp cinnamon, which added to the already sweet dessert. Will definitely make this one again!

I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan. I used only plums, and added both vanilla and almond extract plus a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg in the batter. Even with the doubled recipe, the cake was perfect after 40 minutes of baking. I let it stand for 5 minutes before inverting onto a cookies sheet; a small batch stuck to the pan, but it still looked nice. The batter was light and fluffy and moist thanks to the butter and brown sugar; the tartness of the plums complemented the batter nicely. I would make again.

Great cake, but I get about 8 servings, not 12.  I used a mixture of plums and fresh apricots, and it was wonderful!  I also added some nuts. I layered the fruit on top of the butter/sugar mixture as directed, and then sprinkled chopped walnuts over the fruit, and then poured the batter over that.  This way, the nuts didn't interfere with the pretty presentation, but added a nice flavor and texture boost.  I've made this cake several times and it always needs to be baked for an hour, not the 40 minutes suggested.

This was delicious!! I did not use blueberries because I was just trying to find a way to use up a bunch of ripe plums. I followed the recipe exactly (although once I replaced the milk with buttermilk because I had no milk left) and it came out so nice- dense sweet cake, tart and delicious plums. My husband was not crazy about the plums (they get tart when you cook them) but he has a super sweet tooth and does not eat much fruit as it is. He did request that I make this cake without the fruit for his birthday (and frost it)- he loved that but it was way too sweet for me.

Tasted good...I was very disappointed, though, when much of the fruit top (and bits of the cake) stuck to the pan...I needed a good presentation for this dish and it just didn't happen.  I might try it again (not when I have to bring it to a party or serve it to company), but I don't know what I need to do differently to make SURE it doesn't stick.

I used 1/2 tsp of orange extract to flavor my cake instead of the vanilla, and also used a springform pan after reading several reviews.  Cake was extremely dense, but had a good flavor. Took nearly 60 minutes to cook completely. It wasn't really a failure, but I probably won't make this again.

This is a great recipe!  I did make some changes - more brown sugar and butter in the bottom of the pan and I didn't melt it together in the oven, just melted the butter in a bowl, added the brown sugar then spread in the bottom of the pan oh I added a few shakes of cinnamon to the brown sugar and butter mixture too.  I added cinnamon to the batter too.  I used a 9 inch pan but it was wayyyy too small, or maybe I had big plums, idk but next time i will use a bigger pan.  It was really delicious.  I used two different kinds of plums one dark and the other wasn't so dark but it was all good.  I had to bake it alot longer too - I think it was at least an hour.  But well worth the wait!

Excellent presentation. I used all plums and added about a tsp of lime zest plus two tbs lime juice to the wet ingredients and two tsp of ginger to the dry. Very nice consistency and flavor. Will make again for company.

This is a good recipe.  I added cinnamon to the batter.  I also spread the blueberries out among the plums as one other reviewer had stated the cake was hgher in the middle if you didn't.  My boyfriend loved it and both of his kids (ages 2 and 4) gobbled it up.  Now they don't ask what's for dinner, they ask what's for dessert!

Very lovely recipe.  I used an 8x8" glass dish and had to add 8 min to the cooking time.  I followed others advice and spread out the blueberries and the plums to avoid uneven shrinkage.  It flipped out beautifully.  Looked amazing and tasted wonderful.  We topped it with some fresh whipped cream with vanilla added to it, and it was wonderful.  Will definetly make again with various fruits.

What did I do wrong? This cake taste good, but almost all the plums and alot of the topping stayed in the pan when I turned it over. I used 2 extra tablespoons of flour as others did. I used frozen blueberries and doubled the brown sugar and butter for topping as others did. Help.

Fantastic!  It looks lovely for company, but it's simple enough to make for no reason at all!

I loved it! It tastes great, looks amazing! My springform pan leaked, but I tested it beforehand. To solve the problem I wrapped it up in aluminium foil. I melted the butter/brown sugar mixure separately before covering the pan with it. I also doubled it. I used butter because we had no margarine. I also added the 2 extra TBS flour (whole-wheat all purpose flour), after reading the other reviews. The peaches and plums had a wonderful moisture which they kept even 4 hours later (we are 4 hours later right now:) ) My dad was not impressed, but is he ever? Mom loved it, and so have i! A  keeper, to do it again and again. I will become creative with different fruits next time :)! (I uploaded my pretty cake photo)

I really liked this recipe and only made a couple changes based on what was in my kitchen. Instead of plums I used peaches, sweet cream butter instead of margarine, and cupcake tins for a cake pan. The first time I made it I put to much batter in the pan. 1/4 c works best depending on how much fruit is in the bottom. TO serve I put some whip cream on a plate, shaved the bottom of the cake to make it sit flat and was ready to go.

The cake was delicious.  Once the plums were cooked, they tasted like prunes...I guess I should have expected that.  I used a springform pan, but the butter and brown sugar leaked all over the oven.

We too added 2tbsp of flour to dry mixture and 1/4 tsp cinnamon also.  The cake was delicious.  My 8 yr old and 3 similar aged friends made two this afternoon and it was a hit by all!  For sure will make this again!

This was beautiful and simple.  Will recreate again for next week's entertaining. Will probably make suggested adjustments for lemon peel to adjust the slight excess in sweetness.

Delicious! The cake turned out perfectly. I used small purple plums and wild blueberries, added cinnamon,nutmeg and lemon zest to the cake batter.The 9"pan worked very well and I will be making this recipe again, that is for sure.I think it would work with other fruit as well.

I cut back on the white sugar and used a little over 1/2 a cup. I think a cake that is less sweet helps to bring out the taste of the fruit. I also substituted half of the flour with whole wheat flour. I also followed someone's suggested and mixed the blueberries among the plum slices. The guests loved this dessert, and with all of our plum trees, I will be sure to serve this again!

This cake was delicious. The only change I made was to sprinkle some cinnamon/sugar on top before baking...sort of an after thought when I realized there were no spices in the cake.  Next time I might 1/2 tsp cinnamon or nutmeg to the batter.  I used very ripe Italian plums (the oval ones) and just halved them.  The blueberry/plum combo was wonderful.  Would be great served with spiced whip cream as well.

This was a really nice moist cake and the fruits were cooked just right.I had pluot plums on hand so that is what i used.Mine turned out more purple ish in colour than pink but it still looked and tasted delicious! With every recipe i do,I have to lower the temp down a little.Baked mine at 325 because my oven really heats up.Took only 45 minutes to bake

I had a lot of plums that needed to be used, so I decided to try this. I left out the blueberries and used butter in the brown sugar mixture, but margarine in the cake part. Baked in 12 muffin tins, because I couldn't find a cake pan. It worked great! They don't come out of the tins perfectly, but still look very nice!

Simple yet very yummy.  I decreased the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup and I didn't put the brown sugar coating in the pan and it was still delicious.  I think I might add more plums and blueberries next time.

So easy yet all were impressed.  I did use more than four plums though.  I think that's because I had small plums.  Also, my plums were very ripe and after baking there was not much definition of each slice.  So it wasn't as pretty as the picture. I also used frozen blueberries.   Which were pretty much jelly when I was done. Still, it was pretty and so so so yummy.  I will make again and again and again.

This is a wonderful cake recipe. But I don't recommend making it without the fruit and margarine/brown sugar mixture. It would be too dry without it. Any fruit works well. I did mine with canned pineapple and plums, since the plums I had were a little soft they didn't hold up well when I cut them. I also substituted butter and added orange zest.  Overall, I was very satisfied!

Amazing. Mine needed about 15 min extra in the oven for the middle to set up, which make the edges a little crisp, but in a tasty way. I used plums (no berries). I plan to make it again with peaches or nectarines. Mmmm! This was a hit for dessert on Mother's Day with some vanilla ice cream.

Very tasty. I was able to use two large plums and no more to be able to include blueberries. This is an easy and very good basic cake recipe too that I'm sure I'll use with pineapple, cherries, etc. Thanks!

This is a nice cake with a lovely presentation.  I had four large too-tart black plums, and I wanted to use them up before they went bad.  It was a success - the sweet cake balanced the plums nicely.  It seemed to lack something, however, but I am not sure what it is.  The only changes I made were to use only plums and whole wheat flour and butter instead of regular white flour and margarine.  Maybe it needs more of the topping?  I will try that next time and update my rating if it improves.
