Hi, I got this recipe from my best friend and it is one of my favourites.  It is basically a big eclair, or an eclair casserole.  I had lost my recipe and looked on All-Recipes and was surprised to find it, but even more surprising was that it didn't get a ton of five star ratings!  I use French vanilla instant pudding mix.  Make sure the cream cheese is soft before you try to mix with the pudding.  I make the pudding and beat the cream cheese separate then add a little cheese to the pudding at a time to make sure it doesn't get lumpy.  It is so yummy when done right. Thanks for the recipe again.  S.F.

Absolutely spectacular.  The crust is basically a cream puff pastry recipe.  To save work with this, just get the Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry Sheets, place one in the bottom of the pan and bake according to directions.  It's perfect and doesn't get soggy. As others have stated, I have used french vanilla and white chocolate pudding mix. Any flavor that strikes your family's fancy will do. My toddler grandkids dive in and honestly are wearing it by the time they are done! You have got to give it a try. UPDATE: I had friends for dinner and wanted serving dessert as simple as possible. I bought Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry Cups, baked according to box directions. Filled with the pudding mixture, topped with the whip cream and drizzled the chocolate over all. Absolutely beautiful presentation.

I wish I could give it more stars!
Made for a dinner party last night and 9 people ate the whole thing.
I did add 1 pouch of vanilla sugar to base/choux pastry, used fat free cream cheese and skim milk for pudding mixture, whipped 2 cups of whipping cream with 1 pouch of vanilla sugar for cool whip (I don't like cool whip) and used 1 can of Hersheys chocolate syrup to cover the top, didn't do fancy pattern!
Found the pan really slippery and hard to put dough into, next time won't grease, used fingers to smoosh down.
Made it last night for church potluck, first dessert to go and everyone wanted the recipe! thanks!

I followed other reviewers advice and whipped the cr. cheese then gradually added the milk and finally mixed in the pudding mix which minimized lumps. Made this for a large gathering and everyone enjoyed it. Rich but not overly sweet.

My mother in law made something similar to this and I forgot to ask her for the recipe so I looked online. This recipe is wonderful! It is so easy to make. My husband loves it and so do the kids. It was a complete hit. I will make it again and again. -Shannon Missouri

This cake is amazing. It's sooo creamy and mouth watering. The problem is is you don't want to eat just one piece. Whenever this is made for events it is a huge hit! Everyone loves it and asks for the recipe. Here is a tip: When you are making the puffy pastry layer after you have mixed in the flour turn off the burner and let it cool for 10-15 minutes; then wisk in the eggs one at a time. If you leave your stove top on it will make it dry and doughy. The texture of the puffy pastry layer will be a thick stretchy liquid. IT SHOULD NOT BE DOUGHY AFTER EGGS ARE ADDED. Pour on very greased cookie sheet and spread with spoon. After baked it will be poofy and ridges; similar to german pancakes. This recipe is sooooo good!

Great recipe! Very easy to make and it tastes gourmet. I made the mistake of not using the mixer on my cream cheese before adding it to the pudding and it was a little lumpy. Best served very cold. It was a big hit at our Christmas party. Lisa Yates

When the cake came out of the oven, I started to wonder why it was named moon cake.  It was interesting to say the least.  There were peaks and valleys everywhere.  (I think I posted a picture if you're interested in seeing what I mean.) The cake part was almost spongey in texture but the topping was better.  I don't think that I will be making this again.

I've never received such a good response with any dessert like I did with this one. I made this cake for 4 guests and it was the topic of conversation for at least 10 minutes!:). Sooooo yummy! Tastes like an eclair. The only thing I would suggest if you make this is to whip the cream cheese first before u add the other ingredients to get out the lumps. (if you use the block of philadelphia)

Such a fantastic light recipe. It's a great dessert option when you don't want something rich and heavy. Every time I make it people ask me for the recipe. The only things I change are that I use real whipped cream and that I add an extra 1/2 cup milk to the pudding because the pudding barely covers the crust. Sometimes I also add crushed toasted almonds on top. But this recipe is really fantastic as is.

I had an ex-boyfriend whose mom always made this for him for his birthdays so one day I decided to surprise him with this and it was a hit! I had never made it before but he said it came out perfect. I used all chocolate pudding since that was his favorite instead of vanilla I think the recipe calls for.

I made this for my hubby's birthday. He loved it. I think that frozen whipped topping (in Oz we don't have this) must be cream so I used fresh cream and I also crumbled a dark choc flake over the top instead of topping. Was delicious! Definately do again.

Make it Diabetic friendly in a blink of an eye!Use sugar-free pudding and low-fat milk and cream cheese. Instead of chocolate syrup melt bittersweet/dark chocolate chips to drizzle over the top as they are lower in sugar. So delicious and easy. People love the diabetic version!

This is great! I get asked for this recipe every time I make it. I did make a few adjustments. I sometimes leave out the cream cheese because I have a hard time getting it to blend well. And instead of the chocolate syrup I use that chocolate shell syrup stuff and I feel it turns out a little better.

This is a fantasitic recipe. My whole family enjoyed it. I made it for my children's Confirmation and it was perfect choice the other reviews helped especially with the cream cheese. My only thought is to use chocolate Shell ice cream topping instead of chocolate syrup. Thanks for the recipe I will keep it handy.

A complete fiasco. I must have done something wrong because everyone else seemed to love the cake but I did not care for it. The consistency prevented me from tasting the cake. Now I'm stuck with a block of cake.

This was AWESOME! I'm going to use French Vanilla pudding the next time as suggested by a reviewer and also try chocolate pudding. I was concerned when the cake came out of the oven all puffy but it quickly went down. What an easy way to make a great dessert. Don't use fat free cream cheese because you can't beat the lumps out of it.

Though taste is OK this is nothing at all like the traditional moon cake except in outside appearance. I prefer using one of the many traditional Chinese fillings of which there are many types - and all of them better than using instant pudding.

I have made this recipe many times and is a favorite!! Have made this with banana cream and real bananas. Also made it with chocolate fudge pudding on the bottom and sliced fresh bananas with banana cream on the top. You can t mess this up. Use your imagination as it is very versatile and so yummy.!! Next is pistachio/pineapple.??

We did not enjoy this at all. The cake was like a dutch baby without the sugar. The pudding mixture was the only thing we enjoyed because of a few modifications and that is why I gave this three stars instead of one. This desert is not consistent and the toping doesn't compliment the cake well. Okay so the three stars goes to the awesome toping which is very much like a mousse. I made this again tonight using chocolate pudding and cream cheese. If you let the cream cheese sit before whipping it will not clump. Its worth it for the top but the cake part sucks.

YUM! Made this exactly as written (using a 13x9) baking dish. It was a little sticky trying to spread the batter in to the pan but I just coated my hands w/ cooking spray and that worked perfectly. Super simple to make yet pretty impressive and VERY tasty! Waaaay quicker than making eclairs/cream puffs but w/ all the flavor. I will def be making this again! Thanks for sharing.:)

Pretty pretty pretty good. I did has a few other reviewers suggested and put a layer of chocolate on top of the cooked pastry. Melted some chocolate chips (milk chocolate as that is my preference) with a little butter. I didn t measure but it turned into a perfect eclair chocolate sauce. I also didn t put the Hershey s chocolate syrup on top but only because I don t care for Hershey s chocolate syrup. The last change that I made was making whipped cream with heavy cream and using that instead of Cool Whip. Again just what I prefer.

One of the best things I have ever eaten. I have been making this for 40 years and was so happy to see the Recipe on this site. I make it exactly like this. PS. never try to make it with cook type of pudding.

Good recipe. After baking the crust it looked a little weird but it cooled then I finished the layering and it turned out beautiful. Even though I substituted sugar-free pudding mix everybody loved it.

I get compliments every time I make this! From my experience I would recommend letting your cream cheese and cool whip thaw. Also take your time and let the crust fully cool. This makes the assembly easy. I did use butter instead of margarine and shaved chocolate rather than syrup. I will continue to perfect this recipe since people will not stop asking me to make it!

Really good! My husband even said he thinks he wants this for his birthday cake instead of the traditional ice cream cake. By accident I bought only one package of pudding mix so I cut the rest of the "filling" ingredients in half too. It still came out great and everyone at the table agreed that two might have been too much. Next time I might mix in a couple tablespoons of Kahala to the filling for little extra kick. I made this recipe to go along with a book I read to my daughters "A Big Mooncake for Little Star" written by Grace Lin. My daughters loved both!

My husband and kids really liked this. He said that he wished the crust was a little crisper but other than that it was great!!

Absolutely amazing and very very tasty. Quite easy to make. Make sure to warm your cream cheese up a little on the counter. And if you keep on mixing it will eventually become smooth.
