The bacon and feta are perfect complements; simply adjust the amount of each to your taste.  Also, go easy on the salt as both the bacon and feta are salty already.   And thank you for the idea of shaking the asparagus and oil together in a bag.  Genius!  It eliminates the problem of "drizzling" the oil and not getting the vegetable evenly coated.   Why didn't I ever think of that?!?!

Awesome side dish. I didn't add any salt due to the bacon and feta. It's a keeper!

I prepared this for a side dish for Easter dinner.  When I went to try the asparagus is was gone!!!! I even made two patches.  I didn't even get to try it.  So that being said, it was a hit! I agree with another reviewer that 8 slices of bacon is way too much, so I would recommend decreasing.  In contrast to others, I did not use a bag to cover the asparagus with the oil (because didn't want another thing to clean and trying to save the earth).  I used a basting brush to coat the asparagus.  Have to try this again, so that I can actually taste it.

Nice addition to regular roasted asparagus!   I only needed one tablespoon of oil since I had a smaller thin bunch of asparagus. Great idea tossing it in a bag because I usually just drizzle the olive oil on my asparagus in the pan and end up with more oil than I would like. I particularly like the feta that once heated was warm, creamy and perfect with asparagus.

I liked the baking the asparagus, rather than steaming.  My spears were thin, so they didn't get mushy.  I only used 4 strips of bacon and that was plenty.
