Before making these cookies, I read the reviews and decided to make my own adjustments and the cookies came out perfectly!
Oven should be 350. Use 1 Cup butter, omit the shortening, use 2 EGGS and cream them with the butter, brown sugar and water. Follow the recipe as directed. Use 1 TEASPOON per cookie, they really spread out if you use too much batter. Make these adjustments and you will really be pleased with the results!

This was excellent. I used peanut butter chips and devil's food cake. They don't spread very much, so you might want to flatten cookies slightly if you are making balls with a scoop like I did.

EXCELLENT!  I followed reviewers' suggestion and used 1 cup butter instead of the margarine & shortening and 2 eggs instead of just one.  Also, I cooked it at 350 degrees for 9 minutes.  DELICIOUS!!!!!  Thanks for this recipe!  I finally hit jackpot after looking for so long!  And to think you use cake mix!

These cookies are easy to make and quite tasty. I used 2 whole sticks of butter instead of shortening and margarine. i also used regular sugar instead of brown. Dried cranberries instead of chocolate chips.

These cookies are great!  I added a little extra water and a few extra chocolate chips to suit my taste.  Really easy and stayed moist for 5-7 days.

These are delicious with the perfect mix of chewy and just a bit of crunch.  I've made cookies with cake mixes before that were ok, but these were a hit!  I made the suggested changes of using 1 cup of butter and 2 eggs and I baked them at 350 for 10 minutes.

I picked this recipe because wanted to get rid of a  German Chocolate Cake Mix that I bought instead of regular chocolate cake mix. I followed the recipe but added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of dried cranberries. These weren't chocolate enough for us. Super easy to do. If you stick with the shortening instead of all butter, the cookie will not spread out that much. Infact, after the first batch I had to smash them flat with the back of a measuring cup, because they stayed too round.

I did what others did and used an entire cup of butter (2 sticks) instead of half shortening. I also cooked them at 350 instead of 325 and had to cook them for like 10 minutes to get them properly lightly browned.  I did not have chocolate chips so I added a little less than 1/4 cup of chocolate hershey syrup. I think it thinned the batter a BIT too far but not sure.  The cookies are very flat when they cook and are chewy. Very good. Would definitely make again.

Loved the recipe and the only change I made was milk chocolate mini M&Ms instead of the semi-sweet chocolate chips.  It resulted in a much more colorful final product!!  These cookies literally disappear every time I make them!!

Nice texture. Moist. Very sweet. Made these because I had an extra box mix on hand, but I don't think I would buy a mix just to make these. I could definitely taste the cake mix. Loads of people at work loved these though.

Great and easy cookie. Went over well with everyone. I doubled this recipe with no problem. With this great of a cookie I suggest you do the same, as they didn't last long. Also try peanut butter chips for a different taste.

These are the WORST thing I have ever tasted!  I can't even believe how gross they are.  They are incredibly greasy and do not taste good.  Sorry to whoever submitted this, but I would never cook these again!

Well, I accidentally used devils food mix. That made them too chocolaty for my taste, but my boyfriend and his co-workers loved them! I did a add walnuts as well. I'll give it one more shot with the german choc cake and see if that's better. The four is based soley on my taste buds!

These cookies are genius!  They are tender yet chewy and have a very deep flavor for a "cheater" cookie.  Changes I made: I used a chocolate fudge cake mix, put in an extra egg yolk, some toasted pecan pieces and a heaping spoonful of cocoa powder.  I can't wait to try more variations...yellow cake with butterscotch chips, chocolate with mint or peanut butter chips...I could daydream about this for hours.

I prepared these as directed. The first batch out of the oven was undercooked and greasy, so I read reviews and discovered that many folks suggested baking at 350 for 10 minutes. This is absolutely required! The cookies were still a little greasy, and for the third batch I did not even grease the cookie sheet. I will not make these again as directed.

Some of mine were a little thin, some were thick as others have written. I skimped on the water and pre beat the egg as one suggested also. Not bad overall. Ease of starting with a cake mix is nice.

I am not much of a baker...I HATE measuring. I loved that this recipe required very little measuring. They tasted a lot like no bake cookies. I have made these several times and always get rave reviews.

We liked these cookies okay. Not a favorite, but not bad either. I decreased the water by a smidge and beat the egg before adding - that gave them plenty of height. (I read in the other reviews that they were flat.) Taste is reminiscent of no-bake cookies, and I think I like those better.

This recipie was so easy and quick.  I made these cookies as gifts this year and I'm already being asked for the recipie.  These are moist and chewy cookies.  They were a tad bit flat, but they were still tasty.
