The first time I made it I followed the recipe and it seemed like it was missing something. I increased the sugar and added vanilla extract and served it with strawberry cream cheese. It was excellent.

The bread is perfect just the way it is! Savory and rich chocolate. It isn' t not a sweet bread. If you want brownies make them!

This was delicious! I couldn't stop eating it! I did change it around a little by putting in two tablespoons of molassas. It was perfectly sweet. It's nothing like cake...it's bread so you can't expect it to be oozing with flavour. Definitely a new favourite!

Years back I had a savory chocolate bread in a fancy restaurant in Mexico. I was tickled to find this and with a few tweaks it was pretty close. I added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon & 1/2 teaspoon mild chili powder. I also reduced the salt to 1 1/2 teaspoons. This was so darned easy and went well with a pot of beef stew. BTW if you are looking for a dessert bread....this is not it..... nor is it supposed to be. Thanks so much for sharing Bowen.

Though I have yet to make this I love the idea the recipe conveys- a real chocolate flavour. Chocolate is not supposed to be sweet but rather rich. To heighten that appeal switch the sugar with some molassas and honey and add 70-75% dark chocolate (semi-sweet or unsweetened will do fine). If you prefer it sweeter after that mi a bit of cocoa with some honey and cream cheese and use as a spread.

Like the other reviewers I was looking to make this recipe into something it isn't: sweet. I added about a cup more sugar than the recipe called for and the bread still wasn't sweet. It seems like such a good idea--a yeast bread with chocolate baked right in. It works with peanut butter. I guess I'll have to keep trying.

This is similar to the bread served in a few steak house chains and Outback. I made a few small modifications. I used half white whole wheat flour and half AP and replaced the sugar with honey. I may add a bit of Mexican cinnamon and even some cayenne powder the next time I make it. Thanks for sharing.

This bread is wonderful! Tender and moist fragrantly yeasty and chocolatey! It is sublime toasted and spread with sweetened cream cheese. The only change I made was to use brown sugar instead of the white as I think brown sugar enhances chocolate flavor. Love love love this bread--thank you for sharing the recipe!

The bread did not come out the way I hoped. It did not rise nor was it as light and fluffy as I wanted. The flavor however was good. It had a soft sweet flavor.

Just baked this morning - terrific bread! Instead of making into rounds I divided the dough and put each half into a greased 9x5 loaf pan. Baked as directed and they came out perfectly. Crisp crust savory rich chocolate flavor. This is NOT a sweet bread.

I made this out of curiousity and it was good. I added chocolate chips which I liked because it added some sweetness as a contrast flavor. If anyone else decides to add chocolate chips - make sure there are none on the surface when baking. They burned pretty badly.

Found this recipe to be very bland. I agree with the other reviewers that something is definately missing.

By itself this recipe is probably too bitter for most peoples tastes.  It is not sweet.  It reminds me a bit of guiness quick bread.

I made this recipe and a basic challah bread recipe.  The slight sweetness of the challah bread was a nice addition to and relief from the bitterness of the coacoa and braided and woven together they made a perfect loaf for enjoying with an evening espresso.

The recipe is precisely what it’s stated to be; a chocolate bread that is not sweet.  It’s perfect with butter or cream cheese and a cup of tea or coffee.  It also makes a really nice ham sandwich (Westphalian or Black Forest).  I agree with one of the other commenters,  if you want sweet make a cake, brownies or muffin.
