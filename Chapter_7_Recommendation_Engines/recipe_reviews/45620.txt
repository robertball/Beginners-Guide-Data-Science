Okay folks - have made this twice, 1st time as the original recipe called for and the 2nd time, took into account all the reviews....  Used 1/2 cinnamon raisin bread and half french bread, added nutmeg, increased the eggs to 8 and the cooking time to 1 hour with the last 25 minutes uncovered!  Same amount of cinnamon...  Fed eight hungry BIG men who sang my praises.  This is definitely a keeper!!!

The flavor for this recipe was very good.  The one thing I would change the next time I make it would be to use a loaf of Pepperidge Farm's Cinnamon Swirl or Cinnamon Raisin Swirl French Toast Bread.  I would also cube the bread in one inch pieces as opposed to just keeping it in slices.  It is much easier to serve if the bread has been cubed.

I am having a New Year's Eve brunch party for my son's first birthday, and have been experimenting with recipes. This one is making an appearance!  It turned out great, especially thanks to the reviews.  The only thing I am going to do differently when I make it on Friday night is use 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/2 cup....there was a buttery film swimming underneath the bread.  We had to drain it, no biggie.  Per other's suggestions, I used Pepperidge Farm Brown Sugar Cinnamon French Toast Bread, cubed (since I will be feeding a large crowd).  Because of the bread, I omitted the cinnamon, except for a dash of cinnamon to the apple mixture.  I also omitted the raisins, personal preference.  I also soaked the bread cubes only in the egg mixture, instead of pouring it over.......I agree with the other reviewer, why would you want your apples swimming in egg?  Yuck.  This way worked great.....the casserole ended up sitting in fridge for 14 hours before being baked, (1/2 hr covered, 15 min uncovered) and the bread was PERFECT!  Puffy and moist, but not soggy.  Thank you for a fantastic brunch recipe!  I tried Creme Brulee French Toast also off this site, not nearly as good as this!
1/1/06 - this was a HUGE hit at the brunch!!

I made this for my students and it is absolutely delicious. The only thing I would do differently next time is put the bread in first like in some of the other recipes, then the egg mixture, and the apple-raisin mixture on top. The bread was very crispy and did not soak up the eggs entirely. I will make this again when my kids come home for Thanksgiving.

I made this recipe for brunch and it was very well received!  I used a loaf of raisin bread instead and omitted the raisins.  I also dipped each piece of bread in the egg mix before laying it over the apples.

I served this at a celebration brunch and there was nothing left!  Several people asked for the recipe.  I added a little nutmeg in with the apples and sprinkled a little cinnamon and nutmeg on the bread before putting it in the oven.  It seemed a little moist after baking uncovered for 5 minutes, so I left it in for about 10 minutes and it was fine.  I highly recommend this recipe!

Dust the top with powdered sugar and you've got a nice presentation too!  For those of you who had problems with egg moisture, make sure you pack the bread in.  Mine was so tight that it was puffed up when it came out of the oven.  I also substituted 1 cup of heavy cream for 1 cup of the milk.  It was delicious!  Enjoy!

I was so excited about this recipe but it didn't turn out like I'd hoped.  Too much egg I think.  I'm going to try it again but this time I'm going to soak the bread in the egg mixture first and then lay them on top of the apples and raisins.  That way it's only egg in the bread and not all around the apples. I'm hopeful for the next try though.  It's a great idea.

I have served this recipe many times and everyone raves. It's a nice change (or addition) to the usual buffet egg bake. 3/4 of the way through I pressed the bread down into the mixture with a fork, allowing it to soak up the syrup. I did that again when it was out of the oven cooling. It was more moist. YUM!!

this turned out much too sweet for my taste - too much syrup. the bread part was kind of bland compared to the apple/syrup mixture. i dont think i will make this again, unless i use only 1/3 to half of the sugar and add more spices to the bread mixture. if you like very sweet and a lot of syrup this would be a good recipe.

This recipe is awesome!! I've already had 3 people ask me for the recipe.  I read the reviews and followed some of the modifications.  I used Cinnabon Raisin bread but I also tried it with Sunmaid and they were both excellent. (I also reduced the amount of cinnamon and raisins added because of the bread)  I soaked the bread separately and then layered it on top of the apple mixture (I used Fuji apples) and I also uncovered the dish after 30 minutes to give it a nice golden brown top.  My guests went nuts....all I could hear around the table was mmmmm, ahhhhhh, ohhhh.  Thanks for this!!

I made this (with a few tweaks) as a special treat for my family for Spring Break. WOW! What a hit! Everyone said it was a keeper! I cut the brown sugar down to 3/4 cup, used Granny Smith apples, substituted Egg Beaters for 4 of the 6 eggs and cut the raisins down to 1/3 Cup. It turned out great, certainly not too sweet at all.
As someone else suggested I inverted the servings on the plate and that looked attractive. No syrup needed! My family of 6 (no teenagers!) ate about 3/4 of the pan for breakfast, just enough leftovers for our midnight snack!

Very delicious!! After reading previous reviews, I decided to use 1 loaf of Pepperidge Farm Cinn Raisin Bread, cubed and soaked in the egg mixture, then spread on top of the thinly sliced apples.  For the apples,I used Splenda brown sugar mix and reduced the quantity to 3/4 cup. Since I was using the raisin bread, I did not add any additional raisins. I did use 8 eggs instead of 6 and refrigeraged casserole overnight. The aroma while this was baking made my mouth water and it turned out perfect.  The hubby loved it.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Words cannot describe the taste of this!!  I used cinnamon raisin bread instead of the baquette and then omitted the raisins.  The blend of the cinnamon bread, spices, and apples were perfect!

I made this for my breakfast day at work and it was a huge hit! I tweaked it a bit to make it healthier and it still came out fantastic! Here are my changes: 1) used one loaf whole wheat cinnamon raisin bread, cubed and toasted at 450 for 10 minutes (stirred bread cubes halfway through toasting); 2) used 1 cup egg beaters and 2 eggs (didn't have enough egg beaters to fully substitute, but will probably use all egg beaters next time); 3) mixed bread with egg mixture in bowl and then poured into bottom of casserole dish. 4) Spread apple/raisin mixture and syrup on top of bread (the apples tasted like baked cinnamon apples & were amazing!); 5) Baked covered for 30 minutes...had to bake almost 45 minutes uncovered to get to the right texture; 6) Dusted with powdered sugar just before serving. Next time I'll definitely cut back the butter to 1/4 cup--the top looked like it was swimming in butter at first and I had to drain it and blot with paper towels. I think my cooking time will be greatly reduced with less butter too--I was trying to get it to dry out after blotting the extra off! All in all, definitely a keeper!

I made this for two separate weekends for 70 to 80 kids each weekend at a camp.  It was a hit! The apples and raisins made it so good.  I could have made even more. It was great because I could do it ahead of time.  
Tip:  Make sure your bread is dry or it can get too moist,if it's too moist it just tastes like bread pudding and that is great too.

This was very good and easy.  Left out the raisins, and I think I will soak the bread in the egg mixture before arranging, to make sure all the bread slices are soaked.

I just made this dish for Easter brunch, everyone loved it!! I did change it up a little after reading some other reviews. The only thing I changed was the bread, I used peppridge farm cinnamin swirl raisin bread, instead of the other bread w/ added raisins. I sliced up the bread, soaked it in the egg/milk mixture in a seperate bowl till it was all pretty much soaked up then spread it all over the top of the apples!!!Thanks so much for the recipe!!!!!! (it made me look like a good cook) :-))

This is one of my favorite brunch recipes. Everytime I've made it, it's been a hit, even with folks who don't normally like french toast.  I've found I like using a mixture of granny smith and golden delicious apples best.  To get each piece of bread adaquately soaked, use a little measuring cup to pour the egg wash over one piece at a time.  Otherwise, if any of the bread is too dry it will brown up too much.

I requested something to do with my poor Golden Delicious apples and this was suggested.  I made this morning for my coworkers and they gobbled it up!  The only thing I changed was I used 1/4 cup butter.  Will keep to make again.

Boy, oh boy, was this good!!  My kids absolutely loved this; so did my husband.  I used raisin bread based on previous suggestions; that was a great idea.  I also soaked only the bread in egg rather than pouring the egg over the entire dish.  It was yummy for sure!

I took a lot of reviewer's suggestions - thank you!  I used the Pepperidge farm cinn raisin bread (didn't add any more cinn or raisins).  I also saturated the bread - cut in cubes - before putting them on top of Granny Smith apples the night before.  I cooked for 30 minutes covered (still mushy) then 15 min uncovered, and the bread had indeed puffed up and dried out.  It was sweet, but not overly so.

Definitely a keeper!  I served this for dinner on a night when my husband was managing the kids for dinner.  I used apples, cranberries, fresh pineapple I had leftover and some chopped candied pecans (what the heck!).  My oldest son said it was 'generally awesome' and my husband said he had to fight the kids to save some for me to eat when I got home.  Love that you can prepare it ahead -- I let it soak for a couple of hours.  I followed other reviewers advice and cut down to 2/3 stick of butter.  Next time I'll try 1/2 stick of butter (1/4 cup), 2/3 cup brown sugar and whole wheat french bread to cut down on the sweetness a bit.

I've made this every year for three years for Christmas brunch - my family loves it!  I've always made it exactly as the recipe states and have never had a problem with soggy bread.  I always use day-old bread since it's drier, that may make the difference.

What a great, and yummy, breakfast!  Made this for Christmas morning -- easy to make and disappeared in a flash!  I used cinnamon raisin bread, but left the rest of the recipe exactly as is.  This served four hungry adults and there was only a very little bit left over.  I also cooked bacon and sausage in the morning to accompany this dish.  It was so good, I didn't even need butter, syrup or powdered sugar to dress it up!  Just serve it bottom side up and it's already topped!  I'll definitely make this again.

Pretty good recipe. I thought it would of been a bigger hit with my children. Definately good for Christmas morning, easy to prepare the day before.

This was good and easy to make.  Followed others advice and soaked Pepperidge Farm bread in the egg before spreading over apples.  Also cut sugar down to 3/4 cup and halved the butter.

I made this for a family breakfast and got comments such as "This is the best baked french toast I've ever had!" So, I consider it a keeper. The main difference that I made was I made my own cinnamon raisin bread in the breadmachine - very easy and about 1 1/2 loaves from the recipe I used yielded the perfect amount. In case anyone is interested - here's the bread recipe with some changes from the recipezaar: 1 cup water 2 T butter/marg 2 cups all purpose flour 1 cup whole wheat flour 3 T white sugar 1 T brown sugar 1 1/2 t salt 2-3 t cinnamon (depending on preference) 2 1/2 t yeast 1 1/2 cups raisins (soaked in hot water before hand and added at the "add in" beep from the machine) Put the bread on the sweet bread setting with light crust.  I made the bread and cubed it, then soaked it in the egg mixture I made without the cinnamon because the cinnamon was in the bread and I added a lot. I also did not add the raisins with the apples because the raisins were already in the bread. But I did include the cinnamon with the apples and brown sugar mixture. Some reviews give you different options, but I followed the recipe and put the apples on the bottom of the pan and then the bread on top. The apples kinda carmelized down there and made a wonderful syrupy part of the dish to spoon on top of the moist bread. I followed the refrigerating and baking instructions of the recipe and it turned out, like I said, fabulous. Will definitely make again!

Fantastic flavor. Might make a few tweaks next time though, since the apples were still kind of crisp and there was some extra liquid from the apples in the bottom of the pan. We had a similar recipe at a Bread & Breakfast in Wisconsin, and they cooked the apples in brown sugar on the stove top prior to baking. I would do that plus add a little dry tapicoa to the apples to absorb any excess liquid from the apples. Used Honey Crisp and Liberty apples (sweet and tart) from our recent trip to Wisconsin.

OMG, this is WONDERFUL!  Sooo easy to make.  I used 3 Granny Smith apples and the regular amount of butter.  The only thing I did a little differently, was melt the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon together into a glaze, so that it would be easier to mix onto the apple slices & raisins.  I also followed some of the other reviewers' advice and soaked the bread cubes (I just used regular French loaf bread) in the egg mixture overnight, separate from the apple/raisin mix in the baking pan.  Cooked it for about 40 minutes and 10-12 minutes uncovered.  I took this to a work function for Boss's Day, it was GONE in no time!  Everyone was asking me for the recipe and it got rave reviews.  Great recipe, I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was better in theory than in practice. I don't know why we didn't just love it. Don't get me wrong - it wasn't bad, per se. We like all the various ingredients. I used a hearty home made bread, the Amish White Bread on this website. The casserole tasted OK, but just didn't ring our bells. My daughter said she'd rather have just plain French toast with syrup than this, and I realized reluctantly that she was right. I'm sure it's a time saver when serving breakfast to a crowd, but as my family is small, I won't be making it again.

It was very enjoyable.  The next time I make this recipe I will mix the butter with the apples and raisins and then stir in the brown sugar, cinnamon mix.  I found it was clumpy and didn't coat well when the butter was mixed with the brown sugar and cinnamon before adding the apples and raisins.

Delicious!  The recipe worked exactly as written.  I was worried that the bread would be dry on top, because not much of the batter soaked in overnight, but the apples and egg mixture ended up making a sauce underneath the bread layer as it cooked.  When served, I poured a couple of spoons full of the liquid over each plate, and it was fantastic.  I think a garnish of thinly sliced fresh bananas would be a great complement as well.

I help to plan and prepare lunch for a group of pregnant women.  We look for recipes that are different and can easily be converted for the number of people we serve (sometimes 40 people).  I converted this recipe to serve 40.  When you are converting, you have to bear in mind that the system only converts the ingredient list - it does not convert prep time and Directions.  It took me about 2 hours to prepare but wasn't difficult (just time consuming)
Recipe Suggestion:  When you cover the french toast with tin foil, be sure that the foil is not actually touching the toast or it will stick when you are cooking it.  Or, alternatively you could oil or spray the tinfoil.
The people that ate the toast that I prepared loved it.  Most asked for the recipe.  
Many thanks to Justin.

loved this!..took a loaf of cinnamon raisin and cut slices in half along with maybe 6 slices of a plain french loaf since so many people said their center was soggy...i cut the milk amount to 1 cup and also melted the butter in a sauce pan and added the apples til they softened this made the mixture kinda watery but i think by doing this and cutting down the milk amount the bread was able to really absorb the egg and apple juices over night so that i had no problem with a soggy center

Awesome!  My kids loved it.  It was like french toast over hot apple pie.  Placing the bread over the apples keeps them from getting soggy overnight too!

I put the toasted cinnamon bread soaked in egg/milk mixture on the bottom and spread the apple/butter/brown sugar mixture on top. Left out the raisins. Baked it for 40 minutes covered and 10 minutes uncovered. Sprinkled with powdered sugar to finish...perfection!

I made three of these this morning for my office of 30 people.  I made 2 using the cinnamon-raisin swirl bread and 1 using the cinnamon swirl bread. This recipe is so easy to make and then I just woke up this morning, pulled the prepped casseroles out of the fridge and popped them in the oven. I cooked all 3 in the oven at the same time on 375 for 45 min. I took another's advice and uncovered them for the remaining 25 min.  PERFECT! I have gotten so many "This is Awesome" and "This is delish!" from my co-workers this morning. This recipe is definitely a keeper! I'm going to make this again and again. :)

I prepared this for Sunday brunch.  This was FANTASTIC!  The only changes I made, however, were to halve the butter (1/4 c was plenty!), add allspice to the apple mixture for richer "pie" taste, and I sprinkled the top with a little more brown sugar, cinnamon, and raisins. Delicious!  Will definitely be trying this for Christmas day as well. So easy and so good!

We loved this recipe.  With only 2 of us, we halved the recipe and it came out great.  I think I might add some pecans next time just for a variety, as it was great the way it was.

Pretty good. I used Pepperidge Farm whole wheat Cinnamon Raison bread and soaked the break in the egg mixture (instead of pouring the egg over bread. Make sure you make thin apple slices so that the apple cooks well. I think Granny Smith apples are best for this. Not a pretty dish, but sprinking powdered sugar after it comes from oven helps with the aesthetics.

I made this casserole for a family brunch Saturday, and it came out great, not a bit left. As some other reviewers suggested, I used cinnamon-raisin bread. However, my pan was larger than the recipe required and took 12 slices of bread (3 layered like shingles width-wise and 4 slices edge-to-edge for the length), so I almost doubled some of the ingredients (2 extra apples), but I kept the butter to 5 Tblsp (just over 1/4 cup).  Also, I made a savory casserole, as well, that had to bake at a different temperature, so I started this one in the oven 2 hours before my guests arrived. After it was done, I set it aside covered with foil, baked the second one and set it aside covered with foild, and baked some bacon on a rack in a pan. The bacon was just finishing as everyone arrived. The casseroles were still fairly hot, but I put them back in the oven to warm for about 10 minutes. Everything turned out great!

Super, quick and easy to make.  A little bit on the sweet side, might try reducing the sugar next time.  I dipped my bread in the egg mixture to make sure the bread was well coated and it worked. No problems with making it the night before and cooking it he next day.  Can't wait to make this for the next brunch.  A keeper.

I made this for friends and we all loved it!  I turned the bread over after saturating it with the egg mixture, then again in the morning a couple of hours before I put it in the oven.  I also substituted dried cranberries for the raisins.  It was the perfect brunch entree, and the side of scrambled eggs made with scallions and extra sharp cheddar cheese was a wonderful savory balance to the sweetness.  (Not a low calorie meal, however!) My friend asked for the recipe before she left.

This is a great recipe!! Absolutely delicious, all my guests raved about it, and it was very easy to prepare.  I don't know what the previous reviewer meant about sogginess, maybe it was prepared incorrectly because mine was not soggy at all.  You don't even need to add syrup because it is delicious on it' own.

Used a loaf of cinnamon raisin bread as suggested- good idea!  Also mixed the egg mixture with the bread before putting in the pan to avoid the siggies at the bottom.  It was good- not great.  If you love this kind of breakfast at a restaurant you might think this is worthy of 5 stars.  It certainly doesn't need syrup!

I made this for company this weekend.  I decided to make 1.5 times the recipe to ensure I had enough.  I made one batch in a 9x13 pan and another in an 8x8 pan.  I did everything as directed (serves 18 instead of 12) except I used 4 apples and only one stick of butter.  I also used 1-1/2 loaves of raisin cinnamon bread.  I put this together around 9 pm and popped it in the oven the next morning at 8 for 45 minutes covered.  I uncovered the pans and baked for 15 minutes and ended up raising the temperature to 400 degrees for another 10 minutes to get a nice crispiness to the top.

I thought it was sweet, but several of my guests had seconds and everyone talked about how great this tasted.  The larger pan was the soggier of the two.  I tasted from both pans and found I preferred the casserole from the 8x8, which was less soggy.

Served this with sausage links, orange juice and coffee.  I'll definitely have this again next time we have company.

Perfect recipe! Absolutely delicious! To lighten the recipe for calorie-counting reasons, I substituted fat free margarine for the butter, Egg Beaters for the eggs, and skim milk for the milk. This was a wonderful Christmas breakfast!

I've been making this for 6 years now at camp and it is always a big hit! The kids prefer that I leave out the raisins, they are not used to eating raisins in Europe! Go figure!  With or without the raisins this is a GREAT recipe.  Thanks!

Good. Very easy to put together.  I used SunMaid Cinnamon Raison bread and put it at the bottom with the apple mixture on top.

I love this recipe! The only thing I changed was cutting the bread into half-inch slices instead of 1 inch. This helped the bread become completely wet when I poured on the egg mixture.   Next time I will use about 1/2 to 2/3 less butter; there was too much at the bottom of the pan for my taste.

This was served at a very remote location in the California Sierras for an intimate gathering of ~200 campers.  Because of the scale, the birthday girl decided to substitute frozen peaches for the apples, and cranberries for the raisins.  It was heaven!  Everyone raved about it!  I've made something like this before that did not call for fruit but after making it a couple of times I invented the apple slices on the top to help keep the bread from getting too crusty to eat.  Generally, when the bread is on the top (unless you push it down like another review suggested) the bread gets too crunch to eat, especially for young kids.  The peach version is fantastic (and easier than peeling apples).  I don't think I'll go back to apples since this is so yummy!  
P.S. "ditto" on the "too sweet syrup" as mentioned in another review.  I'm trying the brown sugar not packed and the fruit on the top; maybe that will help.

This turned out beautifully... and I didn't prepare it the night before. I followed the advice of a couple other reviewers, having cut the apples (Granny Smith) into smaller chunks and mixing the melted butter with the apples before adding the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture. I also subbed walnuts for raisins and added nutmeg. I mixed the eggs, milk, and cinnamon in the same bowl as the brown sugar mixture, so what was left of that blended nicely, adding flavor to the egg wash and, thus, the french bread. Since I prepared it in the morning, I soaked the bread before arranging it in the pan, then poured the rest of the mixture over the bread. Finally, I baked it covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for 15. It was absolutely delicious with a very light drizzle of real maple syrup. OMG YUM!

Ok, this is very tasty, especially the apples on the bottom.  I cubed raisin bread and mixed it into egg mixture.  I also used only 5 eggs because I didn't want it too eggy or runny.  I also used pecans mixed in with the apples and then sprinkled on top.

I prepared a double batch of this recipe for a friend's baby shower.  It was delicious and all the ladies loved it.  Some even had seconds!  I used challah bread and braeburn apples, which worked well.

Made this for breakfast this morning and everyone had seconds. It was soooo good. Came out perfectly browned, flavorful and the texture couldn't be more perfect. Maybe is the altitude or something. After reading some reviews, I thought it was going to be mushy but I actuallly added about 1/8 cup more of milk as I wanted every slice to be covered. I followed the recipe exactly except I used only 1/4 cup of butter. I can't understand how some people might find this recipe bland!! This is a keeper and will be my favorite way of making fresh toast. It was so easy to put it together the night before and just pop it in the oven for 45 minutes. No stress!

This tasted good and was very convenient to prepare, but here's a problem that I didn't find in any of the reviews: the crust of the bread was tough when it came time to serve it, and a bit too chewy as a result.  Also, it didn't brown the way I had hoped, so it didn't look cooked, even though it was.  The next time I make it (I'm not giving up on it yet!), I'll take one reviewer's suggestion of putting it under the broiler for a little while, and see how that goes.  The dish didn't get the rave reviews from my guest that I was hoping for.  But there's always next time....

This was terrific!! My family loved it and I'd make it again, but I think I'll use 2 layers of bread and put an additional layer of the apple/sauce mixture in between! It was relatively easy to make and storing it overnight made it very convenient for guests!!

I brought this to a cooking club meeting. Everyone liked it, even the members' children. I liked that it was easy to assemble and that it can be made the night before then just put in the oven the next morning(great for company). Leftovers even reheated well the next day. I plan on making it again for my family and for holdiay breakfasts/brunch. Delicious!

Yes, the flavor of this is delicious but the presentation is a bit lacking.  The eggs don't really come up and around the bread and when it's baked it looks like a pan of bread slices!   I think it may need more liquid or something.

I haven't found anyone who hasn't been wowed by this dish--and so simple to prepare. I make it with egg substitue, 2 1/2 cups whole milk, eliminate the half n' half and since I use a raisin bread I reduce the brown sugar to 1 cup.   I also like that there is no need to serve butter or syrup with this.

Delicious! I followed the suggestion of others and used 1/2 cubed French bread and 1/2 cubed cinnamon raisin bread. I used 4 small Granny Smith apples which added a nice tartness.

This was wonderful! Made it for Christmas breakfast and the convenience of preparing it the night before was great...just popped it in the oven first thing in the morning. It was delicious and I didn't use syrup on mine. The only mistake I made was buying apples that were on sale instead of the Grannys...and I know better than that. Will definitely use Grannys next time. This one is a keeper!

I tried this after reading all the reviews but was still not happy enough to use it again.  The bread was way too mushy & it didn't have enough egg for our liking.  The flavors were there but I don't have time to keep adjusting things to get it the way we would like it.

I made half the recipe using two medium size apples and left-over butternut squash bread I had made.  I’m not too crazy about the raisins, so I put in less than requested.  If your bread is fresh, dry it out in the oven so it will absorb the egg mixture or your dish will be too wet.  Also, I cut the bread into cubes for easier serving and then added them to the egg mixture to make sure they absorb the egg mixture.  It smells wonderful and tastes great.

Good, but not great. The apple part was delicious, but the bread part was soggy and lacked flavour. Maybe it needs more spices... Per other reviews, I used less butter and sugar and put the apples on top of the bread.

We loved this - and it's hard for me to find a breakfast recipe that everyone will like. I did omit the raisins, and put the apple mixture on the top rather than on the bottom but otherwise I followed the recipe as written regarding measurements etc, we'll have this again!

I made this over the weekend using some leftover oatmeal bread.  I also followed the advice of others and cut WAY back on the butter (for the half-recipe I made, I used 2 tablespoons).  I also put the apple-raisin mixture on top of the bread to allow any extra juicy yumminess to soak down into the bread.  It turned out REALLY GOOD!  A great cross between baked oatmeal and french toast, and certainly a perfect way to start a brisk day.  My husband and son are already asking me to make it again. :)

Although this was very good, the caramel sauce on the bottom was to saucy. It would have been five stars if that sauce was just a little thicker

I used a loaf of cinnamon raison bread instead of french bread and threw in some chopped pecans.  Otherwise I followed the recipe. I made it Christmas morning and was so yummy.  I did a lot of cooking this Christmas and this is the best site for recipes. I didn't make this the night before, totally forgot, but it came out great anyway.

This was excellent. I made it Christmas eve night to bake for Christmas morning. It was an easy breakfast and I substituted dried cranberries for raisins to make it more seasonal. It tastes much like bread pudding and does not need any added syrup. When I served it, I spooned servings so that the apples and cranberries topped the "toast" layer. It looked lovely on the plates.

Based on other reviews, in order to cut down some fat, I used 3/4 C brown sugar and only 1/4 C butter. Also, I used a loaf of raisin bread from the bakery section of the store - I think the result was great. I took each bread slice and soaked it for 1-2 minutes, before laying over the apples (rather than pouring the egg mixture.) Midway through making this recipe, I realized it was supposed to be refrigerated overnight. I went forward with it and the french toast turned out totally fluffy and moist - so I don't actually know what the benefit of sitting overnight would be. The flavor was great, though the vanilla was a bit overpowering and I will reduce a bit next time. I was craving seconds by lunchtime! I kept this in the fridge for almost a week and had it for breakfast, and it never lost its flavor or texture. This would be delicious as a dessert, too, with vanilla ice cream and a hot brandy sauce. Yum! Will make again, thanks for sharing!

Yummo!!!  I'm not sure about some of the other reviews but I had no problems with this recipe.  I tried it exactly the way it was written to *see* for myself how it turned out.  The only thing I omitted was vanilla because I had none and I added a bit of nutmeg and probably more cinnamon then it call for lol.  Other than that, that was it!  It was sooooooooooo yummy!!!!  OMG, I couldn't get over the taste!  Totally not too sweet which I kinda worried about with the brown sugar and apples.  I even splashed it with maple syrup afterwards but didn't need it.  I did cook this at 200C for 40 minutes uncovered.  I don't like my French Toast dried out, not how it should be, so it was perfect; moist and spongy ;)  I also let it stand the extra 5 minutes, could have stood longer only cause it holds the heat.  The other thing is FYI NZers: I only used 24 slices of French bread cut between 1-1.25 inches in thickness.  I think our French sticks must be denser cause I weighed out a pound but was too much.  Totally recommend giving this one a go ;)

Very good and pretty easy and quick.  I used french toast bread, but really any plain or sweet bread would work.  I also added fresh ground nutmeg and vanilla bean.  LOVE that you can prepare the night before, and I actually think that is the key to this dish- It gives the bread time to soak everything up and I think resulted in a much more even texture than if you baked it right away.  I was concerned it was going to be soggy, so I may have baked it a few extra minutes because of that and it was PERFECT.  Could easily be scaled down and made in a loaf pan.  Great way to feed a lot of people and re-heats well.

Very east to make, but it came out of the oven "wetter" than I thought it should. I let it stand for the recomended time before serving hoping some of the liquid would absorb or thicken up, but it didn't. Better texture the next day. Tasty though. Be sure to use "baking apples" so they get soft. My apples stayed a little too hard and didn't absorb the liquid. vk

Casserole was just so-so, it was very sweet and I used only 1/2 of the sugar as recommended by other users.  It was good with cinnamon raisin bread, but that did not affect the sweetness, the apples just didn't cut it.  Will likely not make again real soon.  Have had better recipes.

This dish was okay, nothing extraordinary!  I did cut the cream cheese in half since so many others thought it had too much, and I used lowfat half and half.  I think some vanilla would make this dish better and possibly some cinnamon/sugar sprinkled on top.  Another option would be to sweeten the cream cheese.  It definitely needed the extra maple syrup on top to give it some flavor and sweetness!

This recipe was great! It even impressed the picky eaters! I used regular white bread and it was still delish! I also dipped each piece of bread to ensure an even flavor.

definetly will make this again and again! ;)

I made this recipe for New Year's day brunch.  It was a huge hit with my guests.  I omitted the raisins since I really don't like raisins.  the pan I used was a little smaller than what the recipe called for so I overlapped the pieces of bread in the pan.  I also dipped the bread in the egg mixture before puttin in the pan so all the bread was coated and not dry.  This recipe comes out nice a crunch on the outside and was very moist on the inside.  I used Granny Smith apples as other reviewers suggested.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

this was so good and easy, not to mention super-cheap to make. i made it with cinammon raisin bread, which was a bit too sweet for me, but i can't fault the recipe because it called for regular bread.  next time, i'll use regular french bread and perhaps throw some cream cheese chunks in it to cut the sweetness. thanks for sharing!

I made this for a bunch of friends. It was by far the most popular item at my brunch! A friend suggested that I first dip the bread in the eggy milk liquid first before putting it down over the apples. Also, she suggested that  I dump the eggy milk mixture over the bread and apples once I dunked the bread. That made sure all the breads were well saturated with the eggy mixture. Also, I used thinly sliced cortland apples. The apples didn't come out mushy at all. And finally, I decided to omit the raisins as I am not a huge raisins person. All in all, it was really yummy and very easy to make. I would definitely make this again for a big group of people.

The flavor was good but the bread turned out mushy on the bottom.  If I were to make this again, I would reduce the milk.

Wonderful!!!  I also used the pepp. farm bread also except I used a whole loaf and didn't use the crust.  I also used 9 eggs.  I think not using the crusts helped make it look more pleasing.  Also, using more egg made the bread puff up and taste very light airy.  Definately a keeper!

I reduced brown sugar to 3/4 cup, omitted raisins, and used regular white bread (dried in the oven approx. 15 min). Ended up w/ 3 layers of bread, but I dipped each slice in egg & milk mixture before layering. Result: top layer a little crispy, middle layers quite moist but not soggy, and yummy apples! Tasty -- kids & adults enjoyed it! Will make again!

I have made this for Christmas morning two years in a row. I think it is just delicous! Instead of only pouring the egg/milk mixture over the bread, I soaked the bread in the mixture for about a minute. Then poured the rest on top. This year I cut the recipe in half, but cooked it for the same amount of time. It was just enough for two hungry adults.

I made this for out-of-town guests and it was yummy!  Instead of raisins, I used dried cranberries and I made sure to soak the bread with the egg mixture before I put it on top of the apples.  It was quite good - not mushy.  Served with a side of bacon.

Good flavor, but mushier than I had expected.  I even cooked it for 13 minutes longer to help dry it out...no such luck - still mushy.  Very similar to bread pudding.

I served this on Easter for brunch, and had hoped it would be a top ten recipe for me, but I wasn't as pleased as some of the others were.  My only complaint was that the bread was too thick. I did like the easy prep of making the night before, and putting in the oven the next morning.  The flavor and moistness were perfect. I will try this recipe again with a thinner cut of the baguette.

This was a dish i served at Easter brunch. Everyone thought it was delicious but i think i might have preferred it if i had put the apple mixture on top.  It might have helped with making the bread more flavourful and moist.  I found that some of the apples were stuck on the bottom despite my spraying the pan very well with cooking spray. All in all though, I think it was a hit and i will make it again in the future.

I belong to a mother of preschoolers group and I had to bring in a casserole.  It was easy to make the night before and made the morning easier being that I only had to put it in the oven.  Lots of great things were said at the meeting and tons wanted the recipe for future use---It was great!!!

This was really good! I halved the entire recipe as it was only going to be my daughter and I eating this today.  I wish I would have baked it for a few minutes longer as the french toast was a TAD on the mushy side...but what did I expect from halving it?:) I used a Granny Smith apple, which countered all the "sweetness" and instead of raisins (none available) I added some chopped pecans. When serving, I inverted the toast onto our plates and no syrup was needed. This is a great way to start the day...so I'll be making the WHOLE recipe next time. Thanks Justin!

Good flavor.  I think you could reduce or even eliminate the butter and just toss the apples and raisens in the brown sugar and cinnamon and it would still work.  It was sweet, but you can use Granny Smith apples to balance that if you aren't a big sweets fan for breakfast.  Just think cinnamon roll and know it is about one notch less sweet than that.  I can't wait to make it for guests!

This is very good, but it seems to be missing something.  Perhaps next time I will tear the bread into pieces and soak in the egg mixture overnight, then put on top of the apples and bake.  Dried cranberries or blueberries would be tasty, too.  Great recipe for company or kids!

I had this recipe years ago Thanksgiving morning with my sister-in-law's family. I finally made it this year. I reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cup. After I poured the egg mixture over, my bread was far from soaked. I separated everything out again, arranged the bread in the pan, poured the egg mixture over, and let it soak for half an hour. Then I flipped the bread, put the apple mixture on top, and continued as instructed. We thought it was very good, and my husband said it was even better the second morning.

I made a few minor changes, but this was fabulous! Instead of using a French baguette, I just made some white bread in my breadmaker and cut it to about 1-inch thick pieces. Then, I used 8 eggs instead of 6 (tried 6 orginially, just wasn't enough) and I baked it for 50 minutes covered, then 7 more minutes uncovered. Best French toast I've had in AGES, maybe EVER!

Actually, I've never made this with apples and raisins, but it's ACES with peaches!  Like others, I add a little nutmeg with the cinnamon, and I've used half-and-half instead of milk.  I find it works best when the bread is packed tightly on top - it absorbs virtually all of the egg mixture, and I try to make each piece of bread about 2-3" square, to aid in serving.

On the rare occasions when I have some left over, I find it's almost as good the next day.  This has got to be my favorite of all the recipes I've found here!

Used Texas Toast without raisins in one batch which I really liked. Used raisin bread in another which also received high praises. Next time will take the middle road and try cinnamon Texas Toast and raisins. Soaked the bead first as suggested. Delicious!!!

I will make this again and again.  It was easy and quick to prepare and super delicious.  I've made a plain French toast casserole before which was yummy, but we really loved the addition of the granny smith apples.  The store was out of French baguettes (it was christmas eve) so I used a Vienna loaf. I was out of vanilla and still It turned out perfect.  I'm not sure why a 1/2 cup butter was needed. I'd use less next time just to keep the calories down (right).

I never write reviews; compelled after that amazing meal. Read other reviews before making and noticed suggestion to put apples on top instead. That's what we did and it was absolutely awesome. Next time will try 1/2 apples on bottom, then bread/egg, then rest of apples on top. Maybe add an extra egg if it's not covering enough of apples to soak before baking.  We added top with 1/2 & 1/2 to help soak apples a bit more before baking. Served with side of bacon (and beer...) and it was a perfect finish to a long day. Breakfast for dinner!

This is a wonderful, easy, delicious recipe.  I made it for a women's group potluck brunch and everyone raved about it.  I made 1 1/2 of the recipe and put in a larger baking dish.  Other than that, I made as written.  I wouldn't change anything.  The slices of baguette were perfect portions for the potluck.  Yes, it was juicy but the juice was from the brown sugar and made an awesome syrup for the french toast.  The bread absorbed all the egg/milk mixture and none of the bread was dry.

Easy to make and delicious.  I used regular whole wheat sandwich bread because that's what I had on hand (cubed to make serving easy with 2 kids), and I omitted the raisins.  Put this in the oven while it was preheating so I could go back to bed while breakfast cooked.  Baked for about 40 minutes covered then another 5-10 uncovered and it was perfect.  This is a sweet breakfast - great for an occasional treat for the family.

I used 4 eggs instead of 6,chopped figs instead of raisins, & increased the cooking time by 10 minutes (at 5,000 ft). Don't forget to spray the foil with cooking spray before covering your dish.

I thought this was easy and tasted very yummy!  I read the reviews, but decided to follow the recipe as is and it turned out perfect.  I used the french bread and cut them 1 in. thick and everything was moist, but not over soggy.  My family can't wait for me to make it again.  I will admit it is quite sweet, so I may cut back on the sugar, but that is a personal preference.  Overall an excellent recipe.

We swapped out raisins for cranberries. It had a good flavor but it was a little wet and custard like for my family's tastes. They liked the crispy top of the bread but the part just over the fruit was a bit soggy. I baked it for longer than it said to but it didn't help.  They asked me to make my regular French toast next time but cook the apple cranberry mix on the stove and pour it on top. So at least they liked the flavor if not the texture.

Great recipe! Tasted amazing! The whole family really enjoyed it. However the next time I'm going to try to cook it in a shallow dish. Some of the bread was a soggy in the middle. My husband loved it but I wasn't as fond of the soggy bread.

I made this dish for an early morning meeting and it turned out great.  I used cream instead of milk, and I omitted the raisins and used half the cinnamon because I used the cinnamon raisin bread.  I also soaked the bread in the egg mixture before placing it over the apples.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

Served this for Easter Brunch and people did enjoy this.  Very easy to make and we follow the suggestions by soaking the bread (did the 1" cubes")and used the cinnamon swirl bread. Will use this again.

Simply divine!  The only change I made was using egg bread from the bakery.  I cut it into large cubes and made sure each was drenched in the batter before layering over the apples.  We ate this for New Year's Day and everyone had large second servings!  I think this will be my New Year's Day brunch meal going forward.  Great recipe!

Just leave out the raisins or exchange for dried apricot or craisins.  Also make a topping sauce of squirtable cream cheese and brown sugar to decorate the top.  Fed 300 ladies at the Circus Breakfast.

Wow. Is this GOOD!

I had to cut the recipe in half for my family. 9x13 was just too big, but it
divided in half well. The only thing different I did was use half of a loaf of day-old homemade Eggnog Quick Bread. That had plenty of nutmeg, so I didn't add any to the egg. I used a Granny Smith for the apple/fruit part of the recipe. I did add cinnamon to both the fruit mixture and the egg mixture.

This is FABULOUS. I'll be sure to make this again for sure.

Very Tasty.  I tried to make a bit healthier and I substituted Pepperidge Farm Whole Wheat Swirl Cinnamon Raisin bread.  I also only used 1/4 cup of butter.  The recipe was still very good and I would make this way again.  However, I have made this recipe with the full 1/2 cup of butter and regular Cinnamon Raisin (not whole wheat) and I must say it is better that way.  I guess it depends on if you feel like being a little naughty or not.  I did quickly soak bread in the egg mixutre prior to layering onto the apple mixture and poured the excess over the bread afterwards.  This assures it is not too dry.

This is so delicious!  I used whole grain french baguettes and Splenda/brown sugar blend to make it a tad healthier.  I used some of the suggestions from others and soaked the bread first.  I like the fruit mixture on top and tried this the 2nd time making it, but the bread burned on the bottom this way--hopefully due to the oven I used--old and not mine!  I will make this again and again!

Wow!  Absolutely delicious!  I've made this casserole many times already because it's ideal when you have guest staying the night.  Just pop it in the oven and enjoy the morning coffee and conversation while it bakes!  Love it!!!

This was a big hit at my Christmas Day brunch.  I followed the reviews that suggested getting Pepperidge Farm Brown Sugar Cinnamon bread and cubing it.  Also skipped the raisins based on personal preference.  Use lots of apples!  I thought it would be too much, but could have used more.

I halved the recipe and it tasted and smelt great - not very pretty, though! I soaked the bread first per the other reviews and left out the butter by mistake, but didn't miss it at all. It was a great way to start Christmas morning and the leftovers were just as good!

Read the reviews before making this recipe.  Based on the reviews, I made a half-recipe in the same size pan, arranging the fruit around the bread so the bread would soak up the egg mixture.  I couldn't figure out how the bread could soak up the egg mixture when placed on top of the fruit.  Anyway, what do they say about planning ahead?  I didn't make my planned trip to the grocery store, so ended up using peaches and dried cherries (what I had) instead of apples and raisins (which I still want to try).  I also did not put the additional cinnamon into the egg mixture; just sounded like a LOT of cinnamon...  So after all that, the bottom line is that this was good, even with the substitutions.

Loved it! I did cut down the butter and added just a bit more vanilla. I also left out the raisins and added pecans instead. I did not overnight the dish so I soaked the bread in the egg mixture separately. The top turned out crunchy and the inside creamy. Both my husband and I really enjoyed this.

This recipe is great. I found it a few years ago and have been making it every year for our big Thanksgiving weekend family get togethers. Everyone loves it. Only one suggestion, make sure when your pour the egg over the bread you wet each piece of the bread with the egg mixture or else it will be a bit dry.

I made this using cinna-raisin bread, which was soaked in egg mixture before layering on top of the apples, per other reviewers' suggestions... I had to bake the casserole for about 75 minutes for it to properly puff up and brown (but I think that's due to my ancient, tiny electric oven), and the french toast part came out great. The only drawback was a lot of liquid cooked out of the apples, which didn't affect the taste at all, but it didn't look very appetizing as I made this for a potluck so the baking dish was also the serving dish (clearish liquid could be seen pooling around the edges of the pan).  If I had been able to immediately cut and serve this on another dish, it wouldn't have been an issue, so for the next potluck I'll just cook the apple filling first before assembling the casserole. I only used 2 tsp vanilla and probably 3x as much cinnamon as the recipe called for, just per my own taste, and it was very tasty-- I will definitely make it again.

I didn't make this exactly as listed, so it might be a 5 star recipe and I don't know it.  I used regular french bread instead of baguettes and didn't have room for all of it in my pan, but still used all the eggs...so it ended up kinda mushy.  The taste was great, though.

We had our best and dearest friends stay over with their two girls and I wanted to find a recipe that would be a sweet treat for the girls.  This recipe was the perfect solution (although I did alter it quite a bit).  Our guests are early risers so being able to make this the night before was crucial.  I simplified the recipe and used a can of cinnamon apple pie filling I had in the pantry.  I used cinnamon bread cut into chunks (I didn't use the whole loaf either...maybe a little over half).  I followed the rest of the recipe as listed, and thought that the bread soaked up a good portion of the liquid so I added another 2 eggs and a 1/4 cup milk.  I set the dish out a good 20 minutes before I put it in the oven and baked it about 40 minutes covered and another 10-15 minutes uncovered.  The top had a nice golden brown appearance and a little crunch to it and the bottom was soft and sweet with the apple pie filling on the bottom.  The girls and their parents loved it!  Thanks!

So easy and so delicious.  Like other suggestions, I used cinnamon, raisen bread and tore into big pieces.  I also dipped each piece in the egg mixture before placing on apples and poured rest of mixture on top of bread...It was great and made the house smell wonderful as it was baking.

This was perfect for Christmas morning. I followed the suggestion of some of the other reviewers and saturated the bread (which I kept in slices) before putting them on top of the apples and pouring the rest of the egg mixture over it. Someone else also suggested cooking it covered for 30 minutes and then 15 min uncovered, and that worked out very well - I thought it came out perfect..

This was great, although a little sweet for my taste.  Maybe I shouldn't have packed the brown sugar.  I'll add less sugar next time.  I added some salt to the egg mix.

This is simple to fix and tastes wonderful.  I increased the recipe to feed a large number of people and everyone wants the recipe.  Well worth trying.

This casserole was such a hit at my daughter's birthday brunch!!!  I swear I could have eaten the entire recipe myself, I loved it that much:)  I used Pepperidge Farm French Toast bread and ommitted the raisins.  For the apples I used HoneyCrisp, which were just perfect for the recipe.  I also cooked it a few extra minutes without the foil and it was not soggy at hall, perfectly dense and moist and not overly sweet--I can't say enough about it!

My MOPS (Mothers of Preschoolers) group had a fit over this recipe!  I am now required to bring it every time it is my turn to host brunch.  I also passed the recipe to my Dad and all his friends love it too.  If my Dad can prepare it, then it has to be easy to fix.  My review:  Great taste and easy to prepare!  :-)

This receipe was great and I plan to use it for Christmas morning breakfast.  Easy to make for a group or just family.  If you are not a big raision fan you may want to skip them in your receipe, but they are the key ingredient to pulling all the flavors together.

The French Toast Casserole is very good.  When having lots of people over night it is a simple, easy recipe!  Don't forget the syrup for those with a sweet tooth!

I made this the night before so all I had to do was put it in the oven the next morning.  The bread was just too soggy and never dried up.  It was too mushy to eat.  The next morning, I put it in the oven again to dry up and it still never dried up enough to eat.  Such a shame, because the ingredients go together so well.  Perhaps, I did something wrong! I am going to try it again, but with 1/2 as much egg mixture.

I used a one lb Challah bread instead of the french bread.  and light on the brown sugar. This was such an easy success, fixed it the night before, just popped it in the oven in the morning and everyone loved it.  Leftovers were good right out of the fridge with a little whipped cream, great recipe.

Quite a disappointment after the good reviews.  I made per instructions and ended up with dried pieces of baguette at the top.  Definitely soak the bread instead of pouring over if you are going to make.

Delicious! I didn't have time to make it the night before but made it in the morning ensuring all the bread was soaked and cook as per instructions.  The only thing I would change next time is to cut  back a bit on the sugar but that is a personal preference.

This one was pretty good. I used Fiji apples which produced a lot of juice. I plan to use Granny Smith next time. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and added more eggs, cinnamon raisin bread and a mixture of evaporated milk and whole milk. I used Penzey's Apple Pie spice which is a mixture of different cinnamons, nutmeg and cloves in lieu of the other seasonings. I also put in raisins. Delicious!

We all loved this casserole.  I did make a change.  Instead of the bread that  it called for, along with a measurement of raisins, I just made it with a loaf of raisin bread.  It came out delicious!  I will definitely make it again

I made this on Christmas Eve for Christmas Day to make life easier for myself and I was so excited about it. I made this exactly as written. After baking it Christmas morning I was a little disappointed at the results. The flavors were good and it tasted okay but the apples were a strange consistency. They were mushy and flavorless. The actual toast was delicious! Next time I make this I'm going to cook the apples on the stovetop to get a Carmel -Apple texture/taste and use that to to the French toast casserole.

Just finished making this at work and it was a hit! Had a few people ask me for the recipe. I consolidated a lot of other reviewers ideas. Here's what i did:

Use 8 eggs instead of 6; 
Add a 1tsp of Nutmeg to egg mixture; 
Cut applies in cubes instead of slices; 
Place raisins in a bowl and pour boiling water into the bowl.; Let stand for 5 minutes to plump up. Then drain water.
Use 1" cubes of bread; 
Cooked covered for 35 minutes, then uncovered for 25 minutes; 
After cooking add chopped pecans; 
Once cooked and cooled for a few minutes, run a knife around the edges of the pan and flip over into another pan or serving plate. Make sure to heavily grease the pan so the butter/sugar mix doesn’t stick to the bottom.; 
Dust with confectioners sugar for presentation

I forgot to make it the night before, so I cut the bread into chunks instead slices and let it soak in the egg mixture while I prepared the apples.  Still turned out delicious with the bread not too wet and not too dry.  Baked at 350 for 30 minutes covered and 15 minutes uncovered.  Will make again.  Next time I will add pecans or walnuts.

I made 5 casseroles for Christmas morning, I wasn't sure about this one (not a fan of raisins) but this one turned out great. I loved it and so did everybody else. I made it exactly as written and I will make it again, for sure!!

I used 3 Brothers gluten free bread and as I didn't have raisins I used low sugar cranberries.  I added the cranberries to the butter and brown sugar and 1/8 cup brandy to a pan and simmered on low for five minutes before adding the apples.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon cloves and 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice with the cinnamon (Saigon).   The directions were spot on and it was a big hit at work.  I drizzled maple syrup on the top, but do wish I'd had a little whipped cream to garnish.  Excellent!

I would give this six stars if I could.   Cut butter back to 6 T and brown sugar to 3/4 c. My French bread fit in perfect rows.   It was the best overnight French toast I've ever made in my 50+ years of cooking.

Loved it! Made a few changes....less sugar, cooked sausage and mixed with the apples and raisins. Soaked whole wheat sandwich bread and then poured over dish.

Did not read instructions clearly before starting, so this was made right before we wanted to eat it - no refrigerating. Oops! Turned out great with a couple small changes to compensate for that.

To help them "soak up the sauce", I soaked each piece of bread in the egg mix for a few seconds before putting it in the pan, then pressed the tops down with a fork before pouring the egg mix over top. This was with a proper french baguette - crunchy crust and all.

Very good. Diced apples, and cubed bread.  Reduced cinnamon by half.   Stirred cubed bread in with egg mixture and then spread over the apple mixture.  Followed other reviews and used 1/2 French baguette and 1/2 cinnamon raisin toast.

I made this for my daughter's boyfriend for our family's Sunday brunch. It was excellent! I have made other breakfast casseroles before but adding the apples and raisins really add wonderful flavor and a sweetness that you don't even need to add syrup. I will be making this my "go to" casserole from now on! It was awesome. Making it the night before makes it very easy to prepare the next day! Love it!

It has good flavors, but not exceptional.  If you are feeding a hungry group, count on it serving 7 - 8, not the 12 it states.

This was the first time I've made this recipe.  We were having friends over for a brunch.  I made the original recipe and didn't change a thing.  Everyone LOVED it.  I found it so sweet with just the apples and raisins that I didn't want to ruin it by putting syrup on it.  Great dish!

My family loves this recipe.  I have made it a few times but still haven't figured out the right apples to use.  I'm a beginner in the kitchen so I wish the recipe would have specified what apple to choose.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used Sara Lee cinnamon raisin bread and cubed them and tossed them in the egg mixture instead of pouring it on top. I think the flavor was good, I'm not sure if I didn't cook it long enough but the bread was kinda soggy and there was alot of liquid still in the bottom with the apples. If I tried this again I would probably not pour the excess liquid in the casserole after tossing the bread in the egg mixture. It cam out too wet. But over all I love the idea and the flavor.

Pretty great. But I have some hints if you're just making it for a family of four like I did. The best way to get a great, slightly lighter, casserole that can satisfactorily feed 4: 1) Grease the bottom of a 9X13 thouroughly with 1 TB butter 2) Combine two beaten eggs with 1 cup of milk( maybe 1/4 c more), 1 ts vanilla, cinnamon and then pour into the greased pan 3) Layer 8 pieces of bread, sliced into strips( I cut each slice into 3 strips and then cut in half horizontally to get squares) into the bread and let it soak 4) Add 2 chopped apples, 2 TB brown sugar, raisins, nuts like walnuts or pecans( a must!) over the bread- that part can actually be added the next morning. If you want it a little richer, I would suggest combining another TB of butter with the apple mixture. I used 100 % whole grain sandwhich bread...I like that much better for french toast because I love the crust part:) Best if can serve it with some homemade vanilla syrup, no weird high fructose corn syrup in it.

I cut the recipe to 4 servings and used one small apple and one small pear in addition to the raisins; I also cut the sugar by a bit. I did need to bake the casserole for about 20 minutes longer than stated, but I like my French toast very firm. I also didn't make this the night before, but threw it together the morning of. Both DH and I were impressed with the flavors (though I think I put in cloves in place of cinnamon; it was VERY early and the bottles all look alike...) and the texture. I will definitely be making this one again.

Very sweet, a little too sweet even for my taste.  I coated the bread with the mixture so I think that helps it not come out dry.  I will make again, just with less sugar.

This was delicious!  I substituted with Sun Maid raisin bread and cut into cubes like someone else suggested.  Used 1/2 cup of Splenda brown sugar blend and only 1/4 cup of butter.  Will definitely make this again.

Very good recipe.  Two guests have already requested the recipe.  The only thing I changed was I cubed the bread instead of slicing to make serving easier.  I also mixed the apples in with the bread instead of leaving on bottom of pan.  Just because of preference.

Followed the recipe exactly as stated, except for using texas/french toast bread.  I came out great! Everyone loved it. My son said the bread was mushy, but I didn't think it was mushy at all.  Just right.

My DH made this for breakfast and the end result was pretty good, although we found it a tad on the sweet side (but we added maple syrup before tasting it).  We also found that there is too much bread for the egg mixture, so we had to increase the egg/milk mixture.  We may make this again, but probably not for awhile.

I made this for our morning playgroup.  This is quite a bit of food and the whole thing was gone!  
I also added some craisins as well
This is one of my all time favorite recipes now!  Just to die for!

This was much better than anticipated!  Our family loves to have breakfast for dinner and I thought I'd try something different from plain old pancakes or eggs and toast.  We did use syrup on top of our individual portions.  This makes a lot and is very filling.  The only downfall is the leftovers aren't nearly as good, they tend to get soggy.  I'll keep this as a variety for our breakfast dinners but probably cut it in half for the 4 of us.

WAYYYYY too sweet.  I made it according to the directions- except for that I soaked my french loaf slices in the egg mixture (as recommended by other reviews).  This is more like a too sweet dessert.  I made it for brunch and it was left un-eaten on plates.  Nobody commented on it.  It tastes like apple pie filling with double the sugar with french toast on top (that was still dry even though I soaked each piece).  Not very good.

I would give this 5 stars for smell while baking but it was a little dry.  I used the raisin bread as suggested and soaked the cubes but still a little dry.  Would say it was ok.

I have made this twice the first time I made it I did not let it set overnite. The second time I did place it in the refrigerator over night, I used less eggs, so that it did not have a really eggy taste.

This was pretty bland and the kids had to add syrup to even touch it. I do not think I will make it again. It did not make a whole lot of servings and I used more eggs and time than if I had just made the french toast traditionally.

I made this dish for the gang at work, and they loved it.  It was very easy.  I used 4 apples instead of three (Gala) because they were small.  It worked out just fine.  I think this would be really good with pecans mixed in, too.

Came out pretty good. Didn't go over as well with my daycare kids as I had hoped but all in all a pretty good recipe. I would add more sugar and about 1/4 more liquid mixture as I had a hard time getting everything covered and soaked. Also, wouldmake apples little chunks next time too. great starter though! thanks!

I made this easier by using an apple peeler/corer/slicer.  Putting together the recipe was very simple.  However, I don't think this french toast casserole turned out nearly as well as the peach french toast recipe we found on allrecipes.  Probably wouldn't make it again.  It was a little blah.

I made this for a group of people and it turned out really well.  I used a loaf of cinnamon raisin bread.  I mixed the bread into the egg and butter mixture instead of pouring it over the apples.  I forgot to make it the night before and leave it in the frige, but it still turned out great.  I don't like soggy bread, and this wasn't soggy at all.

GREAT breakfast! Tasted great and was super easy to assemble (bonus that it sits overnight).  The only thing I would change is the type of apples used... I used Fuji (bad idea). It ended up a bit runny/mushy, but I think that could be avoided if a less juicy cooking apple (i.e. Braeburn) were used.  Just a thought! Happy casserole!

I made this a part of a larger Christmas morning breakfast and it was a big hit. I followed several reviewers suggestion and cut the brown sugar to 3/4 cup and also used Pepperidge Farm's French Toast bread, as I already had a loaf in the freezer. Followed remainder of the recipe as printed. It will become a regular in my repetoire of brunch recipes. Leftovers froze and reheated well.

Took this recipe to a church social this morning and had 5 people ask me for the recipe.  Some man I didn't know followed me out of the church to ask me for the recipe for his wife.  The only sad part about this recipe is its appearance.  My husband's comment was if you had the courage to try it, that it was very good.

I made this the day before, but did not cook it until I served this for Xmas brunch -- everyone loved it.  I think next time I would asdd nuts, or slather the bread with peanut butter

I loved this recipe!  So easy and it saved me so much time.  I used it for a Christmas Brunch and everyone loved it.  I used Granny Smith apples for that apple pie taste. I didn't want to buy raisins so I just used Raisin cinnamon bread.  I omitted the raisins and about 1/2 of the cinnamon.  I tore the bread into large chunks and used 2 extra eggs and another 1 cup of milk.  This allowed me to make a 9x13 dish plus an 8x10 dish.  After it baked but was still warm I sprinkled powdered sugar over the top and served.  Everyone loved it! The leftovers are good too!

INCREDIBLE!!!!  I baked this for a women's ministry brunch last weekend and had 30 of the 69 women ask for the recipe on the spot.  My house smelled out of this world and the resulting dish was the best I've ever had!  Definite keeper!!!

This receipe is delicious.  So easy to prepare and I loved the fact that you make it in advance then pop it in the oven just before you're ready to serve.  No need to add any syrup - this stands alone in sweetness.  If you are looking for an amazing Brunch Receipe - try this one out you won't be disappointed.

I really LOVED this recipe.  It was very sweet, so I had some for dessert myself! The kids loved it and it was even great warmed for leftovers, but it doesn't stay around too long before all was eaten.  Thank you, it was wonderful, and a nice change in pace!

Fixed this for a birthday brunch and it was a hit. Consumed so fast that I could have doubled the recipe. From now on this will be a regular on the brunch and breakfast circuit.

Very Yummy!   Made it while my Mom was visiting.  My only thing is I may add more brown sugar next time I make it, I think it needed to be a little sweeter.  I also used cinnamon raisin toast instead of french bread. It was very easy to prepare.

I made this for sunday breakfast. It was great. My family loved it. It was so easy to make and I love that you prepare it the night before so that I was able to just through it in the oven in the morning. I had to add this to the house recipes box.

I only needed to use 1 8oz baguette, did not pre-soak bread and it was perfect.  I did broil it for a few minutes at the end to add a crunch.  So Good!

This is the most divine recipe.  I made it for 36 people for a Holiday Brunch and everyone raved and came back for seconds and some for thirds. And... easy too.

Amazing! I made it for Easter breakfast and, as I recall, followed the recipe exactly. I was sure to soak the baguette well. Serve the portions upside down and they're already 'topped'. The leftovers were just as delicious the next day. My mother-in-law even demanded the recipe... :-)

I put this together Christmas Eve, and we had it Christmas morning. So easy and delicious--I think that it will become an annual recipe!
