12-15-15 ~ I had a chuck roast that I wanted to try and grill.  This was the recipe that I chose.  The marinade on this roast is wonderful.  The chuck roast marinated all day.  When it was time to grill we put the meat in a pan and added the marinade to the pan.  It grilled slowly for about an hour.  The results were a delicious roast with fantastic flavor.  I then boiled the marinade to make sure it was completely cooked.  Once cooled, I added the leftover roast slices for another meal.  We used part of it another night served over a baked potato.  Still having meat and broth left, into the freezer it went to use in a pot of beef and noodles or a stockpot full of beef vegetable soup.  Loved the taste of this and so glad I didn't discard the marinade.  (5-stars)

This is a very good recipe, we didn't have liquid smoke so added a couple teaspoons of smokey paprika.

I thought this recipe was pretty tasty! Followed it to the T but only had about 3 hours to marinate.

Made it without the soy sauce and red pepper flakes. Added Teriyaki instead. It really needed those red pepper flakes.. Redo tonight.. Still very yummy!

We actually made this on thanksgiving day as a first try so my husband could use the new grill and I could relieve my oven and he was so proud. Added more honey and a doubled the marinade for two tri tips but turned out so well I will be doing at Christmas for sure

Will definitely make this again!  was excellent.  I will add more red pepper or use the ground version of the same. there was no spiciness after 8 hrs of marinading.  reduced liquid smoke to 1 tsp from 1tbs.  1 tsp was plenty.

I didnâ€™t have smoke flavoring which was just fine. I smoked the roast on my pellet grill at 230 degrees for about two and a half hours turned out great. I sliced it thin, made a sandwich for my wife and I and heated the remaining roast the next day for my grandkids n son in law and was gone in in no time. Yes I will make it again

Made this tonight on the grill.  The meat was soaking in the marinade over night so it was well seasoned.  Loved it!!!  Even my daughter, who rarely comments on food, said the flavor was excellent.

I had used another recipe for Grilled Tri Tip Roast in the past but I decided to try this one.  It came out really really good. This recipe will replace my original recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The roast came out juicy and delicious.  Just bought another tri tip and plan on making it for company.

This was so good and so easy. We served it with homemade mashed potatoes and  fresh corn on the cob. Perfect for a summer bbq. The leftovers we cooped up and threw in a salad the next night.
