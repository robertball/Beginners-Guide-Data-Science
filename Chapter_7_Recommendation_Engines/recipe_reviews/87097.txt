Pretty good, I changed it up a little with the raspberry glaze.  Instead of putting it on as a glaze I mixed the raspberry jelly with the rest of the can of chicken broth.  I then made that into a gravy and poured it over the chicken once on the plates.  Turned out wonderful!

I read all the reviews before cooking this and made the modifications most people made.  I used chicken thighs (because it is what I had) and cooked them for about 40 minutes in the oven with a little stock and the herb rub.  IMPORTANT:  You have to use fresh herbs.  Dry herbs will not work here.  I put the SEEDLESS raspberry jam, 1 tablespoon of dijon and about 1/2 cup of stock into a small frying pan and reduced it over low heat while the chicken was cooking.  After 40 minutes (or so, use your judgment) I pulled the chicken and added the juices to the reduced sauce, thinned it down as needed and then poured the thick, rich sauce over the chicken and cooked it for about 10 more minutes, until it formed a nice crunchy topping.  I served with rice pilaf (white rice with toasted slivered almonds and craisins) and it was very, very good.  We will make this again!!

Awesome!  The chicken came out tender and juicy, and the raspberry coating was just sweet enough.  I actually ended up making a little bit more of the raspberry glaze as a dipping sauce for the chicken.  I recommend it !

This was a very simple and satisfying dish.  The glaze was a bit sweet for us so I added a little more mustard (and used dijon instead of honey).  Usually my boyfriend prefers savory to fruit flavors with meats but the mustard tempered the raspberry very nicely.  I served this with a light red wine, roasted red potatoes and dill carrots (recipe from this site).

This recipe was pretty good. I'm not a super great cook and I didn't have fresh herbs, only dried and unfortunately the cooking time was not long enough for the dried herbs so they were very crunchy and unpleasant. However, the flavor was good. For a little zing, I used olive oil and red wine vinegar instead of broth and I used dijon mustard instead of honey mustard. I will try this again with either fresh herbs or maybe in the crock pot with dried.

Excellent!  This chicken and glaze had a different, delicious taste to it.  Although skeptical at first about the raspberry jam and honey mustard (I used dijon honey mustard), my girlfriend enjoyed it as much as I did.

This recipe was fantastic!!! My houslhold contains of all different ages and it was hit! The rasberry was enough to add a tang of flavor, but not enough to ruin the chicken flavor! Bravo! I will be making this easy and simple recipe again.

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  The blend of flavors reminded my husband of pinesol.  He told me to shred the recipe so I don't accidentally attempt it again.  At least my dogs had a nice meal!

I used this glaze on some pork chops that were grilled and they were great. I added a touch more mustard than called for, but it was an excellent combination of flavors.

I'm a big fan of raspberries both in sweet and savoury recipes so I got very excited when I saw this in my email box.  Overall the recipe was excellent.  I did make some changes.  First of all I cut the recipe in half because it's just for my fiance and myself.  Second of all, I didn't have any honey mustard so I used regular spicy brown mustard and used that.  The half recipe only called for a 1/4 tsp but I prolly ended up with a rounded tablespoon of mustard into a 1/2 cup of raspberry preserves.  The competing flavors were delicious.  Also for those who claimed a Pinesol taste, you probably had too much dried rosemary, especially if you added the rosemary to the raspberry glaze.  I omitted this completely out of the recipe and will actually lessen the rosemary amount in the herb rub the next time I make this.  Dried herbs are more concentrated in flavor than fresh so less=more.

This is an easy and tasty dish.  My whole family enjoyed it.  I made a couple minor changes due to what I had on hand and other things baking.  I use dijon mustard instead of honey mustard (we liked it, and will keep that change); the rosemary and sage were fresh; and I prepared this on the stovetop.  To cook I used less than a T of grapeseed oil cooked the chicken in a large skillet.  When the chicken was cooked I used the broth to deglaze the pan and added the jam mixture.  I allowed this to simmer and reduce until it coated the back of a spoon.  I then returned the chicken to the pan and simmered for a few minutes to coat the chicken.  I will probably keep with this style of prep, it took about 20 to cook that way and we really enjoyed it.

I added a dash of cayenne pepper into the raspberry glaze and it was the perfect balance of spicy and sweet.

This was ok my husband and I both thought that it had too much of an herb taste to it.  If we try it again we will try less seasoning.

Absolutely LOVED this dish and so did all 7 of my teenage foster sons & my husband.. which means it must be good! It had a very nice and sweet taste. I made the recipe just like it says expect added 1/2 cup of broth to make a bit more juicy. Since I added extra broth, I broiled chicken for about 2 minutes at the end to get the rasberry glaze crust like. Served alongside egg noodles mixed with olive oil, basil, salt, pepper, chopped almonds & craisins.  Was SO YUMMY!!

I'm stingy with my stars, but this was really really good. I would go a little easier with the rosemary perhaps, so to not overpower the raspberry. Maybe half of what it calls for. Other than that, absolutely delicious.

Our New Year's Resolution was to start eating healthier (like almost everyone else!), and we liked this.  I cut the chicken breasts halves in half because they're so large anymore.  Substituted dried basil for the rosemary (I don't like dried rosemary) and some leftover cranberry sauce for the raspberry preserves.  Would definitely make again, but I thought it needed S&P.

The meat turns out so tender and the blend of herbs and jam is fabulous. Since I rarely keep honey mustard on hand, I usually put in 1/2 teaspoon of both honey and mustard and it tastes wonderful.

The flavor combination is interesting and this recipe has potential. To start with, I would go with seedless raspberry jam next time. I would also decrease the amount of jam called for, and increase the mustard, choosing something other than honey mustard. The combination of the two made this very sweet.

I thought this was amazingly tasty.  My recommendations is to pour our some of that broth from the pan before adding the glaze so it doesn't wash off.... and make extra glaze for each individual to add more to their chicken if they so choose.  This was a great dinner and went well the Gourmet Mushroom risotto.

Surprisingly unflavorful, except for the Rosemary.  I thought the raspberry would add more to it.

Apparently we're not great fans of rosemary. And this has a TON of rosemary!  It was like eating a Christmas tree.

Overall the taste of the chicken was fantastic.  I used boneless chicken thighs and thought the darker meat went better with the flavors.  I also thought that the raspberry glaze had far to many seeds so next time I will use seedless jam.

This was pretty good and tasty.  I left out the broth and just made the glaze.  Baked in over for 15 min, then added glaze, then cooked 15 min longer.  Searved over rice.  It had a very nice flavor.

The jam was too sweet. I kept adding more and more mustard, but never tasted it. The herbs were dry and dusty. I used the last of the glaze to make gravy as someone suggested. The left overs sat in the fridge until we threw it out.

A disappointment for sure. The flavor was just not there-I have a turkey recipe similar to this that I live but this misses the mark. I agree it has a 'pinesol' taste to it. There wasn't much I could do to salvage it. Obviously the jelly makes the chicken purple. It was just not appetizing eating a purple chicken breast. 
The only saving grace was that the chicken was moist.

I thought this was wonderful. My husband however, not so much. It definitely would have been better without the seeds from the preserves. Next time, I'll find a jam or a concentrate that doesn't have seeds.

For me, the spices did nothing to compliment the raspberry preserves and vice versa.  I typically like sweetness on meat, but I would not make this again.

LOVED the raspberry, thought it was an excellent combination with the rub unfortunately my dinner guests i came to find were not as big of a fan of the tangy flavor as I... oh well that was all preferance and I will make this again for sure. Chicken was a little dry on its own though and probably would have been pretty ...borning on its own (without sauce) so I may try to kick it up a notch next time with a little jalapeño or something ....

Easy to prepare.  I did not have fresh rosemary leaves, but I still felt like there was pleanty of rosemary flavor after using dried leaves.  I served this with long-grained wild rice & asparagus which really complimented the flavors in the raspberry glaze.  I will for sure make this again, it is such a wonderful healthy recipe.

Not bad, but I would have liked more of a marinade for the chicken. The raspberry sauce was great with the sage and rosemary, but the flavor didn't carry through the rest of the chicken.

This wasn't bad, but the flavor was a little different than I'm used to. I think it can be chalked up to operator error, as I may have used too much rosemary.

A good recipe and I followed it exactly. I only gave it four stars because I would need to be in the mood for the mixture of flavors. Not something I would cook all the time, but still tasty.

This was really good! I used the glaze over pork chops, but it would also go well with ham. I reccommend using seedless raspberry preserves.  If you can't find that, just heat and strain regular raspberry preserves through a wire strainer. I also found it be a touch on the sweet side, so added some fresh black pepper to the glaze which worked quite well to tone down the surgar, and gave it a  little bit of kick! I will definately try this one again, and I think I'll use dijion next time, like some others mentioned.

This was a very easy, yummy, healthful chicken dish.  My picky husband and daughter loved it too!  It definetly needs extra sauce after cooking.  Also, try to get seedless raspberry jam!

This recipe is wonderful!  I found it while looking for a different way of cooking the same old chicken.  My husband said that it sounded weird, but after tasting it he LOVED it.  We're wathcing our sugar intake so I substituted Raspberry preserves made with Splenda (Walmart brand) and it was great.  It's really good paired with John's Raspberry Asparagus available here on allrecipes.

I thought this recipe was OK.   I agree that the rosemary needs to really be crushed.   Mine still had some uncrushed pieces that made the recipe less appealing.   I might try it on pork chops, using more honey mustard next time.

Actually, 3 1/2 stars. If you choose to make this, be sure to crush the rosemary as fine as possible! Use more honey mustard & I would also recommend to use seedless jam. It's OK.

I used blueberry preserves instead of rasberry and Swanson Flavor Boost (chicken) instead of chicken broth. This turned out wonderfully. There was a lot of liquid in the pan after cooking but that's because I covered with foil. I won't do that next time.

Before I prepare a receipt I try to image how the dish will taste. I was right on with this one; it is out of balance; it needs something (sharper mustard; maybe vinegar) to counter the sweetness of the raspberry preserves. Sorry.

Loved this! We used Chicken Breast Tenders because thats what we had. We didn't like how much liquid was in the casserole dish so we just took some out before adding the preserves. Came out great! Thanks for the Recipe! :)

This recipe has wonderful flavors and very easy!! I use a little extra chicken broth just to make sure the chicken cooks and is nice and juicy. I usually prepare this chicken along with "Awesomely Easy Sesame Asparagus" that I found on this webiste as well as some type of potato for a starch and some bread.

I think this is a great, solid recipe. Adding the different ingredients made me a little nervous, as the combination seemed a little different than I've typically seen but it was quite delicious. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe can be saved...but as-is, it is just not good. WAY too much rosemary. If I make this again, I'll omit the rosemary-herb rub on the chicken and add more dijon (not honey) mustard to the sauce. I think with those changes it will be tasty.

I actually cooked this in a slow cooker so it would be extra tender. I did not follow the measurements to a T because I wanted the chicken to cook and really absorb the flavors. I also threw in some new potatoes in the cooker. When I took the chicken and potatoes out, I was a little nervous because it was so pink, but it was not sweet at all!  It was just right!

My boyfriend and roommate loved it! I fooled them to think it was much more complicated than it was.  Very simple and very tastey...I might go a little lighter on the herb rub next time though.

I thought that it was great.  I did add more honey mustard than was called for, but the flavors worked really well and the chicken was really tasty.  Do make extra of the raspberry sauce, it's great for dipping!

This was ok. I'll probably make it again but I will try to find a way to modify it a bit. Or perhaps find something better to pair it with. There was nothing really bad or wrong about it but also nothing very spectacular.

Sorry folks, but I did not care for this recipe.  For me the sage was too much… if you want to give this dinner a shot definitely cut back on the sage by at least half.  I also couldn’t figure out why one would use ½ a teaspoon of honey mustard in a cup of raspberry preserves – the flavor was totally lost.

It was really good. My boyfriend really liked it and he ussually hates it when i add any type of fruit to meat. I saw some other reviews comparing this to tasting like pine sol so when i made it i used a little less rosemary than called for.

This was a nice recipe. I would serve it to guests because it's easy and you don't have to fuss with the chicken on the stove top before putting it into the oven. I didn't have any sage, honey mustard, or raspberry preserves. Used fresh rosemary and dried oregano for my spices, a mix of berry preserves, and regular mustard (about 2 T worth), plus added a bit of cayenne to the sauce for some zing. Family voted the recipe "a keeper."

tasty. BUT cooking time was not enough. four chicken breasts took 35 mins plus the extra 10 mins for the raspberry glaze. i also added 3x the amount of mustard and i used honey dijon instead since it was all i had.

A nice change for boneless chicken breasts. Made as written with the exception of the mustard which I didn't have on hand. So I used regular Dijohn. I do question the cooking time however. After 20 minutes at 350*, this dish was no where cooked.  Possibly I should have flattened the breasts first.  But I fail to see this in the directions.  Added at least 20-25 minutes on to the cooking time. Not sure if I'll make this again, but might be well worth  tweaking!

Very easily made, very tasty...just loved the sauce; added twice the amount of mustard and used Dijon instead of honey since I'm not allowed sweets, traded sugarfree preserves for the regular ones.  Would recommend and will make again!  Those spices/herbs are a delightful blend.

So not too impressed with this one.  It's ok if you need to do something in a pinch and I bet kids would love it.  We put it a bunch of extra mustard (including the powdered stuff) and it still wasn't enough to really change the jam taste.    BUT - this would be a great for a sandwich!  take this and add sprouts, cucumber, cream-cheese(whipped) & bacon i bet you would have hell of a combo.

this is like an idiot proof recipe. I made it with my bf and spilled over 1 tablespoon of black pepper in it and forgot to add in all the rosemary and it still turned out. It would have been better with out all that pepper but we both still ate it and enjoyed it.

This was very tasty and very easy. My favorites! I actually used dijon mustard and thought it worked- you can't taste the mustard, it just cuts the sweetness of the preserves. Thanks for this recipe!

This tasted great but was strange with the rasberry seeds. That's said by someone who's a big "rasberry anything" fan. I just could not get adjusted to those crunchy little buggers on my chicken. My husband did not enjoy the seeds in this dish either.

This was pretty yummy. I also added some extra honey mustard to tone down the sweetness a little bit. We served it with couscous, which went perfectly with the sweetness of the chicken since it was kind of salty.

I made this for dinner and it was just OK.  The chicken was moist and tender but the flavor of the herbs didn't blend with the raspberry.  I ate it, but my kids complained.

This recipe was probably the worst I have ever attempted....the dried herbs were EXTREMELY crunchy, and the raspberry glaze was too sweet for the chicken and all of the herbs..the only good thing about this recipe was that it was healthy. Definitely will not try this one again....

Overall great flavor combination! I like the sage, oregano with the rosemary, while the Raspberry and rosemary were the shining stars of the dish. Next time I will make it a point to get fresh rosemary, I think it will bring added depth but not bad without. I also used half a chicken bullion add I didn't have the stock. I made with pearl couscous and orange&feta salad. Great dinner, we will have again!

Super simple and delicious. It made for very moist chicken. I would double the raspberry sauce. My whole family loved it.

Awesome recipe with great flavor. Only thing is that I had to pull it out about 10 minutes early because it began over cooking and drying out.

Delicious and easy to prepare. I added some pearled onions to the dish. Served with pan-sauteed butternut squash, carrots & shallots.  
I adjusted the recipe to 2 servings. Will eat the second serving for lunch tomorrow! Maybe on a salad :) YUM

Like most,I tweaked it to reflect our tastes. I felt  it needed a little mustard after tasting glaze,I used 2t Dijon and 1/4t honey. I'll leave out honey next time,the sweet of preserves was more than enough.I also had about a teaspoon of seasoning mix after applying to the chicken,so that is what I mixed with preserves,mustard and honey glaze. Didn't have another use for it and couldn't  see throwing it away. Like others I didn't add broth covered with foil to bake. Put  chicken with glaze over smashed cauliflower. Definitely making this dist again.

The chicken was sooo juicy and delicious. It tasted good but I didn't really like the crunchy texture of the coating. Might have been because (try as I might) I just could not find seedless raspberry jelly at the grocery store.

The whole family loved this chicken. I like to brine chicken breasts if I have the time. I mix 1 T. salt with 2 T. Worcestershire sauce with 2 cups of water. Submerge the chicken, refrigerate for 30 minutes and pat dry afterwards. After reading the reviews, I cut back on the rosemary and made a gravy from the chicken broth and raspberry jelly ( I made a roux of 2 T. butter, sage, thyme and onion powder and then added the leftover chicken broth and a dollop of raspberry jam. I added the broth from the chicken when it came out of the oven.) I served it with mashed potatoes and a side of sautéed  onion and mushrooms. Absolutely delicious.

I used orange marmalade and dijon and followed the recipe.  Was quite good, but will brown my chicken first next time.  I think I will continue with the orange taste tho as it was so good.

Horrible.  The rosemary made it almost inedible.  The seeds in the jam were terrible.
