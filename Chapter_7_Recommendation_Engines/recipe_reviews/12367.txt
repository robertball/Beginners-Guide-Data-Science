Great recipe and easy to make. Thanks Eleanor. I marked it down one star because I can't imagine an apple recipe without cinnamon, which I added (a couple of teaspoons).

I also added fresh ground cloves and doubled the oats as some have suggested. Works well with half Splenda and half brown sugar, too. I've also added a few cranberries for color and taste sometimes. Always to rave reviews.

This is a really good crisp.  Granny Smith's worked well for me.  I doubled the amount of rolled oats since my boys like that part the best and it was just great!!

Yum! Comforting and so, so good! I used Cortland and Crispin apples 'cause that's what I had on hand, and left the skins on. I followed suggestions and added 1/2 c. more oats,  about 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. cloves, used less butter, and added 1/2 bag thawed cranberries. Wow. The sweet/tart combination was just right, not to mention the added health benefits of the nuts, cranberries and less butter (didn't miss it even with the added oats). I'll make this again--thank you, Eleanor, for posting this recipe and to all who made suggestions!

Absolutely delicious.  I missplaced my own recipe for Apple Crisp so I had to look one up.  This is by far the best that I have had!!  I doubled the rolled oats because we all LOVE that part and added 1 teaspoon cinnamon.  I will use this always.

I've tried a couple apple crisp recipes lately and this one is a definate winner.  I added a little ground cloves and cinnamon, also added currants and dried cranberries to the crust and it's just delicious!  Me and my boyfriend made it for breakfast and by early afternoon, it was gone.  I plan to make another this weekend and perhaps try wheat flour.

After layering the apples I tossed in a half tsp. of cinnamon, a little white sugar, and 1/2 tsp. of vanilla. I served it with vanilla ice cream and for someone who claims they usually don't like dessert, my husband ate every drop.

Delicious apple crisp, especially with Macintosh apples. I added an exta 1/4 C of brown sugar and rolled oats for a little extra topping, and used pecans instead of walnuts. Still excellent!

Better than apple pie by far!  I shared this recipe with a friend and it is a hit with her too!  I used green and red apples and the tartness and sweetness was a great compliment, especially with the spices and oats.

A light delicious apple desert which may
 be used to accompany any meal, even
breakfast! For snacks it's delightful.
I tried ice cream and cool whip with it, 
and it is just as good after being in the 
refrigerator.  With the apples, rolled oats
and brown sugar it is also quite a healthy
treat.  Am so glad I discoved this recipe.

I merged this recipe with another apple crisp recipe, using 7 cups of apples, 1 cup oats, 1 cup flour and 1 cup brown sugar along with cinnamon, nutmeg and 1 cup nuts.  It tasted fabulous and our company loved it too.

This was good, I did add a few things, and am very glad I did.  I used 5 medium apples (usually it says a cup per apple).  I think the recipe may need more apples.  I also thought that the topping perhaps should have used a pastry blender and cold butter instead of softened.  I think it is easier to work with that way.  Just with my experience, if I were to serve this right away, it would have been a little soupy.  I let it stand for about a half an hour or so, and it set up nicely.  I did have a tiny taste before I froze this, and the spices there were not overpowering and a nice blend with the ones I added.  Great Job, just have an additional apple or two if you put it in the pan and it looks like more should go in, put more in.

This recipe is fantastic.  I read some other reviews and a tip for those who are finding your topping to be too dry....try mixing in the butter using your fingers instead of cutting it in.  Try  not to over mix but even if you do it would still turn out great! :)  Served warm with french vanilla ice cream on top mmmm

I took the advice of the other reviewers and added more apples, 7 cups.  I also mixed in a 1/2 pint of organic blueberries with the Corland apples.  Other changes i made - I doubled the oats and added 1/4 cup more flour, reduced the nutmed to 1/2 teaspoon and added 1 teaspoon cinnamon.  The crumb topping was just the right amount (it wouldn't be enough if i followed this part of the recipe)  however, it was way too sweet.  Still edible, but you can easily have used 1/2 to 3/4 cup brown sugar.   I cut in the butter with a pastry cutter, and set it aside while i prepared the fruit.  When i assembled the crisp i first squeezed a handful before gently breaking it up on top of the fruit.  This makes a chunkier crumble.  The nuts definitely puts this recipe above all others, and the blueberries added another fruit dimension.  With the small adjustments, this is an excellent recipe!

Wonderful crisp recipe. I've made this with a variety of apples with and without the skin on and it always comes out great. I've also made this combining frozen blueberries and apples, or blueberries and peaches and it's still yummy. Like others, I double the oats and add cinnamon instead of nutmeg. I also use margarine instead of butter and only add 1/2 cup of sugar. The topping is a little powdery, but it still tastes great even after the little tweaks.

I have tried several apple crisp recipes but this was the ULTIMATE.  I think the key is the the nuts which gives it an extra crunch. Made it several times and will continue making it.

This was a very good crisp, similar to ones I've had in restaurants. Personally I found it a bit too sweet (though my father loved it), so next time I will scale back on the sugar a bit. I used gala and granny smiths, 3 of each, and they were very tender after 45 minutes. My only problem was that the top did not seem to brown and just remained a loose powder. I melted 2 tablespoons of butter and drizzled it over the top of the crisp and set it under the broiler for a few minutes. That really helped to make a nice browned crust on top.

Fantastic! I made this last night and this morning it's GONE!  I made a few changes. I used Granny Smith and Gala Apples. I like the combination of sweet and tart. Also, the Granny smith don't get as soft as the Gala after 40 minutes in the oven, so it's a nice variety of texture in the apples. I didn't use lemon juice, but lightly coated the apples with sugar and flower before putting the topping on. I used double the oatmeal, and two full cups of coarsely chopped pecans instead of walnuts. The results were absolutely heavenly.

Very good.  I used a mix of chopped walnuts and pecans, and it was the best apple crisp I've ever had.  The nuts make a huge difference in taste!  I was getting rid of really old apples I had picked at the orchard that were not looking so good anymore, and it still tasted great!

Sorry, but I just didn't like it.  The topping was too compact - almost like a shell.  I like more of a crumble.  The fruit was too sweet.  My teeth were aching from the syrup.  I used a combo of Gala and Granny smith.  Served it at a family dinner.  Hubby likes it - he has a wicked sweet tooth tho.

I used Mutsu apples, green, firm and tart but not sour. I substituted 3/4 cup organic apple juice for the water. I put the sliced apples, added 1/2 cup dried cranberries and the juice in a pot on low heat to release the apple juices while I prepared the rest of the ingredients. I used 1/2 cup organic cane sugar and followed the recipe but added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the nutmeg....So good!!!

This rcipe is to die for.  I did add 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon.  I served it to my guests warm with vanilla ice cream and got rave reviews. Definitely a keeper

The flavor of the topping is great - I wondered about it when I saw there was no cinnamon in the recipe, but I didn't even miss it. I used a mixture of Splenda and brown sugar and for me, the topping ended up being too much/too sweet for the amount of apples, so I will simply decrease the sugar next time I make this. The walnuts added a really nice crunch, even though I don't normally like walnuts.  Thanks for the recipe; I will definitely make this again!

This is a good recipe - in fact it's delicious "as is" but I would add cinnamon. One other thing you could add is a tiny bit of rum or rum flavoring. I've tasted Apple Crisp with rum flavoring and it's just a bit richer. I think the water is needed for five cups. Also I happen to think the ratio of crisp to apples should be a big higher.

This is very good.  I didn't care for the nutmeg and will use cinnamon next time I make it, thus the 4-star rating.  I made the full recipe of topping and put half in the freezer for an easy dessert another night, used two large apples and half the topping.  I used Granny Smith apples, which were very tart.

This was a hit! I added extra apples and filled the pan pretty much to the top with the apples and mixed in 1 TSP of cinnamon to apples. Then doubled the oats, added 1 TSP of cinnamon to topping and decreased the butter slightly. Served with a scoop of natural vanilla. Delicious!

Excellent, easy recipe that got great reviews from the eaters.  I did not have walnuts but I hope to add these next time.  Also I did sprinkle a little cinnamon over the apples before adding the topping.    Just a note, many reviewers said to double the topping which I tried - if you're using a 13x9ish size glass casserole dish the apples really cook down and it was more topping than apple.  Next time I will NOT double the topping.  Altogether was great served warm with a little vanilla ice cream on top!  Thanks for sharing

Great recipe and easy to modify. It is nice to find a baking recipe that you can alter to suit your own cooking style. I always add cinnamon and extra oats but have found it works well with many types of apples and other berries mixed with apples.

Everyone LOVED this dish. It was very easy to make and not something you can really mess up. I was in a rush and totally forgot to add spices and it still came out awesome. The only modification I made was doubling the oats.

Great recipe that was a spin off of a classic.  I used more like 7 cups of apples and added cinnamon and some vanilla  to the crisp topping - I can't imagine the recipe without cinnamon and the vanilla added more depth of flavor in my opinion.  I used 1/2 cup pecans b/c that is what I had on hand - put them through a nut grinder, so they were more of a fine chop than called for but they added a great texture and flavor to the dish - will continue to make through apple season!

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!! We have lots of pecans that we grow so I used quite a bit more than what it called for and it was wonderful. Lots of flavor without being overly sweet.

I was in a rush so I didn't read any of the reviews.  Made the recipe as shown and thought it definitely needed some cinnamon.  If I make this again, I will halve the nutmeg and add cinnamon.  It was way too "nutmeggy".

I'm not usually an apple crisp fan, but this was awesome. I think the nuts were a big reason, plus it's not too sweet. Definitely a keeper.

This recipe was good though I expected a nuttier flavor. I used walnuts and pecans and even added some directly to the apples but not a very nutty flavor for some reason. I also bought a package of apple crisp and just added additional rolled oats, sugar and nutmeg to save time when making the topping. I also used 2 types of apples, granny smith and red delicious which gave a great varying sweet and sour flavor.

I was concerned about making this the first time because it was to be dessert for company.  And of course, no one recommends trying a new recipe when company is coming for dinner!  But this one certainly didn't disappoint!  Super easy and just delicious.  We liked it so much I made it again three days later for different dinner guests!

I doubled the oats and reduced butter by 2 T. but found mine was wanting for a bit more apples. Wouldn't enjoy a crisp near as much without the nuts. Fought the urge to drizzle the apples with maple syrup, next time for sure.

Wow! As this bakes, your entire home will be filled with the most wonderful aroma!!! I made a few changes, only because of necessity. Changes: I used orange juice instead of lemon, a mixture of 3 Granny Smith,2 Braeborn and 2 Gala apples, and I sliced them very thin. Also, I added 2 tsp cinnamon - as suggested by others. This is my new favorite apple crisp recipe!

I had a craving for an apple dessert, and I love anything nutty - so this seemed like the perfect choice.  I didn't want to make the entire amount, so I halved the apple part of the recipe (but kept the topping mixture measurements the same - so that I could use it as a "crust" and a topping).  Once I tossed the apples in a bowl with the water and lemon juice, I also added cinnamon..  probably about 1 tsp. worth.  For the crumb topping, I took the advice of others and doubled the oatmeal and halved the butter.  I crushed sliced almonds and walnuts for the "nut mixture".. and I also decreased the sugar total to 1/2 cup (I don't like things to be too sweet).  Also, I used all whole wheat flour, and added more cinnamon to the crumb mixture.  I lightly sprayed cooking spray in an 8x8 square baking dish.. poured in half of the crumb mixture, and then layered the apples over it, and then poured the remaining crumb mixture on top of it all.  I sprayed with a bit more cooking spray to make sure it would brown well.  Even though I used an 8x8 dish, the cooking time remained the same at 45 minutes.  I sprinkled more sliced almonds on top at the very end (love the crunch!), and it is truly a deeeelicious treat!  And, it's on the "healthier" side of desserts, so that's a plus.  I used Granny Smith apples (only needed two for the halved recipe).  Thank you!

Read through the other recipes and used 2 cups oats and 1/4 cup flour.  I added over a cup of nuts (almonds and pecans) that i chopped coarsely which absolutely MADE this recipe.  It was too sweet for my preference so next time i will cut the sugar slightly.  It was incredible as a rhubarb crisp!  Thank you for the recipe.

Tart apples, the lemon juice, and nutmeg made this really good. I used pecans, a little less sugar and a little less butter, and was really happy with the result.

This is a good recipe. As suggested, I doubled the amount of oatmeal, added a teaspoon of cinnamon, and used pecans. To me, this was too tart, but I think a lot of people will love the "sweet and sour" taste combo. I will probably use half as much lemon juice next time.

A great recipe! There is one thing I changed though I reduced the amount of nutmeg to 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg and could still taste the strong nutmeg flavor! I might even consider leaving the nutmeg out.

This recipe was easy to make and very tasty!! The crumbly crust was thick, sweet, and buttery and was a great compliment to the apples that I used, which were somewhat tart.

I've tried a few apple crisp recipes on this site and hands down, this is my favorite! It's delicious w/ or w/out nuts. I usually just squeeze a whole fresh lemon with the dry ingredients asked for, and mix it in a bowl well. Then I pour it over the apples in a larger bowl, tossing to make sure every apple is coated with the sugary marinade. I always buy 3 kinds of apples and meticulously alternate them in the baking dish, to make a nice, even blend of flavors. It's worth the extra effort. I promise. I've expedited this version at times by using a box of maple granola cereal crumbled up with maple sugar from Trader Joe's, then adding the flour, baking soda, baking powder and melted butter as stated in the recipe for the topping.  It expedites the topping and tastes delicious.  My boyfriend and his 12 yr old son tell me they want this made every weekend! I've even made this with fresh peaches in the Summer for a change and man oh man is it decadent w/ vanilla ice cream. This is a definite saver to your recipe box!

Doubled for a large dutch oven and it was amazing! We like more oats and less flour, so we used 1/4 cup flour to 3/4 cup of oats (then doubled) and that variation worked just fine as well. Some fresh grated nutmeg also added a little magic to the dish.

This was my contribution to Thanksgiving dessert and it was very good.  I made the following changes as suggested by other reviewers:  used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon instead of the nutmeg, used finely chopped pecans instead of walnuts and doubled the oats.  I used a mixture of gala and granny smith apples.  In my opinion, it tasted better the next day.

OK - this is really, really good!  I did substitute cinnamon for nutmeg because of my husband's strong dislike of nutmeg but would like to cook it again as suggested as I am curious as to how that turns out.  Definitely the best apple crisp I  have had.

This is a delicious recipe, even if you want to change it a bit. I doubled the recipe (using about 7 big apples of mixed varieties and a 9x13 glass baking dish), chopped apples instead of slicing, subbed cinnamon for nutmeg, and omitted the nuts. (Might try with nuts next time.) Just what I was looking for! Thanks for the recipe!!

I used pecans instead with Cortland and McIntosh apples.  My husband loved it.  Better than the pan crisps as the deeper dish provides more apple.

BEST Crisp and can be used for other fruit! Few changes I use on any fruit; Add cinnamon (mix with the lemon juice and water on fruit), use 1 cup oats, and split the sugar: use 1/2 C. white sugar, 1/2 C. brown sugar. 

This topping worked great with apples. I also used with peaches, substituting orange juice for water. And BEST SO FAR? 5 cups of Pears and 1 cup blueberries!!!!! Will be making this dessert for my dad's birthday instead of cake!

I had lost my go to recipe for apple crisp that a friend gave me & thought this one mostly resembled what I remembered about my lost recipe... this one had a good flavor- but seems to have too much butter/ brown sugar or maybe not enough oats & flour.  I did double the recipe for a Christmas gathering, so I don't know if that was part of the problem. The topping, for me, spread out a lot & seem to overwhelm the apples.  Like I said, an okay flavor, but maybe adding less butter & sugar and a little more oats/ flour would make it better.

This recipe is top notch!! The only thing I did differently was add a little more flour and oats. And we dont like nutmeg, so I used Cinnamon instead.  It was sooo good that my husband had me make it again the very next day!  Yumm!

This is a wonderful "classic". You can put the nuts in or leave them out according to your taste. Increase the amount of apples if you wish. Also, if you double the topping, you can freeze it for the next time and you will have a really easy crisp.

I've been craving apple crisp since we've been enjoying cooler weather in Kansas, so I made this last evening. It's delicious! I used 4 large Granny Smith apples (left the peeling on 2)and added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. The apples were a bit tart for my husband's taste, but a scoop of vanilla ice cream sweetened it up for him. This is a definite "repeat" and next time I plan to use pecans in the topping and drizzle with warm caramel sauce.  Thanks for sharing!

This was very good after a change or two. I agree with the addition of cinnamon a must with an apple dish. I also added just a touch of clove, vanilla and ginger into the apple portion, not the topping. I soaked a half cup of currants, (you could use raisins or dried cranberries), in hot water for 5 minutes, drained and stirred those in for an added dimension. I also used pecans I chopped and toasted lightly in a frying pan, instead of walnuts in the topping and used more that the recipe called for. The family thought it was great. I served it warm with some french vanilla ice cream.

In the south we like our desserts "sweet". I used granny smith apples and the next time I make this I will add 1/2 cup of sugar in with the lemon/water mixture. It was a bit tart w/out the sugar.  Good if that's the kind of crisp you're looking for.

Served this to five older men tonight.  I'm sure all of them had eaten Apple Crisp many many times.  They all were very impressed with this recipe.  Two changes were made to the original recipe.  I added 2 tsp. of cinnamon and topped with slivered almonds since I didn't have walnuts.  The lemon really makes a difference.  Almost forgot, at the last minute I discovered that I'd left out the water.  Just said "oh well", let's see how it turns out without it.  There were comments about how the nutmeg really added something to this dish.  This is an inexpensive delicious dessert.  I will definitely make it again.  Bonus is that it's so easy.

Really good recipe. My family raved about it at Christmas.  I added some cranberries to give it a tang and because it was the Holiday. I'm keeping this one.

Easy and fast dessert. The nuts were good with the apples. Great idea for those apples that are sitting in your fruit bowl snf have been overlooked.

This was one of the best apple crisp recipes I've tried.  Had a crowd of 14 for dinner last week and everyone raved and asked for the recipe. Didn't have quick cooking oats so used regular longer cooking oatmeal. Still awesome. Served warm with french vanilla ice cream.  Hmmmmm!!!

Exactly what I was looking for...Thank You!  It's the perfect blend of tart and sweet, soft and crunchy.  (Next time, though, come babysit me while I cook it because I forgot about it and it burned a little.)

Will definitely make this again! I used winesap apples, doubled the oats and added cinnamon to the topping....I had pecans open so used those rather than walnuts. It was delicious!!! On 2nd night we had a little butter pecan ice cream with it. Yum!
Update: made again tonight, I added even more oats in hopes of getting a crumble instead of a shell but I over did it and it doesn't wanna bind at all.  It still tastes great but I'll go back to the way I first did it.  So happy I found this recipe.

Delicious! Based on other reviews, I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, otherwise made the recipe as is. Some reviewers noted that the recipe was too sweet, but the type of apples used could certainly make a difference. I used Honey Crisp apples, but any tart apple would be great.

Picked apples from the two apple trees in my backyard. Not sure what variety (resembled red delicious), but they made 4 apple crisps. Used an apple/potato corer/peeler. They were sweet enough that I halved the brown sugar to 1/2 c, doubled the oats to 1 c, and adjusted the spices to 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp cloves. Also filled the pans generously, leaving enough room for the topping, and served with vanilla ice cream.

Really good, I cut it back to about 2 servings but didn't measure everything exact and added a bit of cinnamon for our own tastes bakes them in individual ramekins.  Will be making this a lot this fall and winter.

Wonderful recipe!  I added cinnamon to the apples but otherwise followed the recipe to a "T"--the nuts add a great crunch to the oats topping.

This was the best apple crisp we have ever had, and so easy to make my 10 year old helped me.  We doubled the oats since it's our favorite part, and it was delicious right out of the oven and even the next day!

My husband and I loved it. Very tasty and simple to make. Loved the walnuts in it, the extra crunch in great! :) P.S: I also doubled the oats!

Great recipe.  I added pecans rather than walnuts as I prefer their flavor with apples and tossed some craisins over the apples prior to the topping.  I agree with doubling the oats and the addition of cinnamon.  This was easy and delicious.

I have make this several times, it is great.  Try using pears instead of apples.  We had a bumper pear crop this year and it is also great with pears.

I love this! I made the following changes: -just a tiny bit of water -extra bit of flour -extra bit of oats -little less sugar -subbed cinnamon for nutmeg (didn't have nutmeg) -no nuts (didn't have any) -peeled and cubed apples (I like the cubes because they keep their crunch a bit better than thin slices).  This is one of my favorite desserts ever!!!

This is fantastic, albeit a little too sweet for me.  I've made this three times and substituted cinnamon for nutmeg, didn't add the nuts (hubby doesn't like nuts), added extra oats, and substituted 1/2 cup of the brown sugar for 1/4 cup of white sugar and it is awesome.  If you eat this with ice cream, you definately don't need the added sugar.  My family loves this!!

The flavor of this is wonderful, but it the way it is written, there is too much "crisp" for the amount of apples.  Next time I will either double the apples or half the "crisp".

I also added cinnamon and extra oats.  I only had Gala apples which probably is why this was a tad too sweet for me.  I am sure with a tart apple this is perfect!

Yummy apple crisp recipe and the walnuts made a great addition! I made a few small changes such as adding lemon zest since I love the lemon flavor with the apple. Also, I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg. Next time I would mix the apples with a little flour to thicken their liquid better when cooking.

Very YUMMY!!!! We doubled the topping part of the recipe as some have suggested and used granny smith apples. We served it with vanilla ice cream. We will be making this again, a winner especially during apple harvest season.

WOW- This is soooo good!! This has a great buttery taste and a great crunchy texture.  I tried the topping from this on an apple pie rather than a traditional crust and it was a hit!   I used Empire apples, a traditional pie crust for the bottom and followed the rest of the recipe as is.

Tastes real good.  Just used some frozen apples I had.  Made this twice already.  The second time I set the oven to 375 and baked for 30 minutes.  Turned out good and the walnut were toasty.

I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the crumble mixture and some dried cranberries to the apples and it turned out pretty okay. The crumle was great with the walnuts but I found that I had too much water left on the bottom of my cooking dish. But regardless, it's a great recipe :)

I made this with a combination of Galas and Granny Smiths (both peeled), and I used crushed walnuts and pecans. If I were to make it again, I would add a little cinnamon to the nutmeg. This was amazing served with vanilla ice cream. I'm not a big dessert fan, but this was awesome. Thanks so much!

This is pretty good.  I think next time, I'll substitute cinnamon in place of the nutmeg.  I didn't like that it gave it a raisin or mincemeat flavor (in my opinion).

Excellent.  I added about a cup of crushed walnuts to the cripsy topping. Used lime juice instead of lemon, worked out well.

This is a decent apple crisp. I would have a thicker layer of apples though. I used a combonation of granny smith, gala and red delicious. Basically what I had in the fridge. I think next time I will add more oats to the crumble mixture. But overall a nice topping.

Everyone told me this was great.  I didn't get a chance to try it because it was gone so quickly.

Made this as a healthier desert for Thanksgiving and it turned out GREAT!  I doubled the rolled oats crumbles and wish I had made more, they are yummy.  This is so easy I will make it regularly.  Thank you for sharing.

This recipe came to my rescue when I discovered that the recipe I was using was incomplete!  I was bringing the dessert to a dinner party and thus did not want to experiement on my own.  This recipe not only allowed me to save the project, but it proved to be even better than the original recipe I'd used.  Thanks!
