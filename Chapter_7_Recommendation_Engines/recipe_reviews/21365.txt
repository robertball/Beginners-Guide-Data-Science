This is a very tasty, sweet potatoe recipe without using any sugar.  I boiled the potatoes because some review said it took a long time to bake.  I mashed them and added the orange juice and raisons and everyone loved it.

I followed the directions, and checked the potatoes after 45 minutes. Well, the ones on bottom were somewhat tender, but the ones on top were still firm. So, I had to continually rotate them and even add more orange juice. This is slightly inconvenient, especially since the main dish was already done. They tasted okay, but not good enough to do again.

instead of orange juice I cut up some oranges and added them. it took longer than 45 minutes, but came out great, especially with a little cinnamon on top.

This recipe provides a side item with a sweet flavor.  Also, it is healthy food, being low-fat with antioxidant-rich sweet potatoes and raisins.  I liked the recipe enough to use it twice so far.  Thanks, Tali, for sharing this recipe.

I forgot to mention that I added a cinnamon blend to mine because I love the spices. Since there was no picture posted, I took a snapshot of my serving bowl before devouring the rest.

After reading other reviews, I sliced my potatoes thinly and covered the baking dish with foil.  That did the trick; the potatoes were very tender, but not mushy after only 45 mins.  I also used golden raisins instead of regular raisins.  A nice, simple and healthy side dish.

I boiled the potatoes instead of baking them like other reviewers suggested and the texture was perfect. My husband and 1 year-old daughter LOVED this! I actually wasn't a big fan - it tasted too much like candy to me, so I added butter to my portion and it was fine. I made it with chicken tenders and it went well together.

The flavors were great in this.  And I was looking for a good sweet preperation for sweet potatoes without adding all of the marshmallow and brown sugar that make it more like dessert!!  But like other reviewers said - the timing was wrong.  I ended putting them in the mocrowave for about 5 min to try and get them done after the timing in the oven left them only half cooked.  Once they were finished they were delish!

Just okay.  A good healthy recipe, but too orangey for my preference.

Just had these for Thanksgiving. TO DIE FOR. All I added was a few chopped pecans. I did use much more than 1/2 cup orange juice but the outcome was perfect. The tang from the OJ and the sweet from the raisins entwined with the sweet potatoes is a heavenly experience. So much better than the syrupy, marshmallow, goup that is the norm. AND so much healthier.

It wasn't all that great.  I had to keep adding o.j. and I found out I don't really care for the cooked mushy raisins.

This turned out terrible for me. After 45 min., I was barely able to puncture the potatoes. We didnâ€™t serve the dish for dinner. I think my daughter threw the whole thing out the next day.
