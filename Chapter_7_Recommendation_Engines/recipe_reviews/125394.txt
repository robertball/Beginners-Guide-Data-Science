This was a lifesaver tonight and one hubs and I both really enjoyed! This wasn't a day before pay day issue, just an "I don't feel like going to the store issue" and I was happy to find a side dish with common ingredients readily at hand. I stir fried the celery and carrot separately in sesame oil before adding the rice (no need at all to cover and steam) and added shrimp rather than chicken since that's what was around. No green onions, but chopped fresh chives from the garden was a perfect substitute.  To make this more authentic, I cooked the egg separately in a small saute pan like a crepe, then added it chiffonade style. (Roll the "egg crepe" up like a cigar, then slice into ribbons...then add to rice mixture just before serving) I added a touch of toasted sesame oil for additional flavor, along with a little butter.  Even using ingredients with basic, on hand ingredients this turned out to be a beautiful and delicious dish!

This was an easy recipe that really is great to use up leftovers with! My husband prefers it to be made "teriyaki" flavored - you can buy it, or easily make it by whisking your soy sauce (low sodium *tastes* best) with some brown sugar and a little vegetable oil. Or in a pinch, white sugar and no oil! This recipe is easy no matter how you twist it.  =)   Thanks!

Easy, cheap & satisfying! I used pork rather than chicken, cooked the egg in butter rather than oil for extra flavor, and added about 1 1/2 tsp. five spice. Very good! Thank you CJ!

Simple, quick, and delicious base recipe.  I followed the suggestions of some previous reviews: 1) scrambled eggs in 1tbsp butter, 2) used sesame oil, 3) stir-fried 4 cloves garlic and half a roughly chopped onion in the oil before adding the rice.  To suit my personal tastes I added half a tbsp. red chili paste when adding the soy sauce and about 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro the last 15 seconds of stir-frying.  Will most definitely make again soon.  *also, used Slow-Cooker Turkey Breast from this site instead of chicken because that happened to be the leftovers I had on hand*  Thanks CJ!

Made this for dinner tonight and followed the recipe. The rice was in no way similar to any fried rice I have ever eaten. The rice was beyond bland and had no flavor at all. Sorry this was just awful.

I now use this every time i order-in Chinese as the white rice is always left over, and is usually exactly 3 C. I used toasted sesame oil  for added flavor, and cubed boneless skinless chicken thighs to keep it from being dry (this increases the cooking time). Everyone i have served this loves it -- i suggest a little Tamari poured on when re-heating :)

This was really easy. I used the meat from Nellie's Orange Herb Roasted Chicken
after I boiled the carcass to make chicken broth. I also added some chopped 
sweet onion sauteed the vegetables in a little sesame oil and EVOO before adding the rice. I made Five Spice Chicken Wings (only I used chicken legs) to go with it and stirred in the leftover sauce/drippings into the rice, which made it even more flavorful. I don't know about other cook's that have issues with cooking eggs in with the rice. I cooked mine in a saucepan seperately, then shredded it and added it to the rice. It was easier for me. Very, very good. I'd make this again. This makes a lot and is filling to boot.

Great!!  The only change I made was to use 2 eggs and 1/4 cup egg beaters.  I cooked the eggs into thin omelets and cut them into ribbons.  Also added a little seasame oil before serving.

Meh. This was just so-so - but I think it can be MUCH better after sitting in the fridge overnight. My husband was gifted with a new wok for Christmas. He made tonight's main dish and I made fried rice to serve on the side. As with most new recipes I try, I made a few changes, one out of necessity and a couple due to personal preference. I ommitted the chicken alltogether (didn't have any leftover meat on hand), used half sesame / half veggie oil and subbed a frozen pea & carrot blend for fresh carrots & frozen peas. I also stir-fried my rice on high heat for a considerable amount of time in an attempt to dry it out a bit (this is my main gripe and why I think overnight refrigeration would help - authentic rice is not as moist as this was). As for my eggs, I did not bother cooking them in a separate saute pan "chiffonade" style. I just scrambled them in my wok, chopped coarsley, removed to a bowl to cool and then added to my rice as directed. All in all, this is an OK rice, perfect for using up leftovers or when you have a craving for the restaurant stuff but no money for it. Thanks for sharing, CJ. This was not bad at all. :-)

A huge success at our house! I followed the hints of another cook, adding cashews and a little sesame oil. I also cooked the rice in chicken stock.  Delicious and very filling.

Rice was bland. A good start but needed more flavor. I add chopped garlic, some fresh ginger. Diced red pepper, and some sesame oil. Used day old rice which tends to wwork better with fried rice.

I use this recipe (with a few modificatons for it to blend well with a beef stir fry recipe on here) to create a fried rice for brocolli beef.  It serves my purpose well and am glad you shared.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Super easy & yummy!  I omitted the celery (we aren't fans) and used frozen mixed veggies instead of just peas.  Add some hot crusty bread and canned peaches and you've got a great meal!

I made this rice today. Got all the ingredients together. I ended up using beef instead of chicken cause that's what I had handy. I followed the directions to the T and it came out pretty good. The reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because it didn't exactly like Fried Rice you eat at a Chinese Restaurant it taste more like Fried Rice with meat and vegetables. I was looking for a recipe that tasted like it came from a Chinese Restaurant.

Oh my! It's not the day before pay day for me, but I did have leftover brown rice and grilled chicken in the fridge. This is only my second time trying a recipe like this and I hit the jackpot! This is absolutely delicious! I did make a couple changes to match my pantry though - used brown rice as I stated before, left out the peas and green onions cause I had none but added in a green bell pepper. Added some cayenne to the egg cause I like a bit of heat. Totally yummy! I will definitely be making this one again! Thank you for sharing!

A great way to use up leftovers so I also added some green bell pepper to the mix. The chicken I added was also leftover from a recipe on this awesome website called: Soy and Garlic Marinated Chicken. They went very well together.

Good recipe- flavorful and not too terrible nutritionally.  My husband and I both liked it.  I wouldn't change anything.

10 months later:  We have now eaten this almost every week since we discovered it.  We did change it though- brown rice, no chicken, extra eggs.

I would have given this five starts except that I made it exactly as written and it was a little bland.  But the recipe itself makes excellent fried rice.  The next time I make it I will spice it up with some teriyaki sauce like others suggested and perhaps more veggies and some garlic.  But I have looked for a good fried rice recipe before and I think this is a great basic one to use.

My changes: I had some pulled pork left over that I used in place of the chicken.  I didn't have frozen peas but I had mixed veggies frozen and used those. I didn't have green onions so I used a tablespoon of chives and chopped fine a small yellow onion. Also I used a teaspoon of minced garlic and a tiny little dash of Chinese 3-spice. Be careful with that last ingredient because it can easily overpower and take over. In a very small quantity it adds flavor that people remark on but cant quite say what it is. YUMMY! Pork fried rice is great.

Soy sauce in general is a killer for your body, so I use much less than the recipe and use the “low-salt” version.  The recipe is a family favorite!

I haven't made this yet but I'm giving 5 stars anyway for this reason...Back in the early 60's as a young child, we lived in Japan and had a Japanese housekeeper/babysitter/friend.  She would fix this almost exact recipe for our lunch.  She would use whatever she found in the kitchen and as a youngster, my favorite was cut up hot dogs!!  -:)  Delicious and such good memories...
In the meantime, I have some leftover chicken in there so guess what my dinner will be.  Thank you for  posting this recipe and reminding me of how good simple can be.

Turned out great! I opted to add a cheap bag of steamed 4 blend veggies which included peas, carrots, corn, and green beans. Then topped with about a cup of diced grilled pineapple chunks. ??

This was a great base recipe to which I added reviewers suggestions. I used brown rice (made in Instapot!) and added onion & garlic to wok 1st. Cooked til onion translucent, then added other veggies and a dash of sesame oil for flavor. Then added rice, chicken, soy sauce, and some toasted almond slivers. Had made the egg in a separate skillet: rolled the "crepe" and sliced chiffonade like ther reviewers and added it to the wok at end. Left out peas b/c rest of family doesn't like them; I added them to my bowl when serving.  Very tasty and easy! Good way to use up leftover Sunday roast chicken!

Delicious!! I don't think I'll ever order it from the chinese restaurant again. It might have helped that I used a marinated meat. I had leftover teriyaki marinated pork tenderloin that I chopped up and used instead of the chicken. I also used 2 cups of frozen peas & carrots, instead of the shredded carrots and peas. I also added about a handful of bean sprouts. The 2 tablespoons of soy sauce is modest, so taste and add more as needed.

I first tried this a few months ago.  Now it's in our regular rotation, I make it at least once a month.  I make it pretty much as specified, though I do buy a frozen pea/carrot mix to make it faster.  I can cook the chicken ahead and freeze it.  With precooked chicken and frozen veggies, I can have dinner on the table in about 10 minutes, which is a must with 3 kids and full time jobs.  I've also subbed other veggies when needed, and I even made it without the chicken once.  Still a great recipe.  And if you run out of soy sauce, the homemade soy sauce recipe works very well.  I use jasmine rice, which is a good quality slow-cook rice.  We eat rice several times a week so I almost always have some in the fridge.  This recipe does work better with cold rice as specified, but I've made it with hot rice, too.  (Side note...we had a Chinese exchange student live with us for a summer.  I made this once and she cried because it smelled just like her mom's.  I doubt it tasted quite the same, but she loved it and had it for lunch every day that week.)_

Very good. I too used sesame oil and cooked the eggs in butter. I omitted the meat, since I used this as a side dish. I used celery, carrots, and onions.

This didn't have the "restaurant" taste I'm looking for. Perhaps will try sesame oil next time? After making, tweaked with Oyster sauce and more soy sauce which for me improved the flavor. Also, the peas were too sweet, will leave them out or cut way back next time. This is a great starter recipe! Thank you.

This was great. Everyone loved it. I used a rotisserie chicken from the local deli, and olive oil instead of vegetable oil. It was easy and quick to make. From start to finish dinner was on the table in less than 45 min.

Good. Next time I will use the instant packet rice though. I'm not great at making regular rice so my dish was a bit stodgy. I will add pineapple next time, may sound a bit weird but with every bite I kept thinking "needs pineapple"!

This recipe was wonderful.  Our family likes eggs, so we added an extra one, and also had some leftover mushrooms we put in.  We thought we'd have some leftovers with such a large bowl, but we didn't have any because it was so delicious!

This was just okay.  My family ate it, but no one raved over it.  Was really dry when heated for leftovers.  I suggest sprinkling with a bit of water if you are heating left overs.

This recipe was good. I must say that I did make a few changes mostly in the preparation method. The only ingredient I added was a splash of sherry when cooking my chicken. I used chicken thighs also as a way to have a more moist meat. I also used some water to scrape the bottom of the pan after each stir frying. I fried the vegetables separately starting with the carrot and then last the frozen peas. I was generous with the green onions since the recipe does not call for onions. This was a very good recipe that I would gladly make again.

As all Asians know, fried rice is extremely versatile dish for leftovers. My mom would throw whatever she had into it - hot dogs, bacon, bologna, ham, spam...in addition to the usual favorites. Now I'm getting hungry again.

Really good - we liked it with modifications. Used butter to scramble the eggs. Used toasted sesame oil and cooked green onion, diced carrots, diced mushrooms and the thawed peas in along with some red pepper flakes. Then added the rice (brown and cooked in chicken broth) and chicken.  Added a little brown sugar to the soy sauce.  Even my picky eater  had to agree she liked it.  Thanks for recipe

I followed the outline but had no leftovers so I used different veggies. 

1. I boiled the chicken in sliced scallions, water, a splash of soy sauce, and a teaspoon of Turmeric. I then separated it with two forks.  
2. I sauted broccoli and celery in one pan, green beans and carrot slices in another, and onions, garlic, a mild pepper, and some shitake mushrooms in a third.  I did this because I was scared I would have some mushy veggies and some overly crispy. 
3. I followed the rice instructions, then threw it all in my wok with soy and teriyaki sauce to taste. 

Wow. My first time making fried rice and it was easily better than restaurant grade.

Yes, this was easy and good but lacked something.  I will add sprouts and water chestnuts next time to see if that enhances the flavor.

Very good as written. But basic enough to make changes if one so desires.  The only thing I did different was how to cook the egg. When it's time to add the egg I push all the rice over to the sides of the skillet making a well in the center. I then pour the egg into the center well and gently scramble till done, then incorporate into the rice. I found that the white rice needs to be cooked a day ahead then refrigerated in order to be the at the right dryness level. Usually when I make this I use pork, just a personal preference.

Great use of our leftovers.  We even added some fresh pineapple and some leftover mixed vegetables.  A great recipe to make all your own depending on what you have available.
I don't understand why anyone said it was bland when it's all cooked and you can taste it as you make it. If it's bland you just add something to it that you enjoy. It's not rocket science.
We will be making this again.

Can't believe that I have not reviewed this before.  I have made it so many times!  Usually use cooked pork instead of chicken and sometimes add some shrimp.  Also add a bit of sesame oil when adding in the pork.  This is really yummy!

I did sub turkey for chicken and some blood orange teriyaki sauce for soy sauce, but it was AMAZING otherwise! I've already been requested to make it again by the whole family!

This turned out to be a really delicious meal. I happened to have all ingredients on hand, including a ton of cooked rice from a previous dinner, and it all came together beautifully. You control the amount of sodium (I used low sodium soy sauce)and other unwelcome ingredients to serve up a truly tasty dish. I did start with a sautéed onion because we like lots of it and fudged a bit adding more veggies than called for but pretty much followed the recipe verbatim. I didn't feel like grating the carrots so I thinly sliced them on the diagonal. Try this one! You'll love it!!

This has quickly become a favorite in our house.  I use what is in the fridge - tonight was red bell pepper, celery, onions, scrambled eggs for the vegetarian version  and I added diced ham for the carnivores in the house.  The celery works as well as water chestnuts for crunch.  The red peppers are visually appealing.  I never have tried carrot, although I frequently add green peas or soybeans.  As a recipe, it's flexible and lighter than fried rice often is.

Thanks for this recipe!  I used what I had on hand.  Instead of chicken I sliced and sautéed a portabello mushroom, added to the recipe some bean sprouts, a dash of ginger, a clove of garlic (I didn't have onions), omitted soy sauce as my fiancé didn't want soy sauce.  A great way to both enjoy and make the best of what you have.

My family loved it. I used left over brown rice from the take out Chinese food from a few days before. I used coconut oil to "stir fry" the rice. I used corn instead of peas and added left over green beans.
I didn't have green onions so I used a packet of onion soup and added a small amount of water.

I've made this recipe a few times now, and after the initial try, I modified it a bit each time.   I find that this is a good "base recipe" that really begs for individual  customization according to one's taste.  
In my case, I first fried up the vegetables in sesame oil, for authentic Chinese flavor.  I then proceeded with the rest of the steps, substituting teriyaki sauce for the soy sauce, to give it a little sweetness.   I, too, added some Chinese Five Spice blend to it, and didn't bother covering and steaming the rice, either.  I've used different types of meat each time.
One VERY important detail to ensure the success of this dish is to use COLD  rice!  Using just-made or warmed rice will result in an unappetizing, sticky blob.  I got this tip from a Chinese friend, and it has proven true every time.

Good base recipe.  I made quite a few changes after the first time I cooked it.  I first sauteed vegetables in butter/sesame oil: sweet chopped onion (I didn't have green onions), grated ginger root, minced garlic, chopped red bell pepper, and bok choy along with the mushrooms, carrots, and celery.  I then added thinly sliced sauteed pork, the scrambled eggs, soy sauce and the rice just long enough to heat through.  I also added chili paste as one reader suggested to give it a little kick.

This was pretty good. I used sesame oil to give it more flavor. I used broccoli instead of peas, left out the chicken, and added garlic. It does need more soy sauce, however.

Delicious!  I used White and Brown rice and added leftover corn on the cob. :)

I have made this twice. The first time as published. The second with garlic increased and some fresh asparagus. Hubby is saying good honey (twice!) as we are eating it now. I wanted to post a fresh perspective. Of course he is going to start yellling at me to start eating. Paired it with a Dry white Williamburg James River White. I don't know a thing about wine, but it seemes to go well.

My family loves this.  It tastes just like what we get from the nearby restaurant!    It's super easy to make - I'm not real exact with measurements or cutting the veggies.  We use brown rice rather than white rice, and I toss the peas in frozen.  We also add bean sprouts.

This was very good. I followed others' advice and used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil.My family loves garlic and onion, so I also added a 1/2 tablespoon of garlic powder and some chopped yellow onion. I doubled the recipe and there was none left! I will definitely cook this again soon.

This was so easy to make and tasted great too! I used 4 eggs with carrots, broccoli and green peas. I put the rooster hot sauce with garlic in it on mine which made it exceptional. Will make again even without leftover chicken!

Very good, my husband and I both had seconds.  Skipped the celery & chicken.  Didn't have green onions so used garlic.

Really yummy! I took the advice of other readers and used butter to fry the egg and sesame oil for the rice. I also added shitake mushrooms since I had them. Great quick dinner!

This recipe was easy to make, I used some left over steak instead of chicken.  My whole family loved it, even my picky 4 year old cleaned his plate.  I will indeed make it again.
