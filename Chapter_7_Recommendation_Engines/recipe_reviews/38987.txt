These were great cookies.  Toll-house makes some holiday choc. chip cookie dough so we used that to make these even more festive.  We broke the pecans in a tad smaller peices and really didn't work too hard on making the turtle "shape."  When placing the dough atop of the pecans ~ we pressed it down just a bit in hopes that the pecans would bake into the dough (which worked a little).  Finally, after drizzeling the caramel, I had some chocolate almond bark I had melted for pretzels and used the leftover and drizzeled that in the opposite direction - giving them a lattice effect of caramel and chocolate.  A nice cookie twist to an old candy favorite.  Thanks Nestle!

This recipe was a chore to make without premade cookie dough, but still well worth it. We chopped the pecans into smaller pieces to make the head and legs like the original chocolates and suffered some limb loss when transfering from cooling tray to tin. We added chocolate drizzled over the caramel on top and it is a hit! Not sure how they will keep out of the fridge with the chocolate.
