Why are people constantly adding things like cheese, meat and the like to bruschetta? If you want that, make a sandwich! It's hard to improve on this tried and true take on the simple ingredients that came together to make a classic!

Replace the parmesan cheese by a tablespoon of good balsamic vinegar and this will be a healthier bruschetta. DELICIOUS!

As a novice cook this recipes simplicity called out to me. Very simple preparation, the only thing I tried differently was adding 2 tsp of basalmic vinagar. It really helped kick things up. Delicious! I  look forward to preparing this recipe again.

Try actually putting the sliced bread on a real charcoal grill outside first.  Toast each side so it has nice grill lines on it, and so the bread almost is burnt a bit on the edges, not just toasted.  The "grilled" bread actually improves the overall taste and makes this more rustic and authentic. It takes extra work, but it's worth it.

Great recipe. My family and I couldn't stop eating this, it was so good. I did add some vinegar to the recipe as some other users suggested. I'm glad I did cause it made it that much more good.

I just want to commend you on this recipe. Everybody LOVED it and my husband said that it was better than his favorite place for bruschetta! I did add the tbsp. of balsamic vinegar and I also added a lillle cut up onion. Other than that I followed this to the T and it was fabulous.  Will always use this recipe. Thanks again!

I made this yesterday and it is excellent. I followed exact directions although I added grated parmesan to it before I baked. My husband says it is better than any he's had at a restaurant (: I doubled the batch today. I know it will be gone in no time! thank you for the recipe

This a good basic bruschetta.  If you're new to bruschetta, or have just started to cook, you can't really go wrong with this one.  I would advise putting only one clove of garlic in at first and then adjusting as needed.  One was more than enough for us, and we're garlic lovers in this house.

Quick and delicious!  A great starter for any meal, or even a late night snack!  I did change things a bit though- I didn't have any fresh basil, chives or parsley so I just used what was in my spice cabinet.  I also sprinkled a little mozzarella cheese on my french bread before putting the rest of the ingredients on top.  I then baked it for about 10 minutes at 350.

This is a homerun recipe....and if made the day before even more outstanding.  I will never purchase store-bought bruschetta again.  I also took the advice of previous raters to lightly toast the french bread prior to pairing.  It makes a huge difference!

Liked this a lot! Other than the oil, made this entirely from my garden :o) I added 1/2 a small white onion because the chives weren't quite strong enough for my taste. My tomatoes were VERY juicy, next time I will strain the tomatoes and only add a little of the juice back.

Very good.  I used dried herbs instead of fresh (do teaspoons instead of tablespoons) and didn't use any chives.

Then I served it on sliced bread and sprinkled it with Parmesan cheese.

Bruchetta is awesome! i made mine pretty close to this recipe, but slightly different. i actually made mine like the one the movie julie & julia. so what i did was fry some french bread in olive oil, until it was a deep golden brown, then topped it with quarted cherry tomato's that i mixed with garlic, parsley salt pepper an olive oil. then take basil and tear some up, and put it on top.  it is sooooo good that way! make sure thought hat the oil is HOT before you put the bread in it! other wisae it will just soak into the bread!

Make it a meal and kick it up a notch! 
Here's the how-to: After making this (or your version of this), warm it in a pan and serve it over lightly blackened grilled chicken. Pair it with Pasta Roni's Angel Hair Pasta with Herbs. Warming it makes a lovely light vinagrette style sauce that is delicious served on top of these noodles. Dust the whole dish off with some freshly grated parmesan. Outstanding and the whole meal only takes around 15 minutes!

Easy, delicious, and elegant.  I added 2 tsp balsamic vinegar, as suggested by other reviewers.  I brought the toast and tomato mixture to the table separately to allow diners to top their toast right before enjoying it.  The leftover toast was able to be stored without getting soggy. I'll make this again and again!

One of the best I have made and very easy! I didn't have any chives and it was still great. I added feta cheese only because I add feta to anything I can!

I made this recipe for Memorial Day weekend.  It was such a huge success!!!!!  Only thing I added was some Parmesan cheese, gives it a little zing and thickens it also.  Lots of garlic, bring mints with you!

This was great! I LOVE bruschetta and this was fantastic! My fiance loved it too! It didn't need it, but I added just a touch of balsamic vinegar only because it's my favorite. Be sure to give this recipe a try!

This was so good!  I made Mama D's Italian Bread (also on allrecipes) toasted it and served it with this Bruschetta, it was fantastic.  My husband said it was the best thing he'd had in ages!!  Oh and, my tomatoes were pretty sweet so I did add a splash of balsamic vinegar as suggested and it balanced out the flavours really well.

This Bruschetta recipe turned out really well! The only thing that I will change if I make it again would be to remove some of the oil. I thought it was just a big greasy, but overall, great flavor!

After watching Julie and Julia I HAD to come home and eat bruschetta!  This was absolutely delish!  Toasted the bread with some olive oil, sprinkled a little cheese on the bread as it came out of the oven and topped with the bruschetta.  Unbelievable!  It was our whole dinner accompanied by a nice bottle of wine!

This was SO GOOD!!!!  I let it sit in the fridge for about a day or two before my party, then when it came time to assemble, I made a garlic butter sauce and brushed it on both sides of the bread, put the bruschetta on top, and then popped it in the oven on 350 (?) for about 10ish minutes or so, just until the bread was toasted on the edges.  SOOOOOOO YUMMMMMY!!!!

This was really great! I used just 1/4 cup olive oil instead of the 1/3 cup, but otherwise no changes. The fresh herbs in there make it really bright! I had to add about 1/2 tsp of salt to really get the flavor, if that's any help to those of you wondering what the "to taste" thing means! (if you've never had a dish, how do you know when 'to taste' has been reached? LOL!) since I made it in the afternoon and we were going to eat an early supper, I let it sit on the counter instead of in the fridge because fridges are not kind to the taste of fresh ripe tomatoes! We enjoyed this on homemade crostini with an Italian spaghetti meal. YUM!

This is the only bruschetta recipe you will ever need. Super easy to make. Tastes super fresh and all the flavors are well balanced with the salt, pepper, and garlic. We like it best with Cabernet or Pinot Noir.

My husband and I ate this bruschetta on baguettes after the bruschetta had spent 2 hours in the fridge. We did not like it; there was something overpowering about it. We put the bruschetta back in the fridge and had high hopes it would taste better in another 24 hours. Incredible! The flavours mingled very well. Will definitely make again.

I made this for a work bbq so I had to quadruple the recipe.  There was none left - they devoured it and were raving about it the whole time!
I used 3 diff types of tomatoes: red, orange, and yellow.  Herbs fresh my garden makes all the difference   :)
Also b/c it was a daytime work bbq I used 6 cloves of garlic instead of 8 and it was perfect.
