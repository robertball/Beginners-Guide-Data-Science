I am a soup lover. I wanted to make avacado soup and thought I would give this one a try.  Wow!  I didn't use as many jalapeno's as called for and removed the seeds.  Glad I did.  Three peppers were just about right for us.  This is the perfect soup to accompany your Mexican Food dinner. We had a good Mexican beer with our meal and it was perfect.

This was fantastic!!  I loved the lime juice in this soup- it gave it a nice tang.  It was very filling, but light so you can have it any day of the week.  I actually wish it had more avocado so I added 2 instead of 1 1/2.  I also added a dollop of sour cream at the end and it gave the soup a nice rich flavor.  Will definetly make this again.

I hate to be the lone disenting voice but we ended up throwing most of this out.  I highly suggest you add the lime a little bit at a time to taste. It was just waaay too sour and tangy for us.  I took some of the leftovers and poured off most of the tangy broth and replaced it with plain chicken broth.  I then topped it with shredded Monterey Jack and some thin crushed tortilla chips.  It was much improved but still probably not a soup I would make again. Sorry.

very tastey! I made quite a bit to feed my mom, my sister, and some hungry men, and it satisfied all! My sister doesn't like cilantro and my dad doesn't like avocado, so rather than add them to the soup i added them to individual bowls, and everyone could have as much as they liked of each. I wasn't going to toast the tortilla strips 'cause i figured they'd just get soggy anyway (so what's the point?) But since i was preheating the oven for something else i did it anyway. I'm glad i did, because the next day i just threw some torilla strips in with the left overs and they were a whole different kind of soggy! tortilla mush. Definately toast them first. :) I also added corn for a little more color, and a tad less garlic. I threw in some more spices toward the end for more flavor, to make up for slightly less jalapeno. (I didn't want to kill everyone with the ammount called for in this recipe!) It could have used more chicken for our tastes as well, but totally a keeper. Very easy to modify! The lime was excellent, i could have used more. I served this with cuban black beans best spanish rice, and ultimate frozen strawberry margaritas. What a hit!

I fell in love with chicken and lime soup while traveling in the Yucatan years ago.  When I found this recipe, I fell in love all over again. This has become a staple for me, and I have developed a few variations- first, I usually double the avocado and tomato for a heartier soup; sometimes I add sour cream.  For a vegetarian version I eliminate the chicken and substitute vegetable broth, and add ground cumin, corn and black beans (canned works fine, one can each, rinsed and drained). The soup is beautiful and spicy, perfect for a light summer meal with fresh garden tomatoes, or as a colorful and spicy winter treat.

I added a can of pinquito beans and some frozen corn to this recipe and it was very filling and flavorful. The cilantro and real lime juice really make it stand out. Very good.

I really like this recipe. No one else at my house would try it, though.  Anyway, the second time I made this I used 2 avocados (I LOVE avocado) pureed them -(I liked the creamy texture), and used pre-packaged fajita chicken strips for easier preparation.  I also used corn chips both times.  I adjusted the seasoning a little (Tony Chachere's), just to kick it up a notch because of the extra avocado.  YUM!!  Definitely a new comfort food for me!  FOLLOW-UP:  You might not want to use chicken buillion cubes for the broth.  I tried that when out of canned broth and it is WAY too salty.

Good base! Substituted can of green chiles for the jalopenos, doubled the cilantro, added thinly sliced mushrooms, and shredded cabbage and carrots for a flavorful and filling meal. Will definitely make again!

I am not usually a fan of soup with broth and lots of vegetables (I'm more of a creamy/cheesy soup kind of person)... but I love avocados and lime so I thought I'd give this a try.  And WOW!!!  This is now my number one favorite soup.  I make it at least once a week, using leftover chicken, or lemon marinated chicken.  Doesn't matter, it's good no matter what.  It's the no fail soup.  Love it, love it, love it.  Thank you so much!

This was a very tasty recipe that is easily thrown together in a matter of minutes. The reasons this is not a five start recipe are that it needs more avocado and spices. I used 2 avocados and threw in 1/4 tsp of cumin and chili powder plus a little less than 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. I like my food spicy, but in my opinion those are the spices that need to be used in this soup. Also, I used blue corn tortilla chips instead of baking tortillas, 2 roma tomatoes and only 3 jalapenos (not to sound like an organic foods snob but the difference in heat between conventional and organic is astronomical). I will make this again at some point I'm sure, the only thing I will do differently next time is puree the avocados in a food processor to thicken up the soup and add one more avocado.

This soup is awesome and really easy to make. I used half a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles instead of the fresh tomato and jalepenos. I also seved it with Lime Tostitos instead of making the others. Everyone loved it. Thanks! I have already made it twice since this review!

I got creative, I added cheese to the tortilla chips and then baked them. I also cut up litte squares of montery jack at the end and add them to the hot soup right before serving. I also used red onion, a little extra lime. I made for 6 it suggested 1 1/12 avocado? I used 3. Entire family loved it.

This is a great healthy soup! I made exactly as written except used extra lime (which probably wasn't a good idea), extra avocado (which WAS a good idea), and store-bought corn tortilla chips to save on time.  Turned out great, definitely on the spicy side tho so if you're sensitive to spice cut back on the jalepinos. Will definitely make again! Lots of flavor without using a ton of seasoning.

I used lime juice, not fresh, and 1/4 cup was too much. I'll probably cut the lime juice in half next time. I would like more avocados. It was delicious though! I added just a pinch of cumin as well to give a little more mexican flare. AND I was feeding this to a 3 and 1 year old so I skipped the jalapenos and opted for 1/2 can of green chiles. Still good and not too spicy! Oh, and when it says 4 servings it's not kidding. It's 4 servings of about 1-1/2 cups each. Next time I'll double it for sure!

Everyone loves this soup and wants the recipie.  I had it in Mexico and didn't think I would ever find a recipie.  I double the avocados, shred the chicken and leave out the jalapenos.  In Mexico they put in some kind of stringy cheese also.  I can't figure out what they used.  I tried mozarella but it just isn't the same.  This is my new favorite soup!!

Very delicious! My family loved it. I added about a cup of leftover mexican rice for the last minute of simmering. I don't think it really added or took away from the taste, it just made it a bit more filling. With or without rice, I will definitely make this again.

A fantastic soup! I chose not to bake the corn tortilla strips for a garnish and used the crush corn tortilla chips that I had on hand instead. They worked just fine. I only used two jalapenos and three cloves of garlic. Eight cloves seemed like a bit too many and I don't prefer my dishes to be overly spicy. I also added some cumin to the soup as the chicken cooked. Instead of fresh tomato, I used a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilis. My boyrfriend and I (both mexican food enthusiasts) really enjoyed this soup.

I LOVED this soup...although I was the only one in the family that felt that way.    Followed the recipe exactly and was happy that my soupless dh and kids didn't have seconds, because it was all mine! :-)  The lime and cilantro were a great flavor combo.

Delicious!!!!!! I used two jalapenos and I think that was the right call.  Everything else was used as called for in the recipe.  I got the urge to top it with sour cream though it made it even better.  Nice and warm/spicy broth with chunks of fresh veggies...how could you go wrong?!

I found this to be very good.  The lime gives this a bright, fresh flavor.  I do agree that this is better with a bit more avocado.  If you like the flavor of jalapeños but not the heat, try seeding them.  I will be making this again!

A great soup & different.
I made it a couple times. 
I used 4 avacados and put them in the food processor before adding into the soup.Makes it really smooth & creamy.
I seeded the jalpenos before dicing them.
I like the tang from the lime.
Also I didn't have a tomato so i used a can of diced tomatoes with chilies, they worked perfect.
I'll make this again.
It also freezes well and if  good thawed and reheated.
Thank you for a differnt and delicious recipe.

This was good but not great.  I love all of the ingredients, so I thought this would be really delicious.  It seemed like something was missing, though.  Or maybe the proportions were off.  I'm not sorry I made it, but I probably won't make it again.

This soup is unbelievable.   When I made it for a friend, she suggested I quit my job and open a soup shop! The lime (and all those jalapenos!) really makes it. I cannot wait to make it again!

This was a pretty good soup, and it was easy and quick to make. I added a little more lime juice and a few dashes of chipotle sauce (like Tabasco or Bufalo chipotle sauces) for my taste.

This was a good soup overall.  I really liked the lime flavor that dominated.  The soup was just too watery though, but I'm not a fan of broth only soups.  Maybe adding some cream or something to it.  I did blend a portion of the soup, but it was still just too liquidy.

This is my absolute favorite soup recipe ever!  Exactly as written.  We have made it several times now and I love the layers of flavor. I do seed and devein the jalepeno so my children can handle it, but this is a fantastic recipe!  Definitely a family favorite and often requested.  Thank you so much, Michelle.

Made exactly other than added rinsed black beans. Key, fresh lime juice, NOT bottled! We topped with shredded lettuce and sour cream. Oh,  and fry up those corn tortillas. You won't regret it!  Delicious.  Don't hold back on the other ingredients.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this! I made a few changes— I don’t like too much spice so I only used two jalapeños which was more than enough for us. I added a can of black beans, sweet kernel corn and a can of diced tomatoes. Next time I will use more broth and more chicken. I think also instead of dicing the chicken, I’ll cook separately and shred. The avocado was key to helping control the spice of this soup. We will definitely make this again!

I added fresh corn and used one less jalapeno. It was amazing and still spicy enough. My four year old ate 2 bowls.

I love avocado, lime, and cilantro. I can't take spice so we reduced the jalapeño, but only my husband could eat it. It was still to hot for me! So beware. I'll try it again without the jalapeño or try the mild chili peppers, then my husband can add the jalapeño.

This soup is so good, so easy, and perfectly guilt free! With a few edits to make it fit my liking this is a new regular for me. I double it up and enjoy it all week, I haven't gotten sick of it yet.
- I omit the tortillas because I don't like them.
- Same with mushy tomatoes, so they're out too.
- I add corn as the reviews suggested.
- I find that the avocado doesn't retain its flavor well when reheated, so I like to put it in my individual plate every time I reheat it so that its nice and fresh.
-  A dollop of sour cream or greek yogurt is a must!

Yum!

Great, unique taste! I am very glad I halved the amount of jalapenos, but otherwise I prepared as directed. YUMMY!
Update- have made this dish multiple times and still love it. Sometimes I add rice or rice noodles to change things up.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Good stuff.  Less spicy than I thought it would be, even with leaving in most of the jalepeno seeds.  The lime was a little strong, but not horribly so.  A good base soup; we would probably use less lime juice and more spicy peppers next time, along with maybe a little less onion and more chicken.

I made this soup and loved it. I followed the exact recipe except following changes: I used 1 Serrano chili instead of jalapeños, I added 2 tbsp of rice and corn to the soup, I went a bit lite on lime juice too I only used 3/4 of the recommended amount, I used 2 avocados. The taste was amazing. My husband and I loved it.

This was a very good recipe.  The reason for only 4 stars is the chicken.  It looked so plain and bland. I think it should be grilled or sautéed first just for color. The lime and tomatoes were a superb addition to an ordinary soup.  It was a great meal. (We just used bagged tortilla chips)

Made this 2 days ago and was FANTASTIC! Only thing I changed was 2 jalapeños instead of 4 and it had a lot of sizzle! Loved the flavor and it's my new fave soup!! Must be unbelievable if you have a sinus or cold deal  as it's strong!!

This is really good! Wish I had doubled the recipe though, because my husband ate pretty much all of it. I got one bowl..If I make the smaller recipe I may cut back on the lime juice a tad. I did add a very small pinch of cumin.

Absolutely loved this recipe.  I used already shredded roasted chicken to make it easier.  Also, reduced the jalapeno peppers to one as I don't like things too hot.  Also added more garlic.  Wonderful, healthy, and EASY!!!!!!!

Way too many jalapeno's. My mouth is tingling, my nose is running and I'm almost crying. My advice add some dairy and/or cut the number of jalapenos.

This was delicious!  I did cheat a bit. I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I used a can of diced tomatoes. I also used a precooked chicken that I deboned.  It was probably a bit more tomato flavored than the original recipe, but I liked it a lot. Looking forward to Making it again this summer when garden tomatoes are available!

This soup is healing! When you are sick... nothing tastes better or makes you feel better-- I have friend's that call me to make them this soup when the feel bad. 

It has such good flavor! The combination of cilantro, lime, and jalapeños is just so amazing!

Amazing. Even with the jalapeño kick, my kids loved it!  Super flavorful and very fast (which usually don't go together). Great light summer soup.  We will be making this a lot!

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. I followed everything to a tee and it came out prefect. My boyfriend is a chef at a fine dining establishment and he also said it was an amazing recipe. The only thing I changed its I added extra avocado because I live avocados.also, added shredded cheese but we lived it.

I'm giving this 3 stars for now, because it was wayyyy to spicy with the 4 jalapenos the recipe initially called for (and I can handle my spice). I even added another cup of chicken broth, and that didn't touch it. The soup was so spicy that I didn't even finish half a bowl, even with a dollop of sour cream on top to hopefully cool it a little. Nope. 

I like the ingredients in this soup though, so I hope to make it again, with 2 jalapenos at most.

I'll admit I changed this a bit, but the recipe overall is awesome.  I had to decrease the pepper in it, because 4 is too spicy for me and I added an extra avocado.  This was great.

I absolutely love this recipe! I have had it since 2009 (I'm surprised I didn't write a review sooner). The recipe is so easy and it is wonderful. I have never had much leftover when I make this. Truly the best! I usually add corn for a little crunch and sweetness and serve with sour cream and some cheese sprinkled on top.

When I use a recipe for the first time I try to stick to  what the originator of the recipe had chosen.  I just could not bring myself to use 4 whole Jalapeno peppers with seeds chopped.  So I chopped one whole pepper and seeded another before chopping.  The soup was very good but still too hot.  The flavors were great and interesting so next time (and there will be a next time) I am going to use 4 pepper seeded and chopped for flavor and get the heat from a 1/4 tsp cayenne.

WOW! Best soup I've had in a long time. I had made chicken tacos but had a lot of meat left over, so I used it in place of the chicken and fresh tomato. Came out great! I agree the fresh lime juice really adds a special flavor.

soooo good. I made it the night before so the flavors could blend. Used one really big jalapeno, but kept the seeds in. Substituted one whole can of Rotel with green chilies. Sliced the chicken really thinly. Used only 4 cloves of garlic which was plenty (we love spicy food and the ingerdient list as called for would have been too much for us). One addition was a hearty sprinkle of cumin, which really enhanced the flavor. Easy and healthy

LOVED this soup! The only thing I would say is that it calls for 4 jalapeños, and I used 2 larger ones, and it was bordering on too spicy. Next time I would probably either use 2 small ones, 1 large one, or maybe remove the seeds. Will definitely make again!

Very good!  My  husband I I both loved this.  The changes I made were I used a can of original Rotel instead of a tomato (only b/c I'm sick and was lazy), added some shredded montery jack while it was cooking, and only put a few slices of jalapeno's in while it was cooking for the flavor but removed before serving.  The Rotel has green chilies in it.  I also threw it all in my crock pot on high for 4 hrs.  I then topped w/ some low fat sour cream, shredded chedder, and some low fat tortilla chips.  I will definalty make again, but try w/ the tomato and jalapeno to see how it is.

This soup was very good.  I didn't have any fresh jalapenos so I just used the pickled ones and I put too many in so it was very spicy, but still good.  Next time, I will only put a few.   Also, I wasn't paying attention and cooked my chicken first before I put it in and then realized I was supposed to cook the chicken in the broth!  It still turned out great!  It tastes just like the tortilla soup at On The Border.  Thanks for the recipe!

EXCELLENT!!  This was so unbelievably good and easy.  I made it using bottled lime juice and canned tomato - which is not good to substitute but it was all I had on hand and it was still WONDERFUL.  I will make it using all fresh ingredients next time - which will be very soon!  I do need to say my three young children thought that it was too hot - so like other reviewers suggest, you may want to decrease the jalapeno peppers.  My husband and I LOVED it the way it is posted.  Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!

Love this recipe.  Like others, I mash some avocado into the soup and blend to make a creamier soup.  I put in a little less lime as well(about 3/4 of what is written), as it was too strong as written for us.  Great soup!!

This is a great soup - I've made it many times and it is always requested by friends and family.  One of my favorite substitutions is to add 6 - 10 tomatillos for the lime juice.  It gives it a different kind of tart - very rich and yummy.  I usually start them in the chicken stock first and then add everything else.  I usually garnish with tortilla chips, cheese, and maybe a dollop of sour cream or salsa.  You won't be sorry to try this one.

BURN BABY BURN!! Use half the amount of jalapenos, if you want to keep your lips! Other than that it is sooo tasty! The crispy tortillas are the best idea ever!

I made this recipe just as directed.  It was delicious.  Especially right off the fire.  Spicy for the kids but a unique alternative recipe for grown folks. Sure you could thicken it if you want.  To do so, I would use a butter/flour roux heated but unbrowned as my first guess.  ¡Muy sabrosa!

I used frozen chicken breasts, minced garlic and canned jalapenos and still this came out delicious.  It had just enough spice and is surprisingly very filling.  I might add another avocado next time, just for my liking.

This soup was ok, but it didn't have any flavors that wowed me.  Beware: if you don't like spicy this is not for you!  My mouth burned for a long time after.  Omit some or all of the jalapenos if you like less spicy foods.

Very good. Needed more flavor I think. I didn't have lime on hand. But I did add some sour cream and a little Franks Red Hot Sauce w/ Lime, and it improved it a lot. I took out 1/3 of the soup and blended it with the sour cream then added it back in to give it a creamy and chunky texture. But very good and I will make it again

Wasn't as exciting as I expected. Although it's most likely due to my adjusting the flavors to suit our needs (lemon instead of lime juice, no jalepenos, no cilantro). It was edible, just not our favorite.

Tasty, although I felt it was missing a little something.  I tend to like my soups a bit chunkier.  Maybe next time I will add more veggies.

Great recipe!  I have made it twice now.  The first time I used the exact ingredients and blended in some extra avocado.  Last night, I didn't have all the fresh ingredients on hand, so I improvised, and I think it turned out even better!  Instead of fresh tomatoes and jalepenos, I used a can of RoTel tomatoes and chiles with juice.  I also used bottled lime juice, and cut back on the amount just a bit.  I did not blend in any avocado, just left the chunks, and we liked the broth better that way.  We also used plain tortilla chips instead of browning the corn tortillas.  It was a bit spicy for my four year old, so I mixed some sour cream into hers, and it was perfect.  This has become a family favorite, thanks!

Very good soup.  Used a little less jalepeno and a little more avocado.  This is a very adaptable recipe.  I also did about a 1/3 puree to thicken a bit.  I really enjoyed this.

I made this with two avocados and added the enchilada sauce as recommended--nice and spicy!  I also simmered the chicken seperately in some of the broth first, poured the broth off into the soup, and then lightly seared the chicken in the remaining juices until touched with brown.  This added a nice flavor to the chicken that otherwise might have been lost.  Then I blended everything except about 1/3 of the avocado and all of the chicken, added the rest of the avocado and the chicken with the blended soup back into my pot, and heated through.  It was a nice result!  My one complaint is that, although I love lemon, there was just a bit too much with the amount in the recipe.  Next time I'll cut it by a 1/3, I think, and go from there.  I think I'll also have some more avocado and some of the onions and garlic set aside to go in after the blending.  That will give it a great balance between smoothness and the "chunkiness" of a stew.

One of the best soups I've ever made.  I doubled the avacado because I love it.  The lime juice was great and not overpowering at all.  Topped it with shredded mexican cheese and sour cream.  Awesome!

I wasn't crazy about it.  It was pretty hot and just didn't have much to it.  I like the idea about using the blender to thicken it up and I may try that...

I wasn't crazy about this soup until I made one change.  After tasting it and not particularly liking it, I put it in a blender to thicken it, it was like a different soup!!! I used pork instead of chicken, and it came out like a pork stew.  Very good!

I went with 3 jalapeños but pithed and seeded them and minced.  I want to taste something other than just fire and I like jalapeños and almost always have some on hand.   The flavors are really unique with the lime, cilantro  and avocado and it is refreshingly new to me.   It is a fun recipe and I am glad I tried it and truly enjoyed the experience.    I live in Florida and this just seems like a good fit.

This was great! Because I can’t eat tomatoes or jalapenos, I left those out, but added black beans and corn. I also added cumin and a little oregano. Absolutely delicious.

I cut back the jalapeno to a fourth, and it still had a kick. Really, even for a double recipe 1 jalapeno would be enough.

We really enjoyed this recipe! I've made it again just using Tostitos lime chips vs. baked tortillas  since we had chips on hand.

First off...Yum!  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  I made a few changes to mine due to  food preferences.  I will  make this again.  I started with 1 diced carrot in the pan with the onion  in 1T of butter and a splash of evoo because that is how I begin my soups.  I used about 2-3 diced Anaheim peppers instead of jalapenos, better flavor in my opinion, plus had them on hand.  A fellow reviewer mentioned corn,  so I added 1/4 c since it seemed a little thin on ingredients, to help with that I also added corn starch/water to thicken it up a bit.  I topped it off with a few pieces of avocado.  No corn tortillas here, so I just had a warmed up flour one with butter.   I added this one to my recipe box.

We loved this soup! It's very flavorful, light and so  refreshing topped with cilantro and avocado.  A great summer soup. Fairly easy to put together.  I used 1 1/2 shredded breast from a rotisserie chicken.  And added rice to help make it a bit more filling.  Delicious!!

So very hot here in Zambia right now, but I was so hungry for a soup to use our avocados in since we have an abundance.  This soup was better than any sopa de pollo in any Mexican restaurant I've been in!  Just the right amount of lime and cilantro.  I'm most happy now!

Similar to one we had at a Yucatán style restaurant in central Mexico. I use chips to top each bowl instead of baking tortillas. I consider the avocados optional. Really lime-y and intense. Delicious!

This soup is so delicious and different from other soups. I seed the jalepenos to control the heat for my little ones.

I expect to make it once again but with extra firm tofu instead of chicken.  Tofu will absorb the spicy broth and be will seasoned instead of bland.  Can't wait to see how it turns  out.

I had a mexican soup when visiting Toronto once that I couldn't stop thinking about.  It had a unique flavor.  This is the closest I have found to it.  I love this recipe.  I love the flavor of the broth with the lime in it.  One of my fav recipes!  So easy.  Nice clean, flavorful taste.

I try to make recipes exactly as written but due to lack of several ingredients  I made changes, and it turned out delicious!  Substituted a small can of diced tomatoes for whole tomato; used a can of green chilies instead of jalapenos; 1/8 c bottled Key lime juice plus 1 drop lime essential oil in place of limes; 1 drop cilantro essential oil for the cilantro leaves.   I sauted the onions and garlic first, then added the frozen chicken breast, broth, tomatoes, and jar of green chilies, salt and pepper, and lime juice.  Also added 1 tsp of  sugar.  To quicken the cook time I used my pressure cooker.  To add more color, I also added 2 c shredded purple cabbage, sauted, then added after pressure cooking so they wouldn't get mushy. I added the essential oils when the soup  cooled a bit along with the avocado. Remember, a drop of essential oil is all you need!

The only way my husband will eat chicken is in a soup. This was full of flavor and tasted very fresh. I only used one poblano and one Serrano pepper rather than all the jalapeños, because our market simply didn’t have any, but it was perfect. I do believe I will make this again. It was quick with minimal ingredients. We also just used wonton strips to save time.

This soup is a refreshing change for chicken soup.  I added corn from one ear of corn, a handful of carrot matchsticks, substituted pureed hot peppers for jalapenos, and used harissa oil to sautee.  SUPER!  I have leftovers frozen for my week-day lunches.  Make certain to toast the tortillas enough.  I used olive oil Pam and toaster overn.

This recipe is wonderful and turned out delicious. I used less chicken (not a big meat eater) and more avocado and broth. This recipe is on my "tried and true" list!

I loved this recipe and so did my husband.  I did make a few changes;  I added only 4 garlic clove instead of 8 my cloves were big and I felt 8 was a bit much.  I saw that several people had said 4 jalapeño peppers made it too hot so  I reduced the quantity to 3 but when I tasted the soup it was still fiery hot.  I dug around in the soup and removed as much as I could.  I would recommend 2 jalapeño peppers.  I have to say though that the fieriness calmed down after it heated for a while.    I added an extra tomato and an extra avocado. I used corn tortilla chips instead of making the strips.   I served with with a salad and hearty bread.  I will definitely make this again.  I love soups like this, everything in one pot makes for easy clean-up!   I'm definitely going to share it with my 3 grown daughters!

This soup was phenomenal! I followed the recipe as written except I skipped the jalapeño. After trying a few spoonfuls while it was still cooking, I ended up adding a little extra lime juice (I used the juice of 3 limes total). I ladled over some cooked rice to make it a bit heartier. Refreshing and light!

This was an amazing recipe. My 5, now 6 year old, requests this constantly, I just don't scoop the jalapenos into her bowl. Everyone loves this dish. Definitely bake the chips, they are awful and become soggy and mush if you don't.

Fantastic!  Like Mexico in a bowl. I recommend doubling the avocado and  I puréed half and left half chunky.  Also only used one jalapeño because I can't eat spicy food anymore.  Will make this again!

Super yummy! I'm not super adventurous but i needed some more lower calorie meals, this was perfect.  4 Jalapeños are too hot for me and my fam but 2 was just right.  I also don't use the tortilla bits, though sometimes we put some brown rice in it. LOVE IT!!!!

We liked the soup very much!  Jalapeño peppers are hit or miss. I missed, the ones I bought were not hot at all. We used some Tabasco instead. Garnished with more cut up avocado. Served with extra slices of lime. I will make this again.

This soup is really very good and so easy.  I didn't have an avocados so I added some corn and cooked rice.  This one is going in my recipe box!

Absolutely loved this!  We've made it several times.  Definitely reduced the number of jalapeno's to two (it was still plenty hot) and removed the seeds too. I have added hominy and white corn on occasion just for variety. Don't forget the sour cream; it helps cut the bite out of the hot peppers.

I made this last night and was surprised by how easy it was.  I didn't measure the amount of chicken or broth I used so it came out quite brothy compared to how much chicken was in it.  I also left out the jalapenos (I don't do spicy) and the diced tomatoes since I didn't have any.  I made sure to start with a little bit of lime and add it as I went to make sure it wasn't too tangy.  I also added some white rice as a filler since it was so brothy.  It was amazing! I even had some for lunch today and the flavors melded together even more.  Will definitely be making this again!

Not bad.  I made the soup to the recipe.  Only things I changed was using tamed jalapenos  (it's a type of jalapeno I found that isn't hot, but still has the jalapeno flavor) and I used tostados instead of the tortillas (i didn't want to turn the oven on when it's 90 degrees outside) both of which are small changes that wouldn't affect the overall taste.  It was really good.  I would add it was kinda limey, as others have mentioned.  If you don't like food with lots of lime flavor, you might want to cut back on the lime juice.  I like lime so I went with the amount the recipe called for.

Great flavor, only used two jalapeños with the seeds and was perfect.  Pretty limey so my kids didn't love it but I did!!  I will use more chicken next time and maybe throw in some corn or squash.

This is the first review I have ever done, but I have a new favorite soup!  I used double the chicken ( in thigh form) because it is what I had on hand.  I added two cobs of fresh corn kernels with the tomato.  I did NOT find the garlic and lime juice to be overpowering.  I added two avocados (because I LOVE avocado) but only two chilis because they were big.  I even tried a dollop of sour cream on top of one bowl (as per one reviewers suggestion) and found it decadent and delicious.  The only thing I would change:  I am quite happy to eat some corn chips on the side rather than adding tortilla strips....

This was very delectable! My daughter is sensitive to onions and garlic so I cut the onion pieces larger and used elephant garlic sliced (so she could pick it out) and I doubled the tomatoes, avocados and chicken. Everyone loved it. I would consider using poblano peppers instead of jalapeños to make it milder for those who don't like the zing of the jalapeños (which I personally LOVE).  We served this with rice and extra tortilla strips.

Really simple and good! We put the soup over rice and it did distill the flavor a bit too much for me. But, as is, YUM.

I love this soup. I cooked my chicken breasts on the grill. I also added 1 red bell pepper, 1 yellow pepper, 1 poblano pepper and the jalapeno to the grill. Instead of whole onion, I chopped up 2 bunches of green top scallions.

Oh man! HOT! I will prob try again but 4 jalapeños was just too much. We had to water down and that didn't help much. I added more chicken to make it heartier. Line flavor is good but I feel it needs to be cut with something to make it smoother tasting.

To be honest, I was a little nervous about the call for 4 jalapeños, I've made soups before that only called for one and nearly blew me through the roof.  But I went ahead and followed the recipe as called for - 4 jalapeños it is - and I couldn't be more happy. The heat from the jalapeños complimented the tanginess of the limes and creaminess of the avocados, instead of overwhelming them.  Easy and delish!

I used just less than a pound of chicken, 5 large garlic cloves, the juice of 3 not very juicy limes, and 1 jalapeno, seeded and with membrane removed.  Everything else was the same.  Thank goodness for the reviews of others!  It was perfect for me.    It took me 1 1/2 hrs to make it.  10 min. prep?  In what Universe??  Awfully good, though.

I just made this soup for dinner and it was excellent! My husband isn't a big soup lover and even he couldn't get enough. Will definitely be making this one again. I used water instead of broth since I'd marinated the chicken in spices beforehand. Also didn't have jalapeños so I used a couple spoonfuls of spicy chili pepper purée that I had and did 1/2 c lime juice instead of 1/4 c. Such a flavorful dish!!

I made this twice... the first time as written... the second time with a few adjustments to a wonderful basic recipe.
Everyone has tastes for different levels of flavors. The Avocado Soup recipe allows for this when ingredients are left as add-ins. My choices are lime wedges, cilantro, some onion, half the seeded jalapeno peppers, tortilla strips, and an avocado and a half.
The second time I did follow some suggestions... Added four more oz. of chicken, and half a can each of rinsed black beans and corn. Thinly sliced scallions crowned this soup, a meal within itself.

In my experience, lime is the biggest "game changer" of all the garnishments. While my Mexican partner will squeeze half a lime in his portion, I can only stand several drops. The adding of lime juice to brothy soups is definitely a personal taste thing, and should be added just a little at a time until you find what you like. This is a good soup.

I would personally rate this a 4.  It was good, but I felt it was lacking in flavor, however the family all loved it and had seconds.  Including my 8 year old, so I'm rating it 5 stars based on there requests to make a second batch that night.

Very easy to make!  Easy to adjust to your liking as well; make is spicy, make it mild. Really liked the fresh taste of avocado and lime. Great use for left over chicken; I made it using shredded left over rotisserie chicken. Shredding the chicken rather than chopping it helps to absorb more of the flavor into the chicken. YUM!

Did this in the slow cooker for about 3 hours came out good. I used the whole 4 chiles and 4 fresh limes, but only half an onion and two tomatoes plus doubled the chicken. The first time I made it as the recipe called for it wasn't enough lime or chicken and it was very runny and had way too much onion.

Very delicious. I did add 1/4 tsp of chipotle pepper and 1 packet of sazon. I only had one jalapeño hence the chipotle. The sazon really lifted it up. Tasted bland before I added it. Reminded me of a quick pezole with chicken. I will be making this again.

Love love love this foolproof recipe! Not being a natural at cooking, easy recipes are the best. Cut to the chase and shredded a store-bought roasted chicken and sauteed in garlic and leek, while adding garlic salt and pepper. Added can of corn and diced tomatoes seasoned with basil and oregano. Diced 5 avocados (BIG avocado-loving family) and added teaspoon of cumin. The cumin makes it foolproof, recipe as-written was too bland. The added corn made dish so colorful, my sister immediately posted to Facebook before eating. Thank you for sharing this!

Loved it. I did add a can of Rotel w/ lime/cilantro. Only had dried cilantro, garlic powder and dried onions...still delicious. I was just trying to find a recipe to use my chicken and avocado. I'm sure it would be even better with fresh ingredients.

First off, I used frozen fajita chicken strips, bottled lime juice, 3 jalapenos, and no avocados or tomatoes or salt & pepper.
The recipe calls for way too much onion and jalapeno. I had to take about 2 cups worth out of the soup to make it edible. 
Despite this, the soup itself has a great kick and with a couple tries could be perfected. 
I think I will try this recipe again in the future with less onion and jalapeno, and then I will add some salt and add decent avocados. 
Also, I'm not a fan of soggy tortillas.

We make this soup all the time and love it!!  The only substitutes we use (and we do this to make it easier) is use 3/4 a can of diced tomatoes with juice rather than dicing a whole tomato, and we buy the bag of lightly salted tortilla strips rather than making our own.  Also, we use 1-2 jalapenos rather than 4.  I love spicy food, but 4 is even too much for me, unless you just cook them in the soup and then take them out before eating it.

I tried this recipe with not too high of expectations since i did not think a soup with avocado could taste good. Boy was I surprised. not only was it delicious but sooooo easy. this will be made in my family for years to come. Had a wonderful kick thanks to the jalapenos!

Great flavor in this soup.  I highly recomend watching out for the jalapeno.  Add them according to the amount of heat you like.  I learned to add small amounts at a time when I make this.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Fantastic! The flavors in this were so light and refreshing, we really loved it. The only changes I made were to use 1 jalapeno and then made up for the rest with green pepper, as I'm a bit of a wimp. I also only squeezed the juice from 1/2 a lime and that was perfect, so I think the original amount could be a bit overwhelming. Thanks so much! :)

Fantastic soup!  We made this vegan just by using veg. broth and leaving out the chicken.  The only other thing i changed was i added a can of vegetarian chili beans and left out tomatoes and jalapenos.

I'd give it more stars if I could!  I love it as it is, but if I have time, I roast a chicken, and use the meat for the soup. Then I salt and roast the bones until they are really brown, then simmer them in a pot for several hours to make a broth (you can add celery, onion, carrot etc to the pot).  I usually substitute 2-3 anaheim chilis -- that way we get the flavor of jalapenos without the heat.  I also thicken the broth with a little cornstarch just before serviing.  Like I said, though, you don't NEED to do anything different for it to be delicious.

THIS IS OUR FAVORITE SOUP!  We have fixed it 4 weekends in a row.  Go easy on the lime.  We served it with tortilla chips and with soft tortillas.  I used a little rice in the pot the first time but it made yucky leftovers.  I double it for leftovers and I use only 2 jalapenos for the kids sake. SUPER DYNOMITE!

I had a soup in Toronto similar to this that I have been trying to recreate and this hit the mark.  It is the broth that is so good.  Tons of lime, cilantro, and jalapeno is the key.  It is very unique, healthy and oh so delicious.  I cut out the veins and seeds of the jalapeno so it was not that hot.  Yum!

I threw in a few large shrimp that were doing nothing in the freezer, and left out the tortilla strips because I thought there was enough going on with all the other flavors and textures. The only other thing I did differently was to add a splash of fish sauce. If I were to make it again, I would add some red pepper flakes too. Thanks, Michelle!

Really good.  I loved the avocado in it and thought it could use another one.  I also had to use canned tomatoes because I ran out of fresh ones.  I will definitely make this again.

I love this recipe.  I usually leave off the avocados because certain family members dislike them.  But it tastes great even without the avacados.  I like to top it with some quesadilla cheese too.

I really liked this soup and so did my family.  When I make it now, I make more broth and and a can of corn and a can of black beans if I am making it for a meal.  If it is for a starter, then I leave the recipe alone.

This was delicious and even better the next day. I halved the jalapeno for this recipe since so many thought it was extra spicy.  I used crushed tortillia chips and a little shredded cheese in the bottom of each coup bowl. I ate this every day for a week for lunch and ended up losing 3 pounds!

I love this soup and I make it all the time.  I have made a vegetarian version that I thought was just as good by subbing veggie broth and beans for the chicken (if using canned beans, rinse well before adding or if using dry beans, cook fully before adding).  I used a combo of black and kidney beans, because that is what I had, but it would probably be good with other types as well.  I have also subbed canned tomatoes for fresh with delicious results.  I just dumped the whole can (juice and all) into the pot.  Finally, as many others note, this is VERY spicy.  Tread lightly with the jalapenos and top with a dollop of sour cream to cut some of the heat.

This was a tasty soup.  I did make a few changes to it.  I added carrots and corn and that added some nice color and my husband said that fit in wonderfully.  I think next time i will use a little bit less lime.  I tried cooking the tortillas as sugested and I found I did not care for it.  It heated up the alread hot house and I forgot about one batch and burned them.  When I cook tortillas I microwave them for about 30 seconds.  It helps them crisp up a lot faster.  Then I put them on the stove med-hi heat and cook them both sides until they are done. It is easier if they are cut into triangles.  Even though this wasn't what I was expecting from avocado soup, I will make it agian!

This soup was pretty good, though be sure to serve it with something hearty, as it's not very filling.  From the title, we thought it would be an avocado based soup, but it isn't.  It was served because our 2 dinner guests gave us a list of 8 or 9 food restrictions, and this was the recipe that was left.  It was actually pretty good.

Wow, this soup was super yummy. My husband and I both loved it - we might cut back just a touch on the lime next time, but not much. It really does give a good flavor! And it's a nice, quick recipe, so that's really helpful on a busy night :)

I made this without the cilantro and the jalapeno peppers.  I gave it 3 stars because my boyfriend loved it; I ended up eating just tortilla chips though.  I guess it's just a taste preference - I thought the ingredients tasted weird together but he really liked it.

Very easy. Very tasty. I pan fried the tortilla strips in a small fry pan. Turned out just great.
