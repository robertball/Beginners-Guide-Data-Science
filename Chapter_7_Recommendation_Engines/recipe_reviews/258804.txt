Came out perfect.  Never knew this cut of meat could be this tender and taste as well as an expensive cut of beef.  Such a simple recipe to make.

I have not had any success cooking steaks because they are always tough. I found this recipe and went to our local butcher and  told him what I needed. 
. I cooked this steak AND the sauce as shown in the video and recipe. This was such a complete success and the meat was unbelievably tender and tasteful. I’m giddy with excitement as I will never use another cut of steak again except the butcher steak. IT was truly like eating an expensive cut but for 1.5 pounds, it cost me $12 and the pieces were so big, we are having the two leftover steaks, tomorrow. This chef knows his food and I’m so excited to have found him online!
