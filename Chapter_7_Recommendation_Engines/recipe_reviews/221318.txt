For an horchata shortcut, this is pretty good. I do like it with more cinnamon but overall this is a great alternative to the traditional horchata.

This recipe is a great alternative to making horchata if you don't have a blender. Next time I would use just a little bit more cinnamon, but aside from that it is most excellent.

This was good. I thought when first made it was too thin and watery tasting. Much better the next day. Just be careful you do not dilute it too much if you serve it with ice cubes.

I would definitely make again but I added a dash of vanilla and a bit more cinnamon. Kids loved it, nothing beats the real thing but this is a close second.

We LOVE this recipe for horchata! My kids ask for it often and now I've made it with kids at a couple different camps. It's easy for them to make, they love it, and it helps introduce them to a cultural food they often haven't tried before. The only modification I have made is to add a little more cinnamon (1 scant tsp instead of 1/4).

this was really helpful because I needed something to bring to our school's spanish food fair.  it took me under thirty minutes to make, when usually anything i cook takes over an hour! it was nice that i didn't have to stay up super late working on a project for once, especially because i had work every night this week. i did add more cinnamon and sugar afterwards to take the bitter taste away. rice milk is un poco (a little) bitter, it's similar to soy milk, but a little more bitter. overall this was a really simple recipe that i'd 10/10 recommend if you are in a rush for a project

I've never had Horchata before so I can't say I have anything to compare it to, but I made this and my husband and I *loved* it!   The only changes I made (to suit our tastes) was I used 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp Mexican vanilla.  I can tell I will be making this often!

This was a super easy recipe and tasted great. The only issue is that you have to keep stirring, including each individual glass you pour, because it settles really quickly and the dregs are pretty gross, in my opinion.

Only change I made was using coconut sugar as what had. Is quick, easy and good. After first time next added 3/4 Tsp. cinnamon and 1 Tsp. Mexican vanilla, like better this way and will be making more when don't want to go to all the waiting making Linda's from this site. Thanks for sharing both these recipes.

I added about an 1/8 teaspoon more cinnamon and a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. Iâ€™m definitely making this all the time!

I will definitely be making this for our Cinco de Mayo feast day this year!  I used the Vanilla Rice Dream for the recipe and I think I can actually cut the sugar in the original recipe when using the VRD to cut down on the sweetness

Good alternative. I used more cinnamon and added vanilla as well, and also blended the simple syrup with soaked cashews that I had leftover from another recipe. Turned out pretty good.
