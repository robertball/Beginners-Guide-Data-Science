I adore these cookies. They are just like the ones my Grandma used to make (except without the honey). I still make them on occasion & everybody loves them. When ever I make these I use the mini-tart shaper from pampered chef & I can make them really quickly. First I divide the dough in half, then quarters, then eighths, I keep on this way until I have a little ball of dough in every space of 4 mini muffin tins. Then I use the mini tart shaper to form the cups. I submerse the tart shaper in flour between each cup. I can whip these out like nobodies' business.

These were ok.  I love the filling, just like pecan pie.  However, I wasn't really fond of the crust/dough.  It was a little bland and had too much of flour taste to it.  And it was little too hard to make a shell in mini-muffin cups.  But the filling is 5 stars all the way.  Thanks for the recipe.

These cookies are great!  I have made them a few times, they are the first to be gone.  I did learn to refridgerate the dough before you roll them into balls, it makes it much easier.

These are really tasty! Here's my notes: don't try to make these in those throw-away cupcake pans. the ones I cooked in the throw-away pans didn't set right and they were gooey. Spray non-stick spray before flattening the dough in the cup. Also, make sure the cookies are completely cool, then slide a fork around the edges and they'll pop right out. Delicious!

I don't bake ever, but a friend made these and I asked where she got the recipe.  I made them myself and they turned out great.  I put them in a plactic container and they lasted for ages.

WOW! So chewy and sweet.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the hunny drizzle, I used maple syrup instead.  A tip: dont fill the cups too much or else it overflows and the syrup/hunny soaks into the outside of the cup and sticks to the tin, making it hard to remove as the sugar has glued it to the tin.  I am definantly going to make this again. So good dousnt say enough.

These are wonderful and so easy to make. I patted dough into 6 inch square then cut it into 1 inch squares. Then I rolled them into balls. Don't skip the refrigerator step. I substituted walnuts for the pecans as I didn't have pecans. Be sure to spray mini muffin pans with cooking spray and don't over-fill to prevent running over. I plan on making a lot of these for the holiday. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe to include as part of a monthly care package I send to troops stationed overseas. With Thanksgiving coming up, I figured they could use a little home tradition. These turned out very well and I really like the shortbread quality of the dough. One small warning - read the ingredient list carefully! After putting in wayyyyy too much cream cheese (seriously, never seen a 3oz package of cream cheese...) I had to adjust all the other measurements to match and wound up with 90 little nut cups!

Really great cookies.  I had a lot of the nut filling and could have made another dozen cookies- do not overfill the cups or you will have difficulty taking the cookies out of the pan. I saw some people omitted the honey - that honey is what makes it takes like a pecan pie.  Yum!

I thought these were good. I wonder if anyone has made more than 36 balls of dough? My crusts were fairly thick and I needed to bake them for longer than 20 minutes. Had way to much filling, and will halve it next time. Buttered the entire pan, top and insides, so I had no sticking problem. Keeping dough cold helps. All in all, a nice addition to my cookie tray.

I made these yesterday, and they are delicious!! But instead of pecans I used walnuts and they were deliciousl. I made 3 batches and all 3 turned out wonderful!! So delicious, I'm going to make some for thanksgiving. Really good!! They are easy to make but the most important thing is that you need to refrigerate the dough * you can't go without that step!! And make sure to use mini cupcake or muffin tins. Thank you so much!! Really good! Have no doubts in making these!!

These tasted just like the ones my Grandma used to make and I brought some into work for some of my co-workers to try and they loved them! If you are not much into baking, these are definitely a few steps up on the difficulty scale! I don't bake a lot so these were not easy but they aren't that bad and they were well worth the effort! :) I managed to get 36 balls out of the dough but it took a little bit of fanagling. You don't need to make them very big at all and you can get 36 out of this recipe. However, I had way more filling than I needed. I sprayed my muffin tins with some cooking spray but I put too much filling in them. The filling puffs up a bit during baking & it will spill out making them really hard to get out of the tins if you're not careful. :) Again - totally worth the effort. They taste little pecan pies - YUMMY!!!!

What a nightmare.  Admittedly, I'm just not good at making nut cups - and believe me, I've tried several times so the poor rating could just be the 'chef'!  :)  Nobody ever told me how hard these are to bake - no wonder they're always a rare hit on a cookie tray.  In any case, I made exactly as written and felt I didn't have enough dough.  My cups were weak at the bottom and the mixture oozed out making them messy and unappealing - though I and my husband both admit they were tasty.  Perhaps  making 1 and a half times the dough could have rectified the problem. However, the presentation, effort and amount of waste have deterred me from ever attempting to make these again.  For what it's worth, I actually consider myself a pretty decent baker!  Sorry for the sad review.

These were a little time consuming, but got rave reviews at the cookie exchange at work.  Be careful not to fill the cups too full or they will spill out over the top when the "cup" starts to cook.  I used pecans, so they were like tiny pecan pies.

My husband loves them, but I had tons of filling left. In order not to be wasteful, I ended up making pecan rolls with the rest of the filling.

It was a bit sweet but otherwise it was great. I might have taken them out a little soon because some were a bit runny. I think I might reduce to just 1 cup of brown sugar. The crust was great

I like this recipe.  I made 12 in mini tins, and 12 in cupcake tins.  I actually like the ones in the cupcake tins better than the mini ones.  Although both sizes are tasty.  I regret not thinking to add salt.  So I lightly sprinkled the tops after they came out of the oven.  Yummy!

This has become a Christmas cookie must have. I would advise DO NOT overfill the cups or the filling will spill over & make it very difficult to remove them from the pan. Also, I lightly greased the pan so they wouldn't stick. It helped immensely.

Delicious! We did use walnuts, and we did accidentally used less flour in the dough and they turned out awesome! We used 1 1/3 cup flour.  We also sprayed the pans as well. Thanks for the great recipe! But we will continue to use less flour.

Perfect recipe for the kids to make!!!  My twin (9year olds) boys found this recipe and decided to dig in.  They found it quite easy and simple to create.  And now I will make a few batches for my coworkers....Yummy!!!
