The flavor of this chicken is great - slightly sweet but with savory herbs, and definitely not too heavy.  The only change I made was to mix the marinade in the ziplock bag so that I didn't need to clean an additional bowl.  I'll be making this again!

I loved this!!! I did make a couple of changes. After reading through  the reviews, I added 2 cloves minced garlic and sliced onions to the marinade bag. I also used agave syrup instead of the honey so my parents could eat it. They are both diabetics. We are all crazy for balsamic so paired it with some sauteed kale, onions, garlic splashed with balsamic  and roasted cauliflower with thyme and rosemary.All very delish and low glycemic. Will definitely make again.   Also I used leg quarters cut up into thighs and legs. I catch them on sale for less than 4$/10 lbs once a month, so budget friendly.

I made this as written, but doubled the sauce and used 15 boneless skinless thighs. After baking I removed chicken from the sauce, strained the sauce and added corn starch & water to make a gravy. Was awesome with Basmatti rice. Even my very picky teen liked it, hubby loved it, he even licked his plate, lol. Thanks for this easy keeper!

This was excellent! I salted and peppered the chicken after it sat in the marinade, not before, and I also cooked it on a skillet instead of the oven. I used 5 chicken breasts instead of thighs, and was very pleased with the end result. This was very easy to throw together last minute, and I plan on making it again!

My wife really loved this! That's enough for me to give it a 5 star rating. I have to admit that I didn't expect great things by just looking at this recipe. But it was very good. I did saute some vegetables separately, and then added the sauce to them when the chicken was done. Thickened it with cornstarch and served it over brown basmati rice as an accompaniment. I think the sauce benefited from the onion and garlic in the vegies. It's a keeper recipe.

Delicious! My hubby and I loved this chicken. Only thing I changed was to use chicken breast... just poked holes in the chicken and marinated for 30 minutes. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written. Will definitely make this again!

I wanted a different, quick and simple idea for chicken and this is it! I followed the recipe to a T. I had all of the ingredients in my cupboard, but had to use boneless chicken breast because it's what I had on hand. I can't wait to make it again with chicken thighs . I know that will be even juicier and tasty!  I marinated my chicken for about 5 hours, cut the boneless breast in half and adjusted the cooking time and temperature to 25 minutes at 375. I did flip the chicken once during the cook time.  What great flavor. Even the boneless chicken was moist. I can't wait to make it again.

I will make this dish again.  I used the basic recipe on some wings and let it marinate overnight.  It was the best chicken wings I've ever had!

I liked the recipe, and so did my family, but I think the vinegar overpowered some of the other flavors. I would use a little less next time and drizzle more honey on the top. The marinade did keep the chicken juicy and I used legs instead, since they were on sale.

All in the family enjoyed this - needed a little longer than 40 mins to be well done.  Thanks for the suggestions to put onions and mushrooms with rice for  serving with the sauce.

Very tasty! I halved the recipe but otherwise followed it with no changes. Meat was so tender with great flavor. Not sure I'd make this with chicken breasts but thighs were perfect. This recipe saved me a trip to the grocery store since I had everything on hand!

This was good not great, a bit too sweet and not enough herb flavor for me. Next time will reduce the honey and increase the herbs. Overall, a dish I would make again!

I didn't change anything.  We're not picky eaters.   It just has to be quick and easy.  This fits the bill.  I marinated it over night and cooked it the next day for dinner.  I'll do this one again.

Cooked per the recipe and I have no idea how they made it look like that first picture. That pic makes it look thickly covered with sauce. Well I found the chicken to be rubbery and just a unpleasant color!  Definitely look at the other photos because they are more accurate.

This was very tasty.  I added garlic and crushed red pepper to the marinade and let the bone-in, skinless thighs soak overnight.  I took the thighs out of the bag and placed in a baking dish.  I added cut red potatoes and a head of broccoli cut into florets into the pan around the chicken.  I poured the remaining marinade over everything and baked for 50 minutes.  An outstanding one-pot meal!!

This was very tasty!  I used bone-in thighs and removed the skin and visible fat before marinating the chicken.  I poured the marinade over the chicken in a 13x9 pan and flipped the chicken every 15 min for about 50 min. at 375 degrees.  I drained the marinade from the baking pan into a small sauce pan, added a little cornstarch and a little drizzle of balsamic vinegar and made a nice pan sauce.  Served it with oven roasted fingerling potatoes and french green beans.

This recipe is easily doubled; I made 16 thighs by increasing the ingredients proportionately.  The sweetness is subtle from the honey and helps to curb the sharpness of the balsamic.  My family loved this and we had just a few leftover pieces - which were gone by the next afternoon!! I did change the baking time and temperature to 1-hour at 350F since I was doubling the batch; it turned out mouth-watering!!

For the marinade I only used a tablespoon of oil.
When placing chicken in the casserole only add about a 1/4 of the marinade. 1/2 way through cooking pour out the grease , turn the chicken then add the rest of the marinade. Makes it less greasy.

This was excellent!  I quadrupled the recipe, since I was cooking for 16 people.  Doubling the sauce recipe would have been enough.  I had lots of the gravy left over.  Everyone, even the kids, loved it.  I did add some minced garlic to the marinade, but that was the only change I made.  I will definitely be making this again.

This is such an easy recipe and it turns out so tasty, that it seems like you cooked and slaved over it for a long time. My family loved it. The chicken was so tender and the skin so crunchy and delicious, that I usually don't eat the skin but I did this time. I served it with rice and sautéed Brussels sprouts. This recipe is a keeper!

Delicious! I only wish the marinade was a bit thicker, so next time I will heat on stove for a while and maybe use a bit of corn starch to thicken it. Really yummy!

I let this marinate for 3 hours and cooked it with chicken breasts for 3 hours...no flavor. So I added more honey, balsamic vinegar and salt and pepper and cooked it 2 hours more. Flavor was still quite minimal. It looked pretty but had no flavor.

Great flavor! I made adjustments by combining another balsamic recipe. I added 1/4 cup chicken stock and used Italian seasoning blend instead of the thyme and rosemary.

This turned out delightfully simple, yet very flavorful. As others suggested, I just mixed everything in a ziplock bag, and also just used a single chicken breast. When it was done, I drained the liquid into a sauce pan and added some cold water / corn starch mixture and thickened it nicely. It was superb! Will definitely try again with thighs or wings as well.

Added 1 cloave of smashed garlic to marinade, and chopped red and green peppers when putting in oven. Boneless instead of bone-in.

Cooked in crock pot for 1hr 30 minutes at 375

I added a couple cloves of garlic to this recipe and marinated chicken breasts for about six hours, then I grilled them outside. And I didn't love it. The chicken was moist, but the flavor was really weak. Maybe if I marinated them overnight, but I'm not sure. I feel like this would maybe make a good sauce of some kind, but not really good for a marinade-and-grill situation.

The marinade is mild enough that it's tasty but enhances the natural flavors of the chicken perfectly. Super easy to whip together, the meat came out so tender!

Made this recipe exactly as published, with the exception of using chicken breasts in place of thighs.
I too, mixed marinade in plastic bag  before adding chicken.

Marinaded several hours.  Chicken was tasty, and moist.
My family and I loved it.  On my permanent list now!

This was quite good. My only complaint was that the fat from the skin diluted the sauce.  Next time, I’ll go with skinless thighs.

I followed the recipe and marinated chicken for 8 hours. The chicken did come out very juicy and cooked completely at given temp and time. The flavor is completely lacking. I’d say use 1 Tbsp of oil and double the herbs. For the last few minutes drain off the juice and broil on low to get a crispy skin.

I added the ingredients (+1/2 tsp Red Pepper Flakes) directly  into the ziplock bag followed by the chicken. I used 3 skinless, boneless chicken breast, roasted at 350 in the convection oven and basted it a couple of times during roasting. Very moist & flavorful. Thumbs up from hubby & son. Next time I'll try less honey & more Pepper Flakes. I served with smashed potatoes but next time I'll take from earlier reviews and thicken the sauce & serve with rice. There will be a next time!!

It turned out great.  I have a bit of a sweet tooth though, and was hoping it would be a little sweeter.  The only thing I did different was use chicken breast instead of thighs.

My husband loved this chicken.  I liked it but found it a little bland.  I would add fresh garlic to the marinade and smoked paprika.  Chili powder would be good too.  The chicken was super tender.

I made this dish last night with some minor changes. It was super easy and really good! I added 2 cloves of garlic to the marinade. I used chicken cutlets and marinated them for 4-5 hours then baked them at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. The flavor was really good, the chicken was tender and the leftovers were even better today.

I haven't been able to find a recipe for roast dark meat that I like. However, I followed this one exactly and I loved it! I threw some chopped onion and smashed garlic in the marinade also, and poured the leftover sauce over some rice. Delicious!! I made a double batch and will enjoy this all week! Thank you!

Made the marinade as written except I used fresh herbs. Was more tangy than sweet which some would prefer. I prefer a little sweeter. I added some fresh green onion, 3 tablespoons of brown sugar, 2 cloves garlic minced, 3 tablespoons worheshire and about a quarter more cup of honey.  I made this to my taste preferences. I still gave this recipe 4 stars because the marinade was a great base starting point for me to make my additions and it was good, just not what I wanted.  I marinated for 3 hours and then also grilled my thighs instead of cooking them in the oven.

Well my chicken sure didn't look like the picture, but tasted great. Definitely a keeper. Next time I'll probably remove the chicken when cooked, add cornstarch to the marinade and add back the chicken.

Marinated for more than 8 hours. Added 3 cloves minced garlic to the marinade. Directly mixed the marinade in the freezer bag so I don't have to wash an extra bowl. Cooked for 45 mins and turned the chicken every 15 minutes. Chicken was really juicy... even though I marinated it for hours, the meat wasn't as flavored as expected. The chicken thighs were swimming in sauce afterwards. I wouldn't add oil next time or maybe just add 1 tbsp olive oil as there are lots of oil coming out from the chicken while baking. So after baking, placed the sauce in a pan, added 1 tbsp cornstarch dissolved in water, simmered til sauce thickened while at the same time removing the excess oil. Poured it all over the chicken thighs. Sauce is really tasty! I am excited to eat this for lunch with rice. :)

Delicious!  I, too, made the marinade in the bag instead of dirtying a bowl (I don't have a dishwasher, except myself).  Tender and tasty, this definitely goes in the "remake" list.

Crazy easy and delicious results! I didn't change a thing but the cooking time - my leg quarters took an hour. Results in a yummy sticky sweet chicken.

Made this recipe as stated. Chicken did not get crispy even after taking it out of oven and pouring off grease and liquid from chicken and turning oven to 400* and cooking it for another 10 minutes. It was tender but the taste while being neither good nor bad was odd. Thickened sauce with cornstarch and it was pretty flavorless, then put sauce back in pan that I cooked the chicken in for the last ten minutes, which did give it more flavor but still an odd taste. Will NEVER make this again. There are too many good chicken recipes out there and having the chicken swimming in all that grease is not very appetizing or healthy!

I used Mexican lime olive oil and prickly pear reduction balsamic vinegar. Both from Queens Creek Olive Ranch in Scottsdale . Will be even better when grilled instead of baked!

I absolutely do not know how anyone got their chicken to look like the picture in this recipe.     I  am not new to the concept of cooking, and I followed the recipe completely.  I ended up with a mess of grey, rubbery chicken thighs, sitting in a dish of watery liquid, this with guests on the way.   I was able to save the day with a prepared teriyaki sauce.

I really wanted to like this dish, but after marinating for 5 hours, the chicken had hardly any of the flavor of the marinade, though it was certainly tender and juicy. I didn't thicken the marinade before I poured it over the chicken to bake; perhaps that would have made a difference, but I probably won't make this dish again.

My husband and I both loved this recipe. I made it exactly as written and was only able to marinate for 2-hours, which seemed to be enough. I agree that it wasn't as pretty as the 1st picture, but it certainly did not appear unappetizing. I served it with asparagus and couscous and had enough marinade to drizzle over both sides. However, next time I will probably double the marinade. The next day we had the leftovers and it was even better.

It was good, slightly sweet. (I left mine a lot longer though, 24 hrs) I think next time I would lessen the amount of chicken stock, and maybe at the end condense the juice to make a glaze.

I love this recipe, though with a couple changes.  As written it's good, but we like more sauce and serve this with rice.  I add garlic, onions, and some chicken broth and a little more of everything else, I cook it on the stove top for about 30 min.,or until chicken is done, with the top off so it reduces.  I add or subtract the honey(sometimes use sugar)  depending on how sweet we want it.  I also use only enough oil to saute the onions and brown the skinless chicken. This is also excellent with pork, Thank you for such a flexible recipe.

A bit sweet but very good with roasted veggies and rice. Next time I will increase the vinegar  and oil to 1/2 cup but not the honey. Also added more of the dried herbs. With pan juices I thickened it with cornstarch and made a sauce. Good dish.

Very good! I mixed all of the ingredients into a ziplock bag and froze everything for a quick dinner on a busy night. I also used boneless skinless chicken thighs. The chicken was very moist and flavorful.

I've always loved cooking with Balsamic. This was yum and will be making it again. I served mine on a bed of Hokkien noodles which I put julienne carrot and zucchini and thinly sliced silverbeet.
For the last few minutes I put a some cornflour in the sauce to thicken it a little, this covered the my noodles nicely

Really good!  The marinade makes a ton of sauce, so definitely enough to serve over rice/pasta/potatoes, or cut in half.  Also, cut the oil in the sauce by at least half, as the oil separates out during baking, so you end up with a top layer of olive oil, and a bottom layer of other ingredients, and it's hard to mix back together.  Might be able to get away with 1/4 as much oil as called for in the recipe.  Quick, easy, yummy, make again for sure!

It was sooo tender and juicy.  I found that if you brine the chicken for a couple of hours before marinating the chicken,  it makes it even MORE juicy and delicious.

I liked it,  hubs didn't.  I halved the recipe, and added more spices/herbs like in the other recipe on this site (crispy baked chicken thighs).   I didn't even need to marinate overnight, 5 hours was plenty.  Next time I might try boneless and instead of using garlic powder I will add paste.

The flavor is fantastic!! I ended up marinading this overnight in the fridge and cutting the chicken into cubes before cooking.  I also threw in long pieces of green onions when the chicken was about halfway done cooking and served it with grilled zucchini, summer squash, and onions.  So amazing!  I'm going to cook up some more and try it over a salad next!

Made exactly except used fresh herbs from my garden and removed skin first- very moist and tender! My daughter and I loved it- the mister hated it. He doesn't really doesn't really like flavor.

I made this with boneless thighs as that's what I had.  I cut about ten minutes off the cooking time, and they were perfect.  I'll make this again.

My family was underwhelmed by the flavor.  My husband did not like the smell, my three-year-old barely ate it, and it didn't have enough either sweet or savory flavors to suit my taste.

Pretty good.  I lowered temp to 350 and baked 1 1/2 hours.    Made gravy from juices.  Making again I'd cut back the honey.

I used balsamic glaze as a substitute and organic agave nectar for the healthier lighter benefit. Really good with the adjustments not over bearing at all and extremely tender. Marinated for 30 minutes/ poked the chicken previously.

Made this for Mother's Day (baked in the oven) and thought it was just okay as it was VERY greasy.  I froze the uncooked marinated leftovers and made them on the grill tonight- much, much better.  Will make again but only on the grill.

My husband and I LOVED this dish! He accidentally got boneless skinless thighs, and it still turned out amazing! I did add a little extra thyme and rosemary for more flavor.

This was so good, moist and flavorful. I only had enough time to marinate it for 2 hours, but it was still delicious. I will marinate for longer next time, to increase the flavor. I had to substitute brown sugar for some of the honey as I only had about half the amount of honey called for in the recipe. I will make it exactly per the recipe next time.

Great basic recipe and idea. This got raves! Changed by: added fresh organic leeks (greens and bulbs) and three cloves fresh garlic (large batch) to marinade. Increased amount of herbs three times. Used equal amounts raw agave nectar and honey. Used organic chicken breast (bone-in, with skin), legs and breast tenders. My guests loved it. We will make it again. Only marinated 90 minutes. Easy!

This is a really good recipe but next time I'll slightly reduce the oil and honey.  I opted to add garlic and cayenne and grind the thyme and rosemary before adding.  After tasting the marinade and making a few adjustments, I added the chicken with slashed skin.  Baked on a bed of onion slices for 45 min.  Removed chicken to tin pan and crisped skin under broiler while  reducing pan drippings by 1/2 on stove.  Served with garlic rice and Normandy vegetable blend.

Quick and easy. I marinated thighs in my baking pan, turning pieces once or twice during overnight marinating. Both my husband and I enjoyed our meal.

I didn't like this recipe very much. I thought the taste of Rosemary overpowered it a bit and I really like Rosemary. Also, you had better cook it longer than the recipe tells you to. And was quite raw in the middle.

I made it with boneless chicken thighs which were a bit dry. It's probably better with bone-in. I covered  the baking dish with foil to preserve the sauce and next time I  probably double the sauce. My family loves it. You can add capers or green olives to produce the classic Chicken Marbella.
I will definitely make it again.

I made this recipe as written and found it delicious.  When I made the marinade the smell was very familiar.  I tasted the marinade and looked at the recipe and realized the marinade is the pretty much the same as the vinagrette I make for salads.  I thought that was pretty cool.

I made half of this recipe using skinless boneless chicken breasts and adding a clove of garlic to the marinade.  After marinating for about seven hours, I put the chicken in individual baking dishes topping each with the marinade.  I baked this for about 25 minutes, basting it with the marinade halfway through the baking time, and again just before serving.  The marinade did tend to splatter a bit while it baked, so I was glad I put my baking dishes on a baking tray. This was good, but a tad too sweet for us, so next time I’ll cut back on the honey.  I'd also like to try grilling this.

This was so simple to make and tastes great. I  always carry all of the ingredients for the marinade, so I don't even have to plan for this meal. I didn't have plain honey so had to use ginger honey but it still worked great.

Outstanding. Used boneless chicken breasts that I split in half like fillets. Only used half the olive oil. Marinated for about 5 hours. Lined pan with foil and cooking spray for easy clean up. Spread out chicken in pan so weren't touching. This allowed a nice coating to develop on meat. Husband loved it.

I love this recipe, especially because it uses so few ingredients, which I always have in the pantry.  It was delicious and I will probably make this recipe on a regular basis. Add a side salad and it will make a refreshing summer dish!

No changes.  The only issue I had was my mistake. Didn't read the recipe all the way through before planning to make it. Didn't realize it needed to marinate for 8 hours. That's  ok though. Just made it the next day. Easy and delicious. Will make this again...soon!

I will definitely make this one again.  I wanted to make a  gravy. I added one small onion sliced to make a bed  for the chicken pieces. I poured  a 1/2 of cup of chicken broth  over the sliced onion and placed the chicken on top. cover the chicken for 35 minutes and uncovered 30 minutes.  I baked it at 400.  Served  Brown Sproted Rice. 
My husband and I thought it was real  Yummy!!  #APFIT4U

Talk about dee-li-cious! I did modify the recipe based on the availability of ingredients.  I used chicken drumsticks, deleted the olive oil & rosemary, added about 2-3 Tbsp of fresh minced garlic, added approximately 1/3 cup brown sugar and and 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes. I mixed all these ingredients with the others and put the cleaned drumsticks  (seasoned w/salt&pepper) in a gallon size zip lock bag and poured liquid mixture over chicken. I let it marinate in the fridge for 4 to 5 hours then prepared according to the recipe. Served this with Jasmine rice and a steamed veggie mix of cauliflower, broccoli and carrots with a little lemon zest and pepper.

This was really good!  Nice amount of sweet and so tender.  I marinated overnight  and added  just a touch of BBQ sauce while cooking .    The combination of spices was good also but I substituted oregano  for the thyme.      I would make this again.
I cooked the chicken  longer than 40 min bcuz of bigger pieces.

Both my husband and I found it very bland.  Maybe it would be better using skinless, boneless thighs.  Will not make this recipe again.

Well it's delicious; I baked it for 15 minutes and instead of pouring the marinade over it while baking I poured just a little bit of honey after I baked it

I made it tonight for dinner and the only change I made was added 3 cloves of minced garlic to the marinade instead of the other herbs used.  It was outstanding and enjoyed by all.

I made this for my husband he loves chicken thighs, I on the other hand like chicken breast so we picked up a whole chicken had the butcher cut it up, when I made the recipe I cut the breasts in half. As the others suggested I added Onions and Garlic. We served this up with mashed potatoes and a salad. This recipe was LIP-SMACKING. Again as others suggested I reduced the leftover liquid to make a gravy. If there was only one thing I would reduce the amount of oil being used as there was a lot of fat after the chicken cooked down while being cooked in the oven.

The whole family loved it! My son didn't even use BBQ sauce, which is pretty amazing in itself. I made it just as written except I didn't have rosemary, unfortunately. I may try adding soy sauce to the marinade instead of salting the chicken next time, and someone suggested adding minced garlic, which is rarely a bad idea for chicken. This is going to become a regular!

It was a nice simple dish. I actually made it with salmon, and left in the oven for an hour at 300 F. Although, it may be better with tilapia because of the thyme and rosemary I am really curious how this will taste grilled. I am looking forward to adding this to my Thanksgiving menu. The seasonings make it more of a holiday dish.

This chicken is super simple and tasty. I did brown the chicken in a skillet before adding the marinade and finishing in the oven. I used drumsticks and I'm sure any cut of chicken or even pork would work. I made a half recipe and added some chicken broth (about a 1/4 cup) before baking to loosen up the sauce and to prevent the sugar from burning. Great recipe with ingredients usually on hand, which is a major plus. Thanks for posting!

This was delicious and everyone ate it, even my picky 8 year old. I used chicken breasts instead of bone-in and cooked for about 30-35 min.

Not something I want to make again. Texture was good, but the sweetness of the sauce and the choice of herbs was not something I enjoyed.

This was just delicious!   I love that I had all of the ingredients on hand. Only marinated for an hour and this was still flavor packed!  I always have fresh rosemary, so I used a teaspoon (ish) of that instead of dried.  I think I may take some of the others' advice and add a few more veggies into it next time (garlic, onions, mushrooms); but this recipe as is...TERRIFIC!!!!
