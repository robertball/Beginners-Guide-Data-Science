This recipe really confused me. It was like a really watered down or thin version of an orange julius. It didn't really have any substance. I am not sure what to do with it. I am thinking about saving it to add to smoothies, that need liquid, and where I want a little extra orange flavor so as not to waste the yogurt or orange juice. Only change I made was scaling back the recipe, quite a bit, and subbing plain yogurt to which I added a little agave and vanilla extract for the vanilla yogurt.

I cut this recipe down to 1 serving using the Change Servings button: 1.5 cups OJ, 3/4 cup vanilla yogurt (I used Greek), 3/4 large naval orange, 1/8 tsp. cinnamon. Because Blender Woman thought this smoothie was watered down, I decided to start with just 1/2 cup OJ. I'm so glad I stopped there because even with that amount, this smoothie was still rather "weak and thin" and not thick as I expect a smoothie to be.
