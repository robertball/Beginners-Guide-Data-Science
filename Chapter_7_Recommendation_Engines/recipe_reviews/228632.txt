This is a tasty and easy dinner for a busy weeknight, but the cooking time needs to be adjusted.  I was concerned that using more meat than the submitter suggested might result in under-cooking.  I wish!  My lovely 2 pounds of pork tenderloin was overcooked at 15 minutes.  And this is with 2 pounds of kraut, also more than suggested.  As  I said, this was tasty, but I'm going to stop the first cook at 8 minutes, next time.  I did not have fennel, and I added salt and pepper prior to searing.  I also used all juice, no water.

Just Loved it.  Have made it twice.  As I usually do, i changed the recipe a bit because I thought it might be too tart.  Diced up 2 granny smith apples with twice the kraut and and used all apple juice; cooked all for 20 minutes in pressure cooker.  The meat was very tender and could be shredded into the kraut.  Boiled separately creamer potatoes and added to mixture.  Guess I made it more of a stew. This was so good, and even better the next day!

I cooked this in a traditional oven top pressure cooker, and put twice the sauerkraut and switched the ratios of water and apple juice (which I replaced with cider) the only change I would make would be to put no water and a cup of cider. Still a good dish.

The pork chops turned out very tender.  I added crumbled bacon to the sauerkraut.  I thought that the strong flavours would turn some of the family away from it, but everyone enjoyed it.
