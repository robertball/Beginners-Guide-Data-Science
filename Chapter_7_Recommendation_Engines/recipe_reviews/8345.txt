Great tasting cake and wonderful icing (a total figure destroyer, though...) After seeing the comments about the caramels sticking to the pan bottom, I took one of the suggestions to use caramel ice cream topping. When I turned out the cake onto the wire rack, however, it fell apart, while some of it stuck to the pan. The cake was way too  moist. Any suggestions as to the reason why this happened? (the pan was well coated with a flour/oil baking spray).

I used carmel topping as everyone seemed to suggest. I also used D Hines cake mix. If I recall correctly, there's already pudding in the mix. Well, my cake didn't fall apart. It held very well. Nice form. Except for the missing top!!!! I don't think I'd use the topping again. It all sank to the bottom of the pan (top of the cake). Maybe you have to use the tiniest amount of topping. But, then what's the point? I'm wondering if maybe cutting the carmels into tiny pieces and laying them on top of the batter before you put it in the oven. Or not add any carmel to the cake mix and just use carmel frosting instead of chocolate frosting, because you're adding chocolate pudding to the frosting anyways. I LOVE the frosting, and I am not a frosting person. But I'm going to try carmel frosting instead next time.

I recommend putting 2/3 of the batter in the bundt pan before adding caramel.  The weight of the caramel caused the caramel to sink to what became the top of the cake and it stuck to the pan.

I agree with everyone else.  The carmel was too heavy and once it cooled it was very hard!  Next time I will use ice cream topping.  Also be careful to buy a cake mix that has the same amounts of egg, water and oil as the recipe.  That could be another reason for it not wanting to hold together

ditto on the sticking to the pan and falling apart....next time I will use ice cream topping caramel instead the the candies...and try to avoid letting the caramel touch the edges of the pan when drizzling it...the taste is yummy, so definitely worth trying again to see if I can get it right...

I found this cake a little disappointing.  The caramel fell to the top of the cake, so it wasn't in the middle like it was to be.  This make the cake top heavy and fell apart.

I agree with the above review. Also the caramel hardened too much. I think next time I will use caramel ice cream topping. BUT the frosting is absolutely THE BEST!!!! All the girls at work wanted that recipe.

This cake was really moist and delicious.  I too had some of the caramel end up sticking to the bottom even though I put in 3/4 of the batter prior to the caramel.  However, some did not sink all the way down, so I think if I made it again I would just use less caramel. I think caramel topping would make it too wet unless you took out some of the water from the cake.  The part that did not stick to the pan did not get hard and just added flavor to the cake. While the frosting was interesting and yummy it was odd to work with and I think I might skip it next time. I might also try it with some chocolate chips.
