When cooking for a party, time is always of the essence! So I turned this into a two-step process and it came out EXCELLENT, earning rave reviews from my guests! Not only was the taste great, but the presentation (the bundles) was impressive too, making me really look like a gourmet cook to my guests! The night before the party,I used fresh green beans and blanched them, then I lightly fried the bacon before wrapping the bundles, covered the baking dish with foil and put it in the refrigerator.  The next day I made the sauce, poured it over the bundles sprinkled with garlic powder (instead of garlic salt), covered the dish with foil, then put it in the oven at 350 degrees for 1/2 hour.  Turned the oven off, let it sit. Then right before serving time, turned the oven back on, removed the foil covering and cooked until heated through (about 10-15 minutes).

Yum these are my favorite.  This is just like my recipe, glad I found yours before I posted mine. I used this as one of the appetizers I served at my wedding.  Everyone loves these!! They look fancy like something you would see in a restraunt. Sometimes instead of wrapping them in bundles I will put 5 cans of cut green beans into a glass baking dish, sprinkle with garlic salt, cut bacon into peices and place on top of the green beans covering all,then sprinkle brown sugar over the top and pour one stick of melted butter over the brown sugar and bake at 350 for 1 hour or until bacon is crisp. I do this when I am serving a large group and it's better for those who want the bacon more crisp.

Wonderful recipe - The only change I made to this is that I used fresh green beans that I had steamed.  The bundles are very yummy and make a wonderful presentation as well!  Everyone raved about these at my Thanksgiving Dinner this year!  This is a keeper!
You can also do most of the prep work in advanced for a big meal such as Thanksgiving I discovered.  For this recipe I steamed my green beans in advanced then wrapped them in bacon and placed on a cookie sheet that was lined with wax paper and froze the bundles.  Once frozen I took the bundles off and placed them in zip bags (only to free up space in my freezer and get rid of the cookie sheet). Then on Thanksgiving Day I pulled the bundles out and let them thaw on the baking pan I was planning to cook them on and continued with the recipe by adding the sweet sauce on top before baking.  I was thrilled they turned out so well - and I didn't have to rush and make them at the last minute either!

Like other users I used fresh green beans. I also prepared a day ahead of time so life was easier the day of the dinner party. I boiled fresh green beans for 5 minutes and fried the bacon 4 minutes. After assembling the bundles I covered the casserole dish and placed in the fridge. When it was time I covered them with the brown sugar mixture and baked them for 30 minutes covered and then another 15 minutes uncovered to crisp the bacon. Turned out great!

I've been making this recipe for years now.  It was one I got at a pot luck.  My recipe differs a little and you might prefer it.  I only use 3/4 of a cup of brown sugar (and I don't pack it very firmly), I use 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp black pepper, and 1-1 1/2 tsp worcestershire sauce.  I cover the whole thing and bake at 350* for 20 minutes, then take the foil off and bake for another 15 minutes.  No broiling necessary that way.  I give this recipe 5 stars because it is VERY good...but...it is NOT to be confused with a green bean side dish.  Meaning you can only eat 3-4 of them...and they really are best in a pot luck setting, that way everyone gets 2-3 and it leaves you wanting more.  If you were to eat it as your 'vegetable' for a meal then yes, I can understand the concern over the nutritional info.

Loved this recipe. I used fresh green beans, blanched them the day before, par cooked the back, rolled the beans in the bacon, made the sauce poured it over and covered overnight. The day of the dinner I cooked as directed. Made for a dinner for 10 and everybody loved them. They looked great and better still, they tasted great.

Personally, I don't like these.  They are really sweet and I can't seem to get over how much fat are in these (154 g total).  However, most people do like them.  That's why I gave it 4 stars.  I've made it in bundles, which is a very pretty way to make it.  If you want an easier way, just place the green beans in the bottom of a baking dish, cut the bacon into pieces and place over the top of the beans, drizzle with brown sugar and butter sauce, and sprinkle with garlic salt.  You get the same flavor with less work.

I've been making these every Thanksgiving for years! However, I only use fresh green beans and blanch them for a few minutes until bright green. As a more healthy alternative, I skip the butter & sugar and toss the blanched green beans with some olive oil and a touch of dijon mustard. It also helps to cook the bacon for 2 minutes in the microwave before wrapping around the green beans. This will help speed up the baking time to about 25 min and prevent the green bean from being over cooked. Delicious!

Wow! These were fantastic! I made it into a casserole like previous veiwers. Using 3 cans cut beans. Cut up 1/2 lb. bacon and fried till almost crisp and then added to beans. It still took a long time for bacon to look crispy,uncovered it and it cooked better. I think next time I will pre cook bacon longer. Was a big hit on our Thanksgiving table today! Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I've been making this for 3 years. Here are some hints: use the canned whole green beans, use only 5 beans per bundle and wrap with a 3rd strip of bacon. Cut up a stick of butter & scatter throughout the pan after the bundles are in. Sprinkle with the brown sugar and garlic (I use garlic powder). Cover & bake for 30. Uncover and bake an additional 15. Wonderful!

I made these for Thanksgiving and my in-laws loved them.  The funny thing is they ate them as appetizers! I did remove the cover after 15 minutes and baked the green beans for about 15 -20 more minutes and the bacon seemed to cook more.  I already have requests to make these for Christmas!!

This recipe was awesome, and a winner with my family this Thanksgiving.  I used fresh green beans. I parboiled them for 5-8 minutes in salted water.  I also added a few drops of soy sauce to the other ingredients.  After mixing the other ingredients I poured over the beans, and then marinated them overnight.  The next day I took my bacon and pre-cooked it for about 1 minute in the microwave, and then wrapped 1/2 slice of bacon around  the beans in bundles of 5-6 beans - closed with a toothpick, and lastly I baked them.  They were awesome.

These green bean bundles were tasty and I do not eat green beans so I think that says a lot. I used fresh green beans and I believe that made all the difference in regards to the quality of taste. I only used 3/4 cup brown sugar and it was still sweet and buttery. I will definitely make these again for the family especially since my husband went back to the dish for thirds. (: 
This dish would be a perfect addition for potlucks, BBQ's, holiday dinners, etc. You could also prepare the bundles the day before your event then add the sauce and bake the day of. This recipe is worth your time and I hope that everyone gives it a try at least once... especially for the individuals (like me) that don't (normally) eat green beans. Bon appetit!

2010-11-25  I used haricot verts instead of regular green beans.  The beans were blanched for about a minute and a half and the bacon was partially cooked beforehand.  I used some of the bacon grease to coat the baking pan.  The beans were bundled in groups of 10.  The amount of sauce seemed excessive and was very thick.  I ended up microwaving the sauce before spooning it over the bundles.  I cooked them for 30 minutes covered in foil then uncovered them for the last 10 minutes.  They were sweeter than I prefer and would cut back on the brown sugar if I made them again.

I made this dish because my older daughter thought it looked interesting. Both my girls thought this recipe was acceptable but said the sweetness was overpowering. My husband and I didn't care for it at all.

I am rating this 4 stars only because I feel the directions should have been a bit more detailed, such as I and most reviewers agree the beans should be fresh and boiled about 5 minutes, and the bacon pre cooked a bit. As for the taste, I found them to be good. Even with the pre cooked bacon, I wanted it a bit more done, so I turned the broiler on low for about 5 minutes, took them out, turned them over, sprinkled a bit more of the mixture on them and broiled on that side for about 5 minutes. I did this because I knew my hubby wouldn't even touch them if the bacon looked undercooked. They came out great and I look forward to serving these at my next party. I am all about presentation, and these get a 5 star for that. Oh yeah, to save on calories, I used the imitation spray butter.

My guests love these.  Since bacon is so salty, I used garlic powder.  I also didn't use as much butter as called for. I find that keeping the foil on prevents the bacon from getting crispy so I baked them at a lower temperature 300 degrees for about 45 minutes.

I was in a hurry to get this in the oven so I didn't bundle my fresh green beans, just topped with the bacon.  I precooked 6 slices of bacon thinking it was enough, but then realized that it was supposed to be the whole package and I did not have time to precook the rest.  The precooked bacon was much better and crisp.  The rest of the bacon was soggy and fatty even though I uncovered it and broiled it at the end of baking until it browned.  I also used fresh green beans and boiled them for 5 minutes due to other reviews and they were quite soggy!  Next time I will NOT precook the beans, but definitely will precook all the bacon.  I gave this recipe 3 stars because it was swimming in grease!  I don't know if I will use butter at all next time, the bacon creates enough grease.  I also think that by precooking the bacon you might eliminate some of the grease.  But the flavor itself was good, very sweet.  I will make this again with these changes and will play around with the grease factor to see what works best when I precook all of the bacon, butter or no butter, maybe a bit of water?

This dish is AWESOME!  Super quick and easy side dish that looks like you went to a ton of trouble when you really didn't.  I went ahead and stirred the garlic salt in with the brown sugar which saved a step.  I used fresh green beans and boiled them for about 10 minutes so they wouldn't be too crunchy as other reviewers who used fresh beans had experienced.  I also cooked the bacon for about 2 minutes per side before wrapping the beans then broiled then entire dish for 6 minutes at the very of cooking to ensure crispy bacon.  My family devoured it.  It looks pretty and tastes fantastic.  You will not be disappointed!

I, too, make this as a casserole.  Also, the 2nd time I made it, I halved the brown sugar ... much better.  EVERYONE who tries this raves about it. How nice to be able to make this up ahead of time.   Simple, yet elegant.  Thank you Mark.

These were really good. My Husband is not much of a green veggie person and he really like them too.  I microwaved the bacon a little bit before wrapping. I think for just regular family meals in the futre I will crumble the bacon into the beans. Looks like a million in the bundles though!

DELICIOUS!
However, my husband thought the bacon could be crispier, so I may try to half-cook the bacon before wrapping next time to see if the bacon gets crispier.  Also, I substituted fresh COOKED green beans because I think they held up better being stacked into a bundle and looked more presentable.

These were great. I didn't change a thing other than the type of green beans; my garden is going nuts so I used fresh raw green beans instead of canned. Everyone loved them, thanks for a great recipe!

Can't say enough about this recipe!  My only change to it is I don't bundle the beans.  I place the beans in a baking dish, mix in the cooked, chopped bacon, pour the butter-brown sugar mix over it all and bake for 45 minutes or until heated through.  These are excellent!

This is a fantastic recipe idea, although I did change it a bit for our family's taste. Instead of using garlic powder, I use two heaping tablespoons of minced garlic. I also cut the brown sugar down to about 2 heaping tablespoons, and added 1/2 tablespoon of Italian seasoning. I used frozen whole green beans instead of canned. These were undoubtedly the best green beans I have ever had. My family asks for them all the time, but I try to save them for special occasions!

I made this as a "trial run" before Christmas, and it was great!  I used the advice of other reviewers: Before "assembling," I boiled the beans 10 minutes (I'll do 5-7 next time)and I fried the bacon a few minutes.  After the suggested cook time, I also broiled the dish for 2 minutes to get the bacon crisp.  The taste and presentation of this recipe is fantastic.  You will not be disappointed.

Do not pass on this recipe! It's awesome.    However, it is imperative that after you bake it for 45 minutes, stick it under the broiler for 7-10 minutes to crisp the bacon.  Keep a close eye so it doesn't burn, just enough to make the bacon look done.

Why would you want to use can beans? Fresh green beans steammed worked MUCH better. Just do not cook them as long.

Delicious. A great hit!  Found it easier to just cut the bacon into small pieces rather than wrap them.  Can also be done with fresh green beans.

I used cans of french style green beans and made into a casserole, and it was so wonderful.  It gave me something new to do with greenbeans other than the usual.  The sweet flavor is almost a treat!

This is a family favorite and is quite versatile and forgiving. I prefer fresh green beans, cook time is the same. Sometimes I add loose brussle sprouts cut up in the free space of the pan. Sliced Cabbage works well with this recipe too. (only way my kids will eat cabbage) It works well as a base for a variety of veggies but I do cut back on the sugar and butter. I use about 1/2 to 3/4 cup brown sugar NOT packed, and about half the butter. I have on occasion omitted the butter and I don't taste a huge difference. (use water in place of butter otherwise the sugar crunches up) We also love to add crushed nuts sprinkled on top when we have them on hand. (Walnut, pecan, pistachio, and almond are our favs) I like to pull off the foil in the last 10 min to make the bacon crisp up, but I pour off the "fat and juice" into a container so it does not evaporate off. Reason being, it will keep in the fridge for about a week and a half and freezes well, and next time you go to make this recipe you do not need to add the butter or sugar again...just bacon wrap your veggies and pour the saved mixture over it and your done. When I reuse the juice like that, I save it 1 more time and dump it in my broth when I make ham and bean soup...yummm! Bonus, no waste. If your concerned about heart health, read and learn to make bacon from pork belly. It is far healthier than store bought which is why farmers who ate their own bacon and eggs often, did not die early of heart disease or cancer!

This was absolutely amazing!  A quick and elegant side dish!  Wrapping the green beans took no time at all.  I used fresh frozen beans.  My family raved about this recipe, but there was one problem......there weren't enough!  :-D     They ate them like candy!  Our family of 5 could easily double this recipe.  For dinner guests, two bundles is an attractive and bountiful side to any meal.  Thanks for this delectable recipe!

This is really good.  I put all ingredients except the bacon in a casserole dish.  I cook the bacon separately and then crumble over the top after the casserole is done baking.  Absolutely delicious!

This is a great recipe, it's very similar to the one I've been using for nearly 20 years. The only difference is, I add a little Worchestershire sauce to the brown sugar and butter mixture.

Very good!  I used fresh green beans, blanched them in boiling water for 5 mintues, and precooked my bacon for 2 minutes before grouping the beans  bacon.  I will probably pre-cook the bacon a bacon a bit more next time.  Just to cut down on some calories, I used less butter and added a bit of water to the brown sugar mix.  I also baked for 30 mins and then broiled them for 5 mintues to help crisp the bacon...but I would have liked it a bit crispier once cooked.  Overall, these were really good and they looked really nice once cooked.  I'll make them again.

DELISH!! I made these into a casserole as other reviews have suggested. I used whole frozen green beans defrosted, about 5 strips of bacon cut up and fried till crisp, 1/2 cup of brown sugar and half a stick of unsalted butter for the sauce. Did not have garlic salt so I used 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of kosher salt. This dish is a great alternative to green bean casserole as well as glazed carrots.

I've been making these for years - always receive rave reviews and they really make "something special" for those fancy dinners or buffets.  These are a staple for our Thanksgiving & Christmas meals too!

I do add a dash of soy sauce, and put more green beans in each bundle.

I have made green beans like this for several years except that I don't make bundles.  I use the brown sugar, butter mixture as a sauce.  I also use french-style beans.  I always get compliments when I make these beans.

ME and my family loved this recipe it just adds a little fancy to dinner instead of serving just plain old green beans...the only thing I did different is I cooked the bacon half way then cooled it then wrapped the green beans and baked them not as long.We like our bacon crispy :)

BIG suggestion:  The secret to these bundles is the TIME ALLOWED FOR MARINATING - the longer the better!  Also, the recipe I use calls for 1/2 teaspoon of soy sauce, it makes all the difference in the world.  Sort of balances the brown sugar.  My in-laws insist on these bundles at every holiday or gathering - even the green bean haters love these.  I start marinating them in ziploc bags AT LEAST one day in advance.  Wonderful!

I skipped the foil and steamed the beans for about 6 minutes first.  PERFECT side dish...!!   After about 30 minutes on 350, I finished on broil for about 8 minutes to crisp the bacon.

These are really good. Once I saw the sugar and butter I was sold. I will make these again. I used fresh string beans. I couldn't imagine canned. Turned out wonderful! The bacon and the green beans were sweet and savory.

I made these this Thanksgiving and they were a HUGE hit! I used fresh green beans that I blanched for about 3 minutes. I also cooked the bacon in the microwave for 2-3 minutes before making the bundles. I used a little more butter than suggested to get the right consistency and then baked them for 35 minutes at my house covered and once we arrived at y grandmother's I put them in the over for 15 more uncovered! Delicious!

I made these for Thanksgiving Dinner. They came out good. It was a nice presentation. I will probably use fresh beans (blanched) next time as the canned ones were just not real flavorful. My hubby actually preferred these cold because he could taste the beans better. I did broil uncovered for 3 minutes just to crisp up the bacon more. It was an overall great and easy recipe.

Love these (they're in the oven as I type)!  I add 1/4 cup worchestershire, 2 tsp soy sauce and 1 clove garlic.  Have used fresh and frozen green beans and both works out wonderfully. Have shared this recipe with several friends.

Yum! I only made a third of the recipe (1 can of green beans) because it was just me experimenting. I bake covered for 30 minutes, uncovered for 15 then a couple of minutes under the broiler to crispy up the bacon. Is it bad that I just want to drink the juice in the pan?

My family loved this so much that they now beg me to make this for all the holidays. The only change I made was to partially cook the bacon before hand. I just throw it in the oven for 15 minutes before assembling. So good and looks really impressive!!

These turned out pretty good, but I did make quite a few changes.  I used fresh green beans.  I took one of the reviewers advice and mixed it up the night before & let the beans marinate overnight.  Then I parboiled them for about 8min the day of the party.  I also microwaved the bacon for 1 min before wrapping.  The bacon never crisped and that was dissappointing. I baked in the oven & then transferred to a warming dish.  They were still pretty bland when I first put them in the warming dish and I was afraid they weren't going to be very good.  But after sitting in the warmer with the sauce over them, they were more flavorful.  Also, if you are using fresh beans, I recommend parboiling them more b/c mine were still not cooked enough after they came out of the oven.  They softened up after being in the warmer for a while.

This is an excellent recipe!  I cheated and used ready to serve bacon because I was in a hurry.  I also used more than seven green beans in my bundles in order to use less bacon (cuts the fat and grease down) and I used margarine instead of butter.  Even with all these changes this recipe turned out wonderful!  This was an easy recipe that taste great even when you make it a little healthier.  This is why I am giving it five stars.

Made these for Christmas. Would never use canned beans for this, so I used fresh.  Blanched them until dark green first.  I  found that the beans dehydrated way too much when I left the bundles in long enough for the bacon to crisp.  Everyone loved them anyway, but next time, I'll cook the beans a bit more first, then broil the bundles to crisp the bacon.  Great flavor - no leftovers!

Very easy to make and is absolutely delicious! I didn't have regular bacon, so I used the pre-cooked stuff you heat up in the microwave. I changed the baking time to approximately 12 minutes and it turned out great. The grean beans were still tender (which is how I like them) and the bacon was crisp. Very intersting flavor combination made for a wonderful side item to go along with grilled chicken and some brown rice. The whole family loved them.

Awesome! I used fresh green beans. I cut a pound of bacon in half and used only one half. I did not measure the butter and brown sugar; I just made a paste (probably used less than stated). Fresh garlic and garlic powder both work well. I filled a 9.5 by 13.5 glass-baking dish, covered it, and cooked for one hour. It made a great presentation. In the last few weeks I have made this recipe four or five times for different people (some VERY picky eaters), and they all loved it! I kept catching them in the kitchen after dinner eating another bundles. There has never been any leftovers.

Thank you Mark!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving with the following changes.....I used frozen french beans (the really thin ones) and wrapped it with pre-cooked bacon. I wrapped them the night before and they turned out DELICIOUS! I added just a touch of Worchestershire sauce to give the sweet garlic sauce a kick.... I got raves from all....thanks for posting such a great recipe.

This is DELICIOUS!  My gosh--to see that some people didn't absolutely love it confuses and astonishes me.  I think it's the best green bean recipe I've ever tasted.  For all of you who were commenting on the bacon--try it w/turkey bacon.  It is GREAT flavor, but doesn't get fatty or soggy.  Anyway, Mark--thank you!  It's a GREAT recipe.

The ultimate compliment: My GRANDMOTHER asked me for this recipe. I made this for a Christmas get-together and did it casserole-style (as described in a previous review) rather than wrapping all those little bundles of green beans. Everyone who thought they'd tried every green bean recipe was pleasantly surprised. I've been looking for a unique way to prepare green beans, and now I've found it. Thanks, Mark!

The flavor was great, but my daughter and I both thought that the bacon was under done and the beans were over done.  I think we'll try this again with fresh or frozen beans, and maybe we'll try partially cooking the bacon first.  We also used only half the brown sugar, and that was plenty for us.

I accidentally bought cut green beans instead of whole ones so I couldn't make the bundles. I pre-cooked the bacon, cut it in one inch pieces and mixed it together with the green beans before pouring the sauce over. I also substituted garlic powder for the garlic salt because the canned beans I bought had salt in them. I thought this was a terrific recipe. My husband and children didn't like that it was sweet but it is definitely not overly sweet.

I cannot express how much our family enjoyed these with words....but I will try. I was looking for a special veggie to go with my daughter's 16th birthday party dinner, which was a mystery murder meal.  I wanted it to be a bit fancy looking, so their plates looked pretty.  I bought steamer bags of green beans and steamed them about 3/4 of the way, let them cool and wrapped them in large clumps with a full slice of the Hormel fully cooked bacon. (I had to soften the bacon a few seconds in the microwave.)  I didn't change the rest of the recipe, but the changes I made made it so much easier and the bacon was cooked.  I had one vegetarian and I just left a pile in the corner for her without bacon.  The 16 teens DEVOURED them.  It was a nice looking dish of veggies.  I do like to impress with food, and this one was impressive. However, I will make these alot...and I will probably just cut the Hormel bacon into bite size pieces and stir it up in the dish.  We like good food, so the fancy part isn't always necessary for a fabulous, fast side dish. I also made these a day ahead so all I had to do was put them in the oven the day of the party. Thank you for a great recipe!!  Yes, I made a few changes to ease my cooking process, but the recipe is still yours!

My daughter in law had these for Christmas Dinner and I decided to try them for the Super Bowl party.  They were a huge hit, but next time I will use fresh green beans as suggested by other reviewers.
Posting for the first time, but I love alllrecipes.com.
Hooked up by my daughter and it has been a daily internet relationship since.

What can I say...you start of with healthy green beans, then you add butter, brown sugar, and bacon! No one alive could resist that! Tastes & looks great and is actually very easy to make.

I have been making these for about 25 years now. The only thing different is that the recipe I have calls for frozen petite green beans(CW). Also says to use center cut bacon. Used both and are equally good. I am going to try with the canned beans because it will make it a lot less expensive to make.

Simply awesome!  I used fresh green beans and blanched them slightly and they were perfect.  I did find that there was too much glazing liquid, so when I make it the second time (with frozen beans this time - also worked well), I cut the liquid and drained it well before serving.  Absolutely the hit of Christmas dinner!

Absolutely love this dish. Made on Thanksgiving so I was trying to do everything I could in a crockpot including this. Turned out awesome! Pre-cooked the bacon in the oven, dabbed with papertowels, chopped up then threw everything in the crockpot. Cooked on low for six hours. Great recipe!

I made these as a side for Christmas dinner yesterday, and everyone seemed quite skeptical of how they would taste. Once it reached their mouths, everyone was very impressed and asking what else was in them. They are so savory, it was the only side dish completely cleaned off. My husband is begging for me to make them again soon.   I ended up only making 2 cans worth of the green beans since the bacon we bought was the thick hearty kind by accident, securing with toothpicks. I stuck it in the oven for 25 minutes to get some of the bacon drippings removed, then added the brown sugar mix. I forgot at that point about the garlic salt, but it still tasted fine without it. I'll have to try it next time to see how it tastes then, but without it, it was still a 5-star recipe to us.

Simply Awesome - I am not a veggie eater so I try to find ways to make them edible for me - I could have eaten every single one of these - the taste was amazing.  I was not sure how they would turn out cuz the brown sugar and butter just wouldnt mix well and it didnt "pour" - I had to kind of spoon it on and spread it out but it baked perfectly - I used the microwave bacon and cooked them for about 20 seconds (4 slices) then wrapped - also used fresh green beans that I blanched first.  I was also making the bacon ranch salad which i use turkey bacon for so i cooked up a couple extra strips and made a few with turkey bacon - those were just as good.  These would be great for Thanksgiving - cant wait to impress the family with them

I made these for a christmas dinner and they were a hit.  I got several requests for the recipe. It is a little time consuming but worth it.  I will make this again.

great, I just cut the bacon in small pieces, and stirred it all together and baked in the dish. A tad sweet, but nice for a change!

This is definitely a way to try green beans. I used fresh beans[ par boiled] and cooked the bacon a few minutes, to get browned a little.When I wraped them in the bacon,I cooked them in the micro for eight minutes,and they were done.[ I was cooking my Prime Rib so I couldn't put them in the oven.] My family enjoyed them. YEA!

Wow, these were so yummy. I used fresh green beans. I cut the amount of butter and brown sugar in half.The kids loved them. My son ate at least 5 bundles and he hates veggies. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Delish! I used frozen green beans and did not wrap them. O boy were they ever good!!! I served this with Creamy Chicken Lasagna on this site and my guests ate every last bite! Tip: remove the foil and broil 2 min to get bacon crispy.

I LOVE this, though I did change it some. I did not use the salt or bacon (only because i cannnot have bacon)

I peeled and sliced up four potatoes cooked them and then placed them in a round 12" dish. I then melted 1/2 cup of butter and poured it all around/on top of the potatoes and topped it with some shredded cheddar cheese. I added canned green giant geen beans on top. I then melted 1/3 butter and added 1 cup of brown sugar to my measuring cup, mixed it well and then drizzled most of it all over the top of the beans with a fork. I wasnt sure if I had to much brown sugar for us, so I didnt use it all. Baked for 20 mins. AWESOME. We loved them. And I am refrigerating the rest of my brown sugar/butter sauce for tomorrow. We WILL be having this again tomorrow night, and many more nights in the future.

I'm giving four stars becasue the recipe calls for canned green beans. I chose to use fresh green beans, boiled for 5 minutes. I did not cut the bacon (I did pre-cook it in the microwave for a couple of minutes) because I wanted to loosely tie the bacon around the green beans & then let the ends dangle on the baking sheet, to resemble ribbon. I have tried the green bean bundles w/ italian dressing & these are much, much better. Thanks Mark Karnes!

WE SERVED THESE AT A DINNER PARTY FOR 32 PEOPLE. I HAD NEVER HEARD OF GREEN BUNDLES BEFORE. I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW EASY THEY WERE TO MAKE. THE TASTE WAS INCREDIBLE AND THEY WERE SO ELEGANT. THIS RECIPE IS A SURE FIRE HIT. EVERYONE RAVED ABOUT THEM.

My sister had been making this recipe for years and it is always a favorite. For those that are concerned about nutritional content: you can omit the butter and use either the juice from the canned green beans or the cooking liquid from the fresh in it's place.

These are the absolute best.  My advice is to use the pre cooked bacon though.  I boil fresh beans on the stovetop until tender and then wrap them with a half slice of the pre cooked stuff. It is easier, quicker, and it cuts down on the grease.  The presentation is perfect.

Good recipe!  I used fresh beans and boiled them about 5 minutes first. I made my bundles pretty big, for 4 servings instead of 6.  If you do this, you can use a toothpick to hold the bundle together.  1 cup of brown sugar seemed like a lot, so I cut it in half and it turened out just perfect!  Oh, and I fried the bacon a bit before wrapping the beans, as suggested by others.

Oh my Goodness!!!  This recipe is soooo tasty!  MMM MMM GOOD!!!  I made a few changes though.  I used fresh green beans, and for the mixture, I only used 1/2 cup of butter and brown sugar.  Even with the minor changes... they turned out wonderful!  Made them with barbecue chicken... great recipe!  Thanks a billion Mark :o)!!!

Just delicious and my kids loved it!  I blanched fresh green beans in salted water and precooked the bacon.  After putting tossing them in a casserole dish with the sauce (1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup brown sugar), I baked it for about 25 minutes side by side with a chicken dish - just great!!

These are terrific. I left out the brown sugar and garlic salt. I added regular garlic powder and pepper. Was fantastic. Definately a winner.

I just made this for Thankgiving. I made a healthier version by using fresh green beans and turkey bacon. I steamed the green beans first and also cooked the bacon a little before assembling. You can easily cut the sugar & butter in half and still have a delicious dish! I baked as directed, but remembered to uncover the last 15 minutes. It was delicious and the appearance sure beats any mushy casserole! My husband also suggested a variation using asparagus spears instead of green beans. I think I'll try that for Christmas.

This was fabulous. My brother in law brought over some fresh green beans out of his garden. I also took some bacon out of the freezer and I new it had to be cooked. So I searched for a recipe here with green beans and bacon. I found this one and made it. I let it cook in the oven @ 300 for about 2 hours. My husband and I did not even make a plate, we just ate right out of the dish in the kitchen. Yummmy.

YUM!!  I followed a few suggestions like reducing the butter/sugar by half, adding a dash of soy sauce and worcetershire sauce, using turkey (or in my case chicken) bacon, and removing the foil for the last 10minutes of baking.  These came out absolutely beautiful, and i plan on making them as a side for an anniversary dinner I'm making for my bf as I'm sure he'll love them.

I served these today for my Thanksgiving dinner.  What a hit! I used fresh beans and steamed them for about 5 minutes and let them cool. The bacon was lean and I only used 1/2 pound. I made this ahead of time and refrigerated it until it was time to bake it. I removed the foil about 15 minutes before it was done.  A nice presentation.  My son who doesn't even like green beans - had seconds!

I have tried this recipe twice now, and I still can't believe I prefer the canned green beans over the fresh!  Who does not have a can of green beans in their pantry?  I also made this more of a casserole style and I added a few quartered new/red potatos.  After you drain your green beans, rinse them to help remove some of that canned flavor.  It really helps!

I've been making a recipe similar to this however I use about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of soy sauce with the brown sugar and butter and cut the bacon into thirds. I don't cover mine with foil therefore the bacon cooks much better. I get RAVE reviews everytime I make them!!

Made this casserole style because my canned whole beans looked to short in order to make this work. Next time I will try it with fresh or whole frozen. Definitely cut down on the brown sugar. You don't need that much and the next time I make these, I will use half. Also used precooked bacon and cut the bacon into half-inch to one-inch pieces with scissors. Served with filet mignons, garlic smashed red potatoes and a spinach salad. The flavors were tremendous. Opened a nice Merlot and Zinfindel to serve with the meal (Zin actually went better than the recommended merlot did). Plan on serving this exact meal once again for my husband's birthday.

These are REALLY GOOD! That's the comment I received when I served these. I made them casserole style. First frying the bacon, then cutting it into 1 inch pieces, then mixing it with the beans. Adding the brown sugar& butter mixture over top.

Loved this...and I don't even like green beens!!!  I didn't use quite as much brown sugar as the recipe called for and turned out awesome.  I noted that some reviews said bacon was mushy (which it kind of was) but it didn't bother me or my guests at all.

This dish can NOT be healthy for you, but my girlfriend and I made this for a group of 10 people and everyone said it was the best green beans they had ever had.  I AGREE!!!  If you don't care about calories or fat, you MUST try this dish.

If you want to try a different bean dish - this is it. I really liked the sweet taste that this dish has. We made it for Easter dinner and the family really enjoyed it. My husband was not too fond of it - he doesn't like his vegetables to be 'sweet'. We did not wrap them in bundles, but cooked the bacon in small pieces and it worked out just as good.

I too have made a version of this recipe for years and get many raves.  I use a Honey Catalina French salad dressing to pour over my bundles and broil them the last few minutes to add some crispness.

My entire family loved this recipe!  Full of flavor and the intense taste of the bacon made it an absolute hit.  Perfect for trying to add a little twist to the standard green bean dish!

I also made this as a casserole to save time and it was DELISCIOUS! Even my two year old who hates green beans was asking for more. I don't think I'll ever want to make plain ol' green beans again! Thanks so much for the awesome recipe!

These taste so good, however it was kinda hard to get the bacon crispy enough. Will make again and again! Since trying the first time I have revised it by not bundling the beans, but simply cutting some lightly cooked (until fat just starts to become liquid)bacon up and adding it to an 8x8 pan with the other ingredients. It is a wonderful holiday sidedish.

I made the "deconstructed" version suggested by another reviewer.  I put six cans drained green bean in a casserole dish.  I sprinkled them with garlic salt, topped with 1 lb bacon cut into 1-inch pieces, sprinkled roughly 1/2 cup of brown sugar over that and then poured one stick of melted butter over the top.  I cooked at 350 for one hour and got rave reviews.  We had 11 people and this was a good amount.

I followed the recipe just as it says and these are fabulous! I tried them out on my family first and sent a bunch to work with my daughter and these got rave reviews! Everyone loved them!! I'm now making them this weekend as one of the appetizers for a party of 50. I have no doubt about them being a big hit! And the best part is-they are so easy to make!

This was easy enough to make and of course everything is better with bacon.  Beware the amount of fat that is rendered from the raw bacon.  When you remove the liquid, you also remove the sweetness of the butter and brown sugar.  2nd time around, I cooked the bundles for 1/2 the time, poured off the fat, THEN added the butter/sugar mixture on top and cooked the remainder of time.  Much better result!

The flavors are a great combination, I made this a little more healthy by using a half strip of bacon around 7 raw haricot vert, and cut in half the amounts of butter, brown sugar and garlic salt and still thought it was good and flavorful.  The bundles are beautiful, except I have a huge problem with wanting to eat bacon which is not crisp, which is what this method yields.  Uncovered and running them under the broiler did crisp the bacon, but shriveled the beans.  Is there anyone who uncovered the the last 10 minutes in regular oven heat AND used fresh beans AND got NICE looking beans and CRISP bacon?  Will love you forever if you know how!

Made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving.  It was absolutely delicious and so easy to make.  To save time  I steamed fresh green beans the night before and wrapped the bacon around the bundles and stuck the toothpicks in.  The next day I made the melted butter and brown sugar drizzle and topped it off with a little garlic powder.  It got rave reviews and even my dauhter, who is not a lover of green beans, gobbled them up.  Cant wait to make them again.

I added red bell peppers and cooked on the grill in foil. It really added to the tenderness of the fresh green beans.

These were pretty good but a bit overly sweet and greasy.  Not sure if the extra calories are worth it without the equivelent increase in palet pleasure.

Made these for Christmas dinner and they were a huge hit! I was hesitant about making them because when I first read the recipe, the idea of having a sweet glaze over bacon and green beans sounded kinda gross to me, but man! They compliment each other perfectly! I used frozen green beans and precooked bacon, it was delicious! Definitely will be making these in the future.

The 1st time I made this was years ago for Thanksgiving with a bunch of friends,we were doing a bacon themed Thanksgiving. Used fresh green beans that we steamed for a few minutes, partially cooked the bacon so it would be crispy, and then after assembling the bundles and sprinkling with brown sugar and butter we also sprinkled with some slivered almonds to fancy it up a little bit. Needless to say there weren't any left over.

While excited about this recipe but still on the fence...I went forth. 2 of my children liked this, my son didn't, my husband said the bacon was good but the green beans were off putting. I had to agree as well. The sweetness added to the beans was totally wrong for us. Sugared green beans just wasn't right. Won't be making this recipe, believe it should be savory....not sweet. Sorry, won't be making these again. NOT with brown sugar.

Very good with fresh green beans blanched.  Cut them up and just spread everything on top instead of wrapping to speed it up.  Worked great.  Only problem was I didn't make enough!

These tasted good but looked unappealing. I followed the directions, except for using fresh beans. At the end of the 45 minutes, the beans were a shriveled mess. I brought them to a pot luck and hardly anyone ate them. Such a waste of fresh beans and A LOT of bacon.

My late mother-in-law got this recipe years ago from an Iowa transplant to NW Arkansas who called them "Bean Stacks"... it has been a family get-together favorite ever since. (Some make it the easy way, without all the wrapping mess, tho.)

As most everyone has said, this is an amazing recipe: delicious, easy, beautiful presentation.  It is way better with fresh green beans, steamed slightly before baking. I only make it for very special occasions though, because of the calorie count. At 608 per serving, it uses up 1/2 of my daily allotment and I haven't even looked at meat, potatoes, salad or DESSERT, let alone breakfast & lunch!!!!

Very nice presentation and really good too.  Many compliments when I served these at my recent dinner party.  A very simple but good recipe.  I did lightly pre-steam the fresh green beans and applewood bacon.  Will make again!

Made in a casserole dish and not bundles as I was feeding 11.  Turned out great.  Maybe needed a little salt.  Used frozen green beans.  Peppered maple bacon fried before hand.  Cooked for same amount of time.

One of my faves! I cooked the bacon a bit so it would be crispier. My mother-in-law didn't like it the first time I cooked it because she said the bacon was raw, despite me cooking it waaay longer than the recipe suggested, which made the green beans wither. So when I cooked the bacon before-hand for about 5 minutes, it came out better. Plus, I used olive oil instead of butter. YUM!

This is the recipe that Cheryl used and loved.  She used frozen green beans and precooked bacon.  Said it was wonderful.  Had it with ham for  Easter dinner.  In reading the comments I thought Bonnies was helpful--probably about 8-10 comments down

I LOVED these! My boyfriend did not. He wanted the more traditional ones with Italian dressing. But whatever, these rock. I think next time I'll do them "deconstructed" style by just laying crumbled bacon on top. These got my eight year old to eat her vegetables so thanks for that!

Quadrupled this for a wedding rehearsal dinner. It was something the groom requested but it was new to me. I was thrilled with how tasty this was. I used the same method as others: beans in a baking dish, added butter, brown sugar, & garlic salt. Topped with chopped , cooked bacon. Definately a keeper! Thank you!

This has been a family favorite of ours for YEARS.  I sometimes I forget about it and then will cook it for a family gathering and they disappear like magic!  We NEVER have enough!  We add 1 tsp. of Soy Sauce to ours, they are delicious.  Perfect beginning to any meal, summer, winter or fall!  I ONLY used good quality whole CANNED green beans.  They are our favorite!

Good, but very sweet.  Similar sweetness to candied yams.  If you do not want sweet green beans cut the sugar by half or more.

I have made these before and they are SOOOOOO good.  They are very addictive so make extras.  I have found that the canned whole green beans work the best.

Green beans never tasted so good.  Used garlic powder instead of garlic salt but everything else stayed the same.  I will be adding this recipe to my quick and impressive side dishes.

Oh.  My.  Goodness.  Made these for Thanksgiving and they were GONE!  I should have doubled the recipe.  I didn't bundle them, just put they green beans in a casserole dish, poured the butter/sugar mixture on top, sprinkled garlic salt, then placed bacon on top.  DELISH!!!

Since I've seen several people express concern over the nutrition of these green beans, I just thought I would share that when I calculated these on another website using blue bonnet reduced fat over real butter and a leaner bacon it only noted around 9g of fat per serving.  You can always tweak the recipes on this site to make them healthier, or at least less bad.  Just wanted to share that!

This wasn't a huge disaster, but it wasn't as great as the reviews lead me to believe.  The bacon fat sort of settled to the bottom of the pan, and didn't mix well with the brown sugar mixture.  May try it again when I have more time to fiddle with the recipe.

These were delicious. I brought them to "Bacon Fest" (a potluck where everything must have something bacon in it) and it was a hit.  They did seem pretty oily though, with all the bacon grease that cooked off.  Next time I may cut down on the amount of butter, and use a tad less brown sugar.  All in all, very good!  (They're not very good cold, though.)

I LOVE this recipe.  I don't bother with wrapping them, though.  I just drain the green beans, dump them in a casserole dish, cover them with bacon and the sugar/butter mixture, sprinkle with garlic salt and bake.  Just make sure that you cook them long enough!  They don't taste right if they're not completely cooked.

I didn't use all the green beans or bacon.
I also took the foil off and turned the bundles then put them back in for about a minute and a half.

This is a favorite recipe of mine now. I have cooked it at least 3 times in the last 2 weeks. The best!!!

These green beans were easy to make and tasted great.  Following the advice of other reviewers, on the morning of my dinner party I blanched the beans and slightly cooked the bacon before assembling the bundles.  I did use about 10 beans per bundle.  Closer to serving time I prepared the sauce and baked for 45 minutes.  Next time, I will also make the sauce in advance and cook the bacon a little longer.  It was not very crisp and half of my guests left it behind on their plates.  Everyone raved about the flavor and presentation.

These tasted great and are great to serve for company. The only problem is that I found 3 cans of green beans to be too much - 2 cans would be enough. I find these turn out best if you wrap the beans in bacon and then bake them (WITHOUT the brown sugar and butter) about 20-25 minutes. I then take them out of the oven, dump the grease, then top with brown sugar and butter and continue to bake another 20-25 minutes. This will significantly cut down on the amount of grease "floating" on top when you take them out of the oven. I also prefer to cut back on the butter just a tad otherwise it can be an overwhelming amount of fat/grease. Oh yeah, and you definitely do NOT need to grease the pan first.

My whole family enjoyed these green beans!  The only changes I made- I patial cooked the bacon before I wrapped them, I used a whole piece of bacon instead of cutting them in half, I used fresh out of the garden green beans, and finally I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I think they would have been too sweet if I used 1 cut.  They were great!!

This a great recipe. I ended up just putting it all in a pot to simmer. If you do it that way, be sure to put the bacon in the pot raw and let it cook with the other ingredients, it gives it a better flavor.

Delicious!   I also recommend precooking the bacon and the beans just a little as this cuts down on cooking time! I also used fresh green beans. I will add this to my list of favorites!

These are a bit of work, making all the little bundles. I still make them pretty often. I always use whole frozen green beans instead of cans. This is our favorite green bean recipe. Thanks for sharing it!

Would have given it four and a half if i could.  These string beans were freaking awsome.  The bacon on the other hand needed to be cooked a bit longer.  If only i had listened to the other recommendations and precooked it prior to using it.  I used fresh string beans and cooked them for about 7 min in boiling water befor wraping them with the bacon.  Will definately make again with a few tweaks.

REALLY BIG HIT WITH MY FAMILY!!!  I've prepared these twice now.  The second time I had my sister and her family over - she said she ALWAYS fixes these for company - I responded with "Well, I guess WE'Ve never been company!"  Just think - I could have known about this for years!  Turns out - lots of people I know have cooked and loved these for years...Where Have I Been?  LOL

This recipe was really great except instead of wrapping the beans in bacon, I cooked the bacon first and just sprinkled it on top. I also used fresh beans.

Delicious!  Used suggestions from previous reviews.  Particularly, using steamed, fresh green beans and less butter/brown sugar.  Worstershire adds a nice flavor to the recipe.  Will definitely make this again, though will reserve for special occasions as it is very rich.

These beans are fabulous!  Wow, I have never tasted any veggie that tasted this good!  The kids loved these, even the kids that hate green beans!  I used long frozen green beans, and steamed them first for just a few minutes.  I made the mistake of uncovering the dish and leaving it in the oven for a few minutes, which made the beans wilt I think.  Next time I will just keep the beans frozen and keep them covered!  What an awesome recipe!!

Two of my six kids hate green beans, but couldn't get enough of these bundles! They said they tasted like really sweet little breakfast sausages. Worth the extra time to roll the bacon!

I used fresh green beans and forgot the garlic and they were AWESOME! I have made these 4 times now and everyone loves them.I Will be making this instead of green bean casserole for Thanksgiving. I have also thrown them in aluminum foil and grilled them. Just remember when grilling to poke holes in the foil to let the grease drain.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I liked this recipe except I would use fresh green beans (steamed) next time because the canned beans broke apart easily as I was trying to wrap them with the bacon.  Also, I cut the sugar and butter by half.  Next time, I'll also remove the foil the last 10 minutes to give the bacon a chance to get a little crispy.

I tried this side dish for Thanksgiving and it was just not to my taste. The presentation was pretty and I would have to agree with other raters that using fresh green beans would probably work better than the canned. I did not use the amount of green beans and bacon called for in the recipe, so that could have made a difference also.

Wonderful!  We really enjoyed these!  Used turkey bacon to cut down on fat and used garlic powder instead of salt to cut down on sodium.  Everyone at dinner mentioned that they felt they were at a fancy restaurant when they saw these little bundles.  Next time though, I will try fresh green beans as the canned were a little small and soft.

This is a great recipe.  Evertime I make everyone raves about it. I case you are short of time I have spread the beans in a 9x13 pan,poured the sauce of the beans and layed the bacon over the top and backed as usual.  Tastes great just not a fancy looking,but great if you are in a hurry!

I loved these green beans! They were so good and my company loved them. I cooked the bacon slightly and made the bundles early. Then when I was ready to put them in the over I quickly made the glaze and they were set to go while I prepared the rest of the meal. Yum! Yum!

You REALLY need to use BIG green beans.....probably FRESH ones, since they are usually bigger. 

The can green beans are WAY TOO SMALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Very tasty. I used frozen green beans and pre-cooked the bacon slightly. My only complaint was that I thought they were a little soggy. Next time I'll probably take the foil off for the last 10 minutes.

We really enjoyed this!  The first time I got frenched green beans by mistake, but it tasted just as great.  I cooked the bacon, cut it into 1" pieces, combined it with the beans in dish, then poured the brown sugar mixture over the topand gently stirred.  My guests loved it!

I made this recipe for my dinner club and I got RAVE reviews!!  This will now be on my Thanksgiving menu permanently.  I did make a few changes to the recipe.  Like other reviews I didn't use nearly as much of the butter/br. sugar glaze as called for, I just drizzled a little over each bundle.  I also, used frozen green beans and partially cooked the bacon before hand.  It was delicious and had good presentation!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

We didn't care for the bacon flavor with fresh green beans.  It was just overpowering.  Fresh beans with olive oil, and a little salt and pepper is the way to go.

This was a hit at a christmas potluck.  Even my finicky husband who claimed he didn't like them (before he tried them), was caught eating them bundle by bundle.  I varied my ingredients a bit...used 2 sticks of unsalted butter,  1.5 lbs bacon, 1 cup brown sugar, 1 tbsp Liquid Smoke, 1 tbsp of Tony Cachere's seasoning, and left it uncovered, basting once during cooking.  They only took about 20 minutes to roll, and it lined the bottom of a 9"x13" glass dish.  Was told to make again, and the guys would by the groceries required!!

I used frozen green beans instead of canned and because I do not have the patience to tie things up in bundles, I also did it the casserole way.  I precooked the bacon because I like it crunchy.  We were skeptical at first, but my husband and I ate four helpings each and I had enough to freeze for another time.  What a wonderful dish! Especially when you're sick to death of the traditional green bean casserole.  Thanks!

This was a good dish - tasty and attractive.  I'm not sure if it was just me, or what - I had scads of glaze leftover.  If I would have put the whole amount over the green beans they would have been candied.  Instead, I spooned what seemed like a good amount - a couple of tablespoons over each bundle and it was perfect.  I, too, steamed the beans the night before, partially cooked the bacon and assembled the bundles.  All I had to do was put them in the oven while the turkey rested.

These were good, just a tad bit cumbersome to make.  I did put more green beans than called for in a bundle.  They also seemed a bit greasy.

These were SO good!  I did like some of the others, and made it into a casserole.  I diced the bacon and then fried it, before adding it to the beans.  I also added slightly less brown sugar than the recipe called for, because I wasn't sure if it would be too sweet.  I turned out perfectly and everyone complimented me on it.  Later I found my husband eating the remaining beans right out of the serving dish, because he didn't want any to go waste.  This will definitely appear on my Thanksgiving table this year.

Made this with fresh green beans (canned, yuk!) and roasted them instead. Bacon was crispy and so were beans. Brown sugar and butter came at the end.

When/If I make these again ... I'd like to cook the bacon a bit before wrapping it around the green beans ... we prefer our bacon very crispy.  I used fresh green beans from the produce aisle and they cooked just fine.  I sprinkled on the brown sugar ... afraid of overdoing it on sweetness and it was a great balance for my family.

The brown sugar-butter mix is a little too thick. I think I will use less brown sugar next time.

Delicious! Everyone loved them. Easy to make ahead of time and canned green beans speed up the cooking time. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt for less sodium.

I used Splenda as my husband is doing low carb. I believe I used eight Splenda packets. I steamed fresh beans first but I believe I over cooked. My bundle fell apart easily. The taste was good but a little sweet for me. My husband is a non vegetable eater and liked this a lot. The toddler would only eat the bacon.

I followed the recipe exactly and they are a family favorite.  I have got lazy and just started using cut green beans because the whole ones are hard to find locally.  I pour everything  else on top.  They taste the same, just not as pretty to look at.

Omg!!! Best recipe ever. I used fresh French green beans. I did not steam or blanch because we prefer them a little crunchy. I baked the bacon at 350 degrees for 15 minutes till half way cooked and easy to wrap around the beans. For the sauce I used half a stick of melted butter, 1/3 cup brown sugar, garlic pepper to taste and a tbsp of soy sauce. Once the beans were wrapped and the sauce was put on, I put a pinch of sea salt on each bundle. Cooked on 350 degrees for 35 minutes. I will not have green beans any other way ever again. Thank you for this must try recipe.

Terrible recipe. They turned out ok after I took them out of all the liquid that was left and put them in a separate pan and broiled them for a few minutes to crisp the chewy bacon. Will not use this recipe ever again.

Made this SUPER simple dish as a side dish this thanksgiving, since so many people in our family don’t like green bean casserole...needless to say it was amazing and I was asked for the recipe more than once! This is officially our go to green dish for thanksgiving from here on out!

Followed the directions to the letter. Foil covered at 350 for 45 and the syrup was burned to a crisp and just ruined this special side for dinner last night. Very disappointing and I laid in bed wondering what the heck we did wrong. I will try it again however another recipe similar but w Worcestershire and etc said to only bake for 20-25. I will try lessening the time next go around. I was so hopeful with this side because of the reviews. Oh well. There's always next time. ??

I used fresh green beans instead of the processed ones.  They were a hit at dinner.  I'd like to try this recipe substituting asparagus for the green beans and see how that turns out.

I do not care for the taste of canned green beans so that's why I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of five.  Instead I used fresh green beans.  It's a little bit of extra work because you have to wash them and steam them before you continue with the recipe but it's worth it

This is a great veggie side dish for company! They look great and taste fantastic!  I did tie each one with a thin strip of slightly steamed green onion (so they become pliable).  I would definitely make them again!

The green beans were a hit at our party. They are extremely easy to make and taste excellent. I have never cooked bacon in the oven before so left them in a little longer to make sure it was cooked.

Great recipe! Pleased all the picky eaters at our Christmas dinner. The recipe calls for a little too much bacon- we had plenty left over. We also reduced the bundle size to 5 green beans instead of 7. You should definitely use fresh beans instead of store bought cans.

These are quite different from my grandmother's but wonderful.  I did use fresh beans and blanched them first and partially pre-cooked the bacon. I changed to half a cup of brown sugar. Tasty, and the green bundles are really pretty next to the browns and tans of dressing, mashed potatoes, yams and turkey.

I made this for a potluck.  It got great reviews!  The only changes I made were to cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and I used garlic powder instead of salt as my bacon is very salty already.  I will definitely make this again.

These were amazing!! I added just a sprinkling of parmesan on top when they came out of the oven, and they were delish! Next time I think I'll do a bundle of 6 instead of 7, and I definitely want to add some minced garlic to the bundles as well! Overall 10/10

This was delicious! I used less sugar and it was still pretty sweet but a huge hit at my dinner party.

I did a practice run of this as I want to serve this at a dinner I am hosting! I ate 3 times what my husband ate! It was very yummy. I will be serving this for sure but will have to double the recipe.! He was not expecting this to be sweet and really liked it. 
I used Turkey bacon and bought the thin variety. I only needed to bake it for 20 minutes.  The bacon was not crisp but it had browned very nicely. I did not precook the bacon because it was so thin. We were not quite ready to eat so these held in the oven(turned off) for about 8 min. 
There was lots of juice left, so I will cut back on the butter when I make these again. I will post again after I make this for a crowd and let you know how it went over. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

These have become a staple at every holiday feast in our home. My daughter makes up the bundles for me and I prepare the sauce. I go ahead and add the garlic salt to the butter mixture instead of sprinkling it on.  We love this recipe!

I have been making these for about 30 years and they are great! These are full of sweet and fat so don't make these for a group that would not be on board with that. Be sure to cook long enough for the bacon to crisp.

Really good and pretty too.  Definitely cook the bacon a bit first so it browns without overcooking the beans.  I too added some garlic salt along with the topping.  Very tasty.

If you do not like sweet flavors, this recipe may not suit you.   Also, I used fresh green beans...not canned.  The only problem with this recipe is it should always be doubled!! Everyone wanted seconds and thirds.  Now I know for next time!  I give this 10 stars, not 5.

This is more like a dessert, but soooooo good!! I didn't wrap the green beans because I had canned french green beans. I just laid the bacon on top and it was delicious.

We have several people in our group that are dairy sensitive so I made 2 batches of these; one exactly at written and one that replaced the butter with coconut oil.  Both were delicious and got raves at the party. I think the one with coconut oil was just a little bit tastier. We loved it.

Had a little trouble having the bundles stay together but I think wrapping them tighter with less beans in them would do the trick. I used fresh green beans that I steamed for this. Everyone seemed to enjoy these - though not quite as much as I did, probably because I'm the big green bean fan in the house. But even my picky husband had a few bundles without me forcing him, so it's a great way to sneak some vegetables in for those who hate anything green. Better to eat beans in bacon than no beans at all!

Like others I used fresh green beans since they were readily available at the local farmer's market.  I parboiled them first and followed the recipe.  It added a nice touch to an ordinary Sunday dinner!

My daughter in law made these for us at Thanksgiving dinner.  They were wonderful!  Although she used minced garlic with the sugar syrup and did not cover with foil so the bacon crisped while cooking.  I'm making them myself for Christmas dinner with friends.

Wonderfully delicious recipe! I changed my prep a bit from this recipe though. I make it even more fattening by using maple-flavored bacon as opposed to normal bacon. Before wrapping the bundles I sprinkle the brown sugar directly on the pre-cooked (fried a couple of minutes before baking) bacon. Next wrap the bundles, cover them all with melted butter, and finally lightly sprinkle more brown sugar and garlic salt. I bake without covering the pan. Delicious!!

3 for taste and 5 for presentation.  I agree this is definitely not a very healthy dish.

This is a refreshing change of pace for the green bean. I used fresh beans, turkey bacon and margarine to cut down on the fat/sodium. Beautiful presentation, didn't like the texture of the beans (basting in the juice probably would help). Nice flavor, hubby loved them cold the next morning.

Delicious!  And a huge hit with two different sets of 'consumers'.  Next time I will reduce the bacon and the butter.  A bit too fatty for us.

This is a great way to serve a vegetable for a holiday dinner and give it a little more pizzazz.  I think the ingredients list and also the nutritional info is off - I only used 1 slice of bacon per serving so 6 servings did not take 1 pound of bacon, only about 1/3 of a lb.  And I halved the butter and brown sugar too.  So I wouldn't necessarily believe that 1 serving of these green beans is 681 calories, which was a relief!

3.5 Stars, really. I made this recipe as an alternative to the traditional green bean casserole for Thanksgiving. Kids gobbled these green beans up.  I, however, found them to be too sweet.   I will make them again, but I will definitely use less sugar next time.  I also boiled for about 5 minutes then blanched to make cook time a little less when it was time to bake.  Easy to prep ahead of time and just throw into the oven.

I made this dish for thanksgiving this year. It was a huge hit and a great alternative to the green bean casserole! I drained the brown sugar and butter after I cooked it. I had to travel with it and had no issues! It easily warmed up in the oven and still looked great! I'm adding this to my family menu now!

These were an excellent addition to a pork roast dinner I prepared a while back. They were surprisingly easy to prepare; I worried that they would fall apart in the oven, but they held together beautifully. They only got four stars instead of five because with all the fat and sugar, they really don't count as a vegetable anymore. But I'm sure they'd make a great appetizer!

I made these to go with some veal marsala for company last night. I was so surprised when I took off the foil and found my beans cooked down to little skinny twigs. I used fresh slightly steamed green beans and applewood smoked bacon. They tasted good, but were disappointing. I'll try it again but precook the bacon so the oven time can be cut down.

Mmm... these disappeared in a hurry!  I had to use beef bacon, since our family can't have pork, but I think that the flavor was still very good.  I just wish I could have convinced the 5 year old to try some!

Soooooo good! Not only did I love this, but so did my husband, tween, and preschooler.   I made the following changes: After baking 25 minutes, I took the bundles and grilled them on my gas grill for about 3 minutes on each side. I removed them, and drizzled leftover butter-sugar sauce from the earlier pan over the bundles right before serving.  I will definitely make this one again!

I used fresh green beans and pan fried them before wrapping in bacon.  Although I loved them, my husband said it took away the "greenbean taste". They were crispy on the inside, but a little wilted looking on the out.  I'd do it again just for cool presentation

Thank you sooo much for this easy and tasty recipe.  I only changed one thing and that was the use of garlic powder instead of salt.  This will be a family favorit for a long time!  Thanks Again!

Definitely use fresh green beans and precook the bacon... but not too much, or it won't adhere to itself once you wrap it around the beans!

These are terrific!!! I never seem to have the time to wrap them in bundles, so I just always lay the bacon over the top and cook them in a casserole dish that way. My husband and kids LOVE them!!!!

I brought these to a party and the plate was empty within 5 minutes. I prepared them as directed but steamed fresh beans before bundling them. Then I baked them for 45 minutes covered and gave them another 10-15 minutes uncovered. I'm sure they would be just that much better if you crisped the bacon first but I didn't want to take the extra time. I made it at home then just stuck them in the oven to heat them back up at the party.

I don't know where I went wrong with this recipe- followed it exactly except for I pre cooked center cut bacon (which I have found to crisp up nicely in the past)before wrapping the beans.  My canned beans were way to small-- will use fresh beans next time.  Could barely fit 5-6 beans inside half a piece of bacon.  The bacon never did crisp up and half of these were left over at a huge party I had.  I will give it a whirl again though, but will make sure to precook the bacon longer, and use fresh beans instead!

Yummy. I didn't have time to bundle so I put everything in a dish and baked with cut up bacon on top. Used turkey bacon and fake brown sugar (1 cup of Splenda and 1/4 cup sugar free maple syrup). Even my 4 year old wanted seconds. Thanks for the recipe.

I always make these ahead of time, then warm them in the microwave to crisp the bacon.  I also add a little black pepper to the sauce.  You can also try using maple flavored bacon.  My family begs for these!

This has completely replaced my standard Green Bean Casserole for Christmas dinner!  It is soooooo good.  I didn't use the butter in the recipe and it was flavorful enough.  Since bacon is usually salty enough, I used garlic powder instead of salt.  You could probably use about 10 beans per 1/2 strip of bacon & pushed a toothpick through to hold the bundle together!
VERY YUMMY!  10 stars if I could!

Love it!  I did as other reviewers suggested and rather than spending time wrapping the green beans, I just dumped the beans, precooked bacon (from the package) and the sauce into the pan.  Didn't have quite the same presentation value, but tasted great!

So good! They were my bf favorite part of the Turkey day meal and he hates beans.  A little sweet for me I would cut sugar next time. I steamed the beans and partially pre-cooked the bacon the night before so they were a cinch to put together and didn't take long to cook at all.  Thanks!

This turned out fantastic.  I used fresh green beans, blanched for only a few minutes, and then covered with bacon pieces (didn't want to do the bundles) and the sugar/butter mixture.  Turned out awesome!  Just have to be careful so the beans don't turn mushy.

it was good, but I think being the side dish category is wrong.. the bacon creates so much grease that the green beans just soak in it. and feel it is to fatty to mix in with another meal.

Amazing.  I had no idea beans could taste this good. I made 24 bundles for a dinner for 8.  Every last bean was gone.  Everyone raved and asked me for the recipe. I used fresh green beans, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Thank You Thank You Thank You!!!

SO GOOD! I cooked my bacon a bit before (used chicken bacon) and also used fresh green beans, boiled for 5 minutes prior. I also added some worchstire sauce and lemon juice, & decreased the amount of sugar. Baked at 350 for 30 minutes then unwrapped foil for the remaining 15 minutes. DELISH!

Took this to a boy scout potluck.  Was completely eaten up.  A little sweet for me, even though I followed the recommendations of cutting back by half on both the butter and the brown sugar.  I also precooked the bacon in the microwave to get rid of alot of the fat.

Taste was very good although I could not find very many green beans long enough, even in the most expensive brand can. So next time will cook fresh beans instead as other raters suggested.  The best thing about this recipe was the WOW factor. My guests raved about the presentation. Big pay off for the little effort it required.

This tasted so fabulous!!! what a great alternative to your standard holiday green bean casserole!! I read the other reviews, so I used fresh beans and actually when I took them out of the oven, we had lots of kids, so I thought best to just quickly chop it all up in the dish to just mix the beans and bacon, rather than leave them in the bundles - just an option! And I used 1/2 the sugar called for.

I tried to follow the recipe as close as I could.  the only change I made was using frozen green beans from last summer.  I took this to a family dinner.  Everyone gave a bad time for having too much time because of all the little bundles.  However, there were no left overs,  I used thin sliced bacon, and broiled it a few minutes before serving.  It was a crowd pleaser!

They sounded like a good idea.  I like the presentation, but I wasn't big on the flavor.  In a group of 12 girls, only 2 bundles actually got eaten.  They were also a pain to make.

These were a nice change from the typical green bean casserole at thanksgiving.  They were easy to prepare (I used frozen whole green beans which I thawed slightly before making my bundles) but a bit too sweet for my taste.  I agree with the others who say to put it under the broiler to further crisp the bacon.

This is wonderful!  We have this several times a month now.  The only thing I do a little different is use garlic powder, and I usually use more than a teaspoon! (about 2-2 1/2 tsp.)  We usually have it with grilled pork chops..makes a great side.

These were amazing! I was looking for a green bean recipe for Thanksgiving, and this is the one. The saltiness and sweetness go together perfectly. Next time I might try steamed fresh green beans, however, because the canned beans tended to break and were rather small.

I meant to make this for Christmas but never got around to it so I dug the recipe back out last weekend.  I baked and baked and baked it.  I even went back to the reviews to see if anyone else had to bake it longer.  After an hour and a half the beans were shriveled up but the bacon not even close to being done.  If I make it again I would take the others' advice and use pre-cooked bacon.  Also it was WAY too sweet to have as a side dish but I think it would be ok as an appetizer?  Sorry

I made this recipe casserole style like some other users suggested b/c I was in a hurry. That simplicity was the good part, but the flavor was very dissapointing. They were way too sweet and didn't really absorb any of the flavors other than the sugar. I don't think I will be using this one anymore.

Was excited to try this recipe for an upcoming dinner party.  The bundles really are a lovely presentation, impressive.  I used fresh green beans and steamed them first and partially cooked bacon before wrapping.  Uncovered the last 15 minutes and the bacon looked very nice.  They were really good, but I think I might look to some of the other green bean bundle recipes and add other ingredients to the sauce so it isn't quite so sweet.  The idea is wonderful and they really look beautiful!!!

I was very impressed with this dish.  I was a bit nervous to try it out, but I can safely say that I'll be making my green beans like this more often.  The bundle wrapping was very simple and hardly time consuming at all.  Leftover veggies usually sit in the fridge until I throw them out a week later.  Not these green beans!  Thanks for sharing.

I loved this.  I would give this 5 stars if the recipe suggested fresh green beans instead which I used.  I made this with Easter dinner and everyone loved the way they presented themselves and the taste was delicious.  Thank you.

Awesome!  All I had for beans were my home canned spicey pickled beans.  The sour/spicey flavor of the beans made it not too sweet.  Also made it casserole style,  cooking the bacon first.  Totally fattening and delicious!

These were great, although with as much sauce that was involved I was hoping they would have been sweeter.  Our guests were quite impressed with the presentation and one guy told his wife that he had to make these at home because it made him want to eat vegetables.  I used turkey bacon which tasted great, and it doesn't shrivel since it's much lower in fat!

These are the best green beans I've ever eaten. However they are very fattening, so I would only make them on special occasions.  My husband keeps asking when I'm going to make them again.

My friend made these and brought them to our Thanksgiving dinner.  They were absolutely delicious and pretty, too.  I'm adding this recipe to my "keeper" file.  Thanks for sharing, Mark.

I made it like a casserole with diced green beans & precooked turkey bacon, using only half a cup of brown sugar & they were awesome.  Definately a special occasion veggie though with all the butter & sugar.

We are vegetarians, so I made the green beans without the bacon. I used two cans of green beans and added one can of carrots.  Next time I'd use two of each instead. These green beans were SO GOOD!!!  I didn't think they were overly sweet, but I have a sweet tooth so I might use a little less sugar for guests.
