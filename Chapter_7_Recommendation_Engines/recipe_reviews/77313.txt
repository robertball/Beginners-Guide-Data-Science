This dessert is so easy and it's extremely tasty. My family devoured the entire dish in just one sitting (and their are only four of us!) I would definitely make this again.

If I could rate this recipe minus stars I would. The baking mix is too salty for this recipe when combined with the butter, and there is a metallic taste from the baking powder in the mix. My teenage boys, who will usually eat anything, wouldn't touch it after one bite. This is just awful when made as directed in the instructions. I wish I had my ingredients back.

This was a pretty quick & easy recipe, except for peeling the apples. I brought this to a friend's house and it was a hit. I thought perhaps there was a little too much butter in it. My suggestion to the people who thought it was too salty is to use unsalted butter. It's worth another try.

I used fat-free sweetened condensed milk as well as low-fat bisquick mix with Fuji apples.  Everybody loved it.  I did make in a 9x13 pan - but I think next time I will use a smaller pan.  And there will be a next time!

This dish is wonderful!  If you like cobbler dishes, you'll love this!  It's similar but better!  Quick-n-easy too!  We had some relatives over the first time I fixed it and everyone, including my picky girls, LOVED IT!!

This came out okay--not great. While it was warm, I served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and the starving bachelor I fed it to was very appreciative. Once it cooled though, it was yucky when reheated...

Oh my goodness. I have been waiting to try this recipe for some time now, but never had time. My husband swears this is one of the BEST desserts he has ever had. Absolutly amazing. I hate when people put that they loved the recipe but here's what I changed......and in the end its not even the same recipe. I omitted the nuts. Thats it. Made it exactly like the recipe stated, a dollop of ice cream on top....oh my GOD to die for! seriously! I will say mine looked NTOHING like the photo but hey, tasted out of this world. Think cross between apple pie and apple crisp, but somehow better. !!!!!

I made this dessert for company tonight, and I thought it was delicious! I used unsalted butter and added just a dash of nutmeg.  I will definitely be making this again!

I made it exactly as stated.  The apple part on the bottom layer was pasty and unappealing.  My husband wouldn't touch it.  And I wish I wouldn't have eaten the one piece, it didn't taste good at all, so not a good calorie trade off either.

Disappointed baked for the full 60 minutes.

This desert was gummy as if it had not cooked long enough yet the top edges were close to burning. The chopped apples were also not quite done and in general,the overall taste was bland.

I tried this last night and it was great. I may have done a few things differently bc I didn't have bisquick. I used as a substitute krusteaz pancake mix and I am glad that I did. It made it have extra dough and I don't know about you but I am definitely a crust person. My husband and I enjoyed this alot. Thanks! We plan on making this with peaches next time instead of cobbler!!!

This is a great recipe. I made mine differently. Instead of using biscuit mix, I used Duncan Hines Cinnabon Cinnamon Streusel Muffin/Quick Bread mix. I sprinkled pumpkin pie spice on the apples, and didn't use any cinnamon (in muffin mix). I cut the butter to 5T, and will reduce further next time. The muffin mix came with a cinnamon streusel topping, so I used that (and didn't add any sugar to the dessert). It was delicious, but definitely required longer than one hour and I had to up it to 350. I will make this again, hubby enjoyed, too!

This is the BEST recipe I have tried in a long time!! We had gone apple picking and had apples that were staring to soften. This was a great way to use them up and the taste was fantastic.  It was a hit with the entire family. Mine however, looked more like an apple crisp type dessert then the bar-like dessert shown in the photo. Also, loved how easy it was to make.

The topping on this is delicious!! I agree with the first reviewer, however, that the biscuit mix is a bit too salty for the sweetness of the apples / topping. I will definitely borrow the topping mixture and play around with the recipe for the cake (bread?) part of this. It's a great idea.
