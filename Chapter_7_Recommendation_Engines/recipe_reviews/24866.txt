The unusual combination of ingredients threw me off when reading through the list, but they absolutely worked together beautifully!  I added cranraisins the second time I made this and it was a nice addition.  Either way this is a new twist on a classic sandwich.  Thanks Darra!

REALLY GOOD...i enjoyed this very much!  Quite a good mix of tuna and waldorf.  Naturally, i change/manipulated a few things and used similar items i already had in the pantry.  Changes are: miracle whip instead of fatty mayo, left out the curry, used water-packed tuna, used dill relish, and used pita bread instead of the croissants (with Boston lettuce leaves).  With these modifications, it became a VERY good low-fat sandwich i will continue to make!

Great recipe but I used canned chicken the second time rather than tuna and it tasted much better.  I'd definitely recommend the chicken.  It was great!

This was the best tuna salad i've ever had.  I was hesitant at first but I went ahead and made it.  The minute my husband took a bite he said "this is delicious, what's in it".  I was pleased.  I did reduce the mayo amount to 1/3 cup.  THanks for a great recipe.  Definitely a keeper

This tuna salad was very good.  Next time I make it I will reduce the mayo to 1/3 cup. I would recommend increasing the curry a tiny bit. I would also add more nuts.  The combination of the ingredients is great. I used solid white waterpacked tuna.  It tasted fancy.

What a refreshing change from our good old tuna salad.  It can also translate well to chicken salad, etc.  I made it as tuna-macaroni salad and got raves.

This was one terrific tuna salad.  I made it exactly as written except for the shallot, and served in half a ripe papaya.  Cool and tasty!  I'm doubling the recipe next time!

This was a wonderful recipe -- the dressing on it was delicious.  I used more tuna than it called for and served it at a brunch buffet as a salad, rather than in sandwiches.  It was a big hit!

Great change from the usual tuna salad.  I used water packed tuna and left out the walnuts, and it was still very good.

I add a few chopped dates to this recipe too and sometimes have it on toasted raisin bread without the swiss cheese.  It's so yummy!

I have made this tuna salad probably close to 15+ times and it is exceptional.  I pretty much follow the recipe verbatim, and throw in extra nuts, apples, or tuna based on my whim of the day.  The only other substitution that I might alter is that I will use pecans instead of walnuts, all just dependent on what I have in the cupboard.  

I make this for my family and have even served it at luncheons.  It is a hit with my 3 and under kids, and a hit with my 13 and 21 year old as well. This is a "gourmet" tuna salad without spending tons of time in the kitchen, and relieves the oft boring regular tuna salad.  The blends and hints of spices is wonderful without overwhelming the recipe and they compliment each other surprisingly well.  I have served this to the teachers at my  children's school with overwhelming applause from the teachers and staff.  I bring the croissants and cheese in, but also offer (usually Boston) lettuce to the teachers so they can make a "lettuce roll sandwiches" as a lower calorie option.  Kudos to Darra for saving us all from boring, dry tuna fish salad served the old fashioned way.

I scaled the recipe to 2 servings.  Only used 1/8 cup of mayo, left out the shallots, subbed 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed for the walnuts, used canned albacore tuna in water and only a few dashes of curry powder.  The apple, curry and nutty taste add a new twist to a tuna fish sandwich.

Way too much apple!  I used 2 cans of tuna and it was still overboard!  Did not like the mustard in it, either.  Keep looking for a good tuna salad recipe because this isn't it!

This was great, just what I was looking for - a different way to make tuna salad. I only had 1/4 cup mayo on hand, so I substituted 1/4 cup plain yogurt. It was so good this way (and much healthier) I don't know that I'd ever want to try it with a 1/2 cup mayo!! I also used spicy brown mustard, I was out of dijon. I did add one hard boiled egg and used a little more pickle relish. I didn't have any croisssants, so I toasted my bread and added sliced tomato, too. SO YUMMY and satisfying!! Good on crackers, too!

This was a very good version of tuna salad. I used some finely chopped onion instead of the shallot and I used a little less mayonnaise, but those were the only changes I made. I'll  make this one again!

An excellent sandwich recipe!  Gives a great twist to plain ol' tuna salad - very crunchy.  I used a honeycrisp apple instead of grannysmith and we did not use the croissants, we ate it in pita pockets instead.

Fabulous.  I love the crunch of the apples and celery paired with the creamy curry mayo.  I too, cut way back on the fat.  I used Hellman's "Just 2 Good" and used a whole wheat pita pocket with romaine lettuce.  What a delicious lunch.  Thank you so much for shareing.

OK but not great.  Felt it had too much apple and not enough tuna.  The flavor was a little off to me.  Probably will not make again.

Really great!  I did use chicken instead, since I preferred that with the other ingredients.  I omitted the pickle relish, used cashews instead of walnuts, and diced up a fuji apple tossed with a Tblspn. of lemon juice.  Also I used green onion instead of a shallot.  It can out just fine.

I made this exactly like the recipe but left out the shallot because I couldn't find any at our store. Next time I hope to try it with that in it. My husband and kids loved it! I was worried about the mustard but it gave it a nice tangy flavor. The curry was great in it also. Thanks for the recipe!

I really like this tuna salad, especially the dressing (but I did use a little less than called for).  My husband didn't even realize it was tuna! I used water packed tuna and light mayo and served it on toasted bread without the cheese, and it still tasted fancier than plain ole tuna!

Flavors mix well together.  Better the second and third days for leftovers!  I agree with other reviewers that regular brown mustard is best.  I made both ways and thought the dijon was too sweet.  I have also made using yogurt/miracle whip mixture as suggested by others to cut the fat drastically and it is wonderful.  Both canned chicken breast or albacore tuna in foil packs work perfectly in this recipe.

Such a refreshing change from traditional tuna salad.  I used pears instead of granny smith apples and tossed some dried cranberries into the mix.  It's not necessary to use oil packed tuna - you can use water packed tuna to cut down on calories and fat.

EXCELLENT!! This was so delicious, and so easy. It's definitely worth the extra time chopping the apple and celery. Definitely a keeper! Thanks!!

We loved this filling.  I did use chicken instead of tuna.  The crunchiness of the walnuts and celery with the tartness of the apple placed on the softness of the cressant roll is a wonderful combination. I used fresh cracked pepper, which I love.

This was really good.  I also think it would be good with diced ham as well.  I think this might be better on crackers.. it does lose itself wrapped in a big roll.

this was good - due to what I had on hand, I made the following changes, used pecans instead of walnuts, a different type of apple and miracle whip instead of mayo. I will make it with the stated ingredients next time and I bet it will be even better.

This is definitely an adult tuna salad sandwich.  A real change-up if you want a "kicked up" sandwich.  However, if you're going to be within 3' of anyone after eating this sandwich, I would suggest cutting the shallot & curry amount in at least half!  All I could taste was the shallot and the curry.  Good, but couldn't tell there was any tuna in it. I don't know where others got that this is bland? or that their small children liked it???  Not bad, but not a keeper for me either.  Made exactly as directed.

Neat change from regular boring tuna salad. This also makes one can of tuna go quite a long way. It's good just the way it is with some lettuce and tomato rather than in a sandwich.

By far the best Tuna Salad filling I have ever tasted.  I didn't have curry, so I substituted paprika, and I had dill relish instead of sweet.  Used not quite 1/2 c mayo for 7 1/2 oz of tuna.  This is definately on my list for quick lunches.  Thanks Darra!

okay, okay I couldn't submit this with out a rating--just a nice adaptation to this recipe that is good this time of year!
I substituted left over turkey for the tuna and used a green onion instead of a shallot as I am out of shallots.  As per my own preferance for chicken salads, I also added some powdered chipotle pepper.  YUM! This is a very adaptable recipe and I look forward to using some more left over turkey to make a new batch only this time with pecans instead of walnuts as I feel that pecans go better with turkey (and I love pecans!)

I was a little skeptical considering the ingredients, especially the mustard (have never used it in tuna salad!)but it so so delicious!  My husband really loves it.  Made it on large croissants with crisp lettuce and pepper jack cheese for our first boat fishing outing and they were wonderful!  Thanks Darra for a great, creative recipe.

This is the BEST tuna sandwich filling ever! The Granny Smith apple, shallot, and walnuts make this recipe special. I used a tablespoon of curry powder because its one of my favorite spices. It tastes even better the next day. Thanks Darra!

This was a nice change to the regular old tuna salad. It definitely needs a second can of tuna though. I used tuna packed in water and a little less curry because I normally don't like it and it turned out great. I did notice it didn't say whether or not to drain the tuna I did and I think it would have been to runny otherwise. Thanks for the great recipe to get us out of our sandwich rut.

I loved this recipe and will definitely make it again!  I made a few substitutions.  I hate mayo so I used low-fat plain yogurt instead. I used half of a small red onion because I didn't have any shallots. I also followed the recommendation of others who said to add two cans of tuna.  My tuna was canned in water so I drained them and then added nearly one tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil to the salad.  I served mine on whole-wheat wraps and they were incredible...better than you can get in a sandwich shop!

I work at a sandwich shop, already make great tuna, and  made this with poached chicken.  Made enough for 30 sandwiches, and we sold  out in less than two days.  Didn't add pickles or shallots, but used red onion, and the rest of the recipe.  Have to make more tomorrow.

When I first saw the ingredients, I thought this would be really gross, but with all the great reviews, I had to try it.  I am so glad I did!  It is wonderful!  I modified it some to be low fat.  Used fat free Miracle Whip, tuna packed in water, left out the shallot and the swiss cheese and served it on bread.  I will be making this A LOT!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

I thought this was an absolutely fabulous recipe. I loved the way that all the ingredients came together to create such a beautiful dish. The flavors all complimented each other quite well. Such a change of pace for something different. I loved this recipe just as it was. However, I may the next time use low fat, no fat ingredients for personal preference/reasons. Yummy way to fancy up tuna!

This is a refreshing change from regular tuna salad. To continue the Waldorf theme, I added 1/2 cup raisins and more walnuts. I cut the mustard by half and substituted brick for Swiss cheese to cater to my husband's tastes. To cut fat, I used water-packed tuna, used half mayo and half fat-free stuff and used soft sourdough rolls instead of croissants. Still quite good.

This was amazing.  I'm not a huge tuna fan, but I loved this--the curry really adds bite, but it's not too much.  Tastes almost like chicken salad.  Thanks for a tuna recipe I actually enjoy!

A nice change for tuna salad.  Really enjoyed the Granny Smith addition to the salad.  I used tuna in spring water rather than oil and omitted the sweet relish due to personal taste.  I used this in our lunches and served it on shredded lettuce rather than a croissant.  Next time I will use only enough mayonnaise to bind the ingredients.  A tuna salad recipe that I will be using again.

This makes a wonderful sandwich.  For us we use water pack white tuna and omit the relish but otherwise perfect.   Also good on homemade brown or flax bread or any type of wholewheat bread.    Thanks for the submission

Delicious and will make again. Although with saying this, I made quite a few of changes to lighten it up - because 52 grams of fat for one meal is horrifying! (target fat grams per day is 60!). 

I used tuna in water, miracle whip and put it on a whole-grain english muffin with light cheddar on top and made it as a melt instead. 

Will make again esp because I love the dijon and curry additions!

I made this for my husband who is trying to lose weight so I substituted low fat mayo and used water packed tuna and left out the relish (I didn't have any on hand)  He put it on Rye bread with low fat Jarlsberg cheese and it was great!

Maybe the best tuna salad I have ever tried.  I went with more tuna (three 2.6 oz pouches in sunflower oil) a little more celery/onion and a red delicious apple chopped.  The salad tasted so good that instead of a second sandwich I filled a bowl with the salad and ate it separately.  It went great with the sliced Swiss cheese on the side and then toasted bread with honey.

Very good thanks! I love tuna, but some can brands just don't taste as good. Mainly because they have an overpowering smell. So I would suggest you use for this salad your favorite can of tuna.

It was good tuna salad.  I didn't add a shallot, though, and I just adjusted the mayo/mustard/curry amounts to my own taste.  I would make this again but use mostly yogurt and little mayo to try to make it healthier.

I wanted to pack my boyfriend something different than his usual lunch sandwiches and this was just the ticket because I had apples and grapes that needed to be used up.  Ommitted the walnuts and curry powder.  Served with colby-jack cheese lettuce, tomoato and red onion on a bagel (just because that's what what I had on hand) and he really liked it.

I used 1/3 cup of mayonnaise, just a light dusting of curry, and solid packed tune in water. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and served it on home-made bread. Yum!

I followed the recipe exactly and I was not a fan.  Too sweet for my taste.  The idea of apples and nuts was good, it was the dijon and sweet pickle relish that ruined it for me.

We loved the great combination of flavors.  Since the broiler was hot from the toasting, I chose to assemble the sandwich and melt the cheese a tad under the broiler before placing the other croissant half on top.  I'm going to serve this as a luncheon sandwich for a ladies' bridge group.  Thanks for a very nice recipe!

The best tuna salad sammich I've had in a long time! This was so good. I really like the crunch this salad had.  I didn't have the relish. I didn't miss it. I will add it next time though to stay true to the recipe!  Thanks alot. This was so good.

People ALWAYS ask me for this recipe. To make it more Weight Watcher-friendly, I usually use half the mayo the recipe calls for and use 1 point wheat pocket pitas instead of the croissants.  I also omit the celery because I am allergic to the taste of it. I've also used shredded chicken in lieu of the tuna.   This one is ALWAYS a big hit at potlucks.

It was good, but I couldn't taste the tuna in it! So, it either needs more tuna, or less apples/nuts. The changes we made was to sautee the onions, because we prefer them that way, and to use a half mayo/half yoghurt mixture.

I just didn't care for this tuna salad.  Maybe it was the curry, maybe it was the shallots, or maybe it was just because it didn't taste like my mouth thinks tuna salad should taste.  I gave it a "3" because my husband said it was "pretty good."  Even at that, I ended up throwing some of it away.  Sorry, Darra.

I've made this so many time and am now finally writing a review. I love this salad! To make it healthier, I replace half of the mayo with plain yogurt. Because I like a crunch, I add more nuts. My favourite apple to use in this filling is Gala.

Very good. I have never even heard of this before, though my husband has. I was a bit leary of adding the apples but it was delicious. I think next time we might use a bit less apples and a bit more tuna, and maybe add some hard boiled eggs.

I served this tuna salad as part of a brunch with mini croissants and didn't make it as a sandwich.  Excellent flavor, everyone at the party raved over it. I don't have any alterations to this recipe except that I didn't eat it as a sandwich with the cheese on top.

This was great! My boyfriend LOVED it, and asked me to make a big batch for our camping trip next week. I ommited the celery (don't like it), but followed everything else exactly. This will become my new tuna recipe.

The curry flavor didn't come out as much as I was hoping but this was nonetheless a 5 star recipe.  I would probably add a dash more curry next time.  And it's true it's even great on crackers!  Great healthy lunch to look forward to at work.  Thanks!!

This was delicious, though I used canned chicken instead of tuna.  I doubled the recipe (but not the amount of mayo), substituted dried onion for the shallot and pecans for the walnuts, and ommited the celery.  I served it on Kaiser rolls instead of crossaints.  Next time, I'd probably put in more curry.  This is so easy to make and you can really put in whatever nuts and fruit/veggies you want and it is still great. The curry and mustard are what make it so flavorful.  The way we ate it, I can't believe the original recipe made four servings!

I made this for friends this weekend and everyone thought it was great!  I substituted poached chicken breasts for the tuna and used cashews for the walnuts.  I also skipped the relish.  I served this on rustic bread.  Thank you for the inspiration!

Okay I was hesitant since it is after all tuna salad, with or without great reviews.. but this was really good! It tasted completely different than the standard old tuna salad that I was SO VERY TIRED OF. I used regular white onion instead of a shallot and a mix of light and fat free mayo to reduce the fat. Even with those modifications it was still great, can't imagine how good the full fat version with the added croissant would taste. One thing I would do however (like those before me) is add the extra tuna. It was great without the addition but then you tend to have more stuff then tuna so I would use 9 oz. instead. Whatever your preference it's great either way!

My hubby and I loved this.  I don't do fish, so I subbed canned chicken for the tuna.  I also prefer pecans instead of walnuts, so I threw those in instead.  Will definitely make again.

Good recipe.  For variation, use a low fat mayo-type dressing, omit curry and add a dollop of mango chutney.  If you like poppy seeds add them.  Nix on the fatty croissant - pita or wholewheat bread is best.  I really enjoy reading reviews.  I decide on using a recipe based on users' comments.

Great tuna recipe!  I made the following changes...

7 oz. bag of albacore tuna instead of oil tuna, honey crisp apple, pecans instead of walnuts, 3 medjool dates, diced instead of sweet relish

Served open face on toasted whole wheat english muffin.  Garnished with 2 pecans halves.  Great served with a bowl of soup.

This was okay, but not as good as I expected it to be.  The kids and hubby would have rather had a good old tuna melt! Lots of chopping.

Should be named Infamous Tuna Waldorf Salad!! So good. The texture of the walnuts and celery complimented the sweet yet tartness of the apple. Adding curry was a great touch and the shallots in lieu of the normal chopped onion sold me! SUPER DUPER YUMMINESS!

This is actually pretty good! I omitted the currry, as I don't like it. It's a little heavy on the mayo - unless you like extremely juicy tuna. I thought more tuna & crainis would be good in it also. (Oh, I did't do the cheese & croissant thing.)

WOW-LOVE this recipe! I was so tired of the same ole same ole tuna salad and this was the answer I was looking for! As others mentioned, I used low fat Miracle Whip and water packed tuna. I don't like tuna or chicken salad with a lot of "sauce" so I used 12 oz of tuna. Served it on toasted buns but pita would also be good. Next time I'll probably double the curry, add a little more relish and substitute onion for the shallot. I am also excited to try it with chicken!  Wonderful! Can't wait to make it again.

Awesome! I'm not usually a huge fan of tuna, but this is a totally different way to eat tuna. Used Miracle Whip just to see how it worked, and I think it was nice with the sweet/tangy nature of the recipe. I'll add additional curry to my sandwiches, but fiance isn't much of a curry person. Maybe next time I'll add some halved grapes? I will make this again and again - thanks bunnybunny!

Delicious!  I made this exactly as written except I doubled the walnuts and it was probably the best tuna salad I've ever had. UPDATE:  I made this again but changed it a little bit because I wanted to use it as a filling for mini puff pastry shells. I omitted the celery and used pineapple instead of apple.  My appetizer got rave reviews!

This is outstanding!  I didn't have any shallots so I substituted scallions.  I went right to using chicken since I had several cans in the pantry.  So good!  Love the crunch and the flavor!  Thanks, Bunnybunny!  (Funny thing....we call one of our dogs Bunnybunny! Her name is actually Honey)

I only rated it a 4 because I didn't make it EXACTLY as written,I didn't have curry powder so I used some TOny's,I didn't have walnuts but I really didn't miss them with the apples,no celery but that's my preference and I didn't use croissants and oh yeah! I didn't use shallots,just plain old good onions and I didn't put it in a sandwich form,just got a fork and have at it! very good!

I found this recipe on here a few years ago and have been making it ever since.  I use canned chicken instead of the tuna, but everything else stays the same.  I have a camping trip with friends coming up and they called to make sure that I'm bringing my famous chicken salad as usual!  Thanks for such a great recipe!!!

Wow.  This was AMAZING.  This totally takes the heaviness out of tuna salad.  I love all the crunch and the juicy apples.  I used water-packed tuna and diced onions because that's what I had on hand.  I also added an extra can of tuna because I could.  Served it with Ritz crackers and it was soooo goooood.  A new summertime (or bi-weekly) favorite.  :)

I've made this several times now and the whole family just loves it.  I've tried it on cheese bread and croissants - delicious either way.  I double the recipe just so we can have leftovers!  Tuna sandwiches are no longer boring.  Thanks for a terrific and easy recipe!

I have made this twice now, 2nd time by mistake. Just to overwhelming with curry, that is all you can taste.

This was so delicious! The hint of curry is what I think really makes the sandwich. I used canned chicken (about twice the amount called for) instead of tuna but used the rest of the ingredients in the recipe, except the cheese. Served it with toasted pita pockets which I think really cut down on the fat grams. Thanks for such a great posting!

absolutely wonderful!  i will never make regular tuna salad again.  i didn't have all the ingredients and instead used water based tuna (2- 6oz cans), regular yellow mustard, red apple, no celery, and no nuts.  it was delicious anyway.  i can't wait to try it with the suggested ingredients.  yum!

Husband and I weren't real impressed with this recipe. It was kind of bland. I just didn't care for the taste of salad. I didn't use nut in the recipe because husband doesn't like them but I don't feel they would have helped. Just really didn't care for this recipe.

Wow, what a pleasant change. I really enjoyed this and so did my husband. I didn't have sweet relish, so I chopped up some dill pickles and used pecans instead of walnuts (its what I had on hand). What a yummy yummy sammitch.

Pretty tasty.  I think next time I won't use as much curry or mustard(just my preference).  Nice variation of regular old tuna salad!

This is such a fresh, and filling tuna sanwich filling. At first when I saw there were apples, and nuts in it I was skeptical, but it is so delicious! You have to try this! This will be on my menu during the warmer months, especially during Lent!!

Excellent!  I substituted 3 diced green onions for the shallot.  I also used light mayo to cut the fat a bit.  Next time, I am going to try canned chicken in place of the tuna.

Very good tuna salad!  I tend to half the apple, otherwise it starts to taste more like a fruit salad with a little tuna in it. I also leave out the curry and half the mayo. (That's more of a personal choice though.)

I've been using this recipe for 4 years now.  I hardly ever make tuna salad sandwiches any other way. Sometimes I add pecans or grapes for an added twist.  This week I plan on adding pasta to make a salad instead of a sandwich filling.  This is a great recipe, the curry adds a wonderful kick.

I served this to my mother and grandmother for mothers day.  They thought it was such a special treat, and it was!!  The apples, nuts, celery and curry are such a wonderful and interesting flavor.  I absolutely loved it, and so did my guests.  The sandwiches also looked beautiful piled high on a pretty platter.

This was very tasty.  Left out the nuts because of a guest with allergies, but will definitely add them in next time.  Used fontina cheese instead of the swiss which was a nice change.

Absolutely fantastic.  I'm NOT a fish fan but since I gave up meat for lent I've had to be creative.  Now I just wish I'd tried this recipe a lot earlier.  I cannot overstate how wonderful this is!

This was great! I used non-fat yoghurt instead of mayo and made it a very light salad. I also used baguette bread instead of croissant.

I had leftover turkey so I tried using it instead of the tuna- wonderful! I also added red grapes and left out the curry. It was so good I used it for a party as a salad, lining the bowl with lettuce leaves and there wasn't a drop left. Everyone wanted the recipe!

My boyfriend asks for more! I make this recipe once a week. I scale it to 8, and he's good for the rest of the week. I love it myself. It's great going from a regular tuna salad to a fast and tasty kick  tuna salad. Thank you!

I made this with Viennese bread instead of croissants. I didn't much care for the celery, but everything else worked well. Would be great for a summer picnic. Thanks, Darra!

I have to say I was not to fond of the taste when I first tried it.  After letting the filling sit in the fridge for a while it tasted better.  I added some sliced red grapes and spread it on a toasted whole wheat bagguette.  I didn't have any swiss cheese on hand so I sliced some sharp cheddar and it was great.  The flavors all blended well together.

This was great and my husband loved it!!!  I will definately make this again.  I used 4 cans of tuna in water, added a tbl of oil, doubled the mayo and mustard, and left out the curry.  I used the regular amount of remaining ingrediants.  I will try the curry next time.

Absolutely delicious!  I've made this twice and served it on Date Nut Raisin Bread.  I prefer using green onions in place of the shallot,  but excellent either way.

I love this recipe! The only change I made was toasted almonds in place of the walnuts. The croissant and cheese make it even better. Awesome for luncheons and I also make the recipe with chicken or turkey. Very, very good!

Taste good.  I had to use 2 cans of tuna since I couldn't taste any tuna using only 1 can.  My daughter wasn't too crazy about the walnuts but she likes the flavor of this dish.  Go easy on the curry because it can overpower the flavor.

Thats was amazing! Holy smoke. Here’s what I did. I was cooking other dishes for the week so I simmer a whole chicken and used the breasts from there. I toasted some almonds for the nuts. Everything else I followed. If I could do a ten star I would. I was really unsure how these ingredients would all work with each other and they do. I’ve eaten at the Waldorf and this is a take off of their signature salad. I’m not a sweet salad person so I’ve never had it. My husband saw this recipe and asked me to make this. I’m so happy I Did and it will now be on our six week meal rotation schedule. Thank you! ( also wonderful on crackers)

I've been using this recipe for my daughter's winter recitals for the past 4 years. Everyone who tries this recipe loves it. We use FRESH tuna. I have never used caned. We have made this with fresh albacore and fresh ahi tuna. Either type of tuna is good. I serve on white. 

We always make extra so we can have this at home as well. Anyone who tries this tuna salad loves it! Since the prep time for a large batch is considerably longer than recorded in the canned recipe, we save this for special occasions.

This was a very good recipe.  It was something different than your average tuna salad.  We enjoyed all the different textures with the apples, celery and chives.  The curry added a nice flavor.  Great with crackers, on a bed of lettuce or a sandwich.  My suggestion is prep everything in advance and toss it together.

The only seafood I eat is tuna and that is even questionable.  I love this recipe because it makes eating tuna delicious!  I used spicy brown mustard (didn't have dijon) and omitted the relish.  I disagree with others that there is too much curry or apple.  Maybe I would add more walnuts next time.  Will be making this again!

I loved this recipe.  I did make a few modifications:  I do not like raw celery, so I added some celery seed instead.  Also, I used pecans instead of walnuts because I like them better and because I had leftover pecans from the holidays.  I made a double-batch, using two cans of tuna fish and a good sized green apple and it was perfect.  This is great served on a hearty multi-grain bread with some leafs of Romaine lettuce.  Both of my kids loved it too, one sans lettuce of course.

I love it! Sweet, tangy and savory with plenty of crisp and crunch. All while staying fairly nutritious. I'm adopting this as a staple meal. Pairs great with jalapeno chips.

Agree with too much apple and not enough tuna.  Recommend 1/2 apple and double the tuna.  Extra seasoning for more kick.  More nuts good too!

I omitted the shallot, added another one tsp of sweet pickle relish, and used only 1/4 mayo....it was DELICIOUS! The curry powder adds just the right touch! I'll be making this a lot from now on!

I love this recipe. I used fuji applies because those are my preference over granny smith. And I left out the curry because I'm not a huge fan of it. Still turned out delicious! I ate it plain and as part of a sandwich with cucumbers. Next time I try this I want to try adding some mozzarella cheese as I hear that tastes really good paired with tuna.

3.5 stars.  I thought it tasted good, but not outstanding.  The fruit added a nice sweetness to the dish and the curry was not overpowering.  I'd make it again if I have all the ingredients on hand.

Used albacore tuna. Not really a tuna fan in our house. This was good though. I think I will use canned chicken next time though.

I just received an email from a friend telling me that she was "dreaming about" the tuna sandwiches I made for her the other day.  My kids decided that this recipe was a "keeper".  For those who care, the Tillamook brand of swiss cheese doesn't have any animal enzymes and the Maille brand of dijon mustard doesn't have any white wine. :)

I used 2 cans of water packed tuna fish with the called for amount of mayo and cut the apple amount down to 1/4 instead of a whole. I do not eat tuna fish myself but my husband and his friend said it was the best tuna fish sandwich they ever had. thanks so much!

My Nana LOVED this recipe!  One of her favourite sandwich fillings!  I like to snack on a bit of this on whole wheat or rice crackers.  Also yummy on celery.  Thanks for posting this, BUNNYBUNNY.

This is SOOOO delicious, even when you forget some of the ingredients (relish, walnuts).  I was so hungry, and it looked so good as it was.  I spread it on toasted english muffin halves,(also didn't put cheese or lettuce on it.)

A nice alternative to the standard tuna salad sandwich.
