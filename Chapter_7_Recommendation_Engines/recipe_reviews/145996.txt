Do you place the sugar/vinegar mixture in with the cucumbers before freezing or drain it?

Growing up this is how my mom would fix the cukes but she would add sliced onion and green pepper. It is good and refreshing. I also add the onion and green pepper.

These cucumbers were a bit too sweet for me, but my family loves them, especially my husband.  I did substitute Agave, for the sugar, as we can not eat refined sugar.  They were easy to make and came out great.  Thanks for a neat way to use up some of the abundance of garden cucumbers.

This recipe is for freezer pickles, not for use in salads or other dishes that call for fresh cucumbers.  Per another poster's suggestion, I cut the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup and these turned out great!  I was confused about whether or not to drain the liquid before freezing, since the instructions are vague, but based on what I read on another site, I discovered that the liquid should be frozen along with the cucumbers.  I froze the cucumbers in small batches, so that I could defrost a small amount when needed for snacking or adding to burgers.

No thank you. I followed the recipe. I just thought they were too sweet. I don't call it a total waste. But it was an extensive wait for uninspiring results. I will search for a better recipe.

You just mix it after it has soaked in vinegar & sugar, The I take handful & put in freezer bags to lay flat. Then discard the rest of vinegar mixture that is left.
