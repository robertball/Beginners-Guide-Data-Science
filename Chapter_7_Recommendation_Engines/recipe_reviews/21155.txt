Definitely quick and definitely simple - a classic combination for a great side dish. Not to mention it's  a great way to camouflage a healthy veggie in case you have picky eaters in your house! I used a steam in bag of broccoli and whether you use velvetta or another of your favorite cheeses this stuff is great!

I used a 14oz bag of baby flowerets. Only used 1 1/2 T. butter & asiago instead of cheddar. My family LOVED it!!! Great for low carb. I also just cooked it per directions on bag using microwave, then did the seasoning thing. Thanks!

This wasn't very good with the cheddar. I think I will stick with velveeta..

I like this recipe because it does NOT use Velveeta, which is  "processed" and questionable. I used fresh broccoli, sharp cheddar, and 2 Tblsps butter. I microwaved the fresh broccoli florets (2 Tblsps water, cover microwave dish)  for 90 seconds, drained water, poured melted butter over broccoli, then topped with cheese. Recovered dish and microwaved for about 45 seconds. Done! Very fresh taste.

This recipe was good in theory but it was just basically melted shredded cheese on broccoli, and not anything like the frozen ones. I tried this because I was tired of spending 2.50 for a lil package of frozen stuff.

***
Melt a small amount of milk with the butter and seasoning, then add the cheese and stir. This will make it the more creamy sauce if you are looking for something similar to the green giant variety. It also looks better and works for any kind of cheese.

Melted cheese on top of broccoli wasn't going to cut it for us, so I quickly whipped up a cheese sauce which then made this dish more to our liking. Thanks for a good start tho!

i really liked that this used cheddar cheese instead of velveeta since i dont keep velveeta on hand very often and its super expensive. i used extra sharp cheddar cheese and i did make a slight change i steamed my broccoli and then melted the butter with a quarter cup of half n half and added the cheese slowly to make a creamy sauce. very good.

Got what I was looking for.  Simple, easy and quick.  Less than ten minutes.
Used steam in a bag broccoli and cooked it less than called for by 1 and 1/2 minutes.  Lightly seasoned with sea salt and black pepper and a little bit of lemon juice.  Then, topped with the cheese.  No complaints!!

This was alright. I used a mexican cheese combo instaed of just cheddar. The cheese isnt very cheesy when it is melted. I think next time I am  going to use less butter because the broccoli just sits in it. My daughter who is queen of picky loved it. Thanks

thank you - this was exactly what I was looking for!  I needed to 'dress up' the broccoli just a tad but I was not wanting the whole 'broccoli/cheese casarole' thing.  Just perfect, my family loved it.  Thanks for posting.

I always use Velveeta instead. Shredded Cheddar would not result in a very desirable consistency. No butter, just a little milk or half and half and fresh broccoli.  Want your kids to scarf down broccoli without being prodded?  Use this recipe -  my kids almost begged for it growing up!

This was okay but would be alot better with a few changes. First, I used microwaved frozen broccoli steamed in the bag. be sure to drain all moisture, even letting it sit on a paper towel for a minute would work. Then follow recipe and add extra cheese until it is to your liking. If you don't drain well, you will end up with a watery mess.

Easy, and yes, simple and quick.  I'm not a fan of cooking in the microwave--nothing against this recipe, as I know it's a great way to cook certain things--I just dislike it.  So I did everything except steam the broccoli in the microwave.  I melted some butter, tossed it with cheese, broccoli, salt and pepper, then baked covered at 350 for 30 minutes, and it turned out perfectly.  It isn't much, true, but that's what I was looking for.  I didn't want to use Velveeta since I didn't have any, and I don't have sour cream or anything else to use either.  This worked well and we had it for lunch with some baked ziti.  Thanks for the recipe!

Similar to other viewers, I agree that this recipe is better with processed cheese like Velveeta! Also I often make this with frozen broccoli and it still comes out great. Thanks for the quicky recipe.

My mom has made broccoli and cheese this way my whole life. I like it, but I don't love it. It just isn't quite as cheesy. I prefer to make a cheese sauce myself out of cheese, milk and butter for a really good broccoli and cheese. If I'm just throwing together something quick to eat with a weeknight dinner, I cut Velveeta into cubes and toss it in with the broccoli after I've drained it, then put the lid on and put it on the burner on "Warm", stir it up, then serve. Even though the cheese is processed and some people don't like that, I definitely think it's a better way than this method.

I really like broccoli and cheese.  I find it better to use velveeta for the cheese.  Also, if you want to make this into a more stuffing meal/side dish mix in cooked white rice.  That's how I used to eat it as a kid and I still do =D

This was really good to be so simple! I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen. Although I prefer a true cheese sauce, I won't hesitate to make this again.

Quick and tasty! I admit that I did use Velveeta, but just because I needed to use it up. I also omitted the butter, I didn't think it was necessary. I know, I changed the whole thing but this is a good base recipe. Thanks :)

I made this at my son's request. This was easy, but needed a little help. I used American/Cheddar-Jack blend and added some cubed Velveeta as well because it needed more cheese and wasn't creamy enough for us. I cooked mine on the stove according to pkg directions and then drained off the water and added the cheese and melted it on low heat. My son loved this dish!

It's not good on it's own but it's a nice base to start off of making a great cheddar sauce.  I did the butter then added half a block of cream cheese, 3/4 ths a block of cheddar then added heavy whipping cream as needed to get the right consistency.  Was delicious.

This is especially good with sharp white cheddar! Adds another level of complexity to the flavor.

It's quick and easy and tastes great! I'm new at learning how to cook Broccoli and Cheese so it was good for me! My family loved it :)

I gave this four stars because it's just so quick and easy. Definitely not the most decadent broccoli with cheese I've had or even that I've ever made, but it's simplicity means I can whip it up anytime.

This was good and very quick. I added a little velveeta because I had some to use up. The velveeta made it very creamy, so I do recommend adding it. It was perfect for taking a side dish to someone else's house because you just have to heat it up in the microwave.

Used a frozen broccoli/cauliflower mix that steamed in the bag, then just sprinkled shredded cheddar over the top and microwaved it for a minute. Fantastic way to incorporate veggies into the dinner!

This was okay.  There wasn't a bit left.  I think my family would have enjoyed it more if I had used velveta cheese rather than the cheddar.

This is good but ithink i prefer my milk based cheese cream sauce better.  I would make this again though when i am in a hurry as my kids love cheese and brocolli.

I just made this as a potato topping.  It turned out great!  For two smallish heads of broccoli I added a little water to the bowl (2 tbsp), microwaved on high 90 secs, drained, added the 1 tbsp melted butter, cheese, plus salt/pepper/garlic powder and about 2 tbsp of sour cream (Mexican style) before topping with the cheese and microwaving for another 45 seconds.  Came out super creamy and pretty much perfect!

Make it with whole organic milk and fresh steamed broccoli and it will take this dish to a another level.  My guests were  practically fighting for the leftovers.

What a fantastic dish!  The entire family really enjoyed this recipe.   There were requests for seconds!  I believe you should follow the recipe exactly the first time that you make the dish.  Thereafter, you can make you changes.  Don’t forget once you make changes you are no longer making the dish that you selected.  Instead you are making your version.  I cannot wait to make this dish again for the family.

Don't expect this  to come put looking  like the photo.  There is no sauce in this recipe and the photo definitely shows a sauce.  This recipe produces steamed broccoli with a little melted cheese on top.  As soon as the broccoli starts to cool, the cheese gums up.  It was not good.

This dish is ver easy and simple! Delicious I must add??I did mine a little different....after steaming the broand melting the butter. I poured my broccoli ?? into the skillet and stirred until the butter was covering the broccoli ?? I then used velveeta cheddar cheese ?? it’s very tasty ?? didn’t need to add any salt nor pepper...the butter and cheese ?? had enough sodium as it is??love it and will be making this a whole lot??????????

My mother made this for us kids back in the 60's with frozen broccoli & Velveeta but there were not all the cheese choices back then that we have today. Velveeta is not allowed in this house but I agree cheddar would not be my choice for this recipe. I made this last week  but  used American cheese from the deli. So many think Velveeta is American cheese but it is not. Velveeta is processed cheese. It isn't even refrigerated in the markets.

Love this one.  So easy and quick.  Although, I gotta say that unless you add something to it, the cheese is not going to end up as creamy as in the picture (perhaps if you sub velveeta?).  But honestly, it doesn't need to be creamy.  It was still good!

This was great and so simple.  Instead of microwaving the broccoli, I added the cheese into the pot I used for steaming (after draining the water of course). Within 3 minutes my broccoli was nice and creamy as the cheese and the butter blended nicely.  Thank you for the recipe,  one of my favorites :)

I used this recipe for more ideas and guidelines. I bought a 12 oz bag of broccoli florets that I could just steam in the bag (SO much easier, and only a few cents more). I melted the butter and tossed the cooked broccoli with it. I did not want to spend the $ on velveeta because I would only use a little for this & the rest would sit in my fridge. I always have kraft american slices, so i melted 5 slices on top & mixed it together with a little pepper (no need for salt because its in the butter & cheese already). I started out with 2 slices then had to keep adding more til I got to 5 to get the right amount of cheese. I agree with some other reviewers that cheddar just doesn't sound like it would taste as good as processed cheese. We enjoyed it very much!

This was pretty good.  I used fresh broccoli and covered it on med-hi heat for about 10 minutes to get it kinda mushy before I drained it...I have never really liked them to be crunchy.  Very simple but good recipe.

First off, we really don't like frozen broccoli. Second, a creamy cheese sauce would have been much better for this. It's a little yucky with just plain, melted cheese. Sorry, really not impressed :(

Very good.  Used frozen broccoli and realized while it was in the micro that the only cheese I had was laughing cow low-fat swiss.  Added 3 wedges during the last minute.  Worked great and perfect for low-carb diet.

This was simply broccoli with cheese melted on top.  It was okay, but not a spectaular recipe.  I steamed and drained fresh broccoli and then microwaved with the cheese.  As other reviewers recommended, I would leave the butter out as it just made a large soupy mess in the bottom of the bowl.
