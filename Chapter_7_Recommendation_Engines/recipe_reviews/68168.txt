Yum! I like using oats in cookies and squares, and these were great! I omitted the nuts (didn't have any), but otherwise pretty much followed the recipe. I have made two batches, and both turned out well. I used foil to line the pan (makes for easy removal of squares), but remember to grease/spray the foil! Otherwise, as in my second batch, the squares will REALLY stick to the foil. Also, I didn't bother melting the chocolate chips separately: I sprinkled them on the top of the squares when there was two or three minutes left in the baking time and then smoothed the chocolate evenly with a knife. Stick them in the fridge awhile, cut, eat! Delicious! Thanks, Josh!

I really enjoyed these but hubby wasn't too fussy on them (thought they tasted like they weren't cooked enough).  I used butter, not oil, and omitted the nuts.  Placed greased tinfoil in my pan and that made a world of difference.  Before they finished cooking I sprinkled some chocolate chips on top and stuck it back in the oven.  When the timer went off I used a butter knife to spread the chocolate out.  Threw the whole pan in the freezer for an hour.  Took them out and used a greased, sharp knife to cut into bars and then threw them back in the freezer.  I'm leaving them in there and just grabbing one out when I want it.

I LOVE toffee.  I have made at least 5 different toffee recipes.  This was not among my favorites.   I love oatmeal too, so I thought this recipe had potential.  Sadly, to me it just came out too chewy and did not have the toffee flavor I sought.

As written, 4 stars. With these changes, five:  1) I used 1/3 cup melted butter instead of oil 2) I lined my pan w/ foil sprayed w/ nonstick spray 3) Used closer to 3/4 cup milk chocolate chips and added a few splashes of milk to them after melting and then stirred. Made a delicious icing that wasn't too sweet! 4) Put pan in freezer for 30 min after baking for 14 minutes instead of 12 5) Used pecans instead of walnuts  Thanks so much! GREAT base recipe!

Chewy throughout with a thin "syrup glaze" on the bottom. It is sticky and chewy like a soft toffee should be. Finely chopped walnuts add that extra flavor to the dessert. [My review is on the Highland Toffee recipe made with salted butter (or original I Can't Believe It's Not Butter) and without the 1/2 tsp salt. The butter, as opposed to the oil, gives the dessert an authentic toffee flavor.]

These are very good and not as sweet as I thought they would be after reading other reviews here.  I only changed a couple of things:  I baked the bottom a couple minutes longer than directed and did not cool it, but rather sprinkled the cup of semisweet chips over the top and put them back into the oven (turned off) for 2 more minutes; I then spread the softened chips over the top using an offset spatula and sprinkled chopped walnuts over the top.  I let it cool to almost room temperature and then put it in the fridge for a couple of hours before cutting.  After going around the edges with a sharp thin knife, I had no trouble whatsoever removing the whole thing from the pan and cutting it into squares and then triangles on a cutting board.  I would suggest storing them in the refrigerator, especially in warm weather.

Yum!  I definitely suggest refrigerating these over night before eating them..they taste sooo much better the next day.  The only change that I made to the recipe was to sub melted butter for the 1/3 c vegetable oil.  Deeee-lish! :~)

Fantastic recipe! Every time I make it I get many compliments and people asking for the recipe. I use a glass pan (very generously greased) and follow the recipe exactly (except the nuts), put the pan in the fridge until the chocolate is very hard, then cut it up and move to a plate, and stick it back in the fridge. Definitely one of my favorites : )

It took me a while to warm up to this recipe. I had no idea if it was done when I took it out of the oven and after it had come to room temperature, it was still falling apart and messy. However, I put it in the fridge until the chocolate set really well then pulled the entire bar out (I tin-foiled the pan and buttered the tin-foil) and cut it while it was still solid. After a night at room temp. these bars are wonderfully chewy and absolutely beautiful! Next time I need a sweet for a party, this will be the recipe I use.

I had high expectations after reading other reviews, but was pretty dissappointed in these.  They were very crumbly and sticky on the bottom, after cutting them apart.  I think that boiling the wet ingred on the stove and then addding the oats would be a better method to get everything to stay together.  These were pretty good tasting, just not something i would make again.

This was a good dessert recipe, easy and quick to make, but it is REALLY sweet and can be difficult to get out of the pan.  I did make a couple changes to it though.  I used butter instead of oil, and I did not put any nuts in it, and I put it in the freezer for about mins before I took it out of the pan, it made my job easier! But it was good just the same and all of my guests really liked it.  It added some needed variety to my holiday treat pan.

Very tasty but almost impossible to remove from the pan.  My sister and I broke them into chunks and dipped them in chocolate to make them tastier and prettier!

So easy and SO GOOD! My 2 and a half year old son was just dying to try it, so when i cut it into the 4 squares I cut off little bits for us to taste. We ended up eating a whole quarter of it still warm and crumbly with no chocolate or anything! It is pretty sweet, so I decided to use semi-sweet chips over milk chocolate and will def add finely chopped walnuts for a more authentic and complex flavor.   This is so quick and easy, and I always have all of the ingredients on-hand. I plan on making it when I have only short notice for visitors coming over as a welcoming treat. Haha.. people will think I am a doting hostess, but it will be a good excuse to make these quick delicious bars. Awesome recipe and thanks so much fo posting this keeper. :)

Okay, these are delicious! I did make a few changes according to what I had on hand (take note that I am making these in the middle of the night to satisfy a sugar craving).

I didn't have quick-cooking oats, I only had the old-fashioned kind and I was afraid these would not soften enough during baking. Instead, I used individual instant oatmeal servings, I had golden honey flavour. 4 pouches = 2 cups.

Since I didn't have corn syrup, I replaced it with molasses. The final taste is very similar to my mother's puffed wheat recipe.

I baked it in a 9" pie pan because I didn't have a square one and after the recommended 12 minutes, I pulled it out of the oven and cooled. The preparation had candied around the edges but the center remained too soft.

I cut it into squares, prying the edges from the pan and baked another 5 minutes. This did NOT work. The batter just spread out some more, although it did candy. I spooned it out of the pan right after removing it from the oven because I was afraid that after it had cooled, it would be un-removable, which ultimately resembled a big glob of toffee. It tasted good just the same.

Next time, I will try crumbling up the batter onto a lined cookie sheet and bake this way so it is evenly candied. Like that, I will have oat clusters instead of squares. I assume these will be great finger food or added to yogurt.

I also lower sugar for my next batch  AND use plain oats because these results were much too sweet.

I didn't bother adding the c

These were yummy. I made them with butter, and then to combat the stickiness, I flipped them over (the bottoms were the sticky part) and put the chocolate on that way :)  Refridgerate it and then spray your knife with a cooking spray and it'll cut up easily.  Also, I cooked 2 batches, 1 with salt (and salted butter) and 1 without the salt (still using salted butter) and the one without the salt was much better. So I'd omit that from the recipe as well :)

Yummy! Like other reviewers i sprinkled the chocolate chips on for the last few minutes of baking.  I think I needed to bake mine longer, necause the middle ones were pretty chewy and coming apart, but the oustide ones stayed together well.  I lined the pan with greased foil and had no trouble getting them out.

It was really good,but I made a few changes.
Changes are:
2 teaspoon vanilla instead of 1 1/2
1/2 cup corn syrup instead of 1/4

You can also use white chocolate,
nuts can go into the batter.

You can crumble the final product after freezing it for Scottish granola

The squares were sticky and hard to get out of the pan and the chocolate topping didn't stick very well to the oatmeal bottom.  That said, it was pretty tasty.
