Well, it's simple.  And it's garlicky. I decided to try it, just because I knew it could just become a starter if it was horrid. I HATE to give a bad review, but, Sorry, but it was.  i ended up throwing the whole thing out, it was so greasy: calls for about 12x as much Olive oil as is needed to saute the garlic, in fact I usually just use non stick cooking spray and add a bit of good olive oil directly into the sauce. It was bland, watery, and...I don't even know.  NOT spaghetti sauce!

It turned out very well.  Next time I plan on sauteing garlic with the onions and beef.  I also added a can of tomato sauce to the recipe.

The sauce was missing something and there was no indication of how much water to add.  It did not turn out very well.  I also think it needed a tomato paste or sauce added in addition to the crushed tomatos.

I added a large can of tomato sauce and halved the oil; This came out perfectly thick, creamy, and herbalicious.

I made this sauce to use on chicken parmesan and boy was it dissapointing.  I tried it becuase my family loves garlic, but this just tasted like tomatoes and garlic mixed together.  I will have to keep looking and reccomend you do as well.

This recipie was not what I was expecting.  It tasted closer to a marinara sauce, yet bland.  I think it needs something in it to bring out more of a tomato taste.  I do love marinara sauce, but not with my lasagna or spaghetti sauce.  However, it wasn't the watery or oily nightmare that some reviewers stated.  I followed as written and it thickened up just fine.  I also found that it thickened a little more when I let it sit overnight in the fridge and reheated the next day.  So all and all the consistency was perfect for my taste.

Great base recipe. But instead of water try putting 1/4 cup vodka, brings out the taste. I personally used a special vodka with a red tint called vampire vodka, gave it a beautiful red color.

Changes I made! I always half the recipe since there are only 4 of us and there are always leftovers....If in the mood I will add ground beef but I always leave out the water, add one can of tomato paste, a can of diced tomatoes rather than crushed and I add a couple tablespoons of white cooking wine. I eyeball italian seasoning and sometimes add fresh or dehydrated onions depending on what I have on hand. I still add extra parsley and salt and pepper, usually I skip the basil...And of course I don't cook it for two hours...that's just ridiculous! It's really sooo good!

I liked it... I added some parsley, oregano,onion powder, garlic salt, and a dash of store bought Italian seasoning, with a pound of beef and a pound of mild Italian sausage links....put it over spaghetti noodles, and topped it with mozzarella cheese.. my children loved it...
