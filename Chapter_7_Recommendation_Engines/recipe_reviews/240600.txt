I didn't have a microwave safe tube pan, so I used a pie plate with mini ramekin.  The cook time was more than 3 minutes.  I followed the instructions completely before cutting into it and the dough on the bottom was completely raw.  I nuked it for an additional 3 minutes and allowed to rest again.  They were done.  Texture wise it was not the same as baking...which gives a bit more of a crunch.  I could see that you could easily OVER microwave these, and then end up with a solid brick....watch your timing!

This recipe has a unique way of being a cook but surprisingly it tasted delicious. We also liked how easy it was to cook.

I have made this many times with less sugar and my family just loves it -- they eat it up like popcorn!

This is my recipe.  I posted it here at the request of my middle school students.  This is one of the recipes I used to introduce cooking and it was well loved by thousands of students in my classroom.  Cooking time can vary based on your microwave wattage.  Our classroom models were all 1000 watts or higher.  if yours is lower it may take longer to cook.  The outside edges should look done and the center slightly moist.  Make sure you are using a shallow dish or silicone tube pan as suggested for good results.  Happy Cooking!

Wow... I loved it!  Followed recipe exactly but doubled it using 16.3 oz Grands southern home style and cut each portion into eighths.  Added 2 minutes to cook time.  Added apples. Mmmmm...turned out amazing.  I'm going to play with the recipe to try to lighten it up from fat and sugar.
