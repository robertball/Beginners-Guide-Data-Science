Not nearly as good as it sounded.  But for something quick and easy it isn't bad.  Think the 'sauce' needs a thickener.  Going to try using gingersnaps next time and see if that adds a bit more tang.  Also going to cut down the cook time as it was over done and dry.

Very easy and very tasty. I may try bold BBQ sauce in place to the ketchup next time for more tang and a little less sweet.

Super easy to follow, using just a few ingredients that I typically have on hand.  My husband really liked it.
I would recommend a slightly shorter bake time, depending on the thickness of your chops, and you may want to keep it under the broiled for a few minutes at the end.

Nothing special here, ok meal.  Cook time is a little excessive.
