These cookies turned out great! They were easy to make. Two suggestions I have are 1) make sure your cream cheese is relatively small (the 1/4 inch is perfect), and 2) keep the dough refrigerated while baking. I was very happy with how these turned out and will make them again.

Oh my God! Get my cheesecake fix in just a bite. Worth the time making them and freezing so available anytime. I used gluten free flour instead. Highly recommended!

Very nice recipe.  Have everything ready so when frozen creme cheese cubes go in,  cookies immediately go in oven.  Easy and very tasty.

This is a light little cheesecake in a bite.  Easy & delicious. Followed the recipe as written. Different from the usual fare, it will be fun to share with friends.

These cookies are awesome!!  Everyone who tasted them kept sneaking more.  One cookie aficionado said it was the best cookie he ever tasted.  I will definitely make them again!
