These cookies are great!! I kept the recpie the same except for a few things. I added 2 tablesspoons of vanilla and added an additional 1/2 cup of brown sugar. They are sticky when they are batter which makes transition to the cookie sheet a little difficult. These are thin and crispy and my picky husband only raved about them! Def a keeper. thanks again

These turned out great!  At first the batter was very thin and made really spread out thin cookies..still yummy.  Then, after it sat for a bit, it thickened up a lot and was more like regular cookie dough.  I baked them for 14 minutes and skipped the walnuts.

I always do all of the baking for Passover but this year, I had to have my nieces cook everything (except the brisket).  They baked these cookies and if I could have given the recipe 20 stars, I would have.  They did not use the nuts and used half white and half brown sugar.  Fabulous.  I came home and made the recipe with the nuts but used half white and half brown sugar too.  I put the batter into the fridge for about an hour and then used a scoop to portion out.  They were thick & soft.  It turned out an A + keeper.  Thank you so much for this easy to prepare recipe.

Even my husband loved these. I modified this recipe adding 1/2 tsp Vanilla and used 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Dough was runny, so I put in the fridge for 15 mins to firm up. As good as a Passover cookie gets!

Super Easy & delicious! I used white chocolate chips which worked great. I meant to follow suggestion of 1/4 brown sugar but forgot until I could only do 1/4 - still a great idea and next time will be even better. Would barely know they are for Passover.
