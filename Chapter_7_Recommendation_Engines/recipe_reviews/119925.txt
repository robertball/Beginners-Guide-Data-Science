I just finished eating two slices of this bread, and I'm somewhat disappointed. First, unlike that awesome picture the recipe gives us of the bread, my bread didn't rise like that one! Maybe I should have doubled it? And as other reviewers said, 55MINS is TOO MUCH. It would burn the bread. I baked it for 45MINS and it burned the bottom a bit. Can you imagine how burned it would have been if I had left it for 55-60MINS? YIKES! Despite the negative, I liked the taste of the bread. The glaze is good on top of it. The bread wasn't dry, but wasn't moist either. It was more in the middle, if that makes any sense haha. I think this bread has potential, so that's why I give it 3 stars. Overall, it was an OK bread.

I'd give this 4 1/2 stars - Mine was done - slightly overdone, actually, at 45 minutes!  I do tend to eyeball some spices, so I'm going to say I probably doubled them here.  I also used half whole wheat flour, half regular, and a really good quality dark amber honey - the stuff I normally wouldn't buy, but someone gave it to me.  It has a very subtle spicey/honey flavor, and I think it's a delicious bread!  Perfect for a "tea party".  I particularly like the idea of dissolving the sugar in warm (skim) milk - might try that technique in some of my other recipes in place of creaming butter/shortening & sugar.  Great way to cut to cut down on fat! ***Update 2/18/08:  Even better the next day!  A tad dry, but I think I should have stored it in the refigerator.  Honey flavor really comes out the next day!  Delicious!

excellent!!! I sprinkled chopped almonds on top because I like nuts in bread and it was very delicious! the bread is quite pretty after you get the glaze drizzled over the top. I will definitely make this again and again!!!

I made this with an alternate glaze:

4 Ounces cream cheese
1/3 cup powdered sugar
1 tsp. Vanilla (to taste)
 and 2 to 3 Tbsp. Milk

Whip the cream cheese then mix in the powdered sugar until smooth. Add Vanilla (to taste) and add milk to reach desired consistency.

The bread was tasty. I didn't have nutmeg so I simply doubled the cinnamon. WOuld like to try it with nutmeg. The bread itself was not as sweet as I had expected. Would be good with pecans.

There is no way that this bread could take 55-60min to bake! Mine was done in about 45min, it was ok tasting,nothing really spectacular...

Too dry and not very flavorful, even though I used rounded half teaspoons of the spices.

A little cumbersome to make.  The top and inside of the bread are sweet but tasty.  The sides and bottom have a funny burnt sugar taste no matter how lightly cooked.

Yum, this bread is GOOD! So moist, so flavorful. It's not overly sweet, so it works for breakfast. This is a great recipe and I plan to use it often in the future.
