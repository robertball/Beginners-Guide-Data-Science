Awesome! I substituted turkey for ham. I also added some onion powder that had parsley and green onions mixed in. I used Hawaiian Rolls and added horseradish to the butter glaze. Following another member's advice, I sliced off the tops of the rolls all at once, added the filling, then I replaced the top. After the glazing and baking process, I separated the sandwiches with a serrated knife. This method is faster and easier than trying to cut, stuff, and glaze two dozen tiny sandwiches. I also used a silicone pastry brush to apply the butter mixture.

These were sooo good.  Everyone at our  housewarming party loved them.  The only thing I'd do different next time is put the butter mixture inside the rolls because a lot of it rolled right off the rolls onto the baking sheet so it got wasted.  Delish recipe!

These are very yummy.  I used sliced ham and swiss and I use frozen (pre-cooked) rolls in a throw away pan.  You can just slice them open and insert the ham and cheese and put them back into the pan before drizzling the butter mixture.  This way, you won't lose any of the butter mixtue.
These are great for parties.

These sandwiches are wonderful! I get many requests for this recipe. Try them with mini potato rolls for a more richer sandwich.

These were so delicious that my boyfriend begs me to make them again and again. You wouldn't think from the ingredients that they'd be this spectacular, but something about the mustard and onion and butter just makes the whole thing come together. Try these once and you'll be hooked.  Also, I followed the recipe to a "T" and I have to say I wouldn't change a thing.

If you want a warm sandwich for a change, try this one!  We really liked them.  I didn't use small dinner rolls.  I used 4 Sara Lee Bakery Buns (large), layered ham, turkey, and provolone.  I made the full recipe of the drizzling sauce and slathered the bun tops and baked on foil lined baking sheet for about 20 minutes.  If I would have been able to find the Kings Hawaiin buns, I would have, but I'm glad I used the Sara Lee buns.  I think the Hawaiin buns would have been "too much".  I loved the toasted flavor of the bun.  Thanks for a good alternative sandwich recipe!

These were pretty much what I expected from reading the recipe.  I made them for my Bridesmaid's Luncheon and I think they went over pretty well.  Nobody complained, but nobody praised them either.  I used sweet Hawaiian rolls and sliced Boar's Head ham.  I took others' advice and used less butter for the sauce.  I used a dijon mustard.  I really liked the little pieces of minced onion.  I used a pastry brush to spread the butter mixture on both sides of the roll and then on top of it as well, and that worked out very well.  I would say that the sauce was not quite spicy enough for my taste.  Next time I may find a spicier mustard or add a little horseradish to it.  These would be perfect for on-the-go food, like lunch to have in the car while you're traveling.  Just put a bunch of them in some plastic baggies.  I have a feeling men would really like these, too.  Simple, but flavorful and hearty.  Overall, a pretty good recipe.

Well I made these for a gathering once and one girl liked them so much that she now makes them for all of our church functions - I feel that now I can't make them because that has become *her*  recipe.  They are delicious and huge hit, never any left.

I had to leave off one star because this version of the recipe leaves off two key things. First, you have to add brown sugar to the drizzled mixture, and second, after drizzling you cover these and put them in the fridge overnight. The "sauce" soaks in so that when you bake them the next day, the buns are carmelized with the mixture. It's amazing!

LOVE these! I'm only giving 4 stars because I do them slightly differently - but they are ALWAYS gobbled up. Use the little dinner rolls you find in the regular bread section of the grocery - not the larger ones, the ones in the throw-away rectangular pan where the rolls are only about 1x2 inches - three rows of about 8 or 10 rolls. Remove from pan still connected and slice across the whole thing horizontally. Put the bottom half back in the pan. Brush part of the butter mixture on inside - bottom and top. Add your ham & cheese (easier if you chop it all up first) then replace the top half. Pour/brush the rest of the butter mixture on top. Cover with foil & bake 20 minutes. Let rest at least 5-10 minutes before cutting between the rolls. You'll NEVER have left overs, so I advise doubling your recipe!

Fantastic Recipe with slight changes. Line pan w/foil. Use Hawaiin Rolls - without separating into individual rolls, cut top off of dinner rolls. Heat in sauce pan for 2 mins: 1/2 c butter, 1/3 c brown sugar, 2 TBS worcestershire sauce, 2 TBS dijon mustard, 2 TBS poppy seeds, 2 tsp minced onion (optional). Layer ham & cheese over bread bottom.  Spread 1/3 of heated butter mixture over ham & cheese then replace bread top and pour remaining butter mixture over top of rolls. Bake for 20 mins.

These are the best!!  I love them.  I didn't use poppy seeds, only because I didn't have any.  And I used American cheese, because that was all I had.  I couldn't believe how amazing they were...  I am going to be making these again and again!

Excellent!  I halved the recipe, added 2 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar and one tsp worcestershire sauce based on other similar recipes.  Not sure if that made a difference, but it sure was good!  I'll make them the same way next time and there will be a next time!  Also, I didn't weigh the ham or cheese, but just added what I thought looked like a good amount.

This is an old 1960's recipe that my Mother started making for her card club back in the day. Our family grew up on this and is still a favorite today. The only thing that I do differently is I just soften the butter instead of melting it so it spreads on each bun easier and I like to spread some inside each bun for extra flavor. Great recipe!

So good!  I spread the dressing on the bottom of the rolls instead of drizzling on top.  I had bought two packages of 24-count rolls thinking they were 12-count, but there was plenty of meat, cheese, and dressing both trays.  Instead of making each sandwich individually, I inverted the tray, sliced the whole block in half, spread on the dressing, layered ham and cheese, put the top back on, then popped the whole block back in the tray for baking.  So simple!!

I made these for a family lunch we had (about 10 ppl) and everyone LOVED them. I did add garlic powder and onion powder. I brushed the insides with the sauce and made some with provalone and some with swiss. Also 12 with regular rolls and some with hawaiian rolls. I also ended up making an extra batch of the mixture to brush on the top. I made them the night before and cooked them at my grandmas house when I got there.

I've been making these for years and love them!  I don't mind the onion but most of the time I leave it out - some people are finicky about onions and these rolls are still delicious without them.  I wrap them individually in foil before baking so the rolls don't dry out.  Also, I find that these freeze well so you might find it worth it to whip up a big batch, bake them then freeze them so you can grab one or two for a fast breakfast on the go.  They reheat well and pretty quickly in the microwave (remember to remove the foil before microwaving).

Meh, this was okay but I wouldn't fix it again this way. Neither one of us was impressed. I didn't like the stuff on top at all and ended up scraping it off. I fixed a sandwich similar to this before that we loved only the spread was inside. Sadly, this wasn't even comparable in our book.

These are good and easy to make. I used slightly larger potato rolls and a little extra mustard. I did find them a little too greasy with the butter. I made them for dinner but I think they would be better for a party snack. My husband is eating the leftovers for breakfast, though.

Love Love Love these.  Made them for dinner to try out something different.  Hit with everyone.  The sauce did seem a bit heavy on the poppy seeds, but that's only a preference.  I was so happy to have leftovers!  I brought two rolls to work the next day and microwaved them.  They were so good!  Need to put this on the menu rotation- easy and delicious!  (oh and I used shredded swiss instead of sliced).

I made these with mesquite turkey breast and Lorraine Swiss, both thinly sliced.  Used King's wheat rolls and Dijon mustard and only 1 tablespoon of poppy seeds.  Brushed half the butter mixture inside the rolls and drizzled the remainder over the top.  Refrigerated until guests arrived and all of the butter mixture had been absorbed by the rolls by the time they went into the oven.  I did make individual sandwiches and baked them in a 9 x 13 Pyrex.  They were OK with soup and salad and people seemed to like them.

I've made these for over 20 years & am frequently asked to make for bridal/baby showers.  However, I use 1 Tbsp. worcestershire mixed with sauce ingredients.  I brush it on the cut sides of rolls as well as the top of rolls.

These were a big hit at a party with salads and sandwiches.  I made the sandwiches the night before and wrapped them in a double layer of heavy-duty aluminum foil.  I mixed together the butter mixture and poured it over the sandwiches right before baking, using less butter and real minced onion.  I baked them right in the aluminum foil on a baking sheet.  They were gone before I knew it and there was no clean up to speak of!  I will make these again!

These were easy and delicious. I only used 1 tablespoon of poppy seeds and brushed the butter mixture on with a pasty brush. Well received at a baby shower.

Excellent idea and very versatile! Can't wait to have them again...the poppy seeds really add a neat crunch *and* flavor for me. I, like many, used Hawaiian sweet rolls.

These were a hit at our holiday party!  I left out the poppy seeds, and followed other suggestions to cut all the rolls in half at once while they are still attached and then separate with a spatula later.  Good tip.  Will definitely use this again.

Quick, easy & delicious.  I've been making this recipe for several years.  You can prepare them a day or two ahead of time & wrap them in aluminum foil until needed - just add a few minutes to the baking time.  I've found that Pepperidge Farms petite dinner rolls work best with these.  I usually spread half the mixture on top of the cheese & the other half on top of the rolls.

Very good. I've made these a few times now. Turkey works well too if you want a variety. The first time with the butter mixture on the top of bun. Too greasy to hold onto. This last time I buttered the inside only and that worked better but I only did one side of the bun. Next time: try butter mixture on both insides of the buns. Made with 7 layer salad for a nice make ahead dinner. 6 of these are good for the 2 of us with a hearty side for dinner.

A nifty way to use up some leftover ham.  The rolls get crispy and I enjoyed the addition of the poppy seeds.

These were pretty good. The bun reminded me of the onion roll at Arbys with a sandwich. I made a 1/2 recipe and used mini potato rolls and left out the poppy seeds because I don't care for them. After they were in the oven I realized I missed the part on adding mustard. I used butter instead of margarine and ham, turkey, and white American, which was what I had in the house. Next time I might try them exactly to see if there is any significant difference in taste. Either way, easy sandwich to make and nice break from a cold sandwich. Thanks.

Fantastic - good way to use up leftover holiday ham - I put everything in the food processor as another reviewer suggested - they were eaten up as fast as they came out of the oven.

I had these at a babyshower, and searched for the recipe...so glad I found it. Who would've thought a little ham and cheese sandwich could be so good.  I brush on the sauce instead of drizzling...keeping the seeds separate for sprinkling...just ensures even coverage. I have made different ways when I am missing ingredients...without the onion, or using regular mustard...still scrumptious!

These were really good. As mentioned by other reviewers, you can really use any cheese/meat combo you like. We used ham/cheddar and ham/havarti and both were great. This is a nice change from an everyday sandwich and very easy and simple to make.

I didn't care for these at all.  I am a sandwhich lover, but these did nothing for me.  Hubby said they were just ok.  Daughter liked them, son did not.  All in all, not worth the trouble.  I would rather just put the meat and cheese on the roll and toast for a few minutes.

I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 because I followed others' suggestions to brush the butter mixture on top & bottom cut sides of the rolls, as well as brushing plain melted butter on the tops & sprinkling with poppy seeds just before baking. I used the Hawaiian sweet rolls, again following others' suggestion to cut the whole package in half and separate after baking. I made half with ham & Swiss and half with chicken & provolone. I used a ham steak and rotisserie chicken which I chopped in the blender. Using chopped meat, as called for in the recipe, eliminates the worry of whole pieces of ham coming out when eating.  The tops of the first batch were a little too brown for my liking. I kept a close eye on subsequent batches as they baked and laid a loose piece of foil over the top for the last 5 -7 minutes to keep them from browning too much. They were a huge success at my small group meeting with several people asking for the recipe.

I got this recipe from my sister!  We love it.  They are easy to prepare and taste great!  We brushed the "dressing" on the meat and cheese layer and then put the roll tops on and brushed the rest of the dressing on top!  YUM

I made this recipe for a family birthday party and everyone loved them.  We made pastrami and pepperjack and ham and swiss sandwiches.  The bottoms and tops were deliciously crunchy.  This is a simple recipe with big taste.  The results are much more impressive than the actual amount of work you put into them.

My mother used to make a simpler version of this for us when we were kids, they were a big! treat. (We called them "yummy yummy sandwiches") I suggest using a long bread knife and cutting as many of the rolls in half as possible, and breaking them apart after. I would have forgotten about them unless seeing them on this site; thank you!

I grew up with my Mom making this recipe and it is a great recipe for a quick dinner.  We melt the butter, mustard, and poppy seeds and spread on the inside of the bun. We use cheddar cheese, but choose something to your taste.  Wrap in foil and bake in the oven. Easily freezable and make a quick meal at a later date.

I made these sandwiches this past weekend.  My husband really loved them.  They were very easy to make.  I used the small frozen yeast rolls that come in a foil pan.  I also was out of minced onion so I used a little onion powder instead.  I am planning to make this weekend for a tailgate!

Wow... these are GREAT!  Such a simple recipe but the melted butter mixture really makes the sandwiches special.  I made these for tailgating & was told I must bring them to every tailgate now.  I loved the previous suggestion of cutting the individual dinner rolls after "stuffing" them instead of making individual sandwiches.  I omitted the poppy seeds (personal preference) & brushed the melted butter mixture on the inside of the sandwiches.  Since I did not brush the outsides of the rolls, I reduced the cooking time to 15 minutes so they wouldn't dry out.  Thank you for a super simple wonderful recipe!

love this recipe!! as already suggested, I cut the rolls all at once, the butter/poppy mixture should go inside the sandwich, this way the cheese melts in and the mixture gets good an gooey. I use fresh minced onion. The best part is that these rolls can be made, wrapped frozen and baked and be availiable anytime...

These are so good. I made only half of butter sauce, used sesame seeds instead of poppy seeds, spread regular butter and dijon horseredisch mustard onto each bun, then top with cheese and ham and pour butter sauce on top. Worked out great. Update: Made them again with provologne and full amount of butter topping. Was so goooood.

I have this same recipe only it calls for real chopped onions instead of onion flakes, and the butter mixture is put on top of the ham and cheese before the tops of the rolls are added.  It is delicious!!!

This was a nice staple for a buffet lunch.  I used ref. flaky biscuits.  I though there were a bit too many poppy seeds.  I didn't receive too many comments either way.

These are always a hit at potlucks, and as appetizers--just cut the sandwiches into fourths. Keeper!

These are really good and so easy.  I would only bake them 15-18 minutes though as I found them to be a bit overdone for my tastes.  The DH loved them.  Served with sweet potato fries.  Yum!

When you feed these to hungry college kids, they just fly off the table.  I made these using mini Hawaiian rolls and Swiss cheese, cheddar cheese and gouda cheese.  All tasted very well, but the gouda cheese did not melt like the other 2 varieties.  The 3 we had leftover heated up nicely for DH lunch the next day.  I served these with 3 different soups.  I appreciate that these can be made early in the day, covered, refrigerated, and baked later in the day.

A delicious little ham and cheese sandwich. I spread a thin layer of sweet hot mustard on the inside of the King's Hawaiian Rolls and used only 1 1/2 T. poppy seeds.

I have been making these for years.  Doesn't sound like much, but they are so good. The measurements I use a just a little different.  1T of onion flakes, 1T poppy seeds, 1T mustard and 1T of worchestershire. They reheat really well too. My husband actually prefers them leftover.

These were very popular at a recent open house buffett, especially with kids. You can probably fill it with anything but don't skip the poppy seed drizzle - it's tasty and makes the sandwich look great!

This recipe creates mouth watering chicken ham bun. Cheese flavoured chicken ham was used as filling. To make the dough softer, I added some mashed potatoes into the dough. This additional ingredient will enhance savoury flavour in this bun and make the bun taste creamier! I baked the bun with  oval pie tin , therefore it create distinctively oval shape, which is something you can’t get else.

These are a favorite at our house! We make them all the time! I use Hawaiian sweet rolls and don't cut sandwhiches apart until after baking. Put butter sauce on inside to make less messy and cover with foil while baking. YUM!!!!

I didn't have any minced onion so I used fresh garlic and forgot the mustard. I also used 3/4 stick of butter and did half the sandwiches with hot pepper jack cheese and the other half swiss. They turned out great!

I have made these for years and they are always a hit.  I actually make them with full-sized buns and pour the sauce over the mixture of chipped chopped ham (torn apart) and shredded swiss (or any mixture of other cheeses).  I fill each bun with a big spoonful of the mixture and then wrap each sandwich in foil and bake for about 20 minutes.  If you want to bake these ahead of time and keep them warm, they stay warm in a cooler for hours.  I use this for backyard picnic parties a lot.  It's so much less work than grilling out and then everyone can enjoy the party, including the hubby who doesn't have to man the grill.

I've been making these for years and someone always asks for the recipe!  Minor changes:  brush inside of rolls with worcestershire sauce, add ham (thin sliced deli ham, chopped) and provolone and then add most of mustard mixture to the inside - reserving just enough to brush tops of assembled sandwiches.  I also slice entire top of rolls prior to making to save time.  I bake them, covered with foil, for 15 minutes, remove them from oven and let sit, covered, for another 15-20 minutes.  Delish!

I've made these on several occasions and can never make enough. I never have leftovers. I do make some slight revisions. Firstly, I use Hawaiian rolls. I've found that the poppy seed mixture can be used for 48 rolls. I slice the rolls in half sideways, add 8 thinly sliced pieces of ham (4 stacked), and use 6 pieces of provolone (for every 12 rolls). I then brush the poppy seed mixture on top of the cheese, instead of over the top (that seems messy and wasteful). Just before I put them in the oven I brush a bit of plain, melted butter over the top of the rolls. Viola! Wonderful.

These little sammies are fantastic!  I think they are by far the best when made with the King's Hawaiian slightly sweet rolls.  I do as others have mentioned and just slice the tops off the whole pack of rolls, build my sammies, put the top back on, wrap in foil and bake.  After they come out of the oven, I pull them apart.  I've always had this recipe with the poppy seed mixture INSIDE the sammies and I think it's much tastier than putting it on top.  I do brush the tops of the rolls with melted butter after they come out of the oven as I thinks that adds just that extra bit of flavor.  I gave this recipe 4 stars since they want you to put the mixture on top and you miss all the flavor that way.  No matter how you decide to make them, try these out because you will LOVE them and everyone will rave!

I have made these several times... but I don't think I've made the same recipe twice!  I have tried this recipe using various meats and cheeses, but what makes the recipe is the buttery topping.  (I did omit the poppy seeds.)

I originally had these at a friend's house. I have made these numerous times for parties. Everyone raves about them and there are never any leftovers. I rarely use poppy seeds because I often forget to buy them. Now I add about 1 Tbsp of honey (or less) when I melt the butter. Of the 24 rolls, I make 12 with ham and swiss and 12 with sliced turkey and provolone.  They fit nicely on a cookie sheet in the fridge until ready to bake.  Just be sure to add the sauce on top right before baking.

I made these as part of my Superbowl spread yesterday and they were an absolute hit!  Omitted the poppy seeds, used 1/4 cup melted butter and 1/4 cup olive oil and - everyone said this was the key here - subbed King's Hawaiian rolls for regular dinner rolls.  Outstanding. I may half the recipe and make these for dinner some time, they'd be perfect with tomato soup for an easy weeknight dinner.

I have been making these sandwiches for years - we call them "tailgate" sandwiches! Everyone asks for them. A few changes - I use brown mustard, a little butter, fresh minced onion, teaspoon of worcestershire sauce and poppy seeds for the sauce.  We wrap them in foil and load them up in a low heat grill, a roaster or in the oven and let cook until the cheese is hot and bubbly.  They are perfect for parties!

We took the ingedients to make these with us a couple of Thanksgivings ago to enjoy during our mini cabin vacation. They were easy to make, delicious and one of the favorite meals my kids remember to this day. Delicious!

I have this same exact recipe except I don't melt the butter mixture.  I spread it on the inside of the roll.  We also wrap each one in foil to bake them.  Also we make them ahead of time and freeze them, so they are great for a quick sandwich.  Just take out of freezer and pop into toaster oven.  YUMMY.

These were delicious. I made them for a get together with both kids and adults- and they were perfect. If you live in the south and have access to Sister Shubert rolls- they made these sandwiches SO GOOD!

OMG, these sandwiches are sooo good! They are requested on a weekly basis by my husband. Sometimes I make them using american cheese and turkey, it doesn't really matter...they always turn out yummy. One thing I would recommend though is to use the King's Hawaiian sweet rolls, they're the best!

I made these exactly as described and they are wonderful! Such an awesome way to use extra ham without making the same old soup! They were kind of messy though and my DH wasn't too excited about grabbing the rolls with the greasy top and wanted me to figure out a way to put the same flavor Inside instead of on top! LOL Make sure to get the King's Hawaiian rolls at the store because they are SO soft and moist and won't get hard when you bake them!

I loved this recipe with some tweaking. I used roast beef instead of ham and Hawaiian Rolls. I also used italian seasoning in the butter sauce rather than poppy seeds. They turned out wonderful. It was a lot like the bread I get at Subway.

These were delicious!  I actually used most of the butter mixture on the inside of the rolls and then just brushed the small amount left on the tops.  So I didn't have problems with the bread getting soggy or the butter dripping off and making a mess; instead it got too crispy and hard after sitting out for a bit.  So, just need to keep them warm to serve and they are perfect!

Made these for the big football game (don't know if you can use the super-word or not) and they were gobbled right up!  I made per instructions, no alterations at all.  Thank you for this easy, interesting, and delicious recipe!

My Fiance' and I really liked the idea of thses, but had to modify them to our likings. I used Sweet  dinner rolls, no poppy seads but garlic powder mixed with butter on top and we  also used some with turkey.  Provolone cheese seems to be the best on these. Great for those don't feel like cooking much nights.    Would give it 5 stars but I modified it so much it is seems barley the same.

Made these for a Superbowl party with the round potato dinner rolls and combos of turkey, ham, swiss and mozzarella.  Everyone loved them and they sure were easy to make.

These were a big hit on New Year's Eve! I used Boars Head ham and turkey, and swiss and provolone cheese. I made different combinations of the meat and cheese. I added more butter as another reviewer suggested. I prefer Dijon mustard, so I used a little of that  mixed with regular yellow mustard. I also used the King's Hawaiian rolls. I and my guests liked the sweetness, but hubby didn't. Next time I will make some with regular dinner rolls as well. Thanks for the great and EASY recipe!

Made these for my Bunco group and they went over well - I made plenty of the butter mixture w/ yellow mustard, poppy seeds and the chopped onion.  I used dinner rolls and baked in a foil lined 9x13 glass dish, which made for easier transport & serving.  My husband just had to eat one before he left, and I think only 3 were left over by time I got home. Not bad considering there were 6 other dishes and only 12 of us!

I made these ham and cheese rolls for a party at work and they were a hit!  I used everything the recipe called for except for the onions and they were great!  I used the dinner rolls that came in the throw away pan and I baked them directly in it to save the butter mixture.  If you are looking for a great finger food definately try this recipe!

A Freakin MAZING! The first time I made this I doubled the sauce and it was 'a bit much' lol This time I followed the exact ingredients (leaving out the poppy seeds) and it was amazing! Perfect blend of everything! We never have leftovers! Some tips I took from others and a few from myself:
1. Use HONEY MUSTARD (I use Kens Steakhouse brand) so good!
2. Make sure you chop up the ham it does make a difference
3. Make REALLY SURE you don't fix this then throw in oven. You HAVE to let it sit in fridge at LEAST 6 hours/I prefer overnight but today 6 hours was all I had :)
4. I use honey ham lunch meat, Swiss cheese slices cut into 4, and Kings Hawaiian rolls for the bread :) so good!

Yes, however, I made it with deli roast beef, made the garlic butter II (on this site).  Added horseradish, used salted butter since it didn't elaborate which type.  Omitted salt...used provolone and finished off with arugula after cooking.  Like the idea of cutting whole section and spreading mixture.  Easy once I set up an assembly line...LOL.

Loved it, so easy to make (did do the whole pack at one time as suggested by many) used the Hawaiian rolls and they were a huge hit - I did not add the onion this time because of folks are allerigic and didn't use the seeds because those with false treet have a problem with them.  This will become a go to, and will also try with both turkey and or beef.

I make these all the time.  But aren't those sesame seeds instead of poppy seeds in the picture.  In fact,  I. Use sesame seed because the black poppy seeds get in your teeth.     : ).    

I, also, spread on inside of bun and outside and wrap in foil.    (Individually)

Sooo easy, and soooo very yummy! The first thing the boys said...with full mouthes, was you HAVE to make this again. I used Hawaiian rolls, and did a mix of ham, salami, Sandwich pepperoni, and different cheeses, they loved all of them. Will Definatly make this again

These are a staple at our house.  I make these sandwiches all the time.  I often use turkey instead of ham, and mozzarella or provolone in place of swiss.  But, everything else is the same.  You can't go wrong with these!

I made these sandwiches today for my family's lunch and cut the recipe in half. I think the poppy seed mixture would have been better spread on the sandwiches as was too thick to drizzle. The end result was pretty good, but nothing spectacular.

Made these for the super bowl, and they were wonderful!  But they were the best leftover!  Trying it either the original way (drizzling butter mix over), or using suggestion to put butter mix inside, or both--they are really yummy.  I don't like chopped ham, so I used regular ham from the deli, and a quarter slice of swiss per roll.

This recipe is a winner! When I've made them, I've had to double/triple the recipe because I knew people would eat more than one.

I use potato rolls & shaved cooked ham.

Served this appetizer at our 2011 Kentucky Derby Party and boy oh boy, these were a hit!  
I did modify the recipe.  Instead of cutting the rolls individually, I popped rolls out of pan, cut the rolls horizontally and placed the top layer of the rolls to the side.  Layered the deli ham and cheese slices on the bottom layer of rolls.  Placed the top back on the rolls.  I then covered the rolls and placed in the frig.  Made the butter mixture and put in frig.  The next day I pulled the ham and cheese rolls and the butter mixture out of the frig and followed the recipe.

I did use a pan cake turner to cut the rolls into individual servings.  These were easy to make for a crowd and would be good for a brunch.

I use King's Hawaiian Rolls and fresh green onion instead of dried minced onion (am going to try the dried next time though!).  I wait and cut the sandwiches into squares after baking them - very easy!  Also, these freeze wonderfully in foil.

This basic recipe is also good if the chopped ham is sauteed in the butter along with the onions before adding the mustard, poppy seeds and also a dash or two of worchestershire sauce, then the cheese.  Sister Shubert's Parker House rolls are the best to use with this.  Slice the rolls, put the mixture on top and then bake.  Delish!!

This was so good!  I used Hawaiian rolls. Cut the ham into 2 pieces and used one of the 1/2 slices on each roll.   Split the cheese in half too!  I used others advice and put the mustard/butter mixture on the inside of the roll and topped each one with a small dab of melted butter.  They turned out great!  Will definitely make again.

These were a huge hit at the bridal shower I hosted.  Next time I will brush on the mustard/butter mixture and sprinkle on the poppy seeds and minced onion so that I can better control the quantity as the poppy seeds were a little overpowering.  I used Hawaiian rolls and sliced the entire package in half then folded one slice of ham per roll and topped with 1/2 a slice of cheese.  After the sandwiches baked I pulled them apart and arranged them on a platter.

Love these!!!  I made up the rolls a day ahead -- stuffed ham & swiss cheese in each roll and placed them in a pyrex baking pan w/ lid.  Slid these into fridge.   Before the pot luck  - I mixed and added the butter mixture -- then baked and put the dish into my thermal case which kept everything nice and warm.  Everyone loved them!!!  After reading a previous review  -- I brushed on the butter mixture w/ a pastry brush - I liked the results better.

These were yummy! I scaled the recipe down to just make a few for lunch for me and the little guy. Mine baked in only 10 minutes, but my oven is known to be super hot. I used King's Hawaiian mini rolls. Little man ate all of his, and some of mine too, so that makes them a definate keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

WOW!  The hit of the party!  I followed the directions exactly and they turned out great.  The topping on these take a plain ol' ham and cheese and turn it into something extraordinary.  I will make these again.  One of my friends does not like ham or mustard and was eating these, so that definitely says alot for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing :)

Sorry but this sandwich just wasn't for me. I made with turkey breast instead of ham and used whole wheat buns. I also put the butter mixture inside of the buns instead of outside.

I served this at a party and it was such a hit! I didn't even include the minced onion or poppyseeds because I didn't have them. Instead I spread the dijon mustard on the top side of the buns and the butter right on top. Definitely take the tip on cutting all the buns in half instead of trying to assemble individual sandwiches.

Sure enough, what everyone says is true.  I took these to a fellowship at church and was asked several times for the recipe.  Men like these a lot!

These were quick and yummy. I made some changes only based on what I had. I had half a loaf of french bread that I wanted to use up so I cut it into "roll-sized" portions. I also used pepperjack instead of provolone. Since I didn't have any poppy seeds, I decided to just spread the mustard/butter mixture on the inside of the sandwich instead of on the top. I'll definitely make this again...and I'll try it with the rolls, swiss and poppy seeds next time! :)

made these just as stated but did make 12 with ham and 12 with turkey.  I sliced the tops of rolls off like others suggested, to make them all at once, much easier that doing them individually.  Also I put each batch (12 rolls) in an 8x8 pan to bake, and this kept the topping from sliding off.  They were a hit, from my 2 year old to my grandparents!

These were really good!  They'd be great for a party.  Mine turned out a tad messy on your hands.  Next time I may try less minced onion and butter.  But, overall, delicious!

These are some of my favorites. I use a package of Hawaiian Bread rolls. I love to heat them up for lunch. They seem "fancy" but taste so wonderful.

Yummy!I used what I had on hand, here it goes: I used GFS frozen dinner rolls (they are a bit sweet), no poppy seeds, white American cheese,brown sugar ham,& honey mustard. I put the mixture on the inside of the rolls (vs. the top), and wrapped each in their own foil. I'm sure you can alter this one in many ways. Thank you for the great recipe!

Without any variations, these sandwiches are amazing.  With your own personal touch I'm sure they're even better, although I like them as is.  I made them for a New Year's Eve party and they were gone in minutes.  Fantastic recipe, thank you for sharing!

I use deli sliced turkey & provolone cheese and put them on Hawaiian rolls.  I made them for a shower & they were a huge hit! They are also my husbands favorite.  He asks me to make them for every food day at his work  :)  Thanks for sharing!

I can't even tell you how GOOD these are!  I made half of the recipe because there was only 3 of us and I ended up wishing that I had made the whole recipe.  I only baked mine 10 min and they were done - maybe 12 min would have been even better.  I accidentally bought sesame seeds instead of poppy and that was a good substitution.  I also added in half a tsp of garlic powder (use a whole tsp for the whole recipe) and that added even more flavor.  Thanks so much for the recipe - this will be come a family favorite!

I have been making somthing similar to  these for years and they are always a big hit - even with those who aren't crazy about ham and swiss!  My recipe varies by  adding 1 or 2 teasp. of Worchestershire sauce and NOT melting the butter.  Simply soften it and then mix all the other ingredients (except ham, cheese, rolls).  Slice the top of the party roll loaf, spread the softenend butter mixture on both of the cut sides of the rolls, layer ham, cheese, ham and put the top back on the loaf.  These can also be baked in foil if you want a softer roll.  Yummy with any kind of deli meat/cheese.

I've gotta give these 5 stars, although mine turned out deserving less than that. My fault completely, I lost track of time and burned the rolls to a crisp on the bottom. However, I tasted the top/filling and ohhhhh they were delicious! I loved the flavor that the butter/mustard combo made. I didn't use minced onion as my fiancee HATES onion, but I did sprinkle some onion powder in there (sssshhh). I made 12 ham and swiss and 12 turkey and swiss. Very, very good. I ended up throwing most of them out because they were so burnt, but I will be making them again very soon.

These were a huge hit at a birthday party recently. My husband asked if I would start making these for football games. Very easy recipe, I had children attending and made a few sandwiches with American cheese for a more kid pleasing flavor.

I'm rating this 3 stars because hardly anyone touched them at the BBQ even though they looked quite yummy.  I had tons of leftovers.  I thought they were ok, not great.  I did expect a little more after reading the reviews.  I used fresh grated onion and hawaiian sweet rolls and other than that I followed the recipe as written.  As much as I love those rolls, I think the sweetness took away from the taste of the meat and cheese.  I added a few slices of turkey pepperoni to the leftover sandwiches and froze them and surprisingly the next day after reheating them, they taster much better.  The kids enjoyed these sandwiches (with and without the turkey pepperoni) but I won't make them for a crowd again.

Great recipe!  Either I didn't use enough of the topping or the recipe makes way too much!  I used ham and turkey and baby swiss on dinner rolls from a bakery.  I followed other reviewer's suggestions and cut the rolls together then cut them apart after baking.  They were much better than I had hoped they would be.  Definitely a keeper!

Simple and they taste great.  They freeze well, also.  I add on 10 extra minutes baking time when they are frozen.  As other reviewers suggested, I put the butter mixture on the inside of the rolls.

Absolutely delicious and fun!  If you want to make it a bit less messy, just spread the sauce on the inside of the bread rather than drizzling over the top.

This was really good!  I made them for a poker night we had at our house, and everyone raved on and on.  I did make a few changes I use honey wheat hawaian bread, honey dijon mustard, mont. jack cheese, and honey baked ham.  Other than that it was AWESOME.

Yum, these are tasty! I used sesame seeds in place of the poppy seeds since that's what I had on hand. Instead of drizzling the mixture on top of the rolls, I brushed it on using a pastry brush, which helped cover everything evenly. Thanks for the recipe.

I have to admitt I was a little skeptical about the butter and mustard, but these were the hit of the football party. The flavors once baked were awesome together. I used fresh onion and omitted the poppy seeds. I did half cheddar and half swiss and the swiss are by far the best!

Okay- these are good-BUT I screwed up the first time by listening to the reviewers advice about putting some of the sauce on the inside as well, instead of just doing it as the recipe said.  It was much better the second time when I only put the sauce on the top. When you add it inside too you get an overwhelming onion taste.  I used Sara Lee brown and serve dinner rolls and sliced deli ham with swiss.  Very good.  My 6 year old even liked them and she normally hates "white cheese"!  Good appetizer

Great recipe when you need something fast but a TV dinner won't do!  I bought seasame dinner rolls from costco since i didn't have any poppy seeds.  The first time i made them was with the butter mixture poured on top and the second time i made them was with the mixture poured in the sandwich.  I enjoyed the first batch best because it made the sandwich nice and soft.  The other way the bread was hard and dry.

I thought these were pretty good, but I served them at bunko, and people raved.  The recipe doesn't sound like much (toasted ham and cheese - that's a recipe?!?) but these go on my list of go-to appetizers.

Made these for a baby shower and they turned out wonderful!   I made a few modifications as recommeneded by others.  I only used 1T of poppy seeds and used dijon mustard and put some of the mixture inside and some on top.  These were quickly gobbled up!  You want to serve these warm...the longer they sit out the harder they get.

these got lots of comments at a church gathering and from my husband who ate 4 of them! I used most of the sauce inside of the roles and a little on the outside with a brush, I used 1 TB of sesame seeds instead of poppy seeds. I brought Walmart roles which came in a 24 pack which had a little bit of a sweet taste to them. I will be cooking them agian soon! Thanks

Used turkey instead of ham. These were very good - the sauce is wonderful. I actually put a 1/2 teaspoon of sauce inside the roll before cooking along with some on top. Make sure you serve and eat within 1 hour - they tend to dry out after that.

These were really good.  I bought the ingredients for a housewarming party, but didn't have time to make them with all the other food I prepared.  I made them last night since I had everything and WOW! these were good!  My daughter and husband ate them up.  They liked them so much I made them again tonight.  Thanks so much, this will be a favorite when people come to lunch.

Really good and such a quick dinner for a weekday or Sat. night. My kids 2 and 3 ate one each. Husband loved it and is still gobbling them down. I used honey dijon mustard and I put in almost half of the poppy seeds. Its a keeper!

Very good. I didn't add the poppy seeds and only used a dozen rolls. The whole family gave them thumbs up. Served with deviled eggs and baked beans. Thanks for the keeper.

Oh, what a fabulous recipe! I was a bit scepticle about all of the mustard since my children hate mustard, but it was wonderful and added nice backround flavor! The kids loved them! I made some with american cheese for them and they were just as good! I took other's advice and doubled the recipe...I'm glad I did! I won't double the drizzling mix part next time though, I ended up wasting a lot. Thanks for the fantastic recipe! So much more potential too!

Picture a tall, muscular Navy vet/college student jumping around the kitchen proclaiming, "Oh my God, these are SOOO good!" and you'll know how great these are.  I used wheat dinner rolls from the deli and packed the sandwiches really close on the baking sheet. Fantastic.

Thank you for this wonderful sandwich!!!

The perfect way to use up the leftover Hawaiian rolls from a potluck! Did not have poppy seeds or swiss cheese. I used American cheese and deli-sliced ham, split the sheet of rolls in half, put a little of the butter/mustard mixture on the insides of the rolls, lined it with ham and cheese, put the tops back on the rolls, put the rest of the butter mixture on the tops and put them in the oven. They came out great!

I made this twice. The first time I didn't quite like it so I changed the bread to Ciabatta and I changed the mustard to Honey Mustard and I think it turned out much better. I also used Brie cheese instead of the cheese this recipe called for. I made everything else the same. My family seemed to enjoy it better the second time.

Big hit.  But I left them in the oven a little too long which dried them out and they hardened quickly when they cooled off.
Still yummy

I took it for a pot luck at work and several people really liked it but I thought it was just edible. . I used the Hawaiian rolls but didn’t have the poppy seeds. not sure what it was but something just didn’t work for me.

My son loves these sandwiches, the butter topping and melted cheese really make it! To change things up I make a Reuben version as well with Thousand Island dressing, sauerkraut, corned beef and Swiss cheese. I halve the recipe as our rolls come in 12 packs.

I host a ladies group once a  year; we always have heavy appetizers and this was a HUGE hit!  The only changes I made was instead of poppy seeds, I used sesame, because I already had them.   I also don't care for Swiss cheese, so I changed it to Muenster cheese.  I will definitely be making these again! Thanks!

Substituted fine chopped onions, stoneground mustard and butter rather than dehydrated onions, prepared mustard and margarine. Didn’t “drizzle” more like just sat...didn’t think substitutes like that would be that big of a deal..

These little sandwiches are so awesome! I made them for my husband and I just to try them out to see if I could serve them at an informal gathering. I'm making them again tomorrow for a crowd of about 12. I didn't change anything the first time, but I might use sesame seeds next time because the poppy seeds tend to get stuck in my teeth. Either way, they're fantastic!

These went over very well at my little luncheon.  Made a small batch and used part cheddar and part swiss for the cheese. Had some leftover and put them in the freezer. 
Will definitely make again when I have a larger crowd.

There wasn't quite enough ham and a little too much cheese, but they still turned out great!  I put them on King's Hawaiian Rolls rather than plain dinner rolls.  My family devoured them, these are very addictive sandwiches. Make more than one batch if you want leftovers because these were gone in a flash.

I made two versions of this - one with ham as called for, and another with roast beef and cheddar cheese. I left out the poppy seeds from both because I don't care for them. I flash froze both batches and vacuum sealed for a no fuss meal later that will just need to to be pulled from the freezer and baked.

These sliders, also known as Funeral Sandwiches, are the epitome of bomb.com. These disappear every time I make them! The rolls can be hard to find but I found similar buns at Metro but only one  store seems to carry them.  Tried with turkey too but not nearly as good .  I bake these til the topping hardens just a bit and makes the bun a bit crunchy. Winner!!!

thanks for the great hints!   I used most of them!  will be serving for the game next week.
Used butter instead of margarine
Used Dijon instead of regular mustard
Used Hawaiian rolls, slitting into tops/bottoms without separating into individual rolls first.
Chopped the ham and shredded the cheese
Spread the butter mixture on the bottom rolls before adding the ham and cheese, spread more on the top after assembly.

Baked in foil (will spray with Pam first  next time)

Served with creamed horseradish sauce on the side for those who like more of a 'kick'

These were a hit at our New Year's Eve party.  I would probably add some mustard to the inside of the sandwich next time.

One thing I will do different is the next time I will put the butter mixture inside the rolls because a lot of it rolled right off the rolls onto the baking sheet so it got wasted. Delish recipe!

I've made these little gems many times & they're always a hit! I always decrease the amount of butter. Well, tonight, my husband asked for these & I had ham & Swiss & some pretzel rolls I'd picked up. I was out of the poppy seeds I normally add so added some sesame seeds. They were the best batch yet! Hubs is still thanking me for these!!

I love this recipe!!!  I used turkey and ham and also put butter mixture inside the rolls and on top and used provoloneccheese and Swis . But Instead of dried minced onion I used fresh onions and it came out PERFECTLY!!  I only put them in the oven 10 minutes and I'm glad I did because they would have burned if I put them in 20 minutes but absolutely yummy oh and I used dijorn mustard instead of regular I just like dijon better

Really, really good. I used slider buns from the bakery (because I needed something a little larger)and made 1/2 with provolone & 1/2 with swiss. Couldn't really tell a difference unless you were looking for it. I also added 2 tbsp brown sugar...which is HIGHLY recommend. This was delicious!!

Made these for a hockey playoff party last night.  They were a huge hit.  Followed the recipe exactly, but also made a few with provolone cheese instead of swiss, because my husband doesn't care for swiss.  Both kinds were gobbled up.  I had four left in the kitchen that didn't fit on the serving platter, so I put them in the fridge over night.  Just as yummy cold the next day.  Very quick and easy to put together.  I left the dinner rolls connected and just sliced off the tops, then I layered on the ham and cheese and put the tops back on.  After baking, I just separated them into little sandwiches with a sharp knife.  Fast, easy way to please a crowd!

I tried this as is and I liked it. I made it again using a honey mustard base while putting the majority of the filling inside and spreading some over the top which I ended up preferring. My BIG tip is to slice all 12 rolls while they are stuck together, I used hawaiian sweet rolls. Just take the whole group of the 12 and slice through the whole thing horizontally then you have two halves. Put the bottom half in a foil-lined pan then lay your ham and cheese over the top and then top it with the top half, when it comes out of the oven lift out the whole thing out using the foil then cut them into sandwiches on the marks. Very quick and easy that way!

Made this this past weekend for a birthday party.  Easy to put together while company was arriving and have hot for lunch time.  Filling enough for adult party guest, but small enough to leave an appetite for other party food and dessert.  Guest really enjoyed it.  One guest took home recipe and another guest took home leftover topping and 2 extra rolls!

Ok, so  my kids did not care for the butter spread, but Hubby and I Loved it!  I put the butter spread on kind of thin, and I wished I had not.  I only used 1 Tbs of poppy seeds and thought that was plenty, next time I will add more of the butter spread to ours and leave it out for the kids.

These are ok. Not really sure what's so special about them. I doubled the mustard and added a little horseradish and still there was not much flavor. It was just a little better than a reg ham and cheese but not rave worthy.

I cut the servings in half, left out the poppy seeds, and used King Hawaiian sweet rolls.  This was lunch today for 4 kids, ages between 10 and 13.  I was lucky to get one for myself, they about inhaled them!!  Thanks so much for posting.

I've made these for over 30 years, but without the minced onion.  I don't melt the butter, but let it get very soft and add the mustard to it and mixinto a spread.  I then spread the mixture on the rolls (used to use Pepperidge Farm Party Roll, but can't find them anymore, so I use Sarah Lee) after I have cut them in half (try not to break up the rolls)  I then sprinkle the poppy seeds on 1/2 of the split rolls, then slices of thin sliced ham and havari or swiss cheese.  I wrap in Reynold wrap and put the oven at 350 for 15 minutes.  I don't pour butter over them. That's too messy for me. Spreading on the inside makes them delish!!!!

I tried these on my children today to see how they liked them before I take them to a party Tuesday.  My kids always clear the table and quite honestly, these did not disappear as quickly as I would prefer. I did 12 with ham and swiss (recipe exact) and another 12 the same only with havarti cheese. I really liked them, I will just say that they were a bit soggy.  I will definitely make these again, I will just use much less butter in the recipe.

These were a big hit with my co-workers at a recent party! They were easy to put together and can be reheated if they cool too much. Any meat/cheese combo works well. The only change I'd make, which I've read in another review also, is to put more or most of the butter/mustard mixture inside the sandwich. It can get a little messy having a lot of it on top. Out of complete personal preferance, next time I'll use less poppy seeds. I'll be making these again for the next party we have!

Either I have a hot oven or the baking time on these were way off.  I used hawain rolls and followed the rest of the recipe as written.  With the exception of these getting burnt, they turned out well.  With the right baking time, these would be great.

These are delicious! I did as others did, and just sliced the top of the rolls off at once, it saved a lot of time! I made these many times, and last time, I used Hawaiian sweet rolls, and they are even better with them!

These were pretty good. I think the cook time could be shorter so the sandwiches stay softer. I think putting them in just until the cheese is melted would be long enough. That way they would taste good cold as well.

These were great. I didn't need all the butter, so I'd reduce that next time. I didn't really pour mine--I used a pastry brush to paint the sandwiches with butter inside and out, then sprinkled them with the poppy seeds straight from the jar, then used a fork to strain the goodies out of the remaining butter and arrange the goodies on top of the sandwiches. The onions sort of caramelized in the oven, so tasty! Thanks for the recipe :)

I made these when my Grand daughter, Carmen was visiting for Christmas.  She loved them and ate four of them.  Everyone wanted more!  Really Really good.. I used several different types of cheese, had to use sesame seeds instead of poppy, and minced garlic instead of onions, but still they were wonderful!  (Oh, I didn't dare use mustard, family hates it)  All these changes, and they were still awsome!

these are so quick and easy and so good!! Didn't have any minced onion, so I used 2 tsps of powered onion instead.  I chopped up my ham and used swiss.  I used the poppy seed mixture on the inside and out and they were perfect.

Excellent recipe.  Everyone asks for the recipe and they are so simple to make.  Make extra and keep them in the freezer.  I lined it up like an assembly line and put them on a baking sheet and cooked them throughout my party.  What was left I stuck in the freezer for a quick go to snack.

It was late one night and I wanted what my mom always fixed. Ham Rolls! Instead of drizzleing the butter over the rolls I added the butter mixture to the ham and cheese and I minced up the cheese and Ham just like my momma makes! (But not as tasty as hers)

These were tasty - I added some pepperoni, roasted red peppers and fresh spinach leaves to the sandwiches - and I used provolone cheese. I also added garlic to the butter mix. Made 2 dozen for a Halloween party and they were gone in a flash! Thanks for the great start - the changes I threw in made these even better!

These are great snacks or they make a good lunch. I agree with other reviewers that have said to put the butter mix inside the rolls so it doesn't drip off.

i used to pop my ham and cheese rolls into the microwave. This time I spread the butter mixture inside my bun(scale down to 2 servings butter mixture for my bigger bun), and pop it into the microwave as usual (20 secs in my case). OMG. heavenly, for a 1 min meal :)

These were good! I brushed on the sauce. My only suggestion would be to brush on the butter and mustard and then sprinkle the onion flakes and poppyseeds over it instead of mixing everything together. I served it for supper, but I think it would be better for a lunch/brunch or appetizer.

I make these often for all types of social gatherings and they never fail to dissapear. I'm always asked for the recipe and of coarse, I'm happy to share! I do as others have suggested and soften the butter then mix in the other ingredients, and spread inside each roll. Next I add the ham and cheese, melt the remainin butter mixture, or make more and pour over the top of the rolls just before baking.

my sister makes these and we eat some in the kitchen because when she brings them out to the dining room, they disappear.  great for parties and book clubs and showers.

These little tasty mini sandwhiches worked out great for a Superbowl party we went to! I drizzled the butter on the inside of each sandwhich and over the top.

These were a hit at the Superbowl party I went to.  I made them up, put them in my small electric roaster on low and by half-time they were perfect.  Enjoyed by everyone!

I added a little sauerkraut/miracle whip light/Mustard "Dressing" (just about a teaspoon) to the bottom of the bread, and then set the cheese and turkey (family doesnt eat ham) on top. I didnt melt the butter all the way, just softened it completely, so the butter, onion and poppyseeds made a spread, then I just put a dallop of it on top of the bread and baked it for 20 minutes.  It melted well without a mess, and tasted great!

pretty good. next time i will leave out the poppy seeds and spread the butter mixture inside. Also 20 minutes was too long because i wanted the edges soft not crispy. yummy change though, and the kiddos liked them.

These were FANTASTIC and so easy.  I made them for a super bowl party.  I assembled them in advance and poured the sauce on just before baking.  They were instantly gone.  I used the Hawaiian Sweet rolls and piled them into a pan nice and tight so the sauce would stay on top.  I will definitely make again.  This would be a great camping recipe also as it is so easy to make and you could warm them on a grill.

This was good and I received rave reviews from my coworkers.  This is a word of warning though...if you want to drizzle the poppy seed mixture over the top do not make it the night before.  The minced onion soakes up all the butter and it makes the mixture very thick.  If you do have to make it the night before, no worries just put the mixture inside the sandwich.  Enjoy!

Oh my gosh- such a flashback from childhood! My mom made a variation of this recipe all the time when I was younger.  She used small rolls that come in a throw-away pan.  I could eat wwaayy too many of them if not supervised :) Highly recommended!!

I made this as an appetizer for the Super Bowl. My mom makes something similiar and I like her's better, so I'm going to have to get the recipe. These were good, but they were missing something.

WOW! What a surprise when I bit into one of these little gems.  The flavor and texture were perfect with a slightly crunchy bottom crust and oniony top.  I didn't have poppy seed (don't care for them) but I substituted seseme seeds and it was just wonderful.  These would be great as appetizers cut into fourths.

I use Hawaiin Sweet Rolls in this recipe.  I also use 1 teaspoon of worcestershire sauce in the butter mixture and use 1 tablespoon for each of the other ingrediants.  Bake them in a pan so that the mixture doesn't run off.  These are a favorite any where I take them!!

This is THE most delicious recipe!! They are always the first to go at a gathering. The only thing I add is Worchester Sauce. I have also fixed these using shaved turkey for those who don't eat ham and they are just as good.

YUM! Made these for dinner last night...My slight variations were, used Hawaiian Rolls and added a tablespoon of honey mustard to the butter mixture. I also took the advice and spread this inside the rolls and ontop. It was perfect!

Just like I remember!  The only thing I changed was to add a few dashes of worcestershire sauce to the topping.  Used the small, store brand rolls (this recipe makes 2 trays), sliced the tops off, ham, cheese, tops back on, then the topping  - all in the little aluminum tray the rolls came in.  Keeps all the 'goods' on the rolls!

This recipe is great---much like my own.  However---if you add worchester to the butter and onion mixture---put all the sandwiches in a casserole dish so they are all touching---you'll find the sauce doesn't get wasted as some readers pointed out.  I make this on Christmas when we aren't ready for a big dinner!

Yum!  Super quick and easy crowd pleaser!  I brought a tray of these to a friend's party, and they went so fast!  Classic combination of flavors, so tasty!  The next time I made them, they were for just my family, and we had some leftovers, but reheated in the toaster oven, they made a fantastic "on the go" breakfast.  Really good stuff, who doesn't like ham and cheese?  Great with American cheese, too!

I just love this recipe!  They turned out wonderful and were a big hit.  I followed another person's advice about slicing the entire dinner roll sheet and then cutting them indiviual before placing in the oven.  I added butter to the rolls and then placed the ham and cheese on top.  They were yummy!!

Around here we call these "party biscuits". They are a staple at any of my husbands family get together. They are super yummy and always go quickly!

Melt in your mouth!!  So good!  I didn't put the sauce inside like some suggested and thought it came out best that way because the sauce is quite strong.  I used onion powder with parsley and green onion flakes instead and worked out perfect!

I've made these several times and they are always a hit.  They are prepared quick and taste great.  I followed the suggestion of one member to halve all the rolls at once instead of one at a time.  These are so good.  I've used them as appetizers and for a quick lunch for my seven year old son.  Great, great, great.

Very, very good!  They go fast!  I didn't think they would be very good once they sat for a while, but I was wrong!  They are still wonderful after they sit a while.  Perfect for a football party.  Also, they are VERY filling!

These are soooo yummy.  Only problem I've found with these is that I eat too many of them!!!!!  Everyone that has tried these, love them.  I did change two things, I drizzle some of the mixture on the inside and then put some on the outside as well.  I also have the ham chipped so its easier to eat which prevents pulling the entire ham into your mouth when you take a bite.  Yummy.  Thanks for the recipe!

I forgot to mention that I did as another suggested and just sliced the top off as well.  The buns pull apart easily after they've been baked because I have the ham chipped (it's so thin that it falls apart.)

I catered a party with these recently and more than 100 rolls disappeared like that!! I did half ham and swiss and half roast beef and cheddar. Mixed up the spices a bit and put some of the mixture on the inside. Also, I did not put mustard in the mixture I poured over the top - I tried it that way one time and there was an icky film from the mustard. Took it out and they were amazing. Wrap in foil to reheat and you've got lunch the next day! LOVED these!

These were yummy. I don't know if the poppy seeds were really worth the mess, but overall these were tasty and the hubby really liked them. I did as other reviewers suggested and just left all of the rolls connected and then cut them apart after baking. Less fuss.

Maybe I did something wrong but these were way too greasy. I thought they were just ok, and my husband did not like them at all. Odd since all of the ingredients sound great. Like I said maybe I did something wrong or need to modify it to our tastes if I make again.

I made this last night and my kids and husband loved it.  I used potato bread to give it a richer taste.  I also bought two ham steaks that are individually sealed.  They generally run between $3 and $4.  Anyway, I fried them lightly on each side and then cut pieces big enough to fit the rolls. After that, I did everything else according to the original recipe. Two ham steaks were more than enough to do 24 big rolls.  I think the thick smoked ham portions made the rolls a little heartier.  My family of 5 loved the taste and we had left overs for their lunches and mine.  Definently, a five star quickie meal or snack.

Way too much poppy seeds!  I will use only 1 tablespoon next time.  This was extremely flavorful. I think it would be excellent for a work or church dinner.  I used the Kings Hawaiian Rolls. The sweetness added to the overall flavor.

This is wonderful. I made them for a party along with other finger foods. I used real onion, didn't have any poppy seed, but it was still delicious without. I must have drizzled a litle too much butter because the longer they sat, the soggier they got, but people still ate them all!

These were just as much fun to make as to eat. Very easy to put together. I did add some sliced tomato to a few of the rolls, and that was a tasty addition.

Didn't feel the poppy seed topping added anything to this sandwich. In fact it made the whole thing slightly salty. Some honey in the topping would probably help.

I left out the spices and made these for a quick breakfast treat. My husband loved these.
