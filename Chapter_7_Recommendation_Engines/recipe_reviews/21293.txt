I made a LOW CALORIE VERSION of this yummy recipe.  First of all, I use just a small amount of brown rice.  The vegetables have such a fanstastic flavor - the rice is just there to make it more filling, but it is also highly caloric (and has little nutritional value).  I used about 1/2 a slice of fat-free swiss in each pepper (waaay less than the recipe calls for), threw in a layer of raw mushrooms and onions (they cook themselves nicely in the juices), and topped the peppers with a few tablespoons of crushed tomatoes (healthier AND it lends a simple, delicious tomato flavor) and a tablespoon of fat-free sour cream to each.  For us calorie-counters, this is a genius meal.

I like regualr stuffed green peppers, but these blow the meat-filled ones away!  I did some modifying though...I used black beans with chili and cumin spices in it, Hunts tomato sauce with basil, oregano, & garlic, and instant brown rice to save time.  I also used only 1 slice of cheese (halved for layering) per pepper to cut calories.  It turned out wonderful.  A dallop of sour cream on top before serving enhanced the flavor even more.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My family and I loooove this recipe and have made it many times! We make a few changes (like others have suggested): brown rice instead of white, usually we omit the swiss, and using the crushed tomato (as in another reviewer's comments) really adds the extra flavor needed. I, like the recipe poster, ate this meal with meat as a child, but we're close to vegetarians now. Thanks for this delicious version of a classic! It's highly recommended! Helpful hint: I insert 3 toothpicks into each pepper so they don't fall over while baking.

This recipe is best saved for a time when you have leftover rice - that cuts cooking time in half!

Pretty dang good! I added a healthy dose of cumin and a chopped tomato to add some bulk. I mixed the rice, beans, tomato, and tomato sauce all together and spooned that into the peppers. Added a layer of shredded mixed cheeses, more rice mixture, then topped w/ more cheese. Even my fiancee, who swears meat should be in every meal, loved this. Thanks :)

Great alternative to using meat. I browned some chopped onion and minced garlic first, then mixed in the chili powder and added a little cumin.  Next added the beans and cooked rice (brown rather than white).  I mixed in half the tomato sauce before stuffing the peppers, and topped the peppers with some shredded cheddar cheese and the rest of the tomato sauce.  They came out moist and delicious.  I also boil my peppers for about 5 minutes before I stuff them so they cook faster (350 degrees for about 25 minutes) and become a little softer.

These were very good. I used red and orange peppers, I cooked them for 10 min in the microwave to cut down on the oven time. I also used brown rice and grated lite cheddar cheese. I will be making these again!

This was a good recipe to start with and change/build on.  Instead of putting it on top at the end, I mixed the tomato sauce with morning star veggie crumbles and spooned that into the pepper as well so the rice would soak in the sauce.  Everyone loved the peppers, even the carnivores.

SOOOOO good!  I was brought up on the meat and rice filled stuffed peppers, so this was a new one for me, and I am so happy I tried it!  I did add some corn to the rice and black bean mixture.  Had extra mix left over, so I threw it in an omelet along with some mushrooms, bacon, and cheddar cheese, and it was fantastic!  Thanks, Gwilyn, these are wonderful!

This was so good. I made it for my sister for Thanksgiving. She is a new found vegetarian! Everyone even the "meat eaters" liked this dish. I think it will be on the menu every Thanksgiving! I did add some corn to the mixture to give it some color! Thanks for posting!

Yummy!! I love this! I added 1 tsp of red chili powder, 1/4 spanish onion, 4 mushrooms diced, 2 clove garlic, 2 veggie burgers minced and a dash of cayenne pepper. I also used vegetable broth instead of water.

A great all-in-one dish vegetarian meal!  As others did I used this as a start and made modifications with what I had on hand.  I usually don't buy green peppers but I neighbor gave us some from their garden and they turned out great with all the other flavors from the stuffing.  I sauted half an onion and 3 garlic cloves and then cooked a brown rice mix in that, and added it to the beans when done.  I didn't have swiss cheese so used jack, and I used leftover pasta sauce in place of the tomato sauce.  To cut down on fat I only put cheese on top, but it would be yummy with gooey cheese layers.  Thanks!

I like others made changes based on what I had on hand, but I think the recipe would be great either way! 
I used red peppers because that's what I had, and couscous instead of rice.  I also substituted a sprinkle of fat free mozzarella instead of cheddar. I also used leftover sauce I had made.
They were filling and delicious!

Great recipe, though it uses way too much cheese. I used maybe 1oz of shredded cheddar per pepper, and it was plenty. Also made with brown rice, to make it a little healthier. But over all a great dish enjoyed by my whole family.

These were great!! I followed the recipe loosely making a few small changes. I sauteed onion, garlic, the chile powder and a few cumin seeds in olive oil. When onion was golden, I added cooked brown rice and black beans.   Before stuffing and baking, I had blanched the peppers, after removing membrane and seeds, I plunged into boiling water for about 1 minute followed by a quick plunge into cold water. After stuffing with rice/bean mixture, I topped each pepper with tomato sauce, and a good amount of grated cheddar cheese. I baked, covered with foil, until peppers were tender and cheese melted. I served with hot sauce and more tomato sauce. I love the fresh taste of organic Muir Glen tomato sauce which you can find in the natural food section of the supermarket.

excellent! love, love, loved them!!
I cut my peppers in half and laid them on their sides.
I blanched them for 1 minute before filling. (this is optional)
The rice is 3 cups if you are not starting from beginning and I did brown rice with chicken bouillon in the water when I made it and beans about 1.5 cups after draining, next time I will add more beans and make it closer to half each. Just personal choice.  I used Gruyere Swiss and it was about 8oz in a wedge so I ground it up in food processor and just stirred it in with the other ingredients.
I added about a cup or so of fresh diced tomato and 1 generous tsp. of ground cumin from looking at the other reviews.  I had enough filling for 5 peppers with about a cup or so left over, probably closer to 2 cups as I kept taking bites of it :) 
I used 13x9, my own vegetable/pasta sauce on the bottom about 1.5 cups, laid the filled peppers in....ran sauce across the top of them and covered with foil.  400 degrees, 30 minutes  uncovered, added crumbled approximately a cup of Cotija cheese enough to sprinkle over all the peppers, baked 10 minutes more.  Yummo!!!   I have added a picture...

The comments here helped a bunch. I decided to experiment using suggestions in the comments and what I had in the house. 

I sautéed 1/2 an onion in olive oil and 2 cloves of garlic, added some cumin and chili powder, then added cooked brown rice, mixed in refried beans and then some tomato sauce. Stuffed the pepper and then topped with a mixed mexican blend shredded cheese. 

It would have been yummy to add the cheese throughout but I was working on keeping down the calories. 

It came out so awesome and super yummy. Would so make again.

These turned out wonderful. I used mixed beans for added colour. I love the layering of the cheese and rice. I did shred my cheese instead of using slices. My sauce was a butternut squash pasta sauce that worked out lovely. Thanks so much for sharing.

Im sorry to say I did not like this at all.I am used to not cooking the meat before baking.I like my stuffed peppers stuffed with a meatloaf type stuffing then baked.I figured I would try this to see if the cooking method was any better but I didnt like this at all.They were dry and crumbly due to cooking the meat before hand.I will stick to my old recipe from my mom.To each his own,I guess.

I used 2 cups of cooked brown rice added 1/4 cup of corn, 1 can of black beans 1 T chili power 1 t cumin and 1 cup of tomato  sauce and 1 cup of salsa.  I then placed slices of cheese inside the sides of the peppers and then filled them.  I used provolone but any cheese will work.  I placed in a casserole dish with 2 inches of water on the bottom and baked 1 hr at 400 degrees.  Turned out great!

This is a go-to recipe that is economical, easy, and a crowd pleaser. I make it exactly as instructed, and it's few ingredients make it perfect in it's simplicity. My mother hates Swiss cheese and my dad hates black beans. They happened to stop by one night when I made this and I convinced them to try this - they BOTH thought it was very good! My husband and I are guaranteed not to leave one grain of rice uneaten when we enjoy these peppers for an easy, nutritious dinner.

I used a delicious chipotle monterrey jack cheese for some extra kick and it was delicious.  I also used yellow rice, 2 types of beans and diced tomatoes on top.  LOVED IT!

This is great, the with some changes that I made (just my personal preference).  I used brown rice (it's all I had in the pantry) and I used shredded pepperjack cheese rather than swiss.  I also added some cumin to the black beans.  It's a tasty, filling dish for vegetarians; I enjoyed it very much.  Thanks for the recipe!

What a delicious and easy way to serve stuffed peppers.  Red bell peppers were on sale so I was looking for a new way to stuff them.  I had 2 peppers and cut them in half to stuff as boats.  I reduced the other ingredients accordingly.  I think the Swiss cheese was a great idea in this recipe.  I used a teaspoon of taco seasoning instead of chili powder. I did cover the dish with foil for baking. I liked spooning the heated tomato sauce over the peppers after baking.  Thicker sauce that way.  I might mix a couple of tablespoons of the tomato sauce into the rice and bean mixture next time but I am not convinced that will make much of a difference.  Very tasty, fits our eating plan well, and so easy -- I think this will become a go to recipe for me.

Very good but I did make some changes. Used brown rice. Fried an onion with some garlic before adding to beans and rice. Also added a bit of cumin and about 2 tbsp of fresh cilantro. Put can of tomato sauce right into the bean rice mixture before stuffing the peppers. Only sprinkled cheese on top, not inside the peppers to cut down on fat and calories. Great base recipe to play with. I will probably add more veggies next time to cut down on the beans and rice. Cooked in the microwave in about 30 minutes, then sprinkled cheese over top and put on for another 2 minutes.

I love these stuffed peppers...the rice/bean filling is delicious.  But I'm not sure how you could possibly use that much cheese in them.  I stuck with shredded mozzarella and layered the filling, then cheese twice in each pepper half, then topped with some sauce and a little more shredded cheese.  There is always some filling left over, but it's great on the side or on it's own!

I loved this recipe! I did modify it a little bit, i added seasoned diced tomatoes to the rice mix and omitted the tomato sauce. I also used wayyy less cheese, i dont care for swiss very much so i might use a monterey cheese. today i used a small amount of swiss and cheddar.

I added corn and a can of chunky rotel tomatos and used extra sharp cheddar cheese instead of swiss. Also added garlic, of course, and a dash of hot sauce.

I love this recipe!  However I did make changes!  I did use instant rice to save time.  I also added ground jalapenos, ground veggie meat, red pepper, black pepper, salt and a couple of dashes of hot sauce.  It's delicious!  I also felt that the tomato sauce was awkward...so I treat them like tacos and add sour cream, guac and more hot sauce.   Second week in a row I have made them!! AMAZING! :)

This recipe "as is" is NOT good at all, but could be a good base to add upon... Onions, cumin, garlic, picante sauce, sharp cheese, all could do to make this recipe better.  And plain tomato sauce.

This stuffed pepper recipe was wonderful!  I did make a few changes after reading other reviews, though.  I used brown instead of white rice.  I added a bag of frozen veggie meat crumbles, I used grated pepperjack cheese instead of swiss because we like our food to be a little spicy.  Also, instead of using tomato sauce, I used a can of spaghetti sauce to add extra flavor.  The only things I'd do differently next time is to add more cheese than I did and either use bigger peppers or an extra one because I had a bit of filling left over.  These were great and my husband even loved them!

The mixture of flavors in this recipe were great. The black beans were a great addition to a traditional vegetarian stuffed pepper. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I had to make one alteration. I mixed tomato sauce in with the black beans and rice to give it a nice moist texture. As the recipe called for I also poured some over the peppers at the end. If I did not add tomato sauce to the filling I think the peppers would have come out very dry on the inside.

Everyone (even non-vegetarians) that I've made these peppers for has loved them. Plus, they are very easy to make. Depending on what I have in the house I've substituted different types of beans, cheese and sauce and they always taste delicious!

A few minor alterations take this from good to a recipe to something I make monthly. I made it first with green peppers and they were ok. I made it using red peppers and it was amazing!!! My only other change is I add a can of onion & garlic diced tomatoes to the rice (instead of topping the pepper with tomato sauce) and add 1 TBS cumin. To me the swiss cheese is a necessity, it adds delicious flavor and the cheese on top that gets browned is my favorite part! I usually have left over rice after filling 4 peppers so I grate the remaining swiss cheese into it and serve the rice with dinner as well since I like a higher proportion of rice to my pepper than fits into the pepper itself.

Great alternative to meat stuffed peppers, but I gave it 4 stars because the original recipe is bland.   It is an excellent recipe to use leftovers/what ever's on hand and get creative.    This last time I used RiceORoni's mushroom rice and risotto mix instead of white rice and a can of Bush's grillin' black beans which have lots of flavor and spice.  I also followed others recommendations and layered in some diced tomatoes and some pepper jack cheese.  My husband and I like our green peppers cooked, so I boiled them for 5 minutes before stuffing them and then only baked for 25 minutes at 350 F.  Don't forget the sour cream!  Yum!   Even better than the meat stuffed version!

These peppers were a hit at a party I went to...however I made the following changes:  I used Cooper Sharp cheese instead (so much better), also I used minute rice and boiled it before stuffing and they took much less time.  I also added diced tomatoes inside.  Mmmm, these were so good!

Love these! We have been given more peppers this summer then we know what do do with. My husband makes them adding 1/2 tsp of mustard seed and 1 tsp. of corriander seed ground together to the rice mixture. We also use cheddar cheese. They are a keeper!

Great Recipe!  My Vegetarian fiance loved them!  I've never made stuffed peppers before, so I checked out a few before deciding on this one.  I thought he'd like beans in it.  (I added some random spices to the tomato sauce, plus some onion to the rice mixture. It would have been just as good without the added, though!)  I will definitely make them again for him! :-)

I'm rating it 4 stars for the recipe as written.  I've made it several times and the first couple times I goofed and added the tomato sauce to the rice/bean mixture.  I also don't use sliced cheese but add shredded cheese to the bean-rice mixture.  Of the two versions I've made, I like the one without the sauce mixed in (and I don't serve it on the side) better.  In the future I may add some chopped onion to the filling.

This recipe was delicious and as others have noted, quite adaptable! I used yellow and orange peppers in place of green, and used a wild rice mix in combination with a bit of white rice. I also didn't have swiss cheese so instead used up some shredded cheddar that I had on hand. The stuffing is a great vehicle for using up leftovers. I will certainly make this again!

Delicious! I've made Kelsey's favorite peppers from the site and that is pretty good but my husband and I decided these were much better! I used cheddar cheese and only put a half slice on the bottom and a slice on top...I also used half brown and half white rice (what i had on hand) and used diced tomatoes with jalapenos for some kick which we love! Added about half the amount of chili powder and about 1 1/2 tsp-2 tsp of garlic salt...yum yum yum!

This recipe is good. I did make the following changes: I used Rice-a-roni spanish rice instead of brown; sharp cheddar cheese instead of swiss; and omitted the tomato sauce since the rice already used a can of diced tomatoes. Using pre-seasoned rice gave this a lot of flavor, though you lose the health benefit of brown rice. I also cut my peppers length wise (on accident) then put some cheese in the bottom, then rice filling, then cheese on top. Next time I will probably use red bell peppers for personal preference. Was really good for lunch the next day too.

I started by boiling the peppers for about ten minutes to achieve the the texture I wanted, and baked for about 30 minutes. I added corn to my beans and rice mixture and put a small slice of cheddar cheese in the middle of the rice and beans. It might be nice to add a little more. I topped the peppers with some diced tomatoes. We also put a bit of plain yogurt on top when we were eating them, and that was good. I think I'll like the leftover filling (there's a LOT) in some tortillas.

Phenomenal Dish!! I used shredded monterey jack because it's what I had. This was just too good to be true. I will make this again and again.

My husband asked me to make this again, he loved it.  I liked it too but felt there was something missing, it was a bit too bland.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions of sauteing onion in olive oil and using taco seasoning since I didn't have chili powder.  Maybe I'll add garlic next time.

An overall very good recipe that is versatile for what you have on hand.  I just have to figure out what would send it into fantastic!

Really enjoyed this! Used red, green and yellow peppers and brown rice. Added some V-8 to the rice mix and some more poured on top before baking. Didn't have any sauce but throughly enjoyed this for dinner and again at breakfast!

My favorite thing about this recipe is that it's easy and takes very few ingredients.  Perfect for a budget!  And it tastes very yummy.  I made them tonight, and my husband said they're his new favorite stuffed peppers.  

I had some garlic and onion on hand, so I chopped some up and sauteed it in some olive oil.  After about five minutes, I turned the temperature down and added my can of tomato sauce.  It gave the sauce more flavor. 

Also, not all the filling fit into my peppers.  Maybe I bought too small of peppers?  So I added the remainder of the filling to the tomato sauce, too.

I really liked this dish.  It's great for vegetarians seeking dishes with protein.  I added lots of cheese for my kids, but kept the cheese moderate for the adults.  I used salsa instead of tomato sauce. Everybody liked it a lot - even my picky kids (they normally hate beans and peppers).

Really good! I might try it with red peppers next time. I used the leftover filling (the original recipe must have used bigger green peppers than I could find) for burritos the next night.

A great alternative to the traditional version with meat.  I used yellow and orange peppers that were on hand, chopped fresh parsley, shredded swiss cheese and added a 1/4 cup of salsa to the mixture for flavor.  We loved them and will definitely make again!

This dish was okay, but not anything great. It was easy and quick, but a little too greasy with all the cheese. It's a good idea for vegetarians, but I wouldn't try it again. I subsituted salsa instead of sauce (as someone suggested), that helped to spice it up a little bit.

DEEEEEEELICIOUS!  I made the full recipe and re-heated them for a few days after initially making them and found them to be quite good still.  Only thing I did differently was I cooked them on the grill instead of in the oven, and the char on the outside of the peppers made them outrageously good.

Really, really good. I cook the rice in vegetable broth, then add corn, green chilies and sometimes veggie crumbles for a heartier meal. I also use less cheese and more spices-- usually chili powder, cayenne pepper, and garlic & onion powders. Serve with salsa & sour cream.  This is so good we often eat it plain or with chips as well.

Wonderful recipe, I too made some changes--I added some ground beef as i had some leftover from the night before, onion, a small bit of celery and also used brown rice.  I reduced the cheese but used shredded cheddar as that is what I had on hand and my husband loved it!! I also added a bit of garlic pepper and reduced the chili pepper just a little.  Wonderful and we have added it to our favorites.

I also used instant brown rice (too much). I cooked peppers in microwave for 10 miniutes, as suggested by another.  I mixed tomato sauce with beans and rice mix before stuffing. I also added 1 tbsp cumin, two cloves garlic and only 1/2 tsp chili powder. I didn't have swiss, so i used mozzarella. I cooked this with Chicken Breasts, but my Hubby and I prefered to eat only the peppers, maybe eat two smaller peppers next time as a meatless meal.  BTW, the peppers were done before the chicken! Thanks everyone for the suggestions to cut back on time!

It wasn't bad - just a little bland. I'll make it again but add a few different things to spice it up a bit. I really liked using beans instead of meat. And I think it doesn't need to cook for 45 minutes at 400 F. Mine were ready after only 20-25 minutes.

What a nice change from the usual ground beef stuffed peppers! Even my husband enjoyed them, and he doesn't like anything vegetarian. Nice and healthy, too!

These are really great. I used a spicy tomato suce and added it to the stuffing. They turned out wonderful.

I remember having stuffed green peppers as a kid (the meat kind) and hating them. These, on the other hand, were awesome! Not being a huge fan of black beans, I used pinto beans instead, but it still tasted just fine, and it was super easy to make.

Really easy and fast.  In order to make it simpler, you don't need to stuff peppers with any cheese at all.  When they are almost finished, sprinkle some cheese on each pepper (I prefer cheddar) and they come out great.

These are the first meatless stuffed bell peppers I have ever made, and they were awesome. I definitely prefer them to the traditional recipe. The only change I made was using brown rice instead of white (it's all I had on hand). Yummy!

Pretty easy to make and I really liked it.  Family didn't care for it much though.

This recipe was OK, not great for me.  It was too bland, even after adding extra spices, in my opinion.  
update:  I've made it a second time, with major changes, and it tasted better.  I used brown rice.  I mixed soy sauce & worceschire sauce into the filling.  I mixed parmesan cheese into the mix (instead of using swiss cheese).  It was good.  I have to admit, I believe that the recipe here, that is for vegetarian stuffed peppers (made with cranberries and walnuts and tofu) is the best stuffed bell pepper I've ever eaten.  But this is a fine way to use up leftover black beans & rice.

I wasn't too crazy about this one, however my wife and son loved it. I may have not baked the bell peppers enough. I ended up taking the beans and rice and rolled them into a burrito for my meal. Loved the beans and rice!

I found it kind of bland, but with some added hot sauce and parmasian it tasted a lot better.

It was very good and easy. It would be quicker to cook them in the microwave I think. I used red bell peppers. I will make it again.

This is a great vegetarian version of stuffed peppers.  I was pleasantly suprised.

This was good, not great, but fairly easy.  It only took 20 minutes to cook in my oven but it still tasted okay so I guess I made it right.  I replaced the Swiss with Monteray Jack and topped it with salsa instead of tomato sauce.  I had it along with a baked potato w/sour cream so it was neither low fat nor low carb but the two complimented each other well so I'll probably make it again from time to time.
