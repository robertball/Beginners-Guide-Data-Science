I think that this was a very nice recipe.  The addition of hot sauce made a nice change.  Sorry but i did not think that this was an over the top 5 star recipe but still good enough to put in my menu rotation occasionally.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

I found the flavor of the sesame oil to be overwhelming. I don't think I'd make this recipe again, but if so, I would do half or less than half the sesame oil.
