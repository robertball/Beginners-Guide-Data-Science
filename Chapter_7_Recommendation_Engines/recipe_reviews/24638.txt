I cannot begin to tell you how amazing this recipe's sauce is. I first made these for a potluck dinner party last year. They were a *huge* hit. I began making them for other potluck events. Now all my invites to such parties are conditioned with a "as long as you bring your famous cocktail wieners". I am repeatedly asked for the recipe. 

Again, the sauce is what is to rave about with this recipe. In the end, the cocktail wieners almost serve simply as a means to an end; eating the sauce. :) For something different, try substituting small pieces of (cooked) chicken breast; this is also a yummy treat. 

I have also slow cooked chicken breasts in this sauce for an amazingly tasty main dish. 

This is an easy to make recipe with fantastic results. As other reviewers have said, the key is to slow cook it. The longer the better. While the actual cook time is long, the actual prep time and "in the kitchen" time is very minimal. You must give it a try.

A note on what sizes of items to purchase if you do not want any extras; a 12oz jar of Red Currant Jelly is exactly 1 cup. A 12oz bottle of Dijon mustard is a little bit more then the 1 cup you will need. A 10oz bottle would probably be the perfect size, but I have never found one.

Awesome, will definitely use again and again!!!!! Have noticed that several people haven't found the red current jelly this calls for. If you have a Kroger store in your area-they almost always carry it-and if they don't-they can order it in for you.Enjoy!!!

this was probably the best lil' smokie recipe I have ever tried, and a great change from the usual bbq sauce, or frying. SO easy to make, I had to quadruple this recipe, an hour into my party they were all wiped out - and none were left after 3 more servings were made! I found the red current jelly at Albertson's.  The longer they cook, the better they taste, and the musard really cools off and the flavors combine nicely after a few hours in the cooker.
I will DEFINITELY make these again, they were the hit of the party!

This is a fantastic sauce.  I've made it using both Dijon and standard yellow mustard;  both sauces were well-received.  One guest even attempted to *drink* the sauce.  (I don't recommend this.)

It's a sweet sauce with twang, and much richer than standard weiner sauces.

This is the best tasting sauce I have ever had.  Everyone that I have fed it to loves it. I can't find the currant sauce anywhere though, so I use concord grape jelly.

Yummy!!! I used a 16oz jar of the jelly from Whole Foods- actually came to 1 1/2 cups. Be sure to drain your lil smokies before dumping them in! Cook at least 4 hours. A very popular dish.

These are very good. I was looking for something my mom used to fix for parties when I was a kid but these are better. I fixed a quarter batch on the stove just so I could try them before preparing a double batch for a family picnic tomorrow. I added what would be 1/2 tsp black pepper and 1/2 tsp ground ginger in a full batch to give it a little zing. I thought they were very good and my wife finished them off as soon as she walked in the door. If they're a hit tomorrow I'll edit this. Edit: They were a huge hit with almost all 8 lbs disappearing. Several people wanted the recipe. I've had versions of these since the 1960s and these are the best.

Yummy!  Especially if you're like me, and like that sort of sweet and salty combination. We used Muscadine Grape jelly instead of the Current, and it was great!

Great recipe! The longer it cooks the better it tastes.  Cooked on Low for about 2 and a half hours, and on high for about 45 mintues.

I followed this recipe exactly as stated when I did the menu for my mother's 50th birthday party. Needless to say, I received nothing but compliments.   A little piece of advice: It takes the entire 2 hours (maybe more) for the end result to emerge... My dad tasted the sauce about 1 hour into cooking and he said it was awful. He tried it again 2.5 hours later and wouldn't move away from the crok pot.

This was a super easy recipe to follow and fun to make because I really did not think it would be appetizing at all while I was mixing it. First of all, I hate mustard. If it even touches my finger I have to rinse it or wipe it off immediately. However, I am not against eating things with mustard as an ingredient like deviled eggs or potato salad. So this was definitely a risky recipe for me to try, but after reading all the rave reviews it had gotten, I just had to go for it! It certainly fills your kitchen with a very pungent, unfamiliar smell that is indeed quite pleasant. When I took my lil' experiments over to my friends house for a party with lots of different food, I told a few people how I had made the lil' smokies and soon enough other people were coming up to me asking how I had made them with their eyebrows raised and noses krinkled. Needless to say, they were an absolute hit and I decided to keep the unopened bottles to make this again very soon! If you want to be a big hit at the next party you go to/throw, whip this dish up and bring lots of toothpicks!

Served this at Christmas dinner 2005 and was hoping to have leftovers.  We didn't, I think my husband thought they were dessert.  I followed the recipe to a T and it was just like I remembered from the 80s.

Great one! I gave it 4 stars because the brown sugar makes this one way too sweet for me. I left that out the second time and it tasted perfect. Good on frozen meatballs in a crock pot too!

I made this for our family christmas.  My mother-in-law typically brings them but I decided I wanted to bring them and try this recipe.  My husband was a little concerned that I was deviating from his mother's recipe.  But....everyone absolutely loved it!!!  They even said it was better which pretty much never happens.  Anyways...I agree with a earlier post - the longer they cook the better - I would say 2 hour absolute minimum.  I cooked them for nearly 4 hours and they were divine and throughout the night they got even better.  Good recipe!

My family loved these zesty little bites! I found the red currant jelly at an Amish grocery store, the regular grocery stores in the area didn't carry it. I'll consider using this same sauce with ham, and my ham meatballs, I think it'll be great! Thanks! csmotherbear

So disappointed! I couldn't wait to try this based on the reviews. I followed the recipe exactly and put it on low for a little less than 4 hours like other reviews suggested. It was very average and not very flavorful. I took it to a church gathering and it was hardly touched. So sad that it wasn't better.

(I am a STRICT vegetarian so I am just going by my co-workers reactions)  I made these as directed and had mixed reactions. The general consensus was "they are ok"  some people thought they were "pretty good". My feelings were kind of hurt because I usually get rave reviews for everything I make, which in all fairness is usually dessert. I will try to make this again for a different crowd and get back with you guys on the reviews:)

I made these for a Super Bowl party last night.  Everyone really loved them!  I made one change.  I was going to make a half batch, using 2 packs of smokies, I decided that was going to be too much so I used 1 pk. smokies and enough sauce for 2 pks.  They turned out so great!!

We would definitely make this again.  Make sure to give this all the time the recipe calls for because it needs it!  The jelly has to melt to give the awesome sweetness that makes this dish.

Gave this 5 stars because it was a huge hit at our annual Christmas party and I think people should try this recipe out!  Even my picky 4.5 year old ate it up.  If it were just me, I'd give it 4 because c'mon, it's just little weiners in jelly, mustard and ketchup sauce!  Not exactly gourmet fare here.  I was sceptical because of the nature of the dish, but I found it delicious as well!  Anyway, I used sliced kielbasa instead of the little smokies.  I also simmered it in the slow cooker for almost 5 hours.  After 2 hours it was still pretty mustardy, but at some point between 4-5 hours, the sauce started becoming a saucy glaze on the sausage and it was yummy!

A unique spin on traditional grape-jelly-and-heinz wiener sauce that has been a family favorite for a few years.  Everyone loves this sauce and remarks on how tangy--and addictive!--it is.  This is the only wiener sauce recipe I'll ever use.

I like the flavor the red currant jelly brings to the table.  Everyone loves it!

very good,the longer you cook, the better they are. I added a little more ketchup and brown sugar and it took some of the mustardy taste away.

Fantastic! Every bite was gone after the first hour of my party, and there were only seven guests.  The recipe was perfect as is; it tasted a bit too mustard-y at first, but that mellowed with cooking.

I followed it exactly, sauce never thickened up - after four hours in the slow cooker, I drained much of the sauce off and served it.  By then the little smokies were overcooked.  No one came back for seconds in the potluck line.  My personal taste test resulted in dissatisfaction - not worth eating.

I was skeptical at first b/c it was ALOT of mustard to be adding. These were awesome, as good as the ones my mom makes.

These were not very good.  The sauce was way too mustardy.  I made a large crock full for a party and ended up throwing a lot out.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Sounds like I'm in the minority reading the other reviews, but I won't make these again.

This is a great recipe that my husband loves. I have been using it for about 4 years now and I love to especially make them on Sundays for football. You know it is football season at my house when the weinies are cooking.

Great recipe!  I followed it exactly.  I've tried this with grape jelly too, but it's better with the red currant jelly.  It was a big hit with the whole family.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were soooo good. Nobody in my family is huge on BBQ sauce so I was glad to find a lil smokie recipe that didn't call for it. They were a hit all around. Even my husband, who never has cared for smokies, thought they were fantastic. I made them in my electric pressure cooker by using the slow-cook setting set to two hours. At the end, I switched it to sauté mode and let it simmer for about 5min to thicken the sauce. They turned out perfect.  I'm so glad I found this recipe and will definitely make them again.

Tangy & just the right amount of sweet!  These were a huge hit at my work food day. The only thing I will do differently next time (and there will be a next time) is follow the advice to drain the liquid off the little smokies so that the sauce is thicker.

I made it as written, except I could not find the current jelly. So I used grape. This was way to "tangy" I must say that I cooked it three or four hours on low the first day, without the wieners. The second day, (party day) I cooked it four more hours on low hoping to cook out the overwhelming vinegar/mustard taste. Maybe it was the Dijon mustard I used. Also I added the wieners and they cooked for a few hours before everyone showed up. When I put away the leftovers, the wieners were rock hard and ruined from over cooking.

These were pretty good, but by no means the "hit" of the baby shower I hosted.  Had plenty of leftovers, which my husband and his friends loved.  The sauce was kind of creamy, which I didn't expect.
