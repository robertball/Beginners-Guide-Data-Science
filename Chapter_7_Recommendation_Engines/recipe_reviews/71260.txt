This is a great drink that can be made just in a pitcher and served on the rocks with floating raspberries to class it up.  I first had this drink over 25 years ago and it's still a refreshing summer drink by the pool.  Usually I tone the vodka down a tad if serving mid-afternoon with family. I varied the recipe to 2 cans frozen lemonade (yellow or pink) 2 12oz. cans beer and use 1 cup vodka. If it's for a cocktail party..I use 1 1/2 cups vodka.  Cheers!

Great drink, however I make it a little different. I empty a can of frozen pink lemonade in a pitcher, fill the now empty can almost to the top with vodka and add 3 cans of beer. Stir well and pour over ice.

Be careful!!  It tastes like lemonade, but goes straight to your head!  Just right for summer nights when you aren't driving.

Will be enjoying one of these tonight while watching the Huskers win against the Badgers!  I suggest stirring with a metal spoon to keep the foam down!  GBR!

I made a pitcher using 1 can pink lemonade, 3 cans of beer, 1 can of vodka, and then added water until it hit 2 liters total. It was a huge success and I will definitely be making it again!

This stuff isn't bad had a similar version back in the day. Substitute a decent light beer instead of Keystone. And I'm sure much of this was consumed at Nebraska games this year! Go Hawkeyes!
