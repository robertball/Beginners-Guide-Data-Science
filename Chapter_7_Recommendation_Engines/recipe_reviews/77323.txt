This was by far the most delicious, creamy, and easiest fudge I have ever made!  I added a little more peppermint extract when I made my second batch, to give it a bit more puch.  Thanks so much, this will become a new festive holiday tradition!

I made this with the kids last night with ingredients I dug out of the pantry for a quick treat. I took another reviewer's suggestion and doubled the peppermint extract. Very simple for little hands and the three of us (my husband opted out) thought this was very tasty. Huge hit in this house!

This fudge is OK. It has a great texture and couldn't be easier, but I agree that it just basically tastes like melted chocolate chips. I even used Ghirardelli chips to try to up the quality, but still tasted like chips. Also, my extract was imitation, which I think may have made it less than it could have been. I may try it again with pure exract, but I'll probably try something else first. And this calls for way more crushed candy than is necessary.

This recipe was very quick and easy.  I used Andes Peppermint Crunch Candy for the topping instead.  The candy tastes wonderful, chops up easily and still gives the fudge that red and white holiday look.  I used 10 individually wrapped candies for a 9x9 pan.

This recipe was ok.  I too added 1 tsp of peppermint extract to give it a bit more flavour but to me it just tasted like melted chocolate chips...which is ok, if you like them a lot.  I gave this recipe 4 stars because my husband LOVED them but personally I just thought they were ok.

Great recipe. Took it to work and everyone loved it. Did make one change, I only used semi-sweet chocolate chips, not the milk chocolate.

This was my first attempt at making fudge!  The results were spectacular!!!  The recipe was simple to follow, and the end product was just as good as the fudge my mother-in-law makes!  These will be the perfect addition to my Christmas plates this year!  Thank you!!!

This was a very easy recipe.  I made a few changes.  I used 2 cups of semi-sweet chips and 1 of white chips.  Then instead of melting stovetop, I used the microwave.  Put in microwave safe dish and heat for 1 1/2 minutes, stir and then heat an additional minute and stir again.  You may need an additional 1/2 minute depending on your microwave.  I then mixed in 1 tsp peppermint and poured into 8x8 pan.  I put peppermint candy on top and put in the fridge to set.  Turned out super!  Thanks for the recipe!!

DH loves chocolate/mint combo, so he thought these were awesome. I thought they were easy but definitely "fake" fudge. They do not have the depth and warmth of real fudge - they are kind of plastic-tasting. I will not make these again.

This turned out very well! It was my first fudge and quite simple. I suggest though doubling the peppermint extract for a more peppermint flavor and adding the crushed peppermint to the fudge rather than on top. These changes helped a lot!

I'm usually pretty good around the kitchen but when it comes to fudge, it either turns out too soft, too hard, too sweet, etc.  Until now!  I was so pleased with this recipe.  The consistancy was exactly what I wanted, the flavour was great, and they look pretty.  I used mint chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet b/c that's what I had in the cupboard.  Other than that I followed the recipe as written.  It's very easy.  The only advice I have is you have to act pretty quickly when pouring it out of the pot because it'll harden fast, so have your pan ready beforehand.

I made these for Christmas.  They are simply delicious and very festive for the season.  They are snuggled in my freezer away from little hands.  Thanks for a scrumptous recipe.

I've made these the past two Christmases and will make it again this Christmas.  It's so easy to throw together while making all the other complicated cookies and such, but somehow it's always the first to be eaten!

This is a perfect and very easy fudge.  It comes out so smooth.  I hate grainy fudge.  I did use all semisweet chips and increased the peppermint extract to 1 tsp. Everyone loved it.  The hostess at the party had some lovely store bought confections that were hardly touched.  This fudge was devoured.

Really easy and really good!  Just the right amount of peppermint too...except one thing I will do next time is use mini candy canes.  I had the Starlite Peppermint candy and it was like trying to break rocks!  Yummy and festive recipe!

I adore this fudge.  The light peppermint flavor is just right.  My only complaint is that a day after making it, the crushed candies start to get runny and start melting into the fudge.  We still ate it, it just didn't look as nice as when it was first prepared.

This fudge is pretty good, but I did take other reviewers advise and added more peppermint extract.  My daughter and I added 1/2 tsp at a time until we arrived at the perfect chocolate to mint ratio (according to our taste, of course).  We figure we added almost 3 teaspoonfuls.  We also used pure peppermint extract.  Thanks for the recipe

This was my first time making fudge and it was so easy and came out really awesome.  I took it to work for some criticism and got nothing but positive feedback!  The supermarket was all out of peppermint and I was so determined to make it that night I substituted it for raspberry extract (I used 1tbsp) and garnished with fresh raspberries.  Wicked good!

This is a really easy recipe to follow, and it turned out perfectly.  I added roasted almonds as I had no peppermint essence, so that it wasn't just plain fudge  - they gave it texture that went well with the soft fudge.  I'll make this again!

I had never made fudge before, and this was so simple!  Very few ingredients made this a very quick and easy recipe.  The end result was amazing!  Hubby and son both scarfed it down.  Loved the peppermint zing - I added 1 tsp. of peppermint extract and that seemed to be the perfect amount (not too overpowering, but a definate mint flavour!)  Loved it!! Thanks for sharing!!

I brought this to a holiday party and EVERYONE was asking for the recipe by the time it was over!  I used crushed up Andes mints on top instead of peppermints...you can buy them in the chocolate chips/baking section.

Great basic fudge recipe.  I added a bit more peppermint extract to bring out the flavor.  This was a favorite at a friend's Christmas party.  I will make this again, maybe next time trying to add marshmallows or marshmallow creme.

This was wonderful.  My daughter was craving peppermint things so I tried this for her care package.  (She is off at college) It will now be on my "must make" for the holidays.

Very very good! I made countless batches of this fudge for family. Not as rich as other fudge. I can't handle more than one bite of other fudges. But this is excellent.

This recipe is really good.  The peppermint is not too strong.  I used 1 cup milk chocolate chips and 2 cups semi-sweet chips because I like a darker chocolate taste.  I also used only about 1/2 cup of crushed candy canes.  I have received rave reviews and several requests for the recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

This fudge is sooo yummy. I used 1 cup milk chocolate chips and 2 cups semi-sweet chips (all I had) and sprinkled the top with Andes peppermint chocolate chips. I got confused by looking at other recipes and accidently added 1 cup of pecans. Still worked out delicious!

I love this fudge!  I have been making this same recipe for many years now.  It gives you just the right little hint of peppermint.  Sometimes I also like to add some walnuts.  Enjoy!

Great holiday treat!! I used a different recipe last year which called for white chocolate chips. It was too sweet, so I decided to look for another recipe this year. I found this and decided to give it a try. I used semi sweet chocolate chips instead of the milk chocolate chips. It turned out just right for my taste! Wasn't too sweet or bitter. I also refrigerated overnight to make sure it was set completely. Very easy and simple to make for holiday baking!

This is by far the EASIEST, YUMMIEST fudge recipe I've ever made. Came out perfect, this is going to be a tradition every year! Would be easy to make variations as well; chocolate raspberry fudge, chocolate banana. Just replace the peppermint essence with another flavour!

This was very tasty and easy, first fudge recipe of the season.  Make sure you use the peppermint extract not imitation.  I used candy canes and pressed them into the fudge.

Yumm. It is disappearing fast. I had to stir it a little towards the end of the cooking help all the chocolate melt. I made 2 batches, one with the 1/2 teaspoon peppermint and one where I doubled the peppermint extract. Would recommend doubling. I could barely taste the peppermint as called for in the original recipe. Very dense fudge.

This is very good... It is true it does not result in a very soft/creamy fudge, but the flavor is wonderful. I used 2 cups milk chocolate and 1 cup dark, because that is what I had on hand. I also increased the peppermint extract to 1 t, per other reviews and think it's just the right amount of minty at that quantity.

After reading the reviews about this recipe not being 'minty' enough, I used MINT chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate chips AND 1/2 tsp of mint extract.  Turned out to be excellent with the right amount of mint!

This recipe produces a fudge of perfect consistency--not a small feat in the world of homemade fudge.   As for flavor, I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the peppermint extract then mixed the candy into the fudge (not on top).  The result was a very minty fudge.  Those who want something a little milder might do better with 1 and 1/2 tsp extract.  Also, I'd advise others to be cautious about over-chilling the fudge.  I put mine in over night, and ended up having to thaw it for three hours before I could cut it.  You could avoid this problem by monitoring the fudge as it sets, or (simpler yet) spoon warm fudge into individual servings so as to avoid the need to cut it.

This was very delicious.  My picky 'tween' daughter declared these 'to die for,' and she was right.  I made them in mini baking cups to add to Christmas cookie trays for neighbor gifts, and I didn't have to even bother with peeling off foil, and cutting it up!  Perfect!

This was OK.  Tasted good enough, but if you're looking for fudge -real fudge- you can't take shortcuts.  The textue wasn't quite right, the flavour wasn't that deep, etc.  But good enough, I guess, if you want a quick chocolate fix.  And very pretty, as well.

The taste was delicious but I was disappointed by the texture of the fudge.  It was very soft and gooey and difficult to cut into squares.  I thought I followed the recipe exactly but it didn't turn out as I expected.

Pretty good--if you like your fudge to be very smooth and creamy--this recipe is for you! I had many, many compliments on this treat when I made it for our holiday roadtrip to see our grandparents.  Even grandma--a wonderful and seasoned baker--could not keep her hands off this one!

These were so easy and so delicious! A great recipe to bring to a party, especially if you don't have a lot of time to put into preparation. Hands down the easiest fudge I've ever made - and the biggest hit. The peppermint is particularly refreshing.

Really good, and REALLY easy to make. I put more crushed peppermint candy on top, but crushed it finer than in the picture initially. Tastes like a sweeter, richer, chocolatier version of peppermint bark.

We substituted both white chocolate chips and those soft, melt-in-your mouth peppermint candies and it was Yuummee! Very fun & easy for my 13 yr old "helper" too.

This recipe is so simple that it's actually embarrassing. I made a some to bring into work and everyone loved it! they thought it took much longer than it did.  I made it as is which was great but I also made one batch with white chocolate in place of all of the chocolate. It turned out unbelievable, it made the peppermint flavor pop!!

They were a little harder to make than I expected, and I doubled the amount of peppermint extract, but the results were yummy nonetheless.

Very delicious and creamy! We added 1t of pure peppermint extract, some regular marshmellows, and a bit of butter, and this fudge turned out perfect. Just the right amount of everything, as to not be too overwhelming.

This was a great fudge recipe with a twist- and it set perfectly! I also used extra peppermint extract because I like the minty flavor and I liked the finish of the crushed candy cane on top.  Very festive.

I took this to my book group last evening and was very well received.  My version turned out more like a mint truffle.  I used closer to a a one and one half teaspoons of peppermint extract and added one half cup of plain whipped cream cheese.  I didnt have peppermint candies to crush but I did use approximately 15 of Hershey kisses in the mint truffle flavor crushed as a topping.

This is now a family tradition during the holidays.  I use crushed peppermint puffs instead of hard peppermint candies, and sometimes mint chocolate chips, when available.  I stir them right in at the very end before spreading it in the pan, that way they're mixed throughout the fudge.  It's easy and consistantly good! The fudge will taste as good as the chocolate you use, so buy wisely, and don't bother with the cheap stuff!

I made this for Christmas gifts and it was very easy and very delicious. I doubled the recipe and took it to work but it was gone so fast I made another batch the next night. I used a little more peppermint extract than the recipe called for and to keep the crushed candy canes from melting and falling off the top I gently pressed them down into the fudge while it was still warm.

A really easy and fast fudge recipe for the holidays. I added a little more peppermint extract than what the recipe called for - about 1 tsp more. Also, I melted a bit of white chocolate and drizzled it over the   fudge before letting it set in the fridge. A hit with all my friends!

For my first try at making fudge, this tastes awesome AND is easy!  The mints also melted all over the top after a day so I'll use a different mint or leave them off until it's time to serve.

I made this fudge to bring to a Christmas dinner, and it got a lot of compliments.  My husband said the peppermint candy stuck to his teeth, so it wasn't his favorite dessert.  If I make it again, I think I will use a different kind of peppermint candy rather than the one suggested.

I like the flavor of this fudge and it looked nice at first.  But the candy canes melted all over the place no matter what I did.  I will try it with some other topper next time.

Fantastic Fudge!!  And it couldn't be easier.  If you've never made fudge before or if you did & it turned out grainy try this recipe.  It's foolproof!

I really liked this recipe. It was really easy to make. Since I did not have pepperment extract, I decided to substitute it for extremely strong pepermint tea. It turned out really good, although I had to use more tea than i would have used with peppermint extract. This recipe is wonderful for Christmas time!

This fudge was so easy to make. My family and I thought it was delicious!  It looks lovely on a tray of Christmas cookies and sweets because of the crushed csndy canes.  I added 1/4 tsp of peppermint extract and you could barely taste it.  I will use the 1/2 tsp next time. Thank you for sharing!

I made this fudge yesterday along with the one bowl chocolate fudge. I instead used the same bowl i used for the plain chocolate fudge and melted my chocolate in the microwave still came out fantastic. However I added almost a 1TBS and 1/2 because the 1/2tsp did not lend enough flavor to the chocolate. Everyone loved it! Will probably make for christmas with my boyfriend's family

Huge hit here! I ran out of various chips, so I used about 3/4 cup milk chocolate, 1/2 cup semi-sweet and the rest dark chocolate chips. Everyone really liked these.

Great Fudge recipe! This recipe is so fast and easy and it makes a delicious minty chocolate fudge that's great for the holidays! I usually don't add the peppermint on top because after a day the pieces begin to melt and become very sticky and unattractive and the fudge is great without it!

Despite being chilled overnight, the fudge was still not set the next day which is majorly disappointing considering I had to go out any buy chocolote chips, condensed milk and peppermint candy. I wanted to give the fudge as a gift today but it is still in my fridge. If it does not set today then it will be a waste of expensive ingredients as I have already had to make cookies for presents instead.

For being so easy, this recipe is awesome!  I even goofed it up by adding almond instead of peppermint, then quickly added peppermint also. It still turned out wonderful!
