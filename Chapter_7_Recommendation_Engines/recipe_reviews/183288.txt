Presentation is a little lacking- truthfully the sauce looks slimy and brown, but the taste is great. Once I convinced my family to try it, they came back for seconds; said it tasted like unbaked apple pie. If I were to try again: less sauce, little more cranberries.

I substituted Splenda Brown Sugar and non-fat yogurt. I made it for an office party and everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe.

I have spent hours looking for recipes for Christmas dinner for the family and a Christmas party.  I decided on this one, but wanted to try it first.  So I whipped up a batch for a side to my husbands birthday dinner tonight.  The outcome...this is defiantly a recipe that will be made for the Christmas party!  We are in love with it.  I did take some of the other comments into consideration and here are the only things I changed; 

Vanilla Greek yogurt (to be honest I am not a fan of Greek yogurt, but wanted it thick)
Slenda brown sugar
mixed pecans and walnuts
mixed cherries and cranberries (both dried)
Next time I will add Grapples with the apples to add some grape flavor as well

Other then that its a wonderful recipe, and my husband has said that when I make it for the party he better be gone or I better make an extra batch (to which I already have to quadruple it)

Thanks for the starter idea, I will be building on this one

This is SO good. I had two small bowls this morning with my pumpkin muffins. Even my kids asked for seconds. I didn't sprinkle extra nuts on the top, but I left everything else the same. This will most definetely be made again, perhaps on Christmas morning! WTG, Shana!

A really wonderful option for a winter salad.  It's pretty sweet but the mixture of brown sugar and cinnamon with the apples is just perfect.  We served it at a casual lunch with friends and it was really well received!

This is delicious! Used half green apples and half red apples and did not peel them. I used plain greek yogurt for a thicker texture and about 1.5c craisins (sprinkled some on top along with the extra walnuts). It turned out great (not watery at all) and it was a big hit!

Nice refreshing apple salad.  Very different from my usual.  We liked the addition of the brown sugar and cinnamon.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was to toast the walnuts.  The apples did not turn brown the second day when we packed leftovers in our lunches.  Thanks Shana for sharing.

Fantastic recipe!!! The only changes I made were that I also used dried cherries with the cranberries and I used vanilla greek yogurt (less runny and higher protein content) instead of plain. I made this for a potluck and everyone raved about it!

This was very tasty, the sauce tastes like melted ice cream! However, I thought the sauce was a little "drippy" (also like melted ice cream).  Not sure how to fix it, maybe by using sour cream instead of yogurt, or omitting the yogurt altogether.

This was really good.   My family loved it at our Christmas dinner.  Also I didn't peel the apples the second time I made it since I was short on time but it was just as good.

This is a great salad. Watch out don't add to much cinnamon it could overpower the mixture. Because I like cherries, I added them instead of the cranberries, too much liquid. overall I liked it alot

Dressing has a great taste but it makes the apples look like they are brown and makes the salad look awful. Not a pretty salad.

Everyone at work loved this. I added some of my homemade pumpkin pie spice and mixed in some sour cream with the yogurt. Bananas on top for garnish (because I had some that needed to be used). Really good!

Good.  More like a desert than a salad to me.  I did add it to Apple Cinnamon Oatmeal for breakfast, and it was delicious that way.

Everyone at the table enjoyed this salad -- which makes a good compliment to a traditional Christmas dinner.  I used vanilla yogurt rather than plain, and the results were yummy.

Great recipe for apples. I used pecans instead of walnuts, but I'm sure the salad would have been good with either. I think its important to soften the cream cheese sufficiently to prevent getting cream cheese chunks. The brown sugar gave it a delicious sweet flavor. I bet you could put some grapes in it for variety. In fact - the dressing could probably be used on a number of different fruits. Thanks for the recipe!

I just didn't top with extra walnuts, but the salad was great overall. I would love to try this with different apples. I used Granny Smith because they were on super sale, but would love to try Honeycrisp next time.

Yum! Everybody at our family party loved this, especially my mother-in-law. I used vanilla flavored yogurt (low fat and 9 grams of sugar) instead of regular. 3/4s of a cup of sugar seemed a lot to me, so I skipped it entirely. Leaving out the sugar made it look good--white instead of brown--and it made the taste of the apples and the cranberries the center of attention. It may not work if your apples aren't so flavorful--mine were Jonathans fresh off the tree.

Be sure to melt the cream cheese almost completely. I had a hard time trying to whisk 'softened' cream cheese.

Great basic Recipe which I changed to suit me: Changes: approx.4 oz cream cheese, 6-8 drops of Stevia, no brown sugar, and we enjoyed it. plenty of dressing, plenty sweet, fewer calories. Thanks for posting this recipe. (soaked the unpeeled applies in water/lemon juice as I sliced / chopped and did not turn brown.

This has become a repeat apple salad in my family and a requested side dish at events!  This IS very sweet and is like a dessert.  I also used non-fat greek yogurt and next time I might try a little less brown sugar although anything with brown sugar always makes me happy :)

this was alright.  the dressing was too sweet.  I wanted the dressing to be more vinegary. I probably wont make this again as I made the same salad the next night but with ranch and it was better tasting.

So yummy! I doubled this and made for Easter dinner for 9 people, everybody had seconds, including the picky 2yr old. I didn't have any yogurt so I substituted heavy whipping cream and then just whipped the dressing in the blender so the cream would thicken up a little.

Smells a lot like apple pie, and the taste is not too sweet or too savory; it's a really good recipe for the autumn season! I will say I didn't think there was anything particularly outstanding about the taste- I liked it, and would definitely make it again, but I don't think it'll be a regular staple on my meal planning (partially because it took me a long time to prep, but that may be because I'm a slow prepper). Very easy side dish idea. Could be fun to bring to a potluck!

Made this to take to my parents house for thanksgiving. It was a hit! I only gave it 4 stars because I omitted the brown sugar completely in fear that it would be too sweet. It was just right for our taste without it. Will be my go to Apple Salad from now on! Would like to try it next time with some celery.

This is delicious. I gave 4 stars because I didn't have yogurt and used sour cream instead.  I didn't find this as being to sweet. My husband really liked it too. I will make again.

Love it. Easy and full of flavor. Everyone who tries it loves it. I use vanilla yogurt. I add extra mix nuts and extra apples.  I am going to try some dried cherries next time.

Delicious! I substituted with vanilla Greek yogurt since that is what I had on hand. Plenty sweet with the added sugar from the substitution. Can serve as a dessert.

I made it for a small gathering of friends. Everyone complimented it; most went back for seconds. I will definitely make this one of my "go to" salads.  Several other reviewers commented on the brown color being unappealing. I thought it looked fine! Perhaps they used dark brown sugar instead of light.

I know this is a "winter" salad for up North, but down here in Florida it makes a terrific summer sald to have with grilled pork chops.  Tasty and cool.  Easy to put together, we really like it.

I started with light and fit vanilla yoghurt (vanilla) and used whipped cream cheese. I used just a dash of brown sugar & whisked it well. I added the chopped pecans and I used Ocean Spray craisins. I had leftover honey crisp and chopped into bite size squares. All in all taste really good.

My husband's family always had Apple salad for holiday meals, but I have never been a fan of mayo based recipes. This cream cheese and yogurt base apple salad is a PERFECT compromise and the taste is fabulous.

My husband lived it. So easy to make. I used pecans instead of walnuts.
