This is one of my most favorite ways to make ranch dip. I use reduced fat sour cream, my own homemade dry ranch dressing powder and I increase the pickled jalapeno peppers. For even tastier dip, try this with HOMEMADE pickled jalapeno peppers. NOTE: This also can be made with whatever "creamy" base you have on hand--sometimes if I don't have enough sour cream I'll use part reduced fat mayonnaise or equal parts sour cream, mayonnaise and greek plain nonfat yogurt. Anyway you make it, it's always fantastic.

Loved it! I did cut the recipe back, but that was my only change. Great flavor and you can dip just about anything into it (like we did, lol)! The jalapenos were a great addition. A definite keeper~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)
