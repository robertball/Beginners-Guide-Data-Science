I would give this 10 stars if I could. We had three functions during the week and I made it three times and every time it was the hit of the party. Served with sliced French bread it really is a decadent appetizer. It doesn't have to be put into a fondue pot either. I served it in a ceramic bowl for one of the events and it kept warm and gooey just the same. I will be making this many times again.

This is so good!!  I mistakingly added dry ranch flavoring and loved the flavor (1/2 packet for this recipe).  My guess is that it's not as subtle as other reviews said.  My favorite was french bread and carrots dipped in.  Kids loved it!

If you are looking for an easy and yummy cheese recipe - then this is it.  Everyone really loved it and you can taste just a hint of the ranch dressing.  Very good! I would even make it again just as a dip without using my fondue pot.

this was the most amazing dinner for my family the other night!  the fondue has a very mild flavor that went over well with the kids, but the ranch gave it enough oomph for us to enjoy as well.  i served it with lots of raw veggies, tortilla chips, and apples. i had been looking for something different to do for dinner, that in this heat wave wouldn't heat up the whole oven and this was such a hit!  we will be doing the "dippable dinner" more often around here :)

Be careful not to let the cheese get too hot or it will turn grainy.  Delish and simple recipe! Great with Cauliflower & Broccoli, Bell Pepper strips, Celery, and day-old bread chunks.

I doubled the cheese to make it thicker, but other than that it was pretty amazing.

My husband and I love experimenting with different fondue recipes, and this one was the best cheese one so far!  With just a hint of the ranch flavor.  We added lots of green onions and it gave it a nice kick.

This recipe is very good! This was my first time doing cheese fondue and it turned out great!   I used a different ranch as well, so it doesn't have to be the Hidden Valley. Thanks for the recipe!

I think the cheese dip/fondue tasted just fine. Be careful with the heat instructions. Cooking the flour in melted butter for 2 minutes in medium heat will make your mixture brown... Not what you want.

This was bland until I added salt and pepper, then it was divine!! The whole family ate it up.  I served with veggies and sliced bread.

The fondue came out more like cheese soup, not as cheesy and thick as the Melting Pot's fondue. The flavor was great and I added a bit more cheese! Maybe next time I'll add less milk.

I avoid cooking as much as possible, and always have to look up directions on how to boil an egg....and yet, this recipe turned out excellent!  No lumps, no blobs!  I just added ingredients slowly and kept stirring!  It tasted delicious.

Love this!  Much better than white wine and guryere cheese one.  Will use this one for future fondues.

Im not sure what I expected. This was good and eaten entirely. I guess I would somehow limit that ranch flavor better if I could and not share for a fancy meal, great for  a SUPER casual appetizer.

Really good!  I was pleasantly surprised that the ranch dressing flavor was so subtle.  We don't do fondue very often, but this will be one of my "keeper" recipes.  Thanks for sharing! :)

Excellent recipe!  I made this for a fondue party and it was a hit!  Everyone loved it and it was great with bread cubes, shrimp and crab lumps.   I garnished the fondue with some sliced green onions, which accented the taste.  You don't really need a fondue pot; it was just fine in a mini-slow cooker.  Like the other reviewer said, I'd give this recipe 10 stars if I could.
