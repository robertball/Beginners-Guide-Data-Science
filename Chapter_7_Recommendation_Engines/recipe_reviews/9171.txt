My husband and I are on a low-carb diet - turnips are very low carb - so I decided to fix this. I'm normally not fond of turnips, but this recipe is excellent - it reminds me of mashed potatoes.

I made these for my husband for Thanksgiving!  He loves turnip.  I substituted the milk for cream and only used 1/4 cup.  They were wonderful.  Some previous reviews commented on how runny the turnip was, try reducing the milk.

I love this but no one else at home will eat it, so I scale it down to one portion.  It smells a bit, too, so if you're having guests, I would not suggest cooking this dish! :)

in our family we add even ammounts of carrots and turnip. The carrots add a bit of sweetness. This is a must for all of our holiday dinners. It has been in our family forever. Thanks for sharing

Glad I found this...I am trying to cut back on potatoes one of my favs, so I tried the mashed turnips and they were just as good as mashed potatoes. I did add a bit of bacon grease in the water, and some margarine while they cooked. They did seem to drain "water" after I mashed them but I just stirred them up again. Very good recipe and will be making it lots more.

These were quite tasty.  Like other posters, I added butter as if making mashed potatoes, and ended up using just a "splurt" of half and half.  Turnips, by nature, have a very high water content, and so I see why others felt they were runny.  I mashed them in the pot, with the butter and tiny amount of cream, and then turned the burner back up to medium to reduce the excess liquid before serving.  That worked out quite well!

I love turnips.  Got lots of compliments on these.  I used 1 enormous turnip, it made enough for at least 10 people.  I had to adjust the milk and butter to taste.  After boiling and draining I returned them to the pot to cook out the remaining/excess water so mine weren't soupy/soggy at all.  Delish!

I have to admit I was a little leary about mashed turnips ... but they are actually very good.  I think next time I will cut back on the liquid a little.  They turned out a little too wet ~ so maybe a half of a cup instead. Otherwise they are a great addition to our recipe box.  Perfect for a Atkin's friendly meal!!  Thanks so much!!

Cut way back on the milk - or, better yet, stir in heavy cream a little at a time - to avoid ending up with nasty watery turnips. I also like turnips and cauliflower mashed together. Thanks!

Wow!!  These are truly amazing!  I had these for the first time over a friends house and I used this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner.  Many of my family members never tried these but trust me when I say that they did not last for the next day's leftovers.  I did add parsley for some color and that worked well too.

Our family's first turnip, a big Koran turnip, I mashed with one red potato and it came out great. Mashed potatoes with slight textural changes. I will make again.

This is a great low carb alternative to mashed potatoes.  My husband is on a low carb diet and he loves this!  I am not on a low carb diet, but really love it too!  Last night I made it with frozen turnips and added chives.  yummmmmm

A good, basic recipe. I left out the milk and it was still a bit watery.  Easy, one pot dish.

I just started using turnips as mashed instead of potatoes.  So delish, however, omit the milk and add a little garlic.  I eat them all the time.

very good recipe, but like others, i don't like the excess liquid so i steam my cut up turnip.  this makes a huge difference as to how much excess liquid there is.

Simple and tasty! Like other reviewers, I added just enough milk to reach our favorite consistency. Great mashed potato alternative for my family. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These were fantastic!  We harvested turnips from our own garden and couldn't figure out what to do with them.  I have made this recipe a few times now.  Some with mashed potatoes some not.  This is definitly going to be a new staple in our dinner plans.

I had never made turnip before, but my Dad specifically asked me for turnip on Thanksgiving, so I tried this recipe.  It was simple and tasted great.  I've never been a turnip fan before, but I will definitely make these again.  I made this ahead of time because when they cook, turnips smell a bit icky.  I just heated it in the microwave when it was time for dinner, and that worked out great, and I had no lingering turnip odor in my kitchen when guests arrived!  Thanks for the great recipe, one of the only plain turnip recipes on this site.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but every time I make this recipe, it comes out so watery and thin!  I have tried and tried to squeeze all of the water out of the cooked turnips but it still just turns into a gloopy mess.  I think I'll just stick to pan frying turnips.

WOW! I literally hated turnips before I made them this way. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this! Thank you for sharing.

My mom always did something unorthodox with mashed potatoes that I find helpful with mashed turnips, cauliflower etc. She drained the pan of water and then put it back on the stove over low heat and "dried" the potatoes (turnips.) After that she would add the butter and salt, mash it and add milk or sour cream sparingly until the desired consistency was reached. It always cut down on that too watery texture that nobody likes!

I have never eaten a turnip in my life. This was so yummy. The only change I made was to add another tablespoon of butter. I wouldn't hesitate to make it again and and forward the recipe to family and friends.

It was good,  I only added 1/2 cup of milk as prior reviewers suggested.  I also added a few small potatoes.  It was good, a little sweeter taste than mashed potatoes.

This was very bland to me and had a weird consistency.  I had a lot of turnips given to me and decided to try this recipe.  I ended up throwing the whole thing out because it tasted terrible...sorry..YUCK.

My husband like them, I didn't care too much for them. One tip, they did turn out runny, so I thickened them with some mashed potato flakes..it worked out great!

Made two Turnips,  as per recipe.  I cubed them and added less milk,  approximately 1/4- 1/2 cup.   They were delicious!

Just wanted to share a tip, on cutting and peeling Turnips.  I poke them a few times with a knife,   Put them in the microwave on a paper towel (to catch the wax) , on high for 5 minutes!  Remove carefully, they will be hot.  Let them cool until you can handle them, then peel and cut.  You will find they are so much easier to peel and cut after this step!

A variation of this recipe has been in my family for at least four generations.  Some tips after making it for YEARS:  Drain turnips as long as possible.  Mash the cooked turnips (before adding any of the ingredients) and drain well again.  This will help cut down on the wetness.  I only add a small amount of milk, butter, and S & P.  Adding a pinch of baking soda in the cooking water helps cut down on bitterness.  Also, avoid buying frozen turnips if possible--they don't have anywhere near as much flavor.

in order to have the perfect consistancy of mashed potatoes from turnips, you have to strain out all excise liquid even after mashing.  Best results is to strain mashed turnips in an screen-type strainer, all excise liquids will just drip through, not drying out the vegetable,  transfer back into bowl, then continue on with your own recipe.

I don't own a ricer or masher, so I used a fork - big mistake. The turnips were stringy. I don't know what happened or if turnips normally taste like this, but they were very sweet too. I will not be making this one again.

i used small turnips--boiled them for about an hour.  i then added about 3 tbsp good butter (plugra), some salt, and a squirt of milk--no more than a 1/4 cup.  i think you need to base the milk added to what it looks like it needs.  turned out fantastic!!!

turned out kind of watery, and basically tasted like mashed turnips (no spice or other interesting taste to help it out).  Kind of dull.

We love turnips and they are always a part of our Thanksgiving feast. I use fat free half and half as needed along with butter, salt and pepper. I use a potato masher to break up my turnips. Thanks!

You can add half and half or cream to lower your carbs instead of using milk... and also too you can make them loaded by adding cheese and bacon.. or use a little less liquid and add some sour cream to them...

I scaled this down for two people and made it for my wife who had never ate turnips before. I don't remember liking them much when I was growing up but I wanted to make an old fashioned country dinner for her.  When Grandma used to make turnips, she would serve sliced. I don't remember them tasting so good when I was growing up but we both like these and we could have eaten more than I made! I'll definately be naking this again.
