delicious. I did not have enough lemon so I opted to use it for afterwards instead of sticking it into the trout. Tasted great this way, too

absolutely beautiful! Thank you for the great recipe. Husband and I loved it and we will be making it like this for a very long time. Great way to bring out the flavour of the fish
