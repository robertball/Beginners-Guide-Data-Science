I made this using spices (as suggested by another) with Uncle Bens Long grain and Wild rice mix and we love it. My husband ask for it often.

This has been a family favorite for years. No wonder other reviewers think the recipe is bland. The recipe poster left out the seasonings. Try adding 1-1/2 tsp. salt, 1/8 to 1/4 tsp. red pepper and 1/8 to 1/4 tsp. black pepper when you add the mushroom soup, parsley and lemon juice.
