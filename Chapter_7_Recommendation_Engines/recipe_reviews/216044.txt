Creamy, rich, flavorful and delicious. Seasonings right on.  After topping with the panko crumbs I didn't like the pale looks of the fish so I drizzled it wih melted butter and gave it a sprinkle of paprika. Perfect - just what it needed. It gave the fish an attractive golden color and gave the panko crumbs a little crispiness.

This is something different to do with halibut. I season the fish simply with salt and pepper and then put on the topping. Pretty good recipe.

The boyfriend has been asking for Halibut, but we don't have a grill in our new place so I set out looking for a recipe for baked halibut. I chose this because it is similar to a halibut casserole his grandfather makes. I scaled the recipe down to two servings and it made just enough sauce for two fillets, but I did think the lemon pepper was a bit strong so next time I'll put a little less in. I'm not a fan of mayo so I subbed greek yogurt and it was YUM!  The only thing I'll say- I think it needs to be cooked a little longer than 25- mine ended up being in closer to 35 and really could have been cooked more but we were hungry. Thanks!

Very tasty.  My steaks were about an inch thick, so I only baked for 12 minutes, with an extra 2 minutes on broil to create an even better crust - they were cooked perfectly.  I also added some dill, replaced the lemon pepper with lemon juice, and replaced the mayo with some half and half.  Definitely will make again!

I made half this recipe for dinner last night and it was delicious!!!  I used tilapia, and I did reduce the lemon pepper by 1/3.  I also cut the panko to 1/4 cup for my half recipe and moistened it with melted butter.  The sauce was very good, and didn’t overpower the delicate taste of the fish.  With the addition of the butter, the panko got crispy and turned a golden brown.  This was quick, easy and delicious and I’ll definitely be making it again!

This recipe was wonderful.  I am not a huge fan of lemon pepper seasoning (normally when I do a lemon pepper chicken or tilapia I use fresh lemon juice, zest, fresh ground pepper and a few other herbs), but I used the lemon pepper seasoning in this recipe.  I really did enjoy it!  Although, next time I might try using the fresh lemon juice, etc..

My husband could not stop oohing and awing about this exquisitely simple seafood dish.  My lemon pepper seasoning had seen better days so I chose to use freshly ground pepper and fresh lemon zest instead.  Light sour cream and mayo worked perfectly in this dish, as did freshly grated parmesan reggiano and chipotle pepper instead of cayenne.  Yummy to the tenth degree!

This was so yummy! I followed instructions exactly and my whole family enjoyed the meal! My only thing was I overcooked the fish and it was a bit chewy (it my first time cooking fish). I recommend watching your cooking time if you haven't cooked it before.

Yummy even though I over cooked it slightly.  I added asparagus with balsamic butter (search site) and a baked potato with Ken's creamy Caesar dressing.

Excellent with walleye but a bit too much sour cream. I am sure that is because my fillets are so thin. This recipe is very similar to Broiled Tilapia Parmesan, which is wonderful, but with a panko topping. My kids loved this.

VERY easy, with ingredients you likely have around the house already, this was a big hit.  The creamy part wasn't overbearing at all and got thumbs up from all three men I was serving!  Will definitely make again.  In fact, I already did.  My boyfriend liked it so much, we made more for his lunch this coming week because there was none leftover after dinner!

sorry, but this was awful!  4 beatufiul halibut steaks ruined, as far as I'm concerned.  The lemon pepper was all you could taste and it was just too much!  I bet the rest of the sauce was delicious, but you coudn't taste the delicate flavors of the sour cream and parmesan over the lemon pepper.  I actually think I'll try this recipe again, omit the lemon pepper entirely, just salt and pepper the filets and add lemon juice to the sauce.  I bet it will be wonderful!

Instead of lemon pepper, I used 1 teaspoon curry 1 teaspoon garlic powder and 2 teaspoons of pepper. Then after it was cooked I broiled it for a couple minutes to get a harder crust. Very good though.

Delicious! Agree with the other reviewers that a little melted butter mixed with the bread crumbs gives a perfect golden-brown texture.

EXCELLENT!  I altered the recipe slightly due to what I had on hand and also based on what other reviewers had to say.  Instead of 6 (4 oz.) fillets, I had a 1.2 pound piece of Halibut that I kept intact.  I used Best Foods LIGHT mayonnaise, Knudsen's LIGHT sour cream, 2 teaspoons of lemon pepper seasoning, and Progresso's Lemon Pepper panko crumbs to which I stirred in 1 tablespoon melted butter.  I lined my baking pan with nonstick aluminum foil and baked the fish for 30 minutes.  PERFECT!  My husband said it was the best fish he's EVER had. Even my adult son, who says he doesn't care for fish, liked it and ate every morsel.  This recipe is easy, and definitely a keeper!

Wonderful! Moist, cruchy and flaky at the same time. I did not have mayonnaise, so I used Lemonaise (Green Dragon flavor) and upped the cayenne, a splash of lemon juice and fresh ground pepper instead of lemon pepper. I served with pan fried okra and steamed brown rice. Yum!

Wow! This was really exceptional. I used Italian Breadcrumbs instead of Panko and LOVED the results. I'm going to try this same recipe with chicken and see how it turns out!

Excellent!  I didn't have lemon pepper, so added fresh ground pepper and some grated lemon rind.  The fish was awesome....juicy and the flavors in the sauce and breading didn't overpower the lovely mild flavor of the halibut.  Will make this for company!!

We did not care for this recipe. Followed the recipe to a T, outside of using tilapia loin (much cheaper).  The mayo and sour cream just didn't work for us.  Oh well, thanks for the recipe though.

Absolutely delicious!  I know this recipe as Halibut Olympia and it’s superb.  The sauce is excellent with any white fish and even good spooned over asparagus or broccoli.  It will make you feel like you’re dining in a luxury restaurant.
