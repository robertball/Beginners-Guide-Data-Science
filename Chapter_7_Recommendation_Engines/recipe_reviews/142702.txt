We tried this last night.  WOW!  The flavors were GREAT together!  I did make more dressing though - we like a lot and as written is enough for one person.  I boiled the new potatoes with a Zatarain's crab/shrimp boiling bag to add a little extra zip - they turned out very tasty!  My husband also wanted to add red onion so we did that as well.  We will make this again - probably every other week or so.  We loved it!  I would recommend it to others!

This was a good, different salad.  You do need to know that the dressing is good, but as written it's enough for one serving, not four. At least if you want to taste it!  So other than making more dressing, I made this as written and we enjoyed it very much.

When I told my husband that I was making this for dinner he rolled his eyes in disgust. Boy was he wrong! We both loved it...so full of flavor. I am going to make it again next week for company. Frank, you are a genius!!!!!

made this the first time a few months ago, great!  Followed recipe as written except for making more dressing as suggested.  Everyboy loves it.  The flavors/textures/and temps went well together.  Husband and teenager were sceptical, but both enjoyed.  Will keep in my tried and true weeknight list.

My girlfriend's diet steered me to this recipe.  She absolutely loved it. Didn't have shallots, so used 3 parts minced onion to one part minced garlic, and used majoram instead of tarragon because I didn't have tarragon.  I was concerned she might not like the dressing because of her aversion to mustard, but I cut it back a little, and she didn't even know it was there.    Other reviewers said the posted dressing measurements made only one serving instead of four...I agree, it made barely one serving for my taste.  Thanks, Frank...I made mucho brownie points with the little lady on this one!

Yum! Quick, easy, and delicious. We added some Feta , which topped of the salad's great blend of flavors. I call salads like these "Man Salads" - and my husband definitely liked his!

John likes steak, but I don't unless I have a real tender cut. Do not know if I would make again.

This is your basic vinaigrette dressed salad with potatoes and steak plopped on top.  5 Stars for presentation as it looked beautiful.  This is a good meal, but very basic.

I thought this was sooo good! I used balsalmic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar, the dressing is delicious. I made a ton of it, per other reviews, which workedo out well

This was very good! I ate it for lunch and everyone in the office said it smelled great! I added Worchestershire sauce to the beef and sauteed it with onions. I didn't have the ingredients for the dressing, but I did have some Caesar dressing. THis came out very nice and without the carbs, a pretty "guilt free" lunch.

Excellent!!! Like others have stated, you need to at least double the dressing. I also added a little Splenda to the dressing to offset the tartness of the red wine vinegar. We were so impressed with this meal we repeated it again the following night! Thnak you "frank11" for submitting and sharing this recipe; it is appreciated.

This made a very good supper salad and was a hit with the meat-loving men in my family.  I used some leftover steak that we'd grilled the night before (we'd made extra so we could try this recipe) and added crumbled bleu cheese per K.T.'s suggestion.  I'm always trying to get more vegetables into my family and tasty salad like this one is a great way to do it!

It was awesome! I used regular mustard, white wine vinegar and pepper for the dressing since it was what i had and it was really good. I did double the dressing since it only makes enough for one serving.

We've been making a salad similar to this for years. Try adding feta or blue cheese. Also, to make things simpler, we bake frozen french fries instead of preparing the new potatoes...delicious!

Made this for girlfriends and they went on and on about it.  I marinated the steak for tenderness, and quick cooked green beams and carrots to add, making a bigger meal.  Also added feta cheese crumbles at the last, but I am sure it would be perfect as is.  Just served with crusty garlic bread and fresh strawberry pie (from this site) to make a perfect light supper.

Simple and excellent mustard dressing make this a very good meal. I thicken the dressing a bit and kick it up with two to three times the amount of dijon. So tasty. That is all this recipe stands out for. Otherwise, it is a simple salad, and simple steak. If you need a bit more flavor, cook your steak on a skillet with red wine, butter, peppercorns and garlic (or marinade over night if you must grill).

Very good. I added fresh dill and used italian seasoning instead of tarragon. I added different vegetables to the salad. I would use this dressing on a regular salad as well.

This is a great salad recipe and so fast. I forgot to add the tomatoes, but it still was so yummy, especially the dressing. I added 1 packet of Splenda to the dressing as it was a little too sour for my tastes. The Splenda takes the edge off and gives it a slightly sweeter finish. And yes, as others have said, double the dressing recipe as it is not quite enough for two. This will be on my regular rotation from now on! Thanks for sharing!

Made this for dinner last night and thought it was decent. I roasted the potatoes with rosemary.  As everyone says, double the dressing - that's barely enough for two.  I wish I would have marinated the steak, it was kind of blah.  I would make it again.

This salad was very good.  I did make changes to the dressing though.  I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine since I prefer balsamic and when I discovered that I didn't have any tarragon I used Italian Seasoning instead.  The dressing came out great however you have to at least double it.  I'll definitley make this again.

We really enjoyed this! I used all romaine lettuce for the greens because that's what I had, and I also crumbled some bleu cheese over the steak and potatoes. I doubled the dressing ingredients and it was about right for 2 salads (big ones). The kids had plain steak and potatoes and salad - they weren't interested in putting it all together into a salad with the dressing. Delicious and simple - we will definitely add this to the regular rotation.

I make a similar recipe (pork scallopini), but I love this beef sirloin version, and it's much easier, too. I made it for my sister's birthday last night and it looked so festive. The only change was that I marinated the steak first in a good vinaigrette (balsamic, evoo, mustard, rosemary, garlic), and used arugula for the salad base. She talked about how "delicious" it was long after dinner was over.

Definitely will make it again and again. The salad dressing really makes the difference. My wife and I have our favorite steak sauces but neither one of us even gave it a thought. It’s a complete meal in a bowl.

It was a great recipe.  I didn't have red wine vinegar or tarragon, so I used the white wine vinegar and oregano.  Turned out very tasty.

Go to western PA, this is a staple.  When you go to a restaurant you order a steak or chicken salad and it comes with fries.  How could you eat one without it?  Delicious combination!

Great Salad. It made a light and filling lunch for my family of four. I made few changes to use what was available. Flank steak for sirloin, apple cider vinegar for red wine vinegar, basil for tarragon. Also doubled the dressing as suggested by some reviewers. But should triple the amount  next time, as potatoes absorb a lot of it. Also, I couldn't help topping  with some blue cheese at the end, the way a steak salad is served at a famous steak House in Houston.

If you like steak, potatoes and salad, I would suggest taking the recipe and running with it! I'm rating the idea on this one, not the recipe itself, as I made a lot of changes per what I had on hand, plus I used my Airfryer to make some crispy potato bites for the potato aspect. But, really, what a great idea for any salad lover; thanks for sharing!

This is one of my very favorite salads and I eat salad as a main meal a lot!  Often, when I've grilled the steak, I have grilled thick slices of potato as well and cut those into bite size pieces for this salad.....delicious!  This is definitely a keeper.

This was yummy. I microwaved my potatoes for 5 minutes and then wrapped them in foil with butter and salt and tossed them on the top rack of our grill. I grilled the steak with some seasoned salt. I added radish and we used our favorite dressings. Love a salad for week night dinner.  Super quick!!

My entire family, including my children (2 & 5 yr olds) love this, I've made it several times. Super easy to prep, quick to cook & put together, common & inexpensive ingredients. You can easily adjust to suit your tastes. You will need to double the dressing, as that is only 3 tbsp. I don't & just stir it into my potatoes. This time I also added feta cheese, since I had some that needed using. I honestly do not understand lizzitish's review. Saying that she's "giving it 5 stars for presentation," then complaining that it's basic (uhm, the lil' note up there about it being comfort food should've clued you into that & if it didn't the ingredients sure as heck should have) & leaving it a 3 star review? Makes no sense. Not everyone are gourmands searching for the next exotic, show-stopping recipe. Some of us just want delicious, good looking, easy to prepare, low cost meals, which this one certainly is & there isn't a darn thing wrong with that.

I liked this - it was very filling and tasty.  I used a cast iron grill pan.  I also marinated the steak for about 45 mins prior with a very basic marinade.  My husband loved this and I liked the contrast of the salad greens with the steak.  Oh, and I used flank steak.

We were almost finished making this one before we discovered it was one salad rather than a "potato salad".  (Maybe it would help to read the instructions entirely before starting!)  I would have called it "Salad with Warm Steak and Potatoes".  We loved the dressing over the steak, but would skip out on the potatoes next time.

Absolutely delicious.  Didn't have any tarragon so used without but I'll try it next time to know which is better.  Very easy recipe and looked wonderful on the plate as well.

We husband and I thought this was deliciously different. I was out of cherry tomatoes so my presentation was not what it should have been. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Pretty good, just buttered the potatoes up a bit. Use the dressing sparingly though. A little goes a long way...  =)

I would double the dressing recipe as it was a little dry - try spicing up the potatoes a little first

I did not use the dressing from this recipe but I followed all other steps exactly.  I doubled this recipe for my b-day party and it was a smash!  The dressing wasn't necessary but I let people have their pick of bottled dressings anyway.  Thanks!

Very nice salad. Made minor changes in that I used potatos that I had (not "new"), as well as 'Inside Round' (French) steak as it's less expensive. Rubbed it with Montreal Steak spice before grilling in a very hot skillet for 2 min per side.

My family and I liked everything about this recipe except the dressing. Maybe it was the tarragon, I don't know, but I made the dressing twice and we ended up throwing that out both times. The next time we used a store bought Italian dressing and it was delicious over the steak, potatoes and salad.
