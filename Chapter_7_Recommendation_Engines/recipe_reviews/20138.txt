I made it with half whole wheat flour, half brown sugar, and added some ground cinnamon and cloves, and they were really tasty! I also left the skins on the apples.

Pretty good basic recipe.  I needed a muffin recipe that didn't use eggs so I was glad to find this one.  I did add some vanilla and I used mandarin oranges for the fruit (that's what I had on hand).  I just used an individual one-cup size of the oranges.  I drained the juice into measuring cup and then added milk to make the 1 cup of liquid.  My husband really liked his vanilla muffin (he got the one the last one scraped from the bowl and didn't get any mandarin oranges).  I definitely liked the added vanilla with the mandarin oranges but probably would add cinnamon instead if I made apple muffins.

This is a good base recipe. Made as is, it is pretty bland. Just add some spices and more fruit (and maybe sugar) and then it's yummy.

These muffins turned out great for me! I used frozen fruit in place of the apple with excellent results.  I made 4 different flavors with this one recipe... blueberry (1 cup), blackberry and raspberry (1/2 cup each) and strawberry (i added 1/2 cup mashed berries to batter and pressed one berry into each cup before baking. ) Also made chocolate chip.  Very pleased with this recipe!

I make these often with different kinds of fruit. I use 1/4 c. br. sugar and 1/4 c. splenda, also add 2 eggs because batter is so thick. I have made blueberry, peach, rhubarb, pear, raspberry and pineapple with coconut. They all were really good.

Perfect base recipe!!!  Exactly what I have been searching for!   I made mine with strawberry preserves & a tiny bit of lemon extract & they are almost like cupcakes!  Would be amazing with a cream cheese frosting/glaze drizzled over it. THANKS!!!

Great muffins!  I needed something to make this morning and they worked out great! I added the two eggs per someone's suggestion and made a crumble on top with sugar, cinnamon, and oats.  They rise up beautifully, too.

I really wanted to bake something but had no eggs and no butter. I came across this recipe so I figured I'd try it. Fantastic! I added some raisins and cinnamon along with the apple and they're absolutely delicious! Great recipe!

Very nice muffins, but I did add one egg to the batter.  I used oil in place of shortening.  Added 1 finely diced apple and some cinnamon.  I think these would be great with other fruits and nuts added.

I tried these with pineapple and they turned out fabulous.They make a good addition to a warm breakfast on a spring morning.Although,I would agree with the other reviewer about the flavour-additio of spices would make it even better.A good recipe for vegetarians who donot eat eggs.

These muffins were delicious! I made three with cranberries, three with raspberries, three with rhubarb, and three with bananas. I sprinkled some raw sugar on top to make it pretty and sweeter after it baked, and they were so good that it only took my friend and I (plus my parents) an hour to eat 12. The batter was a little too thick to put in the pan, so we added a tablespoon of orange juice. But, great recipe!

Delicious! Took some of the advices given: added cinnamon and mixed it with the chopped apples, also added about 1/4 cup extra milk as the batter seemed to be doughy, as someone else had said, but I could have added more I think. Overall, really good!

This recipe is a keeper!  I made these for my 2-year-old who has milk and egg allergies -- GREAT!  He's not big on chunks in food, so I left out the fruit and added 1 tsp cinnamon for flavor.  He asked for seconds, which is rare!  Will DEFINITELY be making these again for him, for me, for guests.  Done in 18 min, perhaps because of less moisture with no fruit.  Next time I'll brush the tops with margarine and add some brown sugar.  YUM!  Thanks!

I just made these with my 3 year old son and we really like them. We used half white and half whole wheat and used defrosted frozen strawberries and peaches. We also increased the fruit and sugar. Very tasty and moist!

The overall taste was kind of dry but other than that the apple slices were juicy. I recommend adding more milk due to the texture of the muffins.

I substitute with Almond milk and butter. And in place of apple I used the scraps from juicing. All turned out delicious! I even did a second version with added cinnamon and chocolate chips as a healthier version of a birthday cake! Will keep this for future use - great, easy, and quick way to use juicing scraps!

Great recipe! Made it for mason jar breakfasts (pour on some yogurt and fruit and you've got breakfast for a week on the go!:), so it is perfect to pour into 6-10 jars (depending on how big you want your muffin) and cook. The center is very floury and tougher to eat by the end of the week, but I did substitute and use gluten free flour (combo of tapioca flour and potato starch).

The first time I made it, they were perfect. The second time I used fresh strawberries instead of apple, and it turned out a little bitter in the aftertaste. Not sure why that happened...

I love this because I whip it up quickly and add what I want. It's my go to. I often half the sugar, and use coconut oil and apple or pear sauce-whatever I have. I've made it with fruit and tonight I tried it with veggies. My toddler twins loved it!

This recipe came out awesome. I used frozen mixed berries. The only problem we ran into was that the batter was more like a cookie dough, so we added quite a fair bit of milk to get a proper batter. Next time will try an egg instead to help keep it fluffy. Otherwise, a great, simple recipe. Also substituted butter for the shortening, worked quite well.

Never ran across a muffin recipe without any eggs.  Recipe OK...but next time I will add one egg to the recipe.

Good, basic muffin recipe. I made two batches, one with peaches and blueberries and another with coconut, strawberries and cherries. In my eagerness to stuff these muffins with fruit, though, I added more than a cup and made the batter a little too runny--the muffins were stuck to the pan, despite greasing it ahead of time. Other than that, delicious recipe! I will definitely make this again, with wholewheat flour--and make sure to fill the muffin pans to the very top as my first two batches didn't rise very much.

A nice versatile fruit muffin recipe.  I made mine with grated pear and a bit of almond extract and some cinnamon.  The flavor was quite good and the kids liked them too.

Am I the only one that had to add more milk? It was more like a dough than a batter, so I had to add nearly a full extra cup of milk! I also added vanilla extract and a little brown sugar for flavor. We used mixed berries, and they were really good with the changes I made. But VERY EASY!!!

These were ok. I'll only make them again when I have no eggs. I did add a tsp of Vanilla.

A healthy-tasting muffin!  The only change I made was adding 1 tsp of cinnamon powder to the mix.  The results produced not-so-sugary muffins that are great as an anytime snack.

Love these muffins! I like how they don't need any eggs and for a plain muffin they have a wonderful moist, cakey texture. Great potential for adding extras too but for the purposes of the photo I kept it as written this time round. I'll make these again for sure.
