Great flavor! Really easy to make. I didn’t have thyme so I subbed fresh rosemary. I also added garlic. I will be making this many more times!

I tried this recipe because artichokes and mushrooms are my favorite vegetables. Absolutely delicious! I did not have sherry so I used red wine instead. Very easy to prepare. My children loved this dish.

Very easy to make, I do all my prep first then do the cooking and assemble. Tasted really good...I think even the kids would like this. I have to say I think 3 tablespoons of butter is too much, I love butter but I’d reduce it by half...the food was bathing in butter.

Good flavor, did make extra sauce. Served over egg noodles. Will probably add garlic to the chicken mixture next time. That may make this recipe a 5 star

This was pretty good, BUT I felt it needed some garlic & thyme.   I'm not too sure about the addition of mustard, which so many people add into their dishes.  IMO, if you know how to season properly while cooking, you won't need to add mustard in order to achieve flavor.

This was very good but the sauce was not thick enough. Served first night over spaghetti. Next  night mixed chicken mixture with macaroni. Added additional butter, Marcella wine and grated Parmesan cheese.

Great recipe. I used it with chicken that was already cooked and a little dry. The gravy helped. I only had 11 oz. of chicken but I didn’t reduce the gravy. I actually used 3/4 cup broth and it was perfect for the reduced amount of chicken. Anxious to try this recipe again with raw chicken.

Excellent recipe - I cooked linguine and added to the dish along with some of the pasta water after removing from the oven - mixed and served topped with parmesan.

Very good. I made exactly as printed and had over egg noodles. I like that it is a low calorie dish.

Thought this recipe was quite bland as written. I love all the ingredients as stand alone foods, but together they just didn't do it for me.

I used artichokes in water and added onions and garlic to the sauce! Just wonderful!

Definitely good! I ended up making a gravy from the juices and having steamed potatoes with it.

I followed the recipe for the most part really closely but will not make it again as-is.  Nobody liked the artichokes added (4 of us) and I think it would be far better without them. I also found there was barely enough sauce (I like a lot) so I would have made more and I would definitely add more mushrooms [the one change I made was to add additional mushrooms & a couple spoonfuls of cream of mushroom soup from the can, and I could probably have added half the can with more broth, so I don't know how dry it would have been if I hadn't added that extra]. I served with bowtie noodles. It was tasty otherwise (after we picked out all the artichokes) and is the kind of recipe you can modify to your own tastes and it will still be good.

Definitely a do-over  Next time I’ll do a little less flour but otherwise it was delish. Even picky-eater hubby didn’t mind the artichoke hearts, which I cut into smaller pieces.

Followed recipe pretty much as described. Used one large chicken breast since the meal was just for my husband and me. Served over chicken stovetop stuffing. We both loved it and I will definitely make it again!
