I made this recipe and the regular Boilermaker at the same time. I omitted beer and used broth instead because I don't cook with alcohol. Everyone loved both.  More importantly, the healthier version doesn't taste like you're missing out.  Great option! Many thanks!!!

This has now become my "go-to" Chilli.  It is rich and delicious.  Full of flavours that make us ask for seconds and thirds.

Bland, almost inedible. I always make the normal "boilermaker" but wanted to save a few calories. When it tasted to drab I compared ingredients it literally lacks two from the other recipe: 1 tbsp of bacon and 4 beef bouillon cubes. I don't think those amount to 300 calories. I added that and like magic it was back to the old PERFECT recipe. Stick to that one folks!

Made this today and by far it has been the best chili that I have ever made!!!  I used fire roasted diced tomatoes and ground turkey instead of the ground beef.  Also, I added chipotle hot sauce instead of tabasco sauce.  The taste is out of this world!!!

I made this chili for Super Bowl and everyone loved it!  The only response I got from a few was it could use more salt, but to me it was great.  I couldn't find the beans listed so I just used kidney beans and most spices were not measured to be exact as the recipe called for.

Loved this recipe and may be my new go-to! I substituted all meat with pulled chicken, used a combo of black beans, pinto beans and chickpeas (since that's what I had on-hand) added a small can of corn and used a lot of sriracha to replace anything spicy. Super tasty! Gave four stars since I didn't follow recipe exactly.

Thought it tasted low calorie.  It was OK.  Though we had to skip half the chili powder.  And it makes a lot more than 12 servings!

Delish but spicy!  Next time I'll only use one small jalapeno and mild chili beans.

I added twice the amount of onion and peppers, two jalapenos and used all spicy chili beans instead of the regular kind. Perfect!

Very hearty and delicious. Honestly though I don’t really care for the chicken sausage so I don’t think I would add it in the future or maybe replace it with a different meat. I also didn’t add some of the spices as I prefer a mild taste. Otherwise it  is a fabulous recipe.

I have made this more than once and also the full boilermaker version.  It gets rave reviews all the time, especially from those who prefer chili with a little kick.   I have won prizes with it at our local chili cook off.  (spices to make more chili)   Lots of fun and keeps my big boys full.

The stand out taste was tomato other failures here are not sauteing the onions and not using fresh garlic. Good reminder of why you should never a recipe you've never made before and serve it to guests before eating it yourself.

This chili recipe is my go-to. It's really flavorful and healthy. I do quadruple the garlic because I'm a garlic nut. I've also switched the white sugar to brown sugar for a deeper flavor.
