I used fat-free and sugar-free yogurt which is definitely more liquid-y than Greek-style so I didn't have any issues with it being too thick as others mentioned. Depending on what you're drizzling this over, you can add some zest, switch up the extract or even add food colouring.

I cut this recipe down to 6 servings. My glaze was still a little too thick so I did have to thin it down a little bit but the flavor was good and it went well with my Orange Yogurt Mini-Muffins this morning. NOTE: Instead of using milk to thin it down for my orange muffins, I used orange juice concentrate. I just added it by teaspoons until it was the right consistancy. I just took my mini muffins and dipped the tops in the glaze.

I was looking for a way to use Greek yogurt that has become so popular lately and found this recipe.  I made a pound cake that I essentially created the recipe and used this on top.  I did change somewhat by also adding some almond extract and using highly concentrated vanilla oil in place of the vanilla extract.  Really great flavor on top of the pound cake and I will look for other uses for this recipe.

This was definitely quick, and I liked it a lot.  I didn't measure everything but just dumped, and that worked well enough.  I thought it was thick, too, but since I was spreading it on hot cinnamon rolls out of the oven, I wasn't concerned about that at all.  I would probably thin it with milk or whatever I had on hand if needed.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm extremely lactose intolerant, so I used sheep yogurt. It came out liquidy even after 30 minutes in the freezer. But it tasted delicious after I poured it on a cake.

I made the recipe as described, and it worked beautifully. It is a thick glaze, but that is exactly what I was looking for. I am tried of thin and runny glazes and wanted something that would hold its color on a dark chocolate cake. The greek yogurt  gives it some richest/ depth of flavor, and it is super simple.

oh my, this is a keeper. I followed the recipe exactly, and had a wonderful glazed icing to put on my yellow cake. It is the proper balance of sweet and tang. So much better than sugary sweet icing. I will make this again and again.

Tasted great the first bite, but afterwards I wasn't too keen on it. But then again, I didn't even try it as a glaze on a cake.
