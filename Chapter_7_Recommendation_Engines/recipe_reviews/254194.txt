Thank you for the quick and tasty recipe. I added the 1/2 cup of sugar with strawberries and rhubarb before putting in baking dish. I wish I would have melted the butter and poured over top, but it was so soft I had lots of tiny slivers of butter everywhere. I had to bake my cake for a much longer time, but I might have used more gelatin than called for. So I just baked it until it was “set” and golden. Family loved it!!  I will make this again!
