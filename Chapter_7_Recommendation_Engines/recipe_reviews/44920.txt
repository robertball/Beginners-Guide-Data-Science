This is yummy. I also added some very finely chopped white onion and a little hot mustard & served it with mini rye bread.  Mini Liverwurst & Onion sandwiches :)

My grandmother made this for years. She added chopped onion and 1T lemon juice as well. If you skip the walnuts on top, you can mold this in a salad mold and "frost" with mayo, sour cream or more cream cheese and sprinkle with chopped chives. Thanks for bringing back happy memories!

my hubby likes to make this- not a bit braunschweiger fan myself, but this is pretty good.

I haven't made this in years.  Thanks for the reminder!  I used to make it every year for the holidays because my father loved it so much.  I use soft cream cheese with chives and onions and only 1 tsp Worcestershire.  I also add 1 TBS dry minced onion & 1/4 tsp garlic powder.  I roll mine in chopped pecans and serve with wheat crackers.  It also freezes well.  Oh boy, now I'm really craving this!

A request filled! My mother asked me to find a recipe like she remembered her grandmother making. I definitely thought this was "old-people" food, but everyone loved it including the kids. Thank you!

I made this for my family, and I didn't really care for it.  But I don't really like liver anyway.  A couple people really liked it, but the majority voted it a big NO!

I made this a few times. We are not big fans of cream cheese, both me and my hubby. So I substituted it with plain yogurt. Used less oz than cream cheese so it won't be runny. Serve with crackers. I agree with other reviewers - adding ranch or garlic salt might even improve the dish, but it is really good the way it is. Will try ranch next time.  Update - for picture I shaped it like football, dusted with paprika and made "stitches" with squeezable mayo.
