Okay well the thing is...I love quinoa, but something just isn't quite right with this recipe.  I love the flavor of the toasted quinoa, delicious, and it cuts the cooking time quite a bit.  The mushrooms were too much for me and my husband and without thickening the broth it is runny - maybe cut the liquid a bit?  Also the dish really just ends up tasting like whatever broth you use and mushrooms.  I love the idea and will fiddle with it to see if I can find something we like.

This was my first recipe to try using quinoa and I really liked it (though I thought the cooked quinoa was a bit strange looking when it's cooked, I'm still trying not to look at it too much! haha...). I added some finely chopped celery and carrots, fresh spinach and mini baby vine tomatoes for colour. I didn't have any parmesan so I used a mature white cheddar and added a tiny bit of soy sauce and it was great. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipes rocks! SO GOOD! My husband hates quinoa and loved this recipe, my 4 year old had a huge second helping. The only thing I changed was smart balance instead of butter, I will be making this again!

Delicious! I love quinoa and always lookin' for a new recipe to use this grain. I halved the recipe and totally omitted the butter and cheese for calorie reasons. I did add some dried thyme leaves to the mix and a can of drained/rinsed canelli beans for more protein and fiber. I had this with sauteed spinach and garlic, and a tossed salad. Great Dish!

I followed this recipe exactly except for leaving out the parmesan cheese since I planned to use this as a rice substitute to serve with portabello mushroom gravy. I figured that since gravy is fattening enough, I should try to make a more nutritious side dish than white rice! We really enjoyed this dish, but next time I will add garlic salt and onion powder for a boost in flavor since quinoa tends to be a little blah sometimes. Thanks for a great recipe, I will definitely make this again!

The mushroom-onion combination creates a nice, saucy broth so when you add it to the quinoa that flavor gets soaked in. Then the cheese gives it a little creamy kick when you bite into it! I loved it.

Very easy! The quinoa has to be cooked for 20 min not 10; I think that was a typo. I substitute olive oil for the butter and used salted water with a bay leaf and a couple dashes on Braggs seasoning instead of chicken broth, as I didnt have any and wanted to keep in vegetarian. I added a bit of chees but it wasnt necessary. It was close to risotto, but much healthier. I will make this again. Thanks!

I made this one according to the instructions (with a slight embellishment on the cheese and added pepper to taste).  I had no problem with the liquid to dry ratio nor cook time.  It's an earthy tasting dish, which is great for a comfort food that is very high in protein.  I only gave it three stars because it wasn't the kind of slap-you-across-the-face deliciousness that I have found in other recipes on this site.

This was the first time I made quinoa, and I'll certainly be making it again.  This was great, also I can see this being a great base recipe for adding other veggies in such as zucchini, yellow squash, spinach, or egg plant. Great when you want to have a meatless dish...use vegetable broth.  Thank you!

Followed the recipe as written except I forgot to add the cheese at the end and it wasn't detremental to the taste.  A nice change to the regular side dishes of rice and potatoes!

I have to say right off that I didn't make this recipe as written but I am reviewing it because the flavor of the onions and mushrooms is great with the quinoa. I used less (about 1/2) mushroom and onion and I think more might have been too much and we love both. I did not brown the quinoa nor did I use the Parmesan. I'll be making this again.

This was my introduction to quinoa and it was a good one!  I think the ratio of liquid to quinoa was about right for where I live, but it's very dry here in Denver.  Also, I agree with another reviewer who thought the 10 minute simmer time was a typo. I simmered it for 20 minutes and it absorbed nearly all the liquid.  The remaining liquid combined with the cheese and vegetables tomake a nice sauce.  I also added one carrot finely chopped, and about 1/4 zucchini finely chopped.  I felt the dish needed some color and the extra flavor really added to the dish.  I also used a red onion, both for color and flavor.  A darn good recipe!

I'll be honest and say that we were very reluctant to trying Quinoa because we've never had it before! However, we liked it! As you can tell my screen name, Rice is my favorite food. This is a pretty good subsitute...not the same! But it's a good sub and we will use again. I followed the reciped exactly, but did add a dash of kosher salt. This a good 'first timer' recipe and I'm looking forward to using it in other recipes. :)

Second time making this I modified by using shallots instead of onion and upping the garlic significantly. I pureed the shallots and garlic in the broth using the magic bullet blender then strained out the solids and cooked as directed. This gave the broth MUCH needed flavor that was lacking when I made this the first time.

Since I'm used to the really good quinoa at Whole Foods, I guess a little disappointed.  A little bland for my taste.  Hopefully, I can find one better.

Read the reviews and should have cut the broth by 1/2 cup... bit too much. I didn't have onion or cheese but did this with garlic, mushroom and some asparagus I needed to use up. YUM! Total winner...

Pretty yummy sidedish!  I made it with 1/2 cup of rinsed quinoa, so scaled everything accordingly -- except I only used 3/4 cup of broth (to prevent the soupiness mentioned by other reviewers).  For the other ingredients, I used 4 mushrooms, 1/3 onion and 1 whole clove of garlic.  With these changes, I was able to make it using the cooking time listed in the recipe.  Omitted Parmesan cheese as I didn't have any, but am sure it would be a good addition for the next time I make this!

this recipe was fabulous!!  I just recently heard of quinoa and was eager to try it.  I made it with tri tip for my Easter meal and everyone loved it!  For years I've been serving plain white rice with everything, now I will definitely make quinoa instead!  I highly recommend this recipe!

This was my first experience with quinoa and I must have browned the quinoa too much because it ended up tasting vaguely smoky, even though the quinoa never really browned.  It was OK but not great.

We enjoyed this.  I didnt do the butter though.  And towards the end, I was needing to add some color to my meal so I added some dehydrated sweet red pepper, and probably some other stuff but I didnt do the cheese at the end.

Followed the directions as listed... I used a variety pack of mushrooms from Publix (oyster, shiitake, and button I believe). So yummy; my family devoured it!

I thought this was good. Not the most delicious quinoa recipe but a good dish to make and have in the fridge if you're trying to eat healthy. A little salt and pepper really add a lot to the flavor.

It was wonderful and easy. I had to simmer the quinoa for 20 minutes instead of 10. Other than that, the recipe is great. I loved the cheese on top.

Used as a base.  First time I ever had/made quinoa.  I used both oyster and cremini shrooms.  Also sauteed celery, green pepper, basil, red onion and lots of garlic before adding it to the quinoa.  I'll use this again.  
The parm cheese gave it that extra kick it needed

This was reduced to 2 servings.  I did leave off the cheese as I used this as a base to serve broiled fish fillets.  The mushrooms add a nice flavor to the finished product.  The cooking time was perfect.

This was my 1st time coking quinoa and I really enjoyed it.  My whole family ate it, including a 3 year old who won't eat rice and 10 month old twins!  I followed the recipe exactly and probably wouldn't change anything. I just need to get used to quinoa and would like to experiment with other recipes.

Like another reviewer said, really it tastes like mushrooms and chicken broth, which don't taste bad...it's just not fantastic. Probably would make again with a lot of add-ins to spice it up!

Excellent recipe!  My first experience with quinoa turned out delicious.  I added about half a cup of frozen spinach towards the end for color.

I am giving this 5 stars because my husband ate it and did not question it although was something new him.  My youngest son asked me how to make it for his girlfriend.  It is a good recipe to make and have as leftovers for other meals throughout the week

Yummy!  We loved this so much that I have started cooking chicken pieces along with the mushrooms and onions to mix in with the Quinoa, and using this as my main dish.

Nice. This is my first time trying Quinoa and it was a great and easy recipe. The only change I made was adding some asparagus to up the veggie content.

I like the idea of mushrooms to make quinoa a more savory dish than a foofy one.  I added some celery leaves to the mushrooms and onions for flavor and tons of pepper but only because I like it that way.  I used veg broth instead of chicken because I am a vegan and obviously no cheese.  I appreciated this recipe most because it got me thinking and on the right track to a delicious winter meal.  Thank you for posting. (by the way, the quinoa did take longer than ten min to cook... almost double that)

My husband and I LOVE this recipe as is. We use very very low sodium chicken broth and its fine. Many friends who profess to HATE mushroom cannot pick them out of this dish, as I chop them very fine...and they LOVED the dish. That's a major surprise to all their friends who know they hate mushrooms

A great base recipe for quinoa.  I simmered mine on low for 15 minutes and let it rest for 5 minutes covered- came out perfect.  I added about 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce to the mushroom, onion and garlic saute and it really adds a ton of flavor.  I've made this twice- once I added frozen peas for color and texture, the last time I added fresh spinach and a can of rinsed garbanzo beans.  It was delicious both times.  You really can add any veggies or beans to it.  The Worcestershire sauce and fresh shredded Parmesan really make a difference.

I made this last night, my hubby loved it.  I added a handful of cherry tomatoes, sliced in half and about two cups of spinach that I needed to use up to the mushroom mixture.  Definitely will make again.

Great tasting recipe, however, it definitely needs some salt, otherwise it is quite bland.  I'm a huge fan of quinoa and try to eat it at least once a week so I was excited to try this!  I made this recipe exactly as written, and agree with the others about 10 minutes being too short of a cooking time. I kept cooking it until all the liquid was absorbed, and at that point (about 20 mins), the quinoa was too mushy. My recommendation is to only use 2.5 cups of liquid and to cook it for 15 mins.  I will definitely make this again with the above changes, and with adding in about 1/4 - 1/2 tsp of salt. A great side to serve with chicken or fish.

I prepared this recipe with only a few minor adjustments.  I cooked my quinoa with 2 cups of chicken stock and 1 TBSP of butter for 15 minutes.  I left it on the stove (off the heat and covered) for 5 minutes before fluffing it with a fork. I then cooked my mushrooms with the dehydrated onion I had on hand and chopped garlic.  I used a bit of bacon grease I had left over from morning breakfast.  I de-glazed the pan with the chicken broth and let it cook down until it was nice and saucy before I added it and the cheese to the hot quinoa.  I must say, while flavorful, this dish is missing something.  What that something is, I don't know, but it needs more spice or something.  I am going to add cooked zucchini and yellow squash next time, and maybe some rotisserie Chicken.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe as is except for using a 10 oz. package of mushrooms. When completed I took half of the mixture and added fresh spinach and cooked until it was wilted. The other half I left alone. I am surprised this recipe gets four stores as written. It is a very bland recipe. I would definitely add double the mushrooms and play around with some herbs. If you like plain foods without spices, you will probably like this. If you like more flavor, this recipe will probably not cut it for you. The half with the spinach was definitely better, but it still needed some other flavors to spice it up a bit.

For those saying the mixture was too soupy, you need to cook the quinoa and chicken broth longer. I cooked mine for 20 minutes and it was perfect.

Really liked this.  Bought a large bag of quinoa and didn't know how to cook it.  I added pesto to the sautee and after browning the quinoa, and adding the broth, I cooked with the sauteed veggies for 20 mins.  Great as a healthier "pilaf." Note:  don't use salt or powdered bullion.  Too salty.

as written, it's a good base recipe - but there's just no wow factor. i love quinoa, i eat it all the time; and the onions and mushrooms were a nice addition...but it just needs "something" to bring it to the next level.

Pretty easy recipe to make. I liked it, but I think I want a little bit more flavor. Next time, I will add a little more cheese than the recipe calls for and maybe add another spice to make it a more complex flavor.

There is no better way to make quinoa.  I use quinoa as a base for a lot of my recipes, and I am told time and time again that my quinoa is better than theirs.  I have shared this recipe with a lot of people - it is really just the best.  I don't change anything from the recipe, it's just perfect.

I liked this more than I thought I would. The only modifications I made were using avocado oil + beef broth. Was great!

I made this tonight and it is so delicious. Yes, I made some changes. I added diced zucchini, 1/2 diced yellow bell pepper that I had left over, and my husband who has a passion for tomatoes, diced 2 organic Roma tomatoes and added them to the mix. This stuff is awesome, quick and healthy meal. Thanks for posting the original recipe.

I thought this was awesome as a main dish or a side.  I used veggie broth instead of chicken broth.  This would be great for vegetarian friends who are coming for dinner!  I can understand adding some other veggies for color though as it looks a little blah.

I followed the recipe as written with the exception of used dried minced garlic because I didn't have fresh.  I found this to be bland and lacking flavor.  I think that I will tweak it and make some changes the next time I make this.  I like it as a basic recipe to build off of.

I've been making quinoa for years and wanted something a little different today. I subbed Earth Balance for the butter and left out the cheese due to dietary restrictions. I scaled the recipe back to two servings, and it still made a lot, and added about six ounces of cremini mushrooms. Although the flavour was very good I found that it didn't look very appetizing. Perhaps some fresh parsley added at the end would improve this. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Great meal! I added ground chicken to make it a more hearty main dish, added a little ground sage and cut way back on the onion to suit my tastes. Delicious - I will definitely make this again!

This is our new go-to side dish.  I make a double batch... I divide the recipe when it's done and mix fresh spinach or a mixture of greens to mine.  My husband has his stash in the fridge and I have mine.  It lasts us  most of the week.  We love it.

It's wonderful!  I was making it dairy free for a friend so I omitted the butter and added a bit more olive oil. Also, I was using leftover cooked quinoa I had made for cookies so it was not cooked in the broth. Still a great recipe. I topped it with fresh parsley and slivered almonds. I WILL make this again and again.

This is a very good basic recipe- also this is my first to try quinoa.  I cannot rate it a five star because I changed it a bit.  I knew that when I read the ingredients, it will taste really great-- not overwhelming with so many ingredients that you won't enjoy the quinoa anymore.  However, I did a little bit of change.  I used dried shiitake mushrooms, (a lot) half a cup of frozen green peas, added a couple more garlic and lessen the broth to 2 1/2 cups.  I did not have chicken broth, so I used the water that I soaked with the dried mushrooms and added half a chicken bullion.  Followed the process but increased the final cooking of quinoa to about 15- 20 minutes at very low fire, stirring it from time to time.  It is delicious!  Wonderful recipe!  You can add another veggie if you want more in there..definitely a winner! Thank you!

This is good and hearty. I didn't toast the quinoa. Next time, I would use water and skip the chicken broth, it overpowers the rest of the ingredients. I used baby portobello mushrooms, yum. 20 mins is closer to the time this has to cook.

Loved this recipe, very flavourful. Next time I will add more mushrooms, since my finance loves them. Important change though, I had to cook the quinoa for about 20-25 minutes.

Some adjustment & it was great!! Used red quinoa which I cooked 20 min with only 2 1/2 c. chicken broth on medium. Added fresh pepper & garlic salt & 1/2 c. of fresh parmesan & 1/4 c. of fresh cilantro.  Everything else was as recipe.  LIKED so much!!

Turned out well, except I should have browned the quinoa longer. I added some salt and pepper along with some rosemary and parsley at the end. Flavors melded perfectly!

Since i'm the only one eating quinoa in my family, I had to adjust the amount of quinoa to broth ratio. I used 3/4 cup quinoa, 1 1/2 cups vegetable broth. I deglazed the pan of mushroom & onion mixture with Marsala wine and seasoned it with salt and pepper. Soooo good! Will definitely make this again!! Yummmm

I have made this recipe twice now.  I've recently started a clean eating diet and this fits right in.  I did change the olive oil and butter to coconut oil (same amounts)and omitted the cheese.  It tasted fantastic!  Thanks for sharing your creation.

I just made this last night and it was great!  My husband & kids loved it...I even surprised myself.  I made it according to the directions, I only doubled the recipe to have lots of leftovers. I did sprinkle on some salt/pepper as it was cooking. I will experiment next time w/other veggies & fresh spinach.  I also used "red" quinoa which was fine. Loved the color! No taste difference from the regular. I will be making this again!

Only one word to add: delicious!! Cut the calories by not using butter and just cooked the quinoa like the package suggests. Also only used about 1tsp. of oil vs. 1 tbsp.

I am surprised to say that I really really enjoyed this! I added 12 ounces of mushrooms instead of 8 and cooked the quiona for about 15 minutes. Possibly a bit more. At 10 minutes it still had TONS of liquid.

I loved this! Followed recipe exact- timing on Quinoa may just depend on how much liquid you like with yours.  I enjoy a little bit of moisture but not soupy.  I probably did mine for 15 and it was perfect! I'm eatting the leftovers now for lunch and it's still really tastey re-heated too!

Great recipe overall. Although when the recipe states to simmer for 10 minutes the owner must have magical Quinoa since it takes just as long as rice (if not longer) to fully cook which took me about 25 minutes total. I am definitely cooking this again and will add things in such as celery, maybe squash as well to give it more flavor and texture.

This was very tasty and my husband and I enjoyed it.  I do think it may have needed just a little more liquid because, even though I simmered on medium low, by the time the liquid was gone/absorbed, the "tails" had not completely come unfurled, which is the sign the quinoa is finished. That aside, this is a very easy and tasty dish.

Very good!!  I did have to cook the quinoa 20 minutes.  Next time I will stir the parm in at the end rather then putting it on top.

This was delicious! I forgot to brown the quinoa first, but prepared it as directed otherwise (had to cook a bit longer without that step). I am just getting used to quinoa, and this is my new favorite way to make it.

This was quite good.  I have cooked with quinoa before, but came across some red and decided to try it out.  I only had 1/2 cup, so recipe was split as such.  Sauteed my garlic and mushrooms with a bit of spray and left out the parm at the end only to save on calories...although that salty/nutty flavour would certainly have added much more flavour - how can you go wrong with adding fresh parmesan?!!!  Will definitely make again!

As is, I gave this recipe 3 stars. It was a little too wet. Might use a variation of this recipe in the future...but probably will not cook it the same as it written again.

I love quinoa and this rocks. You can use this as a compliment dish or use it as a main meatless dish. I served with orange fish and it was great. I will eat the quinoa as my lunch tomorrow as a meatless lunch. Yum!

The quinoa needs to be cooked way longer.  I leave it 13-15 minutes before taking off the lid and adding the mushrooms.
