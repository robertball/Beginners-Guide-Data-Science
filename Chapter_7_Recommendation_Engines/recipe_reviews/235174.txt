Delicious eggs. I ended up using jarred jalapenos since I couldn't find the specified jarred chili peppers. The turmeric really is what flavors these eggs and surprisingly the jalapenos didn't add too much heat. I also made a potato salad with the eggs and it stepped the salad up two notches. It took about a week until I could really taste the flavoring in my eggs.

Woah, these are DELICIOUS, so simple to make and we LOVE the color of them! I've tried another pickled egg recipe before, and I didn't care for them, so I was definitely skeptical of these...To my surprise and delight, these were yummy! Loved the spicy kick and the flavor that the eggs had. I could totally see using these in a salad (though they are great eaten on their own). I made a jar for my dad too, so I'm curious to see what he thinks of them, and I can't wait for hubby to get home to try these... I know he's gonna love them! Thanks for sharing another GREAT recipe, Brian! :) UPDATE: My dad raved over these and hubby and the little guy absolutely LOVED them! Hubby wants me to make more and an extra batch for him to take to work for the guys...This recipe is a winner, Thanks again!

My husband has been asking me for years to find the "just right" pickled egg recipe. I've tried with miserable luck, that is until I tried bd's eggs at the Las Vegas Round Up! Hey, I carted the leftovers home (surprised that were any left!) to California and presented them to my husband, Randy. Bonanza! These were it! I've since made them many time, one dozen at a time. Great for my midafternoon snack or hubbie's cocktail hour appy. I like Marianne's idea for salads, sammies and deviled eggs. Well done, my friend!

There should be a Pickled Eggs Anonymous chapter named after these eggs.  I've never eaten a pickled egg in my life; never knew people actually ate them.  Then I saw all the fuss about this recipe and it buzzed around my head for a while.  Boy, am I glad I listened to all the hype.  I made these with a homemade pickling spice using 36 quail eggs and 1 hen egg.  My picture isn't as pretty as the other but it shows you how many quail eggs will fit in the liquid.  "Refrigerate for at least two days" it says...try making them last that long.  I suggest making these and then immediately abandon the house for 48 hours, only then will you let them rest as long as required.  They are THAT good.  Thanks to bd weld for the recipe and thanks to the other reviewers who convinced me to try these.  Sometimes peer pressure is a good thing. UPDATE: 12.Dec.15- I made these to give as Christmas gifts using all organic ingredients and homemade pickled peppers. Comparing the outcome to when I made this using industrial produced peppers, vinegars, and herbs/spices is like comparing night and day. Amazing, is all I can say. Try these using your homemade peppers and you will see I'm right!

This is a perfect pickled egg recipe!  Just follow the directions!  Don't change a thing!  I used Mezzetta's Hot Chili Peppers.  The longer they sit, the better they get!  I first tasted these eggs at a party hosted for AR members at mauigirl's home in Las Vegas, and I kept telling my husband that he'd like them a lot!  I wasn't wrong!  We ate them plain, on salads, as deviled eggs, and in sandwiches.  Thanks, bd.weld!

I not only got to try these at the PNW AR Round-Up but I graciously got to meet the man himself that submitted these. OH man where they good. I couldn't wait to get home and make these for my hubby. So after I talked to bd_weld about his recipe and telling me I could easily do a dozen, I did a dozen and a half. I'm finding it hysterical on my part when making the recipe, I used the really hot yellow peppers with brine and a pickling mix offered from my store because it was way cheaper then buying the Morton's. Should have gone with that because, little did I realize how loaded with dried whole red Serranos and thought, ohh what the heck, HA!! on my hubby because he said they were fantastic but...WOOO!! what a kick. I ate the yoke out of several and hmm good, so I didn't get the intense heat from the egg whites themselves... he sure did. What a great addition to my household. Will look for the milder hot peppers with brine for the next time for my children. But they seemed to like them as well. TY Brian!! we love it!!!

While my husband thought these pickled eggs were ok, I on the other hand did not like them.

3.28.18  Where have pickled eggs been all my life?  Never grew up eating them, but have developed a taste for them as an adult. (ummm, an older adult).  Excellent balance of vinegar and hot peppers.  And as a bonus, they’re also pretty, good eye appeal.  Don’t make any changes to this recipe because it’s awesome exactly as written.

Made for the PNW Round Up, these eggs were a hit! I didn't think I'd like them as I don't generally like hot foods. However, there is just something about these pickled eggs that I can't stay away from. I ate 3 in row. Yum! They're easy to make and really has a gourmet payoff! My two sons devoured the remainder of them (5 out of 24) after the Get-Together. I'll be making these again and again.

I've been meaning to review this recipe for a while. I love pickled eggs and grew up eating them, but I was used to more of a basic flavor with not much in the way of seasonings.  When I saw this recipe I knew I had to try it. The first time I made this recipe I used whole mild pepperoncini peppers. They added a nice flavor to the eggs and I found the turmeric to be the predominant flavor.  The second time I made the eggs, I used whole hot yellow chili peppers. These added a nice kick to the eggs and the turmeric wasn't as pronounced this time. Definitely some heat there, but not overpowering, but I like spicy.  The turmeric adds a nice color throughout the eggs, while the white wine vinegar tones down the heat and brine flavor with it's sweetness.  I tend to like my pickled eggs with more of a vinegar 'bite' (so I will probably use part white vinegar instead of all white wine vinegar), but that is just personal preference. These are delicious! Your end result will depend on which peppers you end up using, since they vary so much in flavor, and how long you let these sit before eating. A keeper!

If your looking for a run of the mill pickled egg recipe... look elsewhere.  If your looking for something a little different and delicious this recipe is it.  I could only find hot banana pepper rings so that's what I used, otherwise I made these as written. I grew up eating pickled eggs but they certainly never tasted like these. I put the jar of eggs in my other fridge so I could "forget" about them for a few weeks and I am so glad that I did. Great flavour, spicy and not too hot. Thanks bd.weld for sharing.

I don't like pickled eggs. Well, before I made these I didn't, not any longer! These were terrific except for the fact that they weren't hot enough for us. I pickled for 2 days & cut up some of the peppers. Hoping longer will give me what I need, more Heat! Thank you BD, THESE ROCK!!

Poppa picked a peck of pickled eggs. Sorry, been saying that in my head since I put this recipe together 6 days ago! These eggs are A-1! What fun to put together. I couldn't find the hot yellow peppers so I used hot pepper rings. I didn't find the end result too spicy and I must add that I do not like tumeric so I was nervous using it but I found that it blended well with the other flavours. I did enjoy the brine very much and found another way to use it in a Canadian Caesar recipe on this site. I just used a splash. The drink actually pairs very well with this snack.  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/classic-canadian-caesar/detail.aspx Thanks b.d.weld for sharing your recipe!

I have never had pickled eggs before last weekend at the PNW roundup. The recipe creator happened to attend so that was a double bonus. :) These were very good and when I got home, mentioned to my daughter who has chickens, yet another thing to try with her plethora of eggs. She asked me to send her the recipe, thought I would leave a review for them also as long as I was here. Count on me making some of my own. Can't wait to see what it does to a potato salad!

This was so fun!  I loved seeing it "stewing" all week.  I had never had a pickled egg before and I really enjoyed it.  I used sweet cherry peppers due to a lack of choices at my little store.  They are fine, but I am looking forward to a pepper with more heat next time.  I added a few dashes of sriracha sauce because my peppers were so mild.  I'm making deviled eggs tonight, and will chop a few of the peppers into the filling.  Thank you for this great recipe!

I'm a huge pickled anything fan and I wasn't disappointed in this recipe. Super easy to make and a good use for your eggs that are getting a little long on fresh. I did not vary a bit from the recipe except that I did a dozen eggs and used quart jars, 6 in each. Oh, and I've never ever seen white wine vinegar in my store, so I was forced to use red wine vinegar. The funny part to me was that even though I loved the eggs, I did not like the brine. Usually in these recipes, I love the brine so much that I can drink it. But that will not stop me from making this again. I think next time I will increase the vinegar and decrease the water so that I have an even more intensive pickled flavor in the eggs. Thanks bd for a great recipe!

These are EGGcellent! I made as written except that I used quail eggs so that my wait time was not as long and so I'd have bite sized eggs. I had a jar of hot yellow peppers in my fridge that only had one pepper missing. The reason it only had one missing is because they were entirely too spicy to eat and I like spicy. I was afraid it would make the eggs too spicy but not at all. In fact, this recipe actually mellowed the peppers to the point they are edible now. The measurements are spot on in this and the turmeric really adds a unique and tasty  touch. Definitely a keeper for all of you pickled egg fans out there. Thanks for sharing bd.weld!

My whole family loved them. Even the skeptical ones who don't typically like pickled eggs. Wonderful flavor and not too sweet like the last recipe I tried. I think the white wine vinegar it key and the turmeric adds an interesting note. Just delish, I am making another big batch today with the excess of eggs from our small farm. I wonder how long they last but then again it doesn't matter because around here they are gone before you could even bat an eye.

"Popa's Pickled Eggs" are so addictive! Wow! I made my own pickled peppers (Allrecipes, Pickled Hot Peppers, Pam) because I wanted to use a variety of peppers (not just hot yellow peppers). I had enough brine to cover at least 12 eggs. Thank you bd.weld for sharing your recipe.

I had read all the buzz about this recipe but had never eaten  a pickled egg.  I asked my husband and he said oh yeah, he loves them, but hadn't had any for a very long time.  Well, that settled that :)   I followed the recipe to the letter - WOW, these were good!  I've made them twice and both times my husband would see them in the fridge and ask, "Are these eggs ready yet??" Since we like spicy, the hot peppers were perfect and I love the color the turmeric adds.  Thank you bd.weld, for another great recipe!!

I grew up eating pickled eggs.  In fact, my mom has made hundreds of them over the 52 years that her and my dad have been married.  Every Nascar bus trip that my dad has ever gone on (lots) 2 dozen pickled eggs went with him.  So, I was super-excited to make these for him, and of course for me too.  Loved them!  I could not find whole hot yellow peppers, so instead, I used hot ring pepper.  I did let them soak a week before sharing them with my family.  I loved them chopped up in toss salads.  It just added an extra 'umph' to the salad.  The color of the eggs is also quite pretty.  Thanks bd.weld for sharing your recipe.  I'm getting ready to make another batch.

I’ve used this recipe before and liked it very much. This time I doubled the recipe and and prepared  18 eggs in a 46 oz. pickle jar. My only recipe deviation was to wait to add the water until all the other ingredients were in the jar. Then I simply topped the jar off with a lesser amount of water, capped it, and gave it a good shake. During the first week I shook and inverted the jar twice each day. These are great pickled eggs!

I have been making these for a few years since I found this recipe. We love it! Everyone I make them for love them also.
At the holidays I make them into deviled eggs. I pour a very small amount of the pickle juice in the egg mixture.

The recipe was very easy to make, I used a flat of medium sized eggs so I upped the recipe about 1 1/2 times. I will try it in a few days to test it out. I’m going to shake the jar a bit a couple of times a day to make sure the ingredients are all combined

I wanted to pickle eggs just like a Joe Jost! Famous bar in Long Beach, CA.  Well I found it. This recipe is exactly the same.

I really love the color.  I have now made these twice.  The first time I used up a jar of sport peppers in addition to the pepperoncini.  Served the first time at a my chicken wing party, second time was a thank you gift.

Added very little flavor to the eggs, and what little flavor there was I found unpleasant. After eating a couple of them I threw the rest away. Thankfully I'd only made a half batch.

These eggs were delicious. I have a family reunion in about two weeks and will definately serve them. I made no changes to the recipe. I used hot yellow peppers that were sliced.  Awesome recipe

Fantastic, I make them often. I boil the brine "outside" before canning. I cannot stress the importance of boiling outside if you choose to, you will literally mace your house.

AWESOME, AWESOME, AND AWESOME!  I expected these to be good but this went beyond my expectations!  I only wish I had made  them sooner.  I used mild peppers for our senior citizen tummies, but that was my only change.  Thank you Brian for sharing your recipe.   It will see much use at my house.

I am trying to duplicate pickled eggs I had in the past.  This is the closest I got.  I liked these, however, i didn't enjoy the sugar and cider wine with the sweet flavor.  I adjusted it by skipping the sugar, used hot chili peppers instead of yellow peppers and used cider vinegar.  That made it great, and very close to the recipe I tasted before.
