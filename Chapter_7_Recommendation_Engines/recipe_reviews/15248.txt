I made these this year for Christmas. They are quite good---not too sweet--perfect with tea and coffee. I was under the assumption they would turn out looking like Cathedral windows, but they didn't at all. They are just a small round yellowish cookie with bits of fruit and don't look like stained glass or anything. Too bad---that is the main reason I made them. And although they taste good, they were not gobbled up by the family like most Christmas baking. It is January 3rd, and I still have lots of them left.
