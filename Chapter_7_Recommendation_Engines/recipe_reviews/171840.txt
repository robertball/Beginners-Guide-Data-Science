This is my recipe and I tried getting this recipe corrected, but had some trouble. Anyway, some of the measurements are off and I just wanted to correct them. The bacon should be 6 strips and a 1/4 cup gorgonzola. Hope you enjoy it!

I cheated and used a crust I bought cheaply (already rolled out and ready to go, even!) from Papa Murphy's. I used my own homemade barbeque sauce (Bourbon Whiskey BBQ Sauce, which is also from this site), hickory-smoked bacon, and I did not use gorgonzola cheese because my boys don't care for it. I'll tell you, my husband loved this pizza. Really. He actually was bummed there was only one because he couldn't have anymore tonight or leftover for lunch tomorrow. My kids were less than thrilled but just for my husband's excitement, this recipe gets all five stars. He LOVED it.

Fabulous!  I loved the contrast of the Gorgonzola with the BBQ sauce.  I will say though that next time I will use a different BBQ sauce because it was a little too sweet.  Instead of frying up some bacon I used half a package of real bacon bits.  I also made my own pizza crust.  So good and can't wait to make again!

Wow!  I have been making pizza for years, and this is by far the best one I've ever made and possibly the best recipe I've made from this site.  I made my own pizza crust (quick and easy pizza crust recipe from this site), I omitted the jalapeno, and I used yellow onion since I didn't have a red one.  I topped it with a few green onions, and baked it on my pizza stone-a must for pizza making.   Thanks for such a superb recipe!

Wow, this was so good!  I used less bbq sauce then it called for (i just eye-balled it) and substituted turkey bacon for the bacon to make it a *little* bit healthier.  Will for sure be making this again!

Absolutely delicious!  We made just a couple tweaks for personal preference, but we pretty much made this recipe as it stands, and we LOVED it.  (Husband hates strong cheese so we left off the gorgonzola.  [Boo.  I love it.]  We also put some chopped basil on this and substituted turkey bacon for regular.)  One important note:  If you use cheapy, sugary barbecue sauce, you will get a pizza that doesn't taste very good.  We used Jack Daniels bbq, and couldn't have been happier.

Marvelous! True to its name, my hubby loved it! It was a great way to use leftovers from the Sticky Rotisserie Chicken recipe. Like others, I subbed feta for Gorgonzola, omitted the jalapeno and added mushrooms. Hubby doesn't often ask me to make something again, so this one will be a keeper. Thanks!

I love this recipe.  I always use Boboli crust and when I cook the chicken I add garlic and italian seasoning.  I mix about half and half Sweet Baby Rays and Jack Daniels which results in a semi sweet yet smoky base-SO good.  The gorgonzola is a must for me, I just love how all the ingredients blend!  Easy and awesome!

Excellent!  I'm not crazy about barbecue sauce on pizza, but this was an exception.  Just enough to add a little zing without overpowering the taste.  I used pita bread to make individual pizzas instead of pizza dough.

Absolutely delicious!  I made this according to the recipe, minus the Gorgonzola. My boyfriend was so excited when he found out what I was making, and even more excited when he found out the pizza had bacon on it.   I forgot, in my excitement to try the pizza, to add the paprika and garlic powder, but it still tasted fantastic. I used a pre-made crust and Stubbs BBQ sauce. I had leftovers the next day and I was surprised at how delicious it was, even in the microwave! Definitely making this one again.

Made this once, and have continued to make it regularly. Skipped the gorgonzola (not a big fan) and mixed the jalapeno and some garlic in with the bbq sauce. Perfect for a quick dinner- prep is pretty simple.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some gorgonzola cheese so I tried this. I prepared my own crust and did not have any jalepenos otherwise I would have added it and it might have been better.  I thought this was average.  I will not make again.  My husband didn't care for it but my son liked it.

My husband and I did not care for this. We thought it was going to be great because of the ingredients but the BBQ sauce overpowered the whole thing. I followed the recipe to the t and made sure to buy a good quality BBQ sauce but it just was not good. Will not make again.

Very tasty! Used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce and substituted sweet onion because that's what I had on hand.

This was very good and I'm giving it full star rating but next time I make I'll do the following; Try crumbled Feta instead of the Gorgonzola, my hubby didn't like the strong taste of that cheese and I will also try a different BBQ sauce then what I had in the fridge.  I used "Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ" and it was too sweet.  Next time I will try KC Masterpiece (original) cause that seems like a more "smokey" BBQ sauce.  Other than that, it was really good and I made it on a night that my MIL came over for dinner and she said she liked it too.  This is another that will make it onto our normal menu rotation!

This has a become a regular recipe in our house. It tastes just like our favorite takeout pizza, minus the $25 pricetag! It's good with the gorgonzola, but you can skip it and not really miss much. Also, I think red onion is too obtrusive so I use sweet onion instead.

This was delicious!  I used a pre-made flatbread and it was so crispy after cooking right on the grate in the oven.  Careful with the jalapeno's - I used half of one and that was perfect and we like spicy foods. Will make again for sure!

Soooo deliciously good! I made my own bbq sauce and pizza crust using recipes from this site (bonus)! Omitted the gorgonzola, as neither husband or daughter will eat it. Used a combo of mozzarella and cheddar cheeses and shredded chicken I'd poached, seasoned and coated in a mix of both ranch and bbq sauces. For the toppings, I added thinly sliced (raw) onions as well as green onions, mushrooms, pre-cooked bacon pieces, and smoked sun-dried tomatoes. This pizza will definitely remain on our Friday pizza night rotation!

We really enjoyed this pizza and will make it again. The recipe name does not lie. Both my husband and I loved the flavour combinations on this pizza. As it's a pizza, I just eyeballed the toppings amounts. My husband was skeptical about the Gorgonzola as he usually doesn't like strong flavoured cheese but he felt the pizza would be lacking without. This was the same opinion of our pizza night guests. We also served the Easy Tomato Basil Pizza and the Beer Pizza. Both from this site and highly recommended.

Excellent recipe! I made minor changes to suit our tastes. Firstly, I covered the cooked chicken in ranch salad dressing and let it sit for an hour or two, to absorb the flavor and keep it moist. I subbed fresh mozzarella cheese for those listed, and sprinkled with a small amount red pepper flakes in lieu of the jalapeños. For me, between that and the paprika, there was just enough "kick."

This pizza was AMAZING! I did it just to use up some random ingredients we had around the house and I'm so happy I did. My husband said this is one of the best pizzas he has ever had, including professionally made ones, so you know I'll be making it again. 

The only thing I did differently is that I made my own crust. If you're going to spend the time to make such a yummy, fancy pizza, you might as well go all out! I use this recipe which is super simple and always gets me rave reviews: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/quick-and-easy-pizza-crust/detail.aspx
