I tried this recipe because I was looking for different uses of kale.  This hearty soup did not disappoint.  I made the recipe exactly, and it was very tasty.  For my personal preference, I simmered the soup a lot longer (about 15 minutes with the lid off to concentrate the flavor, and then about 20 minutes with the lid on) because even with the tough ribs removed, the kale took a while to become tender.  Additionally, I always cook any soups and pasta sauces ahead of time so the flavors can develop overnight.  It truly makes a big difference, and it's a nice to treat to have lunch or dinner made in advance!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is yummy. Kidney beans definitely work if you need a replacement.  I use a can of diced tomatoes when tomatoes aren't their freshest.  A little parmesan cheese sprinkled over the top makes for good presentation.  I freeze excess and it tastes just as good when reheated.

LOVE IT!!! This is so healthy, low fat and delicious.  I recently bought a high quality pressure cooker and don't know how I survived without it.  I cooked the onions and garlic first and then added the spices and veggies.  I used imagine vegetable broth which is an excellent broth.  Then I cooked it in the pressure cooker for 10 min and so the kale is really soft and all the flavors infused through the soup.  I have never blended beans for soup before and gave that a try and really felt it added something to the soup.  I think it makes it more substantial. I also added a tbsp of fresh lemon juice at the end. My vegetarian daughter is thrilled with this and so am I.

This is really great.  The first time I made it I used collard greens instead of kale because they looked so good at the farmer's market and my boyfriend gobbled it up, despite the fact he normally won't eat things with beans or tomatoes in them.  The second time I added a pinch of cayenne pepper and a blend of collards, turnip greens, spinach and musard greens.  YUM!  It also freezes really well.

It was quite good!  I served it over brown rice instead of as soup.  The only change was that I used canned tomatoes because that is what I had.  One word of advice, chop the kale pretty small because I didn't and I regretted it.

This soup was YUMMY!!!!  My super picky husband actually fought me for the leftovers.  I only changed it a small bit.  I put two cans of beans and added a few cut up carrots.  Also, I substituted Herbs de Provence (with an extra pinch of rosemary) for italian season... its sounds subtle but makes a world of difference.  Also I didn't put quite as much garlic.  Really good with cornbread.

Very tasty. I would only use 3 cups stock and 1 cup water if am to make it again. As you use the liquid from the beans the soup does not need added salt. I did add chilli flakes as another user mentioned as well as oregano. The soup is filling and delicious.

This was really a good surprise.  So easy to prepare and tasting.  I only had one jar of cannellini beans so I pureed that with the broth and for the other can I used garbanzo.

So good!!! Very healthy soup & suprisingly flavorful! I wanted to try kale, but was a bit hesitant to make this soup because it didn't look like it had enough "spice". I was SO wrong. This is a soup I can make again & again. Thank you!!!

What?  Only 5 stars possible?  I made this a while back, but I'm having the last of my frozen leftovers tonight.  This is AWESOME!  It's quick and easy and so tasty and filling!  I made it at the height of a nationwide tomato recall, so I used a can of diced tomatoes...spectacular!  Due to my mood that day, and the availability of hot smoked sausage in my freezer, I added about 1/3 lb of it thinly sliced before I sauteed the onion.  I also added three thinly sliced carrots, just because I am a carrot addict and you can't have too many veggies.  I hate when people completely change a recipe, but those were the only changes I made and I can tell that it would have been great without them.  The only downside to my batch of soup was NOT due to the recipe, but due to my laziness when it came to chopping the kale.  I left it too big to be spoon friendly.  Just letting others know this so they will chop their kale well. Yummy, yummy, yummy, and thank you for this recipe!  LOVE IT!

This soup is very healthy and tastes so great.My husband just loved it.The flavors mingle really well.Mixing part of the beans in a blender gives the soup the nice creamy look and taste.It is a keeper for my family.Chopping the veggies takes a bit of time.So I would recommend using a machine.Double the recipe and freeze the extra.

wonderful recipe. I used Kidney beans, due to the shortage of other kinds. Great chicken soup. I used the slow cooker to cook whole thing. The kale did not look as freshly green as it should ,  but it taste much better. I asked my friend to taste. At the first place, she was suspecticle at it. After taste it, she asked me to give her one quote to bring home for her family.

Flavor was good, but the kale needed to be chopped smaller than I chopped it (I just roughly chopped).  The contrast between the pieces of somewhat chewy kale and the more delicate broth was too much.  Next time I would cut the kale into tiny pieces and possibly blend more of the beans to create a thicker base.

I just made this recipe and it was great! I used canned tomatoes because the "fresh" tomatoes at the store didn't look so fresh. I also used Herbes de Provence because I was out of Italian seasoning, and I threw in carrots because I read other reviews and it seemed like a good idea. Those were my initial changes, but when I gave the soup a taste, it needed something. After some thought, I poured in what I estimate to be 2-3 tablespoons of lemon juice and voila! Success! I also added a bit of garlic salt, but I think I only had to do that because I used a low sodium veggie broth (small note: Imagine organic veggie broth is a favorite of mine, but I'm not a fan of the low sodium version - it's less flavorful all around). I cooked  the soup longer because the toughness of kale bugs me a little and I wanted it to be good and tender. In the end, what my fiance and I wound up eating was absolutely wonderful. We might do it in a crockpot next time - which will be soon!

Delicious & health! I sauted 3 large leeks & 1/2 diced potato with the onion & garlic. I then pureed all of it with 1/2 of the beans & it thickened the soup nicely! I have made this twice now--cooking the kale until really tender takes at least 15 minutes and is worth the wait Great with crusty bread & sliced tomatoes w/balsamic vinegar--yum!

This was FANTASTIC!!! My 3yo and my husband devoured it!

I made a few changes to suit our preferences, but it would be good as written.  I cooked 6 slices of bacon and used the reserved drippings to saute the onion, garlic and kale in.  I used 1 can of tomatoes.  I used fresh/rehydrated beans and skipped the puree step.  I cooked it all in the crockpot on low for 6 hours and squeezed lemon over it to serve.

So good!!! the kale was tender and the bacon gave it some smoke (and credibility for my carnivore husband :)

Easy and good.  I made as directed and tasted - it was yummy (I love all the garlic in it!), but I was wanting a bit more of a tomato flavor so I added a small can of tomato paste and a pinch of cayenne.  Its not pretty, but tastes yummy and makes you feel healthy eating it!  I may add an extra cup of kale next time and maybe a bit of potato.  I cant wait for winter as I bet it tastes even better on a cold, snowy day!

Absolutely wonderful soup!  I used fresh chicken stock though and rather than lug out the food processor, I simply mashed the canned beans with a potato masher (sure saves on clean-up).  Will keep this recipe for another time!  YUM!

This gave me some excellent ideas to create a keeper for us.  I kept the garlic, onion, kale, chicken stock, and white beans and used a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes and a can of crushed tomatoes in place of the fresh tomatoes.  I also added  about half a cup of diced roasted red peppers and omitted the Italian herbs and used smoked Spanish paprika and let the soup simmer for about half an hour.  It's thick, spicy, and delicious!  And I know some of you hate when a recipe is rated when you change the ingredients so, but this one gave me such a great basis, I think it deserves 5 stars!

Decided to rate this 5*. For us, it came up a bit short on flavor, as written, but can be easily adjusted to satisfy personal taste preferences. Added some orange-ginger seasoned salt & shredded Parmesan cheese, and what a difference this made. This is an extremely high nutritional dish with kale being among the top ANDI scorers. I was unsure as to how much chopped kale would equal 4 cups which turned out to be about one bunch if lightly pressed when measuring.

This soup was very good, no mistake about it, but one reason I make homemade soup is that canned soup is so high in sodium. If that's a concern for you too,  consider draining + rinsing the canned beans (they're packed w/sodium). If using canned tomatoes, try the no salt added kind. You can always season to taste later. I didn't make these adjustments the 1st time making this soup, but wish I did. I agree w/other reviewers: 8 cloves of garlic is too much.  I say 2 or 3 is enough without being overpowering. It really was good soup! Definitely worth a try.

Love this recipe. I followed the instructions and the only
thing was I didn't have any tomatoes so, I had to use 
a 1/3 of cup of tomato sauce that I had on hand. I had to use
frozen kale because the fresh was not available at the local
store. I cooked the kale till it was pretty soft and it was already
chopped into bite sized pieces so, that was a time saver. Thanks, for
a healthy and delicious recipe.

A tasty and easy-to-make soup.  I used chick peas instead of beans, didn't bother to puree and it was great!  I've never used kale before, and followed the advice to chop it small.  I also cut out the stems.  I made it vegetarian & vegan  by using my favourite boullion cubes instead of chicken broth.   It was really good and I'll definitely make this soup (and use kale) again.

Delicious. As other reviewers have mentioned, be sure to chop the kale fine as it is a fairly tough green, and I also cooked it longer, again because it was still tough after 15 minutes. It did lose it's beautiful bright green colour but at least it was softer. Flavour of this soup is fantastic. I used white kidney beans as I couldn't find the ones asked for. Worked great.

So good and so healthy! I used way more kale so I increased the amount of chicken broth. Otherwise did not change a thing. Served with some percorino romano and red hot pepper flakes sprinkled on top. Delicious!

Fantastic. Made it twice so far, following the recipe almost exactly (I used cherry/grape tomatoes that I had from the garden, and ran them through the food processor.) I also used 2C homemade chicken broth, and 2 boullion cubes.   It's perfect as a meal if served with good bread. I'd also recommend melting a slice of Swiss cheese on top, if you want to make it fancy.

For me this soup lacked flavor. To save it I tossed in fresh green beans, roasted carrots, more fresh herbs and some leftover pasta.

Very nice, light and healthy soup. I used garbanzos and diced potatoes because I didn't have white beans at hand.

I love this soup. It's healthy and simple to make. I used 1 can of diced tomatoes and added a little basil and oregano. I also grated pecorino romano cheese to the soup in my bowl and it was perfect.

Yum!  I have made a lot of different soups with a white bean and kale base, and loved the idea of blending some of the beans to give it a creamy look... And it was amazing & froze well.  Great soup- we will definitely make again.

Okay, I've made a lot of soup recipes from this site, as well as kale recipes too.  I think this one can easily top them in both categories.  I had fresh onions, kale, and parsley from my mom's garden so I decided to whip it up.  I halved the recipe but kept the broth the same.  It was the easiest, simplest and healthiest soup I've ever had!   The kale tasted amazing!!!! It wasn't tough or rubbery.  The only thing I did was to cook it for longer (about 1.5 hours on low).  I like my soups to be cooked slow and simmering.  Will keep making over and over.

I love this soup. It is so healthy and flavorful. Kale might discourage some from making this, but I assure you that you'll be glad if you do. Kale is a popular staple at local farmer's markets here in Seattle. It is full of fiber and nutrients. I top this soup with parmesan cheese and sometimes add an extra can of mashed canellini beans for extra creaminess. Thanks for a great recipe!

I was pleasantly surprised by this too!  I used canned tomatoes and bigger cans of beans than it called for.  I expected the kale to wilt more like spinach, but it held it's shape, so be sure to chop it as small as you want it to be when you eat it (I left mine too big).  Otherwise it had great flavor.

Very good, satisfying soup!  I added a pinch of red pepper flakes for a little extra zip!  The tomatoes add a touch of sweetness, the kale was kind of crunchy, and the beans were soft and mellow.  All the garlic gives an extra kick to the nutrition.  I used the vegetable broth, and this was just right for a chilly Sunday evening.  Very easy to put together.  Thanks!

I have tried this recipe as is and it was pretty good. Definitely not something you will feel bad about after you eat it. However, I am a full blooded Portuguese female so I made this recipe a little more authentic the second time around. I used a cup of crushed canned tomatoes in place of the plum tomatoes, kidney beans in place of the white beans, and also threw in a couple of cubed potatoes, a hand full of orzo and added a little acidity with a splash of vinegar. I would definitely recommend this version if you are a person who like flavor and wants something a little more filling. Otherwise, the original version above is a very simple/healthy yet yummy soup :)

I was not into this at all.  The kale was too chunky and the soup too boring.  The garlic flavored up the broth a good amount, but the soup just didn't excite either of us.

I needed to cook this soup much longer than suggested for it to develop a really good flavor, but eventually it turned out nice and flavorful. I added some little round noodles and also more veggies like carrots, broccoli, and celery. This made for a really hearty soup.

Great basic kale and bean soup. I added extra liquid because I added elbow pasta in the last 7 minutes to make it more substantial. I also sauteed my onions for a few minutes before adding the garlic.

Followed recipe as listed except used dried oregano in place of italian herbs and added a touch of fresh dill.  Also added some pasta at the request of my hubby.  This basically tasted like a typical minestrone soup with the addition of kale, so we both liked it.

Rave reviews all around! So tasty and nourishing! I made this soup twice - once with 2 cans of canellli beans, and once with 1 can chick peas + 1 can kidney beans. Both are delicious. Instead of plum tomatoes, I used a can of diced tomatoes with oregano and basil - gave the broth some extra savoriness. I'm about to forward this recipe to my mother and my best friend!

This was easy and tasted so great!  I chopped the kale in a food processor which made it easier for the kids to eat.  I also doubled up on the liquid, which was a big help.  This one is entering the rotation!

GREAT WITH HAM ADDED, TOO
This soup is hearty, and delicious! I will return to it again and again. It's easy and quick to make but tastes like a more complex recipe. I used 1 can of cannellini beans and 1 can of white beans. I didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand, so used canned diced tomatoes ("italian"--with garlic, oregano and basil.) I used 1 cup more kale, too--and added diced ham. I simmered without lid for 15 minutes, and with lid for 20 to better blend the flavors, and also added a dash of cayenne pepper.

SO good. I can't cook at all but now everyone thinks I can, after this soup! I didn't have a blender so I added hummus instead of the bean/broth mixture, and it was great. I also tried using 2 types of kale and it was even better.

I washed the kale several times & removed the leaves from the center stalk. As I omitted the dried Italian herb seasoning (due to family preference), I added some crushed red pepper flakes for flavor.  If the soup's too thick, just add more  broth.  I sprinkled parmesan on top at the table too.  You probably could substitute escarole for the kale as well if you wanted to vary the recipe.

I would double this for our family and serve it with bread.

Also, do not add the garlic to the pan until after the onion has turned brown and then just for a couple of minutes. 

You may also substitute a 14oz. can of diced tomatoes for the plum tomatoes.

Everything else was very good and flavorful.

Since we took part a CSA this year, we've had far more kale than we've seen in our lives. This recipe is great for annihilating it. I usually add 1-2 cans of diced tomatoes rather than fresh, and throw in some chopped zucchini. I seem to add red pepper flakes to everything because I like the heat, and this get a teaspoon as well. The flavor is great, and my husband inhales it.

This soup is fantastic (I'm eating a bowlful right now).  The only thing I did differently was to drain and rinse the canned beans but, other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  It couldn't have been tastier.

Excellent soup!  It has a great thick stew-like consistency thanks to the pureeing step (genius). This could definitely be "meat-ified" with ham, chicken, or sausage for those of you with men in your lives, but I liked it just how it was in all its veggie glory.  Make sure you have some crusty bread on hand to dip in it and I loved the addition of some crumbles of goat cheese on top, but parmesan is also great.  I added a few sliced carrots and loved them in the soup, but I didn't care for the tomatoes too much.  I was more liberal with the spices than called for and since I like food with bold flavors, I also added a dash of red pepper flakes and a couple of bay leaves (I think they improve any soup).  Make this on a cold day for instant healthy comfort on a spoon.

This soup is a revelation. I wanted to try kale, and this is an easy way to get started. Blending some of the beans gave the soup a wonderful texture; this is a trick I'll use in other soups in the future too. I read some of the reviews that said it was bland -- not so! I like things very flavorful and I thought this was fine. I did add a little lemon juice at the end, and cut the italian seasoning in half per other reviewers' recommendation. I will make this again--soon!

I loved this, but it did take me a while to get the seasonings up to snuff at the end. Probably because I use sodium-free broth. So, after about a teaspoon of bacon salt and a teaspoon of garlic/wine seasoning and a bunch of plain salt plus two teaspoons of vinegar. It tasted delicious!!

I used chicken broth, a leek instead of the yellow onion and "pulsed" my kale in the food processor instead of chopping it larger. The soup was incredibly good. I would absolutely make it again, especially since Kale is one of the top foods you can eat nutritionally. Wish I hadn't waited to try it so long!

Fast and yummy. I was running low on garlic so I added some garlic powder too and it tasted great. Looking forward to trying it again with 8 LARGE cloves of garlic.

I made this soup last night, and it was awesome! I was surprised at how flavorful it was. One adjustment -- I didn't have enough plum tomatoes in the house, so I added a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with jalapenos instead. It tasted great and has a bit of heat to it. We will definitely be making this again.

This is a quick soup and can easily be turned vegetarian (for Lent's Fridays) by subbing vegetable broth.

I liked how the soup became 'creamy' with the addition of the blended cannellini beans and broth.

Very yummy soup...love pretty much any soup with beans and I had some kale to use up, so wanted to give this one a try!  I used a can each of chick peas and white kidney beans as they were all I had.  Subbed the Italian herbs for Herbes de Provence and added in some crushed chili flakes for a kick :)  Great soup for lunch or dinner - wonderful for leftovers too!

This is very good.  I did not plan on liking it because I love Zuppa Toscana which this is close to but without the potatoes and cream.  And I'm not a fan of cooked tomatoes.  I really liked this soup!  I added a 1/2 pound of homemade Italian sausage and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  I also used fresh spinach instead of kale.  I will be making this again.  Yum!

Made this last night for dinner as written. Simple soup to make. Wife and I both thought it was excellent!. Next time I'll try some variations such as adding collard or mustard greens, garbanzo beans, etc.

I gave this 5 stars but would have given it 10 if I could. This soup is amazing! I added some of my homemade mini turkey meatballs for some added protein. Other that I followed it to a T and it was AWESOME! Super healthy too...gotta love that! Thank you for sharing.

Super Easy, filling, healthy and great for families on a budget.  I added Bow Tie pasta and topped with fresh grated Parmesan.  This way we ate it for 2 meals.  My toddler ate a whole bowl!!!

You just don't want the bowl to end!  We are vegetarians, so I used a homemade bouillon powder I got from bluedogblog and it turned out just right.  (Plus, the nutritional yeast in the bouillon mix added some good protein, vitamins and minerals!) The one thing I must say is that this recipe does NOT feed 8 adults--more like 4 with no seconds.  If you eat soup as your main course like my family, plan on doubling it and triple for guests.  Thanks, Jean, for the great recipe I will make again and again.

This soup is fabulous and I make a new batch at least 2 or 3 times a month. Even the meat-and-potatoes boyfriend finds this supremely satisfying when served with some savory muffins. Even though we're garlic lovers, I cut the amount of garlic in half and added 3 or 4 sliced carrots. I use a can of diced tomatoes instead of the romas, and as another reviewer suggested, Herbes de Provence instead of Italian seasoning -- gives it a very sophisticated flavor. Sublime!

This is delicious! I made some alterations & made it in my 4 qt slowcooker/crock pot: sauteed garlic and onions, then added all the ingredients to the slowcooker for 8 hrs on low. Other changes: added 5-6 plum tomatoes, used 2 c. dried beans that were soaked overnight, and added 1 c. chopped carrots. Used fresh oregano & dried basil instead of the Italian seasoning, and added extra kale. It was healthy and yummy- perfect with crusty bread, croutons, or a sprinkling of parmigiano reggiano.

Very good, even better the next day after the flavors had more time to marinate. I initially did not add salt after reading comments about the saltiness of kale, but ended up sprinkling a dash on every bowl. Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

This soup is really great! Make sure you get the reduced sodium chicken broth (kale is very salty). I added some tofu for an extra protein punch.

Easy, delicious and healthy.  I ended up using left over kale from the "kale stir fry" recipe (which I didn't like) and it turned out fine.  This soup is hearty and surpisingly good.  Would be even better (but not as healthy) if you add some kielbasa.

First off,I loved this recipe. I added a few of my own touches to it but, followed the basic steps. I diced and cooked up two chicken breast and, because I'm a tomato lover I used a can of Italian style stewed tomatoes instead of the plum tomatoes. For the thickening sauce I used a third can of beans mixed with another can of Italian style stewed tomatoes and, the remaining amount of my broth...it came out perfect...it was just what I needed for the cold Michigan weather..

I took this recipe and used it liberally. I had dried black beans on hand which I boiled in slightly salty water until done. In another pan, I sauteed some italian sausage and garlic. Then I added a quart of chicken broth, leftover cabbage, carrots, some potatoes, chopped hot peppers and cooked til potatoes and carrots were soft. Simple, cheap, healthy.

Excellent, hearty soup!! I added 3/4 packet of chicken bouillon powder, a hint of red pepper flakes and oregano in addition to the Italian seasoning. I also used about 4-5 tablespoons of canned diced tomatoes since I didn't have fresh tomatoes on-hand. I used garbanzo and cannellini beans and chicken broth.

Super flavor and easy soup and just gets better overnight.  I subbed canned diced tomatoes for the roma (out of season), skipped adding salt since I didn't drain and rinse the beans and skipped blending because I like a brothy soup and why dirty a blender.  Had it again for breakfast, definitely a keeper.

Huge fan of this soup! My brother and pregnant sister-in-law were coming over for dinner with their three year old, and my husband and I are vegetarians. My brother gave the kale a look as if I had dropped a mouse into his soup, but after one bite, he was hooked. All the adults ended up going back for seconds, and in my proudest moment of the night, the three year old tried her mom's soup and declared "Oh mama, I like this!"

I followed the recipe pretty closely. We are huge garlic fans, so the amount requested was not too much for us, although we do typically use more garlic than many recipes call for, so if you are sensitive to garlic - consider using less. I also added in 8oz of crimini mushrooms and one can of diced tomatoes at my brother's request. For broth, I prefer the Better Than Bullion "No Chicken Base" for vegetarian soups. It has a much better flavor than many mushroom based broths, and a little goes a long way!

I let the soup simmer about 30 min instead of 15, but it was still pretty tasty at 15 minutes. 

We topped ours with a few scallions instead of parsley, and we served this with a crusty sourdough bread. The next day - the leftovers were even tastier!

Very very good, especially given how healthy it is.  I think I would tweak it some next time though - perhaps a little more tomato, a little more beans and maybe a little less garlic (just by a bulb or 2.  I love garlic but found the taste in this soup slightly overpowering.)

Someone brought this to a church function and shared the recipe with everyone.  I really loved it and assume that she made it as written.  I will certainly be making this one for the family!
Update 2/16/13:
I finally made this for my family and it was delicious!  The only change I made to the recipe was that I rinsed and drained the cannellini beans.  To make the meal a little more substantial, we served it with quinoa (the two mixed together tasted fabulous!).
My 5 year old said, "That was definitely a 5 star meal!"

My first thoughts before I ever made this recipe was that this is going to be nasty. I don't like beans. I'm not fond of greens in my soup. But when I made it, WOW. It's a really good soup! 3 out of 4 of my kids even ate it! I'll definitely make this again when I have extra kale. One thing I did do differently, I added more chicken broth and shredded chicken breasts because my husband won't eat a meal without meat.

Really tasty!  Bf and I made this soup but changed it to add a package of bacon:  So instead of using any olive oil we just chopped up the bacon and let it fry for a bit, and added the rest of the ingredients more or less as the recipe instructed.  I did add maybe 3 cups more water to the recipe in addition to the chicken soup to make it more soup-y, because we had a lot of kale, and the bacon.  In the end we only used one can of white beans (not sure what kind), and let the soup simmer for maybe an extra 20 or 30 min to thicken it a little.  Didn't do the blending.  Flavor was great :)

I search for simple and delicious recipes.  This one's a keeper!  I added chopped carrots, and simmered a piece of Parmesan rind in it for added flavor.  Topped with shredded Parmesan.  
Half of my family eats meat, so I browned some Italian turkey sausage in a separate skillet, then they added it to their own bowls.

This soup was really not good. It is healthy, but the seasoning is completely overwhelming! It tastes like water flavored with rosemary and there is strong grassy aftertaste with the parsley. I do not suggest adding it. I never put crackers in soup, but had to add quite a few butter crackers to make this palateable.

Add a cup of quinoa! I used this recipe to modify the recipe that came on the back of my "Bob's Red Mill" 13 bean soup, which called for 1-1.5 Tbsp Chili powder as the seasoning. Final combo-recipe worked out great. Thank you, the Kale and the garlic (I ended up using a whole head) helped turn it into a lovely flavorful vegetarian meal - my husband was impressed with all the flavor, despite no hamhock/chickenbroth!

I love this healthy soup.  I had some kale and low-sodium chicken broth that I needed to use.  The only change I made was a little veggie broth because I ran out of chicken broth. 
I will be making this soup again and again because it is the perfect batch to make on Sunday for lunches through the week.  
Tip: it is much better the 2nd and 3rd day, if you can keep people from eating it before then.

So good and perfect for a cold Winter night!  Used 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh and added diced fresh carrots and celery.  Also, cooked a little longer than suggested.  Love the idea of blending a some of the beans!  Delish.

Wow, excellent and healthy! Super yummy! I used a can of crushed tomatoes as I did not have fresh on hand. Was not sure about the tomato flavoring until the second day when all the seasonings had time to mingle -- excellent from day 2 and on. Added 4 chopped carrots for added veggies and 2 stalks of celery chopped too! Used Herb de Provence seasoning as others had suggested -- excellent addition instead of italian seasoning!. Had to simmer the soup longer to get my Kale to the desired tenderness!! Will make again and again!

This is a solid base recipe. I didn't give it 5 stars because I tweaked it enough that it became my own recipe. But know that you can start with these basic ingredients and proportions and make a delicious soup.

Awesome! Followed some suggestions and served with Parmesan cheese, cooked a bit longer. I added carrots, celery, and chicken. Otherwise, kept it pretty much the same. Very yummy and simple! Great way to use kale.

This is one of the very few recipes that I will not make a single change to in the future.  Our new favorite soup!  Had to insist everyone try that first bite but after that they finished the first bowl and all requested more.  Thanks so much for sharing!!

I made this soup because my bf and i are trying to be healthier and are on a kale fix.  It's actually pretty delicious for a healthy soup.  I wish I listened to previous reviewers and cut the Italian Herb seasoning to half, it was a little overpowering.  Enjoy! :)

My husband and I loved this healthy recipe! I added red pepper flakes for some zing. For those who need some meat in their soup, I cooked up Italian chicken sausage and meatballs on the side and let people add them to their soup bowls if they wanted. Yum!

This is such a great recipe. I used a can of mixed beans and that was really good. I didn't have any fresh tomatoes but I did have some leftover stewed tomatoes that were spiced with cumin and some chilis so I threw that in and hoped for the best. It actually worked out really well. It's good with a bit of a kick! Add some noodles, and you have a sort of minestrone (at least that's what it reminded me of). This is a keeper!

This is delicious! I had leftover kale from a different recipe and had to find a way to use it. What a way! What I did differently was to add a package of Italian chicken sausage, diced. I sauteed the sausage with the onions and garlic. Because the sausage took up a lot of space, it didn't look soupy enough, so I added an additional cup of broth. I didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand so I used a can of diced tomatoes (undrained) and only had one can of cannellini beans, so I used adzuki beans for the rest. I also followed the advice of another reviewer and simmered for 15 minutes uncovered followed by 20 minutes covered. I will be making this again and again. Huge hit here with my 4 kids who usually won't touch soup, let alone kale!

I love this soup.  I have made it from fresh kale and from greens that I had sauteed and frozen, and it is so good each way.  I've also made it from canned beans and tomatoes and from soaked dried beans and fresh tomatoes.  The flavor is great and it is hearty and filling.  Sometimes I add meatballs for my meat-loving husband and children, but it is equally good without.

I was very disappointed in this soup!  I feel like I wasted the ingredients overall.  WAY TO MUCH garlic and Italian seasoning.  No depth of flavor.  Kale was no asset, spinach would be much better.  I won't be making this again.

I loved this.  Much more than I thought I would.  My kids liked the broth, but not to fond of the kale.  I may try with spinach added at the end.  Really good-this is one I will make again.  Really easy too.

My husband wanted a bean soup and he absolutely loved this.  Not your typical heavy bean soup recipe. The only change I made was I used swiss chard instead of kale since that's what was on hand and it was great.

Really good basic soup. Kept it vegan. Added chick peas but will play around with black-eyed and cannellini. Even with homemade veggie stock, it tasted good. Nice way to start the fall season.

This soup was so yummy!  It tasted like something they would serve up on the soup menu at Olive Garden.  I should've made bread to go with this though because its so low-cal that we were starving an hour later!

We loved it (even my six year old daughter)! A great way for my micro-family to try kale for the first time. I used garbanzo beans because we love them so much,  canned tomatoes as others have noted, and added a carrot. I also took the advice of previous reviewers: chop kale finely (really fine!), simmer uncovered for 15 min or more to concentrate flavor, and add a squeeze of fresh lemon to serve. Keep the pepper low and leave out parsley for the kiddos, and I also used less garlic (4 cloves not 8) and less onion (1/2 instead of a whole one). Still turned out very flavorful.

One of the best soups I've ever tasted!  Even better when you use pre-cooked dried navy beans instead of canned.  Also, kale is supposed to be one of the top- ten foods for women, so I've read.

Delicious.  I made mine with 1 can of navy beans, and 1 can of cannellini beans (aka white kidney beans).  Also, I used beans that had no added salt.  It was really delicious.  Will definitely make again.

Great recipe!  I don't usually do well on first attempts at new recipes, but this came out surprisingly well.  This was actually pretty easy to pull off, and by all accounts Kale is incredibly healthy for you.  
A variation I've since tried is to use two cans of cannellini beans in the soup itself, and blend at least half a can or more into the remaining chicken broth before pouring it in.  It thickens the soup a little more, which is how I like it.  If that's not your thing, the existing recipe is good too.

A good, healthy soup that is pretty filling. Reminds me of a minestrone. I doubled the kale and used canned diced tomatoes. I added some red pepper flakes to give it a little kick.

This is my favorite soup! I do make one major change though and it's that I add ham. The ham lends awesome flavor to it. I don't add the tomato but instead add some carrot slivers and sometimes potato.

This is amazing soup. I kept making "nummy" noises as I ate it. The only changes I made was to add some kielbasa; 2 hot-dog sized links that were chopped pretty finely. I also used one can of diced tomato instead of the plum tomatoes. Used mostly red kale since the regular green kale in my supermarket was not in good shape.  I think this could use a third can of white beans. Make sure the kale is nice and tender before adding the whole beans, because the beans will break down pretty quickly and you want some whole beans for texture and flavor. Boy I loved this after being snowed in yesterday. Delicious.  Thanks for an exquisite recipe.

Great recipe.  It would probably be very tasty as is but I did change a few things.  First of all I added a hot pepper, 2 carrots and 2 yukon gold potatoes to the onion, kale and garlic and fried those together for about 10 minutes.  I mixed the tomatoes and let that cook a while before I added the broth. This mixture I simmered for about 15 minutes before adding the blended mixture.  It was spicy and delicious. Next time I will probably add another can of beans to the blender mixture to give it a thicker consistency.

Very, very good soup!  Everybody enjoyed it.  I forgot the parsley the second time I made it and thought it was just as good, if not better.  (You can taste the kale more without the parsley, in my opinion).  Definitely a new favourite! Mium.

Don't know what to do with kale? This is it! This delicious, warms-the-soul soup goes very well with cornbread. I feel healthy after eating it! I like the variety of vegetables, which you can substitute for other vegetables you have on hand. (I used a large garden-variety tomato and red onion instead of yellow.)

I'm giving this a 5 star recipe, even though my hisband thought it was a 3, and my daughter refused to even taste it, because I absolutely loved it. It is filling, healthy and esy to make, and perfect for me when made with vegetable broth. The only change I made was to omit the parsley at the end. A soup with so much green already doesn't really need it, in my opinion. I served it with freshly grated parmesan at the table for sprinkling, which added a wonderful flavour, and with easy beer bread mix, from this site. Thanks so much!

Adjustments I made: used  6 oz. red wine in place of same amount of broth; used water because I had no broth; used only 4 cloves garlic instead of 8 and added garlic powder; used 2 T. tomato paste when sauteing onions and garlic; omitted parsley. It came out fabulous and very hearty. Used cayenne instead of red pepper flakes. NOTE: I agree with another reviewer - this made only 4 hearty servings, not 8 when used as a main dish.

The second time I made it came out even better. Used one cup white wine (pinot grigio) and 4 cups chicken broth. Drained and rinsed great northern beans prior to using. Omitted parsley and italian seasoning (didn't have any) and used fresh cut up large tomatoes ~ 1 cup and white onions.

I am trying to eat healthier but without loosing flavor, and this definitely did the job! The only thing i changed in this recipe was the addition of carrots and black olives!I will definitely be making this again in the near future! I will be more patient this time, though and let the soup simmer a lot longer than 15 minutes, though, as suggested by others.

This was delicious - even my carnivorous husband liked it.  I did add some chicken to it, and used black beans b/c that was what I had on hand.  I added some egg noodles and carrots as well.  I pureed half of the black beans and a few of the carrots, and that gave a nice consistency.

This soup was easy and delicious.  I have never eaten kale before but could not pass it up on the BOGO sale this week.  I added carrots and celery as I wanted to use up these ingredients.  I also used dried beans, canned tomatoes, dried parsley, and herbes de provence as I had these ingredients on hand.  I added a little garlic salt and a few dashes of hot sauce as I was afraid the soup might taste like kale or be flavorless.  As other reviewers have said, it really is good!  I had it with 1/2 of a sandwich for lunch and it was very filling.

I love this soup! I combined this recipe with the Cannelini Bean with Flat Leaf Kale soup.  I used chopped turkey kielbasa and a cup of chopped carrots and a can of diced tomatoes for ease.  I omitted the onion and used four or five cloves of garlic. I also added a cup of ditalini or other small pasta at the end which I really thought made the soup.  I made this for a light post Christmas dinner and everyone loved it.

This was so good even my veggie-avoiding husband raved about it. I didn't have onion, but I used fresh Italian parsley for the seasoning and substituted black beans and garbanzo beans instead of white beans. I mashed the garbanzos with a potato masher to keep the consistency a little chunky, and simmered for 45+ minutes on very low heat. It turned out fantastic.

This was very easy to make and so tasty. My husband doesn't like kale and he loved it. The tomatoes were a very nice touch. I added carrots and celery just for more veggies and simmered the soup a little longer than called for so the kale would be more tender. This is definitely a keeper and will be regular in my family. Thank you for sharing!

Looking for a use of Kale, found this recipe quite good. I used canned tomatoes for simplicity and added cayenne pepper & garlic salt for added flavor. Also used 1 can Great Northern beans for soup base and used 1 can vegetarian beans & 1 cup broth blended to thicken soup. Still looking for more zest or flavor, I then added 1 can of Hot Chili Beans. Good recipe!

This was a good hearty soup. I did not blend the extra beans and broth, instead I added a couple table spoons of flour to thicken the broth. I used veggie broth and all dried herbs. Great soup, I'll make it again. Thanks.

YUMMY!  I made this soup last night using a combination of turnip, collard, and mustard greens fresh from our garden, along with a quart of canned tomatoes from this past summer.  I also added about 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, as suggested by another reviewer.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly (with all that garlic!).  I don't know if it would be as good with kale since that green has less pungent flavor than the greens I used--with the combo I used the soup had many LEVELS of flavor!

This soup was alright, but it just wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be, since its so healthy.  Maybe it was the fresh parsley, that seemed to be all I could taste. I've also never had kale before so maybe its an aquiered taste. My husband, however, actually had seconds which surprised me.

This soup is great! I followed the recipe with the exception of two things: I didn't use the italian herbs (didn't have any) and I stuck the kale in the food processor (the smaller you can get it the better). Instead of the italian herbs I added a spoon full of red chili paste (I used Thai Kitchen's) which gave it a more interesting flavor and the slightest bit of a kick. All over a wonderfully healthy meal!

I don't think I have ever had a bad soup, as I love 'em all.
This was good. I didn't puree any as I didn't feel like going thru an extra step(maybe next time). I added carrot and zucchini(had to use up) and a little spinach as well. For spices I just added some basil, oregano and a mixed seasoning. For the tomatoes I added a can of diced(drained).

It had way too much Italian spice and I didn't even put as much as it listed.  It was also a pain to use the blender etc., It just wasn't good.

This recipe is fantastic. I use 2 types of beans for variation and some color. I also added a 6 oz. package of spinach .( Make sure you drain the spinach well or it can overpower the flavor of the soup)It is loaded with vitamins. My wife calls it "Resturant Quality". Will make again and again.

This was very good as written, although I did not blenderize the second can of beans as described.  The recipe is even better when you add 1/2 pound of sliced keilbasa sausage (low fat is fine), sauteed and tossed on top of the soup before serving.  Another good addition is a cup of heavy cream stirred in just before serving.

I have used this recipe since I saw it in an article on eye health. It is one of our favorites. I sometimes substitute one can of Dark kidney beans for one of Cannellini and I blend the kidney beans for thickening. It varies it a little and is just as great. We love it either way.

This is one of five favorite recipes I found on this site..  It is a ten star recipe!  It fits all dietary purposes.  The only thing we tweaked was adding a bit of fresh lemon juice to it at the end.  Thank you for sharing.

I loved this recipe. I added about a tablespoon of cumin, a little extra chicken broth, and some rotisserie chicken.  It's a great hearty, and savory soup.

Awesome! I changed it all and it was restaurant  worthy! I started with a pound of local sweet Italian sausage. Then I added a large onion, all the garlic and eventually 6-8 cups of kale. Wilt the kale good! Then I added 6-8 Roma tomatoes, 7-8 cups of broth, Italian seasoning, two cans of white beans and one can pureed. Amazing!

This is really good.  I don't post reviews very often, but this is definately worth making.  I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh and frozen chopped kale instead of fresh, these changes made it even easier to make.

Very good.  I used 1 can cannellini beans, 1 can kidney beans and 1 can black beans, all low sodium.  Also added about 3/4 lb. of ground chicken and substituted herbs de provence for the italian seasoning.

I started with a rotisserie chicken carcass and made my own chicken broth then added the meat off the bone. Then proceeded with the soup as the recipe is written.  Very good!

Fantastic soup met rave reviews!  Minor personal tweaks: added some rainbow swiss chard & about a 1/2lb of sweet bulk sausage.  Sub: 26oz box of POMI chopped tomato since I didn't have the fresh plum tomato.  GREAT FLAVOR - ready for leftovers!

Sooo delicious. The only change I made was I used less garlic, about 4 cloves, and added 3 carrots and about 1 cup of broccoli. Also I added a few dashes of red pepper flakes. Super healthy, beautiful and delicious.

The key to kale having a nicer texture is to massage it (seriously....google it..haha) about five minutes before preparing the recipe.  Other than that, I followed Marim's tip and used a little extra garlic and a small can of diced tomatoes in place of the plum tomatoes. YUM!

Do yourself a favor and add the cayenne pepper at the end as someone suggested. The soup was good but the Cayenne pepper gave it that special kick. I would've never expected for it to make such a profound difference. I also put a parmesan rind in the soup and didnt blend it because I was too lazy. Will make it again.

Love this soup!!  I didn't have any plum tomatoes so I substitutted with a 28 oz. can of crushed plum tomatoes and it worked out great!!  Also, didn't have fresh parsley so I used about half cup of dried parsley.  Soup was delicious!!

I changed this recipe by using yellow plum tomatoes. I also used red leaf lettuce in place of kale. 

I added a few chopped radishes and some snap peas about 5 minutes before finishing. After tasting I added some cayenne pepper and it blended well.

Great Recipe. I used 2 cans of tomatoes instead of fresh. One spicy, one regular. It was really good!! My kids even liked it. I would chop the kale pretty small. Big pieces can be tough, even after simmering for 30 minutes.

My family ate it and fought over who was taking the leftovers for lunch.  Didn't have tomatoes so used seasoned petite diced can tomatoes.  Also cooked longer then the time specified to make sure the kale was tender.  Also drained the beans don't like to use that juice in the can.

Super yummy!  I diced up three pieces of bacon and used the fat to do my sautéing in.  Adds an extra layer of goodness. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was great!

Delicious! My husband usually hates kale but enjoyed it so much! I did not tell him what it was until after he had a SECOND helping! Said it did not taste like kale at all!! A definite winner! The only change I did was that I rinsed my beans before adding-I usually do-and added a can of petite diced tomatoes.

We had a pretty long and sporadic winter this year in Washington, D.C., and while I was on a kale binge (with tons left over from a salad), I decided to search out a soup involving the green superfood. I stumbled across this highly reviewed recipe and I was more than impressed. I love how the soup depends a lot on the natural flavors of the vegetables (and how much better does it feel to pick and chop your own veggies? Fresh.). My only addition to this recipe was a couple chopped carrots to add to the heartiness of the soup, although I am really curious about adding butternut squash. My boyfriend loved it, and my little brother, not too fond of kale, ate it without any comments on the kale other than the soup being good. Heartwarming dish for the winter, or for an easy dish that can be eaten throughout the week. Great with bread.

I made this exactly the way it was written and it was a huge hit with my entire family!! (Actually, I take that back...I added a little turkey sausage for my husband who thinks a meal isn't complete without meat!)

I'm giving it four stars because it's flexible and healthy.  My family found it a bit bland, despite the garlic.  Will try again and add a bit of either cooking sherry or red wine.

This is one of our favorite soups.  I added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes for some kick. Good way to get some kale in your diet.

Having just purchased kale for the first time and spending some time for recipes, I was excited that I found a soup with beans. I toasted a nice slice of organic whole grain bread and let it cool and dry, then added some of the cheese and let it float in my bowl. This is awesome stuff and so glad I discovered such a great recipe for kale.

This was awesome! I had a bundle of kale in my fridge that I refused to throw away so I looked up some recipes. I use turkey stock in place of chicken broth because it was all I had. I added corn and veggie penne but kept all the other ingredients the same. Great! My family loved it! Even the kids!

A good and healthy soup.  Fresh parsley is a MUST - it helps to camouflage the kale and balances out the flavours in the soup.  I made as directed.

I made this recipe today and it was a total hit! My entire family (including the kids, ages 10 and under) loved it and even asked for seconds! I made a few changes based on what I had on hand: added boneless chicken thighs cut up small to hot oil, added carrots, celery, six fresh large ripe tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes, only one can of beans and chopped up the kale into small pieces as others recommended, 8 cups total of chicken broth,1 extra tsp of Italian seasoning, 1 tbsp of Vegeta (soup seasoning) and added 1 cup of small bowtie pasta a few minutes before it was all done. Did not blend any ingredients. It turned out amazing!  It tastes like high end restaurant quality soup for sure! Thanks for the great recipe!

Loved it! I had some left over fresh collards and used that instead the first time I made it. My 20 year old son and I couldn't get enough of it. Used the fresh kale the second time and found the leaves too tough. I sauteed it longer and cooked it in the soup longer and was still too tough. I will still make this again using a different green.

Very healthy and surprisingly delicious! I followed the recipe as written, except I omitted the parsley at the end. I might have used more kale than suggested (not sure, used 1 bunch, chopped). Using the blender to puree some of the broth and beans was key. My husband and I loved it and the kids both liked it well enough (each ate their whole serving). I served it with tomato and swiss cheese sandwiches on pumpernickel. Great meal!

Very yummy.  I added chicken breast to this and shredded after it was cooked thru.  I didn't bother to smash up some of the beans as I knew that shredding the chicken and letting it simmer would thicken it as well.

I loved this! It was surprisingly filling for a light, vegetarian soup. I loved the kale, tomato, and white bean combination. I also think it's genius to puree some of the beans to thicken the soup.

I omitted the onion and parsley- upped chicken broth to 7 cups, added 3/4 cup dry orzo and cubed uncooked chicken breasts and cooked it in my pressure cooker for 10 minutes. I also used canned tomatoes, because that's what I had.  We sprinkled some fresh grated parmesan on and it was really good!

I LOVE this soup and have made it several times.  I haven't changed a think as far as the recipe.  I do sprinkle a little hot sauce in my bowl before I eat it! :-)  Delicious and very flavorful and filling!

Great variation on standard navy/white bean soup.  In enjoyed the 1st batch as-is but made a few tweaks to the 2nd batch:
- I prefer hearty soups so I doubled the beans and eased off on the chicken broth;
- I used cherry tomatoes (since I keep those on hand) and ended up really liking the difference in texture (canned tomatoes also work decently but I was less a fan); and
- I added dried parsley directly into the soup with the other seasonings and made sure to adequately salt (~1/2 to 1 tsp).
In short, this is a great winter soup I will definitely be making again!

we cooked this in our Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden classes this week and it was quite a hit with all primary school classes.We used tinned tomatoes as our own tomatoes aren't in season just yet and used a stick blender for a few seconds to give the broth a thicker texture while leaving it chunky.
this is definitely going on our seasonal menu :)

This soup is fantastic! I top it with grated Parmesan cheese and serve with rosemary olive oil bread for dipping. If your a meat lover, it's also great with some shredded chicken added to the mix.

This is  a simple and rustic soup, very delicious!  I substituted one can of cannellini beans with a can of red navy beans, fresh herbs for the dried Italian seasoning, and chose veggie broth to make this a vegan recipe.  Wonderful!

I made this soup as written, but I did forget the Italian herb seasoning. I made half a recipe to test it out.  It is fabulous. I wish I had made the entire amount. I did, however, increase the cooking time, because I like softer kale.  I will make this again and I will still leave out the Italian herbs.  Very good without, too.

I loved this soup!  It was so very flavorful.  I did use a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh.  I also used 2 cups veggie broth (I only had two cups left prepared) and 2 cans of chicken broth.  This came out to an extra cup or so over what the recipe called for.  

Most importantly, heed the other recommendations, this needs to simmer much longer in order to have the kale tender enough.  I simmered mine (covered to avoid too much evaporation) for almost 45 minutes.

LOVE this soup.  My non vegan dad BEGS me to make it all the time...and it's so easy to play around with!!! Sometimes I replace the beans with potatoes...sometimes I add carrots or other veggies- it's very easy to improvise with whatever you have!  Soooo delicious!!!!

This is the second time I've made this soup and it's definitely a keeper. Did not have any tomatoes, so left them out ... and it was still super good. Also had a little bit of njuda sausage that I added, just because I had it on hand.

I halved the recipe...I only had 1/2 an onion + 1 bunch kale which came to just over 2 cups worth... but used a whole ctn of stock and 2 regular tomatoes. shouldve added another can of beans because nobody would've known they were in there! i pureed 3/4 the kale because my hubs is leery of anything leafy & green lol but he'd eat it if it was pureed in soup so thats what I did. Didnt have fresh parsley but did have parm so a little sprinkle went on each bowl. will make this alot and play with ingredients a little bit...maybe some shell pasta a la minestrone?

Mild soup with good flavor. Everything blended well and there wasn't one flavor that took over. I made my own broth and only added one can of cannellini. I thought there was plenty of beans. I added chicken pieces to take place of other can of beans for protein.

Used a can of somewhat drained diced tomatoes. Pretty good. Chopped kale small and used about 6 garlic cloves.

This was absolutely delicious!  I even forgot to purée the beans and it was wonderful.  Full of flavor.  I also added some shredded cooked chicken just prior to serving.  Will be making this again very soon!

I needed Iron so I decided to try this recipe.  I sauteed my garlic and onions then added everything else (Doubled Kale) to a crockpot for 6 hours on low.  I also added 2 chopped carrots and 2 celery.  Instead of plum tomatoes add 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes.Last hour I add pre-cooked pasta or brown rice.  Loved it.

awesome soup idea!  great flavor!  i used a TON more kale, because i love kale and i didnt think there was enough after it wilted down (i used probably 3/4 of the large bunch).  i also threw in an extra can of beans.  i did not have any parsley, so i used about a half cup of green onions.  instead of plum, i threw in a whole carton of cherry tomatoes cut in half.  tasty, tasty....

I followed the recipe exactly and unfortunately I was disappointed with this soup. It didn't have good flavor. It is healthy for sure and I really appreciated that, but I won't be making this again. It just lacked flavor.

I've been making a version of this soup for quite awhile.  I don't use onion as we don't care for it but I add two finely chopped shallots.. I used two cans of rotelli tomatoes with peppers and don't use the Italian herb seasoning.  I only use 2 cloves of garlic. I add 2 tsps of light brown sugar, one bay leaf and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. W like it so well that we have this soup about every two weeks.

This was good, though it got saltier as it sat.  I don't know if this is the result of the type of stock I used or if it was something else.  But it was delicious!  We used a homemade can of tomatoes rather than chopped fresh.  Even my husband who claims not to like kale enjoyed this.  great with some crusty bread!  Thanks!

This soup was ok. It tasted kind of spicy to me, I added more beans than called for because it seemed like there wasn't enough substance in it.  I loved the kale in it, just wasn't crazy about the soup in general.

I loved this soup.  The seasonings were just right. I did add 1 T. tomato paste, because I was using a "less meaty" type of fresh tomato.  And, wow, 7.3 grams of fiber and 11 grams of protein per serving, based on 8 servings per recipe.  What a healthy soup.

My four year old said "You sure do make some good soup, Mommy."  Um, yeah, totally going into the recipe box!  I subbed out mustard greens since my husband doesn't like kale and added a little extra garlic (we prefer ALOT in this family and no recipe seems to have enough).  I used fresh cherry tomatoes since I had some in the garden but they did not add as much acidity as I would have liked.  The one out of the ordinary thing I did was that I did not realize my cans were 19 ounces.  Pretty yummy so I think I won't worry about the size next time, either.

This soup is fantastic and I will make it again and again.  Here's what I changed and what I would change in the future:  I doubled the kale (I had a LOT that I was trying to use up), and it turned out great.  I would probably add some type of sweetener because it tasted a skosh acidic/sour with all those wonderful tomatoes in it.  Or, I would use fresher sweeter tomatoes from the garden rather than store-bought.

VERY good.  I did as one of the reviewers recommended and did about 15 min in the pressure cooker to meld the flavors, and it came out great.  I only wished I'd made some old fashion, salty cornbread to go under this dish.  It would have been the perfect compliment to this wonderful veggie stew.

Easy to do it and delicious, I didn't have a white beans instead I used red beans, and I included the chicken breast (the organic one)from the chicken broth I make. For seasoning just oregano and Celtic Sea Salt. It came out surprinsingly flavorous!

My soup lacked pizzazz, but then I played around with the ingredients a lot, and it wouldn't be honest to give it a lower rating.  However, I want to share this useful tip:   DON'T THROW OUT THE KALE STALKS!  Rather, chop them up into small pieces and sauté them with the onions.

Even bf who is not adventurous in dining (pure meat and potatoes man) had two servings and was shocked himself. I followed the recipe as written, did not change a thing. Thank you to the cook who submitted this.

Could have done without the Italian herb seasoning I think.  Also, I had to kick up the chicken broth by adding chicken bullion.

This is a great and healthy soup. Like others, I used canned diced tomatoes. Instead of mixing a cup of broth with the beans to puree I just used a dash of it, I like the extra thickness, but that is a matter of personal taste. I also put a sprinkle of grated cheese when serving the soup and cut up a carrot and threw that in with the kale while sauteeing. This soup also freezes well, I live alone and make the big pot and freeze it in individual servings, and just take when out when I need something quick and healthy to eat.

Very good. I changed a few things. For one, I made much less. I also didn't use tomatoes, and i cooked it a bit longer though on a lower heat. I also added a little heat because I like spicy. And, I used a little bit more kale- since I like it much. Either way, very good!

Loved it!  I only had canned black beans (just fine) and canned tomatoes.  This is flavorful and I feel like I am getting lots of good nutrients.  Now, I know what to do with Kale.

Loved it, Loved it.  My husband, who does not shop much picked up the greens for salad as I asked him to, however, he came home with kale.  I have never used kale, but the conservative person that I am, I never waste anything.  Found this recipe.  I made a double batch adding canned tomatoes with peppers and onion and used red onion because didn't have yellow.  Will absolutely make again and experiment with other ingredients as the other wonderful cooks have done in the reviews.  Great low cal recipe.  Thank You. PS: My diabetic friend loved it too.

Absolutely delicious!  I used fresh Italian herbs from the garden - oregano, thyme and basil - to complement the fresh garden kale.  The family was dreading eating the kale, but served with a fresh crusty no-knead bread, this was an easy filling supper!

Excellent base soup.  didn't change a thing. I did add cubed tofu though, worked well. Next time I would omit the italian seasoning and add just oregano.

Can't wait for a cool day to make again.  I did let it simmer all day so the ribbs in the kale would soften more.  Next time, I believe I would like to cut the kale in ribbons because I like tons of it in my soup!   Thank you so much, I loved this recipe!!

This is very good. I used 1 can diced tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes, I didn't use parsley, and I added 1 boneless, skinless chicken breast cut in cubes and sauteed. Delicious!

Loved it... used half garlic because of my 5 year old but will used the full amount next time.  Also used canned tomatoes with italian seasoning since the tomatoes didn't look appealing. Not a fan of kale but this was delicious!

My new favorite soup. This soup is flavorful and delicious. I made the recipe exact, except: used a high quality expensive olive oil (so tasty), couldn't find plum tomatoes so used 9 cherry tomatoes sliced in half; and I cooked my own white beans with a pinch of salt, and toward the end a few sprinkles of cayenne. Everything organic. Amazing!  Thank you so much for this delightful use of Kale!!

This soup is super yummy. I made a couple of changes. I did drain the beans and skipped the italian seasoning the second time I made it and replaced that with a bit (1/3 C) of chopped anise (the veggie not the spice). So so good!

This soup is so fresh and delicious! Plenty of garlic--just my taste! I added some smoked sausage as other reviewers suggested and a little crushed can tomatoe sauce to the broth as I had some left over and it really added to the flavor. My BF always has to eat meat in his meals so the sausage really added some extra heartiness.

I love homemade soup and this is one you can throw together on a weeknight without much trouble. I agree with some of the other reviewers about the salt.  I added 1 tsp. salt and found that I didn't need that much due to the salt from the beans (I used low sodium chicken broth).

Really yummy. I may have oversalted it a little, but it's still very tasty.  I used kale and red chard (had both in my CSA box this week) and a few red potatoes diced. Added a can of fire-roasted tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes. Also added a healthy dash of lemon pepper shortly before serving.

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  It's summer so I have fresh herbs in my garden.  Instead of Italian spice, I threw in a large handful of sprigs -- sage, thyme, oregano and rosemary, and let that simmer for the 15 minutes.  Delicious!

Over the past couple of years, I've made this soup several times and we never tire of it.  So good!

I looked this recipe up earlier today and made it tonight.  It's a family favorite!  I took another person's advice and added a little chili powder(maybe a teaspoon) and love it.  It reminds me of Zuppa Tuscana, without the fat and calories.  I was worried that it wouldn't taste good without meat.  I am so glad I didn't add any, it's perfect!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was so good that my meat-loving hubby didn't even complain about a meatless meal!  A great use for all the kale we've been getting in our CSA box.  Used about 1/2 can diced tomatoes (w/out juices) since we didn't have any fresh in the house.

Great use of kale! Thanks!   I made this soup with only a few changes.  I couldn't find my Italian seasoning (until the soup was already made and like my soup well spiced), so I added 1 tsp basil, 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp rosemary, 1/2 tsp thyme, and 1/8 tsp cayenne.  Instead of blending, I just used a potato masher to mash the contents of one can of beans and cooked everything together all at once for 20 minutes.  It was so easy and tasty that my husband, who said he wasn't hungry, decided to eat two bowls of it!  :)

I have made this several times, it is excellent and very healthy.  I cut down on the broth and add V8 juice, canned tomatoes, and carrots.  I've also added cooked Chicken or Turkey.  I've made this for friends recovering from surgery.

AMAZING!!!!!  This was a great soup!  I'm on a vegan fast for a month and this soup was perfect.  It tasted great!  It was healthy!  My only change was using a can of diced tomatoes in place of the fresh.

Really delicious soup that is very easy to make.  I added about 2 cups of vegetarian sausage crumbles, and about a tsp each of cumin and cayenne pepper.  Next time I will blend more of the beans for an even thicker stock.

this recipe looks boring, but is really tasty   did not have white beans, so used pinto beans and increased the kale.  The pureed beans makes a really nice base.  Easy and yummy.

We loved this simple and delicious soup! My hubby came home from work and immediately asked about the wonderful smell all throughout the house! I followed the recipe very closely, but I did substitute a can of tomatoes for the fresh and added extra kale since I had no fresh parsley available. So yummy! We will be making this for years to come, thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, and threw a sprig of parsley in the pot while it was cooking, but otherwise left the recipe alone. I used one can of navy beans and one can of cannellini. It's a good, hearty, earthy winter or autumn soup, that practically demands a side of warm, crusty bread with butter. It's a solid, but not exceptional recipe - I'm certainly enjoying the bowl in front of me right now, but I doubt I'll make it again.

This is a good recipe, but I would use a little less broth and more water, such as three cups broth and one water-- like another reviewer stated.  I threw in some whole wheat pasta and romano cheese.

This was wonderful! I'm suffering from a headcold and my husband generously dug into this week's CSA bag when I found this recipe. He whipped up this soup and my generally veggie-hating kids gobbled it up. He had a third helping. The wonderful flavors and aromas even dented my clogged head. Wonderful recipe! A definite keeper!

Good soup.  I have a soup fascination as it is, but this one is good for you too.  I used tomato sauce and some leftover marinara sauce from the Italian resturant instead of the tomatoes.  Pretty good too for the certain national diet program I am on , not too many points:)

I'm not sure what went wrong as I followed the recipe to the "T".  My soup result was very bland.  I added in even more salt and pepper but there was something missing, you know blah... just didn't taste right.  So I threw in a pinch of cumin but that didn't help either.  Perhaps it's b/c I cut out the butter?  I  try to cook without butter whenever possible.  I love kale and beans are always good but this doesn't feel like a good match.  Thanks for sharing though, I'm sure it's a really great soup!

This is my first review here.  I am inspired to write as I sit with  bowl of the soup before me.  This soup is awesome.  It is easy, fast, and delicious.  I used a can of pinto beans and a can of black eyed peas.  Instead of italian seasonings, I used a seasoning blend called Pasta Seasoning by The Spice Hunter as it felt like it would go well.  I also used about 2 cups additional broth and simmered for more like 30 minutes or more.  I topped the soup with a bit of parmesan.  Delicious!

I LOVE this soup.  I've made it twice in the past couple of weeks. Once I made it with Butter Beans, which gave a really nice smooth sort of creamy flavour. I also added a little bit of red pepper flakes to give it a little kick.

Loved this recipe. Tasted great even though I used water instead of stock. I thought that 8 garlic cloves was a little too generous so I used 4.

I had kale and needed to use it in a good way. I added some fresh Hungarian peppers as well and at the end some Andouille chicken/turkey sausage. I also cooked it about half an hour longer to tenderize the kale. Very hearty fall meal with some nice bread and butter.

This is really good!  I used mostly veg. broth and a little chicken broth as I didn't have enough veg.  Also, I used a can of diced tomatoes (drained) instead of fresh as I didn't have any on hand.  I simmered it for close to an hour to get the kale soft which I prefer!  Will make again and again!  Healthy and tasty!  Thanks for the post!

this didn't turn out as good as i thought it would. Few mistakes on my part: used beef broth instead, not enough beans, too much seasoning..I think the recipe called for way to much garlic! atleast i finished my bowl..

I made this very different because I wanted it to be more vegetably for the summertime.  I used only 1 can of beans, didn't blend any, and added in 1 diced carrot and 1 diced red bell pepper, plus spicy pepper.  It was really enjoyed in this house, and super healthy too, thanks!

Absolutely delish! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out wonderful -- However, I did simmer much longer -- probably about 45 minutes total. It tasted just as great after the leftovers were frozen for a couple of weeks, the kale was even still tender. Definitely recommend this recipe for a soup lover!

Pretty good! I used my slow cooker for this. I cooked up 1 pound of dry beans, instead of canned. Then proceeded with recipe. I used dried parsley, omitted tomatoes and did not use italian seasoning (I forgot-woops!). I set it to low and let it cook all day. Pretty good even without the italian herbs. Healthy too!

I love this soup.  I am not a good soup maker but this turned out perfectly.  I am going to add sauted mushrooms tonight.

Excellent soup!  Smelled great cooking with the 8 cloves of garlic!  I only had chick peas and didn't have any italian seasoning so used oregano. Instead of blending some beans and broth, I used my immersion blender on the whole soup.  I also added some chopped spicy turkey sausage.  My husband's usually not crazy about bean soups, but he says this is a keeper!

I thought the soup was really hearty and delicious.  I added a red bell pepper and used red kidney beans instead of the white beans.   Definitely recommended!

This was delicious and healthy.  We made this exactly as written with the exception that we used a 15 oz can of whole tomatoes (drained and chopped) instead of the fresh tomatoes.  Great way to get your greens in.

I came across this recipe when I had a fair amount of homemade black bean dip I was looking to...repurpose.  I used it in this recipe instead of the white beans, and it was near-divine.  The best recipe I've made from this site.  I later made the recipe as stated, and found it really good, but not "the best!".  I will be trying this again and again, I'm certain.

Very good soup.  We added turkey kielbasa (as several raters suggested), a pinch of red pepper flakes and a little Louisiana hot sauce for an added kick.

This was my first experience with kale, and it was great.  I added to the recipe chopped carrots and celery with onions and garlic; left out 1 c. of broth; extra spices; and threw in some turkey kielbasa.  It was delicious.  I think it may have been a little boring for me without the extras though.

I make a version of this soup often.  For those that don't like kale, spinach is also very tasty, and so far is my favorite green.  I've tried escarole as well but don't really care for it's bitter taste.  Also, I generally just add the beans and broth as they are; after wilting the kale I add the beans and broth, bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer for about 20-30 minutes.  Just as great!

I have made this soup literally every Sunday for the past 10 weeks!  My husband and I love it!  Truly delicious.  And I like that my Monday night dinner is already made.  I highly recommend this.  I make it as the recipe reads, as my culinary skills are limited to just what the recipe tells me to do.  But seriously, we love it.

This was absolutely fabulous.  Only change I made was leaving out tomatoes and replaced with about a third of a carrot, shredded.   Wish I would have doubled the recipe.  I will be making this again.  Maybe tomorrow!!   It was that good.

I made this twice.  First time, with cannellini beans and the second time with great northern.  Both times, I used red onion and canned tomatoes (what I had on hand).  I tossed in the juice from the tomatoes, added extra basil and topped with Parmesan.  Very good!

My family loves this soup.  I add chicken apple sausage, and cook it all day in a slow cooker.  I like the kale very cooked, remove most of the veins from it, and chop it small.

My tomatoes may not have been acidic enough, so I added a tin of tomato paste. And served it with lime wedges.  
I also agree with other reviewers that the soup benefits from longer simmering.  But it’s a wonderful and tasty soup!

This is a nice recipe. It is good as is, which is why I rated it a 5-star dish. My son thinks it needs another can of beans so next time I'll add another can . I did cut the kale small and cooked it for a longer time as suggested by other reviewers.

Excellent! From reading the reviews, I added chopped carrots and substituted two cans of fire roasted tomatoes instead of fresh. I pureed cannellini beans and put chickpeas in the soup. Used Herbes de Provence instead of Italian. Nom nom!

I have been making this for 2 years and it is one of my go to soups. I use frozen kale instead of fresh, add 1/4 tsp red chili pepper flakes, use one can diced tomatoes instead of the plum tomatoes, add 1 pound smoked sausage (diced), and I do not purée anything. I like that I have the ingredients on hand most of the time, it has minimal prep, one pot, and a short cooking time.

I chose this because of the ingredients, I had chopped and frozen kale in my freezer and couldn’t drink another smoothie!  I was pleasantly surprised to absolutely love every single spoonful! It was amazing!

Great soup. I used more kale and broth than it called for, and was generous with the seasonings. I'd make it again.

I’d use less onion, and much more kale. I think I’d also add potatoes and carrots to make it a bit more heartier.

So I used vegetable broth and it turned out pretty good(will probably use chicken broth next time), I ended up adding a fresh hot red pepper to it while it simmered for a little more flavor and spice, that made it even better. Will definitely make it again.

This is a fantastic recipe as written. I used a famous-brand pressure cooker and added a package of ground Italian sausage. I sautéed it for a bit and then added the chopped onion and garlic for the last couple of minutes. Add the rest of the ingredients, set 10 minutes on the pressure cook setting, and quick release afterward. No added liquid - just use the liquid in the recipe. Blending the beans at the end is key - it gives the soup some body. I prefer cannellini beans over navy, and I use any old can of diced tomatoes that I have in my pantry.

I made this souo cause I  had to get on a special diet  for health reasons. It’s very limited so I tried this  soup. To be honest it wasn’t my favorite but I am adjusting to big dietary changes so that is probably just my lifestyle change. Overall it was not bad. My husband ate it and liked it and I ate  more the next day. It gets better in flavor The next  day. I did add a few chopped cherry tomatoes while cooking  just for a little color and it helped the flavor. I will make it again.

Great recipe! I had northern white beans cooked and frozen so I used them instead and just added more broth. I also added sage and green pepper, with a pinch of cayenne. Great on a cold night after a week of flu in the household.

I think this is a real good recipe as written.  I made some slight modifications based on personal preference. I withheld the beans until the kale was cooked.  After 15 minutes I thought it was still way too chewy, so I cooked it another 15 minutes, then added the beans and puree and cooked it another 10.  I also thought 8 cloves of garlic sounded like too much so I only used  4, again just my preference.  Thank you for this good vegetarian version of  Bean and Kale soup.  It's a keeper.

I did add a few things-1/2 lb mild Italian sausage, a pinch of fresh Rosemary and Thyme and a 1/4 cup sweet red wine to sweeten the tomatoes. I topped mine with scallions and jalapenos and served with toasted seasoned bread. Yum. Hubby loved it!

I made this tonight & followed the recipe exactly.  I had no idea it would taste so good because there really aren’t many ingredients, but we were happily surprised.  I’m  always looking for different ways to use kale & wow, this recipe hit the spot! I made a pot of jasmine rice to add to the soup if anyone wished. With or without rice this soup is tasty & deserves 5 + stars!!

It’s good but I’m not sure if I’ll make it again. I make a lot of stews and soups, and while I love the combination it seems to lack something, not sure what. The red pepper as other suggested helped it out!

This is very good! I added one diced yellow pepper and sautéed shallots instead of yellow onion because I needed to use them up. I pureed one can of beans and used the other in the soup. I also squeezed juice from half of a lemon after the soup was heated through. Definitely fine chop the kale so that it presents in edible bites with each spoonful! This would be a nice replacement for chicken soup when you're felling under the weather. Tastes even better the second day!

Needed something cheap and easy. This was a great solution. I followed the directions almost exactly. I used cherry tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes, ensuring that I sliced them three ways. For extra protein, I finely chopped half of a baked boneless chicken breast I had laying around. For the broth I used two cups of chicken broth and two cups of vegetable broth. Very easy to make, very tasty. Two thumbs up.

I really liked this soup! Made it as written except I added shredded poached chicken, and used the homemade broth for the recipe. Hubby hated the kale but I loved it. I think it might hav been better if I had cut or torn the kale into smaller pieces. You could always use spinach instead. I will make it again!

This recipe is my absolute favorite soup recipe! Whenever I make it for potlucks or bring it to a dinner or other event, everyone asks for the recipe.  When I make it just for my husband and myself, there's never any leftovers.  We can't stop eating it until it's all gone!!  It's so warming and comforting.  It's especially good on a cold winter day.

This recipe is perfect as is, but for a little extra kick, I add a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis (Original) and about a  1/2 TBSP of Tony Cachere's  Creole Seasoning. Oh, I also add a bit of Turmeric too.

I've been making this for a few years; can't believe I haven't reviewed it before now!  YUMMMMMMMM!!!!!

Great recipe that both the wife and I enjoy. I would cut the garlic by half, unless you really love garlic and the parsley justs seems redundant with all that kale.

I love this recipe because it's simple yet full of flavor. I let the onions cook a bit before adding the garlic. I find adding garlic too soon results in it burning. I also add some chicken meat from a rotisserie chicken for extra protein and flavor. And a sprinkle of grated parmesan or romano when served adds another tangy layer of flavor.

Oh, my! Light, fresh, pungent flavors make for a new favorite for this soup-o-phile! I did swap out the kale for fresh dandelion greens (remove the leaf rib to cut down on bitterness), and generously drizzled fresh squeezed lemon on individual servings. Perfection!

GREAT soup!!! I LOVE it.  I am going to make batches of it and refrigerate in glass jars. Easy to prepare and TASTY! I used a food processor to chop up the ingredients, and added a little extra salt and pepper. Top it off with some grated Parm cheese if you wish. A tasty, healthy soup. :-)

Made it exactly following the recipe...turned out very good.  I used Cannelinni beans and my husband (who is not a "bean person" nor a "kale person") really liked it.  I'll definitely make it again.

Very nice. Next time I would skip the parsley, maybe rinse the beans to reduce the sodium, and chop the kale a little more fine. I'll definetally make it again.

I love the white bean and Kale soup...it is yummy and sooooo easy to make...I did use baby Kale, which works well, easier to chop and the stems are not as intense as it would be in regular kale..I did simmer longer and did not use quite as much garlic and I did use a can of organic diced tomatoes...a easy make for a quick soup...love the flavors of it all.

I absolutely loved this. I did add some carrots and red bell pepper. I also threw in a bay leaf. But it is absolutely delicious. I will make it over and over again, I am sure! My vegetarian son loved it as well.

I made this recipe with I can of white kidney beans and one can of black beans and it worked great. It was a lot of soup for one person so next time I would only make half of it.

I had some Lacianto Kale which I needed to use  and wanted to make soup.  Be sure to remove most of the stems unless you are using baby kale because the stems will be to tough for this cooking time. Also you can use canned diced tomato if you have a brand that doesn't taste like cans.  I make a soup just like this with escarole which is really good.  Because the kale is stronger, I used half the amount.  I also added some cooked pasta and topped it with Parmesan.    Kids ate it up - no leftovers!

This is very tasty.. And better yet healthy! 
I couldn't bring myself to use 8 cloves of garlic, so I used 4. I also added a rib of celery and 1 Carrot diced to the onion. I took the suggestions of others and made sure to chop my kale very fine.. And cooked it down for a good 10 minutes. 
I used equal parts of dried oregano, Basil, garlic powder and parsley in place of the Italian seasoning. I simmered mine for 20 minutes on low uncovered and then shut off stove and let it sit there before I ate it, (about 15 mins). Salt and peppered to my own taste. Make sure to use a no salt added bean. I'd make again for maybe adding some leftover roast chicken for a heartier meal.

I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and chopped the kale into small bits.  We liked the thickening that the last step adds (pureeing half of the beans with some broth).  I used a can of diced tomatoes in place of fresh, and we sprinkled a bit of parmesan cheese onto the bowl of soup.  I'm all about one-dish meals ( and my husband doesn't consider it a meal if there's no meat), so I tried adding some ground beef.  I sauteed it and drained the fat before adding the garlic and onions to the pan. It was delicious.  Next time I will try cutting up some chicken sausage or turkey kielbasa into the soup.  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

I loved it! The puree of the bean made it so creamy. I used Vogel vegetable bouillon and a bit of white wine vinegar. I forgot the parsley. I'll add a picture of my next bowl.

I made SIGNIFICANT modifications to this recipe out-of-the-gate just because I had things I wanted to throw in, and it came out FABULOUS.  That is a testament to the versatility of this recipe and soups in general.  I had a LOT of kale, so I doubled that.  I sliced up a pound of sweet Italian sausage and browned it on high heat in a skillet, then through that in.  I used dried beans instead of canned (so that took a few hours in advance to hydrate).  Dried beans will lower the sodium level of any dish significantly (over canned beans).  I used dried parsely because I had a ton.  I put in more onion (because you can never use too much onion in any dish).  I skipped the whole part with processing the beans to thicken.  It seemed unnecessary and I realized I put ALL the beans in before I read that I was to hold some beans out for processing.  Oh well.   Lastly, I just added as much broth as I wanted to get it to the consistency I wished.  It was GLORIOUS!  This is a complete meal and about as healthy as it gets.

(rating for recipe, not for my non-conformist soup) I didn't follow directions, thus:  mine was too salty; I didn't use the low salt broth, I also used can tomatoes which has salt, next time only fresh tomatoes. My whole family loved this. The kale did turn a bit black several hours after making it. Perhaps I did something wrong there. But even my non-vege picky eaters liked the taste!

I loved this recipe. Since I doubled it the longer the leftovers the better it got.  I used vegetable broth, added Bay Leaf and extra garlic. I will definitely make this again. I'll maybe trying adding potatoes and extra tomatoes.

I followed the recipe exactly with veggie broth and it tasted like the seasonings were off and not well rounded. Too herby. Maybe it would have helped if I reduced the oregano and added some white wine.

great soup. I added Swiss chard, Yukon gold potatoes, and red pepper flakes to spice up the soup. I also cooked 1 cup of dried beans instead of the 2 can beans.,  then, I  blended one can of the cannellini beans as suggested. It turned out great!

I was not impressed with this soup but my husband loves it-and I'm happy to oblige if he'll eat all this kale! The only thing I added was 5 medium sized carrots, chopped, and then I made sure to up the broth, and added one more can of beans. My husband loved this with fresh parsley and a heaping 2 tbsp of Parmesan cheese in his bowl. We will be making this again this winter!

Always looking for good soups with greens and this soup is absolutely delicious!    I took it to a dinner and both young and old loved it.   I would recommend, as others have, chopping the kale into very small pieces.    (The only change I made was to omit the oil as we are on the Prevent & Reverse Heart Disease plan.)

The general flavor and presentation of the soup is wonderful.  My chief criticism is that the kale is not cooked.  Being unfamiliar with kale, I didn't realize that "wilting" it does not make it tender.  I thought I was eating lawn weeds!  I simmered the soup for 15 minutes to cook the kale and make it tender.   Also, I think 4 cups is far too much kale.  Next time I will use half as much, and steam it beforehand.  I substituted canned diced tomatoes for the plum tomatoes, and also cooked dry Great Northern beans instead of using canned beans.  I added extra broth and water to fill out the liquid called for.  I think you could also do well with cut carrots in place of the tomatoes in this nice soup, and add a little rosemary.

I added more kale since I had a ton from the garden!
I have made it on the stove top and in the slow cooker and 
it was great both ways.  It freezes really well and tastes just as good when thawed out months later.  Definitely on my go to soup list.  Thank you!

I did not expect this to be so good.  Only made it to use up older kale.  Did not change anything except I didn't have low sodium broth so I used a can of low sodium tomatoes and did not add salt.  It was excellent.

I blew it - thought I'd be clever and use dried beans.  Despite soaking overnight, they were not tender even after cooking for an hour.  Plan accordingly.  I think it would have been 4 stars if the beans were tender.

This soup was delicious but I did make some changes to it.  Normally I follow recipes to the letter due to the fact that I'm not a very good cook and not creative enough, in the kitchen, to substitute ingredients; however, based on others' reviews I made the following changes.  

I added mild Italian sausage - removing the casings and sliced in small chunks.  I sautéed the sausage in the oil first then added the onion and garlic.  I also ended up using 4 large, 2 medium and 2 small garlic cloves which worked out perfectly fine.  While I tend to be a huge garlic lover I think 8 large cloves would have been too much, even for me.  I, also, did not do the bean puree as I tend to like brothy soups.  I did drain the beans but didn't rinse them.  Since I added sausage and drained the beans I ended up using 4 cups of chicken broth.  Also, I let the soup simmer for 30 minutes as the kale was still a bit too chewy at 15 minutes.

This soup turned out fantastic and, I believe, would be great even without the sausage.

Wanting a healthy start to the new year,I was looking for a satisfying and healthy lunch time soup to make. This did not disappoint.
I did alter the recipe slightly by reducing the amount of beans and increasing the kale. Also used a can of plum tomatoes instead of fresh and a good amount of black pepper but apart from that everything was as is. Really hearty and delicious soup. Served it with an open salad sandwich with very seedy whole grain bread. Will certainly be adding this one to my regular makes.

Delicious recipe! I did, however, make a few little tweaks--I added in cubed red skin potatoes instead of blending the broth and bean mixture, and I found that while this didn't thicken the soup, which I wasn't really after, it did add a bit of heartiness to the soup. I also added extra italian herbs (Mrs. Dash never fails me) and it only made it better in terms of taste and fragrance. Of course, this depends on your preference. Thank you for sharing the awesome recipe!

As is, worth 3 stars. The soup was actually tasty but we both felt there was way too much Italian seasoning taste. If tomatoes aren't at their peak, use a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes. I will also add some sausage next time to amp up the flavor a bit more. If you have time, let soup simmer for much longer to allow the flavors to come together even more. Overall, a good base that can be tweaked to your liking.

This was a good base recipe.  Make sure you simmer it long enough to really cook the kale, otherwise it will be chewy.  Make sure you taste as it cooks to punch up seasonings to your liking.  I ended up adding quite a bit more salt, pepper, and some chicken bouillon powder (in addition to the chicken broth).  I still thought it was a little bland, so I wanted to add crushed red pepper flakes.  Didn't have any on hand, so added some ground cayenne (about 2 teaspoons).  The final product was very yummy.  I didn't care for the parsley garnish, but no problem to just leave that off.  Will probably make this again since it is a healthy filling dinner for two, plus a bit of leftovers for the next day's lunch.

I have to give 5 Stars to this one, I've been making this for a couple of years and we love it.  I can tomatoes in the summer so I use a quart jar of my own and I always add a little extra garlic to it,  I think the garlic is what makes it have that special kick for me but, for those who don't like garlic you might try using a little garlic powder and it would not be as garlicky.  It's really great with a side salad and a fresh warm cornbread or warm Baguette and butter. Yum!

love this soup. I did some changes to the recipe.  Instead of plum tomatoes, I used a can of petite chopped tomatoes; I added fresh sliced mushrooms  the last 5 minutes; also added some chopped linguisa sausage to the sauteed onion and garlic.  Delicious!!

Just great!  I didn't have any white beans, so I used black beans instead. Everything else I followed as outlined.  It tasted clean and fresh.  Good as is or use as a base for a heartier soup by adding other veggies.  It can stand on its own though.

I was lazy and skipped the blending step, and it was still a very delicious soup! We had some left over tri-tip steak and decided to through it in at the last minute. Either way, meatless or veggie, this soup is excellent!

This is a tasty bean soup, I  will definitely make it again! I agree with some other commenters that the kale should be chopped fine. My mistake was not reserving beans and broth to puree, so removed about 1/3 of the soup and pureed that. Otherwise I  made it to the letter and everyone loved it! Oh yes, added baby carrots since the patch was just thinned  :)

This is my third time making this.  This time I decided to add some leftover chorizo sausage and it really gave it a nice twist in flavor.

I'm not a big fan of kale, but my brother-in-law gave me some from his garden so I decided to make a soup.  It was actually very good. The only change I made was to use 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh.

This soup was very good. I used canned great northern beans the first time but the second time I used the bagged kind (soaked first). Also, the second time I skipped the food processor and my husband and I like the second batch best. Both times I boiled smoked turkey necks to add flavor and it was very very good

This is one fantastic dish!!  It has such crisp freshness while delivering tons of flavor .. I did alter two ingredients and added one .. I only used 6 cloves of garlic and I used a can of diced tomatoes w/green chilies vs. the plum tomatoes .. I also added spicy Italian ground sausage for extra protein and a kick .. Yum ~ I can't wait to have it again tomorrow!!

This is so good and flavorful!  It's the first time I have used kale.
I used the ingredients I had on hand, kidney beans, cherry tomatoes, instead of the ones listed and added a few more veggies I needed to use up.
I will make this soup again!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Delicious! Many of the pictures appear to have carrot in the soup, so I sliced one thinly and added it. Excellent recipe! My second bowl included a sprinkling of parm on top, which I recommend highly. Wow!

Made this last night and I wasn't sure how it would come out. It is delicious! Having it for lunch and probably again for dinner. I bought two big bunches of Kale and it shrunk nicely. I used 2 cans of stewed tomatoes instead of fresh (drained and cut) and also threw in 6 carrots since I have lots on hand and also an extra can of chicken broth. I'm loving these kale soup recipes and this one is on my favorite list!

great dish, I boiled a skinless chicken breast for 20  minutes, shredded it then added it to the soup along with the blended beans. Very tasty and fulfilling.

Wanting to extend my palate, I bought kale for the first time and made this soup. It was awesome and is a new favourite. Unfortunately, I did run into some kinks and had to make the following modifications based on what I had on hand: just 1 can of beans, medium chunky salsa plus some ketchup instead of tomatoes. In the future, I'll use more bean as well as fresh tomatoes (and no ketchup). I expect to still add salsa though as I liked how spicy it was with that addition.

The pot I used was maybe 4 qt. in size. The quantity of kale in this recipe would be better suited for a large, large, large pot unless you really like kale. I spent an hour de-kale-ing the soup. For a 4 qt. pot I used maybe 1.5 cup of kale. Other than that, it was good. Next time I'll just put in a bit of tomato paste for flavor, as I don't like chunks of tomatoes. I would also put in 3 cans of beans over 2. But good flavor to this. Added turmeric powder for depth of color and flavor.

Made this soup for the first time.  Very easy to make.  I didn't fine chop the kale and I thought it was perfect, I also added chopped celery and carrots and garlic salt as I had no fresh garlic. My husband thought it was the best soup I ever made. I think I might add more veggies and maybe some meat.. This is the first recipe I have ever rated.

This was simply AMAZING! I never thought about blending part of the soup together to make a thicker broth. I've since used that for versions soups.

I had everything to make this soup. Doubled the recipe for leftovers. Used three regular tomatoes and 1 can of fire roasted because that's what I had on hand. Skipped salt, pepper and parsley and it was still really good. Even my picky eleven year-old thought it was tasty. Keeper!

Great flavor!  Used frozen chopped kale, but kept everything else the same.  Great way to use up my garden tomatoes.  Yummy!

I've made this soup many times. It's tasty and versatile. I usually throw all ingredients into the crockpot and let it cook all day. Sometimes I'll add cut up potatoes which work really well. Usually I use canned tomatoes because that's what is in the pantry. You really can't screw up this soup and it's healthy which is a huge plus.

I like that this is a healthy soup that does not involve a lot of prep work.  I also like the idea of thickening the soup with pureed beans, but using those beans for thickening only left a few in the soup.  I would add in additional beans next time, especially since that is the only part my two year olds like to eat!

This soup was so good!! I wanted to start using kale in my diet and was looking for a recipe that was simple to use. I read some reviews to get tips and followed the recipe almost exactly. I didn't have plum tomatoes but a chunky vegetable soup with them in it. I strained the soup and used the vegetables. I also had some mushrooms so sauted baby portabello mushrooms with the onions. This came out so well and definitely will make again. Thanks for the recipe now other kale recipes will have to live up to this standard!

Love this soup!  When I made it this time I did 3tsp of base to 4 cups of water to dilute the salty broth a bit.  I also used 4 roma tomatoes, popped them in when the recipe calls and when they had cooked enough for the skin to peel pulled them out, peeled and chopped, then added them back in.  I try to use fresh whenever possible.  Topping with a touch of Parmesan (or three cheese blend) is tasty, and a good loaf of garlic/herb bread on the side. YUM!

This was very good and I felt good eating such healthy soup.  I will probably make again and play with the ingredients a bit to make it a 5 star.

Fantastic hardy soup!  The first time I made this I followed the receipt exactly and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Having a craving for kale I decided to make it once again, however, made changes based on the ingredients I had on hand.  In addition to onions and garlic, I added two finely sliced celery stocks in the saute.  After the kale wilted down, I supplemented two finely sliced carrots, replaced the white beans with one can each of rinsed chick peas and black beans, substituted the plum tomatoes with one can of diced tomatoes and added approximately three square inches of chopped parmesan cheese rind.  Since my pot was almost full, I topped it off with as much chicken broth that I could fit and simmered for two hours.  When serving myself I put in a healthy squirt of Sriracha sauce, which I add to most of my home made meals as I like the kick of heat and flavour.  Using less broth turns this into a substantial kale vegetable stew.  This is an excellent base recipe that you can easily personalize.

I added 1lb of Jimmy Dean Hot pork sausage and used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh since I had it on hand. It was a hit, I got many compliments and requests for the recipe. I'll be making this again!!

I've made this soup so many times and I just love it! I usually add either chicken sausage or turkey kielbasa so I up the broth a bit which usually means I also up the kale. I also don't always puree the beans only because of laziness and to save dirty dishes. I will usually make it on a Sunday and package in single serve containers for my lunches.  It freezes VERY well which is a huge plus for me!

This was amazing!  Super easy to assemble and stew.  We made it the night before and went into town and back in a snowstorm.  When we got home, after shovelling snow to get in our driveway it was HEAVEN!

It took  a half a bottle of white wine and a good bit of salt to make this taste good,  But, once those were added it was pretty darn good.

Great! I added chopped fully cooked chicken sausage and finely chopped potatoes for bulk. I also subbed grape tomatoes for the chopped plum. So good! Next time I will add a dash of cayanne and orzo. The recipe is easy to modify to your liking!

This was a huge hit! I didnt have enough kale (which you need to be sure to use just leaves and cut into spoon size) so i added spinach. I also added 1/2 c of sliced carrots and celery as well as crumbled turkey sausage (I buy the Jimmy Dean fully cooked crumbled turkey sausage and keep in freezer for all uses.). We loved it!!!

I really hoped we would love this soup, since kale is so nutritious.  But unfortunately my family did not care for this recipe.  I ended up eating it for my lunches.  I think it probably did taste better the next day.

Excellent recipe! I've made it several times now and each time I do something a little different like adding chopped carrots, celery, and potatoes or vegetable alphabet pasta. I make it in my pressure cooker and it comes out tasting fantastic.

Just made this recipe today. I followed the recipe for the most part, except I used 7 teaspoons of minced garlic in the jar and added Italian sausage to it. Turned out yummy! I think there could've been a little more kale and maybe some diced up carrots. Otherwise, a really good recipe. Thanks !

I'm always looking for other way to use kale. This is a great soup and tastes better the second day (if there is any left!). 

The recipe is good "as is" - I like it even better with a few additions.  I add chopped carrots, celery and some roasted red pepper. Because local/homegrown tomatoes aren't available this time of year, I used pureed tomatoes instead (better than diced, in my opinion).  I puree about 1/3 of the vegetables/beans to thicken the soup. Adding toasted orzo or other small pasta towards the end makes it a bit heartier. And adding lime juice and cilantro at the vey end boosts the flavor.

This is a quick soup to make and I like the kale. I make it with extra kale(I double the recipe amount). I also make it vegetarian style using a chicken broth substitute. It is great with a piece of good whole grain bread.

delicious!!! I AM IN LOVE! I am new to kale. Starting to eat less calories, less meat based foods through the week, we are a meat, starch, and veggie family but with each meal, with the exception of breakfast (sometimes!!), and this is one of my new found favorites. It is FILLING, and sticks with us, doesn't fill us up and wear off in an hour after eating. Of course we have some bread with it, but hey, it's still delicious and healthy too! I used chicken bouillon since I had no veg. or chic. stock, added more kale, an extra clove of garlic and used scallions and yellow onion. I used a few extra cups of stock (mix), and a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes with juice left in it, and drained 2 cans of cannellini beans and 1 can of chick peas (peeled, i can't stand the skins on them!), added a teaspoon more of the italian seasoning and it was SOOO yummy. It would be amazing by the original directions, but I just went with it and then some. I LOVE all recipes.com, it is the best place to get great recipes.

Great! I didn't have cannellini beans, but used a 16-bean soup mix instead. Also threw in some cubed ham for the carnivores in the family. So easy & satisfying- will be making this frequently this winter.

I had Kale in my fridge because I like to make green smoothies but got tired of having a beverage for a meal. I googled Kale recipes and found this one. It is very delicious, filling and low priced and low fat! I also had left over rotisserie chicken that I shredded and threw in the pot. Yumm!

This soup is wonderful. I add chopped carrots and a bit of diced red pepper in to the saute at the beginning to give it more vegetables......Healthy and satisfying!

Tried this recipe because I'm trying to incorporate kale into my diet. The only change I made was to split the beans 1/2 navy & 1/2 garbanzo. Wow was I satisfied! When the 7 year old granddaughter loves AND it's healthy - it's a keeper!

I started by using fresh farmers market white beans boiled with a smoked ham hock in water and chicken broth. Then followed the original recipe adding cayenne powder and 1/2 stick of butter. Once beans were boiled for about an hour, I Simmered low and slow for 2 hours. FANTASTIC!

Very tasty.  Only because I had it around, I threw in some chopped bacon with the onions and added some stelline pasta in the last 15 minutes.

Kale is something I don't care for and I'm "learning" to like it.  I have a long way to go, but this recipe is so heavy on garlic that you really don't notice the kale.  I was going to cut back on the 8 cloves, but given the rave reviews I decided to follow the recipe.  I was kind of worried. My eyes were burning as the garlic smell lingered through the house while it cooked.  Even though you could really taste the garlic, it still had a good over all flavor.

Kale can replaced with cabbage, escarole, collards, or mustards. pretty much whatever green you have in the garden. I also reduce the stock and add carrots

This soup had great flavors. Used fresh Roma tomatoes and kale from the local farmers market.  I didn't thicken the soup with the beans and broth and  I added a pinch or two of red pepper flakes for a bit of a kick.

This is a very easy soup to make and I always have these ingredients on hand anyway. Works well with any beans. I agree that it is better with kale cut smaller. There are so many ways to vary this based on what you have on hand. this is super easy with exception of the blender. would be much easier with immersion blender I assume.

I ended up trying this recipe because I had kale that I didn't know what to do with. This was the BEST tasting soup ever! It was even better the next day. The kale really added to the taste of the soup to give it that extra punch.

Okay, this is so delicious I had to comment. I used the pastine white kidney beans and canned tomatoes and this really pleased everyone in the house. I love kale because it's healthy, but I have a hard time eating it :) This soup however, makes it quite easy. I also throw some spinach in towards the end, just because :) Oh I also don't have italian seasoning so I just threw in a bunch of parsley while cooking. Really, really good.

This was great...I added spicy chorizo and did not blend the beans with the last bit of broth..even so, I thought it a bit thick and will add more liquid the next time I make it. I made it the day before I served it, and put some parm cheese on the top...with a bit of extra hot sauce, as well.. I will definatelyf make this again.

Really great soup!  Can easily be tweaked if you'd like.  I used organic truRoots dehydrated sprouted bean trio (lentils, adzuki, and mung beans).  Rehydrated the beans separately then added to recipe.  Also added about a tablespoon of small pieces of smoked pancetta which I browned separately in some olive oil then added to the soup.  Also added 2 tsp of lemon juice. I did cut the kale into small pieces, but since I was to be feeding this to my 2 year old I took my hand held immersion blender and ended up blending some more.  Perfect!  I completely puréed some that I kept aside to feed my 9 month old.  He loved it!  Will make again and again with leftovers to freeze!  Will try with pasta or rice, and adding pieces of ham or sausage.  If you'd like, you can easily make it thicker or not by adding less or more liquid. Top with Parmigiano.  Enjoy!

Added carrots and celery. Also followed another reviewer and simmered uncovered for 15 minutes and then covered for 20 minutes to intensify the favor. Delicious!

Very tasty. Cooked it pretty much as-is, except that I mashed the remaining beans manually and simmered the soup for about an hour and a half to let the flavors mix all together. It was a big hit with my friends!

I was looking for another way to use kale and was pleasantly surprised that this soup was even better than I'd hoped it would be.  Next time I'll add even more kale, as it can handle it.  It would be delicious with chopped ham added, too.

My Italian Grandmother used to make "Bean Soup" every Friday, especially during Lent.  This tastes so much like it; it took me back to my childhood.  She used cauliflower instead of Kale, but the taste is the same and the Kale gives it a nice color and used tomato paste, instead of chopped tomatoes.  But, really it is basically the same recipe.  She always mashed all of the beans, even in her Italian version of Chili.  It makes the soup so full-bodied.  Her "Bean Soup" was served over homemade Graham Bread.  She filled a big bowl with a whole loaf of chunked up Graham Bread and then poured the pot of soup over it.  The bread soaked up the soup and it was very substantial.  I think when I make this next time, I will add a bit of bulgur wheat.  It has the same taste as the Graham Bread.  I do that when I make Grandma's soup.  It adds a nice nutty flavor and also is very healthy.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!!

Made this tonight. Wasn't thrilled about blending the beans but had no idea they were even there. I could not taste the kale which is a huge plus. I added tomatoes and red peppers and it really sweetened it up. My carnivorous husband had seconds. I will be making this weekly!

Delish!!!  I just made this with a few additions.  I added carrots, zucchini and some pasta.  Also added tomatoe sauce, I didn't have any tomatoes.  It was the first time I ever had kale and it was wonderful.  I will definately make this again.

Hearty and absolutely delicious! Tried the original recipe and it was perfection. I wanted to incorporate more vegetables in my diet so I added zucchini and okra...it only added to the myriad of flavors. I also added Scotch Bonnet pepper for some spice. I could eat this every day!

Better than I expected.  It was quite flavorful given the simple ingredients and relatively easy to make.  I will consider doubling and freezing half next time.  I'm not experienced with kale so I did not include its thick ribs.

we both loved this soup!  sooooo yummy!  I changed this a LOT.  1) used a blend of dried beans that I bought from costco (soak night before, etc), 2) sauteed some onion, garlic, carrots...added the chopped up kale ...and more olive oil 3) also sauteed 2 red sweet peppers 4) when kale was wilted, added veg broth and beans (and blended a cup plus of beans and bean broth).  add herbs de provence and parmesan cheese rind.  served with grated parm cheese.

Per our preference, it's a 4 as it's written.  We preferred adding a 1 tsp red pepper flakes (we like a little spice to our food).  We also cooked 4 pieces of no-nitrate thick cut black pepper, applewood smoked bacon, removed bacon after cooking and used the grease in place of oil to saute the garlic and onion then kale (finely chopped per others recommendations).  We then topped with a piece of smoked gouda cheese but kids preferred Parmesan then crumbled bacon before serving and these minor changes made this a 5-star for us.  Thanks for sharing.

Loved this soup! Even though it doesn't require a lot of time to cook it still had flavor like it had simmered all day. I took some of the suggestions from others and cooked the kale a little longer and cut up into small pieces. I also waited until about 10 minutes from completion to add the tomatoes. At the end I added fresh grated parmesan cheese. So yummy on a cold January day but truthfully it was so good that I could eat it in the summer!

I used kidney beans and didn't use parsley.  Also, I used baby kale, which requires no chopping.  Delicious!!

Easy, fast, delicious and nutritious. I have made this soup repeatedly. I didn't blend anything and skipped the Italian seasoning. I love the Whole Foods 365 brand of Cannellini beans in a carton instead of a can. They contain no salt and don't have that can aftertaste.
Enjoy!

Love this recipe! It is so healthy and yummy! Delicious! The only thing I changed was that I rinsed the beans and do not have a food processor so I mashed them up with a fork and it worked perfectly. Also, I let the soup simmer for an hour + so that all the flavours could blend together :)

This was a great and easy soup to make with alot of flavor. I have never cooked kale so was looking for something easy. I used canned tomato that was onion and garlic seasoned and followed recipe from there. This will be a great light soup to make and get some greens in. As other said I simmered for about 30 mins to get great flavor and kale tender. Great soup.

This was SOOOOOO good!  I needed to make a bigger batch for for a family get together, so I modified it a bit by increasing the number of tomatoes, adding an extra can of beans (I rinsed the canned beans), two stalks of celery diced, 2 carrots diced, bay leaves, doubled the stock (8 cups) and threw in a handful of small pasta (acini di pepe) about 15 minutes before it was finished.  Because kale is a rather tough green, I stripped out the center vein and thinly sliced the leaves and sauteed them with the onion in the olive oil about 15 minutes at the beginning before I added the other ingredients.  I recommend giving the kale a head start in the cooking process so it isn't chewy - I let the soup simmer for about 45 minutes to an hour covered...the soup turned out fantastic and everyone absolutely raved about it and wanted the recipe!

This was yummy, nothing special in the flavor dept, but good, and super nutritious!  My 3yo and I ate it with toasted slices of hearty Italian bread from Puglia.  We scooped it onto the bread which had been drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with salt.  Yum.  For my 3yo I chopped the kale smaller than I normally would have, but I ended up liking it that way too.  Never would have thought I'd get my toddler to eat kale, so this is a keeper!

Soup was a little heavy on the onion and garlic side for me, but otherwise good.  Flavors really improved after a day or so.

I thought this was basically very good - though just a tad on the bland side...  I took others' advice and added some carrots and a bit of red pepper flake, but it needed something more...  on my second bowl I decided to add a touch of celery seed and, voila', that made a world of difference and added just that little something extra.  I will definitely make this again, as I'm trying to do more meatless dishes to try to incorporate healthier eating habits.  Thank you for sharing :o)

This soup is excellent - I even omitted the part with the blender/food processor as I was in a hurry.

This Was great. I used dried beans instead of canned to avoid the sodium. I also cooked my beans with smoked turkey to add flavor. I added celery and carrots as well. Before serving, I added a orzo to each bowl.

This is a fabulous recipe. I love thickening the soup with the beans.  I actually used my immulsion blender and did the beans/broth in a separate small pan.  I also used fresh beans instead of canned.  I just did the quick-soak method and then simmered the soup for a couple of hours to let the flavors blend.  I didn't add the tomatoes until near the end.  Me and my 2 vegetarian sons loved it.  I set aside some for my hubby and fried up some italian sausage and added that to his.  I doubled the recipe and we'll all eat on it all week for lunches, quick dinners.  YUM!

This was a super easy dish to make and very nice veggie type soup. I cooked the soup about 30mins instead of only 15 mins like the recipe calls for...I might try adding cooked chicken to the soup next time.

yum.  I added some quinoa and it was super good. I used organic white beans too. A different bean would taste different, worth a try as well.  I used a lot of kale, more than this calls for in the recipe

Good base.  I thought it was very bland and lacked flavor.  I had to add 2 more cans of beans, Nature's Seasoning, red pepper, and kielbasa

My husband raved about this. My daughter, who usually isn't keen on soup had 2 helpings.

I used frozen chopped kale for convenience. I also didn't bother taking the blender out. I just mashed 1 can of the beans a bit with a potato masher, right in the soup pot. This was easy and so healthy.

I love this soup! It actually made me a kale lover! I usually dont have tomatoes just laying around, so when I am in the mood for this, I just use 1 can of diced tomatoes instead. And occasionally I sautee chicken and add it. Yum!

I really liked this.  I used baby kale from the farmer's market, so there was no problem with the big vein running down the middle of the leaf.  Great flavor, spices were just right, didn't even have to add extra salt.  Tomatoes do get a little mushy, so if you like firmer tomatoes, don't add them until the end.

Delicious. My husband doesn't always like experiments with green so I was worried. He LOVED it. I didn't have fresh parsley so substituted with dried. Used my own homemade chicken stock. Added leftover chunks of chicken and beef we had from a restaurant dinner. Served with couscous on the side. Added garlic salt and pepper and squeezed lemon on top right before serving with a sprinkle of grated Parmesan. My husband said, "We can do that again!" we ended up dumping the couscous into the soup. Yum.

This was really good!  I cooked up some chicken sausages and then added that to the soup and used a can of diced tomatoes.  I made quinoa and black beans as a side but was great to add to the soup.  Just be sure to add it right when you are going to eat it.  It can soak up the liquid if it sits in it too long.  My young kids loved it!  So did the hubby.  He went back for seconds later that night!

I made this recipe with a few changes. I added mild sausage meat in the beginning, but I did not add any parsley (not the biggest fan). I chose not to buy the Italian seasoning as I have most of the herbs anyways. I added a teaspoon of liquid smoke as well. I also did not blend the beans and broth as I like my soups chunky. My family loved it!

This soup is the bomb!! It's so flavorful and filling. I do make a few modifications though.  I use three cans of white beans: Cannellini, Navy and Great White Northern Beans.  I also add cut carrots, two cups of cooked brown rice and extra broth.  It freezes really well and is definitely a new favorite on my rotation!

I came across this recipe looking for recipes using kale.  I halved the recipe because I only had one can of navy beans and did not have any tomatos on hand.  Other than that I prepared it as written. It was very good and I will definitely make it again.  I'm sure the tomatos make it even better but it is good even if you don't put them in.

What a great easy recipe, already made it twice in 2 weeks.  Added lemon juice before serving and used herbs de provence, both from other reviews and because we really like lemon in soup and I don't really like oregano.  Used one can cannellini and one garbanzo second time - can't really say I liked one better than the other.  Also used a can of diced tomatoes to save time and that was just fine.  So glad to have this one!

This is such a hearty soup! I'm not typically a lightweight eater, but this soup filled me up. I did make some modifications but not enough to where it ruined the integrity of the soup. I used 5 garlic cloves instead of the 8. Used red kidney beans and black beans because it's what I had on hand, and used a can of diced tomatoes with italian seasoning. I also didn't blend the soup with the beans. I don't mind a thin soup. Oh I also added some beer to it, mostly because it needed more liquid, I didn't have anymore broth and it's what I was drinking at the moment.

I made this soup pretty much the way it was written although I did use Herbes de Provence as I didn't have Italian seasoning. I felt that it needed more oomph, so I added oregano and cayenne as another reviewer suggested.  I still felt that it lacked heartiness and the tomato flavors were lost. Finally, I added most of a 6 oz can of tomato paste. It was just what this soup needed to make it a hearty, tasty and healthy meal!  I did cook it much longer than indicated, mostly because my husband was late getting home. Thanks for the recie!!

Made this today for the first time. Used veggie broth, 2 cans of small white beans and  pureed 3/4 can of chick peas to thicken. No tomatoes but added one tbs  of tomato paste. Used italian spice that had quite a bit of rosemary which goes well with kale. I sauteed onins and added kale to pan to steam the night before. The nextday I made recipe  and cooked soup for an hour on low. Kale was so tender. A huge hit!

I just made this soup for lunch and it is wonderful!  I cut back on the garlic and didn't have fresh parsley.  I'm thinking about having it for dinner also.  It is even better with a little fresh grated parmesean cheese on top.

FANTASTIC! So flavorful!! I used 1 can garbanzos and 1 can kidney and the flavor contrast was perfect. I also doubled the kale and added extra water.

Absolutely delicious!! I added 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breast.  Made 4 adult sized servings.  Next time I will double the recipe so we can have left overs, and will probably rinse 1 can of beans and use 1 cup water in place of chicken stock to cut down on the salt.

This is a great recipe and should definitely be doubled!  It seemed like it needed a little extra acidity to it, so I added the juice and zest of one lemon (for a doubled recipe).  Also used canned diced tomatoes and great northern white beans (prepped from scratch).  It's a great way to use the fresh kale from the garden!  I highly recommend this recipe.

Well, I made it just a bit less healthy, and added some italian sausage, that I pre-cooked & drained before adding to the soup during the last stages.  It is super, but a tad salty, so don't add any additional salt if you decide to use the sausage.  It's super without the sausage too!

Great healthy recipe.  I used vegetable stock to keep it vegan, added an extra can of beans and I used a can of diced tomatoes and it was fabulous.  Its a beautiful soup and it tastes great.  My family would never eat kale normally but they loved this.

wow this was good. I chopped the kale really small and just substituted some garlic powder, basil and oregano for the italian herb seasoning. After sauteeing the garlic, onions and kale, I just put everything into the pot and after it was done simmering (I let it simmer about 45 minutes) I pureed it all. I skipped the parsley (didn't need it) and sopped my bowl of soup with crusty bread. YUM!

mmm mm mmmm... I never had kale before recent but my CSA gives us tons every week and this is my favorite recipe to use it in! I also added a zucchini and some fresh thyme. I didn't have Italian seasoning so I just used oregano and basil instead (Italian enough for me!). quite delicious, thank you! :)

Really good! My first time for trying kale and I was pleasantly surprised. My changes: can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh, used chicken broth, just had to add some polish sausage, but it would have been just as good without meat. I will definitely make this again.

This was SUCH a delicious soup after my modifications (the four stars are for the original recipe). I added carrots, celery and a potato. I also added some red pepper flakes for kick. I ended up simmering this for 30 minutes so that the kale got nice and soft. My boyfriend and I almost finished the entire pot I made last night by noon today!

Yummy soup!  Did not have enough beans so added two small chopped potatoes, canned diced tomatoes cuz no fresh, also a grated carrot and finely chopped celery. Husband wanted meat so simmered two whole chicken breasts with all the vege's then chopped chicken small.  Very good soup even tho I had to improvise a bit.
edit to add- I see many are complaining about the kale not being cooked enough. Cook it alone in olive oil and "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" margarine, ( then check for "chewiness").  Save until the rest of soup s finished, then add.

Ok recipe, remind me of escarole and bean soup. Truth is it is hard to make kale taste good. Just don't use too much kale like i did.

I made this twice in one week. The first time I made it strictly vegetarian, I made it after breakfast then heated it back on the stove at dinner. It was very yummy and there were no leftovers. The second time, I made it for my husband & added sausage & chicken broth. He couldn't get enough! Very easy & so nice and healthy with the kale and the beans!

This soup is really hearty and delicious! I added 6 very thin slices of dried chorizo to the onions and it gave the soup a nice smoky undertone. I also added a 2" by 3" parmesan rind while simmering. I would suggest cooking it as long as it takes to really soften the kale. So healthy too!

I liked this soup, but one could definitely botch the flavor if nice, ripe tomatoes aren't used. The soup definitely tasted better the second time around because of the acidity from the vine ripened tomatoes. I thought the that the acidity was important enough that I even doubled the amount of tomatoes called for the second time I cook this recipe. This time it turned out very well.  I also recommend leaving out some Parmesan cheese for people to add to their soup if desired. It was a nice addition that some people liked.

This soup was really good and I am generally not a soup lover!  I only had one can of beans so i did not blend any.  I also added potato, carrot and fresh basil. Topped it before eating with some parm!

WOW!  Great recipe!  Found myself with a sack of Kale and had no idea what to do with it and found this recipe.  The ONLY things I did different was to use canned diced tomatoes with chilies (drained)and used canned Great Northern Beans.  The tomatoes with chilies gave it some real kick.  Super Recipe!!

This recipe is amazing! My broth (I used a veggie cube) turned out really well, which I think was the key! My boyfriend who is not in general fond of soups also gave this one rave reviews! The two slight modifications that I made were: 1) used dry beans i/o canned which adds a bit to the prep time for soaking and cooking them, but saves you from having to consume the insanely high amounts of sodium that comes with every can of beans and 2) I made my own Italian seasoning using a recipe from this website and fresh herbs from my garden, which turned out really well and saved about $5-6 in the process. Overall, whoever came up with the idea of pairing kale and beans is a culinary genius, and so is whoever conceived of this recipe!

Made this soup because I had kale on hand...It was delicious..I added some extra spices because it was a little bland upon first taste, and used garbanzo beans instead of navy beans. Excellent recipe, simple to make, few ingredients, and easily adaptable to what you have on hand. I will make it again!

I made this last night, and was a little skeptical when I tasted it. It was just okay; a little bland. However, I brought it for lunch today, and after sitting overnight it is MUCH better! I gave it 5 stars for the simple prep, common ingredients, and nutritional value. I recommend not adding any salt until the next day, unless you use "no salt" cans of beans.

I was looking for a nice healthy soup that didn't have meat and I found this heavenly piece of work. When i was cooking i wasn't sure if i had enough of kale then onion but then i figured it out on how to do it my way and it came out delicious. I only used half of the medium onion and only 2 regular tomatoes and it was still perfect, even my mom had to let her bf try some and he loved it. I feel proud of myself =D and thank you for submitting such great easy to make and VERY healthy soup.

I would give this recipe 3.5 stars because it was good but just didn't blow me away. I used low sodium chicken stock, cannelini beans and extra kale. Instead of plum tomatoes I used a can of diced tomatoes. It turned out fine but was just a bit bland and blah. I prefer my soups to be a bit more substantial with more ingredients. This recipe might be good with mixed greens instead of just kale, carrots, peas and more than one type of beans. Not a bad recipe, just not exciting enough for me!

4 stars for the healthy elements in this soup. 2 stars for the absolutely boring taste. I am a vegetarian and normally cook low fat meals but this did not hit the spot. Followed it exactly as written then simmered in a crock pot for 3 hours and blended at the end. I wouldn't spend the time to make this soup again.

Excellent!  Ratio of liquid to other ingredients was perfect, and seasoning was well-proportioned.  Not an over-powering soup but a comforting mix of flavors.

I wasn't too crazy about this but it was a great healthy and very filling soup. I'm not that fond of kale but it was easy to make an had lots of flavor. If you like kale, this recipe is for you! If you don't it is still pretty good. I would suggest using a larger white bean and not navy beans, they were too small and they kinda lost their shape in my soup.

I love this soup!  It is good comfort food.   The next day it is much tastier.  

Cooking dry beans in advance and/or making the broth from scratch REALLY paid off in terms of flavor with this recipe.

I made this with only one can of beans and two tomatoes (everything else as written).  The whole family loved it and my husband was surprised that there was no meat.  I'm very happy to have another good recipe with kale.

My changes: Used less garlic (about 4 cloves), used great northern beans and canned diced tomatoes because I had them on hand.  I also added diced turkey smoked sausage and sauteed it with the onions, garlic and also some grated carrots.

My changes were based on what I hand on hand and to meet my personal preferences, but I think this would be a great recipe even with no changes.

This was really tasty. The only changes/additions I made were: using vegetable broth instead of chicken, a little cayenne & fresh chopped basil. I also simmered the soup (with lid on) for almost an hour to really meld the flavors.

Thank you so much for this recipe!  We just got our first shipment of veggies from our local CSA and I had never cooked with collard greens before.  I was actually confused and thought they were kale so I used them in this recipe -- but the results were delicious!  Great for dinner and the leftovers were yummy too!

MMMM MMM MMM! This is the first time I've ever tried kale--too everyone's advice and simmered for 10 min w/ lid off and 20 min w/lid on. The kale is so tender and I used a can of stewed italian tomatoes. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T! SO much better than I thought it would be and I'll be sure to make this again! Diet friendly too! Thanks for sharing it!

This was fabulous, hearty, and healthy.  I substituted a can of pre-seasoned diced tomatoes for texture preference.

This was REALLY good!  I had never had kale before, and wasn't sure what to do with it when I received it in my produce co-op box.  This was the perfect way to use it up.  I was surprised at how sweet-tasting the soup was.  I'll definitely be making this again.

I tried this only because I have never liked kale and couldn't believe anything with it would taste good. I was WRONG. This is so good that I have given the recipe out to all my co-workers. Don't miss this one!

excellent soup my boyfriend loved it!  I used vegan chicken like seasoning with a lot of vitamins/minerals in it and also added a dash of cajun seasoning and a dash of hot sauce which didn't add heat but added flavor but it was still good before

This is delicious! I normally try to make the recipe exactly as stated the first time I make something, but I was short on kale by about one cup. I topped it up with wild spinach... still fantastic!

This soup is so good, and so easy. Often a batch only lasts one day around here, as it is eaten for lunch, snacks, and dinner. I use vegetable bullion instead of chicken stock, otherwise I follow the recipe as written.

Good stuff! I made it up to the point where you mix everything together and simmer, then put it into a crockpot on low for a few hours while we were out at an event - we came home hungry and soup was on! Some parmesan cheese is good on top (I forgot the parsley), and I served it with slices of french bread topped with olive oil and parmesan and run under the broiler until toasted.

This was very good; however, I did not follow the recipe exactly. I just used it as a basis for doing my own thing. I used a large can of white beans in tomato sauce, added about 3 cups water and some vegetable boullion cubes, then i put in 1 tsp. dried parsley, about 1 cup frozen "boerenkool" (dutch) I'm not sure if that's kale or not - I always just assumed they were one and the same but I don't know to be honest... I also used garlic powder, oregano, basil and rosemary and finally I sprinkled in some ground black pepper. It was tasty... and besides I just couldn't imagine using 10 cloves of garlic.

My family really liked this soup.  The things I changed:  reduced the garlic from 8 to 4 cloves and used one can of diced tomatoes instead of the plum tomatoes.  Everybody wanted the recipe!
