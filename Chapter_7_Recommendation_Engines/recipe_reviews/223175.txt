This was really good and I fully intended to take a picture but it got gobbled up first.  Oh well, I'll just have to make it again.  I couldn't use the grill as we were having a major thunderstorm so I lightly sauteed the chicken in a frypan and then just added the sauce and let it simmer for about 15 minutes.  I used some homemade peach jam that didn't set up which was perfect.  I also couldn't grill a peach for the side but definitely will next time.  Thanks!  Everybody that ate it, loved it!

DEFINITELY a keeper!  Yum!  I did cut the recipe down to two servings to use a package of Costco's boneless skinless chicken breasts, and I cut those in half horizontally.  They didn't take very long to grill, but I followed the instructions, using the leftover sauce to pour over the sticky rice (calrose) that I made.  This was really tasty stuff!  This will make our regular rotation for sure!  Thanks for the recipe!

I cook these in a skillet as one user suggested. Cook the chicken then add the sauce and let simmer until the sauce is nice and thick. I also add 2 minced up jalapenos seeded to the peach sauce for a little kick.  I have made this 3 times so far and my family just LOVES it!

Since I had some apricot jam left in jar, I used instead of peach.  Apricot and garlic were so nice!

This was a great grilled chicken recipe.  The sauce was a perfect blend of sweet and savory.  The recipe makes plenty of sauce, so be very generous with it - it's what make the dish soooo good!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, SOMEONESWT!

This was super yummy.  The peach sauce is so good.  I bet it would also be good on a pork tenderloin.  I will definitely be making this again.

I used hot sauce instead of soy, spicy brown mustard instead of Dijon, and added chili flakes to the mix. Great spicy twist on this recipe!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but I tried this twice and we couldn't taste the sauce at all.  First I tried it grilled on a cutup chicken and couldn't taste the sauce. Next time I tried it when I grilled chicken breasts. I even marinated the breasts in the sauce all day before grilling that evening. Still no flavor. The chicken turned out well and was moist but I was disappointed in not having any extra flavor.

I work until 6:30 every evening, so this morning when I got up, I pulled out the three chicken breasts I had thawed out the day before, only to find out they were chicken tenders.  Since I didn't want to do a lot when I got home from work and delay our dinner, I went ahead and seasoned them, sauteed them in the skillet with olive oil.  While I was doing that, I mixed up the sauce, not using any fresh peaches.  Added the chicken to them when they cooled, and covered in the fridge until I got home.  Fried some zucchini while the chicken and peach sauce was heating up, along with a pasta side dish and rolls.  

Best meal I have cooked in a long time!  Sad when I had eaten my share of the chicken!!

The sauce was very good, chicken was moist!  It's a keeper!  It took our peach halves longer than noted to grill on charcoal but they were a very nice addition to the chicken.

This is absolutely DELICIOUS!! We made it following the directions exactly, even to the amount of time for each side of the chicken on the grill. It turned out moist and VERY flavorful, and we'll be making it again. Thanks for posting such a terrific recipe :)

I really like these.The flavor was really good, just enough spice with a little bit of sweet. 
the only thing I did different was used boneless chicken thighs.They were very moist. The leftover chicken made a tasty sandwich for lunch.

Loved the grilled peaches.

Made this exactly as written, but without grilling any peaches with the reserved sauce because peaches aren't in season right now.  But we loved the peach sauce on the grilled chicken breasts!  Thank you for a keeper recipe!

I was so excited to try this on the grill -- then it started raining!  So I ended up making it in a cast iron grill pan.  I made it using boneless pork chops, and my husband loved it.  He really can't wait to try it on chicken, and I have every intention of doing so!  We ate it with a Sweet and Smoky bean recipe from a recent issue of Cooking Light, and it was the perfect contrast of spicy and sweet.

Very good recipe. I didn't have peach so I used apricot preserves. I did add a bit of jalapeño to the sauce and it was just enough to give a bit of heat w/ the sweet sauce! Will definitely make again!

This is my new summertime favorite. I didn't use the grill but sautéed it using a little extra evoo. I also added pecans and some white wine to the extra sauce and let it summer for few minutes. Made a salad with it all. It was amazing!!!

wonderful dish. I had to use apricot preserves as that's all I had, however will use Peach preserves the next time as I think it would taste even better. for the side I made rice with the grilled peaches, which came from my own garden. Love the dish, thanks for sharing the recipe!

Not sure why but the sauce just ran off the chicken and just burned in the bottom of the grill. I did  not cook the peaches so I had a little sauce I had set aside just in case and I am glad I did. We spooned the sauce on the chicken in our plates and it was good. I think next time I will just grill the chicken and heat the sauce and pour over chicken in plate. I think I will add a little heat as well.

Thought this turned out quite good, family agreed. I made this for the sauce only...Used apricot all-fruit in place of preserves to lower the sugar and balance the sweet with a little more tang. Then I sliced the chicken breast thinly off a whole rotisserie bird. Put the sauce in a foil bowl and heated til slight bubbling then added meat and grilled that whole thing together over the fire. Kicked up the bite from the mustard by doing so. Super yum!

5 stars ONLY after we reduced the amount of garlic to 1 tsp. For our preference with 1 tbsp garlic 1 star. We like garlic in moderation but it was overpowering. Threw the first batch out, used 1 tsp garlic instead and it balanced well. We are going to make more to glaze over a stuffed pork tenderloin this evening.  Recipe saved.

This turned out amazing! There were no leftovers! 
I did make some changes though. 

I didn't have preserves so I used about 7 (2 cups) very ripe peaches and blended them up. Added sugar to taste and let it simmer until the sugar was incorporated. Then I added about a 1/2 cup moscato wine and let it reduce.  Then I added the soy sauce and Dijon and 2 tblspoons of minced garlic and let it simmer until the glaze bubbled up and thickened. I set aside about 1/4 cup of glaze for later.
I brushed boneless skinless chicken Thighs  with olive oil, salt n pepper and Threw on BBQ. After grilling oneside I flipped and brushed with glaze. And repeatedly flipped and reglazed each time. I served with a tiny bit of sauce under chicken. It was so delicious!! Definitely a keeper in our house.

The chicken was moist, the peaches were divine (and I don't rally care for warm fruit), served with a foil packet of potatoes and onions, all cooked on the grill.  What a great way to end a good day.  Will make again next week while camping in the north woods.

The whole family loved this recipe! I decided to try marinating it all day long in the peach sauce, which worked well.  The grilling got rained out, so I baked it in the oven, and it was great. This will be a great recipe for busy weekdays. You could prepare it before work and it is ready to put in the oven when you get home.  Some simple sides and you're ready to have a great dinner.

Refreshingly sweet.  Definitely a keeper.  While ckn hot off the grill, spooned a little more sauce and sprinkled with salt.  The salty/sweet was addicting and the ckn was scarfed down.  I over grilled my peaches and they came out mushy - so follow the directions Sunnyday ... hello!

No, not yet, but I want to. Will it taste just as good to use legs? That is my favorite part of chicken. I know what tastes good to me without trying it. It may not always be the case, but usually. Teresa

It was good but just not tasty enough for me. I did exactly as the recipe said as I always want to try it the original way, but it needed more zip.

was very good. I used apricots and apricot preserves because that is what I had. Also made it on the stove top., and put apricots in the oven at 450.  Served with Jasmine Rice and a nice Mediterranean salad. It was a hit.

One of my favorite recipes I've been using for a couple years now, though I've made some changes. I use orange marmalade jelly instead of peach preserves, this simple swap out makes this recipe even better in my opinion, though that kind of defeats the purpose of the peaches, we usually put a couple orange slices on top to serve instead. I also add fresh herbs, whatever I have growing at the time but usually chives or basil, sometimes even both.

Delicious summer treat!  The peaches I had were not freestone, and I didn't feel they separated into halves well enough to grill, so I braised them in the sauce with wonderful result.  I used three chicken breasts and halved the sauce.  It was still plenty to cook the peaches separately.

Yummy. I did it with bone in skin on thighs.  The sauce was great.   Could use a little zing. So adding some red pepper flakes next time. Also plan on using the sauce on grilled ham steak

Great easy recipe. I substituted orange marmalade for peach preserves because that’s what I had & did not add the peaches, still delicious! Also cooked inside, pan seared in cast iron pan & lowered heat to cook to temp. I will definitely make again.

I made this recipe for last night and my husband, a very picky eater, said it was good.  I did, however, cut the seasonings pretty much in half since he does not like new flavors.  I will definitely make it for another time and maybe increase the seasonings a little bit.  I'm always thrilled when he will eat something new.  Thanks for delicious recipe.

This dish was very good.  I did tweek the recipe just a little though.  I added a bit more chopped garlic and I also added one large jalepeno pepper to give it some zing.  My peaches that I used could have been just a bit more ripe.  It was still delicious. I will be making it again soon.

Wow it turned out so good. The one thing I added was fresh crushed peaches. Cooked down with the rest of the ingredients it was delicious in the chicken.

I am giving this recipe five stars even though I spilled half of the sauce before getting to the grill, what I could taste was phenomenal and the chicken was tender.  I will definitely making this again and I expect to enjoy it twice as much with the full amount of sauce!

Great flavors! Nice moist chicken and delicious peaches. We made a half recipe this time but making the whole next when we have company. Easy and tasty, that’s my language!

Sounded good based on reviews but I wasn't overly impressed by this; it was just ok. My husband isn't a chicken person and I keep looking for that one recipe that will convince him chicken is amazing. I used apricot preserves rather than peach, but don't think that would have made much difference, and another reviewer did the same thing and really liked the results. I did like the grilled peaches, however.

Really delicious.  I made less chicken so decreased the amounts of sauce ingredients. However I made sure I had lots of peach preserves and garlic.   Came out wonderfully tasty.  I never ate grilled peaches before and they were definitely the star of the meal.

I made this for our guests tonight for dinner and it was very good and super easy!  I tried to follow the directions as closely as possible but did make three changes.  Firstly there were no peach preserves to be found except sugar free.  I was hesitant to use it, but went for it.  I also added in 1 tbl. of fresh minced ginger, and heated all in the microwave to meld the seasonings.  This marinade  did not taste great to the taste buds (probably because of the sugar free preserves), but I did not have time to remake this.  I pounded out my chicken breasts so all were of equal size, then put every thing into a zip lock back and let them soak for the afternoon in the fridge.  The grilling time was spot on for chicken and everyone loved the chicken.  I must admit I was very surprised by the outcome, mostly due to using a sugar free product, but I will use this again since it considerably cut down the calorie count.  I grilled a variety of veggies with this meal along with the peaches.  Next time I will put all the sides on the grill 10 minutes before adding the chicken onto the grill.  This dinner was perfection!

It was delishous! We all went nuts! I did it on my new Weber Charcole Grill! The smoke and peaches were SO Good! I will make again for sure! I heated up the leftover sauce! It was so good poured over the chicken. It was yummy to rumb the grilles peppers in too! This is the sauce I have been looking for a long time.

It was easy to make and a big hit.  I used fresh South Carolina peaches in season but it will work just as well with frozen peaches out of season.  Highly recommend you try it.

Made on stove top (cause of a snow squall) it was ok . I'm thinking grilling the chicken would of been the better option. Sprinkled green onions on top when served.

I used apricot preserves as an alternative as suggested in the recipe, but was disappointed with the  sauce. My family didn't think it had a lot of flavor.  Won't be making again.

This was so easy to make.  I added a little cayenne to the sauce because of my friend's suggestion.  I also added Penzeys roasted garlic, which I thought was going to be a mistake due to the overpowering aroma, but when it cooked on the chicken it was balanced.    I would make this again.

The peach glaze is excellent!  I did make one change, as my husband steadfastly refused to grill the chicken, as the glaze would make a huge mess on the grill: I cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces, cooked them in the skillet, then simmered them in the peach sauce for 15 minutes.  I then served the chicken over white rice, spooning the peach sauce on top.  Served with fresh peach slices, my kids thought this was excellent!  If you choose to simmer the chicken in the peach sauce on the skillet, however, OMIT the olive oil!  The first time I made this, the sauce was very runny.  The second time, with the olive oil simply omitted, it was perfect!

O.k.  I made this last night and it was quite tasty if you  are a fan of sweet & tangy meat flavors (which I am).  I followed the recipe ingredients and also seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, onion powder, Lawry’s season salt (instead of white salt), and Costco’s Mesquite BBQ spice seasoning, along with the black pepper.  I also added this same seasoning into the sauce mixture.  

I grilled the chicken (which I pounded to about ½ inch thickness) on the George Forman grill for 6 minutes (@ 350 degrees), spread the chicken with the sauce on both sides, and grilled for an additional 2 minutes.  It was perfect.

With respect to the Peach halves…only 2 out of 7 of us liked it, so not sure if I would make that again.  But if you like warm peaches…go for it.

Everyone enjoyed this dish.  Only changes were minor - doubled the recipe then added 1 Tbl of cider vinegar to marinade, next time I would purée the peach preserves so no peach chunks to slide off the chicken on to the grill, a little more soy (low sodium), finish the chicken then turn up grill for the peaches and cook less time so that they stay a little firmer.  Made way more chicken so that there would be leftovers but had way less leftovers than expected.  I guess the sign that it was a hit. Served with the awesome corn pudding, real nice compliment.  Great summertime meal.

Very bland. Needs hot pepper flakes? We didn't feel this recipe.

Cooked this the other night. It was delicious! Love the peach sauce. We have had a good peach crop so had fresh peaches from our trees. Will definitely cook again!

Ok I made a few changes but this was great!! I only had 1 1/2 cups of unsweetened peach preserves so I adjusted the other ingredients and then added about 1/8 or 1/4 cup local honey.  I will definitely make this again.

This is an oldie but goodie and I had to laugh when I saw someone crediting Bobby Flay. He probably got the recipe from his grandmother, as it has been around that long. (My grandmother called it Duck Sauce.) As another reviewer did, I sautéed my chicken and finished it with the sauce, serving it over rice. Apricot preserves also work well. Also good with pork chops and probably duck!
