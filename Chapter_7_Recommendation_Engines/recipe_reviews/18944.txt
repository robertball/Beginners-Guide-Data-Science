My hubby had the idea to use vanilla vodka instead of plain. Wow that was over the top yummy!! You definitely don't need all that grenadine it's just extra calories but it does add a pretty color to the drink:o) This is also good with plain pineapple juice if the combo orange-banana-pineapple isn't available.

My guests loved this recipe. I made a huge pitcher of it and served throughout my party. My one exception I really lowered the amount of the grenadine. I made it a second time with the recommened amount and it was far to syrupy. Great recipe!

This punch has quite the reputation amongst my friends and their friends...I turned it into a punch for a party I hosted quite some time ago...now every time I throw a party inevitably one of the invitees will ask if I made "THAT punch"...but watch out...and be sure you've got some trusty dd's around...even the hardcore drinkers were under the table and still at my house at about 5 in the morning!

So tasty that you can't tell there's alcohol. I doubled the vodka but that's just a preferance. I could see how these could sneak up. This would be good blended like a daquiri.

This recipe was a huge hit at my birthday party this summer. I did agree with using less of the Grenadine. I used 1 full bottle of both the vodka and the malibu.. and only 12oz of the grenadine and did use the pineapple orange juice since i had a few guests that dont much like bananna. For fun i did freeze chunks of pineaple to add to the glasses as a tasty touch. Will definatly make again!!

This was pretty good but next time I will make it with only orange and pineapple juice. The banana didn't do it for me.

The favorite punch of the three I made for my niece's shower. I didn't use coconut flavored vodka just the plain old variety. Wasn't a drop left.
