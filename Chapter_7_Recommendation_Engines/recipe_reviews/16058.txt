This is very similar to a recipe that has been handed down in my family for over 100 years. If you think this cake is good the first day, then why don't you put it int he fridge and let it set 3 days. The flavors meld beautifully and it is great cold. I even use it for wedding cakes. It is a stately, elegant, rich cake that will take your breath away.

i love this recipe. I recently learned how to make it from my grandma who is form Kentucky. She told me they would put in the attic for a week, where it wasn't heated so it would moisten. As far as and icing she taught me to in a pot put a cup of brown sugar and about 2 tbs. of butter and cook till like a syrup. Then poor over, this is where it becomes moist and a sweet topping.

soaked raisins and nuts in whisky (I keep a tub of whiskey soaked raisins in the pantry all the time), added ground cloves, nutmeg and cinamon, sans coconut-my dude doesn't always care for it. I could not stop eating this cake. When you're at the warehouse store and see the two huge jars of blackberry jam, fear not! This recipe will use it up!

I skipped the sugar altogether since the cup of jam, raisins and coconut each make it sweet enough. The cake was delicious the way I made it. Also, like another reviewer suggested, I added in some spices (vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves) - I'm afraid without them the cake would have been quite bland.   Also, my cake turned completely purple once I added in the preserves!

A truly satisfying cake.   I wanted to use up some strawberry jam.    I didn't have pecans so I used almonds.  One other change was 3/4 of the amount of sugar.  I took it right out of the bundt pan and it didn't stick at all.  My husband was watching me take it out and he cheered.

I was so disappointed, though the cake baked perfectly and looked so good it was far too sweet and bland, even my husband who likes sweet, agreed, a waste of good ingredients as I threw it out! I was surprised there were no spices in the recipe, I should have followed my instincts and added some and cut back on the sugar. I did not soak the pecans in Bourbon as suggested, maybe I should have! I will stick to the recipe my friend from Kentucky gave me, more work but worth the effort. I tried this one because I had leftover buttermilk from making Soda Bread so was looking for a new way to use it up, but this cake just did not work out for us.

Excellent.  I added a little extra coconut and also added some walnuts.  Made a glaze to drizzle over and yum.  I made it with Splenda and could not even tell it!  Will make again for sure!
