I found this recipe a few months ago while looking for meal prep ideas. 
After reading some reviews on the blandness, I decided to add taco seasoning to the meat. I also added a can of mexican fiesta corn in addition to the beans and tomatoes. Just mix it all together in a large pot, I dont put it in the oven.
Came out great and my husband requests this at least twice a month for his lunches. Send it with some tortillas.

Made as written and this was okay but it was a little on the bland side. I ended up adding some taco seasoning and that improved the flavor. I used the mexican flavored Rotel that is seasoned with lime and cilantro and was glad I did.  This recipe is super simple and filling but it needs more than just salt and pepper to get a taco flavor in my opinion.
