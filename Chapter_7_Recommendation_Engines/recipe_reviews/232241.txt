This is a really easy and quick recipe to make. I spooned mine into individual mini muffin cups and topped with a Candy Cane Kiss.  I also just left them to cool overnight on my kitchen counter and they set up just fine.

After 4 hrs in the fridge it was just a sticky mess clinging to the tin foil.

This recipe did not work for me! It didn't harden to the correct consistency even though I did everything correctly. Though it tasted yummy, we had to eat it with a spoon as we couldn't even slice it.

Super easy recipe to make but not so easy to eat!  It was a gooey mess in the pan. Not able to cut it into squares at all.  Very disappointing!

This recipe gets a 2 because it tastes good, but doesn't set up properly. However, if you wanted to cover a cake in fudge or something like that, it might work well. It sets VERY soft. Not to a consistency where you could cut it into squares.
