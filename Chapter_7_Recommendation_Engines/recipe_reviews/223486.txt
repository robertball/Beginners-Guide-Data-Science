I've made this twice now, the first time it was fine as is, but people weren't crazy about it and there was more than I expected left over.  So the next time I made it I added curry powder and that did the trick.  Everyone loved it and this time there was none left over my the end of the night.  Thanks for sharing.

Would recommend that you "completely" drain your pineapple and then add the juice as needed.  I ended up with a spread that had too much juice and then had to drain it.  Nothing fancy here, just a nice, simple cheese spread that you can put together in minutes.  You get a good balance of sweetness from the pineapple and savory from the chopped onion.

I made this for a potluck at work and before I had a chance to go get some it was gone.  People loved it and kept asking how I made it.  I am making it again for our next potluck but will double it.  The only thing I did differently was I didn't add the onion in it.

1.1.15 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/223486/pineapple-and-cheese-spread/ ... I started to drain the pineapple, as suggested by the other two reviews, but I bought Dole & there wasn't much to drain.  I just mixed it in with the cream cheese then added the cheese; then, green onion & 1/8t cayenne.  'Thinking sour cream or half sour, half cream cheese would be better.  It's heavy & on the bland side.  Maybe subbing & less is the key.  'Glad I tried it, but it barely got touched.
