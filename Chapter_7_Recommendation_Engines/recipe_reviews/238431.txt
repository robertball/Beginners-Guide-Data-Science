Ok, so honestly, I didn't follow recipe but used almost the ingredients listed.  I just added nutella, and honey and half and half and vanilla extract.  I just tasted as I went.  I feel like I added more half and half than the ratio listed to get a smooth and thinner sauce.  I used it for beignet dipping and it was AMAZING.  Lots of love from the hubby and all my friends that tried it.  Heated in microwave and reheated well.  YUM!  A keeper.
