Nice change from the usual!  I usually just steam or saute with a little olive oil, garlic and salt & pepper, but was in the mood for something different.  Only used 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and that was plenty!  Added a splash of red wine vinegar before serving, not that it needed it really, but supposedly a little vinegar on your greens will help your body to better absorb the calcium in them.

Good flavor -- more than a little spicy!  A few helpful hints: 12 cups fresh spinach = 1 lb = 1/2 cups cooked spinach.  So at the end of this recipe, you'll have about 1 1/2 cups of food.  I used diced dried apples instead of golden raisins, and this worked well.  You'll need a big pot in the beginning in order to hold all the spinach, but it whithers quickly.

Pretty good recipe, although I must admit I altered mine quite a bit. I didn't have golden raisins so I used roughly chopped dried cherries. their tart/sweet combo worked well.  I also added slivered almonds and a few splashes of red wine vinegar both suggestions from previous reviews. I noticed before I added the vinegar, this dish was somewhat bitter, but after the addition of the vinegar the bitter was gone and I liked the dish much more. I think I might try making it again.

Very different for those like me who are "boring" salt & pepper cooks. I didn't have golden raisins so I used regular raisins, added some sliced almonds, and red wine vinegar as others had suggested. Didn't care for it with first bite, but it grew on me. I would try this again, but I would add some more red wine vinegar when I dish-it-up.

Liked this a lot.  It came out great.  We all should eat more high iron foods like spinach and here's an easy way to accomplish that.

a wonderful side my husband loved it!! I used the red wine vinegar like a few others. The raisins were a nice addition. Then because I was in the mood for a nutty flavor I added some cashews...I think next time I will use almonds.Terrific! Thanks, Cookinmomma

Didn't like the raisins and had to pick them out before I could finish my bowl.  Cut way back on the red pepper as the kids wouldn't eat it otherwise.  I used 1/2 spinach, 1/2 beet greens.  Excellent, thanks!

The garlic,red pepper flakes and s&p gave the spinach an entirely new flavor for me. Excellent.  However, I didn't add the golden raisins because I liked it a lot without them. I won't be able to eat plain spinach again. Will definitely serve this for company.
