So Yummy! Wasn't sure I'd like it, afraid there might be too much going on for my tastes but I was mistaken.  It was fabulous! Made a few changes.  Forgot the green onions, had sugar snap peas instead of regular peas and used goat cheese instead of bleu.  Every bite is so full of flavor.  And the dressing really brought out the flavors rather than masking them.  BF didn't beleive me when I told him the secret ingredient was lemonade.  I made extra dressing to have whenever I put a salad together.  I'll feel a lot less guilty using this delicious dressing than smothering my salad in some creamy concoction.  Spinach and Strawberry Salad has been my fav for a few years but this beats it, hands down. Well done, Sunny, well done.

This recipe would get 10 stars if I had the option!  The color was phenomenal, and the combination of ingredients, down to the lemonade based dressing was amazing.  My family thoroughly enjoyed this salad, and I will be adding this to my Summer menu when I have friends over.  Thanks, Sunny B for such an innovative and delicious recipe!

I must be all alone here but I did not care for the ingredients in the salad itself. I just thought the combination did not compliment each other at all - however, the dressing rocked! Wow I absolutely loved it.  Will certainly be using it on a combination of salad ingredients to suit us.

This is a delicious salad that's just so full of flavor. I omitted the grapes and celery (personal preference) and subbed walnut oil for peanut. I love the light dressing--it gives flavor without being overpowering or oily, and the hot sauce gives it the tiniest kick. Next time, I may add raisins. Naturally, it got soggy the next day, but the flavor was still great.

Wonderful salad!  This recipe proves there is something to be said for monochromatic dishes - you don't always need to have every color of the rainbpw represented!  The light lemony flavor of the dressing, the various shades of green, the addition of peas and fruit remind me of spring.  I did substitute goat cheese for the bleu due to my own personal tastes.  Truly a beautiful, tasty and refreshing salad!  Other than the cheese, the only change I made was to toss in a handful of chopped fresh parsley because I had some left over from another dish I was making - mint would be lovely here, too.  I might add a bit of garlic to the dressing next time, and maybe bump up the lemon juice a bit.  Thanks for sharing!

Really different, gourmet-like.  This would be a nice salad to impress a dinner party.  Hubby and I liked it a lot, the kids not so much.

Oh Sunny how I truly love you after making this!  Restaurant quality by far!  The only thing I did differently (I HATE it when people say that) is that I served the bleu cheese on the side along with a side bowl of feta.  That way my non-bleu cheese loving friends had an alternative, and there were a few in the crowd.  AMAZING salad and that bleu cheese makes the dish.  WOW!  Everyone loved it!  Thanks to you!

I'm not a huge fan of bleu cheese but hubby loves it so i gave this a try. I made exactly as written and this salad was delicious. Instead of mixing the dressing in the entire salad, we topped the individual servings so as to preserve the leftovers. I was amazed at how well this held up in an airtight container in the fridge. Was just as good the next day. The apples werent even brown. Thanks Sunny for a great summer salad!

Oh yes! This is the jazz! Just go to be aware, it's a tad liquid so make sure you toss well before serving. I screwed up the apple selection and put cooking apples in. Bit tart so I added some brown sugar and it was a treat. Great for parties and a 15 serving goes round 20 people easy. Nice one SunnyByrd!

We loved it - all those different flavors just popped in your mouth.  When I first tasted the dressing I was not impressed but poured over the salad it was delicious. I thought the addition of the blue cheese was fantastic but my guy liked it without it so the next time I will just pass around the blue cheese for people to add or not!  There are leftovers and I'm looking forward to it tonite.  Thanks submitter.

I saved this recipe when SunnyByrd used to blog and it is one of the oldest recipes in my recipe box.  I finally had the chance to make it and all I can say is DEEEE-lish-ous!  I didn't change a thing other than doubling the recipe because I took it to a potluck at work.  It was enjoyed by all and one of my coworkers said that "the lovely flavors of the salad danced over her tongue."  The next time I make it, I will add a little more oil because the dressing didn't "cling" quite as well as I like.  Other than that, fantastic!  Great mix of sweet, tart, spicy, crunchy and creamy.  A real winner!  Thanks SunnyByrd!

We really liked this salad-the vinaigrette complimented all the fruits and veggies nicely.  I made this ahead of time, but added the apples right before serving so they wouldn't brown.

Good salad! The dressing was very light, perfect for summer. I used Gala apple instead of Granny Smith because that's what I had, I also omitted the green peas and blue cheese just a preference.

The salad was nice and tasty. The dressing was a disappointment.

This was a beautiful salad, and I was really excited to eat it, but it just had too much going on.  In particular, I didn't care for the bitter elements, especially the green bell pepper.  The dressing tasted good.  It didn't stick well to the salad because it had so little oil, but I hate to recommend bumping up the oil content of the dressing just to make it coat the other ingredients better.

What a gorgeous salad and oh so tasty!  Loved the light lemony dressing and the crispness of the fruit and veggies.  Opted for feta since I'm the only blue cheese eater in the house.  Made way more than 4 servings unless you're serving this as a main course.  I did as someone else suggested and only dressed the portions we ate.  Tomorrow will tell how well it kept.  I did top with a half cup of chopped walnuts.
