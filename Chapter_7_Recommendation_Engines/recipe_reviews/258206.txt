I used the free recipes at KETOCOOKBOOK (dot) ORG and lost 25 pounds of fat in a month! I’ve never lost weight so fast!! The Keto Diet really is amazing because it forces the body to always burn fat for energy — so you lose the fat and keep it off. If you’re interested in starting the Keto diet, I highly recommend using these 150 recipes. It helped me learn what ketosis is, what the Keto Diet looks like, and how to induce ketosis in your body so you start burning fat (instead of protein and carbs) for energy. Use the free recipes at KETOCOOKBOOK (dot) ORG if you’re ready to change your life and weight - it’s really a very easy (and tasty) diet to follow.
