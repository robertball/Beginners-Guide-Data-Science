Delicious! Perfect for a "quick" breakfast! I froze my fruit and used fresh pineapple juice. I love ways to incorporate wheat germ and this was really good - definitely fresh and fruity!

Pretty good.  I added about a cup of ice cubes to the blender though after tasting it.

This was good, but made a lot! I have a pretty large blender and it was filled to the brim. Would suggest making in two batches to make sure everything gets mixed well. Left out the wheat germ since I didn't have any on hand and used frozen strawberries.

Delicious!  I left out the wheat germ because I didn't have any and no matter how I try to discuise it my kids can always tell.  I also used frozen strawberries because I like the thicker shake.  I didn't have pinapple juice, so I used a pineapple snack cup and only 1 banana.  I loved it!  Next time I will make it for breakfast and leave out the banana.  I loved the combo of the strawberries and pinapple - friends liked it too!

Pretty good. I used frozen bananas which made it nice and cold and thickened it up nicely. The kids and I enjoyed it.

LOVED THIS!  I cut the recipe in half and added about a cup of ice cubes to the blender.  I used half pineapple juice and half orange juice.  Great way to add in the wheat germ, it works perfectly with this!  Thanks for the recipe!

I have had this in my recipe box since 2003 and never made it because I never buy pineapple juice!  So I made it today with apple juice instead.  It was very yummy.  I scaled it back to 2 servings and put in about 8 ice cubes.  I also used ground flax instead of wheat germ. It was very yummy and filling!

This is soooo delicious!  I ran out of pineapple juice one day and used cherry juice; both ways were equally tasty.  This is a breakfast I feel good about eating.

It was alright, but the wheat germ was very strong.  I may try it again, but use less or substitute oatmeal.  It was also thinner than I usually like, I may try using the ice that others suggested.  It looked like it makes a lot so I cut the recipe by half right away and it was a good amount for my blender.

Absolutely delicious and refreshing!! Everyone loved this. Beware- this recipe consumes the entire blender. It stored nicely, though, in a tupperware beverage container that I have. I made this exactly as stated in the recipe first and it was crowded, but wonderful. After the first 2 glasses were poured, I had room so I decided to try adding ice as some had suggested. It didn't really thicken it, but it did dilute the wonderful flavor a bit. I liked that it was a bit colder, but it was nice and cold after being in the refrigerator without diluting the flavor. I would suggest trying it (maybe only half of the recipe) first and refrigerate some to taste later, too. I liked the consistency as it was, but if you want it a bit thicker, instead of watering down the flavor, add more banana, yogurt, or strawberry to suit your taste preference. Using frozen banana might even help to thicken it. Be creative, but I don't think you should water it down which is ultimately what happens when you add ice. By the way, I did not have any wheat germ and didn't want any, so I did not put any into this drink. This was so wonderful, but so very simple to make. Thank you for posting this recipe! This is one to make again and again.

Yummy breakfast! The only change I made was to omit the yogurt because I wanted to be thinner.    My frozen bananas already made it thick enough.  I also added a couple of ice cubes in it.

I thought this had a nice flavor. Only issues, was I thought it was a tad thin. I even used frozen strawberries and fruit, so I was surprised by that. Only thing I did different was make 1/2 recipe and it made 2 large or 3 small servings.

Very quick and easy to make!  Really good too.  I think next time I will freeze my fruit so it's extra cold when I make it.  I was able to sneak the wheat germ in and nobody knew it was there too!

A very good strawberry banana smoothie! It was fast and easy, good for mornings. I mistakenly put in frozen whole strawberries, they just turned to frozen balls of ice in my blender and didn't break up as I hoped. Next time I will use fresh strawberries and increase the wheat germ, I just like the texture.

Very nice smoothie.  I found this while trying to find a fruit salad for all of the fruit we have in the house.  I didn't find a fruit salad  but I found this and thought I'd give it a shot since it's just me this morning and I was going to only have toast.  I scaled it to one serving and it still is a lot.  I rarely have smoothies and even rarely make them myself, so I thought it would be a nice change.  I used my food processor (no blender) and I don't have pineapple juice, so I used peach nectar.  The rest of the ingredients I had and they work well together.  Very nice smoothy!  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! I made it exactly as written except I used vanilla Greek style yogurt because that's what I had. The reason I gave this drink 4 stars instead of 5 is because I was not full after drinking, but I can usually eat a fairly large breakfast. I'll definitely be making this again!

This was pretty basic and nothing special.
