I made this for my daycare kids lunch and they loved it!! I thought it was great! Very easy and fast. Changes I made: Used long grain white rice (not instant), half an onion, 2 red mini sweet bell peppers, added 1 clove garlic chopped, 1 can diced tomatoes with mild green chilies, grated cheddar cheese on top. This is a meal that my husband will love so I plan on making it again.

We just got done eating this so I thought I'd write a quick review.  This was pretty good with the changes I made based on other reviews.  I added a large clove of garlic, minced, a can of drained black beans, and a large red pepper instead of green.  I used the full 2 tablespoons of chili powder, and  did NOT drain the diced tomatoes.  Maybe the person who said the result was soupy didn't drain the grease out after browning the ground beef with the peppers and onions. I used plenty of salt and pepper but still think next time I make it I will add some worchestershire sauce.  Don't get me wrong, it was more then edible; my son had 2 helpings!  It just could have used a touch more zip.  Thanks for a good base recipe...an update 11/12/08: If you are using a good brand of chili powder, you may want to cut back to one tablespoon...the first few times I made this I used "bargain" chili powder (.99)and 2 tablespoons was fine...this last time I used McCormick's and 2 tablespoons made it a little too spicy for us.  Oh, also, I used muenster cheese, because that's what I had, now THAT was good.

This was great! We all loved it. I doubled the bell pepper, used brown rice instead of instant white and shredded cheddar instead of processed American, and I also added Tabasco and Worcestershire for some spice. Definitely a keeper at our house.

This was very good.  I made this a lot easier though.  Bought diced tomatoes with green pepper already in them.  Only needed to use 1 pan as well.  Brown ground beef and drain.  Add all ingredients, including uncooked rice.  Simmer covered for 15-20 minutes.  Put cheese slices on top and they melt just fine.  Rice will also be cooked.

This is a simple, easy, quick dinner and my kids loved it. The only thing I did differently was I added black beans and 2 cloves of garlic. I also added a packet of mild Chili seasoning because I felt it was a little bland. Instead of sliced cheese I used a fiesta blend cheese in a bag and sprinkled it liberally over the casserole. Thanks for the recipe it's a keeper.

I thought this was a little bland. I did only use 1 Tbsp chili powder, for the kids' sake, but I could probably have used the 2 the recipe calls for. The flavor was very tomatoey and the meat didn't have much taste. I will probably make this again, but next time I'll add garlic salt and maybe some celery other veggie to the dish.

This is really good.  I'm giving it five stars based on some simple, basic changes.  I read other reviews about it being bland, so I sauteed some minced garlic.  I added a can of chili beans (others suggested black beans, but I didn't have any), & a few dashes of worchestershire.  I substituted jasmine rice for instant and used yellow and orange peppers instead of green.  The rest of the ingredients were the same, except I only added 1 T chili powder because I included the liquid with the chili beans.  I think I made too much rice because I needed a 15 ounce can of tomato sauce when others thought it was soupy - mine was too dry.  I will make this again!!!  Kids even liked it.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I added garlic and cut back on the onion when browning the ground beef. The only bad comment I got was next time make more cause there wasn't enough.

A very good base recipe to add whatever you want.  We replaced instant rice with regular (keep in mind instant rice requires 1:1 ratio where regular rice is 2:1 water and rice).  We also used cheddar instead of that nasty processed American cheese stuff and added Tabasco Chipotle for a little heat.  The dish also could use some texture so we'll try crumbling tortilla chips over the top next time, but I could see Fritos going nicely on top if you're into that.

This was very good.  I used 1/4 each of red, yellow, orange and green bell peppers.  I thought the black beans sounded like a good idea but I didn't have any and used a can of pinto beans with jalapenos instead.  I don't care for processed american cheese so I used cojack.  I'm about to have a serving of the left overs right now, yummy!

Ok, this is really really good.  I just got through eating this and I was actually impressed.  I did take the advice of another member and added some Ranch Style beans and put it over buttermilk cornbread-YUM!  I also put a dollup of sour cream on top of it all.  

As far as tweaking the recipe, I used 2 cups of water and 2 cups of rice, I added several dashes of worchestershire sauce.  I also used diced tomatoes that had peppers and onions already in them-but I did brown the ground beef with a 1/4 of chopped up onion.  I also put in a teaspooon of celery salt and used a WHOLE 14 oz can of tomatoe sauce.

Over all, this is an EXCELLENT recipe.  My daughter, husband AND myself all went back for seconds!  My daughter ate her seconds with tortilla chips for a change and she said is AWESOME!  This would be very good in a slow cooker this fall!

Ridiculously awesome! One of my guests even commented about passing the recipe on to his boss (owns a restaurant). I did make a little bit of changes just due to lack of supplies. I did not use the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, or green peppers. Instead I used pizza sauce (all I had!) and 1/2 cup chunky salsa. Also instead of regular white rice I used the black beans & rice mix you can find in the Latin (or ethnic?) food section. I also covered the whole top of the casserole dish with the processed American cheese... as I love cheese :)   If I would suggest anything to anyone about changing the recipe it would be change out for the black beans & rice instead... it totally adds the missing kick!

This was very easy to make, but I didn't think it was very good.  It was very runny.  Maybe draining the diced tomatoes would've helped that.  I like a thicker sauce.  Won't be making this again.

This was very good.  I reduced the chili powder to 1 T since I was feeding a toddler -- also chopped the veggies, including the tomatoes, very fine.  Omitted cheese since daughter is allergic.

She really ate it up!  

As I prepared it, I would rate it a 4 star recipe...but I'm sure including the cheese would have been kicked it up a notch.

I used long grain rice and omitted the tomato sauce and the water.  I used 1/2 cup chicken broth, Mexi blend cheese instead of American cheese and a can of pinto beans (liquid included) instead of the corn. I also added 2 minced garlic cloves and seasoned everything with Lawry's Seasoned salt, black pepper and cumin. We liked it.

Very good and quick.  My kids loved it!  I didn't use instant rice.  I used regular rice, cooked it and add it all together to bake.  I also used only 4 - 6 oz of tomato sauce so it wouldn't have an overpowering tomato tatse. Other than that it's awesome and I  will be making periodically.

I made as written with the exception of using processed cheese.  We used real shredded 4 cheese Mexican.  Can't stand the processed stuff.  I found it very, very bland.  My kids and husband thought it was ok...but they weren't overly impressed.

I would have given this 5 stars, but I changed the recipe up a bit.  
I added peas, yellow and red bell pepper.  The diced tomatoes I used had jalapeños and peppers in it, so I omitted the chili powder and I sprinkled with cheddar cheese.  I also used brown rice.  
So delicious, will be making again for sure!

This was a lot better than I thought it would be. I did make a few changes such as omitting the bell pepper (didn't have any on hand) added several cloves of minced garlic, small can of green chiles and a dash of cumin & cayenne pepper. Amazingly both my teenage daughters enjoyed it. Next time I'll try adding some black beans as suggested by several people.

This was a good recipe. I added creole seasoning to the ground meat while it was cooking. I used salsa instead of the diced tomatoes. I also added cumin and red pepper flakes with a touch of paprika to the beef mixture in addition to the chili powder with a couple more dashes of creole seasoning. I didn't have any cheese so I had to omit that, but I can tell that it would have put this dish over the top. I really liked it. My 3-year-old didn't, but she's picky so that's not saying much. :) This dish tastes like spanish rice with gound beef and cheese.

Excellent! Didn't have any green pepper on hand, so I doubled the onion. Turned out great...very simple, inexpensive, and filling! I will definitely be making again!

My mother used to make this when we were kids. After I got married I tried to make it for my husband. My mother never showed us how to make it and I didn't have a phone to ask her how. I also didn't know what it was called so by trial and error I made it using my memory of what it should taste like. My mother never did know what it was called and I thought she just made it up. Imagine my suprise to stumble on this old family recipe on this sight and finaly have a name to give it when I serve it to my family. Thank you

Very easy to make! I used 2 cups of rice, because 1 just didn't look like it would be enough. I also used a frozen bag of Gumbo Vegetable Medley, which is basically peppers, corn, and okra. Dethawed the frozen veggies by putting them in a pot on the stove with 2 cans of Roasted Red Pepper Diced Tomatoes. Mixed the cooked beef, cooked rice, and veggies in a large casserole dish and topped with a bag of Colby & Monterrey shredded cheese. Only put it in the oven for about 10 minutes, to melt the cheese since everything was basically cooked. Instead of chili powder I used quite a bit of Garlic Pepper because we love the stuff! Will make again!

We thought this was great!  Followed recipe exactly except added 2 cloves of garlic to the meat while browning.  Also, be sure to cut your onion & green pepper in large chunks.  Thanks for sharing!

it was alright.  I though that it tasted better with chips or tacos instead of eating it on its own.  Good as a filling dip. Easy to prepare though.

This meal was wonderful! My husband and I really enjoyed it and this also made for great left overs.  I made a few changes, when browning the meat I added minced garlic with the onions and bell peppers, for seasoning I used cumin, celantro along with the salt & pepper.  And instead of adding the cheese before placing in the oven, I did afterward.

My family loved this recipe, I used leftover rice instead of using minute rice and used diced italian tomatoes and used shredded cheese on top, only a tiny bit leftover and very economical when ground beef on sale, I made this for about $6.00 for a family of 5. Thanks!

A very good one dish recipe!! I used frozen cooked corn instead of the canned variety. I also used velveeta cheese for the top, very tasty and great when reheated. I think I might try this with red peppers next time for the added kick.

This is quick and easy. My whole family loved it and had seconds. I made some substitutions, just used what I had in the pantry. I had 1/2 tsp chili powder so I substituted 1/2 pack of taco seasoning(the dry powdered kind) and extra tomato sauce since I didn't have canned tomatoes or cheese. It was still good. We will have this again at our house.

This was quick and esy to make.  Tasted a bit like stuffed peppers.  Very Good.  I used a little more rice than recipe called for and also extra cheese.  My husband and 15 month year old like it too! Will definately make it again.

I was a little skeptical while making this, but it turned out tasting great! Everybody loved it! It kind of tastes like goulash but with a kick. We served it with bread and butter. Lots of leftovers! (Probably could serve up to 8 people.)

This stuff was so good! I served it with plain sourdough toast and I loved it. My non-picky child loved it, too and the other liked it, she just picked out the onions.
I will definately make this a regular meal for our family. Thanks Suzanne!

I didn't care for this recipe.  It was more of a mish-mosh of ingredients than a casserole.  It tasted okay, but looked awful.  More of a side-dish than a main course casserole.  Won't make it again.

It was good, but I think I'd add less chili powder.  We added a cup of frozen peas - we'll make it again and alter it a bit.  It was just a bit bland (under the mask of chili powder)

This was a wonderful meal that both my husband and I really enjoyed.  We don't like tomatoes so we left them out and added more corn than what the recipe called for.  The only thing I will change next time is not to use the processed cheese.  I didn't care for that flavor.  Next time I will try cheddar.

I found this recipe to be quite good. It's sorta like a beefed up Spanish rice. My wife loves Spanish rice and was impressed with this casserole. I on the other hand am not a big Spanish rice fan but I did enjoy this. I'm sure this is one that will be made again.

This was wonderful -- true comfort food and so easy!  My husband absolutely loved it.  I used regular rice rather than minute rice (cooking it longer, of course).  I thought the amount of rice in the recipe was perfect.  We'll definitely be making it again.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I did not make it exactly like the recipe. I added a red pepper and instead of 2 onions I used 1 and instead of baking it I put it in the crockpot and instead of sliced cheese I used shredded cheese. It was very good. The wife and I could not stop eating it

I loved it!  I made a number of changes and I will list them here.
I didn't have any chili powder, so I added 1 tbs of taco seasoning and sprinkled red chili pepper flakes to taste.
I cooked up 1 cup of basmati rice with 2 cups water before beginning.  I used 1 large onion chopped, orange pepper instead of green for color.  I also added some chopped fresh mushrooms because I like them, but I didn't add enough to make a difference.  I used about a tbs of minced garlic and salt and pepper to taste. I defrosted about 1 1/2 cups frozen corn in the microwave instead of canned corn..  Also, I Lastly, after reading several reviews, I crumbled some whole grain crackers to try and add crunch (didn't notice them when eating), and perhaps most importantly, I grated about 2 cups of cheddar cheese to completely cover the top. Delicious!! We couldn't stop eating.  I will definitely make this again!

I made some changes.  I used pinto beans, 4 oz chopped green chili's, Worcestershire sauce, beef bullion, minced and powdered garlic and Nature Season.  I cut way back on he chili powder because I have one daughter that thinks she doesn't like it.  I added the dry rice (with a little extra water) right into the skillet.  I used velvetta and just stirred it in until melted.  I did it all in the skillet, no oven.  My picky one didn't really like it but, my other daughter and I liked it a lot.  I will make it again.

I make it without the corn and love it. Also I tip with cheddar not American cheese it has better flavor. My mom swears she invented this recipe when we lived in College Station, TX 40 years ago.

Love the recipe, which reflects the one my husband's beloved mom used to make when he was a kid. Substitutions: quinoa for the rice, and grated Parmesan on top. Mmmmm.

Sorry, but hubby and I thought this didn't meld well. Plus I didn't  have American cheese so I used what I had on hand, sharp cheddar. The cheese flavor totally took over as the main flavor!  That was so much my fault as to my out come of my meal. I will try this recipe again as I think it deserves another try. I really liked the sound of these combinations.

DH really liked this, I just thought it was OK.  I did add some Worcestershire, a chopped onion and some garlic.  I used shredded cheddar instead of American cheese.  I think you could just cover your skillet with a lid after topping with cheese - I don't think the baking part is necessary.

Pretty good!  I added a can of kidney beans to the mix.  Added 2C of water and 1C of regular rice to the beef and just made it all on the stove top, cooking for about 35 minutes.  Hearty and satisfying.

This use to be my go to recipe in college to make for a crowd, cheap and easy. I had forgotten all about it until I saw it here. Made it for my family and they loved it. We left off the cheese on top..added cornbread and a salad and made a quick meal.

This is a delicious, easy-to-make, inexpensive dish that goes a long way.  Used brown rice instead of white, a little less onion and omitted the green pepper (and glad I did upon tasting the end result).  My diced tomatoes already had green chilies in them and as per others suggestions, I added one can of black beans.  Used shredded Monterey Jack cheese for the top.  So good!  Makes a lot and we ate it all week until it was gone.  I can see this being good made into a burrito with some sour cream and jalapenos!  Great recipe!!

I omitted the green pepper.  Added a can of drained black beans and garlic.  I used southwest style tomatoes (tomatoes with green chilies and cumin) instead of plain diced tomatoes.  I also used cheddar cheese because that is what I had.  Over all, definitely a recipe I will make again.

Made this recipe years ago as written. Since then have modified/added my preferred ingredients: diced,seeded jalapeno peppers,minced garlic,cumin and diced tomatoes with chile's. This version is for those that like their food spicier, kids and adults. Great original recipe and modified version.

For how quick and easy this was, I thought it was really really good! I did add a big clove of garlic to it, but that's the only thing I did differently. I will definately make this again.

I wasn't that impressed. I found this recipe to be very bland. I would definately change to cheddar cheese next time and figure out some way to spice it up. I only gave it two stars because my fiance and dad liked it.

I made this one night and my family loved it/  I looked at the reviews and tried to improvise with green chilis and cilantro.  Don't bother the original recipe was better.  I used shredded cheese though instead.

Great comfort food.  My wife and kids liked this a lot.  The kids' aversion to vegetables was not an issue.  I doubled everything but the tomatoes and it turned out fine.  Garlic salt is a good substitute for regular salt.

I added Worcestershire sauce and garlic to the meat, but it just tasted too tomato-ey still, so I added a can of kidney beans, and served over tortilla chips, and then people liked it.  Even my 2-year-old!  But I think the chips made it, really.

I was unsure of making this at first but i added a can of kidney beans and used a bag of mexican cheese instead of slices. I omited the green pepper due to food allergy and it was yummy, my 14mo old handed me his plate for some more. He loved it, so did my 11 and 5 year old, and then theres my hubby who said you can make this again its a keep sweetie! Thanks for the great recipe.

Very satisfying.  I added a can of black beans and didn't top it with cheese to cut back on cooking time.  I served it over corn chips.  My two-year-old said, "Thanks for the yummy food, Mom."  Leftovers are great with just a little bit of mayo.  Makes tons!

This recipe is great.  I do use ground turkey in place of the beef and shredded cheddar cheese in place of the American cheese.  My kids love it and ask for it often.

This makes plenty, I put it in two 8" square pans and froze one. Of course you don't have to use instant rice, I used regular long grain, because you cook it first so either one works. It seemed like a lot of chili powder for my taste, so I cut back on it and added some cajun seasoning instead. All in all, I'd make this again.

I was surprised at how good this was! My changes, I used long grain rice with cilantro added "cilantro rice from my page", Added cilantro to meat when cooking, added a can of peas and carrots, and topped it with fresh chedder and colby cheese. Really good recipe. My suggestion for future preparation is to add a tamale type crust. This would really bring it to life. I highly recommend that more people start experimenting with fresh cilantro. It really ads to many types of dishes....Good eating!

This recipe was wonderful. I did not use two tablespoons of Chili powder as I have two small kids but no complaints.

This turned out even better than I was expecting. I followed the advice of GOLDEN2930 & OTTERCOON and I used long grain rice instead of instant, 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chiles, no chili powder, and a few dashes of worcestershire sauce. Thanks!

I was really excited about all the 4 and 5 star ratings and couldn't wait to make this recipe.  Sadly tho, my family did not like it....my daughter said it tasted like cheap tex-mex.  While it was edible, it was not good.  I tried to think what I could do to enhance the flavor, but just don't think it can be done.  I'll pass on this one and leave it to those who rated it a 5.

Awesome.  My husband and I just loved this.  My oldest son hated it  because there was corn in it but my little guy loved it.  I did omit the chili powder because we don't care for spicy. I added garlic powder, basil, and oregano.I also added a 28oz can of tomato sauce because i thought it would be too dry after baking it.  I was glad I did because it turned out perfect.   I will definately make this again.

This is a terrific recipe for family or a crowd.  I often have overnight guests and everyone raves over this.  A good crusty bread and cantaloupe or honeydew chunks rounds this out just fine

When I was making this, I wasn't sure it was going to turn out well, but once it had baked in the oven it really set well. I did use regular cooked rice and used shredded cheddar because we just don't care for american cheese, but those are minor changes. It was a little too spicy for the kiddo, so I might try and tone it down a bit for her. But the hubby and I like spicy, and were pleased with the end result.

This is a good comfort food.  I used stewed tomatoes (all I had on hand), frozen corn, and brown rice.  I also used shredded cheddar instead of the American.  My boyfriend and I thought it was filling and yummy.  I'm having the leftovers right now and they're delicious!

I made this recipe lighter by using ground turkey instead of the beef, brown instant rice instead of white, light tex-mex cheese instead of the slices (personal taste preference) and added a can of pinto beans. It freezes and re-heats well. The portions are generous.

My husband and I really like this recipe. Next time though I think I might put in a little more beef, another half of a pound or so. My kids weren't too thrilled with it, but next time i will just make them some hot dogs.

My husband loved this recipe, I would cut down on the rice just a bit.  We will definately fix this again.
