Made the recipe just as it stated, and it was not only Delicious, but a huge hit with family members. Made it ahead, then put it in the fridge, then pulled it out to serve (room temp) as a side dish to a Smoked Turkey. Excellent dish to serve over the Summer, or to take to a Potluck.

YUM YUM and more YUM!  Simple and delicious! The cooking times are spot on. I liked that the asparagus were still a bit crisp. The lemon really makes the recipe, so don't skimp! I made the recipe as written. I used whole wheat pasta and served it warm. I tossed everything back into the pot, so no need to dirty a bowl. Next time I will grate my own parmesan cheese or buy the bagged, shredded variety. I only had the parmesan that comes in a shaker and it tends to turn slightly clumpy and pasty. I'll definitely make this again!

Easy to make, I thought it was okay but I am only giving it 3 stars because the rest of my family was not thrilled by this. Pretty healthy tasting dish but not for lemon-hating five year olds!

Very popular dish at our house!!  Delicious!! Did not boil the asparagus but sauteed it and added red onion, garlic, and sliced zucchini along with the asparagus.  Served warm and added the parmesan cheese when served.

Easy and fast to make. I'm a very picky eater and I found it very delicious. One large lemon seemed like alot though and over powered it a bit. I think next time it would be perfect with a small/med sized lemon. Over all very yummy and filling as a side or quick main dish

I rated it as 3 stars because my boyfriend LOVED this recipe but I thought it was so-so and my daughter did not like it at all.  I broiled the asparagus with a bit of olive oil, sliced lemon, and garlic, otherwise I followed the recipe.  I found it sour and bland.  I should have just eaten the asparagus as is (very tasty) and had some pasta with butter and cheese on the side.  But as I said, BF loved it and wants me to make it again.  We shall see...

pretty delicious, but not enough vegetable to pasta for my tastes. i would add sundried tomato, and  think some pine nuts would go well too. and neither of those would significantly contribute to increasing the prep time. i used whole wheat pasta.

That's WAY too much lemon. I'll try it again, but with about 1/2 the lemon and maybe some Greek yogurt to create a creamy sauce texture.

I gave 5 stars for how easy it was to make. As for taste, it taste like lemon and parmesan, a good taste. Nothing exciting just a good flavor. This is coming from a very picky eater who loves massive amounts of spices. You will likely love this. My husband made the mmgood sound through the whole meal. Followed recipe to the T.

I made it exactly as called for, but I found it to be bland, lacking flavor, and uninteresting.  There are lots of good recipes out there for asparagus and pasta, but this is not one of them.

I don't know how this went wrong, because we love asparagus, lemon and pasta... but we weren't huge fans of this! My one year old liked it! But the adults weren't a fan!

This is my recipe (notice I gave myself 5 stars? hehehe).  I wanted to say that if you use frozen grilled/cooked asparagus, cut the pieces into 2 inch pieces, then place on the bottom of your colander.  When you drain your pasta, the hot water from the pasta will thaw out the frozen asparagus.

The reason why I like this recipe (and how I came up with it) is that I can make it with items I generally have on hand in my frig or pantry.  If you are lucky enough to have frozen cooked asparagus (Trader Joe's), you can whip this baby up anytime.  As you can see from the different reviews, it's easily customizable to your family's taste.  Enjoy.

This was a huge hit. I didn't have any asparagus, so I substituted broccoli instead. Still worked great.

I give this recipe a high mark for the clean tasre and the ease of preparation.. I made this on a very warm day and served it just on the warm side.  A nice salad compliments this dish. I wll be making it again.

I could eat this every day for the rest of my life. Really!! Made the first time excatly as written-GREAT. It freezes well. Second time-added mushrooms and onions. Added a little less olive oil and added a little butter. Equally as good. Best recipe I have ever had. Who needs meat-think I'll go  back to being a veg. Thanks chop suey!!

We added garlic and diced chicken breasts and served this warm as a main dish.  Delicious.  Bright, simple flavors.  Cooking time was spot on.  Will be making this again when asparagus is in season.

I made the recipe as is using broccoli instead of asparagus because it is what I had in the house.  After tasting it I definitely think it needed more lemon juice because I was getting a strong olive oil flavor.  I think it is just going to depend on how big or how much juice your lemon yields. Just make sure you taste it to see if it needs adjustment.   I used the zest of one lemon, but, added the juice of another whole lemon because I was not getting a lot of juice out of it.  I liked it as is, but, my husband sprinkled some red pepper flakes into his and loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I added a huge bunch of kale, 1/4 of an onion, 2 cloves of garlic to the asparagus. I sauteed them in a bin pan in coconut oil added them to the lemon juice but did not add zest (BF doesn't like things too lemony). Added the cheese then the pasta and transferred everything back to a sauce pan (BF wasn't home yet/ don't want things getting cold!!) added the pepper and salt. OMG turned out amazing!!

Made pasta in instant pot, so altered recipe to sauté asparagus in olive oil with some Italian seasoning. Added cooked pasta, lemon zest and juice tp sauté pan  and added olive oil. It was fabulous.

I brought this as a cold dish to a cookout and it went over well.  Unlike other reviewers, I thought that the level of lemon flavor was just right.  Overall, though, I found the dish a little bland, and will add fresh herbs the next time I make it.

OMG.  I made this for my roommate & I tonight and all we did was fight about who was getting the last morsels!  I only used the tips of the asparagus in this recipe to eliminate any "chewy" issues.  Good recipe.

Beautiful and simple. I added some ricotta, milk and dried parsley and it came out great.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  I used whole wheat pasta, added toasted pine nuts, and used slightly less olive oil and Parmesan than called for because of dietary concerns. Other than that, I made it as is, and it will now become one of my go-to recipes.  Wonderful!

This is a great recipe, so simple but very good.  It's so easy to make and much healthier than cream based pasta recipes. You really need to make sure that you use the lemon juice and zest or the dish will be bland.

I tried this recipe today.  My husband is Gluten Intolerant so I made it with Gluten Free pasta.  It turned out so good I caught him warming the left over pasta as a snack in the evening.  Altho I thought I would try making it with butter the next time I make it, I will give it a 5 star rating.  I am on a diet but I always taste what ever I make for my husband; even I went for 2nds
