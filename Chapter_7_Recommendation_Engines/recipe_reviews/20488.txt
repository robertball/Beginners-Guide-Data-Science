Overall very good. I cut the recipe in half and partially microwaved the potatoes to cut down on cooking time. I upped the garlic a bit and added a little kosher salt to the mix. I love the pairing of fresh rosemary and thyme. These were very good especially when served with "Grilled Delmonico Steaks" from this site. I think next time though in order to get more of the garlic and herb flavor to come through I might use a foil pan and cube the potatoes then toss them with the olive oil garlic herbs and kosher salt and then cook them on the grill.

Skins got too burned on the grill (and I love to eat the skins). I do them in the oven - 400 degrees for the same time as the recipe.

Since my husband bowls on Friday nights & I wasn't feeling all that great (cold) I made these last night to go with our Valentines steak dinner. They were pretty good I made them in the microwave (I love my microwave it has a baked potato button & they "bake" perfect) so I sprayed them with pam cooking spray (instead of the oil) and wrapped them with the other ingredients in waxed paper. The rosemary was very distinct so I may cut it in 1/2 next time. Thanks Rick!

This really wakes up a baked potato. I followed the recipe except I left out the thyme. The rosemary infused its flavor throughout the potato. The olive oil garlic pepper and salt added their flavors also. This is really good. I will be making this recipe often.

If you bake these in the oven rubbed with EVOO and the spices and wrap these make a GREAT base potato for Potato Soup. Just cool slightly and cut each potato into eighths and continue with your soup recipe.

Too much rosemary for my taste but otherwise the herbs made a flavorful potato. Thank you!

The flavor of the herbs only flavors the skin but we like the skin. I pre-cooked the potatoes in the microwave because they were really big - double wrapped in heavy foil with the garlic and herbs. This is a nice recipe for summer time grilling. Thanks.

I loved this but for only 2 people I used dryed Rosemary and Thyme with fresh garlic. I poked holes in the potatos and cut then in half to cook faster. It was a hit thank you. Janiec

Instead of olive oil I rubbed the potatoes all over with Country Crock pretty good.

It was a little bland and needed some extra spice added to up the flavor. I didn't have rosemary but added some thyme.

I've made this recipe a number of times and keep coming back to it. I use only fresh herbs double the garlic and make sure there are lots of holes poked in the potato with a fork before adding the olive oil. We use a gas barbeque - and the potates take about 40 minutes on medium-high. Thanks for the recipe Rick.

These were good except I didn't care for the rosemary; I think I am just not a rosemary person. Thanks.

There's nothing extraordinary about this recipie. Deffinitely use fresh herbs I tried with dried and they didn't add much to the flavor.

I don't know why mine didn't turn out but I could only notice barely a hint of any flavor in the baked potato when all was said and done. So for me it was a waste of time and ingredients.
