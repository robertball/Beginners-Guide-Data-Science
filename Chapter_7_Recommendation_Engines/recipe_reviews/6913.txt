This is a delicious recipe--I poured about a 1/2 cup glaze of orange juice, powdered sugar, & vanilla over the loaf while it was still in the pan--just adds another layer of flavor to an already great mix of tart & sweet. Thanks Carol!

Oh My God!  This is a beautiful bread, both in taste and aesthetic.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and mixed up a simple glaze of orange juice, vanilla and confectioners sugar, drizzling it over the top while the loaf is still hot.  Gives it a gorgeous shine, and an initial sweet taste with the after tart of the cranberry.  If you're looking for a nice large loaf, for breakfast or afternoon tea...THIS IS THE ONE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR!  I will never use any recipe but this from now on...not even Nana's!

Wow! I think I have ended my search for a cranberry bread recipe.  This bread is just perfect, moist, relatively lowfat, and has lots of cranberries.  I found that the recipe makes a large loaf that took a longer time to bake than specified.  So, the next time I made it, I just doubled the batch and made 3 loaves and they baked perfectly.  Also, a double batch uses exactly one bag of fresh/frozen cranberries.  Another thing I did to improve the recipe was to drizzle the top with a powdered sugar icing (milk, vanilla, powdered sugar.)  This icing hardened nicely, and the result was superb!

This is an awesome recipe.  I cut my cranberries in half, did a double batch, & baked it in 3 loaf pans, as suggested by one of the reviewers, since my oven seems to be a little slow.  My 3 loaves were done in 55 minutes.  The flavor while still warm is amazing & it is still great after it cools.  It is a rich, well-balanced flavor.  It slices well after it cools completely.  This recipe is a keeper, & when I do it again I will try using 3 8"x4" loaf pans. I found the texture to be nice & my bread turned out nicely moist. Thank you to Carol & to the reviewers who had such good suggestions. P.S.  I tried the smaller loaf pans & the loaves came out taller, which I wanted.  They baked in 50 minutes.  The smaller size is easier to wrap in standard width plastic wrap, too.

This recipe is outstanding!  I used 5.75" X 3.25" pans (for gifts).  The recipe made 3 gift loaves and they were a HUGE hit!  I chopped the frozen cranberries in a food processor -- they mixed with the orange juice to make the bread a beautiful peachy color.  Even with the smaller pans, they took about an hour to bake.  YUM!

This really is an excellent recipe!  It should be illegal its so good!  The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because it seemed to need a bit more polishing for my tastes.  First, I rough chopped the cranberries because I know that biting into a whole cranberry can be offputting if you're not expecting that bitterness.  Second, I substituted melted butter, not margarine and lastly I added another egg, a touch of vanilla and left out the nuts.  Rather than "beating in" the flour, I just gave it a nice stir with a spatula until the flour was "just" combined.  Otherwise, your cranberries can break and run.  This bread was really taken up to the final notch with a glaze of powdered sugar, orange juice, orange zest and a touch of vanilla.. I drizzled it on the loaves when it was mildly warm.  So nice and festive and perfect for small gifts in decorative mini loaf pans... thanks so much for sharing.

I’ve been making this type of bread every year for the holidays and it is always a hit! I soaked the fresh cranberries in fresh orange juice and added lots of grated orange zest. When mixed the batter is thick, wet and fits right into the greased and floured 9x5 loaf pan. It baked up nicely in one hour and formed a brown colored top. The orange and cranberry scent was very aromatic throughout my house this morning. While I let the bread cool I made a glaze of ½ cup of powdered sugar mixed with just a little orange juice and orange zest to drizzle over the bread. The fresh orange juice and zest really emphasizes the fruity quality of this cranberry nut bread just as the submitter stated. The red juicy cranberries were peeking out everywhere in the bread. When sliced it is appealing to look at the cranberries imbedded in the bread as the contrasting colors of red and orange make a pretty bread. The combination of both sweet and tart is balanced in flavor but, nothing overpowering and the orange flavors really pop in the bread –so fresh tasting. The nutty pecans added a nice texture to the bread as well. The glaze just added another sweet layer of flavor. I found the ingredients, directions and baking time spot on. A beautiful delicious bread- perfect for the holidays and to give as gifts!

I was a little worried when I tasted the cranberries (I'd never had "raw" cranberries before, and were they bitter!), but it came out fabulous. Stealthily addictive: you keep coming back for one more piece or morsel without realizing it. It smelled fantastic cooking, and is a great combination use of in-season winter fruits - cranberries & oranges!

*I substituted splenda baking blend in this recipie.

I found this recipie very easy to make, and it didn't take very long, either. While the cranberries were a little more sour than expected, (perhaps halving them would help?) it was still a family-pleaser. I made this twice, and the second time i doubled the amount of grated orange zest, and I have to say, I think that evened out the cranberry. 
All in all it was fantastic and has proabbly made it's way into the "traditional" holiday recipies for my family.

This is my absolute favorite quickbread recipe.  the flavor is so bold, tangy-tart-sweet, and the texture is wonderful.  But of course, I make changes, :P. First, I don't use fresh cranberries, I used sweetened and dried.  One whole 6 oz package provides approx 1 1/2 cups of cranberries.  this way they are sweeter and distribute more evenly through the bread (since there are more, smaller berries).  I soak the berries in 1 cup of boiling orange juice before adding both to the batter.  This makes the cranberries plumper and they don't suck moisture out of the batter.  the orange juice also absorbs some of the cranberry flavor and color.  I also add about a tsp of vanilla to the wet ingredients. I also add spices to the dry ingredients.  A lot of cinnamon, just enough nutmeg to smell, and some ginger. All combined, this makes a very rich, moist and irresistable quickbread. Also, to make 6 giant muffins, bake for 30 minutes, or bake for 20 minutes in a regular sized muffin tin.

This bread is amazing!! (with a couple of very minor changes).  I cut the cranberries in half because I didn't like the idea of biting into a whole cranberry, and I added 1/4 c of sour cream to the ingredients.  After the bread had come out of the oven, I had to let it cool in the pan for a while before I could take it out (it started to stick to the bottom).  After inverting the bread onto a wire rack to finish cooling, I drizzled an orange glaze over the top...bread + glaze = to DIE for!!  I also agree with other reviewers, that this bread is definitely better the next day.  Make a day ahead if possible :~)  For the glaze: 1 c confectioners' sugar, 2 tbs fresh squeezed orange juice, 1 tbs clear vanilla extract.

Made this recipe for the daycare center kids where I work. Went over fairly well. I substituted fresh minced orange peel for the orange zest and added a little more orange juice since batter seemed a little thick. The density was very good and bread was moist. I would suggest using canned whole cranberry sauce in place of fresh cranberries for a more richer and sweeter taste. It also tastes better left in the refrigerator for a day or two. Overall good recipe.

Pros: Makes your house smell DELICIOUS as it's baking and tastes as good as it smells. Freezes and thaws well, and still tastes like it's only a day out of the oven. Almost cake-like, it's moist, decadent and delightfully zingy. You don't need even need a spread. Travels quite well. Cons: I found zest can create a bitter aftertaste, so I used orange EXTRACT instead. Directions on the box/bottle should tell you how much to substitute, and in my opinion, you get a better, more even taste throughout. I don't like the grittiness you sometimes get from cranberry seeds, so I cut my berries in half and rinsed away as many as I could before mixing them in. Time-consuming but totally worth it. The bread also cut a little better because there was no knife drag from whole berries. EDIT: I tried using the popular dried cranberries and it was still good, but not as delightfully zingy. Fresh cranberries are much better. Those are the only modifications I made to the recipe. It's as near perfect as any I've ever found here, and I've been using this site for years. The bottom line: This is wonderful bread. I made it for two different away-from-home Thanksgiving dinners, and everyone devoured it and asked for the recipe. After we got home, I made 2 more loaves just for us! This recipe is a KEEPER.

I think the leavening used for this recipe may be too much.  I made this loaf twice; the first time I followed the exact recipe and instructions.  The flavor was nice, however, the loaf just didn't rise according to my expectations.  The second time, I adjusted the baking powder to 1/2 teaspoon, and left the salt and soda as they were.  The loaf came out with a nice dome and was much more attractive.  I had the same results with muffins as well.

When I made this bread I thought the dough was a bit too stiff - more like biscotti than a quick bread, but I thought that perhaps the fresh cranberries would weep a bit during the cooking process and that the recipe accomodated for that.  Turns out that I was right, it would have made great biscotti!  I think I may leave out the cranberries and use it that way instead - then it will be great!  The orange flavor was really nice and the texture is very coarse - perfect for biscotti, but not great for a fruit bread.

I made this recipe into muffins. I also used walnuts & cranberry/orange juice. I had an extra ripe banana to get rid so I threw that in as well, this made the muffins very moist. 
I was able to make 18 good size muffins & cooked for 30 minutes.
This recipe was very tasty & will make again, maybe sprinkle a little sugar on top?? ;)

Good flavor, very pretty Christmas-y bread.  But I am having trouble with sinking in the middle.  I made this twice. The first time I doubled the recipe and made 6 mini loaves. However, they fell in the middle big time- they were little sad sunken things.  They tasted great though. Not sure what caused that, unless maybe I took them out too soon to see if they were done, and that caused it?? The second time I made one large loaf and 3 mini loaves.  I made sure not to pull them out too soon, and they still fell in the middle, though not as badly. What am I doing wrong??

OK.. So I followed this recipe exact, and I was not pleased with the results. I doubled the recipe and made 3 loaves that did not rise,they were tasty,But not what I expected. So after reading reviews.. I did what smbowels recommend and dropped the baking powder to 1/2 tsp. I doubled the recipe and made 2 loaves and WOW... What a difference, Exactly what I was looking for. This is a keeper for my Christmas platters !!! Thank you for the wonderful recipe !!

This is a fantastic, moist loaf of bread with lots of flavor that is easy to make.  Margarine has never crossed my front door; as far as I am concerned, it is nothing but chemicals; therefore, I used unsalted butter.

Very good! I love cranberry bread for Christmas. I will never need another cranberry bread recipe ever again! This one is the bomb! I used pistachio nuts for a more festive look. I also made my Vanilla-Almond icing glaze and colored half of the mixture red to do a red/white ribbon pattern on top and sprinkled it with green sparkling sugar. Very pretty and delicious! Plan on making this for the neighbors as a gift bread. Will make every year!

Delicious. Used 3 mini-loaf pans. Use d frozen cranberries and the zest of a whole orange - more than the called for 1 Tablespoon. Baked for 35 minutes. It was  better than the ones I get at the store.

Oh my goodness, oh my goodness, oh my goodness.  Possibly the best bread I've ever made.  My bananas weren't ripe enough and the zucchini looked awful so stepped outside of my bread comfort zone and tried this recipe.  It's now my new favorite.  I don't often see fresh cranberries where I live unless it's the week around Thanksgiving so I used dried cranberries that I buy from Trader joe's.  I boiled them in the orange juice to bring them back to life with great results.  I did use butter instead of margarine, just a personal preference thing.  Definitely take the time to zest a real orange.  The flavor is so pure.  I doubled the recipe and made two regular sized loaves, but I could have easily made three with the same amount of batter and will do so next time.  Thanks so much for the post Carol.  This one is a winner.

If you sift some of the Flour that you're using onto the Cranberries it prevents them from sinking to the bottom, so that they spread out evenly. We Love this Bread!!!

This was VERY, VERY good! Bursting with flavour! I left the cranberries whole and added about 3/4 cup more of them. It took longer to cook because of it and I had to cover the top with foil to keep from over browning, but it was fantastic! Thanks for the recipe - it is definitely one I will make again!

This was a wonderful addition to our Christmas table.  It was, in fact, the favorite food on the menu!  The entire loaf was gone within minutes.  The recipe makes a very moist bread, so it melts in your mouth--just take care when slicing it.  We pretty much mutilated it (but it still, obviously, tasted great!).  It makes a great gift, too.  I gave several loaves away to neighbors.

This is absolutely delicious!  I added 1 tsp vanilla to the wet ingredients, and 3 teaspoons of cinnamon to the dry ingredients.  I soaked a 6-ounce package of dehydrated Craisins (cranberries) in hot orange juice to plump them since I could not get fresh cranberries.  It turned out great!

This seems to be a winner with everyone that has tasted it!  I use 2T of butter and 2T of applesauce, and reduce the sugar closer to 3/4 cup just to make it a bit healthier.  I also always make this in mini-loaf pans... they're beautiful (but don't forget to grease AND flour the pans like the recipe says).  The directions don't mention it, but I'd reccommend chopping the cranberries in half at least... I do this on the cutting board, but I'm sure a food processor would be much faster (and safer!).

This recipe was good but it tasted a bit 'floury'.  I tried making it with cake flour and that tasted better.  I also added more cranberries.  It tastes good even without the nuts

This was delicious! The only thing that I did differently was that I used half a cup of frozen orange juice concentrate and then diluted it to get the recipe's requirements, as I did not have orange juice. I would encourage everyone to bake a loaf - or two!

An update 1/4/12 . I used this recipe again. This time I poured the batter into four mini-loaf pans and baked them for 30-35 minutes ( do the 'tooth-pick test' for added measure). The result was, four DELICIOUS loaves! I froze two. My husband and I enjoy this bread , immensely.It is hard not to eat more than one slice!

Amazing! I made a few modifications to try and make this healthier. I made it into 12 muffins for instant portion control, I used half whole wheat flour, decreased the salt to 1/4 tsp, decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup, added 1/8 cup honey.  I also forgot to buy cranberries so I used about a cup of craisins that I had on hand. I can't wait to make these again!

Fabulous! Works with frozen cranberries as well. Made it twice now. So yummy! One large juicy orange should have all the zest and juice you need (or two smaller oranges).

This had lovely texture, but I wish it had more orange flavour. Even with an orange juice / sugar / contreau glaze I still felt it needed more kick. Maybe even more orange zest next time? People complaining about the tartness of the cranberries - don't make a recipe with cranberries then slam it 'cause you don't like cranberries! They're tart! Raspberries would be a great sub if you prefer something sweeter. I added a splash of vanilla and a drop of almond flavouring, which I think always goes nicely with orange. **Note - if you use frozen berries adjust your baking time accordingly or warm them first - the cold berries turned my batter into a cold, hard block and I had a tricky time figuring out when it was done.**

I have no idea how I screwed this up....Normally I'm a pretty good cook, but this was awful.  I made 2 batches, and both of them failed.  I baked all of them in mini loaf pans, and every one of them collapsed in the middle right after taking them from the oven.  The batter had good flavor, but thats it.  Sorry!

This is a wonderful quick-to-make bread. I am serving it for Christmas tomorrow, and so far all of my family have commented on how great it smells! I did make a few changes.... 
1: instead of margerine I used regular butter. 
2: instead of fresh cranberries I used craisins. (sweetened dried cranberries) 
3: I didnt have a fresh orange to zest, so I used a tsp of orange extract. 
I baked it in a glass loaf pan, and it was done 10 minutes sooner than the recipe said. I think that may be why some reviewers got a dry, crumbly, hard loaf. 
I will make a glaze with OJ, vanilla and powdered sugar to drizzle over the top when serving. 
Thanks for a great, quick n easy recipe!!!!

Buy fresh cranberries when they're available and toss them in the freezer, right in the bag.  Rinse and thaw the amount needed and then you can enjoy this bread almost anytime.  Walnuts are a good addition.  This is a dense, moist bread that improves with age and is better if it is tightly wrapped and stored in the fridge for a day or so.  Or, after you zest your orange save it, cut it in half, and store it with the baked bread in an airtight container in the fridge for a few days to intensify the orange flavor.  Freezes well too.  I have been making mulitple loaves during the winter months for the past several years.  We love it.

I wanted more of an "Orange Cranberry Loaf", so I doubled the recipe, then doubled the orange zest, but kept the 1.5 cups of cranberries. I also used only 1.5 cups of sugar. It was perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

I used butter crisco instead of margarine, but that was my only change.  It looked beautiful, and it tasted great, but it was having a little trouble baking inside.  It crusted over too hard and then underneath sank in a little, so I will have to work on that next time.  It was phenominal tasting though.  Thank you for sharing

This was REALLY good! Definitely keeping it around so I can make it again.  I used frozen cranberries, which thickened the batter a little bit, but don't worry - it baked just fine. I squeezed the orange I bought for the zest and used the juice. I also cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup because I prefer things not to be TOO sweet, and I really wanted the fruit flavors to come through. I also added a little extra orange zest and cranberries.

Also, this makes awesome muffins. I put mine in paper muffin cups, left the oven at the same temperature and baked them for about 22-25 minutes.

Another tip for those of you wondering: DO NOT make this with dried cranberries!! I tried it with dried cranberries and the consistency of the batter was all weird, especially after baking. Having fresh or frozen cranberries is important.

I had three problems with this bread: 1)The middle collapsed after it had been out of the oven for 5 minutes because it was still somewhat uncooked. 2) The rest of the bread was dry and crumbly. 3) The taste wasn't that fantastic. I think the baking time was too long and there's too much batter for one loaf. That could explain why most of the cake was dry but the top middle was slightly unbaked and sank. I will say the flavor AND crumbly texture improved DRASTICALLY after the loaf had been refrigerated for a day. It was no longer crumbly and the orange flavoror really popped. So I would suggest you DON'T eat this bread right away; Refrigerate it for a day and then try it. I'm giving this four stars if you follow my directions and don't eat this until after it's refrigerated. If you try to eat it right away, then only one or two stars.

Very good bread, made 2 loaves instead of one, also added 1 teaspoon of orange extract to mix, used walnuts, and a little less sugar, baked in two 8x4 pans and they are wonderful.  Why go through all of that work for one loaf of bread that tastes so good.  Will make again, and give as gifts.

This was fantastic. I have to admit, I was a bit apprehensive about using cranberries like this but I needn't have worried. This is a great quick bread. I didn't do the icing others suggested as I ran out of time and orange juice but I am making this bread again real soon and I may try to make it. However, I really don't think it needs it. I mean, it's pretty darn good as is; how much better can it get?

I've been making this recipe for years -- I originally found it in an old Better Homes & Gardens cookbook, and that page is well worn in my copy now.  This recipe divides into three mini baking pans very nicely, and makes great holiday treat giveaways.

This is the best cranberry bread I have ever tasted. The dough is very dense, so add an extra 20 minutes to your cooking time.

Quick and easy. I have used Crasins instead of fresh cranberries, I find they are much sweeter. I plumped the crasins first, though to make them juicier. I recommend this recipe!

Great recipe! Definitely will make again.  I omitted the nuts and it still turned out well.  the only problem I encountered was when I mixed the cranberries with the dry ingredients, some of the flour stuck to the cut sides of the cranberries and remained there even after cooking....next time I will add the cranberries after the wet and dry ingredients are combined

I love to bake tea breads and of the many varieties and recipes I've tried - this is one of my favorites.  I wouldn't change a thing with the recipe.  I've made 2 double recipes and they turned out moist and delicious.  A double recipe makes 8 of the baby loaf sizes which are perfect for gift giving.  Thank you Carol.

I added some extra sugar and nuts the second time I made this, because my family thought it was too sour the first time... and you can never have too many nuts, in my opinion!  Great for breakfast, and better the next day.

Excellent!  I made this for the family at Christmas, and everyone gobbled it up.  The orange flavor is perfect, and the cranberries really add to the holiday spirit.  A definite keeper for the cold winter months!

To add to my previous post, i did use fresh cranberries. Had some in the freezer. DO NOT THAW! They chop really well when frozen.  I rinsed them in cold water and then chopped in my processor. You can use as many as you desire. If you want just a little then that is ok as well. Don't add extra orange juice if using the frozen berries. When they thaw you will get extra moisture.

This was an amazing loaf! I didnt have the nuts, but I bet it would have turned out even better with them. For the drizzle on top I used freshly squeezed grapefruit juice instead of orange. So delightful! Cut the cranberries in half BTW.

Delicious! The first time I made it, I cheated and used dried cranberries which made the bread really dry. The second time, I followed the recipe with fresh cranberries, and it turned out fantastic!

FYI: DO NOT use dried cranberries (a.k.a. 'craisins'), even if they're plumped or rehydrated - I did, and the loaf did not taste like anything to rave about.  I'm sure the loaf would have tasted much better if I had used fresh or frozen, but I only had dried on hand. Anyway, I hope to save everybody from making the same mistake I did.

Make the glaze with powdered sugar, orange juice, orange zest and GRAND MARNIER. Delicious!!!  Use 1 cup powdered sugar, 1tsp. orange zest, 1 TBS orange juice and 2TBS Grand Marnier, or enough to make it a  nice drizzling consistency.

Yummmmy!  This is such a unique and different Christmas dessert.  My first experience baking with cranberries.  I made 3 mini-loaves and 2 individual muffins.  I made a glaze of 1 c. powdered sugar, 1 tbsp. of oj, and 1 tsp. of vanilla.  I tried the muffin with and without the glaze, and prefer with the glaze.  Of course, it's also excellent without!  I also placed a few cranberries on the top before baking so the presentation would be nicer once they were finished.

Wonderful recipe!  I first made this 6 years ago as gifts for my OB/GYN and hospital nurses when I was pregnant with my twins.  I have now made the recipe again as holiday gifts for family, teachers, doctors and friends with the same fantastic results.  I too made the orange glaze to spread on top, but aside from that, I followed the recipe exactly as written.  The recipe was doubled without problem and made 12 3x5 inch mini loaves.  The loaves always take better 1-2 days after baking.  Thank you for such a tasty recipe that's been loved by all who've tried it!

Something went horribly wrong when I tried to make this recipe.  I can't give the recipe a low score because its very possible that I forgot something.  My loaf didn't rise... HOWEVER, if you enjoy chewy thick-brownie-like texture then it did turn out ok.  I liked the flavor, but it just didn't rise.

Chop, Chop, Chop is all I can say.  I made the recipe according too the directions and the whole berries were too tart for my families liking.  After 1 bite, my kids were turned off by the tartness.  This is the same recipe on the bag of cranberries, only their's says to chop the cranberries.

I suppose I'm not much of a cranberry person, but I had extra cranberries in the freezer, and we didn't have anything for breakfast. My boyfriend really likes it. I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and 3/4 cup white sugar. I also added about 3/4 teaspoon vanilla. It came out of the oven in one hour with a perfect crust. It's moist and appears to be holding together well. However, I won't make it again -- the bitterness of the cranberries is a little too much for me.

Made this to go with breakfast this Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it! I didn't use the nuts (my dad doesn't like nuts) and I substituted applesauce for all of the shortening. I thought it was delicious - will definitely make it again.

I was so glad to find this recipe, as I had one like this before.  WONDERFUL!  There is the "sweet/tart" thing going on with the cranberries and sugar...YUM! I chopped my cranberries up a bit, and mix them in just a little sugar before adding to the rest of the mixture.  I make this every year for the holidays, it's a tradition...thanks!

Really great!  I used the food processor to chop the nuts and then the cranberries.  Used butter instead of margarine and didn't put in a full cup of sugar.  Used fresh-grated orange zest.  Wonderfully flavored bread!
  Made this again using half whole wheat flour and it's just as good!

Wow!! One of the best recipes I've ever tried. I have made two double batches since I found and printed this the other day. It brought raves from those who received it as gifts, and we ate it up quickly here at home.
A couple notes: I found that when I chopped the fresh cranberries, at least in half, they distributed better throughout the batter. 
When splitting the batter into mini loaf pans for gifts, they baked much faster, so you really have to watch it closely. 
Finally, when the recipe says butter and flour, it really means it!! I usually skimp on this step and get away with it in other recipes, but not this one. You really do need to butter AND flour. 
I used walnuts instead of pecans with excellent results.

This bread was tasty.  I used a 16oz can of whole cranberries instead of fresh.  Mine needed more cooking time 1 hour and about 15-20 mins. Good in the morning with coffee. I would definitely make again.  Very simple.

So Good!!! I used frozen cranberries and it came out great. Also, I didn't use the nuts (because of an allergy) or the orange rind (didn't have any oranges). Delicious and moist!! This is a keeper!

I substituted 1/4 cup applesauce for the margarine in this recipe. It turned out great! Very moist. I also used dried cranberries instead of fresh and added the glaze on top as suggested by other reviews. Delicious!

Maybe the best Cranberry Orange bread I have ever tasted. I am discarding my previous recipes today. Used recipe as written. BTW, I had frozen cranberries, and I just dumped them in still frozen. Worked great. Will try them as muffins soon.

I would rate this 10 stars if possible. The combination of sweet and tart is great. Do not skip the orange glaze on top,it REALLY finishes it out!!!

This is delicous!  My mother-in-law used to make a Cranberry Orange Tort, which we loved.  According to my husband this was better!  And for me, much easier.  It does need the glaze, which I made with 1/2 cup orange juice, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1 Tbsp. butter, microwave until sugar melts & pour over hot bread right from the oven. This is an attractive bread and it stays fresh tasting 3 days or more. This is a keeper!!!

Followed the recipe, except used butter not margarine, and I chopped the berries a bit, and what a disappointment.  While the loaf smelled amazing baking, it did not rise and came out very dense.  The flavors are OK, but I like a moist, springy bread.  I will try a different cran-orange recipe for next time.

I doubled the recipe and made two loaves.  Very good.  Didn't last long here.  Also after zesting the oranges I juiced them to add some fresh OJ to the stuff from the fridge.  I figure why waste a good orange, right?

This smelled so yummy while it was cooking.  I did make the glaze that other reviewers suggested and poured it on top while it was still warm.  This bread is AMAZING!!  It's hard to stop eating this bread.  Thanks Carol for an awesome recipe.

It was awesome! My family loves it. It's not too tart for my tastes and the cranberries look really pretty in there. I used a mixture of pure mexican vanilla, vanilla soymilk, and powdered sugar to glaze the top.
I do have to say, mine only took 40 minutes to bake, not a whole hour. I was amazed, and used a cake tester to double-check, but it was completely finished and bounced back.
Definitely going to be making this again!

Yum - I have always liked these flavors and this is an especially good recipe for this batter bread.  I didn't realize I was out of oranges, but used dried orange rind and a little bit of orange oil and it substituted just fine.   This recipe bakes up as muffins exceptionally well and they stay moist for days.  Great recipe - thanks!

This is my favorite! I don't really like nuts in things like this so I use 2 cups of cranberries instead of 1 1/2. I make it every year, it's very easy and comes out great! Great for a beginner, people will think you're expert baker!

Very good.  Batter is thick, so you need to watch the placement of berries, so you don't have areas thick with berries and then areas with no berries.  Taste is very nice.

I just finished making this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner (tomorrow). My girlfriend's orange tree is sagging with fruit, so I used freshly squeezed OJ and left all the pulp in. While I followed the measurements exactly, my 9x5 loaf pan looked VERY full. I was especially worried since it contained both baking powder and baking soda. Sure enough, it overflowed in my oven. The good news was that I chiseled some of the bread off the side of the pan so I could taste it. It's a fantastic recipe, very flavorful! So I will definitely be making it again, perhaps using more than one pan.  :)

Great following the recipe exactly. Also, using slightly less orange juice, I shaped the dough into scones and bake for half the time. I used 1/4 cup less sugar, and 3/4 cups of the flour was King Arthur white whole wheat flour. Really good. The whole fresh cranberries and orange flavor is awesome. Not too sweet.

Very nice loaf.  I doubled the recipe and baked in 3 medium size loaf pans.  Baked for 55 minutes and they turned out perfect.  I did use 1/2 sugar & 1/2 Splenda, also 1/2 margarine and 1/2 applesauce.  1 12oz pkg of cranberries was 3 cups, so perfect for doubling the recipe.  I just had to add that my husband said this is some of the best "bread/cake" he's ever eaten.  I didn't even think he'd like it because it's a bit tart. Hip-Hip-Hooray!!

Nice texture and decent flavor.  I left out the nuts and baked in 8 mini loaf pans for about 27-29 minutes.  They have a really nice texture and the fresh cranberries tasted delicious.  Just make sure to leave the cranberries whole, otherwise they get the flour mixture stuck inside, making them look a little ugly.

Excellent loaf, I love orange and cranberry together, so wanted to give this one a try!  I opted to change the recipe a bit to reduce some fat/calories and here are the changes I made.  First I doubled the recipe since I had a whole bag of fresh cranberries which is 3 cups.  The only real changes I made (based on doubling) were to use 2 1/2 c white flour and 1 1/2 c whole wheat, 1/4 cup non hydrogenated margarine and 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1 1/2 cups sugar and one egg with 2 egg whites.  Baked as directed and the loaves came out great.  I did leave out the pecans as I didn't have any, and even though  nuts are somewhat 'healthy', they are also high in fat!  So, all in all, loved this one, thanks for sharing!

Delicious! I did find it needed extra time (even though it sprung back when I touched it). And a glaze of 1 c. powdered sugar 1 T orange juice 1 tsp vanilla and some water added a lot.

This is a very tasty loaf, especially after waiting to the second day.  The only thing I could find wrong was that it was a little dry.  Wondered if a little more fat would improve it.  Is a 1/4 of a cup really enough?  I also made the recipe again leaving out the nuts & cranberries (for a person who doesn't like those items) & it made a very nice orange flavoured loaf that is great at coffee break time.  I will try it again adding a little more butter & see if it moistens up a bit.

This is so yummy! The only thing I changed was pouring a powdered sugar, oj glaze on while the loaves were still hot. Very pretty and great flavor. The cranberries are a bit tart, so if you're not a big fresh cranberry fan I would use craisins or another dried version. I've tried it with both and it always tastes great!

Absolutely delicious! I frequent allrecipes.com for my yearly baked goods gift giving for Christmas and this is by far the best recipe I've come across. Ideal for your holiday gift giving, this not-too-sweet loaf will more than satisfy your family and friends' sweet tooths. I also appreciated the ease of the recipe - simple, no nonsense, beginning baker friendly!

I had left over dried cranberries so I used them instead of fresh cranberries. I also didn't use nuts since I have already baked so many things (for gifts) with nuts in them. I will bake these again.

Excellent - followed exactly except substituted whole wheat flour for white flour. A little more dense but very tasty! Thanks!!

I was looking for a recipe to use some fresh cranberries and this fit the bill perfectly!  A great combination of tangy and sweet.  Tastes good slightly warm by itself, or with a little butter spread on top.  We loved it!

Was very disappointed with the final result. I had high hopes for this bread. It fell apart when inverted onto a rack, half of it stuck to the pan even though it was greased. And the bread was just not moist enough. Too dry and crumbly for me.

This is so moist and delicious, and it cooked up beatifully!  I used apple sauce instead of margarine and used a little less than one cup of sugar (more than 3/4 cup, but less than 1 cup).  It also required 80 minutes total cooking time (instead of 60).  I'm gonna buy some mini loaf pans and make some of these for holiday gifts.  Unless you don't like cranberries, you won't regret trying this recipe! :-)

I didn't put pecans (or any nuts), nor the orange zest.  Even so, this is an easy, yet tasty recipe and I have made it several times.  One thing is that right after taking it out of the oven, it isn't quite ready, i.e. it doesn't pass the toothpick test.  But after cooling, it is done.

So pretty and very moist; the orange flavor pronounced.  I thought the cranberries were too sour, but my husband liked it that way.  The tart flavor mellowed out the next day.  Don't like nuts, so left those out, and I'm at an elevation of about 7000 ft, so lowered the cook time to 45 min, and it was perfect.  If it comes out dry, you're definetly doing something wrong.

I LOVE this recipe.  I've made it several times this season - for work potlucks, family dinners, etc. - and it's always a big hit.  I have to make a double batch each time so I've got a loaf for me!  I always cut my cranberries in half.  While it's a lot more work, they make a lovely "star" pattern in the loaf when it's cut.

Really tasty. Careful when using non-stick pans. May bake more quickly than you expect and get a little tough on the bottom and sides. I wrapped them in foil before they were cool to keep the bottom moist. Seemed to work well.

had extra cranberries in the freezer to use up.  I swapped lemon peel for orange, butter for margerine and walnuts for pecans because thats what I had.  I added 2 tsp cinammon and 1 tsp vanilla.  Also increased juice to 1 cup and it turned out perfectly.  I'm making another loaf right now as we ate the last one in one day.

Delicious, beautiful, bread! I added more orange zest and water in place of the juice, it turned out great; I did not add the glaze as others suggest I like the contrast of the sweet bread and the tartness of the cranberries.  I chopped the cranberries in a variation of sizes so they disperse through the bread nicely, oh and sprinkle a few whole cranberries on the top!

Lovely bread. Only change I made was substituting half the flour for wholemeal flour. To compensate, I increased the baking soda by 2 pinches and added 1/4 cup more orange juice. Also made a glaze with orange juice and sugar, added a pinch of cardamom and cinnamon. Will definitely be keeping the recipe, well done!

A perfect mix of sweet and tangy, this bread is a definite hit! I have come to crave it, especially during winter months. I used fresh cranberries, and would suggest chopping them before putting them in the batter (they taste better mingled in with the taste of the bread, rather than getting a bite full of cranberry).

When I made this recipe I didn't expect much from it, it was only because I became bored of Banana Bread. However, when I ate it, it was delicious! I didn't care much for the cranberries or nuts (I picked them out) but the actual bread was fantastic (especially the crust!).

This bread was incredible. Definitely a huge hit with my holiday crowd. I followed previous advice and roughly chopped the cranberries, more than doubled the orange zest and added a yummy icing of orange juice, powdered sugar and lemon juice to top it off. The icing perfectly balanced out the cranberry tartness. This recipe will be a keeper for many years to come.

Delicious! Mine didn't rise up as much as I expected, so it was kind of a dense loaf, but it was delicious.  My family weren't huge fans of the tart cranberries, but I thought the contrast between the cranberries and the sweet bread was divine.

These are so delicious! I coarsely chopped my cranberries and tossed them with a little flour(to keep them from sinking) before adding them. I also used mostly brown sugar, and butter instead of margerine. I made this into 12 muffins...they baked for about 20-25 minutes and looked beautiful topped with glaze!

This loaf is fantastic! I doubled the recipe and split the batter into 3 smaller loaf pans? I also rough chopped the cranberries, and omitted the nuts.

After they cooled to room temp, I made an orange glaze to pour over the top.  Orange Glaze=2cups powdered sugar, 1/4 cup orange juice, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract.

I'm not a baker, but this was fantastic & easy to make. The first time I used dried cranberries & added a small bag of chopped walnuts.  I also used the zest of an entire large orange.  It was gone in no time flat!

Used a suggestion to  increase berries but definitely needed longer cooking time. Inside was raw top amost burnt. Had to redo but went with another recipe I had. Will try this one again only decrease berries, coursley chop and fold in with nuts after batter is mixed.

I had randomly bought a package of fresh cranberries and needed to use them before they went bad. I chose this recipe because it seemed simple and I had all the ingredients on hand. I excluded the walnuts because my daughter has a nut allergy and I didn't have any on hand either. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written using fresh orange zest and it came out pretty good. My picky husband loved it. I thought it needed a little extra sugar and a little less cook time. I also found it to be somewhat dry but after wrapping it in saran wrap it became more moist.

Great recipe.  Will make it again for sure.
Edit:  Have made a few times. Always good. Sometimes I add a glaze and sometimes I don't.  It doesn't need it but if you have a sweet tooth, it's a nice addition.

Absolutely amazing!!!!!! A ten star recipe!!!!!!!  I added almonds instead because that's all I had and wow!!!! I also added only 500ml orange juice also because I had no more but to that I added 100ml oil and use dried cranberries just soaked them in warm water for 15 min and rinsed and drained ( because that's also all I had at home).   It came out very tasty and OMG we can't get  enough!!! In the past week I made it 3 times and doubled the recipe each time!   I baked it in silicone x-mas tree which is about the size of a normal dinner plate for 40 mins and also used the stars that came with the set. The stars are a little bigger (wider) than a muffin but much lower so they baked in 15 min and they last much longer as you don't cut them just serve as is.   Thanks for a great recipe!! This for sure is a keeper and will be a family hand me down!!!!!!

Really good flavor - Used Blueberry Crasins - Made it a cross between a blueberry/ orange & Cranberry/orange bread.  I made it in Mini bundt pans (made 6) and they were a little crispy but wonderful flavor!

Perfect results with this one.  I can't think of any way to improve it.  I baked these in small loaf pans and they disappeared almost immediately.

The cake turned out really good. I used dried cranberries and kept everything else the same. Orange and cranberry flavor goes well together !! I am going to make this many more times.

I don't know why I tried this, maybe to see if I could do it.  At first the tart cranberry was noticeable then the sugar, nuts, orange and dried  apricots (which I added to get rid of), kicked in and like the others, it was habit-forming.  My wife wasn't satisfied till it was gone.  Didn't have any left to refrigerate over night.  Now I have to make 6 more.  One problem I had was it didn't rise at all, maybe shrunk a little if anything.

Absolutely wonderful!  I did the orange glazed that was suggested and I think that did make another layer of flavor to the sweet tart flavor.  What a great use for cranberries!

The first time I made this recipe, it was just okay, but I gave it another shot and was so glad I did.  I have made this loaf every time we travel.  It packs up nicely and tastes better every day.  It is wonderful for a snack, desert or for my favorite...breakfast!

So yummy!! This is a great recipe to help me use up my lingonberries. Instead of nuts I used an extra 1/2 cup of berries. My berries are frozen so the batter was thicker and had to cook longer but the results were just wonderful! I'm making my second loaf of the day :)

I love this recipe, tried it with dried cranberries, not so great, just to dry. The loaf is so super great with an orange glaze as it shows. 1/2 cup icing sugar and  4tsp. freshly squeezed orange juice. I just made them into muffins and it looks great. Makes 2 dozen large muffins.

I personally loved this recipe was a good combination of sweet and sour.  I was hoping my hubby would like this better than his usual banana bread but it looks like he's still stuck on the banana.  I'll keep trying...

I left out the pecans and used extra finely chopped mandarin orange peel instead of the orange zest.  I made some mini loaves and some  muffins.  The muffins hardened quickly after a day, whereas the loaves were still fine.  I will make it again and stick to the loaf pans.

WOW this is good. I was a little skeptical cause cranberries can be very tart and the recipe doesn't really call for alot of sugar but it was just nice, not too tart and definately not too sweet. I didn't have any pecans so I used walnuts, still good. Going to make a few more of these loaves before I have guests over so I can just pull them out. YUMMY!!!

Great for breakfast! I added some vegetable oil and more orange juice because the batter was way too thick. It was perfect this way, especially after I drizzled an orange glaze on top.

I thought this bread was yummy. However, I found it to be a little dry. I made mini loaves instead of 1 large loaf. When I give them out as gifts I may add some simple syrup to them to add moisture, as well as a simple glaze over top for presentation. I would make this bread again. :)

Because we absolutely adore cranberries have made many breads over the years but this is the best - not chewy like some. Difficult to mess up and perfect for a beginner baker.   Thanks.

This was wonderful!  I subbed dried cranberries but otherwise made as directed.  Had no problem cutting, and didn't even need to put the sweet glaze on - it was excellent without.

I was thrilled to see this recipe featured on the front page of your web site the week of Christmas. I wanted to make something lighter for Christmas breakfast and this was perfect. Like others I chopped the cranberries, used butter instead of margeine, added 1 teaspoon of orange extract and then I made a glaze from powdered sugar, orange juice, and vanialla extract. This is not too tart or dry with the glaze and chopping the cranberries.

this is a delicious cranberry orange bread.  very light with just the right combination of sweet and tart.  like other reviewers, i added a simple glaze of milk and powdered sugar. my major problem with this recipes, after two attempts, is that there is simply not enough liquid called for in the recipe.  both times i've had to add addition liquid to get it into the consistency of a normal batter.  i've chosen to use milk on both occasions and will continue to do so  (more oj would be too overpowering).  i'm not sure how much i added-1/4 to 1/2 cup, probably.  just poured a little in and stirred, and continued until it was right.  recipe is definitely a keeper--with that one modification.

This was so good! I didn't have pecans, so I used walnuts and I left out the orange peel becuase, well, I didn't have any fresh oranges. It was still great! I was surprised that it didn't call for any spices, but it doesn't need it. The tartness of the cranberry's were complimented nicely by the sweetness of the bread. Not too sweet though. :) I baked mine in my pampered chef mini loaf stoneware pan that has 4 loaves in one pan. It took about 40 min and I had to cover it w/ foil the last 10 to prevent over browning. YUMMM! Hubby tood one of the loaves for breakfast...that's right, thw whole mini loaf. :)

Absolutely delicious!! I actually forgot to put that However it doesn't need it. This bread is so moist that when warm a little margarine or butter is all it needs. I think I would use less orange zest next time. I felt that between the juice and zest it was a little overpowering. Great breakfast treat during cranberry season!

Fantastic bread!  I ate almost the whole loaf myself.  Just the right amount of orange and cranberry.  I recommend chopping the cranberries, they may be too bitter if you don't

Yummy!  I did what other reviewers suggested and chopped up the cranberries before adding.  I also used butter instead of margarine.  The only complaint I have is that it didn't hold up well when slicing. But that won't stop me from making it again!

This was a fantastic tasting cranberry bread.  Made it at Thanksgiving, and we devoured it quickly.  Mine took longer to bake as well - just don't take it out until the toothpick test comes clean.  Since every oven varies, it's hard to say how long you should bake yours.  I love the taste with fresh cranberries, yet the bread was not too tart.  Some of my family likes their slice with a dab of butter or cream cheese - YUMMMMMY!!!!!

I made this recipe to give as gifts in a baking basket.  Needed to bake this loaf 15 minutes longer then stated and was still worried that it might be lumpy in the middle.  Next time, I'd use smaller loaf pans and bake 35 minutes.

Very good bread. I used walnuts instead of pecans and lemon zest instead of orange zest simply because that is what I had on hand. I cut about a third of the cranberries in half just to experiment, but the whole ones didn't seem to turn out too tart anyway. We enjoyed the bread more the next day after storing it in the refrigerator. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

I love this bread! It is moist and has a great mix of the sweet orange and the tangy cranberry flavors. I made so many loaves during the holidays last year that I lost count. (I am just now getting around to rating the recipes in my recipe box!) It is very festive looking - great for gifts and holiday platters, or just with a good cup of coffee on a winter morning. Will make it for years to come I'm sure.

This is WONDERFUL!!  My foil loaf pan (for a gift) was a little small so made 4 muffins with the leftover batter (baked muffins for 20 mins).  I couldn't get more than 1/2 tsp of zest from my orange (the only one I had was a satsuma) but it's still great.  Not too tart, not too sweet, the pecans add a nice texture.  I will be adding this to the 'keepers' list.

This was very good and the flavors were wonderful but I thought it was a bit dry. Next time I am going to plump some craisins like a previous reviewer and I may add a little more OJ and some applesauce to the recipe.

This recipe was great. I overcooked mine slightly at 60 mins; I should have checked it sooner as the recipe stated, but it was still very good and I can't wait to try it again.

Easy to prepare.  Absolutely delicious.  I made it for a breakfast at work.  Received lots of compliments on what a delicious flavor it had.  I substituted 1-1/2 cups of craisins for the fresh cranberries.  Turned out wonderful!

This was a hit for our Christmas eve party.  I cut the cranberries down to 3/4 cup and coated them in 1 tbs of sugar as suggested.  I also added some almond extract for a little flavor and sprinkled in a touch a cinnamon.  Dropped the batter in muffin cups and baked for ~20 minutes.  The muffin tops came out a little crispy, but after letting them sit overnight, they had the requisite moist "muffiny" texture.  The orange, cranberry and pecan flavors blended really well.  The muffins were all gone by Christmas morning!

Good bread! Recommend purchasing a zester-thing BEFORE buying...you will buy one afterwards anyways. :) Pecans add a nice extra flavor and "crunch" or texture to the bread. Only people that didn't like it were people who don't like fruit in their bread. Delicious recipe--thank you!

Loved this!  Great recipe to combine with the Brandied Cranberry Sauce as it also uses orange zest and the recommendation was to cut down on the zest. I added some of the zest from that to this and it was wonderful!

I just made this recipe as a "dry run" in preparation for Christmas.  I like another user cut the cranberries in half and coated them with a small amount of white sugar before adding to flour mixture.  My oven only took about 45 minutes and it was done.  The only problem is mine caved in slightly in the middle.  Probably a user error!! The taste was fantastic.  It was so moist and the hint of orange and the tartness of the cranberries is wonderful!  Can't wait to enjoy with a cup of coffee in the morning.  I added a full cup of chopped walnuts and every morsel is chocked full of flavor!! Definitely a keeper. Plan to make several loaves for Christmas gifts!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Very nice Christmas bread! I made it in four small, disposable bread pans to give as gifts. I did cut my frozen cranberries in half and I added an orange glaze ( 1 cup confectionery sugar, 2 tablespoons orange juice and a teaspoon vanilla) while bread was stick slightly warm.  Those were my only changes. This recipe really doesn't need any tweaking! Thanks Carol for sharing this lovely recipe!

I made this for a ladies meeting and I have never had so many compliments on anything as much as I received on this.  I baked it for 55 minutes and it was perfect. This was a huge hit!  They could not stop raving about it.  It was moist, a little tart, but just enough, not to much and it was such a delightful bread for this time of year. I had to pass the recipe out to two ladies before I Ieft!   The only changes I made were: I added 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract to the sugar and egg mixture and I used walnuts instead of pecans.  I also made a glaze with confectionary sugar, orange juice and vanilla extract and poked tiny holes with a toothpick as soon as I took it out of the oven and drizzled the glaze over the bread while it was hot.  I will definitely be making this again.

It does take forever to quarter 1.5 cups of fresh cranberries!  It really smells good, though.  If it still seems like a good idea I will process them to chop next time.  I don't think the guys are up to whole cranberries.  I don't have any confectioners sugar, so no glaze this time.  This is a preliminary rating,  we shall see after it cooks and cools!  I thought the batter looked just like I expect a quick bread batter to look!  Then the loaf did not rise in the middle.  Crumb from the bottom of the pan tasted good, though.  Next time I shall reduce the baking powder and make mini loaves.

This bread is wonderful!!  I chopped the cranberries and pecans into small pieces in the food processor. I added a bit more zest and squeezed tangerines for the orange juice. I made 4 small gift sized loaves and baked for 30 mins. This receipes makes wonderful cranberry orange bread.

I just made this recipe.  I didn't have margarine so I used real butter.  It is wonderful!  
I bought a loaf of the orange cranberry bread at a farmers market last week, I loved the flavors together.  
Thanks for a great recipe.  I think walnuts would also be great in this bread.

This is a great-tasting quickbread! I doubled the recipe, added almonds instead of pecans because it's what I had on hand, and followed another's suggestion of chopping the cranberries. I used one loaf pan and one pan with 6 mini loaves...those finished first, in about 1/2 hour, and the larger loaf was done in about 40 minutes. I also did what some did and drizzled orange juice/powdered sugar/vanilla on top....delicious!!

Excellent blend of sweet and tart! I had some warm because I could not wait! As I was getting ready to start making this, I realized that I had no softened margarine (my choice would have been butter). So I replaced the margarine with unsweetened applesauce and it worked fine. I reduced the sugar a bit (as I do with most recipes). I followed a reviewer's suggestion of pouring a glaze of orange juice, confect sugar and vanilla over the bread when it came out of the oven (so cutting back on the sugar in the bread was especially good since I added the glaze). It absorbed well and left a nice sheen on the bread. I chose not to add nuts this time; still great without but will add another time. Also, I don't like over-cooked breads at all; since all ovens run different, I took it out at 40 min, and it was done to my liking. Thanks for this recipe, Carol!

Delicious!! Although I used real butter, and coarsely chopped the cranberries in the food processor. I also used half sugar in the raw and half white sugar. Delicious with coffee or tea and not too sweet. I had only walnuts on hand so they were chopped as well and was quite good. Would like to try the pecans next time !

Great recipe. Followed to a T and the bread was dry and almost burnt at 50 mins. Tastes good except for the "crusts". I would decrease the cook time to 40 or 45 mins. Good enough to try making again.

Tasty! I just made this (and finished eating my second warm slice). I am making these as holiday gifts so this was my test batch with 8.5 x 4 x 2 foil loaf pans (purchased at Xmas Tree Shops) - the recipe made 2 loaves. I used melted butter, rough chopped/halved the fresh cranberries, and added a splash of vanilla with the butter/sugar/egg mixture. Baked for 40 minutes.  I also glazed it with the orange juice, powdered sugar, vanilla combo that others have suggested.Superb flavor, moist bread.
ETA: I just made a triple batch (6 gift loaves) and it came out just as good as the first time. But since I was making a large batch I took a cue from another review and pulsed the cranberries in the food processor to roughly chop them, then after zesting the oranges I removed the white pith and blended the oranges into pulpy juice using the food processor. 2 oranges per original batch (8 for my triple) made the perfect amount of OJ for the recipe and I didn't have to fuss with juicing them by hand!

I cut the cranberries in half and they got even more chopped up when I used the mixer.  I know I wouldn't have liked the strong bitter bite if I'd left the cranberries whole.  Made the glaze to put over the warm bread and left it in the pan.  Confectioner's sugar, orange juice and zest and a drop of vanilla...yummy orange flavor that balanced out the bite of the cranberries.  I will make this one again and again.

Made this yesterday, followed the recipe as written , and it was delicious ! I drizzled icing made with confectioners sugar and orange juice ,as suggested by others , over the loaf as it cooled . The tartness of the cranberries  plus the sweetness of the icing on this moist loaf , make this  a keeper.

Soooo, soooo good!
I'm not a baker by any means, but this came out moist, tender and melt-in-your-mouth flavorful.
The only problem for me was that I'd recently had a piece of this bread from a neighbor and longed for more of the sweet, whole, juicy cranberries than she put in.
So, inspired, I decided to have a go at making my own loaf.
Except that after reading a review of someone who had included a WHOLE bag of fresh cranberries, I decided this was something I'd like, too.
HUGE MISTAKE.  The bread, although light, fluffy and so pretty, came out waaaaay too sour/tart with all those cranberries! I was actually puckering while eating a piece. :)  Being a novice baker, I didn't realize I should probably add some more sugar to offset the tartness. :/

So if you like cranberries, I'd suggest chopping up half, leaving the other half whole and adding MAYBE another 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup ONLY.
No more unless you use extra sugar! No matter how tempting it is with only a few berries left in the bag!

The tartness mellowed out some and the loaf is great toasted with butter. But next time, I'll go easy on the cranberries! 

Other than my goof, it was a really, really yummy bread.
Definitely will make again!  :)

Tried it, loved it and will use it from here on! As with almost all my sweet bread recipes, I substitued apple sauce when a recipe call for margerine, butter or oil.  I doesn't not change the taste, only reduces that fats.  Also I tend to cut back on the amount of sugar too.

I baked this one along w/ others every Holiday season and give mini loafs away with bows on them.... for mini or large muffins only bake 45 min. My neighbors and co-workers love this recipe. The suggestion of making an orange glaze is a great idea!! I also chop my cranberries up so that they aren't as tart when you bite into them. Great Bread

I thought this was delicious.  I used cranberries out of my freezer, but did thaw first (thanks to another reviewer's comments) and this worked well.  Also did a little bit of the orange juice/powdered sugar glaze (thank you to another reviewer).  
3 stars only because the rest of my family didn't like them.

Great recipe!!!! I didn't put a glaze over the loaf because I didn't want something too sweet and it was amazing! Loved the tart cranberries! The only thing I changed from the original was that I didn't put in the nuts, still great recipe though.

this was very good! I made them into muffins, so  I sprinkled sugar on the tops before baking them for 20 min or so... Great way to use up fresh cranberries that were left over from Christmas dinner. Only changes were used self rising flour and none of the rising agents, and used lemon flavored veggie oil in place of the butter and orange zest. Also, had some mushy mixed fruit cocktail I put in the blender with water to substitute for the orange juice because I didn't have any on hand.  Excellent breakfast muffins!!!!! Thanks for posting this recipe!

This was very flavorful and easy to make. I substituted yogurt for the butter and omitted the nuts. I do agree with some posts that the bread is dense and a bit touch.

I made this vegan by just substituting flaxseed for the egg (1 Tbsp ground flaxseed + 3 Tbsp. water, whipped together until thick and viscous) and using Earth Balance buttery spread for the margarine. When I juiced my large orange, I only got 1/2 cup juice out of it so I just added 1/4 cup water. And I added 1 tsp. vanilla extract because the other recipe I had read called for it and I love vanilla. At 1 hour, a toothpick inserted in the center still came out with a bit of batter on it, so I baked it for 5 more minutes and it was perfect. It turned out delicious!!

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit!  I omitted the pecans (don't like nuts in my bread) and used unsalted butter instead of margarine.  Was going to make the glaze some reviews suggested, but was too tired, and thought it tasted pretty fantastic without it - just less sweet.  Can't wait to make this again!

I totally changed this.  Not because it didn't look appealing, but I went with what I had.  It turned out great!!! I added blueberries and raspberries to it, and used whole grain flour and raw sugar.  Two eggs, salt, no baking power or baking soda, and skipped on the oj.  I added 1/2 tsp each maple and vanilla extract and subbed walnuts.  SO awesome:)  

I just wanted to share incase anyone was interested!  Happy cooking!

Yum! Used lemon zest instead of orange (that's what I had on hand) and used the juice from the lemon plus orange juice to make up the 3/4 cup. Also made a glaze of icing sugar, OJ and vanilla as others have suggested and poured it on while it was still warm. Made a it a second time with blueberries instead of cranberries, also very good.

Yummy! I followed the recipe exactly, besides cutting the cranberries in half. Using 2 fresh oranges for the zest & juice really brought out the orange flavor. Also, I followed the advice of another reviewer & made a confectioners sugar/vanilla/orange juice glaze for the top for a perfect finishing touch.

Great recipe. I have made this several times now and always get rave reviews. I have made it with walnuts when I had no pecans and served it both with a glaze or without. This is a keeper for sure.

Fantastic recipe!! I made this along with other Christmas treats for family dessert and this was a hit. I did 1/2 of brown sugar and 1/2 of white, just to sweeten the deal with the cranberries! Very impressive! I will make again and again...

This is a wonderful recipe. Very yummy and not to sweet. I just finish making 40+ 5 1/2 x 3 pan. At the end I changed it around a little. I put the butter and sugar in a mixer and left it going while I measured the dry items. Than I add the egg to sugar and butter mixture let it mix for a minute or two. Than I added all my dry item to the mixer a little at a time.. When the mixer sound like it going to break I added the OJ. Than I hand folded the cranberry and orange rine. This made it come out a lot smoother than the other way. I did not add any glaze.. Doing 40 + was enough..

Fantastic holiday bread.  I used about a Tbs and a 1/2   of orange zest  for the bread plus a tsp of orange extract  and because I didn't have any clear vanilla extract for the glaze, I used almond extract.  It was perfect!

I originally gave this recipe 3 stars, based on how it tasted soon after it cooled, but I have to bump it to 4 stars now that I have tasted it the next day!  

For my second time around, I will follow the advice of those who suggest cutting the cranberries (it's just too big a punch) and I will add the glaze as it does seem like it could use that added dimension.  With refining, I think it'll be a 5, but it's a 4 as written.

Wow!  So delicious!  Followed the other reviews and made a glaze with OJ, vanilla and powdered sugar.  But you only need to start with VERY little OJ or you will end up with more glaze than you know what to do with!

This was a huge hit over the holidays with my family and friends. Great flavor! Makes a really big loaf, though, which doesn't cook through unless I added extra time when cooking.

This is a fantastic and easy bread! I have made it several times recently for myself and for others. It always disappears quickly. I did add more orange rind (rind of 2 oranges) and was more generous with the cranberries (close to 2 cups) and even added a quarter tsp of orange extract. Also added extra pecans on the top. Every addition made it even better. Will continue to make and play with the recipe!

This is a fantastic breakfast or brunch bread! The best part is the crust, which almost tastes like it's had sugar sprinkled over it. I made one batch as muffins, baking for 25-30 minutes, for extra crusty-goodness. Also, frozen cranberries don't need to be thawed before adding to the batter.

This is very good, way better than Panera Bread's version of this bread.  Wrap it and let it set overnight for the best flavor and texture.  It gets moister and the orange flavor really comes out.  I used dried cranberries (couldn't find anything else).  I poured hot water over them and let them set for 10 minutes or so and then drained them.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing Carol!

Outstanding!  It was wonderful, and for a change, a desert that is not overly sweet, yet packed with flavor!  Now I wish I had bought more cranberries and froze them over the holidays, just for this gem.  My husband was very impressed!  Wouldn't change a thing.

I decided to make this out of the blue to use up some fresh cranberries that I had left over. Makes a very flavorful bread- I love the tartness of fresh cranberries. I used Splenda instead of sugar but followed everything else as stated.  Would recommend.

I don't know...  Are we making the same recipe?.. Did exactly as stated, except for omitting pecans; the result - the driest loaf I have ever made.  I was so excited about this recipe for the holidays, based on most reviews, so I made two!  No one liked it.  Will try to glaze the second one to improve it a little.   Won't make again.

Love this bread!!! Things I did differently: whole wheat flour, walnuts in place of pecans, double zest, used two 8x4 loaf pans. Oh, and of course added in about 1/2 bag of white chocolate chips. I also used crisco butter instead of margerine. As soon as they came out of the oven I glazed with a mixture of OJ, zest, vanilla, and powdered sugar. This is an amazing loaf, one I will definitely keep in the memory bank! Thanks!!!

Easy to make and smells fabulous when cooking.  Tasted better day 2.  Cut slices in half, put on a Christmas serving tray, and took to the salon to share with regular customers and everyone loved it.  This one is a keeper.

I noted comments of many who did not like sour cranberry taste and yet, I wanted to make this but didn't have zest or cranberries on hand.  Then I remembered I had cranberry relish from Thanksgiving that has zest, orange juice, apples and cranberries.  So after I had my batter mixed up, I ladled about a cup of my relish onto top of the batter and gently folded it into the dough, careful not to change the color of the dough to purple, and then baked in mini loaf pans for 52 minutes.  The end product was wonderful.

This is excellent.. | cut the sugar however by 1/2 cup and added dried cranberries as well as fresh cranberries.. Also added an extra egg.  Hubby loved it so much I had to make another one today so he can bring it in to share with some of his buddies....

Although the recipe was very good, I guess I just prefer to make Cranberry Orange muffins instead.

I really liked the idea of this bread. So my husband and myself made it. It was good until we got a bit of the cranberry. It was very sour. I dont know if we we did something wrong or what...

I'm not a baker, but trying to learn.  I made 7 little mini loafs , found it to be very tart. Would be good in the morning with cream cheese spread.

I fear I will be craving this bread for weeks after we finish it, which won't take long! I followed another reviewer's suggestion of doubling the recipe and using 3 8x4 pans, baking for 50 minutes. That was perfect. I also added 1 t vanilla and 1T cinnamon, and used half whole wheat flour, half white. Really wonderful--thanks for the recipe!

A few too many cranberries for my taste. I would reduce them to 1 Cup next time. The loaf in itself was really good...nice and sweet to offset the tart berries. I made this recipe as is, with no changes.

This is a wonderful quick option for a home-made dessert. I served it last Sunday to my guests after a porkloin with raspberry-chipotle sauce and salad and they all loved. I will agree is better the next day so if planning on serving, make it the night before and let sit....Great, easy-to-follow recipe!

With ever so slight alterations this has become a November/December regular at our B&B's breakfast buffet. I bake in a ring mold to avoid mushy center and use butter instead of margarine. It's a crowd pleaser.

Good basic cranberry muffin.  i do really like the pecans in there, too---adds a whole new flavor dimension.  Toast them first, of course.  Yummy!

Doubled the recipe to use 1 package of fresh cranberries.  Baked the mixture in 3 of the disposable aluminum pans.  Put pecans in one loaf and did the other two without.  Per previous suggestions, I made a glaze for the top with orange juice, powdered sugar and vanilla.  Very moist and delicious.  One of my friends asked if I baked them because the looked store bought.

A big hit during Christmas dinner, my family loved it.  Perfect balance of sweet and tart, this is a wonderfully aromatic bread.  I made it once with a glaze and the second time without.  The glaze definitely makes it sweeter.  Love it.

This loaf was not so good. I followed it to a T(almost)-- I did take reviewers suggestions and doubled it and put it into 3 loaf pans. It came out with way too much orange flavor and very dry. To me it isnt worth another try. Sorry

Perfect!  Only word of advice is to make sure it is completely cooked through before pulling it out.  Next time I will do 325 degrees and leave it in longer.

This is delicious! I added in a bit more cranberries and orange zest than asked for. I also used whole wheat flour, it added extra texture, which is what I wanted! Oh, I used a mixture of agave nectar and truvia sweetener instead of sugar. This recipe will become a holiday staple in my home!

I doubled recipe and made 5 mini loaves in the 3.5"x5" tins. It turned out pretty well, and you will most likely need the same baking time as you would a normal sized loaf; my oven runs a little hot and I required less time. I did what other reviewers recommended and created a glaze of orange juice, powdered sugar and vanilla. I added a drop of orange oil as well.

Super simple to make. I didn't get to taste this one (made it as a gift), but it had rave reviews. I did add a handful of chopped dates, and left out the nuts for this recipe. Can't wait to make it again!

I didn't have any cranberries but it tasted delicious with the pecans and orange zest and juice anyway. Next time hopefully I'll be able to find cranberries and I will try the glaze as well. Thanks

Very delicious and will definitely make again.  I used 1 cup wheat flour and 1 cup all-purpose flour.  I also didn't have orange zest and used lemon peel as a replacement.  Next time I may reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup.  It wasn't too sweet with the full cup but would like to reduce the sugare some, if possible.  I made this for my Bunco group and they all loved it.  I topped with a orange glaze after turning it out of the pan while still hot.

Delicious and easy!  I followed others advice and added the glaze.  The tartness of the cranberries is a  wonderful contrast to the sweetness of the other ingredients.  This is my new favorite holiday baked gift to give!

Yum, yum!!  Could have done with a few more cranberries, but I think that's just my personal taste.  Thought this wouldn't turn out as the batter was soo thick (think cookie dough thick) but I managed to get it all into the pan and it took 1hr20mins to bake.  Smells heaven while baking and cooling.  Make sure you let it cool completely before cutting to make it easier.  Didn't bother with the glaze as it's sooo yummy on it's own.

This was so easy to whip together.  I doubled the recipe and it was the perfect amount to use up one bag of cranberries.  This loaf is sturdy and doesn't fall apart when you cut it which I like.  I love the addition of peans and I added an orange glaze to the top.  Great quick bread that would be great for gift giving.

Awesome!  All four of my family LOVE this recipe!  I only had half the cranberries the recipe calls for so I added more pecans and it was yummy!  We also put the orange glaze on it.

These are awesome!!! I followed the recipe although I might have put in more orange zest; I didn't measure, just used the peel and pith of 2 small south african oranges. and baked them into muffins and they only took about 30 minutes to bake. i also sprinkled some sugar on the top of a few and they taste wonderful!

Delicious! Will definitely make again. I added 1/2 t of vanilla extract, but it didn't really make much difference to the recipe, so I don't think I'll add it next time. It was a very tart bread, so I'm thinking I will add the drizzled icing topping the next time I make this. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good and very easy.  I doubled the recipe and made two loaves and 12 muffins.  The loaves took about 1 hou and 20 minutes, the muffins about 40 minutes.  Turned out sweet with a bit of tartness from the cranberries.  I don't taste the oj much, but it definitely complements the flavor of the cranberries.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great.  I left out the nuts and added streusel topping the second time.  This loaf stays moist for many days and seems to get better the longer it sits.

Big Hit at Christmas time!!!  I used fresh cranberries and cut them in halves.  Don't worry about them being hard, they soften as the loaf cooks.  :)

This is an excellent recipe to use up some leftover cranberries.  It makes a nice, large loaf and is very easy to make, even with/for kids.  Since fresh cranberries are very tart, I did add an orange glaze over the top, which made it.  Definitely 5 stars with the glaze included.

Edited to add: I've made this with 100% whole wheat flour. Not great the first day (could taste the flour), but let it sit a few days and you can't even tell the difference! This is one of my holiday go-to recipes.

Fun, fairly simple recipe - I thought that the orange zest added a lot of flavor to the bread. The final product was a little drier than I expected. I also added a icing glaze over top which was a great way to finish the loaf. Next time I will use mini loaf pans.

This is a delightful bread.  However, I did have a small crater in the middle of my loaf after 1 hr of baking, so I left it in for another 15 mns.  I drizzled an orange glaze across the top made of 3 T. butter, 3 drops of orange extract, added powdered sugar and milk to the right consistency.. what a lovely bread!! Great with morning coffee.

My family loved this recipe but if using fresh cranberries abit more sugar maybe what want to add to the mix. It is abit tart and a quarter cup more of sugar takes away the tartness.

I followed the recipe exactly as it was suggested, and I don't care for it too much. There really is way too many cranberry's, and therefore came out a bit tarty.;

I love this recipe.  Quick and easy.  I used half whole wheat and half white flour.  As well, I use butter instead of margarine.  It went so quickly, I had to make it again to enjoy a piece for myself.

Superb...everyone loved it for Thanksgiving.
Hint:  Cut cranberries in half & baked for 30 mins then tested it every 10 mins (took another 30 mins to complete)  Also had to add foil over the top to keep it from turning too brown.
Added glaze over it...orange juice, vanilla & confec sugar then once cooled, wrapped in seran wrap to lock in moisture.

This recipe is amazing. Everything is perfect except I omitted the pecans because I prefer a softer loaf without the crunchy bits. Presentation is great and taste is fantastic.
I recommend greasing the pan with butter or shortening rather than pan spray. Don't forget to flour the pan too!

This was so flavorful and yummy!  I substitued the sugar with Splenda and took the suggestions of others and made a glaze with oj, vanilla and powdered sugar.  I always have cranberries in the freezer, so this is probably going to get made A LOT!

Great recipe.  I had no oranges so I made it lemon flavored instead, and it came out delicious.  Nice and crunchy on the outside with a soft and moist inner.  Yum yum.  Used frozen whole cranberries and it was not too tart.

I love this bread.  Cranberries and orange are two of my favorite combinations.  Made it once using Splenda for a group of elderly people with diabetes and once just as the recipe said.  I used the cranberries whole and haven't found it to be too bitter. I followed some of the other suggestions by putting a glaze on the top.  Decided it is not necessary, not sure it adds much for me. This is definately one of my favorite recipes.

This bread is EXCELLENT.  Good texture and lovely tast combination.  I don't have a zester, so I used my vegetable peeler to peel off the zest then chopped it.  I also juiced the oranges, and made up the difference with regular orange juice.  The recipe DOES say to chop the cranberries, which I did.  I can't imagine not doing that. This would be good with a glaze, although it certainly doesn't need it.  I will definitely make this bread many more times!

Simply amazing. I have a mini-loaf pan (which makes each portion about 1-1/2 the size of a muffin), and it makes the perfect breakfast treat! These freeze really well, too. After I make them, I pop each mini-loaf into a single freezer bag. On busy mornings, I'll pull one out and throw it into my briefcase. By the time I get to work, it's thawed and ready to eat! (Even better when microwaved 'til warm and buttered!)

This is a great recipe for cranberry orange bread. I didn't have any fresh orange peel on hand so I used candied orange peel. Another time I made it I used candied orange peel and candied ginger and substituted macadamia nuts for the pecans, it was wonderful. Lots of things you can do to this recipe if you get creative! Love it as is and with some add ins. Perfect holiday dessert!

Mmmm, so sweet and tangy! I added some cloves to the batter as well, and it really complimented the taste.

Delicious bread! I put the cranberries and nuts in the food processor, then followed the recipe exactly. I'll add an orange glaze next time just for variety. I made the loaf last night and it was even better this AM.

Great holiday bread... I also made it when guests come over.  I use dried cranberries instead of fresh... they worked fine but because of the creases in the berries there was a tiny amount of flour that didn't get mixed... so MIX WELL if you used dried cranberries.

Wow! So much flavor! I used the zest and juice of one orange, but used Tropicana orange juice to bring it up to the 3/4 cup. I also chopped the cranberries and pecans in my food processor. I think chopping the cranberries was great because you could see dots of red throughout the bread. It turned out delicious! I will definately be making this again.

This is very good.  I very much like the tartness of cranberries and this is very tart.  I recommend that you go with the other reviewers' suggestions and chop up the cranberries.

Although this bread tastes pretty good, it came out a little too moist and the cranberries were indeed overwhelming. I'm a big cranberry fan so I don't mind but I'm definitely using chopped cranberries in the future. It also came out really sticky. I  used shortening instead of margarine so that might have contributed to that.

Everything about this recipe was perfect; it was moist, had the right amount of sweetness and flavor, etc. The only thing that I will do for next time is to chop the cranberries into small pieces. The bitterness was a little overpowering with whole berries.

I thought it was a great recipe, and so did my mother in law, but I think it was a bit tangy for everyone else, I would either use dried cranberries or use a little less.

Tastes excellent!  I used just a tiny bit more sugar than called for in the recipe and it turned out delicious, especially after it's aged about a day.  Wonderful recipe; perfect for gift-giving.

Awesome tasting bread (and that's even after I replaced the butter with applesauce). Reccomendation: use half orange-flavored Craisens (cause finding fresh cranberries isn't always easy) and half fresh blueberries, it's delish!

The contrast between the sweeteness of the orange juice and zest and the tartness of the cranberries is very pleasant. This cake is moist and is sure to please as an indulgent treat or a holiday gift.

This recipe was not dry at all, very moist.  I am lazy so I put the cranberries in the food processor and let it chop them. I used an extra 1/2 cup to make up for the 1/2 cup of nuts I left out. I never use nuts in bread because it makes the bread have a flavor that seems to be what tree bark would taste like. My other lazy shortcut was not whisking the dry ingredients-just stirred them up. I only baked it for 50 minutes, and let it sit.  My stupid oven likes to get it too done on top, so I have to put it on a lower rack.  Very good nut-less bread!

Mmmm! I cooked this more for my Dad than myself, but I realized I loved this recipe too! The sweetness of the bread is countered well by the cranberries. In the winter season when it's especially hard to find good fresh berries, cranberries are plentiful and _cheap_, making this a fantastic bread by its price as well as its taste.

I made this according to recipe.  I did make the orange juice, vanilla and powdered sugar glaze.  It was fabulous!  Will definitely make again.  Very moist and delicious. Simple to make.

Awesome bread! I love the deep orange flavor and the tartness of the cranberries. I will be making this again. I even gave it as a gift at Christmas!

We doubled the recipe and made 3 loaves, which worked out perfectly.  Lovely consistency, nice and sweet with a great appearance.  5 stars, would bake again.

I was looking for something to give as Christmas gifts. This recipe made four small mini loaves. I made the recipe as is with the addition of the glaze after it came out of the oven. I kept one loaf for my husband and me so I could make sure it tasted ok. It was fabulous! Now I have to make more for us! I baked the mini loaves at 350 for 45 minutes  - they came out moist and beautiful!

Delicious!  I've made other cranberry orange breads before but this is the winner.  A drizzle of icing made with orange juice and powdered sugar makes it gift worthy.

This is a delicious recipe. I tripled for three loaves, plus a Bundt cake. I’ve made it multiple times and prefer it with half brown sugar/half granulated sugar. It’s more moist that way.

Made the recipe as directed (2 batches).  Cooked one in a spring-form pan and it took 1 hr to cook.  Looks lovely.  Cooked the other batch in a Pyrex loaf pan and it took 1 hr 15+ minutes.  Poured the juice, icing sugar on top when it came out of the oven and it made a lovely shine to the top.  Delicious and cut nicely for plating.

Amazing! Would definitely make it again! Wasn’t dry or too tart. I added a powdered sugar orange juice drizzle on top which added an extra burst of flavor. One of my new personal favorites!

Lovely sweet bread. Has a nice aroma and tangy flavor.  I thought this was easy to prepare. Not a fan of pecans so I substituted slivered almonds. Otherwise made it exactly as the recipe instructed. I would like to know the proportions of the glaze another reviewer mentioned so I could add it.

I had to take a star off because I made changes to the initial recipe. I took the baking powder down a notch- adding 1/2 tsp instead of 1 1/2. I also chopped the cranberries with my mini food processor until they were cut into quarters. I dusted them with sugar after this to cut the tartness by a bit before adding them to the batter. I did not use nuts. I have never eaten a cranberry loaf with nuts and do not think it would taste good. I used 3/4 cup sugar instead of 1 cup. 1 1/2 cup orange juice and double the zest  Just tiny changes. I think it would have been good using the recipe exactly but perhaps dropped in the middle while cooking due to too much baking powder. I advise people making this to use less baking powder to get a good result. The loaf was delicious and tangy and I would definitely make it again!! I could imagine it would be good with lemon instead of orange as well. Might try lemon next time. I did not use the glaze at all, I don't think it needs it. If I was looking for a more dessert style bread I would use the glaze.

Well, this bread was delicious, but I'm only giving 3 stars bc it was sunken in in the middle, and it was in no shape to be given as gifts 
, which is what I intended to do with it. I will try again, hopefully it'll look better. The only thing I did differently than the recipe is not include pecans

This was the BEST cranberry bread I have ever made.
The only thing I changed was I added more pecans  and more orange zest.  Gave mini loaves to the neighbors for Christmas .
All 6 wanted the recipe !!
Thank you!!!

This was just delicious, My oldest daughter told me about this recipe, so decided to try it, I read reviews carefully, I chose to cut the cranberries in half, and sprinkled   about 2 teas. Sugar over them, mixed well and set aside while I did rest of recipe. As per reviews, used 1 cup orange juice, and added 1 tea. Vanilla extract and pecans. Sifted all dry ingredients. Baked about 1 hr. Exactly.  I also did glaze while warm then let set. Wrapped in wax paper and sealed in bag, Had next morning with coffee, sent some to work  with my youngest daughter,  She loved it.  Definately a keeper and will make again.

I have to admit that I twirked this recipe somewhat and made it my own! I added white chocolate chips and used the entire bag of cranberries. I also used 2 eggs and chopped real fine nuts. The end result=a moist and delicious sweet bread!

We had leftover fresh cranberry relish from thanksgiving, my Grandma's recipe (2 bags fresh cranberries, one orange peeled, 1 C sugar-run the ingredients through a food processor) about 1 1/3 C and I used that in place of the whole cranberries.

Thank you??

Very moist.  You can really taste the orange, which makes a great contrast to the cranberry.  I made a glaze of powdered sugar, butter , vanilla and orange juice and  applied it over the top while it was still hot.  My picky husband even liked it...lol

I make this as muffins about once a month. I use dried cranberries. Only difference is that I toast the pecans and add a bit of cinnamon.
Bake at 350, turn after 10 minutes, then bake until done, normally about 18-20 minutes total.
These are a hit even without a glaze.

Yum and yum!!  We really liked this bread.   The bread wasn't overly sweet .  It had a nice tartness from the cranberries and the orange was the perfect complement to the cranberries.  I will say the first day the bread seemed almost too tart.  The second day the bread was fabulous.  The tartness mellowed out and all the flavors combined for a perfect bread.  I did top with a simple glaze made of powdered sugar and orange juice.

I added a half cup of apple sauce, used half whole wheat flour. Love the taste of the cake. It was quite dry when I first cut it but after a day it had softened up. Glad I added the apple sauce. I also used butter instead of margarine and omitted the nuts.

This turned out really well. I made three small loafs out of a single recipe, and used butter and flour to prepare the pans. The butter/flour produced a nice crust I haven't had when using shortening or a spray with the flour. The loaf wasn't dry, but it was sturdy and had a good bread texture. My only wish would be for a stronger orange flavor. I will sneak in some orange extract next time just for kicks.  Because I was doing mini loafs I also put the cranberries (only 1 cup) in the food processor just enough to break them up a bit. Sometimes smaller pieces work better for small loafs. Great recipe.

Delicious flavor!  I rough chopped the cranberries and used real butter, and made a glaze with OJ, powdered sugar, and a splash of orange extract.  Next time (and there will definitely be a next time) I will add another egg and a touch more butter since it was a little dry to me.  I baked in 3 mini loaf pans and they were done in just under 40 minutes.  Thanks for sharing!  This will be added to my list of Christmas gift breads every year.

I have to admit that I had my doubts about this recipe. The part where you add cranberries and orange zest to the flour mixture had me confused, thinking I must have read it wrong. I did that step exactly as stated, the whole time mulling over whether or not I was going to need all of that flour, because it has been dry with forced heat on since it is winter. It had stressed me to some degree, over whether all the cranberries would get into the dough that was coming together quite thick.

I have made all kinds of breads from recipes I have found on here, and none that I recall mention adding anything much other than dry ingredients to the flour, so it threw me off.

I am officially sold on it.

I found I didn’t have any pecans left, so I used almonds I put through the food processor. I had more  nuts than called for in the recipe, but reserved some to put on top a glaze I made for when the bread came out and had rested briefly. The glaze was made from the juice of the oranges I had zested, some  vanilla, splash of almond oil, about a tsp. of cream of tartar, and a little more than half a bag of powdered sugar.  I also had doubled the recipe and had almost a whole extra cup of cranberries in the loaves to use the bag of those up.

So tasty! It’s a keeper, and thanks for sharing this recipe.

I used 1 and half cups of leftover cranberry sauce. It was homemade cranberry sauce that had a touch of orange rind.  It came out moist and delicious.

I added a half cup blueberries, and reduced the cranberry to 1 cup. I changed the white sugar to brown, Added 1/4 teaspoon of real vanilla, lemon zest instead of orange(it was what I had) and no nuts.

Only thing I changed was adding walnuts and more cranberries than the recipe called for. 
I didn’t realize this makes 2 loafs.  Made me love it even more.

This was delicious and as one viewer said 'even better the next day'.  I cooked it for 50 minutes, not 60 and it was perfect.  I drizzled 1/4 cup of orange juice over the hot cake while it was still in the pan.  It did not need any icing sugar in the mix.  Perfect.

Delicious!  I added an orange glaze on top.  I used walnuts and added a few shakes of cinnamon, otherwise followed the recipe.  I'll be making this loaf as gifts for Christmas.  Next time I might add even more walnuts because I love the crunch and the tart of the cranberries.

I was given a bag of fresh Cape Cod cranberries and used about half to make this bread.  I decided to grind about 3/4 of them in my Bullet as I thought cutting them in half too tedious.  The only changes I made were I added a tsp of cinnamon and a sprinkle of cloves (couldn’t find orange zest in my spice  drawer) and eliminated the nuts.  I used three small bread pans, filled about 2/3 up the pan and they rose up beautifully. I made a glaze of 1/4 cup confectioners sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1T orange juice. It was enough to give a light glaze for all three loaves.  Will make it again using the rest of the cranberries.

At the recommendation of another review, I drizzled the loaf with a simple glaze of powdered sugar, orange juice, and vanilla. It tastes amazing! I will definitely make this recipe again, perhaps with a bit of vanilla.

Needed a bit extra oomph so I made a icing sugar glaze with white chocolate and drizzled it on top! It covered the loaf and helped keep the freshness in. It disappeared so fast!

Delicious way to use fresh cranberries!  I use a long, narrow loaf pan, I believe it's 4x13".  I also glazed with icing sugar, fresh squeezed orange juice, and vanilla as others have done.

The best cranberry bread I've ever eaten.  Light and airy, didn't over mix the batter so maybe that had something to do with it.  Not overly sweet, perfect blend of sweet and tart with the cranberries. Didn't change anything except used butter instead of margarine and omitted the glaze just because I wanted a less sweet loaf. I will make this again and try it with blueberries as well.

Fantastic recipe as is, no tweets needed!  To us it's even better the 2nd day.  Best of all it freezes very well.  We can make plenty while crans are in season and have it most of the year.  Always a great gift too.  Happy new year!

Excellent!!! I used freshly squeezed orange juice & it made a huge difference. It seemed much more tender this go-around. I also glazed with the oj, powdered sugar & vanilla a mixture. Delicious!! Definitely a keeper.

Great!  I used oil instead of margarine and added white chocolate chips. Soaked the cranberries in orange juice for a few minutes and mashed them very slightly.   Was a hit!

I made this bread with leftover cranberry sauce from thanksgiving which was already cooked with orange juice and sugar and added some walnuts to one bag of fresh cranberries. It was strained and it amounted to what this recipe called for. I stuck to the recipe and substituted butter . I also added an assortment of 1 cup of chopped nuts that was leftover. I did what others suggested and added a glaze of about 1/2 cup of orange juice, 1/2 tsp. Of vanilla ,1/2 tsp. Of orange zest and 1 cup of confectioners sugar and drizzled it all over. The end result was a very moist, delicious loaf and baked up very nice . Wonderful way to use leftovers. R

This is a great recipe. The only thing I've found that makes it even better is if you add some quarter inch slices from half of the orange you zested.

This recipe is great! Followed the recipe but left out the nuts. Turned out wonderfully-- the bread is moist and sweet without being overwhelmingly tart. I was worried about it getting too hard because I divided the batter into two smaller bread pans, but that was not an issue. I topped with the glaze suggested by another reviewer after allowing the loaves to cool for about 10 minutes.

Soooo good!  I used sweetened dried cranberries and took the advice of a reviewer who suggested soaking them in boiling orange juice.  I didn't measure my orange zest but probably had almost double since I was using up some oranges and juicing them.  Meant to try some of the other suggestions and forgot; I may try them next time just for fun but there's really no need, this was awesome as is with just the right amount of sweetness and cranberry and orange flavor.

I left out the nuts, doubled the recipe and baked it in an angle food pan for 1 hr.  I was worried about the taste, after tasting the the cranberries...very bitter, but was pleasantly rewarded  with a wonder taste and texture in this bread.

Amazingly wonderful. I tripled the batch,  halved the fresh Cranberries. It made 9 mini loaves, I drizzled a cream cheese icing on top, refrigerated until cooled wrapped in saran tied with ribbon and gave them out as gifts.  They had "perfect" texture and taste. Definitely a keeper!

Loved it! I added a glaze to it because it seemed like the thing to do. Glaze I used was: 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. almond flavoring, 1/2 tsp. butter flavoring, 3/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup orange juice. Mix in sauce pan and cook until sugar is dissolved.

Yum!   Next time I'll chop up the cranberries. For me the whole cranberries were too much in a bite, the smaller pieces might spread it out.  The bread was very moist, and was still good a few days after it was made.

The only edits I made were to use 2 cups of chopped fresh cranberries because I wanted to get rid of them and I added an orange glaze as others had suggested. 1/2 cup confectioner sugar, bit of orange zest and splash of orange juice.

The bread was okay but I figured out cranberries are just too sour for me. I would substitute cranberries for chocolate chips or blueberries if u made this again. Also the photo shows it with icing but doesn't give any recipe for the glaze. I tried to take other reviews advice but since no one mentioned how much of anything to use my glaze didn't turn out well either.

This one was really good! I substituted walnuts for pecan because that's what I had on hand, and I covered it partway through to prevent over browning. Also made a orange glaze for the top, it was delicious!

This is my go to Christmas recipe! I make loaves for my friends every year and they love it. The only thing I do differently than the recipes is omit the nuts.

Instead of whole cranberries, I used my leftover whole berry relish from Thanksgiving. To compensate for the extra liquid, I reduced the orange juice to 1/2  cup. Came out delicious, very moist and flavorful!

Post-Thanksgiving, and I have a ton of leftover fresh cranberry-orange relish, so what better way to use it up?! I simply substituted the relish for the whole cranberries in the recipe, and because it's evenly disbursed throughout the entire loaf, you get the wonderful (and not too tart) flavors of cranberry, orange AND pecan in every bite! This will now be a regular part of our post-Thanksgiving celebration.

I've been making this recipe since the dawn of time. It is, by far, my family's all time favorite quick bread. I make & give this bread as gifts every holiday season to raving compliments from friends,some even ask me to make extra for their holiday tables! This recipe is  very easy to make,(my children learned how by the age of seven!) This is a must have no brainer for your perfect holiday meal.

Cranberries were on sale so I bought extra and glad I did.  Hardest part of the recipe was zesting the orange and getting the thick batter from the bowl.  I did add probably 1/4 cup extra cranberries but it turned out moist and the taste has been a hit.  Definitely a keeper recipe for this household.

I made these exactly as the recipe stated with two exceptions. I used gluten free flour and made them into muffins instead. I added a powdered sugar icing over the top and they are DELICIOUS! Will made again for sure

Absolutely love this cranberry orange bread! I made it for the holidays and everyone raved about it. I did follow some of the tips from other reviews. I chopped the cranberries in halves and I made a glaze of milk, confectionary sugar, and vanilla which I drizzled over the top of the bread as soon as I pulled it out of the oven. It was so delicious!

I made this recipe to the T except for the nuts.  Had to leave them out.  Everything else was followed exactly.  These were just amazing by themselves.  I had one right out of the oven.  So yummy. Later, I decided to add some glaze after they cooled off.  I started with 1 cup powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and slowly added enough orange juice to get a thick glaze.  It just added a little something extra to the muffin.  PLEASE DO NOT BEAT MUFFIN BATTER AS IT WILL MAKE A TOUGH MUFFIN.  Gently stir just until combined.

Watching it bake right now.  Husband is still sleeping in Saturday morning.  Thought i would surprise him with some holiday flavours with this morning coffee.  Looks like its working fine.  I followed the recipe exactly but had a slightly smaller bread loaf pan so its rising nice and tall.  Also, I buttered the dish and "sanded" it with sugar so the outside with have a glistening sugar crust…I am sure with the ingredients inside it will taste great.  Also, i only used one cup of fresh cranberries not to have it too sour!  OH, ha, also, I added 1/2 teaspoon all natural orange flavour to the dough….I guess i didn't follow the recipe exactly, but even though, great looking, rising in the oven with 10 minutes to go.  ENJOY and happy holidays.

This recipe hardly needs any further kudos with almost 600 reviews, but I just had to throw my 2 cents in and say I'm giving this recipe 5 stars for flavour, moistness and adaptability.  Made the rookie mistake of starting the prep before I realized I didn't have enough of all the ingredients, as I was doubling the recipe.  Used a 227 gram bag of frozen cranberries (pulsed coarsly in food processor made only about 1 1/2 cups), used 1 c. of white sugar and 1 c. golden sugar, used 3/4 c orange juice and 3/4 c mango juice, left out the pecans because of the allergy risk as I was baking for our school's Christmas bake sale. Followed the advice of other reviews and topped with an orange glaze made of 1 cup icing sugar, about 4 Tbsp. fresh squeezed o.j., a tsp. of orange zest and 1 Tbsp melted butter.  Doubled, this recipe made 5 mini loaves (the small disposable aluminum foil type pans) and the glaze proportion was perfect.  4 loaves for the bake sale and one for home :)  Perfect tangy-ness, lovely tart-sweet crunch to the glaze and oh-so-moist without any greasiness.  Will make terrific gifts or keep in the freezer for unexpected guests.  I always get a chuckle from the reviewers who make massive revisions before rating a recipe and here I am doing the very same, although this time our of necessity, not design!  A real keeper Carol, thank you! Note: If you do make smaller loaves, watch the baking time, I think mine were done in under 40 min.

Possibly the best quick bread I've ever made. Had to make a couple of substitutions since I ran out of orange juice and zest. Added cut up candied orange peel for the zest and used some water with natural orange extract to make up the OJ deficit. A tender and tasty loaf.

very good.  Made it as is but did take other readers suggestions of putting an orange drizzle on top while it was still warm in the pan.

Change nothing!  Perfect as is with a cup of tea or coffee on a cold winter afternoon.  Also makes a satisfying dessert.  Family raved!  And raved some more.

I really suggest adding some sour cream to the batter to keep the loaf moist. I added about 1/3 to 1/2 of a cup and it helped a lot! Adding an extra egg wouldn't hurt either :)

I just made this recipe today. I let it cool for three hours and It is fabulous. I used vegetable oil instead of margarine and King Arthur Cake Blend flour instead of All Purpose flour. I only used these substitutions because I didn't have margarine or AP flour in the house. I used Ocean Spray Frozen Cranberries and I did not thaw them out or cut them in half. The directions on the package of cranberries said not to thaw them in a baking recipe and I figure they know best. I baked them in a medium colored pan for 52 minutes and the loaf was done perfect. My oven runs a little hot. When I set it for 350 it runs at 360. I made sure all the cranberries were coated with flour so that they would not sink to the bottom of the pan while cooking. Great Recipe!!!!!

This is a great quick bread recipe.  Have been looking for a bread recipe that uses fresh cranberries. Only change I made was to cut up my fresh cranberries and used walnuts instead of pecans.  Makes a moist, tasty bread which also freezes well.  I've also made using fresh blueberries and lemon juice in place of the cranberries and orange juice.

i took the advise of another viewer and used crasins soaked in the orange juice that i heated on the stove.
i also melted the butter.  This made it a bit easier to mix by hand.  And added another egg.  I baked at 350 for 50 mins

I was glad to find this recipe....my husband and I had been buying slices from a bakery and now I can make it at home.  I make the recipe as is except sometimes I use walnuts.  Like other reviewers, I made a batch and used the smaller loaf pans to give some away at Christmas.

Everyone loved this.  I used craisins and soaked them in some boiling water to soften them up.  Definitely add the glaze.

Delicious.   Made exactly as stated in the recipe, except I added the glaze on top when it cooled slightly.  I cannot give it 5 stars as written because it really needs the glaze.  It is nice and tart and my 8 year old, along with the rest of the family, could not get enough of it.

Made as directed except for rough chopping cranberries with a 1/4 c of sugar before adding to mixture   ( using the 1/4 from the 1 cup as to not increase sugar amount)) I will be making this recipe again. Delish !!

When I was in 5th grade (a loooooong time ago), my teacher had us all make Cranberry Nut Loaf.  Every year after that my mom MADE me make it.  UGH!  This year my daughter and I decided to make it for her for Christmas.  We followed this recipe, most of it. It was delicious! We weren't able to find fresh cranberries and wound up reconstituting dried cranberries.  To stay truer to my original recipe we used walnuts instead of pecans.  EVERYONE loved it!  Thank you.

Super tasty! I doubled the batch and baked them in "Mini Loaf" pans at 325* for 40 minutes convection. It made 10 pans for a bake sale. I have already been asked for the recipe a few times!

I freaked out!  I ate the oranges after I zested it and didn't realized I was supposed to save the orange to juice it.  So, in a frantic, I added my "fanta" orange soda and threw in extra orange zest I had.  Also, I didn't have pecans.  I threw in crushed slivered almonds.  YAAY me.  This is SO nice!  I had 3 lbs of fresh cranberries and didn't know what to do with it.  This recipe is a "MARRIAGE SAVER!"  I LOVE the crusty top feel to this muffin version.  I needed something that was quick to pack and drive away.  It made one loaf of bread and 6 muffins. :-)  THUMBS UP - the frantic baker.

Southern(ized) It!
I chose to substitute some cornmeal for flour, and 100% natural coconut pineapple juice and vanilla for orange juice and orange zest.  Then I baked it in a Bundt pan.  When cooled, I wrapped it and put the ring in the refrigerator for 2- 3 weeks to give as a gift.

Delicious! A wonderful morning or afternoon coffee treat. I've made this loaf twice because my husband loved it so much (and so did I).  I did coarsely chop up the cranberries(they were still big chunks)but that is the only change I made.

Moist, delicious and just plain good. Used toasted sunflower seeds to accommodate a nut allergy and it was a big hit. A little tart but still yummy.

I made this bread last night with the following changes...I roughly chopped my cranberries and I used bread flour as it was all I had on hand, and I made a glaze of 1/4 cup powdered sugar and 4 tsp OJ. This bread was fabulous! Best bread I have made. My husband immediately requested I make mini loaves for him to take to work! My husband had suggested though that next time the cranberries be chopped finely to disperse them more throughout the bread, the tartness was so good with the orange flavor he said he wanted more of it with every bite.

I started making this last winter and have made it many times since.  This is our new favorite quick bread. Only change I made was to omit the pecans as we don't like nuts in our baked goods.  I also use a glaze made with orange juice and powdered sugar. I have to make a double batch because one loaf barely lasts one day.  My son requests I send him one of these when he is working out of state.  It freezes wonderfully.

Really good.  Watch the timing though.  This can go from moist to dry in 2 minutes time.  Sometimes I put up to a cup of orange juice to make it more moist

I was on my third piece before I could stop myself - SO GOOD. I followed the advice of many reviewers and doubled the recipe, then divided into three loaf pans (and then tossed two in the freezer, ready for unexpected company). I loaded up on extra cranberries because I love them, and left out the pecans because I'm not a fan of hard bits in a soft delicious bread, just my personal preference. Oh and used butter instead of margarine. Perfect! Now the only challenge is keeping those two frozen loaves for company....

I baked this yesterday.  Since I don't like to have too much sugar in my cakes, I halved the sugar...it turned out really good...a bit rough / crumbly...but probably it would taste better a few days later?  But in any case, the citrus taste and the cranberries are a great combo!  Will be making them again!

I changed this recipe a little.  Instead of making a loaf I made muffins.  I also replaced the pecans with white chocolate chips so the kids could take the muffins to school as a snack.  Love this recipe.

WOWZER! Best Cranberry Orange loaf EVER! I cannot stop eating it!! I made a glaze of 1 3/4 cups 10x sugar, 6-7 TBS Grand Marnier and 1/2 tsp vanilla. Also, I poked a few holes into the loaf before glazing. A definite keeper and "go to" recipe.  Thanks for posting

This was a real hit with my friends.  I used walnuts instead of pecans because walnuts are less expensive.  I cut the cranberries into halves before putting them in the batter.  Lastly, I used half brown sugar and half white sugar.  When friends ask for a recipe, I know I've done something right.  Thanks.

My friends have said that this is better than the local cafe's version!!  It is delicious - I love cranberries and the orange just sets the flavor.  I didn't change a thing.

Very good!  I made this recipe as mini loaves to give away at Christmas.  The common consensus was that they were very moist and flavorful.  Some said maybe it was a bit too much orange.  It took away a little from the taste of the cranberries.

This bread was wonderful! The tart cranberries, zesty orange, and sweetness of the bread really balanced and made a great loaf. One batch made three pretty full mini loaves that required a baking sheet for the drips but turned out beautifully. I halved the cranberries to reduce their tartness, and tried making the glaze that others suggested with 1c. powdered sugar and some orange juice and vanilla, but ended up having to add several tablespoons milk because it was way too dry! I don't know how other people must have made it but it did add a nice touch to my loaves when fixed. The hardest part was waiting until the next day to eat them!

I thought it was good but not fluffy like everyone said...maybe I did something wrong but I followed except for leaving out the nuts.  I will try again.  Though not the best looking or texture..still was tastey.

I doubled the recipe and used two 8x4 pans.  I omitted the nuts, and otherwise made it exactly as written.  It is so yummy and moist.  The person who said it was like biscotti must have omitted some ingredient or had old baking powder or soda.  The sweetness of the orange offsets the tartness of the cranberry.  Originally made it for my husband, but I am eating most of it!  Thanks for the recipe - it is a keeper.

This bread was delicious. 1st time baking with fresh cranberries.  Cut them in half before adding them to the batter as per other reviewers. Doubled the recipe, used walnuts instead of pecans, added a glaze to the top after baking & used butter instead of margarine. The cranberry & orange flavor were very complimentary together.  The bread was even better the next day.   Will definitely be making this bread again!

I'm not a big cranberry bread fan, but thought this would be nice for a holiday treat....and it changed my mind.. This was great.  I did not put any glaze on it.  I am now baking mini loaves and will put a little glaze on it and give them as Christmas gifts to my friends.

Tried this because we were spending $$ for muffins of similar name at a big chain bakery/coffee shop. Their muffins definitely tasted as though made with buttermilk...which we liked. So, in the first run of what I think may be many... I used 3/4 cup buttermilk + 1/4 cup orange juice for the liquid. Left out nuts, due to allergy. Baked then cooled, wrapped in plastic wrap, chilled overnight in 'fridge before the big "taste test". We REALLY liked this! My husband actually said it was better than the bakery's! I divided the dough between two 3 x 8 inch pans and baked the full 50 min. at 350. I have a slow-ish oven, however, so start checking at 45 minutes. Photo should accompany this review.

Yummy doesn't begin to describe this recipe! The loaf is moist, fragrant and tastes divine!  I made these as gifts for my kids' teachers for Christmas so rather than baking it as a loaf, I used muffin tins.  I adjusted the cooking time and they turned out perfectly!

This bread smelled and tasted fabulous. But I am having a problem and would love to hear of a solution. First of all,I used butter instead of margarine and a tablespoon or 2 of the 3/4 cup OJ was OJ concentrate. Everything was room temperature. When I added the OJ to the butter/sugar/egg mixture, it curdled. Did any of you find that? Related or not, the big problem was that the bread did not rise in the middle, but was a bit sunken. This is the best tasting cranberry orange bread I've ever had but it doesn't look great and I had hoped to give small loaves as gifts. I want it to work! Any ideas?

The flavour of this bread is very good and not too sweet. The batter however was very stiff and the resultant bread was on the dry side. I think in the future I would add a bit of sour cream or oil or more eggs to moisten it up a bit.

This recipe is delicious.  I didn't change a thing other than to add the orange/powdered sugar/vanilla glaze to the top that a few of the other reviewers mentioned.  I rate it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it could do with some cinnamon and nutmeg.  I will add them next time.  Other than that, beautiful, fragrant and yummy.  I will be using this for one of my Christmas breads this year!  Thank you, Carol!

Lovely!
I'm cleaning out the larder before a move and have used up all the nuts, so substituted coconut instead. Used the last 1/3 cup of white sugar and made up the difference with brown sugar. Both great additions to a great recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe.  The bread dough is perfectly moist and bit sticky.  The combination of the slightly sweet orange juice and tart real cranberries is amazing.  Family favorite.

Dang.  Made exactly as directed using soft tub margarine (I think I should have used butter or stick margarine?) and the entire thing collasped in oven.  I did use frozen berries ... perhaps not thawed enough?  Flavor is there so ranking as 4.  Will update once I get some butter and try again.

Loved this recipe!  I've made it a couple of times.  Added cinnamon to the batter and subbed pistachios for the walnuts.  A simple powdered sugar glaze over the top is great too.  They make a nice hostess gift for the holidays when wrappped in waxed paper and tied with bakers twine.

This loaf turned out really yummy.  It was a little more firm than I would've liked, but it was still a huge hit for our Thanksgiving table!

Nice flavor and texture. One thing though, please mix the sugar with the flour!!! (not with the wet ingred). I should have known that, but slavishly followed the recipe. Sadly, the flour clumped into the little berry sections and stayed there through the baking. A disappointing result, but it won't stop me from trying it again - the proper way.

Tasted great.  Made as instructed, make sure you dust the pan as ordered.  I used a 'baking stone' (4) small loaf pan, and I used Pam spray only and they stuck to the pan (my fault)  I should have done as instructed, however, if it would have been a metal pan, I still don't think it would stick.  I make a Betty Crocker Zuchinni Bread and only use pam spray in the metal pan and wait 10 minutes before inverting it and it never sticks, so good luck.  I had some frozen cranberries that I had bought over the holidays and I used them, & it tasted great with the fresh cranberries.  I also had some dried cranberries, but chose not to use them.  I love the cranberry & orange combination.  Now all I need to do is make some cranberry/orange biscotti with some pistachio nuts & almond flavoring and an almond flavored frosting, and I'll really be in business.  :)  Love that combination as well.

Absolutely delicious, and it tastes even better over the next few days.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I substituted walnuts instead of pecans, since I didn't have any pecans at home.  This recipe is a winner!  I'm going to be giving this bread to family members this Christmas.  (A pan is in the oven now!) :)

Subbed applesauce for butter to make low fat. Absolutely fantastic!  Doubled recipe, it made 3 8X4 disposible loaf pans (baked 50 min). For all of us who need to indulge in something that tastes soooo good and is actually healthy.  Thanks Carol.

Delicious and moist! Easy to veganize by substituting 1 tbsp ground flaxseed (mixed with 3 tbsp water) for the egg. Don't skip the powdered sugar/OJ glaze that others suggested below! It perfectly balanced out the tartness of the cranberries. Will make again for sure!

I love this recipe! Made it for family and friends at work and church and they all asked for recipe. Growing up my mom used to make cranberry orange bread for the holidays and this recipe tastes just like hers. I didn't put a glaze on top and some loaves had whole cranberries and others had halved cranberries. Either way is excellent!!!!

I've been makeing 30+ loaves of this bread each year for several years as holiday presents for teachers/ office mates/ school bus drivers, etc. Everyone loves it! I double the recipe and make 3 loaves in the larger aluminum foil pans. They wrap and save beautifully. I also leave out the nuts b/c of allergies so prevalent today. All in all - a winner!

The best cranberry bread/loaf ever tasted. Beautiful blend of sweet and tart, moist and yet only slightly dense.  I doubled the recipe and got three loaves out of it.  I used fresh squeezed OJ(with some pulp) and added 2 tsp of ground cloves.  The glaze adds another element of tart/sweet goodness.
This is a reall keeper!!!!!!!!!!

I tripled this recipe and made a lot of loaves to share with my friends and family.  Everyone loved them.  I did use the frosting on top but I think I will skip next time as they are plenty sweet without it.  They loved the festive colors as well.

Very good! But I followed the recipe exactly (except for the nuts), used an 8x4 pan and was done in 35 mins. It did overcook on the outside, but the inside was perfect. I'm still wondering about the time, I guess I have a crazy hot oven!

This is wonderful. I slightly blended the cranberries in the orange juice instead and with one batch I added about a half tsp of almond extract instead of adding pecans.  The flavor was outstanding and I had people asking me to take orders after my Christmas bake sale.  I doubled the recipe and it made 3 med loaves. (using disposable tinfoil pans) It didn't even need the frosting though it looks prettier that way.

This was WONDERFUL....I didn't change a thing except I didn't use the pecans.  Very moist...the cake was nice and sweet and the cranberries added a wonderful touch of tart.  Will make this again for our News Years Eve gathering .

very, very good! I also added the glaze of oj, vanilla and powdered sugar. Very moist, excellent taste and so pretty! Mine stayed a little flat; I might try it in an 8x4 pan next time. Definitely a keeper though!

I love cranberry orange bread, it always reminds me of the holidays. I alter this recipe by adding an entire package of fresh cranberries. I keep them whole and once in the oven they will burst giving the bread an added wonderful flavor and keep the bread moist inside. I also do not add nuts.

My sister came to help me recoop after surgery and she made me this bread! It is SO AWESOME! I had to have the recipe. It is so fresh and wonderful tasting. She substituted the dried cranberries and it was wonderful! I WILL be making this all the time now.

Fantastic!  We used another reviewer's suggestion and made a glaze.  I would make my glaze a little sweeter next time but it was great like this too!  Thanks so much!

Excellent cake-like bread!.  This first bite or two is so tangy that it's surprising, then it really grows on you so that it's hard to stop eating it.  Didn't last long!  I had an entire bag of frozen cranberries so doubled the recipe to make 2 loaves.

I'll give this wonderful recipe 5 stars. I only  had 1 piece of this delicious loaf. Unfortunately, my 2 year old spotted it on the counter and decided to squish it to pieces and left me with nothing but crumble cranberry orange loaf. The dog finished it off and gave it 5 stars also! I will make it again. Next time I'll be storing it somewhere out of little peoples reach. :)

I made this loaf because I wanted to use up the remaining frozen cranberries in my freezer.   My modifications were: - 2 tsp. of baking powder instead of the 1/2 tsp. of baking soda - no orange zest (I didn't have any oranges on hand) - 1 cup of frozen cranberries (all I had left) - no pecans  Had it in the oven 55 minutes and should have put it in for the full hour given that there was a small undercooked patch in the middle.  The amount of cranberries was perfect, given that I didn't put orange zest, as it did not over power the orange flavour.  Topped it off with the Vanilla Glaze recipe on this site (1/3 the original).  My boyfriend loves it! Unexpected since he's not a big fan of cakes/sweet things. he's already had more than 1/2 the loaf today! It was so simple to make I will definately make it again!!

I love the orange flavor! Next time I'll use just a cup of cranberries and rough chop them so the juices get to mix with the sugar of the bread. I didn't care for the super tart cranberry juice that squirted when I bit into a whole berry.  Raspberries would be delicious too. I made Fruit Pizza II by Kay Craft earlier this week (superb!), and had some toppings left over; they were delicious on the bread!  Cream cheese, powdered sugar and whipped topping mixed together. Also the glaze for the pizza which put it over the top. It'd be good if holes were poked in the bread and this glaze was poured over and allowed to soak in. No matter how you top it, this bread is a winner!

Love this. First time I didn't bother with the orange zest but you really need it. I also decrease the sugar to 3/4 cup the second time. Not much difference. Also, bake them as muffins for 25 min the second time too.

Very good flavor,  texture was a little dry and crumbly.  I mixed the wet and dry ingredients just until incorporated so I didn't over mix it.  I may try butter in place of the margarine next time.

Great recipe--with nuts it's more breadlike, without nuts it's more cakelike. I baked in 3 small loaf pans for about 45 mins. And I added a little drizzle of buttercream icing and I only had a little oj so I used apple juice too. Really tasty!

I modified the recipe, and MINE only came out to be 3 stars. If I had actually followed the recipe, it might be higher. Instead of orange juice and zest, I used a can of drained mandarin oranges, and it made the dough a little dense. I also had to decrease the cooking time by almost 15 minutes. I did not make the glaze, because I used dried cranberries and assumed it would be sweet enough already, and it was.

I really like this loaf!  The only thing I changed was that I doubled the pecans (and added pecans on top before baking).  Afterwards, I topped it off with an orange glaze, as suggested by others.  If you don't like "tart" then you might want to chop the cranberries or use less (or find another recipe...)

This was delicious.  I used  frozen cranberries, and ran them under some lukewarm water to help thaw them.  I also added a streusel topping to the bread.

This recipe made enough for 2 loaves. I'm glad because the first loaf was gone Christmas day! Very good, just enough orange sweetness with just enough cranberry tartness. Will definately be making this again.

Oh my goodness!  Soooo good!  I made several loaves & gave them away as Christmas gifts.  Everyone LOVED it!  I took the advice from another review & added the orange glaze, which I made from powdered sugar, a little vanilla & orange juice.  Mmmmm good!  It added that perfect little zing & touch to the bread.  So good!  I am making more for New Years!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!  A definite keeper for years to come!

All I have to say is.. eh.  I doubled the batch to make three smaller loaves (brought them to some Christmas parties) and chopped the cranberries in the food processor.  I topped them with cream cheese frosting.  They looked beautiful but the taste was not good.  At least I thought so.  I probably won't make this again but may try different fruits.  The cranberry and orange was not what I had hoped it to be.

This bread is amazing and simple! I don't mix it as directed--I cream the butter (real, unsalted) and sugar (raw sugar--gives it a "warmer" flavor) for quite a bit. Then I add the egg. Then I alternate the dry ingredients and zest with the oj. Last, I fold in the cranberries by hand. I left out the nuts--I think they would absolutely ruin this recipe. The flavor is so perfect without the nuts. I've made this twice now, and it's big hit!!

Great recipe for Christmas morning (or any morning for that matter!)  Served it with coffee for the parents in the morning.  Tart and sweet, great flavor!  Tried to figure out the glaze for on top and just mixed OJ with some confectioners sugar and vanilla, yum!

I just found and made this recipe today after reading through some others. This was so great! I used sliced almonds in place of the pecans because that's what I had on and - and had to use butter in place of the margarine. Otherwise everything was the same. Oh, and I cut my cranberries in half, which I think was worth the time. I baked it in a bread bowl baker, which I probably won't do again (it baked a little uneven), but it's still SO good! I did do the orange glaze - 1 cup of powdered sugar with a splash of OJ and a drop of vanilla. I glazed it once immediately out of the oven and once about an hour later. YUMM-O!

I followed the recipe exactly. It wasn't bad and it was a beautiful bread, but it wasn't sweet enough for my taste....the cranberries had to much bite still.

Since so many reviews said this took longer than 1 hour in a 9x5 loaf pan, I put it in the oven for the full hour before I checked on it and the top was already starting to burn.  It was still nice and moist on the inside though.  Great recipe - it just doesn't need quite that long to bake.

Delicious! Didn't feel like zesting an orange, but did use fresh-squeezed OJ. I also used about 2 c. cranberries and increased butter to 1/2 cup based on previous reviews of a "too dry" loaf in lieu of glazing the final loaf.  Came out great -- dense, moist, and flavorful. Just as a good holiday bread should be!

We really enjoy this recipe.  If it is a favorite, and you have children, you have to get the book Cranberry Thanksgiving around Thanksgiving time and read this.  We read it every year and bake this bread.  The book is about grandmother's top secret recipe for cranberry bread and it makes it sound so good that you feel like you have to make it.  :)  The recipe in the back is almost exactly like this one except it adds in quite a few raisins, instead of pecans.

Delicious Christmas bread. I doubled the recipe, made in 5 small (gift-size) bread tins, and cooked for about 35 minutes. Came out great! I used dried cranberries but really see how fresh ones would make it prettier.

The cranberries and orange work perfectly together.  I added extra juice as the batter was thick and it came out perfect.  I didn't have cranberries so I used dried cranberries and they worked great, made the bread sweeter as we like.

This loaf is WONDERFUL! My house smelled amazing while it was baking and we had a hard time waiting for it to cool down to try it! I doubled the recipe and actually used 4 cups of fresh berries and it turned out lovely.  I also doubled the amount of orange zest, so for a double batch I used 4 tablespoons. I skipped the orange glaze and I'm glad I did - it was perfect as is. Serisouly, this is very very yummy, pretty and festive!

I am on my 12th loaf of this, I live in the country and it is good to get to know your neighbors before the winter sets in, you never know when you may need a backhoe...hahahaha!!!
I used freshly squeezed orange juice and lots of pulp, it gives an extra texture sensation that everyone (so far) has loved. I had to borrow commercial mixing bowls as I made this recipe six times (sextuple it?)  my arms are tired from mixing but it is SO good!
Thanks for sharing this!

This has excelent flavor!  I did double the orange zest and it was the perfect combination of tart cranberries and sweet orange flavors.  I did not like the nuts in it though, I will leave them out next time; and it did not rise very well.  To put it plainly, It fell.  I will try it again, it might have been my oven or old baking powder or soda.  I did really like this and it might turn out better after a little refining

So delicious!  I had dried cherries in the pantry, so I substituted them for the cranberries and it worked out very well.  I didn't add a glaze, as others have suggested.  The bread was very sweet on it's own.

I followed the recipe exactly.  While baking it poured over the sides of the loaf pan & all over the bottom of the oven.  Burning & smoke were my alert.  I shut the oven off, took out the bread, cleaned it all up, then put it back in the oven.  I added extra time to bake.  It came out flat & the flavor wasn't anything to get excited about.  Normally cranberry orange type dishes are bursting with flavor.  Not so here.  I wont make this again.

I have just started making muffins, and these are by far my favorite so far. The orange and cranberry flavors are perfectly balanced. Really magnificent!

Oh man!!  This was awesome and the glaze really helped.  I've already made it two additional times after the first try.  Top notch and better than anything I've gotten at a store.  Thanks for this great recipe.

Great bread if you like tart/sweet combinations.  I thought it was a bit tart but my husband loved it.  A nice change from the usual bread recipes.

We loved it! I followed the hints of others by cutting the cranberries up.  I was looking for a recipe to use up mandardin oranges so it took extra long to peel and put them through the processor then strain out the pulp, I needed to boost the orange flavor so I added some of the zest and 1 tsp orange oil. The icing definitely added to the loaf. The waiting for a day, although hard on my husband, was worth it! I would make this again.

My husband loves this.  My kids love this.  I have made it at least 6 times over the holiday season --- all at their request.  Hopefully, there are still cranberries at the store when I go back.  They want more!

This was great. It was very flavorful and easy to make. I omitted the pecans as I don't care for nuts in cake. I also glazed it while warm with some powdered sugar mixed with just a touch of orange juice.

This is an excellent recipe.  I made two loaves.  One for us, and one for my two favorite neighborhood boys.  Rave reviews came from their house as well as our house.  Make this bread, you won't be disappointed!
Substituted walnuts, I was out of pecans.

Very delicious! This bread was great when the family is tired of pumpkin bread at Christmas!
I left out the orange zest and it really did need it! The orange flavor compliments the cranberries very well! Thanks for a great recipe!

AMAZING! I doubled the recipe and it was enough for one regular size loaf, a mini loaf and 6 big muffins. I was worried it was going to come out a little dry, but as soon as you take a bite with a cranberry it just bursts with flavor and moistness (is that a word?). I was also a little short on the orange zest but it had plenty of orange flavor. I noticed some reviewers chopped up the cranberry's, but I think keeping them whole is the best way to go. They really just burst with flavor when you bite into them! I'll be making this again. :)

Very moist and fluffy.  Would be great with your coffee and probably much healthier than the pastries at Starbucks.  I always halve the sugar because my mom is pre-diabetic, but I imagine this cake would not have been too sweet even with the entire cup of sugar.  Besides, the cranberries can be pretty tart.  This would be great for gifts or entertaining because it comes out a pretty color and looks decorative.

I had high hopes for this recipe.  I served it to a group this morning and some did not care for the tartness of the cranberries.  Others did enjoy it.

This is delicious.  I fresh squeezed the orange juice and I think that just made it even better.  I am glad I made two.  One for my family to eat and I froze one for Christmas morning.  Very good.

Very good!  Next time I will put it in for less time (I took it out after 55 minutes and it was over done), add more cranberries, and cut the sugar by a quarter cup (I found it too sweet).  Then I think it will be perfect.

This made the house smell soooo good!  I would definitely make it before having company over.  I didn't think the whole cranberries were too tart.  Might make the glaze next time and serve it as a dessert, but it doesn't need it when served as a tasty afternoon snack.

I loved the cake.  Ny husband who does not like cranberries did not.  I had a similar cake this Chirstmas at my sister and had everyintention of trying it but found this one here.  

I brought 1/2 of the remaining cake to work the next day but forgot to give it out until the end of the day.  Got rave reviews.  I took the rest in today and again the response was great.  Someone even offered to pay me to make them one.  

I followed the recipe and did not chop my cranberries.  They were small though, and I can see why if they were large chopping would be required.  Use lots of zest.  It makes it taste great.

This bread is very nice.  Fantastic flavor and texture.  I has some leftover topping from (To Die For Blueberry Muffins) from this site, so I sprinkled it on top before I baked the bread, very good.  I think I will try the orange glaze that some of the other reviewers have been using next time I make this.

I love orange cranberry bread, my grandma used to make it when I was younger( out of a box) and it was good. When I found this recipe I thought I would try it out for my Christmas party and it was Fabulous,way better than anything from a box. Now I make it all the time. Thanks

Was really torn about whether this one should be 5 star. I loved it, but my kids thought the cranberries were to tart. 
I think it is something I can bake knowing that only the more sophisticated pallates in our family will eat. Which just means more for me!
I know that chopping the berries would help with the kid issue, but to me that is what makes this bread great!

This is good and very easy to make-My only suggestions would be to watch this while it bakes-This did not take an hour to cook-45 minutes tops, and chop up the cranberries.

Great moist bread. Super easy. I also sub applesauce for oil and it comes out perfect every time. Only other change is that I am unable to find fresh cranberrys right now (australian summer) so I have used fresh crans packed in water. Can't wait to try with fresh.

Very tasty and easy bread.  I made it twice, and the 2nd time didn't have quite enough OJ so I added a big dollop of sour cream to the mix.  I liked it even better that way.  I also did a glaze on top (butter, conf sugar, splash of milk, 1/2 t of vanilla) that was a nice contrast to the tanginess of the bread.  This is a keeper.

I made 3 of these for Christmas and only have the comments from ours to review.  One person froze hers for later and another hadn't tried it because there was so much other food.  Ours sat in the fridge for almost a week because of the same reason.  Despite the fact that it was starting to get dry after days of neglect, it was delish!  I will definitely make it again...and not wait so long to eat it next time!

I really like the taste of this bread; the cranberries, orange and pecan combination.

This is definitely the best Cranberry Bread ever!!!  I made it in small loaf pans, doubled the recipe using 1 whole bag of cranberries and sprinkled "Sugar in the Raw" over the top, and used 1 cup sliced almonds instead of the pecans.  It makes 7 small loaves.  Positively my favorite.  My search for the perfect Cranberry Bread has ended!  Thanks for the fabulous recipe.

Very good. I would add more orange zest to make for a more orangy flavor. I did not add glaze and it was still very moist. I will make this again.

This was wonderful bread!  I cut back on the sugar to 3/4 cup and it was just right - I don't like overly sweet breads - I like to taste the fruit.  Gave as gifts to my friends for Christmas morning and we had two loaves of it for ourselves.

Wonderful recipe. Great flavor and stays nice and moist. I didn't add any glaze. I thought it would make it to sweet, especially at Christmas when there are already plenty of sweets around.

This was delicious!  My husband couldn't stop talking about it.  I made the recipe just as is, and loved it. It's just a little sweet, moist, and with lots of tangy cranberries... perfect. In the future, I might try a simply powdered sugar icing on top once in a while too. Thanks!

Thanks !! This loaf filled the whole house with orange frangance. 'Substituted the cranberries with usual christmas dried fruits like cherries & raisins + walnuts.  Equally good. Just need to cut down the sugar as it was too sweet...but thanks for the recipe - will be sharing with all @ church as christmas gift ! Thanks & God bless !!

I tried this and it was a bit too tart for my liking even using a glaze. I will experiment with it more though, maybe not chopping the cranberry and reducing the amount used.

This smelled sooooo good cooking.  I omitted the nuts (allergies), and reconstituted some craisins.  I thought it was okay, but my kids only tasted the bread.  It's been three days and I still have at least half a loaf left.  This was a good idea.  Thanks.

Yummy! I used 1/2 fresh cranberries and 1/2 dried cranberries. I made a glaze of orange juice and powdered sugar and poured over the top while it was still warm.

So I made this once with dried cranberries and my family really liked it - 5 stars. Today I made it again with fresh cranberries - wow they are tart. Neither of my kids would eat it. I still liked it but I might be the only one.

Good flavor, but mine baked up so crumbly.  I'm not much of a baker so I don't know what I could do to prevent that next time so it's doubtful I'll make this one again.  Oh well, I still appreciated finding a recipe to use up the cranberries I found in the back of the freezer!

I used walnuts in place of pecans and added 2 T. of fresh grated orange zest then baked in mini loft pans.  I gift wrapped the loves and put them in gift baskets everyone raved I've had several request for more.

This is a delicious recipe--great for cranberry lovers. I'm not very experienced at baking breads, but it was pretty much foolproof. I like the way it has lots of cranberry flavor and isn't sugary.

SO GOOD!  Even though there's a lot of orange-flavoring, you can't really pick it out in the taste, it just enhances the cranberry!  Definite keeper!

Although I love sour things, I found the cranberries in this to be too sour.  The rest of the loaf was really good and I plan on making it again but with dried crans that hopefully will not send me into super pucker mode.

Absolutely delicious and a perfect combination of sweetness and tart with the orange and cranberry flavors.  I did halve the cranberries and toss with some sugar, as suggested by others.  A definite make again recipe.

This recipe was very easy to make but I wasn't impressed by it.  The cranberries made it too tart and practically unbearable.  If you're not a big fan of tart things, I suggest you reduce the amount of cranberries.  I won't be making this recipe again :(

This bread has a very good texture, but its kind of bland. And it needed more sugar. Next time I will add an extra 1/2c of sugar and maybe a little bit more orange zest. Maybe some Nutmeg would do it some good.

Delicious bread!!  Recipie is very similar to the one on the bag of cranberries.  I added lots of extra crushed pecans - so much so that people were asking me if there was oatmeal in the batter because the texture was changed so much.  If you love pecans, try it...yummy addition to the Thanksgiving table!

I've been making this recipie for the past 2 years in the fall and winter.  I can't say enough good things about it!  This week alone i've made 3 loaves.  I've given it as gifts.  The only thing that I leave out are the pecans as we are not a fan of nuts in our bread.  In a pinch i've used orange pinapple juice, when i've been out of regular orange juice, and it still comes out amazing.  Thank you Carol for submitting this great recipie.  It will remain in our family for years and years to come.

Easy to make, moist and delicious.  My sister's favorite so I make it often. 
You need to get the fresh cranberries while you can!
