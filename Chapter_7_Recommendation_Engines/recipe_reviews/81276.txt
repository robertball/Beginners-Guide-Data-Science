My mouth watered when I read the recipe but I didn't quite have the right ingredients on hand.  So, I used a fresh cooked chicken breast [I buy bone-in breasts on sale; cook them up; remove the skin and debone them; freeze them in separate sandwich bags and put into one big freezer bag]; Miracle Whip Light, dill pickle relish [easier than cutting up pickles anyway!]and the onion. I didn't have sunflower seeds, but did have a trail mix called "Cranberries and More" that I use for a salad topping.  I just chopped it up a little finer.  It was WONDERFUL!  The second time I added celery and a hard boiled egg and red seedless grapes cut in half.    The third time I added chopped red onion too.  I CRAVE this salad!  It is truly the best chicken salad I've ever eaten!  Thanks TARA!

This is very yummy, though I used halved red grapes instead of the cranberries as it was what I had on hand & diced chicken pieces in place of the canned because I don't like canned meat. I also added chopped celery for extra crunch and a light sprinkle of garlic powder. The filling was delicious stuffed in a pita.

Holy moly, this was great! I didn't have sunflower seeds so used slivered almonds, and I was out of onion. The dried cranberries ARE the secret ingredient...and this is absolutely heavenly on oatnut bread with a couple slices of Swiss cheese. I'm glad I have some more...it's tomorrow's lunch! :)

Thanks, Tara! This is a clean, refreshing chicken salad. I used left over chicken thighs (chopped bite size), a little more mayo (eyeball it to your liking), 1/2 t. dried dill weed, 1/3 c. chopped vidalia onion, 1/3 c. chopped pecans, 1/4 c. chopped celery, and 1/3 c. craisins. I agree this could be the "kitchen sink" or "garbage" chicken salad, but Tara's basics make it incredible! This would go over well at BBQ's and gal pal luncheons! Next time I will try canned chicken (Buy one, get one free) and dill relish. Thanks again.

This was very good but it definately needs more mayo.  I doubled the amount of mayo.  I also used sweet pickles instead of dill and it tasted great!

It's a great way to use leftover chicken.  I served it over a bed of spinach and sprinkled a crunchy almond salad topping on top.

I nabbed this recipe over 2 years ago and i thought I'd say it has officially been added to our rotation.  We like to eat it on a bun with lettuce, or wrapped in a lettuce leaf is pretty delicious, too.  I always make it as is unless I am out of something, then I substitute.  It's delectable either way.  I like it served with cabbage and Jimmy's pineapple cole slaw dressing.

I just love this chicken salad!! It is great on croissants or eaten in a bowl like a salad. A few things I changed because of what I had on hand. Instead of the canned chunk chicken, I just use regular boiled chicken that I chop into pieces. Also, instead of sunflower seeds, I have used browned almond slivers. Don't forget to add some salt and pepper (to taste) since the chicken won't have any seasonings.

Love love loved it! I left out the sunflower seeds and added a touch of dijon mustard, but other than that I followed the recipe.  I served it as a sandwich on toasted bread with lettuce.  My husband raved about it and then couldn't keep from snacking on the leftovers in the fridge.  It's a winner and I'm planning to make it again next week!

This is very tasty! I used sliced almonds instead of sunflower seeds. Toasted the almonds (as well as the cranberries.) I added one more pickle because we like the crunch and taste it adds. Seasoned with salt, pepper, paprika, garlic and onion powders. Delicious!

WOW.....this is THE best chicken salad I've ever had, Tara.  The only thing I changed was I used one of those chicken roasters instead of the canned chicken and used dill weed instead of pickles, as I'm not a huge fan.  Thank you, I will definitely be making this again!!!!

Outstanding recipe!  I didn't have cranberries (though I wish I had!) so I used raisins.  Really light, chunky, and tasty.  Thanks!

Easy recipe...I made this this morning for our lunch and it turned out EXCELLENT! I used some of the advice from other reviewers and I substituted dill pickle and added relish and celery. I also added chopped walnuts to give it an additional crunch.

I did not have sunflower seeds, and used chicken I cooked at home, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was great tasting, but I will add more mayo and the seeds next time. Also thought that canned chicken may make it too salty, so will stick to home cooked. Great recipe that was a little diffrent!

This was fantastic. I'm not a big fan of chunks of onions (weird, I know) so I used a little bit of ground onion seasoning instead and, like another reviewer suggested, added some sliced celery. It turned out -delicious-.

This is pretty good.  I didn't have most the ingredients so this is how I fudged it.  Precooked chicken breast strips (frozen and thawed), mayo, red onion, craisins, and walnuts...oh and salt and pepper.  I put it all in a food processor until the consistency was just right!

Ok this was good on day one but it was fabulous on day three. Please make a day ahead it is better once the flavors have melded. I folllowed recipe exactly and after trying added sliced red grapes and a few extra sunflower seeds. Grapes made it better! And it was so much better on sourdough bread. I had on wheat bread too but I thought sourdough was much better for some reason. I used the canned chicken and was impressed at how good it was. So easy!

This was great! I made it for a picnic, and loved every bite! I used canned chicken for ease, and substituted celery for dill pickle. I added the onion, sunflower seeds and a few extra cranberries. I also upped the amt. of mayo  by 2 T. I used salt, pepper, and paprika. YUMMY! Good mixture of flavors. I cut the onion very small and really enjoyed the flavor (I don't usually like onions) alot.

The only change I made was sweet relish instead of dill pickle(it's what I had).Really different and delish. Made a huge hit at a ladies' lunch! It's now my go-to standard.

Oh dear was this EASY and YUMMY!!! I only made a few alterations-due to what was in the house, and/or a TAD healthier. Boiled 1 chicken breast for 1 hour (easy and keeps it nice and moist) Used Miracle Whip light, sliced almonds, sweet relish, and omitted onions (don't like 'em much) Kept everything else the same! I'm eating it wrapped in lettuce as I type...YUMMY, THANKS TARA!!!!!

I'm giving this 5 stars even though I had to change slightly to suit our taste; it is an excellent recipe. I don't like canned chicken so I boiled mine as usual in a small amount of salted water (I doubled the recipe). It takes quite a bit more mayo. just as other reviewers stated. Since it takes more mayo., to make sure you don't have too much mayo. flavor, add a teaspoon or two of the liquid that the chicken was cooked in. It will moisten and improve the flavor. Excellent.......

This recipe is so easy!  The Craisins give it just a kick of sweetness!  I used chicken breast I grilled, Duke's mayo, dill pickle cubes, celery, green onions, greek seasoning, and seasoning salt!  Delish!

I loved it.  I used the canned chicken and thought there was plenty of mayo. I didn't have pickles, so I used 1 tsp fresh basil and 1 tsp fresh dill, it gave it a great flavor.  The cranberries are a wondrful sweet touch, (I used Craisins).  I will definitely use this recipe again and again, thanks!

I prepared this for a pot luck and the bowl was scraped. I omitted the sunflower seeds and used sweet relish instead of dill and a few red grapes along with the cranberries. It was fabulous and I will use it again often.

My husband loves this chicken salad !!This is the fastest chicken salad recipe I have ever used. I too doubled the mayo but mostly due to omitting the sunflower seeds and adding sliced water chestnuts, drained and chopped. I also doubled the dried cranberries and added 1/8 cup diced celery for a little extra crunch. It was better the next day as the onions had been in it overnight to flavor the salad. I hope this helps.

I had to modify with ingrediants on hand- added 3/4 of chopped apple, skipped the celery, and used pecans instead of sunflower seeds.... still very good!  Oh, and added diced red onion.

This was pretty good and different from the usual chix salad. I used 1 chicken breast, onion powder since I really don't like the raw onion texture and crunch, sweet pickle relish, and toasted slivered almonds since I didn't have sunflower seeds. This had a nice mix of textures with the tender chicken, the chewy craisins,the crisp pickles and the crunchy nuts. Really nice overall. I just wasn't sure about the onion taste, I ate it and it was okay, but maybe the onion and the pickle made it too tunafish salady to me and that is what I wasn't sure about. I'd eat it again, but it didn't make my favorites. Thanks for sharing, I enjoyed making and trying your recipe!

I was looking for a good chicken salad recipe with only a few ingredients that I could make quickly and this hit the spot.  I made a few minor changes.  I used green onion and cherry flavored cranberries because that's what I had and I used dill relish so the only thing I had to chop was the green onion.  Quick, easy, and tasty.

This was excellent chicken salad! The only thing I did different was I used a smoked chicken that my husband did on the smoker and it made the flavor amazing. I did not use onions, cut up some dill pickle spears to taste, and the sunflower seeds and dried cranberries made it delicious. Will do it again for sure!

This recipe was great! I was looking for a light chicken salad that was Weight Watchers appropriate and delicious and this fit the bill perfectly! I used light mayo and cranraisins instead of cranberries, but I don't think it made a bit of a difference.

Just made this chicken salad in 5 minutes. I absolutely love it! I doubled the mayo because I thought that it needed more, and cut the onions in half because I'm not a huge onion fan. I added green seedless grapes (what I had) and a sprinkle of garlic powder. Perfect! Will be making this again. The dried cranberries really do make it awesome!

This was very good.  I boiled chicken tenders and chopped it.  I added chopped celery, some dill and white pepper.  I used dry roasted sunflower seeds as that is what I had in my pantry.  This was so good, but even better on day two.  I served on croissants.  I will definitely use this one again!  Thanks for the great recipe.

I loved the addition of sunflower seeds.  It added a nice crunch and a touch of salty to go with the sweet.  I didn't use canned chicken, just leftover cooked chicken which tastes better.  Next time I might use grapes instead of the dried cranberries.

This recipe was good.  I made some changes.  For the onions I added onion powder since I don't like raw onions and left out the flower seeds.  Still came out great.  When cooked the chicken breast I added chicken bouillon for flavor and added ground black pepper to salad for taste.

Best chicken salad I've ever had! I did use more mayo than it called for, and I used almond slices as well as sunflower seeds, the relish really gives it a great flavor without being too overwhelming. I will make this over and over again.

The addition of dried cranberries to chicken salad has always been a favorite of mine.  So what really attracted me to this recipe was not the recipe itself but the suggestion of the recipe poster to spread cream cheese on the bread and then top with the chicken salad.  It adds a delicious layer of taste and texture and it's a tip I'll use again...  but my taste preference is to only use canned chicken in a pinch...

This is awesome!!  I just made it after breakfast so we can have it for lunch.  The cranberries make it sweet enough for my kids to like.  I also like how versatile (sp?)(I cook better than I spell!) it is.  I also used b/s chicken breast and sub'ed sliced almonds for the sunflower seeds.  It's just what I had.  I will be making this over and over trying new nut and veggie combos; celery, walnuts, grapes.  The cranberries and pickles will be a must me for me though!!!  GREAT RECIPE!

This is one of my fav's....I make a HUGE batch of it for bridal and baby showers. Serve with Croissants on the side as another variety. It's always a hit and always gets compliments.

This recipe is great but I changed a couple of things. I added more mayo, no onions (because I'm allergic), used a whole rotisserie chicken bought at your local food market and de-boned it.  I used the celery, hard boiled eggs, dill relish, sunflower seeds, cranberries and grapes (cut into halves).  Because I like sweet foods I added a bed of already prepared lettuce with carrots and some light rasberry vinegarette dressing.  If you like sweet foods such as myself,  you'll love this tasty sweet chicken salad- salad. 
Thanks Tara for this tasty recipe. My family loves it.

made this with left over roaster chicken, added more mayo than the recipe calls for and used chopped sweet pickles.I too was reluctant to combine cranberries with pickles but thought the flavor was quite good.  Will take suggestion from another reviewer and add halved grapes next time.

My husband and I were not a big fan of this recipe. It lacked any flavor other than the occasional cranberry. Wouldn't make it again.

I made this for a spur of the moment luncheon and not only was it so easy but it was mouth watering.  I only had green onions but it didn't detract from the flavor, it only enhanced it.  i used the garlic dill pickles and still only added to the already tantalizing flavors.  I will make this again.

I think this would be a four star recipe if didn't call for canned chicken. I was going to cook a chicken breast to use, but decided to follow the recipe because it was much quicker using the canned stuff. Maybe it's just me, but I think canned chicken tastes SO much different from freshly cooked. I did use dill relish instead just to save a step. I found myself looking forward to biting into a cranberry when I was eating! :)

I was looking for a healthier version of a chicken salad and thought this would be perfect.  I made exactly as the recipe stated and although it wasn't terrible...it wasn't incredible either.  It was defintely missing something, which I think was salt and pepper and maybe a  more mayo to help hold it together a little better.  I will try this again but will try a variation to give more flavor.

I was reluctant to combine cranberries with dill pickles... seemed odd.  But this is a GREAT variation on chicken salad.  And the first All Recipes recipe that I will submit a photo for!  Thanks Tara!

Excellent 'starter' recipe - I have turned it into "kitchen sink chicken salad" adding chopped grapes & celery, topping with sliced boiled eggs.  I made it for company, served with fresh garlicy bread, and no one had fewer than 2 sandwiches!  I always double it because it does keep pretty well for about 48 hours.  
Thanks!

Hubby doesn't usually like fruit in his mayo-based salads, but he ate this up! Thanks - I didn't have to make ANY tweaks or changes to the recipe, other than using boiled & shredded chicken breast meat.

This was a good chicken salad, love the addition of the dill pickle, of which I was afraid.  I also used a couple of poached chicken breasts diced up and it was very tasty.  Thanks.
