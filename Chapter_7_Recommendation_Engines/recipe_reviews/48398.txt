My dinner guests and I like this recipe very much as our entree because I didn't realize it was for an appetizer.  I added a pound of lump crabmeat and it was great.  Will make again.

I used a different recipe for the crab cakes (old standby that I've had for years), but the curried yogurt sauce was to  die for.  Very good.  I am thinking of other ways to use it.  On a cold salmon sandwich or salad.  As the base for a curry chicken salad with some added crunch (almonds or cashews), raisins and celery.  I will use this again and again.  It got rave reviews from my dinner guests.

These were just okay for me.  I used 8 oz. of crabmeat and only one cup of the crackers and there was still just too much breading for me.  Next time I will try doubling the crabmeat.  Didn't really care for the sauce.  My husband and teenage daughter ate it though.  Better than store bought but not great.  Will play with it a little more next time.  Thanks

So I can't speak for the crab cakes (we buy ones already made from our store) but the sauce is excellent.  We make this probably once a month to top our crab cakes and it is delicious.

Didn't bother with the crab cakes.  Just wanted to the curry sauce recipe.  Sauce was super easy to make and very, very good.

I am reviewing the sauce portion of this recipe only, I chose to use another crab cake recipe.  Absolutely loved this sauce on crab cakes, it's slightly sweet and fruity from the mango chutney, and the amount of curry is perfect.  I prepared exactly as written.  Make well ahead of serving time to chill this and let the flavors meld.  I think this would also make a very interesting dressing for a salad.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR, very good!

Love this recipe! The crab cakes are delicious and the curry yogurt dip is to die for. I made a few substitutions. Used fresh crab meat. Substituted sour cream for mayo, substituted  ground red pepper for ground ancho chile pepper, substituted red pepper flakes for jalapeno pepper, substituted regular mustard for spicy brown mustard. I made my own Old Bay seasoning.

Made this dish for my parents who loved it. My mom made for a dinner party and people were asking for the recipe. Definitely recommended. Will make again and again. A tad rich and quite a strong on curry flavor, just fyi.

I have to confess on two occasions I have only made the yogurt curry sauce and bought good quality crab cakes from the seafood store. However, both times my guests came away raving about the curry sauce and asking for the recipe. I serve the individual crab cake with curry sauce over a few mixed greens.  A great starter.

These are delicious! Unlike most of the reviewers I made only the crab cakes not the sauce. Even those in my family who do not like crab cakes loved these!.
