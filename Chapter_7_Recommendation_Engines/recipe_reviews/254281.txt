OMG.  Soooo good.  Chef John never disappoints and this is no exception.  I followed the recipe to a T and there is no need to make any adjustments.  When I first read the recipe, I thought that 1 cup of asparagus would not be enough, but it is.  Sure, you could add more, but 1 cup is fine.  Be sure to slice it thinly!  As Chef John says in the video, just about anything would work here.  I can see broccoli, diced or crumbled sausage, diced ham......just about anything.  With two of us who were quite hungry, there were a couple of slices left over.  According to hubby, it was great the next day cold!  Don't miss this one.  It's really, really good and very easy.

This egg dish is amazing.  The consistency is perfect. I even added an extra egg, changed to broccoli, added mushrooms and shallots. the basic egg mixture is perfect. Try it

This was great! The only change I made was to add some finely chopped green onions that I needed to use up, maybe a quarter cup. Those went in with the asparagus.  Definitely will make it again. Thanks Chef John!

Just made this and it came out great.  I had to improvise a little because I don't have an iron pan - so I just used a regular baking dish, put the asparagus & bacon mix  in first and then poured the batter.   I was quite surprised how light in texture this was. I expected it to come out a lot denser.  And as for the flavor... can you ever go wrong with bacon & cheese?  Husband loved it as well and said it's definitely a do-again.

Had this for brunch, yum!  Only thing I added was a little diced red pepper.  Savory, everyone liked it.

Pretty good, but we all thought that the lemon zest gave it an off-taste. Will leave that out next time.

Delicious.  I was a little nervous since he recommends a 12" frying pan, and mine is only 10" and slopes in from that, but it all stayed in the pan!  I might bake it a little longer next time.  It definitely poufed but did not have air pockets like in his video.

This was pretty tasty. I left out the bacon so it would be vegetarian and found it plenty pleasing, anyway.

Really, really easy and very, very good!! The only thing I did differently is to add chopped green onion with the asparagus. The variations to this recipe could be many ham, sausage and different veggies. A great dish for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner. Thanks Chef John for another winner!!

I used frozen peas instead of green asparagus.    All else remained the same.  It was delicious but I used the wrong pan ... I used a casserole pot.   Next time I try Teflon skillet in order to prevent sticking. I will definitely make it again.

I made no changes...but my husband and I both loved it. My husband would like me to make it with jalapenos  on his side next time...but he loved it! Wait, I did leave out the lemon on this one just because I didn't have it. Can't wait to try out different variations with this. Thanks Chef John!

Even though I overlooked the "bacon in pieces" part, this was very successful, so I'll make it again, with fruit for breakfast or a salad for supper.  And I'll cut up the bacon!

I used thick cut bacon and it may have actually been a little too much bacon.  (blasphemous, I know!)

I would cut back on added salt if using very salty bacon.  Otherwise everyone loved it!  So easy to make!
