This produced a really fresh tasting sauce, which I definitely appreciate! I added fresh garlic and mushrooms (sauteed in a bit of olive oil) to the sauce just because those are 2 things that are vital to spaghetti sauce in this house! The sauce was very simple, but *really* tasty. The only thing I had a problem with were the meatballs... I think next time I will cut the seasoning in half as the italian seasoning was overwhelming; it kinda ruined the flavor of the meatballs for me. That being said, the meatballs had the BEST texture and consistency. Thank you very much, CookingDiva!

First let me say this is a fab website for beginner cooks, I'm new to this site and I've only taken a real interest in cooking for my family 3 years ago when I started staying home full time. Anyway,back to the meatballs not only was it an easy recipe to follow,but the meatballs were really good. You would think my 14 year old was NYC food critic with the way he comments about my food,but he told my husband that he liked these so much he was speechless for once. Great recipe I'm becoming more confident with every meal I cook because if this website.

This was really good! The sauce was very light and enjoyable. I used the ground chicken in the meatballs and they were fantastic! I did bake them on 350 for about 20 minutes, per the suggestion of another reviewer. I prefer this to browning them in a skillet because it's easier. =) The chicken made such nice meatballs. They were very filling and much better than beef meatballs! 

The only change I have made (after making this several times, it's such a hit!) was adding sauteed onion, green pepper, and garlic, and putting more seasoning in the sauce. A+!

Absolutely fantastic!  I am no a cook nor into cooking - just want to make healthy meals my family will eat. I only made the meatballs and used ground turkey rather than chicken simply because that's what I had on hand.  I also used Extra Virgin Olive Oil rather than cooking spray in the skillet, works just as well.  It was so very easy.  I will use this recipe from now on!  Thanks!

Yum!....Love using extra lean ground chicken instead of beef. A few mini changes....I only used 1 lb of ground chicken and I added 2 large cloves of garlic finely minced to the meatball mixture and added pecorino romano cheese and whole wheat Italian style bread crumbs in addition to the egg and seasonings. I also baked my meatballs instead of pan frying which saves fat and calories. Added some dry red wine to the sauce as well. Nice dinner...thanks!

Meatball portion of recipe was great. Sauce needs a lot of other ingredients including onions, garlic, peppers (any colour), oregano and I like mushrooms in my sauce too. I usually add a pinch of brown sugar too...removes the acid from the tomatoes.

I loved this recipe. My husband is Italian but gets really bad heartburn from red sauces so he was reluctant to eat this at first, but it didn't give him any heartburn (I did add about 1/4 milk and 1 tbsp. sugar to lessen the acidity).  Even my sister who hates pasta and Italian food is asking me on a regular basis to invite her oven again for this dish!  The chicken meatballs are amazing...it's like chicken parmesan but in meatball form...so yummy!  I prefer this over beef meatballs any day!

I'm torn with this recipe.  The meatballs are excellent!  I'm starting to cook more with ground chicken and I'm really liking it.  Unfortunately, the sauce brings this recipe down.  Even with all of the basil, it still tastes like plain tomato sauce from a can.  By the time I finished doctoring it up, it beared no resemblance to the recipe.

I use ground turkey and up the italian seasonings, garlic, and parm cheese. A high quality parmesan is a must. I test fry a mini meatball before cooking and add seasoning accordingly before shaping the balls. I bake in a 375 oven for about 30 minutes, easier than panfrying. The sauce recipe is great too, although i tweak it. I saute some onions and garlic in basil olive oil before adding canned tomatoes ( i usually buy the garlic and oregano seasoned, the more flavor the better!) and add more seasoning (I use a spicy italian herb grinder) and red pepper flakes (we like it spicy!). I let it simmer for a long time (an hour or so) to let the flavors meld. So good, we make this about once a week, and any leftovers are even better the next day!

Inspired by CookingDiva Kim's fun espisode of What's Cooking on Allrecipes tv, I made this for my family last night--rave reviews & clean plates from kids & adults alike! I had no idea that meatballs were that easy to make--and I loved using ground Chicken is a healthier alternative to beef or sausage. My only modification is that I cut the Italian seasoning to 1 Tbs (but Kim is RIGHT, Chicken needs more spices than sausage would) and added some fresh minced garlic and about 1/2 Tsp of sea salt to the meatball mixture. Also, I highly recommend looking for San Marzano canned tomatoes & paste when you make this. San Marzano canned tomatoes have a bright flavor gives the sauce a vine-ripened taste out of the can. Try them, and you'll never go back to regular tomatoes for your spaghetti and pizza sauces.  Great recipe--thanks CookingDiva!

I made the meatballs exactly as the recipe is written and used good sauce that I already had.  We made toasted chicken meatballs subs with melted mozzarella cheese.  Loved it.  Will definitely make again.

The grocery store that I went to didn't have any ground chicken, so I got ground turkey. Turned out great! I didn't throw all the meatballs into my sauce, only what I wanted to eat and froze the rest for future use. I also baked my meatballs because it was less mess and less time consuming.

The meatballs, themselves, deserve 5 stars, but the sauce was bland.  I sauteed onions, mushrooms, and garlic to add, but it was missing some spices.  I was hoping cooking the meatballs in the sauce would be enough to add some flavor, but it wasn't.  Next time, I will up the spice in the sauce, maybe add a touch of brown sugar, wine, Italian seasoning, more garlic, etc.  I will make this recipe again, though...the meatballs were great.

We'd give the meatballs a 4.  The only change was that I added a dash of garlic powder.  We'd give the sauce a 3.  It was a little too watery for us, and I only used 2 cups of water.  I added 3  garlic cloves that I browned in olive oil and I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned.

I followed the recipe as closely as I could w what I had at home.  I had to use 1 lb of turkey and alb of lean ground beef.  My diced tomatoes were chili spiced.  My husband and son loved it!  This is a keeper!  Thanks!

I thought that it was very good the only trouble I had was finding ground chicken at my grocery store. Intead I used ground turkey which was surprisingly good and no one noticed the difference in the sauce but I would like to try it with the chicken.

Used this just for the meatball recipe, which I cut in half and simmered in pre-made pasta sauce.  These were great meatballs!

Absolutly Beautiful. I loved the chicken for a change, intead of beef. It was full of Flavour and the Husband loved it also, and he's very fussy. I  also added a half a teaspoon of chilli powder to the meatball mix just to give it that little spicy kick.

This is a great recipe as is! I'm always looking for healthy low fat versions of our favorite recipes and this is a winner.  My daughter is very picky but absolutely loves these meatballs.  She also loved helping me measure and mix the ingredients.  It's a very kid friendly and yummy recipe.

I love these chicken meatballs.  My family actually likes these better than meatballs made with ground beef.  I make the recipe exactly as written for the meatballs (I make my own sauce).

I made the chicken meatballs for the first time 10-12-13 and they were so delicious!  They had such a different taste than beef meatballs.  I had my own sauce but will make the entire recipe next time.  Definitely a keeper!

Very moist and delicious. I made a few changes. I 1/2 the recipe & baked it for 10 min then let them simmer in a jar of Barrilla Marinara for 20 min. Next time I'll cut back on Italian seasoning & add garlic

Great recipe! My 11 month old loved it. The only thing I would do different is add more flavor to the sauce. I added garlic salt and some onion powder.

Wow!! Who knew I could make meatballs?? I used pre-seasoned panko instead of bread crumbs and skipped the parmesan cheese, and they turned out great. The only tricky part was browning the meatballs because I couldn't figure out how to brown them "on all sides". I ended up squashing them a little bit in order to keep turning them and ended up with little 3-D hexagons. That part was tricky but they really ended up delicious. Used sauce from a jar and whole-wheat spaghetti. What a great recipe, perfect even for someone who has no clue what they're doing.

I cheated and used 2 jars of sauce to save time after work. These meatballs are so simple, but so delicious. I have made them three times now and each time my husband and I talk about how good they are during the entire meal. I can't get enough of them :)

I only made the meatballs and my picky daughter actually ate every last bite!!! I was in a rush so just used a pre-made pasta sauce and added a can of diced italian tomatoes.  My husband enjoyed it as well... I will definitely make them again.

The meatball part of the recipe was great (although I used ground Italian turkey instead of chicken)... I make a similar sauce that I've perfected over time, and will likely continue to use in the future, but this sauce was pretty good too. For a thicker sauce try adding a little less water or more tomato sauce. Also I hadn't tried using whole-wheat pasta before and actually really enjoyed it (not to mention the health benefits).

My rating is also just for the meatballs...I have my own sauce recipe. I followed the meatball recipe just as written...first let me say this makes alot of meatballs, you may want to cut the recipe in half for less than four people. I did bake mine in the oven for twenty minutes at 350, easier and healthier. You can find ground chicken at Walmarts. I topped the spaghetti with fresh parmesean cheese and clilantro. The whole family raved about this...and they knew it was chicken and not red meatballs.

I just made the meatballs, since I had homemade sauce in the freezer, and they were delicious!  Tender, flavorful, juicy.  I did use turkey instead of chicken, and a little less Italian seasoning than the recipe called for, plus I added a little onion and garlic powder.  They are very tasty!  Will make it again!

Great recipe!  I made turkey meatballs because I couldn't find chicken, I added more seasoning to the meatballs and sauce, and I added onions and garlic to the sauce.  Made it even better!

6/1/2010 we all liked it. i used ground turkey, 1 lb so i halved the meatball part of it.  I kept the sauce the same except i didn't have 3 cans of paste.  I used 1 can and 3/4 cup of water. Also fresh parsley and basil, garlic powder and celery salt. a little acidic so i added some brown sugar, still acidic so i added a little half and half, that helped alot.  Also, i baked the meatballs at 350 for half hour and then put into sauce on low for 1 1/2 hours.  tasty.
6/11 this time i put a little mozz cheese in the middle of the meatballs, matthew really liked it.

I used super lean ground turkey for my meatballs. I would try to use chicken if i made this again. I would also cut the tomato paste down to 1 or 2 cans at the most. Very low cal compared to my homemade meatballs.

I've tried making sauce before and they all turned out terribly.  I followed the directions for this sauce and then added maybe a tablespoon of sugar at the end, it was fantastic!!  My husband loved the meatballs too.  I don't think he even knew they were made from turkey instead of beef!!  Thanks for the recipe!

I think this dish was pretty mediocre. Then again, I rushed the dish a bit and didn't let the meatballs sit in the sauce very long. I'll try again some other time when I'm not trying to cook as quickly as possible due to extreme hunger.

I only used 1 T of the Italian seasoning for the meatballs, and added a bit of oregano to the sauce.  The meatballs were great, next time I may double the sauce and use for meatball subs.  Thank you for the recipe :)

Mmmm really good; I used ground turkey instead of chicken and cut the seasoning back a bit.  I always roll my meatballs and then bake them on a baking sheet before adding them to the sauce.  350 oven for about 25 min.   I used regular instead of whole wheat spaghetti; everyone really liked this spaghetti dinner.  I didn't tell them it was turkey either!

This recipe proves that you can have healthy and tasty at the same time. I ground my own chicken for the meatballs and froze half of them for later use.

These meatballs were delicious!  Of course I tweaked the recipe a little only because I've made chicken meatballs before, and I know they can be bland.  I used seasoned bread crumbs but stilled used the full amount of Italian seasoning.  I added a little fennel powder/onion powder/ground sage. I also added some crushed garlic.  I just used a jarred sauce to which I added some mushrooms which I sauteed in the fry pan after frying the meatballs.  I usually bake my meatballs, but I fried them this time in some olive oil and canola oil. Oh...I also heated up the sauce with the leftover rind of some   Parmigiana Reggiano cheese which I had in the freezer. I rarely use a recipe exactly as it is displayed...unless I'm baking a cake or something like that. This is a keeper!

I am reviewing only the meatballs, as I used my own sauce recipe.  These chicken meatballs were delicious!  Perfect texture, quite flavorful (I doubled the cheese and used freshly grated Romano), and incredibly easy.  And so much healthier than using beef.  A keeper!

The pasta sauce had too strong of a tomato taste for me.  If I make this recipe again I’ll use just one can of tomato paste instead of three.  I’ll also start off with fresh diced onion sautéed in a bit of olive oil before putting the  tomatoes in the pot.   I’d also most likely used some parsley as well as the basil to offset the tomato flavor.

The meatballs were great and I liked the ingredients  just as they are given.  I didn't have the ingredients for the sauce, so I had to use a jar sauce.  It was good this way too, but next time I will try to make the sauce from scratch.

I love these meatballs hot or cold, alone or with pasta or bread. They don't make me think I'm eating chicken, just a tasty meatball. The kids really enjoy them so I make a lot for the kids to grab anytime.

Loved the meatballs, but I prefer another sauce recipe over this one.  Great weeknight meal!  I baked the meatballs at 375 for 15 - 20 minutes instead of frying in skillet.  Will make again.

Beyond bland.  I hadn't realized until after I cooked it that there's barely any seasoning.  The texture reminds me of canned tomato sauce, not even jarred. As to the meatballs, they were very good except that they were dry.  They needed to be covered with at least a little sauce and since the sauce I made them with was gross, the meatballs weren't as good as they should have been.  I gave the recipe 2 stars because I fully intend on making the meatballs again with a different sauce. The meatballs alone deserve a 3.5 star rating.  My kids though did not like them as much as I did.  My kids tend to like simple taste combinations and this recipe had too much italian seasoning for THEIR tastes.  As an adult, I thought it was a good combo.

My daughter and I really enjoyed this recipe. I did take the suggestion of one user and used San Marzano Tomato Sauce and it really was delicious! This will definitely go in my family dinner file and be used quite often!

I loved this recipe! Easy prep and the family enjoyed it so much that second helpings were a must. I did substitute turkey for the chicken and used dried oats instead of bread crumbs to increase the fiber. I am sharing with all of my cooking buddies....

This rating is only for the meatballs as I didn't make the sauce. The meatballs are delicious! I have found great recipes for turkey meatballs, but I have a hard time finding ground turkey, so this recipe is great. Great flavour.

This recipe was very bland.  My boyfriend enjoyed it.  Will probably make again on the strength of him, but will use a lot more seasonings.

first of all, I just want to say sorry that I somewhat changed the recipe because I didn't have enough ground chicken breast to make meatballs, and I had originally set out to make spaghetti and meat sauce.  I followed the recipe ingredients for the sauce, first frying the chicken, then adding tomatoes and tomato paste and water.  added spices, some celery salt and garlic powder, oregano and basil, pretty much the same as I make my own sauce but also added 1 tablespoon of vinegar and a little brown sugar to cut the strong tomato flavour a little. Let it simmer and dinner was ready within an hour!  My sons loved it, even my picky 5 year old!!  Now that I have found this recipe, (added to my favorites) I will make the chicken meatballs next time...they sound really yummy!

Great recipe! All who ate it loved it. I thought the sauce could have used more diced tomatoes. Also I couldn't find chicken so I used turkey. And I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and some Tomato Pesto seasoning instead of the Italian seasoning. Next time I'll use more diced tomatoes. A keeper and will definitely make this one again!

This dish was terrific.  My 3yr old daughter had the best time making the meatballs (we used ground turkey).  And the bonus was she loved the food.

I had sauce already prepared, so I only used the meatball portion of this recipe, and it was excellent! I used Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs, and ground turkey instead of ground chicken. They turned out really well and everyone loved them!
