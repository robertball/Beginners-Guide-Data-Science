Excellent and enjoyed by all. Instead of chopping chilies and adding a can of tomatoes, I added a can of Rotele (tomatoes with chilies)

Tasty!  I used spicy sausages,  1 large can of diced tomatoes, 3 Tbs tomato paste. I added more chilli flakes,  2 carrots and 2 sticks celery diced as per cook's notes. Next time I would double lentils, possibly double black beans, add more veg possibly including chopped Kale.  Thank you!

Ill make it again but I’ll leave out the chicken sausage....didn’t care for how it was textured.
The flavor of the stew was delicious!
