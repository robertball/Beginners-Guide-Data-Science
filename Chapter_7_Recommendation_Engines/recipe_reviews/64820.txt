This was a pretty good soup.  I used dry garbanzos so I quick-soaked them (boiled for a couple minutes and let sit a couple hours in the hot water).  They were still not quite tender enough, but the soup's flavors were good.  It needed more water than called for so I also added some vegetable base to give it more flavor (boullion "paste" I use from a jar).  I also added celery.
UPDATE: I discovered later that dried garbanzos require soaking time (overnight or the quick-soak method I mentioned above), plus up to an hour and a half of cooking time!  In the soup they probably only got 30-45 minutes, so that explained their hardness.  I'll save time next time by using canned, or plan ahead more!

Excellent!  I did use chicken broth instead of water and substituted the carrots with Ukrainian sausage.  I substituted the red pepper flakes with cayenne pepper.  Yum!

I reworked the recipe. Decided that two cans of tomatoes was too much. I also didn't want to use the rice and used onion instead. The response I got from my family was that it was better than they thought it would be. But, I wish the garbanzos had absorbed more of the spices. My guess is this recipe would be better served one or two days later.  1 onion or 1-1/2 cups, chopped 4 cloves garlic, minced 1 (14.5) oz. can Del Monte tomatoes with basil, garlic & oregano (no salt added),   pulsed lightly in the food processor 2 cups broth (I used pan drippings/broth left over broth from baking cornish hens the night before) 1/4 cup celery, finely diced 1/4 cup carrot, finely diced 2 tablespoons green pepper, finely diced 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon chili powder 1/2 teaspoon red pepper 1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste 1/2 teaspoon black pepper or to taste 1 (15 oz.) can garbanzo beans  Saute onion in oil in skillet until onion begins to brown. Add garlic, cook and stir until lightly browned. Transfer to a stew pot and add tomatoes, broth, celery, carrot, green pepper, seasonings and garbanzo beans. Simmer on low heat for about 30 minutes or until carrot is tender.

This was okay, but nothing more. I liked the thickness of it, almost like stew, but there was something missing in the flavor mixture. If I were to make it again (which I won't), I'd use much less crushed red pepper. It left an afterburn in my mouth that I still felt 30 minutes later.

This had a nice flavor. I used black beans, instead of garbanzos to give a more mexican flavor. Leftover thickened up real good and were used as a burrito filling. Thank you for sharing.

I had to add 2 cups of water with the beans because all of the liquid was gone.  Almost too spicy that night but nearly perfect the next day for lunch.

I read the reviews before I made this, so I sauteed some onion and garlic in olive oil and added some celery seed (don't have celery at the moment).  This helped a bit with the flavor but I still thought it could use a bit more.  However, I didn't use nearly as much pepper as called for--I can't handle that much red and black pepper!  I didn't use 2 cans of tomatoes; instead, I  subbed the water for chicken broth and added 2 more cups of liquid.  I don't have just carrots so I used a veggie mix I have in the freezer.  Turned out well enough, but it definitely would have been very tomatoe-y and thick if I'd followed the recipe as written.  I like thick soups, but it would have been too thck for me so I'm glad I added the extra broth.  thanks for the recipe.

Excellent vegetarian meal.  I used diced mushrooms instead of carrots and used brown rice (cooked it first) and added a sauteed shallot.  I also used chicken broth instead of water.  Nice spicy kick - will share this recipe with others!

I like it, but it would've been better with a little less tomato in it.  I used chicken stock instead of water.  Overall - it was good for a cold day!  I liked the rice in it!

Very easy. I would add a few things though: 2 cloves of garlic, chopped; 1 small onion, chopped; and 1 stick of celery, chopped. Maybe a small pepper too, like an anaheim or jalapeno, chopped. Cook the veggies in 2 T. of oil, then add the tomatoes, beans, rice, and water. I ran out of chili powder, but used curry instead. It was great. Also, you are going to need more water, up to 2 cups, using a reducing technique.

I added black beans to the recipe and also a can of chicken broth to help the soup be thinner.  I also used brown rice which was pre cooked and once it was almost all the way cooked I added it to the soup mixture.  This way it absorbed some of the tomato flavor.  

The overall flavor was not significant so next time I would saute a half an onion, the carrots and some celery until soft and then add some garlic. Then add the tomato and chicken broth and also some tomato paste to help with the consistency.

Yum! This was a very tomato-y soup. By cutting out the pepper flakes and chili powder, and adding ground dried garlic I made a soup the whole family loved. The kids didn't even mind the cumin. The only mistake I made was to add chicken bullion per other reviewers comments, only I added twice what I should have.  It was too salty even without salt (I thankfully forgot to add it). All in all a quick and tasty soup for my tomato and garbanzo loving family.

Without modification this recipe would not deserve 4 stars. Followed the suggestion to use one can of tomatoes. I added 4 cups water, with chicken bouillon. Brown rice. Cooked chicken. Garlic. Onion. This recipe consisted of just about everything from a shelf so I decided it would make a great food storage recipe so I used only dehydrated onion, carrot. I increased all the spice, we like extra spicy. My family thought this was a hit! Served with tortilla chips.

Great hearty low-cal soup. I make a pot and then eat it for lunch every day. It's thick and filling, yet only 200 calories for a big bowl.  It is super spicy, so watch out! You can tone down the spices if you need to. I make it with whole grain brown rice for a little extra fiber, but otherwise I didn't change a thing.

This was a really filling soup!  I like my soups a little more "soupy" so I just used 1 carrot, 1/2 can of garbanzo beans and instead of all the rice while it was cooking, I added a handful of minute rice at the end.  One more change I made was before I added the rice and garbanzos, I used my hand blender to make it mostly smooth, while still leaving some tomato chunks for texture.  Next time I might add a little sugar to even out the flavor a bit.

I make this recipe a few times a year and love it.  I often double the recipe  for a quick and easy dinner during busy weeks.  I love spicy food, so I'll often add an additional quarter teaspoon of chili powder, which does the trick for me.  This is one of my go-to recipes for easy, inexpensive yet filling and flavorful meals.

This is NOT soup.  I added an extra cup of water to it and it still wasn't soupy--I wouldn't even call it stew!  The overwhelming taste of tomatoes ruined the flavor and it left a bitter taste in my mouth for an hour after I ate it.  It IS cheap and quick, however.
