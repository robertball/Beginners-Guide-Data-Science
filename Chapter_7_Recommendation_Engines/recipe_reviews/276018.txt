I didn't let not having an air-fryer deter me from trying this recipe. I used chicken thighs instead of drumsticks. It's truly a delicious recipe. I definitely will make again! Maybe I'll get an air-fryer in the new year - I hear they're great! :-)

Perfect as written. This recipe is perfect and the leftover Crema makes a great salad dressing. 5 stars all the way!

One of the best chicken dishes we ever made.  Followed the recipe exactly, found that it does take the full 20 minutes cook time.   It made too much sauce, but it was so good, I'm thrilled to be able to use it as salad dressing for the next few days.

Great recipe but I made some changes. These changes are for 4 pounds of wings. I doubled the oregano, halved the salt, added a smashed large garlic bulb, added the same amount of chipotle and cayenne powders as the smoked paprika. I also marinated the wings for about an hour. I made the crema ahead of time so the flavors could meld. I added a lot to the sauce. I added a teaspoon each: oregano, garlic, chipotle, cayenne, onion; a whole avocado and red pepper, leaving out the jalepeno. I didn't have one. I added a tablespoon of olive oil and 1/4 cup grated red onion. It came out great! A keeper in my home.
