Oh, this is SO good!  My drink doesn't look anything like the picture (too much pulp in the orange juice, I guess), but it tastes delicious!

I wasn't expecting to like this as much as I did.  It was easy, very smooth, sweet (but not too sweet), and "pretty" served in a glass (though I must have not used enough grenadine as mine was not as red as the picture...more coral-colored).  I used this for our "Southern-themed Supper Club" and it was a hit.  I will definitely make this again!

Perfect for making in bulk for entertaining :)  Not to sweet that even the guys love it, plus it's got "slammer" in the name ...

My husband likes to have an Alabama Slammer as a shot but wasn't crazy about this one so we won't make this again. It's more of a personal preference. We still had fun trying something new though and it did do its job. :)

We offered this as one of the signature drinks at our daughter's baptism reception (Baby Bama Slammers), and they were a real hit.  I couldn't believe how many people commented on how great they were (even a LOT of men switched to drinking these).  The bartenders had to make several batches throughout the night.  We added a little pineapple juice to sweeten it up a little.

Excellant recipe. Wouldn't change a thing.
