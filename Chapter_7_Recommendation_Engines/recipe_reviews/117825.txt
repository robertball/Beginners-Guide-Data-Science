I chose this recipe not only because I had in mind something with lemon and rosemary, but also because I liked the roasting temperature of 375 degrees, sort of midway between the low and high heat roasting methods.  I couldn't have asked for a more perfectly cooked, perfectly flavored roasted chicken.  With slight modifications I followed the recipe closely.  To help with browning and to create juices for a pan gravy, I rubbed the chicken, inside and out and under the skin with butter before seasoning.  Rather than using the individual herbs and spices I simply used "Chicken Seasoning Blend," recipe also from this site. (Good stuff to have on hand, by the way)  I had a 4-pound chicken that was perfectly roasted in an hour and a half.  What a beauty that bird was when I pulled it out of the oven!  The meat was tender and juicy, subtley infused with the rosemary and lemon - really great flavor.  I served this with "Herbed Lemon Orzo" and "Bertolli Classico Asparagus Saute," both also AR recipes.  I wouldn't hesitate to use this recipe again. I know it will be consistently dependable.

This is the best roasted chicken I've ever had, and I'm not usually a huge fan of roasted chicken. I couldn't stop picking at it before dinner-time! The leftovers are delicious warmed up over salad greens.

Tasted great, loved the lemon!  Followed recipe- except - I like to slow cook whole chickens at 250 degrees for 5 hours.

Being that we were going to be way too busy doing last minute errands and packing up the car tonight, I decided to make this chicken this afternoon. Big mistake! I couldn't stop nibbling on it! I normally stay clear of the skin, but again, it was too darn good to pass up. I used a whole lemon and the flavor, even on the skin was amazing! The lemon didn't overwhelm the gravy, just gave it a subtle flavor. Can't wait to do this with regular chicken pieces. Thanks so much Margaret!!

Absolutely delicious. I wanted to keep the chicken from scorching on the bottom so I layered one small onion in the bottom of the pan, then laid the chicken over the top. I did add a little liquid, a good couple splashes of white wine. I didn't measure the spices, I was quite liberal with them. The chicken was wonderful. There's only a small amount leftover for chicken sandwiches for lunches today.

I really enjoyed this recipe, extremely simple to execute and it makes your house smell amazing when it cooks! The combo of the lemon, rosemary and thyme is perfect.  I had a small fryer (almost 3 lbs) and it cooked in about an hour and 20 minutes, then let it rest for 15 min before slicing up.  Hubs enjoyed it too, even if he isn't that fond of rosemary :) Served with garlic roasted mini red potatoes, steamed asparagus and a cucumber/radish salad (AR-Easy Cucumber Salad).  I will most definitely make this again, there is enough meat left over for me to make a couple servings of soup now that the cooler temps are here. Great recipe, thanks!

You can always get a good deal on whole fryers at the market and this recipe is a simple and delicious way to prepare them. I followed the recipe exactly and cook the chicken for 20 minutes per pound. You can use more or less lemon to suit your tastes. We use the bones and scraps to make homemade chicken noodle soup the next day.

This was delicious! I used chili powder because I didn't have seasoned salt and it was still wonderful. The amount of lemon was perfect and wasn't overpowering, but added a good tang. No leftovers here!

This was fantastic!  My whole family loved it.  I used the meat and bones to make homemade chicken soup with homemade stock, and the rosemary/lemon flavor was even evident in the soup.  Mmmm!

The whole family loved this!  I loved the lemon flavor with the herbs and spices.  My daughter helped with the spices and was a little heavy-handed with the onion powder, but it was delicous anyway.  We didn't discard the skin (that's the best part!) and it was so delicious!  The meat was super tender and juicy.  I roasted at 350 for about an hour and a half.  The juices in the bottom of the pan were great for drizzling over brown rice!

This is the best (and easiest) whole chicken recipe I've ever used. My husband (the picky eater) says this is a definate keeper. Bonus-the leftovers make wonderful chicken salad sandwichs the next day.

We thought this was a good recipe--nothing to complain about for sure.  It is not one, however, to remain in my memory!  I followed the recipe exactly.

I thought this was a fantastic recipe. Used fresh thyme in place of rosemary, as I think it compliments chicken better. Served with a lemon rice found on this site.

I made this with 2 Cornish Hens. I omitted the fresh rosemary as I'm not a huge fan, plus I didn't want to buy an entire package of it just for 2 sprigs. This was really good - great blend of flavors. Thanks, Margaret!

I used this recipe, minus the lemon juice, to roast drumsticks. I didn't have a roaster so I used a shallow baking dish and rolled alumimun foil into cylinders to keep the chicken from touching the dish and allowing room for the drippings. I've never roasted anything..ever. This recipe is absolutely delicious.

Very good flavor ~ will definately make again.  My chicken was just over 5 lbs, so had to cook it longer.  Part way through cooking, I had to cover it with foil because it was getting too brown too quick.  I followed the recipe with the exception of not using rosemary sprigs because I didn't have any.

Another 5 star review! This was so delicious and tender, the meat just fell right off the bone. The store only had 5+ pound chickens, so I doubled the seasoning. I also puts a few pats of butter under the breast skin, and did everything else as the recipe suggested. I roasted on a roasting rack/pan for about 3 hours since it was so much larger. My boyfriend insisted this was the best roasted chicken he has ever had. Really easy prep and fantastic results - I recommend.

This was very good.  I used seasonings I had on hand, and the aroma that filled the house while it was roasting was lovely.  A 3.89 lb. bird was not done after 2 hours, though, so allow cooking time for the size of chicken.

This was great.  Roasted it on a rack above a pan filled with potato, carrot, onion, garlic, more rosemary, chicken stock, and squeezed lemon chunks.  My four pound bird took two hours.

This is the best recipe for a chicken roaster I have ever tried!  It is absolutely delicious.  I tried it with a 17 lb turkey as well - everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.

This was fabulous! I didn't have any rosemary or thyme, so I subbed some mixed Italian spices for those. I also cut up a few slices of butter and placed them under the skin. I served this with garlic mashed potatoes and a ham & split pea salad. Totally awesome!

Loved this roaster. I used a 7 pounder so I doubled the herbs and added salt and pepper to the mix. Stirred the herb mixture into 4 Tbs of softened butter. Washed and patted dry the bird, rubbed half the butter herb mixture under the breast skin and the rest over the breasts and legs. Stuffed the lemon halves and 4 smashed garlic cloves inside the cavity and tied up the legs with kitchen twine. Placed the bird on a rack in a roasting pan. Baked at 425 degrees for 20 mins uncovered and then turned down the oven to 350 degrees. Tented him with foil and continued baking for approximately 15-20 mins per lb or until a thermometer read 180 degrees. The skin was so yummy good, the meat buttery, moist and delicious. Five hundred stars! :)

Very flavorful and easy to make. A recipe I was looking for with just the right amount of spices.
