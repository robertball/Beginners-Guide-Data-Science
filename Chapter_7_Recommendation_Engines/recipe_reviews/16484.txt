Great taste.  Second time I made it, instead of frying it, I sprayed it with butter flavored cooking spray and baked it in the oven.

I used wings instead of the whole chicken for the SuperBowl and these rocked! I wasn't able to find plain dry tomato soup mix but used a tomato/chicken mix I found at the Hispanic market. These turned out super crisp and golden just like a fried chicken should be. Excellent!
