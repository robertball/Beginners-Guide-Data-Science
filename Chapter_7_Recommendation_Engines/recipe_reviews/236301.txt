The marinade also tenderizes the steak. Any marinade with acid (tomato, vinegar, citrus juices, pineapple juice, etc.) will tenderize. I leave my meat in marinade over night or all day, but no longer. If you leave it too long the meat texture changes and gets "mushy". And don't try to save calories by omitting the oil. Your meat will turn out dry. I don't have an outdoor grill, so I grill in my G Foreman grill. For room temperature meat and 1" thick meat, I cook for 6 minutes on preheated grill. Perfect medium rare, tender & juicy!

This was a marinade that became better as the meal progressed.  We love the flavor of a good steak and rarely add more than salt and pepper.  At first, I was put off a bit by the slightly sweet flavor of the balsamic vinegar.  When I was on my last bite, I was thinking, this is a great flavor.  For the outside grill, though, 1/3 cup of olive oil made the grill flare up, and the steaks were well marbled, so I would not use that amount of olive oil again.  DS is not a mustard fan, so I cut back on the mustard a bit, and I totally forgot to add the liquid smoke (didn't miss it, due to the outside grill).  Other than that, it was a nice change from our usual steak dinner.  Thanks for the idea!

If you have had problems with getting steaks tender, look no further with this recipe. This recipe is easy and it was a great hit for Father's Day.  I grilled boneless ribeye steaks yum yum.

We lucked up some porter houses in the markdown bin. I was ready to try something new and hit on this marinade.  OMG! It's wonderful! Didn't have Worcestershire so I used Lea and Perrins. Used some roasted garlic. Six minutes each side over medium. You will really like this marinade on just about anything! GUMBO GAL

I put together the ingredients as posted on the recipe. I marinated pork chops for 4 hours and they were great. Thanks for a great combination of flavors.  I would not change anything.

This is such a good marinade! I went a bit lighter on the balsamic and  Worcestershire sauce. Also used garlic powder since I didn't have garlic handy (less than fresh called for).

My family loved this! I marinated the steaks for about 6 hours then allowed the to come to room temperature before grilling them. I used NY Strip Steaks & cooked them 4 minutes per side then let them rest for 10 minutes. Perfect medium-rare! Except for using half of the soy sauce called for because I ran out, I followed the recipe as written using a few dashes of  hickory liquid smoke. The liquid smoke I think is what gave the steaks that extra flavor! Definitely a keeper thank you for the recipe!

This was delicious on tri-tip steaks. Only marinated about 40 minutes because it was a last minute idea and it tasted great. Didn't measure anything just guesstimated and it came out perfect. Will make this again and  again.

This was great; marinating for 24 hours gives it the full flavor. Just a few simple ingredients and very tasty. This is be my new go-to steak marinade.

I don't eat meat but made this for my dad and son. They both loved it. My dad in particular kept raving about it and asked me to make it again. I followed the recipe with the exception that I didn't have Montreal seasoning so I used a general herb mix and instead of oil I used a little butter on each steak as I read that works well somewhere.

So yummy! I used rice vinegar and left out the Dijon and it was awesome! I only had about 45 minutes for the meat to marinate and it was still juicy, tender and flavorful! This is one recipe I am saving!

Made it with steak tips. Added a few splashes of hot sauce, a pinch of seasoned salt, and some herbs de garnie.  Roasted them alongside some fresh peppers and onions and served over yellow rice. Best marinade ever! Thanks so much!

I tried this a few weeks ago when marinating cubed ribeye for skewers, and it was so good that I have already made it a second time.  I was out of dijon, so substituted a generous squirt of plain old yellow mustard.  This is a keeper!
