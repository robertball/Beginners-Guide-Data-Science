Interesting, but we didn't really care for the addition of the Ranch.  It seemed to compete with the Italian dressing.  Also added lots of extras like cheese, veggies, and ham.

I'm not sure I see the point of the ranch dressing, but as a cold pasta salad it is good without the ranch. Just cook the pasta and chicken and combine with the olives and Italian dressing and let marinate and chill.

It was good, but I didn't care for all the italian dressing. I'm thinking about using more ranch dressing and less italian the next time I make this.

Tasty! Admittedly, I did do this a bit differently because I didn't even bother reading the directions until after I had already made it. I knew I wanted to serve it as a cold salad, so I cooked the pasta, grilled the chicken, combined everything (added tomatoes & cucumber), and then chilled. Yum :)
