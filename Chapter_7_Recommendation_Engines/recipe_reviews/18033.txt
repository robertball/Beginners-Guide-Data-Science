This recipe was great after I made a couple adjustments. I added 4 tablespoons of flour to avoid a runny pie.I saw someone say their crust was soggy on the bottom. I brush the bottom of the crust with egg white before adding the filling. I also used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar. To finish the pie for a picture perfect look, brush the top with the remaining egg white and sprinkle with white sugar. Never a pasty dull looking crust will you ever have again. I always get "oohs and ahhhs". If you're creative, you can cut shapes into the top crust before putting on the top, like hearts. Save the cut out hearts to lay decoratively around the pie, securing in place with egg white as "glue" and brushing the top of them with the egg white as well. If the crust starts to brown too quick, lay a piece of aluminum foil over the top for the remainder of baking. Don't seal it on, just lay over the top of the pie.

Loved this recipe. I used granny smith apples and it had a great taste. My bottom crust was soggy, but to avoid this you can dust the bottom crust with flour before putting in the filling. Will make again.

This recipe is *perfect*.  Toward the end, I brush the top crust with melted butter and add a little cinnamon sugar.  Thank you so much for this delicious apple pie recipe...I will never look for another.

A little runny. The next time I made it, I substituted corn starch in place of flour and also cut down on amount of sugar, used 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup.

OK recipe, after tweeking. This was my first time baking a pie and I wanted to surprise my hubby with his favorite. I followed this recipe to the "T", but I used a store-bought crust. I surpised him alright...with runny filling and under cooked apples! What a sloppy mess! I was disappointed and embarassed because I read every review before choosing this recipe. There is a happy ending though...I put the pie back in the oven for another hour and 15 minutes (covered the crust with foil), and then I put it in the fridge overnight and finally this morning...Aunt Bev's apple pie! Beware.

Yummy!Tart apples are the only ones that should be in a pie. I used granny smiths and the sweetness/tartness was perfect. Mine was a little runny and was the last time I made this also. Next time I'll add a bit more flour. Flavor is excellent though. Use the baker's secret pie crust from this site.

what a great apple pie!  it was very easy to make, and turned out beautifully!  I used the easy flaky pie crust recipe for the crust.  I'll make this my new apple pie recipe.

This apple pie always gets rave reviews - I love to try new recipies on your website and this recipe is one I keep coming back to!  You can always switch it up a little by adding more cinnamon, and sometimes depending on what type of apples I am using - I cut back on the sugar.

Taste is great - but this was really, really runny. *Update, I made this with granny smith apples and FIVE tablespoons of flour, worked a lot better.

Huge hit at the party I took it to!  I used all 7 apples, and a 10 inch glass pie dish.  I was afraid it would not be moist enough, but it was perfect, great consistency and everything.  My only suggestion is to put a pan at least one rack underneath the dish in the oven, as my pie did bubble over just a bit.  Thanks for a keeper!

Very good! This was a big hit...I used more cinnamon and less sugar as other reviewers mentioned. I used Cortland apples. I also dusted the inside of the bottom crust with flour to keep from getting soggy and glazed the top crust at the end of baking with sugar and 2 tablespoons of melted butter!

I'm not a fan of apple pie and so I have never made one, but my hubby wanted one for his b-day instead of cake. My pie plate is 9.5" so I was able to use up all of the 10 apples that I had (4 granny smith, 5 mcintosh, 1 fugi). The next time I make this pie, I will go with more granny smiths. I feel like they held up better after baking. I read all the reviews before trying and this is what I ended up doing: brushed the bottom crust whit egg white before filling (to prevent sogginess), doubled the spices, used 3 tbsp flour/3tbsp cornstarch & added a splash of vanilla to the apples. After 20 minutes of baking, I brushed the top crust with egg white and sprinkled with granulated sugar. Everyone who tried the pie loved it :)

I made my own shortcrust pastry and made these into small individual pies using a bun tray. I cooked them for about 2 minutes and they came out perfect. I love the cinnamon and nutmeg taste and how the apple still holds it's form, but is soft when you bite into it. Just sweet enough but retaining a little tartness -perfect. I used 1 bramley apple (they're massive) instead of 7 tart apples and it made 15 small pies :)

This recipe combined with other reviewer suggestions was my best apple pie ever. I've always had problems with soggy, undercooked bottom crusts. When using my pizza stone recently it occurred to me that baking a pie on it might help. I put the stone in when first turning on the oven and used the suggestion of brushing the bottom crust with egg white. Perfect! The other suggestions I incorporated were: Used half white & half brown sugar, reducing both slightly. Brushed the top crust with egg white & sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. Changed the flour to 3 tablespoons flour & 3 tablespoons corn starch. Used 2 teaspoons cinnamon & 3/4 teaspoon nutmeg. The end result was no runny mess, perfectly cooked apples & flaky bottom crust (I use Pillsbury crusts - love them). Can't wait to make this one again.

Thank you Lori for submitting this recipe, basic apple pie, two crusts. Delicious, but I put in 1/2 cup a.p. flour with apple seasoning mix, to be safe.

I thought this recipe was great. I read all the reviews so I used 5 apples, 3 gala and 2 granny smith, 3/4 cup sugar, and 5 tbs flour. I brushed the crust with egg white so it wouldn't get soggy. The end result is the picture with the flower crust top. I served it with vanilla ice cream and my whole family loved it.

It was really quite good. I used Macintosh apples. The only thing I didn't like was the nutmeg. I cut sugar by 1/4 cup. I will make again without nutmeg. I used my own pie crust, which is really tender! I also cover the rim with foil for the first 40 minutes; remove and continue baking. This way even the rim is tender.

I was disapointed, way to runny, a sloppy pie. I was looking forward to a good apple pie kinda like a store bought one, I followed this to a T and it was to runny. I say keep looking for another receipe.

This is a great recipe. Adding the flour to the apple mix really helps to keep the filling from becoming too runny. I omitted the nutmeg and used macintosh apples instead of tart apples because of personal preference but otherwise followed the recipe. This turned out to be the best apple pie I have made yet!

This is the best apple pie I've ever made.  It was so good that I made it 3X in 1 wk.  And not to mention the way the house smells when it's being cooked.  To keep things simple, I bought the pillsbury pie crust.  It was delicious.  I cant wait to start making it again this fall/winter.

The flavor was great but the filling was a bit runny.  Good tip on baking at 400 for the first 30 minutes and reducing the temp. for the last 20 minutes to help avoid the overly brown crust.

My parents came to visit my husband and I at our new home and I made this as my very first apple pie. My mom raved! She said that next to hers and my grandmothers it was the best pie she'd ever eaten! I baked the bottom crust for about 7 minutes before I put the filling in it though.

I added brown sugar like others suggested, But the filling was a bit thick. Next time I will use a little  more butter to think it out.

This is the best apple pie!  I made it for my husband and daughter (not being a big apple pie lover myself) and now I am a huge fan!  Let sit for awhile to let thicken before you eat!  Just as good the next day.

This is a really easy recipe.  It is cooking right  now, and smells wonderful.  I am giving it to my mother, but I am definitely going to make another one for my family at home tomorrow.  If I don't they will probably kill me.

YUM! My son-in-law wanted apple pie for his birthday, since we live in Michigan, and it's fall, it was a perfect request.  I used a combination of Cortland and Granny Smith apples.  This one will be put in the recipe box.

Really good! The only thing I changed was I made it a dutch apple pie because I don't really like crust that much. I didn't change the filling at all. It was super runny though after 50 minutes at 400 degrees, so I had to let it bake for at least 30 more minutes. Next time I might add more flour to it. Other than that, it was perfect!

First time ever making apple pie. It was delish! I will keep this as my only apple pie recipe. I used granny smith apples, although only about 6 fit into the pie shell.

The pie turned out excellent - was praised by the biggest apple pie aficionados at Thanksgiving as the best they'd had in years.  Should have cut larger slits to help the pie vent as some of the filling spilled out into the oven, but overall turned out great!

This was my first time ever making a pie (and pie crust), and if I may say so, this is the best apple pie I've ever had!  I used Macintosh apples and they went great with the mouth-watering cinnamony gravy!  I used the Best Ever Pie Crust recipe for the crust, and it came out golden and flaky.

This was very good. I even messed up and forgot to put the sugar in and had to take the top crust off and just sprinkle sugar throughout as best I could and then put the top back on and it still came out great! I had no problem with runny sauce or gummy bottom. I did use an egg wash on the top with sugar sprinkled over it and it came out nice and brown. I did turn the heat down when it got brown so it wouldn't burn which made it possible to stick my small ham in next to it.

Fabulous. I also sprinkled the bottom with flour and painted the top with eggs yolk and sugar. On the inside I added cut up pieces of caramel candies. It was delicious!

I've made this recipe twice now, and everyone enjoyed it.  I did not find the pie too runny. But it is juicy.  Mixes in with the ice cream better. This one will stay in the recipe box for the daughter in-laws

I loved this the only issue I had it was a bit too runny which maybe next time I will used more flour. But also might cut back on the sugar. I did 1/2 brown and 1/2 white. But it was still wonderful thank u..

Excellent traditional apple pie recipe! Glad I found it. In the past my apple pies either turned out too tart or too sweet, but if you follow the instructions and use tart apples like Granny Smith the tart/sweet balance in this pie is perfect.

great Recipe! I did make a few changes 1) because I was pressed for time 2) because some of it is just how I remember my grandmother doing it. I was very young the last time I saw my grandma make a pie but this gave methe basics I needed to try my own. So changes..I used 3/4c white sugar 1/4 brown. I added a TINY bit of cloves and just eyed and tasted for cinnamon n nutmeg. Change 2 I used refridg crust (no time) change 3 I added about a half cup of raisins to the bottom of the pie. they soak up the juice that tends to make the bottom crust mushy and gooy. They plump up with all those yummy juices and add a little something. Also unlike a lot of people I didnt use any butter. But it was very  sweet and yummy. Thanks for the great starter!!! I have now added pies to my list of baking

Great pie, made it for a raffle, and received many compliments from the winner. Made it with the French Pastry Pie Crust from Allrecipes. Shut the oven off and left the pie in the oven for 10 more minutes so it would not be runny. Will definitely keep this in my recipe box and use again.

Very disappointed in the consistency, or lack of, in this pie recipe.  The taste was okay, but as other reviewers reported, too runny.  I made this apple pie twice in 2 days, thinking that I had done something wrong....not so, the recipe should be revised - I'm thinking more flour to firm it up, as I've seen in other fruit pie recipes.  I would try another recipe for better results.

Exelent pie, I give it a 4 only because it was a bit too sweet for my taste.  I had no problems with it being runny, and it had an even better flavor when it was reheated.

A perfect pie!!!! First time I made as the recipe reads. The crust domed over the filling, so the second time I made on I baked the apples for 20 mins to soften them so they settle, then added them to the crust and baked until the crust was golden brown. It tasted wonderful, and the crust lay on top of the filling this time, but the apples were a little overdone. Next time I will bake the apples a shorter time.

I Made this Pie  it was easy to make and tasted great..  If you add 1 tablespoon of dry tapioca to the mix it will take care of the extra juices without affecting the pie. It turned out great. I will make this recipe again!!

This is a great recipe.  I haven't made my classic recipe in over a decade (lost it).  This was really easy and came out delicious. I used 3 granny smith apples instead but my apples were large and I barely fit the top crust on.  At first with the spice mix I wasn't sure what to do.  I coated the apples with it and threw in the butter but I had all this stuff left over so I just poured most of it into the apples.  It was so yummy.  I am trying to get rid of this pie before I eat the whole thing...only about 4 1/2 slices to go....been hiding it so I forget it is there...I am really thankful for allrecipes.com

I have yet to find an apple pie recipe that rivals my grandmother's.  This recipe is good for a quick fix.  I always make my own pie crust as there is a noticable difference. I have found the frozen or already prepared pie crusts to be too salty for our taste. I use Cortland apples which seem to be the best for pie (tart yet sweet and very crisp). Excellent for pie baking! Also, I prefer using white and brown sugar mixed with cinnamon to help sweeten the apples. I then top with tiny pats of butter (evenly) and cover with the homemade pie crust - careful to pinch the top and bottom crusts together. I always cut slits in the top of the pie to allow the steam to escape. This helps to keep the pie crust flaky. You can brush the top pie crust with milk and cover the crust with a crust presever just before baking. I check the crust with about 20 minutes of bake time left and sometimes I will remove the preserver so that the crust browns up nice. Serve pie warm with cinnamon ice cream for an extra treat! Enjoy!

As Janice from "Friends" would say......OH MY GOD!!!  That is absolutely the best pie I have ever tasted.  So good in fact that my husband said he liked it more than his mother's apple pie.    He wants me to make another one already!!

Excellent!  Made for my hubby for his birthday.  He said it was the best!  I used 7 Granny Smith apples.  I used the Pillsbury boxed double pie crust (maybe one of these days, I'll attempt a crust from scratch).  Also, as other reviewers suggested, I used 1 tsp. lemon juice and sprinkled the bottom of my pie crust with flour before filling.  I didn't have the problem with it being too watery, but I did let it sit in the fridge for one day before slicing.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe! This was my first attempt at an apple pie and it turned out delicious! I used granny smith apples and sliced them somewhat thin. I used the recommended cook time and it came out great! This was a great treat at our Thanskgiving. Thank you!

A great apple pie - smelled delicious while baking.  My pie pan must be smaller than most because I only managed to fit four apples in there, and even so it was towering!  I halved the sugar but used the same amount of flour and, perhaps as a result, had no problem with runniness.  My only complaint is that the lower crust was a little soggy.  Next time I'll bake it on its own for a few minutes before adding the filling and upper crust, which is what I normally do.

Didn’t care for this recipient at all and I won’t be using it again. I misplaced the recipe I used last year so I settled on this one, big mistake. When I took it out of the oven I sat it out overnight to cool. The next morning I picked it up to move it and juice poured out all over me and the floor. Apple pies shouldn’t be that juicy. I read the reviews before making it and added an extra tablespoon on flower to the mix but apparently even that wasn’t enough. I popped it back in the over to dry up the juice which worked however I had to bake it so long my crust was ruined.

This recipe is identical to my friend Judy's Grandmother's.  It is fabulous [4+ stars] as is but a bit sweet for me - I like my fruit TART.   For a bit more tartness you can 1]  cut the sugar down to 3/4 c. OR    2]  add 1/4 to 1/2* c. cranberries. 
(*beautiful and perfect tartness!)  Either of these add the last half star!  Now MY grandson asks me to bake it for Him.

I've used this recipe for years as a basic apple pie recipe that I've experimented with several times. My favorite is substituting 1/2 C brown sugar and 1/4 C regular sugar. I use 4 T flour instead of 2 because it will be soggy/runny if you don't and I always use Granny Smith Apples. I use 2 teas. apple pie spice instead of the cinnamon and nutmeg. Great recipe done original way but use the extra flour.

I followed this recipe exactly.  I read other reviews about it being too runny.  I thought it was perfect.  I think they had to let it cool more.  If you cut it when it is too warm from the oven, it will be runny.  Let it cool for about 30 minutes.

I'm only giving this four stars because I took alot of hints from other reviews. I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar, and used a little less on the cinnamon, used 5 tbs of flour excluded the salt, added a small amount of vanilla extract, and lemon zest. I also brushed the crust's w egg whites and sprinkled the top pie crust w white sugar. Doing all of that, my pie turned out GREAT! I used mostly granny smith apples and it's tartness paired so well with all that sugar.

This was tasty, but pie crusts are difficult. Mine didn't cook all the way through on the bottom middle before the top started to look charred. I think there are tips somewhere for preventing that, but the tinfoil on the edges didn't work for me.

This pie was filled amazing! Thank you  "Wick of Twizt" for your review because I used your version to have a crispy, non-runny/soggy crust. The only thing that I did different was the sugar because I didn't have very much... 1/2 C. White Sugar 1/2 C. Brown Sugar 4 tablespoons of Flour Egg whites: spread on the bottom for crispy crust and on the top crust to achieve a beautiful golden carmel color  Bakeware Tip: Pampered Chef makes a pie crust shield only for $7.50. It works great and prevents over cooking the edges of any pie crust!

I followed the recipe exact and it came out perfect.  Second time I made it I added a 1/4 cup of sauteed walnuts to the apple mix - it was nice - but I prefer not doing any adjusting to this one.

I loved this recipe! it was delicious. When i saw that it said to add the sugar spice mixture to the apples and just put it in the crust i thought that it was going to be very apple-y and there wouldn't be enough liquid. but after i baked it it was just perfect. mty dad and brother and i all loved itand it was finished within the first day.

My whole family loved this pie.  And thanks for the tip about brushing the bottom crust with egg white so it doesn't get soggy.  I'd never done that before.

This gets five stars with several changes I made. First, I used 6 apples because 7 would've been too much. I also added at least a half cup of flour to the apple mixture which sounds like a lot but ended up PERFECT to thicken it just right. And lastly I forgot to put the tbsp of butter before I sealed the top crust but didn't miss it at all. It came out absolutely perfect.

This is a great base recipe. After reading many reviews and suggestions I made a few adjustments: used half granny smith, half macintosh. I bushed the bottom cust with egg whites to keep from getting to soggy. I also used 4 tbs flour. I made a beautifully decorative leaf crust that I brushed with the remaining egg white and sprinkled with sugar. Once the crust browned I poured the butter in to the in through my vent holes, as I totally fogot to put on the pats before the crust. It was fantastic!!!! Great with a scoop of ice cream.

Delish!  I followed the recipe to a T.  This was my first attempt at a pie ever so, I had a bit of trouble rolling out the pie crust (I had to buy boxed pie crust mix b/c I couldn't find already made shells go figure).  Anyways despite my crust not looking so perfect the pie tasted awesome!  This is a great, simple good old standby that I will definitely make again.  I found already rolled pie crust at the supermarket the other day too go figure!  Next time I will use that :)  Thanks Aunt Bev!  ;)

Great Recipe! I've made a few apple pies before, but this one is the best. I don't think it was too runny, we liked it that way. I made it with the Miracle Baking Powder Pie Crust recipe from this site. I will definitely make this one again. Thank you!

I've made this pie several times and always get rave reviews! I use a "crumb" topping instead of the second pie crust. This is a keeper...won't be needing any other apple pie recipes! The nutmeg makes it perfect!!

Very good recipe! I didn't have any nutmeg and spaced and forgot to add butter and it still came out very tasty. Not sure I will even bother with the butter next time, but I think the nutmeg will be the finishing touch to make it perfect. The consistency was excellent.

I liked this recipe for its simplicity.  This was the first apple pie I'd ever tried to make from scratch and thought the simplest recipe would be the best for me to learn with!  I used a mix of 3 Granny Snith and 4 Golden Delicious apples and thought it turned out pretty well for a first attempt.

Made this for my son's birthday, he loves apple pie, he said it was really good and ate two slices.  I used corn starch instead of flour (which is how I make blueberry pie) and the pie was a little runny, not too bad, but I think next time I will use at least 3 tablespoons of starch.  When the pie was done, I brushed on some corn syrup that I thinned slightly with a small amount of hot water, then sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top, put back in the oven for 3 minutes, so the top was shiny and glossy.

Hubby likes!  about to make this for the second time with some twists. First time I got rave reviews from my husband.he prefers the filling not to be too mushy and appreciated that the apples were still a bit firm. This time I will brush some eggwash to the bottom crust and add some flour to the filling. we'll see what happens!

Baked this pie for a church potluck dinner. I used the Miracle Baking Powder Pie Crust found on this site; the result was an excellent pie. The only change I made was to squeeze the juice of a half lemon into the pie mixture.  Adjust the sugar according to the tartness of your apples.  You will get a lot of compliments!!!

Well I liked it because it wasn't runny when I added a bit of flour to the bottom of the crust before sticking in the apples but my hubby " the pie lover " thought that the apples were to soft by the time that  the crust was ready !

Very very good!!!! I tend to over-complicate things, and when recipies are this simple, I have to add to it - - but I DIDN'T this time!! I stuck with this and the paie turned out WONDERFULLY!! I used 4 Honey Crisps and 4 Granny Smiths... I learned a way back that making a good apple pie is made GREAT when you combine types of apples... cant get much different than these two - but the Honey Crisps are fall and early winter only.... YUMMY!

I used a refrigerated crust and it wasn't terrible, but like others said it came out a bit runny. I'll try adding more cornstarch/flour next time to thicken it up.

My husband made this pie two weeks ago and it was superb.  This was the first pie he ever made and everyone was so impressed by it.  No one ever would have guessed it was his first pie he ever made.  I loved it so much; I am making another one today to put in the freezer.

This turned out perfectly fine, but was really no different than any basic apple pie recipe found in any cookbook. That's why only 3 stars.

I loved this recipe. It turned out great.  When I was younger I tried to make fruit pies but they never turned out.  This apple pie renewed my confidence in my fruit pie making abilities. Move over grandma... guess who it going to bring the pie to Christmas this year!!

Followed the recipe and came out SUPER runny; took the advice of another entry and covered in foil and baked an additional hour. After that it was prefect!

This pie is so lush!  Very easy to make...the very first apple pie I have ever made!  My friend has an apple tree in her garden, so we thought to put those apples to yummy-use.  This recipe is so simple, easy, and worth every yummy bit of it!...just a shame it takes so long in the oven! hehe

excellent recipe! Could lessen the sugar a touch cause it's pretty sweet. I found my oven might have been a little hot and only cooked the recipe at 400 degrees for 15 mind then 20 more mins at 350 degrees then I took a rip from another review and brushed the top with a butter, brown sugar and cinimon mxture. Then icover the pie and finished the cooking time.
   Instead of just slits fir the steam to escape I carved the initial of the  family name into the top crust for an added effect and pressed the tip of a  fork around the edges of the pie for an added effect.

AWESOME!
i've tried alot of pie recipes but all of them turn out too dry, but this was PERFECT! i made about ten so far and everyone loves them. the spices are great, although i did not use pie spice. and i did not have any bought pie crust so i made it by scratch. Its a little harder but the crust is amazing.

Too many apples unless you're making a deep dish. The recipe needs double the amount of cinnamon and flour. My filling came out watery, even after cooking another 10 minutes and checking the interior temperature which had reached 100 degrees centigrade.

This was an awesome Pie. The only thing that I did not add was the salt. I also added the butter with the spice mix instead of putting it on top. I used philsbury crust instead of making my own because of time. It was even better cold than warm. Thank you for sharing!!

Excellent pie!! It was my first attempt at an apple pie. My husband loved it. Since I have tasted apple pies in the past that were watery, I didn't want that to happen with mine, so I did add 2 tbsp of tapioca. It turned out perfect! Thank you!

I can't say this was the best pie I've tasted.  I think the nutmeg was too overwhelming and I wish I had omitted it or cut it down to 1/8 tsp.  My husband said it tasted like Christmas and my son said it was like potpourri.  Cooking time was accurate and apples came out nice.

I made this for my dad's birthday rather than cake.  He said the taste was great but it was a little runny.  I used Granny Smith apples.  I will try it again but with a different apple and see how it turns out.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic and the closest thing to my Mom's wonderful apple pie recipe.  It's easy to assemble and makes one very generous size pie.  I will be making this often.  Thanks so much, Lori for another family favorite.

This was my first attempt at a pie and it turned out great!  It was a hit at Thanksgiving. I used Jonathan Apples and a store bought crust.  Now for Christmas I'm going to be bold and attempt to make my own crust as well as try out this recipe with Granny Smith Apples.
