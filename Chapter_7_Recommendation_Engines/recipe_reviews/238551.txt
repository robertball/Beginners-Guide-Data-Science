Delicious! Seitan lends itself quite well to being imitation steak. The stuff I bought was the crumbly kind, so it behaved like ground beef but it was still great in our steakless cheesesteaks! I added some garlic powder to the whole mix. Quite tasty, and only took about 25 start to finish. P.S. I'm a meat eater and served this to my meat eating family and it was a hit.

I just had this and boy was it GOOD! I used homemade seitan and added a little garlic when I was sauteing the seitan up. I am wishing I had more.

This was my first recipe I tried using seitan and Iâ€™ll say that I did really enjoy it even if I am still a little unsure what the seitan tasted like. It was a little dry end it made me wish I had some sort of au jus sauce to dip it in. Any suggestions? Also, I substituted pepper jack cheese for the provolone.
