This is a great recipe.  I recieved rave reviews from everyone in the office.  
A few hints:  
1. No need to seperate out ingredients just dump them all into one bowl and mix them up.
2. If you don't have a mini muffin pan line a large cake pan with mini cupcake liners close together.  This doesn't work as well with the large cupcake liners but works well with the small ones.

All in all a great recipe.

I doubled this recipe and made them for church and they were a big hit!  They are yummy and would be great just baked in a pan, also.  Take them out of the oven a tiny bit underdone, or they get too dry.

If you like brownies with a hint of coffee flavor this is for you. Yummy. I used 2T instant espresso powder for more of a coffee flavor. Very moist and chocolatey in a mini muffin pan. Thanks Laura!

Very good, however I think they would taste just as good made like brownies and it would be less work and expense...

Wow! I baked these for a gathering and they were gone in minutes. I made mine in the same pan but without the liners. Worked perfect and tasted great. Dusting them with 10x put the final touch, don't leave that out!  Thanks for the recipe

These were awesome. Everyone loved them. We made them as described and also with the vanilla hazelnut cappucino mix. They were both excellent. We will definitely make this again. Also, it's better to underbake them. Then you get a nice mushy center.

These are simple and easy to make.  I followed the recipe as written and thought they were a great hit.  Because I am not a coffee fan I used the amount of coffee called for.  Even a non-coffee drinker will like them.

The first thing I have to say is my husband and I ate too many of these last night.  These are just awesome.  I didn't make any adjustments to the recipe except I didn't dust them with powdered sugar.  I will make these again and again.

Little bits of cappuccino wonderfulness! I followed the advice of others and used 2 tablespoons of the instant coffee. Otherwise, I followed the recipe closely. They are so cute and so tasty! Everyone I shared with thought it was different (in a good way!) and they enjoyed it! 

So easy and very good. I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but I had a jar of instant coffee from a tiramisu recipe I tried awhile back so I'm glad I got to bust it out and use some of it! I will happily make these again!

I made 18 standard size muffins.  I used the Giradelli dark chocolate brownie mix with chocolate chips in it.  I used paper liners in my cup cake tin, filled them a little over half way and baked them for 15 min.  Perfect!
Will be making these again!

I wish I would have followed the directions and used paper liners in my pan.  I chose to grease my pan, as I do a lot when I make mini brownies.  But, these were impossible to remove from the pan.  Since I was out of mini liners, I chose to use the leftover batter in my regular muffin tin, which I did have liners for.  I only ended up with 6 bon- bons that weren't ruined from the removal process.  I guess now I can try my hand at making a brownie trifle.  The taste of these is very good.  I really like the addition of the cinnamon.

They're very easy & delicious!  I put a raspberry in the middle of each one before baking to give them a little extra touch.

These came out really delicious. I'm not a big coffee person so the amount of coffee flavor was perfect for me. I topped these off with a cinnamon cream cheese frosting which added the perfect bit of tang and sweetness to these. 1 (8 oz) package of cream cheese softened, 1 stick(1/2 cup) butter softened, 1 tsp vanilla, 2-2 1/2 cups powdered sugar and cinnamon to taste. Very yummy!

I made these last night and they were good, but even using 2 heaping tablespoons of instant espresso, I can barely taste the coffee flavor.  Next time I will double or triple it.  Regardless, they're still very moist and good. I used Ghirardelli's dark chocolate brownies with chips.  I agree that baking for no more than 10 min gives them a softer center. The cinnamon is a good touch and more mocha flavor would be perfect; otherwise they just taste like brownies.

This is a beautiful recipe.  I only had a small pan for the mini muffins and used another small cake pan for the rest of the batter.  The one thing I used was strong coffee instead of instant.  It's really important not to overbake this recipe.  I did, but what I did to fix it was poke lots of hole in it and pour coffee liquor over it.  It was absolutely delicious!  A keeper and soooooooooooo easy!

I have made this recipe 2x and I am done. I had a difficult time getting them out of muffin tin each time and they were hard. I pulled them out when the toothpick was clean. I used coffee instead of water and also used 2 tbls international coffee swiss mocha. I ended up frosting them to make them a little more appetizing.

Used another reviewers suggestion and used International French Vanilla Instant coffee. For some reason, my BonBons all caved in. So, after they cooled I filled the hole with French Vanilla Cool Whip and refridgerated them until needed. Then, just before serving I drizzled carmamel ice cream topping over all. They were delicious! Will make again. (They are also great crumbled into a dish and topped with ice cream. Yum!)

Really good, a hit at our party!  I used triple chunk brownie mix, it was fabulous.  Instead of plain instant coffee, I used 1 1/2 tbsp. Intl. Foods SF French Vanilla Cafe and 1/2 tbsp instant coffee.  The combination of flavors tasted great, the cinnamon really came through.

Outrageous!   A new favorite at our house that's for sure.  I loved how easy the recipe went together and how delicious the brownies turned out.   I got 36 minis from the batch, which was perfectly alright with my family and DBF's co-workers.

I thought these were great - took them to a evening church group meeting and they loved them - they didn't think of them as brownies - more like mini cupcakes! I used a Giradellai (sp?)brownie mix that has chocolate chips & a pkg. of glaze in the box and added extra coffee.

These are so easy, yet taste so special. I made them for my garden club meeting and they were gone in a flash. Everybody wanted the recipe and couldn't believe it began with a mix.

You should put the word disappearing somewhere in that name. They're a very unique way of re-instating the browny and that's that.  They took 25 minutes in the oven and they blew up way more then I wanted them to so maybe next time i'll just put in 1/2- 1 scoop in each muffin line, they're also kind of dry so i'll have to find a way to improve that and tweak the recipe but other then that thery were perfect, I added 1 cup of nuts but I could hardly taste them so if you decide to do so add about 1/2 cup more.

These were mediocre, in my opinion.  They are certainly easy to throw together and I suppose they are a nice spin on a box brownie.  The flavor was average.

Really good.  Instead of dusting with confectioners' sugar, I used a coffee icing of 1/8 teaspoon instant coffee crystals, 1 cup powdered sugar, and enough whipping cream to make an icing consistency.

You can also replace the water with extra strong coffee....if you don't have instant on hand.

A very easy way to liven-up brownie mix. These are a huge hit with everyone who tries them and taste like they were more difficult to make than they are.

My boyfriend and my roommate gave these two thumbs up, and I loved them because they were easy, but different from what I normally make.  I used regular sized muffin tins, since I don't own the minis, but that worked just fine, and since I didn't have instant coffee I replaced the water with brewed coffee.  I also took another reviewers suggestion and followed the recipe off of the box for the egg/oil/water ratio instead of this one.  These were ooey-gooey-yummy, and my only complaint was that the coffee taste was barely there--next time I will brew much stronger coffee.

These turned out wonderfully with a true cappucino flavor.  I did not have powder so I dissolved instant coffee in the water (used hot tap water), strong brewed coffee would work as well in place of the water/powder.  They have a nice presentation when dusted with powdered sugar and the paper did not stick to the brownie when peeled.  This recipe is a keeper.

My brownie mix was a tad bigger than it called for. This made two batches in the mini muffin pan. It is kind of time consuming, but they make for great presentation. I used 2 Tbsp. of instant coffee. I would like more of a coffee flavor, but if you put any more in there, I think it would taste burnt. I'm taking these to our church's Fall Festival. Thanks!

These were delicious..however...the coffee/cinnamon flavor is VERY subtle (and I actually increased the coffee to 2 heaping tbsp)....so really they just taste like really yummy brownies.  I think they would need a LOT more coffee to really get that flavor going...

The recipe made 45 for me, and I substituted part of the water for cinnamon creamer for more flavor. I also used 2T instant espresso like others suggested. I liked the flavor, but be aware that there's a fine line between done and over-done on these. 8 minutes and some were soupy. 9 minutes and some were a little hard. I don't know that I'd make them again, just because I have better chocolate bite-size recipes.

Great stuff! I did decide to take it one step further toward adulthood... As I was about to make the coffee to replace the 1/3 cup of water (as others recommended) I glanced over to the liquor cabinet. Yes, Kahlua instead of water or coffee - plus the 2Tbsp of instant coffee & you're set to go! Very grown up & elegant. I will make these again and again.

These are great little two-bite treats.  I always think they need more coffee than is called for but friends that aren't coffee drinkers assure me it's just enough.

My husband liked this, but I didn't think it was anything special.  I did use the 2T instant coffee as was suggested because I wanted a stronger coffee taste.  I think next time I may put a chocolate coffee glaze over the cupcake before dusting with powder sugar.
