Yummy, this is the best splenda recipe & I have tried alot of them of the years.  Awesome texture & taste, not the funky aftertaste you sometimes have.  This recipe is a keeper.

This recipe is very easy and tastes wonderful.  I am allergic to almonds, so I used an almond flavoring (that has no almonds) and walnuts.  This went so fast I am going to have to make another.  This recipe is a keeper!
